"28500","53400"," Let me"
"53400","56780"," turn this stuff over here so I can see you guys are saying."
"59440","60960"," Yeah baby, good morning."
"64440","65600"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"65700","66320"," Happy Friday everybody. "
"67500","71800"," It's Washington Court, the Russian government, reportedly."
"72160","75900"," They did not use the software to buy stocks this week."
"78040","79020"," It's good at 450. "
"79500","80480"," Okay, so we're going to talk about some stuff."
"80480","81240"," Good morning everybody."
"81420","82120"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"82680","83300"," Welcome back. "
"84400","85360"," Everybody's ready for the weekend."
"88180","89380"," Sorry I was late this morning."
"89620","94280"," I got children and I got juggling children, right?"
"97820","98980"," You know what I feel like?"
"99140","103960"," It's weird when my children were young, I would watch movies where you'd see the haggard parents,"
"104620","107500"," and I think they've become more haggard as they get older. "
"107500","112980"," Less so when they were younger, but now that I'm older it's like, they're like right in that weird"
"112980","113320"," age."
"116100","118240"," Got some put buyers on the spy right now."
"120820","121660"," Welcome everybody. "
"121840","122480"," You're all here, right?"
"122700","123280"," Good job, good job."
"124040","129320"," We can see sellers right off of trying this music down here."
"131560","136320"," I don't like my, I don't like my mic this morning. "
"136500","138420"," I don't like, let's just switch it over."
"139220","140200"," Turn that shit off."
"140780","144220"," Okay, I got to take a look at this and see what's going on. "
"144540","145720"," It looks like my properties are good."
"146460","147520"," Okay, so good morning everybody."
"148460","156100"," Right off the gate this morning, you can see that there's some sellers above here right on the spy"
"156100","157820"," and on the market. "
"157820","159100"," This is to be expected."
"159320","163680"," You know that bears have been loading up, loading up, loading up all week long."
"164140","172460"," There's been a couple opportunities this week to take short or put positions, but it's only in"
"172460","176700"," relief in these channels that continue to trade higher. "
"178750","180510"," Now, we'll take a look right here."
"180690","181990"," We're going to go through the spot cam report."
"182290","185070"," They're claiming on spot cam at this support here at 450. "
"185770","186870"," We'll take a look at this real quick."
"186870","189830"," We'll make it fast because I know some of you don't have access to this."
"191770","193810"," There is some interesting information this morning. "
"193950","196910"," Okay, and that's that our volatility estimate dropped another notch with yesterday's rally in the"
"196910","197030"," close."
"197110","203390"," We're now looking for an open close range of just 0.67% versus 0.9% past several sessions."
"204210","206850"," So that's a very small trading range. "
"206890","209470"," Okay, and 1.4% last week."
"209570","210850"," Support lies at 4,500."
"211610","213550"," All right, so mark that down in our new charts. "
"214190","215400"," That support is at 4,500."
"215580","221660"," Resistance is at 45.35. That's a pretty pretty pretty small range, right?"
"221780","227880"," If you guys are thinking about ranges, 45.35 is small, right?"
"228120","234260"," You already know that we're looking for a bounce right now currently on the spot at 4,500, which"
"234260","237940"," doesn't leave a lot of room for movement here, right?"
"240140","245020"," And what's admittedly taken us a bit by surprise is the destruction of ultra-short-dated implied"
"245020","245520"," volatility."
"245840","247260"," Below is the VIX term structure. "
"247760","250060"," This has surprised many people on Twitter hasn't did."
"251020","253280"," We might talk about this at some point later today."
"253480","259720"," I tried to post some stuff on Twitter last night, the regular handle, about what should do well in"
"259720","261140"," this regime that we're in right now. "
"261340","267240"," And one of the pointing parts is smoke apps to do well in this regime right now."
"267560","270400"," Now, what I'm going to say is price, price, price is the destruction of ultra-dated implied"
"270400","271780"," volatility below is the VIX term structure."
"272480","276280"," And you can see how quickly it has gone from strong backwardation blue to Contango Black. "
"277280","278940"," Didn't see any way of talking about that this more than either."
"278940","283120"," This reversal makes sense giving the passing of FOMC and OPEX, but while the VIX is currently near"
"283120","287120"," 21, which implies that 1.3% daily moves, right?"
"287300","295000"," And not like the 0.6%. The SPEX straddle expiring today is just greater or equal to $34, or 0 "
"295000","299740",".75, 0.75% move, meaning there could be a pin to the straddle, right?"
"300720","306200"," Our gamut-based volatility forecast for today is only 0.67%, which suggests this straddle is fairly"
"306200","306920"," valued, right?"
"307300","310420"," We're pretty much at the where the straddle's at, right?"
"312000","313300"," So we'll keep trolling down here."
"313500","315560"," Well, the SP was in unpinnable the last several weeks. "
"315960","317620"," It hit 4,500 and stopped dead."
"318220","319460"," You can see this in the chart below."
"320300","324260"," With the five-day realized volatility metric second chart red line, it's also apparent to the"
"324260","327700"," distribution of recent returns, red bars bottom chart versus the last 30 to 30 days loop. "
"328020","333540"," This stall in price action was brought out, or has brought out sellers of weekly options, and risk"
"333540","336440"," on via short-dated call buying and single stocks."
"337100","337340"," Hmm."
"338180","339900"," Have we seen that in the last couple days?"
"340780","341000"," Hmm. "
"341540","343480"," Risk on and single stocks."
"344160","345780"," Anyone see the familiar names in here?"
"345940","349880"," Tesla, Nvidia, GME, et cetera, et cetera, at all, right?"
"350580","356920"," This type of flow in the weeklies was absent for all of March, but it's put back on suggesting a"
"356920","358740"," large speculative risk appetite."
"359260","364160"," Now, you remember yesterday when we were before we opened yesterday, and it's funny because"
"364160","367320"," yesterday at the end of the day, I talked about I'm going to switch this over so you can watch"
"367320","372200"," the the movements here on. "
"372420","374100"," I'll come back to spot camera for a moment."
"374380","379260"," Yesterday, it's interesting because yesterday, you and I talked yesterday morning, and then later"
"379260","383480"," in the day, I saw a bunch of bears and bulls out there saying this isn't the volume that you're"
"383480","384020"," looking for."
"384620","390440"," And I think that there's a mix up in volume because you're seeing, I'm seeing even bulls out there"
"390440","393160"," saying we don't make big moves unless it's a low volume day. "
"393280","394120"," Yeah, we all know that."
"394940","396900"," We all know it's not on big volume days."
"396900","401000"," And I think that somehow it's, there's a miscommunication here. "
"401800","402240"," Okay."
"402600","407120"," And I think some people are mixing up, not necessarily the ones that are doing the correct, I think"
"407120","412160"," the ones doing the correcting are mixing up the volume that's being talked about in some circles."
"413320","415400"," And that volume is not higher, low volume. "
"415800","418160"," It's the volume that hasn't been in the market."
"418860","420260"," And we looked at that yesterday morning."
"420340","427040"," It's the fact that there's a bit in the market right now that is not the normal bid when things"
"427040","427940"," are bullish, right?"
"428440","434120"," So even the bid that's in the market right now, even though it's low volume rips that got us here,"
"434700","436780"," the money is still on the sidelines. "
"436780","441860"," And so the talk isn't about, hey, if we add more volume in the market, it's not geared towards, oh"
"441860","444400"," yeah, we're going to have a big volume day and the market's going to keep going up."
"444700","448540"," I'm not going to mention who I read that from yesterday, but I know that there's a"
"448540","449360"," miscommunication."
"450300","454180"," And I think that people out there don't realize that the volume that people are talking about is"
"454180","455660"," not a size volume. "
"456260","458820"," It's the fact that there's money on the sidelines."
"459920","466020"," And when we were looking at the indicators yesterday, the point was this can trade sideways and up"
"466020","467380"," for some time before it rolls."
"467460","468660"," We get a nice big bad dip. "
"477780","479020"," But the key is this."
"479360","484740"," The key is that there's money on the sidelines that still hasn't come in."
"485040","491360"," And if that money were to come into the market, right, that you would see another fucking Venerali"
"491360","493860"," with no fucking, no major dip. "
"494560","496680"," So is it possible that that happens?"
"496940","497240"," Sure."
"497520","501900"," Are there other other other indicators underneath the surface that are saying it's curling up?"
"502040","502260"," Yes."
"502760","505100"," Does it mean that the money's going to come into the equity market?"
"505500","507680"," Nobody knows right now and it hasn't come in. "
"507980","509540"," Has it gone into the gold market yet?"
"509860","511179"," Into the Bitcoin market yet?"
"511280","511480"," No."
"511720","512700"," Where was some of it?"
"513059","514240"," It was in metals."
"514640","517780"," It was in commodities like oil and gas. "
"518400","521440"," It was in bonds and bonds just shit the bet."
"522059","527720"," So if that money fights the safety to equities at any moment at any fucking moment, you can see"
"527720","531440"," another rip to all time highs with just that money alone."
"532060","534260"," So that's the stuff that I'm talking about. "
"534300","535980"," Now I'm not saying we're going all time highs."
"536480","537880"," I think we do get a pullback."
"538000","538560"," We trade sideways. "
"539200","540460"," But the key here is this."
"540580","543940"," And I think that the indicators usually tell the truth, especially the one we were looking at"
"543940","545460"," yesterday morning, the main one, right?"
"546580","547440"," Now we'll get the pullback."
"547560","548160"," We'll get all that stuff. "
"548160","553240"," But this whole conversation about a market's going to not just roll over but burn to the depths of"
"553240","553400"," hell."
"553480","554940"," Yeah, that's a possibility too."
"555020","555520"," But you know what?"
"555560","561180"," It's just as much of a possibility as that money leave an oil gas and anything else you can see"
"561180","567260"," out there, Bitcoin or whatever, and dumping itself bonds and dumping itself inside of the stock"
"567260","567600"," market. "
"567920","569740"," And then I went back yesterday and looked at the credit market."
"570680","572960"," And I'm not saying the credit market's telling a different story."
"573100","574080"," The credit market's always right. "
"574580","575340"," The bond market's always right."
"575440","575900"," I'll tell you what?"
"576360","578820"," It's fucking burned from fucking January, right?"
"578900","580300"," December or January until now."
"580940","586060"," And further from that, when I look back in history, I've seen turnarounds in the credit market and"
"586060","587400"," the fucking stock market go up. "
"587640","591800"," So, you know, it's not like it's at the worst fucking possible moment out there."
"591900","594840"," So the key takeaway is this, right?"
"596100","597700"," Someone's going to be wrong at some point."
"598500","602500"," And the best thing to do where we are right now is probably just be cash on the sidelines. "
"603020","607720"," If you're a bull and you're cash on the sidelines, you can get confirmation if we're going up."
"608000","610020"," If you're a bull, you can be cash on the sidelines."
"610300","612820"," We can burn it all down and you can jump back in again, right?"
"613100","617100"," So if anything, you're in the best positioning right now as a bull, especially if you bought that"
"617100","617940"," bottom, right?"
"618720","623120"," If you're a bear, you're kind of fucked or not fucked, but you can get fucked here, right?"
"623480","625800"," Because if we trade sideways enough, you're going to get fucked. "
"626200","628720"," If we trade straight up from here, you're going to get fucked."
"628920","634240"," Your only chance right now as a bear is to hope that this shit not only rolls over."
"634240","637140"," I guess you could make some money in a rollover, right?"
"637320","641540"," We trade sideways and down for a little bit, but your only fucking chance is that it fucking dumps"
"641540","642740"," to the pits of hell. "
"643040","644340"," You've only got three options."
"644700","648000"," As a fucking bull, you got many options at this point, okay?"
"648380","651800"," And the fact is that that money does come back into this market."
"652380","653720"," This market will rip. "
"654000","658780"," This market not only will rip, but it will stay green for anywhere from one to two to three months."
"658780","664960"," We still have another ER cycle coming up where you know that that money can come into the market at"
"664960","665320"," that point."
"665480","670440"," So just be aware of that as you trade forward, be aware of what the context of volume is that's"
"670440","677660"," going on in the back corners of finchwit, of financial circles, and stuff like that, okay?"
"678120","681800"," And then the question still becomes, where are you going to make your money?"
"682840","683860"," How do you beat inflation?"
"685080","686520"," And how do you put some risk on?"
"687000","690940"," If you're out there sitting on bonds and you're losing your fucking ass, I'm not talking about"
"690940","695640"," today, but since January, if you've been losing your ass, you have to put risk on. "
"696380","702260"," It's funny because there are these hedge funds out there that even have baskets of shit stocks"
"702260","706200"," where they end up letting off their shorts and they trade them and rip them up higher."
"706540","711280"," And we've seen that happen multiple times at OPEX, monthly OPEXs and quad whichings."
"711780","713560"," So anyway, my point stands though. "
"714100","717560"," If you're a bull right now, you're sitting better than any fucking bear could."
"717880","720120"," And we all saw the market rollover in January."
"720320","721620"," This wasn't fucking rocket science. "
"722160","723480"," The market rolling over in January."
"724260","725860"," And it didn't take long to get rollover."
"726180","730460"," And if you traded it up and down, you made more than someone that was just short the entire time. "
"730460","734240"," And some of you follow me on fucking Twitter and here on YouTube."
"735000","735960"," And know this."
"736700","738280"," We've had this discussion. "
"738460","739020"," These are my friends."
"739680","743380"," Close your shorts, take your fucking money, and then come back to re-short again."
"744300","744400"," Right?"
"744520","746340"," We've had that conversation many fucking times. "
"746660","748240"," And people get fucking salty about it."
"748620","749780"," But right now, I'm fucking salty."
"750620","754060"," I'm fucking salty because I'm sitting here watching people are saying on Twitter. "
"754060","755380"," And I'm like, get fucked."
"756020","757540"," Get fucking straight fucked."
"758640","759640"," We're here to make money. "
"760580","764260"," You should have made the turn when it is, even if it was days later, you should have made the"
"764260","764500"," turn."
"764940","769320"," And even now, as a bull, you're in better position, in a better position, than you could ever be"
"769320","771300"," being upside down as a bear right now."
"771900","772720"," Trying to time a top. "
"773320","774780"," Right here, right now, trying to time a top."
"775320","780640"," Your risk of this being a top is higher than a bull just sitting out for the next week or"
"780640","780840"," two."
"780840","782940"," And seeing where this market goes. "
"783200","784720"," Taking your money as a bull off the table."
"785140","787360"," Waiting for confirmation that we're going sideways and up."
"787600","789860"," Even a small pullback and then up again, resuming up. "
"790600","791660"," You have two options."
"792380","798140"," And your third option, if the market does trade sideways or roll over, is you're still sitting on"
"798140","799380"," cash to buy the next bottom."
"799820","805420"," So as a bull, you're still better off today than you ever would fucking be as a fucking permabear. "
"805840","809020"," And I guess I don't talk about that too often, but I'm going to talk about it this morning."
"810280","812660"," I'm not mad, but you know, I'm on fire this morning."
"812660","813180"," It's Friday. "
"814760","816000"," So we're going to go back to the spot."
"816200","817100"," Gamma report over here."
"820510","821810"," Can't make that turn shit. "
"821950","823650"," You can only turn your head fucking left once."
"824070","824910"," Can't turn right."
"825470","826810"," We trade up and down here. "
"827250","828250"," We're not just a bull."
"828370","829090"," We're not just a bear."
"829210","832290"," If you had to be one of two of them, you should be a fucking bull. "
"832290","838310"," Even if you have to manage your accounts actively, you should be a bull still 70% of the time."
"838870","839390"," Historically."
"840330","841830"," See, now you know I'm a bull. "
"845630","847850"," Anyways, so that's my point here."
"847970","848130"," Okay."
"848710","850450"," So there is some risk coming on to the market. "
"850450","853090"," Okay, speculative risk appetite."
"853490","856270"," That ain't FOMO, just large speculative risk appetite."
"856270","860470"," Furthermore, one other thing that isn't pointed out in here this morning is that we talked about"
"860470","860810"," all week. "
"860930","862190"," There's a bid in SPX."
"862290","863370"," There's a bid in SPX."
"863650","864410"," Fuck the spy. "
"864730","865530"," Look at SPX."
"865850","868530"," Look, they're trying to pin SPX into this close."
"869110","874450"," You know, the weird thing is SPX and spy and ES are really, there's a real divergence right now. "
"874550","877130"," And if you pay attention right now to SPX, don't trade it."
"877170","878250"," Just pay attention to it."
"878250","878970"," Chart it. "
"879150","883570"," There's a different story being told that they do talk about it in a spy camera this morning."
"883890","886370"," There's a different top in SPX than there is in spy."
"886770","887490"," Do you know why?"
"888190","891050"," Because there's a fucking bid in SPX by banks. "
"891750","893290"," So anyway, we're going to talk about this this morning."
"893350","894710"," We're going to get into it over here."
"895470","898090"," There's still certainly geopolitical geopolitical risk. "
"898430","901890"," We think that leads to traders still wanting to hold some longer dated volatility."
"902450","904330"," Therefore, the steep contango likely remains."
"905250","908490"," However, the demand to sell this week's options was strong and supports markets. "
"909230","912170"," We also saw call open interest in the S&P 500 coming in."
"913130","917830"," The 4,500 to 4,550 range indicating this area just north of 4,500 is now where the options"
"917830","918830"," fair value point is."
"919090","923130"," This syncs with our value models too, which are now neutral compared to a few days ago. "
"924370","929690"," It's also of note that while the call wall strike for spy holds it for 50, the call wall for"
"929690","932330"," SPX is up at 4,600."
"932590","935530"," 4,600 is the strike with the largest call interest."
"936270","938390"," You've seen the SPX calls come in on flow. "
"938530","939750"," I'll go all week long, right?"
"940010","940410"," Not on the spot."
"940890","941690"," Start a little bit of the spot."
"941870","943190"," A million dollars here, a million dollars there. "
"943490","944570"," Where did you see the bid come in?"
"945150","945550"," SPX."
"946300","948230"," The market was greater than 4,600."
"948230","955270"," We classified as overbought, but current SPX prices seems to coincide with fair value idea above. "
"955750","960770"," So while we still see the air pocket down below 4,500, this appears to be a rally through"
"960770","966170"," attrition, declining vol in passing time as time passes."
"966930","971210"," Now, this leads me into the next part of what I posted on Twitter, which was that sideways trade,"
"971470","971510"," right?"
"972210","973970"," You're going to end up seeing OPEC come in."
"974070","976430"," I'm going to scroll through this nice and slow so you guys have all your levels for you. "
"976790","978070"," Always come back and get this stuff."
"979350","983650"," And the point that I was trying to make to you was that you've got to paint into this weekend,"
"983650","986850"," but furthermore, no one's talking about this on Twitter either."
"986850","988130"," You've got an OPEC today. "
"989910","992070"," You've got two days off."
"992330","993750"," You've got another fucking OPEC's on Monday."
"994390","999570"," You've got the next OPEC's on Wednesday, but then you've got an OPEC's on Thursday for the spy. "
"999570","1005010"," And on Friday for the spy, and you've got an OPEC's on Monday and two more days off."
"1006370","1013930"," Any of you out there that have traded, whenever you've seen a wonky day off or a wonky long"
"1013930","1023730"," weekends, or you've seen wonky weekends or end of months when you get that"
"1023730","1030270"," extra OPEC or the extra daily OPEC's on the spy, it can get wild in the day trade, but you"
"1030270","1033530"," often don't see huge moves in those OPEC states."
"1033950","1035329"," Sometimes, but not often. "
"1035550","1040230"," Sometimes you see that pin just hold right throughout all of those OPEC's."
"1040450","1043790"," It's kind of like, thanks for fucking playing for the last three months."
"1044670","1045950"," And don't fuck around now. "
"1046050","1047190"," We're going to take our money and run."
"1048010","1049770"," So just think about that."
"1049890","1054190"," Think about the fact that some stocks have been beaten down for 15 fucking months. "
"1055390","1061970"," Now I'm not a bag holder of fucking SQ or any of these other shit companies, but considered shit"
"1061970","1063870"," stonks, but some of you out there were."
"1064630","1067170"," And I know some of you out there are fucking salty about it."
"1067630","1073650"," And so when you think about 15 months of a down market for your favorite stock, that's got to suck. "
"1074150","1080290"," When you've got another three months down on indexes and some other stocks out there, it's got to"
"1080290","1080590"," suck."
"1081550","1086610"," And so when someone's out there on Twitter telling you, well, fucking, it's going to fucking burn"
"1086610","1088790"," this weekend today on fucking Friday."
"1090310","1094070"," Maybe, maybe the market will crash today, but I'm fucking finding it hard to believe. "
"1094570","1096090"," It's not fucking adding up to today."
"1096450","1098130"," And let's say it does fucking burn today."
"1098610","1099090"," So what do I do?"
"1099370","1104590"," Put my cash on the sidelines for one day, come back to you on Monday and say, what the fuck?"
"1105690","1106730"," One fucking day. "
"1106790","1109290"," That's what's happening because the VIX is down at 2149."
"1110110","1111770"," What's it going to fucking 50 today?"
"1111950","1112150"," Maybe."
"1112410","1112810"," I don't know. "
"1113130","1113630"," No one knows."
"1113870","1114150"," I don't know."
"1114250","1114650"," You don't know. "
"1115150","1121550"," You're talking about an event that even if it happens, you're probably better off today as a bull."
"1121890","1125430"," You just keep yourself on the sidelines and cash unless you're trading something tricky."
"1126470","1129670"," My point to you is even if it rolls over, it doesn't matter. "
"1129710","1132350"," You just stay a bull on the cash on the sidelines."
"1132350","1136650"," If you're a bull, I'm going to tell you, we're either going to trade sideways, right?"
"1137030","1140370"," Or we're going to trade up and confirm a further leg up, right?"
"1140510","1142970"," Let's say to $4.58 or $4.60, right?"
"1143110","1147470"," Some acceptance into that range of $4.50 or $4.60, right?"
"1147610","1150130"," Or we're going to get a small pullback, which is good for you as a bull, right?"
"1150350","1153230"," Every bull wants to buy a fucking pullback if they can."
"1154330","1155490"," And let's just say it burns. "
"1156470","1159350"," If you're cash on the sidelines, you just called out your profit, right?"
"1159950","1163530"," You just took profit on this market and you're either going to get one of three chances."
"1164130","1170170"," You're either going to get a chance to buy a huge dip down at $400, let's say, right?"
"1170970","1172710"," You're going to be able to buy a pullback."
"1172890","1175490"," Let's say it's at $4.40 or $4.30, right?"
"1175910","1176230"," Awesome sauce. "
"1176950","1178530"," You get even better positioning, right?"
"1179210","1189330"," Or you missed this one quick little acceptance into $4.50, $4.60, right?"
"1189850","1192690"," And then it resumes its leg up to $4.60, sweet."
"1193010","1196450"," You've had no risk on the table and you get to take the next hundred points up."
"1197490","1202010"," You get to do it again from $4.60 to $4.70, $4.70 to $4.80, or even if"
"1202010","1205670"," it rolls over at $4.60 or $4.80, it comes down into the 200 points. "
"1205790","1206490"," What do you fucking care?"
"1207070","1209770"," You know that you have to actively manage a portfolio right now."
"1210090","1215790"," You know that the government or the Fed is not treating this market like it's on steroids anymore,"
"1216030","1216990"," like it was the last two years."
"1217350","1220170"," You know, so you already know you have to manage your account. "
"1223360","1224780"," That's all I got on Spark in this morning."
"1225400","1228280"," I think that's all I got for you when it comes to the rage, right?"
"1229620","1231560"," So let's take a look at the charts today."
"1232480","1234000"," And let's look at some overall, okay?"
"1235220","1236880"," Let's look at the regime overall. "
"1238840","1239740"," We're going to get the spy."
"1239920","1241400"," We're going to give a quick outlook on the spy."
"1243060","1245280"," We're probably going on the three month chart over here, right?"
"1246740","1248700"," We know we get the big bad ugly over here. "
"1249240","1251820"," It was back on, it was 1231, 1, 4."
"1251980","1253840"," I think it was January 4th, right?"
"1254280","1255380"," Big roll over boom."
"1256060","1257780"," I actually made money on both of these trades."
"1258000","1258820"," I remember doing this with Joe. "
"1258960","1260380"," I think Joe Donut and I traded this together."
"1260780","1262940"," This whole thing down Joe Donut and I traded down."
"1264400","1267360"," I think Chase has been here for this whole trip, right?"
"1267500","1271660"," I think Chase has been around shortening this market down with us as well since the beginning. "
"1273060","1274280"," So not a big deal."
"1274400","1275900"," Everybody kind of fucking knew this was happening."
"1276180","1276860"," It doesn't matter. "
"1277040","1277380"," But whatever."
"1277760","1279320"," So we're trading this over and over, right?"
"1279400","1280140"," We're starting to come up now."
"1280600","1284860"," We're in this other area up here of resistance here, right?"
"1285780","1289420"," Where you think to yourself, yeah, this is another place where the market can roll over. "
"1289720","1293140"," This is another place where you can take profit here."
"1293700","1297660"," You can wait for the market to digest where we are."
"1322930","1324910"," You've got this zone here, right?"
"1325490","1327270"," We know that support is 450 now. "
"1327570","1329610"," We talked about them pushing it up and over."
"1330090","1333230"," Like yesterday we said it's good to go to 451 of the clothes, right?"
"1333510","1333770"," It did."
"1334350","1335850"," I think it was at 420 or something. "
"1336050","1337710"," It went up to 450, 79."
"1346710","1347150"," Right?"
"1347390","1349370"," And then we pushed it up in the overnight, right?"
"1349570","1351170"," It pushed it up in Globex last night."
"1351170","1353610"," If the banks were going to sell it down. "
"1375370","1380910"," See how the University of Michigan confidence 59.4 versus the 59.7 expected."
"1389750","1391970"," I'll bring this up for you so you can take a look at it."
"1392870","1395970"," This is the University of Michigan. "
"1396910","1403530"," So you can see these numbers here before they get on the Internet."
"1404750","1409430"," University of Michigan confidence score 59.4 versus 59.7 expected."
"1411760","1416240"," One year inflation expectations, 5.4 versus 5.4 expected. "
"1417560","1420540"," These are pretty much in line on the University of Michigan confidence."
"1420540","1430530"," Pending home sales minus 4.1% versus 1% expected year over"
"1430530","1436070"," year minus 5.5% versus minus 2.2% expected."
"1437290","1442110"," So there's a disparity there on the pending home sales. "
"1442630","1447030"," This impacts the Euro USD spy TLT XLF."
"1447750","1449890"," The main ones that we've got the shy over there."
"1453760","1455140"," Now, so we're rolling over here. "
"1455220","1456560"," We talked about yesterday into the close."
"1456760","1458080"," We said they're going to try to push it up."
"1458480","1461160"," It's common for them to push it up or down in the overnight. "
"1461560","1466620"," It's a low liquidity environment had the banks wanted to sell this market down."
"1467100","1471740"," The perfect opportunity to sell it down would have been last night, right?"
"1472260","1476940"," If they were positioned for the market to sell off in the overnight, they would have sold it off in"
"1476940","1477240"," the overnight."
"1477240","1483340"," So the key is that they pushed it up and they raised it up here into the cash market here. "
"1483620","1485460"," So there was no huge sell off."
"1485720","1486680"," That's your first indicator."
"1487300","1491220"," If they were going to sell this market, red, big, giant red bars crash the market. "
"1491440","1495280"," Your first indicator would have been they would have done it last night."
"1495820","1497420"," Just be conscious of that."
"1498220","1499960"," That would have happened last night. "
"1500380","1501860"," We're talking like, you know what I'm talking about, right?"
"1502040","1505120"," The market crash scenario would have been last night."
"1505120","1506340"," It would have crashed to the depths of hell."
"1506560","1508300"," It could be at like 4,000 today. "
"1509640","1510860"," So can we get some weakness?"
"1511460","1511640"," Yes."
"1512340","1514360"," Yesterday we talked about, can we trade below 450?"
"1515120","1515480"," Yes."
"1516020","1517200"," They're just going to put it up there. "
"1517340","1519060"," Make sure it doesn't get sold to the pits of hell."
"1519860","1525080"," For it to get, if we have a trading range, let's say of 450 to 460 at this point, then"
"1525080","1530100"," what you're going to, just like every other trading range, you're going to be looking for every"
"1530100","1531040"," other trading range, right?"
"1531140","1531800"," You got a line here."
"1532120","1533360"," You got another line here. "
"1533360","1535440"," And let's say you're trading within this range."
"1536420","1539280"," You're looking to short anything up here down, right?"
"1539420","1543300"," And you're looking to buy anything outside of that range up until there's consolidation."
"1543480","1547560"," We choose a direction, either down or we choose a direction, either up and out of that current"
"1547560","1548320"," trading range. "
"1548620","1548920"," Okay."
"1549440","1550580"," So we're at 450 now."
"1551480","1553100"," Expect us to trade sideways. "
"1553740","1559480"," Expect us to trade sideways from now into next, I believe, I think right now that some big changes"
"1559480","1567740"," that we'll see that into next week at some point, into the 31st, which has, which, which coincides"
"1567740","1568360"," with."
"1586210","1589740"," So what we could do is this."
"1589860","1591000"," We can actually change this here. "
"1591600","1598920"," We've got our current put 460 up here."
"1598920","1600800"," I don't think we get to 460 right now."
"1600800","1601800"," Let's get some call expansion. "
"1603460","1605360"," But I think this is the potential, right?"
"1605480","1606860"," We're trying to get into that range."
"1609960","1611500"," Make that a big fat one up there."
"1612380","1613500"," Currently trading down it. "
"1613700","1618880"," We know that 449, 450, excuse me, is support."
"1620340","1629980"," We know that R1 right now, the resistance is to make this R1."
"1639970","1641290"," Put this up here. "
"1644990","1646830"," We know S1 down here."
"1660740","1661880"," It's down here, right?"
"1663020","1664820"," And where can we trade down from here?"
"1664940","1665600"," I guess this is the big question."
"1665820","1669240"," I think we can easily trade down to, we'll take a look at spot spot camera right now. "
"1669240","1672100"," We'll see how low we can trade if you're bearish out there."
"1672100","1674560"," Let's take a look and see where we can trade."
"1675540","1677780"," Where there's some support, if there's any support. "
"1678700","1680540"," We'll take a peak here and see."
"1683060","1685120"," Looks like there's some support down to 447."
"1686780","1691640"," Then we get some support at 446, but major support, 445, right?"
"1695270","1696990"," Nice volatility down here. "
"1697170","1701710"," Nice volatility band down at the 441 area."
"1701710","1704390"," But then some decent support down here at 4400."
"1704710","1706170"," Just the normal supports. "
"1706590","1709470"," See another dip buy down here at 438."
"1709710","1710630"," Mark this one actually."
"1711090","1715310"," So I would say your lowest dip that you should be buying would be 438. "
"1715790","1720830"," So from where we are right now, if we don't sell the entire market, doom and gloom down to 4 "
"1720830","1722810",",000 at this moment, right?"
"1723050","1725190"," Now I'm open to us selling this market down."
"1726010","1729090"," I want to want you to think that I'm uber bullish in the market right now either."
"1729750","1731650"," But we have to leg it down, right?"
"1732170","1734370"," And we need to get below a certain number. "
"1734750","1736530"," We know that number is somewhere around 435."
"1737830","1738470"," Excuse me, 4."
"1747370","1751190"," So for us to get really nasty bearish here, we need to trade below."
"1751630","1758210"," I know that 453 is the quarter, but 435 is the magic number for you bears out there. "
"1758210","1763470"," If you want to see us trade down 390, 360, 370, 380, we need to trade down there."
"1764030","1768150"," So you can't get super uber duer bearish until we trade down a 435 break below it."
"1768430","1769610"," 453 is bad too. "
"1770250","1774370"," They'll take us to 435 and the 435 actually takes you down even lower."
"1775230","1776730"," So just be conscious of that."
"1776830","1777450"," Be aware of that. "
"1777550","1778430"," This is getting into the end of the month."
"1778830","1781550"," Sending into March 31st."
"1782110","1783990"," Now, but look at this 438 as a dip buy. "
"1784430","1785830"," So keep your eyes on 438."
"1787110","1790830"," Now you can buy that as a dip heading up into end of month."
"1791650","1797610"," I think the, I think the three red quarters is 435, 60 or something, 435, 58 or something. "
"1798130","1799770"," And the bad quarter over all."
"1800030","1801250"," They believe it's 453."
"1802370","1804370"," So just be conscious of that heading into the month. "
"1804670","1808310"," Be conscious of what to the banks want heading into the end of the month."
"1808550","1809990"," How risky are they willing to take it?"
"1810130","1811390"," Do they think about it right now?"
"1811450","1812010"," You got a week left."
"1813150","1814770"," You got a shit ton of opaxes coming up. "
"1815330","1819190"," Are they going to try to dump it down to 435 for end of the month and then try to"
"1819190","1821970"," fight their way back over these everyday opaxes?"
"1822370","1823830"," I don't know to get up to 443."
"1824250","1824510"," Maybe."
"1824950","1831610"," Are you saying that they want to dump it to 435 or 400453 by the 31st to set up the"
"1831610","1832030"," bad quarter?"
"1832350","1837330"," If anything, I would think that they would, that they would close the month or the quarter green. "
"1838370","1841410"," Like window dressing tell their tell people, you know, these days they sell."
"1841970","1846410"," They sell investments to, you know, Joe Schmoe on the street, right?"
"1846770","1849430"," And assumption is that they're going to try to close the quarter green."
"1849690","1851450"," And I wouldn't be surprised if they dumped it after. "
"1851810","1853330"," That wouldn't shock me to see it get dumped."
"1853850","1856250"," Maybe a trip down to 435 out to the 31st."
"1856750","1858130"," I see a nice dump below. "
"1858630","1861210"," We trade sideways maybe for a couple months or a month."
"1861590","1863810"," Maybe they trap longs into the ER season."
"1864330","1868150"," So you just keep buying and buying and buying and hoping again that there's going to be a good ER"
"1868150","1868510"," report. "
"1868550","1869050"," That's possible."
"1869050","1872170"," But I doubt right now heading into a doubt."
"1872470","1873630"," I'm not saying it can't happen. "
"1873670","1878650"," I'm just saying that my bias is switching to a doubt that they fucking, that they fucking crash the"
"1878650","1885710"," market one week before the fucking before the fucking the quarterly expo."
"1885850","1890470"," And if they do dump it one week before the quarterly expo, trust me, you're going to see a"
"1890470","1891630"," waterfall of put."
"1891630","1895790"," You're going to see 10, 20, 30 million dollars in spy puts rolling the front door. "
"1895890","1901550"," When you see that happen, if you see that happen today to next Friday, I will entertain us rolling"
"1901550","1902290"," the market over."
"1902890","1908970"," If you see real money selling, if you see right now, you get 591,000 shares traded right now,"
"1909050","1909190"," right?"
"1909610","1914050"," If you see, I don't know, 135 million shares trading right now."
"1914190","1916930"," Yeah, I'll entertain that thought process, but we're not there right now. "
"1917550","1919130"," Okay, we're not there right now."
"1919670","1924030"," Where we are right now is looking for some acceptance between 450 and 460."
"1924850","1925710"," That's where we are. "
"1926110","1928910"," Can we trade outside of that 450 and trade lower?"
"1929290","1930530"," Yes, we always know that."
"1931310","1932790"," We'll see if we're accepted here."
"1933450","1936490"," We'll see if we trade sideways the next few days or then to the next week. "
"1937350","1939930"," That would be my expectation is that we trade."
"1939950","1940570"," We can trade low."
"1940690","1941350"," We can trade out of 440. "
"1942370","1947430"," We can dip down briefly to 438 and it's still intact trading in 450 to 460."
"1948370","1948790"," Okay."
"1948790","1950850"," So you're looking for a break below 435. "
"1951950","1960290"," You're looking for a close below 443 heading into 31st and then even a pin down below 435 heading"
"1960290","1961170"," into the end of the month."
"1961750","1963250"," Now, sometimes I'll give it to the 1st."
"1963670","1969630"," I've seen that wonky shit too in the past where they'll give us the bad month and then the 1st,"
"1969730","1970190"," it comes back. "
"1970710","1974870"," And I've always seen it on the other side too, where they raised it up last minute to save a"
"1974870","1977550"," month or save a quarter and they dump it right afterwards."
"1978390","1979530"," So anyways, that's where I'm at."
"1981990","1983770"," So I'm looking at this here, right?"
"1984210","1985970"," And we're going to go back to that year chart real quick. "
"1986950","1987670"," Not the year."
"1987750","1989050"," We're going to go to the three month chart here."
"1991470","1993390"," I got that beautiful tag down below here. "
"1993490","1994710"," Still looking at that tag down below."
"1995170","1997710"," But I'm looking for this area right here, this 460, right?"
"1998550","2002190"," This is all you should be worried about right here is we're going to trade this."
"2002190","2006590"," And if you really want to know where the danger is, the real danger to the market, it's up here"
"2006590","2006790"," 460. "
"2007890","2008770"," We all know that, right?"
"2009030","2009710"," Everybody knows this."
"2010030","2015750"," Everybody knows if you look here, right, that this negative channel gets real negative here 460."
"2016790","2023730"," So if we get accepted into 450, trade 450 to 460, take your money and run around 458, let the"
"2023730","2024710"," banks do the work. "
"2025270","2028550"," If we're going to go above 460, right?"
"2028670","2030790"," You don't need, you don't need the entire thing."
"2030790","2032250"," You don't need all of it."
"2032510","2034530"," You don't need the entire trade, right?"
"2035290","2037550"," You don't need all, you don't need the entire trade. "
"2038090","2043010"," You can wait for, you can trade this whole area in here, right?"
"2043370","2044870"," Make a nice big fat bunch of money."
"2045430","2049590"," If it gets above this negative channel here, that part you don't need, right?"
"2049770","2051250"," You can wait for it to rest here."
"2051610","2056330"," And if it doesn't just roll off and start selling down, then you can take this higher. "
"2056810","2058710"," You don't need this entire trade."
"2058710","2060929"," You don't need all this stuff in here."
"2061429","2063210"," You just need to capture this bulk here. "
"2063650","2067170"," You just need to capture this bulk in here, right?"
"2067449","2071610"," If we start trading down here, you don't need to trade the top."
"2071969","2073590"," You don't need the first rollover."
"2073730","2078550"," And even when you do catch the first rollover, right, there's no, there's no IV in that rollover. "
"2078790","2081290"," You're not, you're not actually making any money in that rollover."
"2081630","2083770"," Where the money comes in is when it's rejected."
"2083770","2090370"," If it's begins to roll over here, the first punch back higher and then rejection lower, this is"
"2090370","2093670"," where the money is, if you want to know in here, okay?"
"2093969","2097310"," Not in this first market rollover moment. "
"2097790","2102450"," And you already know that if we sell off, that the biggest moves are at the end, right?"
"2102630","2104170"," The capitulation moves are at the end."
"2104390","2105330"," Who's learning that right now?"
"2105930","2107330"," The bears are learning that right now, right?"
"2107510","2108510"," They forget that."
"2108510","2114450"," The last part of that move is usually the most destructive to your positioning, right?"
"2114770","2115970"," We already know that right now. "
"2116490","2119230"," So just keep be aware of where we are in the market right now."
"2120030","2121990"," Be aware we're headed in the market."
"2122350","2126270"," Be aware that we can trade this up higher. "
"2127190","2128930"," We can, we can roll this over here."
"2129310","2132530"," Be aware that we can still roll this over here and still be bullish."
"2133230","2137010"," We can get up in here, get some rejection, trade it down, bounce around, right?"
"2137010","2139230"," We can even bounce down here, believe it or not. "
"2140050","2141410"," Fight our way back up."
"2160850","2164670"," Get that close for the great quarter."
"2164670","2166690"," This is like the most horrible part of it, right?"
"2167230","2168950"," And then they start to self down again on you. "
"2169230","2169990"," And we're right up here."
"2170190","2174850"," Notice how that red line starts to come down even farther and farther, right?"
"2175310","2181770"," You've got that red line coinciding here in the 31st and the 1st, right around, we're at what, 450,"
"2182530","2185250"," what is that, 458 or so, right?"
"2186090","2188350"," Coinciding with end of the month over here."
"2188970","2190690"," So just be conscious of this as well. "
"2190690","2195990"," So what are some trading strategies that you can do to make money from now into the 1st?"
"2196570","2201930"," And I talked about one yesterday and that would be some kind of an iron condor, right?"
"2202050","2207330"," A wide iron condor where you can capture a move like this, right, where it doesn't matter where it"
"2207330","2208070"," trades in here."
"2209030","2213870"," If it starts to break out of where you think it's trading, you can always close legs on your trade,"
"2213870","2214190"," right?"
"2214770","2217190"," And then continue to make money on the way down."
"2217770","2220350"," Same thing goes in the way up here, right?"
"2220350","2223990"," But if it's implied that we have low volatility and then we're going to be range bound in here. "
"2224790","2227730"," Condors work very well, even better than butterflies at some extent."
"2229570","2234010"," And for this area, or if you like, hey, cap, I'm just a long stock, right?"
"2234550","2238230"," Take the money or set yourself a level, right?"
"2238530","2240030"," Let's set it right here."
"2240190","2243610"," If you're along this market since the bottom, just say, I'll pull the plug down here. "
"2245230","2245630"," Right?"
"2246190","2246790"," That's all you have to do."
"2246890","2248750"," You didn't have to capture all of it, right?"
"2248750","2250470"," Just take your money and wait until we trade below."
"2250810","2255630"," If you're trading as an options trader, you want to trade options?"
"2256050","2256410"," Just know. "
"2263530","2265370"," Just know that in here, right?"
"2278020","2284300"," If you're a bull, and if this is going to be the expected trading range, just be patient and wait"
"2284300","2286140"," for a break below our trading range."
"2286320","2288700"," You buy those dips down here, right?"
"2288880","2291280"," So you can push it back up, right?"
"2291480","2294260"," And get back into this trading range until we actually go higher."
"2294260","2298520"," I want you to also note, $4.53 over here is on the first, okay?"
"2298580","2303720"," So your price target, all they needed to be at is right here and a month. "
"2303960","2306380"," That's all they needed to be, okay?"
"2307480","2310380"," I don't think if they get it down here, they'll ever come back to save the month."
"2311040","2314100"," So I don't think we're going to get it below this zone down here."
"2314500","2316560"," I think you might get some weakness in the next few days. "
"2316880","2322380"," But even if you did, as long as you're buying dips down here, you should be safe into end of"
"2322380","2322540"," month."
"2329400","2330640"," Is that clear enough?"
"2331080","2333120"," I hope it is."
"2333220","2334380"," I haven't checked any of your comments yet. "
"2334780","2336100"," So that's the key for you."
"2336580","2340560"," Those are the keys for you heading into this week."
"2341100","2351540"," Now, if you're bearish, if you're bearish and you want to take a bearish position, right?"
"2352660","2357440"," You're not looking for $45,000 in spy puts that just came out. "
"2358080","2364640"," You're not looking for $20,000 in spy puts that came out, expiring tomorrow or today, excuse me."
"2365140","2370400"," You're looking for spy puts that are rolling in on top of the hedges that are already out there."
"2370500","2375160"," We already know those hedges out there, but you're looking for some rolling pushing into, you're"
"2375160","2376240"," looking for real money selling. "
"2377480","2382980"," You're looking for breaks below 450, and you have to be measured in how long you're short."
"2384440","2392200"," Know your levels, have your levels out there, 448, we know about 438, 445, and 440, right?"
"2392360","2393100"," We know about our levels."
"2393500","2394940"," So take it between the levels all the way down. "
"2395800","2397940"," But don't get crazy bearish until you get confirmation."
"2399320","2403440"," Okay, and be aware of what's above into the end of the month here for the market."
"2403440","2406640"," Okay, so it starts to roll over. "
"2406760","2407580"," We'll roll it over together."
"2407760","2411100"," We'll take some shorts and some puts together, but I want to see some things."
"2411400","2413820"," Like if I'm going to take a put here, where am I going to take a put?"
"2415360","2415680"," Right?"
"2415920","2416920"," I'll show you where I'm going to take a put, right?"
"2417060","2418900"," I'm going to wait until it comes down here, right?"
"2419440","2423240"," You know about this nice little channel that we're in. "
"2429290","2432230"," One, two, then I'm going to take my short, right?"
"2433090","2435490"," That's what I'm looking for, something like this, right?"
"2436030","2436870"," For a short, right?"
"2437090","2438070"," How long do I take my short?"
"2438850","2440330"," Right now, I'd be taking it to 445."
"2441190","2442250"," I'd be looking for 445."
"2443810","2446290"," So a top price target of somewhere down here. "
"2446350","2449950"," If it's today, if you're looking for a short, you don't need this part right here."
"2450370","2452810"," You just need, you just need to see this happen."
"2453390","2456770"," A rejection of shorts and shorts and then we come down here. "
"2457070","2461230"," If you really want to take a short here and you start seeing us dribble down, right?"
"2461230","2462730"," Just slow dribble down."
"2463030","2465550"," Yeah, you can take a, you can probably take a once you break through here."
"2465810","2467210"," You could then take it down here. "
"2467490","2470310"," Once you cross here, this plane, you could take this down here."
"2470930","2475570"," But other than that, if you've made your money this week, today's not a day to trade."
"2476030","2477650"," If you're a bear out there, I promise you, bro. "
"2477890","2479710"," If you're a bear, I don't dislike you."
"2480050","2481850"," I don't want you to lose all your money, okay?"
"2482450","2486150"," And if you could come in here on a Friday, I guess maybe you think, I guess we can get"
"2486150","2486810"," that little VIX."
"2491610","2493690"," I guess that could happen today, that's possible. "
"2494750","2498850"," So maybe we see a trade sideways and do nothing today that eventually rolls over."
"2499010","2500330"," We can trade that today if you want to."
"2500830","2504930"," I don't mind taking that trade lower if it starts to roll over and people take money off the table"
"2504930","2505590"," as the end of the weekend. "
"2506230","2507310"," I don't mind that trade either."
"2507890","2512630"," But to be listening to people out there on Twitter telling you that the market's going to fucking"
"2512630","2514130"," crash today, I'm sorry, it ain't happening."
"2514570","2515630"," It ain't fucking happening today. "
"2516070","2517430"," It ain't happening in one fucking day."
"2517430","2520270"," And if it's going to fucking happen, we'll roll it over together."
"2521250","2522670"," So be safe out there. "
"2523250","2524070"," Don't get too crazy."
"2524550","2525090"," Don't get too wild."
"2525290","2526550"," Don't sit on Twitter all weekend long. "
"2527090","2529750"," And listen to these fucking guys out there talking about the crazy down."
"2529990","2531670"," Because the crazy down started early this week."
"2532010","2536070"," Matter of fact, it started like a week ago and it's gotten more fucking crazy as the week has moved"
"2536070","2536430"," forward. "
"2537230","2539950"," It's gotten crazier and crazier and crazier."
"2540370","2543650"," And I normally don't say anything about it, but right fucking now I have to say something about it"
"2543650","2545990"," because it got that fucking crazy."
"2546830","2547710"," It really did. "
"2548130","2549130"," And nothing's showing it, right?"
"2549510","2550330"," We've got some showing."
"2550430","2551970"," We have a rollover showing in the market."
"2552250","2553870"," We've got overbought showing in the market. "
"2554490","2558350"," But we already know that this market can trade sideways, that we already know it can melt up."
"2558610","2560870"," We already know there's a bunch of money not in the market."
"2561230","2562630"," We already know that inflation is high. "
"2564750","2567110"," I know that the VIX is saying it's going to turn around."
"2583270","2588010"," Come back into resistance again, checking again at 451.94. We'll see if it gets rejected."
"2588070","2590110"," We can turn it around for the bears here. "
"2591770","2593870"," You know, who we can do under the crazy thing?"
"2593950","2595010"," You guys know when we're in a bull regime?"
"2595470","2597870"," You know, we are in positive gamma right now, right?"
"2598450","2602470"," Even if we trade downward positive gamma, we're above negative gamma right now."
"2602890","2605170"," We're not in positive gamma yet."
"2605350","2606550"," Not until we break past that 460. "
"2607090","2609650"," But we are outside of major volatility ranges right now."
"2610110","2618350"," So the thought process here would be the thought process here would be, we're down at 21."
"2618710","2619270"," We're in the VIX here. "
"2619530","2620710"," What about the VIX, bro?"
"2620870","2622070"," You've got to be gutted to the VIX, bro."
"2622550","2623330"," I agree with that."
"2623930","2626330"," But what if the VIX spikes into close today?"
"2626970","2630870"," What if we spike the VIX the last couple hours of the trade and day, right?"
"2630870","2633650"," And let's say we're down on Monday, right?"
"2633890","2635070"," And the VIX goes all at the 30. "
"2636290","2640370"," And we still have the 31st on Friday of next week, and we're up at 30."
"2640730","2645370"," We can easily get 460 by Friday, believe it or not, with the VIX of 30."
"2646290","2652790"," So if that fits your blueprint that we sell off into the day today, we have a down day and"
"2652790","2657230"," Monday, that makes kind of sense to me that we could sell off into the close on Friday that we"
"2657230","2659390"," could have a down day on Monday. "
"2660030","2661370"," It leaves a nice breathing room."
"2661550","2662350"," We could trade down to 440."
"2662810","2665010"," We could trade down by Monday, 440, 438. "
"2665270","2669330"," But we still haven't become bearish yet in any context of it either."
"2669930","2675230"," And it leaves you plenty of room on, we're getting a rejection right now on the Lord, actually not."
"2675510","2678230"," We still have the here indicator still positive right now at the moment. "
"2680330","2682290"," Bear is still getting squeezed at the moment."
"2683650","2685830"," When do you have the time to roll over in the market?"
"2686110","2688870"," That wasn't it, was it the yesterday at the close?"
"2689150","2689210"," No."
"2690090","2690350"," Was it overnight?"
"2690790","2691010"," No. "
"2691550","2692010"," Was it off the bell?"
"2692430","2692590"," No."
"2696230","2697830"," Here we go, blasting off."
"2700350","2700710"," Right. "
"2700910","2702490"," So when do you time the roll over in the market?"
"2702830","2704210"," Probably not right fucking now."
"2705250","2708490"," If you want to time a roll over in the market, maybe it's towards close today."
"2709690","2710770"," You know how that goes, right?"
"2710770","2711870"," You guys ever check Fridays, right?"
"2711990","2716530"," You see the VIX just fucking spiked all time fucking all time fucking highs in a Friday of an OpEx?"
"2717230","2719890"," Or even just a regular Friday weekly, not even a monthly, right?"
"2723210","2725310"," And then you have one bad day on a Monday. "
"2725590","2726190"," That works for me."
"2726890","2728650"," That makes sense, right, if we're going to be up here."
"2729070","2732050"," Why the fuck did we trade all the way up here if there's not a bid in the market?"
"2732210","2732870"," My next question. "
"2733590","2734510"," Even if we roll over here."
"2735210","2735510"," Why?"
"2736050","2736470"," I want to know."
"2737070","2737630"," I want answers. "
"2737630","2741570"," I want answers why we traded here."
"2742210","2744090"," We're not even at 460 yet."
"2745610","2746590"," Volatility today. "
"2746690","2747490"," I'll let the 454."
"2750590","2750910"," 454."
"2751890","2751910"," 454. "
"2752210","2752350"," 455."
"2752650","2754610"," Volatility straight up to 455."
"2755890","2759100"," I feel like them apples. "
"2764240","2764860"," Clairs blast."
"2768980","2770400"," You guys can't hear Trade the News."
"2771180","2772660"," We check out Trade the News here. "
"2773000","2775160"," Holy shit, you guys haven't been listening to any Trade the News, have you?"
"2775440","2776340"," Sorry, I apologize for that."
"2776700","2778060"," The desktop audio was down."
"2778720","2779300"," Let's back up again. "
"2780180","2781640"," Let me bring over Trade the News for you real quick."

"2799040","2801140"," Economic implications of code fall out of the corner highly uncertain. "
"2801680","2802480"," We know all this, right?"
"2802800","2805060"," Nothing down here is anything we don't know right now."
"2808010","2808930"," This is actually bullish."
"2810470","2814110"," Medium and longer run inflation expectations of state remarkably stable. "
"2815870","2817450"," You can see that down below here."
"2821020","2828490"," Financial markets have adjusted expectations with minimal disruption, right?"
"2828610","2829110"," We've priced then."
"2829210","2831910"," We're now trading at 452.48 on the market. "
"2833850","2835870"," I just turned the volume up on Trade the News."
"2836010","2836430"," I apologize."
"2836670","2838450"," My voice has just been going fucking nuts. "
"2839190","2841610"," I apologize to all of you out there."
"2844890","2846290"," You're getting squeezed this morning."
"2847210","2848510"," You guys got a list, right?"
"2850810","2853550"," I know you got a list of people out there that are getting squeezed this morning. "
"2854250","2857710"," I know that people on Twitter right now are punching fucking air right now."
"2858330","2861290"," I know they're punching fucking air right now."
"2869850","2870750"," Punching air, right?"
"2877430","2878670"," We'll get Tesla real quick. "
"2878670","2885910"," The Brazil's underback governor is saying that Brazil's key rate will most likely be at 12.75%."
"2887050","2888550"," This doesn't take into consideration."
"2888870","2897870"," This month the current rate at 11.75%. So for season another underbased points higher for Brazil."
"2898730","2900110"," Vic's trading down to 2126. "
"2902570","2906570"," We also know that we've got the, we also know that we've got the VIC or you've got the OPEC's"
"2906570","2907710"," coming out of the way, right?"
"2907710","2910050"," We've got FMC out of the way."
"2910150","2912810"," We've got no FMC for until May, I believe."
"2913650","2915770"," So we're looking at headline news right now. "
"2916050","2920610"," Maybe 50 BPS rate hike that's not exactly priced in at the moment."
"2921390","2922790"," But we can deal with that next month."
"2922910","2923830"," We don't have to deal with that now. "
"2924210","2925690"," We have another ER season coming up."
"2927030","2933730"," So if they want to leg it down one more time, it's an interesting note, right, that it's an"
"2933730","2941610"," interesting note that was made here by one of the little Fed presidents, Williams, who's a voter."
"2944090","2947510"," Says that inflation is at the forefront of the Fed thinking. "
"2948850","2952350"," Medium and longer run inflation expectations of state remarkably stable."
"2952950","2957170"," And the key is financial markets have adjusted expectations with minimal disruptions."
"2957930","2959650"," So do I think the market can crash?"
"2960230","2965810"," Do I think that will hit a inflation, or not inflation, but a recession?"
"2966190","2966410"," Sure. "
"2966410","2969910"," Do I think the Fed's going to try to manage when it comes?"
"2970370","2970530"," Yes."
"2970910","2973370"," Do I think the Fed's going to try to stop a market crash?"
"2973770","2974170"," Yes."
"2974750","2977090"," Do I think that they have the ability to?"
"2977390","2978010"," I'm not sure. "
"2978330","2978990"," Do will they try?"
"2979130","2979530"," Yes."
"2980210","2981090"," So what do they do?"
"2981410","2985690"," Do they try to massage the markets into a good quarter, and then they dump it down to 400 for"
"2985690","2990190"," the next quarter, but then bring it all the way back before the end of that quarter, right?"
"2990270","2993350"," So they throw in the 50 BPS for the next quarter."
"2993570","2994850"," They try to manage it. "
"2994850","2999770"," I'm not saying it's going to bread not break at some point, but they're actively trying right now."
"3000010","3003270"," And they're actively paying attention right now to where our market is."
"3003430","3009430"," So there's a fair chance they're going to try to more than likely try to get a clean green quarter. "
"3009830","3015730"," I wouldn't shock me to see us trade back down after the quarter is over if we do close the"
"3015730","3019630"," quarter green and then price in 50 basis points."
"3021090","3024770"," And then once that 50 basis points is priced in will rise back up once again."
"3025710","3029710"," And they'll trade this market sideways as long as they need to until they think they got inflation"
"3030410","3033610"," or it finally catches up and we cut our fall into a recession. "
"3034150","3037130"," Calling that takes or matters or telling that takes to happen."
"3037530","3038050"," I don't know."
"3038210","3041210"," Could be this month could be three years, believe it or not. "
"3041670","3043350"," Could take multiple, not three to you."
"3043430","3044030"," I think I have a tag."
"3044250","3045630"," I think I've got a tag for December 2024. "
"3046990","3049070"," I think that's when I got a tag for the extended."
"3049070","3050510"," Until we had a recession."
"3050970","3052530"," I'm going to wait until that presidential election. "
"3052610","3055650"," They're going to attempt to wait until that presidential election."
"3055830","3059650"," I'm saying they need to be clear that balance sheet reduction and raising rates will affect"
"3059650","3060490"," financial conditions."
"3061930","3066190"," That is on track to start balance sheet roll off this year since Williams. "
"3067410","3070070"," And I bet you there are companies out there already planning."
"3071930","3076230"," I'm going to bet there's some companies out there just so you can know right spy puts right now."
"3076230","3076850"," Of size. "
"3077450","3079270"," March 30, 450 p."
"3079730","3082070"," Three hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars."
"3082690","3084730"," So that's March 30, 450 p."
"3085010","3086330"," Three hundred and fifty seven thousand dollars."
"3086630","3088050"," QQQ's March twenty fifth. "
"3088590","3089510"," Three fifty nine p."
"3089670","3091430"," One hundred and forty four thousand dollars."
"3092870","3097150"," So just be conscious of that as we head into the end of the month."
"3097610","3100570"," Be conscious of the Fed trying to manipulate the markets. "
"3101250","3102970"," Be conscious that there are companies out there."
"3103030","3104390"," I'm sure they're planning right now."
"3104390","3106910"," Their next guidance is believe it or not. "
"3107150","3112670"," And they're planning for their next one or two years and you've got two camps in the room in the"
"3112670","3113070"," meeting room."
"3113330","3115930"," One camp saying well we can hold off for the next two years."
"3116450","3120490"," Try to stretch it in hopes that the economy comes back. "
"3121030","3125190"," If the economy doesn't come back we at least get you know four to six great quarters."
"3126050","3126870"," Then we'll take profits."
"3127090","3132230"," You'll find like Elon selling and you'll find every CEO out there selling equity blocks of their"
"3132230","3133210"," stock holdings. "
"3133950","3135670"," Shouldn't bring up just Elon but all of them will."
"3136350","3138890"," You'll see that down the road okay."
"3139510","3141090"," So that's what I think we're at. "
"3147050","3147910"," How's everybody doing?"
"3151060","3152240"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"3164050","3164970"," Punching air baby."
"3165430","3166350"," That's what they're doing."
"3171070","3174290"," I lost some viewers today over that over that ramp but that's okay. "
"3174370","3174930"," They'll come back."
"3175550","3177210"," I know what I know what's up out there."
"3177710","3179250"," I know exactly what's up out there. "
"3179950","3183310"," I know that the fucking moment there's not all of you but I know there's some of you out there"
"3183310","3184750"," that fucking hate me publicly."
"3184750","3188110"," But then tune in and don't say a fucking word in the stream."
"3188210","3189590"," Don't say a word in the chat. "
"3190230","3193610"," I know that some of you out there listening right now that shit talk to me on Twitter."
"3194190","3197870"," But you're still listening in to see where the fucking market's going so they don't lose your ass"
"3197870","3198310"," out there."
"3198570","3199730"," I know that for a fucking fact. "
"3209010","3210390"," Let's take a look at Tesla real quick."
"3213620","3214620"," And that's okay too."
"3214760","3215740"," I don't mind you listening to me. "
"3215740","3216120"," You know what I'm on?"
"3216260","3218060"," You're not talking in the chat."
"3218680","3223140"," I'll do whatever you do with your coming into my fucking Twitter with your fucking fake ass"
"3223140","3224640"," accounts with like two followers."
"3225340","3228460"," Then you go in there and shit talk to me inside my comment section. "
"3228700","3229520"," That's what you're saying."
"3229720","3232120"," We need to reply on supply chains."

"3241900","3242540"," Funny as fuck though. "
"3243020","3244040"," But that's fine."
"3245380","3245900"," Okay."
"3246180","3248300"," So let's take a look at now. "
"3248360","3252800"," We do have some negative here indicator on Tesla."
"3253880","3256000"," We've got more sellers currently."
"3256100","3258140"," William said must remain nimble. "
"3259320","3260520"," Gotta remain nimble."
"3261060","3263020"," My fuckers already stroking themselves out there."
"3266630","3267530"," You heard that right. "
"3267730","3268330"," Remain nimble."
"3269690","3271410"," So the market internals right now."
"3271470","3273770"," New York sucks James volume is 160 million shares. "
"3273770","3276530"," 10% below its three month average."
"3277270","3278510"," That's all I'm just asked about."
"3278630","3283910"," A 50 basis point like in May says he'll watch the data and analyze it. "
"3284690","3286310"," Oh, neutral."
"3288370","3290710"," It's appropriate to raise by 50 basis points."
"3290710","3292490"," He would approve of that. "
"3294330","3296830"," He's he is an FMC voter if you didn't know."
"3300890","3302010"," Market internals update."
"3302210","3303810"," We've got a volume of 160 million shares. "
"3304290","3306330"," It's 10% below its three month average."

"3337980","3341200"," Let's look at Tesla real quick. "
"3344960","3347080"," Here indicator is slightly negative on Tesla."
"3347900","3350700"," You've got a lot more sellers than buyers right now."
"3351240","3355040"," The advance of the client is telling you the same story that there's some selling. "
"3355640","3359380"," Some profit taking which I don't blame bulls taking profit here."
"3362260","3364280"," Let's take a little bit lower here on Tesla."
"3365740","3368060"," Got a lot of serious sellers above here. "
"3368200","3368820"," You can see them."
"3369860","3378560"," Sellers all the way to 10.50. It's tough to read Tesla on indicator on indicators because Tesla"
"3378560","3381840"," buyers by regardless of the stock is going up or down."
"3384800","3388500"," I would be using spy as your as your. "
"3390180","3392160"," Guide posts or even cues."
"3392620","3397000"," Even though the cues are more volatile for a guide post for Tesla."

"3410120","3413740"," Same same thing as spy right tight trading range today."
"3414540","3417820"," Don't be buying the wrong dips and selling the wrong rips and Tesla."
"3418180","3419340"," You can get locked in. "
"3419860","3422540"," I think this is locking in the bears as well."
"3423220","3427820"," So just make sure that you're buying the right dips and you're selling the right rips and you don't"
"3427820","3430220"," get squeezed into a hole on Tesla today."

"3471110","3476830"," I traded the cues in Nasdaq for a long time. "
"3477290","3486990"," What I found was that it was difficult for me to trade the cues"

"3492950","3497870"," If you try to trade Tesla all by itself it's difficult to trade."
"3497990","3501450"," It's not an easy stock to trade to know when to buy and when to sell. "
"3502810","3510870"," If I'm trading the cues I'll put it side by side with the spy and the VIX because the SPX"
"3510870","3514630"," or SP500 is the total market health."
"3515010","3516330"," It's not just the cues."

"3550250","3554850"," We can see that we've got some shorts being squeezed here as we trade higher."
"3555090","3563170"," We'll look to see and you can see some hidden sellers here at 453 flat, which we expected, and then"
"3563170","3565410"," some major sellers above at 45350."
"3565410","3572190"," Even more sellers here, the whole conscience of this one right here, 45390 on the upside. "
"3574960","3577200"," 454 and there's 455."
"3578540","3580420"," This is all volatility here."
"3580620","3581660"," You can see it in here. "
"3582280","3587180"," Especially the conscience of this one right here, 45431 is a big one."
"3588080","3590880"," Here's another big one right here, 45390."
"3592760","3596380"," It's actually not as much resistance here at 45350 like I thought. "
"3596520","3599220"," We'll have to keep an eye on this and see if they swoop down."
"3601160","3603260"," I'm going to change this to a current order book."
"3606080","3607020"," Press play here. "
"3608720","3612840"," You can see the squeezing that's going on right now in the market."
"3615840","3618100"," Be careful right where we are right now at 45270."
"3618960","3620480"," You see this wall of sellers right now. "
"3620560","3621380"," It's coming into the market."
"3622200","3623640"," Speak careful here."
"3623920","3627860"," Then your next spot here is 454 here and that 454. "
"3629020","3630940"," Then big sellers here at 455."
"3640270","3644350"," Breaking above resistance at 45220 currently."
"3647310","3648670"," We'll get BBY next. "
"3649970","3657550"," A derivative of a derivative, you find that if you ever get caught in BBY looks great, by the way."
"3657830","3659150"," Good job calling out BBY."
"3659630","3662150"," Lots of buyers, more buyers and sellers of BBY. "
"3662290","3663370"," People are blasting off."
"3663710","3665290"," It's $22, $21."
"3666050","3667890"," Not many sellers above here. "
"3667990","3673470"," You've got some resistance coming up at $22.79 and another round at $23."
"3674950","3685550"," So $22.69, $22.98 and a price target of $23.80. That's"
"3685550","3690830"," my expectation for $23.80 if you can continue to bump and grind all the way up here in BBY."
"3693130","3694530"," So call it some tickers for me. "
"3696050","3697270"," Call it some tickers for me."
"3697330","3697570"," Rocket."
"3698110","3698510"," Hold on. "
"3698730","3700970"," Almost go back up here to see you guys are staying above here."
"3701450","3701610"," I'm missing."
"3701850","3702110"," Hold on. "
"3702130","3702750"," I'm going through it here."
"3703330","3703710"," Hold on."
"3703790","3704570"," I'm going to start the top here. "
"3706550","3707690"," I'll do Mara next."
"3711750","3713190"," It's happy Fridays around here."
"3713410","3715090"," So what we're going to do is what you guys want today. "
"3715550","3718950"," Call out tickers that you think can go, can be a sh..."
"3718950","3719270"," How about this?"
"3719450","3720250"," If you're going to call it some..."
"3720250","3721290"," If you're going to shout out tickers, right?"
"3722030","3725150"," Shout out a good call for a long or a short."
"3725470","3728470"," If you're like, hey, Cap, I think this stock's going to keep rolling over."
"3729010","3736910"," Just say, I don't know, say, I don't know, April 15th, 25 P's on ticker SCXX. "
"3738070","3744250"," Or pay Cap, I don't know, Uber, 40C, 616."
"3745130","3751230"," And we'll take a look at that chart and at that ticker on Book Map."
"3751970","3755130"," Try to help your fellow traders out, your fellow investors out. "
"3756050","3758390"," Mara, it's a tough one to Mara here."
"3759470","3762170"," You got way more sellers than buyers right now on Mara."
"3763010","3765110"," Unless there's some news that I don't know about. "
"3766490","3769190"," On a regular chart, it's not looking so hot."
"3772030","3773530"," It's not looking so hot here."
"3773690","3775350"," You can see the wave of sellers here. "
"3775630","3777610"," Here indicator is negative right now, quite negative."
"3779070","3785270"," You can see your point on the Mara chart, though."
"3788950","3790070"," You can see what you're thinking here. "
"3791630","3798490"," So Ty was 83.45. It does look like it wants to continue to correct."
"3799050","3800170"," It had some good."
"3800870","3808330"," I like Mara in the context of, I like Mara in the context of it having some consolidation. "
"3808730","3809930"," Let me hold on here."
"3810850","3811490"," Let me just take it here."
"3817620","3819080"," So let's look at it this way, okay?"
"3820760","3824000"," So I like Mara's consolidation down here. "
"3824180","3828700"," It currently looks more like, you know, by the dips, right?"
"3829020","3830680"," If you come down here, you can buy a dip."
"3830680","3838010"," It also looks like you have some consolidation here, right?"
"3838610","3848070"," My only concern here with Mara would be that you would get, you would get some kind of a, or"
"3848070","3848650"," it's not finished."
"3851450","3855230"," There's a September 2021, believe it or not. "
"3855530","3856490"," Wow, that's so low."
"3861720","3862340"," I'm going to put it there."
"3862340","3865920"," I don't want to see something like that. "
"3866100","3866300"," Hold on."
"3871890","3878350"," I don't want to see something like that, but I could see Mara 10 bucks easily."
"3879830","3881450"," One in the consolidation. "
"3881970","3889210"," One more capitulation move, more pain, but it doesn't have to continue to go down."
"3891430","3898670"," All you really need to know here is that these dips are great to buy, right?"
"3898830","3899750"," That's really all you need to know."
"3900090","3905370"," And the other thing you need to know is even if it trades higher, let's say it breaks out from"
"3905370","3906090"," this consolidation. "
"3906550","3908990"," This looks like consolidation, but you all know it can reverse."
"3909450","3911170"," Let's just say it breaks out here."
"3912370","3915330"," You don't, you only needed this part here. "
"3917310","3918370"," Take the trade there."
"3918490","3923710"," Get out of the trade here and then wait for it to come up a bounce and go."
"3923870","3928030"," The U.S. equity markets are probing the highs of the day for the S&P futures of 45, 36,"
"3928410","3929970"," 50, up 25 and a half handles. "

"3949050","3953510"," If there's a rejection here, take that short all the way down here and look for a buy down below"
"3953510","3954790"," this 2039."
"3954790","3955890"," You can actually raise it up. "
"3957790","3962710"," You actually just raise it up here in case you continue, in case your bottom is actually somewhere"
"3962710","3963150"," in here."
"3967810","3971530"," Create an alert below and save."
"3971870","3973390"," Good job on bringing up Mara. "
"3983640","3986520"," It's 5.0, 42.98 currently."
"3990190","3991190"," Oh boy."
"3991470","3991910"," Hold on a second. "
"3992030","3992490"," Give me two seconds."
"4076270","4077470"," Give me one more second."
"4077470","4078610"," I was trying to check something. "
"4079230","4081350"," I apologize for the pause here."
"4081510","4082050"," So we looked at Mara."
"4083350","4084650"," Especially market conditions. "
"4085390","4085650"," It's possible."
"4086770","4091630"," Now to 42.98. Just smashing, bashing above here on the spy."
"4093770","4096010"," Look at this wave of buyers here. "
"4096330","4096950"," Just look at this."
"4097270","4099970"," Just monstrous buyers on the spy currently."
"4101310","4101910"," Monstrous. "
"4102189","4103890"," We have some resistance above here."
"4103890","4105870"," Let's see how deep the resistance goes."
"4108210","4111870"," If you want to take this market short, there's two places to be watching. "
"4113630","4115069"," Let's see where it is here."
"4115970","4125649"," There's major resistance right where we are here at 4.5.296. Here next resistance level is 4.53.83."
"4126630","4127930"," Now they can come down, right?"
"4128189","4129450"," These sellers will swoop down."
"4129450","4136270"," But just note that there's ice here at 4.384. And there's double ice up here at 4.54.76."
"4141910","4143090"," Somewhere in there. "
"4144029","4147590"," Trying to look to see where the next major sellers are."
"4154939","4155859"," Crazy sauce."
"4162080","4166979"," 4.54.73. We already talked about that one. "
"4166979","4176850"," We talked about this one at 4.53.85. And right in here at 4.53. Right where we are."
"4177770","4180910"," Which is a natural point of resistance."
"4183390","4186750"," Come more sellers than buyers right where we are right now too, right?"
"4187950","4189290"," Here indicator is still very green. "
"4192529","4193550"," Hello ladies."
"4195430","4197210"," Just crushing it right now."
"4197210","4198610"," Just crushing it. "
"4202170","4203410"," AMD, right?"
"4203790","4204490"," Green virus to hell."
"4204590","4206450"," You guys want to see where a top is on AMD?"
"4208090","4209470"," Is there a top on AMD?"
"4211930","4213110"," Look at the AMD next."
"4213250","4214950"," We'll also look up Amazon in the background. "
"4220130","4221410"," Those are the next two symbols."
"4221610","4224410"," You guys should be calling out symbols that nobody talks about."
"4224990","4226110"," Who does that really well?"
"4227330","4228350"," Winky does that really well. "
"4228350","4235310"," He's always finding obscure tickers with like PE ratios of like 1.3 that have put the banks are"
"4235310","4235550"," moving."
"4235950","4237050"," I also have that."
"4237770","4239010"," I also have that. "
"4239850","4240890"," That Finviz."
"4242810","4246970"," As a matter of fact, the Finviz screener right now."
"4247530","4248630"," We should take a look at that real quick. "
"4251250","4252110"," This is a great."
"4252610","4254650"," Today we're on the high in the markets, right?"
"4254910","4256090"," What I do is you let's say we're not."
"4256210","4257530"," He said how often you check it. "
"4257790","4264850"," So like today, I'd be checking it and checking on these tickers here for reversals."
"4265170","4267230"," These are all new companies, right?"
"4268090","4271410"," These companies have like you have to go back and read their last."
"4272810","4276970"," Their last earnings report and their guidance specifically, but they have typically they're making"
"4276970","4277290"," money. "
"4277290","4280110"," They've had tick ass quarters year, year over year."
"4280110","4281050"," They only opened three years ago."
"4281550","4282810"," You guys want to buy dope companies?"
"4283550","4284190"," These are them. "
"4284970","4286410"," The tickers change every week."
"4289110","4292630"," And the market's on a high right now."
"4292670","4295970"," It's probably not the best time to buy these companies, but it is a good time to start charting"
"4295970","4296710"," these companies out. "
"4297330","4298970"," And always chart these companies out."
"4299090","4301310"," Oh, these are companies instead of catching knives all the time."
"4301490","4305490"," You want to trade some companies that are banging instead of knife catching. "
"4305910","4309490"," This is one of the, this is one of the companies to do it with."
"4309950","4312370"," Sales growth quarter over quarter, 30%."
"4312370","4313070"," Banging. "
"4313910","4314310"," Banging."
"4315970","4317690"," So we'll take a look at a couple of these, right?"
"4317850","4319750"," We'll look at this one's trading pretty low."
"4320270","4320690"," Our loop. "
"4321470","4323150"," We'll take a look at our loop real quick."
"4324730","4325850"," It'll roll over on the spy."
"4327770","4329030"," We'll take a look at our loop. "
"4332030","4336030"," UBS reportedly said to be cutting jobs into equity capital markets unit."
"4337450","4338690"," Uniform Bravo Sierra."
"4339330","4339910"," Look at that. "
"4340230","4341570"," I've actually charted this one."
"4343250","4344710"," I've actually charted this one."
"4345110","4347910"," And you can see it came down, right?"
"4348110","4348870"," We actually traded up. "
"4348970","4351570"," You can actually see my charting job."
"4351950","4353230"," Not too far off was it?"
"4353990","4355570"," Not too far off, right?"
"4355970","4356490"," Came up here."
"4357110","4357470"," Rejected. "
"4358090","4358450"," Right?"
"4358730","4359530"," Making another move here."
"4359890","4361190"," I'm expecting a rejection actually."
"4361310","4365490"," Am I actually going to expect this to come down at some point down here?"
"4365870","4367550"," And then a giant move up here. "
"4368170","4368430"," Okay."
"4368550","4368790"," That's funny."
"4368950","4371070"," I actually, I can't believe that I actually charted this one out. "
"4371210","4372110"," I think we've done this one in the past."
"4372790","4376010"," But take a look at these companies because this is not catching a knife, is it?"
"4376550","4380310"," You can see that this has been bought by banks to move higher."
"4381630","4383850"," So I'll get rid of this right now as the rollers. "
"4384590","4388110"," The official saying that Germany wants to be free of Russian coal by September."
"4389210","4390230"," Take a look at SG."
"4395910","4397710"," We've done this one already in the past, right?"
"4397910","4398290"," It's funny. "
"4398450","4399010"," We've already done these."
"4401390","4405470"," So I've actually got this coming up here and then trading down, right?"
"4406210","4407790"," You can actually see my charting."
"4407850","4409450"," We've done this on stream. "
"4411050","4413010"," Well, I'm not that far off, am I?"
"4413490","4415490"," I'm not that far off, am I?"
"4415490","4417490"," So take a look at this."
"4417790","4420690"," Keep your eyes on this, on these tickers."
"4421370","4423370"," You can see this nice little buy here. "
"4423570","4429670"," It's the ability to buy dips here and make some significant money on these tickers."
"4430310","4436390"," If you don't know Winky, he's bouncing around on Twitter and he's in the Discord."
"4436850","4437930"," He's someone that you want to follow. "
"4442870","4448550"," So you guys take a screenshot of this if you want and make this for yourself."
"4448550","4452530"," And I'll adjust these, but you guys can make one of these for yourself."
"4453110","4456690"," And you get new companies on here that pop in and pop out a weekend week out. "
"4457130","4463390"," And you can see if they've already made their moves or if there's a chance to buy their moves and"
"4463390","4463970"," take them long."
"4464610","4464710"," Okay."
"4467570","4469170"," So we'll go to AMD next. "
"4470650","4475730"," William saying Fed Reserve William saying supply chain issues have not improved the way he had"
"4475730","4476070"," hoped."
"4491440","4492260"," I'm going to go to AMD."
"4492500","4504500"," It's down 0.36%. I realize"
"4504500","4509800"," like about AMD is that he used to be such a consistent trader. "
"4510700","4512060"," I used to love trade AMD."
"4512280","4516580"," It's one of my first stocks ever traded options on trades nice and slow."
"4518830","4519990"," He's a patient with AMD. "
"4520750","4526330"," Even today, you can be patient with AMD trades really well."
"4526330","4532030"," That's William saying there's now a very strong focus on inflation that is well above the target"
"4534550","4537830"," when the supply chain issues have not improved in the way they'd hoped."
"4542000","4543020"," I'm just a second here. "
"4544880","4548080"," I'm going to try to chart out AMD for you."
"4551030","4552770"," I'll try to do this in front of you guys, right?"
"4554090","4556330"," So this is all new charting for AMD."
"4557530","4559950"," I'll probably raise this up a little bit right in there. "
"4562110","4564630"," I haven't charted AMD out in some time."
"4568930","4570930"," Bring that nice push up right there."
"4573850","4575730"," Do I think AMD can trade low?"
"4575890","4576110"," I do. "
"4578450","4588170"," I've got no problem with AMD continuing its correction here down to probably my price"
"4588170","4590570"," target probably $83 or $90 somewhere in here."
"4591470","4598750"," I don't care about AMD or any other company that says that they are good there."
"4599310","4604550"," The reason being is because you know banks took AMD down here and they want to take profit. "
"4604870","4607690"," So this is where they pushed AMD 72 bucks."
"4610390","4613010"," I think that this is the new trading range in here."
"4613590","4615950"," I think that this is their new trading range. "
"4615950","4623210"," But even so, even that being the case, I don't think it's implausible to see it trade below here"
"4623210","4624290"," for a brief moment."
"4624630","4625450"," Maybe not this low."
"4627170","4633110"," Maybe not that low, but it could easily see it trading maybe down to let's call it between $80 and"
"4633110","4633390"," $90. "
"4634490","4641110"," The banks will rebuy the capitulation move and then it'll begin to trade in this zone here, which"
"4641110","4644950"," is kind of nice because whenever it does trade in the zone, it's very easy to trade."
"4644950","4646630"," It's very easy ticker to trade."
"4647590","4648650"," It's very predictable. "
"4649450","4650070"," It's moves."
"4651950","4653890"," So I used to really, really enjoy it."
"4654110","4655610"," So let's look at AMD. "
"4655890","4656630"," What do I think about it?"
"4657990","4659030"," Let's get rid of this."
"4659570","4661150"," Go into a smaller time frame."
"4663270","4665930"," I think it I think it stays in its trading range. "
"4667290","4670490"," One, two, three, four, boom, higher."
"4671550","4672730"," Yeah, I think it can trade lower."
"4681600","4691850"," I like this, I like this trend that"
"4691850","4692310"," it's following. "
"4700110","4702470"," Let's just pretend this is the trading range."
"4702850","4703950"," Let's just say we're bullish."
"4704370","4710200"," If you're ultimately bullish on, you think it's made the turn. "
"4711700","4712620"," This is where you buy the dips."
"4712820","4716460"," Anything down below here, you buy the dips on, you sell the rips on it up here."
"4717700","4720980"," You can see the resistance ticking in already. "
"4722000","4724980"," So am I bullish here on AMD?"
"4725260","4726660"," No, I'm looking to buy it down below."
"4726660","4731800"," Update from the Ukraine side and negotiations with Russia are saying the process is very difficult."
"4732560","4736400"," The Ukraine continues to demand security guarantees and territorial integrity. "
"4745560","4746180"," Some like that."
"4746200","4749780"," In the rising U.S. yields today, we have seen the U.S. 10 year briefly test that two and"
"4749780","4750860"," a half percent mark."
"4752280","4754420"," Look for this line right here that is posted. "
"4754720","4755820"," This is your sell it."
"4756340","4760740"," The three year and the five year both and the seven year already trading above two and a half"
"4760740","4761180"," percent."
"4761360","4766460"," So the inversion there in the middle part and across most of the yield curve has continued. "
"4767600","4772180"," We have seen some steeping there between the three months and the two year and the rest of the"
"4772180","4772600"," yield curve."
"4775930","4778670"," This is if it continues correcting."
"4779130","4780450"," This is my price target down below. "
"4787170","4788310"," Price targets down here."
"4788390","4789330"," If it continues to correct."
"4789750","4792630"," I know that you're going to give me all kinds of reasons and why it's going to continue to go"
"4792630","4792790"," up. "
"4792790","4794290"," But I'll be honest with you."
"4794590","4794990"," Every ticker."
"4795210","4801050"," Even when you make legs up into new trading zones, the banks still want to be in cheaper than you. "
"4801130","4801850"," It's not here."
"4802330","4803330"," It's slightly lower."
"4803650","4804690"," Even if it's for a brief moment. "
"4805290","4809550"," Even if it's like it comes down here, let's say for a brief minute and you're like, oh shit, it's"
"4809550","4810010"," down here."
"4810110","4810370"," Oh no."
"4810650","4812070"," And it just swings down briefly. "
"4812670","4813510"," They suck it all up."
"4813770","4817010"," Comes right back into this trading range and then it trades in here."
"4817010","4820850"," You can see it's been trading in here for since January. "
"4822570","4824330"," But it's kick ass ticker to trade."
"4824770","4826930"," It's pretty well defined in how it moves."
"4828510","4833410"," So if it bounces back down here, buy anything down here, take profit above here. "
"4834450","4838830"," If it starts to trade into a new range, then you know that you can buy it again up in"
"4838830","4840150"," here and sell it above."
"4842890","4843810"," So that's AMD."
"4852060","4856860"," So the role of our AMD, if you are uber super duper bear bullish and you're like, no cap you're"
"4856860","4857100"," wrong. "
"4857940","4859280"," You've got what we talked about, right?"
"4859600","4860720"," Resistance here at 122."
"4861880","4863640"," More sellers above at 125."
"4864720","4866120"," Your next price target's 130. "
"4868240","4869120"," 135, 140."
"4869440","4869740"," It's very consistent."
"4871000","4874980"," And then you get some major sellers above here between 138 and 144. "
"4876120","4881200"," 138, 142 is where the top top would be right now if you're super bullish on it."
"4895300","4895820"," Close."
"4897860","4901320"," Not too much going on with Amazon today. "
"4901380","4901560"," It looks like."
"4901600","4904720"," You use Drombruskus in an interview with German Pressing."
"4904900","4907280"," You is planning some new free trade agreements. "
"4916570","4917770"," More sellers than buyers."
"4918110","4919870"," I like Amazon here to 3350."
"4924040","4925380"," More buyers and sellers. "
"4925380","4927960"," Here are indicators neutral right now."
"4930830","4932430"," Just kind of fall on the flow of the market."
"4939210","4940410"," We had a blast off. "
"4940550","4943070"," It was down as low as 2671."
"4944290","4946510"," It's now trading at the high."
"4946710","4948490"," It traded almost 3326. "
"4958060","4959980"," So this is where we had it charted at."
"4962180","4963900"," So we had it charted at, right?"
"4964520","4966560"," We had this nice little line that we had in there."
"4968000","4971940"," Trade very similar to the spy, right?"
"4972300","4973500"," So it probably has the same answers. "
"4973880","4985110"," I probably have the same answers on this one as I do on 3500 we"
"4985110","4985790"," talked about here."
"4986150","4990450"," This would be the 460 on spy up here."
"4990890","4992070"," You need to get his 460. "
"4992730","4996430"," You can see where you've got some support down here looking for a trade hire."
"4997410","4998990"," I think we get 3500 today."
"4999850","5002930"," Probably not until 31st if we get up there. "
"5003750","5006210"," But that's my price target into the 31st."
"5008770","5010070"," We'll see if we can make it here."
"5011210","5012910"," Probably we'll come back and check this for you, okay?"
"5016580","5021580"," It's to a price target of 3500 if we don't have any headline news. "
"5027860","5038500"," If we don't have any headline news, we'll do a price target of right here, 3500 on the 31st."
"5038640","5040040"," Does we need to because if we trade up there?"
"5040940","5050510"," If we trade up there, then this is where I think we're going to go."
"5066480","5067920"," So we'll come back and check on this. "
"5070340","5072100"," That's where I think we go for the first."
"5073340","5074700"," Let's just start rolling the market over."
"5075000","5079580"," Watching some puts on queues, spy, Nvidia, spy again. "
"5081080","5084640"," QQQ is 325, 59P, 67,000 dollars."
"5084960","5088860"," Spy 325, 450P, 66,000 dollars."
"5091140","5094830"," I'm going to check some trades that I'm in. "
"5094970","5095170"," Hold on."
"5105450","5112290"," Synchron features moving a little higher here on some unconfirmed reports of a fire at a Saudi"
"5112290","5116070"," Aramco facility in Jeddah."
"5116990","5118210"," Somewhere in there. "
"5119030","5121830"," There's these social media reports so far only."
"5125320","5127380"," Amazon selling off slightly right now."
"5129500","5132100"," Let's take a look at the spy bouncing on VWAP. "
"5135910","5138890"," Just a second here."
"5144380","5160810"," Just keeping"
"5160810","5161910"," an eye on the spy here."
"5162250","5164370"," 449.32, another bounce here here. "
"5164670","5165030"," Push higher."
"5166330","5171230"," We did encounter some of that resistance even lower than we expected from the 4350."
"5171770","5174330"," Sellers came down to say hell no you're not going up. "
"5176930","5180610"," We will look for another bounce for the one minute and the five minute we'll take a look at."
"5180750","5181710"," Five minutes even lower."
"5183010","5186370"," You can see down here the 200 down here at 450. "
"5188450","5193530"," You've got this little intraday day trader."
"5194190","5196270"," Day traders will be looking to buy this down here."
"5196990","5200010"," Let's look at the 15 minute look at how low the 15 minute is 448. "
"5202110","5206330"," If you're a day trader, if you're a day trader, you'd love to grab this bounce down here."
"5206330","5208190"," I'd love to grab this."
"5208350","5209490"," We can grab this and be stoked. "
"5210910","5215330"," There's a wide range here on where we can trade on the 15."
"5216570","5219390"," Looks like it looks like we're trading on the 21 right now."
"5219910","5221110"," Just had a quick touch on the 21. "
"5222170","5226730"," Then the 50 I believe right here is this white bar."
"5227610","5231130"," So look to play the 15 minute chart."
"5231270","5233350"," We'll be playing the 21 the 50. "
"5233350","5237690"," And then man, if we can get down here, maybe we tag this down below at the close here today."
"5239130","5239570"," 448."
"5240190","5242470"," We will roll this over a couple of day trades in here. "
"5242610","5246790"," We roll it down into 448 for the bell into Friday."
"5247750","5249210"," Now I bring the licks back up."
"5252030","5252910"," Oh, it makes sense. "
"5254130","5259390"," Maybe we trade it down on Monday into like 440, 438 and then we do a nice big grab up"
"5259390","5262850"," for the rest of next week and just grind higher into Friday."
"5263870","5265790"," That's what I think is going to have unless there's some headline news."
"5268530","5269510"," Okay, so there's a spy. "
"5269810","5272650"," We'll keep my eye on the spy because I'm going to try to grab a day trade here at some"
"5272650","5272930"," point."
"5279840","5281520"," There's some day traders already stepping in."
"5281880","5283160"," Just be conscious of this too. "
"5285520","5290640"," Watching IWM 56200Ps for 1.2 million dollars."
"5291540","5296480"," So May 6, 200P down here at 450."
"5296480","5297520"," Was looking at 415. "
"5298500","5300540"," And it's still that volatility zone down here."
"5301780","5303060"," So keep your eyes on that."
"5303920","5306360"," There's no real support at 448. "
"5307660","5310220"," Which for that 200 day is in the 15 minute chart."
"5310860","5311620"," I ain't seen it."
"5312440","5315300"," So it seems like all the buyers are up here right now. "
"5315640","5318300"," All the buyers are up here on either."
"5318880","5321080"," If you're a bull 450."
"5322640","5324220"," 18 and 450. "
"5325400","5325960"," 90."
"5326600","5328140"," Where you're all your buyers are."
"5328260","5330300"," There's no buyers waiting down below or anything like that. "
"5331240","5332500"," And of course VWAP here."
"5335510","5338290"," Take note that there are some."
"5339230","5340890"," I don't know puts coming in. "
"5340990","5348190"," We've had them coming in for two days now on IWM and that is based on our credit markets."
"5349130","5353910"," I posted on Twitter last night an article about the credit markets."
"5354970","5358310"," And there's a there's a contrarian take on. "
"5360050","5362310"," There's a contrarian take on."
"5363830","5366390"," IWM small caps actually going down."
"5372370","5374970"," So 200 looking for this role over here. "
"5376390","5377750"," And I didn't does this right."
"5377750","5380410"," IWM is known to trade sideways."
"5381030","5383210"," So it's not a bad trade. "
"5383790","5386790"," We know that IWM loves these sideways ranges."
"5387410","5388790"," They've done this for years on end."
"5389870","5393370"," We've seen IWM do this in this time period here. "
"5395450","5397730"," We've seen it do it in this time period here."
"5398690","5400790"," We've seen it do it in this time period here."
"5401370","5404770"," IWM is kind of famous for sideways trades. "
"5404770","5407030"," Even if it's trending up, it trades slow."
"5407750","5410550"," I only trade at IWM for like weeklies or monthlies."
"5410870","5413130"," So yeah, I can see why there's puts on IWM. "
"5414750","5417730"," I can see whether it's touch here, touch here."
"5418590","5421570"," But you know, I can still see it trade higher too."
"5421790","5423590"," I can still see it trade at 208 or lower. "
"5424610","5426850"," I'll bring that lower down here a little bit more."
"5428290","5428930"," I can see why."
"5429470","5431390"," I can see why people want to bring. "
"5432790","5434030"," Let's tighten that up."
"5437790","5439330"," That lower range bound."
"5440290","5441390"," Look at this one. "
"5442750","5444290"," Lower, lower, lower, lower."
"5446030","5446890"," What is that?"
"5447030","5447970"," When is that?"
"5450590","5453490"," May 6th 200 P."
"5455990","5458610"," Let's take a look at this 200 P that they've got out there."
"5465540","5467320"," May 6th 200 P."
"5467720","5469620"," I wonder if I need to tighten that up or not. "
"5471960","5473780"," It seems like it needs to be tightened up."
"5476720","5477820"," It's not a bad trade."
"5479420","5480280"," I like that trade. "
"5485230","5486650"," I like that trade."
"5489490","5492050"," Even if it rolls higher, then it comes back down."
"5492050","5498110"," Even if we do this job here, like if we come up for the end of the month, then we"
"5498110","5498950"," roll back down. "
"5501410","5502470"," I like that trade."
"5504830","5506990"," So there's some IWM puts."
"5508850","5509650"," Golden ticket. "
"5511430","5518210"," We might wait to put them on until maybe we're closer to this resistance up here."
"5519080","5520150"," Maybe another."
"5521230","5523230"," I guess that's not a bad trade right now. "
"5523850","5525330"," There's trade coming as a golden ticket."
"5525450","5527430"," It's got a really high algo score."
"5527610","5528510"," It's IWM. "
"5529570","5532110"," May 6th 200 P."
"5533550","5534710"," 2,700."
"5534850","5536930"," There's some divergence here in the NASDAQ continue."
"5537270","5540290"," The NASDAQ composite now down about 90 points on the day. "
"5540350","5545770"," We're seeing pressure in the NASDAQ 100 futures S&P falling back towards unchanged."
"5547010","5552310"," Crew futures have moved back towards the best levels of the session as stocks have fallen."
"5552690","5559770"," Take a U.S.O. take a look at the U.S.O. IWM 200 P for May 6th. "
"5560470","5562230"," 1.2 million dollars."
"5562450","5563130"," It's 200 P."
"5564110","5566070"," 2,700 88 contracts."
"5566450","5566930"," I like that trade. "
"5567810","5569830"," I like it as a put spread."
"5572190","5573870"," U.S.O blasting off right now."
"5577970","5583330"," From lows of 77.94. I'll take a look at U.S.O. next. "
"5590110","5591590"," Probably has a little more room to run."
"5592710","5594830"," It looks nice actually."
"5595550","5597010"," So we'll take a look at U.S.O. real quick. "
"5606330","5608690"," On the spy, we talked about 450."
"5618480","5620760"," A nice tag down here in 450."
"5620760","5621900"," You'll see if it can hold. "
"5623100","5627560"," All the buyers being up at 450 but no lower."
"5628160","5630160"," We'll see if any more support has stepped in."
"5630260","5634040"," If it hasn't, you're going to be looking for lower numbers on the spy. "
"5639370","5640950"," We'll take a peek down here and see."
"5640950","5644450"," All the buyers are up here on spy at 450."
"5646490","5648350"," But there was nothing down below. "
"5650390","5653030"," There's some support here at 450."
"5654930","5660050"," It's clear skies down below to 445 down below."
"5665450","5666730"," Let me bring this back up. "
"5674570","5675970"," Let's take a look at this once more."
"5677010","5679290"," This is the dip that I'm looking for right here."
"5679290","5681850"," This white line and this white line right here. "
"5682230","5683650"," This one down below here."
"5683710","5685090"," We'll see if buyers show up."
"5685210","5688730"," If they don't show up, the price targets down below. "

"5701490","5704690"," And this dovetails with the ports."

"5708290","5714330"," A fire at a ramp-co planted jet of still waiting for visual ports on that fire. "
"5720980","5723020"," There's 450 right here."
"5723720","5725740"," It's starting to break through 450 now."
"5726280","5732580"," If you missed this rollover, look for another rejection here and for a move down to 445. "
"5734520","5737500"," I'll take the short with you if it bounces back briefly."
"5737500","5744700"," White House officials confirming again that they are considering more releases from the SPR but"

"6681360","6682440"," Price target down below."
"6682700","6686440"," We'll look at 445 and see if the buyers are there or not. "
"6686440","6688740"," It's like they've got some buyers above here."
"6690160","6691720"," All the way down to 446."
"6695260","6697000"," Huge buyers down here, actually. "
"6697620","6700000"," You may want to take some profit in here at some point."
"6704560","6708400"," And if there's another rejection above reposition for the next trade."
"6718660","6722220"," For some kind of rejection here and then another blast through. "
"6723000","6725440"," There's a lot of buyers hidden here."
"6727420","6730180"," But I'm going to be looking to grab one more for the trip to 445."
"6740290","6741250"," Clear that there. "
"6751870","6753570"," Spy puts now down to 180."
"6754570","6755530"," Hopefully you took profit."
"6757430","6759270"," They printed fucking fat though. "
"6765100","6766260"," And then a 178."
"6766720","6768600"," Pretty big widespread ask there."
"6770080","6770980"," They were down. "
"6771260","6771720"," Just be aware."
"6772060","6773240"," This is a zero date stuff."
"6773560","6774500"," So today's Friday. "
"6774700","6778820"," Just be conscious that these puts were dirt cheap earlier."
"6779160","6783240"," So there's some people that are in them since, you know, like 80 cents, 60 cents."
"6784740","6790280"," So use that as a benchmark as they wear off in value where you can buy it again. "
"6793240","6796800"," Majority were in right around majority were in."
"6798800","6802400"," Majority of put buyers bought right here where my cursor is right here."
"6802580","6808280"," So if we move back up anywhere in this vicinity, I wouldn't, wouldn't surprise me to see us come"
"6808280","6809080"," back up here. "
"6810320","6813040"," And then reload for another, another tag lower."
"6821910","6831810"," Puts now down to $1.70, $1.71. Watching spy calls come in, USO"
"6831810","6833430"," calls, QQQ calls."

"6845150","6847330"," Looking for that trade after the quarter."

"6859050","6861970"," Dip buyers on AMC spy again."
"6862290","6864410"," The spy March 28th, 451 C."
"6864690","6865610"," I'm not in any spy calls."
"6866490","6867850"," I'm just in the puts right now. "
"6870050","6871410"," Apple called dip buyers."
"6871650","6872350"," Spy called dip buyers."
"6872530","6873250"," All small money though. "
"6873510","6875010"," Dip buyers on Nvidia as well."
"6875870","6877950"," But that's all small money right now."
"6915080","6918760"," More buyers stepping or more sellers stepping in right now on the spy. "
"6919000","6920720"," Those puts are back up to 203."
"6920860","6921900"," I'm not in puts right now."
"6921900","6927300"," I sold for profit above or below for like $2.27 or some kind of nonsense. "
"6929460","6931880"," I'm going to let it breathe for a minute and try to jump back in again."
"6953410","6955450"," More dip buyers stepping in on spy."
"6955730","6956950"," I guess we could get a turnaround here. "
"6958810","6962190"," 448.43 is below supported for 50."
"6963690","6966170"," But I still think we trade down into the bell today."
"6966170","6972690"," I think the logical part is that at some point today the VIX is going to kick in heading into"
"6972690","6973130"," the bell. "
"6974310","6976130"," And they might have a down day on Monday."
"6977610","6981410"," And that gets the VIX to like 30 or 25 or 30 or so."
"6981850","6985390"," And it gives the bulls their chance to get to 464 or the end of the month. "
"6989880","6992120"," So I think that I think I wouldn't be dip buying this."
"6992280","6992960"," I guess if it was me."
"6993400","6998180"," Maybe you could dip buy it to 450 or 451, 42 or so. "
"6998960","7001980"," But I think it's going to roll down into the bell today."
"7002740","7003700"," Or trade sideways."
"7004520","7007920"," Trades up, trades down and then it'll die off into the bell. "
"7008760","7010160"," That was a nice trade by the way."
"7029840","7033720"," Russia central banks in the by goal from banks starting March 20th."
"7036680","7038560"," Yeah, look for that reversal somewhere up in here. "
"7038920","7039300"," 451."
"7041820","7043180"," Have some patience."
"7043180","7046800"," If you missed it, look for a reversal. "
"7046800","7048740"," Once again, if you want to trade it again."
"7049100","7052720"," Russia central bank, the by goal of banks starting March 20th at a fixed price."
"7053060","7055020"," Look for some like that if we can get it. "
"7056840","7057640"," Be patient."
"7070650","7072570"," You can see them up here, right?"
"7073130","7074870"," These are the sellers that are hiding above here."
"7075170","7085020"," 450.12. 450.86. Still a little bit of painting here, but you can"
"7085020","7088820"," see a quite a large substantial number of buyers in here. "
"7089040","7092340"," So try to push up and then you should get a reversal at some point."
"7092460","7094400"," I can't say that it's going to happen as high as 450."
"7096580","7098220"," It's not as clear right here. "
"7112560","7116940"," I don't know you get as high as I said, 451, but I don't know if you get that high."
"7119380","7120380"," 449, 47."
"7121760","7123240"," It's already touched up there too. "
"7128200","7133780"," Every time I take a short short position, I go into early."
"7134820","7136820"," And if I just waited another five or ten minutes."
"7138960","7141300"," I'm going to give you guys a private example, whatever. "
"7141540","7144400"," But by puts, I don't know how you guys do it."
"7144480","7145000"," I'll tell you what I do."
"7145760","7152900"," This is rookie mistakes 101, what I do is I'm buying a fucking put right fucking here. "
"7153940","7155160"," I'll show you guys what I do."
"7156160","7158780"," This might work right now, but I'll typically buy right here."
"7159000","7162580"," When I should, I wouldn't wait just five more minutes to buy somewhere up in here. "
"7164360","7168440"," It rolls over and I break even and I miss the entire fucking trade."
"7170000","7171520"," I'm just going to be patient here."
"7171640","7172760"," Look for the next move. "
"7173560","7177280"," It doesn't look like it's going to get as high as 451 from book map."
"7177800","7181620"," It looks like it's going to reverse here, but I always feel like that's how it happens to me."
"7181620","7183880"," Like I miss, I miss the meat of the trade. "
"7184660","7191100"," It ends up, it ends up, what ends up being is a squeeze higher shorts being closed and you can't"
"7191100","7192980"," see it happening, but it happens."
"7193480","7193560"," Right?"
"7194300","7197280"," So if you're a bear, that's a lesson, lesson for the day."
"7198420","7198860"," Just be patient. "
"7200200","7208440"," And see if it squeezes, if it squeezes, if there's some profit taking and then wait for the next"
"7208440","7208760"," dunk."
"7211720","7219140"," There are a lot of us sellers here, but like right in here, 45050 or so, it's still much higher."
"7219460","7220320"," So we'll see what happens. "
"7222900","7232380"," Watching calls coming on spy March 25, 450C QQQs, 358C for $30,000."
"7232380","7236660"," Choose 358C for $28,000."
"7237220","7242080"," TLT calls out there, that goes against the market April 14, 128C. "
"7242540","7245340"," That's that bearish bet against the market for a market crash."
"7246900","7251000"," April 14, 128C for $315,000."
"7251440","7254660"," If you do trade TLT long, it did bounce the other week. "
"7254980","7258860"," If you do trade TLT long, just know that you're going to have to stay."
"7258860","7262900"," Typically you stay in TLT calls for days to weeks."
"7263160","7264140"," It trades very slow. "
"7264640","7268440"," Even if the price goes up, it takes a while for you to make that money."
"7268800","7274080"," So if you're going to take a long on TLT, expect to hold them for a week, two weeks sometimes."
"7275360","7278880"," Spy calls, 325, 450C, $68,000. "
"7279660","7284620"," QQQs March 25th, 358C, $32,000, all small money."
"7284620","7291120"," MT, Mike Tango, May 20th, 34C, $297,000."
"7291220","7291800"," Hi, I'll go score. "
"7293320","7298860"," Wells, WFC, 1021, 22, October 21st."
"7298980","7304060"," Hi, I'll go score 57.5C, $310,000."
"7304660","7309600"," Apple calls March 25th, 175C for $10,000. "
"7309940","7310800"," This is all small money."
"7311040","7312960"," So it's not really big money."
"7312960","7317480"," So you're just looking for a moment to take another short position here. "
"7317660","7323020"," If you are day trading here today, you've got a defined zone so far for today."
"7323820","7328520"," So what we'll do is we will put this zone in."
"7328760","7331900"," You guys are trading with me long enough to know how this ends up trading, right?"
"7332460","7339960"," You end up getting a kind of a defined trading zone. "
"7339960","7342700"," So we've got this top here, 4298."
"7343600","7346800"," We've got an intraday bottom of 44842."
"7347040","7349220"," I expect we trade down into the close at some point. "
"7349940","7352600"," But just be be conscious of dip buyers down below."
"7353200","7358640"," Be conscious of shorts above, cutting their shorts loose and waiting to take another short lower."
"7359080","7362680"," So if you're going to get bearish here, look for rejection. "
"7363360","7367000"," You can probably start entering here and then here and then even go heavier here."
"7367000","7373660"," So maybe a one, a two or an A, B and a C here to take a short position for"
"7373660","7374740"," the next roll over."
"7377910","7379850"," But it wouldn't surprise me if we traded like this. "
"7379990","7385790"," This wouldn't surprise me and then all the way down into the bell."
"7389930","7391250"," That's some fast money right there."
"7402120","7405020"," More buyers and sellers here are indicators turning green right now. "
"7405520","7409660"," Just be mindful that the dip buyers are all day traders."
"7410220","7413360"," These are not institutions at the moment."
"7423500","7430200"," We also note that we talked about the VIX getting the VIX up today to 30, right?"
"7430420","7438780"," Or not today, but today into Monday trying to get the VIX up to 30 so that bulls can take"
"7438780","7439400"," us to 460. "
"7440280","7442360"," So let's look at the VIX real quick."
"7443040","7449520"," I think it's already up to 23, 2286."
"7449520","7456220"," So let's take a look at the VIX real quick and we were talking about how do you get to"
"7456220","7456460"," 460. "
"7457160","7460340"," You know you're not going to get to 460 with the VIX down at 20."
"7460960","7463180"," We know the VIX isn't going down to 10."
"7463880","7465220"," That just ain't happening, right?"
"7465380","7471140"," But 20s are a pretty reasonable bottom for the market for where we are currently in the market. "
"7471300","7477620"," If you want the market to go up, if you want the market to go up next week for the"
"7477620","7482060"," end of the month, it's not really the best looking chart is it?"
"7485650","7487230"," It's kind of a dogish looking chart."
"7487470","7488730"," This is a better looking chart right here."
"7489890","7499890"," So you have this nice little, let's see if I can get it all"
"7499890","7500310"," wonky. "
"7504630","7507230"," So I do this and it's fucking up with my lines here."
"7510170","7512170"," See if I can bring it even higher here."
"7512890","7514550"," Make it a little more truthful for the bears. "
"7517480","7519700"," It's like where can it actually go?"
"7526190","7530310"," So this is 2536 over here, right?"
"7530830","7534550"," And where I want it, where I want to see it is I want to see it."
"7534550","7540950"," If you're going to make it move to 460, then it'd be nice to see 30 would be nice."
"7542990","7545530"," And then a fall down below to get us to 460. "
"7547310","7549210"," So there is some room to run here."
"7549570","7550730"," I don't know that it runs today."
"7551330","7555090"," Sometimes I do this weird shit end of day where we could trade this up here. "
"7555670","7560530"," And then like the last 15 minutes, it gets to like 26, 27."
"7561810","7563610"," And then on Monday, we'll hit that 30."
"7564830","7569650"," And then that'll give you what you need to get to 460 for the rest of the next week. "
"7570110","7571230"," Into the 31st right here actually."
"7571610","7572970"," Matter of fact, I'm going to leave this here."
"7572970","7575030"," See if it happens or not. "
"7575130","7575690"," Sometimes it happens."
"7575910","7576650"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"7577030","7580570"," What we'll do is we'll do a ray here. "
"7583070","7585410"," And let's say we trade sideways."
"7586650","7590110"," We're trading the close area 325 at 1600."
"7593960","7595980"," And then let's say. "
"7599360","7600180"," Fuck it."
"7600440","7601540"," Let's go full bear."
"7603800","7605220"," Let's say by Monday. "
"7606000","7606980"," We're at 30."
"7607360","7608200"," That's 940."
"7608460","7608700"," Was it?"
"7609580","7610820"," Hold on here. "
"7612910","7613310"," Enter."
"7614550","7615230"," Hold on."
"7615330","7615850"," Give me a second here. "
"7619000","7620680"," See, that's the 28th, right?"
"7620900","7621740"," Where's the 28th?"
"7622680","7623700"," 28th at 1600."
"7625280","7626040"," Right there."
"7626840","7627080"," Okay. "
"7627280","7631360"," So we'll see if if some way somehow we can trade this up to 30."
"7631360","7634340"," When I get that high, maybe it'll get to like 29."
"7636540","7638900"," And I don't know whatever the fuck happens in here. "
"7639900","7640780"," We can get to 30."
"7640980","7641860"," Hopefully you can get to 30."
"7641940","7646600"," If you're bull, you want to see 30 for Monday so that we can trade higher on Monday. "
"7647140","7648280"," Or next week."
"7649600","7650480"," You want to see 30."
"7652200","7653800"," You know, and I don't believe that, but. "
"7656220","7658280"," You want to see because I'm going to move up here to 30."
"7661910","7665250"," So there's as high as you can get to 30 so we can get as high as we can to"
"7665250","7665830"," 458."
"7672430","7673550"," This back over here. "
"7679000","7680680"," And hopefully you took profit here."
"7680920","7683260"," If you're if you had some puts, you took some profit."
"7683800","7686740"," Talked about this just a few minutes ago, right before this even happened. "
"7687100","7687780"," We were down here."
"7687880","7692820"," I said to you, one of the big mistakes that I make is, or you know, like new traders make"
"7692820","7694380"," or even I make, right?"
"7694740","7700160"," I'm down here and I'm still holding or I read up on my puts over here by accident."
"7700720","7701960"," See us trading up down. "
"7702180","7705120"," I'm always telling you like, yeah, it's a good chance we can get up here."
"7705560","7706720"," Good chance we can get up here."
"7707000","7709660"," So all it is is puts. "
"7710040","7715080"," And remember that this line right here is where most people took puts puts right here."
"7715360","7717240"," So this is where Max Payne is up in here."
"7718920","7720900"," So, you know, bears that are short from right here. "
"7720960","7722220"," They don't want to see it get up here."
"7723160","7725660"," They want to see it reverse course before it gets here."
"7726940","7728700"," Up in this area to be aware of that as well. "
"7729580","7732000"," The people in puts, they don't want to see it get any higher."
"7734300","7736840"," Just think about where what how other people are positioned."
"7744300","7746220"," Calls coming in on B a."
"7747980","7757000"," April 1, 195 C, $83,073 or $77,000 calls on WFC again. "
"7757840","7765220"," Two sets now, 10, 21 for 62.5 C, $107,000 calls on so five."
"7766140","7768460"," April 14, 10 C, $16,000."
"7771060","7773880"," Those puts are now down to $1.40 or so. "
"7773980","7777100"," They've got some pretty decent premium on them for where we are."
"7781190","7781690"," All right."
"7781830","7783070"," So what are you guys talking about down here?"
"7783130","7783550"," I got to look at your. "
"7783910","7785650"," Sorry to stay stay close."
"7786650","7788650"," Do you guys make money on that on that trade down?"
"7793310","7795690"," Chase is saying I'm an expert of buying puts too early."
"7795890","7796630"," I do it all the time. "
"7797230","7798830"," I'm always buying puts too early."
"7802170","7803710"," I always buy them too early."
"7805470","7808250"," Especially in the bounce, like I like you take profit. "
"7808550","7812130"," And then when I go back in for the second run, I'm always early on that second run."
"7814850","7817390"," The dude orange says have a great weekend."
"7817430","7817770"," I'm out. "
"7819130","7821410"," Spy bounce to 41 then back down for clothes."
"7821670","7822170"," That's right, Matt."
"7824050","7825490"," Target above three short. "
"7825490","7826730"," Tired about three short chases."
"7828130","7832530"," Tired about three short right now is just think about it from this perspective, Chase."
"7833930","7834810"," So right. "
"7835030","7837490"," So most of the I was looking at all the put buying."
"7838050","7839310"," Most of it was right here."
"7841010","7842690"," Most of it was not right here. "
"7843210","7844530"," The majority was right here."
"7844690","7846490"," So would you go down here?"
"7847230","7847290"," Right."
"7847870","7848650"," Make that tag. "
"7849030","7849830"," Take your money and run."
"7850150","7850390"," Right."
"7850750","7852550"," And now there's just a few put holders in here. "
"7852550","7852910"," Okay."
"7853610","7855110"," And they're right now holding going."
"7855370","7855610"," Jesus. "
"7855810","7857270"," Don't let it come back up here."
"7857750","7858810"," That's the same to themselves."
"7859690","7862110"," The more than likely though it's going to come back up in here. "
"7862950","7865810"," And they're going to lose all their money, but all their gains."
"7866410","7868850"," It doesn't always come back up to here, but usually it does."
"7869030","7872550"," And that's like the process of the market makers taking their money. "
"7872990","7874770"," If you do a directional puts, there's zero dates."
"7875470","7876410"," They're only good for the move."
"7876810","7880530"," So these are all these, all these trades are fucking for today. "
"7881010","7883310"," So I would expect it to trade up here."
"7884490","7888670"," 451 is 41, 25 at the most."
"7889630","7891530"," So this is for 50 18. "
"7891850","7893030"," This is for 50."
"7893490","7895010"," And this is for 50 25."
"7895210","7895850"," So somewhere in here. "
"7896550","7897850"," A bigger rollover."
"7898630","7899870"," It's already starting to roll over."
"7899950","7901350"," It's actually tagged at four 50 18. "
"7901910","7904710"," So you could take a, you could probably take another one right now if you wanted to."
"7905290","7906650"," You see this tag right here."
"7908750","7909390"," I'm going to wait. "
"7909430","7910130"," I'm not in right now."
"7910150","7911350"," I'm waiting for this area right here."
"7911830","7913730"," I'm being a little more conservative and take puts. "
"7914130","7914850"," I'm waiting for up here."
"7916050","7918590"," I'm always taking them too fucking, too fucking early, man."
"7920710","7921570"," Okay, so let's see. "
"7922570","7924210"," So we'll leave this over here."
"7924470","7927290"," You guys see where the, where the short is."
"7927510","7929450"," This is the last pick right here. "
"7930050","7932110"," And slightly higher is where I'm going to look for."
"7932210","7933230"," I'm going to look right up in here."
"7933450","7933970"," 450 50. "
"7935770","7937450"," Let's see here if we can get a better view."
"7939230","7940010"," Yeah, right there."
"7940090","7940550"," See that right there?"
"7941270","7941750"," See that right there?"
"7942390","7943570"," A little bit of ice right up in here. "
"7944330","7944750"," 4109."
"7945550","7947230"," Looks like somebody already grabbed that though, right?"
"7948410","7949010"," Is that 450?"
"7949630","7950270"," That's before 51."
"7951950","7954270"," I need a patient here. "
"7954830","7957530"," And I'm going to try to grab some more at 4109 or so."
"7960230","7963550"," What is the timing to take long after a drop like this for day trading?"
"7964070","7966550"," I expect this to trade sideways for the rest of the week."
"7967030","7968330"," This is still a sideways trade. "
"7968970","7971370"," Nothing about this trade currently is bearish."
"7971550","7972770"," We're still in a sideways trade."
"7974370","7976050"," So I think we're trading sideways. "
"7976490","7984630"," My viewpoint currently, unless it changes, is sideways to down and then push higher into end of"
"7984630","7987070"," quarter to be above 453."
"7990340","7991560"," Sounds familiar, Cap."
"7991820","7992880"," I'll wait and trade with you at 450. "
"7993260","7994880"," You guys know what happens, right?"
"7995660","7997880"," I'd rather miss the short than enter it too early."
"7998220","7998520"," Absolutely."
"7999400","8004200"," I don't think the Fed could ever rate hike rates to the Volcker highs because such high rates now"
"8004200","8008640"," would be even more fraudulent than the current missile allocation in moral hazard. "
"8008640","8011100"," We have with unsustainable debt service."
"8011100","8012160"," I agree with most of that."
"8013020","8014000"," And they're done that. "
"8014120","8015480"," You have an expert buying put through really."
"8015640","8021720"," Higher rates are no longer a signal of strength of capital, but a pen of mine of signaling a"
"8021720","8021960"," mering."
"8022500","8025020"," Hoping token efforts can continue to push the fraud in a string. "
"8025300","8026420"," I agree with all that as well."
"8027400","8032060"," Mayor Fak Thomas, Tomas, I believe that there's nothing they can do."
"8032060","8033720"," That they're too late to the party. "
"8034340","8037820"," And yesterday I was talking about you'd need rates today at like 20%."
"8038280","8039640"," To even consider it."
"8040380","8044240"," And you know, if you made rates 20% say you'd fucking burn the market down and send us into"
"8044240","8044980"," a fucking recession. "
"8045860","8047540"," Fuck the rest session, probably a depression."
"8048380","8049680"," So they're fucked, right?"
"8050080","8050920"," You know that they're fucked."
"8051660","8056960"," So the only hope that they have is to try to manage it until we slip into a recession or"
"8056960","8058300"," the entire market rolls over. "
"8059080","8061360"," So I'm a bull, but I understand where we're at."
"8061360","8063080"," I know that we're fucked in the long run."
"8064180","8067480"," And you know that the rope runs out at some point. "
"8068260","8069480"," So how long can they make?"
"8069680","8070780"," How long can they hold out?"
"8071040","8072180"," I don't know the answer to that."
"8072880","8074380"," It could be a month, could be two years."
"8075920","8077080"," But I do agree with you. "
"8079060","8084280"," Tomas is saying HMYC, the stock pumped on insider buying and call options before the AMC"
"8084280","8087680"," announcement sold my TLT a while ago and can't short it."
"8088600","8089860"," TLT is a tough one, man."
"8089860","8091320"," I've tried to trade TLT. "
"8091420","8092900"," It's like the fucking DIA."
"8093160","8094560"," Like you got to sit in it forever and ever."
"8095060","8096100"," Is the liquidity low?"
"8096280","8097240"," Yes, it's still low today. "
"8097320","8099000"," Here's the pump almost time to rent a short."
"8099460","8100140"," Puts can be really."
"8100540","8100740"," Hold on. "
"8100860","8101280"," I'm missing here."
"8103440","8105120"," Listen, some of you guys are saying here."
"8106500","8113940"," President Biden meeting with Polish leader in Poland is saying that he thinks Biden will meet"
"8113940","8115660"," political definition of being more criminal. "
"8115660","8116680"," If they are governor, probably a lot to say, you're coming up with the It's a lot for 50, money"
"8116680","8120180"," for 49 puts, tell them a trade, tell them on some trade."
"8122230","8126750"," I like bold cabs to come, even though I'm a bear."
"8128270","8129410"," We like fast money. "
"8131510","8133110"," I can switch on a fucking dime."
"8133570","8134350"," I've got no problem."
"8134630","8135990"," I've got no problem buying puts. "
"8137210","8139530"," I'm letting a fucking blink off by puts or calls."
"8140290","8147450"," I'm a whore Jim James we think lower to close yeah I do I think earlier I went through it"
"8147450","8156490"," pretty much so my my general expectation is for a sideways trade today possibly Monday even into"
"8156490","8163870"," next week could trade sideways my big issue is end of quarter right my big issue is where's the"
"8163870","8170030"," rain on the court reporting out of Saudi Arabia there's to confirm the Saudi rental storage"
"8170030","8177470"," facility was hit by an attack in Jenna Jesus that sounds like an inside job sounds like one of the"
"8177470","8183610"," nephews of the sons or something we're like fuck that we want higher gas prices the for headline"
"8183610","8190910"," news so my take right now is that we're gonna be trade sideways now my sideways and your sideways"
"8190910","8196950"," may be different I'm given like a hundred point range not a hundred but they're high but swap 1%"
"8196950","8202670"," on the session like a 50 point range on sideways when you trade sideways it's typically sideways"
"8202670","8209750"," and down until some sport is found and I do think that we close the quarter green now that number"
"8209750","8215150"," I have two numbers for green I think that there or there's a green number at a 450 three I"
"8215150","8223250"," think or 456 that's the green quarter but then if you trade if you close higher than 435"
"8223250","8230450"," that's kind of like it that or yeah if you close no if you close below 435 that's three straight"
"8230450","8237490"," down months all three not just the quarter but the three the quarter and the three straight down"
"8237490","8243389"," months which is even uglier now we can trade down there if we see rolling puts I'll take shorts to"
"8243389","8248629"," get down there I'm open to all scenarios in this market and where the end of the quarter winds up"
"8248629","8255270"," but my take stills firm that the bulls are better position than the bears regardless of where we"
"8255270","8261350"," trade you're better positioned as a bull and so I went over that there earlier this morning I don't"
"8261350","8271350"," think you can get to 460 or 455 without the VIX coming up at some point so to expect"
"8271350","8276370"," us to trade sideways the next couple days and slightly down we have a we're famous for Fridays"
"8276370","8282969"," selling off into the clothes VIX screening into the clothes it's OPEC's not OPEC's yet but it's a"
"8282969","8289150"," weekly OPEC's so wouldn't surprise me to see us see the VIX spike up into the bell Mondays are"
"8289150","8294170"," typically down days a good day to buy low right as on Mondays it all it's all kind of fit"
"8294170","8302610"," and the pieces are fitting in again a little bit of a triple top up here double top hold on"
"8302610","8312340"," here I might be trying to take another short here let me just a"
"8312340","8319820"," second here I missed this trade already wasn't paying attention I was talking but if I bearish in"
"8319820","8324020"," the market it doesn't really matter I think your viewpoint right now is I think I've come around to"
"8324020","8330420"," the positioning at this point that you're better off right now in this market where we stand that"
"8330420","8336799"," you're bullish now that would assume that you bought the last bottom the big bottom right that"
"8336799","8343379"," would assume that you take are taking profit right around here it assumes that if we have three"
"8343379","8349280"," scenarios let's give four scenarios I think it's three or four scenarios that would be if you're"
"8349280","8355240"," bullish right you should be collecting your money and running right now you're gonna be looking for"
"8355240","8360620"," confirmation that we can trade within 450 to 460 for you to take your next long that's option A"
"8360620","8367920"," option B is that we don't confirm a trade in 450 to 460 so you wait for a pullback and"
"8367920","8374559"," you're gonna buy a pullback somewhere down below between 440 and 438 or if you start to see rolling"
"8374559","8380500"," we already seen hedges go to the market so you need the second round of put flow that's like a"
"8380500","8386280"," waterfall put flow and real money selling if you see that happening then you just you just hold"
"8386280","8391920"," back in the market you still haven't entered and you're waiting to buy that that crash to 400 or"
"8391920","8397260"," that crash down to 390 or 360 so I think you're still positioned better right now currently today"
"8397260","8403580"," you have more options on the table as up from a bullish viewpoint right now then you do from the"
"8403580","8410420"," bearish viewpoint because the bearish viewpoint right now is the market must roll over if that's"
"8410420","8417200"," your only option it's your only option if the market doesn't roll over you you might be good for"
"8417200","8424800"," what you're good for from here to possibly 438 and they could stretch that out from now you might"
"8424800","8429600"," get that today and tomorrow and then it's a resumption higher so if you wanted to be bearish"
"8429600","8435240"," slightly you could be if you wanted to be bearish with confirmation down below sure but I would"
"8435240","8439400"," have an open you have you need to have more of an open mind as a bear right now than"
"8439400","8444580"," a bull like you have to be able to be like okay I can see 438 but I can switch"
"8444580","8452740"," to a bull or I can see 438 but I can wait for confirmation for a move lower below 438"
"8452740","8459600"," believe it or not below 435 to get super duper bearish so you don't have too many options with that"
"8459600","8465620"," long view as a bear you have to have I think you're the better option here or the more options"
"8465620","8470760"," for you is as a bull generally speaking here even if we were to roll the market over even where"
"8470760","8476540"," the fucking go to the devs that held today we're fucking trade down a fucking 360 today you right"
"8476540","8482100"," now where we stand in the market your best positioning is from a bullish perspective and you can"
"8482100","8487160"," still trade the market rolling over in that perspective you can still take by foot you can still"
"8487160","8491440"," short the market I think your perspective if you have a viewpoint out there as a trader or as an"
"8491440","8496180"," investor or as a bear right now I think right now where we are right now today where we are"
"8496180","8501660"," that if you are just locked in like tunnel vision on being a bear you only have a couple options"
"8501660","8507580"," and if you if those options don't go your way you're gonna get fucking steamrolled right you've"
"8507580","8515220"," seen that happen already and I think that that's my point on that okay just be careful and safe if"
"8515220","8521820"," you're a bear out there I think your options are wider as a bull right now just for the positioning"
"8521820","8526680"," for the fact that we're up here I understand the point that you don't want to miss the trade down"
"8526680","8532780"," to 360 or 390 or 400 but if we make that trade down there you're gonna get confirmation before it"
"8532780","8539180"," happens right you're gonna have plenty of time to see that roll over to capture some of that trade"
"8539180","8544140"," you don't need all of it you don't need the exact top and you don't need to close the exact"
"8544140","8551260"," bottom you saw bears just get fucked up this past week get fucking wrecked by continuing to hold"
"8551260","8556900"," rather than taking profit and waiting for the next opportunity short so do the same thing as a bear"
"8556900","8562200"," if you want to make money as a bear have both sides of the coin be able to see the"
"8562200","8567440"," bull's perspective be able to the bear's perspective be able to trade both sides or at least step"
"8567440","8573160"," out of the way if it goes if it doesn't go your way and right now it doesn't look nothing's"
"8573160","8580120"," looking like there's nothing saying that we're selling this market off right now and even if it"
"8580120","8587800"," does I don't know like you take a short at let's say you bought shorts at 452 and you're like"
"8587800","8592240"," it's never coming back up I guess you could do that I guess you could have bought 453 at this"
"8592240","8597540"," point or you could buy it right now it's 449 53 enter a short right here and just say it's"
"8597540","8603720"," never coming back again but there's an argument against that the big the big top if you want to get"
"8603720","8608220"," really bearish the big top you already know is 460 right I mean you can look at a fucking chart"
"8608220","8613620"," and any fucking chart right so I don't need to fucking show it to you you can fucking see it"
"8613620","8618780"," right here the big short if we're gonna short this bitch again no offense the women now if you're"
"8618780","8622460"," gonna short the want to short this again where is it we already know where it is it's up here"
"8622460","8628040"," that's where the next big short is if you're bearish right I guess there was one down here it went"
"8628040","8632360"," lower I guess and you maybe you were thinking it was gonna do that down here right you get to"
"8632360","8639060"," lower lower rare well you didn't you didn't get to lower low down here did you right you didn't get"
"8639060","8648400"," it down here you got it here right let's get the three months for the three months right here's"
"8648400","8653000"," where it happened right well you look right at it right lower lows lower highs right you got it"
"8653000","8660260"," right here boom right we didn't break above that that higher high up here right they went boom"
"8660260","8667240"," right we failed down here lower than that high right boom double bottom right we come up here and I"
"8667240","8673780"," know that some of you fucking bears are like going down here we didn't we're going down here we"
"8673780","8678860"," didn't and we're now right here so this is how you lose your money all your money believe it or"
"8678860","8684680"," not and so the so I guess if you're a bear you'd be looking my point would be be looking"
"8684680","8690280"," for like right here for a big short now if it does roll over here that's fine too but my"
"8690280","8694940"," expectations we're gonna hit down here somewhere right or lower so do you need do you need to have"
"8694940","8701460"," it like the entire way no you need some confirmation each step each leg down until we get down here"
"8701460","8707240"," and you manage your trade all the way down as a bear so open to either side trading higher trading"
"8707240","8711980"," lower I don't care which way we fucking trade to be honest with you I'm gonna fucking go up or"
"8711980","8721870"," go down well I'll take the trade either way so we met we met our first price target here"
"8721870","8726790"," you see the number one and the number two is down here four forty five we are looking ultimately"
"8726790","8740100"," for I'm looking ultimately at the buy end of day for a tag of four forty five watching"
"8742690","8751590"," some spy calls come in March 25th 450 C $90,000 spy calls come in 325 41 C for $30 "
"8751590","8768140",",000 Walmart calls TJX calls more Wells Fargo calls coming in yeah"
"8768140","8772140"," so my take is that's better to be a it's you know my take I guess let's do a short"
"8772140","8779880"," brief synopsis we can go anywhere if someone's claiming we can get out of 400 that we can go to"
"8779880","8785780"," fucking all-time highs we're gonna point in the market where it's easier for a bull to be cash gang"
"8785780","8794160"," right now and still win in every single scenario all four scenarios a bull can be holding cash at"
"8794160","8802920"," this moment and win in all four scenarios if you are a bear and you are active in this market"
"8802920","8809380"," right now you only have one and a half choice chances of making money here we fully sell off the"
"8809380","8817600"," market or we go down to 438 so very small money chance chance for very small money and then a"
"8817600","8822160"," and then a and then a 25 let's let's see let's give you 25% we sell the entire market"
"8822160","8827640"," off you have a 25% chance of the entire market zone up you have a 12.5% chance"
"8827640","8836820"," let's say making some money if time it right down to 438 let's call it okay that's your only chance"
"8836820","8844460"," it's your risk as a bull right now is that we trade sideways or that we trade higher that's your"
"8844460","8850020"," risk if you're a bull in your cash right now your best bet right now is to buy any fucking"
"8850020","8857400"," dip by a confirmation that we trade slightly higher and confirm 450 to 460 and then long 450 to 460"
"8857400","8864000"," right or we go to all-time high so no matter what the bull has the better or the easier"
"8864000","8872540"," positioning here we're currently for where we are in this market right now at this moment the"
"8872540","8877820"," choices are limited for a bear if you're active in the market that the best choice for a bull right"
"8877820","8884680"," now is to just take your money and actually manage your portfolio and wait for the next leg up and"
"8884680","8888940"," then I would say the same thing if we get close to 458 460 and you're a bull I would"
"8888940","8895760"," say then exit the market with your money once more that's a major major resistance zone and as a"
"8895760","8902300"," matter of fact at 460 I would be definitely tying bulls to put some real protection on because that"
"8902300","8909280"," is a prime target prime target to short and for me too without a doubt I'll be looking to short"
"8909280","8917340"," the entire market around 460 like I will be I'll be like you know like drooling at the mouth you"
"8917340","8923440"," know bears will be fucking you know bears will be held in fucking you know like midnight fucking"
"8923440","8928980"," rave dances and sweaty fucking nightclubs over 460 I mean that's the place if you wanted a place to"
"8928980","8938080"," meet up with bulls and say because that would be the whole thesis right if you're at 460 to start"
"8938080","8944500"," to trade higher the 480 to test all the time highs you're saying that we're gonna have inflation"
"8944500","8949780"," the feds lying that rates aren't gonna ever go high enough to make a difference like that's the"
"8949780","8955620"," thesis above 460 so the natural place to start rolling the market over is anywhere from 460 to 480"
"8955620","8964320"," and so of course I'll be looking to start turn up uber-duper bearish at that point uber-duper"
"8964320","8974110"," bearish you"
"8974110","8981890"," like expiring puts not five days out I don't right now the way this regime is the regime of this"
"8981890","8990710"," market I love spreads and I love zero one three dates directionally holding them for the"
"8990710","8999250"," directionally the directional move they've paid the best and I do not in any way shape or form like"
"8999250","9007330"," buying any puts or calls for one to three months out I have spreads have been my best friend since"
"9008990","9013550"," September I think September November somewhere in there somewhere somewhere between the last"
"9013550","9022470"," quarter September to December quarter and then up until now spreads have been my friend it is"
"9022470","9025790"," matter of fact I used to be I haven't been I haven't been able to buy one to three month"
"9025790","9034660"," outputs and calls since been a it's been a while I want to say since I"
"9034660","9041800"," don't know it's been maybe a year or two I haven't been able to buy one to three month out"
"9041800","9046420"," calls and puts it used to be able to do it like back in the day I'll show you guys"
"9046420","9050160"," something again I show this to some people sometimes then I'll show it to everybody but let me do"
"9050160","9059760"," something real quick for you give me a second here just one quick second I'm seeing Houthi"
"9059760","9067240"," spokesperson saying that their statement on their Saudi operation is coming shortly let me show you"
"9067240","9074560"," guys something here you can buy farther out like four months six months out stuff like that but my"
"9074560","9082740"," problem with the indexes is there I'm assuming problems with the indexes it doesn't matter if the"
"9082740","9090240"," trend is up over three months right or down this works both ways back in the day you could find"
"9090240","9096140"," that trend let's say we let's say we just bounced over like a macro macro like you know like let's"
"9096140","9100500"," say you're looking at one year trying to like boom there's our bounce you used to be able to watch"
"9100500","9109000"," watch the trend and buy up pretty fairly you know you could like buy a dip in here same with"
"9109000","9115560"," going down to works on the same way down you like buy here and you could buy slightly outside the"
"9115560","9122320"," money like right here and then a month later you'd be making some decent money right you like get"
"9122320","9130960"," your money and you run pretty consistently right well now when we do this right we have this you"
"9130960","9136880"," can still kind of see it right the flow of the market you have high frequency trading firms you've"
"9136880","9143660"," got computer programs you've got day traders you've got a fucking retail traders and this is what"
"9143660","9151400"," happens get this violent fucking moves like this and all along the way these options are just"
"9151400","9157780"," getting fucking hammered by losing all their intrinsic value and just getting fucking want to say"
"9157780","9163660"," the R word but just getting fucking destroyed and in this whole entire process and there's some"
"9163660","9168820"," violent swings right we have volatility as a regime now right we know about tail risk so whether"
"9168820","9172600"," you're going up or down you're seeing all this kind of nonsense here and it's like you're buying"
"9172600","9176300"," them here and you're like these are beautiful and then by the time you get here they're worthless"
"9176300","9184220"," and if you didn't time it exactly is you know exactly way up here in this eye you're kind of"
"9184220","9188500"," get fucked right it just valently moves back down and you're like oh I'm totally fucked down here"
"9189020","9198040"," and so you're fucked so for me personally I'll look on a I'll look on a I'm using CLX because"
"9198040","9205480"," it doesn't move but you know I got a spy who actually has been working on the spy since January"
"9205480","9211900"," but I did show you guys yesterday I did show you guys how it does work and I'm down market"
"9211900","9218080"," yesterday I showed you the market breath indicator on trading view and how I know when to buy"
"9218080","9223080"," bottoms even in a down market like right now you guys already saw that yesterday's video if you"
"9223080","9228120"," hadn't seen that check back in yesterday's video I go over fail proof that's actually a fail proof"
"9228120","9235300"," a fail proof indicator for when to buy a dip and it's worked worked the two years are going up"
"9235300","9242520"," and it's worked since January too I went to sell tops when to buy bottoms that kind of stuff you"
"9242520","9252190"," go back and watch that video yesterday so what does that mean it means that if we come down here"
"9252190","9261010"," let's say you come down here to this area here we bounced down here I'll buy call spreads right if"
"9261010","9269710"," we let's say come up here right put spreads is the regime then maybe some weeklies or monthlies and"
"9269710","9275030"," get more aggressive with zero dates as we go down here now we didn't continue down here right so"
"9275030","9281490"," you can only hold these to price but if you were to have a monthly put spread here you will"
"9281490","9287810"," eventually hit it right and you didn't lose any of the intrinsic value on that option because of"
"9287810","9292990"," all this nonsense that took place so if we are rolling over what would you say to yourself your"
"9292990","9299730"," bear you'd say you would say to yourself hey cap I think we could roll over here for 50 or"
"9299730","9309390"," for 60 you could buy yourself some some some some put spreads out start with put spreads you know"
"9309390","9316530"," and you could do a put spread regime somewhere in here and you can make it 450 to 460 wide"
"9316530","9324370"," and you could give yourself I would say to I would say to middle of of April and do I"
"9324370","9330650"," think we'll be higher than 460 in April middle of April probably not do I think we have the chance"
"9330650","9337590"," to trade up here and then swing back down in April I do so this is where you would this"
"9337590","9343490"," is where you work on spreads to make sure that you can account for a swing this is where if"
"9343490","9349050"," we do order right now they'll still printing that you don't need it simple like digital currency to"
"9349050","9355790"," achieve faster payments so no do I do but I do just the city can have a seminar on digital"

"10645790","10653950"," slightly down the road they're not dated for today and so that expands our call range it makes our"
"10653950","10661490"," absolute gamma call gamma in our absolute call wall excuse me higher than it was so that means that"

"10723770","10729790"," options as a bull are better that's the key point here right is that your options we talked about I"
"10729790","10732610"," want to stress this one more time and you guys some of you guys have been with me all morning"
"10732610","10740170"," long if you are bear we're currently where we are you only have two options you have option number"

"10747630","10753950"," option one for you if you have that bearish viewpoint right that's your that's one choice view"
"10753950","10759590"," second choice for you is the market must roll over and trade down to all-time lows again but all "
"10759590","10766070","-time but to new lows down to 400 or or three nine year whatever those are your only two options"
"10766070","10770910"," if you're a bull right now bull right and you bought that bottle that last bit that last big bottom"
"10770910","10777730"," right if you're a bull right now you have four options on the table you have four you can hope"
"10777730","10783610"," and pray that we trade down to 400 so you can buy it once again it's option one option two"
"10783610","10793490"," you get a sweet sweet dip by at 438 right option three is that you confirm acceptance between"
"10793490","10802170"," 450 and 460 and you take the new trade from 450 to 460 and option four is we we test"
"10802170","10808610"," all-time highs so you have four choices as a bull right now you have four choices taking your"
"10808610","10813390"," profit off the table right now being cashing waiting for some confirmation to trade the next"
"10813390","10819150"," hundred points up to trade to all-time highs for to buy a dip down below at 438 or 400"
"10819150","10823630"," so I'm not that you can't buy puts and not that we can't get shorts not that we can't trade"
"10823630","10828930"," down at 438 or confirm all the way down to 400 but a few of a viewpoint to the market"
"10828930","10836790"," right now no matter where we trade to you're better off right now from my viewpoint as a bull 100 "
"10836790","10846350","% and there's nothing no arguments out there that defeats that argument for currently where we are"
"10846350","10854750"," on the market right now there just isn't just isn't an argument against that viewpoint so if you"
"10854750","10861070"," bought the bottom my personal thing to say to you would be take the money and run and wait for"
"10861070","10866290"," acceptance between 450 and 460 and then ride that next hundred points up then I would take that"
"10866290","10870870"," profit you an actively manager portfolio and then I would then I would take that and then if we did"
"10870870","10876190"," we attack 460 I would say yes if you're a bull hedge the market wait for us to trade over"
"10876190","10881450"," 460 and then re-enter right and you say well I cap I don't want to actively manage my account"
"10881450","10887470"," or my my portfolio I'm gonna say to you because you don't need to win it all you don't need"
"10887470","10893090"," all the entire trade this is the same for the bears right you can wait until we get above 460"
"10893090","10898990"," to long the market if your viewpoint is we're gonna make all-time highs again cap we're gonna we're"
"10898990","10903750"," gonna slow the rates of growth but the markets going up for the next two years or three years well"

"12352660","12358200"," loading up so if you guys are with me right now the cool part about this is that it gets"
"12358200","12364700"," it gets way down here now here be example where the trade wouldn't have worked right this is"
"12364700","12371860"," February 28th of 2020 it would have taken you until May 28th of 2020 to take to get that money"
"12371860","12377900"," so that is a concern right that we own time it right so we should make some rules for ourselves"
"12377900","12383840"," so if we if we so I guess if we start to roll the actual market over so let's say"
"12383840","12388780"," the only time I've seen it where it hasn't worked for any period of time is actually would have"
"12388780","12394660"," worked it would have worked for the first the first bull rally down here to be honest with you"
"12394660","12404280"," it would"
"12404280","12412680"," have 34 it's like 200 points we would have figured that so we would have figured that even so even"
"12412680","12418160"," in this this is kind of crazy it's kind of wild we would have already taken profit at this point"
"12418160","12423000"," on a call spread here so I think this would have worked even then because there's a ceiling on how"
"12423000","12428200"," much you can make a new call spread it's like a 200 point rip here when we tagged down below"
"12428200","12436280"," here 200 point rip we still would have taken profit so it's either time or or you're sealing a"
"12436280","12441380"," profit so my my assumption is you would have actually won that trade and you would have won this"
"12441380","12449680"," trade down below here because down here right somewhere down in here you would have within a month"
"12449680","12454100"," hit your target up here somewhere so I think it I think it's I don't think it's I don't think"
"12454100","12458520"," you can fail in this trade I don't think that I think the chance of you failing if you follow"
"12458520","12465880"," the rules when you wait for these huge dips down here I think that you have a better chance and"

"12679480","12684440"," you why I don't fuck with cult stocks like I'll buy cult stocks but why don't short cult stocks and"
"12684440","12690000"," I want to show you something about why especially with Tesla doing a better job of trading against"
"12690000","12699980"," the spy and the cues and NASDAQ you could use this indicator here to trade Tesla using"
"12699980","12706140"," it on NASDAQ and S&P 500 this indicator someone yesterday said I remember who somebody said it"
"12706140","12712740"," works great on Tesla and it actually doesn't work that good on Tesla I want to show you where it"
"12712740","12717560"," didn't okay I want to show you where it didn't work well on Tesla and it's right in this area"
"12717560","12721580"," right here I think maybe it's not maybe it's back here we're gonna take a look at Tesla on a"
"12721580","12726040"," year chart I'm gonna show you why it doesn't or when it doesn't work that's loading up right now"
"12726040","12733430"," and there is some fear some severe selling it was either back here or back here it didn't do a"
"12733430","12739070"," good job but what this also proves with this also another report here saying US officials"
"12739070","12743590"," considering another relief from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve but nothing has been decided yet"
"12743590","12750690"," some sources I want to see here in January 1st right if you've gotten this indicator here you would"
"12750690","12756730"," have thought to yourself fuck yeah I should buy this right this is a rare rare occurrence and so"
"12756730","12760990"," you've been trading up and looking right here you're at the top right here and then it rolls right"
"12760990","12768290"," over okay down here do you see that so it really doesn't work well in Tesla and the reason why"
"12768290","12774450"," it doesn't work well in Tesla is often because Tesla trades on its own because this is based on"
"12774450","12783630"," this is based upon all these different sectors against Tesla right do you see what I'm saying and"
"12783630","12788250"," the other reason is because buyers just buy fucking Tesla they don't give a fuck but this is based"
"12788250","12796710"," on sectors you see how it says utilities tech real estate materials right see finance and energy"
"12796710","12805590"," and whatever else is down there so this indicator is not meant for Tesla this is meant for market"
"12805590","12813570"," for the market at large and specifically the spot so if you're going to use this indicator what I"
"12813570","12818110"," would say to you is that yeah I'd only use it on the S only use it on the spy"
"12818110","12824950"," or SPX even a better one be honest with you that SPX is probably best for this indicator how about"
"12824950","12833270"," use this uses indicator specifically on the spy and India and the X we have looking really bearish"
"12833270","12839590"," on spy right now that's looking uber-duer bears right there so anyways we're gonna use that we're"
"12839590","12849540"," gonna follow we're gonna follow that and that'll be part of our call spread challenge and just be"
"12849540","12854880"," aware that indicators matter of fact what you do right is go on your phone and make an alarm for"
"12854880","12861420"," yourself go on Google and make an alarm and just say do an alert every day or at least have"

"20639200","20645380"," expectations were something like this and then i move higher tomorrow staying in the trading range"

"20650280","20655260"," strong uh if you're like hey cap you didn't call the top on friday we're burning on monday morning"
"20655260","20660000"," down here at 440 or 438 uh you've already got my call for what i think is going to happen"
"20660000","20667480"," into monday uh so i'm still bullish here uh but i do think we are weak into monday i think"
"20667480","20673440"," we need to be weak if you're bullish uh into monday i think it's required for us to go head"
"20673440","20677840"," higher uh even if it's for the briefest moments that we trade lower i don't i don't know if it's"
"20677840","20683320"," like 438 or 440 comes into play in after hours or on sunday or some shit the reason i'm thinking"
"20683320","20687500"," it is so you get the VIX higher and then you can uh you have something to buy to send"
"20687500","20693680"," it up higher uh so that bulls have something they want to buy so that's my overall thesis i think"
"20693680","20697300"," the but the market is going to continue higher i think we trade up to 450 not to get to"
"20697300","20701660"," 460 i think if you look at lower lows and higher highs and lower lows and like us to be"
"20701660","20707240"," shit uh we've we've come there at this point so uh i'm going to give the give the the advantage"
"20707240","20712680"," to the bulls i know that the credit market is not matching right now i get that point um we"
"20712680","20718440"," can see weakness with that being used as news uh into monday that's fine too if you want to take"
"20718440","20722320"," this short into money it's probably a pretty fair bet to an extent unless you get some positive"
"20722320","20729380"," headline news um but i think even the bulls want uh some some some profit taking and then a higher"
"20729380","20733500"," VIX so the VIX can be slammed down i don't think the VIX goes below 20 to get to 460"
