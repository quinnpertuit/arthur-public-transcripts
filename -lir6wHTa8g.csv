"24700","34450"," Whenever I come back, I'm like, oh, all my settings are reset."
"34810","41070"," Windows 11 is a little too insightful what they think I want. "
"47140","47820"," Uh oh."
"60320","60820"," Hey, good morning."
"60960","61320"," How y'all doing?"
"62300","68700"," A lot of air a second. "
"69420","77380"," Good morning, everybody."
"81200","82060"," Just taking air."
"90520","92680"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. "
"96470","98570"," We got a bunch of stuff here going to do in the background."
"99170","99890"," Give me just a second here."
"115740","116200"," Customization. "
"119210","119670"," Members."
"122010","125700"," How y'all doing out there?"
"131890","133390"," All right, let's get right into it."
"133630","134550"," So just call. "
"134770","138710"," I just got the phone with I believe Wink or Winky and Joe Donut."
"139490","141850"," Getting a little squeeze here right off the off this morning."
"141850","144770"," Name of the video this morning is when trend day. "
"145970","148910"," If you look at that this morning, see if we can get a nice quick bounce."
"151110","152330"," See if it can confirm."
"152610","154910"," Where are they going to confirm one or two things this morning?"
"156150","161050"," What is going on with my, uh, some serious wonkiness going on?"
"161650","163070"," Hold on air a second. "
"163070","165250"," There we go."
"166950","168910"," Serious wonkiness going on there this morning."
"170030","174770"," So we've got a trend day possibility going on here on the open this morning. "
"174770","177410"," Just want to let you know that right away off the opening bell."
"182430","185570"," Uh, we're going to see if this takes place or not."
"186270","190330"," We've got the hourly trigger above at 433 75 ish. "
"190570","191210"," So right in here."
"192310","194230"," See if this turns into a trend day."
"194850","195790"," We just second here. "
"195870","196070"," We're going to."
"196530","197990"," There's a couple of things we have to go over."
"197990","202250"," Uh, before you know, we don't have a confirmed trend day this morning. "
"203350","204790"," Uh, it is beginning of the week."
"205050","206190"," Here is your hourly trigger."
"207830","210870"," The JPM caller is down here where this orange. "
"212730","214250"," Uh, line is down here."
"214330","217610"," I don't know why it doesn't say JPM, JPM caller, but it's right there."
"218250","223350"," Uh, we've got a my target down below here and we've got the daily trigger down here. "
"223670","225850"," We're very, we're getting close to it as the point."
"225850","233310"," And we can also see some kind of a squeeze play or trend day play this morning."
"234530","238430"," Uh, that still reverses to the downside into end of weeks. "
"238690","240170"," Just keep your eye on this right now."
"241210","243510"," You've got the opening bell trade that goes up."
"243510","246550"," You've got a bull plane already forming right now. "
"247350","252150"," And expect some kind of reversal and we'll see if we can get up here and make this day happen."
"252150","255649"," There is a trap in here for bulls."
"255930","256610"," So just be careful. "
"259390","260250"," Give me just a second."
"260350","261270"," I got a couple things I got to do."
"269100","272960"," Nice, nice label for the video this morning. "
"272960","273760"," Give me just a second here."
"276320","277540"," I hope you all had a great weekend."
"277820","278780"," I went out and saw. "
"279640","281600"," I got some program notes."
"281840","282960"," I have to go over where the guys today."
"286100","286660"," Cues. "
"287700","289180"," Probably take a look at meta."
"289180","289880"," I guess today."
"290580","291880"," The Tesla today. "
"293740","294300"," Yes."
"299380","302560"," And I've got a few things that need to tell you before you even get started here."
"305020","309820"," So first I am losing power at my house intermittently. "
"312140","315580"," So if you're, let me, before I do this, I'll, um."
"318710","322130"," Before I talk here, I'm going to post this so that I get everybody."
"324670","330830"," So that I make sure everybody's here so I can, uh, I'll say a second or third time. "
"336110","337030"," Okay, we're done."
"338970","340890"," I'm going to post that there."
"341490","341890"," All right. "
"348990","349730"," That's all done."
"350170","350830"," That's all done."
"352550","352950"," Okay. "
"353170","353570"," So a few things."
"354010","355930"," Well, we'll look at, let's look at a couple of things here."
"359870","362570"," We're trying to, what is going on?"
"367170","368390"," Pain in my ass. "
"369350","373210"," Do when you come back on a Monday, it's like never ending story."
"374970","375670"," It's changed."
"376030","376370"," That's changed. "
"377550","377750"," Okay."
"381770","383230"," We set that right there."
"386920","389060"," A few things we're going to look at here this morning. "
"390640","392600"," Uh, we're going to look at a bunch of stuff for the rest of the week."
"395520","396700"," First of all, welcome back."
"396860","399180"," If you're just joining us right now, welcome back from your weekend. "
"399380","404100"," We're walking into a nice vacation week for a lot of people."
"404280","406740"," People probably already taking off the vacation at this point."
"407480","410260"," Uh, I know if I wasn't streaming, I'd be on vacation myself. "
"410260","417060"," So I'm going to assume that people are trying to get on some form of vacation as the week"
"417060","417500"," progresses."
"418480","424060"," We have end of month flows, of course, people watching for the JPM caller coming out on Friday."
"424540","426280"," Right off the opening bell, I've got a nice bounce. "
"426480","430460"," Got a bull plane right here, forming right on the opening bell."
"430680","433000"," A lot of our trend days start like this."
"433660","436160"," Uh, they look just like this in the pre market. "
"436160","438100"," It ends up becoming apparent."
"439180","442120"," Uh, as the day progresses, you can see it right here."
"442520","443680"," This is a one minute chart. "
"444100","446960"," You've got the bull plane right off the one minute right here."
"447000","451220"," We're going to look to see if there's a check back on the five minute."
"451680","455240"," And possibly a continuation higher or if we just break above. "
"455940","457840"," Uh, the hourly trigger and start going."
"458020","459720"," We'll talk about why we can do that."
"460160","463440"," Uh, this morning is a place to take some money here. "
"463440","467840"," And if you're looking to get the next part of this trade, it's above and then a consolidation"
"467840","468560"," higher."
"469100","470720"," Uh, so it takes them off the table."
"470720","472420"," The losses trading flat now. "
"472740","475960"," And so just looking at the S&P extending these gains following the open."
"476240","476980"," Yeah, baby."
"477260","480440"," Uh, we've got R1 to the upside. "
"482460","482900"," 43469."
"485540","490280"," Today I'm mute some of this, uh, book map stuff."
"492320","495320"," We've got to return to the scene of the crime over here in the left hand side. "
"495360","495960"," You'll see this one."
"496140","497820"," We've got a giant gap left behind."
"498180","504680"," We already know that to the upside, all of the gains to the downside have been, uh, in low"
"504680","505980"," liquidity environments. "
"506300","511320"," We also know that cash market is being bought relentlessly and ferociously."
"512159","516960"," We also know that big money is entering the market has been for the past two or three weeks."
"516960","520400"," Look into an analyst note regarding this market move so far. "
"520700","522880"," So investors have been growing more anxious."
"523179","525440"," The central banks are determined to extinguish inflation."
"526220","528120"," We'll keep pushing rates higher and risk. "
"528280","530740"," I'm going to mute this guy because nothing he says means anything."
"532380","535480"," Uh, so we've got the daily trigger down below."
"535880","537200"," We're so close to it, right?"
"537480","540280"," That there's going to be, we're going to be reactive as we get close to it. "
"540720","543580"," It's currently sitting at 428 27."
"544140","547600"," Uh, so it's right down here."
"547860","551300"," I'd still like to see us at least get down here. "
"552660","555400"," And test this daily trigger."
"556160","559340"," Uh, I'm not sure we can get to the weekly trigger at this point."
"559380","564300"," Maybe in July, there'll be a moment of weakness where you can get down here to this daily or the"
"564300","565480"," weekly trigger. "
"566140","571460"," We also have the magnet, the pin down here at fourth and spy, at least it's 431 58."
"572020","574280"," It's 43 20 on SPX."
"575000","577380"," Remember the gap above starting to squeeze above. "
"577460","579900"," We got a three trigger cluster coming up right now."
"580100","586000"," We're at the bottom of hourly velocity and a 30 minute chart looking to push higher today and make"
"586000","587080"," this a trend day."
"588180","589300"," Uh, to the upside. "
"589960","592920"," Uh, maybe a failure to close all this crap gap above."
"604950","608730"," Now we do have some stuff to go over."
"608730","612170"," Number one, uh, we've had some pretty nasty. "
"612170","620610"," I don't know if you know where I live, but where I live, we get nasty thunderstorms and none of"
"620610","625190"," our power lines are buried, which sucks."
"625690","628630"," Uh, I haven't experienced this my entire life."
"628870","634050"," Most of my adult life I've lived in the West and our lines are buried. "
"634790","640350"," So I moved to Michigan and Michigan is like, uh, fuck you."
"640550","642550"," We need to, we need to keep people employed."
"642570","646430"," I don't know exactly what they're doing, but they like to piss away money. "
"646710","655010"," And this state specifically, this state specifically likes to, uh, I don't know, rebuild their"
"655010","656810"," power lines every fucking year or something."
"657910","662550"," So, uh, with that said, I came back from a trip over the weekend."
"662550","666050"," And I lost power in the first hour I was home. "
"666510","668710"," It's been back on and off for the past two days."
"669590","671150"," I lost power last night."
"671550","674330"," Uh, I expect to possibly lose it again this morning. "
"674970","677310"," There's supposedly more storms coming through today."
"677850","682530"," Uh, there's like 60,000 people around me that have or have not, or not don't have power."
"682870","685550"," So if I lose power with you this morning, I have a generator. "
"686510","691630"," Uh, that does give me power, but not, uh, to everything in my home."
"691630","696590"," It gives me power to my air con and my refrigeration and all that kind of stuff."
"697550","701490"," Uh, and I cannot run my entire office off of that generator. "
"702110","703630"," Uh, so just a heads up to that."
"703690","707950"," If you see me lose power at any point today, it's not like, uh, something that's unexpected."
"709310","711050"," Squeezing it hard now above the hourly trigger. "
"711430","712690"," We've got a target above."
"713990","717990"," First target above the close, this stuff up is right here."
"718790","719910"," Right where we are right now. "
"720470","721710"," I'm just going to show you that."
"723330","725050"," This is the first gap right here."
"725790","727110"," The second gap is above it. "
"728150","731230"," And then of course you've got the big giant air gap above that."
"731710","734710"," Already trending on the opening bell trade 43409."
"743170","745330"," So that's the first note for today. "
"746230","748730"," Uh, which is I could lose power this morning."
"751430","754950"," Target one hit looking for target two at 43469."
"755370","763130"," Then we've got 43403 and we've got 43618 and then 43658 to the upside. "
"775910","778550"," Next you're going to take a look at the spy on the trigger."
"782920","785860"," This is the first break that we've had above."
"787820","789980"," The trigger in some time, right?"
"789980","794960"," We've had a rollover of the highs for 2023. "
"795700","799340"," We had one day we broke above and we confirmed the move higher."
"799520","800900"," I want you to pay attention to this here."
"803640","806660"," It's a 30 minute chart and I want you to see a couple things here. "
"807680","809260"," You have the break above right."
"810080","811300"," We changed the color here."
"814140","815860"," You have the initial break above. "
"816700","821760"," We come back down and test that hourly and we make a nice run higher."
"822560","824920"," Now we did meet some resistance above."
"826000","828320"," A failed attempt to trend even higher. "
"829020","832800"," You can see this initial bump now above the hourly trigger."
"833740","837280"," And what you're looking for is a retest below."
"837880","839460"," So we'll look at a one minute chart real quick. "
"840780","844380"," I'm going to show this to you on a lower time frame here."
"844380","847000"," And we're squeezing right now."
"847060","848720"," I'm going to show you a couple targets to the upside. "
"851920","858600"," This one right here, that's that 434.65. You've got all of this crap up here to close out."
"860600","867200"," That's 436.64. And yeah, I think that's all right there."
"867360","871880"," Now the key point that I want to say to you is you're going to be looking for some kind"
"871880","881200"," of a like come up here, slam down, retest this hourly, have the one and the five come up and"
"881200","882420"," kind of push you even higher. "
"883420","888860"," I also want to pay attention to the fact that the one minute is near vertical right now."
"889000","889880"," It's extremely bullish."
"890220","892580"," It's not it's not coming up sideways like this. "
"893280","895460"," It's at a nice extreme angle to the upside."
"896660","898860"," Five minutes at a pretty decent clip as well."
"900780","908260"," So if you've missed this run at all, you'll look back for a retest at 433.81. See if you"
"908260","909260"," can jump on board. "
"913420","915780"," And there it is right there that hourly trigger."
"916360","919640"," Hopefully you can jump on the train back here and it pulls back for you."
"920260","924440"," Target to the upside 434.69 on spy. "
"924440","932980"," So I spent the weekend with my man, wiki."
"934360","939000"," And my man Joe Donut lost a foot this weekend or something."
"939000","940940"," And so he had said, I wish I was there. "
"942120","945060"," It's probably bad con race like I should have just gone to the show."
"945700","952320"," We went and saw Jamie XX and LCD sound system."
"953220","954600"," Met his lovely wife. "
"954600","957500"," And we went out to dinner in a small."
"959020","961620"," Really nice town, a place called Dublin, Ohio."
"962280","964760"," Had a nice cobblestone street. "
"965540","968300"," Some great little restaurants ate a bunch of oysters."
"968680","970700"," They had a bunch of mussels, a bunch of seafood and stuff."
"972160","976100"," drank some great cocktails, some bubbles, some champagne, some champers. "
"977500","978480"," Then went to this show."
"979680","982040"," It's kind of funny too because at the end of the night."
"983560","987520"," I didn't, I left at like 130 or two in the morning. "
"988380","991980"," And I stopped at a waffle house at like 233 in the morning."
"993240","996360"," And I didn't know, I forgot how young I was."
"996580","999780"," I think there's like a waffle house in the highway and then the waffle house in your town. "
"1000720","1004520"," And the waffle house in your town has got a lot of kids in it that time of night."
"1005660","1007940"," So I was, I was like, I can't go in there."
"1007940","1010060"," It was like everybody looks like they're 21 years old. "
"1010100","1010700"," They can't go in there."
"1012080","1016120"," So I ate Taco Bell and I haven't had Taco Bell in fucking years."
"1017060","1021060"," I felt embarrassed going into a waffle house at 230 in the morning. "
"1022600","1023460"," At any rate."
"1024079","1025079"," Now the show is outstanding."
"1025619","1028599"," Winky, if you're out there watching right now at a wonderful time. "
"1029200","1030599"," I brought my wife out with me."
"1031420","1034579"," And my wife met Winky and his wife."
"1035280","1037740"," And we did last band, dance our asses off. "
"1039640","1042359"," The, the concert was a great venue."
"1042359","1046220"," And then of course Columbus, I didn't know was such a nice place either."
"1047440","1048900"," For, you know, like middle America. "
"1049560","1053000"," It was everything you'd want in a nice town, a nice small town."
"1053140","1058020"," They had a bunch of different like a arts district and sporting events going on."
"1058280","1061120"," I mean, if you had, no matter what you were doing, if you had something to do that weekend in"
"1061120","1061380"," Columbus. "
"1062040","1064660"," That city was popping like any other city out there."
"1064740","1068660"," I mean, they had supporting events, music events, community events going on."
"1068980","1070440"," The city was jam packed. "
"1071300","1072000"," Clean city."
"1073080","1074480"," And people seemed happy."
"1074960","1076020"," So I was impressed. "
"1076240","1077260"," I hadn't been to Columbus and."
"1078740","1079800"," Oh, I don't know."
"1080120","1081300"," A couple decades. "
"1081980","1083000"," And to me, it looked great."
"1085240","1089740"," And anyways, got fulfilled the dream to see them and had never seen them in my entire life."
"1090480","1093840"," I've got a checklist of some bands I've missed and I saw them. "
"1094140","1095780"," And it was fucking awesome."
"1096560","1099800"," Of course, then head back to Michigan and we lost power."
"1100220","1103560"," Or intermittently, we're losing power. "
"1106280","1110360"," Just got a nice check back here on our early, early trigger."
"1112440","1113560"," On spoos."
"1115160","1116660"," We've a lot to go over here. "
"1116660","1120580"," We've got a ton of stuff here to go over into the end of this week."
"1121980","1125460"," We've got a lot of, like, just a ton of crap to go over on the economic calendar."
"1126120","1128220"," There's a few things you need to know heading into today. "
"1129300","1131460"," We're not going to get into the Russia stuff just now."
"1131960","1133480"," We will get into the Russia stuff."
"1133820","1135940"," If you'd like, if you want me to, I'll get into the Russia stuff. "
"1137000","1138220"," But things you need to be looking for."
"1141180","1142360"," Let's see what we got here."
"1145020","1149280"," Yeah, we have broken eight week winning streak recently, right?"
"1151480","1153060"," What else we got going on here?"
"1153660","1160540"," Data points this week are going to shape the path of markets, including consumer confidence. "
"1161200","1162540"," New home sales on Tuesday."
"1163000","1164520"," Those should be good, believe it or not."
"1165540","1166580"," Pending home sales. "
"1166840","1168100"," I'm not expecting those to be bad."
"1168680","1170520"," We had some bad home sales in the spring."
"1170520","1173420"," But those numbers were from before. "
"1175460","1177700"," There is a little bit of leveling off."
"1178140","1180840"," I read something where it was kind of odd."
"1181000","1185580"," I read a story this morning on Reddit that talked about. "
"1187180","1188820"," Let me see if I can find this here."
"1189660","1194980"," I read a story on Reddit this morning that left me scratching my head."
"1196760","1199260"," Let me see if I can find this really quick because it's kind of neat. "
"1200080","1205460"," You know, Reddit's a weird place to find this here."
"1209400","1210320"," Something about."
"1214660","1215760"," You're alone here. "
"1220300","1225120"," You don't always know, even when it's not being asked for a turf, you don't always know who's"
"1225120","1225560"," talking."
"1226820","1228360"," Like who the voice is, right?"
"1229660","1230440"," You can find this here."
"1231580","1232600"," Look at my history. "
"1243350","1246470"," Now, sometimes I like Reddit for some insight."
"1247850","1249470"," See if I can find this."
"1258240","1259380"," Come on now. "
"1264580","1266280"," I'm looking through my search history."
"1266420","1269100"," I'm like, I'm like man with banana hammock."
"1269960","1271540"," Jerome Powell at parties. "
"1271860","1273040"," I can do my thumbnail this morning."
"1284580","1285780"," Yeah, this is the."
"1289100","1291240"," This is what I want to show you this this morning. "
"1291240","1293620"," This is on the topic of home sales."
"1300550","1302890"," There's an avocado toast comment in here too."
"1304910","1309350"," Yeah, it's always bizarre when you read this stuff and then you dig a little bit deeper and you"
"1309350","1311850"," find out that it's not exactly what people are saying. "
"1312450","1314370"," This isn't what I talk about this often."
"1316570","1319870"," Like the Budweiser story, right?"
"1320150","1322150"," Or the Tyson foods story."
"1332610","1336270"," I'm trying to compare like decipher what the information actually means. "
"1337190","1338750"," I didn't get some of this here."
"1339010","1339870"," What am I looking for here?"
"1341010","1342030"," Come on now."
"1360540","1362800"," I'm not prepared to go through this, but I'm gonna. "
"1370040","1370960"," There we go."
"1372600","1373880"," So this is fascinating."
"1376500","1378360"," And mute this here for a minute. "
"1379220","1381800"," It's time of new home sales, home sales, all that kind of stuff."
"1382820","1386060"," So you have a story coming out here that says."
"1387420","1391220"," You know, eviction filings are 50% higher than they were. "
"1392060","1392960"," Pre pandemic."
"1395320","1398340"," In some cities as rents rise."
"1400160","1401480"," Right, rents rise. "
"1401840","1402520"," Everything is bad."
"1403640","1405300"," That's the news story from the AP."
"1407720","1409560"," And of course I'm reading. "
"1411560","1418480"," The headlight are the comments section here from Reddit and you know, you can kind of trust some of"
"1418480","1418880"," this stuff."
"1420740","1422000"," To an extent."
"1423680","1429360"," But there's usually more to pierce in the veil from the from the from the this is the actual"
"1429360","1430400"," article that was in Reddit. "
"1430760","1436880"," It was in the it was in news that the title of the story is eviction filings are 50%"
"1436880","1441480"," higher than they were pre pandemic in some cities as rents rise and people complain in here."
"1442120","1444700"," Rightly so people complain."
"1445260","1447940"," So you have to like try to pierce the veil here. "
"1448740","1451760"," And there's a there's a talk out there right now that."
"1453920","1457660"," Salaries are are catching up with inflation."
"1458260","1462780"," To combat this and I've been on phone calls with friends that are saying. "
"1463240","1468240"," I have to pay more to my employees or I have to."
"1469040","1474340"," I wasn't hiring and now I'm some coming to it and I have to compete at a price that I"
"1474340","1474920"," can't afford."
"1474920","1476420"," So I have to pass this along to my customers. "
"1477600","1485480"," And so initially reading this news story, it seems pretty bad reading the discussion in here seems"
"1485480","1486240"," pretty bad."
"1487560","1491940"," And then so I'll topically it starts to make you wonder like how bad is it going to be."
"1492820","1494240"," Our house is selling. "
"1495700","1498440"," You know, we head towards the cliff right now."
"1498640","1500480"," What's going on, right?"
"1500660","1501320"," What am I being fed?"
"1501580","1501980"," What am I consuming?"
"1503300","1511400"," What kind of cool it am I drinking with that story and then and then of course the comments, right?"
"1511980","1513480"," And who's actually doing the commenting?"
"1514500","1516720"," What slice of the population is this?"
"1517380","1519980"," The comments are all valid to me."
"1520100","1521120"," We have a large country, right?"
"1521340","1526540"," People that are upset are more apt to say something in comments. "
"1528120","1530760"," So then I went to eviction lab."
"1531720","1540080"," And they tracked not every state, but a lot of states."
"1540900","1544260"," You can do this on your own go to eviction lab dot org. "
"1545680","1551840"," And if you look closely on this website here, there are some states that are rising."
"1553160","1559640"," But most are leveling off, if not rolling over in the rate of evictions."
"1560760","1566300"," So you're actually seeing the truth is that we may be as high as it's been, right?"
"1566880","1569980"," But most places are beginning to roll over. "
"1571340","1577720"," And so when you're seeing that, it's actually telling you, you know, it's not like."
"1579340","1586020"," It's not like, hey, look, evictions are on the rise, right?"
"1587680","1589340"," So this is bad."
"1589780","1592480"," We're going to price this in, right?"
"1593340","1599160"," It's that evictions are topping and coming down, right?"
"1600180","1602200"," We're not there yet, are we?"
"1602960","1606760"," But what do we do as we have high evictions rates, right?"
"1607180","1608540"," We begin to price that in. "
"1608980","1612580"," When we begin to roll over, we begin to price that in, right?"
"1612780","1614000"," A change in the curve."
"1615760","1622120"," So, you know, when I'm reading this stuff, I question, I question two or three things, right?"
"1622200","1622500"," A question."
"1624620","1625600"," What does it mean?"
"1626360","1626760"," Is it real?"
"1627080","1627500"," Is it fake?"
"1628000","1632840"," Is it, is it because they're at a top or a bottom in these things?"
"1633260","1639100"," And so reading that article this morning and then reading the traction that it got, what you don't"
"1639100","1642700"," want to see right now is, hey, eviction rates are high. "
"1642700","1645100"," And we're not plateauing."
"1645200","1646460"," We're not rolling over."
"1646760","1648880"," We're continuing higher right now, right?"
"1649100","1650920"," Or this is beginning. "
"1651700","1656320"," We're actually seeing this stuff roll over, seeing salaries catch back up."
"1656920","1660600"," People adjust to the higher costs that are out there."
"1662540","1667120"," And so just as just kind of a fascinating thing, because we have some of these figures coming out"
"1667120","1667600"," this week. "
"1668180","1670220"," The impact housing out there."
"1671200","1672440"," So you can go on your own."
"1672540","1673660"," It's evictionlab.org."
"1674340","1678720"," And then we are, we are topping in evictions in this country. "
"1679500","1680340"," You're topping."
"1680640","1681780"," We are not going higher."
"1682700","1686800"," We are flattening and starting to roll in most cases. "
"1693080","1694180"," In most cases."
"1694480","1701760"," So as we start to roll over, they'll begin to price in stability in our economy, stability in"
"1701760","1702060"," housing."
"1709500","1714100"," To have consumer confidence, that should improve if we have less invictions. "
"1715420","1716480"," We've got new home sales."
"1717000","1717960"," Then we have pending home sales."
"1718220","1719060"," We just discussed that. "
"1720020","1722440"," And then we get a third read on first quarter GDP."
"1724460","1725580"," I was in Columbus."
"1728020","1730000"," Money was no object. "
"1731220","1733680"," I spent a ton of money."
"1735020","1736180"," A ridiculous amount of money."
"1737040","1737800"," Nobody blinked. "
"1738800","1742040"," Every restaurant packed, every bar packed, every street packed."
"1743200","1744700"," I mean, packed."
"1745820","1747740"," People are out and about doing their thing. "
"1748700","1749660"," People are happy."
"1751080","1753460"," As far as I can see, people are working."
"1755180","1756780"," I didn't see empty streets. "
"1757160","1758680"," I didn't see for sale signs everywhere."
"1759760","1764160"," You got people out there with less than 3% mortgages and they're giggling and laughing."
"1764860","1768280"," They're like, I got my man just straight locked in. "
"1769200","1771500"," I guess we're hanging out here for 5 or 10 years."
"1776120","1780080"," It's like we're in this Goldilocks zone right now."
"1782220","1791880"," We also have the Russia revolt, the Russia coup, which you would expect to resolve itself within 72"
"1791880","1792340"," hours. "
"1792780","1793540"," No matter what happened."
"1793540","1796240"," You're going to expect some kind of a resolution."
"1796700","1798120"," Cues are kind of weird, right?"
"1799440","1801500"," They have to be fast. "
"1803980","1811680"," I read someone on Friday, someone wrote something like Pringles should go and pull up somewhere."
"1812760","1821220"," And I'm like, I don't think these people understand what a coup is, nor a dictatorship and power in"
"1821220","1821760"," a dictatorship."
"1823540","1826300"," So I'm going to give you guys a link to something. "
"1826560","1832380"," If you don't understand a lot of the dynamics of this, see if I can look at, I want to"
"1832380","1834660"," give you guys some cool to look at here."
"1835760","1842080"," If you don't understand the dynamics of a dictatorship oligarchy, maybe you want a base"
"1842080","1849720"," understanding of countries like North Korea, Russia, how they operate, how dictatorships operate."
"1850080","1851380"," Hold on here, I got to do this somewhere else. "
"1855690","1856890"," Just a second here."
"1863330","1866810"," I want you guys to know, do you know the Ray Dalio?"
"1871810","1874170"," When I said, hey, you guys need to watch this."
"1875670","1878010"," I'm like, I need you to watch Ray Dalio. "
"1879970","1886090"," Because most kids don't even get that education from their schooling."
"1887770","1888850"," Pull up here."
"1893920","1894710"," Everybody say they can. "
"1896710","1899130"," Hold on a second here."
"1906830","1907710"," Damn it."
"1908430","1911070"," I think tight a second here. "
"1923540","1925300"," Make everything so hard."
"1945390","1946570"," Just a second here."
"1961270","1964360"," So in your free time and want you to watch this. "
"1969320","1969960"," Oh, baby."
"1970120","1971140"," Let's trend it up, baby."
"1971240","1972640"," Let's trend it up. "
"1976580","1979420"," See if I can, uh, here's my comments in here."
"1980200","1983720"," I don't see comments in, uh, it's really odd."
"1983940","1985460"," I don't see comments in Twitch right now. "
"1991710","1993110"," Welcome to the chat room."
"1994330","1996670"," There's nobody chatting in Twitch this morning."
"1997430","1997930"," There we go. "
"2000210","2001210"," Okay, there we go."
"2001210","2003450"," So I just posted a link in."
"2004710","2008250"," In Twitch and here's a link for you in YouTube. "
"2008830","2011990"," You want to watch this in your own time because this gives you the idea."
"2013310","2014410"," Of structure."
"2018090","2022050"," For how a dictatorship is run. "
"2022970","2025890"," And it's very similar to what's going on in Russia."
"2031220","2033040"," Yeah, baby fucking print them all."
"2035580","2036140"," Okay. "
"2039720","2041240"," Huge five minute."
"2042560","2046080"," Two trigger cluster confirmation on the early trigger to the upside."
"2046900","2048340"," Tagging our one right now. "
"2051900","2057420"," So I want you to watch that video because just on the topic of this week's news, right?"
"2057580","2057860"," Russia."
"2058560","2063080"," If you can watch that video, I'll give you an idea of what to expect."
"2064199","2065320"," Even after this. "
"2066020","2067219"," Who has been quelled."
"2067900","2072940"," It shows you the power structures of like you need 10 of this and 10 of that and 10 of"
"2072940","2073060"," this."
"2073679","2076460"," He's likely Putin is likely going to clean some house. "
"2077139","2078500"," You can expect that."
"2079900","2086139"," If you if you like I know he killed already killed a bunch of oligarchs, but if you're even like"
"2086139","2087639"," on his, on his like, uh, like."
"2088500","2091600"," Definitely maybe possibly slight chance. "
"2091920","2093440"," The slight chance guys out of there."
"2094840","2100480"," On the Russia stuff and if you're going to have a coup, it's like first 72 hours like you get"
"2100480","2101040"," your quick chance."
"2101160","2102020"," You're in your out. "
"2102260","2105140"," It should resolve itself itself either way."
"2106340","2110680"," Either by Putin being removed, Pringle being taken out."
"2111160","2113640"," Even if he's still alive right now, he's done. "
"2114600","2118420"," He's taken a long walk down an elevator shaft with five bolts."
"2118700","2119820"," It is back, right?"
"2119960","2120600"," We already know that."
"2121560","2123840"," I've heard all the conspiracy theories are kind of wild. "
"2125560","2126440"," Who is involved?"
"2126920","2127420"," Who got paid?"
"2127680","2129920"," Who did the pay and all that kind of stuff?"
"2129920","2130560"," I assure you."
"2131320","2132700"," They're going to get them."
"2132940","2136840"," And if you watch that video, it'll help you understand some of the stuff behind that. "
"2137260","2139420"," And what's fascinating about what a dictator is."
"2140560","2146160"," They're not normally the strongest person or the most powerful powerful person in that government."
"2147000","2156100"," They're just the person that is pushed up front while some very strong oligarchs, industrialists,"
"2156440","2157960"," generals, powerful people, right?"
"2159580","2161440"," And politicians, a group, right?"
"2161560","2162040"," Three different groups. "
"2163000","2166400"," And they put this one person up in like, yeah, that's the bad guy."
"2166840","2173440"," The truth is, there's like, you know, another 30 very powerful individuals behind that very bad guy"
"2173440","2175560"," that are even more bad than he is."
"2178800","2183600"," Another thing to look forward to this week is that oil markets, right, over this Russia stuff. "
"2184820","2186780"," So pay attention to oil this week."
"2187400","2195800"," And then we have another big week here with the US top courts are going to rule on forgiving up"
"2195800","2202340"," to $20,000 of student debt loans, right?"
"2202560","2204780"," So is that QE, right, unlimited QE?"
"2207340","2214760"," And also we have Nike earnings this week and we have Jerome Powell going on a world tour for the"
"2214760","2215420"," 4th of July."
"2216000","2217640"," We have end of month flows. "
"2218420","2222420"," We've got the traditionally, maybe we can give me a heads up on this."
"2224100","2233840"," 86% of the time we trend right through into, we trend up into July 5th."
"2234400","2240500"," So everyone this week is like a shark looking for a dip to buy to the upside. "
"2240940","2245780"," One note I would make on that is we're in a low volatility environments."
"2247900","2253820"," It's a kind of thing where you pick your poison, you get yourself a spread and you show back up"
"2253820","2254320"," on Monday."
"2255240","2260100"," I think I told people on Friday, I said, it was like four o'clock in the afternoon and I"
"2260100","2263200"," said, well, there's not many of you left, so I'm going to tell you a secret. "
"2263200","2271540"," And I said, you know, place a call spread and you close it on the return, right, on the 5th."
"2271620","2273940"," You close it on the opening bell at that moment."
"2275080","2279000"," No matter what anybody tells you, right, if you were like going to the moon and people will, you"
"2279000","2284200"," come back on the 5th and people are like, yeah, bro, we're going to fucking, you know, triple all"
"2284200","2286220"," time high 6000 tomorrow, bro. "
"2286220","2289000"," You're just like, fuck you, or you're like, yeah, I definitely agree."
"2289560","2298700"," Take your money and run into on the 5th at 9.30. Normally that trade, I believe begins on"
"2298700","2299140"," Wednesday."
"2300700","2305480"," Maybe Winky can help out with that in the chat on Twitch and let us know, confirm that if that's"
"2305480","2306100"," the yes or no. "
"2306700","2309740"," It's like 86% of the time, I think, 90% of the time."
"2313070","2318690"," So, Winky is saying, oh, usually if you buy on Wednesday, the first day after the holiday gets you"
"2318690","2318950"," paid."
"2319370","2320510"," So, I got it wrong here, right?"
"2321390","2326910"," So, I've got the, I've got it down as 4th of July is like 86% of the time, it"
"2326910","2327390"," goes up. "
"2328270","2329470"," Winky is saying it's after."
"2331790","2334130"," Yeah, the first day of the market is open after, right?"
"2334990","2339370"," And I saw our volwiz yesterday was looking for some unclench after the 5th."
"2340570","2344130"," So, the unclench from the end of month flows. "
"2345050","2349490"," The window of weakness for July is after the 5th."
"2352570","2354450"," I'm gonna say I'm gonna drink some water here."
"2360450","2364270"," The other things to take note of this week would be Jerome Powell, right?"
"2364370","2365050"," He's making the rounds. "
"2365450","2371770"," He's got a speech on Wednesday at 9.30. And then he's got a 2.30 AM speech."
"2373650","2377910"," So, I'm sure everyone will be up trading futures on Jerome."
"2379010","2381230"," So, he's gonna be around the world doing his world tour. "
"2384910","2388290"," And then the only other note that I would make coming up, or I've got two more notes."
"2388510","2394950"," The next one would be that I believe, correct me if I'm wrong on this one, I believe on Monday,"
"2395030","2396170"," July 3rd."
"2397330","2397910"," It's a Monday?"
"2398350","2400170"," Yeah, I think it's Monday, July 3rd. "
"2401350","2402310"," We have a short day."
"2403030","2405170"," I'll confirm those hours right now."
"2412550","2417070"," Just to give you guys a heads up, so in case some nobody's told you, then we discussed these last"
"2417070","2417430"," week. "
"2423180","2424660"," Let's see if I got this right here."
"2426480","2430440"," Okay, so each market will close early at 1 PM."
"2432040","2437140"," 1.15 for eligible options, i.e. the spy. "
"2438700","2441940"," On Monday, July 3rd, 2023."
"2443660","2449200"," So, just a heads up that 1 PM, 1.15 for some of you."
"2451240","2454340"," All the national exchanges are going to close. "
"2458600","2466920"," It does say that something about some trading sessions will last until 5 PM."
"2467180","2473980"," Those might be the futures market might stay open until 5 PM."
"2473980","2475540"," I'll have to check on that and make sure. "
"2476100","2480260"," But you might still be able to trade blowbacks and stuff like that."
"2485200","2486980"," So, two trading days before."
"2493560","2496660"," The exact trade is two trading days before the 4th of July. "
"2498200","2500580"," So, that would put us into Friday then, right?"
"2501560","2503600"," There's like a story behind this story."
"2503980","2505420"," You guys know this story, right?"
"2505660","2510680"," Like retailers make up myths and shit, like fables and shit about this stuff, right?"
"2510680","2513820"," They're like, are the old people leaving for the weekend?"
"2514100","2514640"," Can we run it up?"
"2517300","2522320"," Then the old people come back from vacation and they slim it back down."
"2524180","2525960"," Retailers take over is what they say. "
"2529440","2530840"," Retailers are generally bullish."
"2532220","2534000"," Getting a nice test down here right now."
"2544470","2547170"," Yeah, it's actually based upon statistics. "
"2549130","2552130"," People that track what happens every year around this time."
"2552650","2554910"," We also know that we had a bad year last year."
"2556770","2562150"," So, if you have an average of 86% of the time, let's see. "
"2562250","2563830"," It was particularly this year."
"2564550","2568410"," If you have a, let's say you have an average of 86% of the time, something bullish happening."
"2569670","2573870"," And you had a down year the year before, your statistics actually go higher. "
"2574890","2581150"," Your probability of high probability bull trades goes up even more, generally speaking."
"2582450","2587130"," Just keep that in mind, wherever you're going to buy that dip, as today, is it on Friday, is it"
"2587130","2589050"," on Wednesday for next Monday?"
"2593810","2595230"," I think I got through all that stuff."
"2595890","2599090"," Next up on Wednesday of this week, so today's Monday. "
"2599450","2602710"," On Wednesday, the stream will be up, but I will not be here."
"2602710","2606330"," I have another presentation I have to do on Wednesday morning."
"2606950","2612570"," You might have me check in throughout the day with you, but I do have a bunch of stuff going"
"2612570","2612830"," on. "
"2612950","2615010"," I've got the devs are building a bunch of stuff."
"2615610","2618630"," We actually have more than one tool complete now, I think."
"2619210","2621930"," So, I was reviewing tools over the weekend as well. "
"2623270","2626030"," So, not only to have the trade, the trigger tool, we got a bunch of other tools."
"2626850","2628830"," One of the tools I looked at this week and was kind of cool."
"2630170","2632450"," It's for your levels every day. "
"2632990","2634090"," So, your pivot points."
"2635330","2644350"," We wrote a mathematical problem that I used to decide the levels every day."
"2644890","2651990"," I gave it to the developer and he ran a program on that, or developed a program for that, so"
"2651990","2654170"," you can come in every day in the morning. "
"2655270","2657650"," I don't know if I can show you a screenshot of this or not, but."
"2659130","2662650"," So, I think he did 11,000 tickers in real time."
"2664270","2667970"," 11,000 tickers in real time, you can search by name or symbol. "
"2668850","2675730"," And it'll give you your levels or your pivots for every one of those tickers each day."
"2676650","2678370"," And it'll chart them for you."
"2679290","2680810"," So, I was going through that yesterday. "
"2681370","2682850"," I spent a lot of time on that yesterday afternoon."
"2683590","2685270"," So, we had some really cool shit for you."
"2685450","2688230"," So, if you're like, ah, cap, I don't trade this or I cap, I trade that. "
"2688950","2690410"," And you watch your levels every day."
"2690630","2697250"," I'm hoping at some point I can do an integration where, let's say you're using training view."
"2697970","2700330"," It would import them into a table for you. "
"2700450","2701190"," We're not there yet."
"2702110","2705950"," But hopefully, if you're like, hey, I trade GME."
"2706250","2707250"," What are my pivots for the day?"
"2707850","2712490"," I'm going to go straight into a training view and you'd have like an R1, R2, R3. "
"2712490","2713990"," S1, S2, S3."
"2714910","2715790"," That's kind of neat."
"2717310","2718450"," Almost done with that. "
"2718690","2719430"," It looks really cool."
"2723930","2725930"," Automatically done for you every single day."
"2726030","2729610"," I know some people out there will send you levels every month. "
"2730570","2732950"," But you can get them for anything you want."
"2733190","2733790"," It's like instant."
"2734070","2735350"," You just log in, do your thing. "
"2736210","2736910"," And you're off and running."
"2738310","2739390"," That's really cool."
"2748110","2750110"," So I've got presentations on Wednesday. "
"2750550","2752030"," I won't be here on Friday."
"2752250","2753070"," Let me just write this up."
"2753430","2755110"," I'm just going to put it on here so you guys know. "
"2756170","2758410"," So I want to make sure you guys know what's going on."
"2758830","2769230"," So I'll just do"
"2769230","2770190"," this all over again."
"2774330","2774730"," CJJ. "
"2778390","2779270"," It's a Wednesday."
"2780990","2806570"," It's a"
"2806570","2807350"," 28th, right?"
"2821700","2822860"," CJJJ will be in a meeting."
"2866490","2872120"," And I'm just going to bring that one up. "
"2872400","2872800"," There you go."
"2874320","2878380"," So the Wednesday stream will be up."
"2878940","2880020"," I will not be here. "
"2880080","2881080"," I'm going to an office."
"2881400","2883000"," I have to do a presentation."
"2884280","2885760"," For the stuff that we're doing. "
"2888000","2890860"," And Friday is the beginning of my vacation."
"2891220","2892640"," I have not taken a vacation."
"2893800","2897880"," I've had taken normal market like we have a weekend off or something like that. "
"2898440","2900920"," I've done that stuff, but I haven't taken a proper vacation."
"2902500","2904600"," I believe in over a year, maybe longer."
"2905240","2908000"," My wife takes those vacations, but I don't. "
"2908000","2911440"," So I have not taken a vacation myself."
"2912640","2914220"," And it's quite some time."
"2914380","2915680"," Didn't take a vacation during Christmas. "
"2916320","2918720"," Thanksgiving, any of that kind of stuff."
"2918940","2921460"," So I will not be here."
"2923620","2926640"," This is my other issue too here is that I'm traveling. "
"2927420","2934100"," So if I turn a stream on on Friday morning, I will have no way to turn it off as"
"2934100","2936240"," I travel on Friday."
"2936240","2941760"," So like run all morning at like 7 a.m. and then like run into the nighttime before I get"
"2941760","2943280"," a chance to turn it off for you."
"2943420","2944760"," So Friday, there will be no stream. "
"2946040","2948420"," Maybe we can get somebody to do something in the discord."
"2949920","2959360"," Maybe maybe maybe one of the admins in discord, John or Ravology or Rob or Binky or maybe even"
"2959360","2964240"," David AMS could run something for the discord on Friday."
"2965040","2967240"," If anyone wants to volunteer for that. "
"2977800","2981080"," But no stream on Friday due to travel."
"2982820","2985820"," And that's for 4th of July weekend."
"2988560","2991260"," So a lot going on summertime going on. "
"2994680","2998980"," Yeah, well, you know what sucks too is I'm hoping to put a trade on that day."
"2999480","3001040"," Like today when's like not."
"3001380","3002040"," I have it. "
"3002160","3002960"," I just took a trade off."
"3003160","3006120"," But I mean, like I want a 4th of July trade."
"3008100","3009680"," And I don't know if it's today. "
"3010060","3013580"," I don't know if it's Wednesday or if it's Friday."
"3013580","3018220"," And how do I guess how do I determine if it's today Wednesday or Friday?"
"3018360","3019600"," Maybe we'll talk about that right now."
"3021500","3025600"," We'll take a look and see what determines that trade. "
"3025900","3028120"," And we'll talk about that right now because of where we are."
"3029340","3037080"," It's important for us to have an idea of what we're talking about here."
"3045070","3046750"," So let's take a look here. "
"3050010","3052030"," So you can kind of see here, right?"
"3052550","3054110"," I mean, this might not be the best thing."
"3054490","3055290"," Let me do SPX."
"3058970","3061190"," So here's your collar down here, okay?"
"3061450","3062130"," This is SPX. "
"3063770","3068790"," On a 5-minute chart on the collar, you can usually get multi-day trends."
"3071390","3071870"," Right?"
"3072030","3075250"," We know there's a magnet here for the 30th, right?"
"3075690","3076010"," In the Friday."
"3076370","3076970"," There's a magnet here. "
"3078470","3079870"," We know there's a magnet there."
"3080670","3085090"," We know that there's a big old giant fucking bull flag."
"3086850","3089510"," We know that the daily trigger is somewhere down in here. "
"3090670","3091150"," Right?"
"3091310","3094610"," So this doesn't seem irrational to look for for a dip buy into this week."
"3095610","3096370"," It seems logical."
"3100520","3101900"," Is it higher though?"
"3102260","3103520"," Do they front-run it?"
"3104160","3105780"," Is that the plan front-run it, right?"
"3105940","3106940"," We miss it on Monday?"
"3108080","3109060"," Is it on Wednesday?"
"3109480","3109960"," Is it on Friday?"
"3109960","3110920"," And then we go up?"
"3111740","3115040"," I'm sure that most people are looking for this at this point. "
"3115400","3116720"," I'm assuming you are."
"3119760","3122240"," And it usually lasts multi-day, right?"
"3122720","3124720"," You usually put a trade on and walk away from it."
"3124780","3130000"," You can get like a one month, a three month close them out for a few days later. "
"3130240","3131640"," We got some roll over here."
"3132000","3134280"," Got a nice put spread on."
"3134460","3135920"," You got a nice short on the market. "
"3136680","3138940"," You've got something that's paying you in here."
"3139860","3140380"," Right?"
"3140540","3142560"," It's nice and steady to the downside."
"3142940","3146600"," Hopefully nice and steady to the upside once you make that turn. "
"3147620","3149120"," And how do you look for this?"
"3150600","3152020"," How do you confirm it?"
"3153680","3154840"," When does it happen?"
"3155160","3157420"," All that kind of stuff is important, right?"
"3158120","3163740"," The key point here that I'm trying to make to you though is it's usually multi-day, right?"
"3164680","3166560"," Oftentimes we're myopic in our look."
"3167340","3169140"," All right, we want that exact bar."
"3169460","3172400"," We want that exact, hey, we confirmed that we're going up. "
"3173040","3174100"," All that kind of stuff."
"3174380","3176000"," So let's look at SPX."
"3178160","3179280"," SPX price. "
"3179760","3182720"," We don't have we don't have currently price."
"3183720","3185380"," White in red doing."
"3185960","3190060"," We've got white price red on a five minute chart. "
"3190060","3194400"," So there's no confirmation that we're going up here is there on SPX."
"3195800","3202780"," What are you looking for to put that trade on for the holiday?"
"3203680","3206840"," I don't care if it's today, tomorrow, Wednesday, Friday."
"3206900","3207840"," I don't care when it is. "
"3209000","3210600"," But you are looking for something."
"3211720","3212640"," It's SPX, right?"
"3213300","3214600"," You're looking for red there."
"3215640","3217220"," You're looking for white above. "
"3217760","3222060"," And you're looking for price to have checked as a five minute chart."
"3222780","3229460"," Price to have checked and started to head higher so that you can take a multi-day trade, right?"
"3229900","3231960"," This hasn't happened yet, has it an SPX."
"3232660","3234480"," So SPX is telling you no. "
"3235500","3237740"," The trade is not yet, right?"
"3238620","3240200"," You see the failure right here."
"3241140","3245200"," This looks like the beginnings of that trend, right?"
"3245940","3247140"," But it's it failed, right?"
"3247660","3248240"," Boom, right down."
"3248860","3252520"," And what you want is confirmation higher, right?"
"3253380","3257500"," And stops underneath trailing stops as you go higher in price. "
"3258360","3260800"," So you haven't seen that yet in SPX."
"3261540","3263320"," Not looking like it's ready just yet."
"3263760","3265240"," I guess you could wing it and say, fuck it. "
"3265300","3267940"," I'm taking the trade and it's Monday."
"3267940","3269320"," I'm taking it and I'm going on vacation."
"3269860","3271780"," Some of you are like, I want to wait and see. "
"3272120","3272560"," I want proof."
"3273780","3274900"," I want validation."
"3275400","3277260"," SPX isn't showing you that right now. "
"3277920","3279680"," We can look at a 15 minute chart."
"3280340","3281580"," And that's the 15 minute chart."
"3282240","3284580"," This is an even higher time frame trend, right?"
"3284940","3286520"," Woohoo, we're going up for a long time. "
"3287200","3294180"," Price is still below the white line and the red line showing no signs of reversal here in a 15"
"3294180","3294480"," minute."
"3294480","3299060"," So that bull trade is still not on on a five minute in SPX."
"3299220","3303700"," Still not on on a 15 minute on SPX to get the hourly trend. "
"3305160","3307560"," What do we need to see for reversal here?"
"3308340","3315640"," For the confirmation for a multi day or multi week time frame, price is below the white line,"
"3315880","3315960"," right?"
"3316240","3319420"," So we have no bullish trade here to put on Dewey."
"3319420","3323880"," You would need to see price get above the hourly."
"3324600","3326640"," Confirm the hourly down here at that 435. "
"3326780","3330700"," I bet you that's the the HT right there, right?"
"3331080","3331720"," Get above there."
"3332120","3332840"," Start trending higher."
"3333020","3334520"," This could take into Wednesday, couldn't it?"
"3334900","3339980"," We can have a trend day today and still not have a trend for next week. "
"3341460","3345100"," So even if we trend higher today, there's no guarantee that we're going to continue higher."
"3345760","3348480"," For a month or a week or a month."
"3349140","3351520"," So there's none of that going on just yet on the hourly. "
"3352180","3354580"," On the daily, this is helpful."
"3355960","3358440"," Looking for a dip to buy down here, right?"
"3359260","3360440"," Looking for a dip to buy."
"3361020","3363360"," The six CMA and a daily chart still heading down. "
"3363800","3366680"," We're testing the six CMA right now."
"3366680","3368780"," As long as we trade underneath it, we're bearish."
"3369180","3370500"," So we're still underneath it. "
"3371240","3372560"," Where does Jim want to buy?"
"3372800","3374220"," Jim wants to buy down here, right?"
"3374420","3375300"," This is where I want to fucking buy."
"3375460","3377160"," I want to buy this shit down here all day long."
"3377500","3377560"," Bam. "
"3378260","3378680"," Right?"
"3379240","3381080"," Take that trade like it's nobody's business."
"3405460","3406740"," Bull cross right here."
"3406980","3407300"," Great. "
"3407640","3409320"," Get the full plane."
"3410040","3410500"," Bam."
"3410660","3410780"," Higher. "
"3411240","3411760"," Whoo hoo."
"3412320","3413280"," Come on back down."
"3413820","3416100"," Bull cluster on the hourly trigger. "
"3417760","3422800"," Just waiting for the 27 and the 129 to come up and confirm the move is higher."
"3423760","3427540"," Can't take the trade unless we go above it, right?"
"3428200","3430240"," So right there, you start to look for that confirmation."
"3431420","3434000"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, right?"
"3435840","3437740"," Just want to see it happen first. "
"3438680","3442160"," You want to get caught with your pads down in here, right?"
"3443020","3444380"," No pads down in here."
"3448950","3450910"," Let's look at it right here as a one minute chart."
"3462020","3466620"," Let's take a look at this on the triggers. "
"3468400","3470580"," The lawsuit looks good for an upside move."
"3473380","3475920"," We had that first closure above here."
"3476920","3483200"," Next target above 436.64. So what are we looking to happen here?"
"3483560","3485580"," What do we want to see before we take this trade?"
"3487080","3488680"," All you guys know out there?"
"3492100","3495480"," I need to give time for the five minutes catch back up. "
"3496880","3499580"," It's kind of starting to go vertical here."
"3499940","3501080"," It's not flattening out."
"3502100","3503600"," I want to see this come up here. "
"3506620","3512730"," I want to see this cross up."
"3513970","3515590"," I want to see price get above."
"3518490","3523390"," Let's see, like even if you see red bars in here, I want to see price get back above here"
"3523390","3524790"," and begin to head higher. "
"3525690","3528070"," So I don't have a trade right now, do I?"
"3529710","3532230"," I don't have a trade down here, do I for myself."
"3533290","3535190"," So there's no trade for me right now."
"3535390","3537550"," What do I not want to happen in cash market?"
"3538530","3540130"," What do I don't want to see?"
"3540950","3543330"," What is the seller looking for right now in cash market?"
"3543750","3545350"," They want to reverse this, right?"
"3546070","3552090"," You can see how on the hourly they sell it down, they sell it down, they sell it down, and"
"3552090","3554370"," they're looking to sell this down right now, right?"
"3554670","3556890"," So is there a trade for a bull here at this point?"
"3557250","3557430"," No. "
"3558310","3562390"," What you need to do is have confirmation above the one minute trigger."
"3563030","3565350"," If you're sell side, do you have a trade here right now?"
"3565490","3566330"," No, you don't."
"3568490","3575490"," What you need to see happen first is how we drowned a bull, right?"
"3575970","3577450"," Let's talk about drowning a bull. "
"3578270","3582590"," You want to watch the roll in the 129, you want to watch the roll here?"
"3583790","3586450"," You want to watch a buyer fail."
"3587390","3590550"," If the buyer fails, so you push them down, right?"
"3590690","3594950"," You'll see one, two, three, we'll turn red."
"3594950","3599630"," One, two, three, right?"
"3600050","3601130"," Maybe one more. "
"3602350","3608830"," You might give bulls like two chances here, two breaths, and then we'll roll it down on them."
"3609750","3613790"," So right in here, and then you get your downside move."
"3614350","3616990"," A couple targets to the downside for the bulls, right?"
"3618670","3623330"," And you get the reversal to the downside to that daily trigger. "
"3623330","3625670"," So let's take a look here on this one."
"3626370","3628270"," Seeing the roll right now, right?"
"3628570","3633450"," On the hourly trigger, you're looking for a failure, right?"
"3633530","3635750"," It's like you're drowning a bull here, you're drowning a buyer."
"3636490","3637810"," You let them come up for some breath. "
"3638730","3643610"," They fail, and we begin to target lower numbers, right?"
"3644230","3651050"," Price target down below 4.32, 55, and we got a gap down here."
"3653410","3655650"," S1, and this one down below."
"3656610","3659650"," Oh, this yellow line right here, we got this little one right there, too. "
"3660850","3665550"," We'll see if the sellers can sell this down and get us down to the daily trigger."
"3667610","3674370"," Rook through 4.33, 30, price target to the downside, 4.32, 55 for the bulls."
"3683050","3684150"," Change this here. "
"3689400","3690820"," Over the bears, I said bulls."
"3691660","3699300"," Now, where's price, right?"
"3699660","3703100"," We've got push up, looking for confirmation on daily trigger."
"3704000","3707360"," Sellers able to step right in on that daily trigger and sell, right?"
"3707600","3708600"," Like it's nobody's business. "
"3709660","3713200"," You're going to now have, you'll now see those green bars come up a little bit."
"3713420","3715900"," We'll try to give them a breath, let them up to breathe a little bit."
"3716460","3720260"," I think they're going to get out of this, and they're going to try to push it down one more"
"3720260","3720600"," time. "
"3720600","3722540"," I want you to see it as it happens, okay?"
"3722980","3724580"," You'll see that big push to the downside."
"3725580","3727120"," Bam, we'll hit this one right here."
"3740610","3743910"," Bull's trade is above, right where we are right here. "
"3743990","3749090"," You'd want to see price break above, confirm here, and then you can have a continuation of the"
"3749090","3749930"," upside for bulls."
"3750850","3753930"," Without that first happening, you have no trade as a buyer."
"3768780","3770980"," You guys want to take a trade with me this afternoon?"
"3771160","3772300"," You guys want to take a trade right now?"
"3790250","3792030"," I've got set up 432Ps. "
"3795620","3796680"," Let me just a second."

"4006550","4007810"," We'll see if I get a fill out of them or not. "
"4010570","4011670"," Oh, come on, dude."
"4011830","4014270"," Fill that shit."
"4015930","4016890"," Nope, no fill. "

"4085640","4086800"," Take the money."
"4087240","4089420"," We got a new low right here. "
"4090280","4093880"," Should be a pull up and maybe further down the side to close this gap to the downside."
"4094880","4101050"," Pulls, yes."
"4115620","4123460"," Do you play it as day?"
"4123460","4127460"," How do you play it"
"4132740","4142740"," as day?"

"4151880","4156779"," They will test this six CMA and try to take out four thirty one ninety nine."
"4157720","4161760"," If not, you'll see a retrace up to four thirty three fifty three. "
"4166590","4168890"," There's your free trade with Kevin Jim James."
"4173890","4179200"," Happy fucking Monday."
"4180180","4181540"," Three money Mondays. "

"4193740","4196960"," Take a look at a SPX really quick me a second here in the background."
"4201380","4204280"," Still trading forty three forty two thirty nine. "
"4204960","4210580"," Remember the collar is at forty three twenty another twenty points to go for that collar."
"4211560","4213700"," I thought it was right here in this orange line."
"4214500","4215700"," But it looks like maybe lower. "
"4217460","4218800"," There's forty three twenty."
"4221360","4223380"," Something I'm going to delete this right here."
"4223660","4226100"," What I'll do is I'll hand tell you where it is. "
"4227020","4228060"," I thought it was closer."
"4229320","4230600"," Forty three twenty."
"4234300","4235580"," Let's keep my eye on it. "
"4235660","4236460"," We're really close."
"4236860","4238040"," So forty three four."
"4239100","4240260"," Forty three two. "
"4240900","4241220"," Yeah."
"4241540","4244580"," So it should be like forty three two."
"4244680","4245840"," It should be like forty three hundred. "
"4245840","4247100"," It should be like right in here."
"4247620","4249160"," I think maybe this is right here."
"4249300","4251800"," This four three zero four three zero one five. "
"4251800","4254260"," Maybe that's the collar right down there."
"4260280","4261980"," Nice little pullback right here."
"4262920","4264360"," Testing the six CMA. "
"4264360","4265740"," It's now ten forty three."
"4266740","4269740"," We're going to go back here and test this four three three four two."
"4269820","4273260"," We'll see if we can get more downside coming up in just a moment. "
"4275040","4276620"," So just kick a peek right here."
"4276720","4279040"," Some of you are probably going to stay short up here and here."
"4279120","4280840"," I can understand why you stay short here. "
"4281380","4286000"," I'd like to see the pullback or the pullback but just a little pull higher and then bam to the"
"4286000","4286280"," downside."

"4301140","4303280"," Some four thirty two P's. "
"4305280","4310020"," We'll see what the what the reaction trade is up here at four thirty three forty."
"4311460","4314720"," HYG holding on to itself right now."
"4316400","4318140"," This is kind of eh. "
"4319240","4321820"," This could be a bottom, believe it or not."
"4321820","4323140"," This is like man right now."
"4323260","4323560"," It's okay. "
"4324320","4326500"," You might get a nice bounce trade here."
"4329340","4330960"," You get a nice bounce here."
"4331280","4335340"," Nice introduction like it like nice like tradable day possibly today. "
"4336580","4341500"," Remember on Friday we talked about placing your flies and condors."
"4342120","4343800"," We had a conversation."
"4344040","4345900"," Don't forget my conversation with you on Friday. "
"4345900","4347360"," Talked about condors and flies."
"4348100","4352540"," Talked about parking the bus this week."
"4353200","4356820"," So if you're on those condors and flies you might get your wish here. "
"4357760","4361320"," So theta gang probably messing around out there."
"4361360","4369460"," I'm looking at some other things here Dixie and Vicks and I'm looking at IWM and NASDAQ and HYG."
"4369860","4373900"," Could be be careful there with your extreme bearishness you might have. "
"4374960","4379420"," Just parking the bus for end of month JPM color."
"4381460","4383480"," Hopefully you took the profit down here."
"4385120","4386080"," You've got cash. "
"4390260","4391840"," Let's see what happens in here."
"4391960","4396840"," I'm thinking that there's either this is either a Bible bottom or we're going to bounce around bam"
"4396840","4398020"," bam bam."
"4398340","4400940"," Kind of stuff for a Monday. "
"4407440","4409040"," That damn is a good fucking day."
"4409200","4410160"," Happy fucking Monday."
"4411700","4413720"," I took a trade last night. "
"4414760","4415320"," Made good money."
"4415320","4417140"," My wife."
"4420500","4426960"," My wife last night. "
"4428440","4434400"," Did your wife ever do like the middle of the night thing where she's like we have to talk."
"4436060","4437400"," I'm like okay let's talk."
"4439520","4447920"," And she's like she wanted to talk about my kids are home schooled right now. "
"4448800","4450780"," They're in a private online school."
"4451140","4454180"," Now they were in this private online school before COVID."
"4454960","4457020"," So this was a school set up for this. "
"4457660","4464560"," We were already planning on taking a milk run around the world and so a lot of these kids do"
"4464560","4467900"," online homeschooling secular stuff."
"4469420","4473840"," And prior to that they were in private school."
"4475180","4478960"," They're talking about sending our kids back to school. "
"4482220","4487940"," And we have all kinds of there's all kinds of ramifications in this."
"4489140","4489520"," Cost."
"4490700","4492500"," How far away it is. "
"4493660","4495220"," Will they re-socialize."
"4496280","4497340"," These kids are socialized."
"4497560","4505340"," They play sports and they've got music and they go to school. "
"4505340","4508100"," They hike, bike, play sports, all that kind of stuff."
"4508300","4513740"," But their socialization in school and the cost of course associated with the school is through the"
"4513740","4514620"," fucking roof."
"4516200","4518360"," And now is the time for us to apply. "
"4520660","4522740"," We had that conversation last night."
"4524560","4527900"," And then the other question became do we just move?"
"4531960","4533280"," So it's like all these different."
"4533580","4536100"," And of course I don't want to move my kids right now. "
"4536680","4539440"," Kind of at what's weird when kids are young they're easier to move."
"4540720","4545200"," When they start to get older, they start to have like attachments."
"4546020","4546920"," I feel like that. "
"4548040","4552640"," Like they start to get attached when they become a little bit more self-aware of their"
"4552640","4553040"," surroundings."
"4553900","4555700"," Think back to when you're a kid in like your memories."
"4556260","4562100"," They start to really firm up around that like fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth grade, right?"
"4562480","4564340"," And you'll you never kind of lose those memories. "
"4564840","4571400"," Pre that you have memories of that stuff but there's no real like yeah this is easy for us to"
"4571400","4573580"," for my job to take me wherever I wanted to go."
"4575860","4578820"," But where they are right now on their age is kind of tough."
"4579100","4588180"," So talked about all that into last night and into the wee hours of the morning. "
"4594180","4595980"," And here's the funniest thing."
"4598900","4600240"," Some of you are going to like this."
"4601140","4602280"," Some of you are going to hate this. "
"4605460","4611180"," Some of the private schools that are available to our kids are to our students are religious"
"4611180","4617000"," schools and my kids are more secular than religious."
"4617260","4617960"," I was raised religious."
"4618720","4619920"," My wife was as well. "
"4620000","4621820"," I both went to private Catholic schools."
"4624400","4630800"," And there was some discussion entering into the conversation of potentially setting them both to"
"4630800","4634900"," Catholic school mostly because it was close to our home."
"4635440","4639000"," There's a Catholic high school and a Catholic grade school nearby. "
"4639800","4643080"," And it had more to do with pickups and drop-offs every day."
"4643720","4647760"," Like this is going to take an hour in the morning and an hour at night time."
"4649020","4651900"," Nice little break right here to the upside. "
"4652280","4653060"," Trade and hire."
"4654000","4655720"," Then where stops are right now."
"4655900","4657260"," So seller stops are right in. "
"4657360","4658720"," Well the seller stops are right here."
"4661700","4662660"," We're in this hourly trigger."
"4662980","4664080"," And you've got more stops. "
"4664340","4666800"," You've got the young Jim browser right here."
"4666960","4668060"," They're getting kind of torn up."
"4668920","4670180"," And you've got some stops. "
"4670440","4672500"," You'll have some people tell you that the stops are up here."
"4672500","4674060"," This is where the real sellers really are."
"4674360","4675800"," And it's been waiting up here. "
"4675880","4679000"," They've been doing this for like what a week now selling this hourly trigger."
"4679420","4683420"," And so they're going to attempt to rip this down one more time as we get up there."
"4688810","4693090"," So our conversation switched to like my youngest. "
"4693390","4695170"," I'm like I don't know if she's going to cope."
"4695770","4696650"," Go to a Catholic school."
"4697770","4705850"," It's kind of weird too because if my either of my children had a potential to like become a"
"4705850","4707530"," practicing Catholic it's probably her. "
"4708110","4713870"," And she's also the one that would probably have the most potential to rebel against that kind of a"
"4713870","4714750"," schooling structure."
"4715930","4719650"," I guess to some extent we probably still raise our kids."
"4720150","4722390"," I think I was raised very religious Catholics. "
"4722730","4723190"," So some of those."
"4725310","4729390"," Some of the history creeps into how you raise your children anyways."
"4729930","4730050"," Right. "
"4730390","4730910"," There's some of that."
"4733410","4737050"," Background is always there in the background with you as it is."
"4738950","4742910"," So we were discussing whether we should put them into that then to those schools. "
"4745010","4745990"," I just don't know."
"4746110","4747710"," I don't know if they'll do well or not."
"4747850","4753510"," When we went to my wife and I both went to private school and not everyone was a Catholic right"
"4753510","4754090"," in these schools. "
"4754770","4755150"," There were."
"4756510","4759690"," It had a percentage of kids that were not Catholic."
"4762090","4766110"," Trying to come back up here and see what happens on this hourly trigger right now. "
"4767010","4768710"," So if you can squeeze out these sellers."
"4775920","4776440"," Yeah."
"4776700","4777080"," Yes. "
"4777100","4777600"," Same to you too."
"4778020","4778860"," So I don't know what to do here."
"4779100","4781180"," Like we have another place called Cranbrook. "
"4781740","4785340"," So we talked about possibly putting me into school called Cranbrook, right?"
"4786380","4791040"," And they could have some social anxiety going there."
"4794040","4794860"," We don't."
"4795080","4796800"," We're not old money. "
"4797160","4798360"," Cranbrook is very old money."
"4798360","4798920"," Normally."
"4799160","4800820"," There's a lot of new money there too. "
"4801060","4804960"," But my kids don't come from an old money background."
"4806000","4808660"," And we were upper middle class when I grew up."
"4809040","4811540"," Where my father raised us as upper middle class. "
"4812300","4814960"," But he didn't come from upper middle class."
"4815240","4821380"," So whenever I was in those environments when I was a teenager or preteen specifically, teenagers"
"4821380","4821860"," got easier."
"4822660","4827760"," But as a preteen I really struggled in those environments with other kids. "
"4829760","4833760"," Not those environments but upper middle class coming into some kind of wealth."
"4833920","4835140"," We weren't wealthy in any way."
"4835140","4836420"," We weren't rich. "
"4837260","4838920"," But my father would do those things."
"4839300","4842200"," When I was young, when I was young, my dad would do stupid shit for me."
"4842340","4842740"," He'd be like. "
"4844040","4846980"," My buddy says his son goes here for the summer."
"4847140","4848080"," You should attend with him."
"4848580","4849480"," And don't worry. "
"4849500","4850100"," I'll put the bill."
"4850260","4850780"," I can do that."
"4851140","4854660"," And so I would go and I would I'd be like, this fucking sucks. "
"4855720","4857320"," I want to beat up all these rich kids."
"4859940","4861780"," Like these kids were filthy rich, right?"
"4861860","4863240"," And their parents would spoil them."
"4864120","4866360"," Like they would just get whatever the fuck they wanted, right?"
"4866540","4867000"," It didn't matter. "
"4867240","4868880"," And I'd do summer programs with these kids."
"4869100","4871920"," And I was like, I'm going to beat these kids up."
"4877220","4879680"," So I didn't like I didn't like that experience. "
"4879680","4881580"," So I think about my children in the same way."
"4881580","4887420"," I'm like, are they going to hate this and resent me for sending"
"4887420","4893540"," them all with a bunch of spoiled rich kids?"
"4902320","4902960"," Yeah."
"4904020","4909340"," I went to Mike, Mike, the schools that we went to were not nice. "
"4909340","4913260"," Like my my wife spoke fluent Japanese, right?"
"4914180","4917920"," She spoke fluent, wrote and spoke fluent Japanese."
"4919020","4920720"," She moved all over the world to her."
"4921000","4923140"," So her father was with the government. "
"4924200","4925500"," And so she lived."
"4925900","4927100"," Her sister was born in Japan."
"4929280","4932140"," They spent all their years their youth in Japan. "
"4932700","4934020"," And they didn't go to American school."
"4934160","4935180"," They went to Japanese schools."
"4935760","4944840"," So they come back to the United States and their parents put her in a French Catholic boarding"
"4944840","4945300"," school. "
"4945300","4949280"," And they were like, Oh, fuck no, we don't we don't do that here."
"4949540","4953700"," You need to learn Latin and French and Japanese."
"4954400","4955040"," What do you mean Japanese?"
"4956340","4962800"," So she had to like learn two new languages and then zero help to to maintain Japanese. "
"4964920","4965780"," Great schooling."
"4966240","4967240"," One of the best schools."
"4967480","4970320"," Matter of fact, I forget his name. "
"4970400","4973020"," Some very famous people have come out of the school."
"4973200","4974860"," She went to her school school system."
"4975540","4976820"," Very famous Americans. "
"4978220","4983680"," But you know, like they're great schools, but they're not fun or at least in my experience that in"
"4983680","4985440"," my experience, the Catholic school is never fun."
"4986820","4994440"," And as a matter of fact, when I got out of Catholic school, like the humanities, arts, sciences,"
"4994680","4995320"," that's kind of stuff."
"4995480","5001340"," I was really strong in, but anything that was current, I was lacking heavily. "
"5002400","5003780"," Anything current at that time."
"5005280","5006940"," Like computer science."
"5006940","5008000"," I mean, it didn't matter. "
"5008080","5012900"," Astronomy, anything that was like anything that was like outside of the realm of the four or five"
"5012900","5023500"," or six major subjects like theology, English, mathematics, science, like"
"5023500","5027520"," the bass stuff, language, music."
"5029120","5030640"," It was horrible."
"5031080","5032860"," I was like, we didn't do that at my school. "
"5036180","5037360"," It was like computer."
"5037540","5039360"," I mean, I got into computers, but not at my school."
"5039580","5043020"," My school was like, my school was like, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"5043040","5043720"," You don't need computers."
"5044180","5045540"," That will come later to you."
"5045920","5048100"," If you have this stuff, you can then do computers. "
"5049260","5050980"," According to Italy."
"5051240","5052960"," Oh, no, we're not getting a leg down here."
"5053220","5053920"," I don't think so. "
"5055400","5057060"," I don't see a leg here at all."
"5059340","5060940"," There's no leg right here right now."
"5061160","5062260"," I don't see a leg here. "
"5062260","5065180"," So just a heads up to you if you think that we're getting a leg right now."
"5065920","5066600"," Fuck no."
"5066780","5070740"," Maybe if you want to know what a leg down here looks like, I'll show it to you. "
"5071340","5072660"," I'll buy it if it happens."
"5073360","5075180"," You got the rejection right here, right?"
"5076260","5077820"," You got the pull up here."
"5078460","5079540"," What are you looking for here?"
"5079800","5083500"," One more down and then another rejection and you'll take the trade right there. "
"5084440","5085980"," We'll start getting right down here."
"5088120","5088520"," 1057."
"5089400","5092020"," But here's the thing that we're not seeing, right?"
"5092840","5093280"," 1057. "
"5094160","5096340"," What do the bears need in the next three minutes?"
"5096420","5096980"," Anybody know?"
"5097900","5098800"," Somebody let me know."
"5099480","5100000"," In the chat."
"5100320","5101860"," What does a bear need right now?"
"5102580","5103400"," Does anybody know?"
"5103560","5105740"," You actually hear water flame futures?"
"5106340","5106780"," Forextender. "
"5106880","5109100"," So the seller's like, hey, we're going to roll here."
"5109220","5110500"," I'm like, yeah, I don't know, man."
"5111400","5112680"," What do we need right here?"
"5113160","5114300"," Somebody in the chat, let me know. "
"5115080","5115740"," It's 1057."
"5118480","5120980"," Sellers need a new low, right?"
"5120980","5121480"," Right here."
"5122100","5122740"," They need a new low. "
"5126260","5127780"," They need a new low."
"5128960","5130960"," Let's look at what the price was at 1045."
"5131560","5132720"," So we'll take a look at that right now. "
"5132900","5134200"," 1045 right there."
"5136720","5139740"," So we'll draw a little line right there and see if they can get it."
"5139980","5141440"," 1045 right there. "
"5144460","5144900"," 1045."
"5145740","5147720"," So see this little line that I have right here?"
"5149460","5150460"," See that little line?"
"5152280","5153500"," Make it a different color."
"5156100","5157540"," Make it deep dark red. "
"5158120","5159100"," You can't see that shit."
"5160160","5161520"," Make it purple, maybe purple."
"5163160","5164080"," Purple right there. "
"5165120","5166500"," So see that purple line right there?"
"5166600","5175640"," I'm going to delete this here in just a minute, but sellers need that right there by 10 or 11"
"5175640","5176780"," a.m. They don't get it."
"5177960","5180500"," They're going to hand it over to the bulls up here in just a minute."
"5184980","5186340"," They only got a couple minutes left. "
"5186460","5187100"," They got two minutes left."
"5187220","5187660"," They got a new low."
"5188100","5194100"," We'll delete this purple at 4.3286 if they can't get it in the next couple minutes. "
"5198290","5200050"," I think I'm going to take a fucking call here."
"5205940","5208480"," 4.35 C's are 17 cents."
"5209460","5211000"," There's a shit ton of calls here. "
"5211120","5216660"," There's like, there's 196,435 C's."
"5217740","5218740"," They're at 17 cents."
"5219520","5224340"," I'd really like them to be like fucking 10 cents or 7 cents or something like that. "
"5225000","5227580"," So you might get an intraday trade to the upside here."
"5228320","5234060"," I doubt that these close in the money or they're going to remove them at some point off the market."
"5234540","5235980"," I'm setting up the trade right now. "
"5236120","5236680"," I haven't got to get."
"5237340","5239760"," Now they're 18 cents, 19 cents."
"5239760","5241580"," If I can get it on the street. "
"5243440","5244180"," Too many."
"5247940","5249780"," 18, 19 cents right now."
"5253220","5255480"," 11 a.m. Bear is unable to get it. "
"5256820","5257700"," I'm in for 20."
"5258240","5259460"," 4.35 C."
"5260640","5263200"," I'll put some stops down below in case I get reversed here."
"5264580","5267140"," HYG looking strong right now. "
"5268880","5270060"," VIX breaking blow."
"5270240","5272120"," It's 27 EMA in a five minute chart."
"5272280","5272720"," One minute chart. "
"5272860","5273280"," Excuse me."
"5275720","5276900"," I don't have five in here."
"5277200","5280040"," It's a little bit of a gap to close down below on the VIX. "
"5281040","5283680"," VIX left the gap down below at 1345."
"5285740","5288060"," Tesla trying to hold its fucking pants up."
"5288320","5289760"," IWM strong right now. "
"5291020","5293080"," See the bus parking that's going on right now."
"5293120","5293860"," Do you guys see that?"
"5294440","5296700"," Like do you see it on NASDAQ at least?"
"5303780","5306500"," We've got the pin at 4320."
"5307280","5309160"," We've got this range bound trade. "
"5309500","5310880"," We're talking about the Friday close."
"5311560","5312920"," Theta gang is going to win again."
"5313040","5314780"," They're going to end up selling a bunch of this shit to us. "
"5315380","5316520"," Everything to sell us options."
"5317980","5321040"," They're going to trade the range for the rest of the week."
"5321840","5329720"," Sellers want to get down below and nail that bottom number at some points and find out if they can. "
"5330020","5332180"," I don't think they're going to sell like a major sell."
"5333480","5339240"," Maybe we break through the daily trigger for a moment or two, but like market crash, that kind of"
"5339240","5340840"," stuff is off the table right now."
"5341860","5346980"," We get end of month flows that we have to wait for and the JPM caller that we're waiting for. "
"5347800","5350240"," So we're going to delete this purple line right there."
"5351220","5354480"," Waiting for end of month flows we're waiting for JPM caller."
"5355040","5360440"," And we've also talked, we started this other part of our conversation about three weeks to go into"
"5360440","5368720"," OPEX and that was that was that is a long-term trainer like I'm going to put a spread on"
"5368720","5373380"," or something or I'm going to figure out what the market direction is for the next three months. "
"5373380","5378600"," Really doesn't come out until Friday or even possibly next week."
"5379900","5382560"," So we wait for the JPM caller to come out."
"5383040","5386000"," You let a breather come into the market. "
"5386500","5389340"," Scott on ball whiz said yesterday on Fintua."
"5389440","5396680"," I think I saw him post something about an unclenching ability to unclench after July 5th, right?"
"5396820","5397780"," You'd have the quarter end."
"5398580","5402620"," You'd have end of month flows get out there and then you'd have the ability to unclench the market. "
"5403020","5406220"," Let the VIX unclench into the beginning of July."
"5407600","5413800"," I think he said after the 5th and he actually posted some strikes where there was some interest"
"5413800","5415940"," into July for that stuff to happen."
"5422140","5423740"," Dixie get another chance here. "
"5424080","5425220"," We'll move the liquidation break."
"5425340","5426680"," I'm still long calls right now."
"5427440","5429000"," I'm watching HYG here. "
"5430620","5431440"," I am long."
"5431600","5433840"," I'm trying to see if I can get a gap closed on the VIX."
"5434520","5438020"," If we do get a reversal to the downside here, we'll put some stops on. "
"5439100","5441400"," See if they roll it on me and I'll jump on the put side."
"5443020","5446360"," Pay an attention to VIX or HYG in the background for that move higher."
"5511000","5512040"," Come on VIX. "
"5515080","5516460"," Come on HYG."
"5522660","5523860"," Just sitting here waiting."
"5529480","5531120"," Got a couple more ticks to go down. "
"5531260","5531740"," I'm looking for 7421."
"5532660","5533780"," One more penny on HYG."
"5569700","5572520"," Now HYG testing 7421. "
"5577030","5578030"," See if that holds."
"5578250","5583670"," If we go to the upside, if we begin to break at any point 7420, I'll switch to the put"
"5583670","5585370"," side and take a downside trade."
"5611900","5613480"," Probing the downside right now. "
"5615280","5617400"," Sweating bullets watching HYG here in the background."
"5635150","5645090"," There is a large gap to the downside in HYG between 7415 and 7390."
"5655750","5661130"," If I have to jump on the other side of this trade, I'm going to be looking at 432s. "
"5661130","5664170"," They're at 40 cents right now, but I'm not going to buy them at the moment."
"5666170","5690380"," They're at"
"5690380","5691320"," 38 right now."
"5692480","5693300"," At 40. "
"5694260","5695020"," I'm still not on."
"5695080","5696120"," I'm still on call side here."
"5701600","5707840"," The next target for bears, I think they're rolling over here, is 43110 in node 9."
"5709000","5710580"," There's your S1 right there. "
"5713640","5715260"," There's your S2 right there."
"5719630","5721990"," No, they want this so fucking bad, man."
"5722090","5723910"," These sellers want it so bad. "
"5751930","5762260"," They're trying"
"5762260","5763660"," to sell HYG right now."
"5763800","5766240"," I'm going to have to jump on this trade on 432 here in just a minute."
"5808680","5809820"," Come on, baby. "
"5810260","5872230"," Yeah, it's"
"5872230","5873710"," so fucking bad right now."
"5921470","5925730"," So I'm going through my mind right now, as I want to take the other side of this trade, and"
"5925730","5927330"," I don't want to get fucking trapped in here."
"5928370","5933770"," I'm still sitting on 435 C's right now, and I'm like, oh, I want to take these fucking puts and"
"5933770","5934870"," just be on both sides. "
"5935670","5937850"," But then I'm like, I already know how this fucking goes."
"5938070","5939370"," I'm going to grab these, they're like 39."
"5939750","5943310"," 40 cents, and those fucking puts are going to go to like 12 cents. "
"5943310","5945530"," I'm going to get stuck back holding."
"5952230","5953750"," And they're pressing right now."
"5953850","5955570"," They just jumped on the other side of the trade. "
"5955810","5959910"," There's now 212,000 puts at 433 P."
"5960450","5961830"," They went from calls to puts."
"5974270","5975830"," Come on, HYG."
"5981900","5983860"," Fucking ripped their faces off. "
"6044960","6046140"," My teeth are floating."
"6129380","6130700"," Come on, HYG."
"6131100","6132120"," Fucking pound it. "
"6133580","6163660"," Oh, fed bids"
"6163660","6168660"," for six month bills, total four spots, six billion dollars, and fed bids for three month bills,"
"6169020","6171180"," total five spot, two billion dollars."
"6203510","6208190"," I'm like, my mind, I'm like, can I go potty for like five minutes, and hopefully we'll be like"
"6208190","6208970"," right around here."
"6210290","6211690"," I'm going to go potty. "
"6222420","6224160"," I got the first tag here."
"6224240","6225760"," We got the R1 tag here."
"6226900","6228900"," So there's the R1 tag right there. "
"6229020","6230440"," Never hit S2 down below."
"6266630","6268390"," NASDAQ week right now in the background."
"6269270","6270670"," HYG looks good right now. "
"6270790","6272050"," NASDAQ's selling right now."
"6272310","6275750"," Don't have any idea why."
"6275750","6277310"," He's rolling over right now, too. "
"6282520","6284000"," Tesla's rolling over right now."
"6286040","6287600"," NWM's holding its own just fine."
"6290300","6291660"," Take around the market real quick. "
"6301120","6302380"," Wrong fucking chart."
"6310540","6312320"," Rotation out of big tech, maybe."
"6314380","6317880"," I was looking around, I was looking at Tesla, and then I just looked at Apple. "
"6320420","6322480"," Nope, wrong one."
"6344690","6345670"," Something else here."
"6346010","6347030"," Probably have to sell this. "
"6349710","6351330"," Trying to squeeze me out right now."
"6392050","6401800"," We're so fucking close, I'm like, I'm looking"
"6401800","6407620"," at NVDA right now, and I'm like, I'm looking at NVDA right now, and I'm like, man, the daily is"
"6407620","6410600"," at $3,5.67. I got another $7."
"6416100","6419680"," I'm going to close this. "
"6420160","6420820"," I have some calls."
"6421020","6422540"," I've got the $4.35 C's right here."
"6423240","6424080"," I'm going to sell them. "
"6424660","6427360"," And I'm going to look at the put side one more time."
"6429420","6431760"," Dude, HYG looks fucking good, man."
"6432840","6434160"," Like, HYG looks banging. "
"6436920","6440180"," And NVDA is ready for a buy, like almost there."
"6440820","6445360"," Like, $3,5.67. Another $7, and it'll be fucking banging."
"6449220","6450600"," I'm flat right now. "
"6460280","6463120"," Now is that going back down a test that's previous low?"
"6463900","6464520"," Fuck that, dude."
"6464620","6466940"," I want to buy this shit so bad right now."
"6469020","6471480"," That's 11.30 a.m. Eastern time. "
"6471660","6474860"," The US sells $65 billion of three month bills."
"6475380","6480300"," Private cover of 2 to 58 and a prior high yield of 5 spot 1 3%."
"6480300","6484180"," And the US sells $58 billion of six month bills. "
"6484660","6489860"," Private cover of 2 to 65 and a prior high yield of 5 spot 1 7%."
"6495270","6500730"," 4.31s. Let's see something here."
"6502170","6508710"," Like, Apple's right on. "
"6508810","6510410"," It's a fucking hourly trigger right now."
"6510830","6511810"," It's like wants to go."
"6527500","6529940"," Back in 4.35 C one more time. "
"6530080","6530700"," I might burn these."
"6530940","6532380"," Be careful of taking this trade with me."
"6533820","6536500"," I'm back on 4.35 C again right now. "
"6536500","6539920"," There's like this like capitulation move here of some kind."
"6541880","6545580"," Like we could still continue down lower, but I'm trying to get this trade right here."
"6545720","6548460"," So either here, here to the upside. "
"6551720","6552980"," I just entered long again."
"6554060","6556560"," I don't want the I don't want this last fuck."
"6556720","6557880"," I don't want this for the put. "
"6559340","6561900"," It's not a ton of fucking room for it to go down."
"6562560","6563760"," I don't get caught in the trade."
"6578660","6580980"," I'm going to end up adding to this position in just a moment. "
"6589200","6590660"," I'm not going to add to this position."
"6590760","6591580"," I've got a position now."
"6591700","6592700"," 4.35, right?"
"6592940","6593660"," I'm going to add. "
"6595880","6596360"," 22."
"6597120","6598120"," Don't go on there."
"6600800","6603760"," I've got more calls on 4.35 C right now. "
"6604120","6607220"," So I've got 4.35 4.34 just now."
"6607880","6610080"," So I'm along 4.35 4.34 C."
"6621360","6622660"," I'm going to take a quick piss."
"6623540","6624300"," So here's my thing. "
"6624540","6628580"," So in the background here, like NVDA looks like it's going to go to the depths of hell, but then"
"6628580","6630980"," like Apple's sitting right on its trend."
"6631820","6634300"," Like right on its hourly fucking trigger right now."
"6634920","6638080"," And I'm at this place. "
"6638360","6640240"," So I'm at this place right now looking at Apple."
"6640980","6642080"," I'm just not buying it."
"6642800","6647980"," So my thought here is my thought is this. "
"6662020","6667460"," As long as this doesn't break down here, going back to the beginning, we're going fucking moon"
"6667460","6667780"," time."
"6668440","6671320"," So NVDA looks like dog shit."
"6672220","6674160"," HYG is saying that the way is up. "
"6676420","6678060"," IWM says the way is up."
"6678240","6680160"," There's a bloodbath in NASDAQ right now."
"6680800","6685580"," I'm watching NVDA looks like absolute fucking dog shit on the chart. "
"6685580","6689760"," But Apple is like telling me, fuck you know, we're going to continue higher and bounce here."
"6690400","6695520"," So if we do begin to break down here and have like that big capitulation move."
"6699220","6700480"," So let's see it right here. "
"6700520","6701460"," It's looking a five minute chart."
"6704820","6707040"," So like we're so close down here."
"6707740","6709240"," This is the daily trigger right here. "
"6710800","6712980"," This is my price target down here at 430."
"6714960","6719100"," But you need to like get underneath it to attack this."
"6719420","6724120"," And this right here is Apple's hourly trigger. "
"6724360","6725500"," I'll show it to you right now."
"6726740","6729080"," It's like that last bloodbath down there."
"6729360","6731120"," Like we got the first bounce down here. "
"6731200","6732860"," It bought that losing money."
"6733460","6736540"," Accident re-entered again for a move higher."
"6737140","6739860"," Now I'm going to have to get pretty fucking bearish in here. "
"6739860","6741740"," If we get underneath this."
"6741880","6743140"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"6743760","6745300"," Now what I'm talking about here. "
"6746980","6749480"," So like this shit gets bought like on the regular."
"6749740","6751020"," Like this is Apple right here."
"6751960","6753900"," And the daily is coming up on it. "
"6758700","6761020"," So I mean if Apple sells right here."
"6761440","6762540"," Show it to you."
"6762540","6764740"," At 11.30 a.m. Eastern time. "
"6764900","6768580"," The US sells 65 billion dollars in three month bills private."
"6768580","6770400"," It's 11.25 euro close."
"6770860","6773760"," Maybe the euros start to buy here or they sell. "
"6774500","6777840"," But it's like a pretty fucking good printer right here man."
"6778200","6779900"," On that hourly bam bam bam."
"6780200","6782120"," Five foot one seven percent. "
"6782360","6785720"," I do have some fear in here looking at this hourly going down."
"6785940","6787420"," We're losing the hourly right now."
"6788320","6789600"," On Apple. "
"6790060","6794920"," So I guess I guess my positive here is if Apple breaks below."
"6795820","6798840"," There's a larger trade to the downside on it."
"6799020","6808880"," From 186.72 to 180.50. My one hesitation here is NVDA is telling you look out to the"
"6808880","6809800"," downside right. "
"6812160","6815060"," Although it doesn't have as much market cap as Apple."
"6815980","6819620"," As NVDA is looking pretty fucking bearish here."
"6820400","6827940"," To this 385.99. We're looking for a target of 390 on Friday for NVDA to get down here. "
"6828780","6830040"," To bloodbath this down."
"6830760","6832980"," Now if NVDA begins to roll down."
"6833620","6835320"," Apple should roll with it. "
"6838760","6841000"," So I've got two stacks of calls here."
"6841740","6843360"," I'm not buying this cell."
"6844220","6846000"," On Monday I'm not buying this cell. "
"6846180","6847580"," So I'm still long calls here."
"6847580","6849540"," I've got two sets right now."
"6849540","6854820"," I've got four thirty fours and four thirty fives. "
"6855520","6859960"," If we begin to break down below this bottom here."
"6861200","6863900"," Any of this nonsense and start doing this stuff."
"6864460","6866820"," I'll join the bears but I'm not believing this at all. "
"6868260","6869620"," I'm watching NVDA."
"6869620","6870560"," I'm watching HYG."
"6870740","6871820"," It's telling you we're going up. "
"6873160","6876360"," I'm watching Vix is saying a different story."
"6877340","6880260"," And in NASDAQ's trading a range right now."
"6880560","6882280"," So this is the bottom of the range. "
"6883260","6885140"," I realize they're trying to sell this."
"6885300","6886460"," Let me show it to you in another chart here."
"6887420","6888880"," So I am long calls right here. "
"6891440","6895560"," Like on this one minute chart and five minute chart I know it can seem like blood."
"6897520","6898660"," Let's look at it here."
"6901820","6905200"," So this is NASDAQ right here and this is what we're talking about here. "
"6909770","6915810"," The true range down here at what's going on."
"6926480","6928380"," So here's NASDAQ right here."
"6930680","6933980"," I've got true range down at fourteen seven ninety two. "
"6935580","6938440"," And this is kind of like the apple line right."
"6940120","6941820"," Apple's sitting on its hourly trigger."
"6942420","6952280"," I mean bears want nothing more than this right. "
"6955380","6956440"," Is that it right there?"
"6961290","6963350"," Like bears want to get underneath this."
"6963990","6965910"," Where the fuck were down here like this?"
"6967930","6969850"," I don't want to be buying puts."
"6970290","6972010"," Not unless we get underneath this shit. "
"6972190","6973770"," So I'm logging the market right now."
"6976570","6980290"," Get a nice like nice fucking bull flag right there."
"6980370","6982290"," Nice sideways move right there. "
"6982550","6986930"," Sure bears are saying that's the move down but I'm looking at the move higher here."
"6987330","6988690"," Pulls all this bullshit out."
"6991150","6993210"," I'm going to go potty really quick. "
"6994190","6998730"," If we break below this true range down here for to keep that in mind."
"6998730","7003770"," Fourteen seven ninety two fourteen nine seventy two somewhere in here."
"7003910","7006790"," I'll get I'll get bears for the next leg down on apple. "
"7007570","7008850"," Something like that."
"7009230","7010170"," Then we start heading lower."
"7011030","7011790"," Otherwise I'm long. "
"7013030","7014390"," I'll come back and check in a few minutes."
"7015210","7017410"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"7017930","7018950"," Get free daily points. "
"7019550","7023290"," Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at today."
"7023490","7025270"," My brain is getting scared here and."
"7028270","7030790"," When you just look at apple that looks so bearish doesn't it. "
"7033370","7036610"," Like this up just off the top it looks extremely bearish."
"7038990","7041570"," Like just looking at that looks extremely bearish."
"7045220","7051460"," Like right here like a got bought it got bought and so just got bought right there. "
"7051680","7053280"," So this is the same chart this is apple."
"7055460","7059680"," I have a fucking bloodbath man if we roll this under here we're going to get a bloodbath."
"7061560","7067630"," I'm going to take some cheap puts on that just in case. "
"7067830","7069090"," I'm going to do a strangle here."
"7074150","7076610"," Four thirty or four four twenty nine peas."
"7077310","7080110"," I'm going to go really cheap four twenty nine peas as a hedge. "
"7080830","7081730"," It's my long position."
"7082430","7083450"," There are four cents."
"7083570","7084490"," I'm going to do a hundred of these. "
"7087470","7089650"," If I can clack out a hundred of them hold on."
"7092550","7094670"," Because really getting a fucking bloodbath like."
"7105350","7108610"," We either get into bloodbath here or this is a dip by. "
"7112760","7113740"," Maybe I'll go cheaper."
"7115280","7146840"," I don't"
"7146840","7148180"," want to buy them for two pennies."
"7148700","7149540"," I don't want to buy them for. "
"7149800","7152140"," I was going to buy like a hundred bucks worth of crash puts."
"7152700","7154620"," Four twenty eight peas for penny."
"7161470","7163650"," So they want me to pay two hundred bucks for him. "
"7163650","7165210"," I just put an offer in for a hundred bucks."
"7165490","7166230"," So if they fill him."
"7167490","7168390"," I'll take them. "
"7171350","7174550"," I yield five spot one eight percent five spot one eight percent."
"7174710","7176350"," The U.S. so so no fill right now."

"7179270","7181490"," I've got an order in for four twenty eight peas."
"7182430","7184770"," I'm going to assume here that if we don't go up."
"7185490","7187530"," We're going to get a fucking bloodbath so. "
"7189030","7190590"," High rate five spot two."
"7190670","7192890"," I'm going to leave this up here for that daily trigger."
"7194930","7197710"," Four twenty eight pea have got an order and they haven't filled yet. "
"7197770","7198970"," But if I get a fill on them."
"7199690","7201170"," If there's one penny."
"7202090","7204450"," And I believe if we break this down here. "
"7205210","7208490"," That we're going to go to the depths of hell like bam bam bam bam bam."
"7208890","7210370"," And hit that daily trigger down there."
"7212470","7214110"," Still long calls right now. "
"7215010","7217050"," And I'll be back with you in five minutes to go potty."

"8434570","8436190"," I'm like on a Monday fucking afternoon. "
"8436190","8439330"," I'm like you're going to break below this and start selling this right now."
"8440410","8443890"," Like we're having a bloodbath on a fucking Monday really Monday."
"8444990","8447530"," And then I'm looking to see what that bloodbath would be. "
"8448370","8451170"," On apple and I'm like okay so we're going where."
"8451570","8454950"," If we break under here you tell me we're going down to fucking 180."
"8455710","8458630"," On apple like six seven dollars on a Monday afternoon. "
"8459290","8460490"," Who the fuck selling that."
"8461170","8462150"," In cash market."
"8463210","8466350"," Like who the fuck is selling that in cash market on a Monday. "
"8466350","8469250"," Like they did this in the overnight I'd be like yeah I get that."
"8470130","8471870"," After hours I'd be like yeah I get that."
"8473150","8474910"," And then I want to show you something else that's cool. "
"8475550","8476470"," So this is apple right."
"8477210","8479390"," We had an apple and I'm like man I'm like."
"8479630","8481430"," And I get an ordering right now for crash puts. "
"8482350","8483310"," It hasn't filled."
"8484110","8484990"," It's like 428."
"8485630","8488590"," They're like two pennies but I want to pay a penny for them. "
"8489650","8491190"," Because I don't fucking believe them."
"8491190","8493170"," The dealers are saying we ain't going down there either."
"8493170","8495390"," Because that's what would happen right we'd break below. "
"8498070","8501730"," You'd break below and then you'd start fucking just dark ramp selling."
"8502250","8503330"," This is what the sellers want right."
"8503630","8505710"," Bears wanted to sell this in cash market right. "
"8506230","8508710"," The reason why I'm bringing this up right now in apple is because."
"8512910","8516270"," NVDA looks on the surface extremely bearish."
"8516450","8518210"," So like just looking at NVDA. "
"8521650","8523930"," Dude I had some crazy fucking dreams last night."
"8523990","8525590"," What I was going to do in stream today was hilarious."
"8526350","8527790"," It's like NVDA is down. "
"8529010","8530350"," How much today right."
"8530530","8532690"," It's down nine dollars nine nine cents ten bucks."
"8532970","8534270"," This looks extremely bearish. "
"8534870","8536790"," Like on the surface this doesn't look good."
"8536910","8537830"," This looks like really unhealthy."
"8538750","8540170"," It looks fucking terrible. "
"8540910","8542410"," Looks like a fucking dumpster fire."
"8543590","8544610"," That's what it looks like right."
"8544910","8547870"," Just just like just staring at this chart with like nothing. "
"8548770","8550170"," That's extremely bearish."
"8551250","8554270"," But then I'm looking at I put it on an hourly."
"8557050","8560370"," And that looks that looks like dog shit right looks like dog shit. "
"8560950","8563690"," So just like a traditional shit like it looks like crap."
"8565510","8566970"," But then I'm like yeah."
"8567990","8569710"," I'm like did I remember back on. "
"8572830","8575210"," I remember back when that looked like dog shit too."
"8575670","8577590"," Like I remember when it was selling back here."
"8578870","8580770"," And it was down here and. "
"8582690","8583730"," If you recall."
"8585990","8588230"," NVDA is a high beta stock right."
"8591830","8594310"," NVDA right in here had the white line. "
"8596990","8600410"," Like coming over the white line was crossing down below."
"8601810","8602910"," You see right there."
"8603710","8605570"," It just looked like dog shit like blood. "
"8606030","8606950"," You see it right there."
"8609740","8611880"," I'm going to assume that there was a seller out there."
"8612020","8613060"," And they were like this is it. "
"8613180","8617440"," This is the crash and Nvidia is going to go to the fucking depths of hell."
"8618160","8620500"," It's going to be raining fucking hell down here."
"8620500","8622800"," We're going to get pulled a whole entire thing back. "
"8623320","8625440"," I'm going to erase this entire move."
"8626640","8626780"," Right."
"8627640","8630640"," And there was I guarantee it because I would have wanted that trade too. "
"8630740","8632840"," Like you see that the white crosses right there."
"8633440","8634940"," So you would have expected this."
"8636700","8638660"," And you would have expected this right here. "
"8640080","8642140"," And then something else said no right."
"8642940","8647500"," And this is what they were looking for like fucking one huge down day in the market."
"8647720","8648480"," Baby two or three. "
"8648900","8651140"," And erase this entire move down here."
"8651480","8654520"," So just right just without like put your hand over your eye or something."
"8655060","8658060"," Cover up the future here and just look at this one here. "
"8658300","8659960"," So that kind of looks like really bad right."
"8661320","8663160"," So let's look at it again right now."
"8663160","8666380"," And what do we have the same kind of a thing set up setting up. "
"8666420","8666780"," See it."
"8668900","8670180"," So just right here."
"8670860","8672040"," Same setup right. "
"8673700","8674620"," See right there."
"8676100","8677200"," Same exact setup."
"8680200","8682260"," So I'm assuming if you're a seller. "
"8683020","8685500"," You want to see that break right you want to see that break."
"8687040","8690060"," I'm going to see the underneath and start selling the fuck out of it."
"8690060","8693080"," Maybe that happens into this close and we get it tomorrow. "
"8694180","8698600"," I like I like Tuesdays as a bloodbath day like you bloodbath this in here."
"8699080","8700380"," On a Tuesday not a Monday."
"8700540","8701080"," I don't like it on a Monday. "
"8701780","8703060"," Some Mondays I like to sell."
"8703900","8705280"," Then you have a turnaround Tuesday to the upside."
"8705660","8707000"," I guess maybe end of the day sell here. "
"8707880","8709520"," But these sellers this is where they got caught."
"8709860","8710660"," Like you can see it right."
"8712060","8713000"," See it right there. "
"8713400","8714480"," And you can see it right here."
"8715380","8718000"," And so then I looked at Apple."
"8718900","8721720"," And I'm like okay what the fuck is Apple doing. "
"8723120","8726080"," Because then I'm like looking at Apple and I'm like well."
"8727940","8730000"," What does Apple need to do."
"8732460","8734720"," For that bloodbath that take place. "
"8736100","8739080"," And it needed to break under here."
"8739700","8741040"," And it didn't did it."
"8742040","8742720"," So. "
"8745380","8748820"," And then how do you do that in cash market."
"8748820","8749900"," Maybe I'll."
"8753000","8757900"," I'm hanging out with me. "
"8760160","8762160"," How about this I'll posit this."
"8762900","8763300"," So."
"8765320","8765920"," I don't know. "
"8766340","8766780"," Maybe."
"8768260","8769920"," If you're sell side."
"8770200","8770660"," Maybe. "
"8772040","8774800"," It's been like a big problem for sellers right."
"8777860","8781840"," Is like the big moves are coming in in after hours."
"8785230","8785750"," Maybe. "
"8788090","8789970"," If you can keep it down."
"8790850","8793610"," You can get it down in the overnight tonight or something."
"8793610","8794550"," Am I making money now. "
"8795190","8796650"," Oh I'm making a lot of money right now."
"8798170","8798690"," Okay."
"8799690","8803150"," I have a four thirty fours that I got for seventeen cents. "
"8804370","8805890"," They're trading twenty seven."
"8806150","8809930"," I have four thirty fives that I sold for a loss."
"8810930","8813550"," At nine cents and we bought at eight cents. "
"8813850","8815810"," So I'm only out of penny right now in those."
"8820240","8822680"," We are reversing right now to the upside."
"8824220","8826800"," I guess I guess the thought here would be. "
"8829570","8831590"," If a seller could park it."
"8834640","8836800"," With the early trigger down here."
"8836800","8841220"," And then maybe try to attack it down. "
"8841340","8842480"," Maybe try to attack this."
"8843480","8844500"," Where's the marriage."
"8845960","8847920"," Manageo line down here. "
"8850540","8856600"," Like you need the early to come down and get the manageo line over here for the close maybe."
"8858240","8862040"," And then you can actually get the sell side that you're looking for."
"8862600","8865640"," The staircase down and after hours for tomorrow. "
"8870240","8874180"," Keep me keep me abreast as remind me in the chat."
"8876620","8878020"," Remind me in the chat."
"8878980","8880660"," As we close the day. "
"8881660","8884340"," To look at ES hourly trigger."
"8888100","8890400"," Four thirty three sixty eight."
"8891280","8892600"," The HT has come down. "
"8894220","8895340"," Right here."
"8896800","8909370"," I guess"
"8909370","8912070"," that's the only thing I can think of here for a seller."
"8913690","8915110"," So this is your line right here. "
"8915130","8916890"," I want you to know that this is the apple line."
"8917950","8919250"," This is like the."
"8920090","8922130"," If you're trying to crash and VDA. "
"8922550","8923890"," If you're trying to crash."
"8924930","8925490"," Apple."
"8927210","8930870"," Like like like the actual significant downside move. "
"8931410","8935110"," By the way we've got a bull cross forming right here."
"8935450","8936070"," Right now."
"8936690","8938190"," A bull plane forming. "
"8938650","8939530"," To the upside."
"8941710","8945750"," Just let me know if what your thoughts are in here because I don't see it man I see what"
"8945750","8946230"," you're thinking."
"8946950","8948110"," But I ain't seen it. "
"8948350","8950190"," So here's the bull."
"8950370","8952110"," Here's the bull cross right here."
"8954760","8955440"," Right there. "
"8955520","8958980"," Try to attack that early trigger once again retest that high."
"8960120","8961800"," We'll snap a line up there."
"8965860","8967040"," There's the previous high. "
"8967040","8973340"," And the next one to attack is."
"8975680","8976640"," Right here."
"8977180","8978980"," Four thirty four thirty seven. "
"8980820","8984540"," I think the only thing I think of here for sellers is."
"8985180","8991160"," There's so much demand in cash market that for you to actually like the demand is just immense"
"8991160","8991720"," right."
"8992960","8997020"," The only chance for you to get that role is ping pong ping pong. "
"8997040","8998560"," And then roll it into the close."
"9000120","9001720"," That's what you did last week right."
"9003100","9005540"," Like ping pong ping pong and then boom. "
"9006080","9007360"," After hours over there."
"9009180","9011120"," I'm fascinated by some looking at."
"9012140","9015520"," Look at an apple and apple's like go fuck yourself we ain't selling shit. "
"9015840","9019080"," And apple's got way larger market cap than VDA so."
"9019780","9025260"," You need them to participate to get in VDA to have a massive move down."
"9026440","9028220"," The VDA sells here. "
"9028440","9030020"," Oh it's selling it's sold today but."
"9030580","9032240"," I know what I know what the bears want."
"9032500","9033300"," Bears want like. "
"9033940","9035060"," Look at it right now."
"9038020","9041580"," Like bears want three eighty five thirty four."
"9043620","9046860"," And a lot of bears want even lower they want. "
"9047740","9050280"," Three oh nine three ten somewhere in there."
"9053140","9055540"," But you're not going to I don't think you get it in cash market without."
"9055540","9056940"," I don't know real money sound. "
"9057660","9061180"," I don't know maybe a maybe a fucking bank is like we're going on vacations."
"9061640","9062700"," Take the money and run."
"9063040","9063560"," I guess so. "
"9066450","9068170"," Unless you get underneath this line over here."
"9069170","9071250"," You'll know Phil on four twenty eight P's."
"9074130","9078290"," I think once you get underneath this line there could be a ball or trade so. "
"9080790","9082270"," It's after hours maybe."
"9082270","9087150"," If you're able to like get under here one two and reject."
"9087950","9090510"," There's a giant trade down here to four twenty eight. "
"9091610","9092770"," On spy."
"9096010","9097810"," Maybe you can get under there at the close."
"9100570","9101150"," Maybe. "
"9103370","9104630"," Tell you what though man."
"9105890","9107630"," Last time we were here."
"9108450","9109890"," Last time we were right here. "
"9111290","9112750"," NVDA went up like."
"9113430","9114910"," I'll measure it right now."
"9115150","9117070"," Last time we were here when what NVDA did. "
"9120420","9122000"," For the next few days."
"9123600","9124240"," It."
"9130800","9136160"," It traded from two ninety eight nine to excuse me. "
"9136980","9139900"," It traded the last similar time we were in this."
"9140240","9142520"," Let's see this right here."
"9144360","9149060"," It's the last time NVDA was right where we are the fucking right here. "
"9150160","9158640"," So right where NVDA is right now."
"9159940","9162120"," It's reaction was to."
"9163160","9169540"," Go from two ninety eight to four fucking forty. "
"9171160","9174960"," Four fucking forty went up forty fucking points."
"9177580","9178220"," Mmm."
"9179620","9181300"," Forty fucking points. "
"9185310","9188870"," That puts us at four sixty or something insane."
"9190970","9195410"," On NVDA so if you're a seller you have to get below this right."
"9196490","9199370"," You have to get below this red line right here you have to like. "
"9200030","9200730"," Get underneath."
"9203870","9206410"," Like one big blast through it."
"9207550","9208910"," And then get underneath there. "
"9209230","9210810"," So I'll either join you on that trade."
"9211610","9214710"," If you're able to hold under here right now I'm in calls to end of the day."
"9216230","9217930"," I'm not believing you unless we get underneath it. "
"9218170","9219910"," So there's your big fat red line right there."
"9221450","9226330"," If you get underneath this red line right here your daily trigger is down on."
"9229370","9235070"," Your daily trigger or our daily trigger is the target for me if you get underneath this red line is"
"9235070","9238450"," probably four twenty eight and change somewhere down here. "
"9238470","9241850"," So I'll draw it out for you what you need for that to be."
"9242350","9243390"," For that to happen."
"9245510","9246750"," Put it in there for you. "
"9247250","9248050"," You need to be."
"9249030","9250710"," It's not good enough to be down here."
"9251570","9253430"," It's not good enough to like you have to like. "
"9254390","9255770"," Do this kind of a thing."
"9257830","9259350"," And there's your target right there."
"9262570","9263590"," But you have to be underneath. "
"9264470","9267350"," It's not good enough to make all this testing means nothing."
"9267970","9269170"," This is a dip vibe situation."
"9269610","9270190"," I'll be honest with you. "
"9270330","9271370"," Not a not a sell the rip."
"9272830","9274090"," You sell it over here."
"9274450","9276930"," This is where you actually sell it right here somewhere in here. "
"9278790","9283450"," You need like the first break the second break then the third one will take you down here."
"9289990","9291170"," Still long calls here."
"9302010","9304890"," Yeah, maybe I just get so winky just texted me. "
"9304950","9307650"," Maybe I just get the crash puts now and just hold them with the calls."
"9308630","9310010"," Maybe I get them for tomorrow."
"9312870","9313590"," Not crash. "
"9313950","9314490"," Not really crash."
"9315830","9318030"," Four twenty eights or sixteen cents for tomorrow."
"9319710","9320890"," That seems reasonable. "
"9322310","9324610"," For like one penny they're saying we're not going there today."
"9330400","9331480"," Yeah, they're trying winky."
"9331640","9333320"," They're they're fucking working on it right now, bro. "
"9337310","9338670"," They're trying to do it right now."
"9338930","9340150"," They're all still only one penny."
"9342330","9344010"," There's the four twenty eight down there. "
"9345110","9346570"," I'm still long calls here too."
"9347530","9348270"," I haven't sold shit."
"9350450","9353010"," Four twenty eights still trading a penny in two pennies. "
"9370220","9371200"," They're really trying."
"9371440","9373160"," There's the pre market low right there."
"9375680","9376460"," And see it. "
"9380590","9382390"," I'm going to add to four thirty four C."
"9390620","9392160"," Don't leave me behind here."
"9399130","9401990"," I decided another fifty to four thirty four C's."
"9409740","9411160"," Yeah, they want this bad man. "
"9411360","9413200"," They want this revenge like really bad here."
"9413780","9415080"," In cash they want it."
"9418930","9421450"," I think they get it, but I don't think they get in cash. "
"9424510","9427070"," Four twenty eights are still one penny, two pennies."
"9427070","9428770"," I haven't bought any of those."
"9429110","9432090"," I had an order in for one penny on that crash there. "

"9921180","9922160"," some puts for today. "
"9923040","9927040"," So I might call them here on LaWam Live for just a moment try to put on."
"9927700","9931320"," And I don't want to buy the four twenty eighths at sixteen for tomorrow either."
"9932340","9934340"," You don't want to pay sixteen cents for those. "
"9935080","9944120"," I'd pay like eight cents or seven cents but I don't want to pay that."

"9970610","9972250"," See if they can sell this down."
"9973110","9976090"," You need to close underneath this yellow this red line right here. "
"9976230","9977190"," This is kind of a big deal."
"9979010","9981850"," I'm paying close attention to the hourly trigger on Apple."
"9983510","9985530"," Definitely sweating my balls off right now. "
"9986070","9987210"," Kind of scary here."
"9987770","9992790"," I got some thousands on this so I got some big money in this trade."
"10016460","10020420"," There's some premium now on this trade too so here's another example here. "
"10020560","10021480"," So just right now right."
"10023100","10026980"," Four twenty eighths for today are now two and three cents."
"10028080","10032800"," They haven't gone back down to one and two pennies so there is some premium being built into this"
"10032800","10033640"," downside move. "
"10034600","10037100"," I've got that's a hundred and seventeen."
"10037260","10038580"," I'm going to put on three hundred."
"10038980","10041200"," I can buy three hundred without calling my broker. "
"10041640","10044440"," I have my finger on the fucking trigger for these fucking things."
"10045160","10050320"," If we begin to roll at any point I actually won't give a fuck about the calls and just put"
"10050320","10051520"," this on and see if it rolls."
"10052220","10054680"," Maybe I can make a fucking couple grand in this trade. "
"10081120","10082900"," It's kind of cheap to three hundred dollar trade."
"10087570","10089210"," It's a nine hundred dollar trade now."
"10089690","10090790"," It's a nine hundred dollar trade. "
"10122210","10125170"," Watch out there's a rug being pulled right here."

"10178580","10184960"," Look at my four thirty-fives are being torched."
"10185080","10186460"," They were like I bought some at eight cents. "
"10187420","10192220"," Bought some at like seventeen cents and then I think at twenty seven or twenty one cents something"
"10192220","10192620"," like that."
"10193740","10196160"," I've got some four thirty fours that have been all over the place."
"10196160","10197240"," Bought them at eleven cents. "
"10197320","10198400"," Bought them at fourteen."
"10199600","10201860"," Bought them at oh just those two."
"10204460","10207460"," I'm not gonna get out of this because I got a I got my finger on a sell button here. "
"10208040","10209860"," Or not a sell but a buy put button."
"10210120","10230620"," I don't want to go to my history and see what the fuck it says but it's"
"10230620","10232340"," trading sixteen and four thirty four."
"10232500","10233160"," Four thirty-fives. "
"10233340","10234660"," I'm gonna have to take an hour at some point."
"10235180","10237220"," They're saying that we're not going up to four thirty-five."
"10237340","10238980"," That's like right the fuck up here dude. "
"10239560","10241460"," Tell me that we ain't going up there today."
"10255020","10260660"," I've got three hundred uh four twenty-eight p's that are set up to buy in case we do roll."
"10260980","10261700"," I haven't bought them yet. "
"10262420","10263160"," Just sitting there."
"10264180","10265560"," Long a fuck ton of calls."
"10294120","10296060"," Apple's still holding its hourly trigger. "
"10296580","10298440"," Trigger hasn't turned over yet."
"10299240","10300560"," Trigger is still heading higher."
"10302600","10304080"," Hasn't rolled as of yet. "
"10309020","10310940"," Velocity is beginning to turn bearish."
"10311480","10313800"," So ECB is currently speaking on CNBC."
"10313800","10316200"," So there's at least one more rate hike is needed. "
"10326850","10328770"," And I'm reading a story back here."
"10329070","10334770"," Fed Williams earlier said at 9.20 this morning said William said restoring price stability is of"
"10334770","10336150"," paramount importance."
"10337390","10345270"," And there was an article that I read about paramount and I believe Viacom for a merger and"
"10345270","10346330"," acquisition talk. "
"10347590","10356310"," From some uh in just television insiders on uh our television and they were saying that that ticker"
"10356310","10358510"," is prime for an MA."
"10359450","10366150"," I think it was trading 13 dollars 13.30 those past couple weeks was getting nice and low."
"10367270","10372750"," And the last bottom on it was like 950 or something or 980 baby. "
"10375310","10380590"," So I think I want to if I if we can get that ticker down to like nine or ten"
"10380590","10381050"," dollars."
"10382250","10383090"," That's para."
"10384210","10389630"," I'd like to pick it up at some point this year for MA season in the spring. "
"10391750","10393870"," And hope that maybe they would grab."
"10394090","10396750"," So I've traded it once last year for MA season."
"10397290","10402610"," They got ramped into MA season but there's nothing came down the pike for it. "
"10403790","10407970"," So I don't know why that that maybe think of it today because I was like I gotta bring up"
"10407970","10408990"," paramount on Monday."
"10410910","10419150"," But I don't know if it's if I put a stink bid in for um for leaps on it for"
"10419150","10425470"," the next uh I was thinking leaps for next um maybe like next year middle of the year."
"10426850","10431530"," So to get them the print for like February March on para. "
"10432150","10434370"," But I don't know that 13 is the right price."
"10434370","10436070"," I think it has to be like nine or ten."
"10436750","10440110"," And then it gets that merger and acquisition ramp in the spring time. "
"10440990","10442350"," That's para if you don't know it."
"10442830","10444450"," It's been a pretty good printer for leaps."
"10448010","10454370"," Although although we already traded that 13 dollars last year so I'm like yeah maybe the next low"
"10454370","10455870"," on it is like nine or ten bucks. "
"10459420","10460760"," Still long calls here."
"10474990","10477190"," Trying to dig myself off from a hole right now."
"10477990","10481590"," I'm getting ground down on my calls, sweating bullets. "
"10486100","10490320"," To some extent wish I had bought those fucking puts but I didn't."
"10490920","10492920"," I'm not gonna tell you that I did it and fucking buy them."
"10493260","10495200"," They were uh one penny and two pennies. "
"10495200","10497220"," The ask was two the bid was one."
"10497800","10500460"," The ask and bid is now uh two and three."
"10501880","10504980"," And I only had them set up for a hundred I should have bought fucking 300. "
"10506840","10508440"," Dirt fucking sheep hedge."
"10510240","10513760"," Tomorrow 4.28 though those are at 16 cents."
"10514020","10517460"," So I'm assuming that someone believes we're going down if not today tomorrow. "
"10518560","10525020"," So the June 27th 4.28 they're now 14 and 16 or 14 15 cents."
"10525340","10530180"," If I can get them at like eight cents I'd be interested seven eight cents something like that with"

"11489160","11491660"," I need a pretty big move down for them to print big."
"11566790","11571750"," So I've seen the Fed here giving no bids for the two-year note sale coming up at the top"

"11572370","11575290"," So again, Fed bidding for two-year notes, zero dollars, no bids."

"11674980","11677740"," The one thing that I'm afraid of here is theta burn. "
"11678280","11681340"," Between 130 and 230 in the afternoon, we'll start."
"11681520","11685980"," They'll start to torch calls and puts in here."
"11686740","11688080"," Another theta will kick in. "
"11688700","11691680"," So I might have to roll that position into tomorrow."
"11692680","11696900"," The tomorrow of 428P's were 16 cents earlier."
"11697500","11702260"," They're now 17 cents right now, but they're bouncing around as low as 14 cents. "

"11704780","11707860"," Still in 428 right now for today."
"11713620","11715400"," Maybe it'll pee again, dude. "

"11844400","11847440"," One minute's crossing the HT on Apple."
"11848440","11852300"," The five minute is about to touch the hourly trigger on Apple. "
"11860270","11864190"," So we're now 10 minutes away from the top of the hour where the US is due to sell $42"

"11866830","11871210"," The private cover seen at two to 90 with the prior high yield of four-spot of 3%."
"11871210","11876230"," So looking at the auction preview here, noting the primary dealers positions in the two to three "
"11876230","11881550","-year sector, they weren't at long around $6.3 billion in the weekend in June 14th. "
"11881570","11882870"," It's about five minutes right now."
"11882970","11887410"," You're going to be seeing the five-minute MT crossing the one-minute on Apple."
"11887850","11890410"," Also looking to the latest CFTC positioning data. "
"11891010","11894730"," That shows the speculators and net short around $1.03 million to..."
"11894730","11895730"," Could have a quick squeeze."
"11896230","11897830"," So this is the Apple line right here."
"11898210","11899870"," Watch what I've got going on here. "
"11899970","11900850"," It's actually higher, I think."
"11900850","11903410"," A potential source of covering the auction for the auction."
"11905150","11908090"," So you might see a quick squeeze for reversal right here. "
"11913250","11915910"," Just waiting on a confirmation for Apple to go down."
"11916150","11921470"," Analysts note today that Treasury's front end of the curve has unwound early gains as yields flip"
"11921470","11922910"," to slightly cheaper on the day."
"11923430","11927150"," After some selling into and out of the cash equity open. "
"11927890","11933650"," So as of around 1 PM and New York time, the US auctions $42 billion in these two-year notes."
"11934150","11938810"," Ahead of the five and seven-year note sales, which are taking place tomorrow and Wednesday."
"11939350","11943890"," So the auction yield is set to stop at the cheapest level since 2007, according to analysts. "
"11944470","11947470"," So again, this is regarding the two-year note sale at the top of the hour."
"11973400","11983090"," A little higher than that isn't it, it appears somewhere."
"12050070","12054670"," Just a few more minutes for that five-minute trigger to cross the hourly trigger on Apple. "
"12065940","12067980"," So we can show you that in a one-minute chart here."
"12080560","12084680"," Last time Apple came down here, ripped faces off to the upside."
"12085920","12090160"," Trying to catch this step right now with calls got stopped out. "
"12090620","12092120"," Bought some put protection here."
"12092760","12095040"," So we're going to wait and see what happens here."
"12096320","12101980"," If there's a rejection to the downside we're watching, this is Apple by the way, watching the five "
"12101980","12102780","-minute come down. "
"12103760","12107740"," We'll likely see a quick squeeze in Apple, and then we'll see if there's any follow-through to the"
"12107740","12108580"," downside here."
"12115940","12118720"," Or if it's just another chance to buy the dip."
"12127020","12130280"," So a quick squeeze coming up, we're going to watch this Apple HT. "
"12130740","12131800"," That's the red line up there."
"12133240","12135460"," That $186.41 on Apple."
"12136320","12139900"," I don't know if this is exact or if it's up here. "
"12140700","12143740"," It might be right here, this Apple HT."
"12144820","12145660"," Somewhere up in here."
"12152620","12153480"," Somewhere in here. "
"12153720","12155840"," Here, here, I can't tell exactly on spy."
"12160680","12163340"," So we are now five minutes away from the top of the hour."
"12163760","12165560"," Again, USD to sell $42 billion. "
"12165600","12166180"," Might be up there."
"12166920","12171440"," A private cover of $2.90 with the prior high yield of 4-spot of 3%."
"12171940","12177140"," So again, analysts do note that this auction yield is set to stop at the cheapest level since 2007,"
"12177400","12179280"," analysts producing a high yield on this auction. "
"12183920","12188860"," So again, this auction is ahead of the five-year net sale on Tuesday and seven-year net sale on"
"12188860","12189760"," Wednesday as well."
"12218260","12221240"," Apple coming back up right now to test it's 1MT."
"12235860","12238380"," Sellers need to stay below this red box right here. "
"12238900","12245260"," It's actually a yellow box and a red box up here, but trying to figure out where the Apple hourly"
"12245260","12248680"," trigger is and put it on a spy chart."
"12248920","12249620"," I really can't."
"12249760","12250300"," I think it's higher. "
"12250520","12255760"," I think it's up here somewhere, but to be in show to you right now, again, I'll beat this right"
"12255760","12256060"," now."
"12263770","12267230"," Sellers need a rejection here on this cross."
"12268250","12270290"," So you'll see this right here. "
"12271510","12279070"," Been running this down the entire morning once there once there once there and maybe a check there"
"12279070","12280230"," and then the further down."
"12282990","12292270"," Watch out for a pretty significant squeeze right here between Apple on 186.02 and 186.43. Another"
"12292270","12295930"," note here too though is last time Apple was down here."
"12296070","12296370"," This is me. "
"12296590","12299450"," So I'm trying to buy the spy about half an hour ago."
"12300590","12303570"," If you are south side, make sure you don't get caught in this."
"12304670","12306790"," Make sure this doesn't happen to you here. "
"12308510","12311730"," I'm on some crash puts in case of a rejection to the downside."
"12312250","12314250"," You actually get the bloodbath that you're looking for."
"12315950","12316990"," Let's see it right here. "
"12318210","12322010"," I just got to do the fucking down of a penny on those fucking puts now."
"12322430","12323130"," Now I'm pissed."
"12326670","12327990"," Fucking Sellers, man. "
"12330650","12333210"," They're now two cents at bottom for three."
"12336050","12338630"," So I'm going to leave those puts on all day long today."
"12339370","12340990"," Put stay on to end of day. "
"12341730","12343130"," There's kind of fucking cheap."
"12347830","12354400"," Ah, those stay on until end of day."
"12365120","12370540"," And I'll be really fucking pissed if they went to one because I had a bid in all morning for"
"12370540","12372140"," one penny and they wouldn't fucking fill. "
"12372920","12375620"," It's all fucking rage quit today if that happens."
"12378320","12380180"," And I'll be fucking pissed."
"12381240","12384580"," If I take a haircut on those fucking puts, I'm going to be fucking pissed. "
"12385720","12390040"," Is that an order in for like one penny like all through this bullshit here?"
"12390040","12390940"," Never caught a penny."
"12392960","12394920"," Say about a fucking stay at the two."
"12399110","12405650"," For a reversal to the upside, bulls are looking for apple above 186.60. I'll be eating with deep"
"12405650","12409250"," bits of coverage here about the top of the hour to get the treasuries when it should yield. "
"12412990","12418490"," This dream is sponsored by do like spies fucking do like spies, uh, hourly."
"12418990","12426290"," So winky spies fucking hourly or hourly velocity dude is like, it's not completely bearish."
"12426290","12428110"," It's that like 35, man. "
"12428650","12430210"," It's not a 50 or anything."
"12444480","12445920"," Still long puts here."
"12446660","12450700"," I think I'm going to leave them on until the end of the day until that they go to zero. "
"12453720","12455820"," It costs me $900 to buy."
"12463060","12467720"," Treasury when issued to your yield, four spot six, seven, eight percent ahead of this $42 billion"
"12467720","12468360"," option."
"12468560","12472340"," So again, four spot six, seven, eight percent for the treasuries when issued yield. "
"12494760","12497280"," Yeah, I see the, uh, I see that I'm getting above."
"12497380","12498000"," It's one and five."
"12498240","12502640"," If this is like a fucking relief here, man, like it's kind of pissing me off right now. "
"12502640","12505060"," I said like one great trade, one really bad trade."
"12505840","12508000"," I almost left the calls on and out of the puts earlier."
"12508400","12509140"," I'm like, ah, fuck it. "
"12509180","12510280"," I'll just ride both sides."
"12511160","12511960"," Whatever they print."
"12512980","12514820"," Like either side, I don't give a fuck. "
"12515760","12518000"," And now I don't want to buy the call side of my fuck."
"12518220","12519200"," There's so much money that puts on."
"12519300","12519720"," Let them die. "
"12535080","12539000"," So again, we are surely expecting the results from the two year note sale now."
"12539220","12540800"," I'll be leading with the bits of coverage here."
"12540800","12551200"," Yeah, we're so"
"12551200","12552940"," close on that daily trigger, man. "
"12553120","12557840"," Like the daily trigger today is at four, two, nine, zero, five, eight."
"12557920","12560060"," It's so fucking close, man."
"12563020","12567280"," Like it makes me want to put a three month call on and don't fucking look at it until fucking"
"12567280","12567640"," fall. "
"12567880","12572800"," Number two to 86, two to 86 for the high rate of four spot, six, seven percent, four spot, six,"
"12572960","12575200"," seven percent for the two year note high rate."
"12576740","12579480"," Like, I really care about this little bit down here."
"12579940","12582180"," Like, look at how close we are to it, Winky. "
"12583080","12585220"," It's like right fucking here, man."
"12586040","12589880"," So primary dealers are taking 13 spot, three, four percent of this two year note sale."
"12590400","12591000"," Directed 18. "
"12591300","12592600"," It's so close."
"12593080","12595520"," Directed 68 spot, four, nine percent."
"12596120","12600180"," So you can just repeat there the high rates coming in at four spots, six, seven percent for this"
"12600180","12601040"," two year note sale. "
"12603080","12607260"," That is compared to the pre-sale winning studio, the four spot, six, seven, eight percent."
"12643070","12648430"," So you're surprised, but as a reverse stat, well, make sure you yield down one spot, two basis"
"12648430","12651030"," points on the day at four spot, seven, three, eight percent."
"12651790","12654010"," And let's look at SPX really quick. "
"12654690","12655930"," Like, this is how close we are."
"12661680","12664020"," Like, let me explain how close we are."
"12664020","12667540"," Let me show it, let me be a better visual of how close we are. "
"12683530","12691630"," So many hand grenades and horseshoes, like right there, boom, right there, boom, right there, boom,"
"12691650","12692710"," right there, boom."
"12693090","12694710"," This was the fucking monster run."
"12695330","12701530"," And we're like right fucking there, like, just that little fucking bit, boom, right there. "
"12706110","12707470"," We are close."
"12708170","12709250"," This is SPX, by the way."
"12719530","12723890"," And it's like right here, like, 428, nine, 17. "
"12726110","12727910"," It's like right fucking there."
"12735890","12739050"," Yeah, so I started measuring this here from the top."
"12739230","12740190"," It was three percent. "
"12740830","12742850"," We haven't even gotten three percent yet."
"12744070","12749770"," So I had it down here in this white line because I was like, yeah, the daily is going to"
"12749770","12751990"," come up and eventually fucking tag that shit."
"12752700","12754470"," Like, 431, 430. "
"12756250","12758790"," Like, you didn't even get a pullback of seven percent."
"12759230","12760910"," Like, the seven percent pullback here."
"12762270","12766490"," And the top is today, this week, today. "
"12768270","12772250"," That's seven percent down to 4144, 414."
"12772850","12773970"," It was 410 last week."
"12775470","12776630"," This week, it's 414. "
"12777250","12780990"," So next week, it'll be, you know, fucking 420 right here."
"12781510","12783290"," We're only a 5% pullback."
"12783490","12785830"," I mean, that just shows like we didn't pull back shit. "
"12787230","12787830"," Nothing."
"12798010","12807790"," At the rate we're going down, man, the time we get there, maybe it'll be right here,"
"12808110","12808410"," 430."
"12818350","12820990"," I just want to buy that yellow fucking line. "
"12822390","12825670"," It's been since May 24th."
"12825670","12827550"," It's now, it's been a full month."
"12828410","12832010"," It's been 30 fucking days before we could buy this fucking thing down here. "
"12834350","12837620"," And it's this close."
"12837960","12838960"," This is it right here."
"12840180","12841860"," That's how close we are to it. "
"12847490","12848590"," It's a one minute chart."
"12850070","12857360"," And that really is where they got to stay right there."
"12857580","12861260"," The moment we break above this shit, there's a one minute chart, but I want you to see this. "
"12862020","12868720"," Like the minute that we break above that red line right here, we're going to fucking squeeze and"
"12868720","12869360"," slam that."
"12873920","12876520"," So these bears better get fucking selling."
"12877020","12877520"," That's my point. "
"12885560","12888240"," They got to stay below the apple line right here."
"12892990","12895230"," They don't fucking stay below the apple line."
"12895370","12896050"," They're going to be fucked. "
"12906550","12915910"," Yeah, apples price target to the downside is 180 31."
"12918030","12918970"," It's pretty well."
"12919210","12920170"," I don't know if that's their full. "
"12920770","12922610"," I don't know that you'll get that deep."
"12924930","12931210"," They don't normally tag exactly their their hourly trigger."
"12931430","12933710"," They get a lot of fucking buyers that step in. "
"12933790","12939830"," I'd probably expect it to go to like 185, 184, and then see a dip eye on apple."
"12940130","12941570"," I don't know that you get the full 180."
"12941990","12944670"," I don't I don't see how it happens in cash market. "
"12945290","12947470"," Maybe you'll see it in after hours or something."
"12948610","12953950"," But like 185 180 would be like heaven for a bear."
"12962470","12964910"," Those are my stops are going to be on that trade too. "
"12964990","12967470"," Anything above that red bar, man, this shit right here."
"12968110","12972530"," One up squeeze enough to go back to calls again, but you'll suck fucking balls."
"12974830","12977710"," You'll have to leave the puts on and run this up with it. "
"12978910","12981330"," Trade this bullshit up to 435."
"13006510","13009730"," We got 104 34 C, but I haven't bought him yet."
"13011250","13013990"," I got him set up just in case we still hold on. "
"13014930","13017450"," Uh oh, we're doing here."
"13017450","13024330"," There we go."
"13024470","13025150"," That looks right, right?"
"13025730","13025870"," Okay. "
"13027970","13030130"," Kind of like last chance bears here."
"13036090","13037930"," Seller stops are right above here."
"13074020","13075280"," It's like I always feel weird. "
"13075560","13078360"," Like when I'm if I remember like on the wrong side of a trade."
"13079520","13084080"," When I start like I'm gonna get rid of the calls and buys puts and the calls and this."
"13084560","13087020"," That should happen to me once or twice in a day. "
"13087960","13089020"," I'm like fuck this."
"13089400","13093320"," Like if we start doing that bullshit, I'll just start throwing file."
"13093420","13095520"," I'll just start buying cheap calls and puts every day. "
"13095580","13099880"," Ride them into fucking three four P and the or not three four like two 30 in the afternoon and"
"13099880","13101200"," just let one side print."
"13102380","13105600"," We did that back in my fear when we were doing that."
"13106080","13109680"," I want to say March in December we were doing that shit. "
"13109680","13113000"," And we were getting some decent fucking prints."
"13113620","13115280"," You could just buy both sides or cheap."
"13115900","13117760"," One side would print eventually during the day. "
"13118100","13120040"," Then you just closed it out for the day and made your money."
"13123910","13125130"," Leave that right there."
"13138260","13141920"," HYG trying to make a comeback to the 7432 on the 129. "
"13142520","13144380"," Vic's fucking wants to roll over."
"13145120","13147140"," Get ready to get squeezed out Sellers."
"13149920","13150400"," Motherfucker. "
"13157020","13157700"," 500."
"13166700","13169560"," Now long 428 P 434."
"13170060","13172700"," I got a hundred fucking calls on 434 C."
"13173420","13174900"," He's fucks man. "
"13176940","13178360"," Now I'm fucking pissed."
"13179520","13181520"," I ain't selling those puts because they're worthless."
"13182420","13183580"," They're worth this when I bought them. "
"13184280","13187700"," And I got a 434 C hundred contracts going big today."
"13188440","13190500"," He's fucking motherfuckers dude."
"13190700","13192520"," Can't get it done in fucking cash market. "
"13195080","13197140"," Fucking revenge trade now."
"13200040","13202400"," Fucking Vix is about to roll the fuck over."
"13203740","13204900"," NVDA with a bid. "
"13206220","13207400"," IWM with a bid."
"13207960","13208740"," Nasdaq with a bid."
"13212460","13214600"," Should have just left the calls on earlier. "
"13215480","13216760"," And fucking let them die."
"13217000","13218440"," Put the, I should have left the calls on."
"13218580","13220040"," Put the puts on and said fuck it. "
"13220140","13221160"," Wherever we're at at the end of the day."
"13221820","13223300"," I'll take the fucking money and run."
"13229030","13231270"," Yeah I should have stayed in Columbus for a more day. "
"13231690","13233770"," You know what's fucked up too is that I drove back."
"13234370","13238030"," It was a four hour drive back and I haven't stopped since."
"13238630","13241150"," It's like I got back, so when I left right. "
"13241910","13248770"," So remember I was telling you that I was, uh, I was, um, I fucking, um, took a, uh, uh,"
"13248910","13249550"," what do you call it?"
"13249790","13256430"," Um, fucking, I hear that shit's called clear stuff and like, thinned it all out and, uh, seemed"
"13256430","13257330"," taped that tent."
"13258030","13263730"," I left that tent up while I was gone to dry and it wound up like raining the entire time"
"13263730","13264290"," I was gone."
"13265470","13272930"," So I came home, uh, yesterday and they fucking, there was like a fucking tornado warnings and shit. "
"13274310","13277970"," So the tents in my backyard and I hadn't staked it down."
"13278450","13281670"," And it was like right, ready to fucking blow away out of my yard."
"13282330","13284690"," So I was all pissed off yesterday about the tent. "
"13285930","13287750"," Uh, so it was dry."
"13288050","13289630"," So I was like, all right, get this thing down."
"13290070","13292950"," I'm gonna get this thing fucking put away as fast as possible. "
"13293750","13295550"," So I haven't really slept a bunch."
"13295730","13298890"," Traded, uh, traded futures last, our, our futures last night."
"13303250","13304510"," Yeah, silicone man. "
"13304510","13307290"," It took, um, what's that stuff called?"
"13307790","13313030"," Uh, it took, um, silicone and mineral spirits."
"13314010","13320190"," And then I painted it all on the, uh, I painted it all on the, uh, the tent seams."
"13320850","13329610"," Now some guy was telling me that some guy was telling me that I could thin it even more and"
"13329610","13337770"," put it into a pump sprayer and spray the entire tent down with like a really, really, really low"
"13337770","13339630"," concentrated version of it. "
"13340890","13344590"," And that, uh, if I did that, it would seal it permanently."
"13345670","13351050"," I wouldn't have to worry about, uh, spraying silicone onto the tent ever again under the fabric."
"13351470","13352490"," I've never done it. "
"13352650","13354810"," Some unsure of myself doing it."
"13355370","13359790"," I don't want to, this tent was like, it wasn't expensive, but it was 400, I think it was 400"
"13359790","13361630"," bucks, something like that."
"13363650","13369990"," It's like right now all I did was I did the silicone and then I sprayed or the silicone like,"
"13370170","13377670"," um, homey job, like home based idea, like, thinned it out, painted all this, all the, uh, seams and"
"13377670","13383290"," then, um, painted all the seams and then I sprayed it with the cans of stuff. "
"13385090","13388010"," But this guy was like, you could actually make it even thinner."
"13388510","13398870"," And I guess the mineral spirits, uh, evaporate and just leave behind a fine silicone coating and"
"13398870","13402490"," that silicone coating will be permanent unlike the spray on stuff."
"13403030","13404950"," And I still have a tube of that shit. "
"13405170","13408010"," So I could do it, I guess."
"13408790","13409590"," I've never done it though."
"13409710","13411050"," I've never sprayed an entire tent. "
"13411050","13415450"," I've, as a matter of fact, I've never painted a tent with silicone before."
"13415910","13420450"," I've done it with like the little tubes and shit, but I've never done it with an actual tube of"
"13420450","13421330"," 100% silicone."
"13425830","13428030"," This stream is sponsored by Tickshrike. "
"13428550","13430450"," So I've never, never, ever done that."
"13437450","13439310"," The other tent was dry, man."
"13439530","13440930"," The whole weekend I was gone, I came home. "
"13440930","13443970"," I did check the inside, not a single drip in there."
"13444530","13446750"," But what I don't want to do is have to spray it again."
"13447190","13456490"," So, uh, this one, this guy that was talking about, uh, doing the thinning of, of silicone had said"
"13456490","13463630"," that if you, if you do it with the real silicone and you pump spray it on, yeah, they're going"
"13463630","13464710"," to get squeezed out right here. "
"13464950","13466590"," Sellers are going to get squeezed hard and heavy."
"13466590","13469450"," Price targeted to the upside, $4.33, $62."
"13477300","13479760"," And, uh, so I have never done a pump spray. "
"13479920","13486800"," So what the guy had said to do is to take, uh, uh, what's funny is someone's just mentioned flex"
"13486800","13487180"," sale."
"13487480","13489580"," I've used flex sale in a can before."
"13490780","13492260"," Uh, that stuff was good. "
"13492660","13493840"," I'd have used that before."
"13495280","13500440"," Uh, canned flex sales, uh, liquid latex, or not liquid latex, was liquid, liquid silicone."
"13501300","13502420"," I've used that once. "
"13502420","13505500"," No, buterol tape I have used."
"13506300","13510620"," I keep buterol tape when I go back off cut, what I do, like back road stuff."
"13511260","13515480"," I keep buterol, buterol tape with me, not specifically flex sale. "
"13515960","13519120"," But I think flex sale tape is just buter, buterol tape."
"13519380","13522220"," It's like you, B-U-T-Y-L or something."
"13522820","13523340"," Yes. "
"13523660","13525420"," Again, I used the Fed Reverse Reaper facility."
"13525760","13526700"," Lowest since May 2022."
"13528920","13532680"," I don't know if I'm pronouncing that right, but buterol tape, I do keep some of that stuff. "
"13533240","13534300"," That stuff's badass."
"13534620","13536500"," You put that shit on anything and it ain't ever coming off."
"13537360","13537760"," Ever. "
"13539860","13542280"," Like you put that shit on anything, it's never coming off."
"13542560","13546700"," And I think that's, I think that's what flex sale, like, tries to say that it is or something."
"13548840","13549380"," Seam grip. "
"13556910","13562760"," Um, yeah, I made a good trade this morning."
"13562940","13563740"," I made money this morning."
"13564540","13566760"," Uh, so I'm not too fucked up right now. "
"13566900","13568640"," I'm like not doing too much damage."
"13569540","13571940"," Uh, I made money on a large trade this morning."
"13572220","13575060"," So like I don't, uh, a couple of things of note here for you guys. "
"13575680","13578360"," So when I buy, when I go into trades, I scale into them."
"13578460","13580620"," I get like 20 contracts or 25."
"13581280","13582980"," Not, I don't normally do 100. "
"13583460","13586380"," It's usually like 25, 25 and add on to a position."
"13587300","13590620"," Uh, and then you have to think about price of what I'm buying too."
"13590680","13592960"," So these calls that I, are these puts that I own. "
"13593880","13596280"," Uh, they were 300, but they cost me 900."
"13596280","13599580"," They didn't cost me like 3000 or $5,000."
"13600380","13604780"," Uh, say if they consider the costs that they're costing me as well, not just the number of"
"13604780","13605240"," contracts. "
"13606480","13611680"," Uh, and then of course, uh, I'll, I'll give you whatever, whatever I'm up or down on the day today,"
"13611680","13612800"," I'll let you know at the end of the day today."
"13613680","13614560"," I don't even know right now."
"13614640","13619580"," I'm sitting on my fucking, um, with the option chain open in a position and I don't want to click"
"13619580","13620120"," back through. "
"13621660","13623480"," And I'm on a bunch of fucking calls again."
"13623620","13625260"," I'm on fucking 434s again."
"13626280","13628580"," I got puts still and I got calls again. "
"13629220","13631620"," And I should have just fucking left those calls on."
"13631840","13633860"," So whatever, it's whatever the fuck it is."
"13634840","13637680"," Now I'm fucking long both and I'm not selling either. "
"13637980","13639600"," Until one side fucking print."
"13639880","13643380"," So they better fucking, they better fucking, I'm swearing now."
"13643720","13645420"," They better fucking close it right here. "
"13645580","13648160"," Cause if they go this way or that way, I'm going to make some money."
"13648980","13649800"," Either way."
"13651900","13653580"," So do your thing spoos. "
"13654720","13656520"," But a beetle tape is what I've got."
"13656840","13662780"," So this fucking, or the beetle tape I use for all kinds of shit."
"13663000","13669720"," Like at 1 30 p.m. Eastern time, we expect comments from ECB's Lagard who gives welcoming remarks at"
"13669720","13673860"," the opening reception of the ECB forum on central banking and Sintra. "
"13674080","13675100"," Yeah, that means shit to me."
"13675100","13676040"," I'm going to mute this motherfucker."
"13676180","13677340"," It's like beetle tape I use. "
"13678020","13682320"," Like I do, like I did White Rim Trail and I used to live in the west."
"13682320","13686360"," So if I like ripped off a bumper or something, you use that shit and slap it on there."
"13686840","13688040"," It ain't ever coming off. "
"13689940","13691960"," And then like you can use it for anything."
"13692280","13695360"," Like you get like a hole in something, you slap it on the inside."
"13698380","13701080"," Canvas tents, you can put it on that for a whole. "
"13706040","13715760"," But I did use, I used, so I have a house that had a basement with this really weird"
"13715760","13718560"," time period where the basement was floating."
"13719420","13729680"," So in between having like a, like a, it's like a basement foundation where they"
"13729680","13734800"," have like a drain tile and then they have a cut around the entire floor."
"13736460","13742000"," So it's like a concrete floor on your basement and about a two inches off of it. "
"13742580","13747920"," There's a line, a cut around it all the way around your base like a floating basement floor."
"13749120","13754100"," And these are like homes that were between not even traditional."
"13754520","13761600"," I guess I want to say like turn before turn of the century, you had dirt floors and then the"
"13761600","13768160"," first concrete floors that they made had that cut with a drain tile going around them. "
"13768160","13775200"," And then of course they had modern basements which are until the 1970s and 1990s."
"13776320","13777560"," That's the modern basement."
"13777760","13779980"," Now you have the current basement configuration. "
"13780620","13785240"," That's when they wrap the entire outside of the building and stuff like that."
"13785380","13789900"," That's the only one you can actually live in a basement is like post late 90s."
"13790820","13794180"," Squeezing higher right now, relief rally in store for the bulls. "
"13796300","13799960"," I'm going to check that Apple HT right now."
"13806060","13810240"," So what I did on that was say Apple HT is still higher."
"13810240","13813560"," Apple HT is at 186.41 so it's a little bit higher, it's up here somewhere. "
"13818370","13821770"," So that house, I've got a house an Airbnb right?"
"13822270","13831150"," And what I did was I blasted out the hole all the way around between the concrete wall and the"
"13831150","13835310"," concrete floor and I got gallons of that liquid latex."
"13836390","13841650"," And I poured it all the way around the corners of the floor like the entire basement and it like"
"13841650","13846890"," gripped and sealed that whole like took that foundation and just bonded it together."
"13847530","13850010"," And the silicone is still kind of like bouncy. "
"13850770","13857530"," So it gives like the flexibility that you need in between the two concrete portions."
"13858510","13865090"," Like you try to like you try to like get concrete to like hit like two pieces of concrete and"
"13865090","13866590"," try to try to bond it."
"13866790","13875910"," It's it's really hard to do but with silicone like a big fucking bucket of silicone gives it"
"13875910","13882170"," flexibility and it has grip like when you put silicone on shit that shit may never coming off"
"13882170","13886850"," unless it starts flaking right like silicone is like it's on once it's on it's on. "
"13888990","13891690"," Yeah still bouncy exactly like it had flexibility."
"13892790","13897630"," I still own that fucking house never had a problem with it never had a problem doing that."
"13898230","13904310"," So it's sealed the basement so no water no intrusion from that from that crack around the outside"
"13904310","13907190"," and the floor is still kind of floating. "
"13914830","13918830"," Yeah exactly like my basement has has silicone titties now."
"13926340","13930260"," Still have a hedge on here I need to make back three pennies off of that trade."
"13932160","13939420"," Have to cover the hedge in the market right now I've got some calls here got torched on original I"
"13939420","13941180"," got original position made money. "

"14212860","14224530"," I'm gonna look at it right now because I'm already fucking Marty I'll horde up about it I'm"
"14224530","14231090"," already fucking all hot and wet about it so let's take a look 443 right where are we at right"
"14231090","14237270"," now 432 we're gonna set this trade up we're gonna monitor we're not gonna trade it right now but"
"14237270","14247140"," the next one of two weeks it's a good"
"14247140","14254240"," fucking trade man I'm afraid to do it tell anyone about it I was gonna start telling everybody"
"14254240","14260180"," about it last year of the year before or something but I was afraid because I didn't want to go"
"14260180","14269560"," to jail with FINRA or SEC I didn't here's the worst part I don't want to I don't want to"
"14269560","14277900"," impact the market like I'm afraid that if we get like 80 million dollars on one fucking trade that"
"14277900","14285980"," they're gonna they're gonna we're gonna get fucked they're gonna like either dump it on us they'll"
"14285980","14292020"," trade against it if it's that big so here's the trade for so how about this let's talk about this"
"14292020","14304300"," right now so let's talk about this trade so this is a cool time to talk about it because"
"14304300","14312300"," we're getting ready for it okay so let's look back or let's let's open our view here let's like"
"14312300","14320300"," breathe a little bit okay so just take take it easy here for a minute so it's a 30-minute"
"14320300","14331640"," chart okay um it's pretty fucking regular printer now"
"14331640","14341590"," it's 30-minute chart right here right I mean this"
"14341590","14348550"," is uh October right here right sometimes we go below it so here's the daily trigger we were and"
"14348550","14352870"," we're going below it here because of the volatility of the weekly and the monthly this is back in"
"14352870","14358450"," December I remember everybody was like we're gonna crash and we actually had one um we actually had"
"14358450","14366310"," one high risk moment of crash down here I think um I think um what's his face and I were"
"14366310","14371530"," like yep there's a moment here we could crash there was actually a risk of crash uh I believe in"
"14371530","14376630"," here somewhere then we had no risk of crash up here I think he asked because right in here we"
"14376630","14384690"," had a risk of crash uh but anyways uh this white this yellow line right here is pretty predictable"
"14385370","14391290"," very predictable uh and when we when we get on it or below it we usually get a print off"
"14391290","14399990"," of it time is an issue like it could print right away or it could take like fucking four weeks"
"14402090","14408710"," another issue with this trade is you might miss out like let's say you get the print any of this"
"14408710","14413830"," stuff you have to trade zero dates or weeklies you can't actually you don't want to take this trade"
"14413830","14420490"," a second time it's like a one and done uh but you get in a bull market bull run you"
"14420490","14428710"," get uh about nine to twelve chances a year sometimes more but like nine to twelve so we're close to"
"14428710","14435770"," it right now uh the point being here is that in a call spread it wouldn't matter if you broke"
"14435770","14442970"," below because you're going to come right back over time it's it's not going to matter if you if we"
"14442970","14448250"," bought him here and go up right away it's not going to matter if we go lower and then a"
"14448250","14452530"," three months later or a month and a half later it comes back up right that's what the great thing"
"14452530","14457510"," about a spread is you don't give a fuck about this you just care that down the road it comes"
"14457510","14465230"," into your in the money right um it's a pretty good trade like this pretty consistent trade you're"
"14465230","14473370"," going to get interest of buyers down here now sometimes uh this trade will fail you if we go below"
"14473370","14479950"," the daily trigger incorrect down to the orange line right now that's it's at four thirteen uh you"
"14479950","14486990"," would need more time on that trade so let's say you took the trade right here and i'm like okay"
"14486990","14494890"," loading up right fifty thousand bucks and we start blasting down i need to have done two things"
"14494890","14501050"," make sure that it'll come back up again and that my strikes were not too far out the money right"
"14501050","14507890"," so it's like a sweet spot here so this is your protection to the downside right so let's say i"
"14507890","14513930"," buy some uh call spreads here or in this vicinity i need them the kind of being the money not"
"14513930","14519110"," in the money but it's only slightly out of the money and have enough time in case i get trapped"
"14519110","14526970"," in that trade it'll come back up and actually print and maybe at the three month mark so i'm going"

"21268650","21276790"," these streaming services all of these tv services um are gonna go they're gonna consolidate"
"21276790","21283670"," i think they're all dead i think like it's gonna be wild and it just becomes like a tent pole"
"21283670","21289470"," like uh i have to see this because i already play this game or i have to see this because"

"21331230","21337810"," it's not a good movie but it it feeds that uh the what's good about john wick is it feeds"
"21338330","21344770"," or it's a good representation of what people today want what young kids want so let's be honest or"
"21344770","21350190"," you guys might be like it's a great movie and that's not a bad thing it just means that that's"
"21350190","21356130"," the taste that a young audience has so you should see a lot of our film and tv move into"
"21356710","21362510"," that kind of a structure i don't know if that's bad or good i guess someone like me i i"
"21362510","21368610"," appreciate great movies uh i think the days of that are over generally speaking generally not fully"
"21368610","21374290"," but you know generally and the scary part though is that uh you'll get a lot of consolidation"
"21374290","21383250"," because of that due to that being the case uh if i was a movie maker i would cater to"
"21383250","21389470"," what brings asses and seats right they're not going to cater to what i like they're going to cater"
"21389470","21395990"," to asses and seats so if that's if the next generation of asses and seats that are making those"
"21395990","21401610"," decisions is a very short attention span that's where i would put my money if i was a movie maker"
"21401610","21412460"," right for a producer not a maker but a producer yeah they've been different the past 20 years um"
"21412460","21417060"," i agree with that too they've been different but we're talking about a whole generation that has no"
"21418760","21423320"," um it's like when you're uh how do i explain i was to explain that i was talking a second"
"21423320","21429220"," a week about this i think the other day and i was like i was the first um generation of"
"21429580","21440400"," real video game players and um access to the internet and i was young so"
"21440400","21447100"," i was able to adapt uh i i was interested in it it was the future for me my parents"
"21447900","21456260"," were too old for that right so like they use it but they're not the creators of it the developers"
"21456260","21462980"," of it and the hey we like this and we don't like that and that kind of stuff so like"
"21462980","21469020"," i have to really truly consider what a child likes today because what a child likes say they they"
"21469020","21476180"," grow older and they're fully immersed in it like it's not like me seeing old movies and new movies"
"21476180","21485220"," right it's just this is their whole experience like their whole childhood is this experience that's"
"21485220","21495040"," their expectation they got zero interest inputs none my whole interest here is um every quarter"
"21495040","21502160"," buying a dip that's my interest so as we come in to end a quarter here uh getting zero interest"
"21502160","21512060"," in this just positioning right now yeah i played pong definitely played pong played pong"
"21512060","21520680"," clico had a tari had uh in television had first intendos had a c64 had an apple 2e apple 2f"

"21540380","21548020"," yeah no john wick is terrible it's like absolutely dog shit i could i could rattle off 20 movies"
"21548020","21556120"," that are like that that are better but i'm like my comparisons are like uh like to me like the"
"21556120","21562880"," 70s or the height of cinema part of the 90s it started to change in 2015 2016 it's when you"
"21562880","21572380"," started to see a market market change in cinema about 2015 16 was glaring uh and so it's like you"
"21572380","21580740"," see the shift which is fine i got no problems with it it's just what it is yeah i played"
"21580740","21588300"," asteroids they haven't looked to see what the pin is today i'm gonna assume it's right here they're"
"21590380","21595880"," grinding me dude i'm down in one fucking penny dude i want to rage right now i want to fucking"
"21595880","21604840"," rage like fucking pure fucking rage on these i want like i'm pissed right now for a different"
"21604840","21612560"," reason but that's to do with the uh the options market right now i'm mad at the amount up to"
"21612560","21619960"," the options market right now they're not gonna print this shit either they'll print the number but"
"21619960","21624800"," they won't print the options so i'm not going to play this fucking game this week for for end of"
"21624800","21635260"," month normally i don't normally i take this week off this is the week i take off so"
"21635260","21639460"," this this i'm angry this quarter that i didn't take the week off already when i get i gotta save"
"21639460","21649400"," it for fucking 4th of july yeah early"
"21649400","21656980"," 90s were great uh 2000s were kind of good early 90s were like a really great time on cinema i"
"21656980","21661880"," went my one of my biggest issues is uh or not big as i got a bunch of them but"
"21661880","21671880"," the blending of um technology and practical effects is an issue we never really made"
"21671880","21681680"," the jump to where uh to where blue screens are really good at tricking the eye"
"21681680","21691440"," so like a lot of the um cgi to me is glaring um like i watched"
"21691440","21698620"," dune recently and like the original dune to me had real problems too right so i was looking like"
"21698620","21704480"," dune's a good example there was like a like a segue of dune really the original dune really sucked"
"21704480","21710220"," for a bunch of reasons and the new dune to me sucks for the same not the same but for"
"21710220","21718980"," other reasons and i wish that those those two things had come together and made great movie making"
"21718980","21726460"," uh it's like the new dune to me everyone loves new dune right and i couldn't get over how clean"
"21726460","21735880"," everything was uh like the cleanliness like it looks beautiful um if i was looking at digital art"
"21735880","21744480"," but it doesn't look real and so that blending of real and fake uh to where your trick's your eye"
"21744480","21752860"," is important um and then another thing that bothers me now is actors male female i don't care uh"
"21752860","21760440"," they look like stars or not stars they look like hollywood so they used to be able to have actors"
"21760440","21766540"," and actresses or actors whatever you want to call them would have backgrounds that were people that"
"21766540","21771700"," you might know or see so when i go to what i'd fly to hollywood or hang out in hollywood"
"21771700","21776720"," everyone looks the same to me it's like a look everyone's teeth are perfect everyone's got worked"
"21776720","21781180"," on even if it's subtle but if you were to go to like um if you were to go to"
"21781180","21786540"," like uh Pennsylvania some pits play some Pittsburgh you know and you're like oh that guy right"
"21786540","21794320"," there looks like a real guy that is fucking with my perception that's like it's like breaking my"
"21794320","21799360"," sense of reality or my or my sense of wonder when i watch a movie now it's like when i"
"21799360","21808820"," watch a movie i'm like ah this wouldn't these people wouldn't be doing this i know these people in"
"21808820","21820510"," hollywood they're not they're they're not that person what"
"21820510","21830150"," is it's clinical yeah there's a um fuck i'm gonna sell this uh there's this like um it's it breaks"
"21830150","21835470"," the um it breaks the um what does it call it's a name for it when you're breaking uh like"
"21835470","21845420"," it's not fifth wall um the bully like your belief it's hard to get clients to cast real people"
"21845420","21852420"," he does a good job at it still is uh england does a good job at it um asian cinema"
"21852420","21857520"," does a good job at it australia to an extent does a good job at it sometimes they'll they'll load"
"21857520","21863260"," a film with american stars that are from those countries but if you're watching there there's"
"21863260","21869540"," cinema they are the tv shows cinema you can i'm like yeah i could see that guy uh being on"
"21869540","21874040"," a subway with me or i could see that guy walking out of street with me or but you know"
"21874040","21878860"," if i was in a job or something they look like a still to some extent you can still find"
"21878860","21885600"," another cinema or it's believable yeah fourth wall i don't know it's not fourth wall uh fourth wall"
"21885600","21892500"," is when you break it just talk to somebody there's one it's a suspension of uh belief it's when"
"21892500","21898520"," you're pulled out of the when you're pulled out of belief like it's a suspension of belief so"
"21898520","21903180"," there's like a contract when someone does a tv show or a movie with you there's a contract there's"
"21903180","21909440"," a bunch of factors that play into this like is this believable to you and when they're able to do"
"21909440","21915400"," that it's a very fascinating thing uh you don't you you're you're pulled into this movie or tv show"
"21915400","21921720"," and for that two hours or three hours you didn't even know the time passed and you were just"
"21921720","21930570"," wrapped up in that that thing right yeah full immersion into it so i get it breaks for me"
"21933950","21951740"," everything's too clean i'm like real life isn't like this i was like you"
"21951740","21959760"," know what a good way to describe it uh the original uh star wars the millennium falcon uh if you"
"21959760","21965380"," were watching it you could you could you felt like you could touch the millennium falcon right now"
"21965380","21969440"," you could reach through the screen touch that thing and it was a real thing like there was a real"
"21969440","21976180"," spaceship um alien was like that alien was like you could look inside that that film and go that"
"21976180","21985140"," looks like a real spaceship you can see the wear and tear and all the equipment um there was a"
"21985140","21989980"," realness to it um a lot of stunts used to be like that too ask ask anyone that there's stunts"
"21989980","21995160"," they'll tell you the same thing right uh there's like a the explosions used to be like that they"
"21995160","22002120"," were dangerous shit to do i realized that people were like you can't do that anymore um but there"
"22002120","22007600"," was like a blending of that if we could do that with effects uh that would be fucking awesome right"
"22007600","22014360"," it's like when i was looking at the sand in dune i was like i've been in deserts like that"
"22014360","22021120"," but even then when a close-up shot you like if you go to a real desert uh from a"
"22021120","22027100"," far it looks really clean but then when you get up close to it right you can actually see um"
"22027100","22036100"," the flora and fauna within a within a um a desert so when you don't see that um or like"
"22036100","22050020"," the different specs of sand all these things it it uh it uh doesn't fool the eye anymore yeah"
"22050020","22056940"," that's a uh lain mire just said nail uh uh blom camp has a great aesthetic absolutely hundred"
"22056940","22063820"," percent uh what was that movie inception or something uh like the spaceships looked goofy but they"
"22063820","22068500"," looked real there's like a real feeling to it like yeah i could see that happening i could see me"
"22068500","22076560"," in that movie and that's part of a movie experience right i'm a nobody and could i see myself in"
"22076560","22087940"," that role that's how part of movie making i'm"
"22087940","22094640"," just burning shit here you're like take your hundred dollars and get out of here i'm like fuck you"
"22094640","22102680"," know what a fucking shitty day like great start to the day uh up and down side great start to"
"22102680","22109360"," the up and down made some good trades in the beginning horrible fucking trades in the middle and"
"22109360","22118240"," right now i'm getting torched a second time of the day yeah predators like that too right predator"
"22118240","22125200"," was a great film um i mean some of this stuff gets dated too i recently watched uh litha weapons"
"22125200","22133180"," series and it was dated um but there was some risk taking taken and still in that you know what"
"22133180","22139080"," i'm fascinated by right now is that a lot of conversations get on a one minute chart right here a"
"22139080","22147120"," lot of conversations don't feel natural either um and then another issue that i have is that a lot"
"22147120","22153440"," of the actors that are out there are either uh male female i don't care they're either classically"
"22153440","22163340"," trained and some prestigious schools or they're uh children of hollywood people"
"22163340","22172380"," so that thing right that people have like that thing that dustin hoffman has uh that thing that uh"
"22172380","22178920"," jammie lee kurtis has like there's something that people have um it's that magic that thing right"
"22178920","22187320"," like i don't know what it is that person has it a lot of that is going away you see"
"22187320","22194720"," it in uh music too uh today uh not not not always but oftentimes in music there has to be"
"22194720","22202020"," a look to a musician and if you look at uh musicians of of the past nobody cared what you"
"22202020","22218400"," look like cared about your ability so there's like a whole thing to it yeah"
"22218400","22225960"," same with sexy men and women um and sometimes sexy isn't like um like slowly went to the way where"
"22225960","22231140"," like oh that's guy's unique so he's kind of sexy even though he's kind of nerdy or something but"
"22231140","22236940"," now even that is kind of a cleaned up aesthetic like there's like the aesthetic is like the"
"22236940","22250000"," aesthetic is weird yeah i'm"
"22250000","22258320"," about to do the same thing fucking dude if you if you if you opened flies on friday when we"
