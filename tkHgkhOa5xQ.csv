"tkHgkhOa5xQ","10280","12320"," I don't know if it's a Amazon AWS right now is having issues someone didn't show up to work today are like fuck you it's father's day"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","12320","27600"," and"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","27600","32700"," so we're going to do this one part of the stream this one last bit of the stream here, we're going to us to try to stay away from having to"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","32700","34700"," have the end of the stream play out"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","34700","40700"," I want to still highlight two tickers here, I and TC"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","40700","46700"," you know you got to like if you're bearish out there if you're a seller out there"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","47700","53700"," yeah so this will be the last part of the stream right here, I'm not going to have winky and binky back on"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","53700","56700"," which sucks because it's binky stream"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","56700","60700"," but I don't know if it's a Amazon AWS"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","60700","62700"," I don't know if it's stream labs"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","62700","64700"," having guests on"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","64700","66700"," I know from my end"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","66700","69700"," everything is perfect as it should be"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","69700","71700"," so I'm not having any issues"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","71700","73700"," it's also on both Amazon"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","73700","76700"," excuse me it's both Twitch and YouTube going down"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","76700","80700"," it's kind of like a head scratcher for me so I'm going to assume it's Amazon AWS"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","80700","83700"," but I do want to review this quickly with for you okay"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","83700","86700"," just for structure maybe two more PayPal"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","86700","90700"," and then I want to look at Rocket Lab because of the structure here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","90700","95700"," I want to show you guys something you want to get bearish on"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","96700","98700"," I and TC"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","98700","101700"," you know you get all this consolidation going back September"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","101700","104700"," and there still hasn't been any payoff here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","104700","107700"," still if you think that's payoff that ain't nothing"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","107700","110700"," we've already been up here we've already been up here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","110700","114700"," I'm extremely bullish here this structure is not the bear structure"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","114700","118700"," okay this structure here is not the bear structure"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","118700","120700"," this is not the structure that you sell"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","120700","123700"," this is not none of this looks like that"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","123700","128700"," this looks to me very similar to a white-off structure"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","128700","131700"," which means we're going to go back and close all these gaps"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","131700","134700"," at least first"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","134700","138700"," if you want to begin to even think about selling"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","138700","141700"," I and TC sure you can sell this in here if you like"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","141700","146700"," if we get a break below 3511 you can sell this down to like 32 bucks 30 bucks"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","146700","149700"," but you really need"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","149700","155700"," two legs to this trade"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","155700","160700"," you need a break below 3511 to even get bearish"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","160700","164700"," right you get a couple rejections you take that trade down"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","164700","167700"," right and you get you exit the trade"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","167700","170700"," you then need to get underneath 3111"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","170700","174700"," and then you can get bearish to retest the lows down here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","174700","179700"," at 2462 and then you can get"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","179700","183700"," even more bearish to take it to zero I guess"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","183700","189700"," but right now man none of this stuff is looking the bearish that I think some of you think that it is"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","189700","191700"," I'm not seeing it right now"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","191700","195700"," I'm seeing a chance to buy a dip"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","195700","200700"," seeing this move right here seeing these candles up here this leg up right here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","200700","205700"," leads me to believe that we're going to come right in here to this 35 bucks"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","205700","209700"," and rip some faces off to the upside to 40 bucks"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","209700","212700"," I can be wrong here I would be"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","212700","214700"," I'm telling you what if you're a seller"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","214700","217700"," you need confirmation below"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","217700","222700"," right now the hourly trigger at $35 to begin to take this down"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","222700","227700"," and even if you do I'm expecting buyers to step right in over here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","227700","229700"," and try to grab it at like 32 bucks"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","229700","231700"," so INTC"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","231700","233700"," I don't see it"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","233700","237700"," I don't know why you would be buying INTC"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","237700","239700"," for since September"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","239700","240700"," for no payoff"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","240700","242700"," very unusual"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","242700","244700"," it would be a very unusual thing"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","244700","246700"," to see out there"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","248700","251700"," a lot of these tickers are like this"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","251700","254700"," a lot of these tickers"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","254700","256700"," so P.Y.P.L."
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","256700","258700"," PayPal"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","258700","260700"," 60 bucks down here right"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","260700","262700"," still consolidating down here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","262700","266700"," low low new low down at $60.03"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","266700","270700"," I am bullish on PayPal"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","270700","272700"," to $71.54"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","272700","276700"," so even for whatever bearishness that we have"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","276700","280700"," into this upcoming week this is a daily chart by the way it's going to a 30 minute chart"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","280700","286700"," if you want to see some coolness on PayPal here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","286700","289700"," PayPal with a dip by down below 60 bucks"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","289700","292700"," it has a 1, 2, 3, 4"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","292700","294700"," bullish"

"tkHgkhOa5xQ","299700","301700"," I don't know what's going on with PayPal"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","301700","303700"," whatever they're going to announce this week"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","303700","305700"," I'm assuming there's something here"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","305700","308700"," as long as price stays above $66"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","308700","312700"," price target above $71.40"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","312700","314700"," this is a weekly right here"

"tkHgkhOa5xQ","316700","318700"," $71.40 I'm going to draw this"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","318700","319700"," this is actually a good one"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","319700","321700"," probably the best ticker we've looked at yet so far"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","321700","324700"," right in here looking for something like that"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","324700","327700"," and then into early July"

"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1198700","1202700"," if price rejects the hourly"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1202700","1204700"," and starts to head down"

"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1218700","1220700"," on"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1220700","1222700"," the back end of this before it even happens"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1222700","1224700"," where velocity actually"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1224700","1228700"," begins to lower while price is going higher"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1228700","1230700"," so and look at that"
"tkHgkhOa5xQ","1230700","1232700"," price green yellow orange"
