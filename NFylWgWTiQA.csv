"45090","46650"," That does sound somewhat better."
"61330","62330"," Hey, come on out there. "
"62370","64110"," Can you guys hear me out there at all?"
"64890","67050"," Let me know if you can hear me on the screen."
"68130","70230"," Just say yes, we can hear you."

"102800","103880"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"104820","105840"," Go right into it real quick."
"110600","111620"," Just a second here."
"120520","125560"," So the good thing is that I'm working on getting some of this redone here. "
"126680","132240"," I updated my computer and so just an update here that I updated my computer."
"134600","137720"," And cues with the cues with the Tesla today."
"144620","149220"," And when I updated my computer, I fucked up my soundboard. "
"154300","155220"," It's right here."
"161700","165940"," And of course, Windows 11 is not the same as Windows 10."
"166780","168500"," It's a little bit more intuitive. "
"170400","171480"," Put that on there."
"173300","176020"," Of course, I shouldn't have updated until after the show."
"178600","180860"," But I did it yesterday before the show. "
"181300","182240"," And so that was an issue."
"182920","190440"," And now trying to reset some of this stuff because it's Windows 11, there's not much information"
"190440","196640"," available on the changes between Windows 10 and Windows 11 and that carry over."
"196640","199660"," So there's issues there as well, trying to get back the stream back up. "
"200380","205560"," But I think I sound, I was trying to do some snapping in the background."
"206560","208020"," I can't hear that anymore."
"208760","209700"," That kind of stuff. "
"210080","215620"," And my expanders and compressors and limiters and all that stuff is gone."
"215800","219280"," And then my AV cables, my virtual cables are still missing."
"219940","220500"," Well, they're there. "

"231580","233460"," Let's see here, save that."
"233460","237700"," I think I've got everything done."
"238980","247400"," I do want you to know that if you're watching on YouTube or Twitch, we had some issues with"
"249500","254620"," scammers, bots, all that kind of stuff, Russian, Russian websites, stuff like that. "

"507020","508960"," Just see where we're headed here. "
"514590","516970"," We could come down a little bit more."
"518190","519990"," Check the hourly and the daily Vellow."
"520429","522169"," So long in the tooth here in Vellow. "
"522270","525630"," You can kind of see we're topping process here in velocity."
"533170","535030"," Hourly is a little bit weak right here."
"535690","537150"," A little bit of cooling off period. "
"538090","539710"," We've got 448 14."
"540190","547810"," We had these chocked up yesterday, another one at 450.06. This is that yellow bar that we had on"
"547810","548950"," Webull yesterday."

"551130","554030"," Big yellow bar top of its Valhalla."
"556590","557310"," Up here."
"557650","560090"," Can we get higher here and grind through this stuff?"
"560310","561650"," This is kind of a big deal right here. "
"562190","564670"," You're going to find a lot of you're going to find a lot of supplier."
"566150","569770"," These numbers are going back way, way back in history."
"569910","570530"," We'll take a look at this. "
"571490","573750"," So you can see how far back it goes."
"575310","578090"," So taking a look at the fair and greed index 80."
"578750","579810"," These are important. "
"580110","581830"," I just want to show you this here."
"582370","584470"," 57 out of 100 signaling greed."
"585610","587830"," So now you can hear the new squacker. "
"587970","590350"," The only issue I'm having at this point this morning is with."
"592350","596410"," Let me see the chat box if I can mute that for a minute."
"597470","597910"," Perfect. "
"600550","603870"," So I'm going to issue with the suppressor of the sound when I'm speaking."
"604530","605450"," Turn that sound down."
"605670","606750"," But we'll get to that. "
"606930","607870"," So just right in here."
"608430","609430"," See we are right here."
"609690","610230"," I want to show you this. "
"610350","611250"," So this is a spy."
"611430","613270"," It doesn't matter if you do this on SPX or a spy."
"615610","617010"," This is where we're trading right here. "
"617110","617830"," This is way back."
"618130","619430"," Here's the top right here."
"620910","623070"," This is going back to April, May. "
"623870","625390"," This is kind of an important thing."
"627130","629090"," It's an important thing for you to understand."
"631090","633170"," When the market was rolling over. "
"634690","636270"," An important thing to understand."
"636550","637770"," So the market is rolling over."
"637990","639810"," I want you to see this important for you to see. "
"641550","643950"," So when the market is topping right."
"646070","647650"," Like a bull run is topping."
"648370","649750"," We have that initial break. "
"651070","655310"," You watch this yellow line come down and actually break below the orange line."
"655310","658010"," We actually get rid of some of this stuff here."
"658490","660490"," So you guys to see this. "
"661270","664050"," So remember these yellow lines right here."
"664150","664250"," Okay."
"664410","665330"," We're a cursor is right here. "
"666030","670750"," And the importance of these yellow lines because I guess I don't know if you can see this but this"
"670750","671930"," orange line right here."
"672450","673750"," To this yellow line."
"673890","676430"," This yellow price is staying above the yellow. "
"676850","680430"," The yellow comes down but does not break the orange line right here."
"681930","682890"," No break right."
"683150","684030"," No break right here. "
"684030","685010"," No break right here."
"689020","691440"," Key moments in the market though is right here."
"694540","695780"," The moment that you saw. "
"695860","698380"," Now we do get the EIA natural gas change forecast."
"698680","699740"," 50 B.C. This."
"703820","704800"," That's really odd. "
"706080","709820"," You can still hear that when my airpiece even if you can't hear it."
"710260","714760"," So a key point here though is this yellow line crossing the orange right here."
"714760","716500"," This is your first real true. "
"717340","718520"," Oh shit moment."
"719000","719800"," It's like right here."
"720900","724860"," So if you're along the market another market but the indices at least up to this point. "
"725480","726620"," You were fine right."
"727340","728220"," We had that."
"728620","730960"," You'll hear me on the show sometimes talk about the. "
"732140","735340"," Attempt to recover and with a failure."
"735760","737540"," I always say like it's like drowning a bull."
"738280","744680"," Like we roll over the bull has or the buyer has one or two more chances to recover. "
"744760","745280"," Right."
"746100","749060"," You can't really see this stuff on a regular chart but."
"750060","753640"," When you see that cross here of the triggers. "
"754720","757680"," That's already pointing to see the serious no cross here."
"758480","760300"," But there is a cross right here."
"761360","766640"," So this is the not just a warning but hey we're crossing to the downside and it's going to get"
"766640","767420"," ugly and bad. "
"768140","773460"," Even if you're in a five minute timeline if we were on a 15 minute timeline our timeline."
"773460","776700"," If you see this happening you know that it were done."
"777440","778080"," A friend. "
"779480","781340"," A bull trend is over."
"782280","786900"," And you only have one more chance to get out right so you can see it right here."
"787080","788320"," This is back in April May. "
"789520","793760"," Squeeze tired to grab some velocity for a major move down in the market."
"796080","797960"," So after all that drama."
"798840","802000"," If you still didn't unfuck yourself or pull yourself out of the market. "
"802640","803740"," You got trapped."
"804940","810180"," So just right up in here where we are trading right now this area right here."
"810640","814840"," It's a very emotional right you probably have people that have been trapped. "
"815820","819640"," People that held all through 2022."
"820280","824320"," Not many but you've got some people that along this market for a long period of time."
"824760","831180"," And right here where we are right now is going to be a very emotional place for trapped long term"
"831180","831540"," buyers. "
"832000","841900"," Maybe they went through 2022 and listened to people saying we're going to 1,600 1,600 2,600 3 "
"841900","848000",",200 2,800 3,500 and diamond handed through all that."
"848880","852520"," Some of them are like hey I'm tired I want off the carnival."
"853780","855220"," I want off the ride now. "
"855700","857420"," I know what happened last time we were here."
"857840","860080"," I want out believe it or not that sentiment."
"860880","863460"," Now can we go higher than this point here we can. "
"864420","865760"," We can't we need call expand."
"865960","867780"," We need people to believe that we're going higher from here."
"867920","871660"," But I just want you to know that just where we are right here and there are higher levels. "
"872900","876080"," Then when we are where we are right here right we've got another one above."
"879620","880180"," Excuse me."
"882660","885200"," Right here failure to break this peak. "
"885720","889100"," We got another one right up here that's for 60 43."
"890880","891960"," The one right there."
"893640","898000"," One more big push down of salaries right there that's for 55 16. "
"899160","901140"," Then we can start to look even higher here."
"902440","904980"," Right right there."
"904980","908240"," I'm going to failure to make a new high back here. "
"908780","911980"," So I mean there are some valid levels for us to trade up into."
"912940","917680"," But I want you to know that that's like historically that's what we're talking about here right now"
"917680","918680"," as we come up in here."
"919840","925660"," You're going to see supply right you're going to see it as we come up here. "
"927620","928740"," It's going to be."
"931040","932940"," It's going to be volatile."
"934480","938120"," As we come up here and you're going to see us push through these levels in. "
"939060","945680"," Futures and if we can't get it done in cash market going to see it in futures market okay."
"946340","950160"," So a little bit a little bit long in velocity the upside right now."
"951000","953000"," The hourly is catching up. "
"953160","956900"," It's currently sits at a 445 and 8445 and change."
"957880","963340"," So I mean look remembering this key point right here for continuation even higher."
"964280","968440"," Then then where we are 448 13 450 oh six. "
"968860","971480"," Next big jump is 455 16."
"972280","976160"," The next big jump above that is 460 and 462."
"976160","980080"," This is a major resistance area above here. "
"980500","987400"," We have a lot of space in here right big giant space in between 460 455 and a lot of"
"987400","988440"," space in between."
"991780","993840"," This next zone of all."
"994040","994120"," This next zone of all. "
"994120","994720"," This is all."
"994800","1000220"," We do get a natural gas change forecast 50 BCF on the prior of 72 BCF."
"1000340","1003460"," I'm going to go back to getting I got to get my rest of this audio done. "
"1004380","1007760"," So just in here you're going to expect some resistance here."
"1008340","1009380"," This is my point."
"1010480","1012000"," How do you break through this?"
"1013460","1014820"," Low volume environments. "
"1015500","1019340"," This is pre market after hours matter of fact in the close yesterday in stream."
"1019900","1026880"," We were still streaming at 401 ish and you could see the ramp take place at the belly yesterday."
"1027640","1031760"," The yagos kicked in and said we're going to buy all this and send it up in the overnight. "
"1032240","1035800"," We had a comment to Jedi Marcus yesterday on Twitter and I was like."
"1036260","1039060"," Did you see that shit at the bell and he was like fuck yeah I saw it."

"1060080","1065500"," Right are we ready for this we're going to wear out all of these capitulation sellers up here."
"1065500","1072580"," That kind of stuff now for right now you want to be relying upon the hourly trigger as your."
"1073300","1079520"," As your base of like you're like we'll come back to Jesus moment down here at 445 and some change. "
"1079760","1084300"," We have another place below that that's currently sitting at 436 28."
"1084880","1087360"," So we know where we can buy a dip."
"1087620","1089180"," That's a key point here. "
"1089180","1093620"," So for our rules what we use we know where we can buy a dip."
"1093840","1097940"," We know that right now it's sitting somewhere around 445 73."

"1131310","1131830"," 47. "
"1133890","1136570"," Right now 438."
"1137250","1143850"," It's funny too because Jedi also made a post where he said we could have so much fun if we"
"1143850","1145130"," had broken broken below."
"1145550","1147930"," And this is what he's talking about. "
"1151450","1154990"," Somewhere that way down here is the daily trigger."
"1156510","1158130"," Way down here so."
"1159010","1160310"," He was like we're gonna have lots of fun. "
"1160410","1165830"," We'll go straight to the depths of hell for a day or two flush it all and that's way down"
"1165830","1166110"," here."
"1167290","1169690"," So let me show you how deep that is."
"1172110","1175150"," I guess that was this is the daily trigger when it's moved up. "
"1176130","1177330"," So we'll get rid of that."
"1177610","1180810"," This was a previous by zone down below we went through that already."
"1184360","1186960"," But just right here you see how low. "
"1189020","1194100"," We can actually go and still the crazy part about this is we're still bullish."
"1196940","1201340"," We could break down all this and still be considered bullish."
"1202300","1203800"," We could actually go lower than that. "
"1203900","1207180"," We could go right now down to four eighteen seven."
"1207580","1209660"," What will roughly be four twenty."
"1210500","1211800"," And still be bullish. "
"1212740","1214340"," That's the expansion that we have."
"1214420","1215800"," We go all the way down to four twenty."
"1217300","1218860"," Way down here. "
"1220580","1223360"," And still be bullish this market."
"1223360","1226340"," That's how bullish this market is."
"1227360","1229320"," Any kind of correction to four twenty. "
"1229880","1235600"," So just right now keep keep keep your eyes on this four forty five four forty six area."
"1235740","1237920"," Swoman are running through the natural gas."
"1238340","1241940"," You know where our pivot is this keeps us bullish right on intraday moves. "
"1243160","1244880"," We've got a gap to fill down below."
"1245740","1251020"," And we talked earlier about these two levels right here are two and are three."
"1251020","1257100"," This is that those two yellow lines that I have up on the above. "
"1257360","1258680"," This is the area right here."
"1259440","1261700"," That was that I just showed you on that other chart."
"1262280","1268460"," This is that volatility going back to April, May of twenty twenty two. "
"1268720","1276660"," That last chance for buyers to cut themselves loose out of this market before rolled very important"
"1276660","1277520"," level up here."
"1277520","1282220"," So be aware of that be aware that you're going to get some selling into."
"1284400","1287320"," Where we are just the emotional sake of it. "
"1288380","1290200"," People will be trying to get out here."
"1290220","1294340"," We're trapped all year long and you're seeing this also play out."
"1296000","1297040"," Inside of. "
"1297580","1298100"," What."
"1298500","1298600"," Notice."
"1299920","1301100"," Cost of. "
"1301420","1302760"," And there's this yesterday."
"1303660","1304780"," On Twitter."
"1306120","1308540"," Everyone came out yesterday and said. "
"1309120","1312080"," We're going to run all these we're going to run all these squeeze plays."
"1312680","1314760"," Everybody's thrown out all the meme stocks."
"1315700","1316260"," From. "
"1318520","1319480"," Twenty twenty."
"1319920","1321080"," December twenty twenty."
"1321760","1324160"," Well, first they topped in December twenty twenty, but. "
"1325320","1328560"," Everyone's looking for these squeezes to go to the moon."
"1329160","1331280"," And this is where everyone was trapped."
"1331280","1334180"," This is like where all these buyers were trapped. "
"1334600","1335860"," Let's say let's say I was."
"1336040","1340980"," Let's say I was buying into stock XYZ at two hundred dollars."
"1341800","1342760"," And right. "
"1342960","1347040"," Some like let's just let's pretend we like bought a stock that was already up here at two hundred"
"1347040","1347740"," bucks right."
"1350160","1352860"," And it just blasted down to the depths of hell."
"1353680","1357460"," It's been slowly making its way up slowly making its way up right up here. "
"1357560","1358400"," It's been basing."
"1359340","1363440"," It's just about to start squeezing and closing all these gaps right."
"1364480","1366120"," And everyone can see it now. "
"1366300","1366900"," They couldn't see it."
"1366980","1370400"," I know for a fact on Twitter they couldn't see it in October."
"1370600","1371860"," They couldn't see it in December. "
"1372120","1374320"," They couldn't see it March and they couldn't see it May."
"1375140","1376300"," They couldn't see it in June."
"1377820","1379480"," And now all of a sudden they see it. "
"1380760","1384060"," And they're like, oh, dude, we're going to go up here and start ripping face up here."
"1384500","1384520"," Right."
"1384980","1386300"," Close all this stuff out. "
"1387140","1387920"," Very emotional."
"1388540","1393340"," There are these buyers up here that are still to this day along those tickers."
"1394040","1397120"," And they're just like chomping at the bit to get out. "
"1397960","1402220"," That same concept applies here to spy cues."
"1403280","1406160"," I don't even know right now is really explode right to the upside."
"1406360","1411000"," Go to start mooning and showing the way forward for the market. "
"1411000","1417860"," So just right in here, be aware of the importance of what this is, why it's so important in here,"
"1418540","1419140"," and where we are."
"1419300","1427220"," You can see how we're selling or buying and grinding into supply, supply, supply, supply, supply."
"1430060","1431920"," Not an easy level to get through here. "
"1432260","1433040"," Can we get through this?"
"1433400","1434800"," Yes, with call expansion."
"1435840","1437040"," Can we get through this?"
"1437260","1437580"," We can."
"1437580","1439060"," We can get through this. "
"1439480","1443700"," We can get if we get call expansion and they'll likely be a move up here."
"1445420","1445900"," Right."
"1445900","1449140"," If we get that call expansion and then you'll get trapped. "
"1450180","1451200"," Into next week."
"1451340","1453900"," And then we'll actually start to make our way to that."
"1454740","1462300"," For 60 area for 56 460 always other targets that we have the upside. "
"1462780","1465500"," So we need to we need the market to consolidate."
"1465500","1471040"," We need the market to get rid of all these sellers."
"1471880","1474400"," We also need to this call expansion. "
"1474960","1478380"," Get rid of all these sellers and they're not going to pay you as a call buyer."
"1479100","1482580"," Unless you're you're putting that risk either by calls like three times."
"1482860","1483340"," Does that make sense?"
"1483840","1485360"," I'm trying to dumb this down for you. "
"1486540","1488220"," Try to explain this to people."
"1488460","1493380"," So if you have a call while that's raised, the simple way to explain this would be."
"1493380","1497920"," I say we're going to 460. "
"1498760","1498880"," Right."
"1499780","1502380"," Well, I need to buy for 70s."
"1502580","1503400"," Does that make sense?"
"1504600","1506300"," I buy for 70s, right?"
"1506520","1507360"," And I tell you. "
"1508400","1511560"," Hey, look, I just bought 470 calls or I bought 460 calls."
"1512620","1513380"," Look at this."
"1513480","1514020"," I bought a bag. "
"1515060","1518420"," That we're going to 460 or 470, whatever, right?"
"1518600","1520060"," We're going to all time highs, right?"
"1520720","1521380"," This bag is empty."
"1522520","1527880"," A dealer is not going to fill this bag for me and take us there just because I bought all"
"1527880","1528360"," those calls."
"1529020","1531400"," Say I spent 50 million dollars. "
"1531820","1534360"," Going to 460 dealers are like sweet."
"1534760","1536000"," Anybody else think we're going to 460?"
"1536580","1537320"," Does that make sense?"
"1538640","1542000"," Anybody else think we're going to 470, 460, anything like that, right?"
"1543660","1550140"," And without other people believing that they're not going to send us there, right?"
"1550140","1554800"," They need like another guy to buy 50 million dollars in 460s, 470s, right?"
"1555080","1556340"," I need to create another bag holder."
"1556960","1561160"," I need to hold this bag and tell other people we're going there. "
"1561880","1564060"," There's a lot of room in this bag to be filled."
"1564460","1564980"," Does that make sense?"
"1566020","1571880"," So I find somebody else to buy 50 million dollars in those calls and my 470s that I bought for"
"1571880","1578240"," 10 cents, they're now worth 12 cents because this other guy spent 50 million dollars and he paid 12"
"1578240","1578600"," cents."
"1578600","1579620"," Does that make sense?"
"1580280","1582160"," Now I'm up two cents, right?"
"1582780","1584800"," So this bag now has two cents in it. "
"1585480","1589020"," This other guy bought the 460s, right?"
"1589720","1592320"," And he bought him and he's like, we have bought him for 12 cents."
"1592900","1594440"," I think they're going to 20 cents."
"1595360","1600280"," So now you and him go around and tell other people, hey man, we're going to 460, 470 brother. "
"1600660","1602020"," You should buy these calls too."
"1602700","1604700"," And the bid is now at 14 cents."
"1605560","1614720"," So that bag is being filled up slowly and slowly and slowly and slowly until you've got like 10 of"
"1614720","1616340"," us and we all own these bags. "
"1616800","1617900"," We got the bags, right?"
"1618560","1619300"," I'm in for 10."
"1619540","1620500"," That guy is in for 12."
"1620680","1621920"," That guy over there is in for 14. "
"1622520","1626220"," Follow it to another guy being in for, let's say 18 or 20 cents."
"1627440","1628540"," Now I'm up."
"1629580","1629860"," What?"
"1630040","1630380"," Eight cents?"
"1631120","1631760"," Doing pretty good here. "
"1632360","1633300"," Almost 100%, right?"
"1633860","1636180"," So I'm like, ooh, 18 cents, 20 cents."
"1636240","1637160"," I might get out now."
"1637660","1641880"," So now all of these people have to get even more people in above me. "
"1642180","1650800"," And until the last person until people start to look at that bag and say, you know, that bag's now"
"1650800","1651540"," pretty heavy."
"1652780","1653640"," Is that really?"
"1654020","1655700"," Am I really going to make anything off of this?"
"1655820","1658360"," Is that bag that the bag's now 25 cents?"
"1658980","1659700"," Is it going to 50?"
"1661000","1662560"," And so there's the bag holder."
"1662560","1665320"," That's the last guy in the last group of people. "
"1665860","1668480"," And we start to see the price head down, right?"
"1668720","1669300"," Not enough fires."
"1669660","1670560"," They're not compounding."
"1671840","1673740"," And I got scared at this point. "
"1673840","1674560"," I'm like, oh shit."
"1674960","1676440"," It was at 25 cents."
"1676600","1678360"," And now it's rolling over a little bit. "
"1678900","1681740"," I don't believe we were actually going to four or six."
"1681920","1684220"," They were getting close for 58 or 56."
"1685520","1686420"," One moment here. "
"1691500","1692900"," Something like that, right?"
"1693720","1701180"," And now if no buyers step in originally, let's say, let's say I'm the first guy again, right?"
"1701320","1704120"," And the first guy to buy those calls."
"1705340","1706880"," So I buy those calls, right?"
"1707040","1709600"," We're going to 460 baby by a bunch of calls."
"1709740","1711300"," Guess what the dealers automatically do?"
"1712660","1713700"," They counter my trade. "
"1713700","1717680"," They start to send us lower until more P."
"1717800","1723820"," I can convince more people to make more buyers of those 460s, 470s."
"1724280","1725480"," I now find two buyers."
"1725800","1727300"," We push up even higher, right?"
"1727860","1733420"," Start climbing back down until we can convince some more buyers to buy more, right?"
"1733620","1734280"," To push us up. "
"1734840","1738120"," So you'll see that delta neutral trade from dealers."
"1738480","1740840"," Now, sometimes dealers get overrun."
"1740840","1747360"," If too many people make that mad rush, dealers will chase, right?"
"1747620","1751620"," And they will actually go with you on the trade rather than countering your trade. "
"1753520","1755520"," There are other effects as well."
"1755780","1758740"," You have large banks and funds that are upset."
"1758980","1759420"," They were short. "
"1760160","1761520"," Now they have to buy the market."
"1761720","1764500"," So now you've got hedge funds chasing, dealers chasing."
"1765200","1768700"," And that's how you get these effects where we push up, right?"
"1768700","1774860"," So if you're mad rush to the 460 or 470, we can actually not even pull back that much and"
"1774860","1779540"," just start squeezing and squeezing and squeezing higher until we get close to that number. "
"1779980","1787140"," So when I say quip topping, all that kind of stuff, you can't have the market believer only going"
"1787140","1787600"," to 460."
"1788580","1790380"," Trading 450 right now, right?"
"1790560","1796200"," We need people to believe that we're going to 470, 480, or we will have a failure."
"1796200","1803040"," They need to think that we're going to 5000, that we're going to 550 by December, right?"
"1803260","1805800"," That we're going to 6000 by next year. "
"1806480","1811500"," The higher you make people believe we're going, even if we're not going there, the more call"
"1811500","1816240"," expansion that you have thinking that we're going there, the easier it is for us to actually get up"
"1816240","1816480"," here."
"1816880","1817440"," Does that make sense?"
"1817780","1824420"," You need to have these buyers and these believers in this general sentiment that we're going there"
"1824420","1826780"," for us to actually continue to go there."
"1826940","1828040"," Otherwise, we're going to grind up. "
"1828380","1833340"," We will come into a place the market will drop, will grind up slowly unless we have that mass"
"1833340","1835760"," movement or mass buying into this market."
"1836300","1840300"," There's another part of this tour banks enter the market late and they just push it all up with"
"1840300","1840640"," volume."
"1841340","1847380"," Don't be aware of that as this topping process happens because let me ask you honestly, let me ask"
"1847380","1848020"," you an honest question. "
"1849120","1852880"," This is an important insight for you when you're gauging sentiment."
"1854440","1861980"," It's an important insight for you because there's a part of digestion and there's a part of how"
"1861980","1863720"," high do you think we're going?"
"1864520","1873900"," It's good to see people looking at all this meme stonks and all these spectro stonks that they can"
"1873900","1874480"," start squeezing."
"1874820","1878300"," That helps believe it or not with pushing us up and over. "
"1878300","1881960"," It's like a backdoor way for us to actually get up there."
"1882100","1882760"," How do we get there?"
"1883260","1889560"," How do you make people believe that we can go to 460 or 7480 or 5000, right?"
"1890280","1893020"," Even if we don't get to that full peak."
"1893360","1899440"," As a matter of fact, Tom Lee, I think was given some targets to the upside and he mentioned, I"
"1899440","1906000"," believe he's thinking this year, I believe he's thinking 480 end of year, but he's out there saying"
"1906000","1906880"," 5000, 6000. "
"1908660","1914560"," You need to give more than you're actually going to get."
"1916240","1921820"," That's an important function of our market and it's really fascinating to watch how a lot of the"
"1921820","1926480"," underlying stuff, if you're like, well, I don't believe we're going that high."
"1927060","1930360"," I thought you were looking at a squeezable stock. "
"1930360","1932900"," Well, this thing over here can go."
"1933160","1935080"," This thing's been beaten down for like three years."
"1935360","1937380"," This thing can go up there and close all those gaps. "
"1938080","1939300"," It's trading 10 bucks."
"1939480","1940860"," It can go to like 90 in like a month."
"1941480","1947900"," As long as you're believing that you can drive the S&P 500, the queues up to those all time"
"1947900","1952940"," highs by believing that looking at something more tangible or grounded in your viewpoint. "
"1954720","1956440"," That's how you drive up this market."
"1956440","1962260"," It's something that the sentiment driven market can digest."
"1963060","1969240"," You might not be able to digest 460 or 470 or 480, but I'm sure you can digest a squeeze"
"1969240","1972860"," in your favorite spec growth digger that got torched, right?"
"1973620","1974160"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1974660","1981100"," So you can have this underlying mass movement to the upside from participation of the greater"
"1981100","1982020"," market at large. "
"1982020","1988160"," You also hear the discussion that whether this is true or not, we're just at the start of AI"
"1988160","1989100"," revolution, right?"
"1989520","1995160"," We're just the start of NVDA going up and Apple going up and Microsoft going up."
"1995380","1997700"," All these AI comes just the start of this, right?"
"1997840","1999220"," We also got earnings coming up."
"1999740","2003760"," We also have, we already know what the PE ratios are, right?"
"2004000","2005640"," We talked about that last year, right?"
"2006080","2010080"," We need more high multiples of PE ratios if inflation goes down, right?"
"2010080","2014100"," So as long as you start to believe this stuff, we can actually go there. "
"2014560","2018440"," So if you don't think we can go there, I'm warning you that we fucking can go there."
"2019100","2027520"," Even if you don't believe that spoons can go there, there are other factors playing into sending us"
"2027520","2027820"," there."
"2028240","2032740"," There are other things that you likely can believe that can send us there. "
"2033480","2040280"," Just the thought, just the candy at the end of the stick saying, oh yeah, maybe we will get great"
"2040280","2041500"," cuts or rate pausing."
"2041840","2046500"," Maybe they're just threatening us and we'll hold them here for the next six months."
"2046780","2050760"," Maybe we got two more rate increases with the tail end of it, then they pause, right?"
"2051020","2052300"," It's that tease, that carrot. "
"2052800","2058320"," Well, I know for sure that if we ever cut rates, the market should go down, but that's probably"
"2058320","2058580"," what?"
"2058580","2060260"," Six months, nine months down the road."
"2060380","2062199"," It's like a little carrot being held to you."
"2062739","2063460"," Does it make sense?"
"2063900","2065360"," It doesn't matter if it's real or not. "
"2065520","2069040"," It matters that you're like, yeah, we're at the end of rate increases."
"2070000","2073659"," We're probably going to have some pausing in there, and then we know they're going to start"
"2073659","2073980"," cutting."
"2074159","2074760"," But when is that?"
"2075020","2076179"," Is it this month?"
"2076620","2077060"," Probably not. "
"2077679","2078560"," Is it this quarter?"
"2078739","2079139"," Probably not."
"2079560","2080820"," Is it two four?"
"2081360","2081980"," Probably not."
"2082540","2088560"," Probably don't even get rate cuts until, what was that?"
"2089600","2092219"," How much time does that give us to keep going higher?"
"2093020","2096040"," Q3, Q4, Q1, Q2, even if we have a correction. "
"2097440","2106120"," So all these things are being given to you to ultimately lead this market to much higher high."
"2106540","2108840"," I want to bring this to you or something to your attention."
"2109800","2111400"," So this is a fascinating thing. "
"2112400","2114280"," I've shown this multiple times."
"2114280","2118580"," I posted it on Twitter a long time ago, and nobody wanted to fucking believe me."
"2119900","2125980"," I actually got a shit ton of likes on this one quietly. "
"2128580","2132340"," We're going to bring up a couple key points here."
"2132760","2140160"," So this is, I think it was, I forget who it was that came on CNBC."
"2142940","2144740"," I forget who it was that came on CNBC. "
"2146560","2156680"," Now this is the SP500, the SP500 PE ratio, profits and earnings estimates, right?"
"2157540","2163800"," And there was some asshole, some asshole, some old asshole from, I don't know if it was drug, I"
"2163800","2165380"," don't know if it was drug, I forget his name."
"2166740","2170360"," But they were long bonds, and they wanted to get paid for long bonds."
"2170620","2177240"," They were begging on CNBC, all these old guys, and all these fucking old guys were like, their"
"2177240","2183480"," mantra, their mantra was the stock market's out of control. "
"2184540","2185960"," And it's outrageous."
"2186620","2192480"," And I was like, all these fucking guys were like 40 years old back in the 1970s."
"2192480","2193740"," Way back here. "
"2194640","2198760"," It's 1978, 1979, something changed, right?"
"2199440","2203980"," And all the bullshit they tell you, all the bullshit they tell you is a fucking lie."
"2205420","2209740"," You have people saying like, we're not the whores, right?"
"2209920","2211040"," But they are the whores."
"2211860","2213240"," These are the whores. "
"2213960","2214940"," They're not you and I."
"2215320","2219100"," They've been here since the 70s, late 70s and 80s, tax codes changed."
"2220020","2225200"," Reagan did a bunch of shit, but you saw them buying these PE ratios, like clockwork."
"2225600","2230000"," There's like a guy here, a woman here, and she's like, we're buying here or buying here. "
"2230100","2230400"," We don't care."
"2230520","2231760"," We don't care what we're telling them."
"2232220","2233860"," We're going to still sell doom. "
"2233940","2236940"," And then we're going to push the end, the end of it to them, right?"
"2237060","2237800"," We're going to buy this."
"2238580","2241580"," Like clockwork, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
"2241580","2245360"," And look where we were right here. "
"2248160","2249240"," Wednesday, the 1st."
"2249800","2252020"," Of June, 2022."
"2253260","2255360"," I tried to explain to people. "
"2256580","2257900"," Back in May and June."
"2258160","2260860"," Matter of fact, James Rowan and I are old friends."
"2260860","2263640"," And I said to Rowan, I was like, we're not crashing here. "
"2264520","2265720"," And he's like, he's short."
"2265880","2266720"," I'm like telling you, we're not."
"2266940","2267780"," This is the bottom. "
"2268020","2269220"," This is in May and June."
"2270420","2272380"," And then we had a second bounce in October."
"2272380","2275020"," More bottoming. "
"2275660","2276840"," And you know what they were doing?"
"2276840","2279020"," These fucking banks, not banks, but speculators."
"2279520","2280820"," Now you and I speculators."
"2281460","2286760"," These are, these are people that work for a prime bank and they're going to start their own thing,"
"2287320","2287500"," right?"
"2287620","2289680"," And they're well respected and they have cocktail parties. "
"2289940","2293200"," They start cocaine and they're fucking each other's lives."
"2294500","2299320"," They're banging yelling and putting a ball mask on with Jerome and all that."
"2299540","2301020"," They're down here buying this shit. "
"2301740","2303340"," They were buying this shit."
"2304940","2306280"," Way back here."
"2307180","2308340"," Look at it right here. "
"2308740","2309380"," This is June."
"2309800","2311020"," They're buying it right here."
"2311540","2312580"," And they're buying it again. "
"2312900","2314220"," They're September 1st."
"2314560","2318700"," And they're just buying it, buying it, buying it."
"2319740","2321860"," They're telling you PE ratios. "
"2322200","2322840"," We're not going to buy this."
"2323020","2328240"," They're telling you that I heard all this bullshit on Fintuit where they were like, oh, yeah."
"2328920","2332420"," We need a PE ratio of 12 and a Ford PE ratio of this. "
"2332560","2333920"," And I'm like, wasn't S&P at some point?"
"2334080","2338180"," Like, for like these, these long wicks were like 14 or 12."
"2338220","2341860"," Anyways, for a brief moment they were, they're not showing on this chart, but they were."
"2342280","2347580"," There's like a quick little wick down here where we had PE ratios this past year in 2022. "
"2348100","2350180"," Roughly, I think the low was like 12 or 14."
"2351020","2354380"," But anyways, hand grades and horseshoes."
"2354520","2356320"," These guys were down here buying this shit. "
"2356320","2358000"," You see what I'm saying?"
"2358240","2363800"," No matter what they're telling you, these guys, these old fucking fat guys are buying this trend"
"2363800","2367380"," all the way back, all the way back."
"2367740","2372020"," I drink your milkshake since 1978."
"2372540","2374220"," I drink your milkshake. "
"2374820","2381140"," So when you hear these guys out there talking shit, these very wealthy individuals, they fucking"
"2381140","2383140"," were scooping this shit up down here."
"2383860","2384640"," You get what I'm saying?"
"2384640","2387320"," Well, they fed you doom and gloom."
"2388600","2391800"," You got your Mike Wilson's out there feeding you doom and gloom. "
"2392760","2393320"," Liar."
"2394300","2395940"," They were accumulating it."
"2397160","2398700"," That's what they were fucking doing. "
"2399140","2400360"," They were buying it in May and June."
"2400980","2401980"," They were buying it in October."
"2404620","2405180"," Liars. "
"2406340","2410000"," Then they told their own people in December and January to buy."
"2411680","2413820"," Now you're starting to catch on."
"2415100","2418420"," Now I'm more eating fintuit and people are like fuck yeah, this is going to happen. "
"2418440","2419020"," We're going to do that."
"2419140","2419680"," We're going to do this."
"2420120","2420780"," We're going to start squeezing. "
"2421080","2421760"," We get craziness."
"2422920","2423720"," All that kind of stuff."
"2426240","2427920"," See that beautifulness right there?"
"2430120","2432940"," And these guys were on CNBC, dude. "
"2434120","2438920"," They were on CNBC telling you otherwise."
"2441560","2443280"," That's not you and I down here."
"2443980","2446340"," This is not you the retail trader. "
"2447000","2448480"," These are market makers."
"2449340","2451340"," And they're laying the groundwork down here."
"2453440","2455580"," You could have seen the bottom yourself. "
"2465360","2467720"," Way back in June, you could have seen it."
"2468380","2469000"," May, June."
"2475550","2477050"," So that's what they were doing. "
"2477830","2478970"," They lie to you."
"2479730","2481290"," Then it gets regurgitated."
"2482330","2484230"," Then you find out, then you lift up the skirt. "
"2487130","2492370"," And then you realize that some of the people you trust out there have no fucking idea what they're"
"2492370","2493130"," talking about."
"2493670","2498950"," People with 200,000 followers, a million followers, half million followers."
"2499650","2504170"," They have no, not all of them, but a lot of them have no fucking idea what they're talking about. "
"2505350","2507890"," Well, when it comes to the stock market, they don't."
"2508590","2510450"," Or their information is limited."
"2511370","2515410"," Or they trust this person that they're listening to talk to them on CNBC. "
"2516490","2523590"," When in reality, there's an underside, an underbelly, a gutter, a back alleyway of greed."
"2526690","2528590"," And there are ways for you to see it."
"2530990","2539170"," There are ways for you as a retailer, like literally turn off social media, turn off CNBC, and"
"2539170","2541130"," watch this stuff on your own. "
"2542310","2549590"," And if you can grasp just basic concepts like this, you start to look at these people and question"
"2549590","2550170"," them."
"2551010","2555210"," You start to go, these fucking people are out of their fucking minds or they're lying to me."
"2555650","2558910"," And then the people below them, you go, these are one of the, these guys are lying too. "
"2559190","2562970"," Or they're buying it and just not telling us so they can push it on us later down the road."
"2571470","2572650"," So, it's too funny."
"2575230","2576070"," It's too funny. "
"2576210","2578010"," And we've looked at this on our show in the past."
"2578290","2579530"," You guys have seen me go on rants."
"2580070","2585750"," You guys have been here with me when we were in October, in June and May, going on rants about"
"2585750","2586270"," this stuff. "
"2586810","2589890"," You saw me go through and say, you DCA all of this stuff, right?"
"2590130","2591610"," You DCA here, you DCA here."
"2591910","2596210"," Even if you wind up, you remember the conversations that we had in even October."
"2597950","2602170"," Where I said you do one, two, and three DCAs, you leave 10% off the table. "
"2602990","2607790"," And even if we go down to 2,800 or 3,200, you're still up on the market."
"2608670","2610690"," You didn't miss the run."
"2613350","2615190"," You didn't miss the bottom. "
"2617490","2621850"," Even if we go back down to 2,800 for another dip buy or 3,200."
"2622370","2627250"," If we had a crash, you'd still see it to get out of the market."
"2629610","2631330"," And you wouldn't have left it behind. "
"2632070","2637310"," And I'll tell you what, you look back in the history of the stock market, we don't ever come back"
"2637310","2638310"," to those lows again."
"2639710","2643970"," We already looked at it last week on Monday at a rant on Monday of last week or this past"
"2643970","2645710"," week or Friday or Thursday or something."
"2646470","2652710"," I was like, look, even if I can show you where the time that they're buying in the marketplace,"
"2652710","2656670"," even when we do roll, you'll look back in three to five years. "
"2656830","2658210"," How many times have I said that to you?"
"2658290","2661710"," You look back in three to five years and say, that was a Bible dip."
"2662790","2665590"," We likely don't even see that low ever again."
"2665590","2666810"," You should have bought it anyways. "
"2671280","2673520"," And that's what you're seeing happening right now."
"2674560","2676880"," When I showed you that, that those earnings."
"2678500","2680940"," If we go back to a sense of normalcy. "
"2681960","2688180"," If this is a soft landing, even if you don't believe it, it will demand higher."
"2689000","2693660"," We're at 25.78. They're going to start calling for 30."
"2696420","2696980"," 30. "
"2704440","2707120"," And if you're new to this program, right?"
"2707820","2713760"," There are a lot of people on this program that have been here since day one, day fucking one."
"2714480","2717920"," And they're going to test all of this going all the way back to the beginning."
"2719860","2724940"," So it's important for you to look or be able to identify those things in the market, regardless of"
"2724940","2725260"," price. "
"2726280","2729360"," Mike Barry, I got to give it to him."
"2730440","2735840"," I got to give it to Mike Barry because he even said it to you as a retailer."
"2736680","2738000"," He said, congratulations. "
"2738960","2742660"," You bought the dip more than ever in history."
"2743100","2744280"," He gave it to you."
"2745080","2749680"," He literally told you he was looking for this. "
"2749920","2750740"," He was looking for."
"2752920","2758180"," He was looking for this bounce down here in the fall."
"2758940","2760040"," He didn't see that. "
"2760380","2761560"," He saw it going up."
"2762860","2765280"," He said, he said, son of a bitch, they bought it."
"2766340","2768740"," We didn't get the fraud crash. "
"2769740","2771160"," The fraud continues."
"2771680","2773680"," We're probably not going that high, maybe there."
"2774460","2775840"," I don't think we go this high. "
"2779260","2780440"," But you know what I'm saying?"
"2780600","2781420"," You get my point here."
"2783640","2785320"," Do you remember that tweet that he made?"
"2786400","2786880"," Congratulations."
"2787120","2787700"," You bought it. "
"2787940","2794400"," He actually tipped you off like a friend to retail."
"2794900","2796540"," He wasn't lying when he said that."
"2796740","2797600"," He saw it. "
"2800730","2803390"," It's what else is fascinating too is on that trend."
"2804430","2808470"," Going back to 2008, it was the same trend that they bought that bottom."
"2808750","2809790"," Same fucking bottom. "
"2812510","2816130"," On PE ratios on that trend going up, it was the same place."
"2816550","2817210"," Same trend line."
"2817430","2818030"," Boom, they bought it. "
"2818710","2820330"," That was the bottom of 2008."
"2832700","2834900"," Do stocks ever actually go down?"
"2835060","2835700"," Yes, they do."
"2836300","2837280"," That's a good question. "
"2837520","2838220"," Who just asked that?"
"2838380","2840200"," Brian Baldo just asked that question."
"2840440","2842320"," Let's talk about do stocks ever go down?"
"2843660","2844160"," Yes."
"2844980","2852900"," If you're a long time market participant, the market is littered with..."
"2852900","2855740"," So there's two things to know here. "
"2856740","2857140"," One."
"2859740","2863420"," Sellers never want to tell you about stock."
"2863420","2865520"," Well, we're not going to get into buybacks. "
"2867360","2870500"," Sellers never want to say to you something like, oh yeah, we're not going to tell them about stock"
"2870500","2871320"," splits, right?"
"2871540","2873760"," If you look at Apple, how many times it's split?"
"2874180","2878760"," If you had just bought it, what are the original shares now worth today?"
"2879800","2881580"," That's where you get your max value."
"2882080","2888120"," If you can pick the right companies, you think have a life of 20, 30, 40, 50 years."
"2888860","2889300"," They're useful. "
"2890600","2891560"," Mark my words, right?"
"2891560","2892720"," They're useful."
"2894700","2895600"," They're enjoyable."
"2898180","2901020"," And they're useful and enjoyable and easy to use, right?"
"2901280","2903380"," I mean useful, like they have to have it. "
"2903560","2903940"," Like an iPhone."
"2904920","2906760"," I have to have an iPhone, right?"
"2907680","2914200"," When you see that in the company, those companies have low price stocks, right?"
"2914400","2916320"," You buy those and hold them for multiple years."
"2917060","2922440"," But the stock market is also filled with companies that don't do that. "
"2923360","2927740"," And they're literally across the landscape and no, they don't ever come back."
"2928640","2932380"," A prime example of this is, give me a great, great example."
"2933440","2934640"," So hold me, remember this. "
"2934960","2936060"," What's this fucking stock?"
"2939480","2940880"," Hold on here."
"2946870","2948430"," Great one for you."
"2956420","2961100"," Not acts on digital alley. "
"2961860","2962620"," Digital alley."
"2963220","2965680"," Let me see what's this ticker name."
"2966220","2966840"," Digital alley. "
"2967100","2967500"," Give me a fun one."
"2967740","2968480"," DGLY."
"2969500","2970600"," Let's leave them. "
"2971060","2971800"," DGLY."
"2973680","2975180"," They're a fascinating one."
"2975180","2976220"," They're a good one to look at. "
"2980320","2981860"," Let me do masks."
"2984520","2985460"," You want to see a cool one?"
"2986000","2986720"," Never come back?"
"2988220","2990140"," I got a great example for you."
"2997240","2997640"," DGLY. "
"2998740","3000400"," You want to see a fascinating ticker?"
"3000500","3001040"," They never came back?"
"3001280","3001660"," This one is."
"3002760","3005480"," This ticker was a media darling."
"3006960","3014020"," You can find, you can find articles about DGLY in the Wall Street Journal in the New York Times. "
"3014880","3017060"," They had their moments in the sun, right?"
"3017940","3019780"," Never ever recovered again."
"3020760","3021200"," See that?"
"3021480","3023660"," Never ever truly recovered again."
"3023660","3031220"," I had a big old squeeze back here in 2020 on the rip for possible, you know, we're going to"
"3031220","3033700"," have like tire burning in the streets during COVID and all that kind of stuff. "
"3033880","3036620"," But other than that, this stock never came back."
"3036780","3036940"," Did it?"
"3037740","3043660"," And the landscape of our stock market of those 15,000 tickers, whole bunch of them are like this"
"3043660","3044940"," and eventually they get delisted."
"3046300","3049980"," So you still have to be tactful when you are buying these bottoms. "
"3050580","3052600"," You have to be like, hey, what am I going to buy down there?"
"3052600","3056880"," Am I either going to buy an index or I'm going to buy a ticker that I think is going"
"3056880","3060800"," to weather this storm and still be useful?"
"3061520","3063200"," Is DGLY useful?"
"3063820","3064180"," Probably not."
"3065200","3069220"," It'll be a darling for a short period and then fade off."
"3070360","3076280"," This company likely sits inside of a strip mall now with like the original owner and maybe one or"
"3076280","3079200"," two engineers and they're making just enough money. "
"3079380","3080600"," They're still publicly listed."
"3081800","3083140"," And they're just a small company."
"3083440","3084100"," They never made it. "
"3085180","3087820"," Was DGLY ever going to be an apple?"
"3088140","3088600"," Fuck no."
"3089600","3092040"," You know, they have their, they serve their purpose, right?"
"3093020","3095160"," So that's a prime example for you."
"3095220","3096500"," So do stocks ever go down?"
"3096740","3097340"," Yes, they do. "
"3097500","3103280"," And if you're a longtime investor, you know that some stocks never come back."
"3103760","3108260"," They might squeeze, but they never, ever, ever come back."
"3108260","3113760"," I said of higher lows, price trading above the yellow and the white right now on spy. "
"3114040","3115140"," We're getting bullshare for squeeze."
"3118240","3121200"," Trying to grind up into this topping up here."
"3121680","3124400"," R2 and R3 zone above here. "
"3132930","3134190"," Hey, SCT Voyager."
"3134530","3134790"," How are you?"
"3134890","3135190"," Good morning."
"3140230","3144570"," So yeah, DGLY was a, was a pump and dump scam in 2020. "
"3145150","3146490"," It was one of the pump and dump scams."
"3148510","3153260"," I remember the first weed pump and dump."
"3153460","3154260"," That was a big one, right?"
"3155260","3158600"," Trying to break through supply right now, trying to get a nice fat squeeze to get up here. "
"3160720","3162740"," This was yesterday's STX cell."
"3162880","3164320"," Today is STX cells up here."
"3165820","3166640"," It's even higher. "
"3167500","3174800"," It's up here at, let me go take a look and see where the next STX is."
"3179120","3180140"," Hold on here."
"3181780","3182320"," 455. "
"3186380","3190680"," Oh, well, I'll pick that as we're not getting up there today."
"3193420","3195020"," No way we're getting up there."
"3195900","3196700"," Not today. "
"3198120","3199600"," That's way up there now."
"3200300","3201460"," There's your new burn Valhalla."
"3202400","3204980"," That's what this one's way up here. "
"3208000","3210320"," Your burn Valhalla has now moved higher."
"3211100","3211660"," 450."
"3211980","3212540"," 450. "
"3213140","3213700"," 516."
"3214460","3215440"," Not that high."
"3219180","3220300"," Right here. "
"3220980","3226180"," Oh, look at that up there, baby."
"3231140","3232300"," That's your big boy."
"3232600","3233780"," I don't think we get that right now. "
"3233780","3243060"," This little red tag right here is what I'm looking at, this 450.04. But there's too many names to"
"3243060","3243460"," name, right?"
"3243640","3248120"," So when we're down here in these bottoms, you have to be tactful."
"3248720","3253560"," If you're going to be a market participant and you're not giving your money to a financial advisor,"
"3254100","3259440"," if you're not doing that, you are now taking on the responsibility of financial risk, right?"
"3259440","3265700"," You're saying my financial advisor is not putting the risk on the places that I want him to."
"3266100","3268060"," So where am I going to put that risk?"
"3269580","3271160"," Where is that risk going?"
"3271540","3276800"," So then you have to educate yourself, even if you go back and speak to a financial advisor's, hey,"
"3276880","3279460"," look man, I think Apple has a future. "
"3279740","3281420"," I think NVDA has a future."
"3281860","3287600"," Whatever it is that you think on those major bottoms, you have to do that on your own due"
"3287600","3288440"," diligence, right?"
"3288440","3289380"," You have to do your own education."
"3289940","3295940"," Would I buy a ticker like, if we were in October and June and May, would I be buying a"
"3295940","3298960"," Peloton?"
"3300960","3302580"," Fuck no, I wouldn't be buying Peloton. "
"3303460","3305140"," I just showed you DGLY, right?"
"3306000","3307580"," Where do I think Peloton's going to be?"
"3308300","3310300"," Probably the same place as DGLY."
"3310520","3315760"," At some point down the road, decades away from now, they're likely going to be a small company that"
"3315760","3323520"," you see sold in Walmart on QVC, mail order, something."
"3323980","3325060"," I mean, the brand is still good. "
"3325680","3326820"," They didn't make a bike or anything."
"3327200","3329160"," They didn't reinvest their money into anything awesome."
"3329420","3335900"," They're likely going to fall into that category of some day down the road, trading down at $2 to $2"
"3335900","3338160"," and they're going to get a warning. "
"3338660","3340140"," They're going to make it back up to $3."
"3340140","3345360"," I'll have a spike up to $20, come back down into that $2 range again as time passes."
"3346100","3348120"," Likely, not guaranteed, but likely. "
"3349300","3354080"," Apple, on the other hand, if I compare Peloton and Apple, who am I going with?"
"3355060","3360900"," If I look at a semiconductor and I look at Peloton, who am I going with and we're down in"
"3360900","3361540"," those dumpsters?"
"3368920","3370140"," Among calls here."
"3370960","3371920"," I'm in calls right now."
"3371920","3381390"," I mean, calls right now, I've got a puts for Friday that were $0.10 yesterday. "
"3381990","3387030"," I've got monthly puts that are for August 10th and I'm on zero date calls right now."
"3389560","3390580"," Dude, weed stocks."
"3390900","3396760"," Remember, was it like 2018, 2017, weed stock pump was amazing. "
"3397600","3399500"," Remember the Canadian weed stock pump?"
"3403780","3405880"," We're going to talk about earnings today as well, too."
"3405880","3407920"," I have pushed that off two or three times."
"3407920","3409380"," We have to talk about earnings at some point. "
"3411700","3413360"," We have to talk about earnings."
"3413860","3416320"," I keep pushing it off and pushing it off the earnings ramp."
"3417940","3419520"," Q3 expectation ramp. "
"3420120","3425340"," We had a great Q2 and they're going to ramp us into those earnings guaranteed."
"3427520","3431240"," We're not guaranteed, but historically, that's what happens."
"3432140","3435340"," We have inflation coming down and there's another part to this too. "
"3435440","3436820"," We talked about this earlier this week."
"3438040","3446800"," Remember earlier this week when I talked to you about PPI and CPI and how you have this window"
"3446800","3456360"," where PPI comes down and some companies are still squeezing out profit."
"3457320","3457820"," I'm right. "
"3457940","3461860"," I talked about dollar eggs yesterday and I was like, yeah, some companies are still charging $6,"
"3462060","3462200"," $7."
"3462840","3465160"," They're making like bang and profit."
"3467280","3471620"," And not all these companies have come down in their egg prices, but this week I finally saw eggs"
"3471620","3473820"," come down somewhere and I'm like, yeah, that's probably going to go down. "
"3475400","3479540"," You're going to see other companies start to drop the price of their eggs."
"3482280","3490480"," Next month or two, three months, you're going to see some competition for inflation to continue to"
"3490480","3490780"," drop."
"3493300","3498820"," So if you see that happening right now, their earnings should be outstanding, right?"
"3499460","3506900"," Because the companies earning this earnings season, you're likely going to see PPI coming down and"
"3506900","3509280"," yet pricing still still higher. "
"3509780","3517540"," Another Goldilocks zone specifically for these companies that are coming into their Q3 earnings and"
"3517540","3520820"," it'll likely last even possibly into their Q4 earnings."
"3522240","3528660"," I'm going to expect in this season the guidances for a lot of these companies was like a couple of"
"3528660","3528940"," things."
"3529680","3534940"," Their earnings reports are going to say, oh, yeah, by the way, our costs have gone down. "
"3534940","3540920"," And we're still charging all this high pricing for goods."
"3541400","3542880"," No one's dropped their pricing."
"3542880","3544560"," So we're making bank right now. "
"3544760","3547140"," That's what my expectation is for this earnings season."
"3547660","3554200"," You should have some kind of, if you have like a stabilization, some kind of, not quite blowout,"
"3554380","3560940"," but better than expected in Q3 because their cost of doing some of this stuff has come down."
"3560940","3563940"," Now the cost of the wage stuff has not come down. "
"3565160","3570920"," So that'll still be a hurt or a ding, but that's already priced in with these companies."
"3571580","3579240"," But you're going to see some of their cost of goods come down for Q3 and pricing to have not"
"3579240","3580460"," come down in this report."
"3581180","3585740"," Now Q4, you might start to see a little bit of that. "
"3586160","3587660"," You might start to see a little bit of that."
"3587660","3591120"," Well, we like this guy over here selling phones cheaper again."
"3591120","3592640"," This guy over here selling eggs, cheaper. "
"3593100","3594340"," So we dropped our pricing."
"3595200","3597260"," You'll see a little bit more shaky Q4."
"3597800","3606680"," And then by Q5, there should be a Q5, Q1 of next year, Q2, you should see another stabilization in"
"3606680","3607500"," corporate earnings. "
"3613440","3614580"," So buy egg stocks."
"3625830","3627890"," Pull on one second and we'll get something here in the background."
"3630070","3631630"," I'm going to check something here. "
"3635530","3636330"," Grinding, baby."
"3636590","3638670"," I just got asked what's going on with spy, just grinding."
"3640290","3645770"," Grinding into sellers, 540, 4555. "
"3651870","3652970"," Let me see here."
"3660610","3662470"," Check my text messages here."
"3662590","3663150"," Just give me a second. "
"3675920","3676560"," Oh, yeah."
"3676680","3678240"," Nice little squeeze on FSR, dude."
"3678500","3678900"," 722. "
"3678980","3679540"," Good job."
"3681180","3709180"," Nice little squeeze in FSR. Google,"
"3709400","3709540"," baby. "
"3709940","3710440"," Nice little squeeze."
"3710900","3711780"," Hourly trigger cross."
"3712000","3713340"," The daily squeeze is over though. "
"3714340","3716960"," It's coming into its first target, that green."
"3717260","3718320"," I'll show you guys right now."
"3719080","3720560"," Yeah, you don't buy good now. "
"3721220","3722840"," There's no buying goog right now."
"3723620","3725060"," You get the cross right here."
"3725260","3727920"," The hourly and daily trigger. "
"3728180","3729960"," This is our first price target above."
"3731360","3731860"," 12502."
"3732520","3733520"," You can see it right there. "
"3734340","3735860"," Almost a perfect pin strike on it."
"3736920","3738000"," Let me now meet this off."
"3740840","3742620"," We already talked about this trade. "
"3743680","3745980"," We talked about this trade last Sunday, I believe."
"3746760","3748520"," The last Thursday or Friday or Sunday."
"3749040","3750160"," That's our first price target. "
"3750420","3758260"," Second price target above 105.02 is 127.41. And then 129.66. So if you are in that trade,"
"3758760","3759720"," take your money and run."
"3760880","3766520"," You're going to look for a pullback at some points to 120.92. Possibly higher."
"3767540","3769060"," We're sitting in the halfback trade. "
"3769180","3772480"," And this is going to be 122 on Google."
"3774600","3781020"," I charted this out last week for you for the target above 125.02. You got two more high targets"
"3781020","3782060"," for extensions."
"3782400","3790300"," 127.41. 129.66. If you wanted to trade today as a day trade. "
"3791400","3793200"," See, there's the target hit right there."
"3794100","3799940"," As long as we stay above 124.56. Play is not dead."
"3800100","3812300"," Your next target above is 127.41. Yeah,"
"3812440","3814480"," we already talked about Google last week. "
"3814640","3818160"," I think last week or something like that or Monday maybe went through all the thing, man tickers."
"3818600","3822620"," I stayed after, didn't I stay after like 415 or something like that?"
"3822780","3823620"," We already went through those."
"3824580","3825500"," So good job. "
"3825740","3833900"," You hit your first target 125.67.68. If you're looking at trade, goog from here long and you're not"
"3833900","3834500"," already long."
"3834660","3843060"," If you're a late buyer, just so you can see it, you'll want to see price stay above 124.64."
"3844680","3849960"," And then the better trade here would be to not be long here."
"3851660","3860760"," But to wait for a break above and consolidation of 125 for an intraday trade. "
"3861500","3863220"," This is take profit right here."
"3863340","3864900"," Just so you know, I can't see that."
"3865740","3867920"," This is take profit right here, right where it is. "
"3868840","3874720"," If it does break above, though, and hold, you can probably take this with a stop underneath from"
"3874720","3879140"," 125 to 127.41. Otherwise, it'll have a pullback."
"3881360","3886120"," Your next buy zone for it is not 123."
"3886240","3891140"," It's likely 120 believe it or not. "
"3891700","3893360"," Possibly 123."
"3895300","3897040"," This would be like my first DC here."
"3900480","3903140"," Somewhere in there, but I'm betting it's down here. "
"3903140","3908200"," I'm betting it's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"3909340","3912220"," You're real next buy in is down here at 122."
"3915480","3916820"," Something like this."
"3935090","3937090"," That's where you get your actual next target right there. "
"3937310","3939190"," So take it from here or take it from down here."
"3947190","3948570"," There's a goog for you."
"3958550","3959530"," Yeah, I've got a."
"3961550","3967030"," Yeah, we already went into Google. "
"3968350","3969350"," The foot, huh?"
"3969930","3973530"," I love the foot, by the way, is a good friend or not good framework where we know each other."
"3974350","3975950"," He always, he sends me."
"3976030","3980990"," I send him DMS. He sends me DMS. I had a really funny conversation with him the other night in"
"3980990","3985270"," DMS. He was like, hey, man, he's like, you should take this long. "
"3985270","3987790"," And we like, I like him."
"3987950","3988610"," He likes me."
"3988790","3991950"," And I'm like, I'm in the DMS and I go, you can't send this shit to me, man. "
"3992610","3995750"," I was like, I was like, we can't send each other anything."
"3996390","3999130"," I was like, people think we're the same people."
"3999510","4003930"," I was like, just like J-roll, like Gavin made J-roll. "
"4004570","4008950"," Um, Gavin made J-roll the foot, uh, hooligan, all those guys."
"4009210","4012890"," I'm like, dude, I'm like, I'm like, all of us are on the same fucking page."
"4013590","4017230"," I'm like, they're going to think we're there because some people out there think we're the same"
"4017230","4017730"," person. "
"4018810","4022730"," Uh, they, I've had people come to me and be like, are you J-roll or you're the foot?"
"4023010","4025370"," And they'll ask those guys if I'm them or they're that."
"4025550","4028250"," Some people know that, like majority of people know we're all different people."
"4029450","4035190"," They were actually not the same, but there are some people that don't know who we are. "
"4035770","4039970"," So they just assume they're like, that's got to be an all to count for, uh, like they're all all"
"4039970","4041090"," all accounts for J-roll."
"4041290","4044630"," They're all all accounts for, uh, Jim James or the foot."
"4044870","4045770"," And the foot's got like what?"
"4046170","4047310"," Three or four all accounts?"
"4047610","4048990"," I think it's got three or four of them. "
"4052590","4055070"," Um, so I'm like, can't send me this shit, man."
"4055090","4056970"," I'm like, we're all same page."
"4057050","4058310"," We all know where the shit's going. "
"4058390","4059210"," Up down doesn't matter."
"4059630","4062610"," I'm like, they'll start saying that we're, that we're the same person."
"4062610","4065430"," Now that we're, we're, we're collusion with each other. "
"4065430","4067670"," We're not like none of us are in collusion with each other."
"4067670","4068710"," We're all doing our own things."
"4073690","4076650"," Yeah, and we're not talking about people like you and I that know each other. "
"4076810","4078470"," Like you know who J-roll is."
"4078770","4081390"," I know we do you've seen J-roll and I stream together, right?"
"4081750","4083470"," We just streamed together a week ago."
"4083690","4087070"," I think we were streaming together last week at some point. "
"4088210","4092430"," Uh, so you might know what I might know, but some people don't know everything."
"4092430","4095950"," And so they just have snapshots and they think, oh, that's the same."
"4096210","4099569"," Those are the same people or they're in conclusion, collusion with each other. "
"4100130","4102029"," And none of us are in conclusion with each other."
"4102029","4103330"," We're all doing our own, our own things."
"4107750","4108529"," Yeah, feet, man. "
"4108609","4109470"," I love, I love the foot."
"4109810","4110149"," He's awesome."
"4113149","4114090"," Yeah, I don't see it. "
"4114290","4116330"," Let me see if there, is there a bear plane on a HYG?"
"4117189","4117470"," Good luck."
"4118210","4122149"," Nah, I don't, I don't see a bear or a bull plane on HYG."
"4126340","4128460"," I see a pullback in HYG right now. "
"4130520","4133340"," Oh, it's trying to hold the, it's trying to hold the five minute right now."
"4133740","4135700"," We could get a big roll coming up here in just a minute."
"4144149","4145430"," Let me see if I see anything here. "
"4149160","4150479"," Dixie's still bloodbath in it."
"4150859","4152200"," Tesla coming down to 270."
"4155970","4160970"," We've got a gap to fill down at 270.01. I'd have you on with a little bit of roll"
"4160970","4161290"," in it. "
"4161689","4162450"," Look at that Nasdaq."
"4162450","4165410"," It just looks like a topping process to me."
"4166029","4166850"," It's all this looks like. "
"4167229","4168430"," Just a big old topping process."
"4168710","4170550"," Be careful of a spy rolling here."
"4178060","4178979"," Yeah, bank earnings. "
"4179220","4180520"," We're going to go over earnings today as well."
"4181340","4183720"," I started talking about earnings at some point this afternoon."
"4184020","4185979"," We'll talk about what to expect from earnings. "
"4186779","4190560"," I think you're going to see really good guidance from the prime banks."
"4193120","4201200"," I think you see, I think you see banks are going to tell a couple things."
"4202780","4205280"," The regional banks are going to be good for them. "
"4205760","4207400"," The absorption of those regional banks."
"4208480","4211540"," I think you're going to see talk about credit crunches."
"4212460","4214380"," I don't know so much if they. "
"4215040","4218260"," How much they discuss the loans they're giving to hedge funds."
"4218740","4221500"," How that's playing into their earnings."
"4222660","4226240"," I'm fascinating to hear their earnings or not the earnings, but the guide. "
"4226240","4230620"," The guy, the earnings call I'm interested in listening to in reading."
"4240090","4244570"," Yeah, people have been talking about vital about by VITL farm eggs."
"4249470","4250610"," We discussed them. "
"4250770","4251990"," I think yesterday before, right?"
"4256020","4257140"," Your feet foot."
"4257320","4258240"," Oh, you like my feet?"
"4258680","4259700"," Because they're talking about feet picks."
"4262020","4271470"," I talk about when you decide to average down. "
"4271470","4275150"," For example, here's a calls right now versus switching to puts."
"4276810","4278410"," Right now, I'm well-hedged."
"4278530","4280150"," I don't need puts. "
"4282330","4287450"," On yesterday's high, I bought somewhere back here."
"4288430","4292910"," On this high right here, I bought 10 cent puts, I think, for Friday."
"4293550","4294770"," I've got monthly puts. "
"4295030","4295810"," I'm well-hedged."
"4296190","4298470"," I'm buying zero dates, right?"
"4298470","4299170"," I'm buying zero dates on the bell."
"4299370","4301230"," Hold these things all day long, see if they print. "
"4301710","4304790"," If we do roll, I'm not going to have any problems here, am I?"
"4305210","4306470"," I'm going to print no matter what."
"4306590","4310630"," Now, if you're talking about averaging in or averaging down, that kind of stuff, what that means to"
"4310630","4310750"," me."
"4312070","4317870"," It interplays the same as the interplan averaging down. "
"4319190","4324170"," The base line here is as long as price holds above the white line, I'm bullish."
"4324810","4325310"," Does that make sense?"
"4327590","4328910"," I'm bullish right now."
"4328990","4329370"," Let's get up. "
"4331450","4333870"," Maybe I can make this easier for you to understand."
"4336050","4338130"," The price is above the white line in the hourly, right?"
"4338350","4339150"," Trend is what?"
"4339630","4340030"," Bullish."
"4341810","4342790"," 15 minute chart. "
"4343550","4347470"," The price staying above the white line in the 15 minute chart, right?"
"4347790","4348150"," What are we?"
"4348610","4349050"," Bullish."
"4349890","4349950"," Right?"
"4350230","4350490"," We're bullish."
"4351790","4353370"," Am I buying puts or buying calls here?"
"4353850","4354930"," On a 15 minute. "
"4355070","4357010"," On a 15 minute basis right now where we are."
"4357650","4359870"," Am I bullish here or bearish?"
"4359950","4360410"," You tell me."
"4362430","4364410"," Do we have a flattening on the 15 minute?"
"4364730","4365350"," Yeah, a little bit. "
"4366350","4368830"," Do we have the white line turning down the 15 minute?"
"4369050","4369230"," No."
"4370350","4372550"," Do we have the price below the white line in the 15 minute?"
"4372830","4373130"," No."
"4374150","4375610"," Now, let's talk about the five minute. "
"4379090","4381050"," It's in the five minute chart, right?"
"4381050","4384510"," Do we have any red bars closing underneath the white line right here?"
"4384910","4385190"," No."
"4385630","4385970"," Right?"
"4386650","4389130"," So for me to begin to get bullish or cut at position."
"4390870","4392790"," That's bearish in a five minute chart. "
"4393070","4394550"," What do I need to see here?"
"4394650","4395090"," Do you know?"
"4396950","4399830"," I really even consider what do I need to see?"
"4400570","4402910"," So Chris, Chris, I'm asking me a question here, right?"
"4403630","4406330"," I need to see a closing red bar underneath, don't I?"
"4409690","4415630"," Like literally closing red bar beneath the white line, right?"
"4416570","4418750"," And then I also need to see what else?"
"4420390","4424910"," A failure green bar to get above the white line, right?"
"4425650","4427330"," Any of that here, do you see any of that?"
"4428830","4430190"," Do you see any of that?"
"4430490","4431010"," No, right?"
"4431470","4432290"," So you're bullish, right?"
"4433970","4436370"," If you see this, though, what does that tell you?"
"4437210","4439390"," It tells you to get out of your calls, doesn't it?"
"4440370","4442630"," See, I have one more green bar that still fails."
"4443310","4445170"," One more green bar that fails to get a new high."
"4445370","4446930"," Now, we do have a lower high here. "
"4447030","4447970"," There's a high lower high."
"4448530","4449770"," That's not positive right now."
"4450070","4451110"," We know about the clock, right?"
"4452070","4454910"," 15 minutes, 30 minutes, one hour, 45 minutes, one hour. "
"4455010","4456270"," We know it starts in the half an hour."
"4457050","4458530"," We know right now bulls have what?"
"4459090","4459870"," It's 1122."
"4459910","4460730"," What do bulls have?"
"4461570","4464330"," They've got eight minutes to get a new high, right?"
"4465450","4465970"," You see that?"
"4466130","4467590"," They have eight minutes to get a new high. "
"4468330","4473870"," So bulls need to get a new high in the next eight minutes, right?"
"4476190","4479690"," If they don't get the new high in the next eight minutes, that's bearish, right?"
"4482110","4486770"," If you're at home and you're watching me, you should be writing down everything I say to you."
"4486910","4487590"," Write it on a piece of paper."
"4488850","4490690"," The shit that I repeat to you every day. "
"4491810","4493050"," You should be writing it down."
"4493230","4493370"," Okay."
"4493470","4497930"," He just told me if he didn't get a new high on the 15, 30, 45, he told me nine,"
"4497930","4500830"," 30 to 10, 30, 11, 30, 12, 30, 12, 30 to 130. "
"4502170","4504290"," He told me a five minute chart."
"4504530","4507210"," If we don't have any closing red bars below the white line, right?"
"4508330","4509230"," That's what happens here, right?"
"4510590","4510970"," As you get."
"4513730","4514230"," Excuse me. "
"4515110","4517570"," I repeat this stuff every day."
"4517570","4519270"," Telling you guys same stuff every day."
"4520330","4521490"," Nothing ever changes here, right?"
"4521590","4523150"," So we'll just watch this right now for me. "
"4525210","4526990"," So you know about the time."
"4527550","4529010"," You know about the crosses."
"4529730","4532750"," You know about price being above the white line, right?"
"4534350","4536550"," So what are you looking for to get bearish?"
"4536890","4538890"," You know, you have people out there like I'm buying puts here. "
"4539630","4540790"," I'm buying puts here."
"4542810","4544130"," I think this is the top."
"4544710","4546830"," This is where they lose all their money thinking that right?"
"4546830","4549290"," They actually have to see a closing red bar down here. "
"4550630","4552930"," They have to see a failure."
"4553390","4555510"," This is where you're drowning a buyer, right?"
"4556910","4557850"," Failure in here."
"4559630","4562450"," They need to see another red bar right here. "
"4562550","4564590"," This even just gets started being bearish."
"4565050","4567210"," This is just getting started."
"4568330","4569670"," You're not even in puts yet. "
"4571230","4574130"," This line is still going up as even rolled yet."
"4574130","4575930"," Haven't even seen the line roll yet."
"4577410","4578170"," You know what I'm saying?"
"4587580","4589720"," You start to see this right here. "
"4590120","4592820"," This is the makings of becoming bearish."
"4593360","4595520"," You get another failure green bar right here."
"4596880","4598480"," You're positioned to buy puts. "
"4599440","4600820"," And then they do this right here, right?"
"4601160","4601760"," Bam, bam, bam."
"4602340","4604420"," You already know your targets right there, right?"
"4604900","4605720"," Take the money and run."
"4608540","4609920"," See another green bar. "
"4610060","4611260"," Come up and what are you looking for here?"
"4611660","4612120"," A failure."
"4614300","4615300"," Jump back in."
"4615700","4616660"," On puts right here. "
"4616880","4618440"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, right?"
"4619320","4621180"," You know your target is down below."
"4621420","4622200"," You already have your pivots."
"4623640","4625120"," You're not even there yet, are you?"
"4626740","4628860"," You can do this in reverse as well, right?"
"4629700","4631200"," Right now, what are we doing here?"
"4631360","4632100"," We can look right above. "
"4632520","4634200"," What are we doing right now, actively?"
"4634740","4636880"," Since I came on stream, I said to you what?"
"4637980","4640240"," I said, we got a lot of supply up here."
"4640900","4644180"," We have a reason for a lot of supply up here."
"4645060","4646920"," What's happening right now to the supply?"
"4647180","4648700"," It's being ground down, right?"
"4649560","4651640"," We're getting rid of these sellers. "
"4651940","4654020"," Now, let's say we fail this right now."
"4654060","4655160"," Let's just say we fail going up."
"4655600","4656820"," What do we also do?"
"4657740","4659980"," We weakened that level above. "
"4660880","4667320"," So the next time we come up here to attack it, we already know that that supply is weak, right?"
"4668120","4670680"," This is our first time attacking this level up here, right?"
"4670820","4671300"," First time."
"4671700","4673620"," Is it likely that we break through this time?"
"4673880","4676740"," No, but we are weakening it, aren't we?"
"4677020","4684700"," So if we ever come back up here again, do you think this resistance will be as strong as it"
"4684700","4684980"," was?"
"4686240","4687280"," No, right?"
"4689460","4693680"," Four minutes left, four bowls to make a new high."
"4695180","4697260"," Four minutes left for bowls to make a new high. "
"4703540","4707580"," If the bowls fail to make a new high at 11.30, who will take over?"
"4708740","4709220"," Sellers."
"4709680","4711820"," They'll take over for one hour."
"4711960","4715360"," They have one hour to have a chance to roll this bad boy down. "
"4716340","4721680"," And what will happen in that time period is you'll find out if we still have demand here or not,"
"4721860","4722000"," right?"
"4722520","4724000"," Do we have demand here?"
"4724220","4725380"," Is the demand right here?"
"4725820","4733120"," In this close yesterday, we were talking about Remember in this close, this is yesterday's close."
"4733360","4733880"," Remember right here?"
"4735480","4737820"," And I was like, you see all these wicks right here?"
"4738120","4739140"," And we talked about these wicks."
"4739260","4741500"," I was like, damn, that's showing some pretty vicious buying. "
"4742620","4746900"," And then I was like, yeah, I was like, not really liking this going down here."
"4747880","4749400"," Remember this thing here?"
"4749520","4751300"," I'm like, you have to get above this right here?"
"4752100","4757320"," And then you saw the algos jump in and they just started ramping the buying in here right on the"
"4757320","4757940"," belly yesterday."
"4758280","4759260"," That's where we got our squeeze. "
"4760400","4762880"," We weren't selling down here into the close yesterday."
"4763860","4765180"," They were algo buying."
"4765820","4767380"," So we're going to be looking for that again today. "
"4769240","4769660"," Right?"
"4769880","4773080"," You've got all these sellers up here, right?"
"4773320","4774620"," Trying to sell it down, sell it down."
"4774980","4776320"," This is our first time up here."
"4777060","4779240"," This is the first time we've been up here, right?"
"4779360","4784280"," We're trying to weaken these sellers up here more than likely takes more than one time to do that. "
"4784580","4786260"," We know where the buyers are, right?"
"4787980","4789960"," Buyers yesterday were down here at this pivot."
"4790760","4792340"," This is where the hourly trigger is."
"4794940","4796100"," We're going to go down here. "
"4796260","4799540"," Once we fail this, we've got two minutes up to find out if we're going to fail it."
"4800080","4804720"," And then we'll do is look down here and test to see if the buyers have come up to 4,"
"4804820","4808960"," 4, 7, 38, or if they're still sitting down here in the hourly trigger."
"4812340","4814540"," Just a couple more minutes left here coming into the hour right now. "
"4816260","4821260"," You've got two more minutes or so left for, you've got one more, two more five minute bars to find"
"4821260","4823640"," out if bulls are in control or not."
"4874870","4879530"," 170,000 puts for today on 4, 48 Ps."
"4881190","4883670"," Just revenge trading this down, man. "
"4885950","4887210"," 11.30 right now."
"4887590","4888970"," Now, I want you to watch this right here."
"4889150","4890390"," Here is the cross to the downside. "
"4891650","4894190"," You'll see on the 6 CMA cross right here."
"4894290","4894870"," I want you to see this."
"4898430","4910670"," This little mini cross right here, just starting to form right there. "
"4911930","4914150"," I'm down here to check this red line."
"4916910","4924530"," We've got a failure by bulls to get a new high on the hourly."
"4973780","4985910"," There, there, there, there, right there. "
"4998210","5000190"," You just slow weight down there."
"5013040","5017820"," There's one more rate here."

"5113220","5113740"," 46. "
"5115780","5117620"," Yeah, there's your PT4 right there."
"5118720","5120380"," That's your target if we can get down there."
"5121600","5124740"," This hourly trigger will likely be right there at that point. "
"5160490","5162790"," Closing bar underneath the white line right now."
"5164030","5168960"," It'll come down right there."
"5171080","5172560"," Back up, fail right there. "

"5265860","5268140"," You'd really appreciate it spiking to the bed."
"5275700","5277940"," I don't think that it shits the bed."
"5280840","5283980"," Let's look at yesterday's algo buying. "
"5284520","5286240"," The algo buying was right here."
"5287340","5288320"," Yeah, it's right here."
"5288380","5289680"," These are the algos that are right here. "
"5290460","5291680"," I go buyers right down here."
"5292260","5297320"," I think they're higher right now, but I don't think they're that low anymore."

"5299740","5305520"," I think they're right here on that yellow."
"5306120","5307560"," I don't think they've got anywhere."
"5309920","5311880"," We're going to see if we can get a close group. "
"5312000","5316500"," We want to see this candle close below the white line."
"5316860","5317780"," That's what we're looking for."
"5319600","5323780"," We got some put set up just in case we get the lower close. "
"5325060","5326400"," I haven't bought them yet."
"5326760","5331300"," Oh boy, oh boy."
"5331300","5332520"," No joy. "
"5332840","5334500"," No closing green down here."
"5337720","5339160"," The algos are higher."
"5342860","5344780"," The algos are not down here. "
"5345140","5346120"," Still green here."
"5346240","5347200"," This is not good for bears."
"5351380","5358110"," We've got some put set up, but no buy here for me. "
"5358210","5358930"," I can't buy this."
"5359190","5359730"," I need a closing."
"5360090","5363230"," I need a closing green candle down here to buy any puts. "
"5363230","5367110"," So this candle needed to close right here."
"5371870","5373730"," No closing green candle."
"5373950","5375490"," Full state alive, baby. "

"5394560","5397100"," I need a closing green candle right here. "
"5397620","5399880"," And then like the next bar to start red."
"5400740","5404000"," I need a closing green candle right there."
"5404180","5405120"," And then this right here. "
"5406620","5408180"," This is not good right now."
"5408620","5410020"," These buyers are trying."
"5455000","5456440"," Hey, hold on one second. "
"5456540","5456980"," I got to do something."
"5598820","5600120"," Can we just one second here?"
"5922960","5923660"," Sorry about that."
"5923720","5927840"," I had to make a comment in a dev form real quick. "
"6011570","6012890"," Yeah, do you see this right now?"
"6012990","6014330"," Some still long calls here too."
"6014670","6016730"," No closing green bar down below here."
"6017910","6019270"," Still move to the upside. "
"6020150","6022430"," I showed you this earlier, what you were looking for, right?"
"6022590","6023830"," You're looking for a green bar."
"6025250","6029930"," You're looking for a green bar down here that had a failure to close."
"6030830","6033730"," So you see that you wanted a green bar that ended right here. "
"6034370","6037210"," And you wanted your next bar to be red set up puts."
"6038370","6042350"," And then you would get that that rope waterfall moved down right there."
"6042470","6043650"," That's the money trade right there. "
"6044270","6049510"," You can see that the green bar broke above trend still to the upside."
"6051070","6054430"," Bull's recovering right now."
"6056730","6058910"," Making another attempt to the upside. "
"6059970","6061550"," Why does it say R1 up there?"
"6062450","6063410"," What's going on here?"
"6063730","6064370"," It's not R1."
"6066010","6066930"," R1's down here."
"6075680","6076420"," Sorry about that. "
"6076480","6077420"," I'm doing some work in the background."
"6083380","6084480"," Bear trapping."
"6085740","6091940"," Bears thinking they had won the hour at 11.30. And right now so far, no. "
"6092340","6097360"," I'm wondering if bears are going to try to slam this down."
"6097500","6098540"," They're going to be pissed right now."
"6099480","6102680"," There's guaranteed there's going to be an algo out here that's pretty pissed off. "
"6103740","6106300"," This is very rare, very unusual to see."
"6106920","6110020"," That's why we're looking for that green bar failure right in here."
"6110520","6116660"," I'm going to assure you that there are sellers here that are pissed off at this trade right here. "
"6117140","6119800"," You can actually see selling coming in right down below."
"6121200","6123340"," This is pure anger right now."
"6123520","6123980"," Very emotional. "

"6128580","6129780"," They're trying to sell this down. "
"6130500","6136020"," So right now there are some sell side traders that are upside down for taking this trade too early."
"6136960","6138220"," So they're very angry."
"6138340","6139780"," There's a hedge fund out there right now. "
"6139900","6143100"," They're like calling the boss and saying how much spy can we sell?"
"6144200","6146240"," How many futures contracts can we sell?"
"6146700","6147260"," How about SPX?"
"6147460","6148760"," Let's sell some of that too right now."
"6153240","6154660"," There's someone out there who's angry."
"6155080","6157160"," You can see a ransom angry bar right there. "
"6157800","6159360"," They're caught in this right now."

"6174540","6175660"," And this is also your stop. "
"6175860","6179020"," If you didn't wait for this green bar to close early and you just took the put."
"6179740","6181560"," You're now trapped and you're going to get fucked."
"6187920","6188800"," Right there. "
"6189980","6191960"," That needed to close right there."
"6192200","6195140"," That green bar needed this green bar right here needed to close."
"6196300","6197120"," Right there. "
"6198040","6199760"," This green bar going up."
"6200060","6200700"," No go."
"6202180","6203420"," Pain trade ahead. "
"6207140","6209320"," You're going to get a hurt and put on you."
"6209380","6209940"," Watch this happen."

"7209980","7211580"," Pain trade, baby."
"7214720","7216280"," Good job, goat mother."
"7217440","7218620"," Good job. "
"7218940","7220400"," That's what I want to hear, goat mother."
"7221780","7225120"," You knew where to close even if you were inputs, right?"
"7225400","7228180"," You knew where your stops were, right?"
"7228360","7234680"," If your stops were here, if your stops were up here, right?"
"7235880","7239220"," And you're waiting for this candle to send us lower, right?"
"7239580","7240240"," You didn't get it."
"7240760","7243320"," You still had another opportunity here to stop out. "
"7243500","7243820"," You see it?"
"7244720","7246680"," This is the reverse for a bear and a bull."
"7247280","7247840"," So we're gonna see this."
"7248000","7254880"," We're gonna look at this so let's say you bought puts here and you just happened to call what you"
"7254880","7259420"," shouldn't have but if you did, you're just like fucking throwing shit out there. "
"7259540","7263140"," Hey, it's, oh no, or it's 11.30, bulls for your bulls failed, right?"
"7263400","7264720"," 11.30 right here, bulls failed."
"7265880","7267100"," So you got puts, right?"
"7267420","7270140"," And what are you looking for here?"
"7270340","7272660"," You're looking for a failure candle right here, right?"
"7273480","7275160"," So you see this green candle right here?"
"7276260","7277520"," Bulls didn't fail, did they?"
"7278360","7280240"," You didn't get the red candle right here, right?"
"7280580","7282180"," But what, what can you take from this?"
"7282680","7284180"," What can you take from this as a lesson?"
"7285700","7288280"," Do you see how we had the green up?"
"7288580","7290400"," You know now that the bulls won."
"7291000","7292520"," You get one red candle here. "
"7292580","7293660"," Here's your first opportunity."
"7295240","7298760"," Here's your first opportunity right there."
"7300200","7303980"," This red candle to just close your short. "
"7304780","7307000"," Here's your second opportunity right there."
"7307700","7308940"," To close your short."
"7309740","7312860"," So you should have been at that point what not fucked up either, right?"
"7313000","7315500"," You probably, you wouldn't have been fucked up if you closed it up here. "
"7316240","7321340"," But as we have one, two red candles, you have a chance to actually get out of getting fucked up."
"7322200","7328860"," You probably would have been flatter up slightly, closed, turned, bull, and been able to buy this"
"7328860","7331440"," green candle, boom, boom, boom, boom, all the way up."
"7331440","7331840"," Whoop. "
"7341090","7342210"," You guys get that?"
"7342490","7343090"," You see that?"
"7343270","7345530"," This is a great example right here of reversal."
"7346790","7348130"," Opportunity to get out."
"7348610","7351750"," Even if you, even if you were in here, let's say 11.30 right here, right?"
"7352390","7354590"," It's a great fucking example right here. "
"7355290","7358390"," So there's 11.30 right there."
"7359530","7368030"," There's 11.30. So you buy puts, yep, bulls failed."
"7368490","7369550"," Yeah, who were going down?"
"7370590","7375370"," You already know that you're looking for no green above this. "
"7376010","7377470"," It starts to see price go up."
"7378390","7380630"," And you see this green candle break above."
"7380850","7381730"," This shouldn't have happened. "
"7382530","7383730"," Shouldn't have had that happen."
"7384430","7387290"," But the more that you see that, you're like, oh shit."
"7388210","7390070"," But they give you an opportunity. "
"7390530","7391210"," We go down."
"7391870","7393510"," We go down once more."
"7393910","7400010"," They give you an opportunity here and here for you to trigger your stops and then even turn long in"
"7400010","7400890"," the market right here. "
"7401230","7401730"," You see that?"
"7402230","7403710"," So you get a chance in here."
"7404270","7408730"," If you're counting candles, if you're watching this in a five minute, putting back and forth in a"
"7408730","7411430"," five and a one minute, you can see it before it even happens."
"7411910","7415390"," You can predict the move higher with confidence. "
"7417970","7419530"," What else can you predict here?"
"7420790","7421630"," You can see it, right?"
"7422590","7423970"," The white line is going up."
"7424230","7424670"," That's bullish."
"7425450","7427410"," It's vertical almost near vertical, right?"
"7428090","7431090"," So they're gonna come back down here, get it all pissed off and pissy. "
"7431910","7433550"," And there's an opportunity for you."
"7433930","7435670"," Probably you'd snap a line right here, right?"
"7436410","7438870"," Come in here and just draw a little line and be like, yeah, you know what?"
"7439070","7440310"," I want to buy the next dip high."
"7440490","7442470"," You could just snap yourself a line just like this. "
"7444650","7448630"," And you see this white line and that line with two lows, one low, two low."
"7449110","7450570"," Like, yeah, I want to go up."
"7450890","7455830"," Sometimes you'll miss these, but you have a one chance to buy here, one chance to buy right here"
"7455830","7461150"," and likely one more chance to buy right where my cursor see it right there. "
"7462170","7465050"," So now you're like, can I buy a dip here or not?"
"7465630","7466070"," Let's look."
"7488950","7497950"," You can start a position right here or if you want to be safer, you'll wait for this green candle"
"7497950","7500470"," to get above and close above right here."
"7502430","7504530"," You don't need all of it. "
"7504650","7509130"," You can just wait for this red line, you see yellow line right here and you wait for this candle"
"7509130","7514290"," right here and you just grab that right there and you'll go up and you'll hit our PT two rep"
"7514290","7514530"," both."
"7515750","7517850"," So just watch this green candle right now."
"7518230","7519690"," You don't want to see the red candle. "
"7520390","7521970"," You don't see the pin right here."
"7522390","7524070"," See where my cursor is right there."
"7524450","7526730"," If this next one's a red candle, it'll go down, right?"
"7528210","7530850"," We'll bloodbath that and tag and that'll be your actual bite of the upside. "
"7531450","7537270"," If you want to get aggressive, you could buy this right now and buy this and have stops below here."
"7537770","7541170"," You start here, adds to your position for this bigger move higher."
"7541950","7544910"," If you want it to be more conservative, just always be a winner. "
"7545430","7554680"," You're going to look for this yellow right here and you're going to look for a green candle that"
"7554680","7558620"," closes above right there."
"7558720","7563780"," You get that green kind of closes above, have your calls set up and you're going to rip faces to"
"7563780","7564120"," the upside."
"7565660","7567400"," Let's watch this play out right now. "
"7567400","7569580"," We're in a one minute chart right here."
"7570500","7574380"," I'm long calls, by the way, if you want to know, but let's look at it in a five minute"
"7574380","7574660"," chart."
"7574660","7575520"," See it right there?"
"7577460","7582620"," So the easier way to trade this in a five minute chart, what I always recommend, because people get"
"7582620","7586320"," panicky in here, they're like, oh shit, I'm scared. "
"7586840","7591200"," I got stopped and I'm like, I mean, on stream, I'm like, yeah, how we do it like this?"
"7592960","7596660"," How about see this yellow right here coming up?"
"7599020","7599780"," Right there."
"7600960","7602180"," I got this yellow right here."
"7602780","7603160"," Got bought. "
"7603700","7604580"," This would be your buy."
"7605580","7607420"," This would be your DCA right here."
"7609900","7611280"," Easier stops down here. "
"7614240","7615260"," It's a little bit slower."
"7615460","7621520"," It's a little bit easier like green candle, red candle, green candle, DCA candle, boom, boom, boom"
"7621520","7622860"," to the upside in a five minute chart."
"7622860","7624800"," It stops down here. "
"7625320","7630220"," Even if you get a red candle down here and you get panicky just like the bears, you bloodbath down"
"7630220","7634780"," here, you're still going to get a green candle up before."
"7635440","7636640"," Remember back here?"
"7637720","7642820"," You're still going to get that one more green candle where you can unfuck yourself in your stops."
"7642960","7643560"," Does that make sense?"
"7644300","7649440"," Red candle down, green candle back up with a failure, then you get out of your trade to the upside. "
"7650700","7652560"," You guys understanding all this concept here?"
"7657850","7659010"," You guys getting all this?"
"7659570","7661010"," Is that this reversal right here?"
"7661250","7662430"," See that green bar right there?"
"7663150","7666950"," That same thing will happen right over here if we're not bullish."
"7667890","7670250"," So you'd come back up, watch my cursor right there."
"7670510","7675650"," You'd then trigger your own stops, spam them out, even if we're going up, right?"
"7676190","7677130"," It gives you the opportunity. "
"7678050","7680430"," If it did roll, right?"
"7680430","7685150"," So let's say we start this again and we roll down here."
"7685390","7686830"," I'm going to draw it out for you."
"7686990","7692390"," So you got, let's say you do this here and I'm long right now. "
"7692630","7701580"," So you do this here, as you do that there, declining, right?"
"7702220","7705820"," We don't start skyrocketing and then we get a big red bar right here, right?"
"7707560","7711260"," And you panic."
"7712260","7713600"," You're like freaking out."
"7716720","7720900"," You're still looking for that one more green bar minimum. "
"7721560","7722960"," Comes right back up."
"7723580","7724800"," That's this right here."
"7725320","7725940"," Same thing. "
"7727120","7735930"," Now if this green candle fails and reverses here, right?"
"7737570","7740910"," You're still going to have time to get out on your stops."
"7741670","7751170"," So you're buying DCA, DCA, falls underneath for you."
"7751410","7752550"," Oh shit, I fucked up. "
"7753110","7762070"," You get another chance to at least get out of your bullish conviction that we're going up, right?"
"7762970","7765950"," And you don't really get fucked in the way down over here, do you?"
"7766150","7767850"," Same thing in the reverse over here."
"7768490","7769950"," Does that make sense to you?"
"7770670","7771850"," Do you guys understand what I'm saying?"
"7774980","7778000"," You're looking at things like this white line."
"7778460","7780380"," Is it see the yellow line going down?"
"7780860","7782140"," See the white line going sideways?"
"7782880","7786140"," What's the yellow line telling you going up right now?"
"7786560","7787260"," What is it telling you?"
"7787660","7789820"," Look at the yellow line going down. "
"7790300","7791860"," Look at the white line going sideways."
"7792780","7793960"," What is that telling you?"
"7794240","7796200"," Sideways neutral down bearish."
"7796600","7799820"," What is this yellow line telling you and this white line telling you?"
"7801720","7802360"," Bush. "
"7826970","7828430"," Dip by down here."
"7828950","7830510"," Next by over here, right?"
"7830730","7830890"," You go."
"7831630","7841510"," Dip by DCA by first entry that rolls back down"
"7841510","7842490"," and that's your big one. "
"7843270","7844730"," There it is right there, right?"
"7845450","7846470"," Bam to the upside."
"7848130","7849370"," Fails on you."
"7850690","7853070"," An opportunity to at least get unfucked in here, right?"
"7854430","7856090"," What's your conviction right now?"
"7856270","7856910"," Upside. "
"7867120","7869280"," Do these sellers are boost."
"7889100","7892820"," Ah, return to normalization on Dixie."
"7894480","7895280"," Finally. "
"7898220","7899020"," Finally."
"7899420","7901260"," Love seeing Dixie getting sold down."
"7901660","7901840"," Love it. "
"7903240","7904320"," Dixie, man."
"7904620","7905980"," Let's get let's make Dixie $90."
"7906560","7907360"," How about that?"
"7907540","7908620"," Let's make Dixie $90. "
"7912360","7916120"," Let's make let's make let's make the dollar cheap again."
"7921280","7925000"," Let's put Dixie in a free fall to $89."
"7928880","7931720"," Let's make Dixie normal again. "
"7932140","7933160"," Let's normalize Dixie."
"7938440","7942000"," Back to the good old days where Dixie was $72."
"7950660","7952320"," Oh, no, I've still got monthly puts. "
"7953120","7954880"," I paid for those a long time ago."
"7955060","7958720"," I've been making so much money in this run that they're just free at this point."
"7958880","7965980"," They just stay on the books until probably the first week of August, maybe July 30th, 31st"
"7965980","7966580"," somewhere in there. "
"7967700","7969700"," They just stay on while I trade the market up."
"7970940","7976300"," It's just I have a hedge on the market to make sure that we have some risk to a correction"
"7976300","7978520"," for no for no good goddamn reason."
"7980520","7986560"," So I've got a hedge on the market for the month of July for a correction, like just like a"
"7986560","7988000"," middle of the day, bloodbath. "
"7988480","7990100"," We dropped like 70 points."
"7993100","7997880"," Like you guys ever noticed like we'll be just rolling around the market one day and a Wednesday and"
"7997880","8002080"," all of a sudden like 12 o'clock in the afternoon, we just plunge 70 points."
"8005160","8007280"," We're due for a current where we're getting close. "
"8007560","8013800"," So as we head into late July and early August, we're due for like a correction with no with no"
"8013800","8014680"," apparent reason given."
"8017860","8019120"," So I've paid for that."
"8019300","8020980"," I've bought and paid for those at this point. "
"8021280","8023180"," I've made so much fucking money in this run."
"8023180","8023940"," It's not even funny."
"8024220","8030360"," So yeah, it's not a black swan. "
"8030480","8033620"," It's be careful of when that happens too."
"8033980","8040020"," I think we've talked about that in this show a lot like if you're new to the show, we can"
"8040020","8040380"," look at it."
"8040500","8041140"," We'll look at it right now. "
"8041180","8041340"," You ready?"
"8042360","8046140"," What I'm trying to say to you guys out there, I'll give you guys an example."
"8046600","8053920"," So any of you that have been longtime market participants know that like every month to three"
"8053920","8061960"," months, you get like selling for not just like distribution or consolidation or rotation, you'll"
"8061960","8065300"," get like a corrective movement."
"8066000","8068720"," And a few things, signs of this. "
"8070040","8076320"," Oftentimes, the news is bullshit or there's no news or it's like just middle of the day, just"
"8076320","8077160"," relentless selling."
"8079040","8081540"," And they're common in a bull market."
"8082320","8084900"," Not a bull run or bull run bull market. "
"8085640","8086780"," They're very common."
"8087720","8092140"," So your expectation is that it's going to happen."
"8092720","8100820"," So it's not just an expectation like, yeah, as an example where it hasn't happened, it's always"
"8100820","8102100"," happened in a bull market. "
"8102300","8107700"," So if the thesis, oh man, baby, if the thesis is right now, is it?"
"8109900","8119920"," If the thesis is right"
"8119920","8129140"," now, how"
"8129140","8139040"," about the how about the how about the how about the"
"8139040","8151100"," how about The"
"8152800","8154540"," By the way, thank you for tuning in every day."
"8154980","8157780"," I'm going to give all of you for just tuning in for the first time, I'm going to give you"
"8157780","8162800"," an edge in the market and all times I'm going to give you the tools that you need to be"
"8162800","8165240"," a better trader, you understand"
"8165240","8176060"," what"
"8176060","8186020"," I'm saying to you, I'm going to give you an"
"8186020","8187300"," edge in this market."
"8187720","8193799"," So what I want to talk to you about here, though, is the longer that we don't trade down to"
"8193799","8199600"," the weekly, the more likely it becomes that we get there. "
"8199760","8204700"," So like one month passes, two months pass, three months pass, four months pass, five months pass,"
"8205620","8206680"," at some point it's going to happen."
"8206680","8212879"," Now, when that happens, or before you even get there, if we're in a bull market, there's only one,"
"8212879","8217219"," I think one or two examples historically that have only lasted about six months."
"8218340","8225400"," Every other bull market bull run has lasted at minimum one year. "
"8226980","8234480"," The top of the curve is like three to five years, six, seven years and further on the other side"
"8234480","8234959"," of that curve."
"8234959","8243000"," You got a curve, right, you got a bell curve, just like that, you know, one year down here."
"8243280","8251379"," Only two examples, whole mess of examples up here, way less as we go farther years, right?"
"8251920","8256540"," So like just think we're going to only get six is going to be an oddity, six months be an"
"8256540","8256840"," oddity. "
"8257459","8264920"," Very, so the probability that our bull run only lasts this long is very low, like ten fifteen"
"8264920","8265980"," percent chance."
"8267799","8273139"," On average, it'll likely last a year minimum, possibly two or three years."
"8273820","8276180"," That's when you hear guys out there saying we could go to six thousand. "
"8276459","8277020"," That's what they mean."
"8277879","8282480"," Not six thousand this December, but just this could last longer than we anticipate."
"8283740","8287340"," And if they're looking at a bell curve and they make that statement, they're making that statement"
"8287340","8289920"," because there's like a fifty percent chance that could happen. "
"8290600","8292480"," That's not high, but it's pretty good."
"8292799","8293240"," It's not bad."
"8293240","8295719"," It's not ten percent or five percent. "
"8295940","8303260"," Now saying all that out of the way, right, if we are in a bull market, as time passes, if"
"8303260","8311260"," we haven't gone back to correct to the weekly, the probability of that happening becomes stronger."
"8313260","8316400"," Sometimes the reasons for that to happen become convoluted."
"8317240","8318620"," Sometimes there's no reason. "
"8318860","8322879"," If you're a long time market participant, you've been in the market and you've seen everything is"
"8322879","8323340"," going fine."
"8323540","8325920"," And then all of a sudden, wam, wam, wam, we start selling down."
"8327760","8329959"," Sometimes it recovers forty five minutes later. "
"8330420","8335219"," Sometimes leads to a major down move, and then we're back to normal again, going back up again."
"8335900","8337940"," I don't care what the reason given is."
"8338080","8339620"," I don't give a fuck what the news is. "
"8339620","8341420"," I don't give a fuck what anyone says."
"8341920","8343100"," You shouldn't either."
"8343719","8348500"," You should just know that it's there, and as time passes, it becomes more apparent. "
"8348500","8352459"," Price will change where that is, but you have to be aware of it at least."
"8353299","8358500"," And I want you to remember this because if and when it happens, I don't want you drinking the"
"8358500","8359780"," fucking Kool-Aid out there."
"8360160","8365780"," I don't want you to because you I have, I'm saying you, I have drank that Kool-Aid. "
"8366480","8372660"," So when we've had those rollovers down to the weekly, like the first one, I'm like, yeah, I'm"
"8372660","8373280"," buying that dip."
"8373459","8373780"," I don't care."
"8373780","8377860"," And sometimes I get caught in that weekly trade too, like I'll be buying the daily. "
"8378600","8383299"," And sure enough, I get one more roll down to the weekly, and I'm like, shit, I didn't put enough"
"8383299","8385920"," time on my spreads, I'm going to get fucked in this trade."
"8387120","8390020"," But the point here is that you shouldn't be drinking the Kool-Aid."
"8390220","8397380"," And like two times I've lost the most money in my life, two times, was on that weekly correction,"
"8398120","8400680"," the third time, both times, third time of the year that time. "
"8401960","8403640"," And it's because I drank the Kool-Aid."
"8405080","8409140"," People I trusted were like, you know, third time down here, man, we're going to roll this picture."
"8409340","8410000"," We're going to roll it over. "
"8410820","8411620"," It shouldn't say that word."
"8412400","8413340"," We're going to roll it over."
"8414360","8415280"," Full port puts. "
"8416100","8416840"," And that's what I did."
"8417720","8422780"," Fucking 100 grand, 120 grand, like we're going down and we're not going down, we're down there."
"8423360","8427860"," And I'm calculating and I'm like, dude, I'm going to make fucking millions on this market roll"
"8427860","8428200"," here. "
"8428980","8433200"," When there were other things saying no, that was just the correction."
"8434000","8439600"," So if and when we get that correction in the next month or two, there are ways for us to"
"8439600","8442960"," find out if it's just the correction or if it's an actual market roll."
"8443720","8446580"," I'm going to talk to you about, I already talked about all the ways, I'm going to give you a"
"8446580","8453700"," simple way to understand the concept I'm given to you and what I mean by this. "
"8454380","8464120"," Look at that briefly here and what I'm trying to express to you, the ideas that I'm trying to"
"8464120","8464880"," express to you."
"8467670","8470090"," I'm going to try to do it simply for you, okay?"
"8473880","8477340"," So here's just one previous bull run right here."
"8479140","8483500"," Didn't come down here that often this one, did we?"
"8483500","8489760"," Pop up, pop up and away, broke below the daily, close to the weekly, first big touch right here. "
"8490920","8492900"," But in the beginning of it, we had how many?"
"8493320","8497780"," We had one, two, three, four of this bull run, right?"
"8498140","8508000"," One, two, three, four, October, September, right?"
"8508180","8509880"," We had a little bit of a break back here in September."
"8509880","8514040"," Only got down too close to the daily and this time period here."
"8514480","8518820"," Here's a couple more, here's another bull run, get down to the orange right there, get down to the"
"8518820","8523820"," orange right there, get down to the orange right there, but there's a distinct difference here. "
"8524920","8525840"," Do you see the difference?"
"8527020","8532680"," I'm going to point it out to you, do you see how this yellow line doesn't cross?"
"8533300","8538600"," Notice how the yellow line doesn't cross the orange, notice how this yellow line doesn't cross the"
"8538600","8538760"," orange."
"8539500","8540840"," Notice how this one did?"
"8542180","8543900"," So you can see the difference, right?"
"8545480","8546860"," Yellow line crossing, right?"
"8547740","8549800"," You can see the difference back here too, right?"
"8550120","8551060"," You can see them in all these things."
"8551520","8554880"," Here's other ways, we're not going to look at them today, but notice how the yellow line didn't"
"8554880","8555380"," cross here. "
"8556580","8561260"," Notice how the yellow line didn't cross here, notice how the yellow line did cross there."
"8562020","8569920"," So my point to you though, right now is it's not rare for us to come back and try to"
"8569920","8574760"," mess when we have a normalization of market series, so normalize this is price, yellow, orange,"
"8574880","8577040"," blue, right, normalized markets."
"8577980","8578720"," So what do you do?"
"8579060","8584020"," You trade the market up, it's in front of you and as time passes you go, yeah, there might be"
"8584020","8587780"," some bullshit reason we roll down at some point, right?"
"8588100","8592800"," You trade this market up, trade this market up, yeah, there might be some bullshit reason why we"
"8592800","8593500"," run down here. "
"8593660","8598420"," If I know that I'm going to trade this market all the way up, I know as time passes, here's"
"8598420","8605620"," September, here's October, I know that as we do this, there's a likelihood that we're going to hit"
"8605620","8606100"," that weekly."
"8606980","8609120"," How much do puts costs right now, do you know?"
"8609900","8617420"," Dirt cheap, they're like dirt cheap, why is the market continuing higher?"
"8617420","8621860"," Because we're well hedged, right, we're well hedged."
"8622540","8630000"," So if you're well hedged and you're making money with the market going up, this great little dip"
"8630000","8630780"," buys here, right?"
"8631000","8635660"," Come on down here, buy the dip, come on down here, buy the dip, right?"
"8637220","8638780"," What happens over here, right?"
"8639100","8639460"," Watch that. "
"8641300","8649700"," Buy the dip, buy some puts, buy the dip, buy some puts, buy the dip, buy some puts, buy the"
"8649700","8652200"," dip, buy some puts, make sense?"
"8653040","8659060"," Puts dirt cheap, calls dirt cheap, make sense?"
"8661900","8666840"," Make sense, you guys, it's always making sense to you, right?"
"8667200","8669480"," Buy some puts, buy some ratio puts."
"8669480","8676800"," Ratio puts, I'm not a ratio puts, but ratio spreads even cheaper, those things are free."
"8678140","8680100"," So what are we doing up here right now?"
"8680100","8681000"," We're topping, right?"
"8681980","8687720"," We've got that nice little curve right there coming into a little topping action up here, roll down"
"8687720","8688780"," over here, right?"
"8689380","8691180"," All this comes up right here, do you see it?"
"8694000","8696700"," No dip buy up here, are you seeing that right now?"
"8697820","8703220"," You watching that in here, like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"8703320","8707600"," Now what happens if we break below here, I've got some crash puts, baby, I've got some ratios"
"8707600","8713900"," spreads, no problemo, I've got some stops over here, right, I've got some stops over here, right?"
"8714680","8720200"," It's all makes sense to you, and the longer that we don't do that, the greater the chances that"
"8720200","8725160"," we're going to roll down and possibly even tag this down here, right now we're coming into 420."
"8726020","8735940"," So 420, oh, what was that right there daddy, what"
"8735940","8745140"," was that right there daddy, what is that right there, what's that right there daddy, what's that"
"8745140","8748540"," there baby boy, let me put it back over there for you."
"8761370","8771690"," It's going on up there daddy, so my point to you here is if we get that correction right, it's"
"8771690","8780970"," not going to be unexpected, if we get that correction you can buy cheap protection, you can buy put"
"8780970","8789970"," spreads cheap, you can buy puts cheap, they're dirt cheap up here, you can buy ratio spreads, put"
"8789970","8796170"," back spreads, you buy a put back spread up here as we head higher, you put a month on it,"
"8796290","8802770"," two months, three months on it, you can kind of aim for a general area, and guess what, if we"
"8802770","8810350"," continue higher, they're going to pay you, they're going to be even, guess what you're not going to"
"8810350","8815510"," do, you're not going to lose any money in a ratio spread are you, if it rolls down and you"
"8815510","8819170"," actually get that correction, guess what, they're going to print like three, four, five hundred"
"8819170","8822650"," percent for you, you understand"
"8822650","8832650"," what I'm saying, so that's what we're in, we're"
"8832650","8840870"," buying the dip, when we get up here, what are you doing, putting on some ratio spreads boss, oh are"
"8840870","8853360"," you really, why, because they pay me either way, oh they do, yeah they do, what happens"
"8853360","8863310"," if the market is well hedged and you're buying it as it goes up, do you know, the market continues"
"8863310","8872550"," to go up, right, hold on a second here, if you don't know what I'm talking"
"8872550","8884670"," about, here's a link for you to watch on a put back spread, there's"
"8884670","8891270"," a video, click on it, open it up at home on a tab, then I want you to click the"
"8891270","8898550"," star button, and I want you to watch it later tonight, then I want you to watch it again and"
"8898550","8904310"," again and again, then I want you to get inside the discord and say, hey I need to know what,"
"8904430","8914090"," I want you to go inside of the discord to the trading channel, or the educational content"
"8914090","8923490"," channels, or go into an ask, find John L, or find David AMS, or"
"8923490","8933310"," go into the trading floor after market hours and say, hey, say can"
"8933310","8941610"," somebody explain the mechanics of how this works, and they'll explain it to you, someone will"
"8941610","8948570"," likely explain it to you and say, this is how the mechanics of this trade works, this is how you"
"8948570","8969890"," hedge yourself in a bull market, in"
"8969890","8978290"," case we get a corrective move, unseen by the market, this is how it pays"
"8978290","8988610"," you or goes up, so you know how to hedge yourself, you"
"8988610","8997580"," know where to hedge yourself, you know you're trading, we can"
"8999150","9008950"," just rip to R3 right now at this point, 45158, dude,"
"9009710","9021490"," 45158, dude, I don't think we get out there, no fucking way, all right, it's up there, I don't"
"9021490","9031770"," see it, but, okay, let's find out, dude, TT3"
"9035190","9045870"," right there, hot damn dog, hot damn, hot damn,"
"9046550","9052690"," so same thing we do right here, what right, remember this right here, what do we do right here, we"

"9058470","9067230"," thing as earlier, snap a line, right down there, right, probably right there, we'll take a look at"
"9067230","9076730"," the five minute chart, right there, same thing, boom, and you're gonna see this white line"
"9076730","9084950"," crawl up, it'll be right about there, so we'll actually bring that back a little bit, right about"
"9084950","9096200"," there, bring that one right about there, and"
"9096200","9105520"," we'll find out right now, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, okay, so"
"9105520","9112160"," when do we know if the run is over, do you guys want me to explain this part to you,"
"9112600","9119120"," so when do you know that this push higher is over, we know we talked about this earlier, right,"
"9119460","9152940"," failure to get a new"
"9152940","9159860"," high on the half an hour, we're going to be looking for a new high again, right, if we fail"
"9159860","9164640"," to get a new high on this consolidation, one, two, three, we're looking for a new high five,"
"9164680","9169220"," believe it or not, if we fail to get it, we will roll it back down and come back down"
"9169220","9174220"," here and check again right at 447.95 down here,"
"9198980","9213580"," so"
"9228850","9232120"," see this here right here, we're gonna show you guys something, well I'm just posting this on"

"9364860","9370100"," can buy the daily, we know we can buy the hourly, we know that we can buy dips with safety"
"9370100","9375460"," right, we know that when we get two tops and we come into a topping process that you can begin"
"9375460","9383320"," to hedge the market right, we don't care about that hedge because if we do it correctly we are able"
"9383320","9391300"," to trade this market up, here's a discord for you to join, get inside the discord, I posted one a"
"9391300","9400880"," few minutes ago on YouTube, here's one for, actually on Twitter, on Twitch, now do one, I just did"
"9400880","9406320"," one for you on YouTube, so if you're not on our discord get in there, there's no reason for you"
"9406320","9411260"," not to get in there and trade with those people, no reason at all, you have a group of retail"
"9411260","9418040"," traders that are very good at what they do, they make money consistently, they tell you before and"

"10257370","10263810"," shit, so I don't want to see a closing bar, if I do see a closed bar below the white"

"10316330","10324910"," an update today for a whiskey and cocaine lunch for Wall Street, so roughly around 1.30, 1.45, I'm"
"10324910","10329670"," going to try to wrap this trade up and see a little bit of flattening here, I'm watching this right"

"10340690","10347430"," we'll pay attention to it and see, oh dude I'm up right now, I'm green right now, so we'll pay"

"10354210","10360750"," have like one more chance for a move higher, if this doesn't go higher, you know what happens, 1 "
"10360750","10367370",".32, 30 sometimes, we'll do a quick roll over, while everybody's off cheering and making money and"
"10367370","10372030"," you know getting lunch and all that kind of stuff, I'll just pay attention, this is a classic setup"
"10372030","10385710"," for a roll until later in the afternoon, so I bought right there, and see"
"10385710","10392270"," how they're trying to re-eventstrate this down right now, trying to get down here, I'm still up 6,"
"10392530","10407370"," I'm still up fucking like 6 cents, so do"
"10407370","10413630"," I know, do I know, I've bounced between both, I bounced throughout the course of a day, so if you"
"10413630","10423550"," guys want to know what I do, I'm watching the tool here in the background, I'm watching the tool"
"10423550","10428050"," here in the background, I've also got a screener up, it's a good question, a screener up on my"
"10428050","10438850"," right here, you can't see it, it's got 6 charts, it's got HYG, VIX, Dixie, right now Tesla, NDX,"

"10446490","10453230"," Apple or Google or NVIDIA, I'll switch it up on that extra chart, then on my right hand side down"
"10453230","10461610"," below, I have my brokerage open, I've got Discord open, then I've got the background here, book"
"10461610","10468850"," map, but I watch my, another screener over here, I watch book map, and then on the right hand side,"
"10468930","10475870"," I've got a Twitch open, YouTube open, I've got tweet, Twitter open, I've got financial juice open,"
"10480170","10484990"," that's a good question by the way, so here I bought down here, what do they want to do here,"
"10485110","10491370"," same as earlier, so a seller right now wants to get underneath, right, they want a closing red bar,"
"10491490","10496810"," that means not this bar, I could be this bar, but what that means is they want the next bar"
"10496810","10506730"," to be red and stay down here, like it closes here, to make sense, now you might"
"10506730","10514310"," panic sell here, if you were long calls and be like, oh, triggered my stops, you likely get another"

"10522710","10528270"," I'm saying, even if it was going to roll down, you'll likely have some time, now the reason I'm"
"10528270","10533870"," trading a five-minute chart with you guys on stream is because we used to trade a one-minute chart"
"10533870","10543130"," here and traders would panic, trading a five-minute chart in live stream is"
"10543130","10552910"," less scary to new traders, it's a"
"10552910","10562810"," slower, they're not seeing the things that scare traders on a five-minute chart, same thing applies"
"10562810","10570190"," to a 15-minute chart, so if you're in a 15-minute chart, now the same, this is the same"
"10570190","10576390"," as a five-minute or one-minute chart, right, trend is up, you get one trade right there, you get"
"10576390","10583150"," another trade to add to your trade up, right, we're trading now the 2070MA right here, so like"
"10583150","10588890"," let's say right now you wanted to trade even slower, do you want to do like slower like even"
"10588890","10594910"," beginner trading, what are you looking for to buy, you're looking to add right around this 440-805,"
"10595490","10600510"," you see that, so you're probably long still right now believe it or not, until you have a closing"
"10600510","10607090"," bar below this yellow line, right, you're still long, you bought this closed yesterday, again you"
"10607090","10612830"," guys didn't see this yesterday, we were on stream and right, look at this bar right here, we just"
"10612830","10620650"," bought the fuck out of this after the bell, we just bought the fuck of that out of the bell,"
"10620910","10634580"," so right now I'm long, about a dip, a five-minute, that's a one-minute chart, excuse me, about a"
"10634580","10639720"," dip in a five-minute, if this begins to roll, I'm assuming people are going to take a lunch here,"

"10648120","10656840"," sometimes like not all the time, most bold days, like 80% of the time we get the roll, but"
"10656840","10661580"," the other 30% of the time sometimes we go up, we actually make the run between 130 and 230"

"10677410","10687270"," roll coming up in the 6CMA, price trading below the 6CMA, trade likely over for now, bears"

"13482360","13491760"," infrastructure issues in Michigan, it's very frustrating too, some from the west where weather is"
"13491760","13500060"," really bad, makes most of the country look like it's like those Vermont's floods are nothing, those"
"13500060","13505520"," are regular in the west, those happen regularly, so they build their infrastructure in the west to"
"13505520","13511240"," accommodate that stuff, but that's what I'm used to is like everything being buried, it's like if"
"13511240","13519900"," you live in the worst places for like weather and stuff, they're kind of forced into having great"
"13519900","13528600"," infrastructure, but like I moved to Michigan and like the whole system here is built upon like"
"13528600","13535480"," roads that need to be rebuilt so people have jobs, ways and means committee senators and roads"
"13536160","13544000"," senators that get money for the state, so they don't build just build things to last here and then"
"13544000","13551720"," the power company here is a disaster right, I mean I don't dislike linesman or not want them to get"
"13551720","13558860"," jobs or anything, but even our whole energy system in the state is built around it breaking and"
"13558860","13565020"," since I haven't lived here long but since I've lived here, they've due rate increases here and"
"13565020","13574460"," power out of their minds, like out of their minds, like 3%, 10%, 7%, like year over year"
"13574460","13582600"," and no buried lines, I live in a county where they didn't spend any of their COVID money"
"13582600","13590740"," and they just banked it and put they had to air market by a certain date and we were having"
"13590740","13596620"," a discussion in the reddit forum about what they were going to do with that money. "
"13598660","13609060"," I was shocked because I was like, I was like do something infrastructure like schools, bridges,"
"13609820","13618620"," do the electric, do attract a company here, like something that pays dividends down the roads,"
"13619280","13627120"," instead they're like oh I've got this pet project, oh I've got this, they're not stupid things, but"
"13627120","13635740"," they're not like, I was talking to Winky, I visited Winky, we were talking about how like great"
"13635740","13645360"," projects, like the interstate system was a great project, it was an infrastructure project that"
"13645360","13646480"," helped people."
"13649100","13657880"," So like we don't do those things anymore in this country, if you go to Mexico City right now,"

"13664260","13672920"," If you go to Mexico City right now, their infrastructure work would blow your mind."

"13692060","13700180"," scary, bothersome, it's very greedy, Winky made this comment and he was like everything that we do"
"13700900","13709140"," is now tied towards profit, even when we do these projects, they're all profit driven and as a"
"13709140","13717600"," nation we're not taking on these, there's a word for it too and I'm forgetting in mind, but"
"13717600","13728200"," altruistic maybe, like an altruistic, not profit driven benefit for our country men and women down"

"13749200","13755900"," make us, what makes us great as a country, mass transit, you get, there's a bunch of different"
"13755900","13763420"," things or improve upon or like a bullet train right across the country or something, that kind of"
"13763420","13763720"," stuff."
"13769330","13779250"," Yeah, you have to, I go to Mexico City, so you got to go there and understand the class"
"13779250","13779850"," of this. "
"13780250","13784550"," You look at like, you know, you just said these countries are trash, how about how about Amsterdam,"
"13785630","13792470"," how about always Scandinavian countries, they have huge infrastructure work projects for flooding"
"13792470","13796750"," that are amazing and those countries are not trash."
"13797430","13802830"," So we're not continuing that in our country, you understand what I'm saying?"
"13803190","13806570"," So if you're so we're going to compare grasses and you're like, yeah, Mexico, the rest of Mexico"
"13806570","13813450"," sucks, something like that, which is still not true, but we can also look at other countries like"
"13813450","13813750"," us."
"13814970","13821730"," So countries are aging out, right, like we have cycles within countries and we can see that in"
"13821730","13829870"," Europe, right, they're becoming older societies, but there are countries in Europe that also are"
"13829870","13832950"," making those infrastructure improvements so that you have a better life. "
"13833690","13838690"," You know, I really don't care what these Scandinavian countries are doing, nor do I care what"
"13838690","13846130"," Mexico is doing, I care about what we're doing for us, you and I, our children, our grandchildren,"

"13850950","13851750"," You know what I mean?"
"13854270","13855810"," Oh yeah, I know they're ahead of us."
"13857330","13861670"," Parts of Asia are ahead of us, parts of South America are ahead of us. "
"13861930","13868910"," So we can compare this to like a Mexico or parts of Asia, even to some extent, Africa."
"13870130","13871750"," You know, we want to be first nation, right?"
"13872030","13878430"," We have hegemony, right as an American and we're falling behind in that."
"13879350","13888730"," I mean, seriously, this goes down to education, this goes down to creating great engineers, great"
"13888730","13898190"," thinkers, great scientists, and continuation of that over for future generations. "
"13907390","13908690"," Yeah, it's really tough."
"13909190","13911030"," It's really tough."
"13911670","13913130"," Like I live in the mountains, right?"
"13913370","13920130"," Our roads in the mountains, like the weather there, it blows away the weather in some other states,"
"13920490","13923930"," but then you go to some states and you're like, why the fuck do we not have great roads here?"

"13925330","13928010"," It's just not, I'm like, no, no, it doesn't work for me."
"13930030","13932330"," There are other examples where we've had great infrastructure."
"13932710","13933990"," A lot of this stuff is like pork. "
"13934390","13937410"," It's legacy money."
"13937570","13938350"," We have to pay out."
"13939570","13940330"," It's jobs. "
"13945690","13949190"," You know, you want to keep people working just on different things, right?"
"13950890","13956510"," If you're going to get rid of a linesman because you're going to bury your lines, you offer them"
"13956510","13960430"," retraining and jobs and burying lines."
"13960770","13965610"," As a matter of fact, here, they're requiring us to bury our own lines to the streets."
"13966190","13969370"," So they're not even, they want us to do it, but they want us to do it. "
"13970130","13973430"," You know, I went, my house is I buy, I feel like you get to bury your lines to the"
"13973430","13973910"," street now."
"13974390","13976210"," And I'm like, that's not where the failure is."
"13976310","13977430"," The failure is not at my house. "
"13977670","13980610"," The failure is on your lines that are running up and down these back roads."
"13983470","13985750"," But even so, all this money is ours, right?"
"13986030","13987050"," Like, this is all our money."
"13987230","13988290"," This is our tax money. "
"13988630","13990710"," Like, this is all our tax money being used."
"13991430","13992470"," I don't mind our tax."
"13992750","13999390"," I'm like this old school Democrat, where, you know, I don't mind our tax dollars being collected if"
"13999390","14003330"," they're just used properly, if they're for the benefit of what we're doing. "
"14003350","14005330"," I'm actually not opposed paying the taxes."
"14005810","14008150"," I'm not opposed to increases in taxes."
"14008870","14012390"," What I get pissed about is how they're used, right?"
"14012610","14013330"," So are they wasteful?"
"14013890","14014630"," Are they grifted?"
"14015090","14019890"," Are they towards something that for the benefit and the betterment of our nation?"
"14021670","14023610"," You know what I'm saying?"
"14026950","14027490"," That's right. "
"14027630","14027770"," You do."
"14027930","14028690"," You pay the tolls."
"14031490","14032010"," That's right. "
"14032370","14033690"," You drive on these high, you drive those highways."
"14034030","14035130"," No driving at night time either."
"14035690","14037330"," Stand those fucking things during the day. "
"14042230","14043350"," So need a new high."
"14043990","14047110"," Sellers trying to step in here and tell you know, you're not getting in the middle of the"
"14047110","14047530"," afternoon."

"14049410","14050930"," It's now 202 in the afternoon."
"14052490","14053670"," Let me know what you're going to do."
"14053870","14057750"," I'm going to look for, I'm going to try, I have a stop on my calls here, but I'm still"

"15897570","15899090"," I hit the back button, this doesn't happen. "
"15899310","15900070"," I've hit the forward button."
"15900330","15901170"," This is UX stuff."
"15901990","15904790"," So look at that, look at that perfect fucking tee off right there. "
"15905490","15908470"," No, I kiss it."
"15910970","15915730"," Like when you have, so when you build something, you build tools and website, right, you've got"
"15915730","15918130"," backend development, front end development, and you got UX."
"15919250","15922650"," Yeah, we could open it right now and let you in, you'd be like, well, this doesn't work. "
"15922650","15923510"," And this isn't nice."
"15923510","15929290"," And I expanded this thing and then I went backwards and now it's all wonky across the site."
"15929590","15932270"," So some lot of moving parts of the background happening right now. "
"15935130","15936250"," Let me go potty real quick."

"15967750","15970090"," And you guys are going to have the keys, the fucking castle."
"15971710","15974730"," And do not lose those keys past those. "
"15975010","15980270"," So you're going to have to pass those keys off one day to the next generation."
"15980410","15981530"," You're going to have to do it."
"15981730","15989140"," You don't think so, but you're going to bullshit, winky. "

"15990620","15991880"," I'm strapping you to the mask, brother."
"15991980","15992620"," You ain't going nowhere. "
"15993020","15993880"," I'm fucking, I'm doing it."
"15993960","15995240"," I'm going to kidnap your ass."
"16453540","16456640"," What up, beast going on, brother?"
"16468070","16468790"," Lovey porch. "
"16474270","16475189"," Scott 64."
"16475570","16476110"," What's going on?"
"16477450","16480430"," They ever figure out, I get back to the little tweet deck."
"16480590","16481009"," No, not yet. "
"16481950","16486349"," So I tried and then I put the camera back on here."
"16487750","16489689"," But I mean, like, I got a bunch of crap."
"16489689","16492669"," I'm doing the background and it's like, dude, it's like all the stuff's like ours. "
"16493250","16501529"," Like work on tweet deck work on the work on the tool, work on, work on, I don't think it's"
"16501529","16502550"," like audio stuff."
"16502790","16506270"," Then I'm like working on other audio stuff that I'm working on, logos that are incorrect and then"
"16506270","16506770"," I'm working on."
"16508570","16512689"," Well, of course you've got people in the background that I have to talk with to make sure they're"
"16512689","16513330"," all on the same page. "
"16514090","16517029"," Make sure everybody knows that we all love each other."
"16517169","16519529"," Make sure that we all are on the same page too, right?"
"16519710","16521509"," Like, are we doing this or are we doing that?"
"16521669","16522110"," That kind of stuff."
"16522290","16523250"," Because they're a big team, right?"
"16524029","16526830"," This isn't like a, this isn't like my thing. "
"16528150","16534470"," It's like all of our all."
"16534910","16535450"," There we go."
"16537550","16538790"," There we go right there. "
"16538890","16540330"," That's the top of the world up there, baby."
"16540529","16542270"," That big black sky up there."
"16543770","16545529"," Look at that up there. "
"16547130","16549610"," Contrain it up and up and up."
"16550230","16552890"," Okay, so nothing has changed, right?"
"16553169","16554210"," You know your tools here."
"16554750","16556830"," We saw the dip by down below. "
"16558689","16560970"," Again, another dip by, right?"
"16560970","16561529"," Ping."
"16562750","16567029"," We can see, what can we, what can we divine right now, right?"
"16567210","16569310"," There you go, lines going down a little bit here, right?"
"16569490","16570230"," See that going down."
"16571430","16573270"," It's not quite going up just yet. "
"16573490","16576290"," We know that there are some sellers right here, right?"
"16576430","16576930"," We knew that earlier."
"16578230","16579450"," We're going to get rid of that now."
"16580349","16582330"," And same processes before, right?"
"16582490","16583390"," We got the dip by here. "
"16584369","16586050"," We got the new high to do over here."
"16587210","16589730"," We want to catch a new high, right?"
"16590169","16591790"," We'll just change that up to a green here."
"16593330","16596830"," You want to catch a new high, right?"
"16597009","16600390"," And you know they're going to try to sell it down on you and reverse it down to the downside"
"16600390","16600950"," too. "
"16601790","16606710"," You know that if we fail to get the new high that the run is likely over, right?"
"16606910","16609290"," You know how to do your, I taught you guys twice today."
"16610110","16615849"," Spend time with you twice today in two examples on even if you were going to get stopped out where"
"16615849","16617430"," you take the stop, right?"
"16618009","16621310"," Not on the initial roll, but that last green bar that comes up."
"16622189","16625869"," I'll tell you that two examples we spent time on that today, two examples. "
"16627570","16634450"," So that if you are going to close a long or a short where to close those longs or shorts"
"16634450","16640390"," so that you don't lose all your money and that you directionally know that it's going the other"
"16640390","16641349"," way, right?"
"16642130","16643710"," A lot of stuff to learn there, right?"
"16643890","16648270"," Do that every day over and over and over and you're going to be a winning trader."
"16649970","16651730"," You are going to be a winning trader."
"16652110","16655950"," I promise you you will be a winning trader. "
"16656810","16657630"," You will make money."
"16658470","16660169"," You can do this on any time frame."
"16660990","16666490"," If you're a swing trader, you can do the same thing that we're doing on a one minute and five"
"16666490","16673070"," minute chart on a 15 minute an hour, a day chart looking for those same bars. "
"16674189","16683869"," So all of this right here applies to a five minute, a 15 minute, a one day, a 30 minute"
"16683869","16686610"," chart, a weekly chart."
"16687970","16695640"," If you're trying to buy leaps, this all works on a weekly chart."
"16700240","16709599"," This all works on any time frame you want to trade since the beginning of the stock market, since"
"16709599","16713800"," the 1890s, 1870s, 1890s, it's worked. "
"16719360","16719860"," Oh, hold on."
"16719919","16720460"," I'm looking right now."
"16720619","16720960"," Hold on, Scott. "
"16721360","16721840"," I got to run them."
"16722220","16722380"," Hold on."
"16722740","16724000"," I'm going to bring it up right now, man. "
"16724220","16730419"," I stayed off it because it flipped me back to the..."
"16730419","16735000"," It kicked me out of the old version and then..."
"16735000","16739800"," Well, it's a service cap and take my damn money."
"16743000","16743960"," Hold on."
"16744180","16745220"," What Scott's saying, pretty easy. "
"16745380","16747099"," Settings, account, tweet tech version."
"16748200","16748680"," Hold on."
"16749779","16751720"," Settings, account, more maybe?"
"16755200","16756000"," Settings, account. "
"16756599","16757099"," What do you got there?"
"16757419","16758580"," Where'd you write that?"
"16760580","16761900"," Did you delete that just then?"
"16762700","16763220"," Oh, there you go."
"16763340","16765900"," Settings, account, tweet deck version."
"16767000","16767599"," Clicked on it. "
"16770040","16770720"," Yes, dude."
"16770840","16771800"," So it did kick me out."
"16774830","16775550"," Oh, dude. "
"16775770","16776890"," Oh, that felt so good."
"16781190","16784130"," Oh, shoot him back to my old jam here."
"16786570","16787290"," Finally. "
"16791410","16795490"," That feels so good."
"16796670","16797630"," Thank you, Scott."
"16801670","16803170"," See your dipeye right here?"
"16803430","16804970"," Are you long right now?"
"16805550","16806550"," Look at that. "
"16808650","16809670"," Perfect bounce."
"16811990","16812550"," Boom."
"16813010","16813810"," Catch a dip. "
"16814750","16816910"," Take the ride higher."
"16818090","16819850"," You know that right here is what?"
"16820390","16821910"," What else do you know here?"
"16822810","16825470"," You know the sellers are trying to try to sell this bar."
"16826470","16829150"," You know this yellow line is coming up. "
"16830550","16834790"," You know even if you catch a red bar, you know where your stops are."
"16834950","16836050"," You're raising your stops."
"16836370","16843050"," You know if you catch a red bar right here, that if it gets another green bar, where's it going?"
"16843570","16845430"," It's going fucking up. "
"16846150","16852290"," You already tested this one, right?"
"16861220","16864100"," You see the supply down here, right?"
"16864360","16864820"," You see it."
"16864920","16867500"," Watch my cursor over here on book map."
"16867660","16869120"," You see the supply right here, right?"
"16870380","16872240"," It's a little bit of supply above it, right?"
"16872460","16874400"," So you got supply right where we are. "
"16874780","16878320"," A little tiny bit."
"16878480","16881560"," These are the people that don't want you to the sellers don't want you to get the new high, right?"
"16882340","16885280"," You have another one hiding just above it right up here."
"16890010","16892510"," What do you need to do to get through these, right?"
"16892690","16895210"," You just have to stay above the yellow line, right?"
"16896210","16898170"," You stay above the yellow line. "
"16898670","16899850"," It's vertical right now."
"16901210","16902250"," You're good to go."
"16902450","16904410"," You also have this line right here, right?"
"16906190","16907470"," Bam, bam, bam. "
"16908050","16909470"," Bam, bam, bam."
"16909870","16911130"," Stop down below."
"16911610","16916290"," If you catch a red bar down, you know there's going to be another green bar up. "
"16916970","16925390"," So even if you lose this, there's always going to be another green bar up, boom, so that you can"
"16925390","16929330"," at least get out of your trade and not lose money, right?"
"16941350","16944170"," Here are some other people to follow."
"16946090","16950830"," Follow double wide cap, D-O-U-B-L-E, wide."
"16951150","16953270"," W-I-D-E, C-A-P. "
"16954330","16955670"," You want another one to follow?"
"16957870","16959270"," Follow a poly."
"16959610","16962830"," He's at S-P-Z underscore trader."
"16964350","16965070"," Follow him. "
"16978630","16980070"," Dub wide's the man."
"16994010","16996770"," What happens if we break through these two?"
"16996930","16997330"," Do you know?"
"16998070","16998990"," Do you know what happens?"
"17002230","17003670"," I'm going to warn you of something here."
"17003810","17003990"," Hold on. "
"17005590","17008070"," I'm going to warn you of something here, okay?"
"17009210","17010590"," I'm going to warn you of something."
"17010690","17011790"," I want to say I'm doing this wrong."
"17013310","17014590"," I'm going to warn you of something. "
"17015730","17020350"," Raise your stops as we go along here, okay?"
"17022010","17023810"," So there's no market above."
"17023990","17025030"," Watch my cursor up here."
"17025170","17026170"," There's no market up there. "
"17027010","17028350"," I'm going to see this, okay?"
"17029070","17031030"," There's that supply up here."
"17031030","17031850"," We can get there."
"17034410","17037310"," Then I want you to put your stops on right where we are, okay?"
"17038150","17044190"," I want you to like, as we come up, you can take profit in here and you can trade this"
"17044190","17048510"," leg up and you can trade this leg up, but I want to talk to you about this. "
"17050310","17052410"," I'm going to show you something here, okay?"
"17054170","17062910"," So as we come up here, you're going to take the money and run, take the money and run, take"
"17062910","17063690"," the money and run."
"17064490","17069710"," If you're already long from down here, the big move, right?"
"17070490","17072750"," Raise your stops up as we go along."
"17073030","17074450"," Do you make myself clear here?"
"17075090","17082910"," Because if it does roll over on you at any point, now you're going to be glad that you took"
"17082910","17083650"," the money and ran. "
"17135130","17137890"," Just keep on, put the pain trade on, baby."
"17138530","17142950"," Put that pain trade on, put that pain trade on."
"17145350","17152730"," Can you imagine like just being short from like two days ago and you just have to buy the market. "
"17152890","17153430"," You don't have a choice."
"17155530","17158590"," You have no choice but to buy this market."
"17162980","17164460"," Hey, thanks, Dibang, anyone. "
"17164640","17165280"," I appreciate that."
"17168810","17169970"," I appreciate that."
"17170090","17170810"," Shout out, Dibang. "
"17173430","17174570"," No, God, no."
"17175150","17175890"," No, I'm not short."
"17176550","17176990"," Fuck, no. "
"17178370","17179770"," I'm hedging all the way up."
"17181550","17184750"," I'm long this market in a big way, major long."
"17186010","17188090"," I'm long serious, like serious money. "
"17188290","17190630"," I'm long fucking like underlying stock."
"17191890","17194010"," I'm slamming zero to eight calls in size."
"17203070","17204370"," Yeah, no, I'm not short. "
"17204750","17205270"," No, no way."
"17205390","17206510"," Save a form short this market."
"17208570","17217200"," Yeah, we're probably getting this today. "
"17217400","17219040"," This R3, we're probably going to nail this today."
"17219240","17219800"," I think we are."
"17220480","17224500"," I'm not sure, but today or tomorrow we're going to nail this. "
"17225120","17234300"," I want to see like, I want to see like 50, that 53 or 56 or something tomorrow if possible."
"17243120","17244940"," Yeah, we have no elevator to hell here."
"17245200","17246700"," There's no elevator to hell here. "
"17248040","17253420"," We're going to pain trade this until every last one of those fucking puts out goes to die."
"17254260","17257120"," What about those puts yesterday is because they're cheap, 10 cents."
"17257500","17258700"," There's no reason not to buy them. "
"17258840","17263840"," So the idea here is that we think we go over this every day, right?"
"17264160","17269960"," Like, if I get a, if they got to pay 60 cents for some calls, I'm expecting those calls to"
"17269960","17271860"," go to two dollars, three dollars."
"17272260","17275020"," So buy like 10 cents puts part of doing business."
"17275120","17275640"," That's it. "
"17281690","17284870"," Yeah, there's no, I want you to know there's no elevator to hell here."
"17284870","17285410"," There's none."
"17286950","17288790"," There is no elevator to hell here. "
"17292330","17293450"," Not that I can see."
"17296750","17298550"," That's why puts are 10 cents."
"17298810","17300670"," You buy them as a hedge, that's it. "
"17301950","17310790"," Yeah, there's no elevator to hell here."
"17310790","17311250"," There's none."
"17312010","17313270"," You could have had an elevator. "
"17313710","17316090"," There was like a chance for an elevator to hell."
"17317870","17326590"," There was a chance on that swing high on, there was a chance on the swing high on the"
"17326590","17332550"," CPI news to swing low, but that should ain't happening."
"17333310","17336390"," You could see it in the close yesterday, right around four o'clock in the afternoon. "
"17337370","17340890"," Matter of fact, Jedi Marcus, I noticed it at four."
"17341110","17342630"," We were on stream at four o'clock still yesterday."
"17342990","17344970"," I'm like, I'm like, you see what these fucking guys are doing?"
"17345090","17346290"," It's like guys, it's algorithms. "
"17347030","17350450"," When I saw Jedi made a post yesterday about hell and hell nine thousand."
"17350450","17354350"," And I was like, dude, they are fucking out right now buying it all."
"17355190","17360410"," Another key indicator to this was, did you guys notice remember early streams of the week?"
"17361110","17370790"," We were watching huge call options, closing in the money, like 700,000 call"
"17370790","17371230"," options. "
"17371950","17375410"," When you see that shit, you know they're buying the market, right?"
"17376890","17379250"," They're long the market there."
"17379450","17383830"," They want to get paid on those underlying closing."
"17384230","17386330"," They're not closing that shit so they're not making money. "
"17386770","17388350"," Closing that shit in the money."
"17388630","17394510"," Like you rarely see puts high concentration of puts and calls close in the money."
"17394730","17398010"," So when you see it, you're like, oh, dude, they want to own this. "
"17399670","17400550"," You hear what I'm saying?"
"17400710","17401450"," They'll take them off."
"17401750","17403930"," Like these algorithms are literally like take these things off."
"17404310","17406470"," They're like 350, 355, 359. "
"17407450","17409430"," They were closing these things in the money."
"17409430","17411390"," Like, I don't care if I own this right now."
"17412310","17419890"," That's like showing you that people are saying, I've got a fucking $500 million on this close that"
"17419890","17420810"," we're going up tomorrow. "
"17423570","17426430"," Trading 449, 28 right now."
"17426950","17429610"," I'm gonna keep my fucking steady hand in this shit."
"17434230","17435870"," Yeah, you saw that yesterday, right?"
"17436150","17440010"," I made a comment or I think I posted two comments to him. "
"17440710","17442470"," I was like, did you see that fucking close?"

"18744080","18746160"," Anyone that's been here is the beginning nose of the song."
"18747120","18748160"," Haven't played it in a while."
"18756290","18757270"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"18757410","18758570"," That's what I'm wondering right here."
"18758650","18761250"," So I just be done like this is so fucking ridiculous."
"18762190","18764270"," I haven't bought another set yet. "
"18764430","18765810"," I'm waiting just a few minutes."
"18765990","18776400"," I might join him again, but we got"
"18776400","18780520"," want to buy that right there."
"18780520","18782560"," That red candle is so fucking bad right now. "
"18782640","18784380"," Like I want to buy that so bad."
"18785380","18787380"," This one's straight gambling comes in."
"18793510","18794270"," All right. "
"18794410","18794650"," Fuck it."
"18794730","18795150"," We'll buy it."
"18795690","18796130"," All right. "
"18796290","18799650"," I had it at 25, but I'm just going to do 10."
"18799810","18801970"," I'm just going to do we're going to do shits and giggles."
"18803590","18808150"," I want to do I'm going to do I got an ordering right now. "
"18808370","18809090"," Shits and giggles."
"18813290","18814550"," Just shits and giggles."
"18814550","18815930"," I'm probably going to lose this trade. "
"18815930","18818470"," So don't don't be like, oh, cap lost the trade."
"18819270","18821790"," This is like buy one contract or something."
"18822410","18826910"," Buy like, I don't know if you trade for any contracts, throw 30 on or something. "
"18831110","18833650"," And I'm going to probably leave these on the bell."
"18833650","18834270"," So we'll see."
"18837050","18845590"," This is a lot of polotos. "
"18845610","18846470"," This means nothing."
"18847070","18848610"," It's just lotos."
"18849710","18852310"," If you're if you're like, life depends on the straight. "
"18852550","18853290"," Do not take it."
"18857790","18859990"," If you're playing with house money, you want to."
"18861510","18870610"," Yeah, we're going to watch that after the belt today, Uncle J."
"18870690","18870730"," B."
"18870730","18870990"," J."
"18872850","18873870"," Oh, yeah, they're going to try to fuck. "
"18874010","18874630"," They're going to have to do this."
"18874750","18876650"," The algos are pissed right now."
"18882230","18884750"," We're playing a fire in our pissing off the algos here. "
"18893130","18895370"," We're poking the computer in the butt right now."
"18895590","18895890"," It's mad."
"18902120","18903920"," At least feels good to be long here. "
"18904080","18904540"," It feels good."
"18904800","18911890"," So Oh, man."
"18912110","18914550"," So you're same thing looking for a failure above at our three. "
"18915030","18917030"," They're going to try to roll this back down on you."
"18917910","18920570"," I need the new high for bullish for tomorrow."
"18920970","18921590"," Look at that shit. "
"18924030","18926370"," You're going to need, you know, this to come up."
"18927190","18929230"," You know, sellers are going to step in right here."
"18930290","18931510"," So I want to show you where they are. "
"18931810","18932550"," They're right here."
"18934850","18935990"," They're right here."
"18937150","18945710"," They're going to try to sell this 449.81, but you're going to hope for a break above, or not"
"18945710","18946670"," a break above, but a candle. "
"18947630","18949290"," And then you can help for a red candle."
"18950570","18952490"," It could be a quick red one."
"18952830","18955030"," Could be a big red one to right there. "
"18957430","18960950"," Then you get your actual trade higher right there."
"18966310","18967530"," They might do it right away."
"18967710","18968850"," Just might smash it up there. "
"18971810","18974690"," I just want to go and I want to go and Twitter so bad."
"18975210","18975910"," Well, look at them."
"18975970","18976850"," They're just like, fuck you. "
"18976950","18977690"," You're not going up there."
"18980390","18983470"," I want to go and Twitter so bad and do PT three hit."
"18983730","18985130"," We're so close to it, man. "
"18985170","18986490"," Like, what is that?"
"18986770","18988110"," Pennies 14 cents."
"18988770","18990090"," Give me 14 cents, dude."
"18991270","18993690"," Give me 14 cents for price target three. "

"19242110","19245490"," Do you guys remember October the morning of October of 12 or something?"
"19246210","19249410"," And I was screaming on fintuit and had a meltdown on my stream."
"19251870","19253190"," I like had a meltdown."
"19253890","19255910"," I was like, you buy this fucking dip here. "
"19256410","19260630"," Do you guys remember when I posted that shit in Peru came after me when I hit when I had"
"19260630","19263570"," the baseball bat pointing to the fucking upside?"
"19264430","19267750"," Remember the arrow fucking post that this is where you are at the bottom?"
"19268130","19269690"," Do you guys remember all that shit?"
"19274170","19280650"," Like there are some big accounts out there coming after me big ones, big big bears."
"19282410","19286570"," Oh, don't do it."
"19286790","19287670"," Just give me up there. "
"19287790","19288550"," Don't throw it down."
"19290070","19294770"," There's a hedge fund right now watching this like, don't let this guy get that tag."
"19299790","19301310"," You guys remember all that shit?"
"19301450","19301970"," Some of you remember. "
"19305110","19306390"," Yeah, I can accept it."
"19306890","19308370"," Give me two seconds here."
"19308750","19311470"," We accept them in the morning at 8 a.m. but I'll do it right now. "
"19311970","19313010"," I'll do it right now for you."
"19313070","19318410"," Give me two seconds and I will I will I'll flip my account over and I'll accept it right now."

"19324770","19326350"," Let's give him and get that tag up there."
"19326450","19327710"," That's just that one last little tag. "
"19328910","19332870"," That one last little tiny touch that that chef's kiss."
"19333290","19336170"," How do you do that chef's kiss if we're gonna do it?"
"19337730","19339730"," We're gonna do that chef's kiss thing up here."
"19341530","19347050"," Like it's to come here or whatever it's called. "
"19354670","19364570"," Oh, my thing's not allowing me to"
"19364570","19364910"," do this."
"19365030","19365510"," I don't know why."
"19365690","19369090"," Twitter's not allowing me in this thing to do the hand pump. "
"19369270","19369630"," I don't know why."
"19370810","19371450"," That's okay."
"19371530","19372070"," I don't need to do that. "
"19372610","19373590"," Fuck it."
"19375590","19382490"," Oh, 450 C's trading 25 cents right now."
"19383350","19387810"," 450 C's trading 25 cents right now. "
"19391470","19393110"," Baby."
"19395870","19398230"," Oh, baby."
"19398230","19405200"," Give me that one last green bar up there. "
"19406240","19407560"," Push it up there."
"19411180","19417840"," Give me that 450.04. Give me the last 13 cents."
"19437040","19438020"," Oh, come on. "
"19443670","19445670"," Come on, keep going."
"19453630","19457810"," I was on by another pack and I'm like, I got to switch over to sell when it tags that"
"19457810","19458510"," PT3."
"19459650","19461870"," Trying to sell this yellow line right here. "
"19462290","19463690"," Trying to sell that one right there."
"19470280","19472160"," Oh, come on."
"19472920","19473820"," You suck. "
"19479110","19480090"," God damn it."
"19485980","19486800"," Doesn't want to lie."
"19486940","19488640"," It doesn't want to give me the 04, does it?"
"19492040","19493640"," It doesn't want to give me the 04. "
"19506360","19508800"," Oh, try not to give me the 04."
"19513680","19515020"," I'm still I'm not selling these."
"19515120","19515820"," These are a lot of those. "
"19515820","19516780"," I'm not selling any of this shit."
"19520080","19520740"," I bought it."
"19520740","19522920"," I bought down here at 449. "
"19523280","19524720"," I bought this one right here."
"19524820","19529180"," 449.58. I bought."
"19529300","19530240"," I'll say where I bought. "
"19532580","19534040"," I think right here, I bought."
"19542210","19547410"," Oh, dude, it's it's like a thirst trap."
"19549090","19551510"," It's like a total thirst, thirst trap up here. "
"19551550","19553550"," Like this one right here is the big bad boy."
"19555130","19557230"," That one right there, 454."
"19560330","19561970"," Doesn't want to fucking print it. "
"19562310","19563330"," God damn it."
"19569970","19571710"," Ask if you should buy here."
"19574030","19575130"," Should you buy here?"
"19575390","19577250"," If you buy here, it's a lot of trade. "
"19577750","19580510"," So I don't know if your account is a billion dollars."
"19580590","19581210"," Yeah, buy there."
"19581310","19585770"," If your account is $1,000, you can spend $25. "
"19586150","19586610"," How about that?"
"19589070","19589870"," Or $15."
"19594090","19596250"," I wouldn't be buying here to try to make money."
"19596370","19599990"," If you like it for just a lot of, they can do like for the for the shits and giggles,"
"19599990","19601470"," you can buy this. "
"19601470","19614880"," But this is not the place to"
"19614880","19620320"," be I'm looking for after the bell for a trade and we'll take a look peek at that."
"19620760","19625480"," Well, as we close the market here, we'll take a look between 4 and 4.15. I looked earlier with"
"19625480","19625840"," you guys."
"19626040","19629240"," We're going to look again and see if there's a trade for tomorrow. "
"19630100","19631960"," We talk about these trades every day."
"19632000","19635060"," Remember, we talked about with Joe Harper the other day and Chaz, right?"
"19636340","19638500"," We said, here are some 10 cent puts."
"19638980","19641480"," You marry those with some 67 cent calls. "
"19642360","19647840"," Remember, we said, remember the other day, we said, where I was, I think the calls were 89 cents."
"19648040","19652840"," And I said, yeah, you wait till like 4.15. You buy some 10 cent puts."
"19652920","19656080"," You buy some calls at 4.15 to get them as cheap as possible. "
"19656820","19658380"," You do a quick little strangle."
"19658780","19664760"," Puts are so fucking cheap here that it makes sense to like if you're like a trade experience,"
"19664760","19669740"," people like come by number one, I hate buying expensive calls, but say I'm buying an expensive call"
"19669740","19672420"," and they're 67 cents, 89 cents."
"19673580","19678640"," Who the fuck is getting into a trade for 89 cents and expecting it to print 90 cents?"
"19679140","19679740"," Nobody. "
"19680620","19690040"," You're putting risk on to print a dollar 80, $2.80. So if they're going to charge you 89"
"19690040","19692740"," cents for a call for tomorrow, right?"
"19693700","19695820"," And you see a put for 10 cents."
"19697300","19702160"," You'd be out of your mind not to buy both."
"19703060","19704080"," Does it make sense?"
"19704760","19713660"," No one's buying an 89 cent call or 67 cent call and expecting 10 cent. "
"19713860","19721080"," If you do that as a trader, if you're like, I'm buying an overnight zero date for 80 cents and"
"19721080","19724500"," you're expecting to make 10 cents, you're out of your fucking mind."
"19725360","19733080"," That is a high risk trade that's that's almost guaranteed to fail, right?"
"19733400","19734180"," Almost guaranteed."
"19735360","19741080"," So your expectation is that it's going to go and print you if you're holding the zero date over and"
"19741080","19746120"," I'm going to tell you some, if you're holding the zero date overnight, yeah, you might be able to"
"19746120","19750760"," take 30% or 10% but I'm telling you what, you ain't taking those trades for that. "
"19751100","19753320"," Taking those trades for a gap the fuck up."
"19754580","19758360"," You're taking those trades so that you can make two or three hundred percent."
"19758720","19760900"," You might not always win, but that's what you're trying for. "
"19761620","19769000"," That is the agreement when you take a zero date, not a weekly, not a monthly, talking about an"
"19769000","19770500"," overnight directional trade."
"19771300","19774860"," You're looking for two, three hundred percent, hundred percent, two hundred, three hundred, hundred"
"19774860","19775140"," minimum."
"19776260","19783480"," So if that call is going to cost you premium and if you're going to put it worthless and let's"
"19783480","19784140"," say you lose. "
"19784700","19788960"," So I'm now spending big money, spending 80 cents on a call for tomorrow, right?"
"19790780","19793380"," And there's a high probability of that call burning."
"19794300","19799980"," Why would I not add another 10 cent trade against it as an insurance policy?"
"19800580","19801060"," Does that make sense?"
"19801840","19803520"," Especially on news driven stuff."
"19803520","19806140"," So it was just as easy on CPI. "
"19807420","19811480"," We knew it was going to go up, but we also know that it's just as easy to sell the"
"19811480","19820460"," news, slam to the depths of how open that market and that 67 cent call goes to what, zero to"
"19820460","19820860"," or not zero."
"19821100","19830740"," It probably goes like 10 or 20 and your 10 cent put goes to 40 or 50"
"19830740","19831180"," cents."
"19831180","19838440"," So you lost the trade in the overnight and you paid for the chance to play. "
"19838780","19839440"," Does that make sense?"
"19840080","19848980"," You had a chance to play the market almost free, literally almost no downside risk."
"19849280","19849920"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"19850540","19856240"," I'm putting risk on on zero dates on an overnight trade with a dirt cheap hedge to the downside."
"19857000","19858600"," So I win either way. "
"19858840","19867140"," I'm breaking even or I'm losing booking 10 cents, five cents with the chance of tripling or"
"19867140","19870660"," doubling or 100%ing my money."
"19871700","19875660"," Trading 26 cents right now on my calls."
"19878830","19879970"," Who do you love?"
"19883470","19884710"," Who do you love?"
"19895840","19913000"," Who"
"19913000","19923740"," do"
"19923740","19925820"," you love?"
"19926700","19928500"," Can I get four pennies please?"

"19974480","19975680"," We are right now. "
"19975800","19976380"," It's top of the world."
"19976600","19977680"," So be really careful."
"19977800","19978120"," See it?"
"19979640","19980040"," Focus. "

"20142080","20145680"," of you out there have told me that you don't pay for memberships. "
"20146560","20148760"," You pay on, you pay on, what do you say?"
"20148860","20149820"," What do you guys say out there to me?"
"20150780","20150780"," Performance."
"20153560","20154160"," Right?"
"20154460","20155640"," There's your performance."
"20157700","20162400"," There's your performance, trading for fifty thirty four. "
"20165200","20166820"," There's a donate button."
"20167520","20170440"," Thanks for saying something about that for asking for a donate button."
"20170700","20171140"," There it is. "
"20171220","20171740"," I just gave one."
"20172300","20178520"," David, my brother AMS. I love you, my brother. "
"20179620","20185260"," I love you, David AMS. I love you, my man."
"20185460","20189040"," Thank you very much, David, for what you do inside of Discord, my brother. "
"20189780","20191500"," I fucking love you."
"20191500","20199220"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"20202090","20205650"," Tap bot 449 C's. "
"20207310","20211410"," What are 449 C's trading right now?"
"20213470","20216810"," Only $1.29. They're 18 cents though, weren't they?"
"20217550","20219370"," It's a 500% trade."
"20219610","20221990"," If you held those to this point."
"20228760","20230560"," I love all of you out there. "
"20233080","20234920"," Love all of you out there."
"20236920","20237320"," Boom."
"20239440","20241260"," 500% ringer. "
"20241700","20242320"," David, my brother."
"20242560","20243140"," I love you, man."
"20244720","20245980"," I want you to know that, dude. "
"20246140","20248080"," It's like you guys wanted David's story."
"20248280","20249080"," I was trading with David."
"20249320","20251080"," I'd be waking up, David would be going to bed. "
"20252800","20256660"," And David, I'd be like, what happened overnight, man?"
"20256880","20258100"," He'd like, give me the down low."
"20260460","20263980"," And then I'd be like, exiting the day and David would be like, what happened today?"
"20263980","20265400"," And I'd be like, this is what's going on."
"20266120","20268600"," And so he'd trade the night and I'd trade the day. "
"20270060","20274780"," And then I sent him when I started the Discord, I sent him an email or DM or an email"
"20274780","20280440"," and I was like, hey, man, if you please, if you ever can reach out, like this guy is like"
"20280440","20281380"," a master."
"20282120","20284460"," And he's a fucking baller."
"20284460","20288560"," And months later, he saw my DM and responded and I didn't see it. "
"20289240","20294220"," It's like months past and I had talked to some people and I was like, this guy ever fucking re "
"20294220","20294980","-contacts me."
"20295100","20297860"," And then like months past, he had contacted me."
"20299320","20305820"," And lo and behold, we had missed months of having him inside the Discord. "
"20306700","20308460"," And he trades Globex."
"20309060","20315300"," So if you're a futures trader, if you like, if you're a prop trader, if you're a futures Globex,"
"20315420","20320660"," any of that stuff, if you're trading outside of the country, check out our Globex futures room."
"20323340","20324420"," I love you too, Ryan. "
"20325660","20326940"," I love you, David, my brother."
"20327760","20329360"," I hope your mom is doing well, my brother."
"20332820","20333520"," Yeah, it's tough. "
"20333660","20334960"," Yeah, you're out there there, Maui, right?"
"20335860","20337800"," Even if you just check in with him."
"20337800","20341700"," So my point to you is this, a further point."
"20342060","20346880"," If you just wake up in the morning at one, two, three, four, five in the morning, Eastern Standard"
"20346880","20349180"," Time, he's in there. "
"20350300","20351800"," You're like, hey, David, what's going on, man?"
"20351960","20352680"," You wrapping up your night?"
"20353880","20355340"," You know, what were your thoughts on the overnight?"
"20355580","20356440"," What's your thoughts on tomorrow?"
"20357060","20359560"," And he just drops knowledge on people."
"20366300","20367780"," Better times ahead, my man."
"20368040","20368380"," Definitely. "
"20374030","20375830"," Dude, unreal right now."
"20378850","20384810"," Coming back down on the 27 EMA on the one minute chart right here, we're going to check it one"
"20384810","20385290"," more time."
"20386030","20389830"," Is there a higher move into this close to 450, 158?"
"20390630","20392430"," We already talked about what to expect for tomorrow. "
"20392830","20394530"," We're going to talk about that right now, though."
"20394970","20397330"," Again, we're going to go over it one more time for tomorrow."
"20397810","20406070"," So for tomorrow, your expected low is 448 for tomorrow. "
"20406150","20406630"," Okay."
"20407670","20409070"," That was a five minute chart."
"20409290","20414370"," If I were to buy tomorrow, big old, big old five minute reversal candles called a tweezer. "
"20414590","20417710"," If you don't know what that is right there, big green candle, big red reversal."
"20418710","20421470"," If you're looking for a dip to buy, you know where it is, right?"
"20421710","20422350"," It's right here."
"20423170","20424230"," 449, 37. "
"20425190","20426910"," So two places for you."
"20427090","20429690"," If you're trying to buy a dip for tomorrow, we're going to be two spots."
"20430790","20432170"," It's going to be right in here. "
"20432790","20438630"," If you can get it at 415 this afternoon, if you want to put some risk on, it's likely going"
"20438630","20441830"," to be right here."
"20442490","20443250"," See that right there?"
"20444070","20448630"," So try like 449, 81, somewhere in here by trying to buy this dip."
"20449270","20450350"," See it right there?"
"20451250","20460110"," If you're like me and you're cheap, there's a possibility of one more dip buy down here at 448, 448"
"20460110","20463150"," for Friday. "
"20463950","20470230"," Remember that we have two places here to put some risk on, one right here and one right here."
"20470590","20471430"," Okay, for tomorrow."
"20471570","20474630"," Now this green box is lower right now. "
"20474630","20478910"," It's actually down here somewhere, but it's going to move up in the overnight."
"20479350","20481490"," So if you're a futures trader, keep an eye on that."
"20482090","20483170"," I'm going to give you some ES targets. "
"20483890","20485470"," CNN's David is here."
"20486010","20488790"," I'm going to shout out some numbers for David here."
"20490510","20500410"," So ES, the mini by morning, or right now, 45, 21, 50, likely a dip by 45, 32. "
"20500830","20503830"," If you're trading and Q, he likes to trade and Q."
"20504010","20504610"," I know that too."
"20506470","20509630"," You're probably looking for a, I don't think you're going to get the pullback."
"20509670","20513150"," I think you're getting a fucking gap up here on NQ and all of it. "
"20513250","20514170"," I think we're going to gap up overnight."
"20514550","20520930"," But if you get a pullback, you're looking to probably buy by morning, 4 a.m. you're looking to buy"
"20520930","20527650"," 15, 600.25. But I think there's a risk, a gap up risk into tomorrow."
"20528170","20533510"," So if you're a dip buyer looking for a dip by for tomorrow, I gave you two. "
"20534270","20538010"," First one, 449, 42, second one, 448, for tomorrow."
"20538770","20541170"," Expectations for tomorrow."
"20542730","20545230"," Dip to be bought, dip to be bought. "
"20545550","20547570"," What are the price targets to the upside for tomorrow?"
"20548630","20558950"," 451, 58, and 455, 20, 455, 20."
"20559310","20560690"," I have some higher targets."
"20561130","20562890"," Let me go look for another chart here. "
"20562990","20563350"," Let me go look."
"20565730","20567070"," Let's start putting them up there."
"20567850","20568650"," You ready for them?"
"20569350","20572370"," I got a 455, 16, not 20. "
"20572730","20574950"," So my target tomorrow is not there."
"20575190","20578730"," It's a 455, 16, a little bit lower."
"20580090","20581110"," So right right there. "
"20581290","20582450"," And then we've got above that."
"20582570","20584230"," We've got 460, 43."
"20586910","20587730"," Right there. "
"20588810","20590950"," 460, 43."
"20592150","20595290"," There is gap up risk for tomorrow."
"20596030","20597130"," Fridays are weird. "
"20598310","20599750"," Fridays are a weird thing."
"20599910","20602170"," You can come into a front like for right now for Fridays."
"20602750","20605250"," We can easily on a Friday, right?"
"20605450","20607070"," For zero date, tech Friday. "
"20607450","20608290"," I'm going to tell you something else."
"20608290","20609990"," We're not going to start off the stream right now."
"20610610","20612110"," It's an important information for you. "
"20613610","20621050"," Tomorrow is zero date Friday for a lot of your spec growth tickers like AMC and GME and FSR and"
"20621050","20621690"," all these other ones."
"20622330","20624070"," They're primed and lubed."
"20624590","20626930"," A lot of these tickers do not have zero dates. "
"20627710","20629910"," You're going to see people come out and try to trade that."
"20630190","20633110"," On a Friday, two things can happen in this environment."
"20634030","20640470"," We can gap this the fuck up and sell it down where we can roll it and go boom up"
"20640470","20640930"," here tomorrow. "
"20641570","20644930"," So start to thicken your head."
"20645050","20646310"," Yeah, I want to put some risk on here."
"20646390","20647350"," I want to put some risk on there. "
"20647410","20648190"," So how do you do that?"
"20648630","20653150"," The first thing that you do is you the first thing that you're doing for tomorrow is you're looking"
"20653150","20655530"," for an upside gap up, right?"
"20656290","20659930"," Some upside gap up at $4.49, $4.48, right?"
"20660350","20669010"," A trade that's outside the money like $4.55. And then you're looking to add on that"
"20669010","20675670"," a downside target with puts $4.48. Makes sense?"
"20676350","20678070"," Find out what that costs haven't looked yet."
"20678710","20687070"," You can even go lower and make them crash puts $4.45, maybe $4.46. So if we do roll"
"20687070","20691070"," it down, you at least can pay for that risk that you put on for that trade."
"20691810","20692430"," Get me?"
"20693170","20696710"," So at least you can at least put the risk on for the trade tomorrow. "
"20697190","20701730"," Now if this trade burns tomorrow, you're only down 10 cents, 20 cents."
"20702290","20704830"," You're going to collect a little bit off the puts, right?"
"20705070","20708010"," And you're going to pay for the risk that you put on up here, right?"
"20708590","20714830"," Just but even if we burn, if we get down here tomorrow, you're going to look for a trade higher,"
"20715590","20715730"," right?"
"20715830","20718630"," So we're going to look for a dip by tomorrow in stream."
"20718950","20720010"," Does that make sense to you?"
"20720490","20722050"," Is that logical to you?"
"20722710","20723810"," You guys get what I'm saying. "
"20724270","20732550"," So your original trade is an upside move, OTM 455C, some protection to the downside, a strangle of"
"20732550","20732770"," sorts."
"20733690","20740650"," And then you're also looking for if it fails to buy a dip tomorrow on Friday for zero to eight"
"20740650","20741370"," tech Fridays."
"20742110","20743870"," So where are we looking for here, right?"
"20744230","20749970"," Maybe you put the puts on up here and then by 415, you put the calls on right by some"
"20749970","20754350"," cheap puts for your strangle as we can into 415. "
"20755190","20762790"," That's that's kind of exaggerated coming to 415 and you buy some calls for your upside target."
"20763070","20765290"," You got a little bit of a discount on the call on the puts."
"20765490","20766830"," You get a little bit of a discount on the calls. "
"20767250","20768890"," You got a strangle going for tomorrow."
"20768950","20771110"," You don't care where we go at that point to you."
"20771530","20773550"," You have to manage that trade though. "
"20773730","20774790"," This is not financial advice."
"20775150","20776450"," I'm not saying you should do this."
"20777190","20778550"," I was asked what I would do. "
"20779650","20781990"," So I want you to know that I'm not telling you to take this trade."
"20782610","20786790"," I'm telling you that this is what I would do for a trade to the upside."
"20787530","20788850"," I put my put side on first. "
"20789070","20792130"," I put my call side on second and I let it ride."
"20793450","20796590"," Now I want you to know this is not financial advice."
"20796610","20803110"," You should always go to a financial advisor to make any trades in this market. "
"20803410","20805630"," And I don't know what your situation is."
"20805970","20807550"," I don't know how much money you have."
"20807750","20814510"," I don't know if you're spending $100 and you're a millionaire or if you're $300, $300 and you're"
"20814510","20817950"," spending $300 and you're not going to buy milk for your kids tomorrow. "
"20818490","20819650"," Don't ever listen to what I say."
"20820130","20823350"," If you look down inside the boxes down there, what does that say right there?"
"20823970","20827290"," This broadcast is for entertainment purposes only."
"20827950","20830530"," This is not for you to be doing shit. "
"20830810","20833950"," If you want to do trading like this, paper trade it."
"20835410","20836070"," Educate yourself."
"20837050","20839530"," Then go to the discord, right?"
"20839810","20841050"," Hook up with those guys, get some education. "
"20841390","20842590"," Then go back to your financial advisor."
"20843570","20845030"," Say, hey, I've been learning all this stuff."
"20845150","20845890"," I want to start trading. "
"20846110","20846570"," What are your thoughts?"
"20848590","20849490"," You know what I'm saying?"
"20850930","20852590"," So not financial advice."
"20853830","20859330"," You will lose all of your money if you follow me trading all of it every last dollar."
"20860110","20860830"," That's not true. "
"20860930","20863130"," A whole ton of you guys fade me and get fucked up."
"20864330","20867650"," So right down in here, this is your first buy into the clothes."
"20867850","20870350"," You might be thinking to yourself, what if we hit this cap before the clothes?"
"20871150","20872270"," I would still wait. "
"20872550","20873030"," You know why?"
"20873610","20881690"," I like to wait for when the volume leaves the market to grab some of those zero dates for the"
"20881690","20882270"," upside move."
"20883450","20885190"," There's less demand, right?"
"20885970","20887210"," Nobody to buy those calls."
"20887630","20888570"," Nobody to sell those calls. "
"20889130","20890470"," It's a little bit of a chance down here."
"20890570","20891150"," We can grab something."
"20891390","20893190"," Now, if you want to put yours on, you say, fuck a cap. "
"20893650","20894310"," I'm already in."
"20894450","20894910"," I get that."
"20895030","20895670"," That's your choice. "
"20896830","20900310"," My recommendation, don't ever follow me on trades ever."
"20901550","20903470"," I don't know your financial situation."
"20903910","20905450"," I don't know your education level. "
"20905590","20907750"," I don't know how much money you make."
"20908050","20908470"," I don't know."
"20908750","20909590"," There's so many parameters. "
"20910530","20912870"," I don't know if you know how to manage a strangle."
"20913570","20914870"," I want to say so much strangles, too."
"20915250","20916590"," They're not complicated. "
"20917050","20917950"," They're very emotional."
"20918850","20921190"," Like you hit one side, take the money."
"20921550","20923250"," The other side, wait, did you take too early?"
"20923410","20924550"," Take it too late?"
"20925430","20926250"," Did you not?"
"20926630","20928370"," Did you get panic on one side or the other?"
"20928630","20930790"," Did you leave the other side on as a lotto ticket?"
"20931350","20933270"," Did you fade your own trade the next day?"
"20933310","20934890"," There's a lot of ramifications to these trades. "
"20935750","20941370"," Please, please, if you don't understand what I'm talking about, do something else."
"20941970","20944590"," If this is just fun for you to watch every day, great."
"20947550","20952130"," Yeah, entertain, man. "
"20952390","20953350"," It's all entertainment here."
"20953530","20957810"," So there's a one minute chart right here."
"20959030","20961210"," Getting a little bit of a bear cross right here. "
"20961530","20962530"," We broke below."
"20963470","20964770"," We are bearish right now."
"20964990","20965810"," So just be careful. "
"20965930","20967150"," We are bearish heading into this close."
"20969150","20970570"," We are bearish."
"20970630","20974190"," See the price for the first time has broken below the white line, right?"
"20974430","20977690"," So we are kind of bearish here. "
"20977850","20978670"," We're not bullish."
"20979630","20981650"," Looking for a little rejection down here."
"20988430","20989850"," Do I think we're close to topping?"
"20990010","20991290"," Fuck yeah, we're topping right now, man. "
"20991430","20991970"," This is the topping."
"20992290","20995910"," This is the topping pattern in this run."
"20996290","20997270"," I should clarify that. "
"20997370","20997750"," Good question."
"20997750","21001230"," Uh, man under Bassra."
"21001410","21002430"," Two points to you. "
"21003450","21007510"," Uh, we are in a topping for now pattern."
"21008050","21009710"," So we're trying to top this out."
"21009910","21011210"," We're coming into earning season. "
"21011890","21015110"," They're going to park this market and price in good Ears."
"21015750","21017690"," Well, you know, they're going to price in good Ears here."
"21018250","21023350"," So in this topping pattern, if you're asking me if we have topped, fuck, no. "
"21024210","21024410"," What?"
"21024490","21024670"," What?"
"21024810","21026830"," How about this, uh, manager?"
"21027610","21028390"," Are you asking me?"
"21028990","21029870"," Has the market topped?"
"21030230","21031270"," Has this run topped?"
"21032190","21033210"," Has trend topped?"
"21033530","21035290"," I can answer that for you easily."
"21036250","21036830"," I'll tell you right now."
"21036850","21037370"," You want me to tell you?"
"21037750","21040710"," I'll show it to you right now before you even close the good question, brother. "
"21041610","21042990"," Are we topped right now?"
"21043270","21043370"," No."
"21044270","21044510"," Ready?"
"21044510","21050420"," Do we do this shit every day, don't we?"
"21050540","21050900"," You ready?"
"21051660","21053020"," Are we bearish here?"
"21053620","21054000"," No."
"21054960","21056580"," Has price, this is SPX. "
"21057220","21060560"," Has price broken below 43 75.2?"
"21061100","21061420"," No."
"21062240","21066240"," Has price broken below, uh, 41 71 36?"
"21067220","21067220"," No."
"21067640","21068640"," So we're not bearish. "
"21069180","21072120"," The market's not bearish for our trend."
"21072540","21075860"," Has price broken below for major weekly trend bearish yet?"
"21076200","21076760"," No."
"21077500","21084860"," We need to be below 47 42 70 48 for a major weekly trend change on a one-hour chart. "
"21085840","21088140"," Have we broken below 4400 yet?"
"21088560","21089160"," No."
"21089520","21090660"," So we're not bearish yet."
"21091020","21091560"," Right?"
"21092000","21094820"," We haven't even topped yet on a 15-minute chart. "
"21095420","21102060"," Have we rolled over and held like a closing bar, closing bar like red, green?"
"21102620","21103140"," No."
"21103520","21104760"," We aren't done a 15-minute."
"21105180","21108200"," So a weekly a weekly, uh, but no, we're not there yet. "
"21108500","21109120"," We're topping."
"21109120","21110240"," We're not there yet."
"21110940","21111960"," Five-minute chart. "
"21112700","21114080"," Have we closed and turned?"
"21114860","21116340"," Have we done this yet?"
"21117920","21119360"," Have we done this yet?"
"21120740","21122760"," This is your weekly trend, right?"
"21125320","21130260"," Have this I'm going to show you exactly what you need to say we're even bearish on trend."
"21131050","21132240"," You need break below."
"21135240","21140480"," You need up failure. "
"21143720","21147200"," Then you need to sell down and you're ready."
"21147560","21148680"," This is where you get short."
"21148840","21149800"," You want to know when you're ready to get short?"
"21150540","21151720"," This hasn't even happened yet. "
"21153760","21155660"," That's your second failure right there."
"21157020","21162960"," So have we broken below 129 EMA in a five-minute chart yet?"
"21163440","21163720"," No."
"21164360","21166580"," Have we rejected twice yet below?"
"21167280","21172400"," Have we had a cross on the 27 and the 129 yet in a failure to recover yet?"
"21172860","21173360"," No. "
"21174440","21180900"," So if you want to know if we're in a weekly trend change down yet, the answer is no."
"21182420","21187940"," How do you take this trade and win 90% of the time?"
"21191860","21193540"," 90% for the money trade?"
"21194460","21200740"," If you do this and you look for this setup right here, you will be going to be a winner"
"21200740","21203900"," and you will always be a winner."
"21204620","21206080"," You will win nine out of ten trades. "
"21206660","21208180"," You put this on a one-hour chart."
"21208500","21213500"," You put this on a four-hour chart, a daily chart, five-minute chart, one-minute chart."
"21214200","21215940"," You see that confirmation of the downside?"
"21216880","21216980"," Yes. "
"21218240","21222360"," On your timeline, we are then bearish."
"21226790","21227710"," You know what I'm saying?"
"21229610","21230410"," Good question."
"21230670","21231790"," I appreciate that, Basra. "
"21232650","21234650"," So no, are we topping though?"
"21235050","21235790"," Yes, we are."
"21236830","21238350"," What are we looking for here?"
"21238450","21238950"," You want to see it?"
"21239130","21239990"," You can see it right here, right?"
"21240110","21240770"," You're going to show it to you?"
"21240950","21241790"," Right there, got bearish."
"21242370","21243610"," Right there, got bearish. "
"21244310","21245470"," Are we bearish here yet?"
"21245810","21246130"," No."
"21246650","21250290"," Are you trying to call these tops right here and this top right here?"
"21250470","21250950"," Don't bother."
"21251450","21254990"," Wait for the trade below the rejection and then the move lower. "
"21255350","21255710"," Don't bother."
"21256430","21258790"," I can show you 100 times where it failed."
"21259510","21267670"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, or 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,"
"21267890","21269190"," 19, 20, you're broke. "
"21270290","21271090"," You're broke."
"21271430","21271990"," You want to be broke."
"21272710","21274010"," You want to be a winner as a seller. "
"21275850","21276690"," You want to make money every time."
"21277570","21278570"," Fuck internet cred."
"21278790","21280470"," Like I was joking earlier about internet cred. "
"21280790","21281850"," You want internet cred?"
"21282230","21282810"," You want to make money?"
"21283590","21285030"," We have not had that happen yet."
"21286030","21289690"," Don't be calling these tops because every time they do, you get ripped, right?"
"21289790","21291090"," You get wrecked, wrecked, wrecked."
"21291490","21296650"," Either time, either price, either, or it just goes up. "
"21297350","21301690"," You need confirmation in your trades that you're going up or down."
"21301990","21303570"," I don't care if you're a buyer or seller."
"21303970","21305650"," You have to have that confirmation. "
"21306510","21308310"," Now, you can tactfully trade this."
"21308730","21310970"," You can tactfully trade this five minute."
"21311610","21314490"," You can sell this if you want to right here. "
"21314970","21320250"," You can sell a rejection right here to there if you want, but you have to close them out and"
"21320250","21324670"," you can't be calling bearish unless you make one, two, three trades, right?"
"21324870","21327390"," Boom, tactful, boom, tactful, boom, tactful."
"21327670","21329550"," Then you can be like, yeah, I got another rejection right here."
"21329550","21330270"," I'm kind of bearish here. "
"21330930","21334350"," Then you can go on and tell people I'm fucking bearish from our control and over for at least the"
"21334350","21335110"," next week, three weeks."
"21337630","21340130"," So right now, no, are we topping?"
"21341110","21342890"," For right now, we are, and I'm going to show you why."
"21345930","21346730"," Why are we topping?"
"21347710","21348250"," I'm going to delete all. "
"21348370","21349830"," I don't want to afford to delete all that yet, do I?"
"21350530","21351750"," I'm going to look at a 30 minute chart."
"21353170","21354170"," How do I know we're topping?"
"21355650","21356630"," Because we follow a trend."
"21358630","21361790"," Follow a trend, right?"
"21361990","21366970"," Here's a trend goes up, comes back down, grab a dip, rip it up, go down here, grab a dip,"
"21367230","21370170"," rip it up, come back down here, right?"
"21370490","21371190"," Rip it up, see it?"
"21371950","21372870"," Boom, right up there. "
"21373230","21375030"," Come on back down here, rip it up."
"21375170","21381690"," I bet you we start to actually trade sideways and down into anticipation of a good earning season"
"21381690","21382510"," at the end of the month."
"21385390","21386470"," Sorry, bearish. "
"21386570","21387950"," Is that the tippity top?"
"21388710","21396050"," Dude, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay longer, longer than you can stay a"
"21396050","21397130"," solvent."
"21397830","21403670"," And if they're anticipating, which I gave a layout this morning as to why we're anticipating good"
"21403670","21407850"," earning season, they're going to price that shit in, then sell the news on you."
"21410830","21414910"," Gave like a 10 point why do why you should, you should expect a good ER season. "
"21415850","21420210"," We're a little toppy up here in the hourly velocity, a little toppy in the daily velocity."
"21421630","21422910"," So yeah, we are at a topping pattern."
"21423210","21424230"," Is this the top?"
"21424550","21425090"," Probably not. "
"21426290","21428050"," We got some squeezes going on."
"21430680","21433260"," We got, we got some squeezing going on tomorrow likely."
"21434740","21436380"," Let's look at spoons into the bell here. "
"21436460","21437420"," It's 4.05 PM."
"21437620","21437900"," Look at that."
"21438000","21439440"," We're not even at 4.15 just yet. "
"21440920","21441900"," So look at that right here."
"21442100","21443680"," See this little sneaky peach down here."
"21443760","21444740"," Look at these guys down here. "
"21445920","21447260"," Look at these guys down here."
"21448940","21451400"," Are we seeing the big green bars right now?"
"21451600","21451880"," No."
"21453160","21454340"," No, we're not seeing them. "
"21454560","21456820"," Are we, do we see any big green bars down here in volume?"
"21457960","21459280"," I'm not seeing, I saw them yesterday."
"21459420","21460380"," I'm not seeing them right now."
"21461280","21463640"," I'm not seeing these giant green bars down here yet. "
"21466300","21467700"," So I'm going to, I'm going to wait here."
"21468200","21470200"," I'm going to wait, wait a night, nice put on them."
"21470500","21471320"," Again, nice puts. "
"21471560","21472580"," Dude, that's so terrible."
"21474280","21476120"," Buy yourself some puts into the bell."
"21477120","21482100"," Then get the other side of your trade at 4.15. So now you've got some cheap puts on a"
"21482100","21482500"," strangle. "
"21482680","21485980"," Then you get yourself some cheap calls on the strangle for the upside and downside."
"21486700","21488500"," You're actually up on both sides."
"21491560","21492700"," Not financial advice. "
"21500000","21500940"," Oh, we got the twin."
"21501060","21503440"," Dude, is he out there calling the twins right now?"
"21505280","21507580"," Is our brother out there calling twins?"
"21508060","21508380"," Shit."
"21512300","21513700"," I love all of you guys. "
"21513860","21514900"," I'm going to see all of you guys tomorrow."
"21515600","21518020"," I was late this morning because of my audio."
"21518180","21522080"," My audio is good enough to be doing tomorrow if I don't fix it by tomorrow. "
"21522700","21523860"," So I'll see you all tomorrow."
"21524740","21526020"," You know my take on tomorrow."
"21526560","21529860"," You know my upside expectations my downside expectations. "
"21530880","21534660"," I'm going to be looking to I already have puts for I've got puts for next month of this."
"21534820","21537160"," I'm like hedged out the ass right now."
"21537500","21543720"," So I'm going to try to add on some calls here in the next 12 minutes, 13 minutes as we"
"21543720","21546000"," head into 4.15. I'm going to look to see. "
"21546120","21547120"," Let's look right now actually."
"21553480","21557180"," 4.55's due to 3 cents."
"21558400","21560200"," 3 cents. "
"21561240","21564000"," 4.48's are 54 cents."
"21564300","21565840"," No fucking brainer, huh?"
"21566120","21573730"," I didn't get to buy any of those 4.48's. I love you roller coaster."
"21575490","21576510"," Appreciate your brother. "
"21577190","21582810"," So 4.48's 208,000 of those right now costing 54 cents."
"21583950","21587510"," You can add a 4.53 for 15 cents."
"21588030","21590270"," These are fucking easy trades dudes. "
"21591150","21594310"," Like you're talking about now you got calls at 14 cents, right?"
"21594510","21595690"," You know you got puts on already."
"21596090","21598030"," You add a 14 cent call on it."
"21598190","21599270"," No fucking brainer here. "
"21599530","21600530"," No fucking brainer."
"21601650","21606210"," If you're a bearish here, your your puts are going at least to a dollar."
"21607190","21608310"," 95 cents a dollar. "
"21608310","21609590"," You're going to be a winner no matter what."
"21609850","21613690"," If you throw on some insurance and calls, you're going to wins either way."
"21617590","21619310"," Yeah, I'm going to buy some calls here for tomorrow. "
"21619370","21620670"," I've got puts for tomorrow already."
"21623070","21625170"," I'm going to pick up the calls here."
"21625390","21630230"," 4.53 is going to pick up as a hedge to the upside hedge, believe it or not. "
"21630390","21634230"," I didn't buy call upside hedge earlier."
"21634550","21636930"," I should have or I'm waiting right or I didn't buy put up."
"21637510","21641710"," I didn't buy the put side of it right here, which I should have done because I was blabbing,"
"21641910","21643870"," blavity, blavity, blab, blab, blab. "
"21645130","21646750"," And I've got a buyer."
"21647050","21648910"," I'm going to put a stink bit in."
"21655420","21657660"," So I got a stink bit in here for the next five minutes. "
"21658240","21659400"," Good luck to you all tomorrow."
"21660420","21662200"," Get some rest tonight."
