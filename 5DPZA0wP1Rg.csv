"109450","118110"," So yesterday into the close, we were talking about not buying calls and that you would have"
"118110","124850"," dealers, market makers getting neutral into that bell and this was a bear or a bull trap, excuse"
"124850","130670"," me, and you saw that teeing off just once again on that on that gray love bar up here."
"130830","131750"," So that's two in a row. "
"131770","136710"," We have three actually one up top, two and three should see some acceleration of the downside."
"138430","144890"," There is a bounce, I shouldn't say acceleration, cues down here."
"144970","147590"," So this is cues in the bottom left hand side of your chart down here. "
"147610","153390"," I'm going to expect a bounce on cues, but then maybe some consolidation down here and try to get"
"153390","155830"," underneath at some point today."
"155970","163050"," So just be careful on the cues on the open this morning for some bounce ability."
"164190","167830"," I think today one second here, boys and girls. "
"168550","173710"," There is some more supply down below on book map as well right down in here."
"173710","174130"," See that?"

"176810","180770"," Right down there. "
"180910","187010"," If we can get down here and break through on SPX and spy spoons, yes, to get down here."
"188510","195050"," We also talked yesterday about that about that bounce on NASDAQ, but not spy."
"195430","203350"," So I'm a little bit more bearish on spy or grinding down consolidation that I am on tech. "
"203590","213570"," So just be wary on tech of the bounce, but yet some dogging action inside of ES, the sworn spoons."
"215710","217130"," One second air."
"219430","221110"," Santa Claus rally is in trouble. "

"246560","247880"," One quick second here."
"253470","257430"," Let's check the gamma levels this morning and see if anything has changed. "
"267770","270130"," Yeah, nothing that I can see right now has changed."
"274200","279820"," If you're bottom left hand screen, you'll see yesterday we crossed below the gamma flip."
"281320","286140"," And this looks like a little bit of outcome right here. "
"286280","289660"," We got a blast down below you watch the your bottom screen."
"291260","295100"," That bottom right or the bottom left hand or here."
"295240","298360"," Let me just get me do the famous mystery and down here. "
"298680","300080"," Follow my cursor down here."
"303360","305360"," And you'll see price action."
"305780","309080"," We broke below the gamma flip that that's the gamma flip right there. "
"309120","310140"," We've traded below it."
"310280","313820"," Have a nice confirmation underneath that got gamma flip."
"313820","317380"," So I'd like to see some more action to the downside here on SPX today. "
"317980","323020"," Target down below 4661.45. Sorry for my nose."
"323980","329540"," I got very sick over New Year's and I've got RSV."
"329840","333020"," So RSV is the weird thing. "
"333140","335560"," I've never I don't think I've ever had it since maybe I was a kid."
"335560","338520"," So my I guess this stuff like comes in waves."
"339300","342780"," Like first you get the first you get the temperature. "
"343100","346380"," Then you get the like stripped road or some shit."
"346520","349360"," And then it goes to your lungs and you get like lungs sick and stuff."
"349560","351680"," So still battling that right now. "
"352380","358340"," Keep your eye on this dilly trigger down below here and note that the gamma flip currently is"
"358340","361940"," sitting at 4740 this morning."
"361940","366360"," So about 10 ticks off that 4750 yesterday."
"367180","368280"," So it has dropped slightly. "
"369600","373140"," You get S3 below down here at 46768."
"373580","376680"," And then the target of 46411."
"377880","381640"," It would be nice to see this morning on these minutes if we can get it. "
"382760","384800"," I'd love to see it down here."
"386120","389440"," Catch that nice bounce off the dilly trigger or a break below."
"390340","394520"," Trap in some of these sellers and then the move the actual move higher. "
"398100","399780"," So I'll leave this up like this."
"399940","406920"," If anything changes we'll switch back to the or we'll start looking at that that target to the"
"406920","407160"," downside."
"407680","408940"," But just keep note of that this morning. "
"409480","416780"," If anyone asks inside of the chats the target or the dilly trigger is 4611."
"416780","422440"," And that effort has been evident in supporting the global economy specifically over the past years"
"422440","424280"," and having short market stability."
"426480","427860"," One quick second here. "
"428020","428800"," Get some stuff I got to do."
"431560","438620"," Hopefully if you were a bull yesterday you took you heated my warning yesterday."
"439420","448400"," You didn't get that great love bars. "

"599460","601620"," an actual trend reversal."
"602440","604800"," Bulls are still on trend right now. "
"604880","610940"," I know it can seem extremely bearish or whatever out there to you in social media."
"612740","615520"," So if you're a seller you are still very tactful."

"1101730","1110090"," look at rut this morning so it would not shock or surprise me to see cues actually go lower than"
"1110090","1116010"," the early the daily trigger right close some of this stuff out down here possibly trade that 388"
"1116010","1121030"," the one key here is that if you want to see that v-shape recovery you don't want to see"
"1121030","1130370"," cues peter out up here at 396 398 to begin a real role to the downside so these"
"1130370","1140230"," this portion of this more outsized on cues than spx i would say so you can we'll move this over"
"1140230","1145010"," here for you so you can snap this and take a look at it so no dip there wouldn't be"
"1145010","1150290"," no dip by for me here on cues you can snap that if you like but you can see down"
"1150290","1155970"," here and you can see down there a little more bearish on this side than we are here right we're"
"1155970","1163970"," coming up into positive daily velocity we're now losing daily velocity so i'm not uh i don't"
"1163970","1170410"," believe this holds this 398 18 i don't think that this holds um so i would like to see that"
"1170410","1179890"," bloodbath to the downside move but then an immediate reaction down here target 386"
"1179890","1187370"," possibly on on cues because we are on the downside of velocity you know if we're proven wrong or"
"1187370","1193190"," proven wrong to see the bounce here if you want to get bullish on cues again if you are a"
"1193190","1196710"," bull and you're like that cap you're wrong you're out of your mind there's no way we're going that"
"1196710","1206270"," low uh you are looking to regain 403 97 so if you regain 403 97 uh you know you see"
"1206270","1211170"," a bounce down here on this daily trigger minutes and all that are great we get above that hourly"
"1211170","1217770"," trigger and we successfully backtest it then i'm wrong and you you jump right back in again right"
"1217770","1223650"," in here somewhere okay so that's what you're looking for currently today and you're you don't get"
"1223650","1228390"," bullish until you're up here right you know dicking around down here now that stuff because we are"
"1228390","1235770"," coming into uh daily trigger that is not supportive not supportive i'm going to call this a fake"
"1235770","1240810"," ass support right here so where both bulls will be like you're trying to buy it there's a high"
"1240810","1250210"," chance they're going to get trapped and they're going to roll cues down now IWM RTY uh let's take"
"1250210","1258870"," a look here I know that people like to say that stuff has changed let's take a look at RTY"
"1258870","1265230"," right RTY big outsized moves so any big outsized moves they've always had this nice big pullback"
"1265230","1272890"," big outsized move pullback same thing right giant move pullback giant move pullback uh so the key"
"1272890","1277950"," on RTY though is this or on small cap so we're going to take a look back in time on"
"1277950","1287410"," it really quick because i want you to pay attention right now to the weekly cross uh uh crossing"
"1287410","1293610"," the monthly here okay and so this is an important thing because as long as price is above the"
"1293610","1298610"," weekly and the weekly is making this cross right here right starting to happen here by the end of"
"1298610","1304810"," the week here okay by friday you're going to get a week cross of the month trigger and what's"
"1304810","1312350"," important here is that price stays above uh only this here okay and of course i'd like to see it"
"1312350","1320830"," regain and head north again for the next leg here but this is crucial right here for small caps"
"1320830","1329170"," that you stay above 1875 okay it's it's crucial now why do i say that we're going to look back"
"1329170","1333890"," in time and i'm going to show you why here one quick second here so we can bring this up"
"1337890","1342950"," every time this weekly here i want you to pay attention right here you see this weekly here right"
"1344310","1349770"," you see this weekly this orange line coming up here every time it wants to cross right we back"
"1349770","1356850"," check for for bullishness of small caps and if we can't get them above right we start rejecting"
"1356850","1365710"," lower we get some real nasty downside here so let me show you another example here too"
"1365710","1373350"," watch that orange and blue line with me here and the reason i'm saying that is because back in 2020"
"1373350","1381250"," uh we did get a cross and it confirmed a much larger move to the upside you know let's go"
"1381250","1388770"," to the day i make it easy the same lines or whatever do one quick second i'm going to show"
"1388770","1397470"," you why i'm talking about this and it's right here okay so see that cross of that weekly cross here"
"1397470","1403910"," and see the back checks that take place as it's happening so you see this violent move backwards"
"1403910","1412150"," bam retest the cross of that weekly now if that cross is successful we should get some nice move to"
"1412150","1419530"," a nice move to the upside but the back check must be successful okay so on this 30 minute chart"
"1419530","1429350"," here on rty right however doom and gloomish this looks to you if you get a successful retest"
"1429350","1435890"," of this cross here as this happens into friday monday of next week you're talking about a move that"
"1435890","1442750"," is insane right uh so if you're a bull you're just sitting on your hands that's all you're doing"
"1442750","1448470"," just watching this action here and you are looking for this to happen if this happens you're going"
"1448470","1457170"," to get an outsized move in the month of january february and march so um there's a giant catalyst"
"1457170","1466070"," coming up here for um small caps this week from i would say friday monday as because you're going"
"1466070","1472830"," to get a closing price here on this weekly and you're going to see this this weekly come up uh"
"1472830","1480050"," and then next week start to move higher you'll see a retest here into the weekend price retest of"

"2700830","2710250"," becoming a serious artist at a very young age and uh"

"2718410","2726970"," with the drawing stick for christmas and my other thought is well you know when a i comes along"
"2726970","2736610"," it's gonna be a a useless degree to some extent so i don't know if my youngest"
"2736610","2745290"," daughter though might uh want to send her to actual an art geared private school uh if that's"
"2745290","2754930"," really what she wants to do it uh just stay away from digital art try to maybe go down a"
"2754930","2762830"," classic art path rather than digital arts believe it or not because i really think that a digital"
"2762830","2768170"," art is is we're gonna be kind of fucked here at some point uh not quite a dead degree but"
"2768170","2777750"," uh the AI is coming for it right um but i was thinking about my youngest because my when i"
"2777750","2785790"," was a kid i was uh i i did really well in art and my mom uh moved me to"
"2785790","2794830"," a private school uh focused on on the arts in boston and uh she removed me"

"2801270","2807090"," school she came into the school back into the school to get out of the school disenrolled me and"
"2807090","2811150"," said that she had it like an exit that told me she's like i have an exit i'm having an"
"2811150","2818010"," existential crisis that you're going to be poor for the rest of your life if you become an artist"
"2818010","2826570"," that's a true story and uh now of course i'm looking at my youngest and i am going the opposite"
"2826570","2836430"," route if that's going to make her happy uh i guess we'll i guess we'll do it yeah yeah exactly"
"2836430","2842750"," plimpton uh something more tangible right uh something that we like you would need robot like we're"
"2842750","2851710"," but i think robotics are farther away than AI is robotics i think we're uh 50 to 100 years away"
"2851710","2860970"," from real like the catching up of robotics where they could actually put a human touch on uh"
"2860970","2869950"," art you know not not so not the exact actiness the uncanny valley of um manufactured goods today"
"2869950","2876170"," that you know it's been manufactured not for human hand human hand has a beauty to it that you"
"2876170","2883730"," can't replicate right just yet and i think uh robotics will be the robotics will be the the laggard"

"3777200","3779300"," rebooting AI joins us this morning."
"3779380","3782400"," Professor you're great to see you thanks for being with us."
"3782660","3788140"," Thanks for having me I guess I'll start with it whether or not you think the Times lawsuit is a"
"3788140","3794420"," sign of things to come absolutely I think we're going to see a lot more litigation this year I"
"3794420","3798520"," think the Times lawsuit is fairly solid I'm sure that there will be lots of things to skirmish"
"3798520","3803140"," about but they kind of have opening on debt to rights they show that it's possible to make the"
"3803140","3809880"," systems plagiarize pretty much in exact words things that are in the New York Times database I've"
"3809880","3815080"," had some work myself that I'll put out in IEEE spectrum tomorrow with Reed South and showing"
"3815080","3820320"," basically the same thing the visual domain so showing the mid-journey and open AI are capable of"
"3820320","3827160"," replicating trademark characters even full frames of movies almost identically and I think we'll"
"3827160","3833260"," see litigation from film studios from game studios from independent artists and so forth I think"
"3833260","3834920"," there's going to be a lot of litigation this year. "
"3835360","3840720"," What do you think will be the bigger dynamic the litigation that we're talking about right now or"
"3840720","3846460"," are more broad based law government regulation whether it's in the United States or Europe or"
"3846460","3846800"," elsewhere?"
"3848120","3854840"," So there's a lot of laws that may come out in Europe soon so there's the EU AI Act there's"
"3854840","3859520"," a tentative agreement on it but it's not actually signed yet if it takes effect it won't take"
"3859520","3865200"," effect immediately there's still some things to work out but there's a lot there the United States"
"3865200","3866180"," I think is lagging behind."

"3875220","3880040"," Just before Christmas there was a bill about data transparency where do you get your things from?"
"3880580","3881900"," Have you taken copyrighted sources?"
"3882200","3882540"," How many?"
"3882780","3887660"," By Anna Eschew and I think his name is Don Baier that's an interesting piece of legislation that"
"3887660","3891220"," could really change the game if that gets all the way through and becomes a law. "
"3891620","3894640"," What do you think about the commercialization prospects of AI?"
"3895140","3901400"," I think about how people have been analogizing this whole AI wave as akin to what we saw with the"
"3901400","3906720"," internet back in the 90s but the internet I mean largely it's usable by everybody."
"3907000","3911200"," You don't necessarily have to pay to use it except for service providers to get access."
"3912160","3917320"," In terms of AI we've seen this tension between the for-profit side the non-profit side. "
"3917840","3922240"," What do you make of kind of just the overall business models and how those will develop in the"
"3922240","3922940"," forthcoming years?"
"3924340","3929740"," I don't think there's a business model yet that fully justifies the valuations that these companies"
"3929740","3930220"," are getting."
"3930500","3934620"," So open AI is valued most recently at I think 86 billion dollars."
"3935460","3939840"," It's not clear where that revenue is going to come from where the profits are going to come from. "
"3940100","3946340"," They apparently made something like a billion and a half or two billion last year but that was not"
"3946340","3947560"," in profit that was revenue."
"3947720","3951040"," It was very expensive to run their thing so that's one issue."
"3951040","3956060"," Another issue is whether people will actually in Fortune 500 companies use this stuff"
"3957140","3957620"," systematically. "
"3958080","3960340"," So there's a little bit of background."
"3961140","3968180"," People are doing a lot of proof of concept testing things but not too many Fortune 500 companies"
"3968180","3970640"," have said okay we're going to go with this now it really works."
"3971140","3974320"," You're the fundamental problem with the current technologies that make stuff up. "
"3974520","3975160"," People call those hallucinations."
"3976260","3980940"," In fact the word hallucination was the word of the year for dictionary.com last year because large"
"3980940","3982420"," language models do it so much."
"3982640","3985480"," Like if you put in your own biography it will make some stuff up. "
"3985700","3990320"," So the systems are not yet reliable enough to support some of the applications people have talked"
"3990320","3990740"," about."
"3991080","3994860"," They're reliable enough for computer programs to use them as a kind of fancy form of auto complete"
"3994860","4000400"," but computer programs by themselves aren't a big enough market to justify the valuations that we're"
"4000400","4000600"," seeing."
"4000800","4002560"," So is it a lot still open about that?"
"4002820","4007520"," I'm sure you understand the streets on the lookout for case studies that are legitimate and"
"4007520","4008160"," productive. "
"4009180","4014880"," What would you imagine might be one of those in I guess early this year if we get one where"
"4014880","4015740"," there is the most promise?"
"4017560","4021380"," I think the most promise the clearest use case right now is computer programmers."
"4021380","4026380"," That's already established but it's not the breakout economics that I think people are hoping for."
"4026920","4030660"," People have talked about doing chat based search or generative search. "
"4035560","4039720"," It is a breakout immediate use case the way people are hoping for."
"4039800","4040500"," I just don't see it."
"4041160","4044820"," The big problem is you still need humans in the loop for most things because the systems aren't"
"4044820","4045400"," reliable enough. "
"4045580","4049580"," So auto correct or auto complete the way programmers use it that's fine."
"4050020","4051140"," There's some actual money there."
"4051380","4052200"," People are using it. "
"4052420","4058220"," Writing copy text might work for like people who want to make a whole lot of blog sites quickly."
"4058520","4063700"," There's probably some money there but the killer app that people talked about a year ago was chat"
"4063700","4064280"," based search."
"4064300","4066340"," You just type in your search greeting and get an answer. "
"4066740","4070080"," What we really have for that is a prototype that doesn't work and I don't think the current"
"4070080","4073820"," technology actually can support it because these systems are not based in fact."
"4074420","4078360"," They're just based in models of what do people say in particular circumstances and that's why we"
"4078360","4082720"," get the hallucinations and that's why these search things are not really materializing the way that"
"4082720","4083480"," people expect it."
"4084140","4090140"," Certainly a gut check as the street wrestles with some profound questions about its use and the"
"4090140","4091660"," universality in the years ahead. "
"4091880","4092420"," Professor, thanks."
"4092900","4093800"," We'll check in with you soon."
"4094000","4094360"," Gary Marcus. "
"4096920","4099800"," As we had to break, check out this mystery chart."
"4100140","4106460"," It's a healthcare name that underperformed in 2023 but more than 80% of analysts call it a buy"
"4106460","4107420"," including our next guest."
"4107640","4108939"," She's forecasting big gains ahead. "
"4109520","4112800"," He'll tell us why and give us some other top picks in the sector next."
"4153590","4160630"," The Euro falls to a fresh two-week low versus the US dollar last down 0.3% at $1 "
"4160630","4298810",".09. Market"
"4298810","4303370"," continues to struggle on this second trading session of the year down down almost 300 here."
"4303590","4307530"," 1% declines on the NASDAQ, another tough day for tech sector-wise. "
"4308470","4312610"," Energy really the only one that's working in the early going today, although utilities and"
"4312610","4315550"," communication services are trying to play along here at the moment."
"4315870","4319830"," Health care meantime trailed the overall market last year but our next guest believes M&A"
"4319830","4324950"," conversations, the weight loss drugs will continue to drive the sector higher in 2024."
"4325870","4331030"," Morgan's family CEO Gorman said Great could go down this year, maybe a couple of times. "
"4331450","4335690"," Is the conversation going to change much this year?"
"4335790","4338390"," Do you think prior to what we were talking about last 12 months?"
"4339230","4340050"," I don't think tremendously."
"4340910","4343850"," You know, maybe on the margin, I feel like most of the topics are similar."
"4345010","4349530"," Utilization, the geo- Gorman says the economy is fine and the recession is unlikely. "
"4349830","4351030"," The Fed has done a good job."
"4351190","4356150"," We've seen a real buying spree from pharma into biotech that will likely continue."
"4356370","4358290"," It's obviously intermittent but pretty consistent. "
"4359070","4361370"," So I think those are the three things really driving the sector."
"4361570","4366430"," Obviously, the election year throws a little bit of a monkey wrench into things at times but I"
"4366430","4368510"," doubt it's a major topic, all things considered."
"4368890","4371270"," Is M&A part of the Merck and Biogen trade?"
"4371770","4372370"," Not really. "
"4372630","4373590"," I feel like both can work."
"4373930","4375490"," They've both underperformed as of late."
"4375710","4377030"," Merck's started to work. "
"4377170","4379290"," The chart's been better last couple of weeks."
"4379490","4381150"," So finally, there's a little bit of mojo there."
"4381630","4383730"," Biogen's just been a horrible stock for so long. "
"4384350","4385730"," I think expectations are really low."
"4386110","4391050"," Clearly, they're going to be the leader for a while in Alzheimer's until other players get to the"
"4391050","4391290"," market."
"4391690","4395090"," But it seems like we've been talking about Alzheimer's disease for so many years. "
"4395410","4398030"," Finally, there's a drug and the street doesn't care."
"4398250","4401730"," So maybe there's like a little bit of a sentiment shift at some point this year if they can get"
"4401730","4402110"," their act together."
"4402290","4406410"," But Pfizer doesn't get included in that camp in terms of names that have struggled for so long. "
"4406870","4407590"," It's time for a turn."
"4407970","4408530"," Pfizer's not."
"4408690","4410970"," It just feels like there's not much to do there. "
"4411090","4412370"," They've done so many deals."
"4412570","4414350"," They've done at least six deals since 2021."
"4415230","4417390"," I think they've loaded the boat from an M&A perspective. "
"4418030","4419130"," Now they've got to execute."
"4419470","4420830"," Stock is not that cheap on earnings."
"4420830","4425890"," If you look at 24 and 25 estimates, so I feel like the Pfizer move has been made. "
"4425990","4429410"," They obviously tried to put out very conservative guidance a few weeks ago."
"4429410","4432890"," Stock went to 26, 27 back near 30."
"4433110","4433970"," Not much to do. "
"4434190","4437690"," What do you think about the prospect for weight loss drugs in this year?"
"4437790","4439110"," Obviously we've seen a huge run up."
"4439190","4442330"," It's been a big talking point for the sector in 2023."
"4442610","4448890"," What do we have on the docket in terms of studies, approvals, various use cases, total addressable"
"4448890","4450250"," market for 2024. "
"4450710","4451850"," Yeah, there's a lot."
"4452330","4456610"," I think we're still in the very early innings of this conversation."
"4457030","4459050"," It's obviously going to evolve over time. "
"4459970","4464910"," This will be the first year that both Novo and Lily both have an approved drug just for obesity."
"4465730","4468370"," So we're going to see the scripts kind of start to inflect."
"4468830","4473490"," I think most of the street is very positive as am I on the adoption rate and things of that"
"4473490","4473810"," nature. "
"4474170","4478670"," And yes, there are going to be a number of studies from both companies looking at the GLPs in"
"4478670","4486210"," arthritis, looking at it in sleep apnea, even inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases in time."
"4486770","4489090"," So I think all of that is really going to boost the interest."
"4489350","4491390"," I don't really see the conversation dying at all. "
"4491910","4495350"," The stock price performance may not be as elevated as it was last year."
"4495630","4498830"," Really going to be tough for Novo and Lily to put up 50 percent gains again."
"4499210","4504490"," But as far as like the narrative, this is definitely the number one storyline in health care is"
"4504490","4505190"," still in 24. "
"4505690","4512410"," Back above 600 today, land gone with nice remarks the other day about it, be one day becoming the"
"4512410","4514590"," first trillion dollar drug company."
"4514930","4517130"," When do they use their currency, so to speak?"
"4517570","4519150"," They've done a couple small deals recently."
"4519470","4521710"," I've been a little bit surprised that they haven't been more aggressive. "
"4522010","4524030"," But on the other hand, they don't really don't need to."
"4524190","4529210"," I think a lot of the business development, the strategy at the large cut pharma level is based on"
"4529210","4532550"," the need to acquire in order to kind of elevate revenue."
"4533010","4533770"," They don't have that issue. "
"4533950","4536750"," So again, a little bit surprised they've been this conservative."
"4536750","4542190"," They've done a couple small billion dollarish deals along the way, but they could easily use it for"
"4542190","4543250"," something bigger if they wanted to."
"4543510","4545030"," Something to keep an eye on for sure. "
"4545670","4546310"," Jared, thank you."
"4546490","4546950"," Thank you guys."
"4548410","4554310"," Still to come this morning, 2023 ending with a big plunge in mortgage activity with that may signal"
"4554310","4556930"," about the health of housing as we go into the new year. "
"4557170","4558070"," We're back after a short break."
"4729520","4734900"," Despite a sharp drop in mortgage rates to end the year, housing demand ended 23 on a pretty sour"
"4734900","4735280"," note."
"4735720","4737180"," Our Diana Oleg joins us with those details. "
"4737520","4737860"," Morning, Diana."
"4738300","4739200"," Good morning, Carl."
"4739360","4741220"," Yeah, a big drop to end the year actually. "
"4741520","4744480"," And we got two weeks worth since the MBA was closed last week."
"4744780","4749400"," Now, these are the two weeks when mortgage rates sat below 7% for the first time since September."
"4749400","4755080"," The average rate on the 30 year fixed ended the year at 6.76% lower than where it was"
"4755080","4757940"," two weeks ago, but higher than where it was a week ago. "
"4758320","4761660"," But of course, still well below the 8% high we saw in mid October."
"4762200","4766000"," But the sharp drop we saw at the start of December kind of got a bit choppier."
"4766160","4772140"," So as a result, total mortgage application volume ended the year 9.4% lower than it was two weeks"
"4772140","4772460"," before. "
"4772720","4773920"," And that is seasonally adjusted."
"4774520","4778600"," Because the numbers for two weeks are kind of messy, I'm going to give you year over year"
"4778600","4779980"," comparisons to break it down."
"4780580","4785780"," Applications to refinance a home loan ended the year 15% higher than a year ago. "
"4786180","4789980"," Applications for a mortgage to buy a home ended the year 12% lower."
"4790220","4794320"," Now, those who can benefit from a refi are clearly trying to get in while they can."
"4794660","4800280"," But home buyers are still contending with very little supply and very high and still rising home"
"4800280","4800640"," prices. "
"4801340","4804840"," So the question now is, with rates in the 6% range, will they stay there?"
"4804840","4809620"," And if they do, will that be enough to get potential sellers off the fence and get some more supply"
"4809620","4810620"," into the market?"
"4811000","4814580"," Mortgage rates started this week higher after also edging up on Friday."
"4814900","4819040"," So we are now unfortunately at the highest level in two weeks back to you guys."
"4819340","4822020"," Just in your conversation with Robert Frank this morning, Diana. "
"4822660","4826640"," Sounds like you're a bit skeptical that rates of these levels are going to bring a lot of supply"
"4826640","4827180"," back online."
"4827940","4832820"," No, I think because so many people, the vast majority of current homeowners have rates in the three"
"4832820","4833860"," to 4% range."
"4833860","4836920"," It's great that for buyers that rates are pulling back a little bit. "
"4836920","4841620"," But if you're a seller and you're looking at trading your 3% rate, I don't think a 6%"
"4841620","4842700"," rate is really going to do it."
"4842860","4846640"," Maybe a five if you really need to move and four would be better."
"4846740","4851100"," But if we could get into the low sixes or fives, that might help get sellers off the fence. "
"4851340","4853780"," I don't think six and seven percent is going to do it."
"4854040","4856460"," Yeah, a lot of psychology that goes into it as well."
"4856600","4857320"," Diana, thank you. "
"4858700","4861940"," Getting some auto sales numbers from Toyota this hour."
"4862100","4863340"," Let's get to fill a bow for more fill."
"4864680","4866680"," Leslie strong December for Toyota. "
"4867020","4872900"," And remember, this is in comparison December of 2023 with December of 22 still had some chip issues"
"4872900","4875000"," that were hurting production in December of 22."
"4875320","4882020"," So it's not a surprise that for December, Toyota's overall sales in the U.S. up 30.3%. According to"
"4882020","4888660"," Eleanor Terra from Twitter, the SEC is holding me today with exchanges to finalize comments on the"
"4888660","4893120"," 19 B4 submitted by the Bitcoin slot ETF issuers."
"4893420","4895280"," We have talked about it for months. "
"4895620","4900660"," There is a clear rotation in the market for people who want greater fuel economy, want to take a"
"4900660","4905000"," step towards EVs, but they don't see the full EV route yet."
"4905280","4906560"," And therefore, they're going towards hybrids."
"4906560","4909760"," And that's why you see the Toyota saying upside in Bitcoin. "
"4910540","4912400"," 63% increase in hybrids."
"4912400","4913860"," The demand is there, guys."
"4915280","4919260"," Interesting, Phil, especially given in December, we saw such low gas prices. "
"4919500","4922700"," I think a majority of the gas stations across the country are now below $3 a gallon."
"4923240","4928560"," Is there still that interplay or correlation between where gas prices are and how many EVs or"
"4928560","4929660"," hybrid vehicles are sold?"
"4931560","4937500"," No, because you really need gas prices to make a new high and then stay there."
"4937880","4939780"," And we haven't seen that in a long time. "
"4940120","4942740"," That's really what drives people to say, I can't take it."
"4942980","4946300"," I got to get into an EV or I've got to get into a hybrid."
"4946660","4950540"," I think what we're seeing right now, Leslie, in terms of the demand for EVs, not just at Toyota,"
"4950660","4953960"," but with other automakers as well, is a clear understanding. "
"4954740","4960740"," This makes total sense in terms of the mileage and the cost and the price point for hybrids"
"4960740","4963920"," relative to internal combustion and to EVs."
"4964380","4966100"," It just makes more sense right now."
"4966360","4968260"," And that's why you see the rotation that we're seeing. "
"4968880","4973780"," Pretty interesting push and pull on Tesla today, Phil, whether it's the headline about deliveries,"
"4974900","4978260"," beating expectations, but also falling to BYD."
"4978440","4983460"," And then Morgan Stanley today arguing that the stock's going to be valued on less about cars,"
"4984220","4989140"," whereas Bernstein today reiterates 150 underweight, saying they're going to disappoint on volumes"
"4989140","4989460"," and margin."
"4990840","4992780"," Talking about two different things here, Carl. "
"4993240","4996360"," Bernstein with Tony Sakinagi, he has said this for some time."
"4996620","5000100"," He is not very optimistic about the next couple of years for Tesla."
"5000660","5006980"," His estimate for deliveries next year, 2.15 million, the streets at about 2.2 million, he thinks"
"5006980","5010440"," they're not only at disappoint in terms of deliveries, but also in terms of margins. "
"5010940","5015560"," And then when you mentioned Morgan Stanley, Adam Jonas has said for some time, the real value"
"5015560","5019420"," within Tesla, it's not the automobile and the deliveries there."
"5019840","5024740"," It's what the entire ecosystem may represent in the future."
"5024740","5032240"," And that's why he believes there's so much untapped potential, potential valuation growth in the"
"5032240","5032600"," future. "
"5033260","5036340"," And that's what you get when you listen to Adam Jonas."
"5036660","5040340"," And that's his theory right now, not to say that it's right or wrong, but that's what he talks"
"5040340","5042300"," about largely in most of his notes."
"5042780","5047740"," Yeah, right above the 50 day this morning at about 2.34, Phil, thanks. "
"5048000","5050000"," Interesting story regarding the auto business right now."
"5050060","5050580"," We're filled with bow."

"5278580","5284200"," stocks is a return to, quote, reverse goldilocks and it's time to hit the pause button on risk"
"5284200","5284640"," assets."
"5285000","5287880"," Let's bring in CNBC senior markets commentator Mike Santoli. "
"5288020","5293440"," Mike, we kind of saw that yesterday with growth very much underperforming value, especially among"
"5293440","5294300"," those smaller cap names."
"5294300","5295020"," For sure."
"5295200","5299940"," HSBC is one of the firms that actually has been in the bullish soft landing camp for a while. "
"5300140","5304060"," So they made these timely calls believing growth was going to hold up, inflation was going to be"
"5304060","5305200"," friendly, yields could come down."
"5305560","5310340"," I think really the feature of their call now is the market priced a lot of that in going into"
"5310340","5310700"," this year."
"5310800","5313680"," And that was what was yesterday was about as well as today. "
"5313900","5318680"," So reverse goldilocks means we start to pay a little more attention to the risks both to growth and"
"5318680","5320740"," to inflation being stickier today's data."
"5321040","5322780"," It's not about inflation being a problem."
"5322780","5324860"," It's actually continuing to leak out of the system. "
"5325240","5329360"," It's much more about growth maybe looking a little more wobbly, but more more than anything."
"5329700","5333420"," It's sentiment and positioning overheated, need to digest, need to cool off."
"5333680","5335060"," That seems like the process is underway. "
"5335380","5340040"," We've been watching prices paid on the ISM down again, sub 50."
"5340440","5342360"," Does that mean that the jobs numbers worth worrying about?"
"5342580","5344260"," We can see Morgan Stanley at 180."
"5344680","5349380"," I don't know about worrying about, but I think people looking into the jobs numbers today say"
"5349380","5354400"," there's a little more pronounced slackening of labor demand that you can see in the numbers in the"
"5354400","5359320"," quit rate, in the higher rate, not where you'd say, okay, we're looking at negative payrolls, but"
"5359320","5361840"," more to the point of we want to slow down. "
"5362000","5363000"," We expect to slow down."
"5363120","5366680"," How much of a slow down are we prepared to get and have earnings estimates hold up?"
"5367020","5372420"," I think a lot of it, the debate is sharpened by the fact that sickle stocks have ripped, small caps"
"5372420","5374080"," have ramped into year end."
"5374420","5378000"," And today, it's a more of a broad base sell off, not really a rotation like it was yesterday. "
"5378380","5384660"," It's kind of industrials and financials and consumer discretionary, taking a step back because they"
"5384660","5386640"," priced in perfection or something close to it."

"5393760","5397340"," It's going to take a lot more good news to have that feed into price. "
"5397580","5400460"," And in terms of news, it feels like we've gotten back from the holiday break."
"5400760","5401520"," Some of us who had a break."
"5402580","5404620"," And there's been a slew of downgrades. "
"5405020","5406760"," There's also just more liquidity in the market."
"5406920","5410900"," People kind of coming refreshed and looking at their computers and saying, you know what, we saw"
"5410900","5415340"," this massive run up, this sentiment that kind of everybody was able to get away with when there"
"5415340","5416920"," were fewer people in their seats."
"5417260","5420660"," And it's a question of what do you do with the normal pullback?"
"5421120","5426380"," If it is just about sentiment having to be reset a little bit lower, the underlying trends look"
"5426380","5426800"," okay. "
"5427260","5432220"," All the market based stuff, you know, in terms of when you get this kind of momentum push into a"
"5432220","5434860"," year end, it tends to have good implications months ahead."
"5435260","5437760"," Just in the short term, it gets to be a little bit choppy."
"5438040","5440620"," Nine straight weeks higher, doesn't happen that often. "
"5441120","5444060"," So this is the process that seems to be underway right now."
"5444300","5446220"," The Fed is trying to push back against the market."
"5446340","5451840"," Meanwhile, the market can point to the ISM prices paid numbers and say, look, we don't know where"
"5451840","5453320"," this is going in the next three or four months. "
"5453440","5459520"," We could have the makings of a decent easing cycle, whether it's for the right or wrong reasons, we"
"5459520","5459920"," can argue."
"5460400","5463100"," But it's not completely off base to think that's where we are."
"5463100","5465260"," Yeah, definitely a tug of war there. "
"5465660","5466820"," Mike, thank you so much."
"5467380","5467880"," Appreciate it."
"5468240","5472020"," Staying on the market, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin saying this morning that a soft landing"
"5472020","5477220"," for the economy is looking more likely, but is hardly certain kind of going to what Mike was just"
"5477220","5477800"," talking about. "
"5478140","5482820"," And a potential for additional rate hikes remain on the table."
"5483000","5488460"," So as we enter the new year, have we truly left recessionary fears behind us joining us now,"

"5491860","5493660"," David, that's a great place for us to start today. "
"5494220","5496980"," Have we left those recessionary fears behind us?"
"5497060","5501740"," It feels like the market, you know, notwithstanding the last two days really kind of has baked in"
"5501740","5504740"," this idea that a soft landing is kind of more in that inevitable camp."
"5505560","5510080"," Well, I think that that is fully baked in the cake as far as equity valuations are concerned."
"5510860","5516620"," I think it's premature and I thought all along premature to throw in the recession towel like so"
"5516620","5519720"," many others have because it hasn't happened yet. "
"5520440","5525560"," What happened last year was very unusual in the sense that we had massive fiscal stimulus."
"5526020","5533020"," In fact, the fiscal stimulus last year, you know, both through the, you know, the last chapters of"
"5533020","5537500"," the excess savings file on the consumer side, but also all the Biden subsidies."
"5537920","5542340"," I mean, we had a boom in industrial construction in 2023 with all sorts of other spinoff effects. "
"5542900","5550360"," Fiscal policy last year added more than 4 percentage points to nominal GDP growth, which was just"
"5550360","5551260"," over 6%."
"5551260","5557220"," So two thirds of the growth last year in the economy came from the juice from fiscal policy and"
"5557220","5560300"," that acted as a huge antidote to what the Fed was doing."
"5560820","5566200"," The problem for this year is that we're going to more from fiscal stimulus, the fiscal drag, the"
"5566200","5570220"," fiscal drag is going to be between one and one and a half percentage points on GDP. "
"5571080","5576640"," And as Jay Powell told us of the podium at the December meeting is that there's still a significant"
"5576640","5581940"," pipeline of tightening from the damage the Fed's already done that's going to be seeping into the"
"5581940","5583580"," economy this year."
"5583900","5590520"," So this year is when we really see the rubber meet the road in terms of the ongoing lags between"
"5590520","5595660"," Fed policy and the economy, but this time around no offset from what's happening on the fiscal"
"5595660","5596060"," side."
"5596320","5598060"," Is the fiscal side done?"
"5598320","5603240"," I ask only because I spoke with Robert Kaplan, the former Dallas Fed president a few weeks ago, who"
"5603240","5609500"," said that this will continue to be a year of significant fiscal stimulus and potentially coinciding"
"5609500","5614480"," with Fed pivot, which could yet again rear inflation. "
"5614920","5619220"," So who's to say that it's really truly worked its way through the system?"
"5619880","5622580"," Well, you have to differentiate between levels and growth."
"5622960","5626320"," So I'm not talking a recession, it is not about the level of GDP."
"5627360","5631160"," And it's not about the level of fiscal stimulus, it's about the change. "
"5632240","5638780"," And so what's going to be happening is that yes, the level of fiscal stimulus will still be very"
"5638780","5644140"," high, but incrementally, it's going to be detracting from GDP growth in the coming year."
"5644500","5648960"," So we have the differentia between levels and growth is going to be in terms of the impact on"
"5648960","5654260"," growth, the change is going to be squarely negative in the coming 12 months."
"5654500","5658760"," Then the question is going to be, especially because we have a mountain of these debt rollovers,"
"5658760","5663520"," whether it's in the non mortgage personal sector or in the corporate sector and commercial real"
"5663520","5668140"," estate, it's going to be a very interesting year from a debt service perspective, because we"
"5668140","5671420"," haven't seen all the lags from what the Fed has done kick in already. "
"5671660","5673160"," Remember, the Fed was done tightening in 2006."
"5675420","5679940"," And then all the bad stuff hit the Fed and late 2007 into oh wait, people just do not respect"
"5679940","5681680"," the policy lags."
"5681880","5687820"," And the fact that we did have a significant offset last year, which was fiscal policy that is not"
"5687820","5691020"," going to be repeated, will not be repeated in 2024. "
"5691600","5692880"," So that's the big differential."
"5693940","5699000"," And I think that people who have said, well, the recession hasn't happened yet, therefore it's not"
"5699000","5704320"," going to happen at all, is like me sitting in my office here in Toronto saying, well, it hasn't, it"
"5704320","5706820"," didn't snow in December in Toronto, Canada."
"5707140","5709280"," So winter's been called off. "
"5709580","5711160"," You know, everybody did the same thing in 2007."
"5711600","5712040"," Where's this recession?"
"5712580","5713080"," Where's this recession?"
"5713440","5715860"," Then in oh wait, oops, same thing in 2000."
"5716300","5717260"," You know, where's the recession?"
"5717820","5718600"," Where's the recession?"
"5718980","5721260"," And then in 2001, oops, there it is. "
"5721540","5726120"," You know, to say that there's not going to be recession is to tell me after the most pernicious Fed"
"5726120","5731400"," tightening cycle in over 40 years, is to tell me that the business cycle has been repealed and"
"5731400","5733000"," interest rates just don't matter anymore."
"5733860","5739040"," And I'm just not a believer of those two new era caveats."
"5739920","5746340"," David, people still point to charge that look at household debt relative to personal or disposable"
"5746340","5746920"," income. "
"5747440","5752080"," Are you in the lookout for things to crack first in the household or are more in CRE and corporate"
"5752080","5753160"," CAPX and so forth?"
"5754780","5759500"," Well, I think that it's going to be, it's going to occur in tandem, but it's a great question"
"5759500","5764180"," because I think that business spending is probably going to take it on the chin first."
"5764820","5772100"," And I say that because we do have a large scale debt rollovers in the corporate sector starting"
"5772100","5774480"," this year, but it really cascades in 2025."
"5774820","5777640"," So what's the corporate sector going to do with this profits?"
"5777980","5779220"," It's going to keep it as routine earnings. "
"5779220","5782480"," I think this is going to be a very difficult year for capital spending."
"5782960","5784660"," And then there's arteries of the rest of the economy."
"5784660","5785940"," Like what does that mean for employment?"
"5786800","5791040"," You know, people talked about, you know, the household balance sheet being in great shape, but you"
"5791040","5795280"," know, we look at aggregates, you know, everybody looks at averages, they look at aggregates, you"
"5795280","5796760"," know, aggregates or averages. "
"5796840","5802400"," I mean, between me and Bill Gates, I guess the average is that I'm a billionaire all of a sudden."
"5803220","5808560"," You know, but one thing that I have started to notice for all the talk about how great the consumer"
"5808560","5812980"," balance sheet is, because remember, I said before, change is always at the margin and recessions"
"5812980","5813820"," are not about levels."
"5814080","5815780"," They're about change at the margin. "
"5816280","5821540"," Why are we seeing auto loan delinquency rates go up to the highest level in more than a decade,"
"5821540","5826860"," credit card delinquency rates, highest level in more than a decade, non mortgage personal loan"
"5826860","5833840"," delinquency rates are starting to rise visibly with the unemployment rate below 4%."
"5834460","5840600"," That just shows you all, once again, the bad lending behavior and I guess the bad born behavior"
"5840600","5844260"," that typically takes place when interest rates are held at zero for so long."
"5844900","5848680"," And now the Fed pledging that they're going to keep rates at zero for the perpetuity. "
"5848980","5850380"," Well, that called it and turned out so well."
"5850800","5856000"," But once again, that classic late cycle, reckless lending behavior, it's not on the residential"
"5856000","5859620"," mortgage side this time around, you know, you think lightning doesn't strike twice."
"5860220","5865040"," But for all the talk about how great the household balance sheet is, the pundits out there that"
"5865040","5870960"," promulgate, you know, that basis have to answer the question, why is it with such a tight labor"
"5870960","5878020"," market that delinquency rates across a wide swath of consumer loans are starting to rise"
"5878020","5878920"," inexorably. "
"5879680","5880800"," And where do you go?"
"5881340","5886480"," If they don't point rate times about 4%, or god forbid, goes to four and a half or five, where"
"5886480","5887760"," do these delinquency rates go?"
"5888000","5892860"," So I think it's going to be, I think that you could argue that this will be touched off by"
"5892860","5894820"," capital spending for the reasons I said it earlier."
"5895860","5900920"," But I think people are going to get surprised, surprised at what happens with the consumer in the"
"5900920","5903460"," coming year, especially with the fiscal side."
"5903580","5906400"," Remember, the Republicans are not sorry, sorry to cut you off. "
"5906400","5910260"," It's just interesting because with the delinquencies that we're seeing, you had JP Morgan hitting"
"5910260","5910740"," in all the high interest rates."
"5910740","5916440"," Euro pound falls at zero spot five percent to zero spot eight six to eight to two week low."
"5916440","5921320"," But definitely something to keep an eye on next week when the big banks start reporting their"
"5921320","5921720"," earnings. "
"5921920","5923320"," We really appreciate your perspective today."
"5923440","5924000"," Thank you so much."
"5924100","5924380"," David Rosenberg. "
"5925200","5925900"," Happy new year."
"5926000","5926320"," Take care."
"5927140","5929020"," Got a news alert on Xerox this morning. "
"5929120","5930260"," Let's get the dog shoe with the tails."
"5930520","5930740"," Hey, Don."
"5930860","5931020"," All right. "
"5931140","5934660"," So Carl, those shares of Xerox have been sliding since the opening bell."
"5934660","5937340"," Now it's session lows off roughly nine and a half to 10%."
"5937340","5942200"," The company's announcing a new strategic initiative to streamline its business operations and"
"5942200","5944400"," stabilize its core print business. "
"5944920","5950760"," That plan will unfortunately result in job cuts to around 15% of Xerox's workforce and a newly"
"5950760","5956240"," shuffled executive team to lead three key initiatives, one in core print, one in global business"
"5956240","5958720"," services and one in IT and digital services."
"5959200","5963080"," Carl, the street, not reacting too kindly to the news right now again shares down about nine"
"5963080","5963440"," percent."
"5963760","5964900"," I'll send things back over to you. "
"5965140","5965740"," All right, Don."
"5965940","5966300"," Thanks for that."
"5966560","5969940"," Me time, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on the other side of this break. "
"5969940","5975180"," We'll get his take on some of these expiring EV incentives plus the new investments the"
"5975180","5979280"," government's making to improve airport infrastructure around the country and mortgage demands"
"5979280","5984740"," seeing its biggest weekly decline in almost a year despite the 30-year fixed mortgage rate at May"
"5984740","5985060"," lows."
"5985580","5989460"," Zillow co-found our Spencer Raskoff and gives us his outlook for the housing market."
"5989780","5991520"," Money movers returns after this. "
"6180150","6181890"," Welcome back GM sales members."
"6181890","6183570"," Our outlets get to fill a vote for those."
"6185330","6188310"," Leslie, we are looking at fourth quarter results for General Motors. "
"6188550","6195170"," Sales increasing fractionally of 0.3 percent for the fourth quarter for General Motors, capping a"
"6195170","6196370"," strong year for the company."
"6196890","6203310"," Its U.S. market share increasing three-tenths of a percentage point going up to 16.3 percent for"
"6203310","6204410"," all of 2023."
"6204910","6209990"," One other note from GM sales release, the company is forecasting that the U.S. auto industry"
"6209990","6215030"," overall will hit 16 million vehicles sold for 2024. "
"6215610","6217890"," By the way, 23 best sales since 19."
"6218350","6220690"," They are going to be increasing up to 16 million."
"6220850","6223410"," At least that's the estimate from General Motors for 2024. "
"6223830","6224870"," Guys, back to you."
"6225090","6225370"," All right."
"6225490","6226310"," Well, thank you very much, Philip. "
"6226510","6232150"," Me time, the Transportation Department ended 23 on a high note, airline cancellations at a decade"
"6232150","6232610"," low."
"6232870","6236450"," New rail programs, new low gas prices and improving supply chain."
"6236830","6241570"," 24, though, bringing a full new agenda, tightened regulations for EV tax credits, escalating"
"6241570","6244990"," tensions in the Red Sea, of course, while juggling an election year. "
"6245350","6248510"," Joining us first on CNBC this morning is the Transportation Secretary."
"6248790","6249550"," Thank you, Judge."
"6249730","6251670"," Mr. Secretary, great to have you. "
"6251910","6254630"," I guess first question is what accounts for this cancellation rate?"
"6255530","6259290"," Well, you know, we've been pushing the airlines hard, especially after what we saw about a year and"
"6259290","6264290"," a half ago, where even on days when the weather was fine, there were unacceptable levels of"
"6264290","6265690"," cancellations and disruptions."
"6266450","6268350"," We pressed them on realistic scheduling."
"6268650","6269970"," We pressed them on staffing. "
"6270610","6274750"," And we made sure that we took steps that were under our own responsibility, especially with things"
"6274750","6280310"," that the FAA could have some control over, like improving the routes that aircraft are allowed to"
"6280310","6284830"," fly on, deconflicting parts of the Florida airspace, where there's a lot of competition for the"
"6284830","6287030"," airspace with space launches and military activity."
"6287490","6293370"," All of that has added up into a dramatically better picture last year than the year before."
"6293870","6298890"," Matter of fact, as you noted, it's a 10-year low in terms of the cancellation rate. "
"6299050","6300770"," Now, we're not sitting comfortably with that."
"6300890","6302490"," It's going to take a lot to keep that up."
"6302630","6306450"," We're also turning our attention to delays and driving the rate of delays further down. "
"6306650","6313790"," But I think this does reflect major improvement in the flexibility and the fluidity of our national"
"6313790","6317690"," airspace at a time, by the way, where we're seeing huge volumes."
"6317690","6323030"," Matter of fact, some of the holidays last year, like Thanksgiving and the summer holidays, had all "
"6323030","6326850","-time record highs in terms of the number of passengers streamed by TSA."
"6327250","6330470"," The Sunday after Thanksgiving was the most recorded in American history. "
"6330730","6335790"," So really pleased to see these dramatic improvements in performance by the airlines here."
"6335790","6343570"," Is the collision in Japan in the last 24 hours important to watch instructive for what ground"
"6343570","6345090"," safety may mean at airports here?"
"6345750","6349110"," Yeah, any time we see an incident anywhere in the world, we pay attention."
"6349450","6350590"," FAA pays close attention. "
"6350930","6353170"," Obviously, that's something that should never happen."
"6353710","6358450"," We have the safest, most complex airspace in the world here in the U.S. If you think about it,"
"6358450","6365410"," it's an astonishing fact that this is the safest means of travel available in the U.S. In order to"
"6365410","6370530"," keep it that way, that means any time there is a crash anywhere in the world or never mind a"
"6370530","6373430"," crash, any time there's a close call, we're paying close attention."
"6373830","6378890"," I mean, our definition of a close call sometimes includes an airplane coming half a mile away from"
"6378890","6380490"," another airplane when it shouldn't have. "
"6380770","6383590"," That's enough to get our attention lead to an after-action review."
"6384070","6389210"," And so we're going to continue pushing with safety being the top focus of our new FAA"
"6389210","6393870"," administrator, Michael Whitaker, who was confirmed late last year by the Senate."
"6394410","6396350"," Secretary Buttigieg, it's Leslie Picker here. "
"6396750","6400810"," There have been so many headlines this year about these near-miss collisions."
"6402230","6408490"," And the alarming rise therein, any color you can share in terms of why that has been rising and"
"6408490","6417990"," what your administration is doing to thwart them in the future."
"6417990","6421630"," We need to make sure the system is able to keep up with that. "
"6421850","6428310"," And in some ways, a testament to the safety of our system is it's not like car crashes, where"
"6428310","6432990"," there's thousands of them, hundreds of fatalities a day, and we're sifting through the data to"
"6432990","6439630"," learn from that, with aviation, in the absence of commercial airliner crashes, we pay attention to"
"6439630","6445390"," near-misses as if they had been, because that's really where we can get the data on what the system"
"6445930","6447170"," needs to see going forward."
"6447590","6450890"," We saw a number of different issues, some of them on the part of pilots, some of them on the"
"6450890","6453950"," part of air traffic control, some of them on the part of ground crews."
"6454350","6459730"," And the real focus now is making sure we have the technology, the staffing, the equipment, and the"
"6459730","6461670"," training to prevent these from happening. "
"6461950","6466230"," I do need to mention that a big part of this is growing our ATC workforce."
"6466850","6468390"," It's been on the decline for decades."
"6468690","6472730"," If you look at the number of air traffic controllers, it's gone down and down and down, which means"
"6472730","6474790"," the controllers we have are overworked. "
"6475070","6476190"," We've finally changed that."
"6476350","6480290"," The numbers going up are finally hiring faster than we have departures."
"6480670","6484930"," But one thing that would stop us in our tracks is if we had to shut down the air traffic"
"6484930","6486570"," control academy because of a shutdown. "
"6486990","6491830"," It's one of about a thousand reasons why America cannot afford a government shutdown this month."
"6492470","6496070"," One of the things the streets have been struggling with in the last couple of quarters has been"
"6496070","6498270"," what appears to be a slowdown in EV demand."
"6499850","6501750"," We talked about low gas prices. "
"6502090","6507130"," You've got any theories as to why the adoption curve may not be what some forecasted a couple of"
"6507130","6507490"," years ago?"
"6508170","6509970"," Yeah, I mean, at the outset, I want to make clear."
"6510130","6510730"," It's still growing."
"6510750","6512450"," It's just a matter of the rate of growth. "
"6512690","6514590"," But we are seeing it go through some ups and downs."
"6514930","6520190"," We need to make sure that we keep pushing the upfront cost, the sticker price, of EVs into a range"
"6520190","6525110"," where more and more Americans feel like it's to their benefit and feel confident making that"
"6525110","6525410"," choice."
"6525810","6527870"," But we know that there are going to be some fluctuations. "
"6528090","6533070"," We also have to make sure there's the charging infrastructure to support that for long road trips."
"6533350","6538790"," And simultaneously, we need to make sure that there's a level of education domestically about the"
"6538790","6541990"," charging capacity many people already have and don't know it."
"6542110","6547450"," What I mean by that is a majority of Americans live in a single family home where they might be"
"6547450","6551970"," surprised to realize that all you need technically for charging infrastructure is a plug in the"
"6551970","6552130"," wall. "
"6552310","6555510"," Of course, some people might get a level two charger or something that's a little faster."
"6555910","6561230"," But a lot of people have more capacity than they already realize for charging these EVs."
"6561730","6563290"," So all of those are going to be a factor. "
"6563450","6567430"," The cost, the charging, there's no question that the industry has headed this way."
"6567730","6572230"," Our focus as an administration is making sure that it's an America-led industry."
"6572410","6576630"," It's why we have these strict requirements that are getting stricter each year in terms of how you"
"6576630","6578430"," qualify for those EV tax credits. "
"6578850","6582850"," And it's why we have a whole policy focused on making sure that the next generation of great auto"
"6582850","6588950"," jobs are right here in America, just like the generation of auto jobs that created communities like"
"6588950","6590190"," the town I grew up in in Indiana."
"6591030","6595110"," As we think about the supply chain, there's been so much attention on the Red Sea just this"
"6595110","6595450"," morning."
"6595470","6601790"," The Houthis are claiming yet another attack on a container ship in a very critical shipping route"
"6601790","6602230"," there. "
"6602870","6609290"," What are you seeing in terms of your conversations with shippers and their willingness to go"
"6609290","6614510"," through that route given just the the Navy presence that has been there and the international"
"6614510","6618290"," effort to ensure that the passageway is safe?"
"6619010","6622450"," Yeah, we're talking about a key global shipping route here."
"6622670","6626010"," And anytime you see that kind of instability, that that's a major concern."
"6626290","6628330"," Our department's talking to shippers every day. "
"6628670","6632670"," Of course, the department of defense has the lead on the military side of this."
"6632990","6638350"," We're engaging shippers who are in many cases looking at alternatives, even if that adds days and"
"6638350","6644650"," dollars to a shipment just so that they don't have to face that kind of concern and instability."
"6645070","6650950"," For those that do, of course, the Navy has been there and there's a multinational effort to see to"
"6650950","6651950"," their safety and security. "
"6652310","6657610"," But needless to say, for this supply chain or any supply chain, the less you have that kind of"
"6657610","6662750"," activity, the more we can have political or geopolitical stability, the better it's going to be for"
"6662750","6666370"," our supply chains all the way here to the prices that we're paying on the shelf here at home."
"6666850","6672050"," Would you argue, Mr. Secretary, if we went back to a period where supply chains were as challenged"
"6672050","6676710"," as they were coming out of COVID, that the playbook, the American playbook and response has been"
"6676710","6679370"," refined, that response would be different than it was then?"
"6680030","6681310"," You know, it's a great question."
"6681510","6685470"," I think we've learned a lot of lessons from what happened two or three years ago. "
"6685710","6692350"," But honestly, we haven't fully digested them because we have to really rebuild our machinery, so to"
"6692350","6693050"," speak, around this."
"6693410","6694870"," Companies are doing that, shippers are doing that."
"6694870","6696950"," Customers and cargo owners are doing that. "
"6697210","6700570"," We're investing in more and better port capacity around the country."
"6700770","6703150"," It's one of the parts of the president's infrastructure plan."
"6703350","6707510"," It probably doesn't get enough attention as what we've been doing at everything from some of the"
"6707510","6711830"," biggest ports in the country, like L.A. Long Beach, to some small ports along the Mississippi River"
"6711830","6713830"," that are really important part of our supply chain. "
"6714310","6719650"," I think moving forward, we're going to see more attention to friend shoring, more focus on on"
"6719650","6723010"," shoring, which can obviously make a big difference here."
"6723010","6726170"," But we also just need to make sure that we have the right kind of data and information."
"6726490","6733290"," It is not that the data sharing that goes on in shipping is not nearly as fluid as people would"
"6733290","6733590"," assume. "
"6733970","6738750"," We're working on that with a newly created freight office here at the USDOT, and really appreciate"
"6738750","6743510"," a lot of private sector players that have come to the table willing to share data in a way that's"
"6743510","6747310"," appropriate and obviously not sharing data that shouldn't be shared."
"6747550","6752070"," But just getting more information so people can predict the ups and downs and make good business"
"6752070","6755450"," decisions based on that instead of responding and being reactive."
"6756230","6760010"," And finally, Mr. Secretary, you mentioned earlier the potential for a shutdown. "
"6760330","6763430"," I know we're looking at several funding cliffs in the next few weeks."
"6764110","6769130"," Based on my colleagues reporting in Washington, there isn't even a top-level number that they've"
"6769130","6772370"," agreed upon in Congress to come up with these budgets."
"6772910","6781770"," What's your concern as you look at the efficiency that we're seeing in the financial damage there?"
"6782670","6788190"," Look, imagine running a business and not knowing whether a certain day, two or three weeks from"
"6788190","6789770"," now, you're going to have to shut down completely. "
"6790090","6791430"," That would consume your attention."
"6791950","6797750"," And a lot of time, a lot of money was wasted during the run up to the unnecessary shutdown"
"6797750","6799110"," countdown that happened in October."
"6799670","6802110"," Thankfully, we got through that without a shutdown happening. "
"6802250","6803970"," But now it feels like here we are again."
"6804650","6805210"," It's not needed."
"6805530","6810330"," All we're asking House Republicans to do is honor the deal that was made last year, but between"
"6810330","6811490"," them and the president. "
"6812050","6818090"," Because this really is a politically manufactured crisis that would have very real consequences for"
"6818090","6824150"," our economy, for so many hardworking public servants and military members around the country, and"
"6824150","6828550"," for things like our transportation systems, that are finally moving in a direction where we're"
"6828550","6830930"," seeing better performance, more fluidity."
"6831070","6836830"," The last thing we would want to do is throw a wrench in the works with an extreme Republican "
"6836830","6842990","-driven, House-driven shutdown that really, I don't think is necessary for anyone's policy goals, a"
"6842990","6845510"," conservative liberal or in between, to be mad."
"6845670","6850110"," It just doesn't make sense to play these kinds of games with the American economy. "
"6851070","6855330"," Well, from airlines to EVs to the ports to funding, we covered a lot."
"6855790","6856990"," I really appreciate it, Mr. Secretary."
"6857330","6857670"," Thank you. "
"6858190","6858710"," Pete Buttigieg."
"6859110","6860190"," Good to be with you."
"6860350","6860450"," Thanks. "
"6861070","6861790"," Thank you."

"7094070","7097170"," A couple hours into trading, just coming off a session, Lowe's."
"7097250","7098750"," Let's get post-to-post with Bob Bassanik."
"7098930","7099110"," Hey, Bob. "
"7099410","7100350"," You know, Carl, unusual."
"7100870","7102370"," Two down days to start the year."
"7102510","7103430"," That doesn't happen very often. "
"7103430","7105430"," Now, there's two moves people are continuing to buy."
"7105690","7106770"," I mentioned this yesterday."
"7107330","7108310"," Energy and health care. "
"7108550","7109570"," There's marathon petroleum."
"7110270","7112130"," Big refiners, up about 6 percent."
"7112250","7113790"," Exxon's been up the last couple of days. "
"7114090","7116610"," That's a group, the other group moving health care."
"7117070","7120330"," We're seeing Merck move, Pfizer move up."
"7120410","7122130"," These stocks all had a tough time last year. "
"7122270","7123090"," So that's the two groups."
"7123350","7126210"," Other than that, though, pretty thin pickings on the bullish side here."
"7126350","7130430"," So the banks, the regional banks like Sinovis, they started going up a couple of weeks ago. "
"7130570","7132110"," They really hadn't participated in the rally."
"7132390","7135050"," It's called that sideways for the last couple of weeks."
"7135290","7136090"," Got to keep an eye on that. "
"7136370","7137210"," Consumer discretionary."
"7137510","7139010"," Big moves up in November, December."
"7139250","7140390"," I kept putting up all the cruise lines. "
"7140670","7142430"," That window region was up 50 percent last year."
"7142510","7143690"," But look at this, down 4 percent."
"7143850","7144730"," It was down big yesterday. "
"7145070","7147670"," It's down 11 or 12 percent the last couple of days."
"7147670","7150410"," So discretionary sectors are losing a little steam."
"7150570","7151890"," And then, of course, you know about tech. "
"7152130","7153170"," You didn't need an apple downgrade."
"7153630","7155130"," They were selling right across the board yesterday."
"7155130","7157270"," There's Taiwan semi-trades right here. "
"7157410","7160810"," That's been down probably 4 percent so far this week."
"7161130","7166050"," So the bottom line is the S&P 500 is heading for two down days on the beginning of the"
"7166050","7166210"," year."
"7166290","7168370"," That hasn't happened since 2015. "
"7168850","7170930"," So it's a little unusual to see that."
"7171050","7172890"," In the Santa Claus rally, we keep talking about that."
"7172950","7173730"," That's really in trouble. "
"7174110","7178490"," That's the tendency for stocks to rise in the last five days of the old year, the first two."
"7178670","7179330"," So it ends today."
"7179370","7180330"," This is seven days. "
"7180730","7181710"," And so far, look at this."
"7182010","7183130"," We're down 0.7 percent."
"7183630","7186250"," Now, fortunately, it doesn't fail that often. "
"7186430","7188310"," Usually, you get a rally in these seven days."
"7188490","7190390"," So it's only about 22 percent of the time it fails."
"7190990","7197390"," The tendency when it fails is for the year ahead to be subpar, typically, not necessarily down but"
"7197390","7197910"," subpar. "
"7198030","7198930"," That's what goes on here."
"7199390","7203710"," We also have the January barometer as goes January, so it goes the year."
"7203810","7204330"," We're starting that. "
"7204430","7205790"," That is a pretty good accuracy rate."
"7205970","7207090"," That's about 84 percent."
"7207510","7209130"," That's the stock trader's all-man act number. "
"7209230","7209850"," We'll keep an eye on that."
"7210010","7214130"," Finally, the most interesting thing to me about 2024 is what I call the political barometer."
"7214570","7219830"," In years when there is a sitting president, the S&P tends to outperform because the president has"
"7219830","7222190"," various levers they can pull to help the economy out. "
"7222530","7227570"," The S&P has been up every single year when there has been a sitting president in an election year"
"7227570","7228790"," since 1944."
"7229250","7234050"," Every single time, there was 16 times this happened, every single time the S&P has been up."
"7234350","7240330"," And by the way, Leslie, there are a lot of global elections this year, over 40 of them, including"
"7240330","7242910"," Mexico and India, Pakistan. "
"7243510","7244870"," There's a bunch of elections in Europe."
"7245050","7249610"," And what that means is, well, politicians could pull levers to help the economy, but they can also"
"7249610","7253430"," make controversial statements to gain votes there."
"7253610","7257670"," So a little bit of a reward and a lot of risk out there, as well, in the elections this"
"7257670","7257890"," year. "
"7258030","7258130"," Leslie?"
"7258350","7262530"," Yeah, Bob, we heard from Gerald Kronk last hour who said, expect more equity volatility this year."
"7263290","7266430"," Last year, rates of volatility this year, equity volatility."
"7266770","7267770"," So we'll see if that holds true. "
"7268150","7270210"," But you laid it out so nicely for us."
"7270290","7270650"," Thank you, Bob."
"7270750","7270990"," Okay. "
"7271710","7272990"," Time now for a news update."
"7273250","7274550"," We're at the Coons has that for us for that."
"7274770","7275390"," Hi, Leslie. "
"7275750","7280590"," House Republicans plan to start impeachment proceedings against Secretary of Homeland Security"
"7280590","7282970"," Alejandro Mayorkas next week."
"7283330","7289050"," A spokesperson for the House Homeland Security Committee confirmed the move to NBC News today."
"7289470","7292490"," The first hearing is set to take place January 10th. "
"7292890","7299520"," House Republicans claim Mayorkas has mishandled the migrant crisis at the U.S. but Homeland"
"7299520","7305900"," Security officials call the impeachment push a waste of valuable time and taxpayer dollars."
"7306580","7312820"," The European Union targeted the world's biggest diamond mining company and its CEO today in its"
"7312820","7315160"," latest war sanctions against Russia."
"7315800","7319480"," The move will freeze a lot of Al-Rosa's assets in Europe. "
"7319980","7324440"," The sanctions are in addition to a previously instituted import band on Russian diamonds."
"7325440","7329820"," And Starbucks customers on the go will now be able to bring their own cops."
"7330420","7331800"," The copy giant amounts today. "
"7332020","7337720"," Personal cops will now be allowed for all visits, including drive-through and mobile orders."
"7338020","7341720"," Starbucks says it will reduce the amount of cops sent to landfill."
"7342340","7347440"," I'm not sure how you order ahead with your own cop unless they store it for you. "
"7347940","7349360"," I don't think they do that."
"7349540","7354020"," I think there's like a pre-measured amount that you give that they pour into your cup."
"7354320","7356700"," But yeah, a lot of questions, more questions than answers. "
"7357840","7359320"," Birthday thanks, birthday coups."
"7359540","7362960"," Coming up next, luxury real estate was a rare bright spot in 2023."
"7363080","7363900"," But can that continue?"
"7364580","7366540"," More good rates at the lowest level since May. "
"7367100","7369880"," Zillow's co-founder Spencer Raskoff is with us after the break."
"7572920","7574100"," Welcome back to my reverse."
"7574400","7578660"," Let's talk housing luxury real estate was a rare bright spot in 2023. "
"7578900","7580860"," But can it continue in 2024?"
"7581440","7584200"," Robert Frank is here with us for more on that."
"7584360","7584720"," Hi, Robert."
"7586140","7591300"," It was a good morning Manhattan home prices rising for the first time in over a year driven largely"
"7591300","7592680"," by the high end. "
"7592840","7597800"," Median sales prices rose 5% in the fourth quarter to $1.16 million."
"7598300","7600280"," That's according to Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel."
"7600760","7605440"," The average price for a Manhattan apartment also increased to just over $2 million. "
"7606340","7609400"," The total number of sales fell due to a lack of inventory."
"7609920","7615240"," The sales volume dropping 6% in the quarter and it fell 29% for the year."
"7615780","7620260"," But sales above $5 million, that's sort of the middle to high end of Manhattan. "
"7620700","7622120"," Those increased in the quarter."
"7622560","7623980"," Most of those are wealthy buyers."
"7624200","7627600"," Of course, they pay in cash so they're not as reliant on mortgage rates. "
"7628340","7631740"," Two thirds of all apartments sold in Manhattan were all cash."
"7632180","7633840"," That marked an all-time record."
"7634420","7638180"," Nationwide, the ultra high end held up fairly well last year. "
"7638560","7642540"," There were 34 homes sold in the US for more than $50 million."
"7643500","7646260"," And five of them were sold for over $100 million."
"7647020","7649720"," Most of those were in Palm Beach, the Hamptons and Connecticut. "
"7650080","7656400"," The most expensive deal of the year was that $190 million sale of an oceanfront home in Malibu"
"7656400","7659720"," bought by none other than Jay-Z and Beyonce."
"7659860","7663820"," It had been listed for $295 million."
"7664480","7666920"," So in their mind, they saved $100 million. "
"7667620","7668520"," They got a bargain."
"7668920","7670260"," Do they pay all cash or was that?"
"7670260","7670720"," They got a bargain."
"7671820","7673300"," They take out a mortgage for that one. "
"7673420","7674140"," We don't know."
"7674360","7675620"," I think they could have."
"7675780","7678660"," I think if anyone could pay cash, Jay-Z and Beyonce could. "
"7678920","7679580"," They could do it."
"7679720","7681780"," For that ocean side, Malibu home, indeed."
"7682180","7683880"," Robert Frank, thank you. "
"7684400","7689220"," Sticking with the housing market application volume was down 9.4% last week compared with the two"
"7689220","7689800"," weeks prior."
"7690320","7693440"," Mortgage demand seeing its biggest decline since February 2023."
"7693440","7698880"," Our next guest, more optimistic, though, as rates continue to take down and believe sellers will"
"7698880","7701360"," lose patience and finally start listing. "
"7701680","7707960"," Joining us now, Zillow co-founder and former CEO and 75 and Sunny Venture CEO Spencer Raskoff."
"7708200","7709400"," Spencer, thank you for being here."
"7709540","7710080"," Happy New Year. "
"7710860","7715540"," So I'm looking at the 10-year kind of hovering right around that 4% levels or any psychological"
"7717140","7721460"," implications for 4% as it pertains to mortgage rates."
"7721460","7729880"," I guess it's still below the peaks that we saw earlier in 2023, but significantly from the prior"
"7729880","7730300"," few weeks."
"7731000","7731500"," Yeah. "
"7731620","7736220"," I mean, last week's mortgage application data was kind of an oddity because of the holidays."
"7736220","7738000"," I wouldn't put too much stock into it."
"7738280","7743120"," To take a step back, I would describe 2023 for housing as pretty grim. "
"7743260","7744420"," It was basically a frozen market."
"7744660","7747080"," We had 4.3 million homes sold last year."
"7747340","7752820"," That was down 14% from the prior year, down 30% from 2021, and it was the lowest sales"
"7752820","7753860"," volume in 12 years. "
"7754100","7755020"," So pretty slow."
"7755360","7757520"," And that's because of high mortgage rates and low inventory."
"7758400","7759660"," This year is going to be a little bit better. "
"7759860","7763880"," So first of all, you should know, though, buyers are still going to have a pretty tough"
"7763880","7764840"," affordability environment."
"7765120","7769940"," So Zillow data shows that the average home buyers spending about 40% of their income on housing."
"7770440","7775240"," I wrote a book eight or nine years ago called Zillow Talk in which I said that the 50 year"
"7775240","7779020"," rule of thumb was don't spend more than 30% of your income and housing. "
"7779020","7781380"," And now the average person is spending 40%."
"7781380","7785840"," So clearly, we're spending more on housing because of high rates, but rates are coming down."
"7786320","7787260"," So they've already peaked. "
"7787280","7789660"," They were already in the 89% range in October."
"7790160","7791260"," Now they're six to seven."
"7791700","7794640"," Redfin predicts 6.5, 6.6 by the end of the year. "
"7794640","7797340"," realtor.com predicts low sixes by the end of the year."
"7797960","7803000"," What we're also seeing, though, and a sign for optimism in the housing market is more house"
"7803000","7803340"," hacking."
"7803820","7809580"," So this is people finding creative ways to drive affordability in a world of low inventory and high"
"7809580","7809920"," rates. "
"7810540","7813540"," And one common way to do that now is through co-ownership."
"7813960","7816480"," And so that's why Picasso, my company is growing so quickly."
"7816580","7818580"," We're now in 40 markets in five countries. "
"7818680","7824080"," We passed a billion of sales, co-buying, especially in vacation destinations, is a really"
"7824080","7828180"," attractive way to house hack and get your way into a market that you might be priced out of"
"7828180","7828500"," otherwise."
"7829380","7833900"," Other tactics buyers are doing like like finding alternative destinations."
"7834760","7841180"," So Mount Rose, Nevada, for example, instead of Reno Tahoe, Bald Island, North Carolina, instead of"
"7841180","7844980"," Kiawa, South Carolina, Golden Colorado, instead of Vale and Aspen. "
"7845180","7849860"," So Picasso data shows a lot of these secondary markets are stealing share from these primary"
"7849860","7852280"," markets that more and more people are getting priced out of."
"7852500","7856120"," Yeah, affordability, obviously still a very key component here."
"7856500","7861520"," And you mentioned patience being the key that could unlock some of the freezing of the markets that"
"7861520","7862020"," you're seeing. "
"7863060","7864660"," What changes patience?"
"7865080","7866380"," I mean, we've seen two years of this."
"7866420","7872120"," What ultimately if rates are kind of near these levels for the foreseeable future, what ultimately"
"7872120","7878440"," changes the patience equation for folks that gets them kind of out of their homes and a little bit"
"7878440","7879680"," more movement on the supply front?"
"7880040","7883860"," Well, there's a lot of psychology, obviously, in all markets, but especially in the housing market."
"7884220","7887960"," And the more time passes, the more people are getting used to five, six, seven percent mortgage"
"7887960","7888200"," rates. "
"7888220","7894300"," So at first, it seemed like a total sticker shock a year ago when after five years of zero to"
"7894300","7898020"," three percent mortgage rates, all of a sudden we were seeing rates in the six, seven, eight percent"
"7898020","7898440"," range."
"7898980","7900320"," Now we've had a little time to adjust."
"7900320","7903960"," They have come down that's starting to generate more and more interest. "
"7904240","7907920"," So I think we'll we'll see a much better spring in terms of sale to volume as compared with a"
"7907920","7908360"," year ago."
"7908780","7911960"," The other big change that you're going to see is new inventory coming online."
"7912560","7915640"," So first of all, you'll see new single family rental inventory. "
"7915880","7919280"," These are owners that don't want to sell because they don't want to give up their low mortgage"
"7919280","7921360"," rate, but they're going to be willing to rent out their home."
"7921520","7923440"," And then you have a huge supply of apartments."
"7923680","7928180"," CBRE says that there are over a million units of apartments coming online this year. "
"7928180","7935800"," And as a result, Yardi predicts only 1.5 percent rent increases for rentals that compares with 10"
"7935800","7938700"," to 15 percent rent increases over each of the last two years."
"7938960","7943200"," So more inventory coming online, that's good news for people, good news for buyers, also good news"
"7943200","7943500"," for renters."
"7944100","7949240"," You know, one of the one of the dreams of housing bowl Spencer is that the the boomer generation is"
"7949240","7950220"," going to start to downsize. "
"7950400","7955360"," And they don't care about interest rates because they're going to use their equity to pay cash for"
"7955360","7955880"," something else."
"7956160","7960780"," Is that legit or is that going to be such a slow moving process that you can't really count on"
"7960780","7960880"," it?"
"7961340","7962760"," No, I do think that's legit."
"7963040","7966780"," I mean Picasso is already seeing that in the data where where people are moving. "
"7966780","7971740"," And again, it's partly it's about the psychology of adapting to lower rates and now saying, okay,"
"7971800","7973720"," I'm not in the house that's right for me anymore."
"7974160","7976760"," Many Americans are not in the house that's right for them."
"7976980","7981920"," They're kind of stuck because they have two, three and four percent rates, which are great, but it"
"7981920","7983920"," keeps them in the longer right for them. "
"7984200","7985620"," And so that's true of boomers."
"7985840","7988140"," It's true of other generations as well."
"7988680","7991760"," That's going to become unstuck as people start to adjust to lower rates. "
"7991840","7992720"," More inventory comes online."
"7993120","7994780"," So yes, I do think that's a real trend, Carl."
"7995560","7996000"," Fascinating. "
"7996320","7998260"," Spencer Raskoff, thank you very much."
"7998260","8000780"," And house hacking is a term I learned."
"8001260","8002960"," It doesn't mean people are breaking into your home bill. "
"8003100","8003880"," So that's reassuring."
"8005500","8006640"," Spencer, thanks."

"8766590","8772690"," what does that mean in terms of kind of the normalization efforts that we saw prior to October 7th"

"8879710","8888450"," with tech it's your own personal reshuffle you buy ExxonMobil you buy Bristol Myers two areas of"
"8888450","8893990"," the market that were disappointing last year yeah energy and health care and you're going in why"
"8893990","8897430"," mean reversion I think you're going to see it I think you're going to continue to see the"
"8897430","8902950"," broadening out like we have been seeing since October the lows we saw the S&P equal weight"
"8902950","8908870"," outperform the S&P market Catholic by 200 basis points yesterday was much of the same and I just"
"8908870","8913390"," think I'm a very big believer in mean reversion that's not to say I think tech is going to crash"
"8913390","8917630"," I don't I still own a lot of tech we're going to talk about that later but I just think"
"8917630","8923810"," there are some opportunities are presenting themselves I haven't owned ExxonMobil in probably 10"
"8923810","8928070"," years well because you were chevron I was chevron which you sold too because you got fed up with"
"8928070","8934470"," that yeah I you know what Exxon has done such a better job in the last couple of years in"
"8934470","8940570"," terms of execution in terms of M&A I love this pioneer deal I'm sure Joe has an opinion on"
"8940570","8950450"," that as well um they're going to be the number one player in about there's a lot more"
"8950450","8956230"," volatility there um this stock trades at five and a half times forward estimates the long-term"
"8956230","8962690"," average is at 7.9 times again a nice dividend yield as well so down four percent yesterday last"
"8962690","8967050"," year rather Scott I think we can see you know if I think energy is going to rally this year"
"8967050","8972950"," again as a mean reversion trade as a sector as a whole and I want to own Exxon because it's"
"8972950","8978950"," 22 percent of the XLE as well people will be buying Exxon and chevron as well right and I also"
"8978950","8985390"," own slumber J and diamondback energy first of all we talked about this a couple weeks ago you have"
"8985390","8991210"," J&J I have J&J you've lagged into energy a little bit more of late so why does this"
"8991210","8996430"," make sense as part of that well again also mean reversion and I had been buying a lot of J "
"8996430","9000470","&J over the last month in fact in fact offline we were talking about health care and the past month"
"9000470","9005570"," is probably the area where I've allocated the most in terms of a set a new sector and so I'm"
"9005570","9010710"," getting close actually to market weight but these are really concentrated portfolios in terms of"
"9010710","9016030"," positioning within the portfolio rather this has a this stock was down 36 percent last year it"
"9016030","9020030"," trades at seven times forward estimates it has one of the highest dividend yields four and a half"
"9020030","9027470"," percent in the sector and they've got a bundle of cash too really good balance she very little debt"
"9027470","9031230"," what I what I think it's going to take it's going to take some time to see this play out"
"9031230","9035290"," because a lot of their drugs are going off patent in the next couple of years but that's why we're"
"9035290","9041490"," seeing so much M&A from the company in fact since 2000 they've been on a spending spree since 2019"
"9041490","9047310"," they have spent a hundred and nineteen billion dollars on M&A to replenish that pipe yeah well time"
"9047310","9052230"," since two weeks ago oh yeah no I know three deals I know and and and that was I kind"
"9052230","9055410"," of caught my eye and that's what we talked about remember I sold Nike and I said I have a"
"9055410","9059850"," little cash on the sidelines then they did this other deal and I was thinking to myself it's so"
"9059850","9065110"," cheap it's so hated it's only going to grow revenues and earnings low single digits that's not"
"9065110","9070610"," glamorous by any means but I do think as these new products take hold you will see a kind of"
"9070610","9075690"," a resurgence of interest in this in this name and again it's just so down and out at this point"
"9075690","9085090"," okay so does this reshuffle or you know whatever you want to characterize it as it's not"
"9085090","9090590"," necessarily a rotation because a lot of stuff is red but Nasdaq's down more than everything else"
"9090590","9098370"," again does this have legs and if so for how long I think the important question you have to ask"
"9098370","9103550"," yourself is well does this have legs and for how long potentially yeah I think it feels like it"
"9103550","9110210"," does right it feels like this could extend into earning season and earning season reverses it or"
"9110210","9117190"," potentially on Friday we get a really bad unemployment report that sends the 10 year back towards"
"9117190","9121890"," last Wednesday's low at 3.79 and then in fact I think you'll see a little bit of a rally"
"9121890","9127310"," but I think the bigger question is what do you want to do with a market that's selling off"
"9127310","9132790"," aggressively at the beginning of the year you know do you want to treat that market as an"
"9132790","9138490"," opportunity to and to risk or do you want to continue to trim and we talked about yesterday"
"9138490","9145810"," tripping in the areas of the market where in 2023 you saw the outsized gains and where the market"
"9145810","9151550"," is technically overbought a lot of those were semis some of the mega caps I mean I look at you"
"9151550","9156410"," know what I just go back to Kramer's commentary yesterday morning where there's like trim across"
"9156410","9165570"," the board because so much was up so much so late that a lot of stuff got extended it's just"
"9165570","9172830"," the valuations and the multiples of the mega caps are the ones that jumped out the most okay so I"
"9172830","9177770"," disagree with that I like what Stephanie's doing I like being tactical and identifying I don't"
"9177770","9186150"," think anything has changed from the Q4 narrative that you're getting rate relief that the potential"
"9186150","9191210"," is there for taking the hard landing off the table and getting the soft landing and then you get"
"9191210","9196490"," the broadening out of the market and you find the opportunity like Stephanie is in a Bristol Myers"
"9196490","9202330"," you find the opportunity in some of the energy names you can find opportunities in the financials"
"9202330","9209930"," themselves and I think on a pullback here like you have over the first two trading days of 2024 you"
"9209930","9216410"," want to look to add risk into those areas of the market where they were neglected in 2023."
"9216670","9222850"," I think the GDP is running hotter than expected at about 2.6 percent is the latest number from"
"9222850","9228030"," Atlanta Fed Tracker so 2.3 percent doesn't really matter but I think that translates into pretty"
"9228030","9233050"," good earnings on the top line and then as we've talked about margins as inflation has come down"
"9233050","9237250"," input costs have come down I think the margins are going to hold in better and I think that's"
"9237250","9242750"," what's going on here and also lower interest rates so lower funding costs as well for corporations"
"9242750","9246570"," and so I think earnings and the reality that earnings are going to be better than expected not just"
"9246570","9251890"," for MAG7 but for all of these other sectors right I mean look ExxonMobil their break even cash"
"9251890","9256690"," break even is a 35 dollars I mean they're minting money at this point right and so they are doing"
"9256690","9261170"," M&A and they are doing buybacks and all kinds of shareholder value creation that's going to happen"
"9261170","9266790"," with a lot of the other 493 companies that didn't get respect in 2023."
"9266970","9270910"," So we just had a stat I think it was the first time that the we just showed at the"
"9270910","9275790"," bottom of the swing first time the S&P has led the year with back-to-back losses since 2015"
"9275790","9284210"," as I think what I read is that just because we had Bryn such a strong move into the end"
"9284210","9288810"," of the year we should we not read anything more into what's taking place over these first trading"
"9288810","9289710"," days of 2024. "
"9290650","9295950"," Well I mean history will tell you as goes the first week goes the first month goes the first year"
"9295950","9301650"," so I do think you have to read into what happens this week because that's just not an adage there"
"9301650","9307470"," is some history to that I think though from a positioning perspective we obviously talk a lot about"
"9307470","9312330"," the megacap to me what you're really seeing the selling pressure and really have to think through"
"9312330","9318750"," allocation or in these small and mid-cap growth names if I look at like an ARKK as like overall"
"9318750","9325950"," ETF but like a square a unity a lot of those names Scott are down 15 percent in three days"
"9325950","9331650"," and so to me that's where you're really seeing a lot of money coming out because those were very"
"9331650","9336430"," very short yet short covering and you had the feds you had the market saying six to seven rate cuts"
"9336430","9341010"," I've always believed that I think that six to seven rate cuts is too aggressive and so you're"
"9341010","9348410"," seeing a lot of money coming out of that I think once the CTAs who've been very levered long let's"
"9348410","9353310"," see what happens with that that should cause some more pressure but I agree with Joe the narrative"
"9353310","9358130"," for the year I mean we're in a presidential cycle that's positive the soft landing is still in"
"9358130","9363110"," place so I think that really you have some repositioning especially within those small and mid-cap"
"9363110","9368870"," growth names but I love Steph's moves though I think that these companies were to me with"
"9368870","9373910"," consistent with Steph's move have a very high free cash flow yield and to me that's going to be a"
"9373910","9380230"," consistent narrative over the year of being able to generate returns outside of these seven names"
"9380230","9386410"," that we we we spend a lot of time talking about of the of the seven names though Bryn I"
"9386410","9393510"," guess the central question is how much do mega cap multiples need to correct we we need to figure"
"9393510","9398990"," out what the right answer is before we know what the story of those stocks is going to be when"
"9398990","9406330"," I tell you that and we did this some of this yesterday but you know a year ago Apple's valuation"
"9406330","9410770"," was 20 and a half now it's 27 and a half now yesterday it was more than that but it's"
"9410770","9416090"," it's down obviously again the 10 year average is near it's less than 19 there are a lot of stocks"
"9416090","9422290"," in that boat Microsoft a year ago 23 today it's 30 the 10 year average is 23 so how much"
"9422290","9429190"," more do those multiples need to correct you got to be really careful multiples are a terrible"
"9429190","9435030"," metric for timing I everybody keeps saying that I know I hear you I heard that I heard that two"
"9435030","9441070"," or three times yesterday as well but the but the bottom line is yeah if there's a view that these"
"9441070","9445950"," multiples are extended they need to correct to something before people deem that they're going to"
"9445950","9450690"," jump in and buy the dip well I think you have to separate these names and so when I look"
"9450690","9456810"," at Apple which I own which everybody owns it's like Tim Cook is amazing they have a great team but"
"9456810","9462170"," the bugaboo I've always had about Apple the past couple years is outside of COVID pre-COVID and now"
"9462170","9467710"," post-COVID their revenue growth is around 3% they make a bunch of cash they buy back their shares"
"9467710","9475270"," they have a flywheel etc but also many expectations for Apple's revenue growth for 2024 is just 3%"
"9475270","9481930"," so does that deserve a 30 multiple I mean we'll see what the market that seems kind of as a"
"9481930","9487250"," juxtaposition Nvidia to me could be one of the cheapest names because not only did they have a"
"9487250","9495370"," hundred and what 18% revenue growth for 2023 but for next year it's expected they do 54% revenue"
"9495370","9500490"," growth so I could separate the two and say well the market doesn't believe Nvidia's revenue growth"
"9500490","9505810"," is going to come in but if it does that stock is actually one of the cheapest of the mega"
"9505810","9511170"," caps because of that really strong revenue growth I want to bring it since you mentioned Nvidia Joe"
"9511170","9517750"," since Britain mentioned that there's a a note out from DA Davidson that deserves our attention"
"9517750","9524490"," today what if AI is just another cycle that's the title of it but they go deeper and this is"
"9524490","9530970"," where it gets controversial we believe out-ear consensus expectations are unlikely to materialize"
"9530970","9537730"," and we'll start reverting to trend line within the next two to six quarters what if AI is just"
"9537730","9542790"," another cycle they asked Nvidia may be vulnerable as AI hype approaches the trough of"
"9542790","9550490"," disillusionment those are pretty powerful cold water words okay so I want to stock that absolutely"
"9550490","9557850"," ripped more than 200% last year I want I want to separate my answers into two buckets if you"
"9557850","9563050"," would the first thing I would respond to that is I completely disagree with the premise because for"
"9563050","9570450"," that to unfold you have to believe that the overwhelming amount of spending that currently right"
"9570450","9578350"," now is going on with the mega cap companies with all these companies pushing towards advancing the"
"9578350","9585930"," innovation right and remember these are the world's strongest financial corporations we know where"
"9585930","9590870"," they are alphabet Microsoft so you have to believe that they're going to stop spending on buying"
"9590870","9595310"," those chips from Nvidia and I just don't think that is plausible at all I think the spending"
"9595310","9599790"," continues but the other thing that's important and it goes back to what Bryn was kind of talking"
"9599790","9605150"," about you have to remember something in particular as it remates not only to the mega cap seven but"
"9605150","9611030"," the semis in September and October everyone on this desk sat here and talked about this incredible"
"9611030","9615550"," chase for performance that they believe was going to happen in the fourth quarter and it did happen"
"9615550","9620870"," and it began with the semis and mega caps and it broadened out a little bit into the other 493"
"9620870","9627790"," there is no way you could present me the evidence two trading days into 2024 that we have worked"
"9627790","9634950"," off the excesses of that exercise where everyone chased the mega caps and everyone chased the semis"
"9634950","9641410"," so guess what the semis and the mega caps they're still crowded trades they're still being held at"
"9641410","9647410"," overweight positioning and that's why you have to be skeptical in terms of positioning needing to"
"9647410","9654230"," be unwound that these companies will not see further corrections how vulnerable then step is a"
"9654230","9659550"," broadcom oh absolutely how vulnerable is a lamb how vulnerable are any of these names that help the"
"9659550","9664950"," smh to its best year in 20 there's no question everybody's on the same side of the boat right now"
"9664950","9669250"," with all of these names there was massive chasing going on because there was massive portfolio"
"9669250","9675450"," management under performance and so everyone was really kind of just jumping in i think that they"
"9675450","9679150"," these stocks take a breather i think we all have to figure out is their double and triple ordering"
"9679150","9684910"," happening that is a big question in my mind um and so could we see back it filling kind of"
"9684910","9690750"," thing sure absolutely could these stocks correct 10 15% sure they're still up massively from last"
"9690750","9695330"," year and so i don't have a problem taking profits i don't have a problem taking profits and in a"
"9695330","9700970"," broadcom because i i've made a lot of money but that valuation is very um reasonable to me 23 times"
"9700970","9707850"," forward and their ai business is going to be guided anyway to go from 10 total revenue to 25"
"9707850","9712470"," percent oh in the matter of two years and so they obviously see the demand but that's the question"
"9712470","9717490"," are we getting or are they getting double and triple ordering on lamb totally different animal in"
"9717490","9722630"," my opinion because wafer fab equipment spending doesn't really necessarily have a hundred percent"
"9722630","9728710"," to do with ai a lot of some of it obviously but wafer fab equipment we're spending we're hearing"
"9728710","9732970"," from all kinds of companies we heard from micron just a couple of weeks ago that it's bottoming and"
"9732970","9737610"," that numbers are getting revised higher and that stock also even though it's re rated higher it's"
"9737610","9741710"," still only at about 28 times i think very reasonable on a pullback i'm much more inclined to add to"
"9741710","9745850"," both of those two but i have no problem taking profits and if you need the cash to buy some"
"9745850","9749830"," of these other names that are starting to outperform meaning the broader market at large we're not"
"9749830","9753430"," going to hear from you on nvidia i mean you've been in it a long time you were early in"
"9753430","9759370"," it what about that note and that question what if ai is just another cycle implication being like"
"9759370","9765950"," yeah there's so much height nowhere was the hype more acute you could argue then in vidia but you"
"9765950","9773410"," know what if these expectations are unlikely to materialize as they ask so to think about hype you"
"9773410","9779370"," would think that there's nothing behind it so as i said earlier and vidia had 118 revenue growth"
"9779370","9785630"," per for calendar year 2023 so to call it hype to me you must have or one must have never"
"9785630","9793990"," listened to saya to martin zuckerberg to lisa su to jensen wong who all reasons just go for it"
"9793990","9801510"," right i mean i'm saying the spending well i'm saying the spending is matching the narrative and so"
"9801510","9806890"," if you look at microsoft and meta are the two biggest buyers of gpu's right now they always see a"
"9806890","9812350"," long runway where they're trying to monetize that obviously microsoft's trying to monetize that"
"9812350","9817410"," right now with co-pilot but i just think that this is going to be a long 10-year spend"
"9817410","9823350"," jensen gensen thinks it's going to be a trillion dollars of data center rebuild that happens over a"
"9823350","9829390"," decade so yeah does it happen just in one year no can to your point or the note point the"
"9829390","9834350"," stocks get too ahead of themselves sure but i think trying to time that and be cute about it is"
"9834350","9840850"," tough so i mean from a positioning standpoint i continue once in vidia right now gets close to 500"
"9840850","9846110"," like right now i'm in the march five fifty calls which i got close to twenty dollars on that to"
"9846110","9850970"," me is a great way to play that right now as the market to his point has not wanted this"
"9850970","9855830"," stock to get over 500 and it shuts it down every single time but i think that this is not"
"9855830","9861750"," hype when you have the three biggest companies in the world buying billions and billions of of"
"9861750","9870370"," these gpu's yeah stuff like you know a key question is undoubtedly going to be at what level forget"
"9870370","9876490"," the multiples but the prices just price coming down in some of these names attract buyers alphabet"
"9876490","9883150"," now green joe just pointed that out microsoft now green we'll see if it lasts but you have to"
"9883150","9890750"," believe that at some level believers are not going to let these stocks go down too much sure um so"
"9890750","9896310"," i'm inclined actually to sell the rest of apple so just i know you didn't ask but i only own"
"9896310","9901930"," a 50 basis point position i would be more inclined sell that because it's too expensive for what"
"9901930","9905730"," you're getting in terms of growth you're not even getting growth in their iphone business which is"
"9905730","9910090"," 50 percent of their total revenues and services are about to start to decline and decelerate so"
"9910090","9914830"," that doesn't make any sense i take my money and i put it elsewhere what name would i actually i'll"
"9914830","9920390"," go right back into meta but it would have to come down i don't know like 20 25 percent uh"
"9920390","9925430"," because i still like it but it was up so much last year it had such a re-rating it"
"9925430","9931050"," went from 13 times to the peak of 23 times i know revenues have got went from single digits to"
"9931050","9935450"," double digits but a lot of that is priced in so come down maybe on a bad maybe on a"
"9935450","9940170"," quarter of it disappoints maybe if we get a big reaction i go back into that one well speaking of"
"9940170","9944190"," big reactions i wonder what we're going to get today at two o'clock eastern time that's when the"
"9944190","9950610"," fed minutes are released not generally not that big of a market mover uh steve leaseman let's bring"
"9950610","9955730"," him in our c uh cnbc senior economic supporter but this time maybe a little different because of"
"9955730","9962290"," where the market has decided that it's gone six cuts are are baked in now the average fed official"
"9962290","9967850"," only has three so what are we going to get this afternoon to you you think well i i think"
"9967850","9974090"," i i expect the minutes to underscore the commentary scott that we've gotten since the fed meeting"
"9974090","9979370"," which is that uh fed officials are essentially trying to rein the market back in uh bring it a"
"9979370","9984730"," little closer to its side so i don't know the extent to which we get uh you know strong language"
"9984730","9989730"," in the minutes to that effect but i i think the market if it's looking for a date that cuts"
"9989730","9994630"," will begin or looking for a higher amount of cuts out there i don't think it's going to get it"
"9994630","9999470"," today i think it's going to be something where it will be a reality check it shouldn't be a"
"9999470","10004390"," surprise to the market to the extent that all these fed officials have been out there saying no no"
"10004390","10011630"," no not quite so fast not quite so much that should be the tenor of these minutes but you just"
"10011630","10015270"," can't be sure how the market's going to react when it sees it in black and white sky sure but"
"10015270","10021110"," i mean look bark and you know cuts depend on inflation easing it's like yeah we we get it but"
"10021110","10025610"," just the the mere fact that you know we believe that cuts are on the table as long as the"
"10025610","10032490"," data cooperates that's the case uh Scott you know the the market was given an incident forecast a"
"10032490","10037470"," mile i guess it's the best way to put it uh barkin was i i think reflective of where the"
"10037470","10041450"," center is he might be a little bit on the hawkish side but he's saying you know what we didn't"
"10041450","10046610"," take uh rate hikes off the table at the last meeting and they're not going to do not off the"
"10046610","10053050"," table right now so it's all going to be determined by the data continued uh um progress on"
"10053050","10057490"," inflation is something that could allow the fed to cut there are those out there Goldman Sachs who"
"10057490","10061230"," thinks that uh you know this will come in March that's the way the market's priced if you look at"
"10061230","10067190"," the 72 73 percent probability of a rate cut come March and then the the trouble becomes got when"
"10067190","10072270"," you look down the road and that's where the differences seem to widen up the market has something"
"10072270","10078990"," like 150 basis points of rate cuts built in this year look there's still time for the markets and"
"10078990","10083090"," the fed to come together and maybe they meet in the middle or maybe one side goes all the way"
"10083090","10088090"," over to the other but ultimately there's going to need to be continued progress on inflation for"
"10088090","10093570"," the market to be right and i think the fed has this view that uh these numbers don't come out"
"10093570","10099390"," in a straight line and don't behave uh in a linear fashion so um i i think that there may"
"10099390","10103530"," be sort of sort of sided a little bit with the fed on this that there's going to be sort"
"10103530","10107350"," of obstacles along the way here all right we'll get some clues i suppose in a little more than an"
"10107350","10110910"," hour i know you got to get over to the fed so we'll let you bounce Steve Leastman thank you"
"10110910","10115890"," very much as always for joining us our senior economics reporter uh Joe i don't know you know hikes"
"10115890","10120810"," do feel like they're kind of off the table irrespective of what they say it feels like they took"
"10120810","10124930"," them off the table they put them back in the pantry they pulled out the cuts put those on the"
"10124930","10129370"," table it's just a matter of how many you may get right and how soon you get them i think"
"10129370","10134390"," is also incredibly important look i think at some point and i think it's probably in the first half"
"10134390","10138690"," of the year i think we're going to be talking about some form of a growth scare um i think"
"10138690","10144350"," the consumer is going to bend and i think at that point you know the reality of when you're looking"
"10144350","10149510"," at your portfolio where do you want to add risk to it's probably a little bit more compelling to"
"10149510","10154430"," think about the bond component of your portfolio than equities once you get that scare but what you"

"12861850","12865950"," aggressive a move and i think part of the reason why we've backstepped a little at the start of the"
"12865950","12869570"," year aside from the problems we're seeing in the in the red sea in the uptick we've seen in oil"

"12885310","12889630"," morning about you know home insurance rates going up and car insurance rates going up so maybe that"

"12896810","12901730"," me give you kelly a little behind the scenes reporter uh stories here mike and i have been talking"
"12901730","12907650"," over the past several weeks um about what happened last year and we've been trying to get the data"
"12907650","12911970"," together to to show this but to make the long story short and less complicated than it needs to be"
"12911970","12916950"," the fed thought that rate and the market thought that inflation was coming down pretty strongly at"
"12916950","12923570"," the end of last year and the beginning uh sorry the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023 that"
"12923570","12933050"," was revised away plus we had a little uptick in um uh in inflation in the beginning of the year"
"12933050","12938270"," now mike has some good reasons that we've been talking about why that may not happen again but the"
"12938270","12944550"," important point from that is that markets seem to be priced for this linear movement in what is"
"12944550","12951030"," essentially a very volatile nonlinear series so i'm a little bit concerned about that that you"
"12951030","12957010"," could get a pop in the cpi or the pce and it may not mean anything uh in terms of"
"12957010","12961710"," the overall trajectory but it would be something that could really cause markets which are all the"
"12961710","12966430"," way on one side to have to adjust and we were talking about that a little bit yesterday mike um"
"12966430","12971490"," but even if that's true even if the cpi readings come in sticky for a couple of months time do"
"12971490","12975530"," you think anyone would interpret that as a as a serious problem for the fed in other words do you"
"12975530","12980670"," think they would change their trajectory if the you know if the inflation reading is half a point"
"12980670","12986850"," higher than you know we'd like it to be you know i think the fed is pretty well positioned to"
"12986850","12993610"," stay its course and it's got a 75 basis point cutting path for 2024 and 25 100 basis points so"
"12993610","12998690"," basically with each quarterly scp or revisions to the economic forecast they can cut and then"
"12998690","13003430"," another 75 after that if you look at that broad picture their forecast for inflation are actually"
"13003430","13009190"," kind of pessimistic they plugged in some pretty high inflation numbers a very gradual reduction so"
"13009190","13014030"," i think if we do see some back uh backtracking with the inflation numbers is actually already"
"13014030","13018690"," marked in by the fed into their official outlook and so i think they actually have a pretty solid"
"13018690","13022930"," path here as long as the economy stays strong obviously if the economy starts to weaken more"
"13022930","13028110"," dramatically then we thought they may want to react to that as growth continues taking a slow and"
"13028110","13033110"," careful approach to cutting rates it's probably the best path do you think Steve it's fair to kind"
"13033110","13040070"," of boil this down to the market wants the fed to do victory cuts not not cuts in defeat that's"
"13040070","13043850"," a great way to put it tell me i hadn't heard that before i think that's exactly right um in"
"13043850","13049270"," fact Powell even talked about that at the last press conference when it comes to relative to to"
"13049270","13055050"," whether the fed would and how it might end uh quantitative tightening it depends on what's going on"
"13055050","13060050"," in the economy i think that that is a definition of a soft landing it's one of the the critical"
"13060050","13066390"," ones that the fed ends up cutting rates because the economy is relatively strong but that inflation"
"13066390","13071650"," has come down and the restraint is no yeah that's Dave Zervos line it still is base case that you"
"13071650","13075730"," know we're cutting a good place it's a good one gentlemen we'll leave it there thank you both Steve"

"13133040","13138920"," and just generally geopolitics we haven't seen prices react much in part because fundamentals are"
"13138920","13144540"," softer for crude right now we've seen some inventory bills towards the year end and that's why the"
"13144540","13150360"," market just isn't sensitive to this even if there are attacks we're not expecting any oil supply"
"13150360","13156540"," losses on the back of it I think the market is going to really look for specific supply disruptions"
"13156540","13162960"," that actually helps tighten balances before we see a significant increase in prices and to that"
"13162960","13168200"," point I guess the larger question is what it would signify for the Middle East more broadly so"
"13168200","13175490"," we've seen this escalating tension even as the oil price has remained relatively calm yeah and I"
"13175490","13180590"," think you could argue that you know our oil prices just not reflecting up some form of geopolitical"

"13186610","13192070"," crude demand seasonally is weaker because refineries undergo maintenance at this time product"

"13203310","13209790"," especially versus this time last year and if we start to get supply disruptions then you are going"
"13209790","13214370"," to get the markets kind of paying more attention to these attacks in the Middle East and you've"

"13236610","13242270"," right now what more is the international community going to have to do to get a passage back and"
"13242270","13249460"," normalize supply chains and help with oil prices and all the rest of it well I think it's a great"
"13249460","13254680"," question because we just haven't seen even with US carriers attacking and destroying some of these"

"13260080","13266760"," anything they continue as well so I'm not expecting a de-escalation in the Red Sea anytime soon and"
"13266760","13271640"," I think that's where the real risk lies is that right now the market's quite complacent to things"
"13271640","13275900"," it has a lot of inventories but these things don't take a lot of time to turn and if you"

"15571640","15578400"," that changing now well i mean don't underestimate apple i understand that growth is slowing but one"
"15578400","15581800"," of the things i think the market is missing is that the company has announced a hundred billion"
"15581800","15587500"," dollars in share buybacks and the magnificent seven alone has announced 190 apples a hundred of"
"15587500","15592620"," that so that puts a floor under the stock price but that said we took it out of our 12"

"15597720","15602800"," own microsoft in our 12 best ideas portfolio and the last thing i'll say about that is i think mark"
"15602800","15608220"," and i both were investing during the 90s we think this market is analogous to that market and at"

"15613260","15619940"," earnings for microsoft it was 51 times peak earnings and it's trading at about 30 not peak earnings"
"15619940","15625180"," today so i think there's plenty of opportunity it's a much more robust company with a lot of"
"15625180","15629680"," leverage to pull and a lot of monetization still to come in a i mark do you want to speak"
"15629680","15633680"," to that because this is now the second time actually this analogy to the 90s and 2000s has come up"
"15633680","15638160"," but when david bonson used it earlier this hour he used it in a negative way meaning you know that"
"15638160","15644140"," he saw that as yes that was the peak well i think nancy is a better memory than i do"
"15644140","15649660"," and i'll also defer to her in terms of uh microsoft and apple i would hope that one more uh"
"15649660","15654440"," stock doesn't move the market and the magnificent 70s i would hope the market moves are broader"
"15654440","15661180"," than that to me the take on the magnificent seven was last year we after a pretty severe uh 18"
"15661180","15667580"," month route in tech and growth stocks you had the seven seven highest quality tech stocks lead us"
"15667580","15671940"," out of that well of course you'd want that you want the most speculative stocks to lead us out no"
"15671940","15676120"," you want the highest quality that's what we had now i think we'll get into it as we have for"

"16208710","16215710"," know is a leading indicator and what has been hoping and driving this market is the fact that"
"16215710","16221050"," employment has been so strong and we know that and employment being strong has saved i think a lot"

"16351590","16357830"," that up would be my personal opinion here i think the the the minutes are backing up this idea that"
"16357830","16364050"," there's likely to be rate cuts this year um those are in the projections but that the extent to"
"16364050","16369110"," which the market has that certainty and i did see it by the way in the probabilities uh in the"
"16369110","16375190"," last couple minutes back off just a touch it's still a 70 probability of a rate cut coming in march"
"16375190","16382150"," but that is something the market has to own on its own and is cannot really point to the fed"
"16382150","16388830"," to come to that conclusion and it's okay it's not wrong if ken for example wants to advise his"
"16388830","16395110"," clients hey the fed is going to cut rates in march and do so six times because my inflation"
"16395110","16401590"," forecast is x i don't think you can go back to the text to support that conclusion yeah so the"

"16419730","16424050"," that could be the right conclusion there's no the the fed doesn't have any lock i'm getting"
"16424050","16428990"," forecast right and god knows it may actually have a lock i'm getting them wrong sometimes uh but"
"16428990","16434050"," but that said if you do this you do this on your own recognizance essentially you go out there and"
"16434050","16439610"," you say okay i have this inflation forecast it comes down to the point and this is the key point"
"16439610","16446830"," here that it provides the fed the confidence that it says in this document it needs in order to cut"
"16446830","16454390"," rates and that's going to happen between now and the march 20th meeting so ken you mentioned a"
"16454390","16460730"," couple of sectors that you think are well positioned for defense let's go back through those a"
"16460730","16465970"," little more slowly and and obviously there are big sectors finances a big sector that's right there"

"16506830","16515270"," with what's happening geopolitically so i think the idea is to plan for the volatility to have some"
"16515270","16521090"," defense in place to have some hedges in place and then you're right i think that big pharma didn't"
"16521090","16527650"," do so well last year it looks pretty from a from an absolute standpoint it looks promising now so"

"16557070","16564450"," if you had to guess would you guess that the rate cuts will be back loaded this year rather than"

"17547360","17553500"," from the playbook back in 2022 when apple sneezes and a slew of its suppliers catches that cold so"
"17553500","17559060"," that Barclays downgrade yesterday on apple spurred that four percent drop in shares and the same"
"17559060","17564400"," concerns we've been talking about forever iphone demand mac and ipad demand and lackluster services"
"17564400","17570420"," growth all on the horizon down another percent or so today kind of waffling around there but also"
"17570420","17576040"," following many of apple's important suppliers let me just rattle off a few examples here hanghai"
"17576040","17581220"," precision better known as fox han here in the u.s they assemble apple devices fell a bit yesterday"
"17581220","17587300"," and today TSMC that's of course the chip maker for apple devices fell three percent yesterday and"

"17629360","17636020"," December quarter by the way apple says to expect i know this is a hard question and maybe a naive"
"17636020","17643480"," one but as you look at the stock price declines of those suppliers are the declines commensurate"
"17643480","17650320"," with the percentage of revenue that is traceable to apple or is the stock market overdoing in some"
"17650320","17654380"," cases yes in some cases note historically there have been some suppliers where you know they get"
"17654380","17659380"," like 80 percent of their revenue from apple so you see a bigger fall there but my point here is"
"17659380","17664420"," it's also a signal that other consumer electronics demand is falling because there's a lot of those"

"19780150","19784130"," not stumbling let's talk let's talk about this a little bit deeper because tony pascarello of"
"19784130","19789510"," goldman sachs head of hedge fund client coverage on this program a lot just sent a note out before"
"19789510","19794210"," we came on the air and it plays right into that story and the question that all of you want"
"19794210","19798830"," answered right because he's thinking the same thing all of us are yeah is mega cap tech a consensus"
"19798830","19805520"," position of course is that a problem not necessarily here's what he says quote a set of stocks that"
"19805520","19811520"," are very well owned and dearly valued okay now i would argue these are the best balanced sheets on"
"19811520","19816280"," planet earth they are generating and returning an immense amount of capital they have the most"
"19816280","19822940"," direct leverage to the most attractive new theme where i come out continuing to quote these stocks"
"19822940","19828080"," are not cheap and they are widely held so one should be a little choosy on adding length up here"
"19828080","19833320"," bigger picture however i'm inclined to keep my eye on the ball and would look to add on meaningful"
"19833320","19838660"," dips now one day or day and a half doesn't mean meaningful dip i'm obviously i'm with you however"
"19838660","19844700"," the point is clear these stocks went up the way they did for a reason and they're going to remain"
"19844700","19850920"," in favor for a reason look i happen to think alphabet and amazon or two of the best stocks to"
"19850920","19856600"," own for this year i don't love the valuation although i wish they were 10 turns cheaper on p of"
"19856600","19860400"," course i do but these are the these are the cards in front of us right we don't always get"
"19860400","19865380"," to pick i think these stocks will be very stable this year i don't know that they'll outperform"
"19865380","19870720"," everything in the way that we saw big cap tech last year outperform everything but i think they can"
"19870720","19876900"," work because they are two of the biggest beneficiaries of ai this is the year that ai goes from a"
"19876900","19882740"," concept to an actual product um microsoft stun got an early lead but i think when you look at the"
"19882740","19888540"," ownership of anthropic you look at amazon now using their own chips to train large language models"
"19888540","19893880"," you look at alphabets opportunity to incorporate these tools into all of their existing products"
"19893880","19898840"," for literally hundreds of millions of people on day one these are companies that are going to"
"19898840","19903580"," benefit and i don't think they're so expensive that we have to look past them on a valuation basis"
"19903580","19908280"," so maybe it's not as great of a setup as it was last year i still want to be there"
"19908280","19912940"," but i want to be in other places too and i think uh you don't have to choose you can"
"19912940","19917800"," you can do both things at once energy got off to a great start this year this is the third"
"19917800","19923460"," worst performing sector last year uh this year it's in the lead xle plus three percent there's no"
"19923460","19927940"," reason why that couldn't continue and actually crude court abid today so there are other things to"
"19927940","19934980"," do it's not amazon or energy in my view it's amazon end energy i think you want to look all"
"19934980","19938860"," over the world quite frankly there's a lot of value elsewhere so we see for another day that the"
"19938860","19942920"," small caps the rustle two thousand how it's represented obviously in the market it's down one and"
"19942920","19948140"," two thirds percent of that tony's looking at this too again he speaks to everybody so i pay"
"19948140","19953400"," attention to his notes when he puts them out here's the take to strengthen spaces like small cap"
"19953400","19959680"," makes sense given positioning and the seasonal yes is it more favorable climate for the stuff that"
"19959680","19965040"," was most under the hammer when the fed was draining liquidity yes however i don't want to abandon"
"19965040","19970580"," ship and tech and it's not obvious to me that the squeeze and truly low quality exposure will"
"19970580","19977380"," persist beyond a quarter or two as my father would quippy says buy cheap get cheap look i think"
"19977380","19981300"," there was a i think there was a catch-up trade it's his hony's point there was a catch-up"
"19981300","19987940"," trade that started sometime around november small caps had an absolute gangbusters december it"
"19987940","19991740"," makes sense that they did there were a lot of people that needed to make up for everything they"
"19991740","19997140"," missed in the market it's easy to go down and cap size as a strategy to compete with the s "
"19997140","20002940","&p 500 seasonally in that time of year we see it a lot it doesn't mean it'll continue throughout the"
"20002940","20008540"," course of the year you have to ask yourself is there going to be earnings momentum to match stock"
"20008540","20014380"," price momentum in the first half again i think it's a sector by sector story it's hard for me to"
"20014380","20018940"," make the case that you're going to see more consistent growth out of the rustle two thousand then"
"20018940","20023620"," you will out of the rustle one thousand and certainly the s&p 500 i'm not sure where you can"
"20023620","20030280"," come up with that uh that thesis so in the absence of that fundamental momentum he's probably right"
"20030280","20035500"," this has probably got some weeks or some months to it probably not a full years worth of gas"
"20035500","20041560"," especially compared to companies where we know the earnings consistency already is so the minutes"
"20041560","20046560"," of the fed came out an hour in seven just about seven minutes ago and the market gyrated a little"
"20046560","20052680"," bit trying to figure out what's going on six cuts which the market was pricing in always seemed a"
"20052680","20057740"," little bit of a stretch don't you think i mean but the bottom line is that they're obviously"
"20057740","20067600"," talking about when they're going to lower the target rate there's no big consensus on a date target"
"20067600","20074600"," however obviously the market seems to be taking some level of comfort in the fact that it thinks"
"20074600","20080200"," that cuts are coming even if six was a little aggressive to get uh you know way over your skis"
"20080200","20085140"," on to begin with so thank god we don't make these kind of like macro predictions and then invest"
"20085140","20089560"," based on them because i was very wrong on what i thought the fed would do last year versus what"
"20089560","20095780"," they actually did i was not expecting 75 basis point rate hikes four of them consecutively and i"
"20095780","20101680"," thought the fed would have said on the heels of the mini banking panic that probably they had done"
"20101680","20106180"," enough and they could wait and see but they didn't wait and see they kept going now they're going"
"20106180","20109800"," to give us those hikes back in my opinion they didn't need to do them in the first place but"
"20109800","20116740"," again i don't work there um bigger picture i don't think that we need six or seven rate cuts in"
"20116740","20121240"," order for the market to find stability i think a better story we get enough rate cuts where the"
"20121240","20127520"," yield curve on inverts we're now i think a negative 35 basis points two's and tens um if that"
"20127520","20133760"," uninverts we don't have any kind of major issue in the labor market i think stocks remain bid i"
"20133760","20138720"," think they remain competitive even with elevated money market rates and my bigger prediction for"
"20138720","20143460"," the fed is that we say goodbye to Jerome Powell this summer um that's a more interesting story to"
"20143460","20148340"," me than anything they might do in an FOMC meeting that's something that i think happens especially"
"20148340","20153840"," given where trump is in the national polls i don't he wants to work for the same boss again and"
"20153840","20158580"," for me that's the big market moving event if and when we get some kind of inkling that that's going"
"20158580","20164660"," to happen okay so let's bring in Steve Leesman our senior economics reporter who was watching the"
"20164660","20169140"," release of the minutes with all of us so Steve it's good to see you again i'm looking at a"
"20169140","20175200"," 10 year yield which is at the lows of the session looks like to me 390 so we went down"
"20175200","20181080"," 10 basis points today because it seems to me and you can opine better than me obviously that the"
"20181080","20186460"," most important part that the market's hanging on is a lower target range would be appropriate later"
"20186460","20192760"," this year those words are important six as i said the josh cuts always seemed a little aggressive"
"20192760","20198780"," anyway but the idea alone that they're talking about cutting who cares exactly when but the fact"
"20198780","20203000"," that they're talking about it is far different than what they were talking about a year ago or a"
"20203000","20209780"," couple months ago or even a few weeks ago yeah so i'm not sure i completely agree with that"
"20209780","20214460"," assessment Scott and i'll get to that in a second i want to just point out i think josh has"
"20214460","20221800"," his eye on the right prize why all this matters um the guys in the financial departments on wall"
"20221800","20229060"," street are really focused on when and how this curve might disinvert and that's a pretty important"
"20229060","20235380"," moment for the market this year if you have a situation where short-term yields are lower than"
"20235380","20240740"," longer-term yields it brings back things like floating rate notes and all kinds of things that can"
"20240740","20245940"," happen that normally happen when you have a yield curve that's in a normal position maybe that's a"
"20245940","20250060"," discussion for another day i just thought it's important to point out i really think josh has his"
"20250060","20255100"," eye on the right prize here why we're talking about this because the guys i'm talking to want to"
"20255100","20261260"," know when this happens how this happens the steepener is is the biggest trade right now i think or"
"20261260","20265180"," one of the bigger trades in the fixed income market we'll come back to that in a second i really"
"20265180","20271320"," don't think the minutes provided more information than the markets previously had scott when it"
"20271320","20277820"," comes to the issue of rate cuts the paragraph you read it referred back to the fed officials"
"20277820","20284540"," projections and to the extent that there was a discussion there about rate cuts it was really hard"
"20284540","20290320"," to find in these minutes other than the noting of the projections i think what happened here is the"
"20290320","20297040"," fed did decide they were done cutting rates they did decide last year that this year as in the year"
"20297040","20302060"," we're in right now would probably be a year for lowering rates but there was no discussion of the"
"20302060","20308920"," magnitude or the timing i guess my overall point is that the minutes don't upset i don't think in"
"20308920","20314160"," any way the story that the market was telling itself steve now i'm not talking about the number of"
"20314160","20320000"," cuts but the mere fact that the market thinks there are going to be cuts it's pretty confident of"
"20320000","20324400"," it it's confident that the fed's done hiking and i don't feel like the minutes really threw water"
"20324400","20331200"," on any of that it didn't unless you were looking in the minutes for how deep or broad or persistent"
"20331200","20336980"," the discussion was about rate cuts because there wasn't much there i was very much kind of doing a"
"20336980","20342160"," double take when i read it okay where is this discussion what is this discussion it's a simple"
"20342160","20349040"," notation really that rates are going to come down this year because that's what's in the"
"20349040","20356440"," projections also some discussion that the inflation outlook is more balanced also very uncertain"
"20356440","20362440"," you probably need to also mention scott that in there is this notion of the possibility of rates"
"20362440","20368780"," also going higher i do not think there's much support in there for the most bullish or most davis"
"20368780","20375460"," standpoint of the fed cutting six times that's not to say it's wrong it's just to say that that's"
"20375460","20381040"," not where the fed is at to the extent the market has this projection they do so i believe on"
"20381040","20385800"," their own with their own forecast you can't be wrong at the end of this year and go back and"
"20385800","20391420"," say the fed told me six rate cuts beginning in march because that's not in this document do you"
"20391420","20397920"," want to comment on what josh said about the big wild card is j-powel leaving before the end of"
"20397920","20404380"," 2024 i mean if you don't mind i'd like to hear more about that the j-powel i know will"
"20404380","20409840"," stay through the end of his term if he's physically capable and i have no information that he is"
"20409840","20415720"," not physically capable looks pretty fit to me maybe josh is a thesis that would be convincing i'll"
"20415720","20419520"," let josh say well what he was saying a few moments let me let me give let me give you"
"20419520","20423200"," the other side and i don't know anything more i don't know anything more than you do and you're"
"20423200","20429720"," more well-sourced than i am just thinking out loud as a as a person who has managed to literally"

"20525500","20530280"," only reason why that's the case is because the soft landing scenario right now is priced to"

"21795380","21799740"," bonds would have a reasonably good year obviously bonds didn't for most of it and then stocks"
"21799740","21806680"," ultimately took off the last two two months of the year so we basically had a year in two months"
"21806680","21811760"," is as you've widely discussed we've been balanced what does that mean it's fully invested we picked"
"21811760","21818200"," our spots here there sectors didn't work too well for most people including us but certainly being"
"21818200","21823980"," dedicated to us large caps for most of the year if not all of the year really helped we haven't"
"21823980","21828620"," changed our tune i think it's really important to know that going balanced into next year was still"
"21828620","21834760"," high unpredictability is really important but also staying fully invested and that's the key you"
"21834760","21840260"," know most of the time time in the markets is much better than timing the markets and you not talked"
"21840260","21846260"," a lot about this over the years and i'll say this if you know the wedge in the markets going"
"21846260","21852540"," into a year you have a very good reasonable chance of not just outperforming but staying on goal"
"21852540","21857340"," what's the wedge last year inflation we got that out of the way what's the wedge this year it's"
"21857340","21864780"," probably fiscal restraint not to mention geopolitics and politics if we can get that at bay then"
"21864780","21870840"," you're talking about high predictability in earnings margins real yields declining yields of peak"
"21870840","21876520"," and the Fed is telling us what they're going to do but i want to go back to something you"
"21876520","21881840"," just said and try and i think i'm reading between the lines a little bit you said sectors didn't"
"21881840","21888860"," work too well i take that as as you saying that you didn't have enough exposure to megacaps to"
"21888860","21897260"," really catch that powerful momentum that they had last year does that suggest and you said your"
"21897260","21901900"," your sort of playbook hasn't really changed that much does does that suggest that you're still not"
"21901900","21908540"," well overweight those types of stocks yeah that's correct we were basically neutral tech for most"
"21908540","21912300"," of the year we had a little slight overweight to start the year but as the year progressed and they"
"21912300","21920660"," had a six time outperformance we we maintained neutral exposure we're still there at this point but"
"21920660","21926820"," when i said sectors didn't really work you didn't have the defenses working in a year where most"
"21926820","21931380"," people thought we were going to recession you didn't have the cyclicals really working it was"
"21931380","21936820"," bifurcated very much so towards tech and communication services and a little bit of consumer"
"21936820","21944420"," discretionary but sectors are so diversified nowadays that using your normal sector rotation when"
"21944420","21949460"," your late cycle or early cycle is now moving more towards what is what is the factor that's working"
"21949460","21955040"," in the market earnings momentum and high interest coverage and we see that being the areas that are"
"21955040","21960660"," going to outperform again heading into 24 or 2020 why aren't you more optimistic though right if"
"21960660","21967160"," you if we if we've come for a pretty long way right from where the fed was to where we"
"21967160","21971140"," are now and where they are as we learned yet again from the minutes right the economy looks like"
"21971140","21977360"," it's progressing towards a soft landing i mean obviously not there yet but that's the bet and the"
"21977360","21983700"," big bet is that the fed is going to cut multiple times this year who knows when that begins so"
"21983700","21990780"," if rates are going to come down and the economy is going to be pretty decent earnings you would"
"21990780","21997520"," figure would be pretty good thus just justifying a reasonably good multiple what am i missing yeah"
"21997520","22001740"," you know i'm missing anything you've nailed the story now you got to talk about what could actually"
"22001740","22008320"," come in that we're all worried about to balance out some of that uber optimism to bring bring us"
"22008320","22012520"," back to earth a little bit and become more of a realist what's a realist seven eight percent"
"22012520","22019080"," returns in stock returns that's good we'll take that every year uh bond returns somewhere around"
"22019080","22024720"," what your yield to maturity is we'll also take that 60 40 working again very much take that but"
"22024720","22030900"," balancing out by high geopolitical risk us political diversion also could be there and then"
"22030900","22034860"," ultimately do we really know what's going to go on with the debt maturity refinancing particularly"
"22034860","22039620"," in commercial real estate we don't know yet we think it's going to be contained but these are"
"22039620","22044320"," balancing acts and wild cards that could come and go throughout the year but generally speaking for"
"22044320","22049720"," the year yeah i would say we're optimistic what do i do i'm looking i'm looking squarely at the"
"22049720","22055580"," Russell because you know as as our show has progressed here over this final stretch the Russell's"
"22055580","22061840"," gotten uglier right so it was a huge winner over that stretch from November first till the end of"
"22061840","22067180"," the year and now we've had a rollover right now it's down two and two thirds percent it's now five"
"22067180","22071220"," percent in a week and a lot of that's happened in a couple days are are you a believer in"
"22071220","22078000"," that broadening out trade or did that get too far ahead of itself uh it's a tough type of dynamic"
"22078000","22083820"," to kind of dissect i think that small caps in general lower quality areas when you're in this long"
"22083820","22091440"," period between late and early and there's optimism about bed cuts and the next expansion you can"
"22091440","22095820"," get a lot of headfakes in the lower quality areas and i think that's what you're getting when you"
"22095820","22102220"," saw that big move up in addition to some of the other lower quality areas i don't think they're yet"
"22102220","22108340"," right for a full upgrade i think they should be on the upgrade watchlist as well same thing for"
"22108340","22112820"," emerging markets now we don't want to try to time these things too much but what do you need for"
"22112820","22119200"," small caps to actually have a sustainable rally not just a couple months but six 12 18 months or"
"22119200","22125940"," more you need margins to expand again and that's quite likely in 24 because input costs are coming"
"22125940","22131280"," down and you're seeing some sticky pricing power and if you can get that that's where the upgrade"
"22131280","22136060"," in small caps is much more sustainable oh rate cuts aren't enough right because when rates started"
"22136060","22141540"," coming down small caps started going up right it's not enough because generally speaking if you're"
"22141540","22146320"," cutting rates now our belief is you're cutting rates because real yields are still are actually too"
"22146320","22150960"," wide not because you're going to have an economic hard landing but the market's going to try to"
"22150960","22156880"," fuel that out at least in our opinion and at the initial stages of fed cuts usually the lower"
"22156880","22162340"," quality areas are not the ones that participate could be different this time but the playbook is"
"22162340","22166720"," usually they don't participate same thing with emerging markets and then after the third or so cut"
"22166720","22171820"," you start to see that come back because now the market begins to sniff out an expansion again"
"22171820","22177500"," perhaps later in 24 into 25 maybe we had to pull forward too chris take care we'll talk to you"
