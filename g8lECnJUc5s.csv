"204360","205240"," I got some work to do."
"205340","206720"," I didn't know my camera is so dark. "
"207520","209260"," I think it's the exposure or something."
"209880","211960"," I must have messed with it taking some photos of the kids."
"212860","214200"," Hope you're all doing well this morning. "
"215420","217460"," Just so we'll get right into it before the opening bell."
"218060","220720"," We've got only five minutes until the bell sound."
"221260","222300"," Four minutes until the bell goes. "
"223540","226520"," This is the automatic short from yesterday above here."
"227020","228900"," We'll talk about that this morning."
"228900","233440"," We're going to get a nice little gap up this morning to 429. "
"236760","237560"," Cool down here."
"239140","242400"," Kind of that kind of you can see here on book map that."
"245280","248680"," This is a this back here is one of the. "
"249340","249920"," Let me see."
"250040","250880"," Look at this here."
"251040","253060"," So far back to Zisco. "
"255420","257140"," Right in right in here."
"257140","260040"," Then I've got a top back here is back on."
"262880","264240"," 27th and 28th. "
"268920","272100"," Somewhere down in here is one more level just right where we are right now."
"272220","274140"," You can kind of see on book map where that is."
"275020","277860"," Now what I really want to say this morning is. "
"281240","283160"," The spy here and this is."
"285720","287620"," Part of my post here from."
"288880","290220"," That captains alpha. "
"291400","293920"," And what I'm going to do here is I'm going to mute."
"294480","297720"," You can see the ledge that we're sitting on right now on book map."
"298180","299980"," Just be aware of that as we open the. "
"300300","301680"," Open the morning here, but."
"302300","304370"," The key here that I'm watching is."
"305100","306560"," I'm going to move this down to. "
"307760","308980"," Right of that per minute."
"312300","313860"," So just on a daily."
"315140","317000"," It's a 30 minute chart right here. "
"317120","321480"," Just be aware of this on a 30 minute chart."
"321880","323420"," And this yellow box."
"323620","325260"," These yellow boxes that you see down here. "
"326420","328480"," Is daily velocity daily momentum."
"329620","332620"," So the concern here that I had in."
"333460","337600"," Well, I guess on live stream the past two days or two days ago is like we're going to squeeze"
"337600","337880"," up. "
"338500","340440"," We didn't squeeze and we finally squeezed yesterday."
"341940","348060"," And we squeezed overnight further up to that PT five and that those higher numbers didn't quite get"
"348060","350080"," to the automatic short number."
"350840","353160"," But in the daily trigger, I just want you to see this here. "
"355660","360880"," And specifically how we start we begin to roll into negative velocity down below."
"360880","363440"," And you can kind of see it forming over here."
"364640","368540"," This negative velocity on a daily trigger and I just want you to be aware of this as we come"
"368540","369040"," into today. "
"370640","372440"," Now we bottoming down here."
"373060","377160"," Is the question right is this is this an actual bottom down here and you can kind of see it"
"377160","377560"," down here."
"378680","380520"," While we have it back in December. "
"383140","386680"," And you can see it back over here, but there's some more down that took place."
"386860","388060"," This is back in October."
"388680","390900"," We had another roll over now. "
"390900","394700"," This is the hourly trigger, which is still looking bullish right now."
"395420","399920"," Though the one in the five minute are a little over over bought right now."
"400420","403880"," We could probably see some weakness right into the opening bell on the one and five. "
"404580","409080"," We really want to be watching this hourly and now we're opening at nine in another minute right"
"409080","409800"," nine twenty nine."
"410320","412200"," So let me bring this over here."
"412900","415980"," And somebody looking for some weakness on the opening bell. "
"416560","421740"," The big concern here of course is this negativity."
"422080","422500"," It's in the market."
"422640","424400"," We've got two examples of this. "
"424800","428080"," This being a bottom and then possibly rolling over."
"428680","434020"," Now as we open the market here, the thing that I want to be concerned with is the daily trigger"
"434020","434400"," up here."
"434540","435480"," I didn't get to show you this part. "
"436200","441280"," And that's that this is trend for market here for a significant amount of time."
"441420","444820"," This is the Monday the ninth here."
"445340","449100"," And all the way over to February, February 16th. "
"449200","455280"," So it's pretty significant like right like a monthly trend that lasts for a significant amount of"
"455280","455500"," time."
"455620","459800"," I think this is 13 or 14 sessions in here."
"460420","465080"," And you can see we've had since the 16th, we've been coming down right and just for today. "
"465320","468380"," This is the post that I'm talking about inside of."
"469540","473580"," At Captain's alphas is that this daily trigger as this comes down."
"474380","476100"," This is the daily velocity. "
"476600","479160"," This is just beginning to become negative now."
"479660","485180"," And you can see the slope of this of this trigger coming down to meet up with."
"486480","489260"," This morning's open now. "
"490180","494120"," There's two things to be looking for here or two things we're looking for here this morning."
"495440","500300"," We're looking for some kind of first time rejection here minimum, right?"
"500900","505260"," I expect that weakness into the ISM numbers."
"505600","508140"," And we can also get weakness after ISM. "
"508580","511520"," We'll talk about ISM this morning and what it like why it matters."
"512260","513460"," And not the headlines."
"514539","516280"," So we'll go we'll go into everything on ISM. "
"516380","518299"," We could still get that Rick Ricochet higher."
"519880","525300"," To get that weakness on the open weakness into the morning and then the digestion of ISM and then"
"525300","526480"," possibly the rip higher."
"526900","533100"," The real concern here, though, is when we're below the yellow line, we're bearish. "
"533380","535980"," We're always bearish for above the yellow line."
"536280","536620"," We're bullish."
"537540","538580"," And that's the key here. "
"538720","540600"," So someone asked you, are you bullish or bearish?"
"541360","541400"," Right."
"542700","547500"," This yellow line actually tells you the yellow line tells you were bullish here and below it were"
"547500","547920"," bearish."
"547920","551100"," Even if we squeeze higher, we're still bearish. "
"551180","554380"," And until we break above this yellow line, we're still bearish."
"554880","556980"," It's important distinction to understand."
"558780","564740"," And part of that distinction to understand is, let me give us a minute to do this here. "
"565420","566220"," Get this right for you."
"567260","569400"," There we go."
"570380","577640"," The important distinction here is that if we reject off this yellow line, then this is a"
"577640","583520"," continuation down move down to lower lows. "
"583880","590140"," Another key point here is if we break above this line here, even if we consolidate here, it's not"
"590140","590860"," really good enough."
"590940","595760"," You can't take that bullish stance until you start to take off from here."
"595980","601800"," So even if we have any consolidation here, this is still known void until price actually starts to"
"601800","602220"," break above. "
"602220","608680"," And you kind of need the hourly, the one minute and the five minute to follow through and catch up."
"608840","614000"," The screen line right here needs to catch up while price is heading higher."
"615220","618480"," So until you have even this, you can't say, hey, I'm bullish on the market. "
"619080","625040"," So you have to have real concern here if we begin to roll over and down and start to break"
"625040","625560"," these levels."
"625560","631060"," And the issue that I had was that February closed the month with lots of damage done to these"
"631060","633460"," weekly and monthly levels here."
"633860","642060"," And so what you have is sellers selling into demand, right, into people trying to buy stocks,"
"642340","642340"," right?"
"642540","645600"," Our algos, robots, banks, whomever. "
"646180","651940"," And the more that you whittle away at that demand, those levels get weaker."
"651940","654880"," And we didn't close the month before repair in February."
"655600","660460"," So I'm concerned about this, this orange line, this blue line being weaker than it portrays itself"
"660460","661340"," to be at this point. "
"661920","663140"," So there is some concern there."
"663440","667520"," And there's some concern here in this yellow line coming down and us having further downside of the"
"667520","667960"," month of March."
"668480","671680"," We know the JPM Morgan collar for this month. "
"671900","672900"," It's still, it's fine."
"673060","673500"," It's in the money."
"673560","674140"," It's paid itself. "
"675100","679500"," But JPM would like nothing less than to be under 4060 in possibly even lower."
"679500","681340"," We know about 3600."
"681460","685180"," We know about three zero three zero six three two, I think. "
"686780","689160"," So we'll pay attention to that as the day moves forward."
"689160","690700"," We'll see if there's rejection here."
"691560","695000"," There's two key things for you to remember today into these numbers. "
"695520","698920"," And that's going to be there's two key things to remember today specifically."
"699640","703020"," And that is some initial rejection off here."
"703740","710400"," Do we get the some numbers and do we get a bounce or we start bloodbathing it through these levels"
"710400","710760"," here. "
"710900","712080"," So key things to know."
"712320","715220"," So you can see the weakness already off the bell this morning."
"715700","719200"," So I'm going to give you some some some numbers here. "
"719380","721700"," Okay, the first one's going to be four zero one forty."
"722380","730040"," And then down below here a key support level is three nine seven two seven three nine six sixty"
"730040","730300"," six."
"731300","734180"," And then thirty nine five sixty four. "
"734520","737480"," We want to see these levels hold even if we're weak on the day."
"737940","740600"," You want to see these levels hold today."
"740900","742600"," You don't want to see us breaking through these levels. "
"742960","747900"," You don't want to see a breakthrough a violent breakthrough and then a recheck and then we start"
"747900","748820"," heading lower as well."
"749620","752760"," Now for the bulls if you if you're in the bull case."
"753720","754920"," For where bullish here. "
"755040","757220"," I already told you what it means to be bullish here."
"757600","761680"," And what is the implication if we get above the sale line and start to make our way higher."
"762440","766740"," The algo is saying four zero seven four zero eight in a failure. "
"767580","769600"," I'll I'll see if I can show you the algo here."
"770920","774040"," It's been seven minutes time now at nine forty five a.m. Eastern time."
"774260","780040"," Do you get the US S&P services PMI final read for February for cost of fifty spot five and"
"780040","781280"," the prior fifty spot five. "
"782340","786700"," The algo is basically the range is in a fifty spot eight to fifty spot five."
"786820","789120"," Let's get the US composite PMI final."
"792000","794980"," The algo bar is bullish here with a failure. "
"795380","797440"," Probably the composite is in a fifty spot to."
"799040","799860"," We have a."
"800720","805480"," The other was bullish here to a failure at like four seven four seven four eight."
"806000","809100"," But then does come back up off of this daily. "
"810580","814000"," And trades to I believe for ten or four twenty above."
"814240","815960"," We'll take a look at it at some at some point this morning."
"816480","819320"," But again the algo bot doesn't have any idea what anything about ISM. "
"819460","823080"," So I can't input that into with the algo bot."
"823260","823420"," Thanks."
"825120","826540"," So we'll take a look at that this morning. "
"826740","827900"," So just be aware of these numbers."
"828240","834880"," Be aware that when we do trend or change trend or when we're underneath the daily like this."
"834880","838480"," We sometimes have a tendency to bounce off and continue lower. "
"841900","843700"," And I'll show you guys the algo bot in just a minute here."
"844180","846020"," A little bit of weakness off the bell right now."
"846580","848220"," Training underneath the one in five minute. "
"849940","853320"," I'll give you some targets below and above in just a moment here."
"896710","898250"," And seven two three."
"901790","914610"," You got"
"914610","915350"," this one right here. "
"915510","916950"," This is your weekly."
"922550","929650"," This is the hourly trigger right here."
"929890","931030"," I'll make this one green for you. "
"937320","938580"," And five six four."
"938760","939740"," Some pretty good support here."
"944400","946180"," Three nine five six zero. "
"948420","950340"," Right has some fairly good support here."
"951240","952900"," I got a lineman is pretty goddamn good."
"954060","956220"," This is going to be a key level down below. "
"958860","961100"," Just need some extra news from the Wall Street Journalers."
"961220","965720"," Fox connoisseur to expand their iPhone production at the existing plant in Tamil Nadu, India."
"966240","969260"," So it's apples like a APL again cited by the Wall Street Journal. "
"971860","973400"," There are one right in it right here."
"975830","977350"," I'll give you some targets above as well."
"981110","982170"," So there you go down here. "
"982290","983530"," Some decent support down here."
"984750","986690"," Here's S1 believe it or not down here."
"989330","990570"," Hit the line right here. "
"992270","993650"," And then above target."
"996930","997810"," 401 43."
"999250","1000710"," This is where the daily is. "
"1005220","1006040"," Right in here."
"1006180","1012540"," Right in there."
"1018980","1020380"," You need to know this one right here. "
"1023280","1025319"," Wait, so you need to know about this this morning."
"1026640","1028040"," I get this here."
"1028880","1032359"," So we need to know about this this morning is this is where the bears are. "
"1032460","1033540"," This is where the south side is."
"1034940","1036420"," South side will be right here."
"1036500","1038980"," If we can break above this south side activity. "
"1039560","1042140"," We should squeeze higher from 401."
"1042619","1044579"," The trade is to 407 408."
"1045460","1048200"," Looking for a failure at some point at four seven four eight. "
"1048280","1049740"," If we trade higher from there."
"1050200","1053540"," People that get above this automatic short or this cell point above."
"1054300","1054980"," Down below. "
"1056340","1059000"," If you are a bull, you want to see this hold."
"1059900","1061820"," If you are a bear, you want to see this break."
"1062100","1063760"," This is basically what you got hit down here, right?"
"1063940","1065580"," This is known support down below. "
"1066400","1070020"," If you if you see this support today at any point or this morning at any point."
"1071080","1072140"," So in five minutes."
"1072300","1073540"," I know it's really bad. "
"1073900","1074320"," Eastern time."
"1074580","1076920"," You get the US S&P services PMI final."
"1077380","1083220"," August 50 spot five and the prior 50 spot five range of 50 spot eight to 50 spot five. "
"1083500","1087740"," Just to get the US composite PMI final, which is a prior read of a 50 spot to."
"1089540","1090600"," It looks like they're."
"1091620","1092280"," That's the error. "
"1092400","1093080"," It's the same."
"1093480","1095400"," Same on the ISM five minutes."
"1095400","1096220"," We get the SP. "

"4444610","4446490"," HYG is still looking kind of bullish here."
"4446590","4447650"," They left the gap down below. "
"4448170","4451010"," Could just be a matter of grabbing more support down here."
"4465950","4467730"," HYG is still bullish here though too."
"4468230","4471650"," It's waiting for the five minutes to catch up and trade it to seventy four eighty or so. "
"4478260","4480060"," HYG turning bullish though overall."
"4502350","4503650"," It's set DORFA."
"4504030","4505950"," I set. "
"4508370","4509850"," I said DORFA."
"4510210","4510610"," Is that right?"
"4515850","4517370"," How do I pronounce your name?"
"4518230","4519850"," Thanks for saying something in the stream."
"4520110","4520730"," Appreciate that. "
"4526680","4532060"," It's it's ETI DORFA."
"4532400","4534220"," ETI got it ETI."
"4538310","4539490"," Thanks for following. "
"4539650","4540150"," I appreciate it."
"4541850","4542250"," Yeah."
"4542410","4543670"," Griffey's at Griff STL. "
"4545010","4545870"," HYG's looking good."
"4546030","4547730"," I mean overall looking at HYG."
"4547830","4549070"," I'll bring up a HYG real quick. "
"4556840","4557460"," Good morning."
"4557600","4557700"," Jill."
"4557900","4558240"," How are you?"
"4562960","4563880"," You're tapping out. "
"4563980","4565440"," You'll let you run and run and run to the beach."
"4572590","4574970"," You're proposing to your girlfriend next week in Florida."
"4574970","4576090"," I need your blessing Papa. "
"4576450","4576770"," Hell yeah."
"4576990","4578910"," Bless your your proposing your girlfriend."
"4579670","4580510"," Congratulations Rowan. "
"4583270","4583930"," Congratulations man."
"4585090","4586430"," How long have you been with her for?"
"4587650","4588710"," You're her best friend."
"4589130","4591330"," We have all kinds of questions before you give you the blessing. "
"4593410","4594550"," Two years okay."
"4597990","4598610"," That's good."
"4599830","4601290"," Blonde and blue eyes is always good. "
"4601470","4603270"," That's my wife has blonde blue eyes."
"4604130","4604870"," Check on that."
"4606910","4607910"," And you're Indian?"
"4608630","4609890"," You looked out heavily. "
"4612090","4614430"," You must be the envy of all your friends."
"4616430","4617030"," Congratulations."
"4617230","4617830"," Congratulations. "
"4617910","4621730"," It's just turning positive after calling the wealthy family to session earlier."
"4622030","4627550"," So the original fall came as the UAE were debating internally whether to leave OPEC as according to"
"4627550","4629510"," all the Wall Street Journal, he was starting sources."
"4629510","4636130"," It has been debunked by wires and also people familiar with the matter as well as UAE officials"
"4636130","4636570"," themselves. "
"4637010","4641050"," So now this report about UAE considering leaving OPEC far from the truth."
"4641410","4644170"," So again, we've just seen those losses paid and extended gain."
"4644210","4649590"," USO ripping on this news right now trading 68, 66 road man. "
"4649750","4651870"," You like that's like the total stereotype, right?"
"4653890","4656930"," And you beat that stereotype down like it was nothing."
"4658330","4659230"," Good job, man."
"4671930","4673150"," Her credit square better. "
"4673310","4677750"," We got those connections now."
"4680790","4682610"," Yeah, didn't ask for a dowry, right?"
"4682890","4683610"," Those are big, right?"
"4685630","4689470"," I've got some, I don't know what nationality you are, your heritage or culture, but I got some"
"4689470","4698970"," Indian friends and dowry stuff talking about precious metals and stuff,"
"4699230","4700010"," emeralds."
"4707560","4709040"," You both work in the financial world. "
"4709240","4709860"," She's your best friend."
"4710060","4710500"," She takes care of me."
"4710800","4711520"," That's all you need, man. "
"4712540","4713360"," It really is."
"4713900","4717680"," More so than anything, as long as you love each other and your friends, like friends is key."
"4718940","4721140"," You know, I don't, some people will be like, we never fight or whatever. "
"4721140","4725740"," I don't know if you fight or not, but that's important to be, or to me at least the biggest"
"4725740","4733960"," thing that I ever found was that the key is that the piece of advice they give you would be"
"4733960","4739100"," that as they get older, you know, your wants and needs change."
"4740060","4744280"," And it's not always the same thing your partner wants or what their needs are."
"4745600","4747380"," So sometimes it's kind of cool to be a friend. "
"4747580","4752740"," Like if you ever had a friend in your life where it doesn't really matter what's happening, you go"
"4752740","4756180"," separate ways or do separate things, but you're still friends after many years."
"4756460","4761760"," I feel like that is that has served us well over the years."
"4764800","4774680"," So maybe like a count on a hand, lifelong friends, just a few, just a"
"4774680","4774900"," few. "
"4775380","4779160"," I've had, you know, good friends throughout the years, but the few that have had their good"
"4779160","4783020"," friends, we've all had lived different lives."
"4783360","4788160"," You know, it's like, you see some of your friends like, you would never expect people like us to be"
"4788160","4790500"," friends like that, but we are."
"4792340","4797240"," For all these years, I've gotten to do different things in our lives, but that is like a key"
"4797240","4798060"," ingredient, I think. "
"4798840","4802420"," The only thing I would tell you to do is take care of yourself."
"4804040","4808880"," If you take care of yourself first, you can take care of other people because if you can't take"
"4808880","4810620"," care of yourself, you just can't do that."
"4812900","4819960"," One of some of my largest failings in life was have been not taking care of myself then not being"
"4819960","4821460"," able to take care of other people. "
"4821960","4823440"," Probably the two biggest things."
"4828870","4831290"," Yeah, I think we're going to get, we should get it at some point."
"4831570","4836530"," I don't know if we get the, so Chase has about Vanocharum melt up, we should get it at some"
"4836530","4837130"," point, Chase. "
"4837410","4841530"," I just don't know if it's like down here, Chase."
"4841530","4846590"," I don't, so it's weird because, so Chase is asking for getting that Vanocharum melt up."
"4846770","4851590"," We should, but I don't know if it's like down here, Chase. "
"4853090","4859150"," Like we get some kind of like, weird, intraday bullshit in here, or if we trade up here and then"
"4859150","4860490"," get that melt up up here."
"4861150","4863190"," So, I'm not interested in this trade."
"4863430","4865490"," So personally, I'm not interested in this trade. "
"4866290","4871530"," I'm either looking for that, that melt up to occur later in the day, or I'm looking for us to"
"4871530","4874770"," trade above it, consolidate, and then get that melt up."
"4875750","4879710"," But currently, and I'll show you why I'm not interested right here, Chase, if you're just joining"
"4879710","4882570"," us, why I'm not long here."
"4883710","4884450"," Let me just second here. "
"4896780","4898340"," It's just this right here, right?"
"4898680","4906500"," So, for us to get bullish here, what I'm looking for is for the one minute to catch up and"
"4906500","4909320"," truthfully, I'd really like to the hourly catch up."
"4910880","4912020"," That's my only thing."
"4912100","4917140"," My only point here is I can't, I need to get this, this green needs to come up here a"
"4917140","4921280"," little bit for me, but if we start to squeeze over this yellow line right here, I'll take a long"
"4921280","4921720"," for sure. "
"4924500","4926160"," You know, you know how this goes, right?"
"4926420","4932780"," Not out of time, but this is, this would be the second idea would be we come down here and"
"4932780","4933960"," catch that green bounce."
"4934500","4939140"," The red and white would come underneath and you'd actually get a pretty, pretty decent rip out of"
"4939140","4939640"," this right here."
"4941180","4943200"," So, we'll see if that happens or not. "
"4943440","4947920"," Now, if we just start coming over this yellow line, I'll pick up that, that long for sure."
"4949380","4952600"," Otherwise, a little, little, little dangerous, not dangerous."
"4968270","4977390"," I don't know if I call it dangerous, more like, you know, they're letting everybody load up and"
"4977390","4977590"," call. "
"4977790","4980070"," In my view, they'll let everybody load up and calls right here."
"4980970","4984590"," And so you're, you're like, you know, fucking buying calls and shit like that."
"4984590","4990530"," And then they dump it real quick and you're like, shit, my dollar calls that are going to be in"
"4990530","4991790"," the money are now 10 cents. "
"4993770","4994730"," So that's just me."
"5012330","5014210"," But anyways, congratulations wrote, man."
"5014330","5017310"," I don't know if I said, but congratulations. "
"5017950","5019250"," I wish you all the best."
"5021090","5023110"," Don't try to win arguments with your new wife."
"5023530","5024110"," Just let her win. "
"5024630","5027250"," That way, when you need to win an argument, hopefully you can."
"5028530","5031750"," You're going to make mistakes in life, like everybody else does."
"5033310","5034210"," She is too. "
"5035330","5037810"," You have to be able to forgive people and stuff like that."
"5038210","5038690"," You can do that."
"5038910","5039710"," You'll probably get through life. "
"5043130","5044310"," Try to enjoy life."
"5045610","5047030"," You never know how long you'll be here."
"5047150","5047650"," All that stuff. "
"5049350","5050170"," Lambo's mean nothing."
"5051750","5053050"," I guess to some people they do."
"5053870","5054670"," I shouldn't say that. "
"5054730","5056530"," I guess some people that stuff matters too."
"5056710","5061850"," But for me, at least, I don't know how you are, but I'm one of those like, I'm like a"
"5061850","5063630"," family person."
"5063630","5067730"," I like to have people around me that love me and that I love and stuff like that in good"
"5067730","5068030"," times. "
"5068790","5074370"," Some people are, you know, introverts or I like to be single stuff like that."
"5074490","5075970"," I don't feel like that or not."
"5076090","5078550"," But for me, at least that's the stuff I like. "
"5086260","5089260"," Yeah, Professor Stock is saying so many 400 C's today."
"5090060","5091220"," They can't pay those."
"5096180","5097900"," Yeah, like I think they pay them. "
"5098940","5100680"," There's more puts than calls."
"5100760","5107120"," There's 399 puts or 155,000 399 P's at 38 cents."
"5110520","5113240"," I think they can print the 401 C's. "
"5114660","5117040"," But I think that we have to go down first."
"5119840","5120820"," That's a fair point."
"5120980","5122580"," I agree with you who's saying that. "
"5125160","5127360"," I can't see who texted that or said that."
"5130050","5131430"," I don't know who posted that."
"5131570","5135030"," Professor Stock said so many 400 C's today. "
"5135210","5136230"," They can't pay those LOL."
"5136970","5140230"," Yeah, I'd like to see some of this burn off a little bit."
"5141710","5143790"," You know, we can look at how about this?"
"5143970","5145870"," We'll look at I got something for you. "
"5148960","5152320"," Let me see if we can see what's going on with the implied ball here."
"5166640","5173700"," Load layout, client demand, all the Macery need, moving averages, T3."
"5174800","5176140"," Which one do I need here?"
"5176140","5178400"," Oh, right here. "
"5179160","5179820"," All right."
"5180000","5180380"," Hang tight."
"5180520","5183040"," I'm going to look at the implied ball and see if they're buying calls or not. "
"5204840","5206940"," Yeah, I mean, they're buying calls here."
"5211450","5213070"," One minute, five minute."
"5214430","5216490"," They're buying calls on the one and five. "
"5220360","5222440"," They're waiting for people to start buying here."
"5223740","5229080"," To bring crude futures, pair losses now about unchanged after falling $2 a barrel earlier in the"
"5229080","5229320"," session."
"5234950","5236590"," It's it's I'm looking at it right now. "
"5236630","5238990"," It's kind of tough to call this one."
"5240630","5248070"," I don't want to find the man."
"5249750","5250850"," It's T3, baby. "
"5255860","5257000"," Okay, there's T3."
"5259040","5264720"," Yeah, it's I care."
"5264880","5269420"," Let me give you a I'm going to bring this up here. "
"5272120","5277020"," This is the time it's the way now to expect your comments from meds, Logan, who makes opening"
"5277020","5283320"," remarks as an event on market dysfunction hosted by the Chicago University Booth School of"
"5283320","5283640"," Business."
"5284100","5286260"," Text is expected, but no Q&A."
"5292070","5295370"," Yeah, I'd really like to buy this $3.97.09. I'll be honest with you. "
"5295770","5297810"," $3.7909. I feel more comfortable."
"5299210","5304290"," You can buy this up here, but it's you know, you're waiting for the one in the the one minute"
"5304290","5305410"," and the five minutes to get up there."
"5305630","5308810"," And without that being up there, it's not safe. "
"5312510","5318570"," And I really always like this this I guess the point here is see this green line right here."
"5319470","5321310"," I always like buying that green line."
"5322870","5324890"," It gets really nice reactions. "
"5326270","5328110"," Nice reactions off the green line."
"5333470","5335430"," You know, this trade higher right here."
"5338720","5340440"," That's a big trade up there, right?"
"5342740","5345940"," You know, something like that would be how it lives to draw this better. "
"5352660","5354940"," I'd really like to see that green line come up here."
"5358980","5365360"," I'd like to see this white line come underneath and this red line come underneath here."
"5367980","5376200"," I don't think we get this, but if we did, I'd be more happier buying a this is price. "
"5376860","5380960"," If this price comes up underneath here, I'd be happier with this trade down here."
"5380960","5389320"," I don't know if that's 397, 398, 396 somewhere in there, but that's a nicer that's a cleaner trade"
"5389320","5389740"," for me."
"5392560","5402160"," You know, even if you trade above here on this on this yellow line, let's see trade above this"
"5402820","5407500"," as it just gets sent back down anyways for this to get picked back up. "
"5407720","5408240"," Does that make sense?"
"5409320","5411200"," It's like traps all over the place up here."
"5411860","5417820"," It's not that we can't, it's that it's that we want velocity to catch back up."
"5418580","5420340"," And here, let's look, let's still look at this. "
"5423980","5426120"," The daily is looking stronger, which is good."
"5426380","5429200"," This is actually positive on the daily is turning up finally."
"5429860","5432600"," We haven't seen that in some time, but this is good to see. "
"5433180","5435580"," It's progress, but the hourly is turning down."
"5435720","5437220"," Do you see here the hourly is turning down?"
"5438460","5440440"," I'm going to see these green bars right here."
"5442000","5449260"," If this hourly continues down, when you get some weakness in the market, right, this is really what"
"5449260","5450560"," you want to be buying is down here. "
"5450620","5452140"," You're buying long calls down here."
"5453220","5454640"," We're not quite there right there."
"5454920","5457380"," You can see that the five minutes starting to turn down. "
"5457940","5460540"," You can see that the one minute starting to turn down."
"5460540","5469110"," I'm, if you're asking me what I think, like what am I looking for?"
"5473480","5486900"," It's probably, at least"
"5486900","5488440"," close this stuff down here."
"5491570","5496030"," Consolidation, then you see that rip up in the end of day, possibly if you like, you want to get"
"5496030","5496370"," bullish. "
"5499070","5503290"," It's probably something like this, at least for me, like, you're like, hey, you want some safety in"
"5503290","5504050"," buying something."
"5504370","5506050"," You know that the hourly is down here."
"5506190","5507630"," You know, you get some gaps down here. "
"5507630","5509870"," You know, you're going to get some consolidation down here."
"5510190","5515610"," You're going to look for bulls to find buyers, to at least take this higher."
"5516210","5521570"," I agree, Chase, that there is a trade here with some kind of Vanna Charmond end of day. "
"5523670","5527010"," But then, you know, let's say, let's say you're looking at calls right now."
"5527310","5528670"," 401s are 83 cents."
"5529870","5532510"," So what are you saying that those are going to be three or four bucks?"
"5534770","5536050"," End of day, I don't know. "
"5539330","5540550"," Two, three, four dollars, possibly."
"5542590","5549930"," But I bet if they came down here and they're worth like 20 cents or something, you know, they're"
"5549930","5552730"," like 20 cents, and then maybe they climb up to 30 cents."
"5553870","5563250"," 40 cents up in here, something like that would be, from a dealer's perspective, you know, they're"
"5563250","5565810"," paying four bucks or 30 cents, right, or 40 cents. "
"5566170","5568490"," So they're paying, you know, they're paying 80 cents in a day."
"5568490","5573550"," So five minutes away now to expect their comments from Fed's Logan, who gives opening remarks as an"
"5573550","5578270"," event on market dysfunction hosted by the Chicago market, who's focused on business."
"5578750","5580650"," Text is expected, but not a few in here. "
"5581150","5587010"," It appears the live stream event is not available anymore, as it's an in person event only, so"
"5587010","5587730"," there's no live stream anyway."
"5588950","5591730"," Now, the longer we spend here, this will be scenario two."
"5591890","5598230"," We spend a ton of time here consolidating and all of this stuff starts pushing up. "
"5598230","5601030"," At some point, right?"
"5604330","5609610"," So the longer that we spend here, the more time it is for that, that thrust to come up and"
"5609610","5610350"," trade higher."
"5611970","5613570"," Because that's scenario two."
"5614650","5618910"," We just keep trading sideways where we are in 401, and then we get that explosive move higher. "
"5620210","5624410"," Scenario three would be we trade above this yellow box right here, consolidate and start squeezing"
"5624410","5626590"," up to that upper target at 406."
"5632540","5634260"," I'm not interested in this right now."
"5634280","5634780"," Are you guys?"
"5635060","5635620"," Let me know in the chat. "
"5635800","5638580"," Are you winky?"
"5638580","5639380"," Can you do a?"
"5641820","5643500"," Yeah, I do have two Ferraris, baby."
"5644460","5646020"," I've got two Ferraris."
"5647880","5650760"," Jeff has a lima with a trailer hitch and a contractor trailer. "
"5652860","5653580"," Tesla, baby."
"5667540","5671400"," He had John M is like, I would love to buy the shit out of that 396 and 397."
"5671420","5672120"," I agree with that. "
"5672600","5673920"," It's like a no-brainer trade."
"5674920","5676080"," It's a no-brainer trade."
"5676920","5678820"," It's like I feel more confident there. "
"5679040","5680240"," I don't feel confident here."
"5680960","5681700"," You know what I do here?"
"5681820","5682700"," I'll tell you what happens here."
"5682900","5684120"," I'm going to tell you exactly what happens here. "
"5685280","5686640"," My experience here is this."
"5688620","5690700"," Not every time, but I'm going to tell you my experiences."
"5691040","5694000"," I come in here and buy a bunch of 401c's, right?"
"5695320","5696280"," I'm loading up. "
"5696600","5701060"," We're spending a ton of time here, and I'm like, I'm going to get to come down to 80 cents,"
"5701360","5702500"," the price that they were earlier."
"5703440","5709060"," And then like 10 minutes later, we're down here, and I'm like, shit, I got to buy again."
"5710020","5711200"," I got a DCA. "
"5711200","5715580"," I got to now I'm like loading up like 300 contracts, trying to get the 80 cent ones down to"
"5715580","5717820"," down to like 30 cents or something."
"5718440","5720340"," Is it the worst part is when that happens?"
"5720720","5722660"," So let's say I buy these at 80 cents, right?"
"5723000","5723940"," I'm going to say exactly what happens."
"5725000","5726560"," Say I buy those at 80, right?"
"5726900","5728300"," And then I DCA down here. "
"5728580","5729720"," Let's say they're worth 20 cents."
"5731560","5733560"," All right, I DCA, and I get it."
"5733620","5736460"," Let's say I get them down to like 36 cents I own them for. "
"5738420","5740180"," And then we like trade higher here."
"5741240","5745860"," And we just stall out at like 34 cents or something."
"5747820","5752060"," And I'm like, I should have sold and just taken the two penny loss. "
"5753340","5755920"," We go back down like 24 cents right here."
"5758760","5759900"," So I'm kind of nonsense."
"5760180","5764060"," So we start going higher right here eventually, and they're like 34 cents or something. "
"5766140","5771520"," So kind of not all this time, I've just like wasted my entire day."
"5774200","5775520"," Doesn't have it every time."
"5775640","5779160"," I'm not saying we're not going to scream higher, just immediately start green barring it up. "
"5779760","5786100"," But my experience has been like at least three or four times out of 10."
"5786360","5788880"," That's what happens when I'm chasing up there."
"5789520","5792360"," It's enough that it's enough that it pisses me off. "
"5793100","5797960"," If it was one out of 10 times, I'd be like, yeah, let's buy it right now."
"5798780","5803180"," But when it's like three or four times out of 10, I'm like, no, dude, I've been up that."
"5803600","5804460"," I've done that before. "
"5804620","5805320"," I don't like doing that."
"5805820","5809420"," Spend the rest of the afternoon, morning and afternoon, just crying about it."
"5809580","5811640"," Surely expecting the text released for that slogan. "
"5813140","5813960"," It's now 10."
"5814220","5817320"," 59 coming into the half hour."
"5819920","5821980"," You know, velocity is rolling over here too. "
"5822140","5824220"," The bears haven't for the next half an hour in my view."
"5824640","5826300"," The hourly is coming down right now."
"5827400","5829160"," I'm going to guess here. "
"5831480","5832240"," How about this?"
"5832420","5832920"," I'm going to guess."
"5839440","5840500"," Well, I don't know."
"5841580","5842400"," Yeah, it's hard. "
"5842560","5843420"," This is a hard one."
"5848430","5850030"," I'm going to guess the day is down."
"5850410","5853350"," If I have to guess here, we're going to have a down day. "
"5853650","5855030"," That's my guess."
"5857570","5860690"," Let me know in the chat if you're bullish here."
"5869330","5873590"," So the Fed remains strongly committed to getting inflation back to the 2% target, and says ongoing"
"5873590","5876170"," increases in the Fed's rate targets are necessary. "
"5877050","5880850"," The Federal Reserve says financial conditions have tightened further since June and are"
"5880850","5884930"," significantly tighter than a year ago, according to a semi-annual monetary policy report."
"5885450","5887270"," Yeah, you won't already look by the level of volatility."
"5887570","5892070"," These remain moderate overall, and this business credit remains strong, but some indicators or"
"5892070","5894230"," future business defaults are somewhat elevated. "
"5894950","5899170"," Extra is market equity remained low in treasury and other key markets versus pre-pandemic lows."
"5899710","5903270"," And the Fed says they expect to return to net positive income at some point."
"5903970","5908830"," And the Fed says that net negative income does not impede monetary policy work, as this underlying"
"5908830","5911150"," momentum in the economy is likely to remain subdued. "
"5911650","5916250"," This is the Fed, again, bringing inflation back to 2%, which likely requires a period of below "
"5916250","5919310","-trained growth and some softening of labor market conditions."
"5919910","5924170"," And the Fed says valuation pressures in the equity market have increased modestly, and says prime"
"5924170","5931830"," and tax exempt money markets, and many bonds and bank loan mutual funds remain susceptible to runs,"
"5932310","5935250"," as is for core services, excluding housing sector."
"5935890","5941590"," Inflation remains elevated, and prospects for its slowing may dependor in part on the easing of the"
"5941590","5942850"," tight labor market conditions. "
"5944010","5948870"," And the Fed says the borrower signs the big stress for low income households as of near prime and"
"5948870","5953830"," subprime delinquency rates have risen, and says core foreign inflation remains high, and inflation"
"5953830","5958850"," repressors are broad, and says the strong reverse repotake up reflects the market reacts, and"
"5958850","5964070"," rates, apologies, and investors caution, and says we will adjust the balance sheet drawdown process"
"5964070","5966130"," if there is a need to."
"5966130","5973490"," And says the Fed says the Fed rates control toolkit effective at maintaining the federal funds"
"5973490","5979450"," rate, and says for most of 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Central Bank's policy rate was well below what"
"5979450","5985010"," monetary policy rules are called for, and says officials mindful of monetary policy rules, and"
"5985010","5986210"," don't use them to drive policy."
"5986710","5991970"," The Fed says tight labor market conditions have largely erased a pandemic induced widening of"
"5991970","5994270"," employment gaps across the demographic groups. "
"5997490","5999090"," Yeah, I'll do PXD for you."
"5999090","6002930"," The Fed says great to have narrowed the gap between policy rule setting and rule world level."
"6003430","6007890"," The Fed's Logan says markets are falling behind on the ability to support treasury market during"
"6007890","6012230"," stress, and says the Fed's Logan says the U.S. financial sector is increasingly vulnerable to"
"6012230","6012510"," shocks. "
"6013270","6018230"," The Fed says the labor force participation rate is likely to remain well above its level before the"
"6018230","6022870"," pandemic level, and Fed's Logan says the Central Bank interventions with complex and face trade "
"6022870","6027410","-offs, and she says the key for the Fed to continue to work on market support plans."
"6027870","6030490"," Fed's Logan says the Central Bank interventions should be rare."
"6031230","6034550"," Fed's Logan does not comment on monetary policy outlook in her speech. "
"6036810","6041090"," Fed's Logan says we need to clarify the terms of bond buying when we are done for market support,"
"6041730","6044690"," and says I'm pleased authorities are working to improve treasury market resilience."
"6055460","6057640"," This dream is sponsored by To The Tick."

"6058500","6064460"," It's three daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up at tothetick.com."
"6069960","6080920"," How do I use my"
"6080920","6081420"," prime switch?"
"6081700","6085120"," I think at the end of this week or next week you'll be able to do the prime thing."
"6085260","6086720"," I appreciate you willing to do that."
"6087440","6089540"," I think next week you'll be able to do it Monday or something. "
"6090200","6090620"," Just hang tight."
"6090740","6093640"," I'll make a video or I'll do a segment on it or something like that."
"6094480","6096420"," But I do appreciate that support. "
"6118040","6121880"," You do see that there revealed that the Fed says financial conditions are tight."
"6122140","6123420"," Talk about shit throwing on the wall."
"6135790","6137170"," You know, we don't need to see. "
"6137350","6143210"," Hey, Chase, if you're out there, we need to see if there's selling calls for puts here."
"6143610","6146510"," It's kind of a big deal to know that right now."
"6151310","6155690"," There's now 178,000 actually just doubled. "
"6156090","6163590"," There's now 187,400Ps there at 70 cents right now for today."
"6169470","6175550"," So people are loading up on puts right now on the options chain and zero dates."
"6182150","6184710"," Yeah, tell them Professor Stock, I agree, man. "
"6186270","6189030"," This looks like call selling and put buying to me."
"6190050","6191050"," That's what it looks like."
"6191070","6195830"," I could be wrong here, but in someone else's chat, I don't know who was saying it. "
"6195990","6197270"," This is a pivotal point here."
"6197310","6200210"," This is expectations show high inflation isn't becoming entrenched."
"6201770","6208750"," So this whole area we're in right now is basically a place, well, excuse me, I'll get some water. "
"6211630","6214650"," So the Fed says ongoing increases in rates will be appropriate."
"6218830","6220010"," Sorry, it's Friday today."
"6220050","6221230"," My voice has died on me. "
"6221930","6224130"," It's been a long week of talking."
"6227970","6230350"," This is a pivotal place in the market."
"6230350","6235390"," And I'll show it to you one more time on on stream here for any of you that's just joining"
"6235390","6235690"," us. "
"6236010","6237330"," You might you may or may not know this."
"6237930","6246290"," Now someone was asking me last night on the phone about this and basically or at the end of day"
"6246290","6247190"," yesterday or something like that."
"6247210","6251270"," So basically there's two things here or there's a few things going on. "
"6251430","6259990"," You have the daily trend that lasts about a month and right where we are, this is where daily trend"
"6259990","6260310"," is."
"6261830","6269310"," This is a lot of stuff going on here between the dealers, between the sell side in the market."
"6269690","6272210"," So you got sell side here that wants to sell here. "
"6272470","6273990"," This is where they want to sell, promise to you."
"6275330","6285170"," Now for them to sell and for dealers to sell, you kind of need us to get over"
"6285170","6285670"," right here."
"6285970","6288150"," You kind of need us to trade above here. "
"6290830","6294950"," So you'd have the promise of, let's say you have the promise of 408."
"6296750","6298230"," So we trade above, right?"
"6300270","6301730"," And now we're above."
"6303450","6304770"," Thank you, Grubsterman. "
"6304910","6305790"," I appreciate that brother."
"6307390","6309010"," Thanks for supporting the channel."
"6309350","6312530"," So the idea here is that you need, we need to get above. "
"6312530","6320630"," And what it does then is it tells a bro, hey man, we can go to 408 and 410."
"6321590","6325090"," So you buy a bunch of calls and you're like, we're free and clear."
"6325390","6326950"," We're going to 408, 406. "
"6327510","6329910"," I can buy calls and safety, right?"
"6330750","6331590"," That's the premise."
"6332590","6335390"," So the dealer sells you a bunch of calls."
"6335890","6336990"," They're expensive right now. "
"6338890","6343890"," You buy them and then you actually fuel a move lower down here."
"6345750","6349250"," Now it's up to you as a bull to buy more calls."
"6349630","6351310"," This is where you get bags, right?"
"6352170","6355770"," You're buying a bag saying it's going to be some money worth to be worth more. "
"6356170","6358490"," Then you buy more of them and you convince somebody else."
"6359590","6362490"," And then we actually go up to try to tag that 408."
"6363550","6368450"," Now a bull's panic and say, oh no, I'm not buying anymore. "
"6368610","6370190"," I'm scared down here, right?"
"6370410","6375010"," The calls that you bought will fuel a move down, right?"
"6375130","6378170"," A nice fat move down."
"6380530","6383550"," So there's like part of that is going on here right now."
"6383650","6385590"," There is that this is happening right now. "
"6386530","6390670"," So you get the promise that we're going to 408, 410."
"6390670","6393130"," And we don't actually go there."
"6393230","6396490"," We're actually roll over and down and you fuel the put side of this market. "
"6399250","6400970"," And puts are cheap right now, right?"
"6401170","6405450"," So there's people out there that are like, well, I know for sure that puts are cheap right here."
"6405930","6408910"," I don't know how deep it's going, but I know that they're dirt, cheap, they can buy."
"6408950","6409850"," They're probably not print. "
"6410050","6414010"," That was a semi-annual monetary policy report on the NISV for those of you that are interested."
"6414870","6418070"," So there's likely this like horse trade that's going on."
"6418530","6423070"," You got call buyers stepping in and they roll it down on you over here, something like that. "
"6423510","6425390"," And this is what bears are looking for."
"6425530","6426870"," I'll be honest with you, I'll tell you right now."
"6427530","6437450"," If you're bears out there watching this broadcast, I'm sure I'm positive that they want"
"6437450","6439690"," to see this kind of a move, right?"
"6440210","6444110"," Either a full on rejection or they don't care about this here. "
"6444210","6445750"," They just know it's getting sent down."
"6448070","6451190"," You know, they're probably going to tell you we're going to 408, right?"
"6452390","6457310"," Now if bulls come back in like a week and they start a week or something, we'll say you bought"
"6457310","6465890"," them on a 396 and bulls start buying again and DCAing, then we can make that trip up to 408"
"6465890","6467150"," and 410, right?"
"6468190","6469570"," So that's what I think is happening."
"6472070","6474030"," We're not getting a full rejection here. "
"6475570","6477350"," We're not just teeing off that."
"6477530","6478990"," We're just not bloodbathing it down."
"6479130","6486290"," The news wasn't bad enough at this point where it was just full on bloodbath here. "
"6487390","6492490"," It does look like there's going to be some consolidation move higher and then you get the role."
"6492590","6493290"," It looks like that."
"6494730","6498510"," It is natural to sell here and look for more support, right?"
"6498730","6503870"," It's natural to come down here, find some support and see if we're actually going to go higher. "
"6505790","6509230"," Now if we don't find the support and those call buyers don't step in, right?"
"6509370","6511250"," We're going to continue to bloodbath it down."
"6513910","6518370"," So right now, if we don't get above and we trade down here, it's probably pretty bullish."
"6519310","6524610"," More bullish than if we come up here and consolidate above and then bloodbath it down. "
"6525710","6527270"," So we are selling right now."
"6527970","6533010"," If you have mine, what I think, if you're a bull, what I think you should do, you're waiting for"
"6533010","6533530"," a pullback."
"6536070","6539790"," Personally, from my perspective, that's what a bull is looking for. "
"6541010","6542210"," What's crazy is this."
"6542990","6544870"," So we're in March 3rd, right?"
"6546550","6551250"," And we've had January and February and we haven't really had a low in the market, have we?"
"6551530","6555570"," This whole quarter, we haven't had a, what's the quarterly low?"
"6555850","6556670"," Let's go look at it."
"6559430","6562930"," I mean, I'm a bull, man, but let's look at this. "
"6566270","6568730"," So I mean, seriously, let's look at this."
"6569750","6572270"," This is January 1 right here."
"6575230","6579070"," So you, you have to be positing right now that. "
"6583010","6583990"," Hold on here."
"6585630","6587470"," I always love this shit."
"6587910","6589730"," Like that's, that's just scroll out for a minute. "
"6597720","6600120"," So it's like, let's be serious with it with each other."
"6600260","6602040"," So this is January 1st right here, right?"
"6602760","6610240"," So basically what a bull is saying is, uh, this is the month, oh, this is the quarterly low."
"6610880","6615620"," Hold on, let's go out to, um, this is March 31st right here, right?"
"6616040","6616940"," March 31st right here. "
"6619380","6622760"," So what you're saying is that we got the high, we got the low."
"6624060","6630320"," Don't forget, we get the pin going on and we usually get the low on, uh, the 17th and they"
"6630320","6637180"," pin us on the 31st, um, you know, what, what these bears are saying is, no, no, no, no, no,"
"6637300","6644660"," we're coming down here for the 17th, maybe even lower, then we'll come back up here and, and, and"
"6644660","6646080"," continue on for the next quarter."
"6646260","6646540"," Makes sense. "
"6647380","6648680"," So polls are pausing."
"6648860","6650560"," This is the quarterly low right here."
"6650740","6651540"," I don't know if it is. "
"6652240","6659220"," Uh, I know for a fact though that right here that these bears are here to sell this ship down"
"6659220","6665860"," in the end of the quarter at 17, 31st, uh, they're, they're, they're going to be trying to sell it"
"6665860","6667740"," here and at 408 and 406."
"6670160","6672540"," Now we can look at a four hour chart."
"6673580","6674920"," You can see it right here. "
"6676700","6678800"," It has teet off right here, right?"
"6686810","6691350"," We're right here trying to sell it right down on the four hour of the daily."
"6694990","6696010"," See it right there?"
"6699010","6701090"," Trying to sell this right down right here."
"6701730","6702610"," That's their plan. "
"6702950","6708400"," Plan is to, so they had to show this on a better."
"6711220","6712720"," So this is a daily chart, right?"
"6712940","6714040"," Here's that big bear plane."
"6717460","6718980"," See this white line right here?"
"6718980","6721340"," This is, this is what a bear wants right here. "
"6722980","6723820"," Can you see that?"
"6723980","6724680"," I don't know if you can see them."
"6724680","6726260"," It's even going to bring it closer so you can see it."
"6727360","6728660"," Let me show you what a bear wants. "
"6731880","6733140"," Maybe I should show this at S."
"6733160","6734660"," We should see if they can show it at SPX."
"6734920","6738020"," Hold on so it's cleaner right here."
"6738580","6739340"," Okay, this is easy. "
"6740120","6741340"," This is a daily chart of SPX."
"6741540","6742840"," I'm going to show you what a bear wants badly."
"6745060","6746640"," And this is the whole thing, right?"
"6746640","6752120"," We know if we trade above this white line right here that we're going to begin to get bullish. "
"6752660","6756060"," So let's, we'll try for the bulls and the bears here."
"6758100","6760120"," But this is what a, this is what a bull wants."
"6763510","6765470"," And they want price to go higher. "
"6767430","6768730"," They're like, fuck yeah, man."
"6768890","6770030"," We're going to knock that shit out."
"6770450","6771290"," Come back down here. "
"6771770","6773590"," We're going to knock that shit out, right?"
"6773790","6774170"," You see that?"
"6774510","6775790"," This is what a bull wants right here."
"6776510","6777670"," Nothing more than this right here."
"6778190","6779010"," Really bad. "
"6779230","6780010"," They want it really bad."
"6781450","6785010"," Now also right here, I'll show it a bear wants."
"6785990","6788810"," It's kind of a pretty decisive place, right?"
"6789490","6796070"," Bears want this to come down and they want this to roll over here. "
"6796370","6797830"," This is a giant bear plane right here."
"6798330","6799670"," And they want a tee off right here."
"6800210","6805650"," These fucking bears, man, they're, they're, and I gave a warning on this right here is bears. "
"6806690","6808310"," They don't care if you come up here."
"6808510","6811670"," They're just looking for that nasty sell down right here."
"6812550","6818630"," Now you have to ask yourself if you're a trader and investor, is there more money here?"
"6819750","6821130"," Or is there, where's the money at?"
"6821230","6821890"," Is it down here?"
"6823350","6824490"," Or is it up here?"
"6824810","6825630"," Where's, where's more money?"
"6827590","6829030"," Oh, and I don't know where it is. "
"6829310","6834110"," I, I can't, I can't call it, but it's definitely a risky place right here."
"6834110","6836990"," This is a risky place to be long in the market."
"6838390","6843590"," You'd want to see price prove to you above here before you take along. "
"6844030","6845330"," Like right up here, you want to see that."
"6848400","6856640"," Right now currently, my view is that to risk you to take along here, I'm waiting, I don't want to"
"6856640","6858240"," see this bloodbath down here."
"6858300","6860760"," If I start seeing that bloodbath, it's going to be nasty. "
"6862060","6867680"," And all you really need is for, all you really need to do is get above this 423 and then"
"6867680","6868560"," people get all bullish."
"6869320","6870340"," I mean, really bullish."
"6870840","6875020"," Like take my hedges off, full port Tesla, full port Google. "
"6877000","6881880"," And once they do that, you know, they're just going to fucking send it right back down."
"6882860","6886620"," You'll have you'll have bears that are scared that were going up."
"6886840","6889000"," Bears will be like, oh, I got to get rid of my short right now. "
"6889560","6890820"," So nobody will be short."
"6891280","6893120"," Bulls will be like, I'm taking off my hedges."
"6893260","6894160"," I'm going full port Tesla. "
"6894960","6897400"," Dealers are going to be like, well, I don't pay anybody that's short."
"6897440","6900840"," And I don't pay anybody that's not paying these dumb ass bulls."
"6901440","6903280"," And they just rip it down on everybody. "
"6904580","6907000"," Meanwhile, bears are stuck with no money."
"6907400","6908800"," Bip bulls are getting destroyed."
"6909060","6910660"," They're just feeling it the whole ride down. "
"6911380","6913760"," And dealers are like, whoo, paying my pockets in here."
"6914460","6915240"," Hedge funds are stoked."
"6915580","6917180"," They're making money banks are making money. "
"6917240","6918520"," They get a cool dip buy down here."
"6919360","6921660"," Both bears and bulls are demoralized."
"6921800","6922880"," Retail's all fucked up. "
"6926100","6930920"," So I mean, that's my only view on this is that that's happening here."
"6931060","6932120"," I think that's happening here."
"6935660","6938520"," But that's what I think is happening on a larger scale. "
"6939280","6940360"," I can be wrong though, man."
"6940500","6944600"," We could go we just we could go stream and hire man trade 408 trade 420."
"6946460","6947880"," There's on a quarterly basis. "
"6948140","6949340"," I'm like, man, I don't know."
"6951500","6953480"," I think we've had a good run as a bull."
"6953640","6954520"," I think we've had a great run. "
"6955360","6958600"," I think this has been an outstanding year so far."
"6960080","6961320"," Yeah, I bought Tesla."
"6961900","6967620"," If I if I if I didn't own another stock for the year, I'll probably beat every bank out there"
"6967620","6968100"," for the year. "
"6968720","6970020"," It made almost a hundred percent."
"6970380","6971640"," It was a great fucking trade."
"6973760","6974820"," So I don't know. "
"6975200","6977000"," I don't know what this I don't know what you guys think out there."
"6978140","6980900"," And now this could take a day could take three days."
"6984480","6985940"," Squeezing up now into these sellers. "
"6986240","6987980"," We'll see if these sellers are real or not."
"6992100","6993380"," And see them right there."
"7000860","7003120"," And they're trying to grind through these sellers right now. "
"7007790","7012830"," For me, I don't think there's a trade here for me personally, but I'm sure for some of you, there"
"7012830","7014270"," are there is a trade here."
"7015610","7020630"," I think the bears are just I think the I think the fucking bears are just sitting here."
"7022830","7028730"," And try to I would bet that there's a bear out there loading the fuck out of puts. "
"7030770","7031910"," Close his laptop."
"7034050","7036310"," Gives us it gives his bear wife a kiss."
"7038230","7040210"," Scratches his young bears back. "
"7040570","7044690"," And he's like a puppy bear is going to be back in a month or two."
"7046090","7053750"," And then the public bear goes out backyard and he lifts up the the door to his out his backyard"
"7053750","7054250"," bunker."
"7055870","7057650"," Climes down the ladder. "
"7059870","7062090"," Cuts off the internet down there."
"7062390","7065810"," Turns off the PAM radio."
"7067730","7069050"," He eats a bunch of cookies. "
"7070930","7076670"," And then he goes over to the to the to the really wet damp dark wall."
"7077270","7082410"," And he chains himself up with some handcuffs to the wall and some chains."
"7085170","7088850"," He's going to chain himself there until his wife comes and gets him in a month or two. "
"7091030","7094050"," I think that's what bears are doing right now at this moment."
"7095470","7098650"," Placing their bets and going down to their bunker for a month or two."
"7106670","7108070"," That's what I think a bear is doing here. "
"7111330","7113450"," Let me know if you're one of those bears I want to know."
"7122450","7126650"," But if you're a bear let me know if you're placing your bets and going down to your basement bunker"
"7126650","7128850"," or your backyard bunker for the next month or two."
"7133930","7142210"," Because I was talking to another well I text another friend last night and I was like I must be"
"7142210","7144610"," the only bearish person coming into this daily trigger. "
"7144630","7148910"," I think everybody else is bullish and I'm like I'm the only person that's bearish here."
"7149430","7151550"," I feel like I'm the only person that's bearish here."
"7158190","7160090"," Yeah you're adding some estal calls here. "
"7160550","7161890"," Yeah I should probably do that too."
"7163390","7165190"," I should probably do that too Joe hold on."
"7176610","7179430"," What are you looking at Joe you looking for June or still in March. "
"7181110","7182550"," Oh they're dirt cheap bro."
"7183830","7185350"," They're dirt fucking cheap huh."
"7194470","7198070"," The 33's are only a dollar 35 out in June 16th. "
"7200750","7201850"," They're looking pretty good."
"7205800","7207560"," Will good morning how are you my brother?"
"7211320","7213700"," John Hagerty says leaves the ham radio on."
"7214840","7217200"," We're approaching sunspot peak season. "
"7219760","7222160"," Row it loaded a bunch of putts yep."
"7224380","7225420"," Right in the money."
"7227040","7229860"," It's a bunker not a complex I have standards. "
"7236080","7238680"," Papa bear loads puts and goes fishing for the day."
"7239580","7247480"," How's uh is uh anybody know how um uh what's his name man I love his uh Derek Kotnoyas."
"7247600","7248720"," He's positioned short here. "
"7249380","7251100"," Anybody know if he's positioned short here."
"7257890","7265070"," Joshua my brother uh so I'll let you know if I'm long."
"7267070","7269710"," I'll let you know my brother I'll tell you. "
"7285900","7288180"," Nordic trade says he's a bleeding bear."
"7289800","7291580"," Yeah Joe I'm looking at him right now."
"7291780","7292320"," What do you think Joe?"
"7292680","7293100"," What month?"
"7295740","7297960"," What month that style of calls are you looking for?"
"7303490","7304710"," Give me a pair of position. "
"7308830","7311450"," Yeah Jimmy Barry's got some nice uh a nice position."
"7311530","7318070"," He's uh Jimmy Barry's in uh Jimmy Barry's in 400 puts for today and 405 calls for Monday."
"7321970","7323710"," Hey John Sabarito how you doing brother?"
"7328310","7329330"," I got you Joshua. "
"7331730","7333690"," Joshua I'm going to make you a uh hey Joshua."
"7334970","7335810"," Question for you man."
"7336490","7338850"," Are you on youtube Joshua?"
"7339150","7339550"," Are you a mod?"
"7339690","7345010"," Did I make you a mod yesterday over in um over in uh Twits or no?"
"7379640","7381660"," All right on brother I want to make sure you're all right. "
"7382840","7384020"," Yeah I'm flat right now."
"7384060","7384620"," I'm not in anything."
"7385360","7389060"," I'm looking at some estal triple leverage uh inverse ETF calls. "
"7390040","7391720"," They're bearish calls if you don't know that."
"7392640","7396680"," Um I'm looking for Joe donut to tell me what what he's looking at."
"7399540","7400880"," Derek seems a little neutral. "
"7401180","7405240"," Yeah uh it's not really a good place here for me."
"7405420","7410000"," I don't like I like direction to show me first where we're going here."
"7410240","7414400"," I'm not a fan of this at all uh directionally. "
"7417180","7419440"," I'll tell you I'll tell you exactly what I'm looking for."
"7419540","7421400"," So Joshua's asking me what I'll be long."
"7422020","7423980"," I would love to buy a long right here. "
"7424800","7426540"," I would love to buy a long right there."
"7426680","7428520"," Even maybe even lower close up these gaps."
"7429220","7430480"," I'd love to buy a long right here. "
"7431420","7437120"," If we get above right here I'd love to take the long here uh right up here."
"7438780","7440600"," Uh I'm flat right now."
"7449940","7452000"," Uh I don't like this right here. "
"7454640","7459520"," And if you want to take a trip to 406-408 there's a there's a meat to that trade right."
"7459520","7462440"," The meat of that trade is not right here."
"7463360","7465300"," The danger in that trade though is right here. "
"7465440","7467380"," Like this is where the danger is to take that trade."
"7468260","7470500"," So the the best part of this trade is above."
"7470940","7472560"," So let's look at it right now. "
"7473420","7475540"," So just like scale out a little bit."
"7475720","7481140"," The best part of this trade is uh if you get above and consolidate and then this is the meat"
"7481140","7481940"," of the trade right here."
"7482020","7482740"," This is where the money is. "
"7484400","7485020"," Makes sense."
"7485260","7486220"," The money isn't right here."
"7486920","7488360"," Uh the danger is right here though. "
"7488360","7489740"," There's a lot of danger right here."
"7491920","7498260"," So for me I don't know just for today uh I'm scared to be long here."
"7503650","7510250"," I'm not scared but just the probability wise there's a lot of danger here to be long. "
"7511270","7516510"," High risk calls are expensive right now at the moment for the rest of the week or we are until"
"7516510","7522270"," Friday or like today they're they're expensive to own."
"7527570","7528510"," See you later Grubster."
"7531970","7533250"," Maybe what you're saying Grubster. "
"7535450","7536990"," You're gonna be here for the bear right on."
"7538290","7541730"," Yeah we're gonna drink some uh bourbon today maybe by 3 p.m. I think we're gonna have at least"
"7541730","7542030"," a bourbon."
"7542550","7543670"," Maybe a maybe a bear or something. "
"7571330","7573250"," You have 17,000 followers on Twitter."
"7573630","7574290"," No shit Joshua."
"7574850","7575410"," I didn't know that. "
"7577510","7579590"," Do I follow you on twitter man?"
"7582110","7583650"," You know scammers when you see him."
"7583650","7585990"," Yeah I got to that shit private man."
"7586810","7587710"," Half dude dude. "
"7588530","7590150"," My friends with you Joshua on Twitter."

"7624920","7625240"," Yeah it was early."
"7625440","7626660"," I thought it was coming two days ago. "
"7627380","7630180"," I thought it was coming um two days ago it didn't happen."
"7630180","7631280"," Then finally happened yesterday."
"7631460","7633020"," Saw the momentum come up and do it. "
"7642700","7644400"," Yeah because I'd like to pick your brain Joshua."
"7644620","7648580"," If you could send me a DM I would like to ask you about all that shit with the scammers"
"7648580","7649400"," and that kind of stuff."
"7650220","7652860"," Like I had to take I had a PayPal Donate button on my Twitter. "
"7653080","7658240"," My public Twitter had to take it off and delete it because people were scamming all over Finto it"
"7658240","7658560"," with it."
"7659060","7663740"," And then I put it on the private handle because the bots aren't in there at least."
"7675640","7680240"," Uh Cala Cabarian saying I'm buying a 10 pack of 394 peas and going down to my bunker. "
"7680280","7684020"," Yeah I understand that man that that makes sense."
"7692190","7694830"," It's a not this is a natural place to sell right here."
"7695210","7696210"," So I get it. "
"7697990","7698930"," I get it."
"7699690","7702530"," This is the place the natural place for bears to take a short position."
"7703510","7705690"," Even if it doesn't print a huge. "
"7706790","7708110"," It's a natural place."
"7708670","7712810"," It is in and around here."
"7737360","7739160"," We're in June 16th. "
"7739820","7741340"," Estile calls at 30 bucks."
"7742360","7744240"," Yeah I'm looking at those right now bro."
"7745600","7746800"," Well you're in at 30. "
"7747680","7749240"," I was looking at the 33s."

"10631100","10639020"," Yeah, I'm looking at, I'm looking at some 403."
"10639480","10640960"," You know what, maybe I'll look at some 403s."
"10642040","10645060"," That was trading the 402s and the 405s. "

"10695900","10696960"," We'll know in the next 10 minutes."
"10699760","10701340"," So it's 12, 20 in the afternoon."

"10746090","10747250"," see it for the next 10 minutes here."
"10749850","10754670"," It's bizarre how they're framing this story here."
"10759950","10769830"," There's a reason why, so these Ukrainians, man, they're basically, it's a defensive"
"10769830","10775210"," tactic to lure in these Russian soldiers, and then you just grind them to dust, and then fall back,"
"10775250","10779770"," and grind them to dust, and fall back, and grind them to dust, and fall back, grind them to dust,"
"10779950","10782210"," and fall back, and you just bloodletting. "
"10785330","10793070"," The news is saying that the Ukrainians are losing back map, but the truth is that it's a tag, it's"
"10793070","10799090"," not just that we call it a tag story treat, but it's not, it's trying to murder as many Russians"
"10799090","10800810"," as possible, but that's the truth."
"10802790","10809010"," And as soon as they, the Wagner forces are getting destroyed, and then as soon as you weaken them,"
"10809010","10812550"," you surge forward, retake your position, and then you fall back slowly."
"10812810","10817410"," It's like this, it's like this forward and backward motion, and it's very destructive. "
"10819730","10828050"," I would not want to be a Russian soldier going into, like how it's reported is not what's actually"
"10828050","10828450"," happening."
"10829950","10831370"," It's very brutal warfare."
"10836170","10840770"," I'm reading that headline down below about the war right now. "
"10841290","10846170"," I can't even imagine, I think at one point I was looking at some of the figures that were coming"
"10846170","10849050"," out there, the Russians were losing a thousand people a day or something."
"10849610","10851310"," I don't know if that's still current, but that was last week."
"10853590","10855350"," It's very brutal warfare. "
"10878240","10879720"," And you're just one second here, okay?"
"10879860","10882580"," We got seven minutes left, I'll be right back."
"10882760","10885300"," I'm gonna go to the bathroom real quick, I'm anticipating this rip-fire."
"10886020","10890600"," I'm gonna try to buy some calls here at the 1230 mark, so we can be just a minute. "
"11033580","11043260"," If you are watching this"
"11043260","11052360"," program on YouTube, I am also on Twitch right now."
"11054520","11055420"," Hold on here."
"11060780","11062860"," I'm gonna buy some 403s right now. "
"11062880","11063540"," I got an order in."
"11064820","11075720"," So if you're following us on YouTube and if you wanna watch on Twitch, Twitch"
"11075720","11082280"," offers pop-out screens for chat, they offer pop-out screens for your video player."
"11082540","11084560"," They're very, it's a little bit easier than YouTube. "
"11085920","11089380"," But if you like YouTube, I understand I was a long time just YouTube user."
"11090750","11091460"," So I get it."
"11094030","11097260"," Great communities in both YouTube and chat, so whichever you like. "
"11099160","11105380"," Or if you're a really cool person, you're probably watching on both YouTube and Twitch."
"11108180","11111160"," Meet one of them, but there's also less lag."
"11112200","11114240"," YouTube natively slows down. "
"11115780","11119860"," Or not slows down, YouTube natively delays streams."
"11120200","11122980"," You have to speed up 15 seconds or so, Twitch is faster."
"11123900","11124720"," It's near instantaneous. "
"11131860","11135760"," I can see both of your, you can see both talking in Twitch in YouTube."
"11136780","11138800"," So I see your comments in both right now."
"11143800","11144960"," Thanks for being on both. "
"11145160","11147100"," That helps too for viewers, so I appreciate it."

"11155300","11156940"," Done long with you for right now. "
"11157200","11159200"," 1228, we got two minutes left until half hour."
"11160900","11165140"," I'm long right now, and we'll see, I've got, I'm gonna hand sell these if I have to."
"11166340","11168540"," The trade is dead if we go below the one minute. "
"11168680","11170660"," That's the white trigger that you see right here."
"11179310","11203630"," We got a PT above right here at 402.60. Coming"
"11203630","11209890"," back up to retest the prior high at 402.33. Remember, we need to get a new high here."
"11210810","11212130"," We don't get the new high. "
"11212230","11214790"," We'll trade down to the red line below."
"11216890","11221090"," Just be, just know right here that we need to get a new high right now."
"11221170","11222650"," If we don't get the new high, right?"
"11223130","11225930"," So right here, we need to get this new high. "
"11226110","11231330"," If we don't get the new high, which is it right here, we will trade back down and retest this"
"11231330","11231870"," five minutes."
"11232090","11233970"," Just be conscious of that as the trade unfolds."
"11235070","11237350"," We're gonna find out if we're bullish or bearish here. "
"11237450","11238950"," Right now, the hourly is very bullish."
"11239850","11243770"," The five minute is bullish, and the one minute's just looking to catch up here in a few moments."
"11256440","11257640"," Not financial advice. "
"11258000","11259080"," You should be paper trading this."
"11260020","11261660"," Don't ever follow me on trades."
"11261980","11264720"," You have to do your own due diligence, your own education. "
"11265660","11269840"," You should seek out the advice of a financial professional, not me."
"11270540","11274840"," Just some guide on a live stream with you trying to hang out with you."
"11274940","11279920"," Think of me more like a Joe Rogan, a bad Joe Rogan, but think of me just like some guy"
"11279920","11283560"," you're hanging out with and chatting with all day long, and with a community of people. "
"11283560","11287620"," Do not take anything that I say as professional advice in any way, shape, or form."
"11291180","11293940"," You should seek out the advice of a financial professional."
"11295400","11298440"," You will lose all of your money if you ever try to follow me on these trades. "
"11299020","11300760"," You will be broke, I assure you."
"11318100","11319600"," I'm getting a failure right now."
"11319660","11320980"," Make sure we don't fail this trade. "
"11320980","11325600"," So we don't want to trade underneath this white line here, that white trigger right there."
"11326080","11329880"," We need to get the next 15 minutes, we have to get a new high."
"11330580","11338380"," So right now it's currently 12.31. One minute into this trade, must get a new high within the next"

"12627390","12630990"," VIX is getting taken out to the woodshed right now."
"12631710","12632210"," It's trading."
"12632710","12635470"," It's very extremely bearish on VIX. "
"12636450","12641330"," Last time it did something like this, it'll blast down like $14 or something."
"12642290","12645390"," Just absolute devastation if it gets up here to this."
"12645610","12647950"," If we did this today, it'd be out of control. "
"12649150","12650870"," We did that for a 640640."
"12651170","12655230"," I don't know we're going to do it today, but dude, have some stops on the market."
"12655670","12656930"," Take some money and run here. "
"12657590","12662670"," Because if you do break through and we do some kind of crazy nonsense like this, I know that sounds"
"12662670","12664910"," out of control like no way that can't happen."
"12665630","12668910"," It's like a .05% chance of it happening."
"12668910","12672510"," But VIX is in like a death spiral right now. "
"12673670","12675090"," Absolute death spiral."
"12675590","12679990"," On the one minute trading 1861, it's trying to form a base, right?"
"12680130","12683070"," So VIX is trying to roll this over right now."
"12683330","12686210"," Right now, VIX is trying to roll over the spy down here. "
"12687530","12691950"," Now if it can't hold this base right here and it starts fucking, it starts bleeding out."
"12695850","12697310"," Very volatile here."

"14120910","14129530"," You've got another trigger down below another place to buy a dip down here and you've got the big"
"14129530","14130670"," clusters right here."
"14133790","14136030"," So I'm waiting I'm going to see what happens here."
"14145020","14145420"," Nice. "
"14146480","14147420"," Good job, Chris L."
"14148960","14152040"," I'd like to buy this down here if I could I'd like to buy this one right here."
"14153240","14154720"," That's a pretty big move right."
"14154900","14156080"," I mean look at that move right there. "
"14165150","14166110"," Big move there."
"14166450","14170370"," I missed this one right here but I took this took that and took that bullshit."
"14170710","14172030"," So I've had most of the move today. "
"14173050","14175670"," Hope you guys have gotten into some of these moves that have happened today."
"14193890","14195910"," Let's see what you guys are saying in the chat here."
"14199950","14202690"," Yeah, Vix is looking well I don't know if it's poised. "
"14203970","14209630"," So Vix could Vix could just trade sideways and start bleeding again."
"14209890","14213070"," So may I get what you're saying I'm watching the Vix too."
"14213730","14220290"," It looks poised to face rep here but Vix could just be trading sideways then start bleeding again. "
"14221150","14222630"," I'll be honest with you that's the truth."
"14224390","14225930"," Now so be careful with Vix."
"14226050","14228990"," Look I know that Vix looks poised here at 1861. "
"14230850","14232470"," It could it could squeeze here."
"14232830","14240980"," There's there's a bunch of gaps above on Vix all the way up to 19 dollars and 20 cents currently"
"14240980","14242260"," there's a bunch of gaps up there."
"14243720","14249460"," So I'm not anti the Vix going up here but it could likely just trade sideways too just as much"
"14249460","14252280"," trade sideways and all this get bought up. "
"14281480","14282720"," We get blood here."
"14287160","14288960"," It's tough to say right now."
"14289880","14295340"," I'm hoping I can I'm watching the clock right now with like I get about 10 more minutes here. "
"14297200","14304580"," I would like to buy this right here if I could personally that's why that's where I want to buy"
"14304580","14304740"," them."
"14305140","14306560"," It's very dangerous here for bears."
"14307480","14312920"," Once we cross this daily trigger you've now got a three trigger cluster right here and it's very"
"14312920","14313360"," bullish. "
"14314260","14320500"," So now that we're above the daily you saw that move there and this would easily rocket ship up"
"14320500","14320680"," here."
"14320800","14321260"," No problems."
"14323800","14325260"," Very bullish here right now. "
"14325260","14327810"," So if you're bearish you have to wait and see."
"14328130","14334030"," I guess you could take this bearish right down here but I wouldn't be I'm not I'm not bearish at"
"14334030","14337930"," the moment right currently in the daily and today pretty fucking bullish in there."
"14337930","14346310"," So I'm not going to get bearish until under here somewhere like I would like to see like this move"
"14347130","14351450"," that move and that's the bloodbath right there so somewhere in there. "
"14351510","14354130"," There's a lot of work in there that needs to be done for bears."
"14354570","14355230"," You got a ton of work."
"14360780","14361860"," That's something you can't get it. "
"14363400","14367820"," If you break underneath the one minute right like we're like prices under the one minute you could"
"14367820","14372900"," take a put here with some stops above and try to trade this one down and you do the same"
"14372900","14378400"," thing take your money and run then take another put above here give me a chart it out for you."
"14378900","14382280"," Maybe I can do that for you if you're bearish here."
"14384900","14391280"," You're just going to tee right off right there something like that. "
"14394820","14402060"," I'd be a little farther out something like the bear bearish trade I'm going to show it to you right"
"14402060","14410060"," there and then we'll try to put up we'll try to snap a line for it something like that"
"14410060","14418900"," so it's actually it's pretty severe so here put this right there."
"14436940","14446420"," Do you see it now if you want to see the the bearish crossover it's right here and you'd"
"14446420","14453540"," see this develop here but the biggest part of this trade is the biggest part of this bear trade is"
"14453540","14462800"," below the biggest part of the bear trade is down here this is where the money is right here you"
"14465900","14475200"," want to see price come down here reject and then blood bath right there we"

"15013130","15023050"," this um okay so vix is gaining some ground here this is the vix we could see some"
"15023050","15029970"," weakness in the market see how price is getting over the five minute right now and we're having a"
"15029970","15037130"," two trigger cross it's not extremely bullish but if you look at if you look at down here right it's"
"15037130","15042130"," starting to roll right when you start to see this roll like this see that little little green bar"
"15042130","15048550"," that just peaked it set out right there see that little tiny green bar oh it's lower than these two"
"15048550","15054110"," right here it's a little hint and you see you probably see some bullishness here in the one and"
"15054110","15060350"," five minute at least the hourly is starting to turn bare so I'm gonna tell you on the hourly okay"
"15060350","15066170"," currently the market is starting to so the the the bullish momentum is starting to lose them with"
"15066170","15074730"," momentum currently if price stays above 1877 on vix you're gonna expect the vix to attempt at least"
"15075250","15083530"," to trade to 1940 at least 1940 I'm gonna give you a call price target to the vix right there"
"15083530","15093730"," and then another one right in here okay so you could see some it's 133 let's"
"15093730","15098210"," say we get some intraday this might be a time of the day for you to take a break and"
"15098210","15103670"," not give back everything you made just hear my warning okay and I want to show you that down below"
"15103670","15109470"," you see that little green bar right there it's giving you a hint on the hourly and you can kind"
"15109470","15113430"," of see the five ready to come up here and do its thing the one minute to do its thing"
"15113430","15121670"," it's not gonna get crazy bearish but it's showing you right now that we're in like some intraday"
"15121670","15130430"," bullshit so on the vix okay we're gonna get rid of that green box I don't think that's a buy"
"15130430","15138210"," for you as a bull you could see some intraday weakness here you could start to see at least"
"15138210","15143590"," something like this down here okay now we want to see if these buyers are still here now it's not"
"15143590","15150810"," going to be crazy bearish or nothing like that but just keep your eyes on the next hour next hour"
"15150810","15160740"," so right now it is uh legend 2 x 2 2 x baby hell yeah so look"
"15160740","15169280"," I want you to see this it's 135 okay mark this moment in the show it's 135 I'm gonna expect"
"15169280","15175660"," some some middle of the day bearishness here just some middle of the day now how do we know if"
"15175660","15185620"," that if that bearishness finishes right and I'm gonna show you the way if we recapture 40285 null"
"15185620","15194920"," and void we can get bullish again okay if we bounce off of the red trigger down here"
"15194920","15202140"," and then the white trigger comes underneath and becomes supportive so your next place to look for"
"15202140","15214150"," would be this this crossover right here and"
"15214150","15222470"," for price to only come on down and fight this white line right and then find some support down here"
"15222470","15227950"," and then some kind of a move like that higher okay that's my that's what I think the most"
"15227950","15236530"," bearishness is so far some like that that's as bearish as I'm feeling right now some like that now"
"15236530","15245270"," if it starts to do this weirdness where we start getting evil bearish like we get the roll over"
"15245270","15253630"," here we get the roll down there we get a big old bearish crossover i'll get bearish with it over"
"15253630","15259270"," here if we see something like that we start bloodbath and it down we'll we'll just keep an eye on"
"15259270","15269230"," that next hour unless we get above unless we get above 40285 or wherever that white line is"
"15269230","15275690"," if price doesn't get above that white line i'm going to look for what's called some consolidation"
"15275690","15290930"," here just some consolidation down in here some chop not"
"15290930","15300180"," bearish just chop that's what i'm looking for"
"15300180","15310180"," and what i'm going to keep my eyes on right now is uh 400p so 400p"

"16972590","16976450"," you can see the VIX here is a couple things we'll look at we maybe use some of this stuff"
"16976450","16988000"," here so see the VIX is starting to get bullish here in the one minute then move that over all"
"16991940","17001710"," right good we're getting close oh wait a minute we had a speaker that was coming on today let me"
"17001710","17017860"," see if he'll come up let me see if he'll come on i missed his message earlier uh hold"

"17027780","17037580"," go over this stuff okay so let's look at uh oh yeah"
"17037580","17045620"," brother Esau just said nailed my full port 402c from 52 cents average love you bro but a fall over"
"17045620","17050620"," two years now appreciate showing me your velocity charts what a game changer to see the backdrop of"
"17050620","17059500"," the market right on man right on you have a gap here on VIX right up at 19 10 19"
"17059500","17067880"," 20 oh which you know they need to be closed right we know that stuff needs to be closed do"
"17067880","17073520"," you get that closer today or not i don't know what the answer to that is does it roll down"
"17073520","17080260"," some more right does it keep rolling down here or not does it happen today does the market just"
"17080260","17086140"," bleed off into this bell gets down here to these these lower numbers if the market goes up we don't"
"17086140","17093180"," know the answer to that right but we're going to look at a higher time frame with the VIX let's"
"17093180","17097700"," check out the five minute real quick uh it's down here at the bottom right we know we get bottoms"
"17097700","17103640"," down and this is back on February 15th right we get a bottom back here in February 15th on on"
"17103640","17111560"," the VIX let's look at a 15 like it might want to come back up again but you know bears"
"17111560","17117000"," are going to tell you out there that um you know it's the bottom right if you're a bear this"
"17117000","17120080"," is what you're doing you're buying here you're buying here you're buying here you're buying here"
"17120080","17127060"," you're buying here uh so that does blend the question to do we sell off into the clothes does it"
"17127060","17132180"," mean that we sell down in the clothes so the idea would be we either we were either going to"
"17132180","17138860"," sell this clothes uh maybe we sell oh my god that's my point my point here is that if we"
"17138860","17146260"," sell the clothes uh maybe sell Monday and then we come back down or something like that right you"
"17146260","17152140"," can see it right there on a 15 minute chart if we start ripping face into the bell you're probably"
"17152140","17157180"," going to be short in the market into Monday right kind of kind of guess that if we rip face"
"17157180","17162740"," into the clothes today that the VIX is going to slam down to the 17 there is something fascinating"
"17162740","17168760"," here though and that would be that we haven't talked about yet which is uh if there's a bullish"
"17168760","17176260"," confirmation to the upside and not the downside for march that we trade for 20 or 430 then they"
"17176260","17182080"," would want to reprice the VIX even lower than 17 or 18 they're gonna want to re what we printing"
"17182080","17188480"," money right now holy shit we are printing money amazing we're printing money right now outstanding"
"17188480","17197280"," standing my calls are breaking money right now so there could be a re-pricing event of the VIX if"
"17197280","17204460"," the move is up if the move is up the move is to 420 and 430 if that proves itself"
"17205060","17210960"," they're gonna fucking re-price the VIX they guarantee it I know it doesn't sound logical but they"
"17210960","17217600"," could they could actually re-price the VIX shockingly and I'll explain why that isn't a little bit"
"17217600","17222780"," but next five minutes I'm going to explain why that is for you why they would re-price the VIX"
"17222780","17230940"," and why it's so important what what it means so we'll look at that right now actually and the"
"17230940","17237160"," expectation for next week and let's just look at this is the spy here right look at the spy you"
"17237160","17240240"," know that the this is what the bulls are going to tell you bulls are going to tell you that"
"17240240","17246600"," we're going way back up here we're gonna go way up here to this 407 408 they're probably going to"
"17246600","17251600"," tell you that we're going to 412 420 they're going to be like I'm super bullish here bro we're"
"17251600","17258140"," going up here we're going to do 410 then we're going to go 420 above super bullish super bull up"
"17258140","17266260"," here there's some places for bulls to be fearful failure to close this gap right here is a big one"
"17266260","17272600"," okay this is that uh instant this is the first instant short right the first automatic shorts right"
"17272600","17282580"," here your next automatic short is right here at 406 59 407 57 they will attempt to sell this"
"17282580","17291280"," market down above at 406 59 their next short is above there at 410 to 412 right the next ones"
"17291280","17297780"," I think at 420 for this market so just be aware of those as I will put the next we'll"
"17297780","17302680"," put this one back up here for the next one so you've got your next automatic short of failure at"
"17302680","17310960"," 406 59 right we are above on the 15 minute we are trading above the one minute on the one"

"17339470","17348690"," trade off is it's still bullish that makes sense this is a bullish trend reversal oh man I'm making"

"17413280","17418560"," right you retrace some of this stuff you come back down to 400 that's going to be a key level"
"17418560","17427200"," for next week 400 key level for bulls super key level next key level is going to be 402 and"
"17427200","17430900"," I'm going to show you why that's a key level here in just a moment so we already know our"
"17430900","17440760"," two key levels 400 402 roughly 400 402 then if you look above"

"17482820","17489480"," Tuesday right couple couple down days and then a resumption higher makes sense tag the lows tag the"

"19371860","19381740"," yeah big point's done yep and then and why is that and there's a decoupling uh that just took place"
"19381740","19387940"," and of course that panics even more so then if spy goes down and big plane goes down there's not"
"19387940","19393160"," that much panic right like oh we're both going down but if you have any kind of decoupling of a"
"19393160","19400480"," crypto it's it can be very scary for the crypto bros yeah definitely so do you want to give you"
"19400480","19407800"," take on what's going on right now sure yeah so i um i was just going to give a kind"
"19407800","19413560"," of a review of what happened with silver gate for people that don't know people that do know a lot"
"19413560","19418860"," about crypto and know a lot about um silver gate and fdx and what happened they might like cringe a"
"19418860","19424240"," little and i might not have everything right but you guys already know this anyways um yes the"
"19424240","19430520"," silver gate it's like you know the bank for crypto institutional investors um so there's like"
"19430520","19435280"," there's silver gate and then there's signature bank i think silver gate's based out of california"
"19435280","19440960"," signatures out of new york and i believe signature is trying to like get away from like crypto"
"19440960","19445300"," banking um yeah because like a normal bank you"
"19445300","19455000"," can't like you can't um you know transfer money at"
"19455000","19464340"," 2 a.m on a Saturday yeah um yes over here they had massive exposure to fdx and the downturns"
"19464340","19471860"," crypto market um they're they were the bank for you know a lot of the crypto institutions um all"
"19471860","19476960"," the institutional players like ftx you know the second largest crypto exchange in the world and"
"19476960","19484440"," then alameda the the largest market maker and then they also um service like loans for micro"
"19484440","19493220"," strategy um they also did um mara which is the largest um crypto miner or they hold the the most"
"19493220","19502300"," um mine crypto i think riot might have a larger market cap now um and then emeta um facebook you"
"19502300","19508300"," know they were going to partner with silver gate for their dm like stablecoin and then we met a"
"19508300","19514980"," kind of flopped um you know then um actually silver gate bought the technology and liking"
"19514980","19521660"," everything behind the dm stablecoin so so the reason why everyone's talking about like silver gate"
"19521660","19527460"," is because ftx that when they collapsed it caused a bank run on on silver gate um they had like"
"19527460","19533320"," over eight billion dollars in withdrawals and so they had the liquidate um to be able to process"
"19533320","19540780"," the draws i think they sold like a bunch of bonds um but they they took a loss of yeah"
"19540780","19546360"," i've seen like 700 million i'm pretty sure the law i mean the the loss they reported in last"
"19546360","19552260"," quarter was over a billion dollars which is a lot of money because they for them now because they"
"19552260","19560820"," that's more than all the profit that they've ever made um i think they're net income last year or"
"19560820","19567080"," actually let's do 2021 because they they lost a billion dollars 22 quarter four and net income 2021"
"19567080","19575460"," was 76 million dollars so they you know they lost a billion dollars in one quarter last year so"
"19575460","19580680"," pretty bad and then the department of justice is investigating them because they they were the bank"
"19580680","19590660"," for ftx and they allowed um sam bigman free to uh transfer customer funds to alameda um"
"19590660","19595940"," i'm not sure if silver gate has like blocked by exposure but i would say i mean they're involved"
"19595940","19601940"," with like all big players they probably have exposure to like everything everything in crypto um"
"19601940","19606320"," they laid off forward so so now um i had you have some notes here so i'm kind of cheating"
"19606320","19616160"," but it's okay you can see i guess is there would bitcoin decouple from the wall street markets"
"19616160","19624100"," or is doesn't have too much exposure where it will at some point leak into our stock market i don't"
"19624100","19633620"," i don't think that yeah i i i don't i i don't think that it will cause like normal equity"
"19633620","19642560"," structural yeah i mean aside from the exposure with like like companies like coinbase and mara and"
"19642560","19648060"," riot and you know i mean there's probably like 20 tickers that i can think of but i i think"
"19648060","19654460"," that's all like segregated i don't think it'll affect anything um and in the real market and i mean"
"19654460","19662140"," we've seen the crypto market cap go from three trillion dollars to one trillion and nobody batted"
"19662140","19667380"," an eye and now in the stock market i mean it's just the crypto companies that are collapsing and"
"19667380","19675380"," everyone else is kind of like you know cool do you think that um do you think it'll it'll collapse"
"19675380","19681760"," down into a digital dollar do you think that there's no real future for the scale of crypto do you"
"19681760","19688120"," think it's going to continue to grow do you like your replacement at the currency what's a long"
"19688120","19697400"," term view on let's say bitcoin just the general idea good bad do you think that it's i"
"19697400","19706440"," think that it's going i i think that like trading crypto right now or holding crypto holding"
"19706440","19714680"," bitcoin is like holding like a tech company or like a yeah very speculative asset with the"
"19714680","19723100"," additional downside of more collapsing of like you know way over leveraged firms or traders or"
"19723100","19728820"," something going you know with with fine answers the stablecoin collapse anything like that yeah i"
"19728820","19733220"," think it's just like a speculative trade i i think you know if you if you were to think that"
"19733220","19737320"," we're in like the biggest bull market ever then yeah buy something that's like super speculative"
"19737320","19744920"," and everybody has all this free money but i i i don't think that's where we are and um yeah"
"19744920","19750040"," i i i i'm not i mean everybody here knows i'm not a fan of crypto and bitcoin yeah i"
"19750040","19753520"," know i know everybody does but i think that they want to ask i think the reason i ask you"
"19753520","19759600"," this was because uh i think they see your persona on social media and then i bet that all these"
"19759600","19764440"," people like i just want to ask him to his face i just want to talk to him once um"
"19764440","19772160"," you know in person or here's voice on this topic i feel i think the same way uh personally about"
"19772160","19779260"," uh i i think when the rise the recent rise of crypto for me uh looked like the wild west"
"19779260","19785440"," but it also reminded me of the silver days um when we had the hunt brothers down in texas the"
"19785440","19792160"," government just stepped in and took over it was just squash big wild west days and silver and then"
"19792160","19796760"," that would then they just wrapped that shit up like it was nothing and to me i look at it"
"19796760","19804660"," from um sovereign nations uh go to war over uh very few things one of them of course is wealth"
"19804660","19810500"," and currency and uh when you fuck with a where even when you mess with uh with a nation's currency"
"19810500","19819340"," uh i think that it gets it gets crushed and there's no way around that so that's how i view"
"19819340","19823600"," it and i think that day is coming so i think the wild west days for me i'm like yeah"
"19823600","19828300"," i get all the the speculation in the wild west part of it but i think ultimately the end game"
"19828300","19834620"," of of cryptocurrency in general is that's an outside thing right it goes back into having its place"
"19834620","19841060"," uh but the speculative speculative part of it is going to be toned down at some point sure like"
"19841060","19846920"," silver it would remind me of silver years later i don't you know the hunt brother story i'm"
"19846920","19851460"," assuming if you don't uh there's some really cool documentaries and books about the hunt brothers"
"19851460","19858460"," what they did you know that story about the hunt brothers and uh of course oh fuck yeah right cool"
"19858460","19863620"," but some other people might not know if you want yeah the listeners i'm assuming are the watchers"

"22343350","22350750"," only take those trades once every every one to three months like a known winner if that means"
"22350750","22356830"," you're buying stock that's what it is it doesn't matter what the strategy is if that means you're"
"22356830","22363950"," putting money into a savings account and making your five or six percent in a year something"
"22363950","22371190"," guaranteed money market account 401k and it's like free money that's the key about investing is"
"22371190","22377730"," like if i put five bucks into a savings account and i make five percent let's say that's the money"
"22377730","22386840"," that i've got to trade with um if you think people are Quinn baby"
"22386840","22394800"," Quinn is in the house a man Quinn is in the house you have to have a way that that"
"22394800","22401320"," that always makes money that's like step one is you should never be ever like i would never trade"
"22401320","22408500"," money that um i'm gonna get fucked on the next thing too is uh i have separate accounts for"
"22408500","22417040"," different things right uh and then i take money out of the market invest it but for me it's housing"
"22419400","22424100"," uh so that i've always got a way to generate money so right does it make sense if i'm day"
"22424100","22431740"," trading personally i take a thousand bucks and i trade that up you might have like i'm trading it"
"22431740","22437500"," 10 grand or 15 grand or 20 grand or 30 grand as soon as i hit that number that money"
"22437500","22446640"," comes out it's back to a grand again and it has to be small man you start small maybe for"
"22446640","22452820"," you it's 10 grand whatever it is for you right it should be a small percentage of your net worth"
"22452820","22459680"," and not you guys shouldn't be like no i do understand there are people out there that are trying to"
"22459680","22466360"," build accounts so they're like hey i got a job and i get an extra thousand bucks a month so"
"22466360","22471620"," let that shit ride trying to hit the big time i know people do that i get that people do"
"22471620","22475800"," that i know that that happens out there so if you're one of those guys then nope i get that"
"22475800","22482560"," i understand completely but if you're making your living off this shit uh day trade is not the way"
"22482560","22488440"," uh it is not the way to do it it's the way to stay sharp in the market it's the"
"22488440","22493140"," way to stay in in active in the market it's the way for you to know what's going on in"
"22493140","22497660"," the market we have a break right now the one minute trying to trade down and touch that trigger"
"22497660","22503280"," down on the red line right here but you have to know that okay and then the reason i'm saying"
"22503280","22510740"," that too is because if you blew up your account earlier in the week you had ample opportunity later"
"22510740","22515320"," in the week to make that money back and be green right so let's say you started with like a"
"22515320","22521320"," hundred dollars and you burned it all but that's all you had for money you had no opportunity later"
"22521320","22525440"," in the week to make it a green week with another hundred bucks right so if you'd start the week"
"22525440","22530080"," with 50 bucks or 10 bucks and you had a bad week and you were able to come in with"
"22530080","22534420"," like an extra 10 and go all right so it didn't go my way for two days and now i've"
"22534420","22539720"," got another 10 bucks to make back the the losses that i had you know i structure that for myself"
"22539720","22544620"," like day trading account it's like week by week is what i'm looking for to have consistently green"
"22544620","22554380"," weeks every week and i'm not trading like that that initial a thousand bucks i'm not like"
"22554960","22560560"," oh i size my trades up as i make more money but um if i blow that up let's say"
"22560560","22566660"," let's say i blow 20 grand right now i'm not like going in with another 20 grand does it make"
"22566660","22573320"," sense uh you know that's what happens a lot of times is uh let's say let's say i let's have"
"22573320","22578460"," a hundred thousand dollars i'm like wow i made one kick-ass trade i'm a genius i made a hundred"
"22578460","22584220"," grand and so then i start small i'm like okay i'm gonna i'm gonna only spend a thousand dollars"
"22584220","22590440"," again and then i get the 20 grand or something and i lose that 20k so i like like fuck"
"22590440","22594980"," this i'm going in with another 20 so you start doing that shit and you lose everything fast it's"
"22594980","22602200"," gone right before you know it that hundred thousand dollars is zero so you can't be doing that shit"
"22602200","22609400"," either i'm going to be honest with you"
"22609400","22618400"," for the number of times that i've actually blown up full accounts like all my money gone uh i want"
"22618400","22625140"," to say at least at least 15 times maybe i mean like not like 500 thousand bucks i mean like"
"22625140","22635040"," big ones six-figure shit and uh i learned you eventually learned lesson if you"
"22635040","22639780"," don't learn your lesson you'll never come back to the market you either learn your lesson or you're"
"22639780","22646000"," just gonna get blown the fuck out for one last time you're gone well so you have to learn your"
"22646000","22652020"," lessons when these things come come down your way uh and structure your investing and your trading"
"22652020","22659400"," and any of that stuff to escape those major issues that investors and and uh traders encounter um"
"22659400","22664780"," and personally my favorite one is to get your money out of the fucking stock market like if you"
"22664780","22669400"," make a hundred grand and a big trade or something that shit should come out of the market and put"
"22669400","22676380"," a mark from closing in balance 78 million to the buy side no you're an appreciating asset and let's"
"22676380","22679980"," say that appreciating asset makes you some money and you want to come back and fuck around in the"
"22679980","22685800"," stock market just do it have fun man it's just like going on vacation right it's like buying a"
"22685800","22691020"," sports car or something that's gonna burn uh eventually in cost and maybe it will be worth nothing"
"22691020","22697000"," right depreciating asset you can do that that's fine because that's what makes you happy um but you"
"22697000","22709040"," have to have ways to have income coming in uh to to live like this yeah you"
"22709040","22718300"," have to yeah that was a big one for me i got rid of all my debt too"

"22753620","22759780"," you to do they're critical and they're they're not easy to get over as you think they are those are"
"22759780","22765080"," the other thing i was wanting to do that and i was like man getting to that point took me"
"22765080","22773880"," years of brutal almost poverty not poverty living but forced poverty on myself uh to get there"
"22773880","22782470"," and it's not fun doing that it i'm not going to lie to you and tell you that uh it's"
