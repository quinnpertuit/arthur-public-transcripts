"iCHROUyWGi0","13980","17120"," but for me I'd like to see the I'd like to see the confirmation of the actual role below the early trigger to take that trade"
"iCHROUyWGi0","17120","26720"," or price and then we get to roll to the downside I could be wrong too but where we are right now is not too bad 471 like"
"iCHROUyWGi0","26720","37260"," even if we traded 475 just build the spread that can absorb that time enough to roll down and tag that 462 that's your target by the"
"iCHROUyWGi0","37260","47100"," the way 462 is your target we can go lower but that's your target that's your spread target you take the money and run and"
"iCHROUyWGi0","47100","59380"," then you take on the next trade from there lower if we go if we end up going lower trade that 420"
"iCHROUyWGi0","90380","102940"," I'm not saying there's not a chance but there's always a fucking chance but betting your money on 3500 get fucked anybody out there pimping that shit that'll"
"iCHROUyWGi0","102940","110940"," net shit is out of the fucking minds well unless they know something we don't know they could be something unknown maybe they know"
"iCHROUyWGi0","110940","115700"," something they're betting this on a war or something or somebody dying or terror stack from telling you what outside that shit"
"iCHROUyWGi0","115700","122700"," they're out of their fucking minds and 3500 the door was closed on already you need rate cuts man it ain't happening unless you get rate cuts"
"iCHROUyWGi0","122700","131700"," that or something unknown I promise you dude that ain't fucking happening you're out of their fucking minds you're getting one more bull run right now"
"iCHROUyWGi0","131700","142700"," that's what's lined up at least you're looking for a likely a march low could give you an exact date but I'm just giving you an exact date"
"iCHROUyWGi0","142700","149700"," I could give you an exact date but I'm just going to give you an exact date I'm there in and around you want to know a little"
"iCHROUyWGi0","149700","157700"," you're looking to buy I got the dates when I got that calendar because I'm going to give you guys a bunch of dates to for the year"
"iCHROUyWGi0","157700","165700"," and you're going to go and you're going to put these dates into your phone Gmail and you're going to set an alarm about a week before and then you're going to set an alarm for the day"
"iCHROUyWGi0","165700","176700"," for the date trading day and the first one's going to alert you hey start thinking about a bottom and then you're going to have an actual date where you should be tagging a bottom in and around there"
"iCHROUyWGi0","176700","191700"," now that's not guaranteed you have to compare that with market conditions but you need to be aware of it so the expectation here for your yearly low is the 57th trading day"
"iCHROUyWGi0","191700","200700"," 56th trading day of the year and I got my new calendar I got my you guys haven't seen it yet I got my new calendar my hot guys calendar"
"iCHROUyWGi0","200700","210700"," and you should get one for yourself I like it on paper so I can show you guys hot guys so the 57th trading 56th trading day of the year"
"iCHROUyWGi0","210700","220700"," anybody know what a pop of their head it's March 21st so in and around March 21st of this year you're looking for buy the fucking dip"
"iCHROUyWGi0","220700","238700"," now if that's 380 480 enough for you like 380 350 or something like that sure I suck it I suck at price so if you want you think it's 380 350 so be it but right around that 56th day that's 21st of March"
"iCHROUyWGi0","238700","249700"," that's your first dip buy for the year if you're an investor you're looking to buy that low now there's another low coming on the"
"iCHROUyWGi0","250700","254700"," should be on the 90"
"iCHROUyWGi0","255700","262700"," 90 second or 91st trading day of the year that is where"
"iCHROUyWGi0","266700","272700"," that's May 10th or 12th somewhere in there in that weekend you guys writing this down"
"iCHROUyWGi0","273700","281700"," and then you're going to have the next big dip buy for the year is going to be on the hundred and 88 day of the year"
"iCHROUyWGi0","283700","297700"," that is in or around September 30th so there you go September 30th will be your next buy for the election season so I just gave you the three"
"iCHROUyWGi0","297700","312700"," three buys for you this year all free so those are your three dip buys for the market this year hopefully you guys will listen to when I gave them to you"
"iCHROUyWGi0","312700","317700"," if you weren't you're going to get them an expectation for the year when to be buying"
"iCHROUyWGi0","328700","335700"," you should see a little quick liquidation break sometimes you see a little quick liquidation break freaking people out"
"iCHROUyWGi0","335700","341700"," you're thinking some 4000 this year I'll bet you that it doesn't"
"iCHROUyWGi0","341700","354700"," I'll bet you and I'll say I would say this though if there was a downside move the deepest it should go is 38 to 3900 that would be the worst case scenario"
"iCHROUyWGi0","355700","373700"," so if you had like a high probability like 30% 15 to 30% chance I would say give it a 15 to 30% chance you could possibly get to 3800 3900 but I don't think that's your I don't think you trade to that you can trade to that"
"iCHROUyWGi0","373700","386700"," if we let's go get the 4000 I think we get to I think I have it that we go we're getting a 42 or 4100 as the low that's the expectation that the low is like I think it's 41 to 4200 I got it on a chart here you guys are going to get the access to it"
"iCHROUyWGi0","386700","401700"," that you can get an extension of the downside of 30 to 3900 it's possible but at that point that would be wrapping up my short right to like wrapping up that low target of 42 to 4100 and then day trade the rest of it down to that number"
"iCHROUyWGi0","401700","412700"," that's just said takes specs below 4000 this year so if you do expect that right I'm on board with you to about 42 to 4100 somewhere in there I'm on board with you"
"iCHROUyWGi0","412700","425700"," I'm not on board with you to 38 or 3900 or any lower and if we do go down to that price I would be like weeklies or monthlies when we're there I would take that trade but I'd be wrapping up the trade"
"iCHROUyWGi0","425700","438700"," but I'm not sure you have something there's a lot of fucking sellers they'll be wrapping up that trade to around that 42 and 4100 so just we can go there just don't be trading to it don't be like yeah my spread is I don't know 3800"
"iCHROUyWGi0","438700","451700"," my the width of my spread is 38 and 3850 or something right you do that shit you get close but not no cigar no time left you know your spread is going to start burning as we head in as we get down there but don't hit it it'll start burning so be careful"
"iCHROUyWGi0","451700","457700"," whatever however you structure that trade"
"iCHROUyWGi0","457700","467700"," yeah I'm to warn you guys guys are biggie mark the fucking time in this video as we'll revisit this shit I promise you"
"iCHROUyWGi0","467700","475700"," but I'm just sure you have it remember something too man when somebody's telling you right remember something here right I want you to remember something"
"iCHROUyWGi0","475700","490700"," earlier this morning I was talking to you about you don't know you don't know here let me say something to you guys okay you guys aren't going to believe this I encounter this a lot with"
"iCHROUyWGi0","491700","512700"," service for the price of one month I'm gonna tell you guys something okay this is true there are people out there that you and I listen to okay with a million followers right whatever free 400,000 500,000 million followers right if I was taking a position"
"iCHROUyWGi0","513700","534700"," for a downside move into 41 or 4200 right if I was taking that position with let's say 20 million dollars right 20 million dollars right it would be easy for me especially if I had the right people following me I mean like on Bloomberg"
"iCHROUyWGi0","534700","551260"," and see if you think about the larger picture here think about the commercial traders okay commercial traders these are hedge fund guys right not guys unfintuit like a guy that knows I'm doing right but then I get to know a guy like the guy that maybe it might be on"
"iCHROUyWGi0","551260","580260"," fintuit right I need to push a narrative that we're gonna go to 3800 so that I can print my 41 or 42 does that make sense to you so I'm only looking to print 41 or 4200 but I need to publicly tell you we can go to 38 so that they get the expansion of puts down to 3800 to just tag the 41 right so I tell you we're going to 5000 we actually go to 48 my positioning is to exit at 48."
"iCHROUyWGi0","581260","610260"," And I can actually move markets with that sentiment right that you think that so the Kool-Aid right this is Kool-Aid for the bulls and the bears so just think about that when you're looking for that under 4000 because you're trusting some guy on CNBC and then some guy that's regurgitating in unfintuit their motivation might be for the range expansion to that 3800 but not the target what those people end up doing too is what"
"iCHROUyWGi0","611260","630260"," they tell you 3800 or 3500 let's say we had a pit and fucking I don't know 4100 or 4000 let's say but not the 38 or 39 right and what do they do we have we bounced right they closed their position already you hear it from like guys like Mike Mike Mike Barry right"
"iCHROUyWGi0","631260","639260"," he comes or they have to show publicly what he was trained was he closed like what weeks before it comes public right and usually when they're right you're like oh they were calling for this but they closed their position already."
"iCHROUyWGi0","640260","652260"," They closed anyways if this higher or higher low or whatever they did bulls do the same thing but just be careful of what you're when you're hearing these people regurgitating goes down the line down the line to the guy that you listen to"
"iCHROUyWGi0","652260","666260"," they're probably getting it from somebody that's positioned only 4100 they're not positioned to the 38 and I know we got the 38 on the SPX on the JPM collar and stuff like that but speak care what we actually do."
"iCHROUyWGi0","671260","681260"," You can trade it just don't bet your whole fucking bank on it like just take the money and run at the 41 or 42 day trade the rest of it down if we go down there."
"iCHROUyWGi0","682260","692260"," Same thing that's I do that show the upside you guys see me do this right take a nice spread ride it up take the money and run and then I if we keep climbing I just keep trading it up trading it up trading up to the role."
"iCHROUyWGi0","693260","695260"," Be aware of that okay."
"iCHROUyWGi0","704260","713260"," Yeah you know war is not so bad though why don't you guys understand something remember when I say this okay gotta be fucking crystal clear in this."
"iCHROUyWGi0","714260","720260"," Unknown news is not the fucking news that the banks already know got to be clear on that okay."
"iCHROUyWGi0","721260","723260"," It's like unknown news is different."
"iCHROUyWGi0","724260","726260"," I gotta get some books I gotta get a list of books for you guys."
"iCHROUyWGi0","727260","740260"," There's books of X like Goldman Sachs guys they do they do they go to like they go to like Yale and shit and talk about this there's there's like long lectures you can watch on this stuff these guys are like the fucking CIA."
"iCHROUyWGi0","741260","743260"," Talking about unknown news to them."
"iCHROUyWGi0","744260","758260"," They're like the CIA I'm telling you banks are like the fucking CIA the NSA like these guys have people in every fucking country so if there's going to be a war they already know it's literally going to be priced in it's the unknown shit that is not priced in."
"iCHROUyWGi0","759260","761260"," Anyways you know we'll do."
"iCHROUyWGi0","762260","776260"," I already posted the chart on fence wood of what my expectations are for the year we're going to go back at the end of the year and look at that versus what the actual market did."
"iCHROUyWGi0","777260","785260"," And we'll see how far off I am I'm going to guarantee that I'm not going to get really a 30% chance that I'm pretty fucking close to what the expectations are for this year."
"iCHROUyWGi0","786260","790260"," Unless those two things happen unless you start seeing fucking Jerome cotton."
"iCHROUyWGi0","792260","796260"," That fucking guy cuts though that shit's off the table sell everything sell it all."
"iCHROUyWGi0","797260","798260"," I got to go."
