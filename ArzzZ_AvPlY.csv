"1610","2850"," Check 1-2."
"4390","5390"," Are we even there?"
"7090","10090"," We're going to find out if this holds or not."
"14030","15090"," Turn that off. "
"17150","17830"," Get this started."
"20390","21690"," Check 1-2."
"32910","34050"," Financial sludge. "
"37490","44560"," We're going to speed up the control."
"45700","47460"," It's not trapping any of the background."
"51200","52220"," Yes, yeah. "
"53240","59320"," We're going to reach one of the source of its size."
"61540","62700"," Let's take this thing."
"73020","73780"," All right. "
"74640","75960"," We got a note."
"82000","82960"," All right."
"83720","84200"," Save. "
"87240","90600"," We also got going on here."
"90900","91300"," Good morning."
"91300","92440"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"92560","93380"," We're going to get right into it. "
"97160","98460"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"100760","106160"," Good opening this morning and then immediately sells off on the bell."
"107440","109460"," Yesterday I talked to you about..."
"110420","111700"," Good morning, all of you."
"111820","113900"," Who else are going to get some weirdness going on here?"
"115880","117640"," Close or make that smaller. "
"118180","119700"," Put that right there."
"123400","126660"," Let's talk about a few things that are..."
"127699","131960"," I actually stopped what I was doing because I'm like, yeah, we need to probably talk about this."
"132340","134820"," So we're going to talk about it. "
"137920","142460"," We're going to talk about this because some of you have the tool."
"142940","150920"," If you have the tool you're probably thinking to yourself, this should hold."
"153760","156680"," Yesterday in the stream, let me come a second. "
"156680","158260"," I've got a couple of things I've got to do here."
"161180","162320"," I'm getting ahead of myself."
"164820","165420"," Good morning. "
"165580","166320"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"166380","167000"," Good to see you all."
"167220","171300"," This is an important part of the tool and usage of it."
"172160","173860"," We're going to chat about it right now. "
"177800","180440"," I get caught in this myself sometimes."
"184500","186100"," There's a couple of lessons here."
"186420","188540"," We're going to talk about those right now too. "
"188940","190160"," We'll go in a quick second."
"197100","200860"," I guess what you want to take away from it would be..."
"203320","208620"," In yesterday's video I said to you, there's not much to do here."
"209900","211900"," I think I said something like this. "
"212160","216440"," I think I posted this on Twitter yesterday where I said, there's not much to do here."
"217520","220200"," You should sit on your hands and be patient."
"223000","232360"," Now we had good news or market reacted positively to the economic news that came out this morning. "
"234220","235580"," Even with that."
"237400","239140"," Members only save that."
"239460","245680"," I got to head over and make sure that I do the members only for Twitch as well. "
"250090","251150"," I see what I got here."
"251390","251990"," Chat settings."
"253430","256529"," I got some weirdness going on with chat this morning. "
"261900","264420"," Some weird stuff going on with Twitch this morning."
"266080","267220"," Filled to load."
"267820","268640"," Just this morning. "
"270260","271460"," Filled to load."
"272280","272840"," Just this morning."
"273920","274860"," I'm going to turn that off. "
"277320","277960"," Okay."
"278840","278980"," So."
"283670","285030"," Subscribers only chat. "
"285410","285410"," Boom."
"285830","286110"," That's done."
"286590","286750"," Okay. "
"287970","288610"," So."
"289950","290910"," We got to talk about."
"292510","295830"," I'm going to stretch my neck out. "
"296310","296710"," Okay."
"297010","297130"," So."
"298510","303910"," I'm doing all this like flip off stuff with my youngest or my youngest daughter and I'm not failing"
"303910","304110"," it. "
"305630","306510"," Turn me."
"307590","308190"," So."
"309210","311770"," Yesterday I said have some patience. "
"312550","313150"," Sit back."
"313850","315410"," There's no trade for you."
"317330","320950"," Now some of you today would say, well, I could have traded that. "
"322390","323270"," Economic news."
"324450","327630"," And in 2020 hindsight, I would have sold the open in the bell."
"328330","330350"," And now that's one reason I sell the open. "
"330570","333490"," Not one, but I do sell the open on zero dates overnight."
"333630","335750"," So if any of you did that and made some money, congratulations."
"337470","341210"," Only if they're burning and only if my calls or puts are burning. "
"341730","344470"," In the overnight will I hold them past the opening bell."
"344790","347070"," So I guess if you did that, congratulations."
"349050","350590"," Now saying that. "
"351350","353290"," It's kind of a classic setup here."
"353830","356070"," You look at the bottom of your chart."
"357570","359170"," This is a classic bull trap. "
"361550","363770"," And how you can look for them."
"367280","368920"," Is the failure to launch."
"368980","370840"," So you'll get that pull back here. "
"373160","377720"," You'll get some kind of a new high right here, but a failure."
"379780","382500"," So you get this new high right here."
"384280","387500"," So the idea here would be what that would be that. "
"387580","389040"," Let me go to the weevil chart and full screen."
"390040","393080"," The idea here would be that you would go all the way up here, right?"
"394260","395520"," And this is an important delineation."
"396640","398340"," You see this one right here. "
"401420","404000"," You should have seen price go straight up."
"405480","409120"," Catch close to a new high or even a new high."
"409920","411600"," And then if you had your pull back. "
"412820","414360"," You'd be off and running like right there."
"414580","418860"," But this is something that I want you to see when you do not see."
"421840","423940"," Buyers following through right here. "
"426440","427480"," Have caution."
"429020","430740"," See the failure to launch right here."
"431360","433680"," We have another failure to launch right here. "
"435200","439020"," And the idea here would be that we'd at least come back and pull back."
"440340","441760"," And according to the alert."
"443260","446600"," The city and nearby towns. "
"448620","450580"," Oh, that's really fucking loud."
"452420","453660"," Bring that shit down."
"454500","458000"," So you've got this going on here, right?"
"458340","460220"," But there's some other stuff going on as well. "
"460740","462840"," If you look at the trigger screen."
"464020","469420"," We still have no cross of the hourly trigger over the daily trigger."
"471280","474160"," And so that's some cause for concern. "
"474840","475920"," No cross yet."
"478280","482680"," On SPX of the hourly trigger over the daily trigger."
"482960","483520"," So much. "
"485260","485280"," Dude."
"488420","490400"," What is going on with this."
"492360","493460"," Financial juice today. "
"493480","494720"," You might have to go out the door, dude."
"495680","498400"," You are so fucking loud today."
"501960","508680"," So watching this green line cross this orange line, but not having not cross this yellow line yet. "
"510800","512039"," We're kind of weak here."
"512179","515400"," There's a half hour trigger that could help hold SPX."
"516659","518919"," But it would not shock me to see us come back down here. "
"520620","524780"," And bounce check this weekly trigger on SPX."
"526340","527800"," So that's cause for concern."
"528500","529960"," Now if we look at ES. "
"538060","543560"," Price is parked on the daily trigger right now and it's below the hourly trigger."
"544000","546540"," So this is cause for concern as well, right?"
"546660","547540"," I don't like seeing that."
"550000","551300"," And then on spy. "
"558340","559880"," We have the cross."
"560800","562180"," Happening right now."
"563320","566240"," On SPX specifically, but we're still not there. "
"566780","568920"," And technically we have not checked."
"570600","572940"," Back checked the daily trigger."
"573600","576340"," We have not back tested the daily trigger. "
"576540","579900"," We have not back tested the hourly trigger cross that's happening right here."
"582940","585740"," So kind of a mixed bag right now."
"586720","588500"," It makes me weary. "
"588500","594240"," I always like them all to cross at same time."
"594560","603420"," Another thing to think about here too is the triggers to me and velocity do not work nearly as well"
"603420","606620"," as they do on single tickers."
"607920","615860"," They don't work daily as well on indexes as they do on single tickers because I have to look at"
"615860","616440"," all three. "
"616440","626300"," I have to check ES SPX and spy and find out if they're kind of jamming at the same time,"
"626480","626520"," right?"
"626720","629960"," We have the SPX and spy kind of jam at the same time to have ES."
"631540","636940"," And I do trade, I'll trade ES outside of normal market hours, but in regular market hours, I always"
"636940","643640"," check SPX and spy against these triggers to see."
"647300","648540"," What's going on in the background?"
"648860","657700"," So for right now, I have some concerns with no cross on the hourly trigger. "
"658100","663000"," And this is the ES chart right here, this book map chart is the ES chart."
"663240","666200"," So we have not had a cross yet on SPX, that's a concern."
"669760","675260"," And we have not had a cross of the HT above the daily trigger on SPX yet. "
"676980","680320"," So I have a feeling here that SPX is going to cross below."
"681320","682780"," So here's spoos right now."
"687990","697770"," 429.46. So it not shocked me to see some kind of breakdown here"
"697770","702920"," and that swooped down and up. "
"703460","710240"," I think I charted this for you yesterday and showed you to expect that weakness and then a dip buy"
"710240","712380"," of some kind down here for you as a bull."
"712740","716200"," So that's what I'm looking for."
"716460","719960"," Now, so I'm looking to buy that kind of a dip down here. "
"721700","728580"," Now if we bounce here, if we end up bouncing on this daily and hourly trigger and this hourly comes"
"728580","735040"," back up if we're on SPX, if the hourly just keeps swooping up and we just park it here, start"
"735040","736520"," grinding, grinding, grinding."
"737420","742380"," And then the SPX hourly trigger comes up and blouse you blast off."
"742820","743840"," And I'm fine with that too. "
"746360","747880"," That's how it unfolds, that's how it unfolds."
"750820","755620"," So for right now, no dip buy, I would be very wary of buying this dip down here or attempting"
"755620","756220"," to buy this."
"759580","768920"," Unless you see the corresponding price action, so on the top right hand side here, you'd be looking"
"768920","771980"," for bring this over. "
"778180","785120"," You'd be looking for, let me say I'd make this exact for you to take a dip buy, be looking"
"785120","787520"," for the blood bounce right here."
"801250","803330"," And you're looking for this kind of a turnaround here."
"806580","809500"," So you'd wait for this, this, this, this blood bath down here, right?"
"809600","811160"," You're like, whoop, we go way down, right?"
"811280","814160"," We bounce back up, still not in calls. "
"815760","818900"," Come back down, retest that one and five crossover to the upside."
"820400","822440"," You know about this here being your support."
"823220","825380"," And then you could take this trade long right here. "
"825520","831220"," So until that happens, so you see that cross like that, that, that hold and then the bounce up."
"831980","834340"," And then the crossover, you still don't have a trade here."
"834540","840480"," So let's look at it on weebull down here. "
"840660","849600"," So you're in a weebull chart at home, you'd be looking for something like this."
"852080","854820"," You want to see that bounce right here, right?"
"855140","856400"," You'd want to see price come up."
"860110","862910"," You know, some of you are all like fuck that cap buying all this. "
"864030","865910"," This price should come right about there."
"871380","873020"," But that's what you'd want to see, right?"
"873760","876620"," This bounce back down and then this roll right here."
"885940","888620"," And this is where we pick the trade up right in here somewhere. "
"890780","892980"," To make sense, so this is what you're looking for right now."
"894440","899320"," If you don't see this start beginning to happen or start to happen or this bounce come off, I guess"
"899320","900400"," some of you want to trade this."
"900560","902780"," I know some of you are going to be like, tell you I cap. "
"903020","904100"," There's a bunch of money in there to grab."
"904780","906000"," So this is what you want to do."
"906140","907220"," You're more than welcome to do it. "
"907340","913940"," What I'm looking for is this bounce come up and then resumption of price and I'll take that trade"
"913940","914520"," right there."
"917380","918080"," That's for me."
"919320","921100"," Now for you, you might be buying this. "
"921280","923260"," I know that some of you out there are going to want to buy this."
"923960","926380"," Matter of fact, this hourly trigger is above right now."
"926420","926840"," It's up here. "
"929420","930920"," We have the cross on spy."
"930920","941160"," And you see"
"941160","943280"," that nice big squeezing bar right there."
"944900","946500"," You can put it on a one minute here. "
"955500","957360"," Let's look at SPX really quick."
"957680","958700"," Let's go back to SPX."
"958880","960020"," I know you're all bullish. "
"965560","971940"," SPX parking itself right now on the daily trigger just bouncing around just waiting for this half"
"971940","972880"," hour trigger to come up."
"974320","976520"," Waiting for this hourly trigger to come up."
"981700","983280"," There's still no trade for me. "
"1003640","1009200"," No, I've got some allergies from the fall."
"1009840","1011360"," My nose is all stuffed up."
"1012820","1013980"," I don't know if you can hear it. "
"1014260","1020180"," I've got the helium voice because of my allergies, but that's it."
"1020880","1021880"," Thanks for asking, by the way."
"1028859","1030119"," These aren't allergies. "
"1036180","1037339"," There's something wrong with the."
"1037560","1038180"," Okay, hold on."
"1038260","1040480"," Let me take a look at my hang tight. "
"1040680","1041140"," I'll bring a."
"1043079","1044020"," Let me check my."
"1050240","1051120"," Check one, two."
"1051300","1051940"," How does that sound?"
"1052620","1053580"," Does that sound better?"
"1058140","1059480"," The audio is on Martian. "
"1060100","1061320"," I sound like a chipmunk."
"1065040","1067260"," So Twitch this morning was acting really weird."
"1067260","1072740"," It had like all kinds of weird, like non responses, which wasn't working when I tried to log in"
"1072740","1073100"," this morning. "
"1073800","1075200"," Now I was having issues yesterday, too."
"1075300","1075520"," It's even."
"1077780","1079140"," Am I still a chipmunk?"
"1079520","1080000"," Goddamn it. "
"1081360","1081880"," All right."
"1082000","1085040"," Let me turn it off and turn about me."
"1085580","1087880"," I'm going to turn the stream off and come right back here in just a second. "
"1088000","1090880"," So hold on."
"1090880","1093840"," It'll be like 30 seconds and I'll turn the stream back on again."
"1094620","1095840"," I'm going to turn it turned out. "
"1096180","1098260"," I'm having weird like past two days."
"1098260","1099020"," I've had trouble streaming."
"1099340","1103020"," So give me a second here and I'll all reset it all. "
"1109840","1114940"," So Nerd RX is saying refresh Twitch and it works at 12 p.m. Eastern time."
"1115100","1116620"," Twitch was getting me issues before."
"1117220","1120480"," I don't have to. "
"1120620","1121080"," You have to."
"1122240","1122640"," Okay."
"1122740","1123300"," Okay, I'll leave it on. "
"1124200","1128840"," So if you're watching on Twitch, please refresh Twitch this morning when I tried to."
"1130280","1135980"," Get online Twitch was giving me major issues like the back end of Twitch."
"1136600","1139420"," Was giving me some some major issues this morning. "
"1139940","1140840"," So maybe Twitch is."
"1141880","1144080"," Updating or down or semi down."
"1144100","1145140"," You just don't notice them. "
"1146920","1148700"," I just changed my."
"1148700","1155360"," I just changed my voice on my voice mixer too."
"1156480","1159480"," Let me change it back and see if this if this makes a difference. "
"1162980","1164260"," Try this one right here."
"1165560","1167900"," Check one to check one to Mike."
"1169900","1170720"," Talking sweet. "
"1171440","1171940"," Nothing's."
"1175350","1176510"," Yes, set that default."
"1183050","1183890"," Oh, yeah. "
"1185430","1186770"," Do you guys want the sweet."
"1188130","1191490"," Soft sounds of Captain Jim James in the morning."
"1193730","1195590"," Smooth and silky. "
"1197550","1199130"," Attaching that bounce though down here."
"1199270","1199730"," Look at that bounce."
"1199870","1200730"," Are you guys buying this?"
"1200890","1201930"," I guess that's the next big question. "
"1202170","1203170"," You're going to buy this dip here."
"1203990","1205530"," I can't blame you if you do."
"1206870","1209230"," I can't blame you if you buy this dip down here. "
"1209610","1210070"," I would."
"1212730","1215910"," The one thing that I would say to you would be if you buy this dip down here."
"1220080","1221520"," Your stops are down here. "
"1223280","1226380"," That would be one thing to take away, I guess."
"1227460","1228820"," You're going to buy this dip right here."
"1229960","1232680"," That you just have stops below the hourly trigger down here. "
"1232860","1235400"," So can't say don't buy a dip here."
"1237180","1239300"," It's not a bad idea to buy a dip down here."
"1242650","1244470"," It's not a nice little nice little. "
"1244630","1246190"," Nice little bull playing down here."
"1246290","1248090"," I can't blame you for wanting to buy that."
"1248650","1250510"," Pretty much a classic setup, right?"
"1251470","1253210"," Hourly trigger crossing the daily trigger. "
"1253210","1255850"," Buy this thing for a face ripper up here."
"1256470","1257910"," Pull back over here."
"1258790","1260130"," There's a cross right there. "
"1260490","1261170"," You're off and running."
"1263010","1264050"," I can't say."
"1264570","1266630"," Let me take a look and see if we can take this trade hold on. "
"1267290","1268410"," I might be missing it."
"1268450","1269090"," Hold on a second here."
"1275140","1276620"," It's not waiting for me though. "
"1294420","1296520"," We're going to try to take this trade."
"1296800","1297340"," So hold on here."
"1300480","1302160"," What I'm looking for is. "
"1304140","1305260"," Initial squeeze up."
"1307580","1311260"," Come back down, test this cross right here."
"1314620","1316120"," Get that one right there. "
"1332900","1335260"," Something like that right there."
"1352980","1357180"," Every reversal taking place right now on spy with the one in five minute triggers."
"1364150","1365210"," Somewhere in there. "
"1373130","1375590"," I'm long four thirty six C."
"1381070","1382550"," There might be more pullbacks."
"1382710","1386790"," If you watch the lower screen, you could see like tick tick tick."
"1388250","1389530"," Then that right there. "
"1396320","1397920"," We'll see if this holds here."
"1412710","1416830"," At 12 p.m. Can I hear the recent new I.H.D. report?"
"1417670","1419810"," Why is this so fucking loud?"
"1420910","1422410"," It's got to be in my end."
"1422410","1424130"," It's got to be loud in my end. "
"1426150","1427110"," Turn that thing down."
"1429090","1432830"," Which recent news about Israel are you asking about?"
"1434170","1436670"," Which recent news are you asking about in Israel?"
"1442820","1447000"," Paragliders and or drones entering northern Israel from Lebanon."
"1447640","1448840"," Yeah, I thought I read that news. "
"1449220","1449980"," Is it something different?"
"1450280","1451220"," I thought that was the norm."
"1453880","1455020"," Let me check right now."
"1455160","1455520"," Hold on a second. "
"1455600","1456200"," I'll check right now."
"1456920","1458740"," We have to talk about that this morning too."
"1458880","1463900"," We're going to chat about in in trades just asked about. "
"1466340","1468340"," In trades just asked about."
"1471860","1474040"," New news about."
"1477900","1481720"," Paragliders, drones entering from northern Israel into Lebanon. "
"1483000","1484660"," So I have not seen that news."
"1484900","1485820"," I'll look for it right now."
"1485900","1486680"," Give me a quick second. "
"1489460","1490820"," We need to talk about."
"1492300","1494200"," Israel, Lebanon, Hamas."
"1497840","1500620"," So when I was in the says a couple of things you need to know. "
"1500920","1502180"," So I was in the military, right?"
"1506000","1507460"," I'm getting trapped in here right now."
"1507500","1508780"," Someone have to watch this while I chat."
"1510520","1513260"," If we come back up here, we're going to get a reversal to the downside. "
"1513720","1515160"," So I'm going to have to get out of this in just a moment."
"1515900","1516260"," So."
"1521180","1522520"," I don't know. "
"1522580","1523060"," I was in the army."
"1525600","1528340"," I was in during 9 11."
"1528340","1529040"," And. "
"1535130","1538490"," I was in what's what was called an AGR soldier."
"1538810","1543030"," So I was a active duty guard reserve soldier at that time."
"1544590","1546410"," When it happened and. "
"1547310","1548790"," The morning of 9 11."
"1551650","1553250"," I slept in."
"1553810","1554530"," That was that. "
"1554670","1558550"," You know what James Roland yesterday reminded me a lot of my experience during 9 11."
"1559270","1561510"," So I was stationed at just outside of an airport."
"1562450","1566130"," The morning of 9 11 and that morning I slept in. "
"1566830","1570610"," And I had a digital alarm clock with an alarm on it."
"1571770","1573390"," So I was sleeping in that morning."
"1573670","1576330"," I didn't really have to be at work in the army. "
"1577910","1580930"," At that time of the morning, but my alarm goes off early."
"1581590","1582310"," I was living on the beach."
"1583410","1586370"," My alarm goes off and I could hear. "
"1588190","1590830"," The news reports of the initial."
"1592210","1595510"," What they thought at that time or excuse me at that time."
"1595510","1598850"," They just knew that something had crashed into the into one of the world trade centers. "
"1599570","1601390"," The first plane had hit."
"1602410","1605630"," The news reports were on the radio."
"1606530","1608250"," I think it was just the first one. "
"1608310","1611170"," It could have been the second one that actually woke me up."
"1612430","1617030"," It's like the alarm had gone off with some reports going on the radio the radio alarm clock."
"1617950","1619630"," By the time the second one it hit. "
"1620390","1623350"," That's when the news radio started to go crazy."
"1624810","1627170"," And I got a phone call."
"1632240","1635920"," I'm like lying down with my now wife believe it or not. "
"1636300","1641660"," My wife right now I just started dating her and she was with me."
"1642380","1647680"," So the alarm the alarm radio alarm clock started saying that shit."
"1648860","1652540"," At some point and the moment that second plane hit. "
"1652680","1653380"," One minute remaining."
"1655160","1659560"," That is still loud as fuck moment that second plane hit."
"1659660","1660540"," I knew something was up. "
"1661880","1662520"," So."
"1664840","1670380"," I remember calling in my either my either either they called me or I called them."
"1671660","1673000"," But I remember the conversation was. "
"1675440","1676780"," The conversation was."
"1678540","1680040"," Get here as fast as you can."
"1682100","1683920"," Get here as fast as you can. "
"1685720","1687760"," The conversation was dangerous to it was."
"1688880","1691860"," I remember my CEO was friends with him."
"1692020","1692920"," So I was a gr so. "
"1694080","1695300"," When you're a gr."
"1696100","1700080"," You're kind of more friendly with NCO's and officers and."
"1701240","1704020"," Then you more friendly than you normally might be. "
"1704880","1708240"," Because we see each other every day small group of people."
"1708740","1713400"," And then you've got a reservist that come in once a month few weeks a year."
"1714020","1717220"," So you're very small close and a knit group of people. "
"1717580","1723220"," And you remember I'm they reserves as an a gr as a as an active duty guard reservist."
"1723220","1723660"," So."
"1725540","1728700"," I kind of have some insight on this stuff. "
"1728700","1729400"," So."
"1730040","1731780"," Anyways, the point I'm trying to make here is."
"1732100","1733320"," Well, I'm going to get I'm going to get caught in this. "
"1734160","1734580"," So."
"1735600","1736940"," I'm trying to make in this is that."
"1739380","1741860"," That morning I get told come in right now. "
"1741980","1745080"," Get your get your ass here right now to the to the battery."
"1745200","1745420"," So."
"1746480","1747880"," I get dressed in. "
"1748780","1749780"," My B to use."
"1750240","1751320"," I get inside my vehicle."
"1752240","1756380"," I start to head back to this battery that's outside of an airport. "
"1756380","1759940"," And I don't I'll never forget it."
"1760660","1764760"," Because up until that point, nobody gave a fuck if you were a veteran."
"1764760","1766220"," Nobody gave a fuck if you serve. "
"1766440","1767140"," Nobody gave a fuck."
"1767340","1767780"," You've been deployed."
"1768300","1769040"," Let me care about anything. "
"1770020","1771980"," No one paid you a moment a minute."
"1772100","1774120"," There was no Walmart warriors out there."
"1774400","1777740"," There was no like extreme patriotism in the United States. "
"1778060","1778980"," There was none of that stuff."
"1779700","1780140"," Zero."
"1780500","1781600"," Like literally zero. "
"1782180","1784060"," So that morning I'm heading."
"1784620","1786240"," Well, first off, I'm on the phone."
"1787100","1789320"," My commander, my commanding officer, my CEO said to me. "
"1790360","1791540"," I was like, what's going on?"
"1791620","1792540"," And he's like, we don't know."
"1793460","1799160"," They thought that it was a he did tell me over the phone that he thought that the 911 attacks"
"1799160","1799480"," were."
"1800340","1800740"," Probably. "
"1803520","1803920"," Fuck."
"1804700","1805260"," Hold on a second."
"1805340","1806040"," I'm going to sell out of this. "
"1817470","1819130"," He's goddamn bears, dude."
"1821410","1822270"," One second here."
"1826490","1827530"," All right. "
"1827530","1828310"," I feel safer now."
"1828890","1829950"," I've got a bunch of puts now."
"1830610","1831130"," Yeah. "
"1831290","1832090"," Port 32s."
"1832610","1832770"," So."
"1834170","1835210"," You're watching. "
"1835370","1836930"," You're watching a rug pull right now."
"1836950","1837470"," So."
"1839270","1841530"," Nice big fat rug pull coming up. "
"1846010","1847670"," So I'm sitting in."
"1848290","1851050"," Or I'm talking on the phone with my CEO."
"1851470","1852170"," And they thought. "
"1852170","1853730"," It wasn't a Trojan horse."
"1853730","1854750"," They thought it was."
"1855330","1856810"," A false flag. "
"1858630","1860390"," And he was like."
"1860910","1863070"," He was like thinking maybe a false flag where."
"1863470","1867410"," You got terrorists that strike the towers during 9 11. "
"1869090","1873630"," And we would be postured for more terrorist attacks."
"1874370","1877550"," But in reality, it was probably Russia or China."
"1878510","1880390"," And that we could see. "
"1881810","1885050"," More attacks in the form of cruise missiles."
"1886670","1891510"," I remember calling my mom and dad on the phone on the way to this battery."
"1892050","1894530"," And telling my parents that morning. "
"1895210","1896450"," You're not seeing this on the news."
"1897890","1901170"," I want you to go down to the basement for the rest of today."
"1905170","1907550"," People that I knew in the military were afraid that. "
"1908970","1913150"," We'll be focused on terrorists and cruise missiles are committed start to hit."
"1915050","1917730"," Large soft targets were crossed the United States."
"1918590","1919510"," So that's true story. "
"1919650","1920990"," I told my parents that morning."
"1921850","1922930"," Said goodbye to them."
"1923090","1923610"," Believe it or not. "
"1925090","1926730"," And was very afraid."
"1927410","1929330"," I was very afraid mostly because."
"1929330","1932650"," There's nothing you can do in those situations. "
"1933350","1935810"," There's there if cruise missiles come for you."
"1936390","1938130"," You're not going to be able to do anything."
"1938570","1940350"," You've got no way to defend yourself. "
"1940850","1942250"," There's nothing that you can do."
"1944470","1947530"," There's nothing here that you can do in those situations."
"1948590","1953270"," You just wait for them and hope they don't come right and prepare as best you can for them. "
"1953650","1954670"," So I drive in."
"1954830","1956110"," I stop at a gas station."
"1957390","1960210"," To get gas and cigarettes. "
"1960690","1962310"," I was smoking at that point in my life."
"1965270","1968450"," So I go in to grab cigarettes and in some gas."
"1969570","1970550"," I open the door. "
"1972110","1972990"," I grab the coffee."
"1973930","1978050"," I ordered a pack of just cigarettes and ordered I think 20 bucks for gas or something."
"1979110","1981830"," The shocking thing was someone opened the door for me. "
"1982370","1986970"," There was a crowd of people inside this gas station convenience store."
"1988170","1989430"," They opened the door for me."
"1989570","1991190"," As I went to pay for my shit. "
"1991950","1993790"," An old band paid for it for me."
"1998990","2000410"," And that's when I got really scared."
"2001070","2002610"," That's when I was like oh shit. "
"2003570","2008350"," Some old guys are like some old woman opened the door for me and then some old guy paid for"
"2008350","2008710"," my shit."
"2008950","2011290"," And I'd never had anything like that happen to me in my life."
"2012210","2014390"," And I'd been in the army for years at that point. "
"2014390","2015850"," We asked always in and out of the army."
"2016110","2016450"," Over heaven."
"2016690","2017970"," In our local port. "
"2017970","2019050"," Back in the evening time."
"2019270","2022710"," And now 10 minutes away to expect comments from the feds at Bostik as well."
"2023570","2028710"," So Atlanta Fed President Bostik speaks about the economic conditions at the Metro Atlanta chambers. "
"2029030","2029950"," ATL leaders lunch."
"2030670","2031510"," And no text is expected."
"2031890","2033530"," There will be a Q and A with the audience. "
"2033890","2034950"," So again, feds Bostik."
"2035230","2037050"," To speak in just under 10 minutes time now."
"2037370","2037910"," No text expected. "
"2039570","2041130"," So I'm in some puts right now."
"2041130","2042930"," I'm going to make money back that I lost on my calls."
"2044570","2046290"," I'm only up two pennies right now. "
"2046610","2049810"," So the point here is that."
"2051310","2055030"," This dream is sponsored by that like triggered the second layer of scared."
"2055429","2056630"," I was like oh fuck. "
"2056830","2060770"," I was like all these old people think that some bad is going to come from this right."
"2061449","2062929"," So I'm scared right now."
"2063370","2066130"," And we're going down right now to test the hourly trigger. "
"2067889","2070110"," And the daily trigger here in just a moment."
"2070370","2072510"," Probably bring those down just a little tiny bit."
"2075670","2077330"," And they paid for my shit. "
"2077510","2079270"," So I go outside and get inside my car."
"2079530","2081510"," I drive into the battery."
"2082650","2086250"," And as I pull up some other soldiers are pulling in. "
"2087230","2088510"," And I get inside."
"2090290","2093130"," And they're like Sergeant James get your."
"2094550","2099730"," Get some that's funny too because they issued me some old school TA 50 crap. "
"2100050","2101170"," Like some."
"2101910","2104290"," Alice strap Vietnam era stuff."
"2104910","2107470"," They gave me a radio from Vietnam. "
"2108050","2111050"," Like a giant fucking radio from Vietnam."
"2111390","2111970"," You're not."
"2112510","2115470"," These things carry like old school battery packs. "
"2115770","2116650"," It was really wild."
"2117490","2120850"," They issued me loaded weapons."
"2120850","2124050"," Side arm and a M4 right. "
"2124370","2124770"," So."
"2128180","2133440"," And then they had me ground up a squad of soldiers that were there whoever was available."
"2134120","2137440"," And we started driving doos and a half. "
"2139220","2144200"," And parking them at all the entrances to well the entrance to our battery."
"2144580","2147200"," And then entrances around the airport outside."
"2147200","2150720"," And we started to park these doos and a half. "
"2152260","2156560"," And I forget what it's called anymore, but it was stacked like one on top of the other."
"2157120","2158380"," It's a barricade."
"2158740","2160940"," So you're a checkpoint turned into a checkpoint. "
"2161780","2165760"," And a barricade that you have to drive through weave in and out of this barricade."
"2166100","2172460"," And then I assigned some soldiers to the front of this barricade the back of this barricade."
"2172460","2178360"," And then some military police showed up at some point and they brought stuff to search vehicles. "
"2180460","2181880"," Mirrors and stuff like that."
"2182620","2184640"," And the U.S. got really quiet."
"2185180","2188280"," That was my initial experience with 9-11. "
"2190500","2192880"," That was the initial experience."
"2193340","2194120"," Now as the day progressed."
"2195280","2198240"," A bunch of old sergeant majors came into this battery. "
"2199180","2199940"," A bunch of old timers."
"2199940","2202980"," Some of these guys I think were Vietnam veterans still."
"2203420","2203940"," Maybe. "
"2204600","2206200"," Maybe we're still Vietnam veterans."
"2206420","2208920"," I can't remember at that time if there's still some in."
"2209540","2210680"," I don't think so. "
"2211040","2214600"," Because my first time in the Army we still had a Vietnam veteran."
"2215020","2215780"," Believe it or not."
"2215960","2222780"," We still had a I was in a field artillery when I was younger. "
"2223580","2225440"," And we still had some Vietnam veterans at that time."
"2225440","2225820"," I can't remember."
"2225940","2227480"," But these guys are like old master sergeant. "
"2227740","2230160"," They had like fucking bars up the side of their sleeves."
"2230460","2233040"," And they had been in for like 30 fucking years in the Army."
"2233160","2233740"," Straight up. "
"2233920","2234920"," Like 30 years in the Army."
"2235060","2236340"," So maybe that wasn't Vietnam."
"2236480","2238480"," But these guys were in there for fucking ever. "
"2238680","2240880"," But they rolled in like it was nobody's fucking business."
"2241420","2242860"," And they're like you want to go to New York with us."
"2242860","2244020"," And I'm like you goddamn right. "
"2244160","2244540"," I do right."
"2244880","2247600"," I'm not religious or anything but so it's like a GAWT."
"2247700","2248660"," But I was like goddamn right. "
"2248780","2249700"," I want to fucking kill people."
"2249940","2250460"," Like let's do this."
"2250960","2252960"," So we fucking rolled into New York City. "
"2254580","2256820"," Within 12 hours or so."
"2257280","2258940"," I was out of there in New York City."
"2259620","2266480"," But the key point behind this conversation I'm having with you is took time to recall people. "
"2267180","2268500"," And recalls happen."
"2269180","2272780"," My aunt was an Apache helicopter pilot."
"2273460","2274740"," Many years before. "
"2275240","2277180"," She was in her 40s I think at that time."
"2278020","2278640"," Mid 40s."
"2278900","2279560"," They called her back. "
"2279920","2281860"," They called anyone back into the Army."
"2282900","2287240"," That had any kind of experience."
"2290380","2294120"," Doing like things that take time to learn right. "
"2294320","2299820"," So if you had an MOS that might take you months and months and months if not years to learn."
"2300340","2301220"," You got to call back."
"2301280","2303320"," You got called back into the Army at that time. "
"2304400","2309300"," And what I want to express to you here is what I'm trying to lead up to here is god"
"2309300","2310160"," damn it dude."
"2311720","2313080"," Not paying attention here."
"2313080","2317160"," The release of the EIA is a short term energy outlook report. "
"2317760","2319640"," But just now five minutes away from."
"2319920","2322060"," Maybe I'm going to stop trading here for a minute."
"2322060","2327140"," Speaking about economic conditions at the metro Atlanta chambers 80 liters lunch. "
"2327500","2328600"," The note X is expected."
"2329040","2330700"," But there will be a Q and A with the audience."
"2331300","2331620"," So. "
"2332780","2333360"," As a."
"2335080","2337360"," The point here is that as you mobilize."
"2338660","2344300"," Right you have different kinds of soldiers this airman soldiers Navy doesn't matter."
"2345420","2349580"," And I was talking to someone on Monday I believe Binky about. "
"2350660","2351780"," Did the."
"2354660","2357240"," Or why was there such an intelligence failure?"
"2357520","2359940"," Why was there such a failure along the."
"2362340","2365120"," Border between Gaza and Israel. "
"2365840","2366400"," And."
"2368340","2369980"," There's a when you build a border."
"2369980","2371820"," There's a couple different ways to build them. "
"2371920","2376600"," One of the big ways to build them is your experience with the Berlin wall or the."
"2377740","2379400"," DMZ in North and South Korea."
"2381080","2384680"," We have heavy defenses you have they're heavily manned. "
"2385820","2389820"," You mind the fuck out of everything you destroy all the foliage."
"2390460","2393840"," You literally bulldoze out in the case of Korea."
"2394660","2395780"," For fields of fire. "
"2396900","2404020"," You it's really wild and the same thing with Berlin wall you heavily fortify you man those."
"2406400","2408180"," That border heavily."
"2408620","2412940"," And you have killed points with checkpoints for people to come through and. "
"2413580","2418520"," This border with Gaza was not built like that this but that border in Gaza reminded me a lot of"
"2418520","2418760"," Iraq."
"2419600","2425060"," It was like it reminded me so much of Iraq it reminded me of like all that coin shit like."
"2425420","2430300"," Instead of having a divisional divisional leadership telling you what you can and can't do and"
"2430300","2431060"," divisional. "
"2431420","2434880"," Logistics you have brigade or battalion level."
"2435600","2438420"," Ability to fast react to."
"2439560","2441220"," Insurgencies and stuff like that. "
"2441740","2444200"," So the border between Gaza and."
"2444700","2446060"," And the rest of Israel."
"2447240","2449520"," To me reminded me of Iraq you've got. "
"2450080","2452700"," A simple barrier."
"2453380","2455780"," A barbed wire fencing wooden posts."
"2456580","2459180"," You funnel people down a road. "
"2459460","2461220"," From Gaza and Israel."
"2461840","2464320"," If you're funneling people between the."
"2464600","2465860"," Between the. "
"2467700","2469440"," Entrances and exits into."
"2470020","2474740"," Israel and Gaza and you have a lot there's always buffer land right."
"2474740","2478400"," You set up checkpoints LPs OPs. "
"2479640","2485500"," And then way back behind all that shit you've got a base of some kind."
"2486020","2487600"," Some kind of F O with maybe."
"2488400","2494120"," You know like the garrison of a battalion or two one battalion cycling in one battalion cycling"
"2494120","2494420"," out. "
"2495640","2499300"," And you have a fast teams that will react to."
"2500260","2503620"," Any anybody fucking around is the easy way to say it so."
"2503620","2505480"," If you get a report from. "
"2506880","2509220"," Sensors or if you get a report from."
"2509720","2512460"," A checkpoint that's being overrun or an OP."
"2512920","2513900"," That's being overrun. "
"2515320","2520360"," You can react to that from that that operating base in the background right so you can."
"2520740","2523960"," Send a battalion if you want half battalion."
"2524820","2530420"," You can send some platoons and go and like and react to these flash points right. "
"2532000","2535780"," Rather than manning the wall or mining everything."
"2536360","2540120"," It's all that looked normal to me even though people were even though people were like."
"2540800","2544180"," Claiming that was a big failure I was like that doesn't look like a failure to me. "
"2544320","2546480"," We say it worked exactly how it's supposed to work."
"2546780","2549400"," You have insurgents interest rates."
"2551360","2555480"," Interest rates are appropriate to get inflation to 2% in the second half of 2025. "
"2555480","2558020"," But the door and rate hikes can't be closed."
"2558640","2562140"," So as early entry investments in PEPP should be discussed."
"2562980","2566860"," Talks on higher mandatory reserve requirements for banks are also appropriate. "
"2567740","2567960"," And speak."
"2568520","2570140"," It's already too early in spread rise."
"2570400","2574380"," Not unwarranted and not worrisome to get into some comments from ECBs. "
"2574440","2575200"," It has acts there."
"2575780","2578880"," Keep in mind we're just under a minute's time now to expect some comments from from."
"2579060","2579300"," As well. "
"2579740","2580160"," Excuse me."
"2583940","2586680"," Now even if you even if you to make the comment well."
"2587240","2588120"," The intelligence. "
"2589780","2594320"," The intelligence didn't work or nobody knew it was going to happen."
"2594480","2595100"," All that kind of stuff."
"2595160","2595940"," It really doesn't matter. "
"2596000","2597000"," What really matters is."
"2599380","2600660"," That that they knew."
"2601320","2602060"," Same here. "
"2602300","2602920"," S one."
"2613140","2614620"," There's s one to the downside."
"2615120","2616740"," We've got the reversal to the downside. "
"2617240","2618920"," We've got the bear cross above here."
"2619580","2621960"," Testing the early to trigger in the daily trigger."
"2622140","2622980"," Target of the downside. "
"2623440","2623780"," 432."
"2627580","2628100"," So."
"2630340","2635740"," And that's similar to what we still do in this country that what what happened this past weekend in"
"2635740","2638220"," Israel and Gaza is very similar to what we do as a country. "
"2640160","2646440"," Even to this day to some extent where we're trying to shift from this into this like big war kind"
"2646440","2646680"," of a."
"2647500","2648040"," Posture but."
"2648860","2652020"," Even our even our country's defenses and I'm not 11."
"2652200","2655280"," They're very similar to we had jets that were unarmed. "
"2656140","2660460"," We've got we've got like jets flying around, but we don't have armaments."
"2660880","2665440"," You know, you're you're just waiting for something something to happen and then you call in"
"2665440","2665900"," reinforcements."
"2666500","2669760"," So watching Israel right now. "
"2671540","2673840"," They have active duty soldiers right."
"2674540","2680620"," And they're the first reaction team or teams to what took place this weekend."
"2682340","2688640"," And as you begin to mobilize your troops, it takes time to mobilize. "
"2689780","2690240"," So."
"2691580","2692520"," That mobilization."
"2693500","2694860"," It takes time. "
"2695060","2697880"," You have to you first put the call out right you call your people up."
"2698480","2703500"," Or they find out on their own they call in they get called back up or they ask for volunteers"
"2703500","2704340"," whatever that may be."
"2705400","2707800"," And those those I."
"2708300","2711580"," Those inactive ready reservists and ready reservists. "
"2712260","2719460"," Even reservists, they have to cut it like show up usually give them about 24 hours to 72 hours for"
"2719460","2720760"," that call up to take place."
"2721880","2723420"," And to begin travel."
"2723420","2728100"," So let's say you get an email or you get a phone call or something like that. "
"2729640","2732620"," You get a text message today and today's military."
"2732940","2733640"," It's usually an email."
"2734420","2735360"," You'll get orders. "
"2735940","2741280"," You have to respond to those orders and then you respond also with the travel that you're given or"
"2741280","2741780"," you're taking."
"2742700","2746120"," To get to where you need to be and you give them an ETA when you're going to arrive."
"2747040","2749480"," You show back you show up into this old under. "
"2750880","2753740"," Type of a thing right you show up to wherever you're being assigned."
"2754660","2761100"," And there's a bunch of sergeants there and they assign you to a training battalion of some kind."
"2761960","2768660"," Or some kind of a replacement battalion and if you need training you have to get that training. "
"2769420","2774120"," If you if you just IRR you haven't trained they're going to give you medical a medical evaluation."
"2774520","2778040"," There's all kinds of shit they got to do for you to get to a unit is my point."
"2779560","2784640"," Now you've got your your active duty soldiers right they're going to try to stem the tide. "
"2785080","2791240"," As you call up your forces in the reserves whatever reserved component that is."
"2791660","2793980"," And the initial reservists that come in will."
"2795800","2800740"," Replace or replenish or bring active duty. "
"2802000","2803920"," Units up to fighting strength."
"2804320","2811040"," So you might have an active duty unit that is at 70% or 50% effectiveness."
"2811380","2815060"," If they're below 70% typically they won't go to they won't fight. "
"2816100","2819340"," So you let you like bring replacements in to get them to an effective."
"2820920","2823720"," Force like 70% effectiveness or higher."
"2824420","2827300"," And then you have all these other reservists that have to. "
"2828900","2831440"," And probably have to be trained and all that kind of stuff."
"2832940","2837580"," So you have all this like all this like mechanics in the background that are working."
"2838620","2840180"," And that takes time as well. "
"2840440","2843540"," Meanwhile you and I what we're watching is we're watching bombings."
"2844680","2849340"," Of Gaza it's slow right and you're watching some news of."
"2850020","2853160"," Tip of the spare type shit you'll see like special forces. "
"2855040","2856780"," You'll see some regular army."
"2858400","2862080"," Air Force Navy whatever that is trying to stem."
"2862960","2867300"," Stem the fighting from Hamas or even Hezbollah whoever else is involved. "
"2868220","2871200"," As they begin to build up these forces in the background."
"2871840","2873800"," And get these forces ready to rock."
"2874020","2876700"," So that takes time as my point. "
"2877120","2879520"," It could take two weeks minimum."
"2880860","2883800"," To be an effective fighting force that you're looking for."
"2883860","2885700"," It could even be longer believe it or not. "
"2886760","2888440"," Then two weeks you've got a plan."
"2888440","2891660"," You've got to train you have to get all these units ready to go."
"2892700","2896760"," So if that's both now says need to do we can to get inflation to two percent. "
"2896980","2899540"," So again that's both like now speaking of that event in Atlanta."
"2902540","2907120"," So even right now and in whatever is happening in Israel and."
"2909140","2913540"," Gaza and with Iran or you know this being flown over that being flown over. "
"2913700","2914720"," I need you to know that."
"2915780","2919640"," To get their military up and ready to go usually takes some period of time."
"2919820","2920720"," You have the first. "
"2922000","2923920"," Actions that take place over a period of days."
"2924460","2928300"," You have about two weeks where you start getting your units ready to rock."
"2928300","2931900"," And then you've got another another length of time after that. "
"2932420","2935120"," Sometimes where it takes even longer to get."
"2935980","2940800"," Some of your combat and reserve units to come to the line."
"2941120","2941920"," So you're talking about. "
"2942820","2946940"," Talking about looking at all of your reserve units finding out who's that 70% readiness."
"2947480","2952200"," You immediately deploy those people to your front lines."
"2953220","2955780"," To free up your active duty soldiers to. "
"2956880","2958140"," Bring the fight to the enemy."
"2959040","2962720"," That takes what week two weeks about a week for that stuff."
"2963000","2968540"," The for the reservists that are ready to go and then another another week or two to bring the rest"
"2968540","2969660"," of those reservists online. "
"2970400","2972080"," To be effective in combat."
"2973440","2978580"," With replacements and then you got to pull back all your active duty guys and then then you plan"
"2978580","2979280"," for them to."
"2981000","2986420"," To make to make the next attack or the next wave or the next attack scenario that they're going to"
"2986420","2987100"," plan so. "
"2988140","2991620"," We this all happened last week right over the weekend."
"2992480","2998140"," This could take two three weeks at minimum for the real war to begin."
"2999420","3002280"," Now I'm bringing this up to you for a big reason here. "
"3002380","3005260"," We're going to talk about what was said."
"3006260","3009280"," I'm going to read something that was said to me or was written to me."
"3009800","3012780"," A few days here ago and I want to talk to you about it here. "
"3015260","3017240"," See I can get this bring this up for you to read."
"3030850","3035470"," Give me one quick second here."
"3046230","3049990"," So if it's possible that there are a lot of signs that the economy is starting to slow. "
"3074990","3077850"," Try to find this this article for you here."
"3089380","3090820"," So this is from a morning brief."
"3091020","3097540"," I'm reading here that says over in the US SPX futures are largely unchanged amidst rising bond"
"3097540","3097980"," yields. "
"3099220","3100140"," Three thoughts."
"3101100","3105340"," This is the thought that I want to read to you is that markets want to climb."
"3106840","3110680"," The wall of geopolitical worry per Goldman Sachs. "
"3111960","3117720"," This is from last night quote because it will take time for escalation potential to play out."
"3118640","3122940"," Stocks grinded higher and we expect this trend to continue."
"3125240","3127720"," Escalation is not a question of it but when. "
"3128660","3134300"," As mobilization in Israel is still underway and the big ground offensive into Gaza has not started"
"3134300","3134540"," yet."
"3134980","3139060"," Also has blob north is still holding still and we need to do more."
"3140060","3149160"," So the idea here would be that the markets can react to further escalation in. "
"3151440","3157220"," Israel and Gaza and this US stock market likely will."
"3158180","3165020"," Likely will react to further escalation as time passes the US stock market as of right now."
"3167370","3168630"," Leave that down here. "
"3169210","3170870"," I'm going to see if I should close these or not."
"3172270","3173730"," Now this was as of yesterday."
"3175070","3181670"," The US stock market is going to continue on its path until that escalation begins. "
"3182730","3187190"," So I don't think we've seen that escalation at this point."
"3187450","3194010"," I don't think you or I or anyone else has seen that escalation and unless you see something major"
"3194010","3194970"," come out of."
"3194970","3199870"," Has Blah or Hamas or the wet or not the West Bank but Gaza. "
"3201130","3205490"," Unless you see Iran officially get involved or something like major."
"3206210","3209570"," Some major event out of that part of the Middle East."
"3210010","3215290"," I think that hasn't come yet is my point and I don't think it's going to come for you figure"
"3215290","3217390"," this started last weekend rose past weekend. "
"3218670","3225370"," So the next two weeks it could take upwards of this upcoming weekend or even the following weekend."
"3227630","3228970"," And the."
"3229510","3237130"," The idea here would be that you would see markets hold to the upside until that happens. "
"3238870","3247050"," So I don't I don't know if the if the if those ultra lights or gliders or homemade rockets or"
"3247050","3250270"," homemade helicopters or whatever it is they're launching right now."
"3250630","3253770"," I don't know that that is going to be the catalyst that we're looking for."
"3253870","3261770"," The catalyst that we're looking for that crash scenario from what's going on in Israel. "
"3261770","3263250"," I don't think that would be it just yet."
"3263250","3268570"," So you want to see like real bad shit going on or you want to see the mobilization take a"
"3268570","3271210"," turn to where Israelis can."
"3272630","3274890"," Or is really start that that counter offensive. "
"3280930","3282230"," Here we go."
"3283110","3284790"," See this grinding right now."
"3293890","3295090"," Still inputs here. "
"3310270","3313130"," It sounds like the Warhawks want to drag Iran into this."
"3314050","3317290"," It would be like a I haven't said this publicly either."
"3317290","3320410"," So someone else was out there was asking me where my thoughts were on. "
"3321870","3324210"," What the potential there is here."
"3324970","3331770"," And my point was there is if I had to guess here in the background if I had to guess."
"3336210","3339210"," The way to the way to win this thing is. "
"3340690","3346390"," You signed the deal with Saudi Arabia wages are following inflation not leading it."
"3348210","3350290"," You signed the deal with Saudi Arabia."
"3350330","3353490"," You drag Gaza and Hamas into this. "
"3354010","3356310"," You drag Iran into this."
"3358230","3360750"," As much as you can and then you turn on them."
"3362430","3366910"," You turn on them and then you drag all of you take all of the Palestinians. "
"3367790","3372310"," That are willing to leave Gaza and you process those people."
"3373810","3376290"," Through refugee camps and."
"3378990","3380570"," You relocate them. "
"3382030","3386830"," You really relocate them in nations that could be pressured into taking them."
"3387110","3389470"," Possibly even including the West Bank."
"3391330","3394710"," And you leave behind older people. "
"3395790","3398170"," Basically this is horrible to say but."
"3398990","3400450"," Basically we end up doing is."
"3403570","3404950"," Is you need to re educate. "
"3406230","3408470"," And give some money to believe it or not yet."
"3408690","3411370"," Like I don't know if it's called re education but more educating."
"3412910","3413870"," Younger people. "
"3414530","3416070"," So they have their own agency."
"3417610","3418090"," And."
"3420470","3420950"," Yeah. "
"3422110","3427330"," You know it looks like they call that it's going to be a siege right so."
"3428110","3435330"," And then you proceed to level and go in and dismantle Hamas as an organization and likely."
"3436770","3437890"," You'd want Hamas. "
"3438990","3441330"," To be dismantled in Lebanon as well."
"3442510","3446170"," And dispersed you disperse all these people."
"3446730","3447210"," And. "
"3448770","3454590"," You get them you get them away from that object poverty and you send them to fucking school of all"
"3454590","3456930"," the sounds insane to say but you send them to school."
"3457950","3462190"," And you give them an education that is not just provided by."
"3463610","3464090"," People. "
"3465770","3470750"," That want you to be a human shield of some kind right or to get up your life or cause."
"3472390","3477550"," We've seen that we've seen that happen in previous generations and other conflicts as well."
"3479470","3484710"," So I think that does happen over time I think that is a likely scenario in the coming weeks and"
"3484710","3485570"," when that does happen. "
"3485810","3489750"," It likely won't be good for the US equity market is my point."
"3490790","3495110"," Is that right now though no is it going to be some time yes so."
"3495610","3500090"," If you're looking for that I guess if you're looking for that impact of the war. "
"3500090","3504110"," It's likely not today it's likely in the coming weeks."
"3505130","3509650"," Until that takes place or begins the machine that machine starts to roll itself out."
"3510250","3511770"," I wouldn't be looking for. "
"3512850","3516110"," That market crash scenario that you're looking for it as of yet."
"3517830","3519630"," Personally hold on one second I got to check some."
"3524720","3526240"," I guess PX really quick. "
"3526960","3530920"," See if we're catching that bounce yet on here's the half hour trigger bounce right here."
"3532600","3535580"," On SPX so you can see it here we get spy down below."
"3536360","3542980"," We have the bounce on SPX but still think due to that hourly trigger not crossing the daily. "
"3543980","3546940"," We could still be looking for more downside to come here."
"3548200","3551400"," So right down in there keep your eyes on SPX if you got this tool at home."
"3553120","3557800"," And see if they get their rejection down there to four to four to nine point one six on SPX. "
"3559760","3561480"," I'm going to leave SPX up right here."
"3562320","3565360"," Even though I'm trading spy I want to see if there's a rejection above here."
"3574310","3576730"," Yeah I don't think they have a choice anymore I'll be honest with you. "
"3578630","3581970"," You know the I don't think they want to be removed thing I got to be honest."
"3582570","3586310"," No this isn't I'm not picking sides here anything in any way shape or form."
"3588030","3591450"," This isn't like hey this is what captain wants to happen or anything like that. "
"3593030","3597830"," It's not a choice from I think from Israel's perspective and likely Saudi Arabia."
"3598590","3602410"," And a lot of Arab nations I don't think it's going to be like that you see guitar as well"
"3602410","3603570"," is trying to."
"3605450","3609210"," Trying to normalize right now I think they make it involved as well. "
"3609790","3611730"," There might be some kind of a backdoor."
"3614250","3617710"," Solution they're trying to come up with now that doesn't mean like that's what I want to see"
"3617710","3617970"," happen."
"3617970","3620610"," In a way should perform but that is how you do it. "
"3621130","3625430"," You remove militants remove older people you find out who they are."
"3625950","3632430"," And then you take the young people and women's children young people non combatants older older"
"3632430","3634990"," older people and you separate them from."
"3636710","3638190"," Militants basically people that are militants. "
"3638850","3640310"," That's how it's done so."
"3641490","3643770"," They did shit like that in Iraq too."
"3646830","3648850"," I don't know I don't know what to say on that but. "
"3651230","3653870"," That's likely the solution that they're thinking about."
"3659430","3663830"," Yeah no that's not true you've got Palestinians I got to tell you that there are there are made"
"3663830","3664190"," there."
"3664270","3667570"," There's a large Palestinian population within the West Bank. "
"3668050","3672410"," There's a large Palestinian population and many other nations including the US there are"
"3672410","3673830"," Palestinians that live in the US."
"3674730","3678730"," You may not know that or believe that but that's the case is Palestinians that live in Europe is"
"3678730","3680030"," Palestinians live all over the world."
"3680830","3682910"," And this to me looks like that last. "
"3684890","3689050"," This to me looks like that last moments where they're like you know what we're gonna fucking do is"
"3689050","3690610"," we're gonna disperse all of these people."
"3691490","3693570"," And that's what it looks like."
"3694490","3697050"," That's fine to be won't be able to play a victory. "
"3697470","3701750"," It's what it looks like 2024 says if the outlook holds no more rate hikes are needed."
"3702130","3707850"," Italy bonds breads not widening significantly and liquidity sterilization could be a useful tool."
"3708150","3711950"," A vitre also says the economy is facing stagnation rather than recession. "
"3712770","3714190"," So again ECB is there."
"3714630","3716110"," I'm just making some comments on the wires."
"3716490","3719010"," I'm gonna turn this shit off because this guy's useless right now. "
"3719010","3721330"," So this right here is what I'm looking for."
"3721430","3724910"," I want to see if there's rejection or not on SPX."
"3725010","3729410"," I'm looking to see if this squeezes up and over close puts. "
"3729890","3732490"," If it rejects and has continues to head to the downside."
"3733810","3734970"," Stay long puts here."
"3741420","3746760"," Yeah, you know you can say that you could like you know you can not I'm not in this room"
"3746760","3747600"," with that statement either. "
"3747600","3754660"," Like you'll never someone made a comment in the chat about something about like you'll never be"
"3754660","3757800"," able to do that or it'll never work or they'll always be."
"3758800","3763440"," Anger for the mill Palestinian state has been going on for thousands of years."
"3763620","3764600"," I'll tell you what. "
"3765700","3767680"," We have some examples of it working."
"3768460","3772440"," We have an example of it working in in Europe for Germany."
"3772980","3776540"," We have an example of it working in Japan. "
"3778500","3779660"," In World War II."
"3779980","3787060"," So you can you can actually bomb people into nothing."
"3787420","3791540"," You can actually disperse people or re educate people. "
"3791760","3797560"," It is possible how you get there is not pretty right."
"3797740","3800120"," It's it's not something you ever want to see either right."
"3800580","3801820"," How that happens. "
"3803640","3805780"," If you don't think there are examples of it happening."
"3806780","3809900"," We've got two examples of how it happens."
"3810460","3811420"," We've got two great ones. "
"3812380","3813800"," We actually have other examples."
"3815620","3816940"," You can even just bring up Rome."
"3817720","3820420"," Rome has many examples of it happening as well. "
"3820760","3820800"," So."
"3822780","3823680"," Can it happen?"
"3824120","3824260"," Yes."
"3825280","3828600"," Are those the examples that Israelis are likely looking at?"
"3828980","3829400"," Probably. "
"3830540","3832940"," If you want to see examples of where it has worked."
"3833820","3834560"," They got them."
"3834860","3834940"," Right. "
"3835300","3839120"," There are examples historically of how that happens."
"3839400","3842180"," And right now that other key point was Biden yesterday."
"3844620","3846880"," Usually Biden will say things. "
"3847100","3852700"," Not just Biden, but U.S. Presidents will in their commentary will mention."
"3855720","3857120"," We'll mention using."
"3862660","3864020"," Restraint where they can. "
"3864360","3866940"," And we did not hear that from Biden yesterday."
"3869140","3873880"," Yesterday I went through that speech and we didn't do it on the show, but I did go through it"
"3873880","3874440"," afterwards and."
"3876860","3879320"," It he didn't mention showing restraint. "
"3880000","3880420"," So."
"3881120","3886760"," I wonder if there's I wonder if there's more mechanics there in the guitar."
"3888080","3890260"," There's like that other component to this. "
"3890700","3892360"," What what seems publicly."
"3893060","3894420"," To be said to us."
"3895580","3899400"," You know, it's making me think that there's more going on. "
"3899660","3900960"," In the mechanics of the background."
"3901200","3904920"," The military to spin up and then you've got negotiations going on."
"3905860","3909180"," You likely have some negotiations going on with. "
"3909820","3911000"," This is going to shock you."
"3911200","3911460"," Egypt."
"3912540","3913860"," So right now we spend. "
"3914340","3916000"," I don't know what 20 billions it is."
"3916060","3918560"," It could be 1.5 billion dollars."
"3919780","3921280"," On Egypt every year. "
"3921760","3922260"," Four Palestinians."
"3922940","3924040"," You guys know that you might not."
"3924180","3925020"," Some of you might know it. "
"3925040","3926100"," Some of you might not know it, but."
"3926680","3928360"," We spend billions with Egypt."
"3928520","3930000"," We give Egypt eight every year. "
"3930740","3931100"," So."
"3931940","3935140"," You know, you could you meet with these countries and you offer them more money."
"3936040","3938860"," And you say we take some of these refugees in. "
"3939540","3942320"," If we give you more money, we'll take some of these over here."
"3942360","3943360"," We'll take some of those over there."
"3943360","3944520"," We'll put some of these over here. "
"3945300","3946260"," We have the West Bank."
"3946440","3946960"," It'll take some."
"3947080","3947640"," We got the US. "
"3947860","3948420"," They'll take some."
"3948520","3949440"," We got some European nations."
"3949440","3950260"," They'll take some. "
"3950660","3951760"," You guys have to take some."
"3951860","3953040"," We'll even give you money to take them."
"3958860","3960320"," Down a penny right now and puts. "
"3961360","3964060"," After all that drama right there, not a goddamn thing."
"3965100","3966300"," That whole move down."
"3966480","3966820"," Not a goddamn. "
"3967180","3968420"," I'm actually down right now."
"3975980","3976520"," So."
"3977480","3979980"," I don't want to say on this with with with. "
"3980580","3986400"," When you're on your question about like those little planes coming over and new bombing and stuff"
"3986400","3986840"," like that."
"3988000","3992940"," It looks like Goldman Sachs is on the same thesis or similar thesis."
"3993540","3994820"," Goldman Sachs is saying. "
"3995720","3999420"," You know, we've got that threat coming, but it's not here yet."
"3999420","4000980"," It's going to probably take weeks unfold."
"4002060","4005740"," It's whatever that threat is going to be or whatever the escalation is going to become. "
"4006460","4009440"," So I'd have like a I'd have like a holding pattern over the weekend."
"4010580","4014640"," I revisited it into Monday and then I would look at it again in the following week."
"4025410","4026310"," Yeah, I think it was Turkey. "
"4026490","4030510"," Nugget that said that Israel Palestinian conflict is like a fundamental flaw in human programming."
"4030530","4031370"," It will never be solved."
"4031550","4034550"," Palestinians will never give up on the idea of a Palestinian state. "
"4035170","4036770"," And Israel will never allow it."
"4037630","4043090"," I agree with those statements are all valid to some extent, but the fact that they won't attempt to"
"4043090","4043410"," do it."
"4044750","4047330"," I think they're at the point where they're going to attempt to do it. "
"4047550","4047770"," They're going to."
"4047910","4051170"," I think they're at the point where they're going to try to disperse all these people around the"
"4051170","4051390"," world."
"4052130","4053350"," That's what it looks like to me. "
"4060820","4062780"," Down at putty right now looking for a pullback."
"4069050","4070270"," I don't know if I'm going to get it here."
"4072980","4074420"," Down two pennies right now. "
"4082080","4085760"," Half hour trigger still holding up the market here on SPX."
"4086320","4089380"," That chart that you're looking at at the top right is SPX not spy."
"4092880","4097920"," Looks like that half hour trigger is buying time for the hourly trigger to come up to the daily"
"4097920","4098220"," trigger. "
"4100399","4134170"," Down a penny right now trying to"
"4134170","4136109"," close this trade without losing the penny, but."
"4142020","4146319"," Sowing for for 32 P's for a penny loss."
"4148399","4149580"," I thought I might grow up. "
"4149640","4152840"," Might be able to get another penny in here, but to be flat, but I'm not so."
"4154899","4157939"," Flat right now no trade took some calls earlier."
"4158520","4159580"," Didn't pan out for me. "
"4159819","4160200"," Took some puts."
"4160479","4160880"," They were up."
"4162260","4162520"," Decently. "
"4163080","4165540"," But I was looking for the rejection role to the downside."
"4166540","4168380"," For some protection didn't happen."
"4168380","4169439"," Some flat right now. "
"4169680","4170680"," No trade for me right now."
"4179430","4183930"," No, I'm comparing remost recent history, but we have other examples."
"4184729","4185490"," We have it. "
"4185590","4191590"," Yeah, I mean, we've got we've got modern history examples of the ability to do this, but you know,"
"4191609","4192109"," if you look back."
"4192370","4195850"," In antiquity and other other time periods."
"4196550","4197970"," We have other examples of. "
"4200370","4202010"," Smashing cultures, right."
"4202670","4203450"," Pretty brutal."
"4203850","4204770"," We have another one. "
"4204850","4205590"," You want to know another one?"
"4206310","4207350"," And we got another one."
"4207850","4209970"," I got one closer to home for you."
"4210470","4211250"," Native Americans. "
"4212250","4213650"," There's an example right there."
"4214450","4215510"," How about Native Americans?"
"4217690","4219270"," We've done that to them too, right?"
"4219470","4222010"," Our own country has done that to Native Americans."
"4222790","4226030"," We're not given the United States back to Native Americans, are we?"
"4227490","4232090"," And we have routed their culture, other people. "
"4233410","4234190"," That's brutal."
"4234510","4237370"," We've done to Native Americans, but we have examples of it."
"4238010","4243110"," Yeah, Janet Yellen. "
"4243830","4245470"," Every time she speaks, I can't."
"4245490","4246410"," I can't take her seriously."
"4247550","4248070"," I can't. "
"4249090","4250370"," I can't take her."
"4250430","4252230"," Especially in her newest role that she has."
"4252450","4253190"," I can't take her seriously. "
"4253670","4256270"," As a matter of fact, when she comes out, I'm like, I'm like, go away."
"4256430","4256930"," Don't do this."
"4256930","4258190"," It's not the time for you to be talking. "
"4272050","4274210"," SPX just parked right now in the daily trigger."
"4275190","4280630"," Half hour trigger holding up the market right now, waiting on the hourly trigger to finally come"
"4280630","4284030"," above and do a cross on SPX."
"4284370","4285630"," So far, nothing going on. "
"4286630","4289270"," Just a matter of time here for the hourly trigger to come up."
"4297140","4298660"," Oh, donate button on Twitch."
"4299220","4301620"," I don't know if there's a donate button on Twitch. "
"4302800","4304140"," I appreciate you asking."
"4304440","4305240"," Hold on a second here."
"4306500","4308260"," I will post one right now. "
"4308620","4313200"," I don't get too many donations, so I appreciate that."
"4313400","4314780"," I should ask for donations more."
"4315520","4316720"," There's a donate button. "
"4317480","4322040"," I should probably be more, I should probably ask more frequently, but I don't."
"4324500","4326160"," Okay, I'll put a donate button up for you."
"4326960","4327920"," I'm tight here. "
"4329120","4336480"," If you want to support the stream, this is the best way to support the stream."
"4345290","4346650"," That's the most direct way."
"4347310","4351890"," Most ways that you support these kind of things, you've got like hands out. "
"4352310","4353350"," YouTube's like, I need to cut."
"4354390","4355630"," Streamlabs is like, I need to cut."
"4356390","4357430"," Twitter is like, I need to cut. "
"4357650","4358190"," Everybody needs to cut."
"4358290","4358790"," They're like, I need to cut."
"4358930","4359310"," I need to cut. "
"4359470","4359850"," I need to cut."
"4360210","4361990"," I need to cut."
"4361990","4363110"," Government, of course, wants their cut. "
"4363290","4363890"," They want their taxes."
"4364790","4367210"," So at the time you get your cut, it's like pennies."
"4368510","4372590"," The easiest way to support the stream is through this link that I just posted to you. "
"4373410","4374710"," It's the most direct way."
"4380200","4382500"," Now, you're richer than most of us plabs."
"4382860","4387800"," Yeah, that might be true, but I don't take the donations because I need them. "
"4387860","4389320"," I take them because it makes me feel good."
"4390780","4393440"," It makes me know that I'm doing the right thing or the wrong thing."
"4394920","4396760"," You guys aren't appreciating the content. "
"4396960","4397700"," You want different content."
"4398640","4399880"," Or you do appreciate the content."
"4401000","4404740"," I don't know what that function is, but it does matter to me. "
"4404960","4405580"," So it just heads up."
"4405720","4407120"," It does mean something to me."
"4412460","4414600"," If we could get the red bar down, I should have waited. "
"4420360","4423140"," We should have, they're 27 right now."
"4423280","4427600"," So we should have waited for that red bar reversal of the downside before closing out those butts."
"4430840","4432160"," Or make a tab for it. "
"4432940","4434000"," Okay, let me look that up."
"4434440","4435540"," Make a donate tab."
"4439910","4441090"," I didn't know I could do that. "
"4442170","4445690"," So put a donate tab on Twitch or YouTube."
"4446970","4449290"," I don't even know if I have a donate tab on YouTube either."
"4450050","4452130"," I got no idea if that's there or not. "
"4452650","4454690"," I'm not a Mathisavius streamer."
"4454690","4464530"," I think part of it is that part of the reason why Mathisavius streamer is because I"
"4464530","4469490"," didn't pay attention to when nobody was following and we didn't care about it."
"4474800","4476800"," And yeah, I didn't get that one right there. "
"4476900","4477980"," Did I lost that one right there?"
"4481930","4482690"," No bounce."
"4483190","4483490"," No trade."
"4487690","4489410"," Just parked and waiting on SPX. "
"4490610","4495450"," So I didn't like have that two or three time years where I was always focused on making money."
"4496070","4501430"," A lot of streamers are, I don't know if it's horrible to say or not, but a lot of streamers"
"4501430","4502550"," don't have viewers."
"4503230","4507630"," So what they do is they end up spending like three years, like two, it's about two to three years. "
"4508170","4513710"," It's been like two to three years learning in and outs of the back end of streaming."
"4515790","4520530"," So I'll meet streamers that I like have no like zero followers and they'll know everything."
"4520530","4523930"," They'll be like, I can tell you everything you need to do to make money. "
"4524990","4532770"," And because they've done it for three years, no money and they rely upon that money to help them"
"4532770","4533510"," continue to stream."
"4534930","4539170"," And then after about three years, they get really downtrodden and they start getting viewers."
"4539470","4541390"," I don't know why that is with the mechanics of that are. "
"4543070","4548850"," So they've been like they had the time period to know how to make money as a content provider,"
"4549210","4551690"," producer or maker."
"4553570","4557130"," And I don't I just like started streaming was like fuck all this."
"4557690","4560470"," I think I'm just here to do a set of talks about other traders. "
"4561150","4562950"," So I've never I never went down that path."
"4568440","4570460"," Starting only fans of selling feet pics."
"4574520","4575520"," That's too funny. "
"4577600","4578620"," Hot tub stream."
"4582640","4584200"," Yeah, I had a really shitty microphone."
"4584820","4588060"," I had a crappy ass microphone at two or three crappy microphones. "
"4588960","4590820"," The mic now is okay, but it's not great."
"4591380","4592600"," The microphone that I have now."
"4593900","4596280"," Is like the last step. "
"4597940","4600820"," Before going to high end microphone."
"4601840","4606020"," But once I do the high end microphone, it like opens the can of worms."
"4607180","4610520"," And I don't think that we're there yet to open that can of worms. "
"4610840","4612820"," We're almost there, but we're not quite there."
"4613800","4616920"," Because like you're like, I'll get the microphone and then they're like, Oh, no, I gotta get a"
"4616920","4617980"," different mixing board."
"4618100","4620900"," I gotta get a bunch of cables and then I gotta do a bunch of programming. "
"4621760","4624060"," Sort of like it like opens up this Pandora box."
"4624200","4625960"," So we're almost there for that, but not quite."
"4628020","4633260"," But yeah, I had a had a Peter camera to had a shitty still have it. "
"4633340","4634240"," I got it sitting here somewhere."
"4634700","4642100"," I got to like a and then I improved my cameras and microphones and then eventually ended up buying"
"4642100","4649500"," better computers, better connections, better wiring about a Sony a 7000 or something 6000."
"4649500","4656960"," I don't know which one it is, but some better like even even the headphones are they're great, but"
"4656960","4660300"," they're not like the best or the best name brand. "
"4660920","4662380"," They're great headphones though."
"4662460","4663300"," They feel good at my ears."
"4664360","4669380"," And they cost 100 bucks or something like that or I don't know 70 bucks or something like that. "
"4675480","4676260"," Yeah, yeah."
"4678360","4679380"," I'm almost there."
"4679640","4683460"," I've been looking at them and thinking about it. "
"4683600","4686360"," Then I watch YouTube videos on it and then it's like it."
"4686700","4688300"," It's more a process than it is."
"4688560","4689880"," Just do it thing for myself. "
"4691480","4699680"," I've got a mixing I've got a mixing board and I've got I've got the highest rated non XLR type"
"4699680","4700960"," mic stuff like that."
"4700960","4705200"," I looked into fee picks."
"4710430","4711310"," Too funny. "
"4718530","4719910"," Yeah, no trades for me right here."
"4719950","4720730"," I want to wait and see."
"4723230","4726650"," I took two trades there both up briefly and then they both went down. "
"4727330","4730550"," So I'm like fucking we'll just wait wait for this shit to consolidate."
"4761500","4762960"," I don't know man."
"4763180","4763920"," We kind of had. "
"4766420","4769660"," You know, I guess I can agree with you to a point that."
"4770560","4772320"," The 10 years tied to."
"4773200","4776280"," The market, but we kind of knew that it was selling off, didn't we?"
"4776480","4778140"," I mean, even I closed my calls. "
"4778600","4780940"," We bought the bottom exactly where we should buy it."
"4781040","4783380"," We sold right where the market rolled."
"4784280","4789100"," We even said two days ago that whatever squeeze happens yesterday would come back to test. "
"4791160","4794280"," The daily and hourly trigger, which is happening right now."
"4794600","4794720"," So."
"4796500","4801440"," Yay, though, I believe in the 10 year auction and it's tied to the market and oil is tied to"
"4801440","4801760"," the market. "
"4801760","4803120"," We kind of anticipate the stuff."
"4803300","4803400"," So."
"4807180","4814980"," Yeah, I'm not like anti the. "
"4816900","4821220"," The 10 year mattering, but as long as we can see it, I think it's fine."
"4825890","4828270"," Any thoughts on current weakness and H Y G?"
"4829390","4832850"," Yeah, I think the weakness is tied to SPX up here."
"4833030","4834370"," So here's SPX right here. "
"4836650","4840370"," It's either waiting for the cross of this right here."
"4843330","4844990"," So we're either buying time here."
"4845830","4848230"," Or we buy time and it blasts down here. "
"4850170","4853690"," And solid eight in here and eventually head to the upside up here."
"4854470","4854950"," So."
"4855330","4858870"," I think H Y G is showing that as well. "
"4861990","4863650"," Vix blasting off right now."
"4865490","4869290"," Vix tagged 1745 and rolled down."
"4870910","4875270"," Bounced off 1745, so we're not seeing a ton of price movements in SPX right now. "
"4875270","4877890"," That's good to see even with the role on H Y G."
"4878690","4879550"," Not seeing."
"4880970","4882850"," Not seeing huge price divergence."
"4882930","4885030"," Even if we go down here and trade this for. "
"4886090","4887090"," 32 nine."
"4887910","4889530"," Even if we trade this down here."
"4890490","4894850"," For all that for all that bearishness and the divergence and all that. "
"4896550","4898370"," Still have that S one down here."
"4898810","4900250"," Check it in down below here."
"4904870","4907390"," Dixie crossing to the upside right now as well. "
"4907390","4910150"," We almost have a one here and we take a look at Dixie."
"4913350","4915690"," Dixie just going to roll down here and just check this."
"4916070","4920150"," We've got a Dixie bull cross in the five minute chart here. "
"4923170","4927330"," We look on Dixie in a five minute should roll down a little bit more, but then bounce."
"4929110","4931630"," Dixie with a target of 106 point 20."
"4932490","4937230"," Nasdaq rolling over right now starting to sperm up and set up a five minute roll. "
"4938530","4940390"," One minute charts already showing it."
"4940650","4945110"," Five minute chart has a larger one coming into play right now."
"4945770","4946810"," Tesla rolling over. "
"4947630","4948410"," Apple rolling over."
"4956720","4964700"," SPX price target 4329.16. Spooze week right now looking for 432 point 32."
"4965540","4966920"," You can see it right here. "
"4976520","4980040"," I think I'm going to wait to react to the 10 year auction about to happen."
"4980040","4983280"," If you get a chance, can you see if Oscar has any hope at all?"
"4983360","4984280"," Look at Oscar really quick."
"4985180","4986820"," I'm just saying I'll check that one out for you. "
"4998100","5000040"," I like that ticker a lot by the way."
"5024600","5026040"," Yeah, we wrote it up from what?"
"5026320","5026680"," When do we write?"
"5026860","5029740"," We started writing this up two or three bucks, right?"
"5031840","5035460"," Rejected off the monthly trigger down here."
"5035560","5036580"," Let's take a look at Oscar really quick. "
"5041760","5043800"," I'm going to put Oscar up down below here."
"5045220","5047080"," You've got Oscar health on a daily trigger."
"5048760","5052800"," Oscar trading nicely traded Oscar earlier in the year, traded all the way up here. "
"5053440","5058500"," Rejected off the monthly trigger at $10 coming back down here."
"5059320","5059700"," Told no."
"5060880","5063200"," No dip by here yet for Oscar health. "
"5065080","5067620"," Trading 508 right to 508 right now."
"5067620","5075620"," You have a daily cross below the weekly cross happening back on September 12th."
"5077240","5082320"," Rejection to the downside likely path for Oscar health is to retest. "
"5083000","5085970"," Quick second."
"5088950","5096210"," Retest of 363 and likely even retest this prior low here at $2."
"5096430","5099310"," You want to look for a reaction on both of these prices here. "
"5099310","5101610"," So $361 and $2."
"5104090","5105030"," $361 and $2."
"5105310","5109070"," You want to be looking for any signs of a turnaround or consolidation. "
"5109870","5119720"," So on Oscar health, either consolidation"
"5119720","5121720"," here is what you're looking for."
"5127640","5128800"," Or down here."
"5133060","5135960"," So if you're watching Oscar health in the bottom of your screen down here. "
"5137060","5140660"," You want to begin to see, so you're not seeing it here, right?"
"5140880","5141800"," That's not it, is it?"
"5142540","5146060"," So down here you want to see like consolidation like boom, boom, boom, boom."
"5146900","5148960"," You see this yellow line cross down here."
"5150260","5152100"," You'll see some kind of bottoming action. "
"5152100","5156980"," You'll see the consolidation and then the break above take a trade on Oscar health."
"5157480","5159540"," So no trade on Oscar health right now."
"5159700","5163260"," Another thing to be keyed into an Oscar health is go to a 30 minute chart. "
"5171680","5173740"," We've got no break above the hourly trigger."
"5174100","5177420"," We've got no conformation trade above the hourly trigger."
"5180320","5182760"," And you've got no reversal here above the daily trigger. "
"5183120","5185660"," So to get bullish on Oscar health again."
"5185920","5187360"," So let's just say today this was bottom."
"5189200","5191420"," Let's say this was bottom right here in Oscar health. "
"5192480","5194400"," For you to take another long on it."
"5211440","5214480"," You'll be looking for price to come up, right?"
"5215340","5216180"," Squeeze up here."
"5232480","5233620"," Right there, right?"
"5255590","5257330"," Something like this right here. "
"5258110","5263440"," Oh, should I just delete it?"
"5263800","5265560"," You get the point I'm trying to make, right?"
"5266960","5269620"," And you don't have a cross of the daily over the weekly."
"5269900","5270980"," Even this hair is bad."
"5271260","5274760"," So it's something like this right here. "
"5274820","5278220"," But even so, you wouldn't take that trade until you're up here."
"5278900","5279660"," Can you see that up there?"
"5279800","5279980"," Hold on."
"5280300","5281620"," Let's see if you can see that up there. "
"5286580","5288860"," So you got the cross of the daily over the weekly."
"5289340","5296660"," You need price to make its way back up."
"5296780","5300700"," And you need the daily trigger to be crossing that weekly trigger and the hourly to be underneath"
"5300700","5300960"," it. "
"5301020","5302120"," So that hasn't happened yet."
"5302700","5304880"," So no trade, no buy on Oscar health."
"5304960","5307960"," You got zero, zero place to buy Oscar health. "
"5308400","5313080"," Tired to the downside, $3.63. And $2."
"5313820","5319980"," So you're not going to see that dip buy down here until the dip buy or you haven't seen"
"5319980","5324960"," consolidation or you have not seen a crossing of the daily above the weekly trigger."
"5325660","5327640"," It's not showing it in any way shape or form. "
"5328400","5329280"," But there's a dip buy in Oscar."
"5343300","5346120"," Spooze bouncing and holding the half hour trigger in the daily right now."
"5346320","5347160"," Still no trade for me. "
"5347500","5348580"," I've taken two trades here."
"5348820","5350820"," I've been both trades."
"5351060","5358080"," I've been in lost one penny on one trade and then I lost 10 or 13 cents on the first"
"5358080","5358860"," trade that I was in. "
"5358860","5360200"," So just grinding down here."
"5361220","5365840"," And I'm not going to give a bunch of cash to this grinding and consolidation."
"5368320","5369060"," Up or down. "
"5369220","5370200"," I'm going to give nothing to it."
"5370340","5372000"," So I want nothing to do with any of this grinding."
"5372440","5373640"," Nothing to do with trying to buy dips. "
"5373940","5377260"," Nothing to do with trying to look for blood baths, any of that kind of stuff."
"5377580","5378780"," All of this looks like consolidation."
"5379940","5383520"," And we're waiting for this hourly trigger to cross and come up on high. "
"5383740","5385180"," So we're waiting for this right here right now."
"5392560","5394480"," Waiting for this kind of action here."
"5397150","5398690"," Up here, grab that daily trigger. "
"5398930","5399690"," We start moving higher."
"5411330","5412890"," I'm going to give me a few seconds here."
"5412990","5413930"," I'm going to look at another trade. "
"5414350","5420710"," So give me a few minutes here because I want to buy a dip and I want to see if"
"5420710","5422250"," there's potential to buy a dip here."
"5422370","5422670"," Hold on."
"5446960","5448080"," You know, dude, I want that. "
"5448240","5449760"," I want that sexy dip buy."
"5451440","5457890"," I want that."
"5458030","5460190"," I want that dip buy it like on spy. "
"5460570","5461330"," I want 430."
"5462270","5465530"," I want 430 pretty badly."
"5470580","5473040"," Let me check the gamma profile this morning. "
"5474740","5477700"," Like I really want like 430 78."
"5479280","5484780"," 430 78 somewhere down there for maybe even the 429 and a half somewhere in there."
"5484940","5488580"," So just patience right now. "
"5489060","5490840"," Keep doing the patience from yesterday."
"5497380","5500600"," I'm like, oh, I might have to have a trade right now at this one moment."
"5500620","5501400"," I've got to have to have a trade. "
"5501480","5503400"," And I'm like, I don't need a fucking trade at this one moment."
"5505280","5507140"," I'll just be lazy and sit around and wait."
"5513510","5516970"," And take a look at the gamma profile for this morning. "
"5525820","5528420"," Dealer gamma is that minus 303 million."
"5529640","5531720"," Gamma flips at 4360."
"5531720","5533300"," I think we all know that. "
"5534660","5536840"," 0 to 8 call walls at 4365."
"5537700","5539280"," The call walls at 4300."
"5540540","5541760"," That's a big one to know. "
"5542680","5546740"," The comma call gamma resistance line is at 4375."
"5548440","5551720"," Put gamma support is at 4300."
"5554500","5555600"," Let me see here. "
"5558320","5563760"," Participants are hedging for a move higher as evidenced by a large amount of zero day calls just"
"5563760","5564700"," above the gamma flip."
"5565520","5572060"," You see a large OI build at 4400 as this is becoming the new call wall, which should put a"
"5572060","5574100"," lid on further upside beyond that level."
"5575080","5575720"," So 4400. "
"5585040","5586420"," Looking like the top."
"5586420","5588840"," U.S. has not ratified that treaty."
"5589500","5592340"," We never have ratified that treaty would be a better way to word that. "
"5593460","5597340"," But would it only assume nuclear tests if the U.S. is doing the same?"
"5598600","5603440"," According to Russian Foreign Ministry, the U.S. is preparing a nuclear test in Nevada."
"5604420","5605900"," I don't know if I believe that."
"5606540","5608960"," We don't need to anymore in my view, but maybe. "
"5610060","5612480"," I do think it's funny that Russia is making that statement."
"5614080","5617120"," Lavrov will visit China October 16th, the 18th."
"5617400","5620660"," Israel says it will bomb trucks if Egypt supplies Gaza. "
"5622360","5625940"," According to spokesman Kirby, the U.S. and Israel have not seen any firm evidence of Iran"
"5625940","5631420"," involvement in the Hamas attack and that there is no policy decision on rephrasing Iranian money."
"5632340","5635440"," Another note on that is you're likely going to see."
"5636660","5639700"," You're likely going to see news stories. "
"5641340","5643080"," Trying to push that narrative."
"5647740","5650420"," They're going to try to push the narrative of drawing Iran in."
"5650620","5653460"," They're going to try to see news stories trying to draw in Hezbollah. "
"5657320","5663980"," Hamas is warning residents of Ash Kellan to leave the town until 1700 local time."
"5664660","5669520"," IDF stated today that the U.S. had advised them that U.S. naval warship or native vessels in"
"5669520","5672280"," aircraft and carrier strike from 12 will soon be in the eastern med."
"5672920","5678620"," Are prepared and assisting with combat operations alongside Israel and if a multi front war against"
"5678620","5681020"," Hezbollah or the regional actors occurs. "
"5684340","5686580"," There's a bunch of other shit that they can do too."
"5687420","5697220"," So like that carrier group can offer defensive capabilities in case there are"
"5697220","5700820"," cruise missiles that come in from Iran or Lebanon."
"5701700","5703840"," But they offer hospital ships. "
"5704080","5706860"," They offer rebuilding capabilities as well."
"5707520","5708680"," No one likes to talk about that stuff."
"5709400","5716260"," It was like talk about the offensive capabilities. "
"5720360","5723400"," Let's check out the long term treasury yields chart here."
"5727400","5728760"," Oh shit, I didn't put the stream up."
"5729100","5730240"," I put that on Twitter. "
"5734270","5735150"," Spy cues."
"5736010","5737330"," Take a look at Tesla today as well."
"5738990","5740470"," Now we'll look at GME today. "
"5741430","5742670"," I don't think we looked at GME yesterday."
"5742930","5744010"," So look at Tesla, GME."
"5744690","5745970"," We'll look at NVDA. "
"5746870","5749030"," We'll look at Apple as well."
"5752770","5753570"," Live stream."
"5758560","5760540"," No, we're not adding anything. "
"5760980","5761560"," That's all."
"5761960","5794340"," All right, so"
"5794340","5795380"," I got the post up there."
"5795800","5796500"," Close that out. "
"5797180","5798560"," Close that out for now."
"5804840","5806220"," Tomorrow I've got initial claims."
"5807520","5810080"," CPI, core CPI, year over year CPI. "
"5811220","5815380"," So security admin releases annual cost of living adjustments, core CPI over year."
"5815700","5824220"," Boston Fred, Fed President Collins speaks at 4 p.m. Hold on one second here."
"5824300","5825040"," I got a voicemail. "
"5825100","5825640"," I got a 10, too."
"5825780","5826360"," Hold on one second here."
"5881270","5882470"," Give me one second here guys. "
"5943100","5945720"," Small inverse of head and shoulders happening right now, guys."
"6075000","6076700"," Small cross taking place right now."
"6078160","6079920"," Small inverse head and shoulders here. "
"6080720","6081220"," Tiny one."
"6086300","6088500"," Another one right here, a little one right here."
"6089280","6090200"," Is that one right there?"
"6090340","6092640"," I guess it would be the question where we go up here. "
"6095680","6098320"," No cross yet, but almost a cross to go long here."
"6099300","6099860"," Almost."
"6102100","6103620"," You're watching for the cross. "
"6104760","6106400"," Let's go to spy really quick."
"6108880","6111860"," Let's see if we've got the alert to go long yet."
"6112780","6123870"," Not quite, but almost pay attention"
"6123870","6127670"," to this right here. "
"6129490","6135830"," And that will turn red and green right now still red."
"6136950","6138850"," Not quite in green to the green yet."
"6147810","6149150"," I'm not a fan of this still. "
"6149590","6151550"," I'm still not a fan of longs here."
"6153330","6159090"," I don't want to see like boom that and then down to where that SPX hourly trigger is and then"
"6159090","6159530"," right there."
"6162890","6167950"," I am going to start to look for a trade though for as a bull. "
"6169610","6172230"," Someone will be looking at some call spreads here in just a minute."
"6172550","6173610"," Excuse me just a second here."
"6173870","6178970"," I was looking at the rest of the week what we have going on. "
"6180830","6185170"," We also have the minutes coming out at 2pm for the next 46 minutes."
"6185710","6186510"," So we're going to wait for that."
"6186510","6188850"," We're going to wait for that for the Fed minutes to come out. "
"6189550","6192510"," And I'm going to be looking at a call spread for 40."
"6193290","6194210"," Was I looking at earlier?"
"6194550","6194950"," 4400?"
"6196690","6197410"," Hold on here."
"6199270","6200090"," Give me one quick second. "
"6202870","6211520"," I thought I read this a few minutes ago and we can check that right now."
"6217850","6219770"," Look at the gamma stuff in the background here."
"6233640","6235400"," Let's go to the gamma chart over here. "
"6236800","6275120"," Let's check"
"6275120","6276340"," out our current gamma."
"6287990","6290190"," Yes, we're below gamma flip right now."
"6316950","6318950"," So your gamma flip is right there. "
"6320110","6330690"," The gamma"
"6330690","6331770"," flip set up 43."
"6333130","6333890"," 4370."
"6335590","6343010"," There is, there is, if you look on gamma here, let's go over a full screen chart. "
"6344550","6346170"," Look at gamma here."
"6346930","6350550"," You can see this resistance above on SPX."
"6351630","6354210"," And they sold into this gamma here. "
"6354210","6355150"," Right?"
"6357190","6359910"," You got this whole move right here to the downside."
"6362890","6364830"," That's at 4300."
"6367510","6370510"," And that's right where this is SPX. "
"6370870","6375970"," This is right where the hourly trigger is."
"6376470","6377530"," This is the hourly trigger."
"6380590","6382930"," This expectation is we're going to come down there and bounce. "
"6386910","6387870"," So that's the case."
"6388350","6391090"," If that's the case that we're going to, let's just draw it in."
"6393310","6394650"," Let's see, seller is up here. "
"6397730","6400570"," Let's leave that there now and just see if it plays itself out."
"6402230","6418860"," And if we were to go to a named that SPX"
"6418860","6468010"," was kind of"
"6468010","6473070"," funny because I'm like, whatever I say, something like this, I'm like, I never get it."
"6473210","6474530"," Like it never gives me what I want. "
"6480730","6482370"," CJJ wants to buy this dip."
"6482470","6484290"," Every time I say CJJ wants to buy this dip."
"6485770","6487050"," It never happens. "
"6495600","6497360"," Yeah, I guess we'll do a possessive."
"6499820","6501740"," CJJ wants to buy this dip right here."
"6503800","6505760"," So that's the dip that I want to buy. "
"6506580","6508980"," Do I think we're getting this buy down here?"
"6509420","6510180"," I don't know."
"6510700","6511320"," I'd hope to."
"6511980","6514780"," We'll leave that one up right there and see if we can get it. "
"6516100","6518300"," Oh, spy selling right now."
"6518840","6524420"," Spy weak right now, trading $4.33.39. Looking to come down into S1."
"6524980","6526620"," We'll leave SPX down here. "
"6528140","6532120"," And we'll look to see if I actually get to buy that stuff."
"6533100","6535820"," So we'll see if this is the dip that I can buy."
"6535820","6537060"," Whoop, right down there. "
"6537640","6540720"," V shape recovery and buy that one right there."
"6540980","6542200"," So that's the one that I'm looking to buy."
"6543060","6544120"," So we'll leave this up. "
"6548560","6549920"," You can see that right there."
"6551860","6553180"," That's SPX by the way."
"6558240","6560700"," I got your gamma for you so you know your gamma. "
"6564200","6565680"," Sit on your hands, baby."
"6566520","6567220"," You're a bull."
"6567220","6568120"," Sit on your hands. "
"6570600","6573920"," We weren't called the military industrial complex for nothing."
"6576540","6581120"," I don't know what that was your in relation to, but we are."
"6581560","6584860"," That's one of the most like frustrating things for me. "
"6586320","6592300"," Is one of the most frustrating things for me is Eisenhower's great speech that he gave."
"6593540","6594780"," I ended up reading."
"6595300","6597380"," I ended up reading an autobiography. "
"6597840","6598360"," I think it was an autobiography."
"6598580","6603320"," Either his wife wrote it or a good friend of his wrote the book."
"6603880","6611560"," I read I read I read at least two biography autobiographies from Eisenhower and"
"6611560","6616180"," man, what a what a guy like. "
"6617400","6618860"," That speech that he gave."
"6620400","6621760"," That speech that he gave."
"6624280","6625700"," That speech that he gave. "
"6627500","6629120"," Was so true, right?"
"6630960","6636040"," The rise of the military industrial complex in the books that I read were fascinating."
"6636700","6640200"," If you ever get a chance try to read some biography."
"6640560","6645660"," I don't I think I don't remember which ones I read, but the ones that I read were either by"
"6645660","6649140"," I think one was from his aid to camp that wrote one. "
"6650160","6657040"," And I don't know who the other one was from, but it was fascinating because the rise of the"
"6657040","6661720"," military industrial complex at the end of World War II or leading into the end of World War II."
"6662820","6665860"," He started to become overridden in his decision making."
"6666720","6668960"," And that's what led to the speech that he gave. "
"6671300","6676900"," And like the power brokers that were in the war early stages of the war were no longer making the"
"6676900","6682180"," decisions that led to that that led to that speech."
"6682820","6684360"," And I'm a full believer in that too."
"6685740","6688920"," The military industrial complex is not to be fucked with, is it?"
"6690400","6694220"," They are no good. "
"6694680","6696820"," I'm not a fan of the military industrial complex."
"6697660","6699080"," I am and I'm not."
"6699080","6703360"," I should, I got to like, I got to wait. "
"6703620","6710340"," You know, it's very similar to the Palestinian or the Hamas and Israeli crisis right now."
"6710360","6712200"," I should be very clear in that it's not Palestinian."
"6712520","6717400"," It's Hamas and it's the state or the country of Israel. "
"6721720","6723440"," And they have their benefits."
"6723720","6728600"," They're military industrial complex, but they're really bad, bad, bad, bad."
"6737170","6739110"," Thanks for following crew chief, usaf. "
"6739510","6741570"," I was stationed on an Air Force base once."
"6742390","6743290"," You guys have it made."
"6744250","6747030"," I was stationed on us on Air Force base. "
"6748270","6750070"," I had a kick ass job."
"6752130","6758230"," My, my, who I was with was stationed on army bases, but I was with us army command."
"6758470","6762970"," So I was on a, I was on a, I got the good life and I was stationed in like"
"6762970","6764190"," golf. "
"6764770","6765990"," They got condominiums."
"6766130","6769290"," I didn't get to sleep because it's a point of note here."
"6769910","6772590"," I didn't get to actually sleep in a nice place on that Air Force base. "
"6772610","6775390"," I slept on a GP U.S. Army GP large."
"6776110","6777550"," I don't know if I remember that right."
"6778390","6781750"," Don't hold me to this shit because it's been a few years since it's been the army, but it was"
"6781750","6782630"," a GP large tent. "
"6782670","6792490"," I slept on the edge of the base where the South Koreans were defending that"
"6792490","6792770"," base."
"6793270","6800210"," So we're like these rice patties and some no go zones and stuff like that outside of that base."
"6801330","6803290"," Yeah, I got a, I got a funny story about that place. "
"6803910","6805170"," I don't know if you were ever stationed there."
"6805270","6806170"," It was not Air Force base."
"6806290","6807030"," No station there. "
"6807650","6809930"," I went all over the country, but I was there."
"6811150","6812210"," I got a funny story."
"6812430","6816250"," So Air Force has it made, not quite as good. "
"6816390","6820650"," I don't think as some naval personnel, but they got it really good."
"6821590","6823110"," Air Force has it pretty much the best."
"6823650","6829630"," And if you're a soldier, you're an Army soldier in an Air Force base, it's horrible to say. "
"6831270","6834310"," You'd have like the SPs you have in the Air Force."
"6834430","6836090"," I can't remember, but you'll get your security patrol."
"6836270","6837590"," I think it was called their security forces. "
"6838150","6840170"," It's called security forces in the Air Force have."
"6840410","6844970"," Those are like the badasses or like there are a lot, like there's bigger badasses."
"6845250","6850050"," They've got, I don't know if PJs come, I think PJs might be Navy, but I think what the Air"
"6850050","6852810"," Force special forces is called, but then just below it. "
"6853210","6856290"," Their combat arms is like their security forces."
"6857770","6862430"," So you're like US Army soldier, right?"
"6862630","6865490"," If you're infantry or any kind of combat arms and you got an Air Force base."
"6868230","6873070"," You're like a peg above to some to the, you're like, or not a peg above. "
"6873250","6875510"," You're like fighting with security forces while you're there."
"6875570","6876130"," They don't like you."
"6876670","6880570"," It's the point because you're like upsetting the normal order of things for the Air Force. "
"6882990","6885970"," And so I never fucked with those guys."
"6886230","6887290"," I never wanted to get fucked with."
"6887290","6891450"," I never wanted to get arrested or any MPs or SPs and that kind of stuff, but. "
"6893930","6896730"," I don't know if that's estimating, SP might be Navy, but whatever."
"6897030","6897410"," It doesn't matter."
"6897790","6902230"," What the point was was that a living was good on that Air Force base outside of sleeping"
"6902230","6902610"," arrangements. "
"6903570","6904990"," I wish I was in the Air Force."
"6906930","6911030"," Although you have more danger than Army."
"6911370","6913710"," I was talking to my daughter about this this two weeks ago. "
"6914110","6914870"," I was like, you know what?"
"6915190","6919230"," I was like, living life is awesome in the Air Force and the Navy, but."
"6920130","6925470"," Unlike a lot of the, or perception wise, unlike a lot of the Navy, excuse me, the Marines and the"
"6925470","6925670"," Army."
"6926330","6931150"," You kind of have control over your own destiny to an extent in the Army in Marines. "
"6931710","6932790"," You think that you do."
"6932970","6934590"," You're like, I'm a ground pounder like."
"6935990","6941130"," You know, I'm not going to face what an Air Force base or a ship in the middle of the"
"6941130","6941910"," sea is going to face. "
"6942430","6947130"," And that's the one thing about being Navy and Air Force is you're like, you gotta like the giant"
"6947130","6948430"," bullseye on your head."
"6949070","6953870"," And I used to be in planning meetings on this Air Force base, not on the Air Force base."
"6954010","6957430"," We go somewhere, I feel we go to do these planning meetings, but. "
"6958930","6961590"," Like being an Air Force base is fucking awesome, but."
"6962690","6965410"," If anything kicks off, you're like the first guy to go."
"6965510","6966950"," You're like, you're out of there. "
"6967330","6970030"," Like you fire everything you got, and then you run, right?"
"6971590","6973810"," Run south as far as you possibly can."
"6974550","6974650"," And."
"6976030","6980270"," Oh, son was fascinating because you're like, even the war gaming and the war planning, it was like. "
"6981130","6983390"," You're like just, you're like a sitting duck sore thumb."
"6983390","6986070"," You're like number one in the list of bomb, where to get bombed."
"6987890","6990610"," So I was trying to explain to my daughter, I'm like, you have better living arrangements. "
"6991390","6992610"," You live much better."
"6992810","6993730"," It's much easier going."
"6994550","6996990"," But you've got a giant fucking bullseye in your head. "
"6997370","6998290"," Navy is the same way."
"6998590","6999030"," You're like us."
"6999450","7001270"," If anything ever kicks off, you're fucked. "
"7001510","7005250"," You're like, you don't lose like a hundred guys or women or men or women or whatever."
"7005310","7006230"," You lose like thousands."
"7008110","7009510"," So I'm like, you got to pick your poison here. "
"7010310","7011210"," What do you want to be?"
"7011210","7014310"," Do you want to do you want to be picked off one by one or do you want to go"
"7014310","7015750"," as a group?"
"7021260","7023100"," Oh, the military believes that too."
"7023260","7023580"," Trust me."
"7023740","7028980"," Military, military planning absolutely knows that they're the first ones to go. "
"7029380","7033700"," Or at least the ones that I sat in knew they were the first ones to go."
"7033800","7036080"," But they've got, they've got a great food."
"7036420","7040080"," The one thing a good, the things that could partake in on an air force base. "
"7040080","7042740"," Number one was golf was awesome."
"7043100","7048120"," And number two, especially as an enlisted soldier, you get first dibs outside of high-ranking"
"7048120","7049820"," officers."
"7050360","7052820"," And then the second cool part was food. "
"7053160","7054440"," The food was phenomenal."
"7055160","7061000"," So I got my first DFAC for the air force and I'm like, this is amazing."
"7061920","7063040"," They got everything. "
"7063460","7067500"," They had like stations set up with cooks."
"7068180","7069880"," So you'd have like the main food line."
"7070240","7072680"," And then you'd go like, they'd have like some guy doing walkshit. "
"7072860","7075980"," And you'd have another guy doing like, or a woman or a man doesn't matter."
"7076220","7079560"," Just like cooks like cooking up all this cool shit."
"7079680","7081580"," And you'd be like, dude, this is fucking awesome. "
"7082440","7086580"," And so I did that and I'm like eating the chow haul and I'm getting down and I'm eating."
"7087700","7088720"," I did that for a few days."
"7088780","7092020"," And then I forget exactly what happened. "
"7092260","7096240"," But the, whatever the, I forget what they're called now, technical sergeant or whatever in the air"
"7096240","7096420"," force."
"7096420","7097740"," It's been a long fucking time."
"7097940","7099920"," Because you got to remember ranks of other services. "
"7100220","7104460"," I think it was a technical sergeant was running the DFAC."
"7104820","7108960"," And I was all stoked and I was bringing my friends to this DFAC."
"7109080","7110740"," And I'm like, dude, you guys got to eat in here. "
"7110820","7111340"," It's awesome."
"7111720","7113740"," And he noticed me coming in with my friends."
"7115200","7117660"," And I was there like the second or third day. "
"7118440","7120180"," And I'm pointing out all these cooking stations."
"7120180","7121700"," And I'm like, you got to get this and you got to get that."
"7122660","7124920"," And the technical sergeant said something to me. "
"7124920","7127760"," He's like, he's like, he's like, he's like soldier."
"7127980","7128960"," You don't want to be eating this shit."
"7129080","7129940"," And I'm like, what do you mean?"
"7131760","7133600"," And he's like, I kid you not. "
"7133720","7137320"," He's like, he's like, he's like, where do you think all this fucking food comes from?"
"7138220","7139740"," And I was like, I have no idea."
"7140080","7143440"," He's like right outside the, he's like, that chick comes from right outside the wire out there."
"7144620","7145620"," And I was like, huh?"
"7146400","7147320"," And it didn't hit me. "
"7148840","7150200"," It didn't, it didn't hit me."
"7150500","7152320"," So I ate all my buddies are eating."
"7152320","7152900"," We're wondering. "
"7153900","7156740"," And one morning, we're leaving our compound."
"7158040","7163960"," And this is like a first air cav around the perimeter."
"7164340","7165560"," So you guys know, you guys might not know. "
"7165660","7167060"," It's like, I don't know what it is today."
"7167180","7173800"," But that time it was first air cav providing security around OSAN Air Force Base."
"7173980","7176320"," I don't know if first air cav is still there or not. "
"7177520","7181240"," No, it was air cavalry still outside of OSAN Air Force Base."
"7181440","7183080"," Can anybody confirm or deny that?"
"7183460","7184480"," But that time it was."
"7184700","7186160"," So we're on this. "
"7186880","7189540"," We're in this compound and we leave the compound one morning."
"7190080","7192000"," And I get into a doos and app."
"7193500","7196180"," And every morning we drive around the perimeter of this base. "
"7197140","7200880"," And we'd be going to Chow Hall and stuff and there was a little truck."
"7202560","7205980"," There's a little like a food truck to drive around that, that perimeter."
"7206560","7208980"," And it had a little handwritten sign on it. "
"7209940","7211420"," That said, Dunkin Donuts."
"7212160","7215160"," And the first time you see that sign, you go running towards that truck."
"7216160","7220740"," So you get some Dunkin Donuts and then the guy in that truck would didn't have Dunkin Donuts. "
"7221420","7226360"," And the first time you go to that truck, the guy will tell you'll say, American told me to put"
"7226360","7228020"," that sign on this truck that you'd come running."
"7228740","7231760"," And fuck yeah, I did, but they didn't have Dunkin Donuts."
"7232300","7235160"," So anyways, we'd drive around the outside of this perimeter every morning to get Chow. "
"7237300","7246060"," And every day we'd see a honey wagon come to our"
"7246060","7250260"," compound and pump out our shitters."
"7251260","7254880"," And so they would pump out the shitters and leave."
"7254880","7258500"," It was a green painted shitty green looking truck with shitty paint on it. "
"7260220","7262500"," Some kind of a writing on it."
"7262580","7266600"," I can't remember what it said, but they would pump out our shit."
"7266920","7269320"," So one more and I'm heading to the defect. "
"7270840","7277120"," And I'm sitting in the back of the deuce and a half and I can see the deuce or the"
"7277120","7284480"," pumper truck that left our compound is driving our shit out to the rice patties."
"7286900","7290760"," The rice patties outside the base."
"7292200","7301120"," And I see the green trucks unloading our shit and piss in these rice fields. "
"7303700","7306220"," And it all started to make sense to me."
"7311400","7318240"," That these locals were pumping our shit, pumping that shit into the rice fields and then feeding us"
"7318240","7318740"," that rice."
"7319800","7323660"," And the soldiers that I knew were pigs, like they were disgusting. "
"7324960","7331120"," Like they would pay for things outside of the base that were gross."
"7331600","7332500"," I didn't, but they did."
"7333720","7336280"," They were all walking disease carry and disgusting. "
"7338140","7338620"," Disgusting."
"7338760","7340140"," A little bit of blood here in the SP 500."
"7341500","7343500"," We are getting some rejection to the upside. "
"7343900","7347900"," We have a four trigger cluster on SPX bearish."
"7348360","7357600"," We've got the one, the five, the half hour and the daily targeting the downside move on SPX to 433 "
"7357600","7364490",".067. Here's S1 right here on SPY."
"7365110","7368070"," So if you are bearish, this is your time to shine. "
"7369470","7372590"," We've got the weekly trigger to the downside down here on SPY."
"7374050","7375670"," It's looking pretty fucking bearish here."
"7375850","7382950"," But when I figured out at that point was that that technical sergeant or that, what was that"
"7382950","7388490"," sergeant what was basically telling me that don't eat the rice in these stations because it all"
"7388490","7393390"," comes from the shit piles that you soldiers are making outside the base. "
"7394070","7402810"," And I had a hard time eating rice from that point forward for a few years, like three"
"7402810","7412930"," to"
"7412930","7414390"," five minutes."
"7414390","7416790"," Yeah, the honey shatters were full."
"7421350","7427290"," So we've got 25 minutes until the minutes are released watching some weakness in the S&P 500. "
"7427790","7433090"," You're likely going to assign that weakness to awaiting the FOMC minutes."
"7433810","7435270"," I don't assign it to that."
"7435290","7441370"," I'm actually looking for that weakness and I'm waiting for the cross of the hourly trigger over on"
"7441370","7441890"," SPX. "
"7443570","7445390"," So yeah, I stopped eating rice."
"7445710","7448030"," I stopped eating that shit out of that defect."
"7450530","7453350"," Is anybody watching the extreme ex-military?"
"7453810","7454070"," Anybody?"
"7454230","7459070"," Is there a single solitary veteran that understands these concepts that I'm talking about right"
"7459070","7459370"," now?"
"7459410","7460290"," Am I the only guy in here?"
"7460750","7461330"," Women, men?"
"7461750","7462010"," I don't know. "
"7465110","7466070"," Anybody out there?"
"7466070","7473890"," Oh, you live 30 miles in the biggest nuclear base in Western Europe."
"7474150","7475610"," Pretty sure I'm toast before I know it."
"7477210","7479050"," Yeah, you probably are. "
"7481520","7482780"," Just puck her up right."
"7482940","7483640"," Hold your ass cheeks."
"7486560","7487040"," Spoons. "
"7487380","7488400"," Very weak right now."
"7488520","7491580"," This is the SPX chart that you're seeing in the left-hand side."
"7491820","7492900"," There is no support here. "
"7493100","7496680"," So even though ES is showing the support, there is none."
"7497580","7499000"," There is no support here."
"7499000","7502420"," ES is showing some support here, but this looks more like a rug pull to me. "
"7504820","7510420"," So we'll see if this is setting up dip buyers here for more lows to come."
"7511320","7518800"," It's not showing up here in ES, but we'll keep an open opinion here."
"7522240","7530900"," In less than a half an hour until the minutes drop, we will be live with the interpretation of"
"7530900","7531280"," those minutes. "
"7532300","7534720"," There's anything worth paying attention to."
"7541180","7543440"," Okay, so you got a Navy vet in the house."
"7543760","7545200"," I got a cool story for you too. "
"7545280","7545740"," It was a Navy vet."
"7546020","7553080"," I was reading a story recently where they were talking about a story with a comment section."
"7553500","7560060"," It was funny because all these kids were like, there's no alcohol consumption in the Navy, but I'm"
"7560060","7560860"," like, that's not true. "
"7560860","7568520"," I was like, these fucking, they were like, they stopped giving Russians of liquor to Navy to"
"7568520","7568940"," sailors."
"7569140","7575220"," And I'm like, yeah, that might be true, but they still keep, they still keep booze on board for"
"7575220","7579680"," skippers and boats."
"7580000","7581900"," And then they're like, sailors don't get any alcohol. "
"7582480","7583960"," And I'm like, they make alcohol."
"7584720","7586640"," I was like, I know for a fact they make alcohol."
"7590600","7595320"," You guys used to also use, you guys, if you're a Navy guy, you used to also use a cleaning"
"7595320","7595980"," fluid, right?"
"7598540","7600120"," Back in the day, you used cleaning fluid. "
"7600260","7601740"," You used to drink that shit or something."
"7602100","7603020"," I was told that too."
"7604320","7605800"," But I got family members in the Navy. "
"7605940","7607860"," They said they would make booze out of bread."
"7608580","7615360"," We'd take a loaf of bread and pour sugar and water and some fruits and shit like that until like"
"7615360","7618740"," the middle of a bread loaf and they would make, they would make pooch moonshine."
"7619560","7621320"," Is that still true in the Navy or not?"
"7621460","7622260"," I want an answer to that. "
"7628770","7630070"," Yeah, drinking was very common."
"7630590","7631690"," I learned how to drink in the Army."
"7632210","7634970"," The Army taught, I was never a drinker and the Army taught me how to drink. "
"7636230","7636590"," 100%."
"7641550","7642670"," Oh, you're in the German Navy."
"7642890","7642970"," Okay. "
"7644390","7647170"," I think France and let me know this."
"7647350","7649810"," I think Germany is famous for having a bar, right?"
"7650290","7651590"," Don't you have a boat with a bar on it?"
"7652410","7659030"," France or Germany is famous for having bars on their boats, like literally like a, like a bar."
"7659950","7661230"," Is that still the case or no?"
"7662890","7663710"," Hey, Fotron. "
"7664010","7664310"," How are you?"
"7664550","7665310"," Fotron Alpine?"
"7666130","7666450"," How are you, brother?"
"7667630","7669090"," What happens below next day is below back?"
"7669970","7671050"," Seeing the master."
"7672790","7674710"," Yeah, years ago, I think I saw the master."
"7679240","7680520"," 45 days with no port. "
"7680640","7681200"," We have a bear day."
"7681440","7681640"," Okay."
"7681780","7682120"," Roger that. "
"7685910","7689490"," So there is still some, they'll still give you like a half cup of bear, a cup of bear or"
"7689490","7690010"," something like that."
"7693050","7694070"," Oh, what up, Dave G?"
"7695170","7695910"," What's up, brother?"
"7704540","7706780"," Kennedy spoke on, uh, secret societies."
"7707860","7710300"," Seems obvious that Israel used this talk about Gaza Strip again. "
"7715030","7715930"," What else we got here?"
"7717550","7720930"," What do I think US farmers use for fertilizer?"
"7721710","7726010"," I think that we use human waste."
"7727090","7731770"," So as I've gotten older, I've realized that we use human waste, but I think that it's processed."
"7734170","7739770"," I think the processing is better in the US than the processing that I saw there. "
"7740330","7746510"," The White House is Kirby says the US is to send additional arms and aid or more controls on"
"7746510","7747750"," processing that waste."
"7750550","7752550"," Weakness right now in S&P 500."
"7755330","7756530"," Waiting the minutes. "
"7768670","7769750"," What else we got there?"
"7773840","7776720"," Maybe some of you guys are saying I got to refresh this chat here."
"7779000","7781560"," Two bears, selthers or something like that."
"7783120","7786680"," Find which you find out what the feed the pigs or other white meat. "
"7786680","7786980"," Yeah."
"7790500","7795040"," I had a friend that had that raised pigs."
"7795480","7796340"," I buy pigs from. "
"7797000","7803960"," He, uh, we would roast these pigs and he would do the, um, uh, he would raise them."
"7804300","7807160"," And guess how he gets what he did for the pigs that he raised."
"7808240","7813060"," He would, um, he had three duck and donuts. "
"7813060","7818660"," He had three duck and donuts that he would go to and he left barrels out by their dumpster and"
"7818660","7820760"," they would load up the barrels with donuts."
"7821160","7822740"," And he fed donuts to his pigs."
"7825710","7827210"," They were fucking awesome, by the way. "
"7831170","7832890"," You use cow shit from dairies."
"7833650","7835390"," Uh, yeah, we have a ranch in our family."
"7836090","7839690"," Uh, we didn't use any human waste, but I know here in Detroit they do. "
"7840150","7849910"," I know Detroit does a lot of, um, Detroit has a very large, um, composting facility and they do"
"7849910","7851950"," use human waste in that facility."
"7857940","7860120"," Yeah, we didn't use them in, uh, in our ranch."
"7860160","7863020"," We never used, uh, human waste, but I know it is used. "
"7863440","7866040"," I know, I know human waste is still used to this day."
"7873860","7878800"," It's highly, highly, uh, Fermi's Parasox is a, I agree with you Fermi's Parasox."
"7879260","7886100"," It's highly regulated, uh, extremely right and highly processed by the time it gets even to the"
"7886100","7887920"," point of being used. "
"7888400","7893440"," Uh, when it gets removed from our wastewater treatment facilities, it goes through like a ton of"
"7893440","7895260"," processes that it finally gets to."
"7895820","7898900"," Um, those mixing, uh, facilities that they have."
"7901100","7903220"," Yeah, it's been used since the beginning of time, right?"
"7903900","7905060"," It's been used since the beginning of time. "
"7913520","7915360"," So Milligranet is Milwaukee's poop."
"7915660","7915780"," Yeah."
"7918630","7921790"," Dude, please tell me we, I'm hoping for these minutes to come out. "
"7922370","7926930"," And we get like a quick blood, like a blood bath straight down here and then it bounces."
"7929430","7938990"," If you are short or inputs right now, I'm going to not warn you, but say to you, as these"
"7938990","7945150"," minutes are released, if you do get that quick blood bath straight down to take the money and run"
"7945150","7946570"," on that bounce right there."
"7946810","7951230"," So if you do get that weakness, we blast down and then we immediately bounce. "
"7951530","7953050"," Don't be caught with your pants down."
"7953570","7957530"," Uh, look for these two targets to the downside."
"7961040","7964320"," If you are more bearish than that on these minutes. "
"7966380","7971940"," We're looking for that blast straight down and then some kind of rejection here."
"7972960","7976540"," I would re-enter the puts of the short right here if it rejects right there."
"7977160","7981660"," So like if you're in, if you're short right now or if you're inputs and you beat blast down, take"

"8151980","8153240"," I talked about that spaceman. "
"8161110","8163130"," Did I get your donation?"
"8164150","8165610"," Let me look right now spaceman."

"8274200","8281980"," So you can totally fuck with him and be like James, post a picture of that booze he bought you. "
"8281980","8285120"," Like go on Twitter and be like James Brock."
"8285320","8288340"," Say you're going to post a picture of that booze he bought yesterday or what?"
"8289180","8290219"," Like hold him the task."
"8306400","8311299"," The, so what you do is, so if you donate here, I want you to know that you donated to"
"8311299","8316620"," you, you are a part of donating to James Rowland, having a bottle of booze. "
"8316959","8319480"," So I haven't, I haven't razzled them about it yet."
"8319820","8322680"," He originally goes, no, no, no, no, I don't need any money for you."
"8322680","8323780"," And I'm like, no, no, it's not for me. "
"8323840","8324719"," I'm like, it's from all of us."
"8326139","8328719"," So I'd break his balls about it."
"8329400","8329980"," Not yet. "
"8330180","8333180"," You got to give him like a day or two, but I'd break his balls on Twitter."
"8333379","8334740"," Just be like, like James."
"8336780","8339180"," Like I'm, I'm a trade trigger crew. "
"8339340","8340360"," Did you buy yourself booze?"
"8344299","8345700"," We'll hold him the task for that."
"8346020","8347700"," I don't, I think he drinks tequila."
"8348299","8349980"," I think he drinks tequila, so. "
"8352219","8353920"," But fuck yeah, he's holding the task."
"8368570","8375150"," I think tequila makes his panties drop too."
"8376490","8377950"," I'm busting his ass right now. "
"8377969","8378990"," He's probably in stream watching."
"8379330","8381570"," And he's like, God damn you captain."
"8383170","8388730"," Ahead of the FOMC meeting minutes, markets will be on watch for any dovish hints in the minutes on"

"8404350","8408230"," Investors are also awaiting Thursday's consumer price index."
"8421390","8423930"," I'm long for 35 C's right now."
"8423930","8425090"," I'm going to try to trade this. "
"8426330","8428570"," This news release in the next nine minutes."
"8428570","8434570"," I probably shouldn't be long here because we're likely looking at something, some kind of goofy."
"8436630","8438170"," You know, something like this. "
"8439670","8441890"," Probably a little bit early buying these, but."
"8443170","8446310"," I did buy some some calls here."
"8446350","8450050"," So I've got a small position for 35 C."
"8454100","8460280"," Not a recommendation to follow me on this trade because there's likely a trap here, but if this is"
"8460280","8461320"," not your whole account. "
"8462600","8466400"," If this is, you know, you're not going to blow up your weekly."
"8466880","8468240"," If you're going to blow up your weekly."
"8470420","8472180"," Account by buying calls here. "
"8472340","8472780"," Don't do it."
"8478590","8481690"," There is risk of a reversal to the downside."
"8484010","8485630"," But I am long calls here. "
"8485810","8487550"," 152 eight minutes left."
"8497250","8498650"," Yeah, that was a great show."
"8499910","8500990"," You know, it doesn't. "
"8501130","8501930"," I want to say too."
"8503330","8506870"," James looked great on camera yesterday, but."
"8507950","8509670"," There's two things that are going to hit him. "
"8510250","8511550"," Well, there's three things that I wanted."
"8511790","8512410"," I haven't talked to him."
"8512590","8513710"," I have to call him back and I haven't yet. "
"8514410","8521310"," The first thing is he's probably, he might not agree to this, but he's probably in some kind of"
"8521310","8523870"," state of shock still."
"8527370","8530790"," And this will probably affect him one day down the road in the future."
"8531150","8531830"," Could be a month. "
"8532170","8537170"," We later a three months later or once he when you're in those situations like that, your, your mind"
"8537170","8537830"," and your body."
"8538770","8539730"," Will stay."
"8540790","8541890"," On a heightened. "
"8543250","8545350"," On a height in a heightened estate."
"8546750","8547990"," It's a really weird thing."
"8548210","8549570"," Like it's like a heightened state of awareness. "
"8550450","8552070"," Of the threat to your life."
"8552690","8553110"," So."
"8556630","8561530"," Winnie finally arrives back in the U.S. He'll likely have cathartic moments. "
"8564510","8569970"," And then some some rehabbing to do of some kind, even if nothing happens to him."
"8570990","8574470"," So there's likely going to be that effect towards him."
"8574730","8579050"," It has more to do with not being in control of your destiny than anything. "
"8579690","8581750"," You're at the mercy and the."
"8582790","8586290"," The mercy of outside forces and influences."
"8586990","8588410"," You're at the mercy of flight. "
"8588410","8591550"," You're at the mercy of being being able to leave the country."
"8592270","8594590"," And right now he doesn't have that agency, right?"
"8594850","8594890"," So."
"8596330","8598790"," He held up really well on that interview yesterday. "
"8599270","8601930"," I have real concern for him."
"8603830","8607310"," For his physical safety, but also concerned for him."
"8608290","8614570"," Well, once he gets home to the U.S. At 2 p.m. Eastern time, we get the FOMC meeting"
"8614570","8615110"," minutes. "
"8617990","8618430"," So."
"8619730","8621590"," What do I what do I have to say on that like."
"8623710","8625290"," He's in he looks great. "
"8626470","8628790"," He looks like he is on point two."
"8629890","8634370"," Which is never good because that means he's hyper aware of his surroundings."
"8634730","8636550"," He's hyper aware of the threats to his life. "
"8638470","8642410"," So I'd be interested to see what his reaction is when he gets back to the United States."
"8642410","8643950"," It can be really weird when you come back to."
"8646450","8647070"," Civilian environment. "
"8648910","8651570"," And some fascinating to see what that impact is."
"8652390","8654210"," On his psyche and stuff like that."
"8654470","8654690"," And then. "
"8656150","8657210"," I think he I think."
"8658070","8659510"," The longer he spends there."
"8661350","8662630"," The more risk he's at. "
"8663250","8666630"," So that's the last part that I gotta get to reach out to him and talk to him about that."
"8667730","8670010"," He should leave as soon as possible in my view."
"8670970","8671950"," The sooner the better. "
"8675500","8680340"," The longer that he stay is still in country in Israel, the more risk he's at."
"8680900","8684220"," The more risk he's he's he has coming towards him, so."
"8685720","8689960"," I'm going to send him another text message and signal and say get the fuck out of that country"
"8689960","8690460"," right now. "
"8691580","8693140"," You know he's not he's not a soldier."
"8694160","8695720"," So he's got no business being there."
"8696920","8698880"," You just get out as soon as you possibly can. "
"8698940","8700300"," You don't want to be in the way of any of that shit."
"8710220","8711360"," Yeah, he bought a jacket."
"8712180","8716060"," If he bought it by a flack or Kevlar vest or something like that some plate armor or something like"
"8716060","8716240"," that. "
"8717480","8718320"," That'd be good too."
"8720910","8722730"," I don't know that he can do that in another country."
"8722990","8723190"," So. "
"8724090","8727810"," If you some countries don't allow a lot of shit, some do some don't."
"8727910","8729510"," I don't know what the laws are in Israel."
"8729930","8733090"," I know like India has a lot of things you can't do. "
"8733750","8735670"," There's a lot of."
"8737550","8741090"," Southeast Asian countries that don't allow you to come in with like spare guns."
"8741390","8745330"," You're not allowed to come in with with sat phones any of that kind of stuff. "
"8746290","8751270"," I don't know what the rules are the laws are for visiting someone else's country."
"8752090","8754630"," I would assume that you visiting Israel."
"8754630","8756810"," You're not allowed access to a lot of that stuff. "
"8761040","8766220"," Let me know in the chat with your position here long short sitting on your hands waiting for a"
"8766220","8766700"," reversal."
"8766700","8772730"," Show that there."
"8777440","8779480"," There's the gamma flip to positive. "
"8780240","8782080"," I guess we'll make that green maybe."
"8795680","8796680"," James is a good guy."
"8796760","8797160"," I love James. "
"8797480","8799220"," He's like pretty close friends."
"8800740","8802280"," I don't know if you know that."
"8802820","8806500"," We're really good friends and we get along very well too. "
"8812860","8815080"," What was the ticker you guys when we look up earlier?"
"8815300","8816440"," Was it was an ADBE?"
"8817060","8818940"," Someone asked for me to look at a ticker."
"8819900","8823860"," Earlier in the chat who asked that ticker again and I'll look it up."
"8826740","8830220"," These short puts on ADBE and I'm short one spy one dates. "
"8831760","8835140"," Which would be like into a spread with and by calls with premium short."

"8847040","8852660"," About them owning the market here about one year remaining on the market and the short puts on on"
"8852660","8853420"," spoons as well. "
"8857850","8859250"," We look at Adobe really quick."
"8864640","8866120"," We look at NVACs as well."
"8866340","8883030"," I like"
"8883030","8884310"," the short on Adobe. "
"8890480","8891540"," Embarrassed on Adobe here."

"8899080","8900600"," Maybe 535 47."
"8901220","8904380"," Ten seconds here to find out if we get a bloodbath or not."
"8904560","8909260"," You can see the market on book map is going quiet. "
"8910100","8913260"," The liquidity leaving the market right now on the release of this news."
"8916530","8923210"," So Fed staff assumed GDP growth for the rest of 2023 would be damped a bit by UAW strike with"

"8925190","8930870"," Participants at the Fed's September 19th 20 policy meeting generally judged risks to achieving"
"8930870","8933810"," FOMC's goals had become more two sided. "
"8934190","8939870"," Those risks included longer lag effects from financial tightening, effects of union strikes,"
"8940410","8943730"," slowing global growth and continued weakness in commercial real estate."
"8944290","8949550"," Many participants saw continued downside risks to the economy and upside risks unemployment rate."
"8949550","8959130"," A lot of those the vast majority of participants continue to judge future"

"8977340","8978240"," unemployment trade."
"8979840","8986440"," So basically what they're telling you is old news on union strikes that are resolving themselves in"

"9018790","9024550"," Several participants commented that with policy rate at or near the peak decisions and"
"9024550","9029490"," communications should shift to how long rates stay restrictive versus how high they will rise. "
"9031390","9035210"," The call is slightly bullish about a completely bearish point."
"9035210","9040630"," It's like a mixed bag like the proceeding carefully and determining extent of additional"
"9040630","9041150"," tightening."
"9041770","9053620"," So the key"
"9053620","9056320"," points here that you need to pay attention to is that. "

"9673820","9677280"," White collar and blue collar automotive workers. "

"9737230","9739970"," I would discredit any of that conversation. "

"9748630","9751690"," That can be found in that Detroit subreddit. "
"9752950","9759550"," By people that are actually in the know about what's going on with those strikes."
"9760550","9765570"," So it's kind of hard to weed through the comments there but."
"9766550","9773090"," Because you'll see like a you'll see like a post about strikes and you'll get like 30 40 50 hundred"
"9773090","9773410"," comments. "
"9773890","9774970"," It's pretty good."
"9775570","9780510"," Then that that post will then move into like 100 or 200 or 300 or 400 comments."

"9801570","9802090"," Pages."
"9802810","9805010"," And so they go in and they they just post garbage."

"11213950","11216150"," Like, I don't want to talk about it."
"11216530","11219630"," But, you know, basically owning the market, selling puts against the market. "
"11220230","11221350"," That kind of stuff."
"11221770","11224350"," And like transitioning into like long term holding."

"11287330","11287990"," I don't think I have."
"11288730","11291090"," Those fights aren't all like in bars and shit."
"11291330","11292310"," A whole bunch of them are training. "
"11292530","11295930"," A whole bunch of them are in the army kind of stuff that you do."
"11296310","11297210"," Might be more than a hundred."
"11300050","11303530"," But it's not like street fighting hundreds, hundreds of street fights or anything like that. "
"11304110","11305030"," But like sanctioned fights."
"11306970","11309950"," You know, that kind of stuff too, or mixed in in that hundred number."
"11314290","11319130"," No joy so far down to 16 cents down down a couple pennies on my calls right now. "
"11319330","11320410"," I'm just going to leave them on."
"11320670","11321090"," See what happens."
"11321630","11323010"," I'm also going to roll to the downside. "

"11404840","11406880"," But then I came on stream and told you guys."
"11407100","11408280"," So you guys know at this point. "
"11408500","11408660"," So."
"11411760","11412500"," Spreads are weird."
"11413000","11413020"," Like. "
"11415840","11416980"," Spreads are a weird thing."
"11417220","11419160"," Like someone asked me on stream yesterday."
"11419440","11426700"," Why didn't you hold your call spreads into December or maybe until you get to 450 or something like"
"11426700","11426920"," that. "
"11426920","11427340"," So."
"11428920","11431520"," Depending on how I structure a spread."
"11433000","11435580"," I can usually expect to make. "
"11436140","11438320"," The baseline is I expect to make."
"11439860","11444380"," It's hard to explain 30 to 50% of the trade."
"11445940","11450920"," Now that 30 to 50% of the trade could be three times two times one time. "
"11451460","11453500"," The cost that I put into the trade."
"11453500","11455160"," So the trade could cost me."
"11455160","11457300"," Ready one dollar. "
"11457900","11459680"," And pay me one dollar."
"11460000","11461460"," Say I pay one dollar."
"11462000","11466660"," It gives me back two dollars because we had a dollar for the initial dollar I paid and then the"
"11466660","11469500"," extra dollar right so that's a 100% trade right. "
"11470880","11474320"," So I put a dollar in and it tells me I can make two dollars."
"11474980","11476960"," The dollar paid back in the dollar that I make."
"11478680","11482380"," And I can I exit at 30 to 50% of that trade. "
"11482380","11483520"," What do I make?"
"11483720","11485700"," I make 30 cents to 50 cents right."
"11486740","11487920"," If it plays a trade."
"11489020","11492740"," That is one dollar in and three dollars out. "
"11493660","11496180"," And I hold it to 30% of the trade."
"11496940","11501840"," I actually make a like not make but I make like a dollar right instead of the 30 cents does"
"11501840","11502260"," that make sense."
"11504540","11507180"," So instead of the 30 cents and the dollar I'm making. "
"11508480","11509280"," A dollar."
"11510380","11511340"," Excuse me one dollar."
"11511460","11513280"," So I'm a mix of words up here. "
"11513460","11515620"," So if it plays trade for a dollar for a dollar."
"11516120","11518780"," And I get out of 30% I'm going to make 30 cents right."
"11518900","11520980"," If it plays a trade for a dollar for three dollars. "
"11521480","11525720"," And I get out of 30 cents or excuse me 30% I'm going to make a dollar instead of"
"11525720","11526600"," that 30 cents right."
"11528500","11530420"," Now how these trades are structured."
"11532720","11535440"," There's a high probability if I'm right. "
"11537140","11538060"," This specific trade."
"11538740","11542020"," If I'm right in my in my calculations right."
"11542820","11546760"," I will likely make 30 let's say it was for a dollar. "
"11547160","11551540"," I would likely make a 30% of that trade to 50% of that trade."
"11552380","11554540"," In the beginning of the life of that trade."
"11555340","11558000"," I won't make the rest of that money. "
"11559240","11560980"," Until the end of the trade."
"11562880","11564260"," Every once in a while."
"11566000","11569860"," I may make all the money most of it early. "
"11570480","11574520"," That would mean that we hit like 450 in the next two or three weeks."
"11575260","11577420"," The beginning of the trade being placed two, three, four weeks."
"11579200","11579900"," That's not bad. "
"11580060","11580320"," That's good."
"11581180","11581780"," But it's rare."
"11582220","11583020"," It's not it's an outlier. "
"11583900","11584820"," It's not the usual."
"11586340","11588080"," Usually I'll make 30, 50%."
"11589400","11593180"," Second half of that 35% at the end of the life of the trade. "
"11594460","11596260"," Now the outliers would be."
"11598100","11602540"," I make the full 90% of the trade at some points in the beginning of the trade."
"11603160","11604960"," Or we reverse and go to the downside. "
"11606160","11609700"," And then I make the full trade back at the end of the life of the trade."
"11610680","11612340"," So that would mean that."
"11614220","11617500"," An outlier would be I go straight to like 90%. "
"11617500","11619160"," We rock it to the moon."
"11619820","11624200"," Or we reverse go down and I hold the trade and I'm losing the trade."
"11624920","11631060"," And it swoops up at the end of the life of the trade because I date them on the at"
"11631060","11631880"," the end of quarters. "
"11632680","11633660"," I date them at the end of months."
"11634400","11636000"," Month end and the quarter end."
"11636740","11638820"," Then they'll swoop up at the last moment and print. "
"11638820","11642560"," That's why oftentimes you hear me talk about parking the bus."
"11644020","11648460"," And they'll park the market where they print all these spreads that these banks have."
"11648960","11650200"," Up or down doesn't matter. "
"11650980","11651180"," So."
"11653060","11654580"," This trade specifically."
"11656680","11661260"," The question becomes to or comes to me as do I take the money and run right now. "
"11661880","11664380"," Or do I leave the trade on to hopefully print."
"11665060","11669640"," The upside target or the full print of that trade."
"11670500","11671100"," So. "
"11672500","11675660"," For me personally, I look at it like this."
"11678840","11685640"," I if I have to wait to get the 70 to 90 80 90% if I have to wait"
"11685640","11687600"," for that trade into December."
"11689540","11694480"," Or even weeks or whatever I can probably print make more trades. "
"11695920","11699360"," Again, that'll pay more than waiting that time period."
"11699820","11700360"," So."
"11701100","11705780"," In that time frame from from opening the trade until the end of the life of the trade. "
"11706260","11711700"," The expiration of those of those calls or puts or whatever the fuck you got you own or selling."
"11712060","11713900"," Excuse me, not just owning but buying and selling."
"11713900","11715420"," Whatever that trade is made up of. "
"11716140","11718360"," If I don't have to wait that full length of time."
"11718860","11721960"," If I get a pretty decent a pretty decent payout right here."
"11722360","11729440"," I can likely trade that same trade or similar trade two or three times and max maximize my profits. "
"11730600","11733440"," So this is this is more a function of time."
"11734660","11739340"," So I took the money yesterday and now I'm looking to place another one of those trades right now."
"11739360","11740220"," I'm looking to trade. "
"11741000","11745240"," For that four forty four place another trade and maximize that."
"11747320","11750140"," The money so what am I looking for."
"11751040","11752820"," To place that second trade. "
"11753880","11755200"," Between now and December."
"11756280","11758540"," I'm looking for a confirmation on the daily trigger."
"11759140","11762340"," From price right now we're getting it right now. "
"11762820","11765720"," So I'm looking to enter another call spread."
"11767260","11770840"," And probably four forty four fifty and."
"11771980","11774740"," Try to run that shit up one more time and then. "
"11775980","11780040"," Accident four forty four and sit on my hands again."
"11780840","11782240"," Take that trade twice."
"11784340","11787440"," Relatively short period of time and make a lot of money. "
"11790170","11792530"," I don't know if it makes up my words and how I'm wording."
"11792730","11795990"," I'm wording I'm I have a lot of mumbo jumbo and trying to express this."
"11796510","11798670"," I feel like I'm over complicating or. "
"11799590","11801030"," Saying too many things or."
"11803910","11807210"," Over complicating how you trade these these spreads and what I should have done."
"11807510","11808790"," I'm going to tell you what I should have done yesterday. "
"11809630","11810830"," I should have cut the fucking."
"11811190","11813430"," I should or I should have the bot calls."
"11813630","11815350"," I should have fucking sold those taking the money. "
"11815770","11819890"," I should have left the sold calls on there and then I should have fucking."
"11820810","11822110"," Looked for another entry."
"11823170","11824910"," On a call spread today tomorrow. "
"11825810","11828890"," Something like that even right now is a good place to enter a call spread."
"11829550","11830450"," Because we're above."
"11831910","11834990"," We're above right now currently we're sitting above the gamma flip. "
"11836170","11838450"," Of course I'm de-gen trading zero dates."
"11839370","11842690"," Trying to make some money right now instead of fucking placing a call spread here."
"11842930","11846970"," Which I should be put I should place a call spread right now and I haven't. "
"11848770","11850350"," Trade twenty three right now."
"11851810","11854730"," On four thirty sixes looking to hit the market hard and heavy."
"11859540","11863580"," Yeah there's a bunch of theta left in that and that's the that's the other side I should have"
"11863580","11864060"," mentioned that. "
"11864580","11869720"," So you make most of that you make most of your money on the backside of that trade on that"
"11869720","11872280"," call spread in theta in time decay."
"11873560","11880560"," If price doesn't scream higher like if price was to go like moonshot and like next week we're at"
"11880560","11882760"," like four fifty four sixty four seventy."
"11883700","11888380"," It wouldn't the theta wouldn't matter but the theta does matter over time. "
"11889080","11893320"," So I'd make most of them like if we'd like slowly ground up to four fifty into the end of"
"11893320","11893880"," the corner."
"11895080","11899440"," The theta would kick in at some point and start paying me massive amounts of money."
"11901380","11902920"," All right it makes sense you okay. "
"11905980","11908560"," What you know it would have been a good thing you know it would have been a good thing to"
"11908560","11908740"," do."
"11909420","11912420"," Good thing to do would have been to of we we should have done."
"11913140","11915860"," Is we should have bought a one call spread. "
"11916540","11920860"," Down at four eighteen we should have bought one December twenty ninth call spread."
"11921500","11924440"," And just leave it up on the live stream."
"11925600","11930000"," So that you can see the mechanics of how it goes up and down. "
"11930780","11936260"," You can see when you're getting paid or when you're not so you always want to be selling on a"
"11936260","11936780"," rip higher."
"11937580","11940560"," You always want you want the hell the theta works itself out like."
"11941240","11946180"," And I would recommend this to you if you're if you don't trade spreads and you're interested in it"
"11946180","11947960"," forget paper trade and just buy one. "
"11947960","11950100"," Like three month out."
"11950620","11957780"," I don't know call or put spread and just watch the actual mechanics as it unfolds over time."
"11958260","11960640"," Like where do you exit time wise when do you exit. "
"11962520","11969000"," Even if you're in the money when do you exit the time decay mechanics over time."
"11970340","11974160"," And then and then actually if we held that one call spread."
"11974160","11976740"," Right until December twenty ninth. "
"11977520","11980420"," To see the implications as we approach the."
"11981380","11982840"," As we approach the."
"11983520","11984660"," The end of quarter. "
"11985440","11990400"," Like right to like four like three fifty nine p.m. On December twenty ninth."
"11990880","11993880"," Just hold that's that one fucking spread so you can see."
"11994700","11996320"," The mechanics of it. "
"11996960","11998320"," In real time I guess."
"12004300","12006720"," Yeah like not just those markers but like."
"12007220","12011120"," How does delta impact how does theta impact how does price impact. "
"12011440","12013700"," How does like does it scream up."
"12015520","12021940"," But my most famous trade I have a famous but for me famous is an Amazon trade that I made."
"12022880","12026060"," And I got fucking hammered on it fucking hammered. "
"12027100","12028940"," It went to like fucking zero."
"12029300","12033400"," It was like it wasn't zero but it was worth like two hundred bucks or something."
"12033540","12034880"," I think it placed it for five. "
"12035580","12037780"," Five six seven eight thousand dollars somewhere in there."
"12038540","12040380"," And it went to like two hundred bucks."
"12041860","12044000"," And the last day. "
"12044480","12045600"," I mean it came up."
"12046720","12048640"," Heading into the last day of expiration but."
"12049460","12052600"," As the last day of expiration at the end of the month. "
"12052600","12057060"," As they're settling at eighty five dollars and eighty two a barrel down one dollar eighty three or"
"12057060","12058300"," two spot zero nine percent."
"12059260","12060820"," As it came down into the."
"12062660","12063940"," So as it. "
"12064240","12066340"," It was it started like this."
"12066960","12070660"," It's like I took on a quarterly trade on on Amazon right."
"12070900","12072860"," And I started right here and I was like that's cheap. "
"12074180","12076080"," I'm like that's super cheap."
"12078520","12081760"," And Amazon proceeded to fucking blast the depths of hell."
"12082160","12084180"," And this is like the the expiration. "
"12085980","12087020"," At the end of the quarter."
"12087980","12090140"," And it like it went to like two hundred bucks."
"12090820","12092220"," It was like this was 10. "
"12092320","12092620"," It was five."
"12092900","12095420"," Three member was five or eight but it."
"12096680","12099080"," Went down to like two hundred dollars. "
"12100100","12102060"," And they're like the right in the end of the quarter."
"12102100","12102620"," It just went."
"12105580","12108140"," And then right in the right in expiration day. "
"12109420","12111340"," I was at like ninety percent."
"12111640","12116420"," This is wrong here because it was like five K and then which like the nine thousand or something"
"12116420","12116880"," like that."
"12117360","12120820"," I guess it was it would be higher but you get the idea right. "
"12121100","12122820"," It was like it was like a five K."
"12123520","12126700"," And then it just started ripping up into expiration day."
"12127780","12130740"," And I ended up selling on expiration day."
"12131280","12135980"," Like right on expiration day and I made the almost the full trade. "
"12136460","12141740"," Like I got I think it took ninety percent from the theta burn from the price going up and all"
"12141740","12142240"," that kind of stuff."
"12143840","12147280"," So I guess that point here is if you're ever upside down in a spread."
"12150200","12151820"," Fucking diamond hand that shit right. "
"12152040","12156320"," Well not always but if you're like down like two hundred dollars just hold that shit to expiry."
"12156320","12158020"," Just don't fucking stop."
"12158140","12159820"," Don't hold it past expiry. "
"12160820","12165140"," But definitely fucking hold that shit like last goddamn minute."
"12165740","12170580"," Especially on like end of month and the quarter big big big expiration days."
"12177650","12178280"," Yeah yeah. "
"12180580","12186020"," Trade in twenty three cents right now on zero day calls degenerating it up on a Wednesday."
"12190330","12192250"," Market grinding higher right now."
"12201200","12202720"," Yeah we got CPI tomorrow. "
"12210530","12217530"," Yeah it's hard to it's hard to explain like the mechanics and the cool part about trade and spread."
"12218330","12222250"," If you don't if you don't understand the actual like feel like I read all the fake books and I"
"12222250","12227570"," watched all the videos and still understand it or paper traded it then it's still don't understand"
"12227570","12228310"," the mechanics of it."
"12228390","12233330"," Just go out there and fucking buy some sell something buy something and for like three months and"
"12233330","12237130"," just own it the entire time and watch the ups and downs of those spreads. "
"12238350","12241490"," And it's actually more helpful if they go against you."
"12242570","12248670"," My view is that they're that they actually help well I could be wrong there too because if they go"
"12248670","12253430"," with you you might not know to sell anyways so if you're like 90 90 or 100% of the"
"12253430","12254350"," trade I've been there too."
"12254350","12255690"," I forgot to take trades off. "
"12255810","12256390"," I've done that shit."
"12256630","12262610"," I fucking I've put trades on that they've gone to their max profit and I still didn't close them."
"12262670","12262930"," I forgot. "
"12263630","12265090"," I've forgotten to close trades."
"12265410","12266250"," I've done that shit too."
"12268190","12273990"," Well I got like I got stories of stupid stories of being stupid. "
"12274570","12279960"," I like diagonals too."
"12280420","12283400"," I like diagonals."
"12283540","12284460"," I'm a fan of diagonals. "
"12288300","12290580"," I've done all kinds of stupid shit."
"12293200","12298920"," What else two two other famous trades I made I made I made a I made a big trade on"
"12298920","12300540"," Apple and a big trade on Tesla once."
"12301540","12309300"," Actually did really well I did but I didn't do as good as I could have done so I took"
"12309300","12315380"," a trade on Apple once and a big trade giant fucking trade on their earnings. "
"12318760","12325080"," And I was up like 30% 40% leading in like weeks and weeks into into earnings."
"12325080","12331280"," I was up like 30 40% the fucking trade went red started bleeding pretty heavily."
"12331280","12337060"," A lot of money was like there was a lot of money in that trade started bleeding started bleeding"
"12337060","12339100"," and I was like why did I just take the money and run. "
"12339700","12341860"," I was like upside down now might as well stay in it."
"12341860","12343500"," This was not spread."
"12343720","12346480"," This was just raw dog and calls on Apple. "
"12348520","12349780"," We went negative."
"12350540","12352220"," I was like fucking I'm just going to stay in."
"12354280","12358280"," I got trapped and walked into those calls into their ER. "
"12359340","12360960"," So I was like well fucking I'm going to hold them into ER."
"12361200","12366360"," So I held into ER and that was the Apple split."
"12367720","12373920"," And I held through the ER I woke up not woke up but the day of the ER report and"
"12373920","12375260"," the announcement of the split. "
"12375800","12377360"," I panicked and didn't know what to do."
"12377700","12386380"," I woke up that morning I ended up selling for a bunch of it for like three to five hundred"
"12386380","12386920"," percent."
"12388080","12388880"," Panic sold. "
"12390040","12390980"," I left some on."
"12393840","12396060"," That trade came back to zero."
"12396060","12399200"," Like zero then shot up. "
"12402360","12404060"," Five six seven hundred percent."
"12405280","12408760"," I took the money and ran and now I was completely out."
"12410740","12415000"," And that was within like a day after the ER announcement one or two sessions. "
"12415940","12417140"," How did I held."
"12418180","12421780"," All those fucking calls for like the next week or two."
"12423060","12425940"," I would have made million dollars. "
"12426580","12427600"," About a million dollars."
"12428520","12431680"," What I mean about a million bucks in that trade and I should have stayed in it."
"12432100","12437060"," And I had I had different people I trust that were helping me to manage the trade. "
"12438640","12440600"," And I took the middle of the road answer."
"12440820","12443260"," I had some people saying exit and take the money and run."
"12443540","12450600"," I had people I trusted that said stay in the trader or as someone mentioned earlier in the chat"
"12450600","12451020"," here. "
"12453340","12457260"," Like take some off leave some on let him run hot and wild."
"12458440","12459680"," I didn't quite do that."
"12460640","12463020"," And I should have just fucking let those things run. "
"12463180","12465900"," I should have just like held him fucking held him for like a week or two."
"12467280","12468260"," And I didn't."
"12469880","12472600"," I ended up exiting made a lot of money, but. "
"12473920","12478560"," He made like hundred fifty thousand or two hundred thousand dollars or something insane."
"12479220","12482400"," On that trade, but it could have been a million fucking dollars."
"12482480","12485000"," It could have made a fucking damn so much goddamn money. "
"12485580","12488060"," That's all hindsight twenty twenty straight and right there guaranteed."
"12488740","12489520"," That's what it was."
"12495540","12500440"," I gave a lot of that money back to so that that trade specifically in another trade I took. "
"12500580","12503060"," I gave a lot of that back and I thought we were going to crash."
"12504280","12507400"," So I loaded up a bunch of puts and gave a lot of that shit back."
"12507680","12508340"," That doesn't matter. "
"12514720","12522040"," DTM is saying about December 29th calls at four twenty ish was wondering the same thing when I went"
"12522040","12522820"," to I unload them."
"12525020","12527880"," I would be unloading at that four forty four."
"12530480","12534780"," Like that four forty four four forty I might even load it four four zero. "
"12535420","12540140"," That's like the safe place to unload four four zero four four four four would be the high target."
"12540140","12543380"," Maybe four fifty would be the next extension up."
"12543700","12547120"," But I'd start it start like weaning it off at four forty. "
"12547480","12549280"," Leave some runners for four forty four."
"12549880","12554060"," And then maybe leave just a few few little runs for just in case we go to four fifty."
"12555520","12557000"," That'd be my answer to that. "
"12563250","12569390"," The health calls into the close I was smoked on ended up ripping into clothes made seventy K assume"
"12569390","12571650"," they expired in the money and had zero in the morning."
"12571650","12573430"," Because there are no team at the close."
"12573690","12582150"," Yeah I had a trade recently where I don't know remember this was recently to I had a trade where"
"12582150","12583610"," I think I bought it like sixteen. "
"12585570","12588090"," They went to like sixty or seventy cents."
"12589770","12591970"," I should take the money and run didn't this was into the bell."
"12592830","12595330"," They came back down to twenty seven cents I think. "
"12597130","12599470"," And I left them on into expiry."
"12601170","12603890"," And between four fifteen and six p.m. they assigned me."
"12605690","12610850"," They took they went to zero after four fifteen they went to fucking zero I had to call my broker"
"12610850","12611490"," and get the money. "
"12612390","12616030"," And it wasn't part of a spread strategy so I was like fuck you."
"12616690","12619890"," I was like giving my fucking money so they did the game of money so stoked."
"12623990","12627530"," Yeah I ripped up a desk once broke down desk to have done that. "
"12628330","12630070"," I've gone outside and cut wood."
"12630450","12631710"," I've done that before."
"12632350","12635450"," I used to have wood stoves I don't have many more but I used to have wood stoves to go"
"12635450","12636290"," outside and just chop wood. "
"12638590","12640890"," They don't have the ability to do either of those anymore."
"12643450","12644690"," Most made on a single trade."
"12646010","12647090"," Best trade I've ever made. "
"12647850","12655610"," I bought best trade my career hands down I thought I was going to get a knock on my door."
"12657770","12665970"," I for about three months I was afraid it was going to get a knock on the door from the"
"12665970","12667410"," SEC or FINRA."
"12667410","12677370"," I was watching CNBC and CNBC had thought"
"12677370","12684550"," a reporter thought that coming back up in a test this first point of resistance up here. "
"12684990","12688770"," If you're in zero-day calls this is probably not a bad place to take some money off right here"
"12688770","12691090"," because we're likely going to zigzag the whole way up."
"12692170","12695610"," I'm still long calls right here I'm not selling them I want to get that R2 to the upside."
"12697410","12699010"," Best trade I've ever made. "
"12700010","12709730"," I was watching CNBC a reporter thought that the hosts at the station"
"12709730","12719580"," desk knew that TikTok was in negotiations with Microsoft."
"12719580","12729200"," So the reporter was like the correspondent he's like he's like yeah he's like"
"12729200","12738020"," you know ever since the talk of the deal going through between Microsoft and Microsoft and TikTok"
"12738020","12740940"," and I had Microsoft open on my desk."
"12741940","12743680"," The option chain for Microsoft open. "
"12743680","12750880"," It was already open I was already thinking about taking a trade on Microsoft and the price of"
"12750880","12752640"," Microsoft was not good."
"12753780","12763740"," The zero-naked complex was terrible and the host of CNBC was like no no no no"
"12763740","12766200"," that's not public information yet just like that."
"12767200","12775920"," The cat was out of the bag live TV and I slammed the zero-naked call button for like five"
"12775920","12777520"," grand or something six grand. "
"12778200","12788160"," Like just slammed zero by zero dates and that trade went to its peak I think a hundred and sixty"
"12788160","12789900"," or a hundred and ninety thousand dollars."
"12791560","12796820"," I was trying to sell that hundred and sixty and it kept going up and I was trying to get"
"12796820","12799880"," out of the position and I couldn't close."
"12801920","12803500"," They wouldn't accept the close. "
"12804940","12807560"," It's too sorry it's too big a story."
"12809240","12814500"," So I'm trying to slam the sell button right and I couldn't get a close on the trade."
"12816120","12821760"," And I truthfully I'm assuming that there was someone in the background like it was a broker that"
"12821760","12823140"," was like fuck this guy. "
"12825940","12830620"," My broker a broker knew how much money I just ripped."
"12832280","12839180"," And Microsoft like went straight fucking north and I was like at the bottom on zero dates like"
"12839180","12842300"," thirty delta zero dates and they just started fucking ramming."
"12842300","12850660"," And so let's say I was trying to sell like one sixty and they were then going to one ninety"
"12850660","12851780"," they wouldn't accept it. "
"12852080","12860300"," So I started lowering my ask and I was asking for like a hundred and thirty thousand hundred twenty"
"12860300","12864420"," thousand and it's like rocketing up same time and then it turned around and started coming back"
"12864420","12864720"," down."
"12864720","12867600"," And I think I closed a hundred and twenty K."
"12868760","12871100"," They finally accepted my bid to get out."
"12871820","12876780"," That's the first and only time I've ever been in a trade where they were like fuck you asshole no. "
"12880560","12886060"," Or I think the broker or somebody was like if you go a little bit lower I have some room"
"12886060","12890360"," where I can make what I need to make and I can dump these these calls on somebody else."
"12890360","12891980"," There was something at play in the background."
"12892540","12893840"," They were like fuck you know. "
"12895260","12898820"," First time I ever had to lower my ask solo to get a fill."
"12899940","12901180"," And it was really panicky."
"12902400","12903720"," It was really crazy. "
"12904880","12906460"," I think I still have screenshots of the trade."
"12906800","12908560"," I think to this day I've kept those screenshots."
"12909700","12911380"," I could dig them out and try to find them. "
"12911620","12913240"," I think I have a record of that trade."
"12913660","12920880"," I think I even printed off or saved the actual structure of the trade as I bought into it and"
"12920880","12921720"," as I exited it."
"12921780","12923240"," I think I have it so I'll look for it. "
"12924740","12927460"," It's like five grand into two hundred K and about you ready for this?"
"12928020","12928740"," About a half an hour."
"12929940","12933180"," Five thousand to about a hundred and ninety thousand hundred sixty thousand about a half an hour."
"12934160","12935740"," That's a real that's a real fucking trade. "
"12935920","12938480"," I still think I have the data from that trade."
"12945350","12946090"," That's true story."
"12951850","12953250"," I'm reading DTM what you're saying. "
"12958040","12959080"," Whatever happened to that."
"12959240","12961500"," So we just we just did one of those trades this week."
"12961620","12966160"," So Richard Romero just asked whatever happened to the one thousand to one hundred thousand. "
"12966280","12971260"," I just placed one of those this past week within within five sessions ago."
"12971360","12972160"," I traded that."
"12973920","12978160"," So I did I did trade that make that trade this past week went public about it. "
"12978220","12978760"," Everybody heard it."
"12978860","12979620"," Everybody knows about it."
"12982140","12987480"," You had a prime opportunity to end to enter it as a matter of fact if you look at that"
"12987480","12988440"," trade when I placed it. "
"12988960","12993360"," Do you guys want to read the responses they might have deleted at this point their responses to"
"12993360","12994000"," that trade but."
"12994400","13000580"," I have a record on my D not DMS but notifications even though people deleted their comments."
"13001500","13005140"," On that trade I have a lot of deleted comments on that trade. "
"13007180","13013300"," Today the day that I made that trade though I think I had a 30 or 40 people say are"
"13013300","13014300"," you fucking out of your mind."
"13015500","13018380"," On that trade which yeah makes sense."
"13022620","13024300"," Spoons just parked right now. "
"13026560","13029640"," Fourteen cents on four thirty six still holding those calls."
"13030720","13035720"," They keep grinding me on these calls to the downside I've been up two or three times on these"
"13035720","13036020"," calls."
"13036700","13039400"," I'm going to hold these things in the end of the day see if they run it up. "
"13040740","13045380"," I'm not selling them trying to do the DJ and trade they've been up and down up and down up"
"13045380","13047380"," and down at this point dealers don't want to pay."
"13059430","13064110"," Yeah that was a wild that was a wild story and you know what was most wild about it is"
"13064110","13065490"," that my wife didn't believe me."
"13066310","13069810"," I had to show her that trade she didn't believe that trade at all she was like you're not either"
"13069810","13072270"," lying to me I'm like no let's go look at it right now. "
"13073210","13079070"," So we looked at it together I was able to pull down like the the files on it like you"
"13079070","13080750"," can like actually ask here."
"13080990","13087330"," You can actually contact your broker and they'll send you the details of your trading then you"
"13087330","13090350"," print it all out and go through it all and dissect it."
"13095580","13100020"," What if we close on the DT tomorrow get CPI pin tomorrow. "
"13101840","13106180"," I'm not focused on that right now if you scale up for a one or five minute chart."
"13107780","13109460"," We're consolidating for move higher so."
"13110920","13115680"," I'd be betting on that like pick your poison pick a poison for a low to buy and move on"
"13115680","13116080"," from there. "
"13120200","13124280"," Yeah they didn't believe me we spent a bunch of it too."
"13125120","13128740"," I went on a bunch of vacations and stuff that money is not as much money as you think it"
"13128740","13129020"," is."
"13129900","13133400"," Some of you guys out there think that's a lot of money it's not you make that money and you"
"13133400","13136240"," spend it you're like what do you want to do you want to get a vacation. "
"13136800","13140460"," You want to go blow some money and you'll end up blowing a bunch of it."
"13149090","13153350"," That's not mine already drank all that that's the cost that I got left over."
"13163400","13168140"," Well that's one thing so someone said I'll take lock over being right any day of the week go boys"
"13168140","13169040"," saying that right now. "
"13169580","13174260"," Well there's a truth to that if you're an account builder this is not financial advice."
"13175680","13181220"," I'm going to say state this right now this is not financial advice but I understand."
"13182920","13185720"," I understand someone trying to build an account. "
"13187220","13192000"," There are methods for someone to build an account some are more riskier than others."
"13192740","13198220"," I understand people out there that work a job like I go to a job I work all week long."
"13198220","13204680"," Pay all my bills I've got five hundred bucks or a thousand bucks or two thousand left over. "
"13205720","13208960"," And I'm either going to save that or just let it ride once a week."
"13209260","13214560"," I understand that because even if you blow that five hundred up or that thousand bucks up this"
"13214560","13216580"," you're likely at some point going to get a ringer."
"13217320","13222840"," And you're going to come out with like twenty five thousand twenty grand fifty K something like"
"13222840","13225940"," that on a ringer you might just be grinding. "
"13227160","13230580"," Over the course of weeks to make that trade where it's pure luck."
"13231480","13239660"," The one fault to that trade would be afterwards that you stay using that thesis or that trading"
"13239660","13240080"," program."
"13240900","13246140"," So if you like working a job and you finally hit it big on luck what do you do then. "
"13247220","13252280"," Like using that same trading strategy is not going to work like more than likely."
"13253400","13258280"," So when you once you do finally make that you probably need about fifty or sixty K."
"13259260","13260940"," To get out from underneath the."
"13262060","13263880"," To get out from underneath the. "
"13265640","13269100"," Where I go the college anymore like three strikes they give you."
"13273380","13276320"," The rules the rule the hand slapping that they give you."
"13286570","13287930"," Now I'm still on calls here. "
"13289670","13291310"," If we roll here we roll but."
"13294260","13298520"," I'm doing the the Mexican stand up with these fucking dealers these dealers suck balls man."
"13299860","13307640"," Yeah your P.D.T. To get out from underneath the P.D.T. I have a whole thought process"
"13307640","13310460"," on P.D.T.'s too P.D.T.'s to me are. "
"13312600","13315780"," They're for cause but they also teach you bad habits."
"13316540","13318380"," They keep you in trades you shouldn't be in."
"13319040","13321460"," The P.D.T. rules are good and bad they're meant to take all your money. "
"13322920","13330180"," I'm not a fan of P.D.T. I get the idea behind the P.D.T. the idea behind"
"13330180","13338640"," the P.D.T. is that you're supposed to only enter trades that are high probability winners."
"13338640","13340720"," So I get why they they have the rule."
"13341880","13344740"," But at the same time let's say you have a high probability winner. "
"13346680","13348840"," And it goes against you which it can."
"13351520","13357740"," Your psychology because of the P.D.T. makes you stay in the trade."
"13358600","13359120"," Does that make sense?"
"13360860","13361840"," Where you should be cutting. "
"13363380","13368420"," So there's like a there's like a face reason why P.D.T. is good for you."
"13369180","13373460"," It teaches you how to take only high probability trades but at the same token."
"13375100","13379420"," Because you're in P.D.T. you're like oh I'm not going to exit this trade because if I enter"
"13379420","13379900"," another one. "
"13380900","13383040"," I'm going to lose my privilege to trade."
"13384840","13389800"," So I feel like it's a double it's not on tondra but like a double edged sword."
"13389800","13394520"," Putin introduces mandatory FX sales for six months for companies according to media. "
"13395060","13398860"," And Putin's degree on mandatory FX sales will affect companies exports."
"13399480","13402860"," Do you guys understand the technology and the chemical industry."
"13404000","13410840"," So like you should also learn how to cut a trade that has a 80% probability of going your"
"13410840","13411180"," way. "
"13413140","13418680"," It reinforces you to the P.D.T.T. will reinforces you to stay in that trade."
"13418680","13424700"," Even if it becomes a loser that is bad that creates a."
"13426780","13433600"," That creates like a trading habits or patterns where you're like this trade should still work for"
"13433600","13433760"," me."
"13433760","13434640"," I'm going to stay in it. "
"13435960","13445060"," When if it goes against you you should cut that shit and reposition with a new thesis."
"13445060","13453930"," So yeah I get a cash account and I hold cash accounts I've got cash and"
"13453930","13456410"," that's another thing I only use."
"13465510","13466390"," Excuse me here. "
"13468010","13474010"," Cash account is great for zero date trading way better than a margin account like."
"13475510","13481970"," If you use margin she should be using on spreads but you should I would never I have in the"
"13481970","13484730"," past bought underlying stock on margin."
"13486050","13493570"," I'll never do it again ever ever ever ever margins bad man he shouldn't be trading with margin"
"13493570","13496470"," unless it's like spreads and shit. "
"13497590","13503050"," Other than that I'm not a fan of margin not even buying the underlying."
"13509810","13515130"," Yeah well there's another thing here too is there's a whole other aspect to this which is on the"
"13515130","13515910"," same topic."
"13516550","13520910"," Fermi's pair of socks as most of the rules around investing seem designed to punish retail anyways. "
"13522790","13526890"," Look at investing in private equity absolutely they didn't wait before you do."
"13527810","13530110"," So that's too risky but a lot of tickets are fine side."
"13530570","13533270"," There's some other offshoots of this. "
"13534430","13540290"," There was a leak I'm not going to say who allegedly there was a leak of a famous short seller"
"13540290","13542590"," that came out a few years ago."
"13543590","13552750"," They were leaking the text messages and email streams on one of these short sellers and publicly"
"13552750","13559050"," they look like they're rocket scientists and they explain this stuff to you like rocket scientists"
"13559050","13561970"," but then the background they were just buying fucking puts."
"13562350","13563530"," They're buying zero date fucking puts. "
"13564970","13570010"," So to think that hedge funds don't do that is a fucking false false false."
"13570510","13578030"," To think that short sellers don't maximize their gains by running with zero date calls or puts is"
"13578030","13578250"," false."
"13580110","13585790"," Another thing that happens is they'll say that dealers don't get involved in spy complex or funds"
"13585790","13586890"," don't get involved in spy. "
"13586890","13588390"," That's all false too."
"13589490","13592610"," Like the rise of retail zero date traders is bullshit."
"13593630","13597770"," That shit all comes from high frequency trading firms not from retailers. "
"13599510","13600870"," You're not calling."
"13601070","13605250"," I see some of these puts and calls come into the market and I'm like on spy specifically."
"13605970","13611210"," And I'm like there's no retailer calling up their broker and saying can I get a 360,000 zero date"
"13611210","13612790"," spy puts in the money right now today. "
"13612790","13614170"," That shouldn't happen."
"13614530","13615750"," That's a goddamn HFT."
"13616230","13617030"," That's what that is. "
"13617450","13618130"," It's not you and I."
"13631960","13633000"," Come on baby."
"13633960","13635320"," What are we doing here?"
"13635780","13637320"," Stop trying to burn all the fucking options."
"13638440","13640260"," I see the option burn right now. "
"13641420","13642720"," I'm fucking pissed here."
"13643500","13644580"," So these stay on to the bell."
"13645540","13647680"," Some at nine cents right now in a bunch of calls. "
"13647860","13649280"," I got a bunch, a hundred pack of calls."
"13649520","13652240"," They're cheap, but a hundred pack of calls are going to stay on to the bell."
"13652440","13659060"," So they stay on till fucking four p.m. Too low right now. "
"13659080","13659780"," So they just stay on."
"13661080","13665360"," I'm going to start to think about a call spread for four forty."
"13665740","13667480"," I'm going to look at some call spreads right now. "
"13667540","13668440"," We're going to start talking about them."
"13668520","13669040"," Hold on a second here."
"13671240","13672940"," They're going to grind this shit down. "
"13673360","13674180"," Give me a second here."
"13675200","13676560"," I'm going to set up a call spread."
"13685030","13688550"," Let's see if we can build something up here for a trade in the future. "
"13689570","13691070"," And I'll chart it out for you."
"13695700","13697160"," What you're looking for here."
"13697880","13698440"," One quick second. "
"13699420","13700220"," Log in down here."
"13707900","13708760"," What's going on here?"
"13708880","13709240"," Why am I not?"
"13710740","13712860"," I'm not able to get into my account right now."
"13712980","13714340"," I'm being blocked out of my account. "
"13715340","13725240"," I can't log in"
"13725240","13725680"," right now."
"13726680","13727640"," Did I get the boot?"
"13728780","13729300"," Nope."
"13729560","13729960"," I'm in now. "
"13733660","13735660"," Let's take a look at spoos."
"13737380","13737900"," Bullish."
"13740380","13742420"," Let's talk about spoos here. "
"13742640","13747280"," So let's look at a trigger screen here."
"13748280","13749560"," There's a 30 minute chart."
"13754520","13756780"," So just delete all this crap here. "
"13757900","13758800"," Move nine drawings."
"13760400","13762800"," You've got a almost near perfect setup here."
"13764380","13766660"," You can't get too much better than this. "
"13770260","13772460"," You can't get too much better than this."
"13772460","13773620"," This is what you're looking for."
"13773800","13776340"," So if you're a bull, this setup here is amazing. "
"13778560","13782880"," Now, can price come down and fuck you up?"
"13783080","13783300"," Sure."
"13784220","13785920"," If you get like a bad CPI."
"13790860","13791340"," Right. "
"13793360","13795460"," This is one of the benefits of a call spread."
"13795980","13799920"," So let's talk about time."
"13800660","13802440"," And then this is November right here. "
"13802780","13802860"," Okay."
"13802960","13803960"," It's November one right here."
"13804760","13806540"," So let's just talk about time. "
"13808260","13809620"," With a call spread here."
"13809900","13811160"," So let's say you're wrong."
"13811220","13812880"," Let's say we buy a call spread right now. "
"13813020","13813180"," Okay."
"13813880","13815520"," Let's say we enter call spreads here."
"13816240","13816680"," Right. "
"13817340","13820940"," One of the benefits of call spreads is if you were to just buy naked calls, not naked."
"13821140","13822240"," There's not really naked calls."
"13822760","13825520"," But if you bought calls, we own calls. "
"13826380","13828080"," I know such thing as naked calls, I don't think so."
"13828680","13833240"," If you bought calls here and the trade goes against you, you're going to see calls get repriced."
"13834600","13836040"," And you're going to lose your trade. "
"13836040","13836420"," Right."
"13837060","13838460"," It's not going to be as maximized."
"13838700","13842940"," If you bought a call spread and it goes against you, you've already predetermined. "
"13843220","13846980"," I want to enter here to make X amount of dollars here."
"13847260","13851520"," If we roll over and then up your, it stays the same."
"13851640","13852980"," You don't make anything more. "
"13853220","13854620"," You don't make anything less."
"13854940","13856500"," It's the same negotiate."
"13856640","13860420"," The same price that you negotiated here is the same price. "
"13860420","13862040"," You can expect if we go up here."
"13862260","13862700"," Does it make sense?"
"13864180","13869480"," So that's one of the benefits of a spread is if you get like, if you get some like volatility"
"13869480","13873320"," or anything like that, you're still in the good and you can stay right there."
"13873420","13874360"," Let's look at that right there. "
"13874540","13881700"," So your best trade here, your best call spread trade is likely something like this."
"13882540","13883260"," You see that?"
"13883580","13885060"," So you don't want to be buying that."
"13885160","13886140"," You don't want to be buying that. "
"13886220","13888400"," You want to be buying this and you want to be buying this right here."
"13888940","13890360"," And you're a little antsy right now."
"13890820","13896180"," You're like, hey cap, we might just start squeezing up here and then come back down. "
"13896600","13896640"," Right?"
"13897920","13903460"," And what, hey cap, we have bad CPI and it rolled down and then we come up there and trade"
"13903460","13903740"," that."
"13903900","13904000"," Right?"
"13904200","13909900"," So you want to expose yourself to the possibility of going up here and you want to protect yourself"
"13910420","13912900"," in case there is a role and then we go up there."
"13912980","13914700"," So this is kind of your target, isn't it?"
"13915880","13919120"," This right here is kind of your target that you're looking for for for the next call spread. "
"13919120","13922000"," And you're looking to go early on it, right?"
"13922700","13925500"," You're saying to me, cap, we likely don't roll down."
"13925700","13926840"," We're likely just going to go straight there."
"13927020","13931500"," But I'm aware of the risk to the downside move in spy. "
"13931880","13933540"," So let's look at that."
"13933800","13943720"," So we've got a target up here of at least that right there."
"13945040","13954740"," That's 443.22. 443.22. If you get an extension to the upside, you could be looking for this one"
"13954740","13955200"," right here. "
"13955800","13958520"," And this one right here."
"13959440","13969060"," That's 451.33, 449.10, 443.22. And you're going to consider to yourself"
"13969060","13971720"," how long it could take to get there."
"13972000","13975300"," So if you get rid of this one here. "
"13976680","13980180"," And you say to yourself, I don't know when we're going up here, cap."
"13981140","13983680"," But let's pretend I put the call spread on and we went down."
"13984800","13986880"," We have our first target here, right?"
"13987080","13988520"," Come back down, recheck that one. "
"13989240","13990060"," Then we do that one."
"13990700","13991920"," Then we do that one right there."
"13993440","13994700"," Something like this, right?"
"13996400","13998140"," And we're parked right here right now. "
"13998180","14000080"," So you take an in the money call spread."
"14000080","14010000"," And you can on your own decide what you"
"14010000","14010820"," how you want to get paid."
"14011080","14015380"," You can do just you can do a call spread that starts right here and ends right here. "
"14016640","14017040"," Right."
"14017260","14021640"," And you can look at the perspective of if we roll down and consolidate and then come up."
"14022040","14025820"," If we bloodbath down and then try to get back up here in the end of the corner. "
"14026500","14030060"," Or you're a little bit more aggressive and you're like, Oh, you know what?"
"14030060","14032980"," Up here, smash back down, get back above that."
"14033500","14035680"," And then start start getting these new highs up here."
"14035720","14039260"," Maybe you want more more ability to go higher. "
"14039520","14043920"," So what I would say if you're going to be conservative is you look for something that's a little"
"14043920","14044560"," bit more in the money."
"14044680","14051800"," Something that's more, you know, like something that's more like here and here."
"14052000","14054640"," So that's 443 and 435. "
"14056260","14057940"," So let's look at that spread and see what it says."
"14057940","14059940"," Let's put a December 29th on it."
"14060440","14061900"," And see what it's saying here. "
"14062040","14062840"," So I'm on 439."
"14064820","14068520"," I'm on a 430 excuse me, 420 29."
"14069080","14072580"," Call spreads 12 December 29th call spreads. "
"14076800","14078000"," It's a bullish trade."
"14078160","14081280"," I'm going to look at make it simple debit call spreads."
"14082060","14086180"," I'm using theta and not direction for the most of my money. "
"14086980","14088660"," Credit put spread would be."
"14090320","14091040"," Let's do it."
"14091100","14092140"," Let's do a debit call spread. "
"14092260","14092840"," Make it really simple."
"14093340","14094740"," Nice and simple."
"14095440","14096500"," We're going to edit this out. "
"14097280","14098540"," And we're going to look for."
"14100140","14101520"," 443 in the upside."
"14108760","14109860"," Save that strike. "
"14109880","14110980"," We're going to go 435."
"14114150","14115790"," And it doesn't pay that well."
"14116190","14117150"," It pays okay. "
"14117730","14122890"," It pays the risk is $474."
"14124190","14127010"," The payout is $326."
"14129270","14130990"," So let's take a look at. "
"14131150","14133090"," Let's see if we can do this out right here."
"14134470","14135410"," Get rid of that."
"14136070","14139690"," And I can tell you, but I can show you that. "
"14141130","14142450"," From right where we are."
"14143790","14146290"," As long as we trade this."
"14149420","14152860"," As long as we trade this right here by December 29th. "
"14154960","14156620"," I'm going to I can spend."
"14176110","14178330"," $474 to pay $326."
"14179090","14181050"," Now I get my 474 back. "
"14182210","14182650"," Okay."
"14183030","14183970"," Somebody might not know that."
"14184090","14186630"," I get my 474 back, but I make it on top of that. "
"14186630","14187590"," I make an extra 326."
"14187590","14191190"," And all I have to do."
"14191910","14195750"," Is get to somewhere in this range right here to make any kind of money. "
"14196350","14196810"," Okay."
"14197610","14200390"," So I can make some of that 326 in here."
"14200390","14202490"," Like I start making that money here like a dollar. "
"14203110","14207170"," $20 $100 $200 $300 $326."
"14208990","14210350"," We get up here at any point."
"14211130","14214150"," Now if we break above this right now. "
"14214150","14215910"," And start heading higher."
"14217470","14219490"," I'm going to max out that call spread."
"14220250","14221670"," I'll hit that 326. "
"14223670","14227110"," And I'm not going to make any extra money if we keep going higher."
"14227330","14229410"," I am I just get the 326 and that's it."
"14230010","14232890"," So if that's not a lot of money right 326. "
"14233930","14234830"," What else do."
"14235790","14236810"," What else do."
"14237750","14238770"," What else do. "
"14239310","14241650"," What do what what benefits a spread higher."
"14242330","14243010"," It's more risk."
"14243630","14245570"," So if I was to change this to this. "
"14246530","14248670"," Let's find out what this pays right here."
"14249270","14249750"," Right."
"14249970","14250990"," So we're not there yet. "
"14251710","14253530"," This right here is actually."
"14254310","14257530"," Going to pay me a ton more because I'm not in the money yet."
"14258270","14259130"," There's no expectation. "
"14260150","14263890"," There's no dealer premium in there and there's nobody buying calls yet."
"14263910","14266550"," They're going to they're going to give me a boost if we break above this here."
"14266550","14266810"," Right. "
"14268590","14269270"," Come on baby."
"14269470","14270670"," Come on back and make me some money."
"14271690","14273430"," So we're going to look at what that trade would do. "
"14273610","14274230"," So let's look at."
"14277050","14278010"," Let's do 440."
"14280970","14283310"," To 451 and see what that says. "
"14286010","14286650"," Hold on here."
"14287010","14288170"," I'm going to do 440."
"14290150","14291650"," A little bit of risk on. "
"14293110","14294550"," A little bit of fucking risk on."
"14294550","14296290"," And I'm going to go to 451."
"14297450","14300090"," Oh, should I fucked up the last one because I said 456. "
"14300670","14301370"," God damn it."
"14302250","14303010"," Pays even less."
"14303190","14304130"," I got the math wrong in that. "
"14304370","14305010"," God damn it."
"14305150","14305730"," Hold on a second here."
"14307670","14310650"," I had that I had that set to 456 already. "
"14310790","14310930"," So."
"14315280","14315980"," What did I say?"
"14316780","14318020"," 435 to 443."
"14319580","14322040"," Let me redo this one because I fucked this up. "
"14323020","14324340"," That was placed the wrong trade there."
"14324340","14324640"," 443."
"14325680","14326420"," Save the strike. "
"14326820","14327080"," Continue."
"14329440","14330400"," It's 476."
"14331280","14332780"," 476 now to pay 324. "
"14333520","14335480"," So there's already $2 gain on this right now."
"14336160","14336960"," So I did have that right."
"14337200","14338600"," Let me redo this one. "
"14338740","14339260"," So I had that right."
"14341600","14342080"," 452."
"14345650","14346690"," Save that strike. "
"14347870","14348310"," So 435."
"14353270","14365240"," 445 to 452 is going"
"14365240","14367460"," to 435 to 452."
"14369140","14371800"," Gives me almost 100% trade. "
"14372580","14374340"," It's not still not good."
"14374500","14376260"," I'm not happy with this yet either."
"14376580","14377840"," So this is 887. "
"14397280","14399240"," Let me see if I can draw this in."
"14401400","14402200"," As yellow."
"14409160","14410820"," And that's kind of what I'm looking for. "
"14410920","14411420"," Does that make sense?"
"14411860","14413280"," Now we can go up straight up."
"14413360","14415220"," We can go straight up here and start to sell."
"14415760","14415800"," Right?"
"14416940","14420580"," And I would start making money on this one right here. "
"14421200","14422460"," I would actually make money on both."
"14423440","14426320"," But I have to be aware of where this role likely is."
"14426520","14434140"," If I wanted to take this yellow trade, I'm more than likely my expectations would be that we roll"
"14434140","14437540"," up here, come back down and then do this right here. "
"14439400","14439840"," Right?"
"14440060","14441300"," So I have to make a decision in here."
"14441560","14442900"," I have to make a decision in here."
"14443220","14446080"," If I think a decision on this on this call spread. "
"14447580","14452220"," If I'm going to want to take the money and run or stay in for the length of the trade"
"14452220","14452900"," to get up there."
"14453520","14454080"," Does it make sense?"
"14454540","14455460"," I don't know if this is making sense."
"14455460","14459880"," If this is making sense or not making sense in the stream, let me know. "
"14460020","14462600"," And this is for, I guess I should change these out."
"14465920","14467900"," Maybe this should be white and that should be yellow."
"14475440","14479500"," And there should be another box drawn in here with some overlap. "
"14485230","14486570"," It's something like this."
"14489450","14490690"," And this should be yellow."
"14501340","14503620"," So let's start with yellow, right?"
"14503620","14505760"," So on yellow, hold on a second here. "
"14510300","14512700"," So on yellow, if we go up here, right?"
"14513040","14514540"," I can take the money and run, can't I?"
"14515160","14520300"," Or I stay in the trade and then I eventually get that part of the trade, Makes sense, yellow."
"14521200","14523360"," Also on yellow, we can blast down here."
"14524260","14531080"," And as long as we come back up and at least hit right here somewhere, I'll make some money by"
"14531080","14532100"," December 29th. "
"14532100","14535500"," If I take the white trade, right?"
"14537440","14538880"," Boom, I made my money."
"14538980","14539160"," I'm out."
"14539360","14540500"," Yeah, I'm out of here. "
"14540700","14541220"," Thank God."
"14541220","14541680"," Made my money."
"14541700","14542120"," I'm out of here. "
"14542220","14544780"," The other part though, the white trade could do."
"14545080","14549520"," We believe bloodbath down and I only need to get up here by December 29th."
"14549620","14550080"," Does that make sense?"
"14550940","14552040"," And boom, I'm making money again. "
"14552240","14558140"," So you see the stark difference in the stark difference in where you like, if you're in the yellow"
"14558140","14562940"," trade, you have an opportunity to take some money and run or you let it run out until the December"
"14562940","14570640"," 29th and make the full capture or you'd be more more conservative and take the white trade and"
"14570640","14575380"," you're in it for the 100% trade here or you're going to be in it for the end of"
"14575380","14577140"," the quarter for the 100% trade right there."
"14577180","14578500"," A little bit more safe in this one, right?"
"14579620","14584100"," A little more safer with this white trade right here, but the payout's not as good."
"14584100","14586280"," I didn't get rid of that. "
"14586820","14588900"," Trade $0.13 right now calls into the close."
"14589880","14591220"," $3.34 in the afternoon."
"14591560","14594300"," I'm going to give you guys an expectation for the rest of the week here. "
"14594960","14596520"," I'm going to delete all this stuff here."
"14596780","14600140"," So I did read off two call spreads for you."
"14600620","14602940"," This is a great setup, by the way. "
"14603000","14605920"," If you're a bull, this is the setup you want, right?"
"14607060","14613800"," Price came back down, found a bottom, price showed you we were going to get above the hourly or the"
"14613800","14614920"," weekly in the daily trigger."
"14615700","14618480"," Hourly trigger, not quite there yet, but it is beginning to cross."
"14618760","14626690"," Let's look at spy right now on a one minute trigger and you're always looking for these setups. "
"14626950","14630190"," You got the crossing of the early trigger above the daily."
"14631270","14634210"," You have the test of the hourly trigger on the daily."
"14634690","14636850"," You have price squeezing higher right now. "
"14636890","14638470"," I've told you in the past that I always prefer."
"14640390","14646530"," Instead of the squeeze, I always like the bounce, consolidate, consolidate, consolidate, then the"
"14646530","14650530"," then the ripper as the hourly trigger comes up to meet."
"14650910","14652770"," So this all looks good. "
"14653010","14657490"," Everything looks like it's positive for bulls where they are right now."
"14657490","14659170"," This is this is looks great."
"14659570","14660050"," It looks great. "
"14661490","14665510"," Can we blast down due to weak CPI possible?"
"14665510","14669810"," Do we have risk from Israel and Hamas?"
"14670390","14670770"," Fuck yeah."
"14671610","14676370"," So hedge appropriately also just have a general awareness."
"14676450","14684090"," If we place a call spread and we start rejecting underneath this weekly trigger and the daily rolls"
"14684090","14690150"," down, the hourly rolls down, get one more squeeze up to go down, exit appropriately that call"
"14690150","14690530"," spread. "
"14690530","14697110"," Leave your sold calls on on the call spread and get rid of the but calls up in here."
"14697730","14698150"," Right."
"14698490","14699690"," So that's that's the key pointers. "
"14700170","14701210"," Now you're in management mode."
"14701330","14705990"," If you place the call spread or do you want to stay in that call spread?"
"14706490","14707630"," You're like, just a fuck it."
"14707890","14708690"," We lost it. "
"14708750","14711550"," I'm just going to stay in until we come back into the end of the quarter to the upside."
"14715280","14716540"," These fuck I hate these."
"14716700","14719800"," I hate these fucking these fucking dealers can suck my balls, man. "
"14720320","14722100"," These dealers can lick my fucking nuts."
"14722340","14722720"," I'm serious."
"14727520","14729760"," Is any of this helping you out there?"
"14729940","14731540"," Did any of that explanation help?"
"14734400","14741520"," Please stop spending all my money for 10 a.m. All the good moves happen after 10 a.m. Did"
"14741520","14744240"," you guys, does that explain at all for you?"
"14745180","14747160"," The thesis here behind placing that trade. "
"14748200","14748640"," Yeah."
"14749980","14751400"," So the thesis it at least works for you."
"14751520","14756100"," So probably the safe now you're like, might be like, I only make $380 cap. "
"14756140","14756920"," It's not a ton of money."
"14757800","14764260"," I want you to think about how many cumulative 10 trades that you take."
"14764940","14766640"," I want to ask you this out there. "
"14767680","14771180"," If you if you I want you to look back at your last 10 trades."
"14772600","14777820"," I want you to cumulatively say, hey, I made."
"14778500","14779180"," I'm up 40%. "
"14780780","14784740"," I'm up 30 40% on my last 10 trades."
"14785400","14788160"," Now I'm not asking you that the guy that knows what they're doing out there."
"14788340","14789700"," So I want to hear you in the fucking chat. "
"14790700","14795120"," But if you're a new trader or a losing trader, I want you to tell me, did you make 30"
"14795120","14796660"," to 40% your last 10 trades?"
"14797280","14798460"," If the answer is no."
"14799480","14801320"," The answer is fuck, you know, right?"
"14801520","14805300"," And you're in you're the guy making fun of the 380 on 900."
"14806480","14807980"," I got a story for you. "
"14808600","14814480"," I bet if you stop trading and you just waited for these type of trades, you would have a much"
"14814480","14819840"," higher win percentage rather than trading zero dates in a stream or any of that kind of stuff."
"14820420","14822880"," And that's this is specifically how I make my money."
"14822880","14827880"," Like this is the way for an oversold bounces. "
"14829260","14831700"," This is the way that I fund myself."
"14832580","14838240"," This is the way that I'm always green is when we get into that really oversold territory."
"14840060","14844580"," Oh, yeah, boy, start squeezing. "
"14849180","14855890"," Squeezing spoos, spoos trading 435 75 right now."
"14856090","14857270"," I am green, baby."
"14858770","14861470"," Not a lot of green, but"
"14861470","14870130"," I am green. "
"14874330","14877150"," Smose squeezing into the bell right now."
"14880810","14890450"," If you are buying yourself some coal spreads right now, if you are placing those trades right now,"
"14891310","14900540"," congratulations, you are green trading 28 right now selling here."
"14902100","14903960"," Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"14910900","14912000"," I haven't sold that."
"14912240","14913340"," I'm still long."
"14913520","14915280"," Hold on six million to the five side. "
"14916740","14917380"," All right."
"14917540","14917820"," I'm on."
"14918260","14918340"," Okay. "
"14918920","14922220"," I'm taking around on stream right now showing off like a showboat on stream."
"14923580","14925160"," Don't want to be still voting on stream."
"14926520","14927260"," Look at that. "
"14927660","14928160"," Squeezing."
"14928580","14929000"," Spy."
"14941680","14945020"," Well, this be a cutting and repackaged. "
"14947000","14949220"," Binky might be here and be able to do that."
"14949480","14951260"," But Binky may not be here today."
"14951380","14951800"," I'll let him know. "
"14952220","14960240"," Binky had a, I don't know how much I can say, but Binky had a tragic loss in his family,"
"14960500","14964400"," a family of musicians this week."
"14964760","14972400"," Binky had a really tragic loss this week, so he may or may not be here in stream right now."
"14972620","14976140"," So I've been leaving him alone trying to give him some privacy. "
"14978340","14982180"," But I will say something to Binky at some point and see if he can pull that out."
"14984220","14985960"," Did any of you buy call spreads?"
"14986220","14986840"," That's my question."
"14997820","14999040"," Oh, Sam, you'll chop it up. "
"14999140","15000840"," For me, Sam has experience, too."
"15001060","15002280"," I still haven't hooked you guys."
"15002400","15003520"," I got to hook you guys up, by the way. "
"15004320","15010560"," Sam, I got to hook you in Binky up so that he can shift into that content maker role and"
"15010560","15012200"," get him out of the editing role."
"15012320","15013360"," The UN security counter."
"15013360","15014400"," I got to hook you guys up. "
"15014400","15017780"," I need to discuss Israel Garza conflict, according to diplomats."
"15019980","15021900"," Yeah, I'm out of DJN trades right now."
"15021900","15026160"," I could have made 50% but I was over here bullshitting and showboat. "
"15026160","15028100"," And so I'm out now and flat."
"15029040","15029380"," I'm good."
"15030620","15035720"," Yeah, yeah, if you know, Binky, he's going through a sponsored bite of a loss in his family free"
"15035720","15036000"," daily. "
"15036020","15040960"," I don't know how much I should say about this, but there is a signing up at to the tick"
"15040960","15041620"," dot com."
"15042220","15048580"," Friend was in a motorcycle accident and he made it and did then didn't make it."
"15049200","15054260"," As someone else that's going through some real tragedy right now is Joe Donut. "
"15055400","15064000"," Joe Donut, if you guys have or haven't seen him, he had a very close friend pass away this past"
"15064000","15064320"," week."
"15066700","15072220"," Unexpectedly, very unexpectedly, had a massive heart attack and did not make it."
"15072660","15079480"," As a family man, married young, married man with kids and they didn't make it. "
"15079800","15084840"," So they both are going through some real tragedy this week."
"15091100","15095000"," Yeah, so yeah, Binky is down and Joe Donut is down this week."
"15097320","15100340"," Creepy Crawley up the Wally right now into some supply to the upside. "
"15101060","15110360"," Yeah, both of those guys are,"
"15110480","15114860"," Binky and Joe Donut do a ton of shit in the background."
"15116340","15117980"," A ton of stuff you guys don't see."
"15118300","15123300"," Those guys are constantly working in the background to make sure that we're doing what we do here. "
"15123640","15130020"," So if you do see Binky out in the wild, if you see Joe Donut out in the wild, try"
"15130020","15134360"," to be patient with those guys that they're going through their own stuff right now."
"15134360","15139080"," So you can put this up here so you can see that."
"15139720","15141080"," Maybe you can see it right there. "
"15141960","15142760"," Maybe that helps."
"15143580","15146580"," It's coming into some resistance on the upside right now."
"15147060","15149680"," You want to be taking money as we come into that resistance into the close. "
"15150600","15153580"," We're trading $4.36.07. I'm going to give you guys a quick update for what to expect the rest"
"15153580","15153900"," of the week."
"15154860","15158240"," There isn't much left here for the rest of the week."
"15158400","15159280"," Rest of the week's almost over. "
"15159540","15162340"," So what are the key takeaways from today?"
"15162940","15165300"," We had a conversation this morning that's important."
"15166560","15169760"," Listen to me closely when I talk to you guys out there."
"15172100","15176000"," We have the weekly trigger down below here. "
"15176360","15180300"," Price is now above the hourly and the daily trigger."
"15181100","15182200"," We're making our way higher."
"15182800","15183980"," Higher, higher, higher, higher. "
"15184500","15188560"," A key takeaway from the conversation this morning is what?"
"15190000","15193720"," It is that it is going to take time."
"15195180","15200620"," For the Hamas Israeli situation war, whatever you want to call it."
"15201220","15201820"," Hamas. "
"15203840","15206120"," Israel war to unfold."
"15206880","15207980"," So listen closely."
"15208300","15212680"," These conversations we have have a lot to do with stuff that is not having yet. "
"15213420","15214920"," 17 million to the south side."
"15214920","15218980"," We've just encountered a gamma flip that's positive to the upside."
"15219780","15221120"," So we are positive. "
"15221620","15222640"," Congratulations bulls."
"15223780","15226900"," We are above the hourly trigger and the daily trigger."
"15227140","15228280"," Congratulations bulls. "
"15229060","15233040"," You've successfully at this point defended the hourly trigger."
"15233420","15234380"," Congratulations bulls."
"15235580","15238340"," What are the upside targets for bulls?"
"15239420","15240880"," We've got two more days left. "
"15241920","15243540"," And what else do you know about tomorrow?"
"15245940","15248420"," You know that we've got some CPI news coming out."
"15248680","15255100"," Even if we have bearish CPI news, you're likely going to be given some kind of an opportunity to"
"15255100","15256600"," buy the dip and head us higher."
"15257980","15264040"," So you should be positioning yourself for more upside to come even on negative news. "
"15264740","15267700"," What are the targets to the upside you may be asking next?"
"15268100","15268640"," Let's give them."
"15269500","15272020"," So currently bulls are in control of the market."
"15272020","15275840"," They have successfully retested their hourly and daily trigger. "
"15276040","15282180"," You're going to give the bulls some chance here to target"
"15282180","15291900"," R3 at 441 68 to 443 19 on spy."
"15292920","15293420"," Okay."
"15293580","15302040"," So the onus right now is on the bulls price and action is in the bottom of the market. "
"15302040","15304860"," You're going to have to have an attempt in a run up to that 444 by Friday."
"15304860","15311440"," And if not by Monday or Tuesday of next week, possibly even Wednesday to get pulled down on bad"
"15311440","15314760"," news to my parent and tag this 443."
"15315340","15318520"," So 443 at the latest Wednesday of next week. "
"15318840","15323760"," Friday is most definitely a possibility between now and Friday."
"15324060","15326980"," I would put some more time on that thesis though into next week."
"15328140","15330300"," Do bulls have a chance to go even higher?"
"15333420","15334480"," Yes, they do. "
"15335020","15338380"," So on an hourly chart, you can see the big trend shift here."
"15338880","15340160"," I want you to see it back here."
"15340280","15345340"," This is back on where we got one, one, two, three, four sessions ago. "
"15346080","15348660"," You have the hourly cross for trend for spoos."
"15349140","15354540"," And then the four hour trend on spoos, you got the cross coming into play with a successful defense"
"15354540","15356260"," right back in here."
"15356260","15360940"," Remember that 830 in the morning when I said to you, we got the bounce in pre-market. "
"15361200","15363640"," That's completely fucking crazy town bullish."
"15364500","15366940"," And we went up and I closed a bunch of spreads back here yesterday."
"15367580","15369180"," So you're looking for your next leg to the upside. "
"15369840","15371640"," So everything is completely bullish right now."
"15371680","15372920"," You've got this tag above here."
"15373560","15376140"," So what are we looking for for bulls here?"
"15376460","15386140"," We're looking for the target to the upside of 440, 440, 168, 443, 19. "
"15387120","15396700"," And then you're going to be looking for the target to the downside right to hold the hourly trigger"
"15396700","15399320"," and begin a run higher."
"15401060","15410020"," So right here into next week closing that gap to the upside into next week and possibly the week"
"15410020","15410380"," after."
"15412520","15414980"," Closing that one up right there, 450, 107. "
"15416480","15421540"," You got one, two, three, four, five, six sessions, maybe longer."
"15424020","15427660"," See if we can make it a little bit longer here."
"15428960","15431760"," Maybe next 10 sessions, 450, 170. "
"15432820","15434740"," I'm going to show you what you don't want to see."
"15435960","15439860"," And that is going to be the blast off up here."
"15439860","15444200"," And then the firm rejection and get underneath here to the downside. "
"15444940","15447520"," So if you're a seller, you're looking to sell this for $44."
"15448460","15451780"," Take your money and run after the daily trigger over here."
"15452640","15456420"," Take your money and run and then look for the rejection to enter another short to the downside. "
"15457000","15461720"," So for right now, bulls showing the upside target up here."
"15462860","15465280"," Onus is in the bulls court from now into Friday."
"15466020","15470360"," And maybe you could be granted some kind of a squeezing iron now. "
"15471020","15474180"," Going back to retest this prior high."
"15474340","15477280"," We're getting it right now as we speak and then we get this prior one back here."
"15477340","15479800"," We're trying to try to attack next. "
"15480300","15486180"," And let me give you one more thing here."
"15486260","15488020"," It's a smaller time frame."
"15490280","15492360"," You might see the rejection up here. "
"15493340","15494140"," Then the bounce."
"15494700","15501160"," That's your that's your CPI bullshit and then a continuation to the upside right there."
"15506650","15508270"," Does that help out any of you out there?"
"15510570","15511730"," Mark's on closing balance. "
"15511950","15513270"," Currently sitting at one spot seven."
"15513350","15513790"," Yeah, I agree."
"15513930","15514450"," But some prayers. "
"15514810","15516190"," Oh, this is cool."
"15516490","15516890"," Thank you."
"15518290","15518690"," Price. "
"15518850","15519690"," Squeeze and I are right now."
"15519810","15522250"," One spot seven billion to the buy side."
"15525490","15529190"," Yeah, one of the most one of the crazy things is. "
"15530070","15531390"," I think Binky's friend."
"15531430","15532670"," I'm like, yeah, motorcycle."
"15533410","15534810"," I used to own a motorcycle. "
"15535210","15537470"," There's some inherent fucking danger in that stuff."
"15538590","15542270"," The other guy, though, the other guy."
"15543350","15543870"," He. "
"15545510","15546310"," He was this."
"15546670","15547710"," I'm not going to some of this stuff."
"15547750","15549570"," I'm not going to say, but this other guy. "
"15550350","15550910"," He."
"15552590","15554010"," Didn't even see it coming in."
"15555070","15559550"," I'm not going to leave that to Joe to say how he was final stuff, but. "
"15560910","15565250"," That's not my fucking parade, but the other guy was completely unexpected."
"15566190","15568310"," Just hanging out in a Sunday afternoon."
"15569830","15575690"," He wasn't doing any kind of like a clearing snow or mowing the lawn or. "
"15576530","15578430"," Working on the gutters or."
"15580230","15583350"," Fixing a broken something that somebody broke or whatever."
"15584350","15586070"," Let's leave that up over here for you. "
"15588920","15590900"," So when you unexpectedly die like that."
"15591400","15593520"," That can't be that has to be."
"15593800","15595380"," But can you imagine being a young guy?"
"15595600","15597160"," You got a wife, kids are young woman. "
"15597220","15599140"," You got a husband and a bunch of kids."
"15600320","15601300"," And the biggest."
"15602080","15605980"," Fair you have 40 or 50 years old is. "
"15607060","15607560"," I don't know."
"15607720","15608340"," What are we doing tomorrow?"
"15608460","15609560"," What are we eating for dinner?"
"15611080","15612940"," Are we going to be at a trip on time?"
"15613180","15613620"," Are we going to?"
"15614040","15614740"," I don't know."
"15614840","15616000"," We're going to see the kids off today. "
"15616420","15617180"," And then boom."
"15617600","15618480"," Your whole world is just."
"15619760","15620200"," Done. "
"15621080","15622580"," All your hopes, dreams, plans."
"15624760","15625180"," That's how."
"15626380","15630040"," I guess I guess it begs the question of if you have loved ones. "
"15630440","15632560"," Mother, father, brother, sister, friend."
"15633600","15634060"," Co-worker."
"15638270","15639170"," It's a good. "
"15640190","15645730"," It's a good lesson for you to know that at the blink of an eye you could be gone or"
"15645730","15646810"," your loved one could be gone."
"15647590","15649230"," And to never ever."
"15649450","15651730"," Wherever you like leave a friend or a family member. "
"15652430","15654310"," Always tell them you love them, you know."
"15654650","15655850"," Never try not to leave."
"15657610","15664130"," I'm really like not saying goodbye to people or not saying you love them or expressing your love"
"15664130","15665150"," for the people in your life. "
"15665650","15668850"," Even if you're fighting, even if you're not in a good place with someone in your life, it's always"
"15668850","15669490"," good to say."
"15670010","15673030"," I want you to know that even though we don't get along right now that I love you, I care"
"15673030","15674270"," for you, you matter to me."
"15675030","15676570"," Those things really do matter in life. "
"15677150","15679610"," You lose somebody that's that close over something fucking trivial."
"15680430","15683730"," It'll shatter your whole existence so you didn't get to tell that person that you love them."
"15685010","15687110"," Maybe we end it with that today. "
"15687690","15693330"," With that hope that you don't leave your, especially people that you care about."
"15695610","15697110"," I go over Bitcoin really quick."
"15697130","15698390"," Yes, absolutely. "
"15698690","15699750"," Let's go over BTC, baby."
"15700350","15701610"," Mr. Singh, let's do it."
"15702870","15703630"," Trigger screen. "
"15706390","15706790"," BTC."
"15707350","15708570"," You want the BTC to the dollar?"
"15714120","15714800"," Do you have it?"
"15714920","15715600"," We have wet one drawing."
"15716080","15716280"," Not many. "
"15719680","15721140"," BTC to the dollar."
"15723840","15726520"," I always love doing this shit because he come back and look at him."
"15729960","15734300"," Give me a second here and we'll look at it on a higher time frame first. "
"15736640","15738880"," So let's see, we can glean here."
"15747940","15751440"," You're not out of the woods yet on Bitcoin."
"15751960","15753180"," You're not out of the woods yet. "
"15757340","15759160"," There's an argument to be made."
"15760280","15761280"," Let me check this one."
"15766410","15768810"," It's a mixed bag on Bitcoin right now. "
"15781220","15786920"," Bitcoin is saying yes, you can go up here, but it's warning of more downside to come."
"15789280","15791960"," So this is my fear for the market here."
"15796450","15797650"," Yeah, there's a."
"15804200","15807920"," So what I'm going to tell you about Bitcoin here is Mr. Singh. "
"15808720","15810060"," I'm going to tell you Bitcoin here is this."
"15811300","15814340"," There's a good chance of you squeezing up and trading a."
"15816700","15817360"," 27."
"15818780","15820280"," 27 100 flat. "
"15822200","15828800"," You're going to get some volatility in between 27 100 and 26 90 22."
"15830320","15833980"," You likely have another move though coming to the upside to."
"15836300","15837500"," 27 808. "
"15838700","15840580"," I'm going to say something to you though, man."
"15841400","15851080"," Bitcoin is showing the real risk and potential from the war in Gaza in Israel."
"15852020","15854100"," You are not out of the woods yet. "
"15855840","15859080"," And you are below monthly monthly trigger."
"15859740","15866780"," So there's an acknowledgement in Bitcoin that you could be sold to the depths of hell."
"15868120","15869820"," So be hyper careful here. "
"15871280","15873420"," I'm going to say something else to you here."
"15873560","15873660"," Okay."
"15875100","15880940"," You're if you think it's going to get bullish, you're likely still going to reject that monthly"
"15880940","15883900"," trigger and consolidates before a move higher. "
"15887590","15895020"," So if you go up here and you reject until the crisis is over, that wouldn't surprise me."
"15895360","15902120"," And I would not get bullish on Bitcoin until you're above this level right here and consolidating."
"15902860","15905680"," So you need to not only see this, but you want to see that. "
"15907380","15915020"," And you can begin to get get get bullish on Bitcoin only after you get above this monthly trigger"
"15915020","15920240"," and you get the weekly, monthly and daily working for you here."
"15921040","15927020"," You need to get that working for you and you need to get this working for you."
"15928000","15930080"," There is an acknowledgement here. "
"15931680","15933040"," Mr. Singh, I'm bullish."
"15934140","15942600"," I'm bullish on Bitcoin with knowledge that there is real risk to the downside."
"15943100","15946600"," It's basically telling you you're not out of the woods yet. "
"15948780","15950500"," You want some upside targets, brother?"
"15952340","15959500"," Two nine or two six nine four point four seven to two six nine four seven point five five."
"15960500","15963740"," And twenty seven zero nine two."
"15964560","15965900"," We'll be able to lower than that. "
"15966640","15968240"," Twenty seven zero four three."
"15969980","15974620"," And some some some volatility in here, like straight volatility in the move higher."
"15981010","15982970"," We're going to stay in those goddamn calls. "
"15982970","15985030"," They're trading thirty nine cents right now."
"15985350","15986270"," Fuck me, dude."
"15986770","15991090"," Thirty nine cents on those calls, those spy calls. "
"15991890","15994910"," I accident way too early way too early."
"15996370","15997990"," Way way way way too early."
"15999250","15999770"," Spooze. "
"15999970","16001290"," If you are a bull, a bear."
"16001470","16001990"," I'm going to tell you something."
"16002150","16002950"," If you're a bear, okay. "
"16003910","16005970"," You have a confirmed bull cross here."
"16005970","16007190"," See this right here?"
"16007250","16009250"," I want it going to be get out of the way if you're a bull."
"16009790","16011350"," Do you see the bull plane right here?"
"16013050","16015230"," There's a bull plane on spy right now. "
"16015750","16017550"," You can see it's written right there."
"16017750","16018650"," So be very careful."
"16018870","16020530"," This has nothing to do with this. "
"16021630","16023530"," So be very careful if you're a bear."
"16023950","16027990"," You have a bull plane combined with long on spy."
"16028470","16030370"," I would get out of the fucking way if you're a bear. "
"16035730","16037350"," Get out of the fucking way if you're a bear."
"16037410","16040290"," I'm telling you that bull plane man is bad as a motherfucker."
"16041270","16046090"," Like if we're if we're if we're weak into tomorrow and that bull plane stays in effect. "
"16046450","16049830"," Expect every dip to be bought on spy."
"16050250","16053370"," So right now expect every dip on that hourly trigger to get bought."
"16060940","16062080"," Home on bike rider. "
"16062380","16064700"," So I wrote motorcycles when I was young."
"16065280","16069360"," I got I stopped riding a motorcycle because of the danger that it presented."
"16070440","16072040"," But I stayed mountain biking. "
"16072040","16075000"," That is how a mountain biking is dangerous as fuck too."
"16075460","16078880"," Like downhilling even with pads and helmets and shit is still hella dangerous."
