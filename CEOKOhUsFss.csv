"11660","12380"," All right."
"12680","13420"," Hopefully we're live."
"27900","28680"," All right. "
"33460","34380"," Good morning."
"34780","35060"," Yep."
"35240","35500"," Stogs. "
"35660","36080"," Good morning."
"36300","36500"," Omar."
"36840","37300"," Good morning. "
"37600","39240"," You guys get a live screen this morning, finally."
"39720","40500"," Screen is on."
"40800","41020"," Awesome. "
"41940","45060"," Let me get back real quick to the old one."
"54680","56400"," All right, we'll try that again."
"57240","57480"," Benny Mac. "
"57660","58000"," Good morning."
"58300","58600"," Omar."
"59020","59560"," Stonks Anonymous. "
"61140","61360"," Raptor."
"61360","61800"," Good morning."
"62580","64019"," Hope you guys can all hear me. "
"66560","68300"," Let's see if everybody's coming in now."
"70840","72680"," Hope everybody's got their morning coffee."
"73720","74660"," Good morning, Omar. "
"76140","76940"," Sound is on."
"77140","77340"," Excellent."
"78460","78800"," We're good to go. "
"79700","81600"," Hopefully everybody got this message."
"81900","82760"," Let's take a look here."
"82760","90190"," And see if everybody's got the message. "
"92110","99740"," All right."
"103780","105060"," Retweet this."
"106260","108780"," Under retweet. "
"110280","115480"," Second attempt."
"118860","120080"," We are live."
"122020","123040"," All this link. "
"132940","133620"," All right."
"133740","134240"," We should be good."
"138050","141350"," So we've got PPI coming up here in just a moment. "
"142130","142470"," Four minutes."
"142470","146750"," All right, everybody's here."
"147590","156330"," Good morning, Philip, Speed, Nate, Case, Benny Mac, Danny and Chaz, Philip, BG, Tati, James, Good"
"156330","158710"," morning, Charles, Raptor, Philip, Omar. "
"160050","163490"," Right on everybody starting to slowly squeeze in here this morning."
"164870","165870"," How y'all doing?"
"167550","169010"," I've been kind of a crazy few days."
"169410","170010"," I'll give you that. "
"170410","176130"," So this morning, well, let's take a look at a few things."
"178550","180390"," Let's just get a feel for the market."
"180550","181830"," So we've got PPI this morning. "
"182690","186870"," We also know that the FOMC begins their two day meeting."
"187610","197410"," Combinating on Wednesday with a 2 "
"197410","198930",".30 PM presser."
"200010","203850"," So you know that there'll be volatility added into the market. "
"204190","205890"," Let's go and scale out here a little bit."
"205890","210330"," And I want to show you guys something this morning."
"210330","215270"," If you guys have a few minutes before this number comes out here. "
"222640","226760"," So this morning, we've got PPI that is at 8.30 AM."
"227540","234400"," The expected is 0.5%. The forecast is 0.5%. So that's what we're looking for at 8 "
"234400","244160",".30. At 8.30, we can go down to the one day real quick and"
"244160","246440"," just see what the reaction is."
"247560","253120"," Previously, it was 0.6%. I'm not as concerned with the PPI number. "
"253280","258720"," I know a lot of you are because it can infer if the tapering becomes more aggressive."
"258720","262300"," For the month of December."
"263680","269440"," And it also it also infers more rate hikes in 2022. "
"270440","273560"," Or that's what the news is saying at least right."
"274080","277220"," You know, there's some other things that we don't we haven't talked about much in this channel."
"277340","285920"," And that is the mandate for the Fed to pump money into our system. "
"285920","292980"," I think it's called QT, but basically we're talking about tapering bond purchases."
"293400","296820"," We're talking about rate hikes."
"297340","303900"," No one likes rate hikes because these banks when they lend money, they make all their money on"
"303900","304300"," fees. "
"305960","308360"," So even you wouldn't even want to see the bank."
"308520","309620"," The banks aren't happy with this."
"310060","311460"," They want low rates as well. "
"311460","314280"," But then we've got stimulus money."
"314460","318960"," It's not quite stimulus, but we pump money into our economic system."
"319220","321440"," And we don't talk about that. "
"321560","327580"," So that would be one of the monkey wrenches that I'm looking for at the FOMC presser."
"328040","329620"," No one's spoken about that stuff."
"330220","335780"," I want to say there's still 5 trillion mandated to be pumped into our market. "
"335780","337700"," How was your dinner with your girl?"
"337880","338200"," Good morning."
"338420","338560"," Yeah."
"338960","339920"," Well, dinner was great. "
"340100","341160"," No, dinner wasn't great."
"342240","350140"," We were supposed to go to my daughter's favorite breakfast joint is it's that cheesecake factory."
"350980","352280"," And the place was packed. "
"352840","355920"," So we wound up getting cheesecake factory to go."
"356440","359080"," We had a small birthday party at home."
"359580","361840"," There's just too many people for us. "
"361840","366600"," I don't know if I can see all you guys here."
"367700","370800"," The tech needs money, low rates to borrow and build rockets and stuff."
"371000","371220"," That's right. "
"371220","371500"," Speed."
"373260","375740"," So I don't want to show you guys something this morning."
"376320","377020"," I'm going to show you. "
"377260","378940"," So this is the E.S. chart here."
"380220","383860"," I'm going to do a comparison."
"384560","386700"," I think this was on spot gamma. "
"387740","389980"," So we're going to do a comparison real quick."
"393430","394710"," We're going to do the RUT."
"395250","397490"," That's an orange and then we'll do NQ. "
"399330","401890"," And so this is the E.S. chart here."
"402630","406150"," And you can see that E.S. has been quite stable."
"407830","415010"," And has traded stable where single stocks have not traded stable. "
"415630","416810"," And this is where."
"417810","420850"," Some stock bulls are getting caught in the market."
"422530","429450"," And index bears are not getting the results that they want out of the spy, which is considered"
"429450","432210"," typically the easiest index to trade. "
"432710","438450"," Now what's interesting about this chart is you can see some of that violence that's more pronounced"
"438450","442090"," in NQ than it is in."
"442970","445170"," E.S. or the spy or SPX."
"445910","452450"," And the most volatile at this moment is the RUT RTY, the Russell 2000. "
"453350","457110"," You can see how amplified the moves have been."
"457850","458970"," And this morning."
"460330","464550"," The RUT or RTY is in negative gamma. "
"464890","467090"," It's in a very dangerous spot right now."
"467090","470110"," NQ is also in a very dangerous spot this morning."
"470950","473250"," I want you guys to understand that as we move forward. "
"473350","478210"," It's important for you to understand that the spy is still in positive gamma right now."
"478590","483290"," But it is starting to lean lower into negative gamma."
"483610","486450"," And it is tracking into negative gamma territory. "
"487070","489830"," So what does that mean as we lead into Wednesday?"
"489830","492750"," And that's really what we're looking for."
"493370","494310"," So this morning's talk."
"494490","500210"," I need to have a talk with you guys this morning about the market because here we go. "
"500370","501250"," So PPI is out."
"501550","507270"," I'm going to assume that the number came out high because the market is slightly selling off."
"507370","513230"," It looks like we're going to buy right here at 801 and then we're going to see what happens. "
"513230","516690"," So there shouldn't be a huge reaction this morning."
"516870","519330"," Even if it's negative it should be somewhat of a reaction."
"520130","523950"," Support this morning is at 4605. "
"524630","526730"," You guys need to know that number this morning."
"526730","527950"," It's important that you know that number."
"532640","533600"," Hold on here. "
"537180","542560"," So support this morning is 4615 resistance this morning is 4683."
"543200","544980"," I want you guys to understand that this morning."
"545920","549180"," So 4683 is right up in here. "
"550240","553020"," I want you to keep that number this morning."
"553100","555060"," It's important for you guys to see this number here."
"555620","560780"," And then it's important for you to see this 4650 as being support. "
"561220","565980"," So if we're breaking through support this morning we're looking for liquidity to come up."
"566160","568560"," And if they don't come up that we're going to continue to go down today."
"569420","571160"," But these are some key support. "
"571360","573020"," This is key resistance here."
"574800","575440"," 4683."
"576820","578320"," That's right where we are right here. "
"580600","583160"," 4650 is key support for today."
"583680","584980"," We're going to bring this out."
"586220","586840"," Let's see here. "
"591460","595280"," And 4640 is an important gamma level."
"596040","598380"," But in truth what you're really looking for."
"598380","602400"," And when I'm buying this market I'm looking for key support. "
"602500","604120"," That's 4600."
"605120","607980"," We would consider this area here to be a minor support."
"608580","610480"," Major support is at 4600. "
"610820","611880"," It's also a large burg."
"612480","614660"," I'll show you guys that on the volume profile."
"615700","617360"," And you can see us down below here. "
"618260","618760"," 4640."
"619000","620480"," You'll see the small node right here."
"620480","622280"," There should be that bump in the road. "
"623080","625780"," And then down below here you'll see this 45."
"626380","629480"," Today it's 457038."
"629900","632840"," And this node right here really begins at 4600. "
"633320","637080"," And this is if you're a bull where you want to be buying is down below here."
"637440","638780"," We can see that move above."
"639640","642440"," And we are in a B shape profile this morning. "
"642780","647380"," This is usually a start of this could also be a large letter B."
"647380","649060"," But it's a small letter B."
"649840","655420"," And this is the implication is that it's the beginning of a bearish move in the market."
"656840","658100"," I'm going to show you guys."
"659780","661140"," Let's look at IWM. "
"664700","667540"," See if I can get this up here."
"674400","675180"," Oh, you know what I'm disconnected."
"676600","677160"," Dang it. "
"677300","677620"," You know what?"
"677800","679300"," I'm going to switch off this one here."
"679920","682340"," Because I don't want to show you my password to log in."
"684020","689220"," At any rate, there's some things for you to understand this morning as we as we open the day. "
"689980","696140"," And well, first off, we're looking for liquidity right down below here at this 4640."
"697180","701560"," And this is a minor support for us heading into the open today."
"701980","705180"," You see where where where volatility is above. "
"706440","708500"," So today, let's say we pick up today."
"708560","709500"," We start to head higher."
"709920","715260"," You're going to be looking to sell out of your lungs at 468083. "
"716400","717420"," Keep that in mind."
"717900","718800"," But I need to talk to you guys."
"718940","720060"," I keep on saying this. "
"720320","722920"," I want to talk to you guys this morning about the upcoming Fed meeting."
"723600","733560"," And it is important for you to understand the risk that's in the market right now and what else can"
"733560","734240"," happen."
"737500","738380"," Hang tight here. "
"757600","761220"," So let's say we, let's say we head lower into FOMC."
"761400","762940"," So we've got today, we have tomorrow."
"763240","766740"," We had lower, let's say we head down to 4600 heading into FOMC. "
"767880","771720"," There is a lot of negative gamma and puts that are coming into the most."
"771840","776380"," So we've got all these puts that are expiring on the 17th and on the 31st."
"776380","779920"," And then we have more puts coming into the market. "
"780260","787900"," Short-dated hedging by retail, short-dated hedging by short-dated hedging by"
"787900","792940"," long-only hedge funds banks."
"793200","797700"," So we're adding and adding into this negative gamma heading into Wednesday."
"799640","804500"," That gamma should roll off once the news comes out from the FOMC. "
"804800","811840"," Most of the news we know, we know that, that J-POW is hawkish coming into this FOMC."
"812320","819160"," We know that even coming into this FOMC that he is thinking about accelerating the taper."
"820320","826300"," That he is wants to be aggressive in 2022 with rate hikes. "
"827860","836220"," If at any point at that press or something less aggressive is announced or just what we already"
"836220","840220"," know, the market shouldn't react too violently."
"841360","846960"," Now if he's uber hawkish, the market's going to react violently because he priced a lot of this"
"846960","847500"," stuff in."
"848660","852020"," So the big question is, what happens with all that volatility?"
"852720","854420"," What happens a lot of hedging?"
"855100","860280"," As that stuff starts to roll off, there's a fair chance of a violent move up. "
"861120","866400"," Unless banks and market participants re-hedge."
"866600","871260"," They have to re-hedge a huge move for the 17th."
"872220","876540"," So do we get this down move on Wednesday's everyone's question?"
"877800","882680"," These Elliott wave guys are talking about how we're going to hit 435, 395. "
"883500","885020"," The market doom is coming into play."
"885620","890600"," And some of that looks in the background in the mechanics of our market under the hood kind of"
"890600","890780"," stuff."
"891060","896660"," IWM, what I was showing you over here with IWM is, IWM is giving us that sign right now. "
"896760","898380"," We're at the bottom right now in IWM."
"898980","905820"," We bring up the IWM chart for you to just show you how volatile we are right now."
"906860","908940"," We're at a negative gamma down below here. "
"909960","913160"," This one here, 213 is not a number you want to see."
"913440","916260"," Anything below 218 here, this is negative gamma."
"916680","920040"," It really is searching for 205 at minimum down below. "
"920440","926500"," If we get there between now and Wednesday, it's not good."
"926800","929880"," It's not a pretty, what you're really looking for here."
"930780","931400"," We got the one year. "
"932160","939300"," You can see how low that is 205 and we're going to end up cliff diving below that to the"
"939300","945600"," first real or bottom is going to be 192 after that."
"945960","949760"," And then from there, it's almost clear skies down to 163."
"950240","955480"," This is that market crash situation that these Elliott wave guys are talking about. "
"955480","962220"," The events that would need to take place, the mechanics for that to take place all at once would"
"962220","964180"," be, you would know it."
"964460","965600"," You would know it that day."
"965920","973500"," As a matter of fact, this first sell off that we had back in November when we would have that"
"973500","974620"," cascading put flow. "
"975020","980680"," You would need to see double, triple that flow that we had back in November on FOMC."
"980680","990040"," And you might even see articles saying that's going to happen on the FOMC, during the FOMC presser"
"990040","992520"," or possibly into the weekend, Thursday, Friday."
"993140","998080"," And remarkably, you might actually see the market bounce back as we head into the following week,"
"998280","1004820"," Thursday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, only because of the expiration of hedging rolling off. "
"1005610","1008440"," So what do I infer from that?"
"1008760","1014960"," I'm inferring that the market can possibly make some violent moves down and up during this time"
"1014960","1015340"," period."
"1016160","1021980"," Now, you know in my videos that I've told you guys to, let's bring this down here."
"1024200","1032520"," You guys know in my videos that I've talked to you about cutting your longs loose back in October. "
"1032520","1042319"," I think I even pointed Apple, the stock Apple out specifically that PPI rises"
"1042319","1049680"," 0.08 versus expected 0.5 or 0.8 to 0.5, increase pyros 0.6. Yeah, that wasn't an"
"1049680","1050480"," expected number."
"1051960","1054080"," Here's that 4640 you want to captain."
"1054480","1054820"," That's right. "
"1055340","1056480"," I want 4640."
"1056700","1057680"," I want 4600."
"1058240","1064750"," Yeah, I love condors. "
"1065170","1065870"," I love flies."
"1066410","1070630"," And this past week's been great for butterflies and for condors."
"1070850","1074150"," Data gang really has been killing it, especially when they're wide. "
"1075870","1078750"," But I want to talk to, I want to finish to wrap this conversation up for you."
"1078790","1080030"," So let's just say we head into Wednesday."
"1080790","1083290"," We've talked in the past about cutting your longs loose. "
"1083590","1090070"," I even specifically noted Apple could scream to stupid highs that nobody's ever seen, but that"
"1090070","1092930"," doesn't mean that you stay long in this market as an investor."
"1093930","1096930"," You should not be long stock in this market."
"1097190","1098590"," We've said it ad nauseam. "
"1098830","1100230"," So most of you should be safe."
"1100830","1105510"," Now, if you say, well, I'm in for the long haul captain and I'm going to stick through this."
"1106210","1112890"," I would say to you at this point, do not panic as we head into FOMC. "
"1113670","1118750"," Even if we have a larger action down, it will be followed with an up."
"1118750","1124030"," We go down, we go up, even when we market crash."
"1125330","1128710"," For those violent moves down, there are typically violent moves in response. "
"1129190","1134310"," Now, if you're long this market in stock, the one thing I have to impress upon you is that you"
"1134310","1136870"," should have at this point taken on some hedging."
"1137750","1140990"," And I'm still going to recommend that between now and Wednesday."
"1141850","1145470"," And the best thing for a lot of you to do at this point, if you are not long this"
"1145470","1145770"," market. "
"1145770","1155510"," If you don't have the ability to trade the swings in the market quickly to maybe sit"
"1155510","1163930"," this one out, there's no reason you can't sit this one out and wait for FOMC to be over and"
"1163930","1167730"," for us to find either a bottom or a swing point to reenter."
"1167730","1170850"," And that's mostly what I want to tell you guys."
"1171130","1178390"," All you men, women out there, whatever you are, I want you guys to understand how dangerous the"
"1178390","1179610"," market is involved. "
"1179950","1185150"," Well, not dangerous, but the volatility mostly in the market the next two days."
"1185470","1186270"," We're at the end of the year."
"1186450","1189510"," If any of you are still alive in this market, that means you survived. "
"1189510","1190730"," It's a positive thing."
"1191990","1194170"," And you should congratulate yourself."
"1194170","1195530"," We've all made money. "
"1195530","1196690"," We've all done very well."
"1198530","1199590"," So crude's taking."
"1200930","1201850"," Take a look at this. "
"1204520","1205460"," Good morning, everybody."
"1206560","1208020"," Let's go to the start above."
"1208340","1208740"," Let's do it. "
"1208860","1210020"," How is dinner with the girl?"
"1210120","1210520"," I think it's great."
"1212240","1213520"," Yeah, PPI is higher."
"1213820","1214740"," You have to take from that. "
"1215520","1219700"," Or the news that you'll see this morning is that you guys see me in here."
"1220200","1221540"," Make sure you guys can see me."
"1225780","1226880"," Yeah, I'm live right now. "
"1227420","1228060"," Okay, we're good."
"1236570","1238690"," I'm going to give you guys some levels this morning."
"1253710","1255310"," Let's see if you guys can see me this morning. "
"1255310","1256430"," I don't even know if you can see me."
"1256750","1257790"," Oh, you guys can see me."
"1258070","1258610"," Awesome sauce. "
"1262480","1265620"," So 4,600 here should be hard support this morning."
"1266020","1269440"," I want you guys to understand that 4,600 numbers are a big one for you."
"1273160","1274680"," We're going to look at the queues real quick. "
"1276140","1279600"," And you see this negative gamma flip that we have here."
"1281000","1284060"," This is not a good sign for tech this morning."
"1284700","1288400"," The next stop below the next gamma wall below is 3 79. "
"1290100","1291540"," This could end up pushing."
"1302150","1303870"," Put some supports in here."
"1307990","1309830"," You know, tech could have an ugly day today. "
"1310010","1312030"," We're going to look for a bounce this morning though off."
"1312770","1314690"," Three 87 44."
"1315850","1317610"," Breaking below this 390. "
"1318710","1322430"," If you are a tech bull, this is not good for you."
"1324710","1325810"," That's a good IWM."
"1325810","1333170"," And we were already in negative gamma yesterday on tech bull. "
"1333310","1335230"," That's two 18 was not a good look for."
"1335890","1338750"," IWM two 13 should be hard support for IWM this morning."
"1339090","1344430"," And you'll will be looking for a move lower at some point, possibly into OPEC. "
"1344630","1345230"," See even 205."
"1346370","1349330"," But this should be hard support two 13 should be a good number."
"1349750","1351570"," This is that retest that we're looking for. "
"1351970","1353330"," We're come up here, right?"
"1353490","1354470"," You see we come up here."
"1355070","1356030"," We didn't breach."
"1357050","1358530"," New all time highs above. "
"1359490","1366210"," And so we're going to look above and now we're going to check below this morning and see if there"
"1366210","1367570"," is actual support here."
"1367710","1372370"," If there's liquidity in the market that will come up and at least stabilize small caps."
"1372490","1375210"," This is going to be an important indicator for you to look at this morning. "
"1379480","1380340"," Let's go back to the spy."
"1381680","1385820"," Yeah, my interest should be we're weak this morning to 460 here in the spy as well."
"1385820","1392580"," The PPI number is so high that you're going to have every bear out there this morning. "
"1393680","1395360"," Telling you that the market is crashing."
"1396360","1398780"," I'm not in the market crash camp."
"1399140","1402840"," I think that we have volatility on the day of FOMC. "
"1403960","1407620"," That we could possibly break below."
"1407620","1410640"," If if Jay Pao is very hawkish."
"1411480","1418360"," But I still see a bounce from the puts rolling off the market on the 17th. "
"1419760","1421780"," And you can see some buyers stepping in."
"1421860","1422340"," It's 847."
"1422980","1424140"," This is interesting to see too. "
"1431990","1434050"," We'll probably see some liquidity come in."
"1434530","1435470"," We have looks good."
"1435590","1436270"," We can see your screen. "
"1436450","1436810"," No problem."
"1437030","1437690"," Pretty confident spot."
"1437890","1438370"," Retest support. "
"1439050","1441290"," Confluence of channel and previous step of 4500."
"1442010","1446890"," Yeah, the, you know, it's interesting about that number for 50."
"1447090","1452050"," Danian is that it's, I think it's actually four, five, five, zero. "
"1452310","1454170"," I'll take a look at the numbers right now."
"1455430","1459490"," For, let me take a look at you guys, the hard, hard gamma wall."
"1468140","1469540"," Yeah, actually, yeah, you're right. "
"1469660","1469760"," Correct."
"1470240","1472160"," The spy is at 450 now this morning."
"1472840","1475140"," So the, the hedge walls are moving lower. "
"1475660","1479380"," So 450 is now the put wall on the spy."
"1479940","1482680"," So Damien seems to think that we're going to retest for 50."
"1483480","1484760"," That would be a violent move. "
"1485280","1489480"," And if we do that violent move today, I think that's, that will actually be kind of fun."
"1489740","1496360"," If you did a, so if we hit 450, Damien, when do you think we're going to retest 450?"
"1496580","1498700"," Do you think that that's today or tomorrow?"
"1499380","1500640"," It's a pretty violent move."
"1502000","1502860"," It would be fun. "
"1502860","1507900"," Because if we did hit 450, the reaction would be, would be violent."
"1509660","1512180"," Rotationally, I think for 600 is definitely possible."
"1512740","1517780"," You can see 4580 as this is the 15 minute valve for ES. "
"1518120","1523660"," This is only 3% down from last several day, 5% up rotation, right as the mean for ES"
"1523660","1524260"," rotations."
"1524820","1525000"," Agreed."
"1525860","1527500"," Where do we get the infill of positive?"
"1527840","1528720"," Okay, please. "
"1529460","1530920"," Any specific thoughts on Tesla?"
"1530920","1537560"," Okay, so I use spot gamma to get positive and negative gamma in the market."
"1537980","1539060"," I use their numbers."
"1540080","1544520"," And then I use a book map for liquidity in the market. "
"1544720","1549680"," The one thing I want you guys to understand is that liquidity is always there."
"1550520","1556760"," Be careful of relying solely solely on spot gammas numbers."
"1558140","1561660"," This is often where traders get caught. "
"1563760","1567040"," They, we rely too often sometimes on these walls."
"1573240","1577200"," And so yeah, without a doubt this morning, I want you guys to be aware of that this morning, that"
"1577200","1579940"," you are going to find some resistance here."
"1580060","1580800"," Let me see if I can get. "
"1583490","1589930"," Let me can't bring out my profile for you."
"1590290","1593970"," So I'm not going to bring out my profile for you because it'll show my login credentials on the"
"1593970","1594230"," screen."
"1594230","1597250"," But you are going to see it regardless. "
"1597790","1600050"," You are going to see a reaction at 4600."
"1600570","1604330"," And if we did trade down to 4500 heading into."
"1605770","1606890"," Or 450. "
"1607190","1609010"," Let's let's look at this in a larger timeframe."
"1610810","1615530"," And this is what this is what is this Damien next week, followed by a nice Christmas rally."
"1616110","1621290"," Okay, so he's talking to Damien saying 450 next week, followed by a nice Christmas rally. "
"1621290","1626610"," Yeah, I don't see us not revisiting somewhere down here at this 450 level or 455."
"1627130","1628410"," If we break through 460."
"1629410","1631750"," This is a this is a speed bump along the way. "
"1632270","1636390"," I wasn't expecting us to see 450 heading into FMC."
"1637030","1641150"," I really wanted to see the markets stabilize heading into FMC."
"1642490","1646950"," Though I would want to tell you if the news is not hawkish. "
"1646950","1650670"," If you're a bear out there and that news is not hawkish."
"1651670","1656190"," On Wednesday, you're talking about a move that won't be 480."
"1656190","1661930"," It would be a it would be somewhere probably in the high for 80s low for 90s. "
"1662170","1666290"," That's how this market is setting up right now is it's so wound."
"1667150","1670470"," It's so wound on unknown hawkish news."
"1670470","1678050"," And if we head below here and you guys have to understand this reaction and or action and reaction"
"1678050","1680150"," that we're heading into FMC. "
"1680770","1687810"," So if we start winding up as we head into Wednesday, the how hawkish it would need to be."
"1688830","1692090"," We're not setting ourselves up for a market crash right now."
"1692210","1697510"," This weakness that you're seeing heading into Wednesday, the fact that it's already happening today"
"1697510","1698230"," on Tuesday. "
"1698230","1701050"," And then we've got people saying market crash."
"1701230","1706370"," We've got people saying that the fed is going to be hawkish when most of this information is"
"1706370","1710030"," already known and the market is hedged and wound so tight."
"1710770","1716050"," I don't I think I don't even think in March 2020 in February and March. "
"1716070","1724070"," I don't think I even saw maybe close to that to that wind up of hedging inputs in the market."
"1724070","1729830"," But we're not setting ourselves up for something right now."
"1731110","1734450"," We're setting ourselves up right now heading into today and tomorrow. "
"1737050","1738730"," That boy, I mean, it would be cool."
"1739370","1740750"," I'm always a dip buyer."
"1740990","1742670"," I always like when the market sells off. "
"1743210","1744230"," That's how I trade this market."
"1744450","1748690"," You guys know when I when I buy dips, I wait, I can wait sometimes a day, two days to"
"1748690","1749110"," buy dips."
"1750010","1752230"," You know, I try to try to buy them down here. "
"1752230","1754010"," I'll catch knives all day long."
"1755410","1756890"," And I am long right now."
"1757110","1758050"," Actually, I'm long. "
"1759290","1767130"," What am I long and I'm long enough in a December 31st in the money call spread."
"1767630","1774610"," And I did I had puts into close yesterday and then at for 13, I sold for profit at I"
"1774610","1776490"," think it was 88 cents or something."
"1776490","1780770"," I bought them at in the low 50s sold them for in the 80s. "
"1781090","1785590"," And then I grabbed some Friday and they weren't zero dates."
"1785590","1790110"," I bought some Friday for 76 or 470."
"1790310","1793630"," I thought my brokerage take a look for like 20 cents. "
"1794310","1800790"," And I bought those weekly calls on the indexes for the reason that I'm talking to you about."
"1801530","1803810"," I got to impress this upon you guys."
"1803990","1804670"," It's critical. "
"1805270","1810570"," So number one, if you're long this market moves can become very violent as we head into Wednesday."
"1811170","1812210"," That's been a saying of that."
"1812650","1818130"," I want you to also understand if you're long this market that there are some Elliott wave guys out"
"1818130","1821150"," there that are calling for the markets to crash. "
"1821150","1826510"," And a writer was saying the same thing last or in a news article yesterday."
"1827130","1829730"," He had a Twitter page and went on his Twitter page."
"1830170","1832450"," And sure enough, I scrolled through for the past year. "
"1832910","1835430"," And this guy's been calling for a market crash all year long."
"1835550","1837230"," And this guy works for a hedge fund."
"1837650","1843430"," Like this guy works in a hedge fund and his Twitter feed is just him posting market doom for the"
"1843430","1844370"," rest of the year. "
"1844370","1852990"," And this would signal a change from 2008 from the talk that's actually going on right now that"
"1852990","1853430"," you're talking."
"1854070","1859990"," Was that 12 some stupid 13 14 years and we're going to crash it today."
"1860670","1865410"," Crash it worse than COVID that that's that's the implication. "
"1866110","1868530"," I'm I'm not in that camp right now."
"1868790","1875570"," And as we sell down here into into FOMC on Wednesday."
"1875570","1883190"," If we continue this tightening right here, this winding of the market and negativity and we see the"
"1883190","1886830"," VIX, let's say, head up to 30 or 40 into FOMC. "
"1887370","1896110"," It's not a good or it sets us up to to react on the upside to some crazy all time"
"1896110","1896650"," new highs."
"1897330","1900110"," You guys all aware of that as we're as we're heading into weakness."
"1900810","1905910"," Let me look at what you guys are writing next week followed by a nice Christmas rally and close out"
"1905910","1908890"," after the market closes and close puts after mark closes. "
"1909270","1910530"," Yes, so you can close."
"1911250","1920670"," If you're trading cash market, you can trade the indexes until 4 15 PM on most brokerages."
"1921910","1925250"," Oftentimes that's where theta gang comes in and steals your money. "
"1925250","1935090"," When I trade so yesterday's directional move, I traded 12 15 puts into the close."
"1936090","1939470"," There's no intrinsic value in those options."
"1939730","1943250"," So the move is only good as long as you hold it. "
"1943350","1947810"," You want to be timing when you buy them and then cutting them loose when the move is finished."
"1948590","1954830"," Oftentimes you'll see in the after hour sessions, let's say you're at 350 in the afternoon and you"
"1954830","1964810"," buy some single one two day puts or calls and the move is made into close and that last 15"
"1964810","1968970"," minutes, the theta vampires will come in and take all of your gains."
"1969730","1977710"," So sometimes if the move is huge in the close, I will sell my zero dates before we actually close"
"1977710","1978270"," the day out. "
"1979310","1982770"," Also, sometimes you'll see retracement on the open the following day."
"1982890","1985810"," So let's say we make this power move in the close in any direction."
"1986250","1992250"," Sometimes the following day, you'll see a retracement right at open to the"
"1992250","1998710"," previous day. "
"1998710","2002910"," So not every time, but if I think we're continuing to go up, I'll hold them into close."
"2003170","2011030"," But if I think they have made 50, 80, 100% in this last 15 minutes of a session, I"
"2011030","2013390"," will close them out for profit, which I did yesterday."
"2014010","2015710"," I should have held on to them into this morning. "
"2015730","2019390"," It looks like, but I had made almost 100%."
"2019390","2026090"," At some point, they were up to the bottom of 55 cents and they were they would close the bell."
"2026650","2029230"," They were up to 96 or 98 cents. "
"2030650","2039290"," And I saw the the imbalance after the close, they wound up selling the market to end of day orders."
"2039290","2047389"," And so I was hoping for a bounce because the one thing the one key about yesterday was I didn't"
"2047389","2048010"," like that."
"2048670","2051190"," We didn't at least retest this high over here. "
"2051290","2056330"," I wanted to see a retest here to show that we were going to continue to go down."
"2056770","2058610"," But we didn't even retest yesterday."
"2059070","2063710"," So my concern was that we would attempt once more to retest and then head down into cash market"
"2063710","2064010"," today. "
"2064010","2067429"," But the negativity that's coming into this market right now is insane."
"2067969","2072010"," The things that the news articles that I'm reading right now are they're becoming wild."
"2072989","2077730"," And there's talk out there that it's because Carl Eikens got puts out there. "
"2078130","2078750"," He wants to cut."
"2078870","2079469"," He doesn't want that."
"2079590","2081810"," He wants those to go back into the money. "
"2082469","2083570"," He doesn't want to lose his shares."
"2083790","2085409"," He provided liquidity for the market."
"2086070","2087230"," Do you buy in the money?"
"2087590","2088230"," What is this?"
"2088830","2091790"," You can open and close positions five to four fifteen. "
"2091949","2092270"," That's correct."
"2092810","2094909"," What are you doing with the Friday calls?"
"2095270","2096430"," Do you buy in the money?"
"2096870","2097090"," Okay."
"2097310","2100770"," So I'm not getting rid of my Friday calls. "
"2101290","2104390"," I'm going to actually keep them into Friday."
"2104810","2107130"," My position in this market right now."
"2107290","2108810"," So I'm out of all my stock options. "
"2109370","2109890"," I'm trading."
"2110290","2112230"," I'm day trading this market right now."
"2112230","2115270"," The intraday. "
"2115510","2117950"," So I'll play the open sometimes or play the close."
"2118830","2121650"," And I will buy options that are cheap right now."
"2122430","2124830"," My stance on the market, especially. "
"2125430","2125870"," I was actually."
"2126110","2127530"," So I was actually more concerned."
"2127990","2128310"," Let's say. "
"2128850","2135470"," So on Sunday when we headed into Monday, I was looking for a retest of highs to either break"
"2135470","2138590"," through and sit above waiting for FMC or to be rejected."
"2138590","2143810"," We come back down and tag for 60 heading into FMC."
"2144510","2146650"," So we were kind of doing that this week. "
"2146910","2148870"," We didn't quite retest all time highs."
"2149230","2150070"," We didn't get there."
"2150730","2157830"," And then my point would be that we'd head down into 464 FMC and then make our decision if we're"
"2157830","2161350"," going to go lower or higher with whatever the announcement is. "
"2161350","2168390"," Now, the when we're down here right now heading into Wednesday, I have to press on all of you that"
"2168390","2177250"," if the Fed is not hawkish that we hawkish way that we don't know that the rolling off of hedging"
"2177250","2180750"," and puts is going to make the market move up."
"2181150","2182290"," You won't see 450."
"2183150","2185290"," You think more like all time highs. "
"2186270","2188230"," So be aware of that as a head in."
"2188550","2194390"," The best position for most traders out there is to be cash and wait for these moves to play out."
"2194770","2201030"," If you're a bear, I'm going to always still recommend for you to respect these supports respect"
"2201030","2202030"," 4600. "
"2202470","2206650"," Wait for the bounce and wait for the rejection above and to take it down once more."
"2207150","2210970"," If we bounce down here a couple times and then we start to move down to that 4500."
"2210970","2219850"," I wouldn't expect 4500 to break until FOMC unless news is leaking that we don't know about and that"
"2219850","2226090"," still lends itself to we don't know what FOMC brings that my recommendation is that most of you"
"2226090","2233510"," stay out of this market as we head into Wednesday at 230. "
"2233510","2235730"," So I had a question about Tesla."
"2236250","2237530"," So bring Tesla up over here."
"2240390","2242370"," And we have a gamma wall. "
"2242670","2244090"," So you know we have a gamma wall at 450."
"2244830","2246630"," We are light this morning."
"2249760","2252800"," So we're down 24 into pre market. "
"2253460","2257220"," My buy area right now is I think we talked about this yesterday."
"2257700","2261200"," That was a buyer somewhere around this 900 mark."
"2261660","2263900"," This wouldn't be surprised to see the hedge wall. "
"2264260","2265720"," I'll put a hedge wall in here for you."
"2266380","2268080"," So to the hedge wall last night."
"2271890","2276210"," So the hedge wall had started up here. "
"2276210","2282410"," I want to say it was at 980 and we traded this up back here."
"2282470","2284830"," If you guys take a look at December 6, we traded this up."
"2284830","2290450"," And the reason I was trading this up was because liquidity had come into the market that Monday"
"2290450","2294090"," morning shorts wound up selling down to get out of their positions. "
"2294610","2299090"," And then we sprung back up that wall has come back down."
"2299310","2302850"," It is now at down here at 950."
"2304090","2307910"," So here's the hedge wall on Tesla right now. "
"2308510","2310110"," And it's looking to push down."
"2310290","2316090"," And unless you have liquidity, which you cannot expect today or tomorrow in the market, there's a"
"2316090","2322710"," fair chance that you will see close to 900 today into tomorrow on Tesla."
"2322710","2326950"," If you guys have questions, I can answer whatever you guys have. "
"2327530","2330850"," Do you see and see all getting smacked looking at Tesla?"
"2331170","2337710"," You must consider the effect of HF front running Elon's public self shares, Gary, but yeah, so"
"2337710","2339310"," let's talk about that right now."
"2339710","2345410"," So no eyes are on no eyes right now or on Elon Musk."
"2345610","2347350"," Nobody cares about Elon Musk right now. "
"2347490","2349590"," Nobody cares about him selling the last of his shares."
"2349590","2354610"," Right now, all eyes for all intents of purposes are on only one thing."
"2355110","2356710"," And that is FOMC. "
"2357230","2365050"," This hedge wall that is on Tesla right now has nothing to do with Elon selling his shares, no"
"2365050","2366090"," matter what you think out there."
"2366190","2369390"," I'm going to explain to you right now, I've been meaning to do a video about this and you guys,"
"2369450","2371070"," I need you guys to understand this right now."
"2371070","2378390"," So when you are looking in the market internals that I don't see this talked often right, talked"
"2378390","2384270"," about often right now, when you're looking at the market, our market internals as the major players"
"2384270","2391350"," that hold up our indexes, you're looking at companies like let's say an Apple and a Tesla and these"
"2391350","2399250"," are two great companies to compare Apple has integrated itself into every aspect of our lives. "
"2399250","2408410"," If that mean from music to movies to phones to the software and computing power that is needed to"
"2408410","2411450"," make movies to produce things right."
"2411850","2413630"," So they're ingrained in their lives."
"2413870","2420250"," You speak to people that you know and they cannot give up their Apple product and always be there. "
"2421090","2426630"," Tesla wants to become that company at some point, but isn't quite there yet."
"2427530","2428930"," People want to own Teslas."
"2429610","2433370"," People want to be driving supposedly want to be driving EV cars. "
"2434590","2436830"," But Tesla is not the quite there yet."
"2437630","2439670"," They're still working towards that."
"2439670","2445970"," And when they make up such a large portion of NASDAQ, when they make up such a large portion of"
"2445970","2451730"," the S&P 500 and even the Russell, the IWM, there's such a large component. "
"2452530","2457870"," If they're going to drop this market, let's say a hedge fund is trying to hedge the market."
"2458410","2461770"," It's more difficult to hedge against an Apple."
"2462770","2471790"," It's easier for these large players, these banks to hedge a large component of these indexes that"
"2471790","2476350"," has more of a chance of the investment being pulled out. "
"2476870","2478030"," So what do they hedge?"
"2478950","2480750"," Well, the first of all, they longed Apple."
"2481090","2487450"," The reason Apple was driven up so high was so that it could sustain a hit to the market."
"2487450","2493010"," And the reason they're hedging Tesla where it is right now is because it's still a speculative"
"2493010","2493810"," growth stock. "
"2494110","2499230"," You will see longs remove themselves from a Tesla before they will in Apple."
"2499630","2505570"," So they're taking a calculated bet that, hey, if the market is to drop, the first one that's going"
"2505570","2510930"," to drop is for a large waiter in our indexes is going to be a Tesla."
"2510930","2519490"," They did the same thing this week with AMC, GME, and you've seen it across the markets in any"
"2519490","2520490"," speculative tech. "
"2520730","2525830"," You can see it, tech stocks getting whacked all over the place as we head into FOMC."
"2526610","2528070"," So be conscious of that."
"2528470","2535790"," Be conscious of where we are, the fear that's in the market over FOMC and which companies are going"
"2535790","2538150"," to be negatively hedged. "
"2538150","2543150"," You have to, even as a retail trader, if you were to look at the, if I'm going to look"
"2543150","2545730"," at Amazon, they're an integral part of our lives."
"2545970","2550290"," If I'm going to look at Apple, I'm going to look at Facebook, I'm going to look at any of"
"2550290","2557370"," these Fang Man stocks and Fang Man type stocks or big tech type stocks, we all know which ones are"
"2557370","2558750"," sticking out like a sore thumb."
"2559470","2565430"," And we also know that we can now begin to start hedging Apple because it was raised so high to"
"2565430","2566210"," hold our market up. "
"2566210","2567770"," Just be conscious of that."
"2570170","2571410"," Yeah, the Elon stuff."
"2571890","2575910"," Just keep that, keep that Elon stuff separate right now. "
"2576050","2576990"," I'm a Tesla bull."
"2577390","2581530"," Just so all you guys know, I am period, I'm going to Tesla bull, but you need to be understanding"
"2581530","2586890"," and conscience of this is from a bank's perspective and not from our perspective."
"2586890","2589630"," And it's not any of the news that's out there. "
"2589950","2594850"," This is what the hedge funds do and banks do to protect their profits, protect their investments."
"2595490","2603050"," They're going to target specific companies into weakness into FOMC possible rate hikes in 2022 or"
"2603050","2605350"," mostly unknown rate hikes in 2022."
"2605350","2608390"," So we've got market open coming up. "
"2608810","2610310"," We're going to look back at the spy real quick."
"2610670","2613710"," So we know today, I want you guys to understand that tech is weak today."
"2614250","2617990"," I want you to also understand that IWM, the small caps is very weak today. "
"2618630","2621150"," Spy is the strongest of the indexes today."
"2621950","2626250"," Someone made a note that oil was falling off and I want to look at XLF too."
"2627070","2628950"," I want to see what XLF is doing this morning. "
"2630610","2632010"," An XLF is weak."
"2632750","2633950"," What's XLP doing?"
"2636110","2643030"," It's consumer staples and this is interesting to see."
"2643410","2646870"," This cluster in here is interesting to see an XLU. "
"2647130","2647750"," Is this XLP?"
"2647950","2649270"," Yeah, let's look at XLU this morning."
"2650350","2651290"," See what they're doing."
"2652090","2653630"," There's some weakness in XLU. "
"2653670","2654630"," You don't want to be seeing that."
"2657040","2658360"," We're going to look at TLT."
"2663180","2665640"," That's interesting to see the weakness in TLT. "
"2666060","2671910"," We could be seeing a bounce this morning or some stabilizing."
"2674060","2676100"," I don't want to see what our opening is."
"2676140","2681580"," My thoughts on open this morning is two fold. "
"2682000","2684260"," Let's see what I think is going to happen this morning."
"2687480","2688200"," Let's talk about the open."
"2688440","2689880"," I'm probably going to sign off before open. "
"2690840","2691460"," A couple of things."
"2691800","2692880"," I'm going to hold my long."
"2693120","2701580"," Someone was asking me about the weekly calls that I bought on the spy and heading at a 4.15"
"2701580","2701780"," yesterday. "
"2702480","2703400"," I bought them very cheap."
"2703580","2704540"," They were 20 cents apiece."
"2704880","2710980"," They were 4.76s. I am not going to sell them or I'm going to diamond him them into the"
"2710980","2711580"," rest of the week. "
"2713280","2718440"," My take on the rest of the week is that yes, we will see some weakness heading into Wednesday, but"
"2718440","2726640"," our market is so wound up right now that my view is that our president in the Fed is going"
"2726640","2732620"," to see this and you are not going to see as hawkish as you're expecting during FOMC."
"2733020","2742040"," That will in turn create an unwind of put positions on the 15th and mostly on the"
"2742040","2743300"," 17th."
"2743720","2744320"," That would be Friday. "
"2745200","2746400"," That is also OPEX."
"2746860","2751800"," My thought process would be that we are going to swing much higher on Thursday."
"2751800","2759660"," We could possibly then sell off on Friday and then you will get your Christmas holiday rally into"
"2759660","2760480"," end of the year. "
"2761300","2769560"," But I do expect an upward movement here, violent upward movement here on Wednesday on FOMC."
"2769880","2771000"," I will stick with those."
"2771780","2777720"," I have had a couple of hedges on the market but I keep getting prints off them so I keep"
"2777720","2778760"," taking profit on them. "
"2778760","2784480"," So this morning on the open, I am going to look for a comeback to the scene of the crime"
"2784480","2786320"," above here, wherever this close is above."
"2786940","2795520"," This close looks like it was at 466.27. I will look for us to come back up to the"
"2795520","2802540"," cash close of the previous day and then possibly had lowered a 460, even if it takes two days into"
"2802540","2804760"," Wednesday's FOMC."
"2804760","2811680"," And to be quite frank with you, if we were to head down to 460 into Wednesday, it would get"
"2811680","2813360"," me even more excited as a bull. "
"2813600","2821920"," I am less excited as a bull above into FOMC than I am more excited as a bull down into"
"2821920","2822700"," FOMC."
"2823420","2824820"," So that is how I look at the market."
"2825060","2826500"," That is how I am looking at the market right now. "
"2827960","2829620"," What else are you guys asking down here?"
"2830500","2831940"," Let me see if you guys are asking."
"2835340","2838940"," 472, perfect zone of speculative tech being whacked is to look at the ARK funds."
"2839680","2841380"," Good indicator of tech tech strength. "
"2841580","2842140"," Absolutely investment."
"2843520","2844840"," You can see it."
"2845040","2847880"," You can see the money coming out of speculative growth stocks. "
"2849100","2852720"," You can see, you can see profits being taken."
"2853620","2857180"," I do scratch my head out there sometimes when I am looking."
"2857180","2864740"," People are saying, why did SNAP get whacked or why did PINS get whacked or how could PTON get"
"2864740","2865080"," whacked?"
"2865560","2868060"," The trade from 2020 is wrapping up. "
"2868220","2871060"," There is a grand rebalancing taking place in the market right now."
"2871820","2878100"," You can see profits being taken from that COVID trade that began in 2020."
"2879660","2883600"," And now you are looking towards whatever the trade is in 2022. "
"2885500","2889080"," Again, we have these all that we have guys that are saying that the market is going to burn from"
"2889080","2890040"," now into eternity."
"2891540","2894880"," I don't see that heading into 2022."
"2897760","2898340"," Excuse me. "
"2898860","2899560"," I need some coffee."
"2903560","2910280"," When I see the weakness in companies like SNAP or PayPal."
"2911860","2912300"," Square. "
"2912680","2914200"," You can name this along list of them."
"2915700","2922120"," DocuSign, Pins, Etsy, DoorDash, Zoom, PTON, Zillow, Spotify, Twilio, MU."
"2923000","2929040"," You see the weakness in the trade for airlines again. "
"2929180","2931320"," You see weakness in the gambling stocks again."
"2934120","2938780"," When you are seeing this weakness market wide and if you see Apple getting knocked down and as we"
"2938780","2942100"," come into the end of the year, you see that Amazon is coming down."
"2942620","2943740"," You see Facebook down. "
"2944640","2949260"," It's taking the milk shake away from a market crash."
"2950020","2956700"," If you head into January or March of this year and you see Apple down, let's say, to $120 or"
"2956700","2963740"," $140 or $130, it will look appetizing to market participants to reenter the market."
"2964300","2970880"," There was this thought heading into FOMC this year that we were going to whack all of these"
"2970880","2972100"," speculative growth stocks. "
"2972100","2975540"," We were going to whack all of tech at the same time and that didn't happen."
"2975900","2978340"," It was kind of like we're going to whack these ones over here."
"2978460","2979960"," Then we're going to whack these ones over there. "
"2980420","2985980"," We're going to prop the market up with one or two big tech stocks as we whack all these companies"
"2985980","2986440"," down."
"2986860","2989620"," It doesn't lend itself to market crash."
"2989980","2995060"," It lends itself to we're going to have some weakness heading into the beginning of the year like we"
"2995060","2997620"," do every year and the market's going to come right back. "
"2997620","3003000"," Now there's other talk about how our president and that's one of the way I want to talk to you"
"3003000","3010580"," guys about would be oftentimes presidents hate inflation heading into a re-election."
"3011260","3013900"," We know that Carter did this in his presidency."
"3014700","3017960"," He was willing to do anything to get rid of inflation. "
"3018740","3024480"," What really took place was we headed into a recession by heavy tapering."
"3026600","3029320"," We headed into a recession with heavy rates."
"3030420","3033700"," That is a mistake that presidents often make in the past. "
"3034160","3035840"," They want to keep their power no matter what."
"3036480","3041180"," If we get heavy handed with the rates, we could see recession."
"3041760","3046520"," That could be showing itself in the weakness in the markets, especially in the reopening trade,"
"3046980","3053100"," especially in seeing the gambling trade is off again. "
"3053960","3058820"," That's all I can see for the thought process that we're going to have a down one to three years."
"3059460","3064220"," That inflation is going to continue to rear its head that the rates are going to get slammed on us"
"3064220","3066980"," and that will be pushed into recession."
"3067980","3075320"," But in all honesty guys, on Wednesday, this market is so wound up, it is wild. "
"3078340","3079860"," Hold on a second here guys."
"3079860","3081240"," I'm getting my alarmers."
"3081380","3083560"," My alarm is going off for open. "
"3084420","3086020"," Yes, ask you capitulating."
"3086700","3089200"," I always like a really good job of eyeballing that."
"3089300","3092760"," I was looking for that yesterday, wondering when ask you would capitulate. "
"3093480","3095860"," I posted that on Twitter, I think, right?"
"3097580","3098900"," Let's look at ask you."
"3099140","3099520"," Beautiful."
"3100300","3101360"," Love seeing this right here. "
"3101700","3106040"," You want to see this capitulation in text so that you can take this long again."
"3106040","3109080"," I know some of you guys think it's going to go to the depths of hell."
"3109580","3115360"," But when I'm looking at companies for reentering them for the 2020 trade, right?"
"3115460","3116300"," You're looking down here. "
"3116440","3117480"," This is March 2020."
"3118460","3124660"," So on SQ, a lot of you, a lot of you bears out there want to see it at 85"
"3124660","3125460"," bucks, right?"
"3125600","3126380"," That's what you want to see."
"3126760","3128460"," You're really not going to see it that low. "
"3128860","3130460"," You're really going to see it somewhere."
"3132380","3135320"," You have to account for the normal growth of a company."
"3135320","3137840"," So what am I looking for in SQ?"
"3138720","3139800"," That's pretty easy. "
"3141850","3144090"," You guys can send alerts on your own brokerages."
"3144490","3145430"," You see this right here?"
"3145570","3149530"," You can add to a watch list, create alerts on whatever brokerage you use."
"3149810","3151890"," You see this beautiful capitulation down here?"
"3152310","3153950"," This is stuff like that. "
"3154050","3157970"," When you see stuff like this, this doesn't show market crash."
"3158610","3161850"," This is taking away market crash from bears."
"3162550","3168810"," When you see this capitulation, you will see, you will see bulls enter this reenter, this market"
"3168810","3172830"," somewhere down here between 134, 151, possibly even. "
"3172950","3174170"," Let's say it goes as low as $85."
"3174770","3176030"," You're going to see bulls."
"3176710","3181810"," You're going to see hedge funds and banks want to buy this trade once more. "
"3182630","3184710"," I often hear it's like, well, SQ sucks."
"3185730","3193030"," And I agree these payment processors accounting is really funky, but you have to see the best"
"3193030","3195170"," stocks, the worst stocks that they have cycles."
"3195170","3196170"," That they go through. "
"3197390","3198570"," This trade is over."
"3198970","3201810"," You know that banks got in down below here in these 30s."
"3202390","3207090"," And they took, they took their profit above here in the 300s, 10 times. "
"3207770","3209010"," They made 10 times their money."
"3209410","3214230"," So they're going to sell out of these positions to where fair value is."
"3214390","3218570"," I know some bears, some of you bears are going to say fair value is 30 bucks on SQ. "
"3219150","3221110"," But in reality, it's where they entered the trade."
"3221110","3224630"," That's where SQ is going to wind up down below here."
"3225050","3228110"," Probably a moment of weakness down around 134. "
"3229070","3232470"," If we had a market crash, I guess we could see $86."
"3233450","3235670"," But you have to see when they entered this trade."
"3236210","3238710"," You have to see the natural raise and climb of a stock. "
"3239270","3241830"," You can see that it's somewhere down below here at $84."
"3242430","3246090"," You know that some time has passed that it's two years later."
"3246510","3250250"," So you would expect it to probably bottom out somewhere down below here at 130s. "
"3251270","3254490"," 150s with no bad news, continued growth over the years."
"3254990","3259450"," You want to see this capitulation to take a company like SQ long as we move forward."
"3260570","3263870"," So consider this these thoughts as we head into the new year. "
"3264230","3269310"," Consider these thoughts as we start to enter longs again in the new year."
"3269870","3273310"," And I know that they're pushing out there the cloud trade."
"3273610","3275470"," They're pushing all these trades on you guys right now. "
"3275470","3280610"," But if you check like XLU and XLP, they are at tops right now, all-time highs."
"3281150","3286290"," You can't be entering longs on any index or any stock at all-time highs."
"3286550","3288390"," CNBC was telling us to do that yesterday. "
"3289110","3292750"," And I was just kind of scratching my head yesterday going, why bother?"
"3293370","3294570"," I'll stay cash gang now."
"3295130","3297230"," I'll trade the market that's in front of me right now."
"3297550","3302370"," And I will wait for it to settle down into the first of the year to take on longs. "
"3302370","3308010"," And I'm most certainly not going to be taking this COVID trade right out the gate on the first of"
"3308010","3308330"," the year."
"3308690","3314570"," I'm going to be looking for companies that have been down for most of 2020, 2021."
"3315190","3317030"," And that really is that gambling trade. "
"3317350","3319930"," It really is that cruise line trade."
"3320730","3327410"," The airlines trade, all those trades are ripe to be entered sometime between now and March."
"3328670","3330850"," So this, yes, you did tweet it. "
"3331190","3332810"," Thanks for the live cat and catch on Twitter yet."
"3333070","3334150"," Joe, you have a great morning."
"3334470","3337970"," Josh is a recession better than increasingly worse inflation. "
"3338850","3340290"," That's a great question, Josh."
"3341650","3345150"," And it's a, it is a difficult one to answer."
"3346790","3349790"," The, I think that recession is better. "
"3350030","3355490"," I don't think that it's appropriate where we are as a nation and as a world."
"3355490","3359290"," And that is a great question because I have a macro view on this."
"3359810","3367850"," The real concern is if other countries continue to shut down, it doesn't matter if we stay open. "
"3368350","3372990"," We, we have a world economy now and we don't want to be only talking about that."
"3373250","3374750"," I know, but that's what we have."
"3375230","3383750"," And so if let's say we headed to a recession right now and the world's economy was to shut down"
"3383750","3384790"," because of a variant. "
"3386330","3391210"," That would shut down more goods coming into our country workers coming into our country."
"3391750","3396790"," And if we're already in a recession, it's, it's not, it's not like you just cut one of your legs"
"3396790","3397070"," off."
"3397230","3398670"," You've now cut both of your legs off. "
"3399010","3402330"," So let's say we're in a recession and the world starts to shut down."
"3402510","3409010"," Do any of you out there know what typically happens historically in those situations because we can"
"3409010","3410930"," point towards some specific events."
"3410930","3416470"," World War II, World War I countries can get really frisky. "
"3417110","3420150"," So does that open us up to a conventional world war?"
"3420610","3426910"," I don't like talking about that stuff because it's all that kind of stuff is you're, you're talking"
"3426910","3429610"," out of, we're talking out of the realm of what we should be looking for."
"3431230","3432190"," But no recession."
"3432630","3433750"," Yes, I think we need recession. "
"3434290","3435550"," I don't think we're ready for recession."
"3436090","3437910"," I think that the taper needs to be slow."
"3437910","3442610"," I think that, well, yeah, I think the taper needs to stay on track as to where it is. "
"3442950","3447550"," I think that once we switch from the tape or two rates, I think that they need to be applied"
"3447550","3451090"," slowly over time over the course of three to five years."
"3451550","3455110"," But you, as you know, we're dealing with politicians here too in power."
"3455830","3458990"," And so they will do anything to fight inflation. "
"3461070","3462450"," That's this 10 minutes to the bell."
"3462770","3464010"," Yeah, all you guys have a great morning."
"3465230","3466310"," 10 minutes to the bell. "
"3466450","3466790"," Thanks, cat."
"3467010","3468310"," Hey, thanks, ma come vegetables."
"3468310","3470010"," Don't I remember posted several large. "
"3471390","3474170"," 42.5 C June 22 orders."
"3474290","3475030"," Yep, I posted."
"3475750","3481550"," There were, it looks like some banks were buying 42.5 C's. "
"3483370","3484030"," Into June."
"3485050","3487750"," Imagine if the US had inflation as high as turkeys."
"3488430","3490410"," Yeah, you know, with Damien. "
"3491250","3492510"," Panic go to war."
"3492730","3493190"," That's right."
"3493350","3494950"," Josh knows what the answer is. "
"3495050","3495930"," It is go to war."
"3496610","3498030"," Josh knows what the answer is."
"3498130","3499030"," The answer is go to war. "
"3499610","3502350"," So we have a delicate balance across the world."
"3502530","3504530"," Our economy is now tied in everyone else's."
"3505230","3507910"," And you will see the, you will see this on Wednesday. "
"3508290","3509310"," I don't think."
"3510370","3513490"," I think we're hawkish, but I don't think we're as hawkish as some believe."
"3514030","3522630"," And even if we are hawkish on into FOMC, that right now we're pouring trillions still into our"
"3522630","3527810"," economy that no one's talking about, even if we were to taper, even if we were to switch to rates"
"3527810","3528390"," being increased. "
"3529410","3531930"," The banks know that we're still pouring all this money into the economy."
"3532610","3537490"," And until we even start discussing that aspect of our economy, it's still being manipulated."
"3538450","3544870"," I think if we, if any type of leads to a 15 to 20% mark correction, power reverse. "
"3546090","3547270"," I agree, Massey."
"3548070","3554750"," You're going to see this market stay manipulated heavily manipulated for at least the next one to"
"3554750","3555230"," three years."
"3556490","3558990"," At least you're going to see it. "
"3559170","3559970"," It's happening."
"3560210","3561070"," It's happening currently."
"3561770","3562930"," This fits the bare thesis. "
"3564050","3569270"," For you to be a bear, you have to be aware that our market is manipulated."
"3570010","3575650"," If our market wasn't being manipulated right now, you would not see that we're at these all time"
"3575650","3575870"," highs."
"3576410","3576770"," And we are. "
"3577810","3579510"," How far away from all time highs, are we?"
"3579910","3580870"," 10 points, right?"
"3581150","3583510"," 20 points, 10 points away from all time highs."
"3583850","3587250"," So our market is manipulated 100%."
"3587890","3590030"," All ingredients are for war, Russia. "
"3590390","3594370"," You can't get Russia's stacked up right now on the Ukrainian border."
"3594690","3595610"," Nobody's talked about that."
"3595990","3597150"," That's been going on for a year. "
"3597570","3599770"," And it's just now getting into the news."
"3600510","3602410"," We know about Taiwan and China."
"3603190","3607090"," How will they service our debt if they raise rates high fast?"
"3609390","3611910"," They will service the debt by raising rates. "
"3612190","3620110"," When you raise rates and the faster that you raise rates, you're not going to be able to take on"
"3620110","3620630"," new debt."
"3620910","3626690"," That's the trigger point for recession is that lending will be tightened."
"3627210","3630190"," And when you have tightened lending, people can't take on new debt. "
"3630190","3633490"," So you're forced to pay down the current debt that you have."
"3633930","3635750"," And that's where the recession comes in."
"3635870","3642310"," That's where when we do that, people don't have money any longer to spend on not discussionaries. "
"3642310","3647190"," But I can't buy that apple that I wanted that's brand spanking new or I have to sell that old"
"3647190","3652810"," apple phone I have for the best money I can get and maybe settle for the old apple phone that"
"3652810","3653150"," I have."
"3653150","3658670"," And maybe I have to postpone buying that Tesla that I want to buy right so you see how those"
"3658670","3660090"," implications roll off."
"3664840","3668440"," Alright, so we're going to watch this open and then I need to I don't need to trade at this"
"3668440","3670020"," point, but let's look at. "
"3671040","3673300"," Let's look at the spy this morning."
"3674200","3675360"," Get back to the spy."
"3678730","3684210"," Yeah, I bet all of you guys are thinking that we sell down to 460 the depths of how right"
"3684210","3684630"," off the belt. "
"3684870","3685550"," This would be cool."
"3685550","3688710"," So here's the deal I'm opening before I close with you guys."
"3689090","3695390"," So if we sell down to this 460, I'm going to take along here above and look for rejection above"
"3695390","3700530"," at the cash at the cash close yesterday, which is up here. "
"3702580","3709460"," Right, so this is the cash close from yesterday 466.10. If we sell down below here right off the"
"3709460","3712280"," bell, I'm going to take along to 46, 610."
"3712820","3715940"," I think though that we're possibly going to try to close this."
"3716280","3718600"," This cash gap right off the bell will try to recover. "
"3719100","3724640"," This will if you are long over into today, this is your opportunity to get out of your lungs at"
"3724640","3725160"," 4646."
"3726340","3733220"," If you are caught in a long, I would say stay long in case we recover up to this 4600"
"3733220","3734400"," later today."
"3734800","3739180"," If we bounce around in the open today, that's that's another option as well. "
"3739180","3744460"," If you if we do bounce around, then you're going to look to get yourself to on F yourself out"
"3744460","3744900"," of your lungs."
"3745380","3750940"," But from this point, you're going to have to think about what's taking place from now into"
"3750940","3751280"," Wednesday."
"3751960","3753640"," Your best bet is to not trade. "
"3753920","3758500"," Or again, I've told you guys every day the past week and half, find a place that you can hedge"
"3758500","3764260"," up here in anticipation of FOMC on on the."
"3764260","3771740"," The announcement at 2 30 p.m. So if you haven't hedged, if we come into a high grab a"
"3771740","3775520"," hedge, if you have not hedged at this point and you we don't get a high."
"3775820","3780540"," I would say to stay out of the market at this point because the moves are going to become violent. "
"3781540","3784960"," And into today, my expectation we have four minutes left."
"3785320","3787500"," The expectation is we try to close this gap up here."
"3787540","3790740"," That would give you the opportunity to get out of any lungs that you're in. "
"3790740","3794340"," If we sell down at this 4600, you're going to note you."
"3794480","3795500"," I can let you know right now."
"3795600","3797720"," I'm going to have to get book map open for you guys. "
"3798400","3803680"," Expect expect some some liquidity to come in at 4600 and send us higher."
"3804100","3809600"," Do I think we see 4500 or 450 or 450 on the spy heading into Opax?"
"3810280","3812680"," It would be a gift if it if we did."
"3812840","3817620"," It would be a 100% gift today heading into Opax at 4500. "
"3818260","3819680"," I'll take that bet all day long."
"3820820","3826280"," Mostly for the gamma that put gamma roll off heading into the 17th and the 31st."
"3827320","3829020"," All right, so I'll see you guys out there. "
"3829400","3830800"," I will have flow up for you today."
"3831060","3838480"," If I see any moves in the market that are unexpected, you guys know I'll post them on the captain's"
"3838480","3838600"," alpha."
"3839340","3842900"," Just think those weird long wicks means getting in the spy see them sometimes. "
"3842900","3845100"," Nope, I don't see any lot."
"3845380","3848740"," These long wicks are sometimes they imply that we're going to continue to go down that they're"
"3848740","3850380"," selling down out of their positions."
"3850580","3853260"," But this could also be short covering heading into the opening. "
"3853760","3857880"," Do you think those long words I've had with snow puts at yesterday's top sweet move?"
"3858280","3860160"," Hey, MA into this open right now."
"3860580","3865700"," Good move on hedging this snow snow snow snow is really high right now."
"3865700","3869220"," If you guys want to hedge the market or tech talk about snow. "
"3870060","3872700"," Like I was trying to explain this to you guys yesterday."
"3873020","3874340"," Some of you guys picked up on this."
"3874760","3879940"," If you look at snow, this is a gorgeous, gorgeous looking hedge right here. "
"3880620","3881740"," And good job for UMA."
"3882280","3882880"," It's a great move."
"3883880","3885800"," I was trying to explain that to you guys yesterday. "
"3886080","3889460"," You look at 429 and they were way up here at 403."
"3890280","3892620"," This is a beautiful, beautiful stock to hedge."
"3893860","3896660"," Beautiful stock, especially if you don't want to hedge Tesla. "
"3896660","3898340"," This is one of the last."
"3899020","3905960"," This is one of the last big tech companies that are trading at super high multiples on their PE for"
"3905960","3906840"," this year."
"3907100","3909420"," This is really where you want to be hedging. "
"3909800","3910340"," So good job, MA."
"3910820","3911240"," Congratulations."
"3913440","3915960"," I can't believe some of you guys actually listened to me. "
"3916680","3917540"," It makes me happy."
"3920930","3921950"," Good job, MA."
"3922250","3922710"," You make me proud. "
"3925790","3927170"," So let's watch this open together."
"3927430","3929330"," I'll stay here with you guys for this open real quick."
"3932040","3933200"," We'll see what happens. "
"3934300","3936940"," Punch in on or talk to me on the chat."
"3937240","3939600"," Just tell me if you think we're going up on the bell or down at the bell."
"3940040","3940960"," I want to know what you guys think. "
"3948430","3949390"," Hey, you're welcome, Teagan."
"3952660","3953900"," Devon put spreads are nice."
"3954660","3955140"," They're safer. "
"3956560","3958320"," They aren't a little this morning, Chase."
"3958580","3961220"," You might want to wait for it to bounce up a little bit to grab them again."
"3963330","3964950"," I lose less money when I'm listening. "
"3965690","3965970"," Thanks."
"3967770","3968910"," I didn't hear you say that."
"3973630","3975590"," I love the different answers. "
"3977550","3980370"," Yeah, you can still hedge whenever I give you guys a play out there."
"3980470","3982890"," I want you guys to understand that whenever you guys see it, I give you guys a play."
"3984450","3989330"," That's if it's in a trend heading in the direction that I'm putting a play on, you always want to"
"3989330","3995270"," wait for a high if it's a put or a low if it's a call on the trend in the"
"3995270","3995550"," direction. "
"3998080","3998460"," Yeah."
"3998620","3999060"," So we are."
"3999180","4000200"," So we're heading up right now. "
"4000200","4000800"," Well, I don't know."
"4000920","4005180"," Sometimes you get that green bar and then it says this is you guys want to watch this open with"
"4005180","4005740"," me briefly."
"4006060","4006300"," Okay. "
"4006300","4009880"," When I put trade opens, I am usually looking."
"4010180","4016940"," This is a trick trick that the traders like to use as you'll see sometimes a green bar and open"
"4016940","4018160"," and then it reverses."
"4018920","4024060"," And so I'm always waiting to the first few minutes to see which direction we're actually going"
"4024060","4024340"," here. "
"4027470","4027950"," Let's see."
"4028410","4029870"," We'll leave this one up right here."
"4036090","4037990"," And my take is that we're going to close from. "
"4038050","4041130"," Yeah, we're going to head up to this 4600 4660."
"4041830","4043870"," That's my thought is that what that's what we're going to do."
"4044030","4046810"," Now, if we head down to 4600, I'll take along there. "
"4049580","4058600"," But if we have to 46, 610 or higher, please take a hedge, do yourself a favor and take a"
"4058600","4058840"," hedge."
"4062020","4063620"," And I would not be hedging the VIX."
"4064860","4066820"," The VIX play was a week ago. "
"4066820","4070200"," You, the VIX, and that's another thing."
"4070260","4074580"," The VIX can fall off after FOMC, even if the indexes fall."
"4076000","4079320"," Sometimes the VIX can move without the index is moving. "
"4080240","4086700"," You wanted to take that VIX trade earlier a week or two ago."
"4087560","4089360"," Sometimes we could have to take a look at it."
"4090020","4094680"," We're down in the teams, but you don't, that trade is somewhat over at this point. "
"4100279","4101700"," We should talk about the VIX one day."
"4104810","4106050"," That's we're moving up slightly."
"4117979","4123640"," And you'll also notice here for all you guys out there that 4640. "
"4125660","4132500"," And 465 is 465 number down here."
"4132720","4136840"," This becomes, this winds up turning into resistance at some point."
"4137560","4140319"," This was support and we sold down below. "
"4141300","4145620"," This will eventually turn into at this point, if we can't break above here."
"4145620","4148020"," And beat 4660."
"4148359","4151880"," This is then going to turn into resistance as we head into Wednesday. "
"4152640","4158319"," So it is really critical here at the open to see if liquidity is going to come into the market"
"4158319","4162279"," and maintain this as a support area."
"4164229","4165770"," Some of you are still watching right on."
"4167560","4168040"," Yep. "
"4168200","4168920"," So we're going to take a look here."
"4170680","4178300"," If you weren't long into today, if you went long into this morning, this is your opportunity to get"
"4178300","4179859"," out before trading down."
"4182960","4186920"," I'm going to hold long my calls that I am holding or 20 cents. "
"4187880","4195140"," And I am going to bet that those calls are at least 20 cents on Wednesday or Thursday."
"4195820","4197560"," No matter what they're worth right now."
"4198820","4199780"," They were cheap. "
"4201700","4204480"," And all you guys are wound up on short."
"4204800","4206920"," You got everybody is the whole market is retailers."
"4207600","4210780"," The banks are short hedge funds are short institutions are short. "
"4211440","4215040"," Nancy Pelosi's short everybody's short right Republicans are short."
"4215880","4219600"," Everybody's short in this market whole entire market short right now."
"4221080","4222400"," Whole markets wound up. "
"4226000","4226460"," Yeah."
"4226740","4231520"," This and to be honest, this is similar to when all the bulls are long when I see every single"
"4231520","4234800"," bull long when I see the FOMO longs and we're at a top."
"4236260","4238040"," I tend to take the other trade. "
"4238780","4240260"," I tend to take the cheaper puts."
"4247540","4248020"," Yep."
"4248160","4249480"," So this is so this open. "
"4249700","4250640"," This is pretty chill open."
"4250880","4252300"," We're at nine thirty five."
"4253240","4255280"," We're not seeing violent moves right now. "
"4255760","4257420"," I don't expect that we do."
"4257420","4260940"," I think asking for forty six hundred is a possibility."
"4261520","4262740"," We could possibly get that way. "
"4262820","4267180"," We trade down slowly into Wednesday, but you're not seeing."
"4267360","4269140"," We're not seeing heavy volume right now."
"4269440","4273200"," Low volume will lend itself to us going up at the open right now. "
"4273760","4276420"," I'm going to expect that we're going to try to retest the support level."
"4276880","4282620"," And if we get a reaction here, if we can't break through this support level this morning, you're"
"4282620","4283100"," going to see."
"4285220","4286740"," You're going to see it turn into resistance. "
"4287640","4290820"," You do have to understand that we're in a positive gamut environment."
"4291140","4294280"," Liquidity might want to make one more play from now into Wednesday."
"4294980","4297760"," They could possibly attempt to try to take this back to four seventy. "
"4298540","4303080"," If we are low liquidity, but if you are long into today, this is your chance."
"4303480","4306760"," To get out of an F in yourself this morning."
"4307600","4310320"," Somewhere between here at four sixty four four sixty five. "
"4311020","4315420"," And more importantly, we'll probably reject off this four sixty six."
"4315960","4317800"," Unless you see someone pick it up."
"4320880","4322700"," So I'll stay with you for just a little bit longer here. "
"4328140","4329480"," And I'll show you down below."
"4329940","4330800"," This would be your target."
"4331020","4338760"," If you're a bear, this is your zone in here to be picking up to take short to forty six"
"4338760","4339080"," hundred. "
"4345120","4345960"," Yeah, let's see."
"4349800","4353160"," So if you're a bear, you call this like an A, right?"
"4353380","4354260"," This is an A entry."
"4355000","4357100"," A B entry and a C entry. "
"4357100","4362940"," This would this would matter for you about the amount of risk you're willing to take on today."
"4363380","4367200"," So let's say you're a bear right now and you missed yesterday's sell off and you want to take"
"4367200","4368460"," another sell off into Wednesday."
"4369340","4374700"," If you were being aggressive, you would enter right now short or with long on puts. "
"4375380","4380040"," You would enter here and you would have a you would sell out of your puts above."
"4380260","4383180"," This is would be your stop loss up here at four six six."
"4383880","4384280"," Right?"
"4384780","4389620"," Now, if we break above here and you're a bear, you're going to get out of your shorts anywhere"
"4389620","4390380"," above here. "
"4390780","4397200"," This is where we would become the this is a zone where we have the potential to squeeze higher."
"4397700","4400920"," Now, if you're a bear and you're like, well, I don't want to take on that much risk."
"4400920","4405280"," Then you're going to either wait for four six five zero or four six six. "
"4405760","4410120"," Or you're going to wait for some form of con conformation to take to four sixty."
"4410600","4413720"," Now, I'm the type of trader that that's what I'm looking for."
"4414020","4414760"," I trade. "
"4415280","4419960"," I let the banks do the work for me up here and even the rejection right here."
"4420100","4421220"," There's no rejection yet."
"4421360","4427720"," If I was going to take this short, I am most definitely waiting for a bounce off four sixty six. "
"4428060","4432540"," And then I would probably cut it loose again at forty six forty and then take it down to forty"
"4432540","4433900"," six hundred."
"4434120","4438380"," I like to leg into my trades and then leg out of my trades."
"4438380","4443700"," So yeah, so this is a good example for you guys to be watching right now. "
"4444100","4446920"," So let's say let's talk to the bears real quick."
"4447440","4450800"," So let's say I'm going to take a short today."
"4452000","4456580"," I'm looking for us to reject off ultimately forty six six zero. "
"4457780","4463640"," We know right here at forty six fifty that we can reject, but I'm still waiting for that reaction"
"4463640","4465160"," here for that to take place."
"4465660","4468620"," If we can't even get above like right now we can't get above."
"4468760","4474080"," I'm looking for us to fail at some point here swoop back down and then take us short to forty"
"4474080","4474720"," six hundred. "
"4475340","4481020"," But until that happens, I'm going to let these banks do this work for me because these are the"
"4481020","4481660"," danger zones."
"4482360","4484880"," Forty six forty is a danger zone for bears and bulls."
"4485780","4492500"," Forty six forty fifty is a danger zone and forty six six is a danger zone on both sides of"
"4492500","4492880"," that trade. "
"4492880","4493980"," You really want to be seeing."
"4495600","4500980"," You really want to be seeing a reaction above and we talk talk to you about the expectation is that"
"4500980","4501860"," we go up on the open."
"4502200","4507300"," You'll hear people on social media tell you well, how do you predict these things?"
"4507940","4512120"," We just predicted it that we're going to go up and more than likely that we're going to go up"
"4512120","4513880"," and try to close this gap above. "
"4515120","4521540"," So we're not guessing here, but there's reasons why we expect to go up."
"4521540","4523580"," We have to put the pieces of the puzzle together."
"4524800","4526320"," We know that liquidity is below. "
"4526620","4528360"," We know the spy is still in a positive environment."
"4529060","4531200"," Although we are heading into a negative gamma environment."
"4531660","4535440"," So this is where if I was wanting to cut my lungs loose, I would. "
"4535800","4537180"," I'm not going to cut my lungs loose."
"4537340","4538020"," I bought them too cheap."
"4538700","4542360"," But if you guys out there are hearing this right now in this zone right here, you want to be"
"4542360","4547120"," getting yourself out and having yourself from whatever lungs you took at the bell. "
"4548340","4553840"," If you're a bear, you're looking for somewhere in this area, just like we talked about, we're"
"4553840","4555740"," taking another short to 4600."
"4556240","4564120"," What would I be looking for to take short into 4600 below 464.07 if we break below that."
"4564680","4566180"," At any point, I'll take this. "
"4566380","4567440"," I'll take this lower here."
"4569580","4570660"," Let's see what else you guys are writing."
"4572060","4574060"," Apple, Misfit, Facebook, looking green. "
"4574420","4575020"," I am ready."
"4575460","4575460"," Yep."
"4575660","4576220"," Safety trade. "
"4576460","4576700"," Absolutely."
"4577020","4577220"," I'm a."
"4577880","4578760"," Let's start up here."
"4579120","4580220"," I mean up. "
"4580700","4581880"," You are starting to replace me."
"4581980","4583700"," Kevin from market opens Jim right on."
"4583820","4584220"," Thanks, David. "
"4585900","4588540"," Up, then down, then up, possibly reverse."
"4588860","4589160"," Great job."
"4589320","4589380"," Matthew. "
"4589380","4592480"," I always love that answer up down, up down, up down speed up."
"4593500","4598160"," Alex, I use VWAP and if we are above or below it open, if trend continues to review up in"
"4598160","4598940"," the momentum direction."
"4599640","4600400"," We're going to talk about. "
"4600520","4602320"," I'm going to, what Alex just brought up."
"4602320","4603600"," I'm going to talk about here in just a minute."
"4605180","4608000"," I love these fake outs that market opens to catch those Uber bulls. "
"4608360","4608440"," Yep."
"4609460","4612080"," Jill, Nido watching, listening, learning, Chase."
"4612340","4613080"," I've been short for months. "
"4613260","4613980"," It will kill you captain."
"4614440","4615920"," Kill you as Captain Warren's."
"4616220","4618800"," You'll get these violent up swings then when the puts sold. "
"4619000","4619360"," Yeah, absolutely."
"4620580","4621620"," EwZ making a move."
"4622100","4622580"," Yeah, Chaz. "
"4622820","4623940"," I've had a WZ on my."
"4624300","4626080"," I've been following EwZ closely."
"4626580","4628300"," I want to fade the spy move up. "
"4628400","4631280"," Matthew, if you want to fade the spy move up, I've told you how to do it at this point."
"4632340","4633180"," I forgot cap."
"4633200","4637380"," What is the strike for your Friday calls for 67 for me?"
"4637520","4638080"," Let me take a look. "
"4638360","4639100"," Let me bring up my."
"4640660","4642000"," Look, let me look right now."
"4642180","4642480"," Hang tight. "
"4642780","4652560"," I will take a look right now and see what my strikes are for, or me log in here."
"4654860","4659620"," Hang tight here and I will log in and tell you guys what my strikes are for Friday."
"4660300","4661100"," I haven't even looked at. "
"4661560","4662380"," I don't even care."
"4663480","4665000"," You guys probably hate me as a trader."
"4668000","4675300"," Let's have a look. "
"4680400","4683780"," Let's see if I can close position."
"4686700","4687760"," Yeah, that's hilarious."
"4688320","4689180"," I'm not even down that much. "
"4689360","4690540"," They're at 20 cents right now."
"4692600","4696060"," Yeah, so I haven't even really been impacted too much by this."
"4696280","4697080"," They're at 20 cents. "
"4697760","4699360"," I think I bought them at 20 cents."
"4700120","4703100"," So I am barely down as we speak right now."
"4705740","4707820"," So they're down to scratch that. "
"4707960","4708940"," They're down to 18 cents."
"4709180","4710120"," Now they're up to 20 cents."
"4710820","4715900"," So I've lost minimal minimal on that move right now. "
"4716040","4716140"," Okay."
"4717300","4718540"," So that's my point."
"4718860","4720320"," So I bought those yesterday. "
"4721320","4723240"," They're still valuable right now."
"4723740","4726480"," Should I cut myself out of those calls right now or not?"
"4727740","4729200"," I'm going to take my chance on those calls."
"4729340","4730100"," They paid for themselves. "
"4730520","4730880"," They were free."
"4730880","4734460"," I bought them with the puts that I bought in the clothes yesterday."
"4735040","4738460"," If you are a bull, though, I'm going to warn you this is the time when you guys. "
"4739240","4740280"," Yeah, and it's gone."
"4742260","4743100"," This is hilarious."
"4744940","4747720"," The rot is so close to its support for the entire year. "
"4747820","4748880"," I think it breaks for the lower holds."
"4749500","4751780"," You know, Benjamin, that's the linchpin right now."
"4752000","4753760"," And earlier I was showing you guys. "
"4755000","4756620"," Let me show you this real quick here."
"4756800","4756940"," Okay."
"4757560","4759680"," The, they're pinning right now. "
"4759900","4760400"," IWM."
"4761540","4765700"," They're pinning IWM as a hedge against the market."
"4765920","4768360"," If IWM breaks below here, this will crash. "
"4768600","4771460"," This has a potential to crash the spy."
"4772060","4774120"," At least down to this to this."
"4774300","4776280"," I think this is 445 down here. "
"4776860","4777900"," At least down to 445."
"4778460","4779980"," That would take IWM down to 205."
"4780820","4788600"," And you would also see the fall of the cues that the what they've done here is. "
"4789380","4795680"," It's almost like you and I get into a fight and I've tied both your arms behind your back."
"4795680","4801220"," I've kicked one leg out from underneath you and the only leg that you're left standing on is IWM"
"4801220","4806640"," and how they will attack the market is probably going to be with Tesla."
"4806640","4812900"," AMC, GME, and probably snow and Apple. "
"4813280","4817940"," Now they'll take Apple and snow down because they're so high, but they'll be safe quote unquote,"
"4818380","4823600"," but you'll see the real attacks on AMC, GME, Tesla."
"4824860","4827800"," Companies like snow, they're still left standing though."
"4828000","4829760"," That's where you'll see the directed attacks at. "
"4830240","4835720"," And that's why you see IWM small caps, the ROTRTY where it's at."
"4836420","4838680"," I actually am probably making money right now."
"4840380","4841920"," I am flat, I think. "
"4842500","4843220"," Which is funny."
"4844980","4846600"," I wonder if I should close."
"4847280","4848120"," Yeah, do you know what I'm going to do?"
"4848600","4849320"," I'm going to close. "
"4849660","4850940"," I'm flat right now, which is hilarious."
"4853860","4855260"," I think I should close."
"4857000","4858900"," This is hilarious that I'm flat right now. "
"4860500","4861640"," This market is wild."
"4862080","4863180"," What do you guys think about this?"
"4863180","4867400"," Because, you know, you could have bought that open right there and you're printing."
"4868240","4871900"," You're absolutely printing right now and FD is on the open, which is hilarious. "
"4873340","4876840"," So if you're a bear, you're looking for rejection up here at 46, 610."
"4877800","4883160"," This, so if you're a bear, you're going to take a short or buy a put right up here."
"4883920","4886680"," Okay, you're going to look for you. "
"4886800","4887800"," I'm going to let you know right now."
"4887800","4889420"," There are definitely shorts above."
"4890500","4891740"," Definitely shorts at 46. "
"4892040","4893840"," I'm going to warn all of you this morning."
"4894060","4895000"," Longs, all of you guys."
"4895560","4899440"," 4, 6, 8, 30 right now, right, is where all these shorts are sitting. "
"4899840","4901940"," This is where the new volatility is right here."
"4902380","4903260"," I'll promise you that."
"4903880","4906620"," As we come and look at that, I just sold out of my lungs. "
"4907420","4909500"," And of course, we're about to pin."
"4909620","4911240"," We're going to bounce right off 46, 10."
"4911760","4912560"," It's kind of funny. "
"4913220","4918900"," So what you need to know for today, for day trading today, is that 46, 10, you're going to be"
"4918900","4923720"," looking for rejection to take a short or to take a long put."
"4924420","4929180"," You know that above 46, 29 will get some sort of squeeze."
"4930400","4932360"," You know that there's some volatility in here. "
"4934000","4935200"," I bet you guys are."
"4936100","4937240"," I bet you guys are."
"4937400","4939660"," You guys are probably trading as I'm talking to you. "
"4939820","4940140"," This is crazy."
"4942580","4945260"," Stop to be any breaking, entering fake as f."
"4945480","4946400"," Yes, Matt, I agree."
"4947160","4947780"," It is fake. "
"4948560","4949080"," It's all fake."
"4949440","4951020"," The whole market's fake right now."
"4952140","4953600"," I used to swing trade. "
"4953840","4956520"," I used to swing trade one to three months."
"4957640","4959200"," Let me see if I can show you guys something."
"4959980","4961840"," I'm going to show you guys something real quick. "
"4965020","4966120"," I want to show you guys something here."
"4970060","4971580"," So forget this right here."
"4971720","4979560"," So back in the day, you used to be able to take a one month out call or a three"
"4979560","4980720"," month one to three month out call. "
"4981080","4986400"," And the stock market would, you know, you'd have a, let's say take a call, right?"
"4987180","4990380"," You would have this beautiful slope to it."
"4991420","4992760"," It kind of moved like this."
"4995300","4997980"," And you would eventually be able to sell out of your calls. "
"4998060","5000260"," And the same was on the inverse with puts."
"5000260","5010480"," You could take a long, let's say, or even a short position or a long put, let's say, position"
"5010480","5016180"," buying a put and you could buy down on the bottom of a channel and sell for profit above."
"5016940","5025920"," But once the algos really started taking over, once the algos really started taking over, we went"
"5025920","5030100"," to this more violent moves over the course of a month. "
"5031120","5032240"," More like this."
"5034530","5044350"," And what took place was these algos are squeezing the moves for all of their gains, all the money"
"5044350","5045370"," that's in that move."
"5046190","5053930"," And so what you're left with after the course of a month is the intrinsic value of your trade being"
"5053930","5055510"," sucked dry almost. "
"5055510","5059190"," So now you're pushed to buying three month out calls."
"5059250","5064790"," That was the big move in 2020 to 2020 as now the end of 2020 21."
"5065310","5067430"," But it's brutal right now with the algorithms. "
"5067790","5074450"," The algorithms are murdering traders, retail traders trying to stay in any kind of a long."
"5074830","5075890"," That's a month out."
"5076550","5079310"," Three months out is still risky right now. "
"5079310","5087610"," And so you're almost reduced to buying stock, leaps, fire out options in this market or trading."
"5088050","5093370"," Even if you're, you guys know that when you're trading a month out call or a week out call that"
"5093370","5101490"," you can come in the money in two, three days, a day, sometimes two, three days, four days and"
"5101490","5102210"," you're cutting them loose."
"5103510","5109050"," You know that you can take a weekly right now at the right time and be in the money in"
"5109050","5111130"," a day or two, one, one, two days. "
"5111730","5115070"," You have to hold a weekly for the entire week."
"5115550","5117210"," That's my experience at least."
"5119460","5122240"," I was referring to this bounce up this morning, but yeah, it's all fake. "
"5122560","5125460"," Yeah, the bounce up, the bounce up is to be expected."
"5126000","5128360"," What's that rejection on spy or tries again?"
"5129320","5131860"," No, so I thought I got said this to you guys before."
"5132040","5135740"," So what you're looking for is this gap close above here. "
"5136580","5138040"," This morning, which took place."
"5138740","5140420"," And now we're beginning to head back down."
"5140740","5143160"," We'll probably have a tight trading range today. "
"5143360","5144760"," I'm not going to expect a huge move."
"5145200","5153360"," We might slowly trade down to this 460 into Wednesday in anticipation of the Fed or the FOMC."
"5154120","5155880"," We could stay inside this rate. "
"5155940","5157220"," We could stay range bound in here."
"5157380","5162540"," 46 40 to 46 46 80."
"5162540","5166980"," So it's look for a trading range somewhere in here today into tomorrow. "
"5167480","5171860"," Possibly some weakness into the FOMC, but I do want you to be aware."
"5172260","5173160"," Please be aware."
"5173740","5179520"," The further we sell down into FOMC, the riskier it becomes for bears. "
"5180080","5185440"," The higher that we trade into FOMC, the less riskier it becomes for bears."
"5186200","5190520"," For bears, you guys have to start changing your thought process."
"5190520","5196480"," When we're way up here in Tefo MC, we're more than likely going to sell off in Tefo MC. "
"5197060","5205640"," The farther below we get down here, the chances are higher that when that put protection comes off,"
"5206040","5207180"," we're going to scream higher."
"5207420","5210640"," It would take some really ugly news."
"5211460","5212680"," And we know that this is manipulated. "
"5213240","5218920"," If you're a bear, you have to understand to be a bear and believe in the bear thesis, you have"
"5218920","5221400"," to know that they are going to manipulate the market."
"5222040","5222880"," That's what they're going to do."
"5223020","5226920"," Whenever they see the market falling too much, they step in. "
"5227240","5228360"," You see them step in."
"5228480","5235020"," We saw the president step in on Thursday and tell you that inflation is transitory again, right?"
"5235640","5239800"," That gas prices are coming down and that shortages are not as bad as they were."
"5240280","5243340"," So you're going to see that market manipulation depending upon where we are. "
"5245810","5246450"," Let's see."
"5246670","5247290"," Oh, it's a friend."
"5247490","5250450"," Rejection with that rejection inspired tries again. "
"5250550","5252350"," No, Chase, it should not try again."
"5252650","5255930"," You're looking for that rejection to take on up above here."
"5256410","5263090"," This is your A entry, B entry, C entry to take puts here. "
"5263570","5267370"," Let's say you buy a put here or sell a call above."
"5268330","5274850"," If you own the underlying and then you would hold a put or a put position or a short position"
"5274850","5281610"," here, take on a short and your stop loss is above here at 4680."
"5282230","5283950"," And that is where most shorts are. "
"5284050","5286090"," Most shorts are short here at 4680."
"5286610","5289330"," And this is the volatility zone for bulls at this point."
"5289910","5294250"," You're more than likely going to see a muted trading session today and more than likely see a muted"
"5294250","5296210"," trading session into tomorrow. "
"5296590","5298810"," Unless news comes out."
"5299130","5301190"," That does happen at some FOMC's."
"5301250","5304190"," You'll see like an hour before FMC will start making some moves. "
"5305070","5306690"," Half an hour to an hour."
"5306830","5309250"," You'll see some trades being made in the background."
"5310030","5311170"," Sometimes it does leak. "
"5312450","5313810"," But you want to be aware of this as a bear."
"5314070","5317430"," As a bear, if we start trade, I'm telling you that we trade down here."
"5318350","5323630"," And let's say we have some kind of hawkish news and we plummet down to 4,500. "
"5325250","5326950"," There are buyers in the market."
"5327110","5330630"," There are banks and algorithms that are triggered to buy this market at certain levels."
"5330630","5334690"," So you would expect a violent move up to expect that. "
"5334990","5337130"," And I'm going to leave you guys with one thing that's important."
"5338170","5340370"," Apple needs to crash back to 157 levels."
"5340790","5341790"," This run up is annoying. "
"5342470","5344530"," I agree, Damien, and I agree and disagree."
"5345210","5346930"," But I understand why it's happening."
"5347130","5351530"," And as long as you can understand why they're doing that, they're running up Apple because it's an"
"5351530","5354550"," actual market hedge so that we don't crash. "
"5354990","5359010"," It's being used as like Amazon is used."
"5359010","5363390"," The banks love to hide their money in Amazon and they love to hide their money in Apple."
"5363650","5368610"," So they're going to pump it up in case it comes back down to that 140 level, 150 level. "
"5368950","5372850"," That is all manipulation by banks to protect their money."
"5373610","5375970"," They're happy with Apple going up to 180."
"5376550","5379090"," And they're happy with it coming back to 140, 150. "
"5379890","5380310"," Same with Amazon."
"5381250","5383190"," They do the same thing with Amazon all the time."
"5384090","5385030"," But I want to leave you guys with something. "
"5385430","5388770"," I should have book map up and running for you."
"5389010","5391610"," I'm going to get off here to make it, but I want you guys to understand something."
"5391750","5395930"," I'm going to have book map running for you in the coming days today or tomorrow. "
"5395930","5398110"," I think I'll have book map up running for you."
"5399770","5403190"," And you will be able to see where the liquidity is in the market."
"5403350","5405330"," You'll be able to see where the sellers are in the markets. "
"5406090","5408090"," It's going to be an eye opener for some of you out there."
"5408110","5408630"," Not all of you."
"5408670","5412510"," Some of you guys are aware of these of this type of software. "
"5412510","5417830"," But this will show you where the smart money is, where they're buying and where the smart money is,"
"5417830","5418450"," where they're selling."
"5419170","5426530"," And it will demystify the bull bear concept that we all tend to take on in our personalities."
"5427090","5431890"," It will start to demystify where the actual buyers are, where the sellers are. "
"5432130","5437930"," You'll see them reach out like a whale or a shark and just start absorbing sellers."
"5437930","5441990"," You'll see where they start to sell and take profit."
"5442690","5449830"," And this program, this software that I use is, I use this when I give you guys trading signals live"
"5449830","5450370"," on Twitter. "
"5450950","5452230"," It's typically from book map."
"5452710","5454270"," I'll be able to see that we're selling."
"5455730","5457870"," Let's call it three to five minutes before. "
"5458410","5462090"," And I'll be able to see if we're buying three to five minutes before."
"5462730","5463650"," But I have to do some stuff."
"5463990","5466110"," I can't give you guys my credentials. "
"5466110","5469650"," So I got to make sure that everything is on the private."
"5471550","5472730"," Can you show snap."
"5473510","5476230"," For your book map doesn't have the spot gamma hero stuff. "
"5476710","5478870"," Speed, I've got all that stuff, brother."
"5479290","5481990"," I have the spot gamma hero indicator."
"5482970","5485990"," I've got I've got the overlay map from spot gamma. "
"5486310","5490130"," I've got all the cool tools and you're going to be very happy to see that."
"5491890","5492690"," You're on point cap."
"5492830","5493170"," Thanks, Max. "
"5493370","5493950"," I appreciate it."
"5494690","5495730"," Can you show snap?"
"5496010","5496770"," Yeah, I can show snap."
"5497510","5498410"," Let's take a look at snap. "
"5501040","5505000"," And this is a good one to actually take a look at because snap."
"5505020","5507900"," We did see some positive call hedging and snap."
"5509040","5509400"," Enter. "
"5509400","5510760"," We saw that right here."
"5511400","5512620"," We're going to take a look at this in a closer."
"5514440","5516780"," Look here and I want you guys to see this too. "
"5516900","5518600"," So see this down here."
"5518620","5519880"," You can see this volume down here."
"5519880","5521960"," This isn't the volume you're looking for. "
"5523200","5529540"," You can see there's some and this is only 436 buys down here."
"5530380","5532620"," This isn't really what you're looking for."
"5532860","5537420"," We saw some longs come into the market on snap yesterday. "
"5537920","5539260"," And we've seen it in the past two."
"5539440","5540180"," Let's look at the three month."
"5542740","5544380"," And you saw it right here. "
"5544600","5547380"," You can see it right here."
"5547380","5555860"," You saw a six million buys at $44.93. This is a positive for snap to see banks starting to"
"5555860","5556960"," reenter the trade."
"5558040","5558640"," Unsnap. "
"5559140","5561100"," Does it mean that snap can't come down any farther?"
"5561580","5561700"," No."
"5562140","5564680"," Do I think snap is a trade for 2022?"
"5565420","5565760"," Yes."
"5566340","5573320"," I originally thought it would be the shortage trade, but I think the banks are going to be like"
"5573320","5574280"," banks always are. "
"5574280","5580700"," They tell you that we're not going to trade snap next year, but I think that you're going to see"
"5580700","5582020"," that we do trade snap next year."
"5582080","5589760"," I think you're going to see the banks reenter all these retail sexy trades before you do and then"
"5589760","5594360"," they'll entice you with them once January and March rolls around."
"5595260","5597840"," So what would you do to buy snap?"
"5598140","5599260"," I guess would be the next question. "
"5599940","5600860"," When do you enter snap?"
"5600860","5603520"," So you get your one year mark on snap right here."
"5604300","5608620"," And when you look a little bit further out here, this to me doesn't look like it's done going down."
"5609100","5613660"," We know that the trade for snap was in March way back here. "
"5613760","5614620"," Let's look at the snap roll."
"5614760","5615600"," This is a good one to look at."
"5616520","5621320"," So we know that the banks came in to snap somewhere in May of 2020. "
"5622000","5624340"," So we're going to we're going to lower this way down here."
"5624780","5625620"," This is where they entered."
"5625620","5635560"," And we know that how snap was growing, we can see a trend line for how snap was"
"5635560","5636260"," growing, right?"
"5638020","5645020"," So you start to wonder where is bottom for snap if it had had a normal trajectory down below here. "
"5645420","5648840"," So you can see you really want to be a buyer down below at 4276."
"5650620","5657300"," And think about when you're entering a stock as a long term investment that you want to enter it on"
"5657300","5662160"," its normal trajectory in growth, especially if it's still growing, right?"
"5663020","5670520"," You want to so that you're comfortable as a buyer, even if we trade below, that you know that"
"5670520","5675380"," eventually we're going to get back on this track if we're in a growth phase still."
"5676220","5681940"," And if you're a more conservative buyer, you're probably going to be looking for the start of this"
"5681940","5687000"," trade, which is down below here as low as $28, right?"
"5687860","5689640"," So what would you start taught?"
"5689820","5697890"," You would start saying to yourself this, show you guys right now how I go how I long a stock,"
"5697890","5698370"," okay?"
"5699390","5701670"," So you saw banks come in here, right?"
"5701970","5703250"," We know banks stepped in. "
"5703690","5708850"," Start of the banks began stepping in right around $45."
"5710190","5713470"," You know that we're going to have to consolidate at some point, right?"
"5716040","5720340"," You know, there's always that momentary weakness where we can become buyers down below."
"5721140","5724260"," So I would set an alert on $45,166. "
"5724540","5726980"," I would set another alert at $37,605."
"5728280","5733120"," So when that first alert is met down here at $45, I'm going to start paying attention to snap"
"5733120","5733460"," again."
"5734180","5740080"," And then once it's in this zone here, we already know that we've got a resistance point. "
"5740700","5742120"," This is all old school stuff right here."
"5742120","5745440"," But you know, we have to break through resistance at some point."
"5746000","5748120"," So it started watching it at $45,166. "
"5749180","5752320"," And then be a buyer somewhere in this zone."
"5752720","5759620"," And I would also wait for consolidation to move over to break through this resistance point."
"5760220","5765900"," I'm usually trying to catch my investments somewhere where they're stopping on a level of support"
"5765900","5767900"," and being alerted to it. "
"5767900","5772100"," And then they start to trade sideways and consolidates for the next leg up."
"5772680","5775260"," And so this is how I end up, this is actually how I invest."
"5775900","5778820"," And this is how I'll end up looking at all of my stocks for 2022. "
"5779560","5783300"," As soon as we're done with this FOMC, it's going to give me a week or two to take a"
"5783300","5786120"," look at these stocks for buying back in for 2022."
"5786860","5790120"," So you'll see like I'll, I'll chart snap just like this."
"5790340","5792000"," I'll chart most of my stocks just like this. "
"5792000","5796960"," If I'm able to chart out 100 to 200 stocks for 2022."
"5797900","5801200"," As they start to hit my numbers, let's say snap doesn't hit."
"5801580","5807240"," Let's say Uber hits or let's say pins hits or Peton hits or Tesla hits. "
"5807820","5813220"," I can then enter those trades where I feel comfortable where I don't mind owning snap at."
"5813660","5816820"," So right now, this is just a took me three minutes, right?"
"5817440","5820980"," I would be comfortable owning snap at 37 60 all day long."
"5820980","5825640"," And I bet most of you out there would be comfortable owning it right around that zone as well. "
"5825800","5828300"," That $37 mark, I'm sure that all of you would."
"5828600","5831000"," If I can see that some banks are already."
"5831560","5836500"," If I can see that some banks are already long snap in here and they're going to provide me with"
"5836500","5839500"," some fuel to go up in 2022 and beyond. "
"5840160","5841660"," I'm going to feel comfortable down there."
"5842340","5844800"," And I have to do a video on this again live with you guys."
"5844800","5845800"," I should start. "
"5846080","5849760"," We should do a video on the weekend so that I can chart out for you."
"5850440","5860080"," Where to buy or where to invest in 2022 and your favorite stocks and how to set alerts on 100"
"5860080","5867860"," to 200 stocks so that you stop chasing stocks and start having them come to you for where you want"
"5867860","5868460"," to own them."
"5869560","5870420"," Does that help?"
"5873430","5874870"," IBM is getting confused. "
"5875150","5875610"," I'm home of this."
"5875890","5876650"," Thank you, Spy."
"5876990","5878330"," Gapdowns are bullish for rot. "
"5878930","5879350"," They are."
"5881030","5882990"," I don't get any confused this open."
"5882990","5884230"," Let's look at the right real quick. "
"5884970","5889860"," Let's take a look."
"5890460","5891340"," See what they're doing."
"5891920","5893960"," Look at that ricochet. "
"5894660","5895100"," Hilarious."
"5896900","5898640"," Yeah, so they're going to pin this market."
"5899680","5900740"," See that down here?"
"5900860","5901320"," This is insane. "
"5902140","5902940"," Watching this is hilarious."
"5903620","5909940"," This range by now is going to feed the theta gods need profits looking to take smaller quick profit"
"5909940","5910940"," of this maintains today."
"5911200","5914080"," Yeah, that was, you know, if you guys check my Twitter feed. "
"5914400","5916960"," I think on Monday right before open."
"5918040","5919640"," This week and last week."
"5920300","5921040"," The play. "
"5921760","5922920"," Most certainly."
"5923940","5925940"," Was butterflies and condors."
"5925940","5934340"," Everybody in discord's are on their slamming on butterflies and condors this week. "
"5934720","5935360"," Broken wings."
"5936340","5940180"," They're selling one side and the other and they're they're cleaning up."
"5940300","5947470"," They're making 100% 200% profits on the stock picking thing. "
"5947490","5951050"," What you can do is just do a live session."
"5951650","5955170"," That way you don't have to prepare a bunch and we can kind of interact because it's easy enough to"
"5955170","5956550"," pull up a chart and look cool."
"5956810","5957270"," That's what I'll do. "
"5957270","5958450"," Let's do one."
"5958730","5961290"," How about this Saturday and Saturday?"
"5961570","5962110"," What's better?"
"5962630","5967110"," Better for me is probably Saturday morning, but I know you guys like football."
"5967730","5973690"," If you guys prefer Saturday or Sunday and I could do maybe a hundred charts for you. "
"5973870","5975890"," I don't, I can usually do charts pretty quick."
"5976090","5982410"," Take usually it takes me like two, three minutes to set up a chart with a buy zone for them."
"5982410","5986210"," And we can do this for 20, 20, 22. "
"5986470","5988710"," We'd love to see some charting of stocks for longer term moves."
"5988950","5989370"," Absolutely desperate."
"5989690","5990050"," I agree. "
"5990590","5991450"," We're heading into the end of the year."
"5991830","5994830"," This is the time right now when banks get long in stocks for next year."
"5995390","5997770"," From now until March, they start to position themselves. "
"5999330","6001450"," I'll do, I'll get into LCID here in just a minute."
"6001930","6004910"," I appreciate different, deeper insights into digital tickers."
"6005090","6006890"," I have newer to the markets and don't do options. "
"6007270","6008090"," Just trade individual stocks."
"6008530","6009370"," You're a boomer."
"6009630","6013650"," I have some killer stock picks for next year already. "
"6014350","6018310"," I'll throw some of those out there for you guys on Saturday when tight strangles."
"6018490","6019190"," It's working so far."
"6019330","6020250"," Strangles are baller. "
"6020490","6021890"," I love trading strangles."
"6022590","6026590"," I love, matter of fact, you know, it's going to make a great trade heading into FOMC."
"6027450","6031450"," Is a, not a strangle, but a straddle. "
"6031770","6037630"," If you straddle FOMC right, maybe a half an hour before FOMC if you were to straddle it."
"6038470","6041750"," One side of that trade is going to print fat money."
"6042170","6043330"," Stupid fat money. "
"6045750","6047130"," Either day, either as well."
"6048310","6049390"," That's, that'd be incredible."
"6049650","6050030"," Thanks, Cap. "
"6050410","6050610"," Yeah."
"6050750","6050850"," Okay."
"6050990","6051430"," Let's do Sunday. "
"6051730","6051990"," You know what?"
"6052490","6059670"," Let's do Sunday morning 11 a.m. I will post something on Twitter for a Sunday morning at 11 a "
"6059670","6062610",".m. That we're going to chart out your favorite tickers."
"6062870","6066570"," I will come prepared with some, I'll come prepared with some."
"6066570","6073590"," I'll try to get between five and 10 stocks for you guys that want to buy physical stock for 2022"
"6073590","6075330"," that look like. "
"6075930","6078470"," So my, my requirements typically for buying stock."
"6078770","6084610"," I, I, I try to do, I try to chart out alerts for catching knives on stock."
"6085050","6092890"," And then I actively trade stocks that are typically, they have IPO it within three years. "
"6092890","6097190"," They have had year over year profits of 30% or more."
"6098250","6102490"," And they've had an every, or the last three years have been positive."
"6103150","6108670"," So if I hit those three, oh, and I make sure that banks have bought and are trying to position"
"6108670","6109730"," those growth stocks. "
"6110650","6112950"," So those are the, those are the two types of stocks I buy."
"6113690","6117310"," The first one catching knives I find out where I want to buy it at."
"6117910","6118730"," And set alerts. "
"6119430","6125470"," And then the ones that I actively trade where I buy physical stock are meet those requirements."
"6127890","6128950"," Eastern Standard Time."
"6129110","6129610"," Great question. "
"6129830","6129970"," Joe."
"6131550","6133510"," 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time."
"6134610","6135790"," You are one Santa Claus. "
"6135970","6136510"," I'm telling you."
"6136810","6140210"," I bet you guys didn't believe that spy would do that this morning."
"6140570","6143830"," You guys are always hilarious because you guys are always like, how do you know this is going to"
"6143830","6144110"," happen?"
"6144750","6147930"," You guys are always asking me, how do I know the moves in the market?"
"6148530","6149690"," I think it's time and market. "
"6150290","6151390"," That's all I think it is."
"6152210","6155350"," And so had you, and this is playing out just as we talked about, right?"
"6155850","6156670"," It's going to come up here."
"6157170","6158030"," It's going to meet some rejection. "
"6158850","6162150"," You take a short above here and you're going to take this low into Wednesday."
"6163610","6164750"," And that's what I would expect."
"6165070","6169970"," So as we head into Wednesday, I'm not going to expect a ton of move here, ton of movement. "
"6171170","6172750"," Let's say we're going to look here."
"6173430","6175410"," You're going to, you saw some rejection above."
"6175610","6179150"," We know there's volatility above heading into, heading into Wednesday. "
"6179290","6181030"," We're not going to make big moves here."
"6181570","6185330"," You could have at the, at the open, taken on butterfly."
"6186150","6188570"," And this would be very nice in the Wednesday. "
"6188870","6191610"," Oh, no, because you couldn't hold the butterfly into close Wednesday."
"6193770","6196950"," You really want butterflies and condors to close."
"6197890","6202990"," You want to be closing those positions right before the close of a trading day for max gains. "
"6203630","6206690"," Like right before like four, like 354, 345."
"6207690","6208930"," You want to be closing those trades."
"6209750","6213650"," And we all know that on Wednesday, you don't want to be holding the condors and butterflies. "
"6213670","6217350"," You're going to be cutting those things loose at like one o'clock in the afternoon at the latest"
"6217350","6220570"," because it's going to get real sketchy down in this zone."
"6221550","6224690"," And you might want to wait to grab a straddle until Wednesday."
"6225550","6230650"," All right, I'll probably take on a straddle on Wednesday around 12 or one in the afternoon. "
"6232090","6234030"," I'll probably grab a straddle somewhere in here."
"6234630","6236410"," And I'm not going to expect too much movement today."
"6236830","6239990"," And any of the next is they're going to wait for FOMC. "
"6240790","6243050"," But you do know that we have volatility above, right?"
"6243710","6247550"," And you know that our next heavy support area is 4,600."
"6248290","6250010"," So I'm going to leave you guys with that this morning."
"6251190","6252470"," 11 a.m. Eastern time. "
"6252650","6254870"," Just recap what you think is happening currently with spy today."
"6254950","6255450"," If you can, please."
"6255550","6256290"," Okay, one more recap. "
"6256810","6258170"," Yes, stock picks entry points."
"6258190","6261430"," The market moves to screw those people at the same time."
"6261830","6263130"," That's why psychology is everything. "
"6263330","6263550"," Absolutely."
"6264010","6264870"," To an extent."
"6265330","6267270"," I think it's time and market that helps as well. "
"6267610","6271410"," So this is what you need to know heading into Tuesday or into Wednesday for today."
"6271470","6271710"," Okay."
"6272290","6276350"," You need to know that we have volatility between 4,600 and 4,600. "
"6276350","6282620"," The wall above right now is definitely 4, 6, 8, 2, 9."
"6283520","6289420"," You also want to know that the bottom right now is 4,600 or 4,600."
"6289780","6291220"," That is where bottom is right now."
"6291680","6298560"," Even if you're bearish, just know that you're going to see buyers stepping in here as we head into"
"6298560","6299080"," Wednesday. "
"6299480","6304300"," We could trade sideways to slightly down into into Wednesday."
"6304300","6312580"," If you see us trade down into Wednesday, let's say we have a quick file move down to 45 or"
"6312580","6313000"," 450."
"6313320","6318820"," Let's just say drum is very hockish and we sell down there. "
"6319300","6325140"," There are algorithms, banks and computers that are programmed to buy that level."
"6325480","6332420"," So you would expect a reaction move up anywhere from 4,650 to 4,500."
"6333560","6337260"," Do I expect JPOW to be ultra uber hockish into Wednesday?"
"6337880","6339260"," No, this market is manipulated. "
"6340200","6345820"," These people manipulate the market, the banks manipulate the market, the politicians manipulate the"
"6345820","6346120"," market."
"6347160","6353220"," And we have a market that's wound so tight right now with puts that if we do trade down into"
"6353220","6355680"," FMC, I am looking for a move higher."
"6356320","6359140"," Do I think we get a Christmas rally or no?"
"6359660","6362880"," Do I think we trade up from now into FMC?"
"6363220","6363760"," No, I don't. "
"6363860","6369000"," I think we trade sideways, maybe slightly down into FMC for where we are right now."
"6369380","6374580"," If we were to trade down to 4,600 between now and Wednesday, I would expect a violent reaction move"
"6374580","6376060"," up regardless of FMC."
"6377120","6380580"," Do I think that we're going to hit all time highs between now and FMC?"
"6380920","6381500"," Probably not. "
"6381500","6388260"," If we were at all time highs into FMC, I would be taking a heavy short into FOMC."
"6389220","6395820"," I try to play our support and resistance levels while being aware of the event that's in front of"
"6395820","6395960"," us."
"6396820","6400160"," I'm going to look for the VIX at FOMC as well. "
"6400340","6402820"," The VIX is trading at 30 or higher into FOMC."
"6403660","6406100"," I'm going to be looking to take along at FOMC."
"6406980","6410160"," At either 4,600 or 4,500. "
"6410660","6412140"," So I try to pair the two together, right?"
"6412600","6418520"," News that we know is coming and pair that with established support and resistance levels."
"6419220","6424760"," And then I'm also watching BookMap to see if the bags step in to buy at those levels."
"6425000","6429680"," If I see them buy, I'm going to follow that liquidity on the buy or sell side. "
"6432040","6433120"," Wait, market is manipulated."
"6434700","6435620"," Can you look at HUD?"
"6435820","6436440"," Yeah, I can look at HUD."
"6437100","6438580"," I can look at HUD for you guys. "
"6439060","6441480"," The market moves to screw people the most at the same time."
"6441640","6441720"," Yep."
"6442380","6444280"," Can we look at the HUD?"
"6444720","6445080"," Absolutely. "
"6445320","6446020"," I can look at HUD for you."
"6451350","6452810"," I did have this one charted out."
"6452950","6453950"," I don't know why I got rid of it. "
"6455570","6461030"," Maybe I charted this on, did I chart HUD on trading view?"
"6461030","6465530"," I might have charted it here on trading view."
"6466070","6466430"," Yep."
"6468750","6471710"," So I did chart HUD on trading view. "
"6472510","6474630"," Okay, so let's talk about HUD real quick."
"6476570","6477050"," Robinhood."
"6477050","6480950"," So let's talk about Robinhood here. "
"6481450","6483050"," You guys can see this chart, I hope."
"6489170","6490190"," I'll wait here for you guys."
"6490870","6493870"," So here's my take on Robinhood for any of you guys out here. "
"6493870","6494070"," Okay."
"6495030","6497270"," And so this is a stop loss right here."
"6497390","6499390"," This blue line is a stop loss on Robinhood. "
"6501520","6502720"," You guys can see this."
"6503220","6511140"," This is where you, when you break below Robinhood, this is where banks, this is where diamond hand"
"6511140","6513520"," holders sold their position."
"6514340","6516240"," This $37.96 level. "
"6516580","6518220"," It's interesting that you can see this here too."
"6518340","6519540"," This is how it's actually played out."
"6520180","6524460"," So this is where you have lockouts come into play. "
"6524460","6528300"," You have, so when a company IPOs, there's a few things."
"6528500","6537100"," When a company IPOs, they start selling this stock really cheap to their favorite investors, to"
"6537100","6541420"," people with money, people with high net worths, that can help launch these companies."
"6542960","6547820"," You have different lockout periods for when people can sell for when they get in. "
"6548440","6552700"," So you've got some people that are holding Robinhood probably down at four or five dollars."
"6553280","6554380"," You're not going to believe that."
"6554500","6555620"," That is the actual case. "
"6555940","6562920"," You will see an initial people that are seating, seating these IPOs at very low numbers."
"6562920","6566220"," And you've got different lockout periods for certain holders."
"6566220","6573160"," I wouldn't be surprised that if there are still initial investors, they have like tears to when you"
"6573160","6574560"," can buy into an IPO. "
"6575420","6580860"," And some of the lockout periods are brutal, six months, a year, sometimes even longer."
"6581080","6584400"," Employees of companies, sometimes they have have even longer periods."
"6585460","6589880"," So what you're really seeing right here is you're seeing the selling right here. "
"6590300","6595980"," This is people that are out of their lockout periods, and they're selling out of their positions."
"6596320","6598060"," How low does Robinhood go?"
"6598800","6602160"," In all honesty, it's probably near some form of a bottom."
"6602800","6605600"," It's probably going to level out somewhere here at the 20th. "
"6605600","6611500"," When you start to get this low on a stock, you're looking for hard numbers, like 20, 15, 10."
"6612500","6615380"," Not always 15, but 10 would be a hard support."
"6615900","6619880"," 20 would be a hard support for IPOs. "
"6621660","6625220"," You need to look at Robinhood like you'd look at Viacom right now."
"6627020","6630920"," Viacom, well, maybe Viacom is not the best one to look at, the best comparison."
"6630920","6635760"," But Robinhood is what Facebook is actually a good one. "
"6636020","6638000"," A good stock to compare Robinhood to."
"6639040","6643400"," Robinhood, no matter what you're hearing in the news, no matter what the news is feeding you about"
"6643400","6646440"," Robinhood, Robinhood has one major issue."
"6647400","6648760"," One major issue. "
"6649540","6650920"," And it's just rebranding."
"6652100","6659900"," It's having the CEO step aside, believe it or not, it's having the CEO replaced or to just step"
"6659900","6666700"," aside, to have Vlad step aside because he's poisonous to the public reputation of the company."
"6667500","6675180"," And the second point would be to repackage it, rebrand it, add some charting, better charting and"
"6675180","6680300"," less sucking in new traders, right?"
"6680740","6681420"," Just a rebrand. "
"6681900","6685220"," If you rebranded Robinhood, you would see it skyrocket."
"6685220","6689280"," It would skyrocket to 50 in a day."
"6689700","6692020"," 75, 100 within three months. "
"6692880","6696560"," So the big question is, where is bottom on Robinhood?"
"6697560","6700580"," You're looking for the, you're going to start charting."
"6700700","6701700"," We can chart it right now."
"6701800","6703260"," I can give you guys some hearts on these. "
"6703980","6704740"," Hold on a second here."
"6709920","6714380"," When you start to see us, and you can see this blue light I had previously charted this stock as,"
"6714580","6717320"," this is where you cut, this is your stop loss down here."
"6717320","6721040"," And you guys want to know where hard, hard bottoms are. "
"6721480","6725740"," When you start to drop like this, you can measure, you can measure moves."
"6725760","6729740"," You can measure this move right here if you wanted to and see how deep it would go."
"6730160","6732300"," But this measured move isn't really going to work for you. "
"6732660","6733740"," So it really isn't."
"6734020","6735320"," So what you're looking for is this, okay?"
"6736280","6741200"," On Robinhood, you want to say to yourself, where am I comfortable owning Robinhood at?"
"6741640","6741860"," Okay."
"6742560","6746680"," So you know that you've got a hard stop at somewhere around 20 bucks. "
"6750400","6754300"," You know, this is going to be Robinhood's going to want to come back to $20."
"6755020","6757040"," Well, you guys don't know that it's going to want to come back."
"6757860","6762820"," You guys are going to want to chart though at the $10 market is going to be another big"
"6762820","6765660"," psychological moment for it. "
"6766700","6767120"," Right?"
"6767480","6769340"," We've broken below $20 here."
"6769800","6772080"," You can see already that we were just broken below."
"6772580","6777140"," You know that we're going to that the market or the hedge funds are going to try to short Robinhood"
"6777140","6777400"," down. "
"6777400","6781260"," You know that we're looking for capitulation, which we haven't seen yet."
"6781740","6785340"," You want capitulation from holders that last breath."
"6785920","6788800"," You're looking for that last moment where you see a giant red bar. "
"6790000","6791520"," Panic sell out of that position."
"6792220","6794000"," And then you're going to see a giant green bar."
"6794120","6795400"," Those are called hammer candles. "
"6795960","6802120"," When you see those hammer candles, you know, you typically know that the selling has stopped."
"6802320","6805520"," You want to see that big giant red bar, that big giant green bar."
"6806120","6812440"," For the for a reversal, at least for a moment for a moment, one to three months. "
"6814140","6818800"," You can see above here, it's struggling to sell down at the $20 level."
"6819680","6822640"," So where are you going to set your alert set?"
"6822920","6827540"," You're going to set your alerts to buy at $15 or slightly above."
"6828060","6830520"," You probably set an alert over here for. "
"6832320","6833200"," Dash line."
"6834840","6837360"," Let's go down to a smaller time frame here."
"6840420","6843080"," You can even see this better, a smaller time frame. "
"6843560","6846000"," So you can already see they were trading lower here in 1911."
"6846780","6849460"," You might you can dollar cost average in here."
"6849640","6853880"," If you feel good owning Facebook at 20, you can dollar cost average. "
"6854280","6856980"," I would start watching here at the $20 level."
"6857020","6861400"," This would be the first alert that I would set at 20 and start watching it."
"6861400","6865620"," And I'm going to watch it for for a few things to happen. "
"6865620","6865920"," Okay."
"6866960","6872700"," Just like the other chart that I did, you're looking for to begin to break."
"6876240","6879280"," Through this resistance on a small time frame right here. "
"6879280","6880240"," This is all you're looking for."
"6880860","6885920"," You're looking for Robin Hood."
"6887460","6892900"," To consolidate sideways and at least break through this last month period. "
"6893620","6896360"," Of falling right you're looking for sideways movement."
"6896800","6902900"," A break above fine support on a localized resistance and then start to move higher to take a"
"6902900","6903300"," position."
"6903680","6905120"," That's what you should be doing. "
"6905560","6907860"," So right now I'd start watching it for consolidation."
"6908680","6914780"," If not, I'm going to expect it to continue to sell off down to 15 and further down to the"
"6914780","6915520"," $10 mark."
"6915520","6919800"," Be aware of this when you're trading actual stock or looking to catch knives. "
"6919800","6922120"," You're looking for this upper resistance."
"6923080","6928260"," Or you're looking for a stoppage with a giant red candle, giant green candle."
"6928520","6929760"," Then you're looking for consolidation. "
"6930880","6935420"," Then you're looking for to make a leg over over resistance."
"6936340","6939980"," The major resistance and even just a small time frame like this."
"6941000","6948160"," Once it finds support above here, you can take a long here for for for where sellers are trapped"
"6948160","6948600"," above. "
"6949260","6950820"," And it'll start to make its way."
"6951000","6954940"," It should start to to to absorb these sellers."
"6955560","6958820"," But you know you've got sellers hiding above at $37 right now. "
"6959120","6963600"," You know you've got sellers hiding above at $43, $46, $50, $60."
"6964180","6966100"," It's got a lot of work to do ahead and ahead of itself."
"6966940","6969660"," And what you're really looking for is an event trigger. "
"6970740","6972160"," To take on Robin Hood."
"6972480","6976720"," So if you're like, well, I'm waiting for that event trigger or rebranding a Robin Hood, maybe a CEO"
"6976720","6979700"," replacement, then you're waiting to buy down below."
"6979940","6983000"," You're waiting or you're waiting to feel comfortable and where you're buying. "
"6983660","6984880"," So maybe enter here at 20."
"6985640","6987960"," You dollar cost average down to $10."
"6988660","6989840"," You start with a small position. "
"6990420","6992740"," You increase your positions as it falls lower."
"6993380","6999320"," If you're going to hope for a rebrand, then you're going to start buying leaps that are at least"
"6999320","7000620"," one to two years out."
"7001620","7008200"," And you're or you're going to be buying stock with that intention of holding for anywhere from one"
"7008200","7008980"," to three years out. "
"7009660","7013560"," Because Vlad, if Vlad doesn't give up the reins or rebrand the company."
"7015320","7018620"," You're not going to see this stock move much until that happens."
"7019220","7019520"," You're waiting. "
"7019780","7020760"," You're waiting for that news."
"7021160","7021660"," We all know it."
"7021860","7022340"," I know it. "
"7022440","7022860"," You know it."
"7023240","7024200"," We all know it out there."
"7025560","7026020"," Yeah. "
"7026220","7027760"," Uber is stacked 5% this morning."
"7027760","7029680"," I called that trade yesterday."
"7029700","7030340"," Didn't I?"
"7030480","7031200"," Let me look back at it. "
"7031360","7031680"," Uber."
"7032820","7034380"," Think I talked about over yesterday."
"7035560","7036980"," Let's see where it was at. "
"7037120","7038620"," They lose 5% yesterday though."
"7039100","7040180"," Hello ladies."
"7040780","7041520"," Whoo hoo. "
"7042080","7042380"," Go."
"7042920","7043100"," Uber."
"7046660","7048860"," I think I called that trade yesterday. "
"7049800","7051340"," Did I call that trade yesterday?"
"7053780","7054340"," Joe."
"7054680","7054800"," Joe."
"7055080","7055440"," Joe. "
"7055440","7055560"," Joe."
"7055660","7056840"," Did I call Uber yesterday?"
"7057340","7058760"," I swore I called that trade yesterday."
"7060200","7061960"," I swear I put that trade out there. "
"7064000","7065260"," I swear I did."
"7067290","7068230"," So I've got this."
"7068790","7070570"," I've got this resistance above here. "
"7070690","7071790"," That resistance is probably lower."
"7072490","7075450"," I might want to cut your trade out at 3833 this morning."
"7078530","7079690"," Yeah, baby. "
"7081770","7083810"," I did put that trade out there yesterday."
"7083810","7086410"," I think I even put a few different charts out there for it too."
"7086830","7088110"," Kind of went deep on that one. "
"7088650","7089330"," Look at that."
"7089610","7089710"," Uber."
"7090790","7091370"," That's crazy. "
"7093110","7094230"," Makes me so stoked."
"7096130","7099430"," I haven't checked anything this morning."
"7100070","7102230"," I'm just hanging out with you guys at this point. "
"7102990","7104770"," But watching the Uber reaction this morning."
"7105430","7105770"," That's epic."
"7106830","7107070"," That's crazy. "
"7109590","7111170"," Making me giggle right now."
"7111170","7111710"," Seeing Uber."
"7113210","7114150"," I have others. "
"7115230","7116370"," I have others."
"7116650","7118550"," I think I haven't checked FCX yet."
"7118790","7121050"," FCX, I think FCX already made its move yesterday. "
"7122870","7124330"," I think I put FCX out there."
"7124470","7125150"," Look at FCX."
"7125870","7126390"," Yeah, baby. "
"7127210","7128110"," I knew this was happening."
"7129250","7129550"," Yes."
"7132730","7134650"," These were all the trades I put out yesterday. "
"7135750","7136510"," This is crazy."
"7137470","7140430"," I put FCX out there yesterday."
"7140430","7141690"," I put a few others. "
"7141870","7143110"," They got to go back and check all these trades."
"7144130","7145130"," Holy shit."
"7147850","7148350"," Yes. "
"7152910","7153410"," Yes."
"7154970","7155950"," This is crazy."
"7157310","7159230"," I put all these trades out yesterday for you guys. "
"7162290","7163530"," Look at FCX."
"7165940","7168080"," Look at FCX."
"7169360","7171560"," It's like a daddy being proud right now. "
"7173880","7176080"," There's 70 of you paying attention right now."
"7176080","7176720"," This is crazy."
"7177700","7181040"," I want you guys to go and talk about this on Twitter. "
"7182100","7183420"," I called these yesterday."
"7188000","7188860"," This is crazy."
"7190080","7191080"," This is insane. "
"7192720","7194960"," I bet some of you guys are scared shitless."
"7195160","7197800"," They'll go out into that clothes without a doubt."
"7198100","7198700"," And look at their printing. "
"7200100","7201220"," They're printing today."
"7203000","7203960"," That's awesome sauce."
"7207020","7207740"," Awesome sauce. "
"7208280","7208780"," This is crazy."
"7209560","7213460"," I got a grin from one side of my face to the other right now."
"7214860","7217340"," I'm going to grin from one ear to the other. "
"7219060","7219960"," This is insane."
"7220600","7221420"," This is so stupid."
"7224110","7225290"," This is so stupid. "
"7227890","7228410"," This is wild."
"7229890","7232150"," Yeah, you know, try to give both sides to trades."
"7232530","7233690"," If you're a bear, listen to this. "
"7233930","7235490"," I go bear all the time."
"7235490","7238950"," And I try to give both sides to trades."
"7239210","7244670"," But if you hear me with conviction putting trade out there, there's a 70% chance it's going to play"
"7244670","7245310"," out there. "
"7246130","7248310"," I don't just make these plays up out of my ass."
"7248410","7251810"," I usually do a lot of research before I put them out there for you guys."
"7252870","7256810"," They should print about 70% of the time they should print. "
"7257150","7263990"," You might lose three out of 10, but seven out of the head of those plays are based in some"
"7263990","7270110"," pretty half an hour, hour of me looking digging to find out if they should, they should print."
"7274660","7275060"," Yeah."
"7278260","7278740"," Yeah. "
"7279080","7279280"," Yeah."
"7279800","7280620"," This is insane."
"7280800","7283160"," I'm so stoked right now that this made my whole week. "
"7284280","7286020"," This made my whole week without a doubt."
"7287180","7289000"," So be careful on Uber up here guys."
"7289580","7290700"," Let's go back to Uber real quick. "
"7290700","7299580"," I think there's calls out there at the 40 or 42 and a half or 40."
"7299780","7300200"," I can't remember."
"7301360","7302360"," I'd have to take a look. "
"7304840","7306700"," You're going to find some resistance above here."
"7306800","7307980"," We'll show it at a bigger chart here."
"7309440","7311700"," Well, then I doubt you're going to be looking for resistance above. "
"7312000","7316760"," It could possibly break above these guys are going to want their calls to print at 40 or 42, but"
"7316760","7317680"," expect volatility."
"7318300","7324620"," You want to be looking inside your options chain, taking profit, looking for jump above 38, 33, and"
"7324620","7325860"," possibly taking it long again."
"7326920","7330200"," So you're going to see that as we approach over now six percent. "
"7330580","7331320"," Yeah, baby."
"7333790","7334690"," This is insane."
"7335550","7336870"," I always love this stuff. "
"7337190","7337930"," I kid you guys not."
"7340240","7343740"," Do I think I see a spy seeing for 60 today?"
"7344180","7346080"," Remember that you're going to see resistance above here."
"7346120","7348320"," You can always cut your lungs loose here. "
"7348680","7351020"," Jump back in and take them up to 40 or 42."
"7351020","7357660"," You want to see it break through 38, 33, and you want to see it find some form of support."
"7358140","7359480"," You're looking back on yesterday. "
"7359840","7364220"," We've broken yesterday's high and we've just broken the previous day is high."
"7364920","7365660"," You see that right?"
"7365900","7369040"," We've got you've got the 13th right here in the 10th."
"7369040","7369540"," This is Fridays. "
"7370420","7371980"," We've broken through both of these."
"7372200","7374000"," You're going to find resistance right here."
"7374060","7377240"," This is where you would be like, boom, I'm taking some profit here. "
"7377600","7381680"," I'm going to wait for the bull or for the banks to send us over and then take along to"
"7381680","7382840"," 40 or even 42."
"7383580","7386740"," I'll bring this out of the one month here so you can see."
"7387060","7392540"," You can see it a larger timeframe right here. "
"7392640","7393840"," You're going to be looking for this resistance."
"7393840","7395220"," Got broken right here."
"7395660","7397500"," Talk about this downtrend, right?"
"7398320","7407380"," You're going to be looking for resistance at 39 and you're going to be looking for resistance. "
"7408760","7411320"," That's of course $40 above here."
"7412200","7413920"," See that to the pin right there?"
"7414100","7420500"," That 38, that 38, that 38 22 resistance point."
"7420960","7422420"," Let me bring you guys back down here. "
"7422900","7423840"," This one I already had to."
"7423960","7424780"," This is right to the pin."
"7425420","7427040"," 38 33 right to the pin. "
"7428120","7430680"," You're going to wait for the banks to take it over."
"7431320","7433980"," You can ride it back up again and again as we move forward."
"7436340","7437220"," Have you charted Tesla?"
"7437520","7437940"," You can review. "
"7438920","7440500"," I have charted Tesla Raptor."
"7440500","7442040"," I think I brought it up even earlier."
"7442760","7444260"," You are looking for. "
"7449570","7450930"," Let's take a look down here."
"7462450","7468190"," You should know for Tesla today that we have a hedge that you should expect volatility in Tesla"
"7468190","7468730"," today."
"7469410","7471430"," At the 950 mark. "
"7471770","7474070"," So in which is right where we're right we are right now."
"7474510","7475470"," We're at 954."
"7476390","7479490"," There was a hedge put on yesterday at 950 on Tesla. "
"7480010","7485090"," If volume if if liquidity is coming into the market, you're going to look for a squeeze situation"
"7485090","7486850"," on Tesla."
"7487490","7490830"," And you're going to look at hard resistance somewhere above here."
"7491730","7493290"," Let's move this down. "
"7493730","7494370"," That's the high."
"7494630","7495170"," That's the high."
"7495730","7501210"," You're going to look for a squeeze conditions on Tesla at this point because their hedge was at"
"7501210","7501690"," 950. "
"7502810","7505610"," We'll meet our first resistance point at 962."
"7506250","7508730"," The next resistance point is going to be 977."
"7508730","7513770"," And then our three is going to be at 999 one. "
"7514290","7516650"," If you were to break through 999 one."
"7517090","7522190"," You're talking about a serious move up to 1043 above here."
"7522670","7523890"," Do I think we get that high?"
"7524130","7524570"," Probably not. "
"7525330","7526290"," Probably not."
"7526910","7527490"," You're going to look."
"7527750","7529570"," You've got you've got bears up here. "
"7529770","7532290"," So the bears are not bears with the banks right now."
"7532990","7537610"," They are their their hedges down below here at 950."
"7537610","7539150"," So this is volatility. "
"7539910","7542630"," This is where the sellers are trying to get out of their positions."
"7543350","7547450"," You have trapped buyers over here at this 977."
"7547770","7548690"," I said 977. "
"7549090","7549370"," It's lower."
"7549710","7551630"," It's like 97469."
"7552310","7554430"," You also have trapped buyers over here. "
"7554590","7555790"," You guys need to think like this."
"7556010","7558030"," Think where the buyers come in and get trapped in their moves."
"7558650","7562010"," More buyers came in and got trapped from sellers selling out. "
"7562730","7564610"," And you're going to see all these sellers."
"7564610","7565670"," I said buyers but I mean sellers."
"7566190","7571210"," You've got buyers down below and they're trying to sell out of their longs up here because they're"
"7571210","7571450"," trapped. "
"7571750","7572170"," They're fearful."
"7573090","7577290"," You're looking for liquidity to come into the market and absorb those sellers when there isn't"
"7577290","7579470"," enough liquidity that's going to head lower."
"7580110","7583290"," So locally you already know that some you've got these people. "
"7583590","7588290"," Let's say they bought the market on the 13th and we immediately started selling down."
"7588370","7589850"," So what are they saying to themselves right now?"
"7589930","7595190"," They're saying please please please just go up to 974 so I can get out of my bad trade right"
"7595190","7595510"," now."
"7596610","7598550"," So you've got that aspect going on right. "
"7599050","7604850"," And then you've got the next aspect which is a bunch of banks put a hedge on and then you're"
"7604850","7606950"," looking for liquidity to enter the market."
"7607690","7609530"," That would be the recipe for a squeeze."
"7610090","7615370"," That would be the recipe for us for longs to get our sellers to get absorbed and for the banks"
"7615370","7616190"," to push us up. "
"7616630","7618770"," But looking at FOMC on Wednesday."
"7619610","7621110"," It's a very volatile day."
"7621110","7624210"," So do we get liquidity between now and Wednesday?"
"7624730","7631050"," Probably not enough to make us go to break through this upper resistance way up here at 1000. "
"7631650","7634230"," More than likely we're going to trade up."
"7634430","7638390"," We'll meet volatility trade sideways and possibly sell down into Wednesday."
"7639530","7641150"," I know that's not what you want to hear. "
"7641790","7642170"," I'm a festival."
"7642470","7645850"," I know if I don't say to you guys is going to 1000 I'm a bear."
"7646730","7647090"," I know that. "
"7647250","7649430"," I know if I don't say we're going to 1000 today I'm a bear."
"7651940","7655020"," But do you see that made you call uber Patrick?"
"7655020","7656060"," Good question, Patrick."
"7656620","7659080"," So that's a great question. "
"7659420","7665140"," And when I do my or I give you guys stock picks, specifically stock picks, but sometimes indexes."
"7667560","7670100"," I am I first look at news, right?"
"7670340","7671940"," All right, make sure that I'm looking at news."
"7672940","7676380"," I make sure that I'm buying on lows and not highs. "
"7677640","7679280"," Then I'm looking for."
"7679280","7682820"," So I'm looking for general market conditions."
"7683160","7686780"," I'm looking for any events that are coming up news that are coming up and make sure that we're on"
"7686780","7687060"," lows. "
"7687540","7688380"," I don't like buying tops."
"7688640","7689800"," I like buying low and selling high."
"7690800","7692500"," I like selling my position. "
"7693900","7695720"," To a foable."
"7697100","7704900"," And then I'm also looking for algorithmic markers in the background."
"7705200","7707960"," I'm looking for those reversal candles. "
"7708180","7710500"," I'm looking for dark pool activity."
"7711200","7714620"," I'm looking for where a hedge is on a stock."
"7715300","7718380"," I'm looking to make sure that it's in positive or negative gamma. "
"7719360","7722040"," I'm looking in this is interesting."
"7722040","7726480"," If the hedge is high on a stock, it'll move much more slowly over time."
"7726740","7728620"," I'll know that I need to put more time on calls. "
"7728640","7732480"," Let's say if the hedge is very tight."
"7733020","7735200"," Or below where the stock is at."
"7735800","7738380"," That's an opportunity for squeezing. "
"7738380","7740540"," If we have liquidity coming into the market."
"7741220","7743280"," So then I'm looking for that dark pool."
"7743280","7747560"," That's order flow into the physical underlying of that ticker. "
"7747800","7749360"," And then I'm looking for."
"7751120","7752740"," Previous puts that are printed."
"7753440","7757940"," And are still open and increased call volume. "
"7759300","7761860"," By large entities down the road."
"7762060","7765880"," And so, and I'm also looking for all of those calls we bought at the ask."
"7766560","7769420"," I'm looking for those to match stock order flow. "
"7770020","7773300"," I'm looking for signatures on those to come from large institutions."
"7774360","7776360"," And when I start to add all those pieces together."
"7777380","7782140"," I will come back to you guys and say this is setting up for move higher. "
"7784520","7785700"," I know it's a lot, isn't it?"
"7786120","7786780"," Put that out."
"7786980","7788600"," It's a lot to actually look that stuff up to."
"7788980","7791020"," It's pain in the ass, but it's worth every dollar. "
"7792500","7793680"," It really is."
"7797060","7798380"," Now you're welcome, Raptor."
"7798740","7800240"," I'll teach you guys this over time. "
"7800840","7803460"," We're going to go step by step on how to identify stocks."
"7804360","7806040"," We'll do what I'm starting you guys."

"7817660","7821920"," Then we're going to teach you how to set alerts for those by zones. "
"7822880","7826700"," We're going to tell you what to look for with those hammer candles."
"7827900","7829840"," How can you tell when institutions are buying?"
"7831280","7832340"," We need to pay you more."
"7832900","7837320"," Yeah, if you guys ever want to tip me on my Twitter page, I've got a little tip jar there"
"7837320","7839820"," or it's post of pinned to my. "
"7840500","7841700"," If I were to make you guys money."
"7842560","7845040"," If you guys don't have to pay me, I wanted to say that."
"7845180","7846660"," All right, you guys do not have to pay me. "
"7846920","7851160"," But if you guys are learning or if you guys are making money from my trades that I put on"
"7851160","7851880"," Twitter."
"7852980","7854280"," You want to share some with me?"
"7854380","7857200"," I understand that because I have tipped other guys for doing that same thing."
"7857600","7858700"," People that have made me money. "
"7859300","7860020"," I want to tip them."
"7860300","7861060"," I want to spread the wealth."
"7861580","7862800"," I know how I know that feeling. "
"7863320","7864160"," I know how it feels."
"7864900","7865360"," And you do."
"7865460","7866760"," You want to share that with other people. "
"7867420","7868440"," I've been there a hundred times."
"7869300","7872960"," But I'll never ask you guys to pay or force you guys to pay."
"7873200","7874180"," You guys will never get that from me. "
"7874720","7876220"," I know that a lot of you guys are new out there."
"7876620","7877120"," Just learning."
"7877120","7881100"," And also in this stream I've got in the description. "
"7881460","7883700"," There's a way to tip me as well."
"7884020","7886840"," I don't have the super chat and all that stuff yet."
"7887080","7889680"," I'm working on getting the I knowledgeable for it. "
"7889760","7891760"," I just haven't done the work for you."
"7891760","7894240"," I've been too busy to be begging for money."
"7894760","7896760"," The way that I'm begging for money too is like. "
"7897320","7898280"," It's like the most."
"7899980","7902340"," It's it's not I could be aggressive about it."
"7902380","7903020"," And I just I'm not. "
"7903380","7904080"," I'll get there."
"7904080","7907280"," I don't have the time right now to at least put an easy button for you guys to hit."
"7907560","7908140"," I'm sorry. "
"7909920","7910580"," Too funny."
"7911520","7912440"," Too too funny."
"7913520","7915400"," Okay, so we're going to start basics. "
"7915780","7917260"," We're just going to start with basic charting."
"7917480","7918460"," We're going to start with where it is."
"7918560","7921060"," How to set alerts in a in a in a brokerage. "

"7932440","7934480"," for for order flow in the background. "
"7935000","7936760"," What you're looking for for market conditions."
"7937460","7939960"," What you're actually looking for for news on a company."
"7940400","7943400"," You don't really want to be playing the actual earnings reports. "
"7944100","7950160"," You want to be playing the the accumulation phases of other bulls that are playing earnings"
"7950160","7950640"," reports."
"7950680","7957080"," You want to be buying the bottom of the run to earnings and collect the premium on that run."
"7957500","7959480"," You want to be the first guy buying the bottom. "
"7959480","7965480"," You want to see other bulls coming into the market and sell to them for profit."
"7966640","7973720"," You want people to be screaming at you while you're not long a stock and you tell them, well, I"
"7973720","7978680"," bought 20 points ago, 100 points ago and I sold it to you."
"7979260","7980500"," You want to be that guy. "
"7980840","7982560"," You don't ever want to be the FOMO guy."
"7983020","7983540"," Too much risk."
"7983940","7984840"," You will blow up your accounts. "
"7985160","7985480"," I promise."
"7987570","7989690"," You should do an online class like an hour a week."
"7989690","7990930"," I think I should, Brandi. "
"7991850","7994950"," I need to pay thanks, Chas."
"7995910","7997350"," How did you start trading?"
"7998290","8001110"," You should do an online class like an hour a week before."
"8001390","8008770"," Brandi, I need to sit down and schedule out or I need to start to hammer down a schedule of"
"8008770","8013190"," what I'm offering so that you guys come to expect certain things for me. "
"8013750","8015590"," Like you're expecting a live stream at this time."
"8016050","8017730"," You're expecting us to do stocks on Sundays."
"8017730","8020350"," You're expecting maybe a class once a week. "
"8020730","8021430"," Let's do that."
"8021930","8023830"," Let me try to hammer something like that out today."
"8024830","8026310"," How did I start trading?"
"8026910","8027990"," That's another great question. "
"8028590","8029630"," I started trading."
"8031770","8032370"," It's funny."
"8032690","8034550"," Every year I'm like, oh, five years ago. "
"8034890","8035650"," Oh, eight years ago."
"8035970","8036730"," Oh, 10 years ago."
"8037390","8040970"," I started trading in 2009, 2010. "
"8042710","8045030"," You might be wondering, how did I get into trading?"
"8045030","8050750"," I got into trading because I was a, I like Burning Man."
"8051090","8055530"," I was a part of the Occupy Wall Street movement way back."
"8056050","8062350"," I wasn't a part of the, of what it turned into and I wasn't really, I was more from the,"
"8062750","8064850"," I was a business owner, a small business owner. "
"8067130","8073570"," And in 2007, there were issues with our markets and with our economy."
"8073570","8075010"," And I was like a Main Street guy."
"8076650","8080310"," I owned high-end James Baird type restaurants. "
"8082710","8085010"," And I struggled in that time period."
"8085510","8086690"," And I was a burner."
"8086990","8088830"," I was, I was, I go to Burning Man and stuff like that. "
"8089230","8091550"," And I was, I would, I actively traded Bitcoin."
"8092190","8093630"," I was an early adopter of Bitcoin."
"8095130","8100730"," And I used it to, in my life, like anyways, I'm not going to get to that side of the"
"8100730","8103610"," story, but I was part of the Occupy Wall Street movement. "
"8103970","8108970"," And I knew that my future as a small business owner was in jeopardy."
"8109110","8113150"," I knew that my, my employees were struggling."
"8113230","8115330"," I knew that I couldn't offer certain things to my employees. "
"8115530","8116970"," And I was, I was very angry."
"8117250","8119470"," And I knew that even, even my work, right?"
"8119630","8127730"," So I've vested all of this money into offering a service to my community and providing a product."
"8127970","8129270"," And I was barely making ends meet. "
"8129270","8133730"," I would take in $3 million a year and I was, I wasn't breaking even."
"8134610","8135490"," I wasn't."
"8136030","8139570"," And there was just no way to, to make it all work. "
"8139930","8143370"," And so I had to resort to learning how to invest."
"8143810","8146890"," And how did I learn how to invest just by buying stocks?"
"8147630","8148110"," That's how I began."
"8148370","8149430"," I didn't know anything about options. "
"8150350","8153550"," And I didn't know anything about how to trade, where to buy."
"8154310","8156370"," I basically liked the stock and I bought it, right?"
"8156950","8158030"," I would say, ooh, I like this company."
"8158030","8166190"," And there's a famous trader that, or I think Peter, Peter, where the famous bear, he talks about"
"8166190","8166410"," that. "
"8167590","8168670"," So that's how I started."
"8169150","8175630"," And over the years, I expanded my, I traded futures, started trading options, started trading"
"8175630","8175870"," futures."
"8176450","8179170"," I was involved in Wall Street Bets when it, when it first became a subreddit. "
"8179990","8185710"," And there was a golden time in Wall Street Bets where there were true market professionals that"
"8185710","8193450"," were willing to trade and teach young traders how to trade for actual profit in the market."
"8194469","8200290"," This was during the rise of Twitter, but in reality, there was a group of, I don't want to use"
"8200290","8205170"," the terms for these people, but you had people like me that were not smart people and you had very"
"8205170","8207150"," smart people in Wall Street Bets."
"8207309","8209889"," This community was very, very small, just a few thousand. "
"8209889","8212510"," It grew up to like 15,000 at one point."
"8212690","8214350"," This was the golden time of Wall Street Bets."
"8214950","8221190"," And you really did have this beautiful moment where I was able to go under the training of other"
"8221190","8221430"," traders. "
"8221809","8223170"," We would have small conversations."
"8224969","8231950"," And late night, we would have small conversations and even smaller subreddits that were private."
"8232610","8236450"," I was a part of the Vegas Bets crew as well with Seder and all those guys. "
"8236990","8238590"," And they taught me how to trade."
"8238590","8240389"," These are guys from hedge funds."
"8241350","8242610"," And they taught me how to trade. "
"8243070","8248690"," And I went from blowing up accounts to blowing up bigger accounts to eventually."
"8249690","8250330"," Hey, Quinn."
"8251969","8252530"," How's it going?"
"8254760","8256139"," So yeah, I'll do it on my class. "
"8256340","8257480"," I'll figure that out for you guys."
"8258180","8260240"," Hey, Quinn, I didn't know that you just found the chat."
"8260940","8261480"," Good to see you, man. "
"8262299","8264620"," So we just did this big long live stream for this morning."
"8265660","8270959"," We, uh, all those shout outs for calls yesterday are printing heavy today."
"8273950","8274690"," Uh, yep. "
"8275010","8279430"," If you took that short at the opening bell today, you should start printing here down to 4,600."
"8282580","8283200"," It's crazy."
"8285860","8287900"," I'm glad you guys follow my calls out there. "
"8291389","8293590"," So anyways, that's where I learned how to trade."
"8293709","8295850"," I learned how to trade from Wall Street Bets before it blew up."
"8296070","8300030"," I was in on the GME trade when it was down around five bucks, 10 bucks. "
"8300030","8304389"," And I was in it at 25, then 500 or whatever it went to."
"8304490","8305870"," I think it was 480 or something stupid."
"8307290","8310549"," I'm currently blowing up accounts, but I think I'm almost done, Brandy. "
"8310930","8311270"," Yeah."
"8311610","8318030"," Uh, you will begin to stop blowing up accounts and you will begin to trade for profit at some"
"8318030","8318290"," point."
"8318670","8319309"," All that pay. "
"8319549","8321030"," There's one part about all of this."
"8321209","8325469"," I'm trying to show you guys and that is time and market really makes a difference."
"8325590","8329030"," The longer that you're a trader, the more that you can. "
"8329030","8334670"," Know what risk to take and not take the more time that you have in market."
"8335070","8336770"," You know how to balance risk."
"8337610","8341270"," You can see even this morning that I was able to close out of those weeklies. "
"8341690","8343969"," No loss broke even nothing."
"8344469","8347990"," And I made money on the, on the short and to close yesterday."
"8349570","8351190"," Quinn has entered the chat. "
"8351930","8356980"," What up Quinn dumps by dump Benjamin."
"8358620","8360660"," Where's my shout out to the devil?"
"8360980","8361900"," Quenny beat me."
"8362100","8362700"," Hey, cooked D."
"8363440","8364379"," Hey, Chaz. "
"8365180","8367400"," Hope you're all doing great."
"8367580","8368000"," Great today."
"8368719","8370639"," So we did a shout out right at the open twin. "
"8371120","8374260"," We shot out where to take a short on the spy and open today."
"8375760","8380120"," And we looked back on stock shout outs from yesterday that printed into the open today."
"8381020","8384920"," So if you took any of those trades on stocks yesterday, they printed today. "
"8387209","8391310"," We gave a shout out for where it's a short spy on the daily today."
"8391630","8392210"," We had some."
"8393170","8400490"," Some marks here at 463 466 and again to reenter at 464 for confirmation and ABC trade. "
"8400930","8408930"," It was a B C for confirmation that we're going down that we could be weak into tomorrow at 4600."
"8409430","8411010"," We could show that right here."
"8413220","8419240"," This would be what you're looking for down below, which we now and Wednesday, 4600 for a tag. "
"8419640","8423020"," Do I think that we aggressively sell off to 4500 into FMC?"
"8423580","8424300"," I doubt it."
"8424640","8430060"," But if we do, you're going to expect a major, a major reversal at FOMC."
"8432620","8434300"," Okay, so I'm going to log off here shortly. "
"8434600","8436220"," I have some coffee that's getting cold."
"8437000","8439780"," Did you guys have any other questions before I log off this morning?"
"8446580","8449300"," My four 35 fees are crushing it."
"8450660","8451100"," Hahaha. "
"8453340","8453780"," Hilarious."
"8454980","8458620"," Did you guys want me to just day trade with you all day long every day and tell you when"
"8458620","8459740"," to take short and go long?"
"8460720","8462080"," You guys will stop working."
"8462260","8463860"," You guys, I'll do this live and you guys. "
"8466840","8468980"," Yeah, the more time you exactly."
"8469920","8471620"," In Vasquez got this correct."
"8472240","8476060"," The longer you spend in the you can actually see this in my trade from yesterday. "
"8476780","8479180"," So I yesterday on Twitter, I told you guys."
"8479780","8485920"," I'm taking a, I took, I took a long put here at 55 cents, right?"
"8486720","8491400"," I told Quinn yesterday that I sold out of that position and then I had taken a long."
"8492500","8496420"," Now, I took that long based on a bunch of other crap, time and market. "
"8497200","8502840"," And even this morning for where I took that long, I was able to sell out of that long for"
"8502840","8504280"," Friday with no loss."
"8504280","8508080"," So I was able to take a free risk into the clothes."
"8508420","8510120"," By the way, I made money into the clothes. "
"8510560","8513760"," I took a free risk for the open today."
"8514200","8516880"," And even within that risk, I had enough time on it."
"8516920","8517980"," I didn't take a Wednesday call. "
"8518480","8522540"," I took a Friday call with a lot of interest in it and it didn't sell off."
"8522900","8525060"," So I'm able to unscrew myself right at the bell."
"8525520","8529660"," I talked to you guys what I thought would happen at the open today, which we did go up. "
"8529660","8532520"," And this gave you the chance to get out of those calls."
"8533040","8536700"," And then I even showed you the ABC and where to take a short into Wednesday."
"8537620","8538500"," Where does all that come from?"
"8539040","8540040"," And that was, that was what?"
"8540540","8545020"," That's 100% win rate and non failure between Friday and today. "
"8545580","8546800"," How do you learn how to do that?"
"8547460","8548560"," It's what Invesqua says."
"8548860","8549580"," It's time and market."
"8550460","8555140"," It's probability of what the moves are going to be in a short period of time. "
"8555140","8559240"," And you only get to know that stuff by trading for years."
"8560120","8561280"," Trade on trade."
"8561460","8564220"," You start by trading stock, then you move into options. "
"8565380","8567320"," I don't know why people don't start with spreads."
"8567620","8567860"," They should."
"8569240","8571060"," Everyone should start with basic spreads. "
"8571440","8575280"," They're more forgiving because you just need to know direction of market over time."
"8575900","8578440"," And then you should move into naked options."
"8578760","8579760"," They could put they could calls. "
"8581040","8586060"," To get riskier so that you can understand the danger in holding those positions without hedge."
"8586740","8590220"," And then over time you move down to day trading day trading is very lucrative."
"8590240","8591320"," You can make a ton of money. "
"8591760","8595200"," If you have time in market, you mostly win."
"8595700","8595920"," You do."
"8596080","8596520"," You really do. "
"8598280","8598900"," Thanks, Cap."
"8599340","8599980"," And you can see that."
"8600200","8601640"," I've been doing this live with you guys. "
"8601960","8604760"," This isn't like I know anything magic ball, crystal ball."
"8605020","8607960"," I'm telling you guys where the probability is the markets going here and there."
"8607960","8614180"," And then the risk that I'm putting on these trades versus the gain, the potential gains they'll"
"8614180","8614940"," make in these trades. "
"8616120","8616820"," Crazy right?"
"8617160","8618260"," You guys see me doing this shit live."
"8618440","8619840"," You guys, I know you guys have the stuff."
"8620100","8624380"," Well, it used to blow my mind, but I'm used to it now. "
"8626940","8628120"," Can't express how much a guy."
"8628260","8629740"," This is appreciated right on T-Chrone."
"8631120","8633300"," Yeah, so you know what we should do is start a class. "
"8634240","8636600"," We should start a class where you know, it's funny too."
"8636660","8637740"," Even if you're a long time trader."
"8638880","8640680"," I classes help even me. "
"8640820","8641880"," I take I read a lot."
"8642220","8645700"," I'm always trying to learn from other traders out there and investors out there."
"8645820","8647480"," Any insight that I can get from them. "
"8648180","8650720"," And maybe we should start a class that's just basic."
"8651060","8652680"," Like this is a stock."
"8652900","8654500"," This is what how you trade a stock. "
"8654660","8656240"," This is how you buy and invest with a stock."
"8657260","8659960"," And then this is how you begin to learn how to trade options."
"8661060","8664820"," This is the beginning because I don't really like options specifically. "
"8666380","8669580"," The way that the CME has set up the rules for you guys to trade."
"8669660","8675220"," Not see me, but the the SEC has set up rules for you."
"8675300","8676740"," You guys should only be allowed to trade. "
"8677440","8680580"," Believe it or not spreads as your start, not naked."
"8680980","8683400"," The fact that you can only trade naked calls and naked puts."
"8684240","8686560"," And then you only get three to five trades. "
"8686920","8688760"," I think it's what three or five trades a week or something."
"8689720","8692320"," Before you get in a 90 day period or something craze like that."
"8692320","8696660"," And then they lock you on if you don't have 30 grand or something 25 grand. "
"8696800","8699280"," I don't even remember what the amount is anymore."
"8700020","8703180"," But you should only be allowed to trade spreads."
"8703780","8707080"," Maybe one to three months out that are in a direction that you know it's going. "
"8707480","8708520"," It's the safest way."
"8710560","8713540"," Looks like looks like magic when you don't have all the tools."
"8713840","8715000"," Yeah, that's true. "
"8715520","8717720"," But you know, it's funny is I don't have the tools out right now."
"8718180","8721420"," I don't have I don't have any tools open on my."
"8721420","8723680"," My other laptop or this laptop. "
"8724160","8728000"," I'm trading all this by just the basic information that I give you guys."
"8728480","8731040"," I give you guys basic support resistance levels."
"8731500","8734540"," I'm giving you guys where negative and positive gamma is. "
"8735860","8739480"," And I'm not trading right now at this moment or even calling right now with."
"8739780","8741160"," I don't have book map open right now."
"8741260","8744160"," It takes a lot of processing power for me to run that and do a live stream. "
"8744500","8745600"," So it's off right now."
"8745840","8748600"," I don't have any any options flow on right now."
"8748600","8749800"," For you guys. "
"8750560","8753300"," And you can get free options flow to there."
"8753720","8758220"," You guys have some of you guys know about free options flow, but you can get free options flow and"
"8758220","8761200"," you can just subscribe to people on Twitter on Facebook."
"8761460","8762180"," I'm Wall Street. "
"8762180","8764540"," That's wherever that will provide you with that free flow."
"8765400","8767380"," Twenty five K is the minimum."
"8767960","8769640"," Almost got locked up over this. "
"8769840","8770360"," Yeah, it's weird."
"8770580","8771480"," That's the other crazy thing."
"8771800","8773480"," Just to stay on that topic real quick. "
"8774280","8778200"," It's crazy that that that the rules are that if you."
"8778960","8781660"," I don't know what the rules are right now, but three trades per week."
"8781660","8781960"," Okay. "
"8782700","8785500"," So let's say you get yourself into a bad trade."
"8786580","8787640"," Some bad trades."
"8788040","8790480"," You want to double down and believe it or not. "
"8790620","8790960"," You do."
"8791160","8795560"," You want to roll some trades and you want to just get out of some trades."
"8797380","8802640"," And I'm not going to explain now what the what those rem of or when to do that and when"
"8802640","8803400"," not to do that. "
"8805120","8809860"," But because there's max pain stuff involved in that there's reversal pain involved in that stuff."
"8810140","8812720"," There's time that that's matters if you're in the right trend."
"8813240","8816120"," But in reality, if you're in a bad trade, you need to get out of that trade. "
"8817080","8819380"," It's the three the three trade rule."
"8820080","8824720"," Is in the back of your mind telling you well, maybe I should just stick this out and it'll come"
"8824720","8825240"," my way."
"8826260","8830320"," That's how you blow up an account as a new trader with with a sub 25 account. "
"8831820","8834360"," I had one day trade last five days."
"8834640","8835420"," Yeah, that's brutal."
"8835960","8837080"," That is absolutely brutal. "
"8839280","8843740"," So I'll work on trying to get a better schedule for when I live stream."
"8844260","8848660"," Trying to get a tight schedule to do a stock."
"8849080","8852920"," Once a week, I'd like to do at least a at least a stock picker day. "
"8852920","8853700"," We pick stocks."
"8854260","8857420"," We chart them out and set alerts for them so that they come to you."
"8858260","8863440"," And then there will be let me just check something real quick here and make sure I got a hard"
"8863440","8866000"," number on that 460 if any of you guys are short right now. "
"8867420","8869000"," Let me give you a number."
"8876770","8878950"," Let me check some numbers for you."
"8886940","8888460"," Give me just a moment here. "
"8891870","8894150"," One standard deviation of 23 points."
"8894150","8900610"," The move to the implied move today so that all of you know is 23 points at the 20 foot"
"8900610","8903910"," 23 point swing range in the market."
"8906880","8909660"," And we should hit some resistance at. "
"8911900","8915060"," Well, I guess that range resistance would be 4617."
"8917020","8918620"," Just to give you a heads up on that."
"8928640","8930420"," So somewhere, yep, right here. "
"8930580","8933340"," So we should be hitting some form of resistance right here."
"8934060","8936140"," At 4617 right where we are."
"8937440","8941420"," This is the range expectation for today to 4617. "
"8941420","8942380"," So if you're short."
"8943340","8944880"," And you're on live with me right now."
"8945400","8950360"," That's what the implied move is now where is bottom down below here. "
"8950920","8954340"," It's it is it was at 4600."
"8954340","8957720"," And for 4500 is bottom."
"8958940","8960120"," For 50. "
"8960700","8965540"," But we do have a large Berg at this 460 number."
"8965940","8970460"," So you look for sellers to grind down at this point to 4600."
"8973510","8975670"," But this is the implied move for today. "
"8976990","8984410"," 4617 and swing above to 468.29. This is where the implied trading range is."
"8984410","8989590"," If you were to break below this implied trading range, your first stop is 4600."
"8990010","8991530"," And your second stop is 450. "
"8993870","8994910"," Probably 4550."
"9001420","9002740"," So let's say you're short."
"9004020","9006760"," You would get out of your shorts or puts here. "
"9007760","9009520"," And then you would pick them back up."
"9011120","9015660"," To go lower to 460 if you have the if you have those day trades."
"9021280","9022800"," See if you guys are asking me. "
"9023180","9025800"," You can do more than four trades per week if it's all cash."
"9026760","9030160"," Then you have to wait for that cash to clear before using so limits you."
"9030780","9033120"," Yeah, you there's some wonky stuff too. "
"9033220","9034780"," Right when you buy and sell a stock."
"9035960","9037360"," Under 25,000."
"9037660","9040620"," You're not give if you're not on a margin account, then you can't trade again. "
"9040620","9040860"," Right."
"9041000","9042280"," You have to wait like two days or something."
"9043140","9044820"," That's their goal to get people to hold. "
"9044820","9045280"," Yeah."
"9045720","9050220"," Benjamin, the rules right now are not set up to teach you how to be about a trader."
"9051220","9054700"," If you have a cash cut, you can trade as many times as you want using your available cash"
"9054700","9057280"," withdrawal coming into four, six already. "
"9057700","9058920"," So that is bound zone."
"9059660","9061400"," We're actually not at four, six, zero."
"9061820","9065160"," The conscience that we're at four, six, one point, seven, five. "
"9065720","9068480"," You're looking for us to eat through an iceberg."
"9068900","9069780"," I can't bring up my."
"9070780","9072640"," We're looking through to eat through. "
"9074160","9075820"," And I a bird right now."
"9075940","9080860"," I want to show this to you on one of my trading platforms, but I didn't realize that I had"
"9080860","9082500"," been automatically locked out of it."
"9082500","9087040"," And if I log back in while I'm on live with you, you'll see my login credentials. "
"9087800","9090720"," And I can't show you guys my login credentials, though I want to."
"9091200","9092420"," This is my point right here."
"9092860","9097640"," If we do find some support here and let's say this is where you want to be. "
"9097980","9099660"," So I want to talk to you guys as bears out there."
"9099740","9099920"," Okay."
"9100320","9101440"," It's an important rule for you guys. "
"9101440","9102780"," We might break through here."
"9103700","9109120"," But what this is doing to a put option is it's grinding out your winnings."
"9110600","9113540"," So you want to take your take your winnings at this point. "
"9114220","9117900"," And wait for the rest of the move to continue down."
"9118360","9122120"," You'll, you'll re enter the trade down to four, sixty."
"9122700","9128240"," Remove yourself from that trade again at support and wait to see if we settle in or if there's a"
"9128240","9128520"," reaction. "
"9136370","9139150"," This is the moment where you'd want to re enter the trade."
"9139630","9142810"," You want to see this break below resistant or support."
"9143670","9148030"," And you want to see us head down to hard support at four, six, oh five. "
"9149690","9151730"," Let me take a look, make sure that I've got that exact."
"9155220","9156340"," That's somewhere down here."
"9160340","9162820"," Maybe four, six, zero, five, one. "
"9164240","9167000"," Two, forty to a hard stop at forty six hundred."
"9168000","9169180"," Get that a little bit lower."
"9171390","9172530"," Add another one down here. "
"9197120","9200700"," We'll probably bounce up and keep heading down to four, six hundred."
"9209020","9210400"," See what you guys are talking about."
"9211320","9213420"," Thanks, everything cat made a donation the other day. "
"9213600","9214800"," Hey, thanks for the donation, Frederick."
"9214940","9215740"," I appreciate it."
"9216740","9221140"," Are you saying I should close my puts, but I'm only up thirty percent. "
"9221440","9221760"," Yes."
"9224220","9228440"," This, you can trade options without paying rules as long as you stay cash and don't use margin."
"9229520","9229960"," Cool. "
"9230680","9237020"," So this is, this is where, you know, if this, if this chart was upside down right now and you"
"9237020","9243160"," were a bull, I would be saying the same thing to you that you want to take profit at certain"
"9243160","9243640"," points."
"9244040","9246440"," There are lots of bulls out there and bears."
"9246680","9250420"," There are a lot of traders out there that will say to you, let your runners run. "
"9250420","9252840"," I always hear that, let your runners run."
"9253960","9263760"," And I think that the, that, that I think that that is misunderstood by, by new traders, what"
"9263760","9265860"," the actual implication of that is."
"9266380","9270820"," And it depends upon the tool that you're using. "
"9271500","9275900"," If you are looking at a trend over one month or one week."
"9276700","9278240"," Sure, you can let your runners run."
"9278240","9285940"," If you're trading, let's say an option that has zero intrinsic value, it's a zero date or one to"
"9285940","9288680"," three date has zero intrinsic value. "
"9289260","9298260"," That, that, that tool, that, that, that, that instrument is only good for the direction that you're"
"9298260","9299760"," heading in for that moment."
"9300320","9301400"," That's all it's good for."
"9301680","9304800"," So that put option is only good for this move. "
"9304800","9307320"," The moment it starts to move back up here."
"9307440","9310300"," You see this little stoppage down here, this little hammer candle."
"9310880","9315400"," This will probably continue to go down here or recover, be rejected and head lower. "
"9316000","9321460"," But this move right here, you only want to hold that put for this, for this period of time, capture"
"9321460","9324940"," that profit and look again to take another move lower."
"9328070","9332040"," Yeah, there's nothing wrong with like when you're taking gains, let's say in one day, right?"
"9332040","9333640"," So this move that just took place."
"9334140","9337360"," You make 80, 200% in this move, 130% in this move. "
"9338060","9339580"," You don't need to trade again today."
"9339920","9342480"," You can wait for the next awesome setup."
"9342920","9344660"," Like where is the next awesome setup?"
"9345060","9347200"," We had a great setup on this open right here. "
"9347420","9349140"," We knew exactly where to enter the trade."
"9349840","9354340"," We knew we had A, the B and the C down below here, even though we came back up over"
"9354340","9354560"," here."
"9354920","9358580"," We know where our, where our stop losses above, right?"
"9358740","9359660"," We talked about this earlier. "
"9360120","9361960"," We knew where we entered above here."
"9362720","9366940"," We knew that our stop loss was at four, six, six, even with this pull above."
"9367580","9369920"," We know that our stop losses still up here, right?"
"9370040","9373580"," So we've talked about this entire trade from the bell before we knew anything. "
"9373580","9374720"," We knew where this trade was."
"9375160","9379060"," We knew where down here to sell out of our trade, right?"
"9379220","9381100"," We start to call profit off from our trade."
"9381600","9384440"," And now we're looking to see where do we see it going next?"
"9385460","9385560"," Right?"
"9385820","9387380"," So what's the, what's the next trade?"
"9387860","9391680"," So we're going to be looking for a rejection above, right?"
"9392520","9394120"," We're going to be looking for this four, six. "
"9394300","9395760"," I already gave you the numbers this morning."
"9395920","9399300"," Or just now four, six, one, seven, five, it should be."
"9399780","9402940"," I've got it up here at eight, five, but it's, it's, it's seven, five. "
"9404950","9408710"," You're going to be looking for this or you're going to be looking for us to try to get back"
"9408710","9409110"," inside."
"9409630","9410310"," Let me show you guys this."
"9413030","9418470"," Our implied trading, our implied trading today is 32 points, I think I said. "
"9418470","9420710"," That brings us to four, six, eight, twenty nine."
"9421190","9425590"," And it brings us no lower than four, one, four, six, one, seven, five."
"9426170","9429850"," We're trying to fight to get back into this implied range right now. "
"9430190","9433690"," And we're looking for a rejection above at this implied range."
"9434490","9437310"," Now, let's say we reject off four, six, one point, seven, five."
"9437670","9444190"," You can take another short here down to forty, six hundred or possibly even forty five, fifty zero"
"9444190","9446690"," into the rest of today and into tomorrow. "
"9447970","9455530"," But you don't want to just stay in these plays because this is where traders lose money is they get"
"9455530","9455790"," fomo."
"9456550","9462170"," They get this like, fomation of the mouth and they say, we're going down to the depths of hell"
"9462170","9462470"," today."
"9463450","9471750"," And we may, we may three out of ten times, five out of ten times, but in reality, it's not"
"9471750","9472830"," seven out of ten times. "
"9472830","9474670"," It's not nine out of ten times."
"9475250","9483750"," So you want to take these things in stages so that you're consistently winning, keeping your profit"
"9483750","9486170"," and then waiting for the better."
"9486170","9487610"," So this was the better set up. "
"9488810","9493030"," This is the I'm a late bear to the market set up."
"9493450","9494370"," We already had it."
"9494510","9495530"," So we started this trade. "
"9496870","9498270"," Let's look at the five days."
"9500670","9503290"," So I know you bulls hear me say this all the time."
"9503710","9505230"," Trade started back here, right?"
"9505710","9509630"," Remember, we closed their lungs at the bell on the 10th. "
"9509910","9516110"," Remember, some bulls said I'm staying in for Monday and they didn't make their money, right?"
"9516330","9518750"," So if you'd taken this short off the bell, you made money."
"9519050","9520970"," If you took this short down here, you made money."
"9521510","9524410"," You take this short today at the open, you made money. "
"9524410","9531510"," You've got one, two, three, four, four shorts."
"9532770","9540950"," If you're a bear or a bull and you've won four shorts and you try to tell me down here"
"9540950","9542130"," that this is the place."
"9543310","9549650"," I'm going to say to you, why did you miss the first four shorts to need to go all in"
"9549650","9550350"," right here?"
"9550350","9556650"," So the point I'm trying to make to you is this is not the best short any longer down to"
"9556650","9558950"," 4,600 or even 4,500. "
"9559950","9561070"," Will it go down there?"
"9561270","9561670"," Sometimes."
"9562310","9564250"," Does it go down there nine out of 10 times?"
"9564550","9564610"," No."
"9565050","9567010"," Does it go out down there five out of 10 times?"
"9567410","9567490"," No. "
"9568370","9569970"," The move had already been made."
"9570590","9573950"," You should have taken this move at some point back here to make money."
"9574370","9577750"," And now you're going to wait for the market to decide where we go next. "
"9577750","9579590"," Does that help you guys?"
"9580050","9580670"," Probably not."
"9581090","9585610"," Any of you FOMO bulls and bears out there, I promise you, you will blow up your accounts and you"
"9585610","9587510"," will stop being a trader eventually."
"9588110","9588930"," It'll catch up to you. "
"9589210","9590090"," I guarantee it."
"9590730","9595490"," So you're you're looking to actually make these moves way before we get to this move here."
"9596630","9596870"," Okay. "
"9597650","9598690"," And so we're going to."
"9601650","9606110"," Yeah, you're trying to capture these moves way up here and not get stuck."
"9606110","9610230"," How many times have we told how many times over here did I tell you to take take hedging. "
"9610730","9611950"," Any guys want to answer me?"
"9612270","9615110"," How many times did I say had your positions over here?"
"9615650","9619470"," I said how many times 10 five posted like 18 times."
"9620090","9621890"," I didn't tell you to hedge your position here."
"9621930","9622270"," Did I?"
"9622990","9624830"," You should have already been hedged way up here. "
"9628100","9630940"," Okay, what do we got out with a hundred thirty eight percent?"
"9631140","9631660"," Good job Joe."
"9631880","9632740"," Take your profit and run."
"9632740","9634000"," I agree. "
"9634580","9637980"," When you see moves like this, this is the end of the move that we're at right here."
"9639500","9643420"," Even if we even if we get out of forty five hundred down here, the moves already been made."
"9646260","9647540"," Don't want to chart donut. "
"9647680","9647880"," Sure."
"9648040","9648840"," I can do that for you Joe."
"9650900","9653960"," Hey, Cap, any thoughts on Facebook also loving the live stream. "
"9654360","9655060"," It's great hearing your voice."
"9655240","9655320"," Thanks."
"9655820","9656580"," Thank you, King Kyle. "
"9657920","9658940"," Yep, Joe donut."
"9659620","9660400"," Yes, helps."
"9660700","9661940"," I blew up an account that way. "
"9662120","9662560"," Yeah, Chase."
"9662560","9664620"," Like you don't want to be."
"9666080","9669560"," Well, you know the the hedge should be able to cover what you're long in. "
"9669800","9674260"," You have to calculate your hedge at least covering what your long is."
"9675840","9679360"," If you're going to stay long, if you're just cash, then you don't need to hedge."
"9680840","9683120"," You want to be always buying your hedges at tops. "
"9683380","9685480"," You always want to be buying your lungs at bottoms."
"9686800","9690100"," You don't want to be entering short here."
"9690820","9692920"," This is not the place to be entering short. "
"9693660","9695340"," Place the entering short is up here."
"9696200","9699360"," The place to be going long is somewhere between here."
"9699740","9700480"," We can even look at it. "
"9702080","9702780"," Right here."
"9703400","9704560"," This is where the long is."
"9705420","9709060"," So if you're looking at where we are, we're at the bottom two thirds of a short. "
"9709940","9712520"," So you're looking to take long down here."
"9713260","9715380"," You're looking for either the perfect setup."
"9716200","9720080"," You're either looking for matter of fact, there's probably a sweet long into Friday down here right"
"9720080","9720340"," now. "
"9720700","9726940"," Somewhere down here is probably a sweet entry on dirt cheap calls on Friday expiry for the spy."
"9728100","9732780"," Well, you know that somewhere down here is a really good price or entry into."
"9734200","9736480"," Into going against the FOMC. "
"9737700","9739280"," Maybe you guys can see the start to see."
"9739280","9741640"," When I say, oh, I want 46 hundred real bad."
"9742620","9743920"," I want to buy 46 hundred. "
"9743980","9745380"," You guys have me say that on Twitter all the time."
"9745380","9746400"," I want to buy 46 hundred."
"9747760","9748160"," Right. "
"9748920","9751020"," This is where a bull starts to get greedy."
"9751420","9755660"," This is where a FOMO bear starts to take on too much risk down here."
"9756620","9759560"," This is where it's not risky to be a bear up here. "
"9760360","9762700"," Not risky to be a bear down here."
"9763520","9764760"," Not risky to be a bull."
"9766740","9767540"," Hedge but not enough. "
"9767820","9769340"," Yeah, probably 10 times bids included."
"9769600","9769860"," Thanks."
"9770180","9770560"," Took your advice. "
"9770880","9771480"," I'm smiling now."
"9771880","9772640"," Right on Zio."
"9772980","9774280"," And we did a live trade here. "
"9774400","9775520"," We're off the bell here."
"9775800","9776760"," That was successful printed."
"9777680","9780980"," So any of you guys have heard me over here at the beginning. "
"9781400","9782840"," Should have been able to see that that trade."
"9784220","9785800"," This is all just time and market stuff."
"9786300","9787640"," So what we'll do is we'll start. "
"9787800","9788800"," I'm going to start a class for you guys."
"9789300","9792200"," I'm going to start a if you even if you guys are seasoned traders."
"9792200","9795160"," I've been trading since 2010, I think, or 2009. "
"9796040","9799420"," Came from a background of Occupy Wall Street."
"9800420","9805780"," I was a business owner and I was very unhappy with what took place in 2007 to 2009."
"9807320","9808280"," Started trading stocks. "
"9808660","9809560"," Actually started trading Bitcoin."
"9810360","9811380"," I was an early adopter of Bitcoin."
"9812360","9816120"," If you wouldn't believe that if I told you the story is my Bitcoin stories, you wouldn't believe"
"9816120","9816380"," me. "
"9816720","9818100"," You would think I'm lying to you."
"9819060","9820200"," You want to hear one of them?"
"9822040","9824680"," I've got a good one for you guys for Bitcoin."
"9827120","9830700"," So way, way, way back then, they did this big thing at Burning Man about Occupy Wall Street. "
"9832060","9839140"," I was living in I probably shouldn't say this, but I was living in Park City, Utah."
"9840480","9843460"," And my neighbor was mining Bitcoin."
"9844900","9849220"," From the local TV news station using their servers. "
"9850560","9853420"," When Bitcoin was worthless."
"9854120","9855560"," And I mean worthless."
"9858860","9864060"," And I, of course, I used it to buy things on Silk Road and stuff when I was the other"
"9864060","9864340"," guy. "
"9866760","9868580"," And I've owned it."
"9869060","9870340"," It would be rich today."
"9870940","9871800"," I was an early adopter. "
"9873280","9876560"," But of course I would sell and then we'd have having's and I would sell."
"9878020","9881300"," And way back in the day when you have a having, I mean, it was brutal."
"9881600","9884100"," You'd lose half half the value of your Bitcoin. "
"9888170","9889290"," Oh yeah, great skiing."
"9889630","9891190"," I'm from out west."
"9891410","9892810"," I'm from Park City, Vale. "
"9895190","9896170"," Some other places."
"9899250","9901730"," I was lived on Chamonix in Vale."
"9903490","9906570"," QQQ at 50 a.m. Does that mean a bounce or it studies a bit?"
"9908210","9909830"," Hold on guys, let's look at the cues. "
"9915370","9917630"," Nope, this is not so okay."
"9917890","9923350"," So I want you guys to understand down here that we are in negative gamma right now for NASDAQ."
"9924630","9931950"," So if we're in positive gamma, we're expecting us to sell off just a little and then continue on"
"9931950","9932270"," higher. "
"9932270","9935570"," Once we hit negative gamma, though, we're looking for the inverse."
"9935910","9939450"," You're looking for the bare version of that where we bounce and continue lower."
"9941450","9945110"," Support support for the cues today. "
"9945390","9949130"," Let's look at the actual put wall for the cues today."
"9954240","9955580"," 385 yep, right?"
"9955760","9956200"," We're just bounced."
"9956680","9960360"," So the actual put wall in the cues for today is 385. "
"9961620","9964320"," You'll look for it to bounce back up to 390."
"9965820","9972260"," And kind of rattle around in here, but that's the absolute put wall right now in the cues for today"
"9972260","9973060"," is 385."
"9975080","9976220"," I hope that helps. "
"9976740","9978640"," So yes, you should expect to bounce here at 385."
"9980760","9987160"," We'll take a look at NDX and see if you guys want to see like a NASDAQ burn."
"9987160","9989860"," Maybe I guess some of you guys want to see a NASDAQ burn. "
"9990420","9995360"," Yup, so absolute down here should be on the absolute bottom for NASDAQ."
"9996060","10001400"," You can track this with the cues should be 15705 for today."
"10001760","10005560"," That's another 100 point drop that you would expect in NDX. "
"10006200","10008000"," Do I think we hit that today?"
"10008400","10009500"," Probably not."
"10010240","10011500"," But we could possibly."
"10012080","10014360"," And then if you had to sell the market type situation. "
"10015120","10020020"," If you had a liquidation, liquidation mark is 5543."
"10022260","10025800"," Just so you know, there's more than likely going to be a bounce here or a sideways movement"
"10025800","10026340"," consolidation."
"10027660","10029440"," The next leg down though is 15702. "
"10030400","10031600"," That's a hard number to know."
"10031800","10034520"," And then below that, of course, you've got it's not 15442."
"10036280","10040280"," It's somewhere down here at 5567. "
"10042360","10044080"," So I didn't get to, I didn't get to trade today."
"10044840","10046880"," I'm over here talking to you guys instead of trading myself."
"10048220","10051160"," I can't believe I'm not trading kind of pissy right now. "
"10051160","10052100"," I could have taken that short."
"10052920","10054040"," I'd be printing right now."
"10054380","10055940"," You guys all made money off me today. "
"10056600","10057160"," Look at that."
"10057360","10057880"," And look at this."
"10058580","10059140"," Look at this. "
"10059220","10060960"," You're out of your shorts over here now."
"10060960","10062160"," Guys are killing me."
"10063800","10064760"," Guys are hilarious. "
"10068340","10070960"," You shouldn't get a slingshot today."
"10071280","10076440"," You should get a bounce in NQ and IWM when they're on bottoms."
"10076900","10077940"," Spy not so much. "
"10078200","10080400"," Believe it or not, spy is slightly healthier."
"10081320","10088840"," You shouldn't really get a huge, you wouldn't get a huge bounce on spy unless we hit 45504500"
"10088840","10090240"," somewhere in that area."
"10092660","10093840"," Yep, you've got a put. "
"10094140","10096640"," So you've got put walls and call walls."
"10096980","10098220"," So you've got the majority."
"10098820","10101860"," You've got large institutions that are holding puts. "
"10102520","10104680"," And let's say they bought a put for a dollar."
"10105120","10108280"," And for them to go in the money, they have to print."
"10109260","10115460"," Let's say, let's say, let's say we're at 472 and I buy 450Ps and those go in the money. "
"10117620","10122640"," We'll usually, once we've fulfilled that in the money, they will usually slingshot back at that"
"10122640","10124500"," point so that they become worthless."
"10124980","10131940"," You've got dealers that are hedging the opposite side of that trade so that those options expire"
"10131940","10132680"," worthless."
"10139210","10140570"," Yeah, Joe, you got that right. "
"10141070","10142350"," That was a good trade, wasn't it?"
"10143890","10145970"," Do you think Amazon will break lower?"
"10146990","10148370"," Let's take a look at Amazon real quick."
"10152790","10155930"," Yeah, does me Kevin give you guys trades, live stream trades with you guys?"
"10156250","10156370"," No."
"10158290","10159430"," We know he doesn't. "
"10163050","10165030"," Yeah, so let's take a look at Amazon."
"10167670","10174310"," Yeah, I'm looking for, I'm looking for a hard, hard bounce down here at 3249."
"10176290","10177790"," That's where I'm a buyer on Amazon. "
"10177790","10179950"," If any of you want to know, where do I buy Amazon?"
"10181010","10186550"," I'm going to buy the, the F out of it at 3252 or around there."
"10186630","10187730"," Like, I'll buy it."
"10188010","10189450"," I'll throw the kitchen sink at it. "
"10191400","10192660"," Can I rephrase what, Omar?"
"10194950","10196730"," Oh, no, I don't want to say that."
"10200790","10201670"," Yeah, exactly."
"10202170","10203750"," Dude, those guys, a lot of those guys. "
"10204870","10206010"," Hey, Tiger, how you doing?"
"10207910","10211510"," I try, well, normally I'm trying to figure out a schedule here."
"10214540","10218100"," I'm trying, I have to, I have a lot of technically in the background."
"10218320","10219940"," I need to be able to trade with you. "
"10220560","10227500"," And my setup is not there yet for me to trade with you live so that I can, my setup"
"10227500","10228160"," will be there."
"10228340","10231360"," It's not there yet where I can trade and live stream with you guys."
"10231720","10233020"," And I need to make my own money, right?"
"10233920","10234760"," I want to. "
"10234900","10235260"," I love trading."
"10237460","10238660"," So I need to be able to do that."
"10238660","10243620"," But I need to tighten down a schedule so that I can at least live stream the open and possibly"
"10243620","10245620"," trade with you the open each day. "
"10245700","10246640"," We did that this morning."
"10247840","10250420"," And then I want to at least once a week."
"10251180","10255060"," Chart stocks for you, especially just now heading into the beginning of the year. "
"10256120","10259380"," And then maybe do some classes."
"10260400","10262020"," I don't want to charge you guys."
"10262320","10267600"," I'm going to take, I have a tip cup out on my, on my Twitter handle. "
"10267600","10270560"," And I think I'm a description of this video I do as well."
"10271080","10273180"," But I know you guys get trapped in classes."
"10273680","10274920"," I know you guys get trapped paying. "
"10275060","10278920"," Some of you guys are getting trapped paying like, I see guys out there selling classes for like"
"10278920","10280020"," six, seven hundred bucks."
"10280440","10281780"," I've seen thousand dollars."
"10282240","10286120"," I've seen like, I've seen some of these guys they sell like, they talk to you like live stream"
"10286120","10286600"," right now. "
"10286880","10290600"," And they're charging like 300 bucks an hour or something stupid like that."
"10291420","10295440"," I've seen discord selling for three to 500 bucks a month a month."
"10295960","10299780"," Three to five hundred dollars a month for just access to a discord. "
"10300440","10300800"," That's insane."
"10301400","10302800"," So you're like stacking all these things."
"10303320","10304460"," You're paying for the class. "
"10304700","10309380"," You're paying for a live stream paying for access to a discord."
"10310020","10311180"," Then you're paying for all your tools."
"10312220","10317100"," And before you, I mean, even I spend, I think I spend 12 grand a year on, on tools, just"
"10317100","10317420"," tools. "
"10318100","10319260"," I spend 12,000 dollars."
"10319440","10321580"," That's, some people make that with a job in a year."
"10321920","10324120"," You know, students and stuff like that. "
"10324120","10324880"," They're struggling."
"10326300","10327540"," So that stuff's all expensive."
"10329140","10332560"," So it makes me feel better to give back to you guys. "
"10332880","10334740"," Makes me feel better as a trader."
"10335440","10337860"," I know that I hit all these pitfalls when I was learning how to trade."
"10338540","10343860"," And so trying to trade myself, but then also be active. "
"10344180","10344960"," COVID brought that on."
"10345160","10347960"," We, we somewhat, I somewhat have, I've got two children."
"10349020","10351660"," And we still send me to an extent. "
"10352880","10353240"," Quarantining."
"10353700","10356780"," You know, we're getting out in public and stuff, but we keep socially distanced."
"10357260","10357800"," We wear masks. "
"10359320","10362800"," Mostly because I had, I had someone in my family die from, from COVID."
"10362900","10363560"," If you guys want to know."
"10364200","10366340"," I had a family member die of COVID. "
"10367320","10368680"," A very horrible death."
"10369400","10370860"," I know some of you guys don't believe in COVID."
"10370960","10371300"," That's fine. "
"10371700","10372760"," You don't have to believe in COVID."
"10372820","10373540"," I'm not, I'm not crazy."
"10373880","10375740"," I'm not a crazy, like a masker. "
"10376180","10377780"," If you don't want to wear a mask, you don't want to get vaccinated."
"10378460","10379000"," That's all on you."
"10379000","10384560"," I don't try, never try to talk about this stuff in my, uh, Twitter life or my trading life. "
"10385280","10387320"," But for me, that's why I'm at home."
"10387920","10392520"," And you guys all provide me with, uh, friendship that I'm very grateful for."
"10394520","10396140"," Blue two accounts selling some shit. "
"10396300","10398300"," So you could have 40,000 to play with in January."
"10400220","10404340"," I'm not sure what software you use, but you may want to try using some screen overlays."
"10404960","10406340"," Yeah, I use, uh, OBS. "
"10407140","10409640"," I'm just becoming familiar with OBS right now."
"10409640","10417460"," Uh, I'm just becoming familiar with OBS and I might be switching to another one, a paid version of"
"10417460","10417880"," OBS."
"10418460","10419940"," Uh, and it's not just that. "
"10420060","10421660"," It's that I have to hide my login."
"10421960","10423540"," It has more to do with privacy."
"10424540","10427480"," Uh, so I have to make sure that my stuff's all good for that. "
"10428080","10432640"," Uh, so anyways, I'm trying to, what I'm trying to do is focus this down into trying to get at"
"10432640","10433780"," least a video out to you."
"10434440","10439400"," Once a day, uh, for levels and stuff like that, right?"
"10439700","10440480"," Pivot's in the market."
"10441060","10445680"," I'd like to do an opener or a close if I can or a market pivot if I can with"
"10445680","10445900"," you. "
"10446260","10447480"," Once a day, it's a live stream."
"10447680","10448700"," So you'll get like a recorded video."
"10449380","10454540"," Even if it's brief, even if I, even if I, sometimes I don't need to make them past few weeks. "
"10454560","10455560"," I didn't have to make them often."
"10455820","10457120"," I only needed to make them once a week."
"10457500","10459820"," The video literally covered your entire week. "
"10460460","10462700"," But I try to get a video out every day if I can."
"10463360","10465560"," Or do a live stream in the morning and at the close."
"10466700","10468280"," One of the others or some combination. "
"10468740","10474280"," And then on Saturdays or Sundays, let's say at 11 or something like that, we'll do a stock"
"10474280","10476400"," charting, especially right now."
"10476800","10482200"," And if I can produce some training videos for you guys that you guys can watch, I'll do that as"
"10482200","10482360"," well."
"10484890","10487390"," Oh, I would say I had pneumonia for 10 months, coughing blood for a month. "
"10488030","10488310"," Yeah, Omar."
"10488610","10489490"," That stuff's nasty, man."
"10490450","10491250"," The pneumonia is no joke. "
"10492310","10493450"," Yeah, they appreciated Eric."
"10494070","10498870"," Oh, you almost died of COVID, Omar."
"10499470","10499650"," Dude. "
"10500270","10502110"," I don't want to tell you."
"10502230","10502370"," All right."
"10502450","10504590"," So I remember they caught COVID. "
"10506310","10510530"," And to where they were getting sick and bad, couldn't get a bed, got sent home from the hospital."
"10511210","10513570"," He was lying in bed overnight."
"10515130","10516730"," And his wife was. "
"10518790","10520830"," My, my mother-in-law was."
"10522090","10523090"," Let him sleep alone."
"10523890","10526750"," And he was, he was unresponsive over the course of one night. "
"10527430","10528790"," They took him to the hospital."
"10529110","10531750"," There was no room for him and."
"10532690","10534250"," She never got to speak to him. "
"10534630","10536410"," They had to move him to a set another hospital."
"10536410","10537750"," They didn't know where he was."
"10538050","10538750"," He died alone. "
"10539670","10541550"," You know, he died being vented and."
"10542070","10543930"," You know, they put a mask on you and."
"10544590","10545710"," You choked to death. "
"10546050","10548910"," That's what that's really what happens and you're aware of what's going on."
"10549510","10552750"," At that time period, when that was taking place, that was the beginning of COVID."
"10553770","10555530"," And there was no iPads. "
"10556230","10556850"," There was no talking."
"10557910","10559490"," They had a great life together."
"10560510","10563050"," They had everything that you would think that you would want in your life. "
"10563150","10564450"," And it was all gone."
"10565690","10566390"," And he died alone."
"10567710","10569050"," And I wouldn't wish that on anybody. "
"10569370","10570130"," And I have you guys out there."
"10570370","10571850"," I wouldn't wish that with any disease, right?"
"10572510","10576010"," Dying of like a lung cancer or any of those really horrible diseases that you can die from."
"10580790","10582350"," Glad to see that you recovered Almar. "
"10587640","10589520"," I'm here for the friendship with you guys to Nigel."
"10591120","10592360"," Hey, Cook, thanks for the heart."
"10592640","10592720"," Rafael. "
"10594880","10596040"," Rafael, have a great day."
"10602610","10607710"," Yeah, you know, like, um, I'm not trying to be out there and arguing with anyone that's anti-vax."
"10607870","10609270"," I get what you guys are coming from to. "
"10609630","10611630"," None of you guys have said that, but any guys out there that are anti-vax."
"10612490","10614110"," I know you guys all have to do what you have to do."
"10615170","10617930"," Um, we live in that country where you guys can do whatever you want. "
"10617930","10624210"," Uh, so, but I've got these two, I've got two young daughters and for me and my family."
"10625070","10627090"," Uh, you know, that's what it's been for us."
"10627390","10631010"," We, I homeschool now and, um, we still get out. "
"10631130","10631930"," We hike, bike and ski."
"10633070","10635930"," Actually, my youngest daughter finally got her second vaccination."
"10636930","10641170"," So we made our way to, we have a local place that we go to go swimming and we've been"
"10641170","10644010"," starting to step outside recently more frequently than before. "
"10644850","10646250"," Hey, you're welcome to everybody out there."
"10647610","10648970"," Honestly, welcome to all you guys."
"10649530","10651690"," Okay, so where do you get put call wall info?"
"10652310","10653110"," Great question, James. "
"10653850","10655550"," So you can get that information."
"10656290","10657910"," Let me look it up right now for you."
"10658450","10658750"," You know what?"
"10659090","10662510"," So I know where to find that for you for free. "
"10662890","10663750"," You can pay for it."
"10663850","10665370"," There's services where you can pay for it."
"10665770","10671210"," But I will post on my Twitter handle a free resource to find out where those walls are. "
"10672270","10676890"," The CME actually tracks where putting call walls are shockingly."
"10677570","10680930"," This is at 22.59. Let's look at the mix."
"10684960","10685780"," Wait a minute. "
"10695920","10696220"," Yep."
"10696480","10699420"," So I posted remember we show I showed you this gap up here."
"10699880","10703760"," 27 to 24 to 27 would like to see that gap get filled. "
"10704320","10707120"," Other people are talking about the gap fill up here in the forties."
"10707600","10710540"," I am not believing that that maybe the forties will get hit."
"10710640","10712140"," I guess it's possible we hit the forties. "
"10712140","10713340"," This week."
"10713360","10714200"," Anything is possible."
"10714860","10716140"," I'm not going to discount that. "
"10718950","10722790"," But I would like to see this gap full fill here 24 to 27."
"10723350","10726790"," I am betting on this gap filled between now and tomorrow."
"10728090","10736710"," 24.55 27.16. I want you to go to also realize that even if we fill this gap, it"
"10736710","10740170"," does not imply that stocks or indexes will go down. "
"10740170","10743430"," We can have volatility without movement in the market."
"10744030","10745270"," But I do want to see this."
"10745430","10746730"," At least this one get filled. "
"10747290","10751190"," Some people are talking about wanting to see the gap fill."
"10751770","10752590"," Where's that gap fill?"
"10752870","10754250"," How far back is that gap fill?"
"10757530","10758510"," Let's look at this."
"10759230","10759770"," So this is. "
"10761510","10762730"," There's a gap fill."
"10763450","10763930"," Where is it?"
"10766290","10770490"," I think it's showing here, but I think there's a gap fill above."
"10772650","10774870"," I like 40 somewhere back in here. "
"10775030","10775870"," There's a gap to fill."
"10776030","10777770"," It's not showing up on this chart that I have."
"10777950","10782070"," I would have to open up trading view to find the gap. "
"10782070","10782930"," There's a gap in here."
"10784230","10785170"," In the forties."
"10785290","10787810"," But in reality, the gap that you really want to see get filled. "
"10789870","10791430"," Is this one right here."
"10791570","10793630"," There's 24 to 27."
"10794230","10795850"," Would be nice to see this get filled. "
"10796450","10798050"," So this 35 up here."
"10798350","10800670"," Everyone wants to see the 40 get filled."
"10800670","10803150"," You would have to see a break below. "
"10804050","10809930"," More than likely you'd have to see a break below 4550 on the spy for us to fill a gap"
"10809930","10810730"," in the forties."
"10811550","10812810"," That's what you'd be looking for."
"10813650","10818070"," You'll be looking for a break below 4550. "
"10819130","10821930"," Do I think we see that gap get filled right now?"
"10822030","10823370"," The 40 the 40 gap."
"10825590","10826070"," No."
"10826850","10828830"," I'm going to from my experience. "
"10829110","10830490"," I would tell you no from my experience."
"10830530","10835390"," I think you're going to see us fill the 27 gap and we'll start trading lower into end of year."
"10835930","10839910"," Do I think you'll see that 40 gap into January to March?"
"10840310","10841590"," I see the probability is higher. "
"10842130","10844650"," I think you've seen the highest here at 35."
"10844710","10846470"," I think you're going to see us trade down."
"10847170","10850030"," The VIX will trade down into first of the year. "
"10850570","10853150"," And then you'll see us come back up into the forties possibly by March."
"10853150","10855370"," I think it's possible."
"10855550","10859230"," We could definitely hit 40 if the market sells off from FOMC. "
"10859610","10860830"," I just don't see it being probable."
"10863770","10864610"," I have a hard problem."
"10864690","10865390"," Would never take jobs. "
"10865650","10866990"," That makes my heart my problem worse."
"10867230","10867350"," Yeah."
"10867750","10868030"," Hello. "
"10868310","10868830"," F four."
"10869290","10870670"," No worries, bro."
"10871890","10873230"," I completely understand. "
"10873730","10874270"," To each his own."
"10875770","10878950"," I wish that we weren't all fighting about it as much as we do."
"10879190","10880190"," I know that that part sucks. "
"10880370","10882050"," It does divide a lot of us."
"10883250","10885230"," So I try to stay out of that conversation."
"10885350","10887130"," I try to stay out of the COVID conversation. "
"10888170","10892190"," If I wanted to try to discuss that stuff in the market related because."
"10893090","10893970"," I know it's a touching subject."
"10893970","10896290"," If it's market related, I'll touch on it. "
"10897290","10901930"," If I really was that passionate about either side, I would just open a different a different social"
"10901930","10902710"," media accounts."
"10903290","10904270"," And talk about it there."
"10904810","10908710"," Because I got to keep my main street hat in my wall street hat separate. "
"10909050","10911470"," It's important for you as a trader to know that as well."
"10911470","10912810"," And we try to keep."
"10913090","10914630"," We try to keep our main street hat. "
"10915030","10918610"," We try to keep our wall street hat because if we start to mix those."
"10919170","10922090"," Or trade with those hats, mixing those hats, you will lose."
"10922390","10923030"," I will lose. "
"10923590","10924330"," Every time."
"10924990","10925350"," You will lose."
"10925710","10930670"," You'll see traders or investors out there say, well, I trade with some like a trade. "
"10930910","10932510"," I only trade certain stocks for certain reasons."
"10933670","10935790"," They they can do that to some extent."
"10936530","10938790"," But when you start really start to mix politics. "
"10939330","10942270"," That are not market related into investing and trading."
"10942650","10943850"," It's a it's a way."
"10944150","10944850"," It's a landmine. "
"10945190","10946430"," It's definitely a landmine."
"10947970","10948850"," What's the VIX?"
"10949130","10950010"," The volatility index."
"10951710","10952210"," Cool. "
"10952570","10953050"," Happy to pay."
"10953290","10954250"," If it's more reliable."
"10955630","10956070"," Thanks, James. "
"10957070","10957270"," Yeah."
"10957510","10960550"," No, you know, right now, I'm not really unless this starts to consume me."
"10960990","10964010"," I think that I'll leave it up to you guys. "
"10964350","10965950"," If you guys are learning."
"10966550","10968030"," If you guys are making money."
"10969430","10971790"," Then please consider tipping me. "
"10972130","10973150"," Tip what you can."
"10973810","10975170"," Tip what you think is appropriate."
"10975910","10980510"," If it helps me to pay for these services helps me for the time that I'm taking out. "
"10980890","10981470"," To do this."
"10981550","10982930"," And it really does keep me engaged."
"10983710","10985070"," It keeps me engaged. "
"10986190","10989290"," And I already pay like 12,000 a year for this crap."
"10989550","10992870"," So if you guys are helping me over the course of a year to pay for these services."
"10993950","10995170"," Then I'm stoked. "
"10995710","10997630"," I have no way to express to you how grateful I am."
"10998910","11003090"," What is your high confidence strike on the VIX or UVX for Friday or next week?"
"11004130","11006570"," What's your point of view about Apple today?"
"11006930","11007150"," Okay."
"11007250","11008010"," We'll answer both of these. "
"11010070","11012730"," My high confidence strike on the VIX."
"11012950","11016170"," Are you VXY for Friday or next week?"
"11016670","11020670"," I think we come in and tag somewhere at 27, possibly 30."
"11020670","11022930"," Into FOMC into tomorrow. "
"11023490","11027710"," I think the moment that we have the presser."
"11028350","11031270"," That it's going to be a sell the news event."
"11032050","11035550"," Because of how much is priced in where we are. "
"11035930","11038330"," It is probably a 10."
"11039630","11043970"," I would give it a 10 to 20% chance that."
"11044430","11047330"," We are told something that we don't already know. "
"11047330","11054670"," As Jay, Jay Powell has said that he would telegraph and advance any thing that's coming out of"
"11054670","11055290"," FOMC."
"11055830","11057270"," So I'm going to give it a 30."
"11057890","11058870"," High confidence and. "
"11060010","11060490"," All right."
"11060590","11063390"," Let's give a high confidence 24 to 27 high confidence."
"11065010","11065990"," 30 would be max. "
"11068130","11071070"," To see anything in the 40s or 50s."
"11071150","11074250"," We would need to have some unknown information."
"11074250","11075230"," So likelihood. "
"11076150","11078770"," We close the gap between 24 and 27."
"11080050","11081950"," Possible panic moments at 30."
"11082710","11087730"," But I do think that even if we stretch that high, it's going to be for the briefest of moments. "
"11088350","11090210"," And you got to remember in this market."
"11090910","11091590"," It's a rule."
"11092050","11092970"," We are forward looking. "
"11093490","11096450"," And once the cats out of the bag, the VIX will go away."
"11100990","11102830"," I'll look at Apple next for you, Omar."
"11103950","11105070"," I'm happy to pay. "
"11105070","11107450"," Oh, yeah, see me."
"11107530","11110270"," Oh, it's just I'm happy to pay you as soon as they get a PayPal sorted."
"11110770","11111750"," There's no worries, James. "
"11112010","11112910"," You don't pay me, man."
"11113890","11115190"," There's no, there's no pay me."
"11115310","11117330"," Oh, what's the difference between CME?"
"11117770","11118770"," Yeah, you don't have to pay me, man. "
"11119030","11120090"," There's no worries with money."
"11120370","11121810"," Do none of you guys should think you owe me money."
"11124050","11127570"," I'm happy to pay too soon to get the PayPal sort of less password. "
"11127790","11128070"," No worries."
"11128830","11130610"," Okay, talking about CME versus paid."
"11130930","11132490"," Okay, so the put and call walls. "
"11132490","11134750"," You can pay services for them."
"11134870","11140370"," I think Tradytix is called Tradytix offers some form."
"11140530","11145730"," I don't like Tradytix for options flow, but they do have a basic put and call wall that they show. "
"11146230","11152490"," There is a version from CME where they show you where all the strikes are, where the concentration"
"11152490","11159470"," of all the puts are and the concentration of all the calls are by date."
"11159470","11165530"," And so you're looking for the most calls for the month and the most puts and where they expire to"
"11165530","11167190"," find out where the put and call walls are."
"11167730","11172630"," You are also, there are some other mechanics that are involved in this and there are some companies"
"11172630","11173930"," that go deeper into it. "
"11174030","11180270"," You'll hear people talk about the hero indicator and that tracks not just current put and call"
"11180270","11187050"," walls, but it tracks when we have what looks like puts and what looks like actual heading or"
"11187050","11191550"," hedging, which is a different volume and different type of puts that are being bought."
"11192030","11193710"," And there are companies that offer services."
"11194150","11196830"," One of them that does a pretty good job of it is spot gamma. "
"11197190","11198750"," That's the service that I pay for."
"11199030","11202230"," You can get a basic service for, I don't know what it is."
"11202470","11205450"," And I got the pro level for them because I use book maps. "
"11206610","11209010"," And book maps I pay for book maps spot gamma."
"11209510","11214050"," You go down this rabbit hole where you're paying for spot gamma and you're paying for book maps and"
"11214050","11218350"," you're paying for data to book maps and it winds up costing a ton of money."
"11219590","11224430"," And you can, like you can just go on Twitter and look for the put and call wall. "
"11224550","11229290"," You just search and put wall call wall every day and someone will know it and post it for you."
"11230450","11233210"," It's pretty easy to find out every day where the put and call wall are."
"11235300","11238220"," The CME does those shows so you can figure it out for yourself. "
"11242670","11245590"," Almost keep my streamlabs to power and clean."
"11245830","11246470"," You guys are hilarious."
"11247410","11248430"," You guys are hilarious. "
"11248810","11251810"," Hey, captain, are you still in our X T?"
"11252350","11253150"," No, I'm not."
"11253270","11253710"," I'm not."
"11253850","11254810"," I've sold out of all my. "
"11254990","11259530"," So I even sold along this morning on that quick rip higher on spy."
"11259790","11266050"," So I I took myself out of my last long and I took myself out of a spread that I"
"11266050","11266830"," had for."
"11266830","11270990"," For for December 31st, I had a call spread. "
"11271430","11275290"," I closed that at the opening bell and I closed a."
"11276290","11280230"," And it wasn't after it was a weekly call for 476."
"11281250","11283330"," Then I closed that the opening bell as well."
"11283650","11287130"," I traded live with most of these guys the short at the opening. "
"11287690","11292610"," Let's go to Spyro quick, but I didn't trade it myself because I cannot open my."
"11292610","11297130"," My trading platform on this same page."
"11297130","11298290"," I have to keep it separate. "
"11299290","11302250"," I want to be able to live trade with you guys on screen."
"11303870","11305570"," Because right now I'm looking at two screens."
"11306910","11309840"," So let me see. "
"11310460","11317700"," Not in our X T anymore dumb dumb to buy VIX calls 24 strike for 40 cents."
"11318260","11319620"," You guys want to buy VIX calls."
"11319620","11323240"," You're more than likely going to see the VIX mellow out into FMC. "
"11323600","11326220"," Previous FMCs, you'll see us start going sideways."
"11327380","11332060"," If you guys have traded FMCs, you'll know that at some point we start trading sideways, typically."
"11333560","11334340"," Thank you. "
"11334480","11336180"," Think it will take a few call spreads in the VIX."
"11336840","11345760"," Remember, if you are taking calls on the VIX, you have to have your brokerage open."
"11345760","11352140"," And have your finger on the sell button for the spike. "
"11352680","11358760"," Those spikes only last usually for one to five minutes."
"11359380","11360820"," We're talking fast moves."
"11361400","11367120"," So if you're betting on a VIX spike between now and tomorrow, the one thing I would caution you on"
"11367120","11373660"," is that you have a very fast software or brokerage that is up to minute live. "
"11374280","11375940"," Trading right to the millisecond."
"11376020","11377700"," Not millisecond, but you have a good internet connection."
"11378500","11382740"," You have a good internet connection and that you are focused solely on the VIX. "
"11383100","11387260"," If you're in a VIX play, that you have levels to sell out of."
"11388240","11389400"," You have predetermined."
"11389620","11390700"," I'm going to sell it 24. "
"11391500","11394200"," I'm going to sell it 27 to trigger that cell."
"11395060","11396700"," Or that you pre sell that level."
"11396860","11402560"," If you're actually buying the VIX, you have trigger points for you to sell the VIX. "
"11402560","11408740"," Once you've bought into it, be very careful trading the VIX as those spikes are fast."
"11409520","11411060"," You can get really wrapped up."
"11411520","11415480"," You can be in the money big time and then be broke trading the VIX. "
"11418370","11424310"," So we will have a ramp up into green territory at two to three p.m. stairway to heaven."
"11424310","11427950"," Mike once Paul starts clearing his voice as he speaks."
"11428710","11430370"," You know what I'm going to. "
"11431330","11433170"," I've asked go, what did you ask?"
"11433570","11434390"," Thanks for the answer."
"11435250","11444620"," Okay, so my plan into Wednesday, just once more is I didn't get to trade this."
"11444860","11447560"," You guys got to trade this with me this morning, but I didn't trade it. "
"11447560","11448000"," I wish I had."
"11448820","11457240"," So my plan would be to wait at this point, my plan would be to wait for the market to"
"11457240","11458740"," stabilize into FOMC."
"11459520","11462100"," And take on some form of a straddle. "
"11462440","11467820"," I could take on some cheap way outside the money puts far dated."
"11468300","11472040"," And then I would also take on some heavy heavy if we're down here."
"11472340","11478540"," I'm going to wind up taking on some heavy outside the money calls for the VIX to drop. "
"11478980","11482760"," Once Jay Powell is done talking and for us to scream much higher."
"11483100","11487420"," If we were way up above here in FOMC, I would be taking on puts."
"11488260","11491680"," So some type of straddle is my plan for tomorrow. "
"11493950","11496670"," Great content, also much more social than trading alone."
"11497070","11498390"," Yeah, thanks to all you guys."
"11498570","11499870"," I love trade with you guys. "
"11500150","11501730"," You guys sucker me in, I swear."
"11502810","11506790"," I go down the rabbit hole and I'm like, I'm only going to do it from eight until nine and"
"11506790","11508210"," it's 1135 this morning."
"11510110","11511610"," But it's good to be with all of you. "
"11511790","11512350"," It really is."
"11512630","11514090"," So I'm going to wrap it up though right now."
"11514090","11519070"," I need to get with some trades on for for tomorrow. "
"11519070","11520990"," So let's just wrap this up briefly."
"11521670","11523230"," Let's take a look at where we are."
"11525590","11527050"," And let's see where we are. "
"11527290","11527590"," Let's take."
"11527710","11529230"," Let's just look at a big picture here."
"11530770","11531530"," Let's look at it. "
"11531610","11537930"," Let's look at this from a bull perspective and then a bear perspective before I before I stop the"
"11537930","11538190"," stream."
"11538390","11538550"," Okay."
"11539310","11545750"," If you're looking for a from the bull perspective, we just made all time highs. "
"11546490","11548890"," We're still in positive gamma."
"11549210","11551850"," We're still not in negative gamma down below here."
"11552570","11557630"," When we made this all time high, right, we tapped below at a put wall. "
"11558210","11560470"," We attempted to make all time highs."
"11560790","11562190"," We failed to do so above."
"11564370","11569230"," Automatically, we have to assume that we're going to revisit down below. "
"11570230","11571370"," At support."
"11572250","11576970"," At hard support down between 45 50 46 hundred."
"11577570","11582030"," And this is a check to see if we really do want to be going up. "
"11582390","11584690"," Or if we really want to be heading lower."
"11585150","11589950"," And that's what you need to understand as a trader that we failed to make new all time highs."
"11589950","11591770"," We came back down to check. "
"11592430","11592830"," Right."
"11592950","11593630"," We look above."
"11594030","11595990"," You'll hear that in in social media. "
"11595990","11597790"," You'll hear we're going to look above it."
"11597830","11599530"," If we don't look above, we're going to then check below."
"11599850","11600710"," So we looked above. "
"11601190","11603030"," We didn't we didn't even reject."
"11603130","11604330"," We didn't even make it up there."
"11604810","11605610"," Not enough ramp. "
"11606010","11608030"," Maybe some would say due to FOMC."
"11608490","11612150"," So we're checking below down below here to see if we want to go lower."
"11613230","11618350"," And that check means is liquidity coming up and saying, no, we're still going higher. "
"11618350","11619190"," Right."
"11619710","11624910"," And so what I'm looking for here at this point is a weight period into FOMC."
"11625450","11629750"," War for liquidity to be removed to head to actually head lower. "
"11630270","11630870"," All right."
"11631550","11631870"," Now."
"11632650","11635870"," So if you're a bull, we made this move above. "
"11636090","11637270"," We weren't ready to go higher."
"11637910","11642790"," So now you've you've got from me my perspective as a bull is that we're waiting for FOMC."
"11643410","11644690"," What are we waiting for?"
"11644810","11645230"," FOMC. "
"11645510","11649370"," We're waiting for new news to be dropped that are already known."
"11649730","11651310"," We already know that Jay Paus hawkish."
"11651870","11654170"," We already know that he wants to accelerate tapering. "
"11654910","11658510"," We already know that they've they've priced in two to three."
"11659570","11661010"," Rates rate increases."
"11661630","11664350"," And I think it's for like 20 to 30 points in 2022. "
"11665150","11668370"," So you really need to hear something uglier than that."
"11668810","11671590"," You you're probably looking for a monkey wrench."
"11671590","11678970"," I haven't talked about this much, but you're probably looking for the mandate of the infusion of"
"11678970","11680910"," cash into the economy to be removed. "
"11681210","11682010"," That's QT."
"11682150","11688230"," I think it's called the mandate still has four to five billion or trillion dollars available."
"11688570","11691450"," If that isn't removed, that's good news for the market. "
"11692730","11701070"," If you see we get hammered with rates if we roll out three or schedule three rate hikes in 2022."
"11701070","11703210"," That would be a negative that would send us lower."
"11704150","11707690"," But if they did come out slightly more slightly more davish. "
"11708430","11711890"," You're going to as a bull you're looking at this saying who I love this move."
"11712090","11713410"," We make one, two, three."
"11713730","11714830"," This is the third one. "
"11715330","11717250"," And this is going to send us to all time highs."
"11717530","11721330"," So that's what the bull is looking for on the news at FOMC tomorrow."
"11722170","11726950"," If you're looking at this from a bearish perspective, I can already tell you what these are. "
"11726950","11730970"," This is almost like a white, a wick off down."
"11731310","11736630"," So you're going to get all time highs failed to make new new all time highs, right?"
"11737090","11738330"," It's going to come back down here."
"11738850","11739850"," Test down. "
"11740070","11744850"," They're going to say it's going to test at 4500 between now and Wednesday, right?"
"11745330","11748710"," You'll have you'll have a bounce here hard from Algos."
"11748990","11753750"," You'll fail to make you'll fail to make a previous high, right?"
"11753750","11760130"," Which is now at 42 47 2.37 or down here in this zone."
"11760530","11763210"," And you're going to be using these now as resistance points. "
"11763270","11765050"," So we bounce here, right?"
"11765210","11765790"," With bad news."
"11765930","11772510"," We'd attempt to recover and we would more than likely bounce directly off 460 and start to head"
"11772510","11773970"," down to I think it's 435."
"11775050","11775650"," I haven't looked. "
"11775830","11776590"," I haven't looked lately."
"11776790","11779570"," I actually deleted that stuff where I had it before."
"11780110","11782470"," Yeah, you've got no, you've got 444 down here. "
"11782810","11784730"," 445 down here is targets."
"11784830","11787590"," Then you've got 424 I think is the next one."
"11788210","11790290"," And then you've got lower at 4395. "
"11790970","11795550"," I'd have to turn all that stuff out for you guys with the bearish players down below."
"11796350","11801870"," But that would be what the bears are telling you is happening as time moves forward with really"
"11801870","11802630"," hawkish news."
"11803190","11807690"," There are some bears out there though that think these are the these are the real bears. "
"11807690","11812270"," These are the ones that think it doesn't matter what they say at the FOMC."
"11812890","11819830"," We are in the fifth wave of an Elliott wave that's going to sell this market down to the pits"
"11819830","11821470"," of how into 2022."
"11822110","11825610"," That regardless of what happens we go lower from here. "
"11826290","11828950"," Then that's possible and we can trade that market either way."
"11829270","11830770"," We should be cash at this point."
"11831290","11834130"," We can play both sides heading right into next year. "
"11834130","11838530"," If we don't find any stocks that we can buy right now into next year that's fine too."
"11838990","11841310"," We can trade this market straight down to the pits of hell."
"11841710","11847330"," We are positioned like that at this moment and we are we are positioned right now for this"
"11847330","11848670"," volatility in the market. "
"11849030","11856270"," And we should be positioned to invest in 2022 because we're cash and also trade the market down"
"11856270","11857430"," into 2022."
"11857430","11865910"," If we go if we crash because of either unknown rates or unknown ramping of tapering and also just"
"11865910","11869890"," because of where we are in the market closing up that 2020 COVID trade."
"11870270","11872690"," So I have no panic in where we are right now. "
"11872790","11875090"," You shouldn't have any panic right now."
"11875090","11879630"," If you are long in this market right now, you know for sure you need to this is the time"
"11879630","11884250"," of year for you to be taking on hedges to protect your lungs in this market."
"11884250","11891530"," And you've you've had my story since I want to say the beginning of October of wrapping up all of"
"11891530","11892530"," your lungs for the year. "
"11892870","11897770"," And you remember that I pointed out that even Apple would take us much much higher and that no one"
"11897770","11900370"," would believe me at how high it was actually going to go."
"11900830","11903090"," We've fulfilled all of these things at this point."
"11904170","11907430"," So what I would say to you as as we head into FOMC. "
"11908290","11914010"," If there are any highs, you'll continue to hedge if you can take profits on moves like this."
"11914490","11916810"," It is important as a bear to take profit here."
"11917070","11919870"," You do not stay short on these moves. "
"11920230","11921750"," You take the profit and run."
"11922210","11928270"," You look towards the next chance or next opportunity to short once again you're going to be looking"
"11928270","11934410"," for a pull higher into tomorrow or a stabilization sideways to take your next short."
"11934410","11937050"," This will grind and kill your short positions. "
"11937910","11940270"," I know that nobody talks about this stuff on social media."
"11941090","11943130"," So anyways, this short is over."
"11943690","11951210"," I'm going to be looking to grab another short from now into FOMC and also along into FOMC on what"
"11951210","11957210"," I think is the probability that we're going to make at least 481 more before the end of the year. "
"11958090","11959230"," I'll leave you all with that."
"11959730","11960850"," I'm going to sign off."
