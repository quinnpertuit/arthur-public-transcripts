"43220","45320"," Check 1-2, 1-2. "
"46460","47660"," Happy Friday, everybody."
"50020","55140"," You didn't even wait, right off the bell here and just rip it some faces off."
"72730","73490"," Good morning, everybody. "
"74270","76350"," You're already piling in."
"77630","78770"," Love to see it."
"84550","86530"," Turn that right off and get right into it. "
"86990","88730"," Green bars right off the open."
"89330","90950"," So if you were in yesterday."
"93050","98450"," If you were in yesterday, we talked about grabbing a squ- or not a squeeze of strangle. "
"99550","104630"," Now to grab some puts up here, take them down and then at 4.15 to grab some calls."
"105410","109830"," So if you had some calls and puts in here, the puts are likely dead at this point."
"110650","113930"," But I would say do you leave them on or if it was me. "
"114270","116590"," I'm trying not to do the not financial advice thing."
"117170","119810"," The purpose of a strangle right here, right?"
"119950","120610"," Actually this is from yesterday."
"122070","126370"," The purpose of the strangle is actually this is the close in yesterday and then we talked about"
"126370","135470"," buying that 4.15. Call at the calls at 4.15 and the idea here is that"
"135470","141010"," when I say you buy zero dates and you close them and next day on strangles. "
"141710","143710"," You don't technically do that, right?"
"144510","147270"," You're going to hold both sides and manage both sides."
"148310","151130"," So hopefully you were able to grab some calls down here."
"151130","155530"," And you're realizing some profit to the upside. "
"156150","161570"," Now I want to make a note here that's last Friday."
"163690","165550"," We had one of those days, right?"
"165970","170170"," Rip faces off part of the day and then slammed into the close."
"171110","178890"," If you're on the call and put side at some point, whenever it is, you're going to take profit here. "
"180490","181630"," We've got this one."
"181830","182990"," Remember this one back here?"
"183210","185510"," 4.51.58. We talked about this yesterday."
"187350","196330"," And we talked about 4.2.07. 4.53.75 and your Valhalla target above it 4 "
"196330","205350",".55.15. There are some targets above that, but the point here being is"
"205350","208030"," these are directional trades. "
"208030","215390"," So if you wanted to take the money off the opening bell, squeeze on the call side and then leave"
"215390","220450"," the put side on as your hedge for Friday, right?"
"222430","227230"," And then reposition if we're going to have continuation to the upside."
"228210","230830"," Well, if you guys spend time with me, hold on one second."
"230950","232050"," I got some stuff to do. "
"232710","233870"," I got to do a couple things."
"234030","235470"," I'm trying to get ahead of myself there."
"236470","238710"," We've got, I've got all kinds of like pollen. "
"238890","247430"," We just had a big rain event that finally ended and now all these, all these like flowers outside"
"247430","254290"," in my garden is all blooming and we've got like pollen or whatever everywhere this morning."
"255589","256470"," Me a second."
"256709","258610"," Let me get some of the stuff posted on. "
"260930","264430"," On a fin twit and all that again, a little bit ahead of myself."
"269020","270120"," Give me a second here."
"275520","278500"," We're going to probably go over AMC and Tesla this morning. "
"286170","289330"," And you know, there are, there are some people that disagree."
"290850","296330"," With that assessment of how to manage a strangle personally, I would have taken the money right"
"296330","296530"," there."
"296530","297530"," I just talked to you about it. "
"297910","300090"," I wanted to get out there as quick as possible."
"300910","303410"," So if you took your calls there, congratulations."
"305170","306690"," But to continue that conversation. "
"309170","312610"," I think tight here to continue that conversation."
"314410","319910"," If you spend any time around here, you know, zero dates are directional normally."
"320610","325330"," There are other ways to manage a strangle where you just keep both sides all day long and see how"
"325330","325870"," they work out. "
"326030","327190"," People oftentimes do that."
"328010","334270"," They'll just hold both sides, see if they can get a max on either one of those or either side"
"334270","334810"," of that trade."
"336310","338510"," Personally, I look at zeronates like they're directional. "
"340350","345010"," As soon as I can pull some profit off one, I take them."
"346010","350430"," I leave the other side on as a hedge, whether that's calls or puts doesn't matter."
"352670","355130"," And they'll trade the market for the rest of the day. "
"356510","360190"," And directionally using the tools that we learn inside of this stream, right?"
"360910","363910"," You guys always, you guys always know what the tools say, right?"
"364790","367110"," We're buying a dip for bullish and for bearish."
"367490","369130"," We're in a five minute chart right here."
"369790","373390"," And so far prices above the twenty seven EMA, right?"
"374130","377770"," So right now we're bullish on this open. "
"378490","383070"," Another note here would be that there's no, there's a tiny gap down here."
"383630","387430"," See my cursor, but there was no gap ups in the overnight."
"388830","392590"," Yeah, if you're a believer in pivots. "
"393450","395810"," Or like, when does cash markets start?"
"396050","402690"," Some people are, I'm, I'm mostly a firm believer that cash market starts at 930, but there are some"
"402690","407410"," people out there that'll say, no, all this, all this is a gap right here, even if it started at"
"407410","407910"," six AM."
"408790","412870"," But there was the technically there was no, there's a tiny, tiny gap down here."
"413990","417450"," Just so you can see it right here for 49 24. "
"420690","422870"," There's some key things to note here this morning."
"422870","424230"," We're going to, we're going to look at the portfolio."
"425090","426890"," We're going to look at some potential squeezes. "
"427110","428190"," We're going to look at earnings today."
"428270","433110"," We're going to spend a lot of time not focused on day trading spy."
"433410","437990"," We will at some point, but this morning specifically, we're going to, we're going to be looking at"
"437990","438590"," tickers. "
"440430","443390"," And by the way, my, my voice today is destroyed."
"443830","450770"," All the screaming and all that, all the craziness that took place this week has left my voice quite"
"450770","452190"," ravaged at this point."
"456300","458620"," I got the Jim James, we'll be right back up. "
"458820","459680"," I'm going to let him get rid of that."
"461420","463080"," I need that right there for you."
"465200","466080"," Just give me a moment here. "
"466140","469180"," Let me get, let me get where I need to be."
"471240","471780"," Good morning."
"471960","473340"," Good morning to all of you guys out there. "
"474020","474960"," Hey, well, good morning, brother."
"475200","476100"," Morning to everybody out there."
"476200","476820"," I hope you all doing well. "
"478440","481960"," There are some people on strangles in the stream right now in the chat."
"482320","483260"," Chaz is one of them."
"483900","488020"," If you have any questions about how to manage a strangle this morning, you can always speak to him. "
"488560","489800"," He loves to trade him."
"490100","491700"," It's one of his favorite trades out there."
"494340","495740"," Let me see if I can go to the channel. "
"496000","496920"," There's the chat right there."
"497180","498100"," I hope you're all doing well."
"504180","504660"," Vicks. "
"506640","508860"," Starting to become bullish here."
"509040","514000"," The cancellation government proposes decreasing Euro discount, $20 from September the 1st."
"515200","516240"," Turn that down. "
"517320","518460"," It's like blasting in my air."
"519880","523260"," Vicks is looking like it's getting some kind of a bid this morning."
"525080","525860"," Or maybe not. "
"526040","528500"," That was a bit as Vicks hasn't started on this chart yet."
"529440","531100"," H.Y.G. with a small role."
"531140","532620"," This is a missponsored buy to the two. "
"532800","533780"," Why is this stuff so loud?"
"534040","535820"," Point to Benachi and Mark."
"536720","537960"," Turn that shit down."
"539560","541160"," It is loud as fuck. "
"549270","550670"," Yeah, Vicks rolling over."
"550830","552050"," Sorry, Dixie rolling over."
"552210","552730"," Not Vicks. "
"554010","555830"," Nasdaq still looking strong here."
"557350","560130"," IWM rolling over this morning on the opening bell."
"562210","562730"," Tesla. "
"564870","566090"," You guys see Tesla."
"566330","567090"," What it's doing this morning?"
"567450","570230"," I texted some of you guys last night and said Tesla to 300."
"571810","574570"," And it is exploding right off of the bell right now. "
"576730","577270"," Exploding."
"584630","585270"," Damn it."
"586690","588090"," What is going on here?"
"588270","588850"," Hold on a second here. "
"594680","597120"," AMC was squeezing in premarket."
"597460","599380"," It's catching a bid on the open as well."
"618780","619820"," We just second here. "
"622080","624040"," We're going to take a look at a few things here."
"628620","632230"," All right."
"632630","633250"," Here we go. "
"635110","641800"," A little overbought on the one minute."
"644100","645040"," It's a one minute chart."
"645200","646160"," We're going to switch to the 30. "
"660440","661940"," Move that down there."
"673100","675700"," Believe it or not, the market can still go higher here."
"676060","676780"," I want you to know that. "
"678220","679960"," Spy can still go higher."
"680360","681900"," I know that's going to be a shocking cheat here."
"684820","689480"," 45360 possible today for an upside target on spy. "
"692400","698200"," We're going to look briefly, review more red tickers this morning on the opening bell."
"698300","700900"," They only had a few this morning before the opening bell."
"700960","702080"," We're going to go over some tickers here. "
"704580","705920"," This is Duolingo."
"706740","708240"," Had a nice squeeze above."
"708240","713880"," We talked about a dip by, I believe, yesterday, before coming up on Duolingo. "
"714600","716040"," I want you to take a look at this one here."
"716720","718140"," It's got this nice squeeze right here."
"718940","722220"," And we talked about it almost being ready for another dip by. "
"722260","724900"," So we had a pay attention to it right where it's at right now."
"726740","728500"," We've got a pullback here."
"728620","730260"," We have a nice cross on the hourly. "
"730560","731960"," This is D-U-L."
"735200","737980"," Looking for some kind of a dip by in here."
"739560","741460"," Possibly directly here today. "
"742700","747600"," And the DCA down here today at 146."
"749020","752000"," Well, pay attention to this one right here, Duolingo."
"754460","757380"," DoorDash has just been crushing it. "
"757380","760640"," It won't stop."
"760980","762560"," Can't stop, right?"
"762800","765200"," Somebody give me a roaring kitty bouncing head on this one."
"765420","767380"," Just ripping faces here. "
"768120","769760"," I want you to see what happens."
"770240","771600"," You're like that Duolingo, right?"
"771900","774880"," You've got this bounce that happened back here."
"775440","777280"," And then it just took off running, right?"
"777580","779020"," Look at this start here, Dash. "
"780100","782520"," Just leaving everyone behind."
"783360","786180"," Going to close gaps above, right?"
"786930","791020"," We have a target above of $102 or $100."
"791320","792560"," And it hasn't stopped. "
"792760","794020"," It just keeps going."
"796200","800520"," Now it is coming into right now a top."
"802140","804040"," So we're going to snap a line on this one. "
"804340","807400"," It's looking a little bit toppy right now, right where it's at."
"808280","810700"," But the next target above that is $93."
"812930","813840"," It's just moving. "
"815140","819960"," If you're looking to jump on this one, this yellow bar is hopefully a pullback here."
"822140","823260"," So this is Dash."
"823680","824220"," Damn, dude. "
"824460","825920"," Dash is just murdering it."
"826760","829140"," And then something like this, believe it or not."
"830620","834460"," There might be some consolidation here, but this is extremely bullish, too. "
"834720","835900"," Like 100 bucks dude minimum."
"836680","838680"," You see that blue line coming down right here?"
"839400","840840"," That's a month away, month away."
"840840","843740"," Yeah, 100 bucks price target still on Dash. "
"844080","845160"," If you're long Dash, congratulations."
"847180","847740"," Toast."
"848620","850260"," I mean, just look at toast. "
"851940","853380"," It's T-O-S-T."
"854580","856940"," This thing just keeps moving, right?"
"857400","858760"," Talked about this cross here, right?"
"859440","861040"," Talked about price over hourly."
"861540","863540"," Got the cross of the daily, cross of the weekly. "
"864520","865980"," Extremely bullish on this one."
"866840","868740"," Hit our first price target of $2,601."
"868740","870600"," Next price target, $30. "
"871180","874340"," Next price target, $36.90, then $43."
"875300","879040"," We have higher price targets, $50.60 here."
"879300","880900"," It is getting a little long in the tooth. "
"882200","883540"," So T-O-S-T."
"884560","886140"," Couple things to note here."
"886640","888640"," See how these sellers stepped in right here?"
"889400","895640"," If it can get above $26.10, we will trade this $30 range. "
"896260","899980"," Personally, I think you're going to find sellers and profit-takers."
"900540","906180"," You're going to be looking for a dip buy on this one here."
"907000","916180"," And more specifically, I would set an alert at $23.25 and $23. "
"916700","921560"," Get interested at $25 and down here at $23 if you're not already in."
"921740","922800"," I'm going to warn you guys of something."
"923840","925520"," You're following me out there, okay?"
"926480","928240"," But who warned you guys of something?"
"928880","930880"," I don't know if Joe Donuts in the house right now. "
"930880","932780"," I don't know if Quinn's here right now or not."
"934020","938140"," But some of you have been following me for multiple years."
"938380","940260"," Not just streaming, prior to streaming. "
"942060","943580"," I'm going to warn you guys of something."
"944740","951880"," There are people out there that have followed my individual stock picks for many years."
"951880","952900"," Very closely. "
"953440","955680"," They actually build ETFs on these things."
"956860","960420"," A lot of you have not followed my stock picks over the years."
"961240","963580"," You are going to look back from some of these picks. "
"964120","967560"," We've been talking about these picks now for weeks and weeks and weeks on end."
"968980","970500"," And you're going to be shocked."
"972360","977800"," You're going to come back in a year, nine months, whatever that time period is. "
"977800","980580"," And you're going to see."
"981680","987120"," When these things pop, when we're in a risk on these picks, they pop up in my scanner."
"988300","989780"," When we're in a risk off, they stop popping up. "
"990120","992040"," They're a good indicator for us being risk off."
"992240","993180"," Now, we do have one problem."
"993800","996440"," Some of these tickers, we shouldn't be picking. "
"997140","1000060"," If they're biotechs, they're very volatile."
"1000600","1003980"," Some of them are legitimately probably, I mean, they're great companies."
"1003980","1010300"," Maybe one of them, but they're very, they're very like seasonal or they're very like boom up. "
"1011380","1013040"," 300% down 300%."
"1013040","1015280"," We talk about that in some of these picks."
"1015480","1016200"," We'll look at some of those. "
"1017500","1021140"," Some of those are definitely like, hey, buy this now and don't chase it."
"1021460","1023300"," Or if you go up 300% you get out of it."
"1023680","1024640"," No, not all of them. "
"1025160","1026500"," But you can see toast here."
"1026800","1028960"," I'm going to warn you, you're going to, you're going to, you're going to be one of those people."
"1028960","1033099"," But there's some people in this stream probably, you know, watch me talk about these things. "
"1033099","1034200"," Week in, week out."
"1034900","1036020"," They're going to get on this stream."
"1036900","1041420"," And they're going to say should have bought or can I try by the dip now when it's 300 up"
"1041420","1042020"," 300%. "
"1043140","1043800"," You get me?"
"1044079","1045359"," Like it looks bullish now, cap."
"1046680","1048960"," So you should be looking for these dips to buy."
"1050380","1051600"," When I, when I review these, right?"
"1051760","1052920"," You don't have to jump on them right here. "
"1053740","1055340"," You don't have to jump on any of them."
"1057900","1062220"," The intent behind this or the education behind this is."
"1063240","1064820"," That if you at home. "
"1066040","1068280"," Can't have a basket of."
"1069060","1073020"," 100 200 300 1000 tickers."
"1073640","1075500"," That you create at home, right?"
"1076340","1077900"," Then you're not stuck. "
"1079040","1082220"," On having to trade just your favorite ticker."
"1082680","1086240"," Having to be waiting for your favorite ticker."
"1086340","1088780"," Sometimes I'll see people be like, I just love the sticker. "
"1088780","1093840"," I'm just going to jump into it and let my money sit there until it hits five weeks later, six"
"1093840","1094420"," weeks later."
"1095060","1098460"," I don't fucking know three months later and it doesn't hit, right?"
"1100160","1104860"," If you have a basket of these things, you can just set alerts at certain price levels."
"1105600","1109420"," And if the price runs away and you can't get on it, but somewhat something else does come to your"
"1109420","1110300"," price level to buy. "
"1111620","1112800"," Then you're good to go, right?"
"1112900","1114100"," You always got something to trade."
"1114800","1118820"," Another thing here too is that all these tickers have great ERs."
"1118920","1119780"," They've been repriced. "
"1120060","1121060"," They have great guidances."
"1121540","1123160"," They're coming into earnings season again."
"1123860","1129840"," You should do that fundamental analysis of these tickers that I call out and find out why I'm"
"1129840","1130560"," calling them out. "
"1131080","1133660"," These are also tickers that I pick."
"1135000","1140120"," Usually when the market is burning, I look for these tickers because they're out performing on days"
"1140120","1141300"," where the market is down."
"1142340","1147340"," It's lifting up the veil and the skirt of hedge funds that are while we're panic selling, they're"
"1147340","1149460"," focused on keeping this ticker afloat. "
"1151460","1157000"," Marketmakers hedge funds will push these tickers in the background quietly and then they'll become"
"1157000","1158460"," meme stocks down the road."
"1159060","1159680"," Maybe not today."
"1159940","1160380"," Maybe not tomorrow. "
"1161000","1162940"," Three months, six months, nine months down the road."
"1165320","1166880"," We'll do this for another year or two."
"1167020","1167880"," This is going to fascinate. "
"1168040","1173540"," We'll do it for the next few years, but now that it's public on a live stream, you guys are"
"1173540","1175360"," going to be able to witness this as it takes place."
"1177360","1181880"," There's TOST. This is Oscar Health. "
"1182040","1184680"," This is one of the ones where you have to be really careful when you buy it."
"1185640","1192860"," It's a very volatile stock, but it is still bullish and it is coming into its buy zone."
"1192860","1193900"," Right now. "
"1194220","1196180"," It is in a downtrend right now."
"1196700","1198700"," Did catch a bid this morning."
"1198980","1203800"," I don't like price below the yellow here and it did sell down below. "
"1204060","1209360"," We said don't buy this the other day, but we're starting to come into a bottoming pattern here."
"1209400","1210880"," Weekly is still coming up."
"1211320","1214160"," So overall, it is bullish here. "
"1216700","1219480"," So some kind of a dip by is producing itself."
"1219860","1221800"," I do want to see it go to at least this $11."
"1222840","1226580"," I'd get extremely bullish above it, but it is a health care stock, right?"
"1227520","1230280"," So Oscar Health, I like it right here right now. "
"1230860","1240660"," But personally, because of this stuff here, let's say if it can break above"
"1240660","1241200"," here."
"1242880","1243720"," And hold."
"1244680","1245960"," So I'm going to show you this here. "
"1246100","1247540"," So Oscar Health, it's next buy."
"1251570","1254610"," I want to see it like I don't care if it goes up right here."
"1255010","1256650"," Care about this part of the move. "
"1258090","1261630"," I don't care about I don't personally care about this part of the move."
"1261990","1264930"," I want to see it trade above."
"1267130","1267730"," $840. "
"1269070","1276150"," And if it can hold $8 at any point, hold $8 confirms a move higher."
"1277770","1279370"," It's worth looking at."
"1279510","1281330"," So send alert at $8 on it. "
"1282310","1286110"," And your price target above is going to be 1084."
"1287290","1290370"," 1084, they can recover here and hold eight bucks."
"1291050","1293070"," Definitely looking for 1084 in this one. "
"1295780","1297420"," Next one, Iowan Q."
"1298200","1299760"," Just been straight mooning."
"1300820","1303020"," All this went out weeks and weeks and weeks ago."
"1304640","1308960"," Extremely bullish, weekly racing up, daily racing up. "
"1310500","1312900"," Turning on its monthly price above its hourly."
"1314040","1316180"," Just a monster mover here, right?"
"1317220","1319240"," Monster mover, I-O-N-Q."
"1320340","1322780"," This thing is just like beast mode. "
"1323840","1325120"," It's beast mode."
"1328540","1332320"," Let's look at it on a daily chart and look what is it trying to do here, right?"
"1332780","1334200"," Look at price right here, right?"
"1334900","1338720"," This is a place to take profit, believe it or not, right here."
"1340100","1345340"," There's another couple of volatile zones up here. "
"1346140","1348280"," It's in the take, take the money and run."
"1348900","1356280"," So look for a dip buy if you want to jump back on this one at $13 or whatever this"
"1356280","1356700"," thing rolls."
"1357140","1358460"," This thing is hot sauce right now. "
"1359580","1365580"," If at any point it breaks above and holds $16.79, this thing is going to go, just start squeezing."
"1365580","1370160"," You've got targets to the upside of 1845."
"1371340","1377980"," It's $21.45, and believe it or not, $30, $32 up there. "
"1378520","1384660"," A little bit of a vol in here, but as this stuff starts to break above, it's going to get"
"1384660","1385940"," even more explosive here."
"1386460","1393780"," I-O-N-Q, if you can ever jump on this one, probably a pullback to $13.51. Jump on,"
"1393960","1395380"," strap in, that thing is amazing."
"1395640","1396760"," Look at that thing, I-O-N-Q. "
"1400270","1401830"," Here's another one right here, Bip."
"1402170","1404850"," I was going to post this one on Twitter today."
"1406130","1410070"," I was going to post this one on Twitter today because it's about ready. "
"1410830","1413270"," I want you to just pay attention to this trend here."
"1413710","1420230"," Another one, I don't know what the- I don't know exactly what- I think I'm good on the "
"1420230","1425490","- not how much this company is valued at, but at any rate."
"1425490","1426750"," See right here, I want you to see this. "
"1428430","1430470"," But, see trend going up right here?"
"1430690","1432490"," Watch that trend just heading higher, heading higher."
"1433410","1436210"," It's kind of elusive right now if it's worth trading."
"1436910","1438510"," There's another dip by down below. "
"1438710","1444060"," This is what I would say to you is, there's 208 down here, okay?"
"1446720","1456580"," If it can hold and maintain trend, send a letter like 314, but"
"1456580","1457500"," be careful."
"1457700","1458380"," Not even 314."
"1459380","1460200"," Couldn't say that. "
"1462100","1462780"," Up here."
"1469540","1470540"," Same kind of a deal."
"1470720","1474880"," If it can recover to 350, take the trade here. "
"1476060","1478820"," Don't try to buy this here unless you have a tight stop underneath."
"1479120","1480180"," If you want to buy this, you can't buy it."
"1488260","1491840"," You can't have this happen here and then a target of 208. "
"1492700","1494160"," Speak, be wary of this."
"1494380","1496440"," It is coming up weekly, saying it's coming up."
"1497260","1501360"," Daily is a little weak right now, but the weekly is the tell here that it's going to- that's"
"1501360","1503840"," going to get dip bought down here at 316 and move higher. "
"1505760","1508780"," It's going to- it's going to- it's going to- one, two, three."
"1509560","1510160"," I'm looking for all of this."
"1510160","1511420"," All time highs in this one. "
"1513060","1514980"," Four dollars, 24 cents."
"1515420","1517360"," Very volatile here."
"1517780","1518060"," Very volatile. "
"1518520","1518880"," Take her."
"1518960","1519660"," Be careful on this one."
"1519820","1522460"," But I like- I still like the company. "
"1523880","1524660"," Next one."
"1524980","1525340"," Peacore."
"1526700","1529520"," Bet nothing but baller here. "
"1530080","1530380"," By the dip."
"1530620","1530980"," By the dip."
"1532740","1533020"," Running it up. "
"1533220","1533620"," Running it up."
"1533880","1534820"," Top of the key right now."
"1535640","1537780"," Now, can it begin to go higher?"
"1537780","1540020"," I think this is- it's time right now. "
"1540900","1543200"," You see these sellers up here, right?"
"1544060","1546000"," And what happens is you wear out these sellers."
"1546200","1548520"," You come up here and this guy's like, nope, I just want out."
"1548720","1550160"," This guy goes, yep, I just want out. "
"1550740","1551900"," This guy goes, I just want out."
"1552320","1553800"," You do this three, four times."
"1554560","1557580"," You begin to break above here and have explosive moves. "
"1557900","1558240"," Peacore."
"1558760","1561580"," Looking to squeeze some faces off."
"1561760","1562820"," Here's the first one right there. "
"1563720","1565420"," Looking to squeeze some faces off."
"1565420","1566120"," Targets above."
"1566920","1576680"," 81.41. 87.88. 95.38. And it's going"
"1576680","1577400"," to go back. "
"1577580","1579860"," It's going to go back and like fail up here like $102."
"1580540","1581840"," This thing is just humming."
"1582380","1586480"," And at some point, this thing should just start ripping face to the upside. "
"1586920","1590320"," If you're looking for a dip to buy, you're like, I missed this one too, Cap."
"1591320","1592360"," Right down here."
"1592840","1593900"," 60 bucks hopefully. "
"1594820","1595880"," Set an alert at home."
"1596380","1598020"," If it does fail and rolls over."
"1601240","1603960"," Comes underneath and then you get your dip by here. "
"1605480","1605880"," Right?"
"1606080","1606560"," Something like that."
"1606860","1613060"," Set an alert at 63.51. 60 bucks flat on a capitulation move and then you get your fake up."
"1613360","1615840"," But I'm telling you like this one right here, ready to go right now. "
"1616060","1617240"," Like this right here."
"1617360","1621960"," One, two, three, usually an explosive move to the upside."
"1622200","1623280"," This is like classic right here. "
"1623820","1625100"," Like one, two, go."
"1625540","1628200"," And at worst, one, two and three and then boom."
"1629020","1630900"," It just rips and doesn't stop. "
"1631100","1634440"," So peak or ready to go super burr."
"1636480","1637000"," HCP."
"1638300","1642140"," I've been tracking this one for dip buys one, two, three. "
"1642220","1644360"," This one's getting there almost there."
"1644940","1646080"," I'm going to pay attention to this one."
"1646420","1648900"," See the see the weekly is flattening right here. "
"1650240","1652200"," See the daily is flattening."
"1652200","1655740"," See how you have violent moves down in the weekly and daily."
"1656160","1658040"," A flattening action. "
"1658380","1660500"," Still waiting on HCP, Hashi Corp to explode."
"1661120","1662220"," But this one looks really nice."
"1662560","1668020"," Even though it has a downtrend here, a downtrend channel, it's looking to explode higher. "
"1668360","1671700"," So keep your eye on this one here."
"1671820","1672780"," There's no new lows here."
"1672880","1673420"," I don't see any. "
"1673960","1676560"," We have alerts set to buy these dips down here."
"1677060","1677900"," Make that cleaner."
"1682780","1685460"," Now we had three places to set alerts to buy. "
"1685460","1688240"," We had 24 71 23 and 20."
"1688860","1690640"," I'm extremely bullish on this one."
"1690780","1698460"," Like today, like like by 27 94 with a stop underneath it and waiting for another squeeze to get up"
"1698460","1698660"," here. "
"1698940","1701920"," We have some pretty big targets to the upside on this one as well."
"1702660","1704620"," Just waiting for it to begin to start running."
"1704800","1705380"," Look at these targets. "
"1705400","1709860"," We've got 79 87 96 like all this stuff."
"1710260","1711840"," This one is ready to go."
"1711980","1712860"," It's been primed up. "
"1712860","1715700"," If you want something for the future, this is the one HCP."
"1719390","1719830"," Sholes."
"1720650","1723290"," I'm going to go with this one's ready to rip today. "
"1723670","1725030"," Like look at this here."

"1735330","1736210"," SH LS."
"1737510","1738290"," Look at it."
"1738470","1740070"," Just what does that look like to you?"
"1743390","1744630"," This one's disgusting. "
"1748450","1750150"," This one's really bad."
"1750630","1752990"," This one's like 30 bucks."
"1753430","1758050"," $29 30 31 easy. "
"1758990","1760650"," Actually price started in this one."
"1761290","1761890"," $36."
"1762990","1766810"," I'm going to just draw this one. "
"1766890","1768450"," This one's just ready to rock right now."
"1768510","1768670"," It's above."
"1768670","1769450"," It's above. "
"1769570","1769810"," It's monthly."
"1773510","1774050"," Bam."
"1774250","1774890"," And right there. "

"1784400","1786320"," Talking about this one for weeks, right?"
"1786540","1786800"," Look at this. "
"1787020","1787640"," This May."
"1788180","1790960"," It's September or November, February, April."
"1791120","1792300"," It's just it's just exploited. "
"1792620","1795300"," This is what's happening right now with shows, right?"
"1795560","1795980"," You see it?"
"1796360","1796460"," Boom."
"1796740","1801940"," It just starts blowing up and going north price target on this one."
"1801940","1802540"," Dude. "

"1805640","1806480"," Hit that target. "
"1811560","1812600"," 42 76."
"1813220","1815060"," Look at this giant gap back here."
"1817080","1819060"," Look at this gap back here. "
"1821460","1822480"," So the boom."
"1822600","1823300"," We're going to go through all these."
"1823300","1824020"," Then we're going to get to AMC. "
"1824900","1826200"," Got some nice red ones down here."
"1829100","1830000"," Hold on a second here."
"1832560","1834220"," Get some weirdness going on with my. "
"1835040","1836100"," Hold on one second here."
"1842020","1842800"," It's disgusting."
"1843820","1845020"," Like if you look at this stuff, right?"
"1846460","1847880"," Let me just look at this, right?"
"1849800","1850420"," See price. "
"1850460","1852140"," I'm going to mute one of these things here."
"1852280","1854080"," I'm going to mute this chat box over here."
"1865590","1868570"," So, I mean, prices below. "
"1869810","1872610"," Daily trigger is below, weekly is below over here, right?"
"1872850","1874230"," But then you've got the flattening out."
"1874790","1878130"," And now you've got price above hourly daily weekly."
"1879070","1881550"," This thing is like boom here, right?"
"1881830","1882310"," No problems. "
"1883270","1885210"," Take this one out up here at 70 bucks."
"1885870","1891070"," So right now it's trading $37 like 100% move right there setting up."
"1891980","1892310"," CFLT. "
"1896400","1897500"," Look at this one."
"1899880","1902000"," Let me get a drink of water here."
"1907660","1909220"," This one's primed, right?"
"1909520","1910220"," Primed up. "
"1911060","1914340"," Primed, primed, primed, primed."
"1915320","1917200"," Trading 396 right now."
"1918560","1922440"," Big cross down here at 273 confirmed the upside move. "
"1922760","1923120"," You see it?"
"1924140","1924660"," Right?"
"1924820","1926040"," Price now above the daily."
"1926920","1929820"," Huge bull crossing here on weekly, right?"
"1931280","1932560"," It's told, no, we're going up."
"1933040","1933640"," Wham, wham. "
"1933820","1934740"," Where do you think we're headed?"
"1935000","1937020"," We're going to close this whole fucking gap right here."

"1942780","1945200"," 80%, 70% move, something insane like that. "
"1946020","1946640"," Come back down."
"1947260","1948300"," Catch this daily again."
"1948520","1949140"," Catch this weekly. "
"1949980","1952500"," Off and running to even higher highs, right?"
"1953860","1954340"," SMRT."
"1956420","1956900"," SMRT."

"2197640","2205120"," 40.81. Right now it's coming in the test that's hourly at 43.88. If it can stay here, there"
"2205120","2206600"," might be a trade on this one today. "
"2206740","2209720"," If it confirms the move right where it is, it's going higher."
"2210040","2210420"," It's going to move."
"2211200","2218500"," If not, you're looking to buy this one, one, two, 42 bucks right there. "

"2242200","2247880"," 93.41. It also wants to fail up here at 98 dollars. "
"2247880","2248720"," Look at this thing."
"2250800","2252400"," Ready to explode."
"2254240","2255460"," This one's ready to go today. "
"2255720","2259760"," It's down at $1.82 and it's looking to just move to the upside."
"2264120","2265380"," Bam, just like that."
"2269420","2270440"," Unit T, baby. "
"2271760","2272580"," The big U."
"2272880","2274640"," We've been talking about this one for weeks here."
"2277300","2278740"," What's our price target on Unity?"
"2278740","2281360"," It was 71, but it looks like it's coming down."
"2282080","2284740"," Let's call it a clean set. "
"2285600","2287500"," We had 71, so 70."
"2290000","2292780"," I called a price target of 65 bucks even."
"2295060","2296320"," But it just keeps moving. "
"2296540","2297200"," Look at this stuff."
"2298940","2299700"," Man, dude."
"2300000","2301220"," This thing is going to crank too. "
"2301400","2303620"," If we can get there fast enough, maybe we get 70 bucks."
"2304960","2306600"," But look at this cross right here."
"2306700","2307700"," Look at this green box we drew. "
"2309260","2312920"," This thing just like ripped up, came down, bang, bang, bang."
"2313200","2314840"," One, two, and three."
"2315320","2315720"," Where's it going?"
"2316120","2316160"," Up. "
"2316580","2317140"," That's what it's doing."
"2317200","2317740"," It's going up."
"2318680","2321800"," If you can catch this one, 43 bucks, but it just nailed. "
"2321820","2323200"," It's 4850 target."
"2323580","2325360"," Next target above $56."
"2326100","2327280"," Looking for two buy ins. "
"2327840","2330860"," One, two, three, four, five, $43 flat."
"2331900","2334160"," Possibly 38 and a capitulation on unity."
"2338300","2341940"," IOT coming back down into its dip by, right?"
"2342740","2344000"," IOT to buy the dip. "
"2344560","2346040"," There's a confirmation right there."
"2346100","2348620"," This one's going to explode two fucking day."
"2349360","2351640"," It can get kind of slippery this one. "
"2351880","2356520"," It's getting a little long in the tooth on its daily, but its projection is upside."
"2356520","2361360"," So if you ever have a chance, snap an alert at week."
"2362440","2365180"," Snap an alert at just by 24, man. "
"2365400","2366140"," This thing's going to move."
"2367560","2368120"," IOT."
"2368700","2369760"," Where is it going?"
"2371180","2372260"," Look at this. "
"2372760","2374500"," All time highs on this one."
"2376380","2377500"," Is 3090."
"2380260","2380820"," 3090. "
"2381180","2382060"," Start drawing a."
"2383700","2384340"," What's the point?"
"2384720","2386440"," What's some of some upside targets, right?"
"2391740","2393260"," Outside target, 40 bucks."
"2394120","2395860"," We're just going to go straight 40 there."
"2396560","2398600"," If you break above 30 bucks, we're going to 40. "
"2402560","2404520"," Look at this one right here, right?"
"2405200","2406320"," Had a big cross on the weekly."
"2406640","2408280"," This is FLNC, baby."
"2409300","2410800"," Where's our price target on it?"
"2412560","2415100"," 3375 on FLNC. "
"2417300","2418980"," Right to the top right here."
"2419680","2420720"," Right to the top."
"2421620","2422100"," 3375. "
"2422320","2424880"," Look to take some profit once we get there."
"2427120","2429340"," She's, I got to start doing some measures on this stuff."
"2429540","2431560"," Like what's 60% above 3375?"
"2431960","2433020"," Anybody get the answer to that one?"
"2433560","2437240"," That's another $11.12 4050 bucks, maybe for this one. "
"2437500","2438880"," FLNC, Fluance Energy."
"2441720","2442600"," Lemonade, baby."
"2443380","2444380"," Where did it go?"
"2445760","2447200"," I mean, just look at lemonade. "
"2449580","2450560"," DCA, baby."
"2451060","2452220"," And where's it headed right now?"
"2452280","2456560"," It's straight 19 to $19.35. We have price target on it."
"2457900","2458420"," 2170. "
"2460560","2464080"," 2170 trying to push higher, break through these sellers up here."
"2464620","2467260"," I think we actually are, I think we might actually break it this time."
"2468000","2470260"," So we're going to give some new projections on this one. "
"2470840","2476980"," We're going to get projections of 23 and a fight because this is going to be a giant rip."
"2479420","2480420"," 30 bucks."
"2483560","2486880"," Lemonade could get really spicy. "
"2486880","2491640"," Really spicy, like you're getting like a."
"2494900","2495740"," Bam, bam."
"2496080","2499020"," This is going to be a big like, no, no, no, we're not going to allow that to happen."
"2499080","2500340"," And then just a face ripper. "
"2505120","2507120"," Just a face ripper right there."
"2507360","2507940"," You can see it right."
"2508380","2508420"," Bam. "
"2509320","2510540"," Weekly turns up."
"2512200","2514320"," Chop, chop, chop, fair, fair, fair."
"2514560","2516720"," Maybe a quick dip down then bam to the upside. "
"2518240","2520380"," 3260 high target on that one."
"2521100","2522080"," That's lemonade."
"2524460","2525060"," Frito. "
"2528180","2531200"," Technology just keeps coming along here, here, here."
"2531920","2532900"," Never even came back."
"2533140","2536320"," Did grab this one right here confirming the move to the upside. "
"2537360","2539420"," Hit the first target we had at 1729."
"2540260","2543620"," If it's price can stay above 1627."
"2544100","2545180"," Where does it go?"
"2546520","2548480"," We already tagged this one above, right?"
"2548700","2549580"," You can see it right here. "
"2552340","2553940"," What's the next move for it?"
"2554000","2554220"," Look at it."
"2554240","2555280"," It's got two."
"2555460","2556080"," This is insane. "
"2557620","2560140"," All time highs right here already took it out."
"2560980","2564120"," Trying to slam it down, slam it down, trying to sell it right now."
"2564860","2566380"," I'd have to measure this one, man. "
"2566760","2571420"," Probably put a 609 price target $29 on it."
"2574080","2575500"," $29 bucks way up there."
"2577340","2581780"," I'm like in my brain trying to do these as fast as possible without actually measuring them. "
"2582780","2584160"," This is a rumble."
"2584260","2585760"," This one's been a concern to me."
"2586200","2587700"," I haven't been happy with this one. "
"2587860","2590100"," This is one of these ones where I'm like, I don't know."
"2590880","2592300"," Hasn't made any new lows."
"2592920","2595480"," Higher low, higher low, lower low, higher low. "
"2600520","2601400"," I don't know."
"2601400","2603400"," You might want to short this one."
"2604480","2606100"," Right now I'm bearish on this one. "
"2606200","2606840"," I'm not happy with it."
"2607480","2614540"," I'm not going to be happy with it unless you get above, let's say, $9.25. I'm really scary at"
"2614540","2614900"," this $10."
"2616160","2616940"," It's a rumble. "
"2617020","2618000"," I'm going to check on this one."
"2619280","2624160"," It's got a great company, but they're trying to still short this."
"2624400","2624960"," Boom, boom, boom. "
"2625180","2634780"," If it does start to squeeze, though, at any point, it's going to hit $11.25. $12.26."
"2638240","2642080"," $13.78 and $17."
"2642320","2646860"," This one has a lot of potential in it, but it's still in this consolidation phase here."
"2647020","2647980"," Maybe add down here. "
"2652280","2657300"," You don't buy this now, but just have some kind of a, yeah, if it ever gets down here, it's"
"2657300","2657800"," kind of a thing."
"2658800","2664920"," If it ever gets down to five, five, six bucks, seven bucks, whatever it does, something like that"
"2664920","2669940"," might be worth a consideration for an upside move, but it has potential down the road."
"2670540","2671640"," This one's been hit. "
"2671900","2675940"," This one's been, this one's been pinging me and pinging me, but hasn't produced anything yet."
"2677280","2678800"," T G T."
"2678800","2681140"," T R J."
"2683100","2683580"," Target."
"2684240","2685440"," Had an attempt, right?"
"2687340","2688640"," No, had another attempt. "
"2688940","2690400"," No, no, no."
"2690500","2691080"," Why is that?"
"2691280","2692380"," Do y'all know why that is?"
"2695000","2696780"," Because of the squeeze right here, right?"
"2697580","2700400"," Weekly is coming down, but I want to show you something on Tar J."
"2702440","2705940"," So Tar J to most people would look very bearish."
"2706740","2709900"," I'm going to see this is the daily, uh, a fellow down here. "
"2709920","2710940"," See how it's turning up?"
"2712360","2715420"," This turning up right here, right, is telling a different story."
"2715420","2718080"," It's saying, no, this, we're not going this way."
"2718560","2721480"," This is like calling ambulance, but not for me kind of a trade. "
"2722400","2724440"," And then it gets really explosive here."
"2725220","2730840"," Uh, if price at any point can get above, I'd be interested in this one for it's ER two."
"2731640","2735880"," If price at any point gets above one thirty four oh nine. "
"2736500","2742420"," It's going to make a major move like one thirty four and then a target of one fifty on T"
"2742420","2742880"," G T."
"2743020","2744080"," So just keep your eyes on this one."
"2744120","2745280"," It's primed up ready to go."
"2745680","2750280"," I think it's there right now, to be honest with you, but, uh, if you can get above like today"
"2750280","2754360"," or tomorrow one thirty three one thirty four and it can hold. "
"2755440","2758340"," Uh, it's primed like this thing is ready to move."
"2758340","2760960"," This is one to keep like open somewhere in the background."
"2761440","2764720"," It gets some kind of unknown news that it's literally straight up. "
"2766000","2768360"," You can see it because of this fellow right here."
"2768800","2770020"," It's telling a different story."
"2770420","2772040"," If you're looking at T G T in a regular chart. "
"2773320","2774960"," You'll sometimes see me go on Twitter."
"2775520","2776600"," Uh, and tickers like this."

"2788500","2792100"," I'll say you know that ticker that you think is going to the depths of hell. "
"2792900","2793640"," You're wrong."
"2794460","2795880"," Uh, and this is one of them."
"2796040","2800620"," This is one of those ones where, uh, there's a bear trap in waiting here. "
"2801640","2803380"," Uh, so just, just a heads up."
"2803520","2804060"," This thing is rated."
"2804260","2807860"," I just go monster like one day you just wake up and it's up ten percent. "
"2809380","2810620"," T G T."
"2810880","2812560"," I know some of you are along that ticker too."
"2812560","2816240"," Uh, might need a leap or a six month call on or something like that."
"2816920","2820840"," Maybe there's a low coming into their earnings and then it just rips. "
"2821000","2824480"," If that thing doesn't print into their earnings, remind me because."
"2825420","2826800"," I want to buy that fucking thing."
"2826800","2830280"," Like if that thing, if that thing just keeps going down pinned until they get into their ER. "
"2831140","2836780"," Uh, I want to buy fucking, uh, the next that calls for that ER at like the close that day."

"2851340","2853640"," Uh, so I'm having mixed feeling on this one. "

"2855520","2856980"," Dips been bought, bought, bought."
"2857800","2860480"," Uh, this is a tough call on this one. "
"2860740","2861820"," I think this one has."
"2862220","2866380"," If this one ever gets below 660, it's going to start burning really bad."
"2866880","2869360"," You see the daily turning down at the weeklies turning down on it. "
"2869360","2873000"," Though it has a big potential to rip higher."
"2873280","2877160"," So, uh, what you're looking for now is you got to buy a buy down here in the monthly."
"2877160","2878800"," It's saying no, we're still bullish here. "
"2879540","2881320"," Daily and weekly are disagreeing."
"2881760","2884040"," Has a lot of squeeze potential right where it is."
"2884860","2887420"," If it can get above, this one's a very dangerous stock, man. "
"2888620","2890620"," I hate these pharmaceutical stocks."
"2890860","2891040"," I do."
"2891300","2892000"," Some of you love them. "
"2892100","2892920"," I can't stand them."
"2894140","2898380"," Anything above, uh, 748, 753 is a buy."
"2898380","2901240"," Do not buy this one long unless it's above right. "
"2902060","2903000"," Uh, 750."
"2903360","2905960"," It has to be above 750 for the move higher."
"2906880","2909200"," I know you guys, you guys probably already long this down here. "
"2911420","2914520"," And you're looking for that right there."
"2916160","2920800"," Uh, but dude, this ever breaks below this thing ever, ever breaks below."

"3043820","3044580"," You guys remember, right?"
"3045080","3046400"," I already told you where it was going, right?"

"3112720","3113540"," Right there."
"3114960","3117800"," I don't think it's coming back down here to 220."
"3117820","3119580"," I think we're done with that 220 shit. "
"3119580","3122260"," So if it does roll down."
"3123160","3127700"," If there's like market, I don't know, weakness, something like that."
"3128100","3129480"," The price target is still 300. "
"3130100","3134440"," This thing is moving like Tesla today, tomorrow, Monday."
"3136600","3138260"," It's just gone, man."

"3169400","3173540"," It's like an inevitable squeeze running over these shorts. "
"3173940","3175100"," What's my ultimate prediction on Tesla?"
"3175960","3181740"," I have posted that and deleted it many times on Twitter because I don't want everybody to know,"
"3181900","3182020"," right?"
"3182860","3188820"," I've actually given the reasons on Twitter why it was going to go to where it's going to ultimately"
"3188820","3189100"," go."
"3189700","3190760"," It's way up here, guys."
"3191700","3193480"," Way, way up here. "

"3219200","3222260"," We're going to start doing this like we're going to start doing this."
"3222440","3223980"," Some big moves up here."
"3225460","3226880"," Like big 350. "

"3250960","3251660"," But I want to tell you guys something."
"3251780","3257300"," If we trade 500 into the first of the year, January, February, March, something like that, we trade"
"3257300","3259180"," some hot, really high and crazy. "
"3262760","3263780"," And I'm exiting."
"3268050","3269450"," You see that move right there?"
"3269570","3269910"," You see that?"
"3270030","3270990"," Do you see it right here?"
"3271330","3272430"," Do you fucking see this?"
"3274750","3276170"," Like, I want to tell you guys something."
"3276410","3276590"," Okay. "
"3280680","3282080"," There's your 400 right there."

"3288160","3288340"," Okay."
"3288700","3289920"," This is between you and I in a wall."
"3292280","3302140"," If you come find me on Ben Twitt and we're trading 500, you start telling me why am I being"

"3336560","3339260"," I tell you to get fucked, I don't want to hear it."
"3339340","3342780"," Like, I don't want to hear you out there saying it's at 500 bucks and buying it. "
"3343560","3344560"," I'm all bullish."
"3345780","3347440"," Don't be missing this run right here."
"3347520","3348740"," You see this coming up right now?"
"3349480","3353380"," He just longed the fuck out of Tesla. "

"3364600","3365580"," Fuck you, cap. "
"3366080","3367260"," You don't know what you're talking about."
"3367520","3368960"," I literally have people up here."
"3368960","3369860"," Call my cursor. "
"3370640","3374720"," Like, I'm exiting here and people are just getting long in here."
"3375920","3380420"," People send me DMs that they bought a million dollars or two million dollars."
"3380700","3381180"," I kid you not. "
"3381760","3382600"," Like, screenshot it."
"3383000","3384960"," I just bought a million dollars of Tesla, like, right here."
"3386960","3388200"," I'm telling you, that's what they do. "
"3389100","3394620"," Those people are going to be exiting right here in this pullback because they're so upset and"
"3394620","3396820"," they've been angry Tesla bulls the entire time."
"3398240","3399100"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3399520","3402980"," So they haven't beat inflation."
"3403600","3405040"," They're so fucking upside down. "
"3405100","3405660"," It's I'm funny."
"3406640","3411640"," So if you remember me back here exiting and telling you was going there back then, you guys, some"
"3411640","3413700"," of you guys remember me telling you where it was going back then."
"3413800","3415660"," Some of you guys know me. "
"3416020","3416940"," Some of you guys have known."
"3417020","3419840"," Some of you guys have actually known me for like about eight to 10 years."
"3420680","3422700"," Way back at Wall Street Beth's days. "
"3422720","3425900"," Way back when Elon was on Wall Street Beth."
"3425900","3429500"," Some of you guys know me for Twitter for many years saying the corrections over."
"3429680","3430440"," We're going to take this rep. "
"3430440","3431360"," We're going to take that rep."
"3431460","3432260"," We're going to take that rep."
"3432580","3434120"," We're going to sell it down to the depths of hell. "
"3434320","3435180"," Remember 100 bucks?"
"3436520","3439720"," Remember the 135 155 all this stuff here."
"3439860","3442820"," So you'd be a happy Tesla bull."
"3443780","3447440"," You always want to be like a buyer of Tesla during fear. "
"3447960","3452980"," You want to be very tactful and you always want to be a happy owner of Tesla."
"3454160","3459420"," People on fin to it Tesla fucking gang and Tesla bulls are two different people."
"3460620","3466920"," And there's like there's a guy like me that might own Tesla for a dollar or $10 or fucking. "
"3467480","3468920"," I'm serious like 10 bucks."
"3469840","3472660"," And so I'm always going to tell you to buy Tesla."
"3473400","3477000"," I'm always going to tell you to buy this because you're only helping me get richer. "
"3477140","3477680"," Does that make sense?"
"3478220","3482860"," So the voices that you hear out there that you think that you trust may not always be."
"3482860","3484740"," Accurate for you and your situation."
"3485680","3493320"," If you're not worth $20 million, $30 million, $100 million, then you're fucking likely should stop"
"3493320","3496240"," fucking listening to some of these Tesla bulls. "
"3497360","3501400"," It's always better to be a happy Tesla owner."
"3501840","3505820"," If you're going to own Tesla, you want to be buying at the bottoms never at the tops."
"3506460","3507640"," It's a different experience. "
"3507640","3513440"," Because if you own them down here, then you're going to be telling other people, yeah, man, by it,"
"3513460","3514460"," dude, it's going to fucking 2000."
"3515220","3516280"," It's going to 5,000."
"3516340","3517660"," It's going to 30,000. "
"3517680","3518620"," It's going to 50,000."
"3519580","3521040"," You don't ever want to be the buyer up here."
"3521120","3523580"," You don't ever want to be listening to people telling you out there. "
"3524520","3525400"," Buy it at the ties."
"3525620","3526460"," Buy it at its lows."
"3526680","3527280"," It doesn't matter. "
"3527420","3528200"," It's just going to go up."
"3528520","3529460"," It's not the way to invest."
"3529880","3531600"," You're actively managing your money. "
"3531700","3533340"," It's always better to be buying the dips here."
"3534960","3541800"," So don't come fucking find me at 500 and say I'm buying because you're going to get rolled here and"
"3541800","3543280"," you're going to be always upside down."
"3543500","3546660"," This asshole here is going to be this asshole here. "
"3546940","3548180"," He's never going to be happy."
"3548800","3552760"," He's going to be the guy that's always going to tell you to buy because he's fucking upside down."
"3553460","3556080"," I don't know if I can clarify that for you. "
"3557000","3560640"," I'm not being precise this morning with this shit, but I'm telling you."
"3561660","3564640"," I'm fucking telling you like last time."
"3565840","3567180"," Last time on Tesla. "
"3568780","3569980"," Don't be the top buyer."
"3570180","3571880"," Don't be this fucking asshole up here."
"3571900","3573240"," Don't be this asshole here. "
"3573640","3575660"," Don't be this asshole here here and here."
"3575980","3581540"," These are the people with the lot of voices or the two people that are part of the lot of"
"3581540","3585940"," voices are fucked up upside down or own it for $9."
"3586400","3589660"," If you don't own it for $9, stop listening to those people. "
"3590540","3590900"," Right?"
"3591240","3596860"," If you're not upside down and you're like, I'm a Tesla bull, buy the fucking lows in mass and hold"
"3596860","3599000"," them for as long as you possibly can."
"3599760","3601700"," Always want to be this guy down here."
"3601980","3602600"," Buy in this one. "
"3602760","3603380"," Buy in that one."
"3603540","3604160"," Buy in this one."
"3604500","3605280"," Buy in that one. "
"3605440","3606080"," Buy in this one."
"3606240","3606840"," Buy in that one."
"3606980","3607680"," Buy in this one. "
"3607940","3609020"," You always want to be that guy."
"3609140","3610240"," Buy in this one right here."
"3610860","3611900"," Buy in this one right here. "
"3613080","3613800"," Does that make sense?"
"3614120","3615160"," You always want to be a happy Tesla bull."
"3615920","3620120"," When Tesla rolls down, you find out who actually is happy."
"3620560","3621540"," You're like, fuck that shit. "
"3621640","3622160"," I bought the bottom."
"3622340","3622700"," I'm fine."
"3623480","3623940"," Make sense?"
"3624900","3626040"," You want to be that guy. "
"3626180","3627580"," You want to be the bottom buyer on Tesla."
"3628240","3632500"," If you ever get a chance by 220, get another chance by 253."
"3633360","3635180"," Tesla's going to fucking moon. "
"3635860","3639320"," They're going to launch a truck and they're going to launch FSD exclusive."
"3640220","3643540"," And claim that it's the, you know, FSD four."
"3643920","3645640"," It's bullshit, but it doesn't matter. "
"3645700","3646360"," They're going to price it in."
"3646900","3649520"," There's going to be like a mad rage for it coming up."
"3649520","3651380"," So, excuse me, Tesla. "
"3652660","3653880"," Tesla, Tesla, Tesla."
"3654640","3656400"," Be a good Tesla bull."
"3656640","3657440"," Be a good one. "
"3659420","3659860"," AMC."
"3663690","3665270"," Coming down, coming down, coming down."
"3665650","3667070"," Why do I like AMC right now?"
"3669970","3671930"," Let's talk about why I like AMC. "
"3674530","3675730"," I'm going to show you right now."
"3675850","3676570"," Let's clean some of this up."
"3679370","3681070"," Why do I like AMC?"
"3683170","3685030"," See this big bad boy right here?"
"3685510","3686510"," Watch my fucking cursor. "
"3688010","3689010"," See that right there?"
"3691570","3692830"," See that right there?"
"3692970","3693750"," That's why I like AMC."
"3695090","3695850"," See this right here?"
"3696770","3697930"," That's why I like AMC."
"3698350","3699090"," See this right here?"
"3700290","3701430"," That's why I like AMC. "
"3701710","3702130"," You want to see it?"
"3703670","3704870"," I'll tell you why I like AMC."
"3705910","3707990"," Why do I, that's 30 minute charts, right?"
"3708090","3709090"," Here's a big one right here."
"3709970","3711450"," Here's another one big one right here. "
"3711570","3712390"," Lines right up, right?"
"3712710","3713630"," Another big one right here."
"3713770","3714330"," Lines right up."
"3714450","3714910"," Watch this. "
"3715790","3717870"," I want you to see how it runs on."
"3717990","3718350"," It's daily."
"3718770","3719330"," See this right here?"
"3720170","3721490"," It's going to start fucking ripping. "
"3722210","3724190"," It's already been a beautiful dip bite out of 389."
"3724190","3726350"," It's getting rejected right now."
"3726810","3732310"," But even so, this is like, this is what happens when you squeeze, right?"
"3732550","3737130"," So up here pushes up firmly rejected, ready to be bought again. "
"3737390","3739350"," So what you're looking for here, I'm going to show it to you."
"3739850","3744570"," What you're looking for to get long on AMC."
"3745270","3748050"," So see this yellow line right here in this green line?"
"3748790","3749950"," You're looking for price. "
"3750490","3752210"," You're not entering AMC here."
"3752210","3757910"," What you're looking for is price to get above here, right?"
"3758150","3759190"," And start to hold."
"3760170","3761050"," Not one bar. "
"3761250","3762210"," You need two minimum."
"3764090","3766270"," So if you can get price, you see them."
"3766410","3766870"," I want to show you. "
"3766990","3768590"," This is an important thing to learn about trading."
"3770470","3772110"," So AMC, right?"
"3772990","3776190"," Whenever you have a squeeze on AMC, any ticker, doesn't matter what it is."
"3776490","3777810"," You have the initial move, right?"
"3779030","3781070"," You never buy that first bounce. "
"3781550","3782310"," Does that make sense?"
"3782650","3784670"," So this one right here, you shouldn't be long here."
"3784850","3787990"," Like you see the first squeeze up, you don't buy that bounce."
"3788190","3791850"," You wait for two, one, two, and then it rips. "
"3792410","3793490"," See how I drew this in?"
"3793710","3795170"," One, two, and then it rips."
"3795410","3797930"," One, two, three, one, two, three rips."
"3798790","3802090"," You have your, you're ready to go here, right?"
"3802270","3803230"," You're ready to go here. "
"3804250","3806170"," Not on your first trip up."
"3806350","3807890"," Matter of fact, I'm going to show you spy here."
"3807890","3809310"," See this move right here?"
"3809390","3810350"," I want to show you something on spy. "
"3811050","3811950"," Hold on a second here."
"3813190","3814270"," Or no, we'll leave this up."
"3814650","3815190"," Hold on a second here. "
"3815190","3816270"," I want to show you spy real quick."
"3817150","3818250"," An example of this."
"3833380","3834700"," So this is spy, okay?"
"3836100","3838020"," This is, I think it was last Friday. "
"3839220","3840380"," Get the initial move up."
"3841060","3841860"," Big move, right?"
"3843120","3843760"," Big move."
"3843920","3845120"," And you're like, woo hoo, mama bowl. "
"3845380","3846240"," Yeah, everything's awesome."
"3847640","3849760"," Should you, should you be buying this right here?"
"3849760","3851520"," Fuck no, just see how it didn't hold."
"3851880","3853320"," It broke right below. "
"3854140","3855220"," And then it came up."
"3855680","3857480"," See how you have the breakouts?"
"3860000","3862400"," Confirmation, confirmation, confirmation."
"3863580","3865240"," Then you get your explosive move, right?"
"3865780","3866600"," See the difference here?"
"3867180","3867620"," Big move up. "
"3868060","3869220"," No confirmation, right?"
"3869980","3871100"," Should you have bought here?"
"3871540","3871880"," Fuck no."
"3872140","3874600"," You're waiting for one, two, three, then the move."
"3875480","3878120"," You're just in waiting, lying in wait for it. "
"3878240","3878760"," Does that make sense?"
"3879740","3881880"," So let's go back to AMC really quick."
"3887060","3888760"," Same setup as spy, right?"
"3889280","3890300"," Bloodbath over here."
"3890460","3891180"," Oh God, we're dying. "
"3891400","3891780"," It's terrible."
"3892320","3893200"," It doesn't mean shit."
"3893420","3896940"," The only thing you're looking for here is two things to happen. "
"3897580","3902060"," You're looking for the daily, the hourly cross of the daily trigger right here."
"3904380","3904900"," Right?"
"3905100","3909880"," You're looking for the daily trigger to get above the, excuse me, the hourly trigger to get above"
"3909880","3910760"," the hourly trigger."
"3912280","3913580"," There's your yellow, right?"
"3914380","3916720"," And you're still not trying to buy this dip. "
"3916880","3918720"," You're not, don't ever dip by this shit."
"3919480","3922160"," You're looking for price to move up."
"3922580","3924080"," I'm just gonna make this a darker green. "
"3927560","3929520"," Price to move up and consolidate."
"3930340","3932580"," One, two, minimum."
"3933740","3934840"," Be ready to buy calls. "
"3935180","3942460"," If it starts to move above and breaks above these two previous highs, you're ready to go right"
"3942460","3942800"," there."
"3943840","3945560"," That's your money shot right there."
"3946720","3947360"," Do you know what I'm saying?"
"3948080","3950340"," Now, do I think this is going to go up and squeeze?"
"3950720","3950980"," I do. "
"3951680","3952500"," I do."
"3952620","3954640"," I think AMC is primed today, tomorrow."
"3954980","3955840"," I don't know if it's over the weekend. "
"3956160","3956500"," I don't care."
"3956960","3957560"," Whatever it is."
"3958100","3960860"," The moment this thing gets above right and confirms. "
"3963580","3964480"," It's going to rip."
"3964840","3968580"," It's going to rip like monster faces off right there."
"3968580","3970640"," Pass to confirm. "
"3973080","3974120"," Above 445."
"3974560","3976040"," Now it's coming down a little bit."
"3976160","3978260"," So 445 right now. "
"3980340","3982060"," Where's the price target in this one?"
"3982700","3983220"," 519."
"3983800","3985400"," We see five bucks even."
"3988740","3989580"," I'm doing here. "
"3989640","3990200"," Hold on a second here."
"3993860","3994980"," Five bucks even."
"3995360","3997240"," If it can break above that five bucks. "
"3997240","3999800"," Let's draw this."
"4001380","4002440"," I'm looking for like that."
"4002620","4003340"," I'm looking for this here. "
"4003500","4003640"," Boom."
"4007880","4010560"," And then have that hourly trigger catch it and it's going to go to the moon."
"4011200","4011800"," See you right there. "
"4012660","4014280"," You're going to get resistance up here."
"4014340","4015060"," Five dollars guaranteed."
"4015540","4016860"," This thing is going to come down. "
"4017460","4019440"," Actually, this is going to push you straight down right here."
"4027400","4030620"," On this trip here, if you can get above five bucks and hold it."
"4031420","4032320"," It's going to. "
"4032440","4033740"," It's going to fucking moon."
"4037560","4038200"," 591."
"4039940","4042620"," You got some great movies coming out this summer. "
"4042760","4047280"," You got people buying AMC movie theater tickets for Barbie and for."
"4047860","4050540"," Openheimer about tickets the other day for openheimer."
"4051900","4052920"," Price target. "
"4054760","4056360"," Yeah, a 21 right there."
"4057020","4061650"," Hey, 21 right there."
"4067030","4068230"," Gets above. "
"4068710","4072210"," It's it's weekly that at that point and it's straight shot."
"4074230","4076230"," See it right right there."
"4076730","4077330"," Moon time. "
"4078070","4079670"," Moon time AMC."
"4083080","4087220"," Look at that half 451 36 coming all the way back down here."
"4087220","4088580"," You holding your put still please. "
"4088580","4091620"," Did you take your calls over here and hold on your puts."
"4097729","4101670"," Hopefully take your calls like I said back here and hopefully held your puts back over here."
"4102130","4104770"," And you'll print both sides for spy today. "
"4116880","4119439"," Did you take your calls up here like I told you to earlier right here."

"4163200","4163880"," the close today. "

"4232400","4233180"," See how dip was bought."
"4233460","4234600"," Big explosive move to the upside."
"4236320","4238220"," But what do we know about price here. "
"4238560","4240040"," If you're a bear want to show you something."
"4240180","4241200"," If you're a sell side want to show you something."
"4241460","4242000"," See this right here. "

"4245040","4250300"," And I want you to see this white line right here okay."
"4252100","4254240"," Take your money and run by the way if you're on the sell side. "
"4254880","4255620"," We're going to get a squeeze here."
"4255620","4256840"," You should get a squeeze here."
"4258480","4259000"," Hold on. "
"4263450","4264290"," You should get a squeeze."
"4265130","4266150"," Maybe get a little bit more blood."
"4267990","4271490"," Maybe maybe you tag up 449 24 but I want to show you guys something here. "

"4367960","4369560"," And I'm going to explain to you why."
"4370700","4373320"," See how price above white, white's above red."
"4375240","4376820"," Do you see the cross right here?"
"4380700","4381660"," Just bam. "
"4382500","4382980"," Bam."
"4383780","4384920"," Rejection right there."
"4385500","4386080"," Bam to the downside. "
"4387200","4387960"," See it right here?"
"4388700","4389260"," Price goes below."
"4389860","4390900"," Get the nice cross right here."
"4390980","4391360"," See the cross?"
"4393380","4394820"," Not as easy to see there. "
"4395700","4396180"," Fails."
"4396860","4397420"," Boom to the downside."
"4398180","4398720"," Boom to the downside. "
"4400220","4403780"," So in a five minute chart is trend changing."
"4403780","4404700"," See it?"
"4405000","4406060"," It's like trend change."
"4406360","4407080"," There's one right here. "
"4407780","4408900"," Second one right there."
"4409020","4410400"," Big move power move down right."
"4410940","4412440"," First bear cross goes down. "
"4413380","4414240"," Let it up for air."
"4414640","4415760"," And then boom it goes down."
"4416120","4417240"," You see the trend change?"
"4417960","4419160"," See how this goes. "
"4420420","4422060"," See how a trend reversal goes."
"4422820","4423240"," See it right here?"
"4424160","4424700"," Cross right there."
"4425520","4426300"," Bam, bam, bam. "
"4426520","4427060"," Down right."
"4428000","4431760"," So it hasn't happened yet but we could be getting a trend."
"4431760","4432940"," We could be topping finally. "
"4435680","4437300"," So see how there's a bounce right here?"
"4438740","4439960"," I'm going to see this here."
"4442980","4443740"," Buy the dip."
"4445860","4446300"," Right?"
"4446820","4449900"," And look for a rejection at 450-44. "
"4451000","4452740"," So we'll do another red box right there."
"4458060","4460800"," And I'll write the path that bears going to want to take."
"4461620","4463620"," So you put the initial bounce right here. "
"4466600","4470660"," I don't want to do this job here right here."
"4475110","4476690"," I'm going to do an enter button."
"4478910","4481330"," I'm going to get this looking a little bit nicer. "
"4484830","4485350"," Get that yellow."
"4488970","4493890"," The power move though for bears is, so you go up here, reject down."
"4494970","4496190"," This one goes right here. "
"4497610","4503800"," I have to fucking delete that shit."
"4514020","4515560"," There's the power move right there."
"4521100","4523400"," If you're a bear, let me move that over. "
"4526160","4532980"," If we're a bearish here, if you're looking for a big, I might take this trade with you if this"
"4532980","4533300"," happens."
"4533740","4541280"," So this is where, if this happens, I'm going to enter a put trade"
"4541280","4544660"," right there."
"4560120","4562540"," Because that would signal a trend reversal. "
"4564480","4573720"," If I clean this up so you can actually see it."
"4589420","4591520"," If we get back like right here."
"4593980","4597540"," If you're a bull and you're trying to buy this, you can buy this right here. "
"4597940","4598860"," Take your calls off."
"4599520","4600560"," Second trade is above."
"4601800","4606460"," From 450.07 to 450.43. It will make this white. "
"4606760","4607040"," Make it easier."
"4613630","4622940"," If you're bullish here, you need price to, if you're bullish here, you need price to break above,"
"4623940","4626880"," come down, confirm, and then you can go to the upside."
"4629200","4632100"," Your next trade is up here like 450 and change. "
"4633500","4637360"," 450.75. This is all dangerous for you as a bull."
"4637540","4638220"," You've got no trade here."
"4639460","4640740"," You've got no long time trade here. "
"4641660","4642820"," You have to get above this."
"4644300","4645640"," You'll fail right here."
"4648480","4650320"," Then you'll make this high right here. "
"4652380","4653360"," Something like that."
"4654780","4658080"," That over right there."
"4660180","4661440"," I'm going to be able to see it. "
"4662420","4663520"," No man's land in here."
"4664280","4665880"," Take the money and run off that down move."
"4666640","4667400"," No man's land. "
"4667900","4670620"," Now trade is higher or below to go lower."
"4671800","4674200"," If you want my take on where we're going here."
"4675020","4678440"," Are we trending down into next week?"
"4678700","4678780"," Yes. "
"4680100","4680960"," Not down."
"4681380","4690040"," I'm going to say sideways and waiting for, I'm going to say sideways and ramping and dumping into"
"4690040","4692800"," ER, into ERs for specific tickers."
"4693540","4700240"," I think the sideways earnings trade will start trade and zero dates on closes on major earnings. "
"4702220","4704660"," We'll synthetically trade all these tech companies."
"4708240","4709660"," If we get back here, I'll buy some puts."
"4712100","4713780"," Is that easier for you guys to see that?"
"4713920","4714580"," Does that help you guys?"
"4717920","4718340"," Hold on. "
"4718400","4719540"," I've got to do something here."
"4720840","4722780"," I've got some real wonkiness going on here."
"4722940","4723440"," Hold on a second here. "
"4738770","4739610"," Hold on a second here."
"4747200","4750780"," My chat is set to like 60% or something."
"4750940","4752880"," I can barely see what you guys are saying in the chat. "
"4756430","4760410"," Can I explain how you knew that the squeeze was coming into take profit on puts?"
"4762210","4763010"," Yeah, definitely."
"4765030","4766810"," You see the squeeze right now coming down?"
"4767490","4768870"," This is what I had said this morning."
"4769010","4772030"," If you guys are here since the beginning of the broadcast, I said take the money and run here. "
"4773390","4775350"," I said take money and run here, right?"
"4775550","4777330"," On the count calls, take calls here."
"4778330","4780970"," I'm going to explain both reasons for both right now."
"4781750","4782730"," Take call profit here. "
"4782790","4783610"," This is what I said this morning."
"4783810","4784910"," On this bar, I said it, right?"
"4786810","4789430"," Right on that bar, I think I said take the money and run."
"4791190","4792730"," Now, it went a little bit higher, right?"
"4796730","4798230"," But we're going to talk about something here. "
"4800090","4800970"," It's a good question."
"4801190","4802170"," I'm going to explain it to you right now."
"4804030","4812690"," So for me, even on a strangle, everything is directional if the dates are so close. "
"4813230","4815950"," So let's look at this trade really quick."
"4817350","4820110"," So yesterday at the close, you guys were here yesterday."
"4820250","4820570"," I said what?"
"4820710","4822230"," I said buy puts here. "
"4824050","4825230"," Buy calls here, right?"
"4826410","4827870"," Zero dates on a Friday, right?"
"4828690","4833290"," We ended up breaking up on the open, right?"
"4834630","4836930"," So for me, on a zero date, it's directional."
"4838750","4840530"," We're moving up right now."
"4840750","4841950"," Take the money and run, right?"
"4842630","4844730"," Now, we did get higher, but what happened?"
"4845710","4846510"," Big red candle. "
"4847230","4848370"," Big red candle."
"4849770","4853030"," It starts to wear on your profit from over here, right?"
"4853530","4857790"," These are directional trades, not time trades, directional, in my view."
"4859130","4863150"," Now, we did get up here and get a new high, but you probably could have closed right here and"
"4863150","4865630"," made some pretty decent money, right?"
"4865830","4866990"," So you closed your call side. "
"4868150","4869130"," You're on this night."
"4869310","4873330"," I said to you in the first prize broadcast, I don't know about you, but I would leave the other"
"4873330","4874150"," side on, right?"
"4875050","4876110"," So they're getting drained."
"4876390","4877750"," Your puts look like dog shit. "
"4877930","4879550"," Then we came back down here, right?"
"4879550","4883530"," And why did I say take your money and run the put side?"
"4883830","4888190"," Now, I don't know what you're left with right now, what you were left with in your bank or"
"4888190","4888410"," whatever."
"4890070","4892170"," But because there's zero dates, they're directional."
"4893250","4895270"," They're going to get eaten up all day long, both sides. "
"4896090","4897310"," How did I know we'd bounce here?"
"4897970","4903430"," Because we have a five minute chart with the one, today it's a one, what is it right now?"
"4903590","4904350"," One 29 EMA."
"4905970","4908030"," There's going to be guaranteed demand here."
"4908030","4909930"," And also. "
"4914110","4918010"," You need confirmation for the move down."
"4918230","4920910"," So reverse what I just said about AMC."
"4921970","4923390"," I just told you. "
"4923990","4928350"," If AMC squeezes up, pretend this chart's upside down right now."
"4929230","4931510"," AMC squeezes up, right?"
"4932350","4934230"," Then it rolls this way."
"4936030","4937190"," Pretend this charts upside down. "
"4937370","4938530"," You need AMC to do what?"
"4939070","4943130"," Do two of that to actually get the real move, right?"
"4944390","4947370"," And if you're a bear, you need a reversal."
"4947370","4948970"," You need a confirmation, right?"
"4949190","4950970"," You need a confirmation that we're going down."
"4951810","4952850"," Not just one. "
"4953170","4953970"," One's not good enough."
"4954350","4954770"," Does that make sense?"
"4955030","4959050"," So if you, if you made this upside down right now, if you put this chart upside down, it'd be"
"4959050","4959870"," the reverse of AMC."
"4961770","4965070"," So I'm going to explain this much easier to you. "
"4967170","4969670"," A lot of, a lot of traders get caught."
"4970330","4973270"," A lot of traders get caught."
"4973710","4975030"," You can use it on any time frame. "
"4975150","4979830"," You can use it on an hourly time frame, a 15 minute time frame, one minute time frame, daily time"
"4979830","4980070"," frame."
"4981050","4983090"," A lot of traders get caught in here."
"4983510","4985410"," This is like the, this is like the neutral. "
"4985850","4987990"," I've got no business being in anything zone."
"4988630","4990230"," You never fuck around in here."
"4991690","4994990"," So I'm serious here because you can, you'll, you'll see, right?"
"4994990","4998650"," If we break above here, we'll fail right here. "
"4999430","5002170"," And we will confirm that the move is higher here."
"5002710","5006670"," This second part of the trade right here, you'll see the squeeze happen and we'll go to, we'll go"
"5006670","5007270"," moon it again."
"5008570","5008810"," Right?"
"5009290","5010110"," Now, now watch. "
"5010310","5011510"," We get the initial move down, right?"
"5013270","5015210"," You want the confirmation to the downside."
"5016210","5022070"," So if we get a, if we get a green bar right here, if this green, if this bar fails"
"5022070","5025830"," right here, with the next bar will be red."
"5026650","5033030"," If this green bar does not go up, your next bar is going to be red here, red here, and"
"5033030","5034230"," then green right here. "
"5035910","5038820"," One more, one more capitulation and then you're going to get a nasty."
"5040030","5043750"," And I mean fucking nasty like boom, boom, boom, boom."
"5044570","5045070"," That makes sense. "
"5045270","5048790"," And what you're seeing here is failure of buyers, right?"
"5049670","5050830"," Spires are not strong."
"5050830","5052510"," They have no will."
"5052870","5056030"," And as soon as that capitulation happens, this is the other thing. "
"5056110","5059370"," If you were long causing a cotton here, you wouldn't sell here."
"5059530","5064210"," Would you, you'd wait for the pullback up, then get out of your calls and fuck yourself."
"5065070","5070990"," Even if we're going up and you would then reset your calls right here on confirmation, make sense. "
"5072290","5073730"," Does that make any sense to you guys?"
"5074470","5075730"," I'm hoping that it does."
"5079430","5082390"," So yeah, that's like a all trading plan stuff."
"5084370","5086310"," So if you're a bull, where do you get long here?"
"5086550","5088470"," You do not ever get long right here. "
"5088730","5089130"," Ever."
"5090310","5095210"," You've like a 30% win rate, I think you have a 30% win rate here as a bull."
"5096190","5100970"," You have a 35% win rate here as a bull. "
"5102010","5105630"," Where do you have where do you have your best win rate right here?"
"5108010","5112430"," Right about there is where you get like an 80% 90% win rate right here."
"5112490","5112590"," Why?"
"5119350","5123390"," Because you notice the buyers are stronger than they expected right?"
"5124590","5129190"," They confirmed here that that new buyers are stepping in right?"
"5130110","5137970"," You push up here, you get a failure because you know that the sellers are here and then the buyers"
"5137970","5139670"," step back in one more time."
"5139670","5145190"," When that happens, these are stronger buyers than these sellers and you get a monster move up. "
"5145370","5148730"," You use an upsetting these people packing and we're going higher."
"5149710","5152050"," Price discovery will go to the upside."
"5160450","5161630"," Hey, you made money, right?"
"5162010","5162430"," Good job, Nina. "
"5165290","5166410"," Win is a win."
"5166410","5173290"," It is a sexy move."
"5173470","5174450"," 21 cents is awesome. "
"5178670","5181690"," So I'll enter puts here and I'm going to talk to you guys about something else."
"5185590","5187490"," You guys know about time, right?"
"5187710","5194310"," I wasn't paying attention on stream, so I couldn't time this for you, but like this is a trade"
"5194310","5194690"," here."
"5195150","5198170"," That is a trade, but you have to be watching time for that part of it. "
"5198510","5199050"," Hold on a second."
"5199470","5200190"," Let's get messy."
"5200730","5202510"," If you're watching time, right?"
"5203350","5205430"," That is a trade, a legitimate trade. "
"5206330","5208810"," Let me see if I can put this in a one minute chart, maybe, but whatever."
"5209310","5212090"," Anyways, clear that up."
"5212890","5217150"," If you can't catch this watching time, this pull up right here. "
"5217390","5218670"," This is an actual trade."
"5219130","5219770"," That's a money trade."
"5220570","5222150"," We have to get the clothes for profit though. "
"5223350","5225350"," You don't stay short in here."
"5226290","5227810"," You wait for the break underneath."
"5227810","5230030"," Then you get short again right there. "
"5230670","5231950"," You take that short."
"5233050","5235570"," This one is like an 85% winner."
"5236630","5237890"," You don't win 85%. "
"5238690","5241730"," It's an 85% of the time winner on confirmation."
"5246540","5247420"," Does that make sense?"
"5248980","5254280"," So this part of the trade is this part of the trade is an 85% of the time winner."
"5255000","5257920"," This part of the trade is an 85% of the time winner. "
"5257920","5260100"," Like 85%."
"5260720","5262460"," This is the no-go place."
"5262900","5264740"," This is where you get fucking destroyed in here. "
"5265740","5267020"," Like I mean destroyed."
"5268060","5270400"," This is like the zone of death for an options trader."
"5271020","5273420"," Never ever fuck around in here. "
"5274280","5275660"," On any time frame."
"5276560","5277680"," Never fuck around in there."
"5279160","5282960"," This is like the place that you never ever go here. "
"5283340","5284540"," Like in here."
"5285240","5288220"," This is where you this is where this is where options go to die."
"5289380","5290420"," Right here. "
"5290640","5291700"," I don't care if they're calls."
"5292320","5293340"," I don't care if they're puts."
"5294080","5295660"," I don't care if you won this one. "
"5296240","5297540"," You're going to lose this air."
"5297680","5301220"," You're going to lose this zone like 65% of the time."
"5302680","5303840"," This is gambling. "
"5304760","5305800"," This is gambling."
"5306920","5307960"," Not gambling."
"5308980","5309500"," Sorry. "
"5310320","5311360"," Not gambling."
"5313180","5314360"," I should draw that in there."
"5314680","5315240"," Let's take it. "
"5315620","5317440"," So if you take a screenshot of this."
"5319720","5322220"," I want you guys to take a screenshot of this at home."
"5322380","5322940"," Hold on a second here. "
"5325480","5329140"," So this is a very important lesson for you."
"5329180","5329360"," Okay."
"5330480","5331660"," This is a lesson for you. "
"5335320","5336760"," I'm going to show you guys something here."
"5337660","5337920"," Okay."
"5342140","5343420"," Take a screenshot of this. "
"5345840","5346980"," Not gambling."

"5496050","5500070"," You're going to be on like Twitter, Wall Street, that's, it doesn't matter."
"5500330","5503830"," And every time there's going to be a new voice that said, I called it."
"5504970","5505510"," Right. "
"5505510","5511890"," But if they didn't, which is like 65 to 70% of those people didn't, they're going to fade into"

"5513190","5515550"," Disappear until the next time that they got it right."
"5516010","5520970"," Those people are trading $1,000, $10,000, $30,000 accounts. "
"5521710","5522250"," That's what they're trading."

"5625150","5626690"," Don't fuck around in there."
"5633550","5640530"," No, this, this movement right here presents itself on every time frame. "
"5641030","5646830"," These bars could be daily bars, hourly bars, 15 minute bars, five minute bars, one minute bars."
"5648090","5649030"," Doesn't matter."
"5651730","5653170"," Death zone in here. "

"5689390","5691470"," Yeah, and you'll actually hold this one right here."
"5699900","5702040"," Oh, yeah, dude, this is like a big. "
"5702660","5705800"," If you, if this is a new concept to you."
"5706620","5709180"," This is like the hammer in your toolbox."
"5709740","5711260"," Like this is like a screwdriver. "
"5711560","5713580"," Like it's like a flathead or a Phillips head screwdriver."
"5713580","5715600"," This is like the impact drill."
"5716200","5722240"," Like if you don't have an impact drill or a hammer, a pry bar, like basic tools. "
"5722940","5724840"," This is a basic tool right here."
"5725520","5727100"," If this is new to you, I'm serious."
"5727320","5729480"," If you're watching me right now and you don't understand this concept. "

"5743860","5745440"," Like you're not in monthlies there. "
"5745540","5746620"," You're entering monthlies."
"5747460","5747860"," Here."
"5748680","5750620"," You're entering, entering monthlies here. "
"5750820","5751920"," Never, ever, ever."
"5752540","5754760"," Cause you can put stops below this shit too."
"5754860","5756900"," Like there's like a whole thing about this where. "
"5757740","5759320"," You can buy the dip by the dip."
"5759320","5760340"," You can have stops lower."
"5760580","5762100"," You can raise your stops going this way. "
"5762160","5765920"," You can buy the dip by the, you can buy puts here and then bring your stops down."
"5766180","5767420"," Like short, same thing."
"5767420","5772580"," And then then like after the, if this is your hammer, then you're looking for. "
"5773160","5774920"," Where are the previous highs at?"
"5775100","5776380"," Where are the previous lows at?"
"5777360","5781660"," You can start putting your, you can start putting in your pivot points, right?"
"5781840","5783420"," You got a pivot point here, right?"
"5784320","5785060"," You got a pivot point."
"5788540","5790580"," Right here where the failure was."
"5792160","5792680"," Right?"
"5792900","5794420"," You can see the failure will go right here. "
"5795180","5797540"," You'll see that this now turn into support, right?"
"5797880","5799340"," You'll see the failure right here."
"5799480","5801060"," Then you'll, actually you're going to hit this one next."
"5807080","5808140"," And then you'll get one more. "
"5815670","5816750"," You get one more right there."
"5817070","5817930"," You guys get what I'm saying?"
"5818250","5819490"," Like you can, just this hammer."
"5820090","5823070"," You can put your toolbox out on any timeframe. "
"5827490","5828930"," Works on any timeframe."
"5831510","5833730"," You'll see the same setup in every timeframe."
"5839540","5842700"," I'm telling you, dude, dude, I'm going to tell, I'm going to warn you guys of something. "
"5842960","5846260"," So cruise that, cruise that, uh, cruise that 808 saying something."

"5853200","5855380"," Like this is straight up."
"5856660","5861500"," You're going to have people in my stream that'll say I called it."
"5863880","5865880"," You're going to, you're going to have people in my own stream. "
"5866080","5866700"," You're going to have people everywhere."
"5867000","5869020"," Your own friends are going to tell you they called it was going up."
"5869200","5870100"," They knew it was going down. "
"5870640","5871880"," I'm fucking telling you."
"5872480","5874540"," If you care about your money, right?"
"5874880","5876200"," Do not listen to those people."
"5876500","5878340"," Don't fucking listen to them. "
"5880020","5880760"," They lose."
"5881120","5881820"," I promise you."
"5882800","5883520"," They lose. "
"5883980","5888080"," Like you wait for your confirmation that we're going higher."
"5889160","5889960"," You wait or lower."
"5889960","5891960"," You're waiting for the break above. "
"5892800","5895920"," You're waiting for the confirmation right here in this white line."
"5896440","5898280"," Now these white lines are telling you something."
"5898660","5899960"," I already talked to you guys about that stuff. "
"5900320","5900760"," Time."
"5901080","5903000"," Talk to you about the flattening."
"5903260","5905160"," The vertical of the white line. "
"5905200","5905760"," The red line."
"5905860","5909140"," If it's going up down, um, if price is below or above."
"5909140","5911840"," Those are other indicators of being bullish or bearish. "
"5912540","5914860"," But you, like you, like this is your money."
"5914960","5915700"," It's not my money."
"5916040","5919620"," You know, it's not some other fucking guy or some other fucking gal in the internet. "
"5919620","5919960"," It's money."
"5920140","5921460"," This is your fucking money."
"5923240","5926200"," So you need to see certain things happen. "
"5926580","5928920"," You don't need every fucking trade."
"5929380","5930620"," You don't even need this trade."
"5931300","5932120"," You don't need this. "
"5932280","5933640"," You don't need to call this."
"5933960","5935920"," You don't need to grab this bottom bar."
"5936460","5938140"," You don't need to be the top caller. "
"5938420","5939580"," You don't need to be the bottom caller."
"5939860","5940960"," You just need to see price."
"5941800","5945500"," Show you the direction that it's going so that you can take the trade with confidence. "
"5946360","5947260"," You see it right there?"
"5947260","5947880"," Oof."
"5949140","5950340"," You see it's setting up."
"5950940","5957340"," If you can set the calls up here or set up buying the underlying there, give your finger on the"
"5957340","5958800"," button and you hit it. "
"5959000","5959600"," Slam, slam, slam."
"5961600","5963520"," If the, if the conditions present themselves."
"5966440","5967100"," Make sense?"
"5967840","5970220"," If it fails here, let's say we fail right now. "
"5970880","5972540"," Let's say right now we fail, right?"
"5972800","5974160"," You didn't hit the buy button yet, right?"
"5974540","5977040"," You get a big, you get this, you get a big red bar here."
"5977040","5979620"," And you're not, now you're not getting fucked, right?"
"5980640","5981500"," You know what I'm saying?"
"5981860","5984720"," Like, how many times do you guys get trapped out there in these trades?"
"5985400","5989500"," I'm going to assume like 60 fucking percent of you are getting, I'm going to assume two things."
"5990060","5992040"," 60% of you get trapped. "
"5993840","5995200"," 60% of you don't know."
"5995400","5997700"," 60% of you probably don't know how to manage a stop loss properly."
"5999060","6002260"," And then I bet another 60% of you are buying this shit up here. "
"6003280","6005060"," You're fucking buying calls like here."
"6007060","6007940"," Like, seriously."
"6014900","6018210"," And we're looking bullish here. "
"6018250","6019150"," I'm telling, I'm going to tell you something."
"6019290","6020030"," We're looking bullish here."
"6020350","6023030"," So if you had puts on and you took the fucking profit, congrats. "
"6023250","6023650"," Fucking lations."
"6027580","6028520"," You got the money."
"6028820","6028900"," Yahoo. "
"6030760","6032640"," And look what's happening right now."
"6034980","6036320"," About to squeeze, baby."
"6039260","6040380"," Here comes the squeeze. "
"6040780","6051740"," The failures should be right up here at $4.59. Yeah, no,"
"6052040","6053840"," dude, it's okay to say you get trapped."
"6054360","6056160"," Don't feel like, dude, I'm going to tell you something else."
"6056420","6060060"," Like, I was on Twitter last night talking about some losses I have had. "
"6060960","6064800"," Don't feel like you have to be the biggest, baddest always winner guy out there."
"6065040","6067060"," Just be like, Hey man, I get trapped all the fucking time."
"6067060","6067840"," I fucking hate it. "
"6067980","6068920"," That's why we're here, right?"
"6069400","6071020"," We're here doing live streams for that reason."
"6071120","6071700"," That's why I got a discord."
"6072380","6073320"," So you don't get trapped. "
"6073600","6074680"," So you lock in profit."
"6075080","6076300"," So you enter the right place."
"6076800","6084240"," Like you need to be entering, locking in profit and managing stops. "
"6085520","6086820"," 90% of the time."
"6088560","6094960"," 70 would work, but like 90% of the time, you need to be GI fucking Joe knowing when to"
"6094960","6097860"," enter, how to manage your stops, how to take lock in profit."
"6106110","6106810"," You know what?"
"6106910","6108110"," I got to say something about that guy. "
"6109090","6110330"," I've been in his shoes."
"6111390","6113250"," I have been in that fucking guy's shoes."
"6113610","6118430"," Like with size, size is a fucked up thing. "
"6118710","6122650"," Like size can really like warp."
"6124570","6130430"," I didn't word it right last night, but size can be like, so you see this right now, you're going"
"6130430","6131890"," to squeeze these sellers out."
"6132030","6132690"," See that green candle?"
"6133310","6135530"," You're going to squeeze these fucking bears out right now. "
"6135710","6136210"," Watch this shit."
"6136990","6138730"," So you're going to, so right here, right?"
"6139030","6141810"," You're going to squeeze out bears right to here."
"6142230","6143170"," Like 450 95. "
"6145290","6146570"," Watch this shit happen."
"6146690","6148230"," Sellers are pissed right now."
"6150450","6154490"," So I understand that guy because it's weird. "
"6154490","6161070"," Like if I'm trading like 100 contracts, they're like, you know, oh, three grand, five grand, no big"
"6161070","6162610"," deal, thousand bucks, no big deal."
"6162730","6164070"," Like it's weird how my brain works."
"6165370","6170730"," When you're like, like if something about getting to that point where you're like, I'm trading the"
"6170730","6173410"," 100 grand, I'm trading 200 grand, I'm trading 300 grand. "
"6174170","6176610"," That shit's like a major conviction trade, right?"
"6178370","6184090"," You have to do a lot to have a conviction there to be trade in that kind of size."
"6185510","6191670"," Especially short or fucking like long fucking puts or calls."
"6192570","6194470"," Even selling puts or calls. "
"6194990","6197170"," Like you have to have a very high conviction."
"6198510","6205130"," I don't care who you are or not who, but like 99% of the population out there, if you're"
"6205130","6207150"," trading that size, because I've traded that fucking size."
"6208450","6210450"," You have a high conviction. "
"6210450","6214650"," And so you have to like teach your brain."
"6214810","6220430"," Like brainwash yourself that you've done all the work to get there."
"6220490","6224310"," You're ready to go in this trade and you like everything is where it should be. "
"6225450","6227310"," It's worked 10 times in the past."
"6228450","6233050"," And what's crazy is you think that you're going to, you're going to stop yourself out, but you"
"6233050","6233610"," don't."
"6234310","6238230"," You'll watch your trade go from like, I was talking to Joe about this earlier yesterday. "
"6238230","6242470"," Before that guy even posted, I was like, dude, you take one of those fucking trades, man."
"6242630","6244350"," It's like one minute."
"6244410","6245050"," You're like, you take it. "
"6245130","6246390"," It's a hundred hundred grand, right?"
"6247750","6251570"," Immediately, if you're, if you go and not going through a prime broker, boom, they nail you."
"6251650","6252510"," They put you in a block."
"6252930","6254150"," You're down 15k. "
"6254410","6255390"," You can't sweat that shit."
"6256210","6256690"," You know what I mean?"
"6260490","6265870"," I've had spreads go from like a fucking $30,000 down to $3,000."
"6266390","6268150"," And then print 60 grand. "
"6268650","6274110"," Like, you know what kind of like dedication that takes and like conviction that takes and training"
"6274110","6277430"," that takes and experience that takes to be able to manage your trades."
"6277990","6282250"," And when you're in, it's weird because the ego plays the worst part in that."
"6283010","6288390"," The ego like gets in the way of you cutting your losses and moving on and saying, directionally, I"
"6288390","6288630"," was wrong. "
"6288730","6289750"," I'm going to get fucked up in this trade."
"6290530","6292770"," The worst part is that you going out in the spiral."
"6293990","6296930"," And you're, you get in this fucking place in your head. "
"6297650","6299550"," Like you just stopped talking to people."
"6299550","6302370"," You stopped getting on social media."
"6302470","6304010"," You stopped talking to your loved one. "
"6304130","6305490"," You just stopped talking to your dude."
"6305490","6308990"," Like you were like, I broke a fucking like one of my worst losses."
"6308990","6309990"," I've told this story before. "
"6310110","6310770"," One of my worst losses."
"6312950","6316670"," I grabbed my, I didn't grab her, but I was like, I went to my wife and I was like,"
"6316870","6318650"," you have to take the children and leave."
"6320210","6321990"," And so she left with my children. "
"6322890","6325350"," And I literally, and I had this beautiful oak desk."
"6325770","6330790"," I fucking took this oak desk and I broke this fucking thing down into small pieces."
"6331330","6332990"," I took my fucking chair, right?"
"6333710","6335410"," I'm not this guy. "
"6335950","6342170"," I took my fucking chair and I broke it into pieces on a floor."
"6342670","6348930"," It's not the right way to react, but I'm telling you, I was so fucking furious with myself."
"6350090","6351050"," I was enraged. "
"6352370","6358930"," I'm gambling money that people, doctors, not maybe a new doctor, but like engineers making a year."
"6360650","6363710"," And I can't go and talk to anybody about this."
"6363930","6371190"," I can't, the first time I ever talked to someone about losses, a non trader, a non investor, like"
"6371190","6374690"," Bob on Main Street, you look like you're fucking crazy. "
"6375610","6377210"," You look like you're fucking crazy."
"6377210","6382110"," You tell people that you're fucking gambling, what they make in a week or a month or a year and"
"6382110","6383610"," a day and 15 minutes."
"6384490","6386810"," Like they think you are fucking insane. "
"6388490","6392890"," If you tell them what your winnings are, that you made their salary in a week."
"6393950","6394970"," Or that you pissed away."
"6395430","6395910"," Oh yeah. "
"6396050","6400370"," Do you think I could go to my family and friends and say, yeah, just pissed away 20k on a"
"6400370","6400830"," fucking Airbnb."
"6401890","6403630"," Like I don't tell them that stuff."
"6403930","6405330"," You can't tell them that. "
"6407310","6410450"," Like, you know, the normal people don't do this stuff."
"6411250","6415070"," Like what you guys have as a professional, or what you're trying to become in a profession, you"
"6415070","6418590"," can't just like go to your fucking neighbor and be like, yeah, I fucking pissed away."
"6419210","6421910"," Your kids fucking four years of college this week. "
"6422650","6424570"," Can't wait to get back at it next week."
"6426810","6428510"," You can't tell them that."
"6429150","6431410"," You're like a fucking scab on society. "
"6431790","6432330"," Do you know that?"
"6432330","6437570"," Like you think you might think you're doing a good job out there, selling the market as like, I'm a"
"6437570","6438030"," bear."
"6438290","6440790"," I got values and morals."
"6441070","6441970"," You're a fucking scab. "
"6442250","6442870"," You're by this."
"6442910","6443630"," You're by this market."
"6443930","6445070"," You're a fucking scab. "
"6445510","6447330"," So it's a normal people out there."
"6448050","6451710"," It's a great profession, but you can't talk about it to normal people."
"6452590","6456090"," So my point here is I broke this fucking chair down to pieces. "
"6456790","6460350"," I left dents in an oak floor like dents."
"6460350","6466790"," Then I broke the fucking desk down and then I buried that fucking thing in a trash barrel, but I"
"6466790","6469810"," wanted to say it buried in the backyard, but that's how fucking angry I was."
"6470470","6473170"," Like I had lost my fucking cool in that trade. "
"6473690","6478870"," I've actually reacted differently after another trades, but the first time I ever lost that kind of"
"6478870","6481530"," size, it fucking sucked."
"6482630","6484210"," It was all my ego."
"6485330","6486570"," I couldn't close. "
"6487870","6489010"," It was my conviction."
"6489010","6493410"," And I watched that shit go to fucking zero."
"6494910","6495650"," Zero. "
"6498780","6500910"," Zero is like straight zero."
"6502610","6504330"," And it was fucked up."
"6510690","6512070"," I've learned my lesson. "
"6512530","6514770"," It took me three times to learn my lesson."
"6515530","6516750"," Three times."
"6518170","6519810"," Never again, ever. "
"6520030","6523530"," And I've never had a loss like that since the third time."
"6524030","6524850"," That was the charm."
"6527550","6530210"," And I'm in like some guys out there. "
"6530290","6531470"," You know, there's a good story about this."
"6532390","6537750"," Long time ago, I don't know, it was a long time ago, but one time the goat."
"6538730","6544290"," Mr. Yen told a story one time that I heard him tell where he was like, I was upside down"
"6544290","6545650"," a hundred and fifty K I think. "
"6546830","6548910"," I think he was, don't quote me on this."
"6550270","6553010"," But I think he was upside down a hundred and fifty K or something."
"6554150","6559470"," And he went through the entire weekend, not knowing if it was going to go back his way. "
"6559750","6564410"," Dude, like those feelings that go run through your mind the way your brain runs."
"6564870","6565350"," That shit."
"6565430","6567530"," It's like, it's a fucking nightmare. "
"6568070","6572030"," It's a pure fucking nightmare feel."
"6572830","6575350"," I think he was telling the story, he was like walking down the street."
"6575350","6576830"," And he's like, I'm totally fucked. "
"6577310","6580930"," I think he unfucked himself, but like that kind of shit, man."
"6596320","6597040"," It's devastating."
"6598700","6600080"," It's absolutely devastating. "
"6602360","6603900"," It like fucks with the psyche."
"6604600","6607160"," If you've never lost that kind of money, you will one day."
"6610060","6615580"," If you if you can last in this business, like as a trader, you will size up. "
"6616580","6622760"," And you will lose it many times until you fucking learn or it'll get you out of the market."
"6625020","6628320"," These sellers trying to come in here and push it down right now."
"6628660","6630240"," Look at this zone of death in here. "
"6631120","6632500"," Never fucking around in here."
"6632680","6634600"," Capped is not fuck around in here ever."
"6636000","6638920"," Well, not ever, but not on stream. "
"6638980","6639660"," I try not to."
"6642920","6648800"," Oh, yeah, dude, you remember that winky?"
"6650400","6651680"," You remember that shit, Winky?"
"6653040","6654240"," Remember the AMD shit?"
"6654360","6655620"," Man, it was an AMD or is it a."
"6657040","6658280"," Yeah, it was AMD, dude."
"6658400","6658840"," It was AMD. "
"6666970","6667330"," Yeah."
"6667450","6668570"," A bear town sheriff saying thanks."
"6668750","6670930"," Captain Tonya Paypal stories keeps me going. "
"6673290","6673930"," Excuse me going."
"6674170","6676970"," Not making the same mistakes, even though I blew up my account last year or 20 K."
"6677190","6678410"," That's 20 K is a lot of money, dude."
"6678410","6684370"," When I first started trading bear town sheriff, my $1,000 account was a lot of money. "
"6684650","6686790"," My $5,000 account was a lot of money."
"6686910","6689890"," My $20,000 account was a lot of money."
"6690070","6694470"," I remember the first time I hit the whatever it's called. "
"6694470","6698950"," The day trader rules for like 25 K and then went drop below it for like a day."
"6699310","6702190"," And I'm back under PDT and I'm like, God damn it."
"6702290","6703430"," How much money do I actually need?"
"6704470","6705330"," I need 50 K."
"6710250","6711870"," Last three in a K last year trade. "
"6712070","6713650"," And then I thought at least I'm not Bill Wong."
"6713930","6713950"," Yeah."
"6717090","6718770"," Yeah, biotech man is brutal. "
"6719510","6719950"," Greed."
"6727030","6728550"," So to get this straight, it's higher."
"6728790","6730710"," Probably a wing to enter where you put no gambling. "
"6731070","6731230"," Yes."
"6732630","6733550"," Yes, it is."
"6733970","6742770"," Your probability goes up. "
"6744070","6748590"," On a retail and a successful retest above this, this 20, 70 ma."
"6749190","6750310"," That's a fucking looly."
"6751130","6755510"," Now there are other people that'll say if you once you're above this white line, you go along the"
"6755510","6755830"," market. "
"6757370","6758890"," Unless it goes against you."
"6759010","6763890"," There are some traffic professional traders will tell you you would take this long right here on"
"6763890","6764330"," this candle."
"6766010","6771230"," You would like by the spy here spy SPX or something like that right by the underlying right here. "
"6772070","6772510"," Right."
"6772630","6775950"," You'd say it actually start buying with size on this candle."
"6776810","6779430"," If it rolls on you, you would then begin to short. "
"6781190","6786110"," Until it recovers to the upside, you close your shorts and then along the market, some more here."
"6786410","6788650"," You would never sell that ownership of this."
"6790810","6793670"," To make you guys understand that concept too, let me give you guys another paper. "
"6794050","6794790"," You guys know Jedi Marcus."
"6796250","6799350"," He uses a system similar to me, not quite the same system."
"6800190","6802070"," But he uses a very similar system. "
"6802090","6806210"," He's going to find us about white paper here from him."
"6810900","6812540"," He's got a great white paper on this."
"6815400","6817380"," A simplified, awesome sauce. "
"6818360","6820240"," Do you just do a BG L or something?"
"6821720","6822160"," Winky."
"6823580","6824640"," You can't find it here."
"6829370","6830730"," Let's find it in here somewhere. "
"6833170","6835370"," It's not I had that white paper in here kicking around."
"6840930","6843210"," Do we still have the BG L white paper?"
"6848100","6849920"," I got to get my white paper out, don't I?"
"6852220","6853620"," It comes to squeeze guys."
"6854700","6856280"," You might not know that, but it's squeeze coming. "
"6860660","6861020"," Thanks."
"6862120","6863320"," Thanks to the BG L brother."
"6864280","6866400"," Can I do that on YouTube too?"
"6875450","6876270"," Let me see if that works. "
"6878250","6878870"," That's the one."
"6879430","6880010"," There you go."
"6880270","6881070"," Click on this right here. "

"6891270","6895750"," It's a very simple simplified way of our system. "
"6899850","6901090"," See the green bar right here?"
"6901870","6902650"," See right here?"
"6902850","6904050"," You're going to get a failure right up in here?"
"6906670","6910510"," We'll drop back down and it's going to confirm if we're going higher."
"6911990","6912290"," Bam."
"6913210","6913310"," Up. "
"6914050","6914150"," Up."
"6914450","6914750"," In a way."
"6918070","6918870"," There's Boo. "
"6928860","6930500"," Ask about EMAs."
"6930680","6931940"," Click on that white paper."
"6940460","6941700"," No, it's not calls. "
"6942000","6944760"," If you read BG L, you'd be owning the spy or SPX."
"6944960","6946340"," You'd actually buy the stock."
"6947320","6950380"," He, he, he are most professionals. "
"6950740","6951560"," They don't buy calls."
"6951600","6952980"," They buy the underlying."
"6956940","6957500"," Yeah. "
"6957640","6961180"," H Y G is trying to reverse a bear, a bear flag on it."
"6961220","6962400"," You see our bear cross on it."
"6965340","6967540"," And the X recovering Dixie. "
"6969440","6972740"," I'm bleeding to Asla baby with a dip by."
"6977670","6981230"," You're 18 with a little bit of money and stocks around 500 bucks."

"6982170","6982450"," Turbo. "
"6989730","6990970"," Turbo, this is for you."
"6991150","6991230"," Okay."
"6991790","6992550"," This is what I recommend. "
"6993230","6996490"," I recommend that you get inside the discord."
"6998970","7002690"," And then I recommend that you seek out."
"7003670","7008910"," Our trading floor channel and our educational channels. "
"7009650","7014030"," I want you to be a wallflower."
"7016050","7019450"," And look for the people that are trading."
"7020250","7022130"," And the people that are teaching. "
"7023010","7027310"," And I want you to watch and learn and do not trade anything."
"7029890","7035030"," Then when you find someone that's in there teaching people, raise your hand and tell him your"
"7035030","7035570"," situation."
"7036310","7038670"," I want you to consume the educational content. "
"7039990","7044590"," Then what you're going to do is you're going to paper trade."
"7045930","7046610"," With those people."
"7047150","7047610"," Right. "
"7047870","7048650"," So it's meant to dollar."
"7050090","7054610"," When you start to be when you start winning seven to nine trades paper trading."
"7054610","7059150"," Then I want you to go back and find your financial advisor and ask them. "
"7059690","7063370"," If they think you should be doing that with real cash."
"7065810","7067390"," So click on the discord link."
"7071530","7072410"," How you're welcome. "
"7073090","7073770"," Thank you."
"7073810","7074350"," You're welcome, Michael."
"7075630","7077910"," Yeah, day trading is super isolating, isn't it?"
"7078730","7080210"," I felt the same way, man. "
"7082790","7084470"," I used to feel the same way."
"7084470","7087210"," I always wanted like somebody on the background while I was day trading."
"7088390","7089150"," All day long. "
"7089270","7091930"," I want someone there like from nine thirty two four p.m. every day."
"7093250","7095010"," Or every day that I was trading."
"7096410","7096830"," Right. "
"7098230","7099610"," So I wasn't always trading."
"7100690","7103510"," But if they weren't there the day I was trading, I'd be pissed."
"7109990","7116400"," Yeah, it's hard as a retailer. "
"7116660","7116980"," Right."
"7117420","7121280"," It's hard as a retailer to buy the underlying."
"7121540","7121640"," Right. "
"7121920","7122740"," Hey, we want you to."
"7123180","7124080"," We want you to buy."
"7124280","7125600"," Now you got to buy a million dollars. "
"7125680","7126960"," Now you got to buy two million dollars."
"7127060","7132000"," Oh, and by the way, you can start shorting the market here with another million dollar account here"
"7132000","7134500"," and don't get upside down because you're going to get a phone call."
"7134560","7136380"," You better be able to come up with another five million dollars. "
"7141090","7142590"," Oh, Willie Lowe."
"7143870","7146670"," Loman gets down and says it took me a few months to finally shook it."
"7146730","7149050"," I realized I was in a bear echo chamber in Drake's Goulade on everything. "
"7149850","7150250"," Claps."
"7150430","7150490"," Yeah."
"7150870","7154330"," Hey, man, Willie, when we finally do roll over, I'll let you know, brother. "
"7154850","7155990"," I'll just be like, Hey, man."
"7156110","7157690"," I'll show you all the things we're rolling down here."
"7158530","7159950"," Start, start selling everything. "
"7160230","7160810"," Let's sell the world."
"7163030","7167540"," Yeah, yeah."
"7172010","7172990"," Another discord link. "
"7173010","7173230"," Sure."
"7173990","7175390"," I'll give you another discord link."
"7175490","7175690"," Hold on. "
"7178970","7183170"," Treat the discord like you would if you went to your friend's house for the first time."
"7184810","7185290"," Right."
"7185470","7186270"," You shove friends house. "
"7186650","7188210"," You take your shoes off the door."
"7188430","7189930"," You follow whatever they're doing."
"7190150","7192870"," You don't just open the refrigerator and take out a bear. "
"7193570","7200170"," You don't start fucking somebody's wife or husband or whatever it is you do."
"7201450","7206010"," You don't piss in the corner of the living room and, you know, do that kind of shit."
"7206170","7206630"," Just show up. "
"7206850","7207190"," Be quiet."
"7207430","7208530"," Figure out what the etiquette is."
"7209630","7213250"," Find some people that you think know what they're talking about in there. "

"7292550","7292950"," America. "
"7293770","7296590"," And all the South Americans were party and these guys had a party, right?"
"7297570","7299170"," And say went to one of their parties."
"7302970","7306670"," And I go to leave and I owned a turtle land cruiser."
"7307650","7308130"," Yes. "
"7308890","7311390"," No, he was trying to land cruises land at that point."
"7312310","7317430"," So I got to leave and I go out to the parking lot and I jumped into my title and"
"7317430","7318650"," cruiser and drove it home."
"7320270","7322550"," And so I drive this thing home, right?"
"7323470","7329930"," I wake up in the morning and I go outside to get coffee and I go, that's not my land"
"7329930","7330170"," cruiser. "
"7334130","7338950"," So I get in the car or in the land cruiser and I turn the key over and this thing"
"7338950","7339750"," started right up."
"7340350","7342730"," And I'm looking around and I'm like, this isn't my stuff."

"7353320","7353580"," Wilson. "
"7361580","7365300"," Wilson says if you guys come to my place, you're welcome to use the pistol or whatever you like."

"7373240","7374400"," Bring your own poop knife. "
"7381080","7387200"," So I go back to the condo complex and I'm like this, I'm like, dude, someone's going to say that"
"7387200","7388100"," I stole their vehicle."
"7388780","7390760"," This thing's probably reported stolen."

"7424640","7425180"," different models. "
"7425180","7427240"," They're like the same key for every truck."
"7435370","7435930"," Absolutely."
"7436570","7438070"," Well, there's a retest right there. "
"7438150","7438550"," You see it."
"7439150","7440890"," Do you see a retest right now?"
"7442630","7444630"," Watch you got Zona death."
"7447070","7453110"," You got a retest coming up here looking for another retest there. "
"7453970","7455770"," And we're off and running, baby."
"7460720","7462040"," You guys watching it?"
"7463900","7467000"," See the sellers step in right here from the sell point."
"7467300","7470480"," Right down here trying to sell you down. "
"7470660","7471140"," Trappy in."
"7473640","7474240"," Right."

"7476600","7477200"," Right here."
"7479580","7480600"," Who's off sides here?"
"7481940","7482540"," Sellers."
"7484760","7488320"," Now, like I said, it's 85% of the time, right?"
"7489060","7494100"," You'll get one out of nine times, one out of 10 times where you'll go up and boom, you get"
"7494100","7495220"," thrown right back down. "
"7496380","7503700"," But like we're talking if you're not a winning trader, eight times, nine times out of 10."
"7506520","7511600"," You know, like the one time you get rolled over, not so bad."
"7515200","7516780"," Boo, bears, boo. "
"7518480","7520080"," No, there's no entry here to get long."
"7521080","7522820"," There is no entry here to get long yet."
"7527210","7528070"," What did I say?"
"7528230","7531270"," I said, what did I say about AMC this morning?"
"7532190","7533250"," You get your break above?"
"7534670","7535850"," Do you buy here?"
"7536330","7537130"," Fuck no. "
"7538270","7540790"," You need a confirmation that we're going higher."
"7541030","7541330"," You get me?"
"7543110","7543810"," Fuck no."
"7546370","7547490"," Yeah, that's the don't. "
"7547710","7549550"," All right, so don't diddle in the middle."
"7549790","7551530"," That's exactly this right here."
"7552450","7554590"," This isn't this is diblin in the middle right here. "
"7556710","7561350"," That is diblin in the middle, like death zone right here, diblin in the middle."
"7562010","7562830"," No go."
"7571330","7572130"," You're absolutely right. "
"7572290","7572750"," Master's Truman."
"7574010","7574710"," Miss Truman."
"7578010","7579630"," It's another reason why we don't. "
"7579790","7582590"," Another reason why we trade the five is because it's slower."
"7585090","7586070"," Makes it easier."
"7587490","7588710"," Slow it down for the stream. "
"7591250","7594570"," Oh, speak a shot of whiskey."
"7595870","7600890"," I used to love when I don't, I can't confirm this, but I used to think that I would hear."
"7601590","7606450"," I'd trade with Mr. Yen back in the day, but he'd be or not with him in the stream or"
"7606450","7608670"," anything, but he would be trading and I'd be trading in my end. "
"7609930","7615350"," And I could swear like he'd go like get on stream and then like two, three hours later."
"7616530","7621490"," You hear like the rocks jinglin like you hear like the ice jinglin in the glass."
"7622230","7624750"," And they'd be like, I think he's drinking right now while he's trading. "
"7625350","7627110"," You can never confirm it."
"7628070","7629350"," So this is all allegedly."
"7630890","7632290"," Do you guys remember those days or no?"
"7636330","7637890"," Oh shit, you got lost in Mesa?"
"7638350","7638590"," Damn. "
"7642220","7643540"," Oh, you got lost mob."
"7643740","7645020"," You were Truman when you got lost in Mesa."
"7645400","7647560"," I love Mesa National Monument, by the way. "
"7652100","7653360"," Do you guys remember those streams?"
"7655460","7656600"," I love mushrooms, dude."
"7657400","7657900"," I love them."
"7658180","7659060"," I love mushrooms. "
"7660640","7661360"," Haven't taken them in a while."
"7661500","7662240"," They're now legal here."
"7662240","7664080"," Based live in New Mexico. "
"7664320","7665660"," They were legal in New Mexico."
"7667300","7669260"," But they're legal now in Michigan, which is kind of cool."
"7669600","7671940"," There's people selling them here at dispensaries. "
"7672820","7673580"," They deliver them."
"7674360","7675740"," I haven't taken any of them though."
"7676100","7676880"," When I was younger, I took them. "
"7680490","7681970"," Yeah, you're in another mountain."
"7684070","7685690"," It's drinking a bad idea while trading."
"7686290","7686910"," I don't know. "
"7688050","7692750"," I tend to not, my best trading I do when I'm not hung over, not tired, not drinking."
"7695990","7697310"," Personally, but I don't know."
"7697470","7699290"," Like it's like pool, right?"
"7699930","7702350"," I suck at playing pool, but I have one or two bears. "
"7702550","7703430"," I'm great pool player."
"7704350","7706630"," Beer number six, I suck again."
"7717230","7721910"," So, okay, so I used to weigh, I'm six foot one. "
"7723550","7730150"," I used to weigh 165, then I went to 185, then I started building houses."
"7731850","7736590"," And I went up to 260 at one point, but it was all muscle."
"7737970","7740930"," Then I stopped building houses during COVID. "
"7741690","7749670"," I went down to 230 and turned to a lot of like coffee muscle that wasn't strong and a lot"
"7749670","7750830"," of fat with it."
"7751110","7753050"," So I was like 230 kind of fatish."
"7754710","7758990"," And what I've been doing is I'm very active. "
"7758990","7760930"," Like I spend all my week."
"7761190","7768850"," So I'm the kind of guy like instead of sitting by the pool, I sail, I kayak, I river raft,"
"7769210","7770350"," I ride mountain bikes."
"7770350","7775390"," And then during stream, I haven't been doing it past week because I'm injured. "
"7776050","7780570"," I hurt myself twice now."
"7780670","7783730"," I've hurt myself this summer being active outside."
"7785970","7788870"," But normally if I'm streaming, what I'll do is I'll take a break. "
"7789630","7793110"," And I have an exercise bike and I've got weights here and I lift weights."
"7793430","7794150"," I'll do them on the chair."
"7794310","7795650"," Sometimes you'll see me actually in stream. "
"7796290","7798750"," So it's weights all day long, at least two or three times."
"7799510","7802210"," And then I'll hit an exercise bike for like 10 minutes."
"7802830","7804910"," If I take a break here, I'll try to like hit the bike at least. "
"7806510","7807910"," Try to get up off the chair and move around."
"7808270","7814210"," The key point here though is when you're done streaming, you got to like get outside and do shit."
"7814450","7815850"," Like you got to get outside and do shit. "
"7815990","7820530"," Oh, another thing that I do is I only, I try to only eat one meal a day."
"7821010","7822390"," I've never been a desk sitter."
"7822510","7826350"," So as the first time in my life where I've had something we've been doing where I sit at a"
"7826350","7828570"," desk, it's been a challenge for me as well. "
"7829610","7833970"," I drink coffee, water, and drink coffee, water, whiskey."
"7836910","7838230"," Coffee, water, whiskey."
"7838230","7841910"," And that's mostly it. "
"7842230","7844090"," Sometimes I drink a truly or a bear."
"7844650","7846410"," I stopped drinking bear recently too."
"7846770","7851650"," I drink truly a zero calorie, calorie bullshit every once in a while. "
"7853230","7856310"," Lots of water and one meal a day."
"7858710","7860470"," I'm getting better healthier."
"7862630","7864010"," I take, I take vitamins. "
"7868630","7870110"," Vitamin D, all that kind of stuff."
"7877670","7879430"," Yeah, you set the alarm for the tweets."
"7880230","7883310"," When I go on like midnight two, three a.m. Rancin shit. "
"7898860","7901020"," Brian was just thinking so after Megadose of medicine."
"7902740","7904600"," Yeah, you're going to say allegedly there."
"7905320","7907500"," I can't say Brian was ever doing that. "
"7907500","7910660"," But you always wonder because he wasn't, he wouldn't show his face."
"7911320","7914720"," And he just how you just hear the, you just hear the rocks glass clinking in the background."
"7915000","7916920"," You're like, Oh man, is he pouring one out?"
"7917420","7918820"," I want one there right now with him. "
"7923710","7924690"," Now what about New Mexico?"
"7924990","7926030"," Yeah, New Mexico is awesome, man."
"7929460","7930700"," Do you see this right here?"
"7931700","7932640"," Zone of death in here."
"7934240","7935400"," Zone of death. "
"7937440","7938820"," What, what don't you trade?"
"7939100","7940140"," What did I say to you gambling?"
"7942000","7944480"," Not gambling, not gambling, gambling."
"7949900","7952000"," No, no, no, this step is not falling apart."
"7952340","7952740"," No, no, no. "
"7952820","7953000"," Okay."
"7953420","7954540"," So it's a good question."
"7955140","7955920"," So let's look at this. "
"7955920","7956380"," Okay, ready?"
"7957820","7959740"," Let me explain this one more time for you."
"7959760","7959900"," Ready?"
"7960740","7961740"," There's no setup here."
"7963640","7964240"," Hold on. "
"7964640","7965180"," Time out."
"7965280","7966900"," You guys aren't, you guys are starting getting this."
"7967760","7967920"," Ready?"
"7969760","7970540"," Say this again to you. "
"7973280","7974760"," Zone of death."
"7976440","7976950"," Okay."
"7981610","7982270"," Clear as day. "
"7984330","7991370"," No trade zone."
"7991810","7992610"," No trade."
"7994090","7995110"," Right. "
"7997480","8000260"," Break below and confirm."
"8001360","8002380"," Set up the puts."
"8002780","8003340"," Enter the puts. "
"8005300","8006720"," Break above."
"8008120","8009870"," Must have two."
"8011930","8012450"," Confirmations. "
"8012750","8013170"," Minimum."
"8014570","8016910"," Set up the trade as it goes up."
"8017210","8017890"," Enter the calls. "
"8018630","8019390"," Does that make sense?"
"8020330","8021250"," Zone of death."
"8023090","8024930"," No fuck around zone in here."
"8025230","8026130"," No trade in here. "
"8026370","8026790"," No trade."
"8027150","8027570"," No up trade."
"8027870","8028530"," No down trade. "
"8030370","8032390"," You guys get, you guys understand what I'm saying?"
"8033710","8034450"," What, so."
"8034450","8039870"," So I was just told, hey, cap trade has failed, right?"
"8040310","8041810"," There is no trade in here."
"8042530","8044210"," There's no fucking trade in here. "
"8044370","8046250"," There's, there's no dip buying in here."
"8046750","8049210"," There's no buying this dip right here."
"8049750","8051690"," You have to have confirmation. "
"8052830","8055550"," On the white line to the upside."
"8056650","8057090"," Make sense?"
"8058150","8058750"," Yeah."
"8058750","8058970"," Yeah. "
"8063170","8065010"," Set is not falling apart yet."
"8066770","8068110"," There is no setup."
"8068370","8069770"," There's no setup right now. "
"8069870","8071770"," Your setup is here."
"8072010","8072070"," Watch."
"8072690","8074290"," I'll be clearing this. "
"8075070","8075970"," Your setup."
"8079830","8081510"," Is either of these."
"8081930","8084150"," That is when you start to set up. "
"8086430","8088150"," Like if we're here."
"8089170","8092530"," Then I'm going to set some puts up and take them there."
"8092530","8093330"," Does that make sense?"
"8094070","8095530"," I'm going to set some calls up. "
"8095910","8096870"," Take them there."
"8097450","8098430"," So there's no setup."
"8098630","8099630"," There's no dip buying. "
"8099630","8100870"," There's no selling this."
"8101370","8103210"," You don't like nothing in here."
"8105110","8107170"," This is the trap right here. "
"8108490","8110910"," This is all the trap right here."
"8111670","8113230"," A big fuck you in here."
"8114030","8116630"," If you're a bull or a bear, it doesn't matter. "
"8117090","8117890"," Fuck you."
"8118450","8119510"," Fuck you seller."
"8119830","8120350"," Fuck you buyer. "
"8120670","8121290"," It doesn't matter."
"8122730","8126890"," The setup is always below here."
"8127910","8130310"," The setup is always above on a retest. "
"8132330","8134250"," So nothing's set up yet."
"8135390","8136730"," The second bounce."
"8137810","8138290"," Always. "
"8140030","8141970"," Well, there's some other things here."
"8143450","8147430"," Like that there and like this here and like that there too."
"8149270","8151670"," But just basic trading rules. "
"8154050","8155950"," Just basic trading rules."
"8156170","8156890"," There's no trade here."
"8159490","8161570"," If you bought this, you're what?"
"8162110","8162930"," Flat right now, right?"
"8163750","8166390"," If you bought this bounce, you're underneath right now, right?"
"8167610","8168910"," No trading in here. "

"8720920","8726550"," I'm looking at NASDAQ looks like dog shit here."
"8726710","8727810"," I'm going to close out here. "
"8732520","8734160"," I'm losing a penny right now."
"8735580","8739800"," Well, that's the penny on 25 contracts on 451 C."
"8740460","8742380"," I need to see this push up a little bit."

"8750880","8753160"," Some flat again cut myself out."
"8753180","8753740"," I lost a penny."
"8756320","8760000"," I don't like like H Y G is just going down right now. "
"8761460","8763600"," Dixie is going down to that offsets it."
"8764140","8767540"," NASDAQ coming back to retest the fucking five minute again."
"8768720","8770040"," Look on the five minute here. "
"8789780","8791460"," Maybe I will re-enter again."

"8801560","8803720"," I'm trying to try to get long here."
"8819600","8823740"," So what I'm watching right now is I'm watching NASDAQ right now."
"8824340","8833890"," There is a motherfucker man. "
"8834830","8836670"," Like Apple looks like dog shit."
"8836890","8838430"," NASDAQ looks like dog shit."
"8841610","8843010"," I got no trade still. "
"8849330","8851350"," I had 25 C's."
"8852030","8852730"," I'm sorry."
"8852930","8857390"," 41 C's for 36 cents sold about 35 cents. "
"8857950","8861110"," The strike is at 30 cents right now."
"8865510","8866630"," And I got no trade."
"8876510","8877950"," I'm flat right now if you're wondering. "
"8880850","8883910"," Yeah, I'm watching like H Y G looks like dog shit."
"8885110","8887410"," Dixie is going down right now, but."
"8888330","8891670"," I don't like NASDAQ looks sloppy as fuck. "
"8892970","8894730"," Apple looks sloppy as fuck."
"8895910","8899630"," Apple's like reversing from a bull flag to or a bull."
"8899850","8902210"," A bull plane to a bear plane right now. "
"8905530","8909650"," Well, the one good thing too is that the hourly is racing up right now."
"8909870","8911770"," So it's coming up the right now."
"8911790","8913010"," It's coming up right here right now. "
"8913010","8916770"," So it's like dog shit."
"8921940","8922920"," Tesla's great right now."
"8923060","8925320"," Just peaked out at two eighty three oh four. "
"8926760","8927980"," Should get a roll in Tesla."
"8933480","8935260"," Just making my eyes bleed out slow."
"8935440","8935740"," This is. "
"8986220","8988180"," Do you want to buy this so fucking bad?"
"8988360","8989500"," They're 30 cents right now."
"8999030","9001170"," H Y G looks like shit."
"9003010","9011390"," What the fuck is T L T doing right now?"
"9014590","9015890"," Like it's like bond. "
"9015950","9016130"," Nope."
"9016270","9017850"," Bond games not doing shit either."
"9017850","9019830"," Bonds aren't doing shit either. "
"9078630","9082110"," NASDAQ with the fucking stick save right now in the five minute chart."
"9083030","9085850"," But dude, this stick save on fucking N D X like."
"9086450","9090330"," H Y G looks like otter dog shit. "
"9103250","9105470"," I ain't buying none of this shit."
"9108990","9110590"," H Y G is."
"9113170","9113730"," Risk. "
"9114470","9116050"," Very risky behavior."
"9121890","9122970"," H Y G."
"9123350","9124030"," Think of it."
"9124210","9126830"," So the simple way for you to understand what H Y G is. "
"9127430","9127830"," Is."
"9128950","9130430"," What's the way the simple way."
"9131110","9134070"," If you understand the simple how to simplify H Y G."
"9134650","9136150"," H Y G is like. "
"9139870","9143490"," Is like saying, yeah, we're going to wrap some really shitty loans together."
"9144310","9147830"," And we, we think these, we think these people are never going to pay them back."
"9147830","9149750"," But they pay really high yields. "
"9151990","9154570"," If like a triple A loan."
"9155710","9157890"," Would pay you like one to three percent."
"9157890","9162350"," But then you went to a crack head and say, I'll give you a credit card. "
"9162350","9165430"," But the interest rates are 30 percent."
"9166670","9170570"," And you actually believe that they can pay them because everybody's working."
"9170810","9171550"," Everybody's making money. "
"9173090","9175490"," So if H Y G is going down."
"9178590","9182530"," It's like, it's like a risk off behavior from, from those bonds."
"9184690","9186430"," Yeah, I should just say junk bonds. "
"9186630","9188470"," Well, I don't know if everybody knows what junk bonds are."
"9188470","9190330"," It's like a risk off behavior."
"9190550","9193870"," So if you see H Y G going down, it means that no one's putting risk on. "
"9196010","9197630"," It's if H Y G is going up."
"9198350","9203530"," And the price of tech and, you know, speculative assets."
"9204530","9205890"," Are not following. "
"9206190","9207050"," They're going to squeeze."
"9210030","9214310"," So if H Y G is going down, that means that there's risk."
"9214310","9216930"," It's not there's no risky behavior in the stock market. "
"9219450","9223190"," Oh, fuck yeah, Tesla trading two eighty three thirty nine."
"9224390","9226030"," Keep on pushing Tesla."
"9226830","9228470"," Keep on pushing, baby. "
"9231330","9233550"," Trying to simplify this."
"9237190","9238650"," They're like dog shit."
"9241130","9243390"," Dog shit wrapped in and catch it. "
"9245790","9249390"," Tesla now trading two eighty three twenty five."
"9249950","9251870"," I think we get three hundred bucks today or no."
"9252670","9255650"," I'm trying to simplify it for you. "
"9255810","9256910"," So you don't have to over complicate it."
"9257690","9260910"," If H Y G up stock market up."
"9261590","9265710"," Not stock market, risky stock market up H Y G down. "
"9266480","9270150"," Typically risk risky assets go down to."
"9276150","9277450"," Here I'll show it to you right now."
"9277790","9278570"," Hold on a second here. "
"9280430","9281570"," We can do that."
"9281710","9282710"," I think we can do it right here."
"9284010","9286130"," Sometimes you'll see divergences too. "
"9287150","9289430"," Now the thing about this is."
"9291670","9294250"," Nothing is ever guaranteed."
"9296650","9302270"," But you want to take the full picture like H Y G T L T."
"9302750","9304650"," There's a few others you can use too. "
"9305490","9310210"," But you want to mix that with a blend of Dixie the VIX."
"9312010","9314670"," I try to use I W M."
"9316450","9316870"," NASDAQ."
"9317470","9321290"," Sometimes I'll try to dig deeper into each index. "
"9321310","9323370"," So I just popped over to Apple to see what it's doing."
"9324730","9326750"," So here's a here's an example here."
"9327190","9330690"," You can do this on any charting software, but. "
"9332950","9336410"," There is some kind of a correlation, but here's a."
"9336730","9338630"," S P X and will compare."
"9340870","9343690"," H Y G and you're looking for divergences."
"9344290","9347010"," That do that or no. "
"9348610","9349610"," Going on here."
"9349610","9354300"," A second here."
"9355480","9362410"," Here we go. "
"9364050","9364970"," See it right there."
"9368210","9369970"," And what can I tell you?"
"9370310","9372290"," So you want to know what's fascinating about this is really cool."
"9373110","9374530"," You guys have some great questions. "
"9374910","9375130"," So."
"9376030","9380470"," H Y G will be a leading indicator."
"9381710","9382990"," This is a shitty way. "
"9383670","9385210"," This kind of shows it."
"9385510","9386170"," Hold on here."
"9388710","9390410"," So H Y G."
"9391650","9394370"," Will sometimes be a leading indicator. "
"9395110","9397770"," So just before a down move."
"9398070","9400170"," See this right is a great way to look at it is a great one."
"9401210","9402390"," So see right here. "
"9404570","9408730"," See how H Y G is already going down yet."
"9409370","9412450"," Spy has not S P X has not."
"9413070","9416070"," What is what is H Y G telling you?"
"9416990","9419390"," It's a leading indicator, right?"
"9421410","9427710"," So if there's divergence where spy is going down and H Y G is going up. "
"9428530","9429890"," What is it telling you?"
"9430230","9432170"," Spy is going to rip, right?"
"9432970","9434430"," See right here, my cursors."
"9434630","9436850"," See how H Y G is rolling over."
"9437790","9439610"," Yet spy is trading sideways. "
"9439610","9441690"," Then you get a major drop in spy."
"9442690","9446130"," So it can sometimes be a crystal ball."
"9448250","9449090"," Intraday. "
"9449650","9450770"," A Dane advance."
"9452350","9454650"," Before major move takes place."
"9455090","9457470"," So not always, but you're looking for. "
"9459810","9460650"," Divergence."
"9463170","9465930"," Are you seeing divergence right now?"
"9466750","9468770"," Shake your head up and down and say yes, Captain."
"9471950","9476310"," Do you see how we're up here right now yet?"
"9476610","9478550"," H Y G is leading the way lower. "
"9478910","9481630"," Even though the price of spy hasn't gotten there yet."
"9481950","9482550"," You should get what I'm saying."
"9484890","9486430"," So where eyeball. "
"9486570","9488670"," So I'm eyeballing in the background H Y G."
"9488750","9490490"," Let's look at H Y G and S P X together."
"9490490","9491070"," Maybe hold on."
"9492530","9494030"," Give me one second here. "
"9495490","9496910"," Stop comparing that one."
"9497230","9497410"," Two."
"9500690","9501730"," No, no, no. "
"9501850","9503190"," I don't want to touch window grid."
"9504270","9504570"," Two."
"9507270","9510450"," So let's look at S P X on a five minute chart. "
"9511890","9512430"," Right."
"9513590","9515850"," Now let's look at H Y G."
"9518750","9520970"," On a five minute chart."
"9523010","9526730"," What is, what is this telling you?"
"9527190","9533130"," And what is that telling you, right?"
"9536310","9540070"," Let's bring back up the indicators here. "
"9540790","9545550"," Let's bring up the indicators over."
"9545550","9547930"," There's a guess of some great fucking questions today."
"9549510","9550990"," So this is S P X, right?"
"9551670","9554770"," S P X is telling you everything is kind of dandy. "
"9554930","9555470"," Not bandy."
"9555510","9556710"," We're below the white line, right?"
"9556890","9557450"," So let's bearish."
"9558970","9560590"," They were getting underneath this white line. "
"9560650","9561710"," I never liked being under here."
"9562030","9562350"," Ever."
"9562710","9565110"," Never like having calls underneath this white line right here, right?"
"9566470","9570390"," See like the major move down in N D X or H Y G."
"9571210","9572530"," Do you see the bear plane?"
"9573490","9574390"," See it right there. "
"9576490","9577530"," That's not good, right?"
"9579310","9583770"," So let's say we get a squeeze up here in S P X with fail here."
"9585230","9587270"," Begin a downward move right here, right?"
"9587810","9589090"," So what would you be looking for?"
"9589430","9593310"," And for H Y G to if we're looking for this, what are you looking for this?"
"9594410","9595330"," Looking for a failure, right?"
"9597570","9601430"," And then the confirmation to the downside because of this plane right here."
"9601430","9603110"," You guys understand what I'm saying right there?"
"9604410","9606010"," So I have a screener up in the background. "
"9606290","9606830"," Did I leave up?"
"9608350","9611810"," I'll leave up like sectors like let's see what financials are doing."
"9612510","9614330"," Let's see what XLU is doing."
"9615470","9619650"," Is that is is the semiconductor ZTF leading the way?"

"9636630","9637590"," I don't like this."
"9637590","9639830"," This is an early sign of rolling over. "
"9639970","9640190"," Isn't it?"
"9640390","9645530"," Even if we squeeze higher today, you see the early signs of us rolling over right now."
"9645530","9646190"," We have divergence."
"9646670","9647370"," See the divergence?"
"9647470","9649250"," It's a big divergence to the downside. "
"9650190","9653490"," The price has not followed yet on S P X, right?"
"9660820","9665100"," Oh, so Winky wants to know why I entered into the death zone."

"9673140","9674360"," We were not in the death zone. "
"9675480","9676640"," Why did I enter those calls?"
"9677060","9677600"," I'll show you right now."
"9680720","9681620"," It's a one minute chart."
"9687610","9689530"," Let's let's explain how I manage this trade. "
"9689770","9690650"," I was in a minute ago."
"9690650","9690890"," Are you ready?"

"9699210","9699790"," No trade, right?"
"9699990","9700230"," No trade."
"9701830","9704130"," We tested the white line here, right?"
"9708150","9709270"," Came back over. "
"9711250","9712910"," Back below and over here, right?"
"9713130","9714570"," And then we made a downward move, right?"
"9716590","9718630"," So where did I cut them loose right here?"
"9718950","9719770"," I think I cut them right here."
"9721630","9722790"," Somewhere in here, I cut them."
"9724430","9728510"," One test, two tests, right?"
"9728870","9729370"," Squeezed up. "
"9729930","9731790"," Was waiting to see if we get that move higher."
"9732630","9734310"," Managed my trade with stops below."
"9735010","9735790"," Broke below here. "
"9736930","9738570"," And you can see the selling right there, right?"
"9738750","9740290"," So that wasn't actually death zone, was it?"
"9740390","9740770"," We were above."
"9741610","9742350"," So death zone."
"9743510","9744030"," Right?"
"9744330","9744690"," Right here. "

"9751090","9751750"," Came down. "
"9752990","9753630"," Broke down."
"9754330","9754650"," Right?"
"9754970","9757970"," And right here is your manager trade, so you're not in it any longer."
"9758430","9759130"," And then the failure. "
"9759510","9760750"," Do you guys understand that or no?"
"9761790","9763070"," Wasn't in the death zone, actually."
"9764530","9765830"," Took the trade with risk."
"9766490","9768310"," And the trade failed, but I had stopped. "
"9768710","9769610"," So I lost one penny."
"9770770","9773090"," So that's a, to me, that's a successful trade."
"9774890","9775870"," Does that work or no?"
"9782580","9783740"," I don't know if that works or not. "
"9785500","9786780"," You can see it right here."
"9789840","9791140"," In the five minute chart, right?"
"9791600","9792000"," Came up."
"9794420","9795280"," Oh, actually, no. "
"9795620","9796600"," Sorry, it was come up here."
"9797140","9797720"," Success will test."

"9802940","9803420"," Starts the fail. "
"9804680","9805500"," Figure my stops, right?"
"9816910","9817350"," Yeah."
"9817490","9818610"," Do you see how I manage that trade?"
"9818610","9821950"," I want to ask you, do you consider that a failed trade?"
"9823470","9825750"," So I'm going to know if you think that was a failed trade."
"9825970","9828370"," I think that was a successful trade, even if it didn't print. "
"9829710","9830650"," Did I manage my stops?"
"9830850","9831170"," Yes."
"9831830","9832750"," Did the trade fail?"
"9833130","9833250"," Yes."
"9834270","9837450"," Did I know where to take my trade off?"
"9853820","9854260"," Absolutely. "
"9854520","9855700"," It's a successful trade every time."
"9859330","9861070"," Now it's 12.22, right?"
"9861070","9862470"," Let's talk about time here."
"9864310","9866450"," We get the hourly trigger coming up from the bottom. "
"9866630","9868030"," It's from the depths of hell, like a shark."
"9869090","9872110"," We've got eight minutes left for a new low."
"9872290","9873250"," We haven't had one yet. "
"9874290","9876290"," This PT1, we already tagged it, right?"
"9877210","9885070"," So this is the previous low back at 11 a.m. It's now an hour and a half later, right?"
"9885250","9886330"," Have we gotten a new low?"
"9887010","9893430"," If the bears can't get a new low right here in the next eight minutes, the fires are going to"
"9893430","9894310"," take over."
"9896290","9898610"," So sellers need what now?"
"9899130","9899990"," Not PT1."
"9900190","9901070"," This is back here, right?"
"9901810","9904170"," Sellers need to tag this one right here. "
"9905130","9910130"," So the next eight minutes sellers must tag this."
"9911570","9917650"," If they don't, by 12.30, bulls are going to take over for a full hour."
"9917770","9919250"," So we'll see if they can get this or not. "
"9919250","9921330"," If they can't, we're going to rip to the upside."
"9923950","9926190"," Dude, HYG looks like dog shit."
"9928470","9929910"," Apple's burning right now. "
"9932730","9934050"," Vix is looking bullish."
"9939190","9940590"," I think this goes down here, man."
"9941750","9944710"," Do you see the bear flag forming right here?"
"9961880","9962720"," You see it?"
"9965480","9967160"," See the rejection right here?"
"9967800","9968360"," On that candle?"

"10111430","10113190"," Fuck no, this is not a dip to buy."
"10113350","10114490"," You're already fucking mine. "
"10115150","10122030"," Well, maybe there's a squeeze trade on Apple right now to 190.33, but you can hold it for like"
"10122030","10122950"," maybe five seconds."

"10155520","10156920"," I'm going to have to add more puts here. "
"10167190","10169270"," Yeah, there's a DCA somewhere up here."

"12647190","12651610"," Yeah, I know the market's going to sell off, but so my idea here is this."
"12651890","12658990"," If they try to sell Tesla off, let's say it's kept trying some of this bullshit here where they're"
"12658990","12660570"," like, oh, yeah, Tesla sucks. "
"12662370","12667670"," If they run this down at any point today on Tesla to 270 or anything like that, this fucking thing"
"12667670","12671030"," is going to three 14 by end of week next week."
"12671030","12672890"," So I'll just look for three 14s."
"12672890","12678190"," Then the clothes either way, like anything, if they even try this bullshit, the shit's going to the"
"12678190","12678610"," moon, man. "
"12679010","12682350"," I don't know if you know this or not, but it's going to the fucking moon."
"12686090","12692250"," So I'm long Tesla here, by the way, for the end of the day today, if you're not long Tesla"
"12692250","12698550"," today and you've got money to piss away, you're out of your mind not taking an eight cents, six"
"12698550","12701590"," cents, seven cent call to 290 22."
"12702650","12705650"," How do you fucking skull like Tesla, dude?"
"12706790","12708390"," They're going to kill their earnings. "
"12709770","12712870"," And if they I'm going to tell you something, I'm going to tell you guys something, all right?"
"12714250","12719010"," I have been a longtime Tesla trader and I have been long when they've split."
"12719470","12724970"," I've been long when they've announced shit and if they do either of those two things on this or ER,"
"12725750","12734430"," if they fucking whisper fart, fucking if they whisper fart FSD truck or fucking a split, this"
"12734430","12738510"," shit's going like to the moon."
"12740470","12745510"," I've woken up in the morning winning six figures on Tesla on their earnings with shit like this. "
"12746310","12747790"," So you're going to get one of these."
"12748210","12749370"," You're going to get one of these."

"12776310","12776550"," half."
"12776550","12783690"," And he'll know that the price will just rip straight to 500. "
"12785210","12793130"," And your calls will literally fucking print 5,000 per cent like nobody's business."
"12793550","12799330"," So whatever this dick around in here is, it's worth the risk and it's dirt cheap."
"12800290","12802630"," Eight cents right now for 290 see. "
"12803010","12806630"," So they either run this up on that anticipation in his clothes."
"12807670","12811850"," And if they don't, well, we're going to throw some ridiculous zero dates on."
"12812330","12816090"," For Monday, like so if they run this down into tomorrow, right?"
"12817470","12820070"," You could, I mean, if they announced the split. "
"12823510","12824570"," Shit, I mean."

"12888800","12891360"," Now you're like mixing words that have nothing to do with. "
"12891560","12893260"," We have zero dates today on Tesla, right?"

"12943640","12944820"," I'm long as fuck here. "
"12947060","12948760"," Oh, no, I'm going to fucking print these."
"12948900","12951600"," I'm going to print these fucking things like 500% today."
"12951740","12952180"," I already know it. "
"12954940","12956340"," How are you know I'm going to print this?"
"12956500","12957720"," I'm going to print this shit today."
"12958160","12960520"," I'm going to print you 500% right?"
"12963440","12964600"," That's what I'm going to do."
"12967320","12971080"," If I don't pimp sloppy with this today, I'm going to pimp sloppy one fucking Monday. "
"12972540","12974200"," Because I already know."
"12978550","12980850"," They're going to beat the fuck out of their earnings, dude."
"12981150","12983010"," Like he is going to come out swinging. "
"12983970","12985930"," You're going to remember if they're going to split, right?"
"12986430","12988190"," You guys might not know if they're going to split."
"12988370","12989510"," You're going to get that announcement."
"12989510","12991670"," This ER for the next one. "
"12992270","12993850"," You get it before it happens."
"12994170","12995150"," You do realize that, right?"
"12995810","12997330"," Like they usually don't split like right."
"12997470","12999250"," They just announce that, hey, we're going to split the stock. "
"13000590","13003870"," And then for like the next month and a half, it just goes fucking vertical."
"13014800","13015760"," All right, that's it."
"13017600","13018240"," That's it. "
"13061580","13070690"," That took two seconds, didn't it?"
"13072190","13076830"," There's no point in buying Tesla calls for next week."
"13078390","13080050"," Think about the logic here."
"13080750","13082910"," So let me explain the logic for you. "
"13083910","13087870"," You have the chance to buy zero dates for Tesla today."
"13089050","13091990"," For 10 cents to trade PT two right here."
"13092910","13095010"," Okay, let me explain the logic to you. "
"13096330","13102690"," So why would you buy Tesla calls for next week when you can spend 10 cents."
"13103910","13106250"," For a rip into the bell, right?"
"13106470","13107970"," And a pricing in 10 cents."
"13109770","13112750"," And if it sells down to the depths of hell. "
"13114070","13119010"," You would buy next the next expiry at a dirt cheap price."
"13119010","13119890"," Does that make sense?"
"13120490","13123570"," So if this were to sell down into this close, right?"
"13123570","13127130"," Why would you buy calls for next week right here?"
"13127430","13133290"," Like what would ever, why would you buy a $10 call right here when you can have it for six"
"13133290","13133930"," down here?"
"13134650","13141190"," You would, you would express that bullishness right here with a 10 cent call and print 500% right"
"13141190","13142230"," up into this fucking bell."
"13147730","13148470"," Hold on a second. "
"13148570","13149450"," I'm going to do something in the background."
"13151490","13153710"," Yeah, I'm long as fuck on Tesla right now."
"13155050","13155770"," I got a check. "
"13155770","13156950"," I got to check a text message."
"13156950","13157370"," Hold on here."
"13238350","13240970"," I got to say something here inside of the chat. "
"13241270","13243910"," I'm going to make a comment here inside of the stream right now."
"13244470","13245950"," So I'm going to give you a warning."

"13824440","13828000"," like the chat of YouTube is not the place for you to lodge a complaint. "
"13829440","13829900"," You know what I mean?"
"13830040","13833140"," The Twitch chat is not a place for you to lodge a complaint."
"13833880","13836020"," We're trying to make fucking money here."
"13837400","13839520"," I'm trying to make fucking money here. "
"13841600","13843540"," And you're smearing shit on the walls."

"13915700","13916720"," I don't disagree with you."
"13916920","13921640"," I am a Tesla bull that is not Tesla gang."
"13924040","13925880"," I am a Tesla bull. "
"13926220","13928520"," There's a difference between a Tesla bull and a Tesla trader."
"13929820","13933080"," Not necessarily like a brainwashed."

"14491500","14495240"," If you've never used the bidet out there, it's life changing, especially a good one."
"14496160","14501600"," If you go to the one where it's like where they have the heated water and the heated air. "
"14503940","14505240"," The heated seat."

"14579650","14582030"," It's a one minute 27 EMA."
"14583670","14585890"," We'll see if it keeps riding high here or not. "
"14585890","14587710"," If they get the move into the bell here."
"14591850","14592670"," Chase, my brother."

"14642700","14643940"," I take vitamin D."
"14645140","14648220"," I take, um, sometimes I'll take some fish oil."
"14648760","14651060"," I don't eat as much fish as I used to."
"14651660","14656460"," I feel really bad about, well, it's two reasons because of all the shit that's in the water, but"
"14656460","14657400"," then the overfishing. "
"14658400","14662080"," Um, I get a real issue with that shit that's going on right now."
"14662880","14667200"," Uh, so I've been eating a lot less fish than I used to eat, so I take fish oil."
"14667200","14677160"," I take, uh, Cialis, uh, not as frequently as I probably should, but, uh, I forget sometimes to"
"14677160","14679660"," take it, but I do take Cialis, uh, dick pills. "
"14679920","14680440"," They're fucking awesome."
"14681100","14681780"," I don't need them."
"14682220","14683160"," Uh, but I love them. "
"14683280","14684060"," They're fucking phenomenal."
"14684060","14688160"," Like you're like a 16 year old, a rock hard on and it's huge."
"14688220","14690300"," You're like walking around like a third peg leg. "
"14691180","14691480"," Uh, yeah."
"14691580","14695060"," And I just two of them like, I'm like, the kids are gone."
"14695200","14695700"," I'm going to get laid. "
"14698500","14700420"," Life's, wife's time of the month where she's horny."
"14701580","14705000"," I got three days of, uh, of 16 year old dick for."
"14710500","14717840"," Uh, and then the, uh, only other thing that I do is I get shots, uh, for, I get, um,"
"14719280","14722880"," steroid shots for damage that I've done to myself over the years. "
"14725520","14729720"," And I've done damage to myself, uh, in the army, hike and bike and that kind of stuff."
"14730080","14732340"," So I have a really bad knees."
"14732420","14733460"," I've got bad joints. "
"14734660","14737020"," I've got fucked up playing soccer in college."
"14737400","14738540"," Uh, really bad."
"14738840","14739660"," Took a really bad injury. "
"14739820","14740300"," My lower back."
"14741780","14744280"," Uh, so I'll take a shot every like three to six months."
"14744940","14746280"," Let's take a big needle in me. "
"14746400","14747000"," They're like, where is it?"
"14747080","14747520"," Where's it worse?"
"14747760","14748340"," I'm like right there."
"14751060","14752800"," Uh, nope."
"14752800","14754000"," I haven't tried royal honey. "
"14755980","14761460"," The, uh, I'm not even eligible for the Seattle subscription or the subscription, the prescription,"
"14761460","14763340"," like my doctor will give it to me."
"14763400","14769320"," So I went to like an online doctor and had to get like to an online thing."
"14770100","14772400"," And then they give you the prescription and then I buy them now. "
"14772680","14776900"," The cheapest ones I get I think are through Amazon for one of those companies."
"14777240","14778720"," Every which one my wife gets them for me."
"14779780","14780440"," And they're fucking blast. "
"14786550","14787810"," Oh, dude, the shot is amazing."
"14788870","14790230"," Uh, there's a problem here though."
"14790850","14799750"," So, uh, the one warning I would give with the shot is, um, you have to be in good health. "
"14801430","14803430"," Uh, like as strong as you can be."
"14804030","14809830"," There's a real problem with the shot is that like, uh, if you don't work out or keep your muscles"
"14809830","14812410"," strong to help support the damage you've already done."
"14813030","14815870"," Uh, the damage will get worse. "
"14817250","14819770"," Uh, so you can really hyper injury yourself."
"14820730","14823310"," Um, now most of my injuries."
"14824390","14827930"," If I have surgery, I'll never like, I'll never ski again. "
"14827930","14830650"," If I have those surgeries, I'll never surf again."
"14831350","14833850"," So I have to like balance what I can and can't do."
"14834470","14839050"," Like, Hey, man, do you want to stop skiing forever or do you, uh, do you want to like walk"
"14839050","14842030"," around and always be feeling great or do you want to be able to continue to ski. "
"14842030","14848170"," The other thing that I've been doing recently too is I get more inflammation than I've ever had"
"14848170","14848570"," before."
"14848890","14853450"," So I take, uh, ibuprofen more frequently than I ever have when I'm doing that being athletic."
"14853690","14855530"," Uh, like not athletic, like working out. "
"14855550","14856730"," Like, so I went mountain biking."
"14856830","14863550"," Uh, well, like 4th of July, the first week I was doing some mountain biking and I had to take"
"14863550","14864230"," ibuprofen."
"14864350","14865330"," My knees were swollen. "
"14865530","14866470"," My ankles were swollen."
"14868070","14870070"," I'm like pumping up and down hills and shit."
"14871650","14872050"," Mm. "
"14879580","14880980"," Oh, they're trying to kill my trip."
"14881100","14883300"," They're trying to kill my calls right now on, uh, Tesla."
"14885180","14887980"," It's like a fucking waiting game with Tesla all the time, right?"
"14888200","14889780"," You just sit there and wait and then it explodes. "
"14892860","14896200"," Nice fucking dailers like, uh, we don't want to pay for your two nineties."
"14897500","14899380"," Like you're going to pay them in one way or another."
"14903350","14903750"," Yeah. "
"14903750","14908810"," It sucks because I don't, I don't take the ibuprofen if I've been drinking."
"14909730","14911710"," Like, so it's like a mixed bag."
"14911830","14917010"," Like if I go out mountain bike, I can't have a bear afterwards and I can't take the, uh, ibuprofen"
"14917010","14918850"," until the bear wears off. "
"14921510","14923730"," Uh, yeah, I don't, I don't need a lot of carbs anymore."
"14924430","14925750"," Uh, I don't have a ton of carbs."
"14926350","14928390"," I have a very strict diet right now. "
"14941740","14942420"," Hey, Chase."
"14942680","14942940"," What's up?"
"14943060","14943240"," A man."
"14943400","14944520"," Hey, by the way, Chase. "
"14944740","14945240"," How you been brother?"
"14945660","14947880"," I didn't see all of your, all of your chat, man."
"14948260","14949760"," We were asking about you today."
"14949940","14950520"," I wondered where you got. "
"14950660","14951980"," I've forgotten that you'd taken a vacation."
"14952820","14957580"," Uh, what's, what max target you got into OPEC's, uh, right now?"
"14958560","14959160"," Upside target."
"14961020","14964420"," Um, three 55 ish. "
"14966020","14967180"," Uh, but I'd like to see us."
"14967180","14968260"," I think we're in the top."
"14968460","14969660"," I think we're in the next leg down. "
"14973960","14975180"," Yeah, that's funny, dude."
"14981430","14982930"," What is that LUTS?"
"14983690","14988670"," Uh, Chase is saying that Spock Emma seems such as Jess."
"14988750","14990710"," Uh, Max is 450. "
"14990790","14991710"," We're already tagged 450."
"14993190","14994990"," Uh, we've already, we've already topped, man."
"14995270","14996210"," So we're close, dude. "
"14997610","15001030"," Um, we're, we're topping right now."
"15001830","15003390"," Uh, Chase, I'll show you some brother."
"15003590","15003750"," Hold on. "
"15006090","15006670"," Here you go."
"15006830","15007270"," Here you go, Chase."
"15008650","15011450"," Uh, so you got two problems, Chase. "
"15011690","15011850"," You ready?"
"15014190","15017590"," So, Chase, you've got earning season that just began."
"15018590","15020110"," You're just getting back to vacation, right?"
"15020950","15022090"," You've got earning season."
"15024630","15027010"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"15027010","15028710"," Time out, T-O, T-O."
"15030730","15031710"," Time out, Chase."
"15033350","15034150"," Time out. "
"15037550","15040830"," Chase, you have Q2."
"15041670","15042870"," Well, listen, me closely, okay?"
"15043910","15044870"," You got Q2."
"15045110","15046090"," That was great earnings. "
"15047170","15048430"," You get inflation coming down."
"15048610","15051710"," That means that we're going to raise."
"15052090","15056130"," There will be a demand or a raise of forward. "
"15056130","15057350"," word PE earnings."
"15058570","15059350"," Don't worry, brother."
"15060010","15061230"," So hold on. "
"15061470","15063170"," I'll go over real quickly with it with you."
"15063230","15063450"," Okay."
"15064150","15065370"," So you're going to be easier. "
"15067030","15073470"," No matter what spot cam is telling you, they're going to raise the PE ratio."
"15074410","15074990"," Okay."
"15076630","15079570"," We're at the end of raising rates. "
"15080450","15082730"," We have the threat of raising rates."
"15084250","15092270"," The Fed will likely have to raise one or two more times, but that's only to not shock the market."
"15092270","15093710"," Listen to me closely when I say that. "
"15094130","15097630"," That's only to not shock the market."
"15098230","15102130"," So the Fed already committed to these these rate increases, right?"
"15111850","15114810"," But Jimmy, there's no unknowns here."
"15115350","15116570"," At this point, we know. "
"15117530","15122690"," So when you're at the tail end, remember the case, remember when we were selling spec growth in"
"15122690","15123570"," 2021?"
"15125650","15126530"," Front running it?"
"15127230","15134970"," When you're at the tail end, you don't get like, you don't get the Sunday, the hot fudge, the"
"15134970","15141110"," whipped cream, the cherry in the beginning, and then get to the end of the Sunday and expect a gold"
"15141110","15142010"," bar down there."
"15142790","15145470"," They begin to front run that stuff, right?"
"15145670","15150270"," As you're as we're coming out of this cycle of tightening, they're going to front run the upside"
"15150270","15152330"," just the same way as they did to the downside."
"15153430","15158270"," So, and we have another problem here, inflation coming down, right?"
"15159210","15162050"," Do you know why that matters to the price of stocks?"
"15162950","15166770"," Because the fucking dollar is worthless, less. "
"15167010","15170110"," So they have to jack up the price of stocks."
"15170870","15171350"," Does that make sense?"
"15173010","15177630"," If a Dixie goes to 89 cents, the price of stocks will go up."
"15178510","15179430"," That's another issue, right?"
"15181110","15187610"," And then you have a demand for PE ratios going up at the same time, too, due to a perceived"
"15188390","15191690"," notion of returning to normalcy or possible soft landing. "
"15193030","15198290"," Next thing that you need to grasp here is that we have a great Q2 earnings."
"15199110","15208830"," They're going to run us up into Q3 earnings in anticipation of good profits, because inflation"
"15208830","15210070"," is coming down."
"15210930","15214430"," And we're still seeing companies charge high prices. "
"15215230","15218670"," So, PPI is saying, so explain it like this."
"15219570","15226270"," If it cost me $5 to buy a rack of eggs to sell them to you for 10, right?"
"15227430","15229330"," Then I'm only making $5, right?"
"15230250","15237710"," If there's a Goldilocks window where the price of eggs now cost me $1, and I'm still charging you"
"15237710","15240670"," 10, I'm going to have a windfall quarter."
"15242170","15248190"," So there's an expectation knowing that inflation is coming down right now, and competition hasn't"
"15248190","15251570"," hit every market on the front end, the shit that you buy. "
"15252010","15255550"," There's still some people out there charging a lot more than they should be."
"15255710","15257250"," We know PPI is coming down."
"15257510","15260190"," We know that companies are price gouging right now. "
"15260610","15264410"," We know that Q3 is likely going to be a banner."
"15264850","15270910"," If not three and four, a banner profit driven quarter."
"15271210","15274290"," We know pricing, repricing has already happened on these stickers as well. "
"15274810","15280970"," So, saying all of that, we're coming into OPEC's."
"15281250","15282250"," We have a moment of weakness."
"15282990","15285130"," We also have Q3 earnings. "
"15286430","15292350"," We also have 50 BPS that are 25 BPS, likely two more raises, right?"
"15292530","15293450"," For 50 possibly."
"15293730","15298390"," It's a 25 and 25 known, no more expected inflation plummeting."
"15299050","15304890"," Goldilocks zone on unemployment, on jobs, PPI coming down. "
"15307030","15308870"," What I would say to you is this."
"15310370","15315610"," I would say to you, let's say you wanted to buy a short the market or something."
"15316330","15324210"," You can, if you're like, hey, I want some weakness into these guys. "
"15324410","15325930"," What's with my fucking calls here?"
"15326390","15328270"," Are they going to print these fucking things or what?"
"15328290","15329150"," Are they trying to pin Tesla?"
"15329890","15331350"," What the fuck is going on with Tesla?"
"15332030","15341390"," Okay, so we're looking at lowering, not lowering expectations, but we're in a bull market."
"15341950","15346170"," Whether you know it or not, we're in a bull market."
"15346630","15349150"," So what does that mean for you?"
"15351770","15355090"," It's the same as this rundown right here. "
"15356210","15357610"," Nothing has changed."
"15359710","15361390"," So you ready?"
"15362190","15364750"," You put some, some puts on, right?"
"15365330","15366270"," Ratio spreads."
"15368050","15368650"," Right?"
"15371270","15373250"," You see this puts, right?"
"15373530","15374910"," Ratio spreads for a correction. "
"15375170","15376610"," You want ratio spreads for a correction?"
"15377250","15377990"," Spy, right?"
"15380190","15380770"," Put spreads."
"15381710","15382510"," Ratio spreads."
"15382950","15388250"," Ratio spreads will pay if we bounce, put an extra time on them, one and a half or something, you're"
"15388250","15389350"," still going to get paid, right?"
"15389790","15390810"," Same thing right here. "
"15391410","15393270"," Monthly puts, right?"
"15394110","15397890"," Ratio spreads for your next level here, right?"
"15398610","15400030"," We're at a top right now."
"15400130","15401630"," We know this is a top, right?"
"15402090","15402450"," Simple, right?"
"15402730","15407050"," Come up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down."
"15407610","15410010"," Do you think this, do you think we're crashing here?"
"15411070","15411470"," We're not. "
"15415790","15416510"," No."
"15416510","15417430"," We're not."
"15418990","15421710"," So what you're going to expect here is this. "
"15423970","15426490"," This is what you're going to expect here."
"15427490","15428690"," We already tagged 450."
"15429390","15431530"," We actually tagged 451-31. "
"15432190","15434370"," So again, Spock ammo was wrong."
"15435550","15436230"," They're wrong again."
"15437810","15439090"," Thank you, Spock ammo. "
"15439090","15439890"," You were wrong again."
"15441350","15441890"," Okay?"
"15442490","15443810"," It's already broke 450."
"15444450","15445150"," They're wrong again. "
"15446310","15450970"," The JPM caller is up at 465-0."
"15451910","15454750"," Normally we'll trade above it like 470."
"15456790","15457330"," Okay?"
"15458050","15459330"," So what can you do here?"
"15459730","15461410"," If you're chasing, you're like, I want to sell this. "
"15462070","15465930"," The only thing that I can say to you chase is the same thing that I'm doing."
"15466990","15469510"," So you can, and we're in earnings season."
"15469950","15477030"," So being in earnings season, we're going to expect good earnings because last earnings season was"
"15477030","15479290"," good, right?"
"15479590","15481950"," So we know a couple things are going to happen here. "
"15481950","15487070"," We know that we're going to likely, we're not going to sell fucking earnings season."
"15487550","15488210"," We're not doing that."
"15489390","15490350"," Earnings will be good. "
"15491270","15491930"," Believe that."
"15492230","15492870"," They're going to be good."
"15493410","15495870"," Generally across the board, you're going to get good earnings. "
"15497130","15504330"," High probability of them having banner earnings due to inflation, not inflation, but PPI coming"
"15504330","15504730"," down."
"15505630","15506190"," Banner."
"15508770","15512870"," So we'll likely trade this sideways for ear earnings season, right?"

"16809170","16813950"," what you do so if i wake up tomorrow and there's a reason for the market to go down to"
"16813950","16823510"," 420 guess what i guess what i own right now hundreds in hundreds of 432s and 420s i own fucking"
"16823510","16833210"," hundreds of them i own them and they expire uh august 10th so what the fuck do i care"
"16834450","16841530"," if we go down there uh fuck yeah i'll make a ton of money i paid for them they're free"
"16842590","16848890"," they cost me nothing zero i've traded this whole market up made a bunch of money and i have free"
"16848890","16861290"," free hedging so i'm trying to like see here how like how i lose does it make sense are"
"16861290","16869550"," we getting this tesla getting knocked down right now god damn you tesla like i can't lose in this"
"16869550","16878290"," trade and i think that that's pretty much where the market is i think the market is like people are"
"16878290","16885490"," buying the underlying right or not people but like large uh large entities are buying the"
"16885490","16892490"," underlying and they're hedging to protect themselves so yeah like all these puts rolling and all"
"16892490","16899290"," these puts rolling in and uh what do the dealers do they drive it higher so everyone's well hedged"
"16899290","16904710"," market goes higher meanwhile where meanwhile you get like people fucking around and fin to it being"
"16904710","16909710"," like yeah i'm gonna put a million dollars against the market and they're getting fucking straight"
"16909710","16919570"," rolled so um the only thing i could suggest to you would be in good conscience note not"
"16919570","16927310"," financial advice in good conscience here is i understand that the vix is at a yearly low i"
"16927310","16936270"," understand chad showed me a great post someone made a post on tour that said here's 60 reasons why"
"16936270","16943850"," the stock market should crash right now and i was like i agree with all those reasons uh but that's"
"16943850","16947970"," not what the price of butter is right that's not what the price of the stock market is is it"
"16947970","16956810"," so the only thing i can say in good conscience here is a putback spread would seem appropriate"
"16956810","16965980"," a target of 440 and possibly now i think 425 but i would raise the strikes up a little bit"
"16965980","16974880"," uh on those putback spreads uh if they print you look like a rock star if we go up and"
"16974880","16983960"," you're wrong you're gonna make 10 percent that's a win to me both are a win and i do get"
"16983960","16991540"," the we have i do get that we have a moment of weakness into the 21st i do get that"
"16991540","17001320"," we have that um i understand that but i would be like like you know like look back"
"17001320","17008640"," spread it's awesome when you're right and you print three to five hundred percent uh but when"
"17008640","17014480"," you're wrong it fucking hurts i still got these calls on their three cents right now i try to smoke"
"17014480","17022060"," this uh apple trade into the bell not apple tesla excuse me i'm going to hold these things into the"
"17022060","17029480"," bell so uh speaking of tesla i'm going to also add some calls for tesla for the weekend coming into"
"17029480","17036260"," the close here uh so at 340 or 355 or so i'm going to start looking at some calls for"
"17036260","17043600"," tesla's er for next week uh i'm going to be looking for 721 c's uh and i'm going to run"
"17043600","17052880"," a lot of trade on them because i think they're going to announce uh there's a high probability of"
"17052880","17059680"," an announcement being imminent either this quarter or next quarter you're going to get a major uh"
"17059680","17066120"," news announcement from tesla it's either going to be one of three things my prediction here is that"
"17066120","17074080"," you're going to either get a stock split uh or an announcement that the cyber truck is going to"
"17074080","17082740"," finally roll out with a new kind of fsd they're going to make it claim that that fsd is fsd"
"17082740","17090220"," four level four i don't believe that it actually is level four level five but it isn't going to"
"17090220","17099660"," matter uh and that's going to set that stock off to the moon so in my view i don't care"
"17099660","17105420"," what they say dealers say i don't care what the market says so i'm going to end up putting on"
"17105420","17113800"," a big trade here into the close and i'll run this trade once again um after their er uh for"
"17113800","17124190"," their next er i'm"
"17124190","17130710"," hedged to the gills right now i've got fucking i'm so fucking hedged it's not even funny i'm like"

"17145530","17150850"," i have to be hedged i don't have a fucking choice and puts our dirt fucking cheap they cost nothing"
"17150850","17160830"," fucking pennies dude 10 cents dirt fucking cheap dirt fucking cheap you can put 10 cents on a"
"17160830","17168330"," day in my fucking investment accounts going up every day so like i'm sorry i don't i don't believe"
"17168330","17178290"," you when you say people aren't hedged that's bullshit yeah career law's making"
"17178290","17182690"," a good uh good case there he's saying uh general put call rate pc ratio not really a general"
"17182690","17187770"," indicator by itself plus all kinds of ways to hedge your book without yes you can you can i can"
"17187770","17192590"," sell calls i can sell puts i'm telling you guys man i want you guys to know something out there"
"17192590","17199530"," like i'm making a lot of money to share it's easy for me to buy puts and be wrong uh"
"17199530","17204270"," and it's oak it's it's meant for me to be wrong do you guys get to understand that concept like"
"17204270","17210290"," if my account is up like five grand in a day and i buy a thousand dollars and puts it"
"17210290","17220270"," means nothing to me uh just to hedge myself because i'm up five grand right like i don't know"
"17220270","17229930"," how i explain this like um they're just cheap they're dirt so so if you have if i own them"
"17229930","17236970"," if you own the market right uh let's see you own an underlying stock right and or let's see you"
"17236970","17245450"," on a hundred stocks and today i'm up five thousand dollars and we're coming into a window of"
"17245450","17250710"," weakness right now right we know that right we know we're coming into a window of weakness right we"
"17250710","17257810"," know we're coming into monthly opx so what's my natural thing going to be i can't leave my stock"
"17257810","17264490"," there and not protect try to protect it right i'm up five grand today what do i do i buy"
"17264490","17272950"," some fucking uh some puts been a grand if we go down into into monthly opx i i just i"
"17272950","17281750"," just kept my fucking accounts at that five grand right to make sense if i haven't lost anything now"
"17281750","17286410"," if i'm doing it and another guy's doing it another guy's doing it another guy's doing it another"
"17286410","17287530"," guy's doing it another guy's doing it another guy's doing it another guy's doing it another guy's"
"17287530","17293650"," doing guess what happens the fucking market goes up the dealers take the opposite side of all those"
"17293650","17298530"," trades they're not going to pay me they're not going to pay me my fucking my fucking underlying"
"17298530","17303110"," buying and paying my puts, they're going to take the counter trade there and push this market"
"17303110","17303470"," higher."
"17305070","17310550"," So the only thing I can recommend right now to you is either lower your expectations for a downside"
"17310550","17314790"," move, be tactful, or do a putback spread. "
"17315090","17315950"," I'm flabbergasted."
"17316870","17324270"," I'm fucking flabbergasted that Southside right now just isn't using putback spreads."
"17324890","17326310"," It's like a no fucking brainer. "
"17329450","17333110"," Like there's some kind of like internet cred of saying I called the top or something."
"17334470","17341510"," It's really bizarre too because even we do roll over right now when we roll over you get these guys"
"17341510","17344510"," they'll say like this is the top this is the crash."
"17355030","17357990"," We'll and so like this is it's the crash. "
"17358150","17359510"," They finally got to get it right."
"17360210","17367430"," We go down like here right and then we bounce and start going up again right but they're like"
"17367430","17371090"," magicians like the smoke bomb comes out."
"17371810","17380390"," I took my profit and I left for the next fight right when they should have just told you in"
"17380390","17386250"," the beginning yeah expect to pull back but limiting your expectations when we get here we'll figure"
"17386250","17388950"," out if there's another move to the downside right. "
"17391710","17397670"," It's always like doom and gloom um you know I don't know what to say to you it's it's always"
"17397670","17403730"," doom and gloom two cents three cents on my 290 C's right now it's always doom and gloom always"
"17403730","17407390"," every fucking day every fucking day every hour of the day every day of the week there's a fucking"
"17407390","17408010"," crash coming."
"17408570","17413650"," As a matter of fact I bet looking at this chart right here so that there's people on fin to"
"17413650","17420950"," it right now calling this a crash we're gonna crash here um you know what if if we're if we're"
"17420950","17425470"," gonna crash ask them for a price target I'll give you mine you want my price targets to the"
"17425470","17431450"," downside I'll give them right now I'll get 448 I'll give you three ready three downside PTs you"
"17431450","17431590"," ready?"
"17432490","17442470"," 448 oh let's take it here 440 440 and"
"17442470","17444810"," worst case scenario are you ready?"
"17445730","17455390"," worst case scenario 420 and I'll leave you with the last part of this you have"
"17455390","17462030"," it's improbable that you get down to 420 if you do get down to 420 there's like a 90%"
"17462030","17467370"," chance that you would mortgage your house sell your wife and kids and and spend every fucking"
"17467370","17475130"," dollar you have to buy it and I mean every sell your house your cars your kids your dogs uh"
"17475130","17492150"," all your sell your uh matchbox cars sell your playstation and full port long this"
"17492150","17497770"," like our whole stream has been waiting to get down to the weekly for like three months so if you"
"17497770","17502130"," can do it if you're a bear out there or a seller out there and you can get us down"
"17502130","17511840"," there fuck yeah do it yeah the crash of 448 scary"
"17511840","17520570"," shit you want some es numbers I got them for you hold them you know what I'll you know I'll"
"17520570","17528770"," just post this should I just post this on um Fintuit for you guys how about you know if you're"
"17528770","17533010"," a bear out there and you want to be or if you're if you're a collapsed bear and you want"
"17533010","17543010"," the truth they're gonna smoke these fucking bears oh man dude it's dude yes I can give you SPX"
"17543010","17552290"," if you want to ready yes you need a break below 4540 "
"17552290","17561870",".50 and a hold below it I think you get it but I would limit my downside"
"17561870","17573170"," expectations your target to the downside on the 19th 17th"
"17573170","17582990"," 18th 19th roughly 4480 "
"17582990","17592770",".0 um if you're expecting a bloodbath into OPEX or I don't fucking know people have"
"17592770","17600330"," bad ERs or something you smoke and crack out there uh your best your your your biggest downside"
"17600330","17610010"," move would likely be one two weeks uh 4300 on es that would be your downside target possible 4250"
"17610550","17618970"," and es paying on how long it takes to get there you likely need an outside event to trigger this"
"17618970","17628630"," you likely need like unknown bad news there is some out there you need like selling for no"
"17628630","17638430"," reason or selling for a bullshit reason trust me uh you need like a bullshit reason to"
"17638430","17644050"," sell yeah I don't care what I'm I'm fine with it too because what's some scam reason why to sell"
"17644050","17656250"," that low I'm down for it if you can get us down there it'd be stoked SPX down"
"17656250","17665990"," so SPX you need for to become bearish you need to get below 448232 your"
"17665990","17675650"," target below from there if you reject twice 4384.28 uh if you reject below there"
"17675650","17686170"," you're you're you're the most down I would expect would be 4240 4240"
"17686170","17695750"," likely 6.0 maybe 4240 and SPX"
"17695750","17703090"," uh but I'm telling you guys man I've been I've been hedging this whole run and I'm not making any"
"17703090","17711150"," money hedging like I might I'm like sometimes I'm up like 30% and then I leave them on I'm"
"17711150","17719630"," letting them burn basically the money is all better the upside move I'm making serious money on the"
