"176250","183220"," there do we've got a 11 minutes left well the first thing we'll do is we'll look at We'll look"
"183220","189320"," was a couple things you got Speaking twice we'll go over that a little bit We'll go over the spot"
"189320","192560"," cam report for this morning another report that they put out yesterday."
"192860","198440"," We'll take a look at today as well In terms of today, we're gonna get Tesla We'll get the spy"
"198440","202840"," real quick one thing I want you to key you in on it as we start the day off is"
"203320","210540"," Just start thinking about channels on the spy, okay Just keeps that keep some eyes open on"
"210540","210860"," channels."
"210880","215080"," There's a little bump down here We could get down here, but generally speaking you're gonna be"
"215080","220980"," looking for Trend channel one thing on this morning's open as well to keep in mind. "
"221120","221420"," You saw it."
"221500","225580"," I think there's a little bit of a sell-off And Tesla not too big of a deal."
"225860","231980"," It should continue to go up today Now just the just basically getting started for the open this"
"231980","236220"," morning now you're gonna look for a trend channel It's possible at some point. "
"236540","240300"," You could see a trapping of bears It will go on a second here."
"240360","249610"," We'll get rid of this You could see some you could get that quick break up to 450 If we"
"249610","254210"," don't get the quick break up to 450 and we trade down I wouldn't I wouldn't doubt it that we"
"254210","261029"," come back up and at least touch 450 at some point Now with that being said 450 of course is"
"261029","261750"," the target, right?"
"262370","267990"," We'll look at below load book map here in a few moments That's we can look for that 450 resistance"
"267990","275430"," now if we do trade below Be careful if you're bare you might get a bear trap down here one"
"275430","279490"," two and then that rip higher up here too Later in the day."
"279570","285150"," So just be careful of this conscience of this we know about the vault figure being down below here"
"285150","290630"," and We know ultimately we'll talk later on this morning as well about some price targets above"
"290630","295890"," around 4 16 4 70 And how we get there if we can get there when we'll get there It's"
"295890","297590"," funny funnily enough yesterday. "
"297950","306310"," We're talking about Possibly heading up there and at the end of the day yesterday Spock Emma put"
"306310","312470"," out a report talking about something similar to that Happening down the road here."
"313070","317510"," So I guess that little bit of risk that we could go there is even more more or less quite"
"317510","323410"," possible in the next 15 days or so We'll take a look at Tesla as well And just take a"
"323410","327170"," peek at it heading into the open ear the giant move up, right?"
"327830","331170"," nice break above This channel here."
"331270","335870"," We'll try to make the thicken this up a little bit for you But do you think that Tesla can"
"335870","336630"," go up more today?"
"337090","344210"," uh, not anti Tesla going up more today and tread and the reason for that personal is because a lot"
"344210","351870"," of traders a lot of Just longtime bulls wait until the day after report to trade it. "
"352330","358210"," So there's a lot of money out there So they're there that want to enter that these aren't the best"
"358210","358770"," yellow lines."
"358770","359130"," Are they?"
"360390","370330"," So these are kind of weird Just be conscious of that As we trade Tesla If you if you're afraid"
"370330","371430"," you're not going to catch a bounce."
"371670","379430"," I understand the key on Tesla is to grab The open right away Uh, and if it does sell off"
"379430","385250"," you average in so if you've got I don't know $1,000 You uh, kick in uh, you know 10"
"385250","389490"," grand and then you jump in with 30 grand and then 40 grand Uh, then whatever you have left over"
"389490","395550"," another 10 20 grand top it all off Tesla has a tendency on days like today to just rip to"
"395550","399970"," uh, some some resistance points What are those gonna look like?"
"400090","404770"," We know you've got some sellers and trap sellers up here We know that the price target's gonna be"
"404770","408830"," somewhere up in here around 13 to 1400 At some point today. "
"408950","413430"," That's the bulls are gonna want today that 1314 Uh, hundred do they get it today?"
"413750","419730"," We've seen stuff like this happen right that quick sell off on the open And then we blast uh to"
"419730","425590"," these highs so be conscious of that as we trade today That there could be a quick sell right on"
"425590","430890"," that right off the bell some profit taking But then you're going to also see buyers, uh, jump in we"
"430890","436730"," will have Uh, both spy and tesla spun up here in just a few moments Matter of fact, I'll get"
"436730","441890"," that rolling for you guys right now so that we're ready to rock Oh, we got tesla booked that up"
"441890","446890"," already and we get the spy book that never turned it off last night Just had it running all night"
"446890","456780"," long All night long Let's take a look in here and see what's going on See that 450 above"
"456780","463480"," there Way to see that above that's the target if you get panicky at all today Uh, let's say we"
"463480","468000"," do sell off spy right off the bell We usually at least make that tag a second time."
"468200","470060"," So don't panic sell or you can panic."
"470320","474600"," So I understand if you panic sell But we typically will still uh trade higher. "
"475000","479540"," There's a little bit more selling pressure here as well on on the spy We'll take a look at tesla"
"479540","487540"," as well right now And I ain't seeing shit for sale There's your 1100 target above We'll look for"
"487540","495920"," strikes above that that moment there See if we can get to that 1,300 Clear skies above to 1150"
"497920","503380"," There's your 1200 And to be honest if you're short today, you're going to be scared shitless,"
"503560","503600"," right?"
"503780","506520"," You'll get that short squeeze You'll get panicked shorts."
"506980","515039"," I'm going to give a price target today if we can keep momentum up Uh, let's call it and start"
"515039","523620"," with 1250 on the day And see if we can push even higher to 1300 I think it's not out"
"523620","528840"," of the realm of possibility Uh for tesla, so we'll leave we'll leave tesla right off the bell."
"529120","531280"," I know you guys are pumped on on tesla. "
"531380","539270"," So Now that's what that's what we'll do is we'll keep it on tesla at this point And we'll we'll"
"539270","544410"," watch this opening bell see if it'll cruise up to at least 1100 right off the opening bell Good"
"544410","545470"," more into all of you out there."
"545610","550410"," Hope everybody's doing well Do you know you guys load the fucking boat on zero dates?"
"551030","555730"," I realized this morning that not only did I get 10 sixties and ten or four seven sixties and four"
"555730","562950"," seventies I got four fucking fifties I got a bunch of like four fifties for April 22nd to April"
"562950","569510"," 25th Yeah, four fifties and four sixties in there so i'm pumped five more minutes till the opening"
"569510","579430"," bell We're going to look at some other stuff here for today I haven't put any I haven't"
"579430","586710"," put any any any support and resistance levels and yet this morning I'm just enamored by what's"
"586710","593780"," going on with uh With uh with tesla this morning and then with spy i'm some so stoked at the"
"593780","596560"," at the at the uh End of the day yesterday."
"596840","601800"," I said I was I wish well the luck in the world the boat tesla bulls And so i'm always"
"601800","607260"," happy to see tesla bulls stoked on twitter because they get beaten down sometimes They get shit all"
"607260","611300"," the time and it's whatever I see tesla bulls happy It makes my fucking day. "
"611400","615680"," It actually turned my whole entire night around Last night to see the excitement and tesla bulls."
"615960","622220"," So if you're tesla bull congratulations tesla bear I told you yesterday not to do that right and I"
"622220","625760"," ran with spy I wasn't gonna run with tesla I was gonna run with spy so I can have a"
"625760","630260"," little bit more safety in the spy than tesla But I'd see them paying dividends if you're a spy bull"
"630260","636540"," today Accuse bull today and the rub-off on other tickers as well You'll be feeling that bump as"
"636540","640840"," well So the report for today futures are higher trading at four to four 85 volatility estimate"
"640840","647120"," holds at 1.2 percent open to close as despite higher market prices We saw an increase in negative"
"647120","654860"," gamma For the spx resistance at 4500 then 4520 Maybe we get that upper bump right you get up to"
"654860","661380"," 1,100 on that bump too Support is at 4450 mark those on your on your charts It's an interesting"
"661380","661920"," few sessions."
"662160","665580"," Just say we give an edge to we treat market prices as we thought the cows was driven By a"
"665580","667400"," very short-term trading link to the VIX expiration. "
"667720","668960"," We got that trade at the end of the day."
"669220","675340"," I think winky or uh josh or somebody We'll end up going in one last time in those puts those"
"675340","680820"," things printed like fucking 600 percent yesterday The s&p closed down to modest 0.07 percent"
"680820","684880"," There's obviously obviously quite a virgin from the cues Which is hit hard but Netflix and variety"
"684880","689820"," of summer stocks down in sympathy New realize that we know that tech's gonna go swing higher and"
"689820","695780"," lower currently right now than spike Uh in that you can make even bigger gains on on on those"
"695780","701200"," swings on both on both sides of that trade When I asked to respect the price action of s&p,"
"701320","706360"," which is likely bolstered by Tesla plus 7 percent pre market I think we're about 10 percent now or"
"706360","707000"," 9 percent."
"707120","713000"," We were at one point this morning With yesterday's chunky expiration Uh, we saw a shift higher in"
"713000","713340"," key levels. "
"713520","721420"," The name of the zero gamma 452 450 22 call wall baby car wall 4,700 This appears to be"
"721420","725060"," driven by uh driven from losing near to our map the money calls They place them with slightly"
"725060","729460"," longer out of the money calls This leads to distinct flattening of the spx camera curve."
"729720","735460"," We got two more minutes left We'll try to run through this Because roughly 400 million of spx gamma"
"735460","741660"," or mm uh near 4500 but but today right the spx would need to trade up to near 4,700"
"741660","748540"," to find an equivalent notional 4,700 But this is suggesting that the positions that were supplying"
"748540","755180"," positive gamma all jumped Uh from 4,450, 4,500 to 4,500 but greater than 4,500 This is"
"755180","759580"," something we generally see around large month the opex third friday and not during mid-week Carve"
"759580","763720"," yesterday's opex fairytale again And we think related to vixx bribery We think there are a fair"
"763720","768060"," amount of tactical longer-term put edges being held in terms of our aggressively short-term calls"
"768660","772680"," But your clothes rolled higher less positive gamma also in first higher volatility less resistance"
"772680","780440"," above 4,500 There's less hedging needed by dealers shorting into rallies Uh sharp right screw this"
"780440","784420"," indicates these indices are quite sensitive to changes implied IV And with lower higher implied IV"
"784420","789000"," the dealer hedge uh buying sound which in first selling This is a hallmark of put dominated"
"789000","789700"," markets, right?"
"789700","795060"," Heavy uh of call of call heavy resistance van air Again as noted above near term began my inducing"
"795060","801360"," calls where I moved to higher strikes higher strikes See the vixx currently just under 20 we've"
"801360","805780"," been in the opinion that traders would not aggressively sell vol until FMC or some resolution or"
"805780","810280"," we're gonna get out of this we'll come back this in just a minute This is the conversation we'd"
"810280","816000"," have in the past couple days here right We're already at 1074 feet just second here gonna i gotta i"
"816000","821180"," gotta do something here i gotta check my charts over here and i gotta i gotta watch the charts over"
"821180","829660"," here on a different screener i'm gonna bring down my charts over here six seconds until the opening"
"829660","866960"," bell three two one Sorry"
"866960","882240"," i take some money on some positions here Whoo"
"882240","888720"," that was nice I took some i took some i took some zero dates off the table on spy uh"
"888720","895480"," dated for today And we have more call buyers right now currently on the spy uh just want to let"
"895480","905180"," you know people are rolling into uh 450 c's the price is bouncing around right now Between"
"905180","915180"," 160 and 180 You might be able to score some some cheap calls here To be in scrolled"
"915180","923100"," scroll this out a little bit Very happy right now i've even got some uh longer data calls they're"
"923100","930200"," already up 100 Just on premium kick I'll allow you to see here on tesla right off the bell We"
"930200","936180"," do have some sellers stepping in here on tesla right off the opening bell pair of 1080 Be aware"
"936180","943920"," though that there are buyers ready to rock at 1050 down below Here indicator is green right off the"
"943920","949900"," bell as well Uh look the look at the do these buyers down here uh shorts are going to get"
"949900","953260"," absolutely fucking crushed Off this open."
"953480","961860"," This is massive support on tesla So we'll pay attention to tesla also spy heading higher to 449 33"
"961860","969540"," looking tag that 450 right away off the opening bell So Let's take a look at uh, let me see"
"969540","975800"," if we can bring this over here for you This is that if you're looking for that tag on 450"
"975800","984680"," this morning on the spy you have another uh resistance above here at 452 on the spies will change"
"984680","994650"," this our two up here to 452 And we'll make our one today 450 Well,"
"994770","1003690"," I think we trade up the 450 probably 452 We'll take a look at tesla next And so we got"
"1003690","1008910"," let's take a tesla So we like we got 1050 here right and we've got that 10 all the way"
"1008910","1015830"," down to 1025 So somewhere in this in this vicinity here and we're looking for a dip I don't know"
"1015830","1020250"," if you're able to get down to 1025 For a dip by down here if you're not already in tesla,"
"1020430","1026770"," I think they're going to start buying it right away due to Uh, watch it due to watching This right"
"1026770","1032050"," here when you start to take a look down below see if these buyers are still down here Yeah, and"
"1032050","1038210"," they're just sitting down here to actually they're now up to 1060 Uh in major buyers down at 1050"
"1039050","1044890"," And this goes all the way down To a thotming thousand bucks right here. "
"1045150","1049270"," There's some bulls hoping they get in at a thousand Uh, I don't know if you can get I don't"
"1049270","1050570"," know if it'll trade down to a thousand."
"1050710","1056970"," I'm highly doubting that Uh this morning So we look at Andrew some calls here at some point on"
"1056970","1066870"," tesla 450 is already up to two dollars and 16 cents They were as low as 170"
"1066870","1081110"," on the spy Spy"
"1081110","1090920"," now tracking up the 449 81 We'll see if it holds Let's take a look real"
"1090920","1097380"," quick at the spy and see if how the see how bad the You see or how much resistance there"
"1097380","1108040"," is the trading higher Looks like there's the sellers here at 450.02 And"
"1108040","1114780"," then again at 450.88 not quite at that 452 There's some sellers above here 452."
"1114780","1136410"," I want to lower that spot gamma prediction of uh 452 to 451 450 91 It's"
"1136410","1145090"," interesting about that resistance too is if we're able to break past So this is 450 99 There's like"
"1145090","1153690"," two resistance levels here If you take the money and run here Right where we are And uh try to"
"1153690","1159750"," re-enter if we're able to break through this this this volatility here at some point Uh, it'd be"
"1159750","1160590"," worth another trade. "
"1160710","1166890"," So uh, there's a small bounce right here or small small root row rejection here at 449 92 But if"
"1166890","1171930"," we're able to come down here And grab another run higher This could be earlier took it could be"
"1171930","1177170"," like here and then you know a couple bounces and then we get up there, but A key being is"
"1177170","1181350"," if we're able to squeeze above this zone right here Uh, this opens the door."
"1181490","1184570"," Okay to go higher Uh, so you just have your bull."
"1184790","1190870"," This is another leg up uh opportunity over here If you uh are a conservative bull and you want to"
"1190870","1196150"," wait Uh, the key for you today is going to be at It was a good trade. "
"1196290","1200850"," I made a lot of money in that trade I want to have a scream right now and blow up"
"1202910","1205930"," We're gonna put this at uh, support lies at 45."
"1206390","1216180"," We'll raise this up a little bit Support lies at 45 4 4 5 0 This is your safety net"
"1216180","1217460"," as a bull down here, right?"
"1217740","1222180"," Feel it re-inpatient bull You want to wait as apparently as the all these lines are still here from"
"1222180","1223440"," yesterday And they're all kind of lining up."
"1223560","1233040"," It's pretty cool pretty fucking cool Right there That one up there. "
"1233040","1234800"," This all seems pretty natural, right?"
"1235100","1244140"," Oh, it's pretty good Another test again of 4 49 93 We'll put s."
"1244520","1245960"," Yes, this is s2 down below."
"1246180","1247340"," We'll call this s1."
"1247400","1248100"," Where's s1?"
"1248980","1258820"," s1 up Right right yeah right about here Matter of fact, we'll put"
"1258820","1266280"," s1 right here Because I don't I think if we break this if we break this channel here We will"
"1266280","1275240"," head all the way down test too Totally that one up right here for you And we'll head back over"
"1275240","1282540"," to tesla Hell yes Oh, yeah, baby. "

"1512600","1513940"," about a couple other tickers this morning."
"1514140","1520520"," We'll get back in the spot cam report Our bottom line though is that we'll recognize one month"
"1520520","1528080"," realized vol in the sp 500 now lower at 16 17 Which gives some breathing room for IV With vixa"
"1528080","1529600"," fair value is now slightly lower."
"1529760","1536940"," This may signal traders selling pre fmc volatility And holding longer dated our bottom line is that"
"1536940","1543020"," those of you who have been out or been with us for a while now, uh That our base case"
"1543020","1549020"," is bullish if markets are over the vault figure of 4450 And so when they're saying that right as"
"1549020","1557740"," long as we stay above here Uh, as long as we stay above here we hold this right So you"
"1557740","1563500"," want to be you want to be holding this uh, this So the vault figure has raised I guess I"
"1563500","1568020"," haven't looked closely at it But it looks like the vault figure is raising now to this zone here. "
"1568020","1571400"," Okay, it's 4450 I think it's still it makes the below."
"1571620","1578300"," I'll have to look at this morning, uh, but basically if we stay Above this zone right here, right?"
"1578520","1585240"," We're bullish we talked yesterday about uh The bulls if they're able to maintain and we're into the"
"1585240","1585500"," clothes."
"1585740","1588760"," Remember in the clothes yesterday about these clock calls And I said to yesterday. "
"1588760","1594100"," I said you see that little bump up right here This was the key yesterday that last little save."
"1594480","1595880"," This was the save yesterday."
"1596200","1602640"," This was uh, this was the quiet steel The quiet guy in the background Saving us from rolling this"
"1602640","1603280"," market over. "
"1603480","1608420"," That was the hint heading into the clothes And so you want to be buying into these dips down below"
"1608420","1618360"," lower volatility and a grind higher as time passes Our, uh,"
"1618420","1618620"," okay."
"1618680","1624480"," So our bottom line is a rejection of 4500 and or VIX above 20 signals a retest of 4450 so"
"1624480","1630040"," remember that today as well Uh, remember today if we do hit if we get rejection on 450 which we're"
"1630040","1635160"," at right now We're trying to break through 450 if we don't break through right we will retest 445"
"1635160","1645020"," once again Uh to ensure that we want to go ahead higher Right, and that's that"
"1645020","1650120"," this is that case I talked to you about Uh before we opened this morning was if we start to"
"1650120","1653960"," break down in here It's a fake out to bears and we start running higher."
"1653960","1659680"," Okay Now so be careful of this if you're a bear if you want to be a bear Uh, the"
"1659680","1665160"," recommendation is that uh, if let's say we start to break down here I wouldn't be picking up any"
"1665160","1672240"," kind of a bear trade Until you get some kind of a confirmation of rejection around Around 4450 or"
"1672240","1679400"," even lower 4424.25 or so Otherwise, uh, you could try to play a short play as a bear in"
"1679400","1685320"," here or possibly down to here Uh, but it'd be very risky anywhere down in here anywhere down in"
"1685320","1695210"," here at this point Now we're going to look at something else We got something to look at"
"1695210","1695530"," today. "

"1745370","1747970"," marketing The tech there's to an extent pumping the market for him. "
"1748130","1753490"," I or there's an implication that they are Uh, so forever that crowd is that he's speaking to it's"
"1753490","1754310"," we're doing a good job."

"1759910","1764430"," to 470 if you don't have some headline news So there has to be something that we don't know about"
"1764430","1771470"," there's some other factors involved as well Now reaching up on tesla 10 88 Looking for that elusive"
"1771470","1782320"," 1100 Right off the bell just kept flying Uh, so yeah, do I think that um There's"
"1782320","1786720"," part has to do with powell part There's a bunch of other technical reasons we could go up from here"
"1786720","1793960"," where we're very overly hedged Uh, and we'll look at those here in just a moment Uh, good job j"

"2387000","2388280"," Pull it up, GNRC."
"2389960","2391620"," We'll look up MLS for you. "
"2392180","2393820"," Then I want to go over something with you guys."
"2394500","2396440"," I wonder now if this is going to get front run."
"2397380","2400920"," Because if too many people know about it, I could get front run at this point. "
"2408100","2408540"," All right."
"2409360","2410560"," So let's take a look at that."
"2410740","2412940"," Let's see if that 1060 is still intact for. "
"2416520","2417260"," There we go."
"2417620","2418060"," 1070."
"2418300","2419560"," Now we've got buyers on Tesla. "
"2421700","2423700"," We're going to take a look at something else this morning."
"2429960","2430360"," Okay."
"2430680","2434720"," So while we're having this quick saw off right here, note that VWAPS had 1075. "
"2435600","2437860"," Note their buyers at 1070 on the spy."
"2438820","2442680"," We're going to go over this before you guys are prepared for this."
"2442820","2442980"," Okay. "
"2443240","2445560"," Especially if you guys have other things to do."
"2445700","2446080"," Excuse me."
"2446160","2446580"," I get the hiccups. "
"2450460","2454000"," This came out yesterday after the bell on April 20th."
"2454360","2457260"," The Fed meeting may spark the next stock market rally."
"2459020","2462140"," This is courtesy of Mike Kramer in mod capital management. "
"2463660","2466340"," It's titled by the Fed meeting sell the Fed minutes."
"2467100","2470480"," And maybe the name of the game for the stock market, at least since the start of 2022."
"2470960","2474240"," The minutes have been a cause of concern for markets. "
"2476160","2481220"," While the FOMC meetings have resulted in face ripping risk on rallies."
"2482260","2487160"," The reasons that can seem hard to explain, especially since both the minutes and meetings have had"
"2487160","2490020"," seemingly more and more hawkish stones."
"2490960","2492480"," But that does not seem to be the pattern. "
"2492940","2496200"," The markets' duration may be easier to understand than seat than they seem."
"2497060","2502500"," Nestia often refers to these sharp rallies as a vantage rate in their daily notes."
"2502500","2508960"," At the same time, a spot camera hero indicator can often depict the hedging activity taking place"
"2509500","2511600"," ahead of these types of macro events, right?"
"2512900","2516500"," We're all bearish and we're all saying, oh, we're going down at the FOMC meeting. "
"2516640","2519960"," FOMC meeting, OPEC, FOMC meeting."
"2523360","2527940"," And mod capital saying you fade the minutes, but not the FOMC meeting."
"2529580","2529700"," Okay. "
"2529700","2534160"," And you'll see the FOMC meetings are in the green here, right?"
"2534820","2537060"," When these are the actual minutes up here."
"2540280","2543260"," Look at the chart above in the timing of the prominent market solves and massive rebounds."
"2543520","2545900"," The SP500 all-time high came on January 4."
"2546420","2549500"," Just one day before the FOMC minutes in a subsequent drop. "
"2550160","2551820"," The rebound started on January 25."
"2552200","2554500"," The day of the FOMC meeting followed by a nearly 5% rally."
"2555400","2558500"," Nearly the same thing happened when the minutes released were released on February 16. "
"2558500","2564160"," The SP500 dropped sharply again, followed by a massive, almost unexplainable rally that followed"
"2564160","2565440"," the FOMC meeting on March 17."
"2566300","2570340"," Thus far, the release of the minutes on April 6 has led to a modest decline, whether the decline"
"2570340","2572120"," worsens is yet to be seen."
"2573780","2574440"," Hedging activity. "
"2574820","2578700"," This market volatility may be simpler to explain that it seems having to do simply with managing"
"2578700","2580840"," risk and using the options market."
"2581780","2585960"," The hint being that you have to be very well hedged heading into these risk off events, right?"
"2585960","2589340"," And then you put your risk back into the market."
"2589540","2590300"," You have to buy the market. "
"2591260","2594840"," The VIX index, the measure of market implied volatility, seems ideal for measuring this."
"2595000","2598480"," Typically, the VIX has been at the lower end of the trading range heading into the effect minutes."
"2599240","2604480"," At the higher end of the range heading into the FOMC meetings, it would suggest that the market is"
"2604480","2608960"," simply looking at protection heading into the FOMC meetings by adding puts to guard against the"
"2608960","2609960"," uncertainty of a Fed meeting. "
"2610680","2614260"," The actual investors buying puts results in market makers being short puts."
"2614260","2618120"," To hedge exposure, the market maker will then short futures to remain hedged."
"2618700","2622020"," As the market moves, the market makers are forced to continue to reposition their hedges. "
"2622640","2629020"," If the markets are falling as more investors buy puts, the more futures market makers need to short"
"2629020","2629960"," to stay hedged."
"2630800","2631540"," D risking events."
"2631900","2636360"," Meanwhile, once the FOMC meeting is over, there is a D risking event, which results in implied"
"2636360","2637180"," volatility dropping. "
"2638020","2640420"," As results in put options, this is the key part right here."
"2641080","2646500"," Losing value quickly, which can cause investors to sell their puts and wind their hedges, this in"
"2646500","2650720"," turn results in the vantage rate, causing market makers to buy back their short future hedges."
"2651080","2655120"," For those looking for a short-term market bottom, it might not come until after the FOMC meeting,"
"2655680","2660120"," as investors look to de-risk and wind their bearish hedges and a vantage rate kicks in, giving the"
"2660120","2663480"," stock market another big post-market risk on rally. "
"2665240","2667380"," So you can always pause this and come back to it."
"2667380","2670960"," And they do note almost a 5% rally."
"2671940","2672920"," We'll look at that here. "
"2673300","2678120"," If we have a slow part today, we'll take a look at what 5% would be where we could"
"2678120","2679000"," possibly wind up."
"2679680","2683060"," And if this even gets, it's possible this could get front-run."
"2683580","2688980"," If too many people know about this, they'll front-run that rally before we even get to FOMC on the"
"2688980","2689740"," 4th and 5th. "
"2696340","2698600"," Oh, there goes the 240 on GR at GNRC."
"2698920","2699620"," They're winky."
"2700680","2700920"," The 240. "
"2701840","2704240"," Slights support here are 250 already."
"2712600","2716580"," When buy 70, sell 80 on MOS."
"2718260","2719760"," Take a quick look here at the spy. "
"2724420","2727440"," See where support lies on the spy."
"2728680","2730720"," Fire is down at 448, 447."
"2732650","2733760"," All the way down to 446. "
"2734680","2737260"," I doubt they let it get down to 445 today."
"2737260","2741980"," I think you're going to see bull flags and rips all day long."
"2750080","2756200"," 448.20. See if this holds right here. "
"2757000","2758860"," All right, I'm going to leave up test layer for a minute."
"2758960","2760180"," I'm going to be right back in two seconds."
"2760700","2761460"," And I'll be right back. "
"2761640","2762660"," I'll leave this stream up, of course."
"2763120","2768280"," And I'm going to put trade the news on so that you guys can hear our boy talk in the"
"2768280","2769640"," background while I'm on a quick break."
"2769800","2771940"," You're listening to Trade the News. "
"2792050","2794330"," We're going to discuss it."
"2794590","2797030"," We're going to discuss Netflix here in just a little while."
"2858660","2863740"," I'm saying that he's announcing an additional $800 million aid package for Ukraine. "
"2899920","2907040"," I'm confirming the latest aid package for Ukraine includes drones and heavy artillery as well as"
"2907040","2907040"," ammunition."
"3048180","3059420"," I'm saying"
"3059420","3065520"," that he'll send a supplemental budget request to Congress to ensure that we can continue fighting"
"3065520","3066300"," aid to Ukraine."
"3082300","3083300"," All right, here I go. "
"3083400","3090740"," I'm back in just a second here."
"3093370","3094230"," All right."
"3125790","3130270"," 11 a.m. we have the drum towel. "
"3131130","3132010"," Welcome to remarks."
"3132310","3136510"," These are pre-recorded video at 11 a.m. Not too big of a deal."
"3137330","3140490"," And usually not too big of a deal when he gives a pre-recorded statement. "
"3140750","3141810"," It's usually quite short."
"3143290","3146970"," He's usually very vague in that first speech."
"3147150","3153890"," That's at 11 a.m. But then we have a live discussion with J.P. with J.P. at 1"
"3153890","3157450"," p.m. I think about those speeches. "
"3157450","3163670"," They usually, it's at the IMF debate on global economy."
"3165270","3169290"," They usually start out okay and then they can get kind of messy over time."
"3170530","3178930"," So the key to those later discussions is to pay attention to the ass end of those discussions. "
"3179550","3181290"," So we'll be tuning in live for that."
"3181890","3185970"," We'll listen to the 11 a.m. and then we'll pay attention live for the 1 p.m. live discussion."
"3185970","3191350"," The UK to your yield is now hit the highest level going back to 2009 at 1.71% following"
"3191350","3193050"," the commentary from the Bank of England's man. "
"3195750","3196750"," Close this out here."
"3201240","3206540"," Who makes me want to make some want to grab some T.l.t. T.l.t. rolled over today"
"3206540","3208080"," down to it's down to 120."
"3209580","3238420"," Might be a chance to grab a dip on T.l.t. I'm"
"3238420","3241860"," confirming U.S. will ban Russian affiliated ships from U.S. ports. "
"3244840","3246400"," We'll bring the spy over real quick."
"3248040","3250680"," Look to see if it can grab entry down below."
"3251280","3255660"," Talked this morning about touching 450 and looking for a dip buy down here. "
"3256120","3260620"," It could also break below this channel, trap some bears that get overly bearish."
"3260620","3262600"," And continue that run higher."
"3262880","3264460"," So we'll look for a dip buy down here. "
"3273470","3282020"," The same group of buyers are still on board down here at 10.60. Looks like they've come slightly"
"3282020","3283540"," lower to 10.50 on Tesla."
"3284320","3287160"," So keep that in mind as we track the spy as well."
"3287940","3295780"," And we'll also take a look at N.D.X. Nasdaq this morning I said I promised to keep an"
"3295780","3299420"," eye on Nasdaq more closely for you guys that are just tech bulls. "
"3317080","3318800"," This is an N.D.X chart from yesterday."
"3322480","3325380"," Came down here I said to you yesterday I don't like buying these right."
"3326580","3328400"," Look at where we went to 4227. "
"3329680","3331400"," One rejection, a second rejection."
"3332560","3333900"," You're going to be looking for another dip buy."
"3335080","3337240"," Where is he going to want to close this gap down below. "
"3337920","3338840"," That's their intent right."
"3339020","3341960"," So keep your eyes down here on this."
"3342880","3348820"," Keep your eyes on this area down below here at 14.056. I doubt we trade down here. "
"3349460","3350360"," To be honest with you."
"3350740","3352240"," I think this might hold here."
"3352840","3356460"," I guess I shouldn't say look for that down below but be looking for. "
"3357040","3362020"," A weekly natural gas inventory data in a little over 15 minutes."
"3363060","3366040"," Expected range between plus 33 and plus 35 billion."
"3367740","3369420"," There's right around here. "
"3370220","3377000"," You want to see 14125 old to trade the next leg."
"3378060","3384620"," We'll be able to trade this next leg up to 14."
"3384960","3391460"," I've had this one at 14.06 but it's probably closer to 14.5. We'll bring it back down to"
"3391460","3399800"," 14.493. We'll bring that leg down to a more minor one here. "
"3409350","3417670"," We'll see if we can get some hold line for the bulls and this push higher later in the day."
"3433510","3434930"," Still no red pull down below."
"3435230","3441590"," Still have buyers absorbing at 10.60. 10.50 is where lots of money is sitting at on Tesla. "
"3443390","3445950"," I'm going to look at Tesla real quick for an entry."
"3451480","3453420"," There's a candlestick chart here."
"3457440","3464540"," Down below here this is 10.63. The 10.50 area is right in there too. "
"3464680","3466000"," It's just right in here."
"3468640","3470640"," Let's see if we can grab some calls."
"3485130","3490450"," It's the most important thing right now is maintaining unity on the sanctions against Russia in the"
"3490450","3491170"," sport for Ukraine. "
"3491770","3498070"," When we look in the grab Tesla April 22nd, Tesla 1100 C's for 450."
"3498810","3500810"," There's $4.50 right now."
"3501390","3502850"," I'm thinking I'm down slightly more right now. "
"3504010","3505530"," We'll grab some of those calls."
"3515880","3516960"," We'll bring it down to one minute."
"3518480","3519640"," Right where we are. "
"3520600","3521740"," Right down in here."
"3561300","3564840"," It's going to be in for 4.35 on 1100 C."
"3593180","3594800"," Yeah, Joe, I had to go to the bathroom."
"3596100","3597360"," Good morning, Joe. "
"3597560","3597980"," How are you, brother?"
"3601700","3602780"," Fucking super stoked."
"3602780","3603920"," How are you feeling today?"
"3614590","3615370"," Yeah, no."
"3615650","3625250"," So I sold Friday calls on spy and I sold Monday calls on spy now. "
"3625310","3627510"," So that's spot camera report."
"3627630","3628870"," We'll take a look at that spot camera report."
"3628950","3630670"," Let's see if the buyers are still here. "
"3631370","3632710"," Yeah, they're still down here."
"3635370","3635770"," 1060."
"3640660","3642560"," Some more buyers waiting down here. "
"3642860","3644000"," 1054 more roll."
"3644660","3645580"," We'll see if we can get it."
"3650310","3653890"," Those are 4.35s and after 5.20, but my order didn't fill. "
"3654030","3655450"," I missed the order by just a second."
"3658440","3662740"," So I'm hoping it'll come back down and fill 4.35 on 1100 C."
"3668350","3670130"," So that's spot camera report, right?"
"3670250","3673230"," We'll take a look at what their implication is in that spot camera report."
"3674390","3677370"," Or what they're trying to tell you in that spot camera report. "
"3678390","3679790"," This is important stuff, right?"
"3679930","3681270"," This is stuff you really want to know about."
"3694350","3700570"," So that spot camera report that came out yesterday, right?"
"3702430","3706790"," You can see here, let's talk about the actual meetings, right?"
"3707870","3712850"," Now, when we have these sell-offs into these meetings, this is the actual meeting, right?"
"3715120","3716060"," Triggers move higher."
"3716260","3716700"," This is a meeting. "
"3717280","3718760"," We didn't sell off as much."
"3719260","3723380"," You know, I think the implication back here was that we'd go deeper, right?"
"3724080","3725900"," We didn't actually go that deep here."
"3726480","3731960"," Here's another meeting where the actual meeting was right here and we ripped here, okay?"
"3733480","3734280"," These are the minutes. "
"3734640","3735820"," This is the meeting, right?"
"3736440","3738360"," And we're already kind of down here."
"3738580","3740380"," The point being is that the minutes are here."
"3740460","3741480"," We've already made our way down. "
"3742940","3751070"," So where we think we're going, we're heading down, let's say, to 420, they're implying that because"
"3751070","3757150"," we're all hoping for 420 or 400, they won't actually get that trade."
"3758490","3766730"," That it'll peter out somewhere, possibly down around 430, 440, 430, and we're actually going to get"
"3766730","3767330"," a face-ripper."
"3768590","3775930"," That face-ripper, in turn, we would then maybe revisit later on that 420, 400, okay?"
"3776410","3778170"," And this is the stuff Winky talks about, right?"
"3778370","3786030"," It's like, yeah, you'll get to 400, but it ain't going to fucking be during the FOMC, if that makes"
"3786030","3786530"," any sense. "
"3787190","3793030"," The other key in this chart here too is we already traded higher than this resistance to see how"
"3793030","3793670"," we're higher here."
"3793670","3797850"," So the next one to take out is up here at this 475 or so."
"3798250","3803070"," So this implication would be that we would at least touch this one, right?"
"3803550","3809890"," And we had lower to 400, and then we'd break out finally later in summer above the previous high"
"3809890","3810770"," set in January. "
"3811930","3817050"," And that's that, that's that, you know, that you're down, right?"
"3820490","3821430"," You're up, right?"
"3821910","3829630"," Down farther, up slightly, down farther, and then eventually you come back up to that last fall-off"
"3829630","3830170"," back here."
"3831130","3835130"," So anyways, the point to try to make is that we're all well-heads."
"3835310","3836670"," We all know that human gloom is coming. "
"3837490","3841990"," We know what the intent of puts are, and that's to hedge your long positions."
"3842370","3848190"," If you're long in Apple, if you're long in Tesla, any of those kinds of things, and so what"
"3848190","3851850"," they're, what the point, what the overarching point is they're trying to make."
"3852270","3853270"," They're just going to fill on that. "
"3853510","3854290"," I did get a fill."
"3854610","3854930"," All right."
"3855430","3857310"," So I got a fill now on Tesla. "
"3858730","3860290"," Bounce right back down below."
"3861010","3862650"," Let me look at bring Tesla here."
"3867470","3871530"," Tag right here at 45, then we'll see if this holds. "
"3872330","3876290"," If this doesn't hold, then we trade below this zone here."
"3877310","3881090"," You're going to want to ask yourself, where am I going to cut myself loose here?"
"3882930","3885050"," And that's a huge question, right?"
"3885490","3889850"," Where do I cut myself loose here if we continue to sell off on Tesla?"
"3890130","3894190"," Can we sell down, back down, and start this downward move or not?"
"3894930","3896230"," Is the big question, right?"
"3896950","3900290"," So I don't want to put this on a better time frame here for you."
"3900290","3907410"," And you've got, this is the 973s from yesterday. "
"3907890","3911970"," This would be a cashback or a cashback gap fill from yesterday, right?"
"3912170","3913870"," You're going to be wanting to pay attention to."
"3916540","3926510"," Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw this little chart"
"3926510","3926890"," here."
"3930980","3940000"," I'm going to give myself max pain to 10.30. So I'll cut these calls loose if we break 10 "
"3940000","3949770",".30. It would be my stops, right down there, 10.30. And why do I have stops here, 10.30?"
"3950710","3953530"," I'm going to ask why I have stops here, 10.30. I'm going to show you why. "
"3960390","3964050"," And while you see these buyers down here, I'll open up and get this closer."
"3965190","3965430"," Right there."
"3973550","3975910"," I'm going to see this last little line right here. "
"3978910","3981790"," And that's where liquidity ends on this dip-eye down below."
"3981790","3985250"," So 10.30, 10.50 to 10.30 is right down in here."
"3985750","3991610"," So if this liquidity breaks, we'll be heading down to 10.00 to 1.00. So I'm in long here"
"3991610","3992010"," on Tesla. "
"3995720","3996600"," Close this up."
"4000840","4003540"," I'm going to take a look at Spy real quick to confirm."
"4011330","4021860"," And we're not quite down to this 4.44.5 yet, but at the same time, at"
"4021860","4023720"," the same time, I don't think we go that low. "
"4024640","4027400"," Don't think we get down to 4.45. That's possible."
"4027700","4028860"," It's possible we could trade down here."
"4029800","4031060"," That will trade down here. "
"4031740","4032320"," That's possible."
"4033460","4036580"," I'm going to probably add some Spy calls as well down here."
"4036680","4127890"," We actually get down to this 4.45. And"
"4127890","4137430"," so Spy came as a point that they're trying to make to you is that you could see a roll"
"4137430","4138410"," over in the market. "
"4138569","4139830"," Let's clear this."
"4140109","4142109"," We've got FMC and May 4th over here, right?"
"4142870","4151729"," You could see a sideways trader or a roll, but not the 420 down here that you're looking for"
"4151729","4155050"," and not the 400 down below here."
"4155229","4158649"," So this would be something to change the color. "
"4158649","4159950"," And that's like red or something."
"4161510","4162890"," The nasty color red."
"4163990","4165090"," Not a pretty red. "
"4168800","4169899"," Change that to red."
"4175189","4177450"," This is where the implication is, right?"
"4177569","4184630"," This is where the hedging is for is that we come down here and we do to FMC."
"4185109","4186410"," Not the minutes, but the FMC. "
"4188710","4190910"," Well, there's so many hedges down here."
"4191550","4198440"," They're implying that we're not going to get down there unless maybe there was something that we"
"4198440","4199300"," heard that we didn't know."
"4202440","4207920"," And so then their implication is going to be that rather than that happening, you're going to see"
"4207920","4214920"," at worst you'll see sideways the down trade. "
"4215140","4215600"," That's at worst."
"4215600","4223100"," Not guaranteed, but that in all actuality, you'll see a move higher into that FMC meeting."
"4224780","4226020"," Now that we're hedged, right?"
"4226120","4227060"," They end up buying the market. "
"4227060","4227800"," Now that we're hedged."
"4227820","4232740"," The other problem with it too is they don't want to monetize these puts down here unless you get"
"4232740","4233320"," new buyers."
"4233860","4238240"," So if everybody's already bought these and we don't have anyone else to replace the original"
"4238240","4242480"," buyers, then we won't actually revisit these numbers down here. "
"4243160","4244540"," So that's a concern, right?"
"4244540","4248900"," They won't actually get down here and all these puts will expire worthless."
"4250340","4253040"," So that becomes a question into FMC."
"4254600","4258320"," Do we trade this zone here?"
"4259660","4260560"," Clear this out. "
"4261700","4263660"," Do we trade this zone here, right?"
"4263960","4267660"," Maybe even slightly higher, right?"
"4267820","4273800"," Or even just trade this zone, maybe even slightly lower into FMC, but regardless if the implication"
"4273800","4277880"," is that regardless of what we trade in here, if the implication is that we're going to trade down"
"4277880","4282980"," to 4,000 and we never get there, that we can put on a 5% rally, which is pretty,"
"4282980","4283720"," pretty large."
"4284480","4291340"," Now if enough people know this before then, or if we get any kind of headline news, it would add"
"4291340","4292920"," even more fuel to that fire."
"4293840","4294880"," Something that's unknown. "
"4295140","4300300"," I don't think that we can actually trade to 470 without some form of headline news, even if we do"
"4300300","4301140"," trade that high."
"4301920","4307320"," But you can already see, you can already see here that we did in about face, right?"
"4308440","4311420"," From that path of heading down towards FMC."
"4312420","4315900"," So there's already been a, the market's already being bought. "
"4316120","4323160"," And also someone made note on Twitter this morning that the breadth indicator picked up on ES."
"4323860","4324660"," On ES."
"4325200","4330440"," I'll show you that later this morning that there's been buying, active buying of the markets when"
"4330440","4334760"," we should be trading sideways or even down towards that 4,000. "
"4335600","4341440"," So it's kind of putting a damper on the idea that we trade down that low at this point."
"4342020","4344840"," So that does that mean that you close your hedging down to 4,000?"
"4345020","4346160"," No, you kind of have to leave it on."
"4346160","4351700"," For 90 seconds, the weekly, that's because inventory data expected between plus 33 and 35 billing"
"4351700","4351960"," to defeat. "
"4353620","4358640"," You kind of have to leave that hedging on for that risk down below, right?"
"4359140","4363200"," In case we ever do get down there, if there's something that does happen, if let's say they"
"4363200","4369060"," announced a cease fire for some talks, it looks like Don Boss and Maripole."
"4369240","4369800"," Is it Maripole?"
"4369960","4374080"," I think there looks like there's something going on in the background there."
"4374160","4377760"," But if those are to fall apart, we could, you know, we could get a quick rip and then a"
"4377760","4379180"," dump down to 4,000. "
"4379760","4384060"," Or you have to roll your hedging out even farther to the minutes, the FMC minutes."
"4385260","4390100"," But we've also noticed that the breadth indicator is picking steam up once again."
"4391520","4396840"," And if too many people know, this is the last part of this, is that if too many people know"
"4396840","4403820"," that we should be trading up super high, 460, 470, that they will try to front run this trade now"
"4403820","4407920"," rather than, rather than later. "
"4408380","4410540"," And we've seen examples of that in the past."
"4411400","4417120"," We have seen some of those examples where we haven't actually sold off."
"4417340","4418800"," And you can see one of them right here. "
"4419840","4421220"," That's a weekly in Africa."
"4421440","4423020"," It's inventory data in just a few seconds."
"4423240","4426700"," Rather than us saying, no, we're going to roll over right here and we don't. "
"4426780","4428300"," We just start grinding higher."
"4429440","4431480"," We have a brief sell off here."
"4431480","4432620"," This would be like right now. "
"4432620","4435360"," If we continue higher, basically."
"4435600","4437760"," Plus 53 bill and give the plus 53."
"4438340","4443000"," Well, about the plus 33 to 35 expected range above the five year average for the week. "
"4444600","4445780"," We're going to talk about this."
"4445860","4447480"," The original adjustments and the data."
"4448240","4449340"," The UNG. "
"4457100","4458020"," Just move."
"4460880","4462980"," Quick sell off on natural gas."
"4469620","4478300"," U.S. natural gas inventories plus 53 B.C.F. versus plus 33 B.C.F. Two plus 35 B "
"4478300","4479340",".C.F. indicated range. "
"4480000","4486380"," No regional adjustments working gas in storage was 1550 B.C.F. As of Friday, April 15."
"4486880","4492560"," According to EIS, this represents an increase of 53 B.C.F. from the previous week."
"4493220","4497560"," Stocks were 428 B.C.F. less than last year at this time. "
"4497560","4502420"," And 292 B.C.F. full of five year average of 1742."
"4503680","4506320"," Total working gas within five year historical range."
"4507840","4510540"," It's a little bit more than we want right now in natural gas. "
"4510720","4512540"," Quick sell off in UNG."
"4528250","4532620"," So with that being said, right, for where we are."
"4532800","4534260"," Look where we are on the. "
"4535920","4537660"," It's on a six month chart here."
"4539120","4542280"," And it's not like we've even really gone up, right?"
"4542560","4543300"," A whole ton."
"4543640","4546520"," So the question becomes, do we just start ramping now?"
"4547060","4550500"," Or do we slow trade sideways and slightly down, but not hit that?"
"4550840","4553740"," That bear target of 4,000 or 420. "
"4554600","4559920"," That retest down below here, 420 or 410 or even 400."
"4560580","4564620"," So if you have the thesis of, well, we can get down to 400."
"4564620","4566980"," I think that's a valid thesis. "
"4568400","4575760"," But it's the point being is that if you're hedged for it, you should be able to buy the market."
"4576560","4581180"," If you want to get aggressive with the thesis, like it's happening."
"4582040","4585620"," That it's a matter of positioning and this might not be the best positioning. "
"4586120","4588900"," So rather than just a head, so you have hedging flow and then put flow."
"4589660","4591400"," You have your hedge on."
"4591840","4597780"," The put flow might not actually come until farther down the road more towards the FOMC minutes"
"4597780","4599400"," where you actually see that realization. "
"4600500","4605580"," And you'd want to, of course, buy those puts when they're dirt fucking cheap to add to those hedges"
"4605580","4609700"," or roll your hedges out to a later date at some point."
"4610100","4613820"," I don't know that the rolling of the hedges that I roll at a further date is going to do"
"4613820","4618880"," better for where you are currently maybe it's down lower at 440 or something for the hedge on this"
"4618880","4621660"," event or the OPEC's on May 20th."
"4623300","4628360"," But a target for after FOMC minutes probably puts it another month and a half, two months out. "
"4630200","4635520"," For that hit on or that tag we're looking for in 400."
"4636080","4637640"," So just be conscious of that."
"4638100","4639460"," Does it mean you close your puts?"
"4640120","4640200"," No. "
"4640880","4642540"," Does it mean that you don't buy?"
"4643040","4646940"," If you don't have any hedging that you don't buy hedging, no, I agree with hedging here."
"4646940","4650220"," I think it's important to have hedging here on this market."
"4650460","4657040"," I think that 400 or 4000 is still on the table, but it does make you have to have to"
"4657040","4664580"," look at your thesis and say, is it guaranteed that we're heading down to 4000 now or in the next"
"4664580","4665720"," 15 days or so?"
"4665980","4668460"," And you might think like, hey, this is our time-wise. "
"4668940","4673380"," If you start looking at the time on this, right, we're on the 21st already."
"4673660","4675160"," FOMC is the fourth and fifth."
"4676720","4681960"," It would mean nothing to see us trade sideways or even up to 460. "
"4682740","4685840"," And then you blast off to 470 this last week right here."
"4686040","4690040"," 4, 460 to 470 in this zone here."
"4690400","4691340"," So you're the only talking. "
"4691540","4694000"," I bought calls out to the second."
"4694900","4703720"," But dude, if you start looking at, if you start, I should be buying 470s now for the seventh,"
"4704620","4713360"," the seventh, maybe the ninth or somewhere in there, like the ninth or even the 12th, maybe even the"
"4713360","4717060"," 14th, but 470s up in here is not out of their own possibility."
"4718000","4719120"," And they're cheap. "
"4719380","4725440"," I mean, you're talking, I think the May 2nd, I bought yesterday for a pre-sense or something, 470s"
"4725440","4729000"," for May 2nd."
"4729000","4730760"," I know that sounds insane."
"4731300","4733340"," Maybe like, yeah, there's no way we get to 470. "
"4734180","4736740"," I think they might burn too at some point."
"4736860","4741560"," But let's talk about how high can you actually go in nine days or so."
"4742000","4750340"," I mean, let's look at some fearless rallies. "
"4750660","4756000"," We went from 50 to 70 in one, two, three days."
"4756000","4761400"," Washington DC, some Democrats putting forward a bill that would require the FTC to probe gasoline"
"4761400","4762160"," prices."
"4763660","4771660"," From October 13th to November 4th, we went out, what?"
"4772620","4773960"," 430 to 470. "
"4774660","4775660"," That's 400 points."
"4776960","4779680"," So to think that we can't, I mean, look at this bump right here."
"4780600","4783600"," December 20th to December 27th, seven days. "
"4784480","4786540"," We went up 300, right?"
"4787280","4793720"," So to think for a minute that we can't rip at some point and we have 15 days, right, that"
"4793720","4797180"," we could rip this in 15 days is not out of the question."
"4798280","4799600"," Absolutely not out of the question."
"4799600","4803480"," We could just grind up there from now for the next 15 days and hit that 470. "
"4804240","4806380"," So just be conscious of that as we move forward."
"4806880","4809280"," I was talking about this since April 14th."
"4809280","4815120"," If you check my Twitter, I talked about or wrote about now that we're all on the bear. "
"4815260","4823580"," So it's interesting because if you look at the, at the past few months, right, we talked about tail"
"4823580","4824220"," risk, right?"
"4824380","4829660"," Back here in December, January, remember we were talking about tail risk in the market and they"
"4829660","4832120"," have unexpected things happen in the market."
"4832340","4837420"," So maybe you buy some fucking puts that are way outside the money or put back spreads that are way"
"4837420","4838060"," outside the money."
"4838060","4845040"," And now that we're actually heading down towards those numbers, I posted, I think on April 14th, I"
"4845040","4847520"," wrote a bull tail risk or something on Twitter. "
"4847680","4849200"," You can find the tweet."
"4850400","4851940"," And I said, you know, we're coming to it."
"4852020","4853160"," I think it was, it was right here. "
"4855200","4857460"," As a matter of fact, it was, it was like end of the day."
"4857900","4861280"," We were right down in here and I said, I said, you know what?"
"4861480","4865800"," I said, I said, just the inverse of that trade, right?"
"4865800","4868280"," Just the inverse of that, of that."
"4868440","4873060"," We're at the top of the market in January when you're talking about that tail risk trade heading"
"4873060","4881060"," down that we should start to consider a bull tail risk, a bull like, you know, if we're all, if"
"4881060","4885500"," we, if everybody, including me, you and your sister and the barber knows that we're going to 400 or"
"4885500","4890640"," 4000 or 420 at FOMC, what"
"4890640","4896560"," if we fucking don't want to go back and go back and go back and go back to those calls"
"4896560","4900480"," and fucking nobody does. "
"4900960","4907520"," Like nobody fucking owns for 60s, for 70s, like the next couple weeks, they just don't own them."
"4907920","4909280"," They're, they're fucking worthless."
"4909900","4911540"," They, they, they cost nothing. "
"4912700","4918180"," And that's, and that's pretty much when you look back, when you look back on January, way back"
"4918180","4919600"," here, we go back much farther."
"4923290","4928110"," When you go back in December and up in this, this area here, you know, to, to buy like a"
"4928110","4932910"," 400c would cost probably, probably couldn't even, probably couldn't have been bid on."
"4933030","4934530"," It's probably a penny, one penny or less. "
"4935410","4935610"," Right?"
"4935890","4940990"," He thought, I wonder what, like 400s cost down here at 410."
"4941390","4945890"," Like when you, when we were back up here, right, they were worthless because nobody thought we were"
"4945890","4950770"," going down to 400 into the start of the year."
"4950870","4951390"," Not that deep. "
"4951550","4953530"," We knew we'd sell off, but not that deep, right?"
"4954250","4955230"," And so that's our point."
"4955410","4957730"," We all know that we're going down to 400 down here."
"4958010","4964570"," If we all know we're going down here and if puts our fucking super, super, super expensive, and"
"4964570","4968510"," let's say, let's say buy a put for a dollar and you can buy 470 calls for one penny. "
"4969370","4975030"," It makes it, it's absolutely illogical for you to not say I'm going to buy a dollar put, but I'm"
"4975030","4975670"," not going to add it."
"4975670","4979210"," I'm going to throw another penny call on the fire."
"4979530","4985770"," If you don't think you can buy a dollar put and not get another 20, 50, 75 or a dollar"
"4985770","4987610"," out of that put, right?"
"4987870","4993290"," When you're placing that bet and buying a put for a dollar, I know that your expectations are, I'm"
"4993290","4996350"," going to make 10, 20, 30, 50, 100% on it. "
"4996730","5003170"," And if there are one penny or two or three penny calls that are, they're at 470, 460 or whatever,"
"5003610","5008850"," then maybe you should start buying some of those way the fuck out of the money calls as a bull"
"5008850","5010690"," tail risk trade."
"5012270","5014270"," Now, my dating is probably wrong."
"5014510","5016110"," My dates I put my second on. "
"5017330","5023050"," Spock ever saying, now you should maybe push those out a little bit to first week of May, second"
"5023050","5024510"," week of May that we can get up there."
"5025130","5026270"," And they didn't give a price either."
"5027590","5032910"," So that's what, that's my, my thought process is on this is that we might have some tail risk here. "
"5035230","5037390"," So we'll see, we'll see if we get that tail risk."
"5037490","5040190"," If that trade works itself out, you just hold them."
"5040830","5042170"," And if they print, they print. "
"5042410","5043270"," If they burn, they burn."
"5043510","5049030"," If you make a hundred percent, if the trade goes from three cents to six cents or one penny to"
"5049030","5055030"," two pennies, you've made your hundred percent, you paid, you paid, you made good money better than"
"5055030","5056210"," s hitting 400."
"5057390","5061570"," So those tell that tail risk trade higher is on the menu. "
"5061570","5063310"," There are more people talking about it."
"5063530","5066350"," It's part of the, part of the bull count for Elliott Wavers."
"5067150","5072390"," Just be conscious of it and aware of it as time passes. "
"5073050","5076050"," It's kind of fucking around here on, on Tesla."
"5076630","5080650"," Quick bounce down below at 10.50. We'll see if we retest this a couple times."
"5081130","5083930"," I wouldn't expect anything less than a couple tests and then I move higher. "
"5084770","5086250"," And we'll see if we get that move higher."
"5101030","5104920"," Yeah, I see a lot of talk on social media."
"5105580","5110820"," People are pumped up on, people are pumped up on TGT. "
"5114730","5116470"," Let's say I want Netflix really quick."
"5120600","5122340"," The bloodbath that's Netflix."
"5125200","5127120"," Or the shit show that's Netflix. "
"5142060","5143380"," Let's start with Netflix."
"5143380","5147520"," Let's start with Netflix back up here."
"5148980","5156480"," So I think, so I've seen a few very smart people, not just one, but some very smart people talking"
"5156480","5159920"," about Netflix, a counter trade and Netflix. "
"5160400","5166440"," And I think the point they're trying to make is, I could be wrong in this, but you get 700"
"5166440","5167220"," up here, right?"
"5168180","5170480"," If you like that at 700, you're going to like it at 400."
"5170820","5172260"," Now you're going to like it at 212, right?"
"5173980","5178540"," And I think even, I think the one person even said sell the whole."
"5180920","5183360"," And people are saying it's going to go to zero, right?"
"5186040","5189400"," There's a bunch of thought processes in this. "
"5189620","5195880"," Now yesterday I talked to you about how you get plain profit-taking, right?"
"5196640","5197920"," Plain old profit-taking."
"5198640","5205460"," And a bank will look for an excuse when they want to take profit for some bad news."
"5206780","5210040"," I think 686 noted this too. "
"5210340","5215880"," I wonder who's selling, his comment was, I wonder who's selling the script today, right?"
"5216320","5221980"," On the downgrades and on Ackman selling and all the other noise."
"5222620","5232360"," And I think 686's point this morning was, who has the motivation to sell the story that Netflix"
"5232360","5233540"," is going to zero?"
"5234880","5239200"," And I can, we can show you who has the motivation to say that Netflix is going to zero."
"5239660","5243480"," And usually it's a bank that wants to buy it at the price they wanted at. "
"5244420","5246320"," And they've taken profit already, right?"
"5246600","5252380"," So that's the point behind, you might, this might be your favorite stock in the world and you might"
"5252380","5256580"," say it never goes to zero or to get sold the fuck off."
"5257320","5261560"," And you might eat, you might eat drink the Kool-Aid or eat the popcorn when it goes up and"
"5261560","5262900"," say it's going up for this reason."
"5262900","5268420"," And you might eat drink the Kool-Aid popcorn for when it's going down for the reasons that are sold"
"5268420","5270780"," to you in the general public. "
"5271000","5276260"," But the reality is, I think I got cut off yesterday in this cup part of the conversation we were"
"5276260","5276800"," having this conversation."
"5277620","5284640"," It has more to do with, at this point, the price that someone else with much deeper pockets than"
"5284640","5286400"," retail wants to pay for this."
"5288540","5297620"," And the fascinating part of these trades are that you start to look at where they got in, right?"
"5299260","5301940"," And you have this original buy-in here. "
"5302180","5303440"," We have 128 down here."
"5303860","5306440"," And you have this original buy-in buy-banks."
"5307760","5312360"," And let's say this was, let's just say as an example, this was JP Morgan down here, right?"
"5313080","5314760"," And they pushed this up, right?"
"5315980","5319600"," And then you have a firm that runs good PR. "
"5321910","5324830"," And some smaller banks or mid-sized banks get in, right?"
"5324950","5326390"," They run it up, take some profit, right?"
"5326970","5329810"," And JPM still holding the line down here, right?"
"5331490","5336510"," And then they launched another PR campaign and some more mid-sized banks come in, right?"
"5336690","5338850"," They sell it off, take the money and run, right?"
"5339150","5340550"," So same kind of thing, pump it up, right?"
"5340830","5341790"," Sell it off, comes down."
"5342530","5345010"," And then you get some bag holders that are mid-sized banks."
"5345010","5346910"," So now you've got JPM running PR. "
"5347450","5350850"," You've got a mid-sized bank running, or a mid-sized bank running PR."
"5351430","5353910"," You start to get retail all fired up in here."
"5354490","5356630"," And you're running it up, right?"
"5357590","5362330"," And these banks are actually in down low, 185, 128, somewhere in this. "
"5362490","5364370"," They've been accumulating this, right?"
"5364690","5365810"," And they run this all the way up."
"5367630","5369090"," They run this all the way up."
"5371520","5372560"," And they start taking profit. "
"5372820","5374180"," They take profit at 700, right?"
"5375440","5376860"," And they drop the market out."
"5377000","5378480"," Plus you've got some really shitty news."
"5378620","5382300"," I'm not going to deny that the Netflix news was not utterly fucking shitty. "
"5383560","5385320"," You can see some distribution in it."
"5385440","5387380"," Well, I guess it calls accumulation for one more rip or higher."
"5388280","5390680"," But you do have some really shitty news in here. "
"5391440","5398100"," And now the question becomes, where does JPM, if it was JPM or GS, where did they want to buy"
"5398100","5398280"," it?"
"5398880","5401120"," So they have to run really negative stories."
"5402020","5403920"," They have to downgrade really bad stories."
"5403920","5406780"," To get it to where they can buy back in again. "
"5407260","5413100"," And so I don't think that their conversation this morning was about how bad Netflix was."
"5413680","5421180"," The question becomes, where should Netflix be for the accumulation to start once again?"
"5421820","5425620"," And because what will happen is this, is you'll see a moment where it gets bought."
"5426440","5429760"," And then you'll see a new accumulation phase, right?"
"5430480","5433960"," And then you'll start to see some good news come out on Netflix. "
"5433960","5437540"," You'll start to see good news stories."
"5438060","5439360"," It's always something, right?"
"5439920","5442140"," And they'll bring out more good news."
"5442540","5444240"," And before you know it, it's back up here again. "
"5445060","5446780"," And you kind of missed the entire trade."
"5447520","5453520"," And some of the time horizons for these guys is a long, much longer than your time horizon is."
"5454040","5455400"," So they just buy it cheap. "
"5455800","5456200"," They do."
"5456620","5458620"," And they're not going to tell you that they're buying it."
"5458620","5461180"," They're not going to tell you that they're accumulating it. "
"5461780","5465940"," They're going to, they're going to accumulate it for, you know, six months, a year."
"5466240","5468740"," And then they'll run a program on that."
"5468920","5469180"," On that. "
"5469360","5475020"," Global bond yields accelerating now to the upside, the U.S. 10 year back above two point or trading"
"5475020","5477760"," towards 2.9 to 3%."
"5477760","5484460"," That UK 10 year guilt yields are past 2% going highest level going back to 2015."
"5484540","5487380"," And the German 10 year yield is up. "
"5487380","5489500"," What happened to the U.S. points?"
"5490560","5492060"," We might look at the top of the hour."
"5492280","5497360"," We could hear from U.S. Fed Chairman Powell is expected to have two appearances today, one or 11 o "
"5497360","5498520","'clock at a conference."
"5499380","5501680"," And then later is going to be on an IMF panel. "
"5502460","5505520"," 11 o'clock is only introductory remarks."
"5506540","5508680"," Markets are eagerly waiting here from Powell."
"5508900","5513380"," There's been some sometimes since we've heard from him specifically on the economy and monetary"
"5513380","5514080"," policy. "
"5514920","5516380"," My price target was one 16."
"5516380","5519980"," The market does expect a 50 basis point hike in May."
"5523010","5524750"," So I think the NFL. "
"5525030","5532730"," So I think that the point on NFL X is, though you're hearing, though right now you're hearing the"
"5532730","5539010"," story of sell Netflix, sell Netflix, sell Netflix, it becomes a stock for you to watch, right?"
"5540730","5543230"," And what is the price you're willing to pay for it?"
"5544110","5550670"," Rather than listening to everyone be so, you know, so negative on Netflix, you call last time we"
"5550670","5556970"," heard from Chairman Powell was back on the 21st of March where one asked about a 50 basis point"
"5556970","5563070"," hike at the time he said, nothing would prevent a 50 basis point hike at the May meeting."
"5566130","5566610"," Yeah."
"5566710","5572270"," So it's always that the interviewing later on his speeches, like he ties his talk and then you"
"5572270","5578940"," like, you stop paying attention to it and then like fucking half an hour later, half an hour, like"
"5578940","5583240"," half an hour into the conversation, someone gets up and starts asking all the fucked up questions"
"5583240","5584600"," and then the market that tanks. "
"5585560","5588340"," So their point to you is down here."
"5589180","5591220"," You've got, you know, 100 bucks, flat 100 bucks."
"5591320","5592580"," You got 140 and 185. "
"5594420","5595960"," The trade was up here, right?"
"5596180","5599100"," The trade to sell was up here, right?"
"5599640","5600140"," And right here."
"5600500","5601100"," And right here."
"5601840","5603080"," And further down here. "
"5603200","5605660"," But now they were down this deep into Netflix."
"5605660","5611640"," Their point is that you start looking for a place to buy Netflix."
"5612360","5617080"," You start looking for some entries down here for accumulation. "
"5618420","5624000"," Even if you're holding for one to three years, you start looking for somewhere to buy here."
"5624940","5625040"," Okay."
"5625760","5628820"," And that, as a matter of fact, if you look at the company like Apple and you look at a"
"5628820","5633860"," company like Facebook and Netflix, you are going to be looking for entry somewhere in this"
"5633860","5634200"," vicinity. "
"5634880","5641620"," So when you're hearing the worst, the cacophony of negative news on Netflix, keep your eyes down in"
"5641620","5643800"," here because all you need is Netflix couple of solutions."
"5645880","5647200"," All you need is Netflix."
"5647400","5649180"," All you need is a Ukraine announcement to come out. "
"5650620","5656760"," Where there's a, where there's a, where a rush where the Netflix is on in Asia again."
"5657580","5658440"," Netflix is on in Russia."
"5659580","5663260"," They have found a solution to a payment structure. "
"5663680","5664800"," Any of that kind of shit."
"5665600","5671600"," And if the news is carried by a backer like JPM or GS or something like that, you'll see a"
"5671600","5673760"," snapback rally on Netflix."
"5675600","5678320"," So just keep your eyes on this as we trade around there. "
"5678860","5681700"," Do I think we can get as low as 100, 142, 185?"
"5682640","5682860"," I do."
"5683240","5686720"," I think we can get down here once, twice, maybe even three times."
"5686880","5691820"," If you set some alerts on all three, if you were like, Hey, I want to buy my kids some"
"5691820","5693700"," Netflix Netflix stock. "
"5694580","5696500"," And you said, I've got 10 grand."
"5696700","5698720"," I'd say, you know, did the same thing, right?"
"5698900","5699560"," Dollar cost average."
"5700060","5702560"," You buy 10 to 20% at 185 bucks. "
"5703160","5708840"," You buy another 30, 40% at $142 and you buy like 60% at 100 bucks."
"5709780","5712900"," You then average in it like 130, 140 somewhere in there."
"5713680","5715600"," And you hold it for five, 10 years. "
"5716600","5718000"," I don't think Netflix is going anywhere."
"5718000","5720680"," I don't think Netflix is getting bought by anybody."
"5720680","5724160"," I think if anything, Netflix will be buying somebody. "
"5724600","5732660"," And then even though I have real problems with Netflix right now, as they grow their book over a"
"5732660","5738680"," decade or two, they will one day be a powerhouse like TV stations once were."
"5739180","5745220"," If they can accumulate enough programs like Stranger Things, actually they're good programs and"
"5745220","5750660"," they roll those out over, if they develop those over, not that specific show, but shows that are"
"5750660","5756820"," that quality over five, 10 years and add that to their catalog."
"5757460","5761720"," When they start to revamp those shows, when you're an old guy and you're your kids, if you're young"
"5761720","5767800"," right now, let's say 25 years old and you see a reboot of Stranger Things in five, 10 years, you"
"5767800","5771360"," will see Netflix as a powerhouse once again. "
"5771780","5776480"," And this is probably a good opportunity for you to own it at $125."
"5778020","5779940"," And Netflix has done this before."
"5780240","5786480"," This is not the first time that Netflix, I think 2004, they had a huge sell-off to speak conscience"
"5786480","5786980"," of this. "
"5787380","5789000"," He's all these doom and gloom statements."
"5789720","5792620"," That's probably a good entry point in here for Netflix."
"5793700","5795300"," And you know, same thing goes with Facebook. "
"5795940","5798580"," If Apple does this at any point, same thing goes for Amazon."
"5798900","5805180"," If that happens at any point, every time Tesla sells off, it's more of an opportunity than it is"
"5805180","5806760"," than I don't buy it."
"5806900","5812460"," How many times anybody in Tesla fans out there can attest to how many times there have been massive"
"5812460","5818960"," fucking sell-offs and you're the only guy in the room saying, hey, you should buy it now. "
"5819440","5825680"," I can't tell you how many times I've been told, you're fucking crazy buying dips like this."
"5825920","5831700"," And this is, I'd rather own Netflix at $100 than at $700 any day of the week."
"5832220","5838860"," So just keep on your radar, keep Netflix on your radar, set some alerts as it trades lower to build"
"5838860","5841160"," a position in Netflix. "
"5841960","5844680"," And you do have some, our headwinds ahead for Netflix."
"5845580","5849420"," If they fire their entire fucking PR team, it's not a hard fix."
"5849760","5854020"," If they fix how they charge people in structure payments, not a hard fix. "
"5854520","5862200"," If they're able to build their catalogs for foreign states and refocus if they apologize to the"
"5862200","5865100"," American people, that's not a hard fix."
"5865560","5866860"," They have some easy fixes."
"5867540","5873520"," If they're able to buy some other catalogs, let's say Paramount or something like that, it will"
"5873520","5875820"," begin to help Netflix succeed. "
"5876400","5881440"," And not only that, but you'll hear a bank be buying in the background while they're telling you"
"5881440","5882200"," Netflix sucks."
"5884280","5891120"," I think people think that banks buy these stocks when they're going up, you're like, yeah, JPM's"
"5891120","5891720"," buying this."
"5892500","5895280"," In reality, it's more like Bill Ackman buying it. "
"5895920","5903960"," In reality, like the big boys, they're the ones that can take hits down here for these long trades,"
"5904540","5908560"," They'll buy these and hold these for six months a year and buy them when they're in the fucking"
"5908560","5909160"," dumpster."
"5909860","5911280"," Now there's no fraud with Netflix."
"5911660","5915760"," There's nothing in the behind the scenes that says it's not going to become Blockbuster. "
"5915760","5917020"," There's no replacement."
"5917400","5922280"," If they announced something tomorrow, if Netflix came out tomorrow and said, yeah, we're launching"
"5922280","5925060"," our own YouTube, the fucking stock would go through the fucking moon."
"5925500","5927320"," It'd go through the fucking moon. "
"5928160","5934180"," So just keep that in mind if they offer different services or evolve, I would expect Netflix to"
"5934180","5935160"," evolve over time."
"5935580","5940220"," If they were to start adding video games or some kind of nonsense like that, VR, any of those"
"5940220","5945440"," things that they could be developing in the background for the future, the stock's going to fucking"
"5945440","5945780"," moon."
"5946600","5950280"," It'll blast off to 300 points just on some kind of stupid news like that. "
"5951120","5954560"," So just keep an eye on Netflix as time goes by."
"5954980","5956640"," Take a look at Spy right now."
"5960660","5961720"," Look at that mess. "

"6594740","6598760"," He normally waits until the next speech. "
"6604400","6605900"," It's usually pretty bland."
"6605900","6609560"," The next speech is usually pretty bullish or dovish."
"6609840","6613160"," Then when the questions come, that's where he gets fucking hawkish. "
"6615720","6621120"," Oftentimes it's almost like an earnings report where you get the CEO will say something nice."
"6622080","6626660"," Then you get one asshole that knows what he's talking about asking all the important questions."
"6627920","6632140"," That guy or woman or whatever is usually the last person allowed to ask a question. "
"6633260","6636980"," We'll do really just pay attention to the 1PM speech."
"6637680","6646160"," The 1PM speech is going to be where the first, usually the first 15-20 minutes are good, or they're"
"6646160","6646840"," dovish."
"6647300","6650180"," They're in line with what's being already public. "
"6651280","6653360"," It'll always be one."
"6653620","6655940"," The last reporter will start to ask the hard questions."
"6657120","6661840"," You'll be long the market and the market will be going up and then out of fucking nowhere they ask. "
"6662220","6664800"," They throw the big fucking rubber dildo in there."
"6665660","6669200"," He always folds under those circumstances."
"6669580","6670600"," He'll fold under. "
"6673000","6676940"," He's a great prepared remarks speaker."
"6678020","6680320"," He's great with the softball questions."
"6681080","6686100"," There's someone always at the end that asks like, always ask something you can't get out of. "
"6688240","6693960"," It's usually simplified and he'll turn around and write on you and fucking bite a bull right in the"
"6693960","6694500"," fucking hand."
"6695360","6698360"," So admit to something."
"6698820","6701560"," Of course that says, well, we don't know. "
"6701780","6708300"," I would bet today if the question they're going to ask is something a trigger about recession."
"6709300","6712820"," Like, you know, the Fed can't actually stop a recession or something."
"6712960","6713580"," Would you agree with that?"
"6713800","6717200"," Of course, he will say something like, yeah, I agree with that. "
"6717440","6720500"," We have no control over the recession or something nonsense like that."
"6721200","6722700"," And then we'll still have a fuck off."
"6727480","6731500"," So Moody's is Andy speaking at the Volker Institute of Dancing. "
"6731800","6737520"," The most likely spare for the next 12 months is that we enter a self-staining economic expansion."
"6742550","6748190"," So Volker, Fed Chair Powell stated that Volker understood the role played by price expectations."
"6749690","6751730"," Understood the importance of Fed independence. "
"6754580","6756200"," And he's saying it won't be a soft landing."
"6756220","6757880"," It will be a little bumpy and ugly."
"6768270","6773090"," Moody's Zandy is saying the most likely spare for the next 12 months is that we enter a self "
"6773090","6775130","-staining economic expansion. "
"6776130","6778230"," I would take that as being dovish."
"6800750","6809290"," I would, I would note on that that he's also an author."
"6809670","6815230"," Mark Zandy is an author of a book about the economic expansion of the United, of our economy. "
"6818330","6819830"," And it's titled."
"6822770","6828490"," See, paying the price ending the Great Recession and beginning a new American century."
"6829710","6833270"," It's just be conscious that this guy is a modern monetary theorist. "
"6862370","6863450"," Market slow."
"6881850","6887970"," 1030 down below here kind of matches up with the spy at 445."
"6904460","6905920"," Yeah, be careful of this. "
"6906140","6907960"," Zandy is going to be he's ultra bull."
"6913870","6918590"," I wonder when we confirm that we aren't going back to 450 today."
"6919230","6921170"," I think we are going back to 450. "
"6933210","6934130"," It's someone right."
"6934550","6937190"," Oh, Jess wrote intent and vigor."
"6937530","6938570"," High approach foreplay. "
"6938670","6939610"," I thought Jess wrote."
"6940530","6946630"," We're thoughts from Moody's Zandy saying that recession risk is still high about one in three in"
"6946630","6947490"," the next 12 months."
"6948030","6950790"," Largely due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine says Andy. "
"6973470","6974390"," Yeah, the news guy."
"6974790","6976710"," I'll show you where you get the news guy going."
"6993410","6996990"," Yeah, the news guy that's talking in the background that's trade the news. "
"6998130","7000210"," It's a 350 a month."
"7000710","7001250"," Something like that."
"7001910","7003230"," 350 400 a month. "
"7007940","7009360"," That's in response to."
"7011460","7011980"," Josh."
"7012280","7019550"," Paul giving tribute to vulgar the king begging forgiveness. "
"7019750","7020550"," Paul is pathetic."
"7021070","7021550"," That's terrible."
"7024200","7025120"," He does the opposite of vulgar. "
"7025680","7025780"," Yeah."
"7026720","7027500"," I think though."
"7027760","7032220"," I guess the big question becomes. "
"7034740","7036180"," Yeah, please don't have zoom call."
"7036700","7040280"," You can register with the you can register for that zoom call and get in on it."
"7042730","7048890"," Yeah, that's all fucked up to how Joe the blaming the whole fate of all the politics kind of fucked"
"7048890","7049510"," up right now. "
"7052920","7054280"," I'm on calls here."
"7054400","7058420"," I'm on Tesla calls and I bought some more spy calls."
"7059160","7063100"," So I'm in calls right here and a month by calls that. "
"7064000","7067720"," Is it 10 or about 1100s, but hold on here."
"7068040","7068600"," I'll take a look."
"7069300","7070060"," So I've got a."
"7075640","7077050"," I started with Tesla calls. "
"7078930","7079970"," What's going on here?"
"7082450","7083330"," On the wrong."
"7085950","7087770"," It's a weirdness going on right now."
"7087770","7090990"," So I entered some Tesla calls right here. "
"7092310","7094610"," Or I was it was up here I think."
"7095830","7102370"," And I set a by down here somewhere and then filling down here somewhere."
"7105110","7113950"," Some of some Tesla calls and I just put some some I put some 450 C's on for spy. "
"7114730","7117830"," There's 90,000 spy call."
"7117990","7120350"," They went there on 450, 455s."
"7120410","7121470"," They went to 450s. "
"7123210","7125630"," Some high frequency trading term or whatever."
"7131570","7132850"," Treasury secretary."
"7134190","7138730"," You know, a treasury secretary yelling thing that cannot be business as usual for Russia to"
"7138730","7140530"," continue in international forms. "
"7152310","7152970"," Oh, fuck."
"7152970","7157370"," Yeah, I got I closed out for 50s and 460s."
"7158250","7164390"," For Friday expiry and I closed out Monday expiry as well. "
"7165010","7172690"," And then I left a bunch of 464 70s on into next week and into."
"7174470","7176790"," Early May, but I have to add."
"7177610","7179330"," I'm going to wind up adding. "
"7180190","7182130"," I'm going to wind up adding some calls."
"7182130","7187690"," So I'm going to get calls into the second of May."
"7188090","7190970"," I need to add some more for 70s. "
"7191730","7195990"," On the seventh and probably the ninth or whatever that."
"7197290","7198170"," They're dirty."
"7199010","7200690"," So they're fucking dirty. "
"7202350","7203850"," Had some for 70s for."
"7206190","7207750"," I've got so I've got to the second."
"7210550","7214070"," I need to add like the seventh, the 10th and the 14th. "
"7216690","7218130"," For 70s up in here."
"7219450","7221590"," I was thinking some for 80s."
"7221950","7228370"," I was thinking some for 80s for like the 14th and then I would sell them at for 70. "
"7230470","7232550"," Like for 80s for the 14th."
"7235850","7239850"," Maybe 4.75. For like the 14th."
"7239970","7241070"," Let's look and see what those costs. "
"7255120","7256860"," So I got a short week of that week too."
"7260460","7261420"," Maybe it's Labor Day."
"7265290","7267670"," Yeah, like 480s or like 8 cents. "
"7269530","7270830"," You don't need it to go to 480."
"7271170","7274130"," You just need it to go like 472."
"7274430","7275910"," You might actually might lose money in that trade. "
"7276130","7277630"," It might be too far outside the money."
"7278450","7287530"," But like maybe like 4.75s. What else is good is 4.78. Kind of in the realm slightly outside"
"7287530","7287970"," the money."
"7288130","7293490"," But 4.75. There's 17 cents for May 13th. "
"7305360","7308300"," Took at the May holiday calendars too."
"7318710","7320270"," So we'll see what we got out there."
"7326640","7328820"," Yeah, not much from early days, not until the 30th. "
"7331680","7333040"," So the 13th."
"7333560","7340400"," I have to head out to the 9th, the 13th for like for like."
"7343100","7344320"," It's not that you hold them. "
"7344340","7344920"," It's that you."
"7345840","7348060"," It's kind of like when you're at the bottom."
"7348420","7352640"," If you're a bear and you're like you hit that big bottom and you see a bunch of the call"
"7352640","7355680"," by or put buyers that buy another another. "
"7356320","7359340"," You know, 100 fucking handles down or some 20 handles down."
"7359640","7361520"," And you want to be able to sell those puts."
"7363080","7365120"," To those buyers. "
"7374520","7378540"," So I think I'm going to add some of those here in the coming coming days."
"7378600","7380540"," I'll probably end up adding those as we head into."
"7381960","7385720"," Into the actual FOMCL and to find a bunch of way outside the money calls. "
"7394940","7396740"," Still grinding on spy and Tesla."
"7397500","7400300"," See if this can hold or if we trade down to 445."
"7417030","7419090"," We need how he's super hawkish. "
"7419950","7420750"," Oh, Putin did invade."
"7421930","7423290"," I see you guys are saying."
"7433480","7435220"," I think we're assessing on Russia. "
"7435780","7439080"," Yeah, that whole thing Jill is kind of fucked up with blaming the recession on rougher."
"7439200","7443760"," It does a disservice to people that voted for Biden."
"7445440","7447900"," Blaming it on, blaming it on Russia is kind of whack. "
"7448740","7451580"," It doesn't do any favors as a Biden voter."
"7452780","7455540"," Because you don't want to be told, you don't want to be told stuff that you know is not the"
"7455540","7456220"," reason for."
"7456880","7458700"," And we all know why we have inflation. "
"7460720","7463790"," We all know."
"7465450","7467290"," Putin caused inflation last year."
"7469210","7471970"," But it is interesting right the war started back in February. "
"7473290","7474870"," You would expect some kind of."
"7477290","7480510"," Even if it's even just the truth is all you really need for headline."
"7489590","7492730"," I wish I'd approximately sell target on those 1100 C's. "
"7493510","7496190"," Time is a problem with those 1100 C's."
"7498410","7504000"," I guess the selling is still coming on down here."
"7504080","7506440"," And I got stops down below here below 10 below 10 30. "
"7507740","7508900"," What's my time on them?"
"7508900","7510580"," I'm just looking for a kick."
"7512910","7516670"," I'm looking for a revisit above here right around this 1100 like the sea."
"7519280","7521760"," I like to see some kind of another touch above. "
"7524000","7525800"," At least once and then twice."
"7526780","7528880"," So you can grab this run up higher."
"7531540","7536100"," And if the if if I get stopped out of this trade if we don't do this like swoop up"
"7536100","7537220"," in that second test. "
"7537220","7542100"," If we get stopped out of this trade of course I'll look for another buy down below here."
"7542600","7544400"," Whether it's today tomorrow doesn't matter."
"7549240","7553620"," We're about 10 minutes now that the European cash equity close and we're seeing some pressure in us"
"7553620","7554700"," equity markets is. "
"7555720","7558340"," Give back about half of the days gains."
"7559660","7560520"," Thus far."
"7562430","7566730"," The capron is up 1.4% heading into the close the taxes of 1%. "
"7566730","7569210"," But also have moved off of session highs."
"7570630","7575870"," Almost there to get back in equities has come alongside a continued rise in global treasury yields."
"7576290","7577350"," Let's look at this. "
"7577610","7579870"," Let's see if this liquidity is still here or not."
"7581310","7585710"," Now this is where the liquidity is right down here."
"7585710","7589770"," And let's see if we see anything down at 4, 4, 5, 0."
"7591050","7593610"," Stronger support down here 4, 4, 5, 0."
"7595650","7603270"," And get this loaded further out. "
"7615070","7615810"," Right there."
"7627180","7640450"," 4, 4, 6 and 4, 4, 4, 4.60. Proximate"
"7640450","7640790"," so."
"7641210","7641930"," Let's go to the top chat. "
"7642350","7642990"," It's a live chat."
"7647460","7648760"," Probably super hawkish."
"7650980","7652900"," Does that say switch the cash count to your MP rule?"
"7653200","7655760"," However, then you can't have the spreads to the counts better. "
"7656820","7661500"," In fact, you could probably use something at 4, 20, 3, 4, 60 for 5, 20."
"7661500","7663120"," Was not Russia."
"7663400","7664800"," Tesla broke 10.50 support. "
"7665820","7668280"," 10.50 to 10.30 is support on Tesla."
"7670500","7678670"," Support is not broken until you break 10.30. Are you going to 4.45?"
"7679250","7682490"," 4.50. I don't even lose the support level."
"7682690","7683490"," I'm probably going to pick down. "
"7688090","7689130"," I don't know."
"7691090","7692250"," Yeah, I'm not in any way."
"7692270","7694990"," I think we talked about that this morning, right?"
"7697970","7700310"," Yeah, I don't think the bear trade is until. "
"7700750","7703010"," I don't think you get the bear trade."
"7703550","7704090"," Let's look close."
"7704470","7706030"," I think I looked at this this morning with you guys. "
"7706810","7707830"," The bear trade here."
"7708690","7710090"," Let me show you where the bear trade is."
"7712270","7713790"," The bear trade is right here. "
"7714670","7715370"," That's the bear trade."
"7718410","7719850"," You have to be below this number."
"7721490","7725690"," There is no bear trade until you take that trade there. "
"7726950","7729590"," Otherwise, this is all bull trapping or bear trapping."
"7730210","7731850"," Or potentially bull bear trapping."
"7732490","7734970"," It has nothing to do with whatever a bear is doing. "
"7735870","7738110"," And I won't get bears until we trade below this."
"7742740","7743780"," Bear trapping."
"7744680","7750040"," Now, this right here is as you trade down either here or even down here. "
"7750040","7751280"," It doesn't matter."
"7751440","7754160"," What does happen here is trade down here."
"7754740","7756100"," And this is where the bear trap is. "
"7756660","7758280"," Then it's just fucked in the sky rock and storms."
"7760120","7762660"," And you're providing the fuel to the fire to get up."
"7765480","7765920"," Usually. "
"7766560","7772420"," Now, if we were below this line, typically you'd come up here."
"7773060","7776780"," And the bulls would be buying calls and they get trapped."
"7777840","7778240"," We'll go down. "
"7778240","7780220"," And we're above here."
"7780740","7784160"," Any kind of dips like this is just deal with the fire."
"7787320","7788060"," Not always. "
"7789440","7791300"," But this would be the stance that you're in."
"7791420","7793340"," You shouldn't be in the bear stance where we are."
"7794900","7797380"," You should be in the bull stance where we are. "
"7798120","7805120"," If we're below here, you should take the bear perspective in your trading."
"7807000","7808360"," This is celery rip."
"7811460","7812960"," And this is by every dip. "
"7819040","7819720"," I did."
"7820340","7821080"," It's D."
"7829500","7833440"," Be careful of that because if you are, especially when we're heading up."
"7833960","7838400"," But my point to you is that if you want to take a bull and bear stance, you want to"
"7838400","7840520"," be able to be a bull and be a bear and make money. "
"7841080","7843640"," You do want to take the sell the rip mentality down here."
"7843640","7845420"," And the by the dip mentality up here."
"7851430","7853930"," Yeah, I like it didn't rig come out with some. "
"7857520","7858500"," Didn't rig come out."
"7858700","7860000"," Did rig have calls yesterday?"
"7863250","7865970"," I want to bring something up for you guys here in just a second."
"7866070","7866990"," I want to show you guys something here. "
"7867710","7868450"," That was interesting."
"7868850","7869370"," We'll let this load."
"7869490","7871910"," I want to talk to you guys about some winky like this. "
"7876220","7877220"," Just a second here."
"7884500","7885260"," Hang tight."
"7893230","7894230"," Just a second here. "
"7927120","7928360"," We got something neat for you."
"7928480","7930040"," Someone you probably want to follow too."
"7931680","7933300"," Something that we'll talk about right now. "
"7946340","7951060"," I'm going to keep my eye on the options chain and see if there's any switch to bearish too."
"7951680","7952940"," And that's the other thing that you add to your."
"7953980","7959400"," If you guys trade on tasty works, you can you can watch the options chain and see where the the"
"7959400","7963600"," high frequency training firms where they jump on. "
"7964040","7966960"," So an example, it doesn't always work, but it works often."
"7967440","7971640"," So yesterday is a prime example."
"7971980","7975100"," Winky and I were we're buying and selling puts, right?"
"7976080","7978940"," And all day long. "
"7978940","7983920"," In the morning, it started at like 40,000 for I think it was 445 P's."
"7984180","7986960"," It could be wrong on this one, but it was I think it was 445 P's."
"7987380","7991940"," Then at like halfway through the day, there was a hundred thousand four four five P's. "
"7993180","7997380"," Then midway or two o'clock hour, there was like 150,000."
"7997380","7998620"," Then there was 200,000."
"7998740","7999860"," Then there was 300,000. "
"8001700","8006360"," 45 P's on the on the options chain, right?"
"8007120","8010540"," And they fluctuated between 30 and 40 cents all day long, right?"
"8010720","8012840"," You saw it go up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down."
"8013640","8018680"," And then right around the three o'clock hour yesterday, it rolled."
"8019080","8021280"," It rolled and printed 600%. "
"8022140","8023500"," Now that's a better example."
"8023720","8024660"," They don't always work out."
"8024800","8030640"," Sometimes you'll see they'll split their calls and put sometimes they'll jump from the call side to"
"8030640","8031120"," the put side. "
"8033720","8037680"," Sometimes they don't guide the price when they say that this is an options driven market."
"8038240","8044960"," That's because these algorithms will try to push the market by buying calls and puts."
"8045440","8048780"," So 450 C's, right?"
"8049120","8050240"," They're on them right now. "
"8050480","8051740"," They're fluctuating in price."
"8051960","8052300"," They're right now."
"8052340","8053500"," They're down to 76 cents. "
"8054520","8059700"," But if you can, I'm watching them add more and more calls at the 450 C."
"8059700","8063800"," They have gone through the close of cash equity trade across Europe on officially the DAX down"
"8063800","8067540"," about 1.1% to cap up about 1.1% excuse me."
"8068020","8072100"," The cap cron is up one and a half percent and the footsie was essentially flat."
"8073580","8077480"," The euro at 108.56 is a little change on the day. "
"8078340","8083600"," You know, so that you move out to a high of 109.36 earlier in the session following some ECB"
"8083600","8084060"," speed."
"8085220","8088900"," So you'll see them add these positions, add these positions, add these positions."
"8089360","8090360"," You'll see them move them around. "
"8090360","8093320"," It's daily and a press interview just repeating what we heard from her yesterday."
"8093600","8098020"," If that needs to take measured pace on rate hikes, get rates up to two and a half percent by"
"8098020","8098860"," the end of the year."
"8099860","8102220"," And we heard from her extensively yesterday as well. "
"8105920","8107680"," Now does that mean it goes your way?"
"8107960","8112460"," No, but it is something that we use as a tool to see."
"8112860","8116460"," Are we loading up on the call side or are we loading up on the put side right now?"
"8116460","8117460"," Where are we loading up?"
"8118100","8119460"," Does that mean it always works?"
"8119820","8120280"," Fuck no."
"8120860","8125100"," But does it mean that there is someone out there loading up on this for a move higher?"
"8125520","8126160"," Yes, it does. "
"8127360","8132500"," And oftentimes as a, like a, like a, not a main light tool."
"8132500","8136080"," I think you were reading from yesterday that the Fed is likely going to high grades by 50 basis"
"8136080","8137540"," points at a couple of meetings."
"8142380","8143860"," Does it mean that they're loading them up?"
"8143860","8144040"," Right. "
"8144140","8148760"," Currently about 24 basis points with a 10 year or two ninety one on the two year two sixty seven."
"8152080","8152960"," Daily reiterating."
"8153080","8153980"," It's an open question. "
"8154240","8170160"," How far rates may need to go above two and a half percent for"
"8170160","8170720"," week bills."
"8170980","8175920"," Draw zero point five zero zero percent with twenty six point nine percent allowed at the high and a"
"8175920","8177360"," bit to cover three point two one."
"8177360","8181620"," A week bills draw zero point sixty five percent with seventy two point seven percent allowed at the"
"8181620","8183040"," high and a bit to cover three point two four. "
"8203190","8206370"," You've got massive sellers on rig right now."
"8214260","8214879"," We'll look at rig."
"8215240","8215700"," We'll load back. "
"8215879","8217600"," We'll load back some time on rig."
"8219320","8221700"," I guess we said that the buy was at four, right?"
"8222820","8224500"," Two hours in there."
"8233830","8240530"," Get five hundred and fifty four thousand sellers on rig to three hundred and two thousand sellers"
"8240530","8241110"," on rig. "
"8257309","8263209"," It's major support down at three fifty on rig and also currently right where it's at right now at"
"8263209","8264430"," this four thirty four level."
"8265870","8269350"," And the buyers are just monster above."
"8269790","8271670"," I don't know if we saw calls or puts on rig yesterday. "
"8272690","8278250"," You can see the force of sellers above here at five dollars is quite large."
"8278389","8283950"," I think we said buy four or something yesterday in cell five because of just the vast number of"
"8283950","8284629"," sellers above."
"8285350","8287309"," I don't hold me to that. "
"8287309","8288370"," Do I remember what we did?"
"8288549","8290090"," Well, we looked at yesterday what came out yesterday."
"8290629","8291469"," It came out of inputs."
"8292150","8293090"," So we'll look it up. "
"8294150","8295290"," Let's look up what they were."
"8295450","8296150"," There are put calls."
"8306700","8307879"," Look yesterday at rig. "
"8318740","8326299"," They were rig August 19th, four point five C's for four hundred thousand dollars."
"8326299","8329059"," Those came in at one forty eight in the afternoon."
"8330219","8333160"," And then we had rig puts come in in the morning. "
"8333420","8335240"," So you had puts in the morning, weakness in the morning."
"8336059","8338840"," Those are for January 20th."
"8340990","8342010"," This could be a spread. "
"8342309","8343469"," If I had to guess, this is a spread."
"8344190","8348330"," That's the only thing that there isn't a sign the economy is going to tip into recession."
"8349570","8352549"," But I do have the rig flow for yesterday up. "
"8353389","8356410"," And I'll put this week for you to on rig on discord."
"8366100","8366780"," Same flow."
"8366959","8367700"," It all came in yesterday. "
"8372420","8373180"," Looks like that."
"8373440","8373920"," I'll be out of there."
"8374180","8378400"," I think they got both out because they can get both sides to print down to three. "
"8378400","8382780"," And then once they start selling five dollars, four fifty once they start selling four fifty."
"8383139","8384200"," So pull those off."
"8384379","8391140"," They're far dated August 19th on the on the calls and January 20th on the puts. "
"8393300","8395560"," January 20th 2023 3 P."
"8397640","8401960"," And then August 19th, four point five C."
"8403240","8404800"," So those are very far up."
"8404800","8405220"," They're just waiting."
"8405600","8406700"," They're not complacent. "
"8406880","8410660"," But the odds are in the fence favor for smooth landing."
"8417390","8418090"," Sorry about that."
"8421950","8422870"," There's so far out. "
"8423010","8426550"," It just looks like they're looking to get to put the printed down here."
"8426750","8427050"," Three fifty."
"8427950","8432950"," And then sell once they write, we write up to five dollars at any point on rig. "
"8435130","8437330"," But on that same, not that same note, but similar note."
"8438430","8441490"," We're going to look at this is devil's advocate."
"8444470","8447930"," Delic to me straight is $100 crude too high. "
"8448710","8452910"," If you guys have a chance to, I don't know if you can cut and paste this."
"8454310","8455510"," You can subscribe to this."
"8457390","8459730"," This sub stack, but delic to me straight. "
"8461370","8465230"," If you want to post the link to this on Twitter, I might like to post link to it right"
"8465230","8465850"," now for you."
"8469630","8472130"," And it's going to put on that captain's alpha."
"8477210","8481190"," So I just posted that this a link to this on a captain's. "
"8481310","8486650"," Just reiterating that she's not believe we're seeing the beginnings of a wage price price spiral."
"8489650","8496590"," And last week, last week, this came out on April 4th."
"8496590","8498590"," You want to look him up. "
"8498730","8499690"," I follow him on Twitter."
"8500470","8501730"," Put on a note on refiner."
"8501910","8505670"," Delic, we think that was an opening salvo and a round of positive earnings outlooks for the refiner"
"8505670","8505970"," group. "
"8506450","8510030"," Create micro implications of some of macros that topics we've been focused on."
"8511090","8512810"," It's a small cap down stream company."
"8513070","8515550"," They may make distillates, basically, okay. "
"8516590","8520090"," Companies are building out midstream and retail business is an effort to diversify."
"8520090","8523490"," Defining group at large did well during pre-COVID."
"8523870","8524490"," Shell boom. "
"8526170","8527190"," Move on."
"8528350","8528850"," From there."
"8532470","8537450"," Refiners brought their feedstock regionally at discount to global crude grades. "
"8537930","8541150"," Then refined crude into finished products like gasoline and diesels."
"8541390","8545830"," Prices were linked to more global crude than regional US grades."
"8545830","8551990"," But disproportionate exposure to a premium crude deluxe financial performance is broadly tied to"
"8551990","8557590"," the discount of which Permian crude's trade versus global benchmarks. "
"8559770","8563430"," The wider the Permian crude discount, the better it was for DK earnings."
"8564630","8565730"," That's a key note."
"8566430","8573850"," As the US crude production growth reversed, then slowly resumed after COVID crude differentials"
"8573850","8574850"," across the board narrowed. "
"8574850","8578030"," We paid less attention to in-land refiners like DK."
"8578690","8579830"," That's the key one right there."
"8579950","8580890"," DK looked them up. "
"8581430","8585890"," Whose prior well-being was dependent on these crude differentials, right?"
"8587030","8589090"," So we'll leave that up for you for a minute."
"8592340","8594500"," Until the world started running up, distillate that is."
"8595260","8596640"," You can read this on your own. "
"8597700","8604840"," But basically what they're trying to tell you is that we're running low on distillate inventories."
"8605400","8608340"," Currently you can see it's almost at an all-time low right now."
"8610160","8615000"," In various states they are well below seasonal norms and the market is yet to feel the impact of"
"8615000","8620260"," the loss of the Russian distillate exports further. "
"8621760","8626560"," How they've been pricing companies like this is too low."
"8626840","8629960"," They're basing their pricing at a kind of different metric."
"8631840","8633540"," So read this on your own. "
"8634960","8636560"," The cracks curve, right?"
"8636800","8638540"," We were praying two weeks ago today."
"8638540","8641140"," The curve is lowering here on the cracks."
"8643720","8647520"," If today's distillate shortage is further compounded in the cutting months by the loss of Russian"
"8647520","8652500"," distillate exports, what if crude holds around $100 a barrel while distillate inventories continue"
"8652500","8653260"," to struggle to rebuild?"
"8653620","8656860"," What if $40 a barrel distillate cracks persist?"
"8656860","8659080"," In that case, consensus would need to move up. "
"8659680","8666580"," Now he goes into deep more deeply into why the consensus estimates are low and what those are based"
"8666580","8667920"," on inside of this article."
"8668860","8677160"," But the neat part is that he's basically saying that distillate small mid-tier distillate stocks"
"8677160","8679320"," are being undervalued right now."
"8680020","8681320"," So you want to read this on your own. "
"8681440","8682960"," It took me like an hour to get through all this shit."
"8683640","8686260"," And what's neat is that decay has been on the rise."
"8686660","8691520"," So I'll leave this to you for another time to read through in his examples and his reasoning for"
"8691520","8694260"," why it's undervalued, where it can go. "
"8695380","8698580"," So if you're watching crude, you must watch distillate."
"8698860","8705000"," And the key about distillate is it hasn't had the meteoric rise that oil has."
"8705180","8711040"," It hasn't risen in the same way that crude has. "
"8711040","8714200"," Yet the price of distillate should at some point."
"8716920","8722040"," And since he put this article out, this was, he put this article out on what was rising before."
"8722540","8728700"," And they have an ER coming up, I believe, in early mail, though it's not decided yet. "
"8729420","8733160"," Now he put this article out back here on the fourth."
"8734720","8737500"," I think that's somewhere in here you put that article out."
"8737800","8741320"," It had a pretty decent rise from $20 to $25. "
"8742040","8751020"," And so my thought process here is that I'm just going to be looking for, as you can see, it's"
"8751020","8752520"," being pushed up all the way from $14."
"8754500","8756880"," So I'm not buying this here, by the way."
"8757640","8766200"," And he gives examples of that they've done very well on the run-ups to their"
"8766200","8767880"," ERs. "
"8768000","8773200"," So they've done very well leading up to, you'd sell just before they're an ER announcement."
"8776150","8784010"," But if you put an alert down here on DK and do your due diligence like this guy has and"
"8784010","8786210"," look for some kind of an entry point."
"8787090","8788630"," Cheap stock to, it's only $20. "
"8789350","8795310"," So if there's any way to buy in down here, if there's any kind of sell-off or weakness in"
"8795310","8799430"," oil, and you can grab this and hold into their ER."
"8800210","8800970"," The ticker is DK."
"8801730","8809170"," And I posted the due diligence for Delac. "
"8809690","8818430"," And I posted this link to this story for the Devil's Advocates at"
"8818430","8819870"," Captain's Elf."
"8820130","8822330"," Let's take a look at this and look through it."
"8825130","8827090"," And it's not just DK either. "
"8827290","8831650"," There are some other companies out there that should benefit from that trade as well."
"8841160","8843440"," Since it switched on the spy, it wasn't paying attention."
"8849240","8850860"," Still dipping on the spy here. "
"8851440","8853000"," Still that nice crossover on the spy."
"8854860","8856020"," We'll see if this holds."
"8857340","8859520"," This is the 4-4-5-0. "
"8860080","8866560"," This would be the support that you want to be held if you're a bull in this market."
"8867140","8875040"," If this does not hold your next price target below here, if the 4-4-5 does not hold, the"
"8875040","8876740"," next attack would be 4-40."
"8876880","8877980"," There's nothing holding us up. "
"8878600","8881380"," This is the volatility triggered down below here where we're at."
"8882060","8885320"," So we'll see if this holds, and if it does not, we'll start getting our bear head on."
"8892510","8898190"," We'll take a look here and see if this holds or not. "
"8899070","8909830"," We'll take a close look at Tesla here and see the trade down below 10.50. Tag"
"8909830","8915510"," on 10.40. And the sell the world is 10.30 down below here for me."
"8916790","8920790"," If there's no buyers at 10.30, it'll be a fast drop down to 1,000."
"8928420","8929480"," We'll take a look here. "
"8934260","8936540"," It's like there's some more buyers stepping in here."
"8936540","8944020"," Carrying the 4-4-4 sales, 4.96 billion above the 4.62 billion consensus estimate for a kilo echo."
"8945120","8946640"," Romeo trading in Paris, France. "
"8947520","8949880"," And I'm still holding calls on Tesla and spy."
"8950060","8950900"," I haven't sold any of them."
"8954620","8955480"," Nothing matters. "
"8957640","8958340"," Free money."
"8959220","8959620"," Let's see."
"8970720","8971560"," Hold up there. "
"8986060","8988500"," Bring that up so you can see if it breaks through."
"8994320","8995200"," All right there."
"8995360","8997840"," I'll leave this one on here so you can see where these levels are. "
"8998840","9002640"," And we'll see if it continues to break through or if this is just a trap to go along."
"9003720","9007340"," 4.45, 3.2, this is the important level here for spy actually."
"9008020","9009340"," This would signal up. "
"9009440","9013740"," This might actually figure a cell for me if we break below where we are currently."
"9019590","9021110"," So we'll leave spy up here."
"9021770","9026430"," Because this is actually more important right now than where Tesla is. "
"9040030","9041850"," I'm watching NDX as well."
"9043850","9046230"," Same little support zone down here."
"9046610","9050610"," Testing the lows of this minor intraday support. "
"9051510","9052770"," Breaking through it actually."
"9053510","9054550"," We'll see if this holds."
"9054930","9059850"," If this does not hold, we'll be looking for..."
"9059850","9062830"," You can get the bears out there. "
"9063630","9064950"," Get the bears out there."
"9065910","9067650"," All you bears buying puts right now by the way?"
"9068150","9068450"," Let me know."
"9072900","9074520"," Yeah, I'm not bearish at all right now. "
"9075240","9079020"," I have no bear fair here at all."
"9079720","9080240"," None."
"9083680","9085340"," Maybe I should but I don't. "
"9093050","9105370"," I'm gonna buy"
"9105370","9106590"," some more calls down here too."
"9134960","9151360"," I just added more 450, 450s on spy to another"
"9151360","9152040"," slow day."
"9152080","9154620"," I'm like, this is fucking killing me. "
"9154680","9157580"," It has that composers now in negative territory on the day."
"9158100","9161040"," The dollar has firmed up."
"9161040","9162980"," This treasury yields have continued to climb. "
"9163260","9169540"," The US tenure yield to 2.94%. Following these latest comments from both Chairman Powell."
"9170240","9170880"," That's daily."
"9172520","9175160"," The TLT bulls are getting fucked right now. "
"9180520","9183420"," The US tenure yield now up 11 basis points on the day."
"9186840","9190460"," So quick bounce at 1.19.24 on TLT."
"9192710","9193730"," I thought I missed. "
"9193970","9197330"," I saw I was gonna buy this while I wanted 1.16 on TLT."
"9197330","9198730"," And didn't catch."
"9198930","9207530"," I missed the 1.18. My buy in was 1.16. We're already down to 1.19.40 on TLT. "
"9210700","9214260"," That was a two day, a one day rip basically on TLT."
"9219310","9228260"," My buy in here was 1.16. 1.16.70. That's where I wanted to buy TLT."
"9232870","9241340"," We're now back down to 19.20. This is actually where it starts to get ugly down in here. "
"9243780","9249900"," You start making drops on a 1.16 year 1.17 in 1.05. This goes all the way back"
"9249900","9251680"," to..."
"9251680","9257200"," OPEC has said that they believe oil price rises mainly due to geopolitical tensions in Eastern"
"9257200","9260700"," Europe and their concern of a large supply shortage."
"9263110","9269730"," OPEC's saying that OPEC Plus has demonstrated commitment to the oil market fundamentals."
"9271570","9275330"," It's going back to late 2018. "
"9277630","9283750"," And then back again here in late December of 2016."
"9285390","9287430"," I'm missing that one drop here."
"9300530","9303390"," You can see right here the touch. "
"9304070","9313380"," Now you start breaking this here and you're looking at a fall of 60 bucks or so."
"9315030","9324860"," How about some pretty fucking big drops in some violent"
"9324860","9325660"," drops here?"
"9326740","9328100"," So you can kind of see, right?"
"9329480","9336420"," This is 1.05 to 1.16. This area right in here is, I would consider this to"
"9336420","9343120"," be the start getting free falls."
"9343520","9349380"," You know, if this doesn't get bought up in here, you start seeing some, you'll start to see some"
"9349380","9351600"," fucking, this is actually a vicious falling here. "
"9352800","9356240"," And rather than, you know, you'll start seeing these moves again."
"9356780","9359820"," You'll actually start to see those giant moves in here."
"9359820","9363740"," And then the fucking moves down here are swift and steep. "
"9364940","9366000"," Swift and steep."
"9369360","9370820"," So I didn't quite get that."
"9371840","9375200"," I didn't sort of, at 1.18 I wasn't triggering for me. "
"9375320","9379000"," I wanted the trigger to be like 1.16 right here to buy this one."
"9379440","9380900"," So I figured I missed it yesterday."
"9381600","9383060"," But it doesn't look like I have. "
"9386580","9390260"," I was about to 1.18. And I really want to see that."
"9392600","9395080"," I wanted to see it come down and tag here."
"9395600","9397060"," So we'll see if we get that tag or not. "
"9398080","9406280"," If this did tag down below to, this does try to break that 105 or 100."
"9406820","9408520"," That would be very significant."
"9409680","9411380"," And look at that right there. "
"9412180","9420440"," Turn that off right there."
"9427390","9430170"," There's some pretty significant support in here."
"9433050","9434970"," But you start breaking through these levels here. "
"9435190","9436370"," If you grind through these levels."
"9442980","9443820"," That's huge."
"9444580","9451120"," It's going back to 2011, which is huge a decade. "
"9451540","9452920"," It's more than a decade, right?"
"9453340","9454600"," 13 years or something like that."
"9456200","9458500"," This is never broken trend in here, right?"
"9462540","9463040"," And boom."
"9463820","9466180"," And these are some pretty significant rises. "
"9468060","9469040"," Off of."
"9471980","9475240"," So this is this is significant for sure."
"9498680","9508100"," See if if we get if we get a hold here or take a bear trade. "
"9509300","9512360"," So if this breaks here, if we get a break here."
"9513780","9521020"," I'd like to pick up a short somewhere in here."
"9521200","9524460"," If you're looking to pick up a short, like right here, or if you're looking to grab a short. "
"9565540","9568740"," So there's a post on Fed's Daily, what he had said."
"9569140","9569660"," He's a dove."
"9570880","9572240"," He's a non-voter as well. "
"9572840","9578360"," He rearrates that rates expeditiously marching towards neutral, likely hiking by 50 basis points in"
"9578360","9579040"," a couple of meetings."
"9580990","9585670"," And opens up the door to the next couple of Fed meetings, having 50 point basis hikes."
"9587830","9597470"," As an open question, how far rates may need to rise above 2.5%. It's open question how"
"9597470","9600150"," restrictive the Fed policy may need to get. "
"9600830","9606150"," There's not a sign the economy is going to tip into recession."
"9607170","9615690"," And then can't necessarily call an inflation peak, a given China lockdowns, war and supply chain"
"9615690","9616730"," bottlenecks."
"9617290","9618250"," Yeah, I agree. "
"9618470","9620770"," I think that the news is going to the China lockdowns."
"9621330","9625070"," Elon yesterday was talking about how they reopened the Shanghai factory."
"9626490","9632930"," And so I was interested to see if this is just noise as more ER reports come out, or if"
"9632930","9636270"," there are actual lockdowns impacting manufacturing. "
"9636810","9639170"," Or if this is something that's fed to news organizations."
"9640390","9648110"," But the key one for me is the fact that they're using that you'll start to see that China lockdowns"
"9648110","9653750"," gain more traction as a negative reason for the market."
"9654450","9655510"," And then the war. "
"9655910","9661010"," And then of course the supply chain bottlenecks mostly has to do with, or is being tied to"
"9661010","9662150"," lockdowns in China, right?"
"9664090","9665330"," And shipping, of course."
"9666390","9671590"," But the war is the one for me that I'm wondering if there will, of those three would be the"
"9671590","9675690"," headline to bring the market up during the FOMC."
"9676570","9682150"," What headline news story would it be that would be used for why the market's going up?"
"9682970","9685570"," Watching a little bit of a push through on the spy right now. "
"9686330","9690310"," He also says he does not see wage price spiral beginning."
"9691170","9696330"," There was a little bit of a contradictory statement on that in the beige book yesterday."
"9697190","9703930"," They weren't really worried about wage price spiraling, but they did have some concerns with wages"
"9703930","9710770"," per se, high wages persisting in the market or in hiring practices. "
"9717310","9718390"," Test below here."
"9719050","9720890"," Now trading to lows."
"9722150","9727470"," 4.44.81. We'll take a look and see if there'll be a rug pull here or not. "
"9727830","9730770"," I'm going to keep it right here for you to see if this rug gets pulled."
"9730910","9735510"," If this rug does get pulled in here, this is, I'm going to take a look and see if this"
"9735510","9738410"," is the, the vol trigger or not ever changed."
"9738850","9741630"," I think it's still down below, but we'll take a look and see. "
"9747960","9749660"," If it moved higher or not."
"9764160","9766660"," Yeah, so the vol trigger has come up."
"9766980","9768720"," It was at 443 yesterday. "
"9769340","9779190"," It's at 445 today on the spy on, on ES, the vol"
"9779190","9791230"," triggers"
"9792920","9792920"," on 4444."
"9792920","9793760"," I'm just hitting it back down there."
"9798440","9799200"," Right there. "
"9800140","9802840"," And so we'll switch the, oh no, hold on."
"9803160","9807380"," I'll, I'll adjust it on, on this chart here."
"9842200","9845960"," So this is the S2 is also the spy volatility trigger. "
"9846460","9847960"," So we'll write that one down there."
"9851920","9853220"," I should have grabbed some fucking puts."
"9874060","9875480"," It's a beautiful fucking self. "
"9875680","9876760"," I wish I grabbed some for this."
"9876860","9877880"," I want a fucking made bank."
"9877880","9885000"," I bought some calls here and I just bought some calls right up here too. "
"9885080","9887120"," I just added into these calls right here."
"9891860","9892920"," We'll see if this holds."
"9893080","9897860"," If this does not hold here, this is very bad for, for the spy. "
"9898140","9906040"," If you see, if you see a trade below and a couple rejections, the move down below here will"
"9906040","9915820"," be but no, I'm still, I bought, I bought this"
"9915820","9920020"," here and I bought this here and I still think we're going higher."
"9931640","9933980"," Yeah, I still think we'll be here by tomorrow."
"9936200","9938160"," I still don't see us being below. "
"9938440","9939080"," We could be below."
"9939380","9939960"," I don't see it."
"9946330","9950010"," So I gotta cross my fingers, cross my fingers and make my prayers. "
"9958790","9960390"," Yeah, I won't take a short position."
"9960970","9966150"," I won't take a short position unless we break through and restart rejecting."
"9968600","9970920"," I'm not touching the short trade here. "
"9975840","9981320"," I'll buy dips anywhere above this volatility trigger and I will sell rips anywhere below this"
"9981320","9982680"," volatility trigger."
"9983820","9985560"," But just, I won't do it."
"9985820","9986520"," Don't touch it. "
"10028290","10031810"," Watching more puts come in right now watching put spin on Facebook."
"10032630","10041830"," April 22nd, 180 p Microsoft for 29 April 29th, 280 p for 345,000 dollars puts on a firm."
"10042410","10047190"," May 20th, 30 p 192,000 dollars puts on BB. "
"10049010","10053190"," May 20th, 6 p for 15,000 dollars."
"10053490","10056850"," More puts on a firm spy AMC."
"10059850","10060850"," What else do I see?"
"10062510","10064690"," Some puts on snap and apple. "
"10064870","10066830"," I haven't seen a lot of puts on our snap recently."
"10067030","10071050"," Chicago president Charles Evans to retire in early 2023."
"10076030","10078090"," Bloodbath on the spy currently. "
"10078990","10080910"," A straight bloodbath."
"10081570","10083410"," A break of 450."
"10084450","10085270"," Huge move for the bears. "
"10086110","10087770"," Bears crushing it right now."
"10087930","10089330"," They must be fucking stoked."
"10090510","10092330"," If you're a bear, congratulations. "
"10092890","10094390"," That's a beautiful move right here."
"10094950","10096490"," Huge move for the bears."
"10098470","10099890"," Monster move for the bears. "
"10112120","10113640"," I'm going to put a trade on here."
"10196420","10198820"," Huge move power move for the bears."
"10198820","10200700"," This is a kick-ass trade. "
"10200900","10204220"," If you took this trade short, I did not take this trade short."
"10204720","10206180"," Great move if you're a bear."
"10206360","10208820"," Let's see if this gets rejected and we start trading lower. "
"10209620","10211320"," This is going to be interesting here."
"10211660","10215180"," If we start to reverse this market, this will be wild."
"10215880","10220200"," Let's take a look at that low. "
"10220380","10223120"," We still haven't gone down below back into that channel."
"10223720","10227140"," Still not back in that previous channel down below here."
"10227140","10228880"," Talk about touching it. "
"10229320","10233720"," Came straight back down, gave up everything that was gained in that move from yesterday."
"10234580","10234920"," Unreal."
"10236540","10237140"," Unbelievable. "
"10237440","10238420"," I didn't see this at all."
"10238740","10240140"," I figured we'd come down to 445."
"10241360","10242620"," That was the base case. "
"10242780","10246640"," It was 445, but that was a huge move below 445."
"10247760","10249880"," Broke right through support at 445."
"10251100","10258200"," Tag down below here at 444.09. This is a big move for the bears. "
"10259400","10260120"," Unbelievable."
"10260580","10262060"," Not expected at all."
"10262060","10262080"," Not expected at all. "
"10262080","10266540"," The tariff market now following an Azak in a negative territory in the Russell 2000s down three "
"10266540","10267580","-quarters of a percent."
"10268740","10269460"," Unreal."
"10270160","10271560"," Let's look at TLT. "
"10271940","10274320"," TLT is still selling off right now."
"10275220","10278300"," The lows from the previous lows over here."
"10278860","10279760"," This is wild. "
"10281100","10284860"," 118.87. There's still room to go down, right?"
"10285600","10289660"," Without even breaking a sweat to give back everything from two days ago."
"10292510","10295570"," Let's see how far two days ago was in the spine."
"10296470","10298370"," See how bad and ugly that could get. "
"10300950","10303290"," Two-day prior lows aren't even that far."
"10303530","10304270"," I guess they are."
"10305130","10306990"," Let's go back to TLT real quick. "
"10309780","10311100"," Hold on here."
"10314100","10316260"," That was in the early morning too."
"10318120","10320120"," That won that 118 number. "
"10320500","10323320"," That was a pretty deep morning for the spine."
"10324280","10331800"," Talking about way down here at 4.37. 4.35. I wonder because I've got Friday put."
"10332200","10335460"," As a matter of fact, I still own Friday put. "
"10342500","10344300"," I've got to go to Friday."
"10345700","10350200"," I still fucking own Friday put."
"10352300","10353860"," Yeah, they're still kind of worthless. "
"10355500","10356720"," They didn't even gain anything."
"10359400","10360460"," They're still pennies."
"10372090","10373430"," They're like 8.9 cents. "
"10373650","10374810"," They were like 12 cents yesterday."
"10377710","10379310"," They still ain't shit though."
"10383950","10385290"," Still not worth anything. "
"10386810","10387930"," They're just grinding."
"10399350","10401150"," Still dip buyers on the spine."
"10401490","10405210"," And now they're up to 115,000 contracts on 450 C's. "
"10406050","10407930"," We'll see if this holds or if we break below."
"10408970","10415730"," If we get back into this channel and give up all these gains today, it would be fucking wild if"
"10415730","10416230"," this happens."
"10417930","10419070"," Absolutely wild. "
"10419290","10420450"," This would be a huge reversal."
"10420450","10424410"," This would be a crushing death blow for bulls if this took place today."
"10426330","10428650"," We'll see if we break or hold here. "
"10428810","10432530"," If we don't hold here, there should be a really good short."
"10432970","10438030"," Even if this was good for you and you want to see an even better short, what you'll end up"
"10438030","10444130"," seeing is you'll see bulls try to buy a dip and they'll get caught in here."
"10444530","10448210"," And this will just careen down at some point. "
"10448210","10451510"," This could wind up turning into a really big play right here."
"10454000","10456740"," I bought this dip here and I bought this dip here."
"10456800","10457560"," I'm still holding these. "
"10457760","10458780"," I still think we go up."
"10459080","10467980"," I still think that in my view, I still think we actually go much higher heading into tomorrow into"
"10467980","10469740"," taste Thursday, I think, right?"
"10470360","10470760"," Take Thursday."
"10474840","10476000"," Or is the weekend yet?"
"10479100","10480000"," See the weekend. "
"10484540","10485560"," Eastern time."
"10487840","10489460"," Yeah, taste Thursday."
"10489720","10490460"," See if we have one more day left. "
"10497080","10500200"," Just smashing and blasting down through the bald trigger."
"10500960","10506780"," Bulls must be scared shitless right now that the bull thesis could get wrecked right here."
"10507340","10512380"," And furthermore, you can look at this. "
"10512380","10518980"," You can see some buyers stepping in even lower at 4.41.97, which is huge for the bears."
"10520100","10520280"," Huge."
"10521620","10522300"," Huge. "
"10524000","10525260"," 4.40 down here."
"10525440","10525880"," Next support."
"10527340","10529420"," And then 4.35 down below. "
"10531080","10535900"," And then 4.30. Yeah, 4.30 here."
"10538300","10545440"," 4.25 and 4.22. We'll see if the bears can hold on or if the bulls can hold on."
"10546200","10548380"," I'll tell you what though, the one killer here is this. "
"10549160","10555420"," If you look at, if you look, the bears are looking to jump right back in."
"10555800","10561780"," You can see above here at 4.45.80. The bears are looking to just re-enter short once more"
"10561780","10562820"," and just wreck this."
"10562820","10570120"," So you can see the sellers now stepping in above here at 4.40. We'll call it 4.45.76."
"10571020","10574360"," And we'll see if the bears can actually turn this around. "
"10575880","10578700"," So let's see if we can see this again."
"10579620","10589200"," So we've got 4.40. 4.45, sorry, 4.45.73. So what we'll do"
"10589200","10599200"," is 4.45.73. 4.45.75. We'll do that"
"10599200","10599800"," back up here."
"10611540","10613740"," Let me get back to the spot here. "
"10615220","10623520"," 4.45.73. So the bears are, we did this one yesterday, right?"
"10624320","10628340"," 4.45.73. So the bears are right here."
"10635560","10641580"," 4.45.73. So this is where the bears are right here."
"10641720","10643280"," We're getting ready to re-short. "
"10644380","10648320"," Now they could break through right here, but if we don't, if we trade higher, this is where they're"
"10648320","10650580"," waiting to take this market lower."
"10654640","10655800"," We're right there."
"10661030","10662810"," We'll see what happens here. "
"10663030","10665850"," Bears are on south, south, south."
"10667050","10673210"," If you break through here too, the next point would be if you break through this zone right here,"
"10673450","10673470"," right?"
"10673790","10679630"," Quick fall down to 4.40. And to be honest, if you give up, if you're a bull and you"
"10679630","10686270"," give up, if you give up, go back into negative gamma or a passive volatility trigger into negative"
"10686270","10687090"," gamma down here."
"10687310","10689270"," Everything down here is south of the rip. "
"10690130","10695770"," And we resume back to our march lower in the market, which would be wild."
"10696210","10702290"," First test, of course, down below is 4.35. And then test number two is at 4.20. And we'll"
"10702290","10703790"," write that one down there again too."
"10705090","10705770"," Right there. "
"10705890","10709830"," It changes every day, depending on how many days it takes to get there."
"10709830","10716110"," It could be 4.20 today or 4.24 or, you know, 4.23 as time passes."
"10717210","10719410"," So bulls have to hold the line here. "
"10719670","10724010"," If the bulls do not hold the line here, big time, bad news for the bulls."
"10724810","10725190"," Big time."
"10726410","10728210"," All gains given up from yesterday. "
"10729110","10733350"," Look at that retest, almost a retest of yesterday's prior low."
"10734010","10736230"," 4.43, let's look closer and see how that low is."
"10736230","10739430"," Let's go to the one day and check it. "
"10739610","10740210"," See where it was."
"10740890","10744130"," So the low from yesterday was 4.43, 48."
"10747650","10750430"," And 4.43, 72. "
"10751030","10751510"," Excellent."
"10751990","10755990"," My governor is saying Mexico inflation is less persistent and volatile than in the past."
"10756610","10758270"," Not good for the bulls either. "
"10758470","10759870"," So we actually had a break."
"10762150","10762610"," Oh, no."
"10762770","10763290"," We didn't have a break. "
"10763510","10764150"," Or 48."
"10764430","10765170"," We haven't had a break yet."
"10765170","10768870"," So 4.43, 48 was the low from yesterday. "
"10770710","10772670"," Haven't quite broken through that."
"10773050","10775610"," This is lining up the previous low, right?"
"10776030","10778990"," The day's previous low was 4.43, 48."
"10779950","10781750"," Have yet to break that. "
"10782010","10783210"," So we have a lower low still."
"10783950","10786890"," We still have not broken below 4.43, 48."
"10787490","10790070"," So still bullish are not bullish. "
"10790250","10791470"," They call it neutral at this point."
"10793710","10796450"," Definitely not bullish with how deep this sell off was."
"10796930","10802810"," This break of 4.45 is not not what the bulls want to be here in today at all. "
"10803490","10809410"," And furthermore, we haven't broken to a new lower low today, but it's just a break of a technical"
"10809410","10810990"," break of 4.43, 48."
"10813870","10818850"," It starts to spell bearish viewpoint on the market right now."
"10818990","10822310"," So we'll see if they can touch or break through the previous low from yesterday. "
"10827230","10829090"," How this market turns is wild."
"10830070","10831110"," Absolutely wild."
"10833390","10836250"," So we'll see if this holds the bears are going to take control. "
"10837030","10839010"," I'm going to call it neutral just at this point."
"10839010","10844970"," I want to see the movies up every day."
"10845710","10849750"," I want to see a break of 4.43, 48. "
"10849990","10852190"," You can get the break of 4.43, 48."
"10852870","10855930"," And you get the lower low from the previous days low."
"10856250","10857470"," I mean, that's a reverse. "
"10857630","10858790"," We're starting a reversal, right?"
"10859790","10860570"," You had the high."
"10862290","10866530"," You had the high and you didn't have a lower low today."
"10866530","10867930"," So do you have a lower low today?"
"10868850","10870210"," Do you close at a higher high?"
"10871170","10871590"," Bullish. "
"10871750","10872410"," Everything is fine."
"10873030","10873730"," Situations normal."
"10874890","10875650"," No big deal. "
"10877250","10884250"," If you break this lower low and you have a lower low for the day before, it could be a"
"10884250","10886570"," counter-trend or trend reversal for sure."
"10887230","10890490"," So we'll see if the bears, I'll put this back over here because we always like to see the stab"
"10890490","10891070"," of the bears."
"10891650","10897690"," We always like to see the candlesticks break through the bears if they do. "
"10898290","10902830"," We know the bears are up here and we'll take a look to see where they are again on BookMap."
"10903450","10904090"," You can see them."
"10904250","10904790"," They were right here. "
"10904910","10905670"," They've kind of disappeared."
"10906190","10907070"," They've come a little bit lower."
"10907230","10908190"," They want to get down there. "
"10909010","10909910"," They were here for a minute."
"10910050","10914430"," Maybe they're down now directly on top of the bulls trying to push down lower."
"10914850","10917310"," More bears above, right on 4.45 as well. "
"10917870","10919210"," You can see they've moved down slightly."
"10922740","10924360"," Bears don't want to give it up here."
"10924840","10926000"," They want to send it lower. "
"10927300","10930840"," They want to test that previous low from the day before it."
"10930960","10934320"," 4.43.48. Still haven't touched it yet."
"10934700","10936620"," They just want to break, break past it slightly. "
"10937320","10937660"," They could break."
"10937900","10941940"," They could break it down 4.43.46 and that's low enough technically."
"10942780","10944140"," Not to say we've got a lower low on the day. "
"10944260","10945960"," That's not good for the bulls if that happens."
"10958690","10960570"," No blin over the bulls if that happens."
"10967150","10969270"," Yeah, I'm still in my Tesla calls. "
"10969370","10970930"," I've got stops down below here."
"10971530","10974190"," And I have not sold my calls on Tesla yet."
"10974770","10977690"," So we'll see if this is not in my view. "
"10977690","10980490"," I think we still crank into Friday."
"10981150","10985890"," I've seen this happen before where you have this steep sell off."
"10986050","10987090"," They're reverses huge. "
"10987790","10988490"," They're versus double."
"10988750","10989450"," So I'm still long."
"10989650","10990010"," This market. "
"10990650","10993570"," I'm still not a convinced bear yet on this market."
"10993570","10996690"," I'm still taking the bulls stance and viewpoint."
"10997710","10999490"," Have not sold will not sell. "
"11010640","11012380"," And we'll see if the bears can do it."
"11013080","11015720"," We've got the looks like the sellers have come down slightly."
"11018880","11021360"," They're currently right on top of us right here. "
"11021640","11023120"," There's some more sellers right above."
"11023380","11024940"," They've moved down slightly from this point."
"11025380","11030300"," They were up here at like 4.46. And then they were down here at 445 flat. "
"11031020","11032340"," Now they don't want to give this up."
"11032480","11033960"," If you're a bear, you don't want to give this up."
"11033960","11039400"," You could give up maybe the 4.46. But you certainly don't want to give up these gains. "
"11040060","11045040"," Like when you see these gains here on the ball trigger, you don't want to be giving this up."
"11045240","11046140"," This line right here."
"11046500","11048560"," This is kind of like a tug of war between the bulls and the bears. "
"11049100","11051160"," And the bears do not want to give this up."
"11051360","11057280"," They want to the bears do want to at some point defend this line."
"11058020","11059800"," We said this about the bulls too, right?"
"11059800","11066700"," We want to see you want to be capturing the bulls in here and reverse course down at some point. "
"11067340","11071860"," Now if we come back up here, the bulls take this over."
"11072480","11073260"," Bears are going to lose."
"11074360","11075760"," Good try though by the bears. "
"11077220","11078240"," I'm going to give it to you."
"11078280","11079860"," I'm on the seats of my pants right now."
"11080000","11081060"," I'll fucking tell you for sure. "
"11081620","11082100"," I'm scared."
"11082900","11084240"," I'll tell you that I'm scared."
"11094600","11097340"," These are the moments where if you do sell, not always. "
"11097540","11101880"," Not right now, but these are the moments where if I pull the fucking trigger and cut it loose, we"
"11101880","11103700"," end up going up another 50 to 100 points."
"11103740","11104660"," And I'm like, fuck."
"11104900","11105800"," I lost all my money. "
"11107080","11109280"," So I'm not pulling the trigger."
"11109320","11110200"," I'm staying right here."
"11110580","11111360"," Long this market. "
"11111720","11112040"," For sure."
"11139530","11141270"," Vic's topping out a little bit."
"11142070","11143130"," Not a previous high. "
"11145710","11148290"," Vic's had a previous high on the 20th."
"11149090","11150130"," Right at 2136."
"11152010","11158810"," And then if you get above the, if you guys look on VIX right now, the VIX is tapping a"
"11158810","11163150"," previous high on, I think it's, I think it was April 19th. "
"11163150","11167490"," And then the steep sell off there."
"11168450","11176190"," If that gap would have be filled, it would take the VIX all the way up to 22, 27."
"11176190","11181370"," And that's going back to, that's the same day on the 19th. "
"11181910","11183870"," That's going to be giving back all of those gains."
"11184390","11188810"," You'd be giving back like, you look on spice though."
"11189990","11191770"," Let's take a look on the 19th. "
"11193250","11196570"," You're talking about a quick, quick trip much lower."
"11198410","11200050"," And this is the same day."
"11200390","11206930"," This is the same day that you had with the TLT, you'd be tagging out down below it. "
"11207010","11208630"," All right, 118."
"11210250","11212870"," It bottomed here, but 118 on TLT."
"11213150","11217150"," You saw the VIX just collapsed and we traded higher. "
"11217510","11223330"," So I guess, you know what, if you break this here, you could be looking, if the VIX is able"
"11223330","11230250"," to get above, you'd be looking for a price target down below, not 440, but 435, which would be"
"11230250","11230650"," huge."
"11231530","11234210"," I mean, this move in one day would be fucking monstrous."
"11234950","11236610"," In one fucking day, right?"
"11236890","11237790"," 450 to 435. "
"11238890","11243250"," Give all that back and one day would be fucking crazy town."
"11243910","11246130"," At least looking at the VIX from where we are right now."
"11246630","11247450"," I don't know. "
"11247570","11248330"," I don't think we do it."
"11250330","11256010"," But if you did it today, if you sold down at 435 today, that would be fucking soul crushing."
"11257010","11260710"," I'm wondering what the low was on that day on Tesla too. "
"11261290","11263670"," All right, so we could look at Tesla back on that day too."
"11266430","11267490"," On the 19th."
"11267550","11269850"," I mean, that's not that bad of a day for Tesla. "
"11270110","11277890"," The low on Tesla, you could put some of this just to earnings reports, but you'd put Tesla down"
"11277890","11279650"," here at Reddit 1000."
"11280730","11283090"," You'd have a tag at 1000 on Tesla."
"11283870","11293150"," And furthermore, the neat part is that the cash gap fill would be 973, which would be wild if we"
"11293150","11296930"," traded all the way down here to 1000, especially if it was a one full day. "
"11299310","11300670"," Yeah, be over."
"11300870","11301150"," What is that?"
"11301210","11302130"," A hundred point move, right?"
"11302630","11303490"," 30 plus nine."
"11303570","11304190"," It's 110. "
"11304630","11311650"," It would be a 110 point move down fully from peak to trough."
"11312810","11313290"," Huge."
"11313610","11318490"," If you moved a hundred points up today and a hundred points down on Tesla, that's a 10% move"
"11318490","11320650"," each way in just two days. "
"11320650","11321690"," That would be insane."
"11327810","11332090"," Gotta get Papa J pow out there at one o'clock and pump the markets up for us."
"11337980","11339240"," We'll see if this breaks. "
"11339520","11340960"," They're trying for it for sure."
"11341540","11345920"," You can see the attempt to try to push lower and break through here."
"11354500","11357200"," We'll watch the spy and see if they can break through. "
"11366730","11369690"," Let's take a look at the puts coming in right now."
"11369690","11371630"," Just continuous put."
"11371790","11373330"," Just continuous put calls. "
"11375130","11379950"," What I've put those switch to neutral to 61% neutral."
"11380470","11383670"," You've got six million dollars in spy puts."
"11384350","11388870"," Five million dollars in em puts on two orders. "
"11389510","11391730"," Two is only two point six million dollars."
"11391870","11395750"," Not a lot of flow on against the market."
"11395750","11401130"," Lots of dip buyers still on the call side of things. "
"11402190","11404110"," Just tons of call buyers."
"11407440","11410540"," Markets still showing put in call ratio that were neutral."
"11411460","11413520"," We're at 60% I believe right now. "
"11414440","11415220"," So you'll look and see."
"11415800","11424920"," We're at 61% call flow 209,000 calls to 175,900 puts."
"11440360","11442280"," Wild to see this today. "
"11443080","11449170"," Break below a break below 450."
"11450630","11455010"," So spot gamma support not holding at 450."
"11456210","11457890"," Not good neutral. "
"11458510","11463190"," This makes sense that we are neutral at this point in the put call ratio."
"11464090","11465470"," You can't really give it."
"11465590","11466550"," We're going down here. "
"11466650","11467330"," We're going up."
"11467890","11473150"," This is anticipated today that we can trade down to 450 as a level of support."
"11473630","11479210"," If we break through here, this zone right here, man, this is not good as a bull. "
"11480350","11481090"," At all."
"11481990","11483490"," This is not good."
"11483790","11484190"," No bueno. "
"11485450","11486530"," Give you a bull."
"11487290","11488090"," Not at all."
"11488330","11489030"," This is a great trade. "
"11489290","11489670"," I missed it."
"11489750","11491070"," I did not take this trade down."
"11491710","11497810"," I'm too concerned about buying the dips here for a larger rip higher off off of this. "
"11498950","11503150"," So that's my concern is that we're trading way up here on Friday."
"11504130","11507450"," So I will pay attention to this as the day moves forward."
"11507870","11508990"," It's now 1227. "
"11509650","11514370"," J-PAL speaks at 1 p.m. So I'm going to take a quick break and get some lunch."
"11514650","11515650"," I haven't even shipped today."
"11516750","11518010"," I fell asleep. "
"11518550","11520550"," Didn't have any dinner last night and then we'll back up."
"11521910","11523830"," Make sure I made all that fucking money."
"11526310","11530270"," And we'll see if the bears, we'll see if the bears, we're going to keep this here too. "
"11530990","11535850"," Because this is going, I think this is going to matter today as well."
"11536430","11537450"," So I'll keep the stream up."
"11537550","11545130"," Of course, I've got the, I've got a, I've got a trade the news on for you. "
"11545130","11546430"," I'm just going to grab a quick bite to eat."
"11547270","11549950"," And I think we can get J-PAL live at one o'clock."
"11550230","11552650"," If I can't, I'll try to set up while I'm eating my sandwich. "
"11553170","11557170"," I'll try to set up the zoom call and see if I can get him live at least."
"11557830","11563730"," Because you do want to hear the, you want to hear the Q and A part of his talks."
"11564390","11566830"," He usually does like a round table with someone. "
"11567750","11569610"," The interviewer usually throws softball questions."
"11570010","11571630"," Then you get the fuck up questions at the end."
"11572630","11576950"," As we do want to watch those, we want, we want to watch that round table discussion. "
"11577550","11583590"," And it is poignant that he brought up Paul Volker on a, or his, his love for Paul Volker."
"11585710","11589030"," I'm going to take a quick look right now and just see if the breath has gone down at all"
"11589030","11590490"," in the market as well."
"11591430","11595350"," And before we take a break here, just keep an eye on this. "
"11596870","11598590"," Battleground for the bulls and bears."
"11599190","11602950"," Hands down battleground for the bulls and bears right now."
"11606160","11606720"," Impressive. "
"11607320","11608620"," Congratulations bears."
"11609360","11611400"," Bears took back, dude, this trade right here."
"11611980","11614960"," Crazy part is I made more money, right?"
"11615760","11618960"," On some of these moves in total yesterday. "
"11620140","11621540"," That one, this one."
"11622080","11623580"," I did not take this trade."
"11623760","11625100"," I was looking to buy this. "
"11625100","11627200"," I missed this trade right here."
"11627300","11628320"," Wait, let me clean this up."
"11629020","11630640"," So I made decent money in here. "
"11632640","11637020"," This trade right here, I did not take, but this trade paid 600%."
"11637600","11642140"," This down move yesterday, not 100% or even 200%."
"11642140","11644680"," This one right here was 600%. "
"11646060","11649020"," Now I missed that trade, but I did miss this last one."
"11649460","11654480"," But I did grab this one here and I made by 300% on this trade right here."
"11656240","11659020"," And I still have calls down the road. "
"11659580","11665380"," And I bought the dip here and I bought the dip here and here."
"11666040","11668080"," I haven't bought any of this yet down here."
"11670920","11675180"," So we'll see if the, we'll see if the, I mean, this is a beautiful fucking trade right here. "
"11676660","11682060"," We'll see though if the bears can maintain the bears want to, the bears want to see the bears are"
"11682060","11683280"," here somewhere in this vicinity."
"11683280","11686260"," The bears want to defend this and send this lower."
"11686840","11691700"," And if the bears do defend this here, I will jump in a short trade and take this, take this"
"11691700","11691960"," down. "
"11693800","11695420"," But I'm not going to take this trade right now."
"11695700","11699260"," I'm going to wait for Papa Powell and see what he has to say."
"11701140","11702960"," Tell you back in one half an hour. "
"11703300","11704940"," If the market continues to sell off."
"11709490","11710950"," Yeah, breath is still higher today."
"11712370","11714750"," The breath is still higher today. "
"11716030","11717550"," It's still rotating in today."
"11717670","11719510"," So I'm still in the bulk case right now."
"11721670","11722670"," I'm just believe it or not. "
"11722690","11723510"," I'm still in the bulk case."
"11724190","11725310"," So what we'll do is this."
"11726350","11729030"," If you were to correlate this back, there's two things you want to know. "
"11729430","11729810"," Break them back."
"11730930","11735250"," If you're a bear, you want to see a break of the previous low, not a touch."
"11735570","11740830"," You don't want to see 443.48. You don't want to see 443.47. You want to see a little"
"11740830","11742130"," dip the toes down here. "
"11742130","11744490"," This is the technical aspect of stuff, right?"
"11744870","11746430"," You want to see a little tiny break down here."
"11747990","11749630"," Because that gives your lower low, right?"
"11749810","11750590"," That's your case, right?"
"11750810","11753310"," We peak and we now have lower lows."
"11753590","11758630"," If you don't see that little touch down here, you want to see a little tiny break right below. "
"11763560","11764920"," This builds the bear case."
"11765240","11766920"," Notice how it's just touchy touchy down there?"
"11767800","11768740"," Still hasn't broke."
"11769160","11770520"," You want to see that today, okay?"
"11771360","11773720"," If you don't see that today, it's not good for your case. "
"11774280","11777540"," The last thing about today is..."
"11778520","11779260"," Hold on here."
"11784790","11789090"," The last thing you're looking for today is you're going to be looking for a rejection."
"11790110","11792570"," If I don't get back, I'll be back in half an hour. "
"11793150","11800670"," If you start to see rejections here, like this, like one, two, and then three, it'll come down,"
"11800810","11801010"," okay?"
"11802630","11805670"," If you don't see a rejection, you start to see goopy stuff like that."
"11805670","11808730"," If you start to see this instead, start to see something like this."
"11810450","11814050"," Anything, a kind of nonsense like that, full case, back out again, okay?"
"11814550","11816290"," I'll be right back here in half an hour. "
"11816430","11817610"," I don't think this happens right now."
"11818130","11822610"," Now, if we do do this rejection down here, I was giving you a price target of 440."
"11823690","11824670"," I think it's lower. "
"11824950","11825970"," I think it's easy."
"11827470","11828370"," I think it's..."
"11828370","11831950"," If this happens, I think it's easy to get to 435."
"11832770","11834850"," Yeah, I have 440. "
"11835370","11836230"," It's actually 435."
"11836710","11841430"," I think you could have a bloodbath today or tomorrow into 435, and this doesn't help."
"11842230","11845630"," So I'll get my bear on over here for another 100 points down, not 100. "
"11846350","11848010"," But yeah, you know what I'm talking about."
"11851510","11852530"," Easily, pull 35."
"11853050","11854310"," You can easily pull 440. "
"11854770","11859690"," You can easily, easily get to 435 if this is not held by bulls."
"11861050","11861450"," Easily."
"11862530","11863870"," So I'm still along this market. "
"11864110","11864750"," I bought two dips."
"11864970","11865830"," I didn't buy this dip."
"11866130","11868230"," I probably should have bought this dip, but I didn't buy it. "
"11868670","11870770"," And we'll see if this continues higher or not."
"11882740","11885020"," And keep your eyes on where the bulls..."
"11885020","11885500"," See this?"
"11885500","11885900"," See this?"
"11886080","11886080"," See this?"
"11886080","11886660"," See this red bar?"
"11887300","11890060"," You see when these red bars step in at any point?"
"11898890","11902050"," If at any point you see a big red bar jump above here, like this."
"11902270","11902630"," See this?"
"11902630","11903290"," See this right here?"
"11903290","11905810"," See this turn into a red bar or something?"
"11905890","11910050"," You'll be looking for the bears to jump back in and try to reverse this trade. "
"11921810","11928670"," That's Bullard, the hawk in the center, repeating that he favors a 3.5% rate based on the Taylor"

"12854920","12858500"," They're also working on a next round of Russia sanctions in the EU. "
"12858800","12863320"," It's 4550, so SPX has broken through at this point."
"12863500","12865420"," It's just starting to break through ES right now."
"12867220","12871740"," Bailey says that we must ask whether a series of price shocks is affecting inflation expectations. "
"12877510","12879950"," I got some pizza warming up in the oven right now."
"12880950","12883350"," So I got to get back off here in just a minute."
"12886230","12887930"," I'll leave this one up right here for you. "
"12901140","12905180"," This was like call buying at 12 o'clock and starting to roll again right here."

"12928900","12930540"," You got all the hawks out today. "
"12931440","12932900"," Makes you wonder why all the hawks are up."
"12932900","12935520"," Bailey says that the question is whether U.K.'s labor market will slow down."
"12936000","12940600"," No buyers until 441 down below. "

"12954140","12956500"," is my cell trigger. "
"12957840","12963640"," Because I think you start to see down here 10.20. A free fall down."
"12963780","12967120"," Bailey says he's looking to see whether businesses intend to hoard labor."
"12970170","12975050"," We'll see if that 10.30 holds or if we start selling rapidly down to 1000. "
"12978210","12980010"," They are pushing without a doubt."
"12980230","12981230"," The bears are on."

"13354160","13358880"," BUE's Bailey says that we are seeing some increase in medium term inflation expectations, but that"
"13358880","13360540"," doesn't amount to a de anchoring. "

"13371540","13377020"," Also, the VIX still trying to close that gap from the 19th back up to 22 27."

"13465960","13467040"," on the 19th."
"13469200","13470900"," So we've got this low here. "
"13471320","13473860"," We've got this low just down below here at 420."
"13474660","13475880"," 428 for it."
"13476060","13477140"," 429 right here. "
"13477700","13480420"," I think this was after the bell."
"13481360","13487480"," Yeah, so this is this is after the bell the next low or the next low is way back down"
"13487480","13487740"," here."
"13488240","13489280"," Way back down here. "
"13489280","13496100"," 437 about two days prior could be a violent violent day ahead of us."

"13502800","13504080"," It's probably done for this moment. "
"13504560","13506680"," But dude, this is not good for the bulls."
"13507100","13510380"," It's not what bulls want to see right here at all."
"13511000","13512660"," This is a break below the volatility level. "
"13513300","13518880"," Technically speaking, you are below technically speaking no matter where we go higher here."
"13518880","13523180"," Even if we have a snapback here, we are in a bear town now."
"13524040","13528160"," This is all bull town above and this down here is bear town. "
"13528340","13529560"," You're in bear country."
"13530000","13531300"," Welcome to the bear motel."
"13532740","13538260"," We promise there's not lots of roaches or anything down in here, but I do tell you right here that"
"13538260","13542200"," where we are currently, this is heavy bear town. "
"13542460","13547540"," You sell any rip down here and take the short from this point forward."
"13554980","13564100"," The five-year tips drawing minus 0.340%, 56.8%, a lot of behind it to cover a 2.7,"
"13564240","13568720"," 3 in directs, 89.5% direct bed at 4%."
"13805180","13809040"," Damn, where I thought I was taking the money and running off that opening bell, I didn't know that"
"13809040","13810240"," the entire fucking market was in the middle. "
"13810240","13814160"," The market was in fact, it's not as far behind the curve as you think we are."
"13815420","13816180"," The entire."
"13817200","13820800"," I was like, oh, yeah, I'm like, I'm going to take all my fucking money and run up here. "
"13821480","13824780"," I threw some more money in over here, but not barely what we made."
"13825080","13828400"," But I didn't think the entire fucking market would sell all this out."
"13828580","13829500"," Look at that shit show. "
"13830800","13831680"," That's insane."
"13832480","13834580"," I definitely wasn't seeing that that deep."
"13836620","13837320"," That's amazing. "
"13838180","13843320"," And it could easily give all this up down here easily come back down here."
"13844280","13849240"," There's some dip buyers stepping in right now, but it could be market liquidation."
"13850600","13851740"," We go all the way down here. "
"13851800","13854680"," I'm not positive in this part, but any kind of moves up here."
"13855940","13857540"," Any kind of moves at this point."
"13858060","13859980"," Have you seen any kind of nonsense like this?"
"13861220","13863300"," It's definitely sell the rip. "
"13863420","13864080"," The regime is on."
"13864820","13866700"," This is market liquidation to some extent."
"13867420","13872600"," When you start to give up any of this trade here, now you're starting to give up this trade back"
"13872600","13872960"," here. "
"13872960","13874480"," This is pretty big."
"13874780","13877840"," Big moves in the market right now without a doubt."
"13878480","13880580"," I did not see this trade at all. "
"13881220","13882720"," I was buying the dips up here."
"13883160","13884700"," I didn't buy this dip or this dip here."
"13884740","13887440"," I wanted to see if this held up and none of this held. "
"13888380","13891140"," I'm kind of grateful that I didn't keep buying the dip all the way down."
"13891800","13894220"," But this here, I mean, this move right here."
"13895020","13897040"," This is easy to beat right here. "
"13897460","13899320"," This is all gappy right here."
"13900200","13902640"," It means nothing to come back down here."
"13902640","13904420"," Now we could stop here, come back up here. "
"13904980","13907320"," But given this up here is nothing."
"13907880","13909860"," Easy peasy getting rid of this down here."
"13910220","13911400"," Then we did spend some time. "
"13911720","13912100"," Hold on here."
"13915470","13916350"," Stuff gets wonky."
"13916950","13919670"," We did spend a little bit of time down in here. "
"13919990","13923170"," You can see that we based out down here between 440 and 435."
"13924050","13925870"," But it would be nothing to come on down to 440."
"13926850","13930870"," And nothing to grind down from 440 to 435. "
"13931550","13931710"," Easy."
"13931710","13935950"," This whole this whole this whole action right here is nothing."
"13936750","13939170"," Just a big old cut short covering right here. "
"13940130","13944190"," This means nothing for us to get down to 435 from where we are right now."
"13945030","13946350"," Huge day for bears."
"13946610","13949250"," This this day for bears is bigger than. "
"13949930","13950350"," Yeah."
"13950650","13952050"," One to it's bigger than this move."
"13952170","13958690"," One, two, three, three days plus consolidation is a massive move for bears. "
"13958690","13961970"," And furthermore, this this is the bears trying to tell you."
"13962350","13963090"," Fuck you."
"13963230","13963970"," We ain't going up there. "
"13965010","13966410"," We're just fucking crazy."
"13967150","13970710"," You're giving all this up and it's only 130 in the afternoon."
"13970710","13974050"," So we figured 930 in a four hour period you've given up. "
"13974150","13976110"," Well, we've given up two days."
"13977450","13981390"," Almost two days of three days almost, I guess, because we moved up."
"13981710","13983410"," This was a huge move down here. "
"13985250","13987210"," We bought this down here yesterday."
"13987730","13992090"," Oh, this dip and that you know, this is overnight."
"13992390","13996870"," But this right here, you move this down to like to at least 440. "
"13997290","13999170"," You could do this down to 440 all day long."
"14000630","14003710"," And even even then start grinding down to 435."
"14004070","14007190"," And one day you can do this, which is fucking mind blowing. "
"14030530","14032650"," It's territory growth projection for this year."
"14032890","14039490"," As you said, 3.6%. Let's remember that was the average growth rate between 2011 and 2019."
"14040810","14046350"," We have a only small handful of countries that are in negative territory. "
"14047110","14051270"," Among them, Ukraine devastated shrinking by 40%."
"14051830","14058730"," Russia very significantly impacted 11% below what we projected in October."
"14058730","14068670"," But I'm going to mute this lady here, but I haven't seen if J-Pows in there"
"14068670","14068870"," yet. "
"14068930","14069670"," There he is over there."
"14069730","14070310"," There's J-Pow."
"14071170","14073470"," So if he starts to talk, I'll bring him back up. "
"14092060","14093800"," We'll see if we base it out down here."
"14093880","14096660"," This looks like some buyers have stepped in down below."
"14097020","14097840"," Some liquidity down below. "
"14098020","14099920"," We'll see if this holds or not."
"14147860","14150440"," Arise in the inflation numbers."
"14150440","14155660"," And certainly when we look at the risks, there's cute to the downside for growth. "
"14156020","14160540"," So there might be more cuts to come and to the upside for inflation."
"14161020","14161580"," That's where we are."
"14161800","14168500"," And it's particularly saddening not only because of the death, not because of the destruction, not"
"14168500","14173240"," because of the devastation, which in and of itself is of course for huge concern. "
"14178500","14187360"," But it's also causing harm throughout the world, predominantly in Europe for the moment."
"14187840","14193300"," But there will be ripple effects going way beyond Europe."
"14193960","14199120"," For the moment as you said, geography plays a role and Europe is literally next door. "
"14199660","14201760"," Ukraine is one of us."
"14202520","14208160"," And taking this horrible hit, we are seeing refugees."
"14208440","14212480"," Take a look here and see many of our European shores and countries. "
"14213340","14217500"," And we have to, by solidarity, do everything we can to support them."
"14218560","14221120"," That's the situation that we have at the moment in Europe."
"14221600","14222280"," It is particularly..."
"14222280","14224320"," 441, some buyers down here. "
"14224320","14231780"," The recovery that we were embarking on is being stalled to a certain degree."
"14232560","14236620"," Still some sellers sitting up above here, a little bit of resistance above right where we are."
"14236680","14240160"," And does ban Russian oil gas and coal. "
"14240660","14241780"," What would happen to the European economy?"
"14241980","14248160"," Well, let me just first of all salute the sanctions that were decided on a pretty global basis."
"14248880","14253840"," Sanctions against the oligarchs, sanctions against the family members and the people at the origin"
"14253840","14254080"," of it."
"14254080","14256260"," 447, 40th, the original seller. "
"14258180","14263240"," D-swifting of about 80% of the banking sector of Ukraine, of Russia."
"14263520","14264840"," Let's see if that 450 is still there."
"14264920","14270780"," Three of the assets of the national center of Russia that could be identified outside of Russia. "
"14272120","14274520"," So these, this bulk of..."
"14274520","14276340"," The large seller of 447..."
"14276340","14282360"," A set of sanctions decided one after the other, has clearly had a massive impact on Russia."
"14283080","14285360"," And we'll continue to have an impact."
"14285620","14286440"," And I think we will..."
"14286440","14288540"," The more it's rolled out..."
"14289120","14293880"," With regards to sanctions to continue to have a massive impact on Russia. "
"14294200","14295360"," And considering is..."
"14296000","14298860"," European recovery is being stalled to a certain degree."
"14299460","14300460"," The gas on the other hand."
"14300720","14306840"," I think the issue of coal has been addressed by the Europeans together who've decided to ban coal"
"14306840","14308660"," coming out of Russia. "
"14308660","14311020"," And, you know, I think it's a process."
"14311480","14316660"," And I would not exclude the coal decisions to come as it unfolds."
"14317500","14324560"," Well, if that's full of things, if I basically have been done and the world doesn't come to an end,"
"14324560","14325840"," it happens. "
"14325840","14329880"," We have to address inflation and there are concerns globally about the tightening of monetary"
"14329880","14330380"," policy."
"14331380","14332260"," What's the U.S. outlook?"
"14332620","14335660"," And how are you feeling right now about..."
"14335660","14340300"," That Chair Powell now speaking from the IMF panel saying that we're unified with allies in opposing"
"14340300","14342140"," the Ukraine invasion."

"14349200","14350680"," And the human suffering that's going on there."
"14350780","14355860"," And while these economic matters are important, there are very fundamental things at stake there"
"14355860","14357180"," that we want to keep."
"14357180","14361680"," The Palestinians economy is a bit more remote from the effects of the war. "
"14362160","14367140"," You feel effects of war with upward inflation effects."
"14368480","14372740"," But we will be feeling them over time and they will come in the form of upward pressure on"
"14372740","14376720"," inflation, further upward pressure, and a bit of downward pressure on output."
"14377360","14380460"," But the U.S. economy is very strong, performing very well. "
"14380460","14385140"," By most forecasts, we'll have another strong growth here this year."
"14385480","14389820"," The labor market is extraordinarily tight, extremely tight historically so."
"14390600","14397220"," And to the point where really there's an imbalance between supply and demand for workers. "
"14397220","14400540"," And the economy is performing strongly and the labor market means tight."
"14400920","14403360"," And getting inflation back down to it."
"14404160","14405360"," First of all, first of all, first of all, first of all, first of all, first of all, first of"

"14463320","14467460"," all, first of all, first of specific market pricing for things, but I will just say this at our"
"14467460","14473220"," last meeting, and this was in the minutes from the meeting, many, many on the committee thought it"
"14473220","14476380"," would be appropriate for there to be one or more 50 basis point hikes. "
"14476380","14477540"," Are you one of those people?"
"14477540","14482100"," Watching weakness right now in the spot on a poor 40, even this level of $4.40 is weak."
"14482180","14488020"," So I think just so you can see that these buyers that are here at $4.41 and even $4 "
"14488020","14490620",".40, not huge particular market pricing."
"14491290","14498240"," There's more buyers to bolster down here at $3.39 to $4.00, but even this level down here, this"
"14498240","14498840"," was all weak. "
"14499820","14505880"," We supplied not math of 25 basis point hikes from 2004 to 2006."
"14505960","14508580"," We actually see inflation was a little over 3%."
"14508580","14510340"," So inflation is much higher now. "
"14510340","14512040"," It's kind of big down here for 40."
"14512480","14514340"," It's absolutely essential to restore price stability."
"14515040","14519140"," Coming in right now committed to getting back to 2% inflation. "
"14519140","14522860"," So inflation says pal markets are interacting appropriately to our communications."
"14524160","14527060"," 50 basis points will be on the table for the immediate system."
"14527640","14533620"," This support here for 40 is still not as appropriate to be moving more quickly. "
"14534060","14535040"," It's not this here."
"14535120","14542180"," It's seeking the fresh lows of pal's comments ratify 50 basis point relief at the next meeting."
"14542460","14545140"," China right now with these aggressive lockdowns. "
"14545140","14548960"," As it relates to your economy and the region and emerging market."
"14548960","14551740"," But the C440 and $4.39 is possible."
"14552120","14554660"," And China, the two biggest economy in the world. "
"14555160","14560280"," Whatever happened in these two economies definitely have a spill over to the rest of the world."
"14561000","14566160"," First, I think what Chairman Powell mentioned about the challenge to stabilize."
"14566460","14567560"," And see it right here even better. "
"14567600","14572220"," Right inflation down definitely will require monetary tightening."
"14572220","14574460"," And this support here is not bolster."
"14574880","14575960"," This is not huge support. "
"14576200","14578200"," You'd see a big red line coming through here."
"14578220","14579140"," You do see one here."
"14579460","14583140"," Today's point right next are all the table, particularly in May. "
"14583560","14586120"," But not like you would down below 435."
"14586740","14592640"," As many policy makers in the emerging country and developing country need to prepare for this"
"14592640","14593420"," eventuality."
"14593860","14595800"," I think that's one very important thing. "
"14595800","14604020"," In Indonesia case, back in the paper time from 2013, our situation today is much, much stronger."
"14604820","14609120"," Back then our external balance, the balance of payment in a current account deficit."
"14610060","14617060"," And that's why even when Federal Reserve has not yet moved announcing it, it's already creating a"
"14617060","14618060"," huge trickery. "
"14618460","14620600"," Today in Indonesia again."
"14620880","14622980"," We'll turn her down a little bit."
"14622980","14630560"," But then creating this high commodity price in Indonesia has quite a significant commodity, which"
"14630560","14632460"," is enjoying this high price. "
"14632980","14633740"," So we'll look here."
"14633880","14638440"," We've got some buyers here at 441.9, some more buyers here at 4400."
"14639500","14641780"," And then at 439.50 and 439. "
"14642780","14647140"," But even with that said, you're still not even going to bounce back here."
"14647400","14649400"," This support is not huge."
"14650160","14654020"," You see 50,000, 60,000, limit or 70,000. "
"14654780","14656620"," Not until you get down here though."
"14656940","14658420"," You can kind of see it right there."
"14659100","14662300"," But there's a steep drop down to 435 here. "
"14663000","14663840"," Steep drop."
"14665520","14668360"," Hopefully we are going to be much less effective."
"14668940","14672180"," Although capital outflow is happening already on a bondholder. "
"14672180","14674520"," We'll take a look at that on this chart here."
"14674520","14680640"," We've already reduced the exposure of the foreign ownership on a..."
"14680640","14681580"," Tweezer right here."
"14682400","14686560"," Still would shock me to see some kind of a resistance sellback down here. "
"14687220","14690980"," We'll look to see if the sellers, where the sellers are above here."
"14691040","14693940"," We have the coffee and the policy of lockdown."
"14694400","14696640"," We see 443, 48, 445. "
"14697220","14697820"," We'll take a look at that."
"14698840","14699940"," They're growth outlook."
"14700880","14703980"," Although in this past two days we heard from central bank. "
"14703980","14706320"," 443, 50, some light sellers here."
"14706420","14710040"," We have to do all necessary to make the growth at least..."
"14710040","14711980"," Can seem kind of right here."
"14712040","14713240"," Wrong enough at the level. "
"14713960","14715600"," That definitely also clear."
"14715740","14716600"," 445, 50."
"14716980","14718540"," No real sellers up in here unless they..."
"14718540","14719580"," unless they rug full. "
"14719760","14720540"," It's going to be very deep."
"14720840","14725340"," I mean in Indonesia we implemented this lockdown when we have Delta variant."
"14726120","14730560"," Only two weeks and it really erases the growth on the first quarter. "
"14730820","14732240"," Just general selling above."
"14732240","14735020"," To almost the negative territory."
"14735500","14738340"," So I can imagine that if you prolong this kind of lockdown. "
"14738860","14740660"," Make it a decent bounce back here."
"14740980","14743460"," Especially for 50 as big as possible."
"14743460","14745040"," There's no floor. "
"14745460","14746020"," I'll tell you what."
"14746200","14746920"," Right there we go."
"14747420","14749240"," That's the way that's 447. "
"14749620","14749980"," That's not it."
"14750120","14756240"," Your impact, but these two very important countries will definitely have huge impact for many"
"14756240","14757560"," developing and emerging countries."
"14757560","14763060"," And this is on top of still very difficult recovery for many countries in the world. "
"14763420","14764080"," From this family."
"14764400","14764820"," Although Indonesia."
"14764820","14768260"," Some dip buyers stepping in now, but even so. "
"14769300","14771480"," This floor, this ceiling is weak."
"14771760","14774000"," It's percent above the pre-profit level."
"14774560","14776020"," But Indonesia is a few cases. "
"14776460","14779640"," Many especially struggle as Chris Salina mentioned."
"14780240","14781660"," This looks more like just squeezing."
"14782000","14783480"," This doesn't look like anything like buying. "
"14783480","14789060"," China lockdowns especially Shanghai and Shenzhen that we saw are holding back supply chains even"
"14789060","14790800"," more at this point."
"14791380","14792140"," Well, that's different."
"14792500","14793940"," Nice green bar on the spot. "
"14794320","14795440"," Looks more like short covering."
"14796200","14800260"," There are some levels for you to re-short if it doesn't come back."
"14800760","14803460"," You got one level here at 4-4-3-4-8. "
"14803760","14807740"," You have another level here at 4-4-5-0 and you have another one right here."
"14808140","14812520"," This is originally where the bears stepped in and really pushed down on the market."
"14812520","14816280"," So we'll see if we get a rollback here or here. "
"14816540","14820500"," Sometimes you'll see that it'll come back up to the bears and then roll over higher."
"14821200","14822340"," So we'll see where they are."
"14822340","14824520"," This is where the big short came in. "
"14824960","14828700"," The second push from bears came in right here."
"14829520","14831220"," 11.2% growth."
"14833140","14834260"," Huge move. "
"14835200","14836540"," Congratulations to bears."
"14837000","14839480"," That's a fucking brutal move right there."
"14839480","14843040"," And I'm still up in here with some calls. "
"14843380","14844700"," So I have to see this by tomorrow."
"14845660","14847620"," And you see the bears were here earlier."
"14847700","14848320"," They're still here. "
"14848880","14854760"," If they do close short and they want to come back in short, they could come back in here or"
"14854760","14856660"," they could come back here or even here."
"14856840","14862160"," Oftentimes if you get cotton calls, they'll send it back up here and not get any higher."
"14862880","14863640"," And so you wind up. "
"14863880","14866820"," You might have trapped bulls that want to get out of their calls right here."
"14866820","14870200"," And you'll be down 30% to whatever you paid for these."
"14870580","14874940"," So you will make nothing and you might not even get your money back. "
"14875480","14879140"," Because you're going to lose it in theta heading into Friday."
"14879140","14883520"," In the first year of the pandemic."
"14884060","14888060"," What we are seeing is literally an increase in inflation. "
"14888500","14890200"," And we are down below the."
"14890820","14892900"," We are down below the."
"14899140","14900200"," The ball figure. "
"14900440","14903160"," So we want to see what the reaction is right on four four five."
"14903260","14905240"," This is now turning into a resistance."
"14906080","14907840"," Matter of fact, you just take it all the way to here. "
"14908860","14909500"," We're not here."
"14909620","14912060"," You couldn't take it all the way to there because this is the actual."
"14913940","14915080"," See this right here. "
"14915180","14917980"," This line is this is the downward negative panel that we're in."
"14918500","14920360"," And this right here is the ball figure."
"14920600","14921760"," So we'd say right here. "
"14921760","14923800"," If the players can hold this right here."
"14924660","14929920"," This is not good for the bulls at all."
"14932120","14934280"," So we'll see if the bears can hold on to this. "
"14934640","14939940"," The whole injustice of the moment probably relates to the fact that the enormous."
"14940220","14944840"," And when you're in negative gamma, you do sell reps."
"14945360","14950140"," So every time you see when we whenever we get back out of this regime here, anything like this, we"
"14950140","14951480"," talked about this earlier, you would sell. "
"14952320","14956400"," You'd wait for, you'd wait for a move up and then a rebound of another test."
"14956980","14961240"," One, two, and then the second or third one, you'd see a reversal pattern."
"14963020","14964860"," So you don't want to see this right here. "
"14965280","14966400"," You don't want to see that."
"14967160","14968640"," You don't want to see weakness."
"14969060","14973800"," Like if you have a true reversal, you would see it would just start fucking jamming all the way up. "
"14974540","14975640"," That's short for lifted."
"14976040","14979360"," And you're still seeing the bears push for lower prices."
"14980260","14982780"," More than likely a price target would be 435. "
"14983780","14988560"," As the 440 levels there, but it's weak."
"14989140","14990020"," It's weak."
"14991020","15001020"," It's probably based on the lifting of shorts right here in this zone of a 1.5 degree world. "
"15001020","15006620"," But even if it doesn't get there at 1.2, as you all know, we're already seeing the devastating"
"15006620","15008620"," impact of the storms and the hurricanes."
"15009340","15013580"," But what most people don't know about are the droughts and the surrogacy heat and the destruction"
"15013580","15016140"," of the coral reefs that lead to coastal erosion."
"15016720","15023680"," So at a time when we need to have expenditure more than ever, there is little concessionation in"
"15023680","15024080"," the available. "
"15024500","15029600"," There's little fiscal space available and there's an urgent need for us to seriously reform the"
"15029600","15033040"," international financial institution if we are to be people."
"15033720","15034660"," How's Tesla doing?"
"15035100","15036640"," I haven't looked at Tesla either."
"15037360","15040460"," Tesla bounced right off my stops. "
"15042560","15043000"," Rare."
"15044100","15045340"," I'm still in Tesla."
"15045640","15046160"," I haven't sold it. "
"15046420","15047140"," I'm still holding Tesla."
"15047440","15048160"," I still believe in Tesla."
"15048160","15051040"," I've given myself some room. "
"15051260","15052360"," I figured we have selling today."
"15052520","15054120"," I just didn't know we'd get out on this deep on Tesla."
"15054680","15056740"," I'm still inside spy calls as well. "
"15056900","15057900"," I haven't sold those spy calls."
"15057900","15059100"," I haven't taken any shorts."
"15059580","15060800"," I haven't bought any puts or anything. "
"15061160","15064300"," If we do reject up here, I'll grab some puts."
"15065580","15069580"," But I want to see some confirmation that we reverse here on spy."
"15070700","15074440"," But also on vulnerability to climate shocks. "
"15075300","15085180"," And today at the discussion we had, the resilience and sustainability trust, which will"
"15085180","15095340"," provide long term maturity, finally financing to vulnerable middle countries, got"
"15095340","15096420"," a big boost."
"15097240","15101560"," We signed up already $40 billion for it."
"15102080","15104340"," How much do you think J-Paw gets paid for these things?"
"15104840","15106420"," Probably fucking huge money. "
"15106680","15110420"," Like probably a quarter mail, half mail plus expenses."
"15113480","15114800"," Probably gets $40 million."
"15114800","15117580"," Then he gets probably fucking whatever he wants. "
"15118700","15120500"," Probably just the travel costs."
"15121040","15124520"," $150, $100,000 I'd say."
"15125060","15127680"," Then he probably has some force from security. "
"15128760","15130460"," And then private plane."
"15130880","15134400"," Probably $125,000 to show up or something like that."
"15147380","15149840"," Yeah, I'm listening to these other people talking. "
"15151160","15154840"," They impact the U.S. but not really."
"15156120","15158720"," They depend upon our economy."
"15159240","15160960"," It was cheaper to pay for more. "
"15160960","15163380"," I'm sure covering is still happening here on the spy."
"15163380","15166120"," Because of this dropping in the interstate."
"15167160","15168320"," $22 billion. "
"15169160","15173600"," In $22 we had to grace for quite a number of low income companies."
"15173660","15180500"," This is why you don't sell your goddamn calls so you can fucking salvage your fucking call money."
"15181660","15184760"," Up from action by the countries themselves. "
"15185500","15192460"," Do all you can extend maturity if you have currency mismatches, but also for us."
"15192720","15197500"," We have to help countries."
"15198020","15201760"," Coming up here is going to be an important place for bears here. "
"15202380","15205160"," As we had higher here."
"15206520","15208480"," This is that larger channel."
"15209240","15216900"," I think I might have plotted this with ES, but this channel here, the bears want to maintain"
"15216900","15219100"," control of this zone. "
"15219100","15224920"," We could still trade up to this Volkswagen 4450, but the bears want to maintain control here."
"15225040","15226160"," They don't want to give this up."
"15229260","15231960"," Unless this was just a raid, like a day raid or something. "
"15232200","15234080"," They don't want to keep control of this."
"15237850","15241390"," This is not going away on the country."
"15241790","15243050"," It is getting worse. "
"15243810","15248290"," For stock from countries, this requires..."
"15248290","15250490"," some dip buying going on right now."
"15250510","15251990"," Also some buying of the VIX."
"15252970","15262430"," After VIXpiration, there's some call buying on Tesla, Apple, Spy, but along with a small rasher of"
"15262430","15264190"," UVXY calls as well. "
"15264950","15266530"," It calls on Oxy as well."
"15267430","15270710"," I&T has some calls on it, more Nvidia calls."
"15275790","15281270"," It would be for these countries, for these vulnerable countries, it would be a small..."
"15281270","15282310"," We'll clear this out real quick. "
"15285730","15290810"," We'll see if the bears step in here or not, right where we are."
"15291790","15295490"," We'll take a look and see if the bears step back in if they're committed."
"15295970","15297510"," It doesn't look like they are right now. "
"15298110","15307750"," This guy or...? They're still up here at this 4.47. They both fully equipped to do"
"15307750","15308630"," their jobs."
"15308990","15309550"," It's going on here."
"15309670","15311110"," I don't know why this isn't working here. "
"15312090","15312610"," Yeah."
"15313070","15314230"," I'm going to agree with that."
"15314410","15314830"," Here we go. "
"15315950","15320710"," You're up and dealing with guy-high inflation rates as well, high efficiency in the Eurozone."
"15321790","15327890"," Why are you not sounding as hawkish as chair Powell when it comes to raising interest rates and"
"15327890","15328510"," tackling inflation?"
"15329510","15330170"," Right here."
"15330230","15330930"," A little bit of resistance. "
"15331410","15331870"," Not much though."
"15331990","15332430"," It's not huge."
"15332550","15339230"," I'm carrying this little owl all the time to remind myself that everything that we eventually"
"15339230","15342010"," decide has to be a concerted, coordinated..."
"15342010","15343930"," Some sellers here are still not huge. "
"15344910","15345970"," They're popping in and out here."
"15346050","15346470"," You see him popping?"
"15348030","15353150"," I see these sellers popping in right now between here and 4.46. This is the VWAP up here at"
"15353150","15356750"," 4.46.35. Bears don't want to give this area up."
"15356770","15360770"," You can see them popping in and out trying to lend some resistance where we are. "
"15360770","15363430"," I respect him greatly."
"15363770","15365490"," If we trade above this..."
"15365490","15369510"," These cards in Eurozone and US economies are moving at a different pace."
"15369950","15371410"," It seems they're starting to step in now. "
"15372390","15378170"," If we break above this, you have a price starting above a 4.47.18. Mr. Vice Governor, going on"
"15378170","15383630"," to say that they could revise upward inflation forecast in the next monetary policy meeting."
"15383870","15386750"," I'll let my colleague and Mr. Powell speak for..."
"15386750","15390130"," The card noting Eurozone inflation numbers are very high."
"15392630","15395050"," There's light resistance right here where we are. "
"15395250","15399110"," It'd be like cheap bears like cheap bulls are up higher."
"15399450","15402310"," They're up here at 4.47.17 now."
"15402490","15405570"," They were down here and now they're up here, so we'll leave the bears up here. "
"15406570","15408670"," We'll see if we can make this trade higher."
"15408950","15411830"," Maybe the bears will try to step back down at some point."
"15412630","15415290"," But until that happens, there's light resistance here. "
"15416390","15420730"," We might have a trade back that could go as high as right in here somewhere."
"15421050","15424150"," So that's a supply shock that we are taking."
"15425930","15432250"," If I look at my core inflation, so if you take out food, you take out energy, I'm down to"
"15432250","15432930"," 3%. "
"15432930","15440350"," It is north of my target, which is two, but it is more manageable if I may."
"15441090","15443870"," It's actually 2.9%. Bears, savages."
"15445950","15446910"," Straight savages. "
"15447370","15449810"," I have to give one to the fucking bears on that trade today."
"15450270","15452310"," I figured they'd be a dip-eye down it."
"15452470","15458010"," I mean, this morning we talked about the deepest stretch to go to be 445, but a move down to"
"15458010","15461650"," 441.36 is fucking impressive. "
"15462830","15468850"," And to boot, the will of the bulls cannot hold the line at 445 is pretty big."
"15469370","15473090"," It's quite important here to see that the bulls were willing to give all that up."
"15473530","15476930"," It is much higher than our target. "
"15477330","15480490"," It reminds me a lot of bears when we're in a bull regime."
"15480490","15485950"," From where the market always goes up regime, the bulls bears will come in, attack, and then they're"
"15485950","15486290"," gone."
"15487030","15491550"," And this is almost like that same regime flipped where you see bulls have a good day. "
"15492050","15496650"," They take all their money off the table and run, and the bulls sweep it, swoop our bears, sweep"
"15496650","15501530"," back in, and they just take back over again, back in charge to a solid rip-eye environment."
"15501810","15507310"," When we have our next monetary policy goven in council, at which point we will have to determine"
"15507310","15510270"," when we stop net asset purchases."
"15510950","15511510"," Unreal. "
"15511950","15515630"," Of the third quarter, of course, but when in the third quarter is it going to be early?"
"15516230","15519610"," Is it going to be later to be determined by the data that we see?"
"15520410","15528590"," And that will then lead us to assess whether or not an interest hike is needed, and at what point"
"15528590","15529150"," in time."
"15529690","15537850"," Another note too, bulls are still adding calls on 450Cs, and those are down to 20 cents down."
"15538010","15538830"," They're still on them. "
"15539430","15542790"," Have not released those statistics like diamond-handed 450Cs."
"15543250","15548730"," I'm diamond in mine too, but I'm still impressed that those are being diamond-handed."
"15549030","15555090"," Also note, there's a lot of buying on April 25th for 450C for 50 cents. "
"15555350","15558870"," There's now 20,000 calls being bought there."
"15561770","15564470"," Inflation is one component that for us is."
"15564470","15565190"," Let's take a look here. "
"15565510","15575490"," And on April 27th, there's a concentration of puts on April 27th for 444P, 17 "
"15575490","15576210",",000."
"15576390","15578450"," They look like they're about to be monetized though."
"15578550","15584390"," They're already at $4.72. Doesn't make any sense to me, because once we say that we are data"
"15584390","15589970"," dependent, for goodness' sake, let's wait until we have the data, and then we move on to the side. "
"15589970","15591710"," And we've agreed on the sequence."
"15591710","15595670"," We have to follow that sequence, and apparently that we have embarked upon."
"15596070","15599950"," What about inflation in the U.S.? Some are wondering if it's heat. "
"15600830","15601510"," Do you think so?"
"15601790","15608730"," Also note that there's 45,000 calls on April 29th for 460C for 18 cents."
"15609490","15610970"," I'm going to buy some of those right now."
"15611230","15612390"," We find a couple of things. "
"15612570","15614810"," First is inflation is really a global problem."
"15615030","15617590"," It's quite everywhere, and it's high in most places."
"15617590","15618930"," But there are differences. "
"15619070","15619870"," There are certainly differences."
"15620150","15624950"," So in the United States, we have very strong growth, and we have higher inflation."
"15625170","15627870"," We have higher core inflation than Europe does, for example. "
"15628370","15629330"," We also came into this."
"15629570","15631870"," Europe has struggled more than we have with..."
"15631870","15636410"," That's Powell saying that he had expectation that inflation would peak around at this time."
"15636410","15637670"," Level of underlying inflation. "
"15638050","15638590"," So there's just differences."
"15638970","15640830"," Inflation is a really global problem."
"15641530","15646890"," So in the case of the United States, there are differences between regions that inflation would..."
"15646890","15652550"," I don't think it wants to see actual progress on inflation coming down and seeing that expectation"
"15652550","15654850"," inflation would peak around at this time. "
"15655150","15659690"," These expectations have been disappointed in the past, and so now we're really in wanting to see"
"15659690","15660550"," actual progress."
"15661410","15665790"," It may be that the actual peak was in March, but we don't know that, and so we're not going"
"15665790","15666450"," to count on it."
"15666930","15671950"," And we're also no longer going to count on help from supply side healing. "
"15672710","15674310"," If we get that, that would be great."
"15674310","15678190"," And I think that would be enormously helpful in having a soft landing."
"15678370","15686570"," But we're really going to be raising rates and getting to levels in March, but we will actually not"
"15686570","15689750"," count on it as a policy if that turns into appropriate ones. "
"15689890","15693610"," It may be that the peak was in March, but we won't count on it."
"15693830","15695350"," So we're going to talk about this in a minute."
"15695810","15697690"," The fact that expectations have been disappointed. "
"15698310","15702430"," So many commodities that we need and we don't know how long this war is going to go on."
"15702430","15706270"," So what's interesting about that comment from Jay Powell is..."
"15706270","15712870"," Powell reiterating that we'll raise rates getting expeditiously to a more neutral level."
"15713050","15715190"," Of course, can't affect supply side issues. "
"15715450","15716610"," We really can't affect much."
"15716930","15718650"," We'll talk about that when that's a good thing."
"15718950","15719870"," We'll go to tight policy if appropriate. "
"15720250","15722270"," What we can do is our tools work on demand."
"15723070","15727390"," But we have a job to do on demand, and I'll point to the labor market."
"15727390","15734090"," There are substantially more job openings than there are people who are unemployed. "
"15734730","15739410"," And if you take total employed people plus job openings, that's demand for labor."
"15740030","15746690"," If you look at the HAI supply so we've got a demand supply in balance."
"15746690","15751070"," If it's always in bond markets, it's clear and that comes from a number of..."
"15751070","15752850"," We're not looking like a safe place to be. "
"15752850","15757690"," What we did at the height of the crisis, so there is a demand job to do, but you're right,"
"15757850","15759610"," we can't fix supply-side problems."
"15760370","15764730"," I don't live in a demand that's flying balance in the labor market and elsewhere."
"15765050","15770190"," You know, I never would point to one particular price or asset or class of assets, but generally"
"15770190","15773910"," the way our policy works is we control one overnight rate. "
"15773910","15778810"," We're bringing in on the floor that is infusing, and it goes forward, that, government-facing, and"
"15778810","15779670"," actual financial conditions."
"15780070","15784910"," And that includes asset prices that include credit availability, risk spreads, all kinds of"
"15784910","15785710"," financial conditions."
"15786230","15788870"," How are you noting the financial benefits and supply-side problems?"
"15788870","15791910"," Those are what affect the real economy, so we monitor financial conditions. "
"15792610","15795510"," So there really are two steps that are tightening in financial conditions."
"15795750","15801650"," One of the many, there are many different combinations that are possible of financial conditions,"
"15801650","15803350"," and we have seen some tightening."
"15803350","15806550"," From our, you know, from our rate increases, and that's to be expected. "
"15807230","15812670"," The people that have this idea, President Lagarde, that you guys need to shock the markets to"
"15812670","15818410"," really start to seem more of an impact when it comes to putting pressure on demand and on"
"15818410","15818730"," inflation."
"15819230","15820770"," Is that something you've described too?"
"15820990","15828270"," I think what we need to do is communicate with as much clarity as possible as to what we analyze,"
"15828810","15830830"," what we see, what timing we have in life."
"15831510","15834830"," And what journey we embarking on. "
"15835090","15839550"," And, you know, for us, it's not so much an issue of tightening, when we look at the real rate."
"15839710","15845870"," It's an issue of normalizing monetary policy, and using the tools that we have."
"15846510","15852050"," I think the added dimension that Europe has is that it's a monetary union with the complexity of a"
"15852050","15858370"," monetary union, where you have 19 different fiscal policies, 19 different treasuries, and that"
"15858370","15860430"," makes my job just a little bit more. "
"15860430","15866890"," I'm going to turn this down for a minute because the one comment from Powell that was interesting"
"15866890","15871110"," to me was he was almost reactionary."
"15871710","15876870"," He's talking about how he's going to continue that they thinks that inflation peaked in March."
"15877890","15880990"," Gardening your exchange rate clearly has an impact on inflation. "
"15883450","15886950"," It needs to be policies about normalization and not tightening."
"15891330","15899930"," The interesting part about Powell's speech there is that he's acknowledging and saying, well, we"
"15899930","15902230"," know that we spent too much money."
"15902410","15903790"," We can see that now. "
"15904830","15910590"," But we thought that we think that we're passed inflation, but we're not going to stop on the course"
"15910590","15914170"," that we're on, regardless if inflation has peaked."
"15915090","15921430"," Which is an interesting statement because oftentimes you'll hear on social media."
"15921590","15926150"," Specifically, there's always talk of, they're always that the Fed's always late, right?"
"15926610","15929090"," The Fed's always late once we need money. "
"15929350","15930170"," They put too much on."
"15930350","15930850"," They do too much."
"15931510","15935090"," They're like a hammer on attack. "
"15935990","15937430"," They're late to the party."
"15937990","15940170"," They didn't stop the spending early enough."
"15940170","15941930"," Puts us in this position. "
"15942310","15945610"," And now he's committed to raising rates."
"15945610","15947030"," That is dangerous."
"15947830","15951250"," That statement to our economy and to our stock market. "
"15954110","15960350"," And not actually, I don't know if he meant that statement and how he was saying it, but what he"
"15960350","15965010"," is saying to some extent is we're on our course regardless."
"15967490","15973610"," That is similar to when they turn the money printer on and they leave it on for too long, right?"
"15974250","15982690"," You end up, you end up taxing and you end up raising rates and becoming more an accommodative, even"
"15982690","15985430"," give it risks recession."
"15985430","15992470"," And so just like you see the pendulum swing in our economy is inflated, right?"
"15992730","15998670"," That huge inflation that does trigger the next fear from market participants. "
"15999450","16005710"," You know, if they fucked this up so bad where they just fucking poured the money on, plugged up the"
"16005710","16012370"," tub and allowed all this money into the system when they start to drain it and turning the money"
"16012370","16015150"," supply off, do they go with too heavy a hand on that as well?"
"16015150","16021570"," And that's been an argument in the market for decades is that they overdo the Fed over does things."
"16022350","16028630"," And he's seemingly here trying to or bolstering that in his statement saying we're not going to"
"16028630","16030310"," pull back from."
"16030610","16036090"," And I think that's also a nod to people that argue for the Fed put, right?"
"16036730","16038070"," That we get to a certain point. "
"16038210","16039390"," They're just not going to raise rates."
"16039990","16041130"," They're going to keep threatening, threatening."
"16043730","16047470"," And you're going to run into one of these Fed meetings and they're going to say, well, we have"
"16047470","16048470"," inflation under the control. "
"16050130","16051690"," We're not going to do anything this month."
"16052750","16056030"," And all of a sudden market rockets, right?"
"16056690","16061710"," But he's making a statement here where he's saying, no, we're committed no matter what."
"16062110","16068610"," No matter what the numbers say, no matter what normally triggers us to stop increasing rates. "
"16069750","16071730"," And so they're like the hammer with tack."
"16071950","16075270"," They're never really applying things appropriately."
"16075670","16078650"," And he's kind of back in that up right now on the other end of this. "
"16079350","16081210"," So what does that infer or mean?"
"16081450","16085230"," I'm sure you'll see talk about this in the news and in social media."
"16085250","16086730"," Let that specific comment down"
"16086730","16098590"," the"
"16098590","16098590"," road."
"16111010","16113790"," What do they say about gas prices?"
"16113790","16116770"," Then you're dealing with that financing strategy. "
"16117190","16119130"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Winky."
"16121370","16125010"," That does mean their margins go up."
"16125910","16127750"," What do they say about gas prices?"
"16127990","16131310"," They say gas prices go up like an elevator going up. "
"16131350","16134730"," And then they come down like a feather falling through the air, right?"
"16137670","16139550"," Well, it's not only that they're reactionary."
"16140070","16141750"," It's that it's not only that they're reactionary."
"16141750","16143430"," It's they do too much. "
"16144970","16152050"," And the fear is that let's look back in 2020 to 2021 when they're pouring the money on the economy."
"16152830","16155850"," And you're saying, shit, this is too much, right?"
"16156610","16160610"," Let me keep going up and up and up and up and to the situation that we're in now."
"16162550","16167530"," And then now, not that I disagree with rates that need to be high. "
"16167670","16168510"," I think they do still."
"16169250","16172210"," But it does bring in the question in the back of the mind."
"16173850","16179790"," Will they drive us into recession at some point from the overreaction on the other end of this?"
"16179790","16182750"," So you have both sides of that of that knife, right?"
"16182830","16188890"," You get the knife where they pour too much on and then will they actually know when to stop trying"
"16188890","16195030"," to fight inflation or and that would send us into a recession, right?"
"16199010","16204390"," If you guys know anything about short and long-term debt cycles, I don't discuss this stuff too"
"16204390","16208410"," much, but there are better, there are easy ways to discuss. "
"16208710","16216110"," But basically, when you start tightening like this, if you tighten too much, right, and you have"
"16216110","16226030"," wage inflation and you've got input costs, you've got cost of goods, or cost of your inputs is how"
"16226030","16229150"," you've got shortages, all these other things like running rampant."
"16229910","16231730"," It's like musical chairs, right?"
"16232430","16238490"," And even while they're doing this musical chairs, if businesses don't have free money flow, they"
"16238490","16240350"," end up getting strangled."
"16240990","16242390"," The consumer gets strangled. "
"16243070","16244770"," We've talked about this in the past."
"16245350","16248410"," But these short-term debt cycles, long-term debt cycles, have to do with this."
"16248990","16250170"," And they trigger recessions. "
"16251870","16253910"," That's not ever a bad thing either."
"16254130","16257050"," I don't mind the debt cycle."
"16257610","16258890"," It's good to dump. "
"16262870","16269610"," During free money cycles, it's good to dump companies that didn't spend that money wisely and"
"16269610","16272570"," create something that they can weather through one of those storms."
"16273450","16276290"," We have already seen that in companies like Peton."
"16277270","16281730"," We've seen it in other companies in some of these ERs where you figure that they were just fucking"
"16281730","16283750"," off during the couple of years where the money was flowing. "
"16284430","16288510"," And then you see other companies that actually invested money into their futures."
"16289270","16295590"," And so you need that to weed out businesses and you need that cycle as well to believe it or"
"16295590","16303970"," not forgive debt on consumers and also allow new, like young people believe it or not, like people"
"16303970","16307150"," that are 20, 30 years old to take on debt."
"16308270","16317930"," So each one of those cycles, you're cleaning out bad"
"16317930","16318490"," debt. "
"16318490","16321650"," On individuals that are overextended."
"16322170","16326610"," Oftentimes you'll see people that are like, well, I want the housing to stay up."
"16327530","16331710"," Especially right now, like I own all my homes straight out. "
"16331790","16332770"," I don't have any mortgages."
"16334090","16338770"," But in there are some people with mortgages that can afford them regardless of where the market"
"16338770","16339210"," goes."
"16340430","16348750"," But they're a vast majority of people that own homes in this country are relying upon a job that's"
"16348750","16351030"," paying them the best pay right now. "
"16351170","16353570"," They're over maxed out on credit cards."
"16353890","16361600"," They're buying houses way out of where they should be buying them out of the price ranges they"
"16361600","16362540"," should be paying for them."
"16363180","16364180"," And this isn't variable rate. "
"16364180","16366060"," This isn't variable rate stuff on mortgages."
"16366940","16368060"," This is fixed mortgages."
"16369100","16371180"," Buying houses that they might be able to afford. "
"16371340","16376360"," Let's say 250,000 and they're paying fucking three fifty four fifty five hundred for these houses."
"16376660","16379300"," They have a job that they think is always going to be there."
"16379820","16384180"," And they can't really weather three to five years at a down cycle. "
"16385840","16390680"," Those people have to be cleaned out of the system, believe it or not."
"16390939","16397460"," Just like businesses that aren't producing more than they're taking in, if that makes sense to you."
"16397520","16404939"," So if you're an individual and you're taking a loan, you have to pay that loan off with you"
"16404939","16405240"," working. "
"16405860","16412759"," If you overextend and you can no longer pay that loan off, you're actually wearing on the system at"
"16412759","16413180"," that point."
"16414360","16419160"," So we have to get rid of those people that are overextended which we know right now that people"
"16419160","16419520"," are."
"16422660","16427740"," We know right now that people took money and bought fucking houses they couldn't afford. "
"16427980","16429279"," They bought cars they couldn't afford."
"16430200","16431580"," They did all kinds of stupid shit."
"16431740","16436640"," They went out and spent it at the casinos and on lavish trips and all this other nonsense. "
"16436640","16439200"," But then you got companies that did the same stuff."
"16439200","16443180"," The hikes are partially priced and the rest will come with a fed act."
"16446360","16452520"," When you clean those companies out and you clean those people out, it opens the door to someone,"
"16452779","16455419"," not always younger, but basically younger, younger people. "
"16455939","16458320"," It opens the door to new young businesses."
"16459340","16462919"," They're like, man, if you gave me a million dollars, man, you gave me ten million dollars."
"16462919","16467680"," I got something that I could make and build that will take this market by storm, right?"
"16468360","16472400"," And you also want to build the time up to let those people into the market as well. "
"16475200","16481460"," Now the question is, does he figure that recession now or later?"
"16481860","16484480"," How long does it extend until we have that recession?"
"16484840","16487800"," Is it now or is it two years from now?"
"16488259","16489820"," And that involves politics, right?"
"16492400","16497380"," That's when you don't want to talk politics, but you have to because it impacts the market."
"16498080","16499980"," And that's the whoever is in charge, right?"
"16500720","16504779"," That's why you see politicians run and say, I'll bring the market back."
"16504980","16505880"," I'll bring the economy back. "
"16506480","16507560"," They'll make you all kinds of promises."
"16507860","16510200"," Then you've got one guy and whoever, it doesn't matter who it is."
"16510840","16511360"," That's in office. "
"16511380","16513340"," We'll say, well, I'm going to get it under control."
"16513660","16514540"," Just give me one more term."
"16515340","16517700"," Senators will do all this kind of stuff too. "
"16517700","16519240"," And it's always a hot potato."
"16521040","16528599"," What ends up happening, usually, what ends up happening is it becomes a hot potato down the fucking"
"16528599","16530680"," line until it just explodes and blows up."
"16534060","16540680"," And so the whole entire argument right now is, does he actually take control or not?"
"16540860","16542619"," Is it just more puffery, more bullshit?"
"16542980","16545040"," Talk from the Fed, right?"
"16545040","16549419"," Is he saying this right now at this conference and he still doesn't fucking mean it, believe it or"
"16549419","16550380"," not?"
"16550960","16558060"," Or does he actually continue down the road of tightening regardless if inflation has peaked in"
"16558060","16558340"," March?"
"16558860","16568040"," But there's devastating countries to a point in which they think it cannot hold themselves. "
"16568220","16570640"," Yeah, there's no destruction of home prices."
"16571680","16572800"," There isn't."
"16573540","16574640"," Hey, figuring out money. "
"16575160","16576860"," Hey, I wanted to apologize to you."
"16576939","16578419"," I did just see your DM."
"16579180","16580919"," This is a five-fine microphone. "
"16580919","16582160"," I apologize, brother."
"16583980","16587119"," My DM's are, I am in a buried head to toe."
"16588320","16588880"," Good to see you, man. "
"16590880","16592040"," How have you been?"
"16592759","16594619"," You know, and I have to watch your videos lately."
"16595099","16595340"," I suck."
"16595779","16596720"," I haven't had any time, brother. "
"16596900","16598180"," I hope you're doing well out there figuring out money."
"16598860","16599500"," Mike, how you been?"
"16600380","16604680"," The second piece of dough means that it's not all..."
"16604680","16607759"," Yeah, and they haven't removed that from the economy yet, right?"
"16607880","16608500"," They haven't removed..."
"16609259","16612980"," Well, I have been checking mortgage prices right now and rates."
"16613599","16614939"," And they're still pretty high. "
"16615119","16616820"," I mean, I'm looking at some of these mortgage prices."
"16617060","16620740"," Now there's $1,700 bucks and they've gone up 300 bucks."
"16621580","16627000"," That might not be significant to you, but you start stacking that up $2,000, $3,000, paying an"
"16627000","16628220"," extra $1,000 in a mortgage. "
"16628779","16629880"," But it's still not..."
"16629880","16632560"," It's on the cusp, but not quite on the cusp."
"16632660","16633919"," So you need wages to go down."
"16634800","16640860"," You need higher taxes on mortgages and you need to stop the money supply to failing businesses,"
"16641180","16641240"," right?"
"16641400","16643520"," The free money supply to clean out some of this. "
"16645140","16646939"," Oh, you did?"
"16647200","16649020"," What did you end up grabbing there?"
"16653919","16655259"," Did you grab a shirt?"
"16655259","16655340"," Sure."
"16655640","16656480"," I love shirts."
"16657099","16660800"," I went down the microphone hole and I'm like..."
"16660800","16666160"," I needed to grab a mic and then the jacks and then a mixer. "
"16666900","16669000"," And then I was like, oh, now I have to upgrade my computer."
"16671140","16674020"," The microphone led to a whole rabbit hole of stuff I had to do."
"16679330","16685689"," And I think for us, we should not sign a way from the issue of group policy. "
"16686110","16686890"," Yeah, the rate went up."
"16687070","16690790"," It's added to about 3 to 4 out of bucks to mortgages."
"16693310","16694029"," It's big. "
"16694410","16695970"," It's not the..."
"16695970","16696630"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"16696849","16697410"," That's a nice mic."
"16698130","16698970"," You know what I'm going to do?"
"16699110","16701630"," I'm going to watch your video tonight and listen to your sexy voice mic. "
"16706529","16709270"," Did you have to upgrade your setup at all, Mike?"
"16711450","16721110"," I'm going to send you some links to some programs that I run in the background."
"16723470","16731410"," I'll send them today."
"16731410","16735529"," I'll send you a link to a video on how to..."
"16737369","16740050"," Yeah, see, I thought I could just get just the mic and I'd be fine. "
"16740410","16742189"," And then it was a whole rabbit hole."
"16742390","16744750"," It was like a rabbit hole of tech that I didn't understand."
"16745669","16751550"," It's like tech software, hardware, and then I'm out there buying new computers and stuff so I can"
"16751550","16752950"," run the entire thing in the background. "
"16753770","16755689"," You know what else is funny too is that I'm like..."
"16755689","16759910"," I have to take a video or a picture sometime because no one can see what's actually..."
"16759910","16764689"," I've got like eight monitors here, a bunch of cameras, lights, stupid..."
"16764689","16769869"," I got these softbox lights and the..."
"16769869","16778640"," It's not clear that we're seeing a reversal of globalization."
"16779020","16779540"," It is cool."
"16779760","16781960"," I think it's sort of slowed down. "
"16782040","16783160"," And they're going to..."
"16784420","16787980"," It's more than people think it is."
"16788640","16790040"," You know what the crazy part is?"
"16790160","16791760"," Mike's out there putting out videos every night."
"16792220","16795320"," And all the due diligence he has to do the technical analysis. "
"16796180","16800200"," Then he has to put it all together, figure it all out, and then he's setting up a camera and"
"16800200","16800500"," a mic."
"16800820","16802120"," Make sure you look good at his dog."
"16802340","16805660"," It's clear that the globalization has slowed down and they go into reverse. "
"16807200","16810440"," Less globalization could mean higher inflation and lower productivity."
"16812120","16814260"," And then you've got to put the..."
"16814260","16816880"," You've got to produce the video, then edit it, and then you've got to put it out."
"16817540","16818120"," It's a lot of work. "
"16818680","16820080"," It's more than I ever expected."
"16820080","16828120"," I tell you what, I had no idea what it was like to produce content for people out there."
"16828340","16830640"," I just have a lot of respect for Mike's and what he does. "
"16833230","16834310"," You think you have an idea."
"16834550","16837330"," You think everything's easy and then you figure it out and you're like, this is not easy."
"16839070","16839810"," This is hard. "
"16841030","16842730"," And Mike makes it look good."
"16850870","16852770"," The funny part too is..."
"16852770","16858390"," The funny part too is..."
"16858390","16863290"," The funny part too is that I had nothing, no idea about video production."
"16863870","16868430"," I had absolutely no background in video production, audio production, any of that stuff. "
"16868670","16870970"," I'm learning all of this as I go along."
"16871450","16873710"," You've got guys like Winky that have been doing it for years and years."
"16873930","16874950"," I'm just like a hot mess. "
"16875190","16876210"," How are we going to govern?"
"16876490","16883020"," How are we going to make sure that everybody can see that you don't need some by the side of"
"16883020","16883340"," the road?"
"16886660","16888660"," I know it's something you're thinking about a lot."
"16889780","16891100"," Maybe it's another topic."
"16891340","16892580"," You have to talk about an IMF meeting. "
"16893280","16897020"," But this idea of the fragmentation of what's happening here politically and realign."
"16897120","16901320"," The key about this conversation is, let's take a look here."
"16901480","16902640"," We're still retesting lows. "
"16902640","16903620"," This isn't a good sign."
"16903760","16904740"," We could end up going up here."
"16905160","16909950"," Bears have taken the money to run. "
"16910050","16911090"," They're up here waiting, right?"
"16911510","16916090"," This doesn't mean that we don't continue to trade down, that we can't break through the support"
"16916090","16918150"," down here at 440."
"16918930","16919390"," It's weak."
"16919770","16921470"," This is not strong support here. "
"16922330","16931570"," Real support is down below here at 435.0. We'll continue to track this to see if we sell off"
"16931570","16931990"," into the close."
"16931990","16935870"," The one key at this point, too, is that we're below the volatility trigger."
"16936010","16937050"," That's a huge thing, right?"
"16937430","16938990"," You're selling rips at this point. "
"16939570","16941210"," Any rips that we have we sell, right?"
"16941310","16942390"," It's a regime change."
"16943230","16949990"," If we trade higher here, you still have bears in weight trying to pound down and below this ball"
"16949990","16950270"," trigger."
"16950970","16955910"," Now, the key point, too, is we've spent a lot of time down here between 435 and 440. "
"16956910","16959670"," But this rip higher was short covering, right?"
"16959670","16962850"," So this is a weak area down here."
"16962910","16965990"," It's nothing for us to break down below this 440."
"16968510","16970810"," Even if it takes some of the closers tomorrow. "
"16972310","16977510"," Now, let's talk about J-Paw and what he's talking about, that hammer reversal right on the economy."
"16978550","16981890"," And does he trigger the recession and if his words are real?"
"16982090","16985690"," Let me know in the chat if you think that that's all still fluff."
"16987290","16991890"," Do you think that, remember, you want to do like what two tests up here, too?"
"16992310","16995610"," If you're sorry, pick up and add some lunch. "
"16996570","16999210"," Do you want to see like one fake out?"
"16999410","17002710"," Not fake out, but rejection and a second one."
"17003290","17004690"," Usually your second one is the best one."
"17005370","17006410"," Sometimes you get it up one. "
"17006630","17008010"," If you get one try, it will go right down."
"17008810","17011550"," But the second try is usually the best for the reversal."
"17012190","17014490"," One here, one here. "
"17015550","17017230"," Take it down, well, it won't go that deep."
"17017870","17019090"," We're not going to get that super bearish."
"17019970","17023570"," Get like one, two, and then three right down here into the bell. "
"17023910","17028210"," Maybe it stops at 440, but this is a very weak support right here."
"17028930","17030210"," Just be conscious of that."
"17031610","17036770"," And in these checks up here, the new resistance, right?"
"17037350","17039990"," We could break through still and then trade down. "
"17039990","17044770"," So if you are being bearish right now, you want to account for that in some kind of an ABC"
"17044770","17047130"," entry to go lower, okay?"
"17047690","17050450"," Start with A, go to B, and then this C."
"17051550","17053250"," And you can take this move down."
"17059820","17061480"," Yeah, it's still stupidly complicated."
"17062500","17063460"," Yeah, I figure he got money. "
"17063540","17063720"," He's awesome."
"17063940","17065680"," If you guys don't follow him, you should."
"17066060","17067920"," I did use to watch his videos all the time. "
"17068360","17070580"," I just haven't had time to be watching YouTube videos."
"17070580","17071840"," I've been too busy."
"17077440","17082060"," Let's take a look at Tesla. "
"17085120","17087400"," I started to test those lower bounds."
"17087660","17090680"," We talked about if 10.30 breaks, right?"
"17090780","17094020"," If we break 10.30, it's a long road, right?"
"17094340","17100660"," There's some support showing up here that wasn't here before at 10.20. But still, this was the end."
"17101540","17105640"," 10.50 to 10.30 was the large support area. "
"17106660","17108580"," When you talk about support, this was it."
"17109140","17114900"," And if we're breaking through large support at 10.30, any of these dip buyers down here, they're"
"17114900","17117160"," showing up like there's some liquidity here."
"17117960","17119940"," But in reality, it's much farther down. "
"17120160","17123200"," Like the real support is down here at 1,000."
"17123940","17126260"," And you can see it here at 1,000 on BookMap."
"17126260","17128060"," Let's be conscious of that, okay?"
"17129060","17132700"," If we start to sell down here, it's usually quite swift. "
"17133220","17141920"," I think we just heard from a semi-power and that is at the cost of electricity."
"17143720","17149160"," So, just want to talk about..."
"17149160","17149760"," Oh, no."
"17150360","17152160"," We'll get back to Winky. "
"17153520","17155800"," I could probably get a job doing this now."
"17158080","17161620"," Like Crash Course in music and video production."
"17162500","17163980"," I didn't even learn anything yet. "
"17164040","17167960"," I'm still learning about camera stuff."
"17168220","17170440"," I'm still learning a ton about cameras right now."
"17172420","17176120"," Video production on the road and stuff like that. "
"17177720","17179200"," And of course, the editing process."
"17180540","17181880"," You have to learn editing software."
"17182460","17183280"," It's not composite. "
"17183560","17185480"," It first flows down one and a quarter percent."
"17185740","17190120"," The S&P just now flows down about eight-tenths of one percent."
"17190300","17192620"," This is not placed by calls in any way, shape, or form. "
"17193320","17194860"," Do not want to be buying calls here."
"17195960","17198180"," And this further tells the story of the spy."
"17201020","17203120"," Now, there are dip buyers down below here. "
"17203120","17205180"," 441 down to 440 and 439."
"17205420","17208480"," You might get a reaction down here at 439."
"17209060","17210260"," Not to be not expected. "
"17210780","17212560"," You release some of your shorts."
"17213520","17215360"," But the real support is down below at 435."
"17216960","17217840"," Right down here. "
"17237340","17239600"," Yeah, I'm not feeling any pain so far."
"17239860","17243360"," I have lost a little bit of money, but not near what I've gained on that trade from yesterday."
"17244360","17246100"," So I'm feeling good about this. "
"17246100","17248620"," But this is certainly bearish."
"17250720","17253740"," Sell the rips once you pass the volatility trigger."
"17263420","17269100"," And there goes that nice selling coming in right now. "
"17273640","17278480"," Trade down below volatility trigger, hit resistance, slam down."
"17279960","17282020"," If we come back up, same thing."
"17282360","17283060"," Same regime. "
"17283440","17284880"," We are on sell the market regime."
"17285780","17288200"," Maybe we'll get a market liquidation moment out of this."
"17288340","17289580"," That would be still to be honest with you. "
"17290160","17295380"," Because I still have yet to put that trade on on our captain's trades."
"17295380","17299920"," If we can get a liquidation break in the market, trigger full liquidation mode."
"17300720","17304260"," That would make my fucking day, to be honest with you. "
"17304260","17308520"," I just want to see if that's still on."
"17309700","17315720"," We're going to check ES and C if we get that mass market liquidation."
"17316680","17319720"," Those are some pretty bearish comments by Fed Chair Powell. "
"17320300","17324080"," I got to say, I haven't heard him beat that bearish in some time."
"17325420","17328940"," That was not a J-POW, the friend of the bulls."
"17329780","17334960"," That was J-POW, I am going to slam a hammer down on inflation. "
"17335620","17337800"," There is a bad side or there is a negative."
"17341440","17345780"," There's a risk of more risk of recession with those comments as well."
"17349440","17354000"," We are seeing some of that breadth roll today. "
"17354000","17358960"," We saw that nice breadth pick up leading up into yesterday."
"17359060","17363760"," And then this morning, we are seeing that roll continue in the market."
"17366580","17374840"," If you continue to see that roll in the market, these are the moments that we're looking for. "
"17375800","17384060"," When we're looking for to buy this market, when you start to hear people say, great traders wait"
"17384060","17388140"," until they get their perfect trade."
"17388900","17391260"," They go all in on it."
"17392580","17394140"," They go down to their bunker and they close. "
"17394460","17395360"," They lock themselves in."
"17395500","17396700"," They chain themselves to the wall."
"17398160","17399960"," You are looking for those moments in the market. "
"17401320","17406400"," You are looking for those moments when we have liquidation moments, where you can see them down"
"17406400","17409940"," here, another one, and you're waiting for those."
"17410720","17417220"," When you wait for those for most of your money, not your gambling money, they"
"17417220","17423800"," tend to eventually show themselves."
"17423800","17426360"," And so we're almost there. "
"17427120","17433980"," We did have some great breadth over the past couple days, but even with that said, we still have"
"17433980","17437420"," not had that liquidation, that liquidation one."
"17437560","17438260"," Price doesn't matter."
"17438960","17440520"," Believe it or not, the price could be anything. "
"17440820","17441380"," Price could be here."
"17441520","17442080"," Price could be here."
"17442900","17445220"," The price doesn't matter. "
"17445360","17447140"," What does matter is these breaks."
"17448080","17454120"," And you're looking for those moments where you can buy these with confidence and limit itself to a"
"17454120","17454740"," defined price."
"17455620","17456820"," And we're not there yet. "
"17458940","17462100"," So if we did get that at any point, it'd be pretty fucking happy."
"17462400","17467000"," Because these trades are once every one, I think one and a half months or so."
"17467460","17469540"," And if we do get that, it'd be happy again. "
"17470720","17473000"," Now trading at 440-69."
"17476460","17480600"," You will see this, whatever this bullshit support is."
"17480600","17484220"," If we can break through this, see this right here, right?"
"17484340","17485440"," This little bit of support here. "
"17486100","17488340"," And you get this last bar down below."
"17488720","17492480"," You've got 440 here and then you've got 439.50, right?"
"17492660","17498460"," This should be normally a good support area for the bulls."
"17498860","17502760"," Because we did spend a lot of time between 435 and 440. "
"17503520","17505900"," So you have to take that into account today."
"17507140","17512460"," You do have to take into account today that there should be some form of support here."
"17512580","17520360"," And the reason being is because of the time we spent here, I'll show it here one more time. "
"17520720","17521260"," How is this?"
"17521500","17524280"," Are we going back probably not to the old economy?"
"17524560","17525640"," What's the new one going to look like?"
"17525940","17529900"," The other thing maybe more pertinent to your question is, in the middle of this, there's a labor"
"17529900","17531240"," market in the United States."
"17531420","17532240"," Oh, here comes Zepow."
"17532780","17534900"," Well, it's too hot. "
"17535280","17538660"," You know, it's not, it's unsustainably hot, but not, it's not withstand it."
"17538740","17540720"," It's a very, very good labor market for workers."
"17541500","17543160"," And we don't want to be the labor market workers. "
"17543320","17545560"," You can see this time we spent down here, right?"
"17545660","17546700"," Supply and demand are closer together."
"17546980","17549740"," But I'd say that's, that's how I respond."
"17550120","17551000"," And the upside category. "
"17551240","17552860"," Though we're not going down, right?"
"17553000","17553460"," Wages are good."
"17553760","17554320"," People get tired."
"17554320","17555720"," No, we're not going down, right?"
"17555900","17556780"," We might as well go up. "
"17556980","17560920"," I'd be the first to say though, that it's, it's not sustainably hot."
"17561140","17563620"," But I do think with our tools, we can get supply and demand."
"17563620","17564980"," So you see that, right?"
"17565100","17567240"," We come down, we check, we said, we look below. "
"17567580","17568120"," They say no."
"17568640","17569820"," So we head back up, right?"
"17570040","17570740"," We told no again."
"17570900","17574200"," Housing, it's a very, very good labor market for workers. "
"17576280","17579420"," Our job is to get supply and demand closer together as this panel."
"17580480","17582380"," That's not positive for bold labor market."
"17582500","17583440"," It's too hot though. "
"17584040","17585040"," It is very good for workers."
"17586160","17588140"," If you, if you're a bull, that's not good for you."
"17589200","17590560"," You might think it is, but it's not. "
"17592020","17594480"," So you see that we test this low down here, right?"
"17595020","17598760"," Go up, down, test the lower low, told no again."
"17598980","17599700"," So we're going to head higher."
"17601840","17603540"," We just got told no here, right?"
"17603740","17604900"," Fools took the money and ran. "
"17606960","17608760"," Now we're trading down lower here."
"17609020","17610780"," What's the obvious thing to test, right?"
"17611180","17613300"," A lower low, right?"
"17614000","17615560"," We want to test this 435-33."
"17616700","17617420"," We want to find out. "
"17617520","17618900"," Are you sure we don't want to come down here?"
"17618900","17624280"," The first test below that 435 is naturally not 435."
"17627800","17633960"," The first test is 435, but you're here next test because we've already tested this twice, is down"
"17633960","17634320"," here."
"17635980","17637300"," This goes all the way back. "
"17637640","17639120"," Believe it or not, this is wild."
"17643620","17650020"," This goes all the way back over here to these previous lows at 410 and then 413."
"17652220","17659640"," If we head down here and if we've done this once and twice, if we can't get that second, if"
"17659640","17662460"," we can't get that one, two, right?"
"17663180","17663740"," Two tries. "
"17664680","17671780"," Third time you tend to roll down and come down here and triple check one more time down here."
"17672100","17680000"," This is what bears are looking for."
"17680000","17683680"," Of this than us heading higher right now. "
"17683680","17691240"," Those comments from Jay Power were quite bearish and has continued commentary this afternoon is"
"17691240","17692540"," quite bearish as well."
"17693080","17697720"," There's nothing at all that is not bearish about those comments."
"17698460","17703120"," It isn't even actually the fact of we're going to continue with 50 basis points. "
"17703500","17706660"," The commentary today that was the most dangerous."
"17706660","17709840"," We're now seeing some large spy puts coming into the market."
"17711640","17721620"," The commentary that triggered my interest is when he says that regardless of them thinking that"
"17721620","17725060"," inflation peaked in March that they're going to continue with the regime. "
"17726800","17733940"," We'll hear people say that's just threatening because they have threatened in previous years and"
"17733940","17734900"," then not followed through."
"17736260","17743600"," How about those put at least that commentary is saying, yeah, we put too much money into the system"
"17743600","17748640"," and now we're going to take too much money out of the system, right?"
"17748780","17749840"," It's the same thing, right?"
"17750700","17760600"," It's pretty much the speech inverse that he gave when he said we have our tools to pump"
"17760600","17763140"," the market up during in April, right?"
"17763280","17769120"," I think it was April or April of 2020 when he had that speech."
"17769700","17771580"," This is similar to that speech in the inverse. "
"17774380","17781420"," Now, be careful down here when you see I'm seeing gold tickets for spy puts May 9th 440 P for"
"17781420","17782960"," a million dollars golden ticket."
"17783340","17786560"," Be careful following those trades down here where we are."
"17786760","17791180"," You could still see a bounce back here. "
"17791180","17797920"," But even with that bounce back, you'd want to be you're in the regime right now of you're in the"
"17797920","17800660"," regime of just tag 440-48."
"17801180","17806760"," I think book map showed 440-49 was a big one over here."
"17807680","17809660"," Yeah, 440-49 was a big one. "
"17809960","17810620"," Next one is 440."
"17811460","17814040"," Next one is 439-44."
"17815660","17819000"," And you can see some weakness with those trades coming out. "
"17819500","17829400"," But also to note is that when you're below this ball trigger, any and all at this point trades"
"17829400","17831200"," higher, you're looking to just short the rip."
"17831800","17833460"," It comes up here, you're looking to short the rip."
"17833840","17836640"," If we break below down to 435, you're looking to short the rip. "
"17837580","17838640"," Until something changes."
"17839500","17843740"," Until one of these short the rips doesn't work, then you can take this long again."
"17844120","17846800"," But until that happens, the regime is bear town. "
"17886120","17892100"," Yeah, the only thing that I've heard different today was that the only thing that I've heard"
"17892100","17897040"," different today from that speech was I could have been a social faux pas more than anything, but"
"17897040","17904900"," I'm certainly going to tell you that he definitely, definitely today said we don't give a fuck"
"17904900","17910300"," if we get signals that inflation is going down."
"17911040","17911460"," We're committed."
"17911700","17918940"," That's the only thing different was like the pounding of the fist on the table saying no matter"
"17918940","17919920"," what, that's what we're doing. "
"17920560","17922900"," That's the only thing I took from that speech room today."
"17924420","17929840"," XOP puts May 20th, 128 P for $6.2 million."
"17933620","17942180"," That's the only thing that I noticed today was that he was like, I don't give a fuck. "
"17945180","17949040"," Which is certainly more bearish than I've heard him."
"17950360","17953220"," He's been like, oh, we'll use him when we need him."
"17954380","17955160"," Stuff like that. "
"17955280","17957120"," But he's basically, he's reinforcing today."
"17957640","17960700"," Now, whether he holds to that, you know, you know how the fed is."
"17960820","17962420"," They say shit all the time that they don't mean. "
"17972200","17976640"," Coming down below now to this lower level, 440-30."
"17976640","17986360"," Let's see if that support's still down there at 4.39. Seeing an uptick of dip buyers down here as"
"17986360","17986540"," well."
"17991080","17993540"," Fools coming in to buy this dip right here for sure. "
"17994080","17995860"," You can see them coming into buy right now."
"17998440","18001560"," Still a swarm of panic sellers above though."
"18002440","18003520"," Still a swarm. "
"18004220","18005320"," Wood not chock me."
"18005860","18008920"," Even if we bounce higher here watching some more resistance above it."
"18009040","18011980"," 4.4.1.7. Wood not chock me. "
"18014580","18018760"," Wood not chock me to see a liquidation type event here."
"18032910","18034150"," 440-34."
"18040340","18042140"," Give me that last little bit. "
"18042400","18043460"," Just get it down to 435."
"18044000","18045080"," You never get that last bit."
"18045840","18047220"," When you're like, we can get down to 435. "
"18047680","18049740"," You end up tagging out like, you know, at 440."
"18050700","18053000"," You're like, I even had a 400 and you tag out at 405."
"18054160","18057020"," Give me down to fucking 100 and you get tagged out at 105. "
"18069580","18070320"," And look at that."
"18070420","18073080"," You've got Tesla tagging at 1013."
"18076180","18078540"," That was their big support down below here, right?"
"18079240","18081740"," Right down here, 1000 on Tesla. "
"18083100","18083900"," Major buyers."
"18084460","18086120"," Tesla has given back."
"18086120","18089300"," Basically, it's entire move. "
"18090420","18097040"," If you had bought the clothes on Tesla yesterday, sold the open."
"18098300","18104040"," It would have been a 20% move in less than 24 hours, right?"
"18106740","18111020"," 20% move on Tesla in less than 24 hours."
"18111640","18112300"," Insane. "
"18118360","18119160"," Insane."
"18131570","18133850"," And you bulls want that V-shaped recovery."
"18133890","18134690"," Here's your chance. "
"18135530","18137370"," 440-34."
"18140870","18144350"," Just this death and destruction straight down."
"18144950","18146990"," Started at 953. "
"18147550","18153890"," Basically, right for 10 a.m. When as advisor, seeing, commenting on China, saying Chinese companies"
"18153890","18158950"," and banks are largely being cautious and steering clear of helping Russia to beat sanctions."
"18160790","18164450"," Four straight, four straight hours of relentless selling."
"18166010","18168110"," So any bulls out there, right?"
"18168470","18170670"," Any of the bulls that said I wasn't selling. "
"18171870","18174030"," I sold the fuck out of this."
"18174670","18175810"," But I did take a lot."
"18175930","18176910"," I took a hit right here though. "
"18177150","18177830"," I took a hit here."
"18178350","18180730"," No, I took a hit here and I hit here, I think."
"18181570","18182790"," Right there and there it took a hit. "
"18185050","18189810"," But any bulls out there that are telling you on Twitter, they didn't sell today, they all sold"
"18189810","18192070"," right here."
"18194610","18197410"," They're probably lying to you if they didn't tell you that they didn't sell."
"18200330","18204030"," I guess if they didn't sell, they're back to yesterday's money. "
"18206970","18207630"," Can you imagine?"
"18207630","18208390"," Can you imagine?"
"18208650","18209710"," Like, can you imagine?"
"18209730","18211010"," Think about this right now."
"18212350","18217110"," Can you imagine if you were like, can you imagine if you were a Tesla bought bull yesterday?"
"18217570","18218530"," I love, I'm a Tesla bull."
"18219090","18221530"," Can you imagine being a Tesla bull yesterday and you bought this?"
"18222810","18226410"," You wake up this morning, you're like, I'm going to go get, I'm going to go get, get my lunch"
"18226410","18227570"," on, get my drinks on. "
"18228290","18231550"," I'm going to go to the beach and go surfing today and you come back and you fucking come back"
"18231550","18232110"," and you're down."
"18232710","18238070"," You're down base almost, almost down to a thousand bucks."
"18238150","18240050"," Almost down the wheel started with the day before. "
"18240870","18241550"," That would suck."
"18242410","18243430"," That would fucking suck."
"18243630","18243970"," I'd be pissed. "
"18245170","18245850"," I wouldn't be happy."
"18249500","18250500"," Little bounce down."
"18250660","18253300"," He might get a nice little recovery trade off this. "
"18253520","18253720"," Might not."
"18254460","18260720"," I still think 4.35 is the target, but move this big, take your money and run."
"18261800","18264140"," More than likely some kind of recovery here at some point. "
"18267500","18268380"," Or you trade sideways."
"18268900","18269640"," That would be even worse."
"18270860","18272420"," Trade sideways right to the bell. "
"18272640","18276300"," Then we just sell it down to 4.35 less than 10 minutes."
"18286480","18289600"," Or check and see if, sorry, excuse me."
"18291000","18292980"," Check and see if the bulls take over here. "
"18293940","18294880"," If the bulls run."
"18301680","18303940"," More buyers than sellers right now."
"18316760","18317360"," Nasty. "
"18319440","18320300"," Straight nasty."
"18320720","18322140"," 4.47 20."
"18323080","18324860"," 4.47 or a full call. "
"18325060","18327560"," 4.47 if it, if we get a V shape recovery."
"18330940","18332820"," If, if there's a V shape recovery."
"18334760","18337220"," It's looking like something like this right here. "
"18339400","18340180"," Into the bell."
"18340180","18342060"," But this is vicious."
"18342440","18346940"," Now, even with this being said, dude, we are below this volatility level. "
"18347720","18351860"," This, this ball trigger up here is not fucking around."
"18353440","18356120"," It'd be tough to see bulls actually get this high."
"18356900","18358280"," See bulls actually get up here?"
"18359220","18361660"," I don't think they can, but I'll tell you what. "
"18361780","18364980"," Once you're down below this down here, when you're down below here, when you're down below this"
"18364980","18369100"," ball trigger, this is bear regime is bear town, baby."
"18369380","18369960"," Bear country."
"18371140","18371940"," Bear country. "
"18372760","18373900"," Not to be trifled with."
"18375080","18376580"," And this isn't to be trifled with either."
"18376580","18381280"," When you're bull, I bought this last night because we were above ball trigger and we got a good"
"18381280","18382020"," print off that. "
"18383000","18385000"," So when you come back down here like this."
"18386480","18391140"," Man, even, even a recovery up here is going to be, it's going to be sellable for sure."
"18396790","18397950"," I'm not fucking with it. "
"18397950","18399530"," There ain't no way that I'm fucking with this."
"18404760","18406020"," I still got calls though."
"18406320","18407480"," I'm still holding calls. "
"18415520","18416440"," Yeah, not a bad."
"18416700","18420100"," Yeah, talk's been over for 15, 20 minutes."
"18421700","18422760"," It was, it was a short. "
"18423060","18424080"," It was, it wasn't that long."
"18427080","18433820"," No, I've got some 420 P's for tomorrow expiry that I've been holding on to since Tuesday."
"18434120","18437160"," I've got 420 P's and I'm still holding on to. "
"18437160","18443300"," I've got a shit ton, a boatload of calls expiring in a week or a May 2nd."
"18444220","18449680"," I've got calls from May 2nd and I just added some more calls for next week."
"18449700","18453980"," I've added 460s that were dirt cheap. "
"18454160","18455800"," They were like 15 cents or something."
"18456640","18458840"," And then I've got puts for Friday."
"18459940","18463060"," And then I've got some calls that I bought today that burned. "
"18463540","18464620"," I don't think those are going to recover."
"18465200","18467560"," I'm going to hope for a whole last second."
"18471780","18473020"," I'm going to hope for. "
"18475120","18476840"," So what am I at right now?"
"18477620","18479700"," So may bank back here, bank over there."
"18480300","18482420"," These calls that I bought right here."
"18482980","18488820"," I'm going to hold these and hope that we can hope that there's some way to recover. "
"18489180","18491460"," I can recover like 30 or 50% of what I paid for."
"18491540","18492780"," I'll be happy on those."
"18494220","18500560"," Those look like something I shouldn't be showing. "
"18502920","18505800"," I'll be happy to just grab something off those."
"18506040","18509880"," If we continue down and I can monetize those puts into Friday, it'd be stoked."
"18510820","18512460"," But I'm holding on to those just in case. "
"18514380","18518820"," And then this dip right here, I'm not willing to buy."
"18519500","18521280"," I am willing to add more puts."
"18522420","18525760"," If we are trade higher or something like that, we stay below the vault. "
"18525940","18530020"," I'll buy some puts, but I don't like fucking around this stuff down here."
"18531380","18533160"," Even if there is money we made, there's no point."
"18533980","18539940"," And if we trigger a market sell, then I'm lined up for a large buy. "
"18542060","18547780"," I'm ready to go for a lot to go big on a market."
"18547780","18550580"," If we get market capitulation, which I'd like to see."
"18550940","18555120"," That's my ultimate goal because it's safety for those trades. "
"18556900","18558840"," You're in safety at all times."
"18562640","18564280"," We'll see if this holds down here."
"18564820","18566800"," Just note also the support level. "
"18567100","18569500"," There is support here, some buyers stepping in."
"18570120","18571100"," But this is not bolster."
"18571520","18572560"," Do you see how weak this is?"
"18573940","18574640"," And you want to see strength. "
"18575200","18577020"," I guess there's some strength stepping in right now."
"18577020","18577620"," You can see it."
"18579440","18580960"," Some dip buyers stepping in here. "
"18581920","18583860"," But real strength right now is 435."
"18584820","18588300"," This is the retest of the two previous tests down below 435."
"18589460","18594360"," If this test breaks away, price target 420 is still on the table right now. "
"18610670","18628180"," Here we go."
"18679340","18680040"," See it for."
"18680220","18681660"," Hey, buddy, where are you barking at?"
"18681940","18682340"," We have delivery. "
"18683740","18684740"," You let me know."
"18689940","18691260"," Bring this back over here."
"18693160","18694640"," And we'll see if 440 holds. "
"18695060","18700120"," I'm going to be looking for to retort or to buy more puts somewhere in this vicinity."
"18700120","18701100"," If I can get some."
"18701740","18703100"," If we can stay below this 445. "
"18703460","18704620"," If not, hold my call."
"18704900","18705780"," See if we can trade this up."
"18705780","18707220"," I have seen days. "
"18707460","18709940"," Just be cautious or conscious of."
"18710060","18711120"," I have seen days where."
"18713140","18714940"," On the day after Vickspiration. "
"18715780","18717480"," In the past and Vickspiration."
"18718460","18720180"," I have seen days literally."
"18720580","18721040"," There's no joke. "
"18721380","18723040"," I'll post them on Twitter for you."
"18723560","18725780"," But you'll see Vickspiration days."
"18727260","18727300"," Where. "
"18727680","18728280"," Wait a minute."
"18729580","18732020"," You'll see Vickspiration days where we trade down like this."
"18732620","18734740"," I don't want to talk about this because I don't like getting anyone hope. "
"18734740","18739160"," But some days in Vickspiration you'll go down and it gives you the room for us to skyrocket high."
"18740440","18743380"," So just be conscious of the fact that reversal can happen."
"18743960","18746160"," Not technically where we are in the picture right now. "
"18746180","18747160"," Does it look like it would happen?"
"18747820","18752400"," But there is this 5% chance that you could trade higher here."
"18753760","18754440"," Very high."
"18755620","18756420"," I don't think so. "
"18756540","18758000"," This is good for the bears."
"18758200","18758680"," The bears."
"18759040","18761420"," I got to give it to the bears today without a doubt. "
"18761640","18762280"," Good job done."
"18762280","18764240"," And Paul J."
"18764440","18764540"," Paul."
"18765240","18766740"," That's as bearish as I've seen. "
"18766920","18770960"," I mean, you guys, can you guys are called last time we've seen him that bearish in his commentary."
"18772160","18778420"," I've seen him like commit to bearish commentary, but not to the extent they did without one comment"
"18778420","18778820"," today."
"18778820","18779800"," For me, that was enough. "
"18781240","18783880"," Watching some support form form down below here at 440."
"18785720","18787620"," Watching some dip buying as well."
"18790240","18792780"," We'll see if there's a squeeze higher for its shorts cover. "
"18793300","18794920"," Take the money and run for the day."
"18813340","18814260"," Yeah, spies down."
"18814420","18815380"," Not even 1% of the day. "
"18815480","18817660"," Yeah, it's not that big of a doubt."
"18817900","18822960"," The only thing that's important about today is that we're back in our downward channel without a"
"18822960","18823120"," doubt."
"18823400","18823920"," We're back in. "
"18824800","18825760"," We haven't left."
"18826420","18827020"," We talked about."
"18827080","18828420"," I think we talked about this yesterday, right?"
"18829280","18831760"," I think we said when you're on the trail. "
"18833360","18836020"," And you have like three friends and one guy takes a spur."
"18836580","18840840"," And the question becomes, is everybody going with that guy taking the left hand turn?"
"18841020","18842420"," And right now they said, fuck no."
"18843680","18845180"," We talked about that yesterday, right?"
"18845320","18846660"," Or do you go with that guy or not?"
"18846800","18849280"," You remember yesterday he said, this is the trail, right?"
"18851560","18852380"," We came up here. "
"18852520","18853200"," One guy left."
"18854100","18858640"," And the other, the other fucking 99 people said, taking my money and I'm running."
"18859080","18859820"," And they ran. "
"18860340","18862060"," And we're now back into this channel."
"18862220","18862620"," That's important."
"18863020","18865620"," It's not something, not something to be fucked with, right?"
"18865620","18869300"," So that we're still in this downward, this, this descending channel. "
"18869960","18870880"," Which is hilarious."
"18871540","18872680"," You got to be honest with you."
"18873200","18874460"," Try to make it out of here. "
"18875240","18880220"," The bears want to break lower for full bull bear town."
"18880400","18882720"," Like catch a bear suit on is what the bears want."
"18884680","18886320"," You got that lower low there. "
"18887620","18889240"," You got that lower low there."
"18890660","18893060"," And bears want to see that, that, that break."
"18895040","18896720"," They want us, they want to see that break. "
"18901810","18903870"," They want that money shot down here."
"18904770","18906330"," Right down there is what they want."
"18916630","18917870"," Yeah, at this point you can. "
"18918030","18920850"," I mean, unless, unless the vault triggers retaken."
"18921690","18923070"," It's a, it is."
"18924010","18927850"," If it trades all the backup of volatility trigger, then it's just a bear raid. "
"18928870","18932240"," But if they're able to hold this, if they're able to hold below this volatility trigger."
"18933340","18936840"," It's a fake breakout out all day long, all day long."
"18937000","18944980"," If, if, if this is just a bear raid, then, then the gate, you're still going north. "
"18945640","18947240"," But that's a pretty steep sell off."
"18947400","18950100"," There was some pretty bearish comments by, by Jay pot."
"18950300","18953460"," I got a bit that was a bearish is bearish from me. "
"18955200","18958320"," So if this isn't retaken, if shorts don't close their positions."
"18958320","18963120"," The next every time I crude June, future settling 103 spot 79."
"18964900","18967360"," It's up almost 2%. "
"18975090","18977850"," If bears don't close their present, you know, this is the thing."
"18978030","18980250"," You've got a large short market short, right?"
"18981210","18982070"," They came in right here."
"18983050","18984150"," All right, so they shorted this. "
"18985590","18989710"," They won't have to, if they don't release these shorts all the way up today, right?"
"18989830","18990870"," If they don't release them all."
"18990870","18997010"," So the, for the continuation on, they keep these shorts on and the bulls don't have, don't have the"
"18997010","19000370"," commitment to say, fuck you, we're going north, right?"
"19000650","19004970"," Then, then we're going to stay down here and start trading down until we find some support and"
"19014920","19015660"," close this up."
"19023540","19028800"," And we'll watch this into the bell and see if there's any kind of a trade higher heading into the"

"19079610","19082590"," Not by this margin of declineers today."
"19083930","19087390"," The breath has definitely gone down today substantially."
"19094070","19095990"," So we'll see if this recovers into the bell. "

"19117310","19122770"," It's kind of like the. "
"19123650","19125390"," And this can extend up."
"19125390","19130270"," You can extend this up and still be on that ball trigger coming down."
"19132470","19139110"," And we also want to make a note here that the bears are at 447 flat. "
"19139650","19140170"," They're right here."

"19195810","19196890"," It doesn't mean we get up here."
"19197130","19200690"," But this is what what lots of traders will be looking at is this area here."
"19203550","19205490"," At least that's what the chart is telling me. "
"19205770","19207210"," That's what the book maps."
"19207570","19209510"," And spot cam and everybody else."
"19211970","19212730"," So there we go. "

"19313850","19316810"," Also another band above here at 443."
"19328050","19329070"," So it's time for a walk. "
"19482190","19486750"," Ukraine presence is a landscape saying that stopping the war is the only way to stop the"
"19486750","19488270"," development of a food crisis."
"19492900","19499240"," And Russia's blockade of the Black Sea has blocked Ukraine exports and impacted world food safety."
"19500920","19503060"," It's a landscape trust in the World Bank Forum. "
"19507220","19512220"," It's a landscape saying the Ukraine needs $7 billion per month to make up for economic losses."
"19601970","19606730"," Yeah, I just got my just had someone banging on the door and I'm like, who is that?"
"19608550","19609610"," I just got a."
"19611530","19617790"," I went out to check out my paint spray my big one and the pistons were bad and it had"
"19617790","19624610"," paint leaking out of the sprayer like the bottom of the sprayer and then I looked up replacing the"
"19624610","19626730"," pump and it was like not worth it."
"19628410","19631950"," The paint spell like really preparing it was like not worth it. "
"19631950","19641700"," So I just got a new Magnum X5 true airless sprayer"
"19641700","19645570"," and put the boys to work spray in the house."
"19653010","19654390"," Have all of you guys."
"19656970","19658790"," I said I would be back until three. "
"19659630","19664230"," I was only gone for a few minutes outside with the with the doggy with the doggo."
"19667930","19671370"," It looks like we're trading back down again still basing down here at 440."
"19680630","19685250"," Just bear bear regime, baby bear regime. "
"19689230","19690370"," They want that 435."
"19691570","19693670"," They want it before they want it before the end of the bell."
"19694890","19703330"," Hopefully they get two, three days of relentless selling to have a look down here. "
"19704150","19709550"," Still that support down below send down here 440."
"19710990","19715570"," Still have that 439 level down below here."
"19716670","19718890"," More buyers and sellers right now could break below. "
"19719650","19721610"," Still not still kind of a weak support."
"19722630","19724270"," That's not it's not massive support."
"19724270","19729030"," What else is interesting about this is the support that was showing earlier at 435. "
"19730170","19731090"," Kind of fucking weak."
"19731470","19732730"," Well, it's looks like it's bowl string."
"19733690","19735930"," We've got a little bit of bowl string going on down here. "
"19736130","19745850"," The interesting part is if we get down to 435 today, it opens the fucking door wide open"
"19745850","19750670"," wide and if you broke below 435 and closed below."
"19750670","19754070"," This is kind of like a bear wet dream."
"19756070","19758010"," But if you actually close below 435. "
"19758850","19760670"," Let's look back and see the exact price."
"19761530","19764650"," Let me take a look back and see the let's look back and see."
"19767790","19769650"," We can get an exact price. "
"19771370","19781230"," So 433, 435, 435 is the"
"19781230","19781870"," magic number."
"19784170","19790910"," So I've got it at right now."
"19792270","19794010"," I'll bring this over. "
"19794410","19798510"," We'll take a look at it closer."
"19798510","19800670"," So the test one is down here."
"19802090","19804530"," But it's not actually this is actually wrong. "
"19805150","19806930"," It should be 435."
"19809190","19809870"," 33."
"19811230","19812590"," Right there. "
"19816130","19817130"," Right there."
"19817610","19818450"," A little bit higher."
"19819690","19820990"," I don't like using this. "
"19821290","19823310"," I wish I right there."
"19826110","19830850"," That's actually test one like to the pen is right there."
"19831070","19832910"," So you break that right there, right?"
"19833610","19834190"," Oh, baby. "
"19835230","19836310"," Oh, baby."
"19837630","19839090"," That just gets nasty."
"19839650","19839730"," 435. "
"19840410","19840550"," 33."
"19842370","19844410"," If you get down here, I don't think we are."
"19844570","19845710"," But if we get down here, I do. "
"19845870","19849330"," I was saying that this morning, we could sell off to 435."
"19850130","19851670"," If we get it over with today."
"19853310","19856730"," If we got that over with today, you want to get real bear porn going on?"
"19857310","19863330"," If you got real bear porn going on, you could do like 435 today. "
"19866390","19868330"," I mean, you want to see some violent sell-offs, right?"
"19869490","19871230"," These are pretty fucking violent right here."
"19872670","19874310"," This one's pretty fucking violent right here."
"19874410","19875550"," It took a few days, took a week or two. "
"19876270","19877410"," This one took about a week or two."
"19877410","19879730"," So I don't think it would happen in one day."
"19880330","19884710"," But if you're going to get down here, you could easily take that out in like two, three days, maybe"
"19884710","19887250"," the Friday, relief rally, and then boom. "
"19888170","19888570"," Boom."
"19889790","19890450"," That'd be crazy."
"19890930","19891710"," I don't think we'd go there though. "
"19892270","19894710"," I'm not buying it unless we get shit tons of put fine."
"19896710","19899370"," Uh, but be it J-POW today?"
"19899870","19900030"," Fuck."
"19900370","19901050"," That was bearish. "
"19902310","19903710"," Like he was ultra bear today."
"19905170","19905570"," Ultra."
"19905570","19905790"," Ultra. "
"19906970","19907490"," Ultra."
"19907630","19908030"," Ultra bear."
"19908690","19910030"," That's still selling off. "
"19910810","19912650"," There's always dip fires down here."
"19912770","19913910"," I didn't buy none of this shit."
"19914450","19915450"," No fucking way. "
"19915930","19918250"," Sell every rip down below volatility trigger."
"19919970","19920990"," Sell it all."
"19921890","19923570"," Now, faster this sells too. "
"19924390","19928830"," The faster we get down to liquidation moments, you're going to get some really nice trades out of"
"19928830","19929450"," that if you're a bull."
"19930710","19932550"," Really nice trades out of this."
"19932750","19934090"," Any kind of move down below here. "
"19934090","19935490"," This first test."
"19936050","19941490"," What's interesting about this too is you should get a nice reaction down here."
"19942650","19952000"," Let's look back on, uh, let's look back on, um, yeah, there's your test number two right there. "
"19952300","19954160"," Let's look at just a smaller time frame."
"19957690","19959070"," Uh, let's see."
"19970350","19972730"," There's the four thirty five down there. "
"19982110","19983330"," Four thirty three."
"19988870","19990950"," And there's that four thirty three right here."
"19994470","19998870"," If you break, if you break both of those four thirty three, four thirty five, you might as well"
"19998870","20002090"," just might as well just fucking sell that whole fucking thing. "
"20002090","20009960"," I can't even imagine the number of people that are selling out of their calls right now and people"
"20009960","20012080"," that are panicking selling their stocks right now."
"20013300","20016340"," And we're still in, uh, in ER season, right?"
"20016900","20020360"," We still have some, some pretty, pretty decent ER reports coming out."
"20021100","20024000"," Um, we're not even halfway through, right?"
"20024120","20026440"," We're the big, the big boys are not even halfway through. "
"20028510","20029670"," Let me take a look here."
"20035890","20039910"," Let's take a look."
"20040610","20041170"," Right. "
"20041550","20048650"," We've got, uh, a snap after hours, Boston beer after hours."
"20050770","20054910"," Is that Cleveland Cliffs on Friday and then Verizon, American AMEX?"
"20056990","20058110"," Just kind of wild."
"20061080","20062660"," Let's have a look at some of these companies that are reporting. "
"20062660","20070020"," I mean, just look at that death and destruction on snap."
"20072840","20074300"," Just look at that."
"20077140","20078160"," Look at snap. "
"20083200","20089020"," This down here is, um, this down here is back on March 14th."
"20089200","20090060"," Last relentless selling."
"20091300","20093980"," Could you imagine being up in long snap?"
"20095280","20096940"," One, two, and three. "
"20097160","20097960"," There's where you get your break."
"20102550","20103090"," Nasty."
"20109970","20111490"," Just straight nasty. "
"20114170","20116910"," This is the original push by the bags down here, right?"
"20120490","20122150"," This is gonna be an interesting one to watch today."
"20123450","20124270"," Eight bucks."
"20126030","20128250"," It's not, it's not sold off to eight bucks. "
"20130010","20130910"," I got 20."
"20132010","20136790"," If that is a bad ER and sells off 30%."
"20138030","20139310"," And they've already done that, right?"
"20144300","20145200"," Didn't they have a moment?"
"20145380","20145940"," Yeah, $24. "
"20147600","20150220"," So it's not like they haven't been down here at 24 already."
"20152390","20154330"," So if snap has a bad ER report."
"20156690","20162470"," Pull some of that fucking, pull some of that fucking whacked out fucking public relations. "
"20162570","20163450"," That looks good."
"20166460","20167080"," There's 20."
"20168740","20170760"," This is where the bounce was before. "
"20171620","20177580"," I mean, you could see, you could see death and destruction in here on snap easily."
"20178920","20179160"," Bad report."
"20179920","20180220"," No problem. "
"20180440","20182720"," We'll always come back and check these how close we are."
"20183200","20183600"," Bad report."
"20184040","20184260"," 20 bucks. "
"20184460","20184700"," No problem."
"20185620","20186600"," Really bad report."
"20187540","20188540"," Eight, 10 bucks. "
"20192300","20197320"," If they pull like, if they pull like a hissy fit like, like Netflix did."
"20197960","20199540"," It's saying all kinds of crazy shit."
"20199740","20200340"," Lashing out at people. "
"20201940","20202540"," Let's see."
"20202720","20205240"," Let's take a look on the on book map on snap."
"20207260","20209300"," And see what fucking snap has to say. "
"20215000","20216180"," We'll load snap up."
"20218900","20221660"," And we'll take, we'll add some hours on to it."
"20222980","20223780"," Six hours. "
"20224920","20226320"," Dude, it's sitting on a hair itself."
"20226760","20227860"," You can see it's sitting on a hair."
"20229080","20233720"," Let's look at a dude 1000. "
"20235580","20236980"," This is where the bulls were this morning."
"20236980","20240080"," Two of the big bulls were 1000 off the opening belt this morning."
"20244240","20245120"," 1000 insane. "
"20247620","20252760"," 1007 right now on Tesla gave back every single."
"20252780","20258620"," So everything that was said yesterday, no matter, even if it was held into, I guess this was held"
"20258620","20261140"," for monetization into the open today."
"20261240","20262460"," So you get back going for you. "
"20262560","20264660"," You make all that money at least and can walk away."
"20264660","20272940"," Oftentimes if Tesla we know that the one bonus I'll give Tesla for sure is that most of the time"
"20272940","20275440"," you don't even get that right."
"20275940","20277900"," So I'm going to give I'm going to give Tesla bulls. "
"20278720","20280400"," At least the benefit."
"20281380","20287540"," Any bulls that bought and sold the open on Tesla did fucking very well."
"20290400","20292920"," I mean, I took money and I always take them. "
"20293020","20296900"," Well, you guys know I always take the money and run on the opens on these on these gap ups."
"20297120","20301080"," But if you were a Tesla bull and in the least got this."
"20301900","20305900"," You did well on this on this ER because oftentimes in these ERs. "
"20306540","20308480"," They often sell that we're talking about this yesterday."
"20308500","20314560"," They often sell down and as a dip by and even it was a great decent ER."
"20315380","20317140"," The fact that it opened here. "
"20317720","20319480"," You at least have to say this is awesome."
"20320320","20321520"," I bought some calls here."
"20321700","20324540"," They burned torch some calls up in here today. "
"20325440","20326360"," But that's okay."
"20326640","20327800"," This is all fine."
"20327980","20331220"," Torching these calls because I paid I made 300% today. "
"20331360","20334740"," This was not on this trade but a spy trade, which is banging."
"20336360","20338460"," So you're so you know, this isn't."
"20338840","20341800"," I mean, the the Tesla bulls that sold here did well. "
"20342280","20347120"," This is better than expected because most of the time with with with Tesla ERs."
"20347480","20351600"," You just don't get this trade or or it'll go up and by open."
"20352140","20354260"," It's back down to where it fucking closed that. "
"20354460","20356180"," So you don't even get to monetize your calls."
"20356960","20359680"," You don't get to take your money and run or any of that."
"20359780","20360460"," You don't even have a chance. "
"20361640","20365600"," If you bought stock, some some ERs you do well in here."
"20365960","20367860"," Even if it sells off, at least you can get out of it."
"20367860","20372400"," Like, you know, six in the morning or something four a.m. You can get out of your your your"
"20372400","20372780"," stock. "
"20374160","20375560"," But this here is wild."
"20375980","20379480"," And the crazy part is right is that there was selling here."
"20379880","20380680"," You can see it. "
"20381380","20382740"," People took their money and ran."
"20384260","20388880"," We still have these still have these these marks down below here."
"20390080","20393700"," Where to buy Tesla on a larger grander scale. "
"20395960","20400720"," Still have one, two, three sitting here for buying actual stock on Tesla."
"20401900","20405060"," But you know, it's like looking at looking at snap real quick."
"20405460","20409460"," Man, like if they don't have a good fucking if they don't have a good ER. "
"20411860","20414300"," Imagine snap down at 20 bucks."
"20415440","20418720"," Imagine snap if if they get shitty inside there."
"20420460","20423000"," In their ER call, imagine a snap at eight or ten. "
"20423320","20424460"," This looks like a free fall."
"20425000","20428440"," We'll look at a snap real quick and see if they can free fall."
"20429240","20431580"," And it's sitting on, you know, the cusp right here. "
"20431660","20432480"," You can see this, right?"
"20433260","20435020"," I mean, look at this heading into their ER."
"20435920","20436340"," It's just right."
"20436520","20438520"," This is ready to fucking fall off the cliff right now. "
"20438960","20443960"," 67,000 foot buyers, 27,000 call buyers."
"20447530","20448510"," Do I have that wrong?"
"20448690","20450170"," That's 7,627."
"20450490","20452350"," These are call buyers stepping in actually. "
"20453190","20455050"," But if you start looking down here, right?"
"20457870","20461610"," If they break, they do have some support at 25."
"20462010","20462790"," I didn't put that in."
"20464190","20466490"," Looks like a 20 though and see how big that is. "
"20468390","20470070"," 20 is really not that big a support."
"20470910","20471710"," Surprised that that."
"20473870","20475470"," 18 is a bigger support. "
"20477430","20479070"," So we'll change this to 18."
"20480870","20481910"," That's even lower."
"20483490","20484390"," 18 bucks. "
"20486290","20487890"," It's showing 27."
"20488170","20489350"," We have that line there already."
"20490070","20491910"," So it's slightly lower than 20 down at 18. "
"20497870","20499030"," 15 is pretty decent."
"20503610","20505210"," 10 is not even that decent."
"20505210","20508840"," Some balls. "
"20509780","20511000"," 8 bucks right there."
"20511420","20511660"," $8."
"20513480","20514120"," See it?"
"20515240","20517980"," Maybe some wild, wild salad in here. "
"20519440","20521000"," The 27, 18."
"20521880","20523460"," Yeah, there's eight down there."
"20524260","20525100"," That's pretty much it. "
"20526000","20528220"," It'd be wild to see a snap trade that low."
"20528880","20530480"," See it's a snap of like, I haven't seen."
"20530620","20530880"," We haven't seen. "
"20531080","20533040"," One was the last time we saw a snap of that low."
"20534180","20534660"," Spend some time."
"20536950","20538290"," Yeah, not that much time. "
"20540070","20541590"," I remember this run right here."
"20543090","20544410"," Clear at $29."
"20545910","20547670"," Their low was $4. "
"20549550","20553310"," Their March low, $8.03. This will happen."
"20553330","20554510"," This happened to Netflix."
"20555470","20556550"," Netflix traded below. "
"20557930","20559410"," It's March 2020 lows."
"20561790","20563090"," I'm not saying that's going to happen."
"20563090","20565650"," I'm saying no that, you know, to go below 8 bucks. "
"20566670","20571470"," If you fuck up your ER like they did, then it is on the table."
"20572310","20574970"," Imagine like a 30 or 60% decline in snap."
"20576510","20581550"," Look watching some Microsoft puts November 18, 250p. "
"20582850","20586150"," More put buying across the market on individual tickers as well."
"20587150","20588190"," So that's snap."
"20590370","20592190"," Imagine that in their participate. "
"20592650","20596310"," That's the crazy part is snap is participating in this market sell-off."
"20596590","20598050"," They didn't even give them quarter."
"20598470","20599770"," They didn't even say fuck you. "
"20600170","20601490"," We've got ER coming out."
"20604390","20609130"," Now there's that 439 that we saw that last little bit down here."
"20611830","20614490"," We got a free fall to 435 right here. "
"20616670","20617450"," We're close."
"20617770","20620130"," We got 40 points left to go to get down there."
"20620130","20620650"," 40 handles. "
"20622730","20624690"," So we got snap end of the day."
"20629490","20632390"," We've got PPG, Boston Bear."
"20632510","20634010"," We'll look up Boston Bear Company as well. "
"20642910","20644490"," These guys fucked up there."
"20644490","20652450"," You want to look at a company like even though I think there's still a case to buy a case"
"20652450","20654990"," to buy Netflix."
"20657800","20661520"," And then I tell you it's going to be years. "
"20662660","20664360"," You have to hold it for fucking years."
"20664660","20665940"," This is a prime example right here."
"20666040","20667280"," Basically committed legal fraud. "
"20669400","20674560"," Rather than with a rather than get or worn in their guidance."
"20675800","20679160"," That they fucked up what they anticipated."
"20680300","20681640"," Zero calorie beverages would be. "
"20681860","20682760"," You've got Samuel Adams."
"20684520","20689560"," And they fucking sold their positions before their ER."
"20690020","20690900"," This was their ER. "
"20690980","20691540"," I remember this happened."
"20691820","20692960"," They basically committed legal fraud."
"20696260","20698320"," Somebody should have went to jail for this. "
"20698720","20699320"," Believe it or not."
"20699720","20700460"," This is that bad."
"20702820","20709130"," So when you say you're going to buy and hold something that sells off right down here. "
"20710050","20712050"," People in Netflix like this or something."
"20713350","20715770"," You're talking about two, three, four, five years."
"20716890","20718570"," You're going to have to hold to get your money back. "
"20721050","20723530"," And you know, two hundred ninety five dollars."
"20723850","20724630"," You look back here."
"20724850","20725670"," This is twenty twenty. "
"20727630","20729510"," These are the lows down here, right?"
"20733360","20740400"," In Argentina, if you're economic activity index plus 1.8% versus minus 0.5% prior month to month."
"20741340","20746480"," Here be a 9.1%. These are lows of 2019."
"20747640","20751080"," This is the low of March 13th, 2020. "
"20759770","20764990"," This is right here where it looks like the banks originally bought it down at a low of 12870."
"20766050","20771310"," If they pull an Netflix dude, 12870 is probably on the board."
"20771970","20775470"," Excuse to take every last dollar and then buy the bottom. "
"20776170","20776950"," That's wild."
"20779130","20781050"," And they're participating today, right?"
"20781730","20782590"," They're down today."
"20783010","20784150"," They sold all this off. "
"20784850","20786990"," They sold lower than just a couple days ago."
"20789050","20789670"," Look at that."
"20790410","20795350"," These are two companies you could go long in on no one believing it's going up. "
"20796410","20798470"," Like they're at the bottom of the fucking barrel."
"20799430","20799990"," Snap."
"20800570","20801090"," Sold. "
"20802330","20803870"," Sold the fuck out of snap."
"20804270","20806210"," Sold the fuck out of Samuel Adams."
"20806590","20809630"," We've got one hour left until the close today. "
"20810570","20812470"," We've down now to 43878."
"20813290","20814450"," Do we get down to 438?"
"20815110","20816390"," 435 into the close?"
"20817010","20821530"," That would be fucking crazy if we did crazy if we get down to 435."
"20822090","20823970"," This is market liquidation without a doubt. "
"20825090","20826710"," So we're going to go down here."
"20827010","20829570"," I don't know if we test 435, but I will tell you this right now."
"20830130","20837330"," It is very key for you to know about what the significance of testing 435. "
"20837970","20843810"," We should see a huge reaction there regardless if we break through or if we trade below 435, but"
"20843810","20851630"," trading down here to 435, this is the first of two tests for the market to sell off."
"20853870","20856350"," So we've got an hour to close, right?"
"20856510","20864410"," Sam Adams at a low once again, 343.04 from being like the king of the hill there."
"20864910","20868370"," They were at Readyfest 1349. "
"20871290","20878170"," This is a company that makes most of your, they're kind of like a Budweiser now, but they got"
"20878170","20879190"," fucked up."
"20879190","20886590"," 1349.98 now testing the lows from their previous lows down here, 342."
"20887350","20894030"," Now they're now at 345 given back any kind of bounce they got for their earnings report. "
"20894190","20899170"," I'm going to be interested to listen in on Sam Adams earnings report and snap earnings report"
"20899170","20903510"," without a doubt today to give it an all up right here."
"20904630","20906750"," It's funny to say a company can't go down like that."
"20907450","20910170"," A company that's worth $13,400 can't go down like that. "
"20910330","20911230"," Fucking look at Samuel Adams."
"20912030","20912970"," Look at fucking Netflix."
"20914570","20916610"," I haven't seen shit yet, have they?"
"20917610","20918870"," So that's a lot of money. "
"20919050","20922050"," That's a big move for Samuel Adams to be down this low."
"20922510","20928550"," These are two companies where you might be able to buy some, you might buy some zero to these"
"20928550","20928730"," companies."
"20928730","20932770"," I've not been seen in these strategic control and reserves as scheduled to deliver 50 million"
"20932770","20935370"," barrels of crude in May and June. "
"20935950","20937390"," Or one dates or whatever that is."
"20939990","20941410"," I might buy some zero dates on that."
"20944730","20948230"," On both of those trades on snap and Boston bear. "
"20950370","20952590"," And then we've got, I think that's leaving Cliff's on Friday."
"20952910","20954070"," The department's in plants issue."
"20954330","20959710"," Third notice of sale on May 24th for additional 40 million barrels for delivery starting June. "
"20961130","20964310"," Dude, Samuel Adams straight red bar to hell."
"20964550","20964870"," Look at that."
"20965550","20966490"," Fuck you. "
"20978600","20979980"," We'll look at Samuel Adams."
"20980560","20986680"," I drew a, I drew some supports for Sam Adams."
"20986920","20987600"," You ready where they are?"
"20988540","20988980"," They're nasty. "
"20989880","20993960"," 295, 232, 184 and 130."
"20994860","20996220"," So we'll look at Sam next."
"20997120","20998500"," See what Sam looks like. "
"20998840","21002920"," We started out supports for snap earlier too."
"21004360","21006620"," So we'll look at, we'll load up Samuel Adams for the day."
"21009350","21012130"," And we'll add some time on Sam Adams here. "
"21013630","21014570"," Unfucking real."
"21016970","21017950"," We'll load up Sam Adams."
"21018210","21019830"," We'll look at Tesla and Spy. "
"21020370","21022110"," We'll see if this holds."
"21022490","21024890"," This is the main support from this morning, right?"
"21025010","21026890"," This was the giant where the buyers are."
"21028510","21029590"," We're testing now. "
"21029750","21030530"," Tesla 1000."
"21032190","21033770"," This is not good for Tesla."
"21033930","21034510"," I'm going to let you know. "
"21034650","21035170"," This isn't good."
"21035390","21037950"," So there's nothing good about this."
"21038030","21039530"," You don't want to see this as a Tesla bull. "
"21040430","21042110"," I feel bad for Tesla bulls."
"21042310","21042990"," You don't want to see this."
"21043730","21049390"," You don't want to see a full on liquidation event after you just had a pretty fucking good ER. "
"21050170","21052430"," This was everybody took their money and ran."
"21053150","21053430"," Right?"
"21053770","21056210"," Everybody took their money and they're out of here."
"21056850","21061530"," Classic distribution from the highs of 1200 that we come up to 1000. "
"21062210","21069190"," It makes me also wonder, it also makes me wonder how many bulls were caught up in the Tesla trade"
"21069190","21073930"," way back in, way back in."
"21075410","21076490"," Hold on a second here."
"21077650","21083960"," During the Hertz deal, it makes you wonder if any of those people are like, fuck this, I'm out of"
"21083960","21084120"," here. "
"21089510","21094570"," It makes you wonder if Tesla bulls are like, when they get up here, they're like, nope, or they get"
"21094570","21095030"," caught here."
"21095210","21098610"," And they're like, now I'm going to hold for 1300 and make some money."
"21099450","21102870"," And then the second time they're like, fuck this, I'm out of here. "
"21103310","21105830"," The next time we're up here, I'm getting the fuck on out of here."
"21107510","21110510"," That's got to suck for you being a Tesla or being a Tesla bull."
"21111590","21112830"," So we'll look below here. "
"21112970","21113970"," One, two, and three."
"21114430","21116770"," We'll see if there is any kind of selloff down here."
"21116850","21119610"," Any opportunities to buy Tesla stock. "
"21120470","21122530"," This is just, I mean, I got to say, I feel bad for."
"21123030","21125610"," I don't feel well for Tesla bulls right now."
"21125910","21126830"," They have to be crushed. "
"21127970","21132950"," So if you're a Tesla bull and you stayed long after today, if you didn't, if you lost somebody in"
"21132950","21135330"," some calls in the open, it's not really a big deal."
"21136710","21137990"," Unless that's all you have."
"21138190","21142390"," We went long on Friday or yesterday as we were the early bulls. "
"21143150","21145070"," But dude, this is going to be crushing."
"21145730","21147750"," Like, I feel bad for a Tesla bull right now."
"21147930","21148770"," No doubt about it. "
"21149210","21149710"," Any bull."
"21149990","21150290"," I don't care."
"21150430","21152470"," I don't care what bull you're one stock you're a bull on. "
"21153850","21155290"," This is nasty."
"21156870","21158410"," Absolutely nasty in here."
"21159390","21159870"," Absolutely. "
"21161090","21161790"," Look at that."
"21162150","21162170"," Boom."
"21162170","21168010"," Think you get the hot bounce down here at 10.50 between 10.50 and 10.30. You're hoping for"
"21168010","21168410"," a hot bounce. "
"21168630","21169610"," I was over a hot bounce."
"21169990","21170890"," Fucking gone."
"21171230","21171810"," See you later. "
"21173130","21173730"," Nasty."
"21175330","21177570"," A rarely trade Tesla anymore."
"21177690","21184510"," It's an official noting that Russia took over 42 villages in the Donetsk region on Thursday. "
"21184930","21189090"," Rarely take these trades anymore in Tesla because mostly because of this right here."
"21190310","21192830"," Just fucking take the money and run."
"21193290","21193630"," Fuck you. "
"21193750","21195870"," I'm out of here fucking snakes."
"21198590","21200150"," Let's take a look here."
"21200490","21203690"," Price started down below 4.35. We know about the winding test. "
"21204670","21209470"," Bears want to test 4.35.33. Should see a decent reaction here."
"21209930","21210930"," We have seen them in the past."
"21211610","21215930"," But the one caveat on this is you've had a lower low here. "
"21216450","21218850"," Not much, but a little bit lower low here."
"21220330","21223610"," Bears want to break down below here to continue the trend."
"21224310","21234070"," Bears want to beat 4.34.33 so that they can make their way down to this 4.24. I'll"
"21234070","21235510"," even extend this for you right here. "
"21236630","21239410"," The rest of this channel that we're running back into."
"21240350","21241490"," We'll look back on this."
"21241890","21243510"," We've had this up for weeks now. "
"21243510","21246290"," We haven't taken this channel down."
"21247310","21249170"," And look at that, huh?"
"21249630","21253910"," We deviated from course."
"21254230","21256910"," We'll add some more polylines here. "
"21257710","21259050"," We'll put this one up here."
"21260230","21262610"," And we'll put another one going straight down."
"21263410","21264370"," That is nasty. "
"21265690","21267950"," Absolutely fucking nasty."
"21269410","21269690"," Unreal."
"21270590","21272170"," You know what I've got to say?"
"21272370","21275810"," It does not make me feel good for fucking bulls. "
"21276230","21279910"," I've got to say, when you see something like this, it's painful to see."
"21280770","21281850"," I mean, look at that."
"21282310","21283050"," Violent move up. "
"21284190","21285890"," If we stay on track, wait a minute."
"21286130","21293650"," If we stay on track with this, you're looking for something down there."
"21293870","21295190"," That's just crazy. "
"21296190","21298130"," It didn't even stay here."
"21298130","21300670"," It's just fucking violent, straight down."
"21301650","21304730"," I'm not even going to put that down there. "
"21304970","21307350"," It should come back in the line at some point."
"21308050","21310410"," But man, look at that."
"21311190","21312230"," In Sano. "
"21314330","21315370"," In Sano."
"21315910","21318530"," We'll bring this higher just for keepsake."
"21319070","21319490"," Look at that. "
"21319610","21324630"," It's like a couple of balls hanging down here, like bull's balls, hanging down off the spy."
"21325110","21325530"," That's terrible."
"21325550","21326030"," Look at that. "
"21326030","21327070"," Filthy."
"21327650","21328870"," Bull's taking profit."
"21330690","21333370"," And just saying, fuck you, I'm out of here. "
"21334490","21335770"," I am out."
"21337890","21338850"," Look at that."
"21338990","21339830"," It's just disgusting. "
"21340650","21341750"," You know, nasty that looks."
"21342870","21343990"," Just nasty."
"21345370","21347270"," Absolutely death and destruction. "
"21348130","21351330"," If you're a bull right now, you're getting fucking murdered."
"21352550","21353770"," Price target down below."
"21353770","21360250"," $4.35. You want to break $4.35. You don't want to be sitting around there. "
"21360370","21361690"," We've bounced before down here."
"21362250","21362790"," Bounced once."
"21363150","21363550"," Bounced twice. "
"21364510","21366410"," It was really, really nice to see a break."
"21366950","21372190"," Sometimes I do want you to be aware you will see, if you can't get it done in cash market,"
"21372750","21375070"," you'll see it collapse in a little liquidity environment."
"21375290","21376230"," You'll just start burning through. "
"21377510","21380730"," So $4.35. Shocker."
"21381210","21386350"," Said it earlier, but I'll tell you what, I only gave it a very small percentage chance."
"21387030","21388270"," We were heading down here today. "
"21389410","21392150"," This support was very weak down here."
"21392790","21394270"," And so that sucks."
"21394710","21397230"," I might buy this down here at some point. "
"21398010","21400270"," If we can tag $4.35, I might buy this too."
"21400370","21404730"," I might buy Sam, Snap, and Spy, even for just a quick relief rally."
"21405650","21407770"," My only concern is that they'll try to sell it down. "
"21407770","21415570"," They'll load up on hedging flow in between $4 and $4.15. Could see more relentless selling into"
"21415570","21415970"," tomorrow."
"21416770","21419310"," Don't think that the markets rolled over yet either."
"21419850","21420650"," Be aware of that. "
"21422010","21426650"," Be aware that even with the selling today, the market has still not rolled over."
"21427610","21431370"," Believe it or not, no roll over yet in the market."
"21431690","21432410"," No death and destruction. "
"21433250","21434970"," Still not there at this point."
"21437230","21440230"," We'll see if we get that roll over or not."
"21440390","21446390"," Even all the selling, still the breadth is not as bad as it might seem to you out there. "
"21451680","21452720"," Holy shit."
"21453600","21454940"," Good night, ladies."
"21455480","21457320"," Just gave back the entire run. "
"21457520","21457840"," Look at that."
"21458680","21459880"," Just gave back."
"21460080","21461400"," We talked about this earlier, right?"
"21462280","21465220"," Talked about this whole week. "
"21465220","21466200"," This is right here."
"21467220","21469020"," Talked about this short cover."
"21469900","21470460"," Right?"
"21470740","21471140"," Hold on here. "
"21471880","21473200"," I don't want that to get rid of that."
"21474720","21476760"," Talked about this move right here."
"21480070","21481650"," Talked about this right here. "
"21481810","21483730"," We talked about this move up."
"21486330","21488470"," How dangerous this is right here."
"21489830","21490390"," Right?"
"21490690","21494850"," This is just like a two by four holding the house up. "
"21494850","21498650"," And then down here, we know we've spent lots of time down here in the past, right?"
"21499470","21501630"," Oh, this is just a toothpick holding up the market."
"21502170","21505150"," And you're seeing relentless liquidation of the market down."
"21505430","21510390"," And we'll see if this is support down below here or if we continue our ride south. "
"21510930","21515510"," Remember, once we break through volatility triggers, we sell every rip, right?"
"21522090","21522490"," Just relentless."
"21524510","21524990"," Relentless."
"21525250","21525810"," Look at that. "
"21526330","21527950"," That's gangster."
"21529210","21530850"," Gangster selling on the day."
"21531270","21532670"," Just straight gangster. "
"21534330","21536690"," Selling everything down today."
"21537990","21539510"," Just nastiness."
"21540150","21541210"," That's killing me. "
"21544750","21545830"," Just brutal."
"21548980","21550220"," I sold it the whole way down."
"21551020","21552440"," I said, fuck you, it's gone. "
"21553660","21557220"," Just boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
"21557220","21558880"," Bye-bye, ladies."
"21562390","21566090"," Oh, no, there's no, I need to be clear with you. "
"21566590","21571990"," Whoever you are out there watching this right now that there is no key anything at this point for"
"21571990","21572290"," the bulls."
"21574050","21574990"," There's no key."
"21576150","21582110"," Your key was the bull key up here at 445, but that was your only key. "
"21583670","21585050"," This is your only key."
"21585570","21587550"," Bears are fully in charge at this point."
"21587550","21588790"," You're in bear country. "
"21589410","21595010"," When you get really, if you want to see market, the market liquidation will take place below right"
"21595010","21595270"," here."
"21596330","21599250"," But below 435 is where you start to liquidate the market."
"21600110","21600790"," We'll write that in. "
"21601410","21602330"," See if your first test."
"21603610","21606830"," We'll write a couple things as you can see this stuff and know what everything means here."
"21607550","21609130"," This is your test number one, right?"
"21613410","21615750"," You'll get market liquidation below here. "
"21622530","21624530"," We'll write down bull as test number one."
"21625310","21636090"," And then below this zone here, if you break, we'll look at this"
"21636090","21637410"," test number two here."
"21641210","21643050"," This would be correction territory. "
"21644250","21649970"," So if you break this blue line right here that you see, one, two, and three, this would be another,"
"21649970","21652270"," this would be a correction, anything below here."
"21652270","21656210"," So market liquidation and correction, you'd start to move down right here."
"21657390","21659910"," This would be a mark, I believe this is a mark correction. "
"21659950","21661930"," I'll have to measure it later today tonight."
"21663370","21667550"," So market liquidation, this will trigger a market liquidation down below."
"21667850","21674470"," You can see it in any of your indicators out there that you'd see a liquidation event below this"
"21674470","21674990"," 435. "
"21676630","21681550"," Not so bad, but where it gets ugly is below that test number two level down below here."
"21681550","21685790"," You'll start to see people getting really upset."
"21687450","21692110"," When we say you'll see these numbers down in the future, we're heading there. "
"21695250","21698630"," Look at that, down below 1,000, 1,002."
"21699470","21700510"," Let's see where we're at down here."
"21701850","21704390"," Man, you gotta feel bad for bulls, man. "
"21704850","21705650"," Fuck me."
"21706250","21707610"," Like fucking testable."
"21708530","21709390"," That sucks. "
"21710470","21712250"," That really sucks for a testable."
"21712850","21714190"," Not a good day in the market."
"21714990","21715910"," Not a good day. "
"21716230","21717510"," Bad day in the market."
"21718610","21719050"," Sucks."
"21720370","21721910"," I don't ever like seeing stuff like this. "
"21722030","21722610"," I'll be honest with you."
"21723010","21723690"," I'm a bullet heart."
"21723850","21727790"," I don't ever like to see giant cells like this. "
"21730110","21732670"," And you've got, let's take a look at this here."
"21732810","21735110"," You've got 10,000 here."
"21740610","21746810"," We'll look at a paper chart for this because you need to see this on a paper chart more so"
"21746810","21751890"," than the implications for Tesla. "
"21754770","21756970"," We will look at the implications for Tesla."
"21760590","21764990"," We'll make this a little bit fair so you can see what exactly this means for Tesla."
"21765870","21767010"," It's not doom and gloom yet. "
"21767010","21769970"," It's not utter fucking death and chaos."
"21772330","21772810"," Okay."
"21773370","21776070"," What you want to see in here is, we'll get rid of this. "
"21776830","21781030"," We'll clean this up a little bit so you can clean this up so that."
"21783870","21785710"," This is all day trading stuff in here."
"21786810","21789930"," We're bouncing off below here but I want you to see this specifically. "
"21791290","21795410"," Then we'll put some day trading lines left back in in the future."
"21795930","21796450"," Okay."
"21798830","21800050"," On Tesla, right?"
"21802870","21806710"," To clean up all of our all of our year by this and sell that. "
"21807510","21812550"," So on Tesla, you did see by the dippers down below here, right?"
"21813730","21814750"," You can see them."
"21814810","21815430"," They bought the dip here."
"21815590","21816210"," They bought the dip here. "
"21816370","21817170"," They bought the dip here."
"21817970","21822950"," The expectation would be that you're going to find more by the dippers down below."
"21823830","21831390"," It is dangerous because if you break this plane here, you'll start to look for some pretty severe"
"21831390","21832310"," lower numbers. "
"21833570","21836150"," There are some other places from previous."
"21836770","21839010"," We can look at this later another day or time."
"21840250","21845470"," But if you do start to break below here, it's that same thing, right?"
"21845610","21849650"," You start to break below to get a market liquidation moment, right?"
"21850910","21854330"," This is just normal trading on normal investing. "
"21854770","21860810"," Then if you were to get a market correction, you would start, believe it or not, looking for..."
"21860810","21866310"," I'll clear that up and start looking for these numbers down here."
"21866750","21872250"," 760 and down here at 650s, believe it or not."
"21872790","21875150"," Remember when we were down here before, you say this will never happen?"
"21875570","21877610"," I said we'll probably be there again. "
"21878110","21879230"," I think some of you guys know that."
"21879410","21880310"," They said we'll be there again."
"21880470","21880790"," Don't worry. "
"21881030","21883670"," Take your money and run every time we make runs up from down below here."
"21884250","21885870"," This is your next area."
"21886450","21888330"," Depending on where the spy goes and the market goes. "
"21889830","21896270"," Now, if this holds here, this is all still dependent upon the vol trigger, right?"
"21896530","21898830"," And this grader moved down over time."
"21900030","21901450"," This is not a good sign for the bulls."
"21901450","21904830"," Now, that doesn't mean you don't have a snapback trade we take back. "
"21905370","21910490"," We go back up to 1,000 per minute or something, but on a more macro..."
"21910490","21913890"," Not quite macro, but on a larger scale of things."
"21914770","21916190"," This was not a good day for bulls."
"21916610","21919810"," That's not what you want to see for a breakout for bulls. "
"21920150","21923290"," This was a rejection for bulls market-wide."
"21923710","21924890"," There's your rejection right here."
"21925030","21925750"," You can see it, right?"
"21926810","21927670"," We traded up here. "
"21928650","21929170"," Rejected."
"21929530","21930390"," Rejected again."
"21930970","21931850"," Rejected again. "
"21932390","21936970"," And this rip from bulls is an attempt to try to get out here."
"21938430","21946190"," And if you're not seeing that, if you're not seeing that, what you can see over here is a swan."
"21946790","21948330"," This looks bullish, but it's not. "
"21948490","21950050"," It's more of a swan dive down."
"21950810","21952630"," We got about 40 minutes to go to the cash close."
"21953490","21957230"," Near the lows of the day, the S&P futures down close to one and a half percent. "
"21958950","21961890"," Russell's 2,000 down closer to two and a half percent."
"21962710","21965690"," And then as that composite, trading down 275 points."
"21968200","21971340"," With a bounce here, 4.37, 87. "
"21975190","21976630"," We want to see if that can hold."
"21976870","21977550"," We'll check right now."
"21977670","21978010"," We'll take a look. "
"21983140","21984360"," Still light liquidity, light support."
"21985680","21988840"," Any kind of trade back would be short covering only."
"21989460","21995240"," Maybe triggered short covering, but no way shape or form is this major support of any kind. "
"21995240","21996840"," Major support is down below."
"21998420","22000380"," And even this, it looks like they moved up."
"22000520","22002240"," Looks like major support did move up. "
"22003140","22006940"," Currently, this 4.35, it looks like they are kicked in now."
"22007500","22009460"," You can see the buyers down here."
"22009800","22015940"," The number of buyers, they are kicking in currently moving up from 4.35 on the spot. "
"22021710","22022230"," Unreal."
"22022230","22022630"," Unreal."
"22026790","22027230"," Unreal. "
"22030090","22030530"," Unreal."
"22031470","22034270"," I thought there was a risk of Vix."
"22034450","22037890"," I knew Victor knew about this Vix move here today, but shit. "
"22038110","22038870"," I didn't think it would be that nasty."
"22040190","22040970"," No way."
"22041430","22042410"," I think it would be that nasty. "
"22042690","22043010"," Violent."
"22044890","22045330"," Violent."
"22048750","22049190"," Wild. "
"22054750","22054790"," Yeah."
"22055050","22055890"," Tom, I agree with you."
"22056090","22057690"," Can we just hit the 400 of the spy already?"
"22060890","22062630"," I agree with you on that, right?"
"22062850","22065390"," Hit the 400 on January and be done with it. "
"22073180","22074440"," Let's say respect to Captain Sawyer."
"22074600","22075420"," You lost my intestines."
"22076180","22077520"," Testines are going to be fine. "
"22077720","22079400"," This Tom will look utterly irrelevant by end of year."
"22080020","22080680"," Oh, no, no, no."
"22080860","22082360"," So I don't want you guys to think. "
"22082620","22088740"," So if you look at my wins from yesterday and my losses from today, I'm up like 150% right"
"22088740","22089000"," now."
"22089540","22090840"," I've had a very, very good day."
"22093480","22094960"," I'm up a lot today. "
"22096380","22099740"," I've made more than most of you on this trip."
"22100140","22101140"," So I feel good today."
"22102100","22103640"," But I feel bad for bulls today. "
"22105400","22106740"," This is terrible for bulls."
"22107080","22108520"," This is not what you want to see for bulls."
"22110120","22112660"," With certainty, this is not what bulls wanted to see today. "
"22113420","22115320"," So I feel bad for bull today."
"22117080","22118840"," I've got no qualms."
"22120020","22121660"," You guys see me do it all the time. "
"22121960","22125160"," So more wins than losses."
"22130420","22131120"," Tough day."
"22131320","22134540"," $4.37.87 on the spy. "
"22139530","22142450"," Man, there's $4.35. There's that test down there."
"22142570","22143510"," Can we get it in the overnight?"
"22144590","22146090"," I always want to see it in cashmark."
"22146270","22147430"," You never want to see it in the overnight. "
"22147430","22150490"," You always want to see this happen in cashmark it."
"22152030","22153630"," You don't want to see it in after hours."
"22153630","22157470"," You never want to see it in the overnight. "
"22158110","22161270"," You want to see the liquidation inside of cashmark it."
"22162550","22163550"," It's interesting."
"22163830","22166670"," I'm looking at the breadth indicator. "
"22167270","22169310"," We still haven't rolled this market over yet."
"22170510","22173850"," Still have not rolled this market over yet, which lends some fear."
"22174470","22181910"," If we're only at 56, so we're still at 61%, they still haven't sold this market. "
"22181910","22183790"," Still a death grip on this market."
"22184110","22188550"," So even this move today is mostly shorting, I would think."
"22188710","22194930"," I think I'm going to guess that there were sellers today, but it did show earlier. "
"22195170","22197630"," We had 2.4 to 1."
"22199090","22204750"," Decliners to advances, but it's still showing that this market's being bought at this time."
"22218840","22221800"," Follow the commentary from Chairman Powell today."
"22221800","22226160"," I'm going to give you a break even rates on the 10-year U.S. Treasury have risen to just"
"22226160","22227360"," over 3%. "
"22229780","22237480"," So I make these trades every year."
"22238680","22241940"," You get anywhere from 9 to 12 of them a year."
"22243240","22248480"," On average, you get 10 of them, but on the low end, you get 9 trades a year. "
"22248480","22253520"," So that equals about 1 every 1.5 to 2 months."
"22253760","22254780"," You'll find one of these trades."
"22255980","22259480"," And so you have to wait for the trade. "
"22260600","22262060"," So you don't get them every day."
"22262180","22266640"," On that handle, you'll only be getting those once every 1 to 2 months."
"22267600","22269840"," We're close, but still not there. "
"22270940","22272380"," Still not there."
"22283420","22285000"," Yeah, it's really effective on extremes."
"22291960","22294700"," Yeah, you can easily capture 100 to 500%. "
"22294700","22296260"," It's almost foolproof."
"22296780","22298480"," It's how I'm able to gamble."
"22300720","22303000"," I'm able to gamble by taking these trades. "
"22309410","22314250"," How about you have to have patience and you have to have, first off, you have to have patience."
"22315190","22318830"," And you have to, there's a lot of discipline in these trades because you're trading a lot of money."
"22321270","22323290"," They cost a lot, they're dangerous. "
"22323950","22327330"," Even though they're not dangerous, they're very low risk, but they're still dangerous."
"22328330","22330430"," You can have wild swings in these trades."
"22331230","22335710"," If you're taking these at bottoms, the market will swing wildly. "
"22336750","22339150"," And you have to, you limit sell at a price."
"22339530","22341790"," You say, I need to make X amount of dollars."
"22342150","22344010"," So you have to hold until they print. "
"22344970","22348210"," And you'll have moments where you want to buy the market that you can't."
"22348210","22355650"," This is an exercise for, this isn't a challenge to prove anything to anybody."
"22355910","22359850"," This isn't a challenge to be the cool kid of the block. "
"22360110","22366350"," This is a tool to teach so that they can show you the discipline that it takes to wait for"
"22366350","22374830"," the trade, to take the trade, manage the trade, and then roll it into your toolbox so you're"
"22374830","22375770"," consistently making money."
"22375770","22382130"," So if you're expecting me to, no, this is another thing about this trade too, is you will miss"
"22382130","22384250"," great trades in this trade."
"22384750","22391750"," There, you will miss actual like 100, 300 point moves on the upside, and you'll miss those trades"
"22391750","22392310"," as well. "
"22393590","22397730"," So when you hear people out there, it's funny too, I saw someone talking to me the day, some of"
"22397730","22404010"," the respect said, so I don't normally like market breath indicators."
"22404270","22412570"," I don't normally like MACD, I don't follow MACD, that stuff, oversold, overbought signals, I don't"
"22412570","22413150"," follow them."
"22414370","22420070"," And because they still make a lot of money not following those signals, but there is one truth that"
"22420070","22421190"," these guys don't tell you. "
"22421230","22425970"," This guy I respect a lot, and he was like, he was like, I don't ever use that to trade."
"22426630","22432090"," And I'm like, that's just fucking pure insanity, that's just fucking outright fucking lie."
"22432530","22438450"," If he's either making money, well I think he makes money by selling courses and shit, but he was"
"22438450","22441130"," telling his followers, I'm not going to name names. "
"22443410","22447330"," I'm not going to name names, but he was like, you know, trying to be like, hey, we're always"
"22447330","22448430"," winning and stuff like that."
"22449250","22455190"," And I was like, I was like, that's fucking pure insanity, I'm like, I know how you make money"
"22455190","22457010"," consistently in this market, that's not what he's saying."
"22457290","22461090"," I know what the banks do to make money consistently in this market, and it's not what he's fucking"
"22461090","22463390"," saying, and even they fucking blow up. "
"22465270","22472030"," We got resist more sellers above at 440 now, we got some buyers here at 439, but you can see"
"22472030","22472850"," them right above here."
"22472850","22476390"," 441, we're just getting ready to sell again, excuse me."
"22478860","22488050"," We'll see, well, my interest is, excuse me, my interest to see, let's take a look at Sam Adams. "
"22495200","22499420"," Kind of in a box, this looks like straddles, right?"
"22499900","22505760"," Lots of straddles here, lots of buyers down below on Sam Adams into the bell here, last half an"
"22505760","22506020"," hour."
"22507220","22511160"," If Sam Adams has an awful earnings report."
"22511560","22513660"," Hold on here. "
"22518270","22519770"," Ignore and continue, yes."
"22524410","22527970"," Let's like look death down here, look at that, no buyers down below."
"22530550","22531990"," This could be a bottom for Sam Adams. "
"22536910","22539010"," Lots of buyers down here in Sam Adams."
"22541930","22543830"," Lots of buyers here in Sam Adams at 320."
"22545770","22548370"," If this gets rug pulled, it's going to the depths of hell. "
"22548370","22553050"," 3.2, 3.2, market on clothes is looking to the buy side, about 400 million to the buy side"
"22553050","22554690"," of early MOC names in S&P."
"22557350","22560450"," If you buy this dip, you might want to close them by the bell."
"22563890","22564730"," What way am I here?"
"22564870","22565530"," What am I doing wrong here?"
"22571180","22576920"," Why do I have to get some more, I got some wonky going on here. "
"22577840","22579340"," I've got duplicate screens going on."
"22582180","22584260"," Sam Adams might be a nice trade into the bell."
"22584260","22587420"," The one thing I would caution you with is that there's no buyers below. "
"22589360","22593500"," It will trade to the depths of hell, but it looks like everybody's there to buy Sam Adams on the"
"22593500","22593680"," bell."
"22594540","22596220"," I'm going to take a trade on Sammy."
"22598820","22600660"," We looked at Snap, didn't I?"
"22601180","22604220"," Yeah, Snap, I don't know if I trust Snap as much. "
"22605340","22613820"," The buyers stepping in now on the spy, trading as high as $4.39.45. Sellers above it, $4.41"
"22613820","22623690"," and $4.40. That trade is how I consistently make"
"22623690","22626410"," money to gamble on the stock markets."
"22626670","22631550"," The only way that I've consistently traded that is always printed, always."
"22634510","22639850"," More than 90% of the time, it's like every 30 trades that might lose one. "
"22640710","22642170"," Maybe 30 trades."
"22642810","22643910"," I might lose one of these trades."
"22645570","22647510"," The banks run these same trades too. "
"22647650","22652090"," The banks run collars in the same fashion, so it's not so abnormal to take these trades."
"22653670","22654710"," And one will be here soon."
"22654910","22655350"," We're almost there. "
"22659000","22659560"," Yes, Sam."
"22672810","22673790"," Yeah, it's not close."
"22675570","22678050"," You might miss short-covering rallies too. "
"22678230","22681130"," You could miss a 100-point short-cover rally."
"22681550","22682730"," It's not a part of this trade."
"22682930","22686470"," This is a separate tool that I use to make consistent money. "
"22686610","22688310"," You have to separate this from everything else that you do."
"22691510","22696830"," Everyone sold all their calls, good for a little bit of gap up in the futures."
"22697930","22701010"," My sense is the hard part knowing when to sell. "
"22701310","22702350"," That's why I goofed on today."
"22702350","22705030"," It has that cover by setting limit sells."
"22705510","22707350"," Yep, I set limit sells with you every day. "
"22708030","22709350"," You guys should have seen those."
"22709490","22712210"," I set them both for spy and for Tesla."
"22712850","22715370"," There should be nobody diamond-handing calls into the bell today. "
"22719110","22720290"," 90VM bounces off."
"22720450","22720790"," $197."
"22721170","22724110"," Snap was one of those last year seasons that limit down after earnings. "
"22725350","22727330"," Yep, time for short-cover rally."
"22727830","22730910"," Spypump here looked like short-cover to the rest of the level above."
"22730910","22732730"," What trade are we talking about?"
"22733190","22736350"," It's only my weekly and monthly spy puts, though I think it can go way down from here. "
"22736470","22738530"," What the fuck was that dump?"
"22740490","22741990"," Yeah, I'm not buying any of that crap."
"22742530","22743170"," Oh, none of this shit."
"22743730","22745430"," You can see the sellers right here, right?"
"22746030","22746830"," Look at them. "
"22747030","22747590"," Right here."
"22748230","22749430"," They're just sitting here waiting."
"22755870","22757790"," Give me that 435 into the bell. "
"22761210","22762990"," Give me that 435 into the bell."
"22765340","22771420"," Do you want to do it in cash markets and not in after hours, not in overnight?"
"22775810","22776930"," Oh, shit."
"22782070","22784750"," He said diamond-hand calls into the bell. "
"22793310","22795110"," You guys are fucking hilarious."
"22795870","22796950"," You're funny as fuck, Chris."
"22805750","22806510"," Look down below. "
"22806830","22808770"," If you are a bear, what are you looking for here?"
"22809070","22810070"," Well, in the chat, tell me."
"22810170","22812510"," I've said it to you 10 fucking times today."
"22813110","22815150"," What are you looking for if you're a bear here?"
"22816490","22817610"," Someone put it in the chat. "
"22820990","22821990"," I'm diamond-handed."
"22824510","22826630"," What are you looking for if you're a bear here, do you guys know?"
"22827450","22828310"," Tell me what you're looking for."
"22831910","22833190"," You're welcome, we can't count. "
"22836770","22837650"," Anybody know?"
"22838370","22838770"," Bueller?"
"22844430","22844930"," Bueller?"
"22846170","22847430"," The spite is zero."
"22848370","22849930"," If you're looking for..."
"22849930","22850290"," That's right."
"22850510","22851310"," POC wave knows. "
"22851830","22858690"," We want a break of 43533 in cash market."
"22863000","22864400"," In cash market."
"22864880","22871460"," We can get it in after hours and futures, but it's always sweeter when it's in cash market. "
"22885390","22889270"," Yeah, we're not waiting for it to go real low."
"22894900","22895560"," It's hilarious."
"22896280","22897220"," You guys are fucking hilarious. "
"22899500","22901200"," We wait for it to go real low."
"22902580","22904340"," You can't paper a Ponzie."
"22907140","22908240"," You guys are hilarious. "
"22912830","22913270"," 43757."
"22919550","22920650"," Yeah, I don't like counting."
"22920930","22921510"," You can count it. "
"22921630","22922230"," I just don't like counting."
"22922470","22925970"," It's always better when you count the break below the test."
"22926390","22928610"," So your test number one is 43534. "
"22930110","22934890"," You can probably buy that if you're going to buy something."
"22935890","22938450"," I guess if you want to buy something, you want to buy this."
"22938670","22940050"," If you're a bear, you want to see a break. "
"22941290","22945830"," Even if it's just like a little tiny penis touch, like if you got that little like..."
"22947290","22948530"," just down like that."
"22949370","22952690"," If you get that right there, just a little peepy touch down there."
"22953790","22954770"," Just like that. "
"22956170","22958930"," It triggers a move lower."
"22960850","22969450"," So if we stop here into the bell, just shy of it, we're probably done going down."
"22971590","22973050"," Or for now. "
"22973950","22980810"," But if you touch down below here, technically, it's opened the door for another move later at a"
"22980810","22981250"," later time."
"22981250","22985810"," We'll still go up, but for now, it signals that we broke."
"22986670","22987790"," We broke lower. "
"22987890","22988870"," We're looking for lower prices."
"22992330","22995570"," And another thing I haven't seen yet that you guys haven't seen is what?"
"22995830","22997510"," What do you normally see when we're down in these parts?"
"22998510","22999430"," You guys want to tell me?"
"23000410","23005930"," Normally when we're down here, you're looking for a capitulation moment, a violent move down."
"23006270","23007710"," This isn't violent, believe it or not. "
"23008230","23012410"," And you're looking for a quick v-shape recovery, like 15 minutes to take."
"23013170","23016130"," And you'll see that the algos are triggered to buy that bottom."
"23018580","23021640"," So until we trigger the algos to buy, we ain't getting it. "
"23022540","23023860"," And we don't have a market breath."
"23023860","23024480"," It's still up."
"23024540","23029380"," We still have buyers of this market right now in this market, believe it or not, that haven't sold. "
"23029920","23032160"," More than likely due to a earnings season."
"23033900","23036840"," So we're getting these ramps down here."
"23046760","23054000"," $4.37.52. And I think a few of you out there were telling me to buy that dip. "
"23054400","23055620"," And I told you, fuck no."
"23056380","23057580"," There's another sell the rip, right?"
"23058520","23059620"," Another sell the rip moment."
"23060460","23062460"," Another sell the rip moment, right?"
"23064770","23066290"," There's still selling any rips above. "
"23067110","23069590"," We'll look to see if they're there once again into the bell."
"23069590","23070510"," We'll look to see."
"23071110","23072150"," And they're still there. "
"23072290","23073130"," They're still sitting here."
"23079650","23080910"," And we'll pay attention here."
"23081070","23083650"," We'll see if we get more sellers above here. "
"23085490","23089810"," $4.39.19 might be a possible place where they ramp back up again."
"23089970","23095390"," You can still see on the right hand side, see the volume of buyers versus the volume of sellers"
"23095390","23097310"," quite large here."
"23103770","23104510"," Might have to. "
"23104770","23105890"," It depends on where we go."
"23106070","23110690"," If we can get down to like four o'clock, four fifteen, there might be a place to buy some"
"23110690","23111570"," Friday calls in here."
"23112850","23113490"," Might be. "
"23115570","23116010"," Maybe."
"23124570","23134370"," I don't know if this gets going at some point, but this gets going."
"23134550","23136710"," The fact that the breath hasn't left the market. "
"23136710","23141010"," Remember we're talking yesterday and day before we were saying that some of the big names haven't"
"23141010","23141470"," reported yet."
"23141670","23143510"," Amazon has reported companies like that."
"23144230","23147930"," If you get all the big companies out of the reports out of the way, like you start to get"
"23147930","23153070"," the big tech, big names holding up spy, big names holding up the Dow, and they're done reporting. "
"23153850","23155010"," You'll fucking see some acceleration."
"23156170","23157930"," You'll see some acceleration in the selling."
"23161090","23162910"," See like two or three days of this shit. "
"23164310","23165390"," It'll be fucking relentless."
"23166650","23168330"," These are the days when I come to the market."
"23168530","23169710"," I'm like, fuck this, I'm out of here. "
"23171030","23172910"," Just, just ping me when we're down."
"23177920","23178320"," Yeah."
"23178400","23182440"," Jay Pao did do bibles dirty today without a doubt. "
"23183660","23184240"," If it."
"23188340","23188920"," Damn it."
"23189440","23189620"," Yeah. "
"23189740","23192340"," You don't want to you don't want to see Tesla lose where they are."
"23192460","23192820"," If Tesla."
"23193180","23197620"," If Tesla lose, well, not Tesla, but if the market starts to roll over, you'll start to see Tesla"
"23197620","23198060"," sell. "
"23199720","23207360"," If the market dictates at some point, even if Tesla holds itself up, even if Tesla hold it, do so"
"23207360","23209660"," tag Tesla tag 996 44."
"23213090","23219250"," If Tesla at some point begins to, even if it comes back for today or tomorrow, you got to time"
"23219250","23220090"," this shit with market."
"23220430","23222230"," And you guys, some of you guys don't do that. "
"23222390","23227670"," Like you have to time not only your favorite ticker, but what the market is doing."
"23228890","23231650"," Where is it in terms of the rollover in the market?"
"23233110","23236970"," You guys have to consider the market with your ticker too."
"23238530","23240250"," Like what is the market doing?"
"23241930","23247010"," So if if if if Tesla's down in a market rollover, you know, it gets amplified. "
"23248210","23251830"," Like if the market's rolling over and Tesla's on a high, it doesn't go as deep."
"23252570","23257650"," If Tesla's on a low in the market starts to roll over, it makes it even worse when the market"
"23257650","23260450"," eventually does accelerate to the downside."
"23262070","23267290"," Now, just be careful here in the bell, it's 3.43. Still have some sellers above here at 3.40"
"23267290","23275670"," or 4.39.85. Now, so if you are trying to buy a dip down here, we still have these"
"23275670","23292910"," sellers waiting above here for you at 4.40 and 4.41. Nasty. "
"23307950","23308430"," Relentless."
"23310270","23318470"," I'm looking at the, I'm looking at the at the call side here and the put side here puts their"
"23318470","23319390"," fucking fat."
"23320410","23321890"," Super fucking fat. "
"23323750","23325230"," All calls worthless."
"23326110","23328350"," All of them for Friday."
"23329170","23329330"," Gone. "
"23330750","23339310"," Put side monetize up the ying yang fucking tons tons of money in the put side right now."
"23344410","23345870"," I'm actually making money."
"23345870","23348270"," I made some money on my 4.20 peas. "
"23348770","23350130"," I'm doubled by 4.20 peas."
"23351230","23351750"," Sweet."
"23411350","23414730"," Just relentless selling into this clothes right in this bell. "
"23414950","23416190"," Look at this clothes in this bell."
"23416910","23417430"," Unreal."
"23419410","23421410"," Just turn over, turn over. "
"23421970","23423670"," We'll see if we can tag lower."
"23424910","23428730"," This is the first test we've talked about this for the past week or so."
"23428730","23431390"," We've had this line here, test one, test two. "
"23431990","23436370"," We're going to test lower here and see if we can send the market lower."
"23437150","23439290"," The just the review for the day."
"23440070","23441610"," We came into this morning. "
"23441790","23443710"," Any of you that followed into those calls overnight."
"23444690","23446110"," We got a big fat print."
"23446590","23450890"," Less than 15 minutes ago, we're hearing marketing closes are pairing off and it's not only"
"23450890","23452250"," fractionally to the buy side. "
"23453030","23457050"," U.S. equity futures are near the lows of the afternoon here with about 12 minutes ago."
"23457050","23458990"," U.S. cash equity close."
"23461320","23463780"," We had a huge print coming into the open. "
"23464000","23466640"," Took profit off that print from the buy at the belly yesterday."
"23467980","23469740"," Then attempted to buy a dip."
"23469980","23471300"," No, no dip to buy. "
"23472100","23474200"," Just relentless selling all afternoon."
"23474560","23479740"," At some point we said we could probably go to 4.35 today earlier in the broadcast and it looked"
"23479740","23480440"," really low."
"23481840","23486640"," And I think even then just looking that low we were like, Nah, no fucking way we're getting down to"
"23486640","23490940"," 4.35. And right now this is where we are, right?"
"23491080","23497520"," We are down at 4.35. I mean, just imagine trying if you're just trying to get back up to"
"23497520","23502940"," 4.45 from 4.35. That's a huge fucking move right in a day. "
"23503420","23508320"," We talked about going to 470 and how we could do that in anywhere from three to nine or even"
"23508320","23509180"," 15 days."
"23509180","23516160"," And just today and yesterday we've made that move in less than 20 or just shy, right?"
"23516260","23521240"," We're coming in on 24 hours and we've made that move in an up direction and a down direction."
"23522120","23524680"," So hopefully we're able to keep some of your money. "
"23524800","23528020"," If you're able to take both sides of this trade, you're doing even better today."
"23528480","23532040"," We had a trend day or trend overnight and a trend day lower today."
"23532780","23538440"," Or you cut your calls loosened at least the state cash gang all day long waiting for a dip to"
"23538440","23538740"," buy. "
"23539460","23545680"," Now we do know that we're down below here at this 4.35. You want to break on this in"
"23545680","23547120"," cash market."
"23547120","23550100"," You want to break 4.35, 34."
"23550980","23556380"," Create that lower low over a much farther out time period, right?"
"23557180","23560420"," You're looking at, you're looking more now in a monthly close, right?"
"23560420","23562860"," More than a weekly close. "
"23563060","23565580"," You got one, two, three, taste Thursday, Thursday."
"23566300","23568700"," You got Wednesday, Tuesday and Monday."
"23569160","23574500"," This is the Monday low that you're looking to close out right now, closing lower on the week. "
"23575120","23577200"," Trying to get that red week in there."
"23578320","23580480"," This will spell doom, right?"
"23581080","23586160"," If we close below here and start heading lower into Friday, you'll start to have a put together a"
"23586160","23586680"," red week."
"23587340","23592840"," And furthermore, if we start to look back on the month, we've got February. "
"23593520","23596160"," Let's go back to April 1st back here."
"23597020","23598960"," This is April or April 1st, right?"
"23599100","23601060"," We're at 450, right?"
"23601840","23609080"," 450 on April 1st was the low and we are nowhere near now closing out, nowhere near at this point"
"23609080","23612180"," closing out the month in the green, right?"
"23612940","23615460"," This is, remember, selling may go away."
"23616120","23619460"," And April is typically a green month. "
"23619980","23621960"," That's not proving itself today."
"23623120","23624060"," That's a green month."
"23624700","23627140"," This proves that bulls are any kind of bull run. "
"23627840","23629360"," Bulls are taking their money and running."
"23629600","23629940"," They're selling."
"23630840","23633740"," They're saying, hey, I bought this and now I'm going to take profit. "
"23634500","23636920"," I don't foresee our market going up."
"23638480","23641020"," So I'm in it for a limited time, right?"
"23641180","23644540"," I'm in it for a limited, limited, limited profitability."
"23644940","23646280"," I'm taking my money and I'm running. "
"23649570","23653770"," Watching, even though we're lifting up right here, last few minutes is 350."
"23653950","23658690"," You've got 10 minutes left, light buying on the, and the, and the buy side imbalance."
"23659790","23665790"," Still watching some quit buying on cues, spy and arcade at these lows. "
"23666070","23666830"," I'm shocked at that."
"23666830","23668630"," I wouldn't have expected that."
"23670270","23672550"," They'd be put buying even right now. "
"23673610","23682210"," Call buying on misfit MSFT Microsoft May 20th, 270 C for $900,000."
"23682690","23690890"," Call buying, like call buying on Facebook, April 22nd, 197.5 C for $140,000."
"23691650","23694890"," Maybe we get this rally now in the close, the last 10 minutes. "
"23707590","23710770"," We'll see how this goes for the bulls into the, into the close here."
"23713870","23714350"," Hilarious."
"23715910","23719810"," We'll take a look and see if there's any last minute sellers up here. "
"23719850","23721830"," It looks like there is too right above here."
"23722390","23725930"," You'll see some resistance, more sellers right here at 43850."
"23726630","23729990"," Trying to get that close on the bell down below. "
"23730430","23731970"," I don't know if they get it right now."
"23732610","23738650"," If shorts start to close their positions into this bell, we'll see if it happens."
"23747780","23748300"," Unreal. "
"23749060","23753500"," How does that, can you imagine just being long, all day long in this?"
"23753760","23756480"," This is fucking horrific for bulls that were long."
"23757160","23762180"," If you're holding stock and stuff and saw this take place today, this has got to suck."
"23763420","23766080"," You got to be, you got to be crushed if you're a bull. "
"23766780","23767580"," Look at that."
"23767960","23769020"," All gains given back."
"23769820","23773000"," One, two, three, four, four days of gains, gone. "
"23774000","23775080"," Wiped, clean."
"23776720","23779200"," Four days of gains gone, one day."
"23780000","23782420"," Huge, huge for the bears. "
"23784700","23786000"," Huge for the bears."
"23786620","23790360"," And I actually made money on my fucking puts, which is fucking hilarious."
"23793680","23794240"," Hilarious. "
"23794640","23799340"," If we go lower tomorrow, if we go lower on Friday, if we go down to the 420s of tomorrow,"
"23800100","23801620"," I will be fucking rich."
"23803080","23803880"," Fucking rich."
"23804600","23810520"," I don't think we do, but getting this low, and this is good for bulls. "
"23810680","23811500"," This is good for bulls."
"23812540","23813840"," You do want to see this."
"23814880","23818980"," You know, bulls don't want to see that break of 435-34 at all. "
"23819760","23820700"," They don't want to see it."
"23822700","23824320"," They don't even want to see that."
"23827100","23829180"," So let me know if you've taken along into the close. "
"23829460","23837020"," I threw some calls on 445 for tomorrow."
"23837740","23838600"," Not a lot."
"23838740","23839300"," It's only 100. "
"23839680","23846900"," So I got 100 calls on 445Cs for tomorrow expiry, 445C."
"23847960","23852100"," And I'll hold those into tomorrow and see if we have afraid we're going to sell futures."
"23852100","23855240"," That's my fear is that we're not buying futures. "
"23855820","23860140"," My fear is that we're selling futures because we're below volatility trigger."
"23860360","23863680"," But I grabbed some 445Cs heading into the bell."
"23864020","23866500"," I don't expect them to print, to be honest with you. "
"23866960","23869840"," I think we're triggering a market."
"23870240","23872320"," I think the market's wrong."
"23872480","23874460"," I'm not positive, but I think the market's rolling over. "
"23875320","23878520"," So I'm going to be looking for the market to begin to roll over."
"23879200","23887520"," I've been waiting for the market to roll over now since March 29th."
"23888080","23893660"," So it's been 22 days of waiting for the market to roll over at this point. "
"23894180","23894640"," Not bad."
"23894800","23896320"," It could go another month, believe it or not."
"23897120","23901640"," It's anywhere from a month to a month and a half. "
"23901800","23903340"," So we're at day 21 right now."
"23903340","23909360"," So next nine days to the next 18 to 20 days."
"23916530","23917370"," So we'll check. "
"23917590","23918650"," And we're also going to check."
"23918870","23920550"," We're also going to check what to the bell."
"23920570","23921170"," We're going to check. "
"23922130","23922610"," Snap."
"23923490","23926010"," And we're going to check Sam Adams for their reports."
"23928310","23930690"," I think these two have a chance to at least go up. "
"23930890","23933930"," I have more faith in Sam Adams than I do in snap."
"23934910","23937390"," But both of these have been destroyed."
"23938030","23939590"," Like straight up destroyed. "
"23947870","23950110"," Close your 440 P's or hold overnight."
"23950430","23951290"," I always like to close."
"23951570","23954690"," I always like my intraday trades like to close every day when I can. "
"23954810","23955650"," I try to close those."
"23956090","23957150"," We're inside five minutes now."
"23957210","23957590"," Five minutes. "
"23957730","23957990"," We close."
"23960150","23961230"," I like taking profit off."
"23961290","23962010"," Anyone my wins. "
"23962750","23965150"," Like when I if I buy something to go overnight."
"23966330","23968850"," I try to reposition myself for an overnight trade."
"23969990","23972370"," And then so if I take an overnight trade. "
"23972530","23977010"," I'll usually take it and I usually sell it right in the bell for profit."
"23977670","23979190"," Like the opening bell the next day."
"23979230","23981870"," If there's a trade that even making money off in intraday. "
"23982790","23984470"," I take profit from that trade every time."
"23985070","23986110"," Even if we continue down."
"23986230","23986690"," I take profit. "
"23989740","23991940"," Always take the money and run to live another day."
"23999770","24000890"," Yeah, I'm not seeing that."
"24001010","24001690"," I'll tell you what. "
"24001810","24002630"," I'm not seeing that."
"24002630","24007490"," The one thing in this pose that can warn you of if you're a bull is I'm not seeing."
"24008090","24010910"," A wave of call buying here in this bell. "
"24011730","24013790"," You have four minutes left until the close."
"24015010","24017910"," Not seeing a wave of call buying in the market."
"24018710","24020430"," This ain't this ain't the end. "
"24022440","24023960"," If you don't see that right."
"24024260","24027420"," Normally we're looking for a capitulation moment in the market."
"24027760","24028740"," This wasn't it. "
"24029420","24031860"," And when you see that capitulation moment."
"24031860","24036880"," You'll also see a snap right like a like a V shaped market on clothes."
"24036880","24040760"," We flip to the cell side 650 million to the cell side. "
"24041300","24043780"," Less than a few minutes ago to the cash equity close."
"24046260","24047620"," We'll stay close here."
"24047840","24048740"," 437 11. "
"24049500","24053220"," Can we get 435 33 in cash market?"
"24053480","24055280"," Not fucking after hours."
"24056060","24059900"," I guess I would technically allow they say it's technically allowed in after hours."
"24059900","24061200"," But maybe 415. "
"24061880","24064060"," Maybe we can trade trade down there between now and 415."
"24070370","24071510"," Yeah, there's no V shaped."
"24071750","24073150"," Yeah, you guys know how that happens, right?"
"24073610","24074970"," You see accelerated selling. "
"24076310","24078010"," It gets really fucking nasty."
"24078290","24080270"," And then you see a snapback."
"24080270","24084250"," It just snaps a big giant green fucking bar until you see that. "
"24084590","24085470"," We ain't done selling."
"24093870","24094490"," Yeah, we'll talk."
"24094650","24095690"," Let's talk about the market breadth indicator. "
"24095990","24096150"," Okay."
"24096530","24096990"," Before we go."
"24098070","24099030"," Stick around here. "
"24099030","24100830"," Stick around for about five."
"24100850","24102850"," If you're new to this channel, stick around for."
"24104810","24105490"," 10 minutes. "
"24105690","24106430"," It doesn't take long."
"24111810","24113970"," So you have we're going to talk about."
"24115230","24116790"," Two minutes in closing bell. "
"24117070","24120070"," The earnings from today able to get Boston beer company in the first."
"24120070","24123110"," It's in for the close and also to the surgical."
"24124050","24127950"," Snap reports about 10 minutes after the close and PPG industries at 415. "
"24131370","24132530"," We're going to talk about."
"24132530","24136290"," We're going to talk about some things today."
"24150710","24153770"," We'll give it just a few minutes here in the spell here and see what goes on. "
"24164670","24166570"," I know a lot of you guys already know this stuff."
"24166750","24167750"," I know a lot of you great traders."
"24168030","24169330"," Long time traders already know this stuff. "
"24170150","24174990"," But oftentimes traders will make their lives more difficult than they need to be."
"24176170","24177730"," Even quality traders though."
"24179770","24185030"," As years pass, you try to say, well, I can time this and I can time that and I get"
"24185030","24186390"," this right and they get that wrong. "
"24187690","24189730"," And then you get your ass blown out, right?"
"24191830","24192170"," You wind up."
"24192330","24196490"," You know, it's a good point in this is you yesterday at the close."
"24198570","24201930"," You've got a ball buyers yesterday at the close, right?"
"24202950","24208510"," That bought ball here and they still got their asses blown out up here. "
"24208510","24209370"," Does that make sense?"
"24210810","24214610"," So you could be like, yeah, I know I know that the Vix Vixpiration was yesterday."
"24215030","24220970"," So I'm buying this close here and then you wake up this morning and your ass got blown out because"
"24220970","24222030"," you timed it wrong, right?"
"24222990","24229070"," I'm bringing that up because it's easy to know what's happening, but not time things, right?"
"24229070","24233890"," It's easy to gamble away all your fucking money doing shit like this day trade."
"24233890","24236970"," And we weeklies, monthlies, you get some bad news. "
"24237230","24239230"," You didn't know about all kinds of nonsense."
"24241470","24247790"," So my point to you in this is that to be able to stay in this market over a time"
"24247790","24251610"," period, there's just some basic things that you do."
"24252730","24257930"," On a farther out in a lot of shorter and longer time frame. "
"24258910","24261250"," So there's a couple of things you're looking for."
"24262950","24271110"," You can apply this to, you can apply this to, you can apply this to, from the market to your"
"24271110","24273170"," stocks, but can't I'm trying to say too is this?"
"24274010","24277050"," We have what's called market fucking breath, okay?"
"24277790","24284650"," And this is where there's mass participation in selling the market."
"24287110","24296070"," And sometimes when we have this mass participation, you'll see a stock participate, an individual"
"24296070","24300670"," take a participate or not, or not so much as the rest of the market. "
"24301150","24306010"," I was trying to explain this if you've got a, if you've got like, like there's an example today"
"24306010","24307290"," would be a snap, right?"
"24307430","24309350"," It's sold off into their earnings."
"24309970","24311970"," They participated with the sell-off today."
"24312450","24318650"," You'll notice that some tickers did not participate as heavily in the market sell-off today. "
"24319090","24322130"," That's because some banks are long in these tickers, right?"
"24322310","24327990"," So you want, there's ways for you to identify what a bank is long in and what a bank is"
"24327990","24328730"," not long in."
"24329690","24334590"," If they participate in market rallies or market sell-offs, you ever notice how we have a market"
"24334590","24340590"," rally and you see that snap didn't participate, or as not as much as everybody else, or you notice"
"24340590","24343410"," that Facebook didn't participate, like everybody else did."
"24344310","24348370"," Just sometimes notice it with Tesla and the spy or the cues as well. "
"24348550","24351270"," They'll go their own way and that's because a bank is long in it."
"24352090","24357730"," But even with that being said, there is a movement to the market as a whole."
"24357730","24364570"," If you were to line up, people say, well, the small caps are BTV is on its own. "
"24364710","24366610"," It does better than small caps."
"24366870","24372290"," But if you line up those charts together, they tend to fall the same line."
"24372490","24380570"," If you line up the cues, you might have more amplified gains or losses, but there is a rise in"
"24380570","24384150"," fall that most stocks follow in the stock market. "
"24385330","24390870"," You might have a 100-point gain on Tesla, but only a 10-point game on Clorox."
"24391470","24397170"," Not a good example, but you'll see a 100-point swing down on Tesla and then only a 10-point"
"24397170","24398250"," swing down on Clorox."
"24400130","24409610"," So with all that being said there, with all that being said, we'll look at the spy, okay?"
"24410670","24412230"," So this is what I do. "
"24413410","24417950"," I've been trading for a long time and I have blown up shit tons of accounts."
"24418950","24420910"," I have blown up massive accounts."
"24421390","24423530"," I've lost six figures multiple times. "
"24426510","24429310"," And of course, that doesn't make me happy."
"24431290","24436310"," And I've heard every fucking excuse in the book about how to consistently make money in this"
"24436310","24436570"," market."
"24437330","24438410"," I've traded fucking Globex. "
"24439070","24440730"," I've done it all."
"24441250","24442230"," I've traded spreads."
"24442650","24445170"," I've done fucking, you know, run the fucking wheel. "
"24445610","24445890"," Like this."
"24446150","24452530"," So you're like, yeah, I made 10% nine times and then I got blown the fuck up for my"
"24452530","24454590"," whole fucking account and that one trade, right?"
"24456490","24460350"," So I'm always, and of course we're all trying to sell ourselves."
"24460350","24465830"," We're all trying to sell how great of investors we are and traders we are out there. "
"24466370","24470770"," And I get pissed off sometimes because I'm like some of the easiest ways to make money in this"
"24470770","24476310"," market, not just by buying a stock and holding it until it comes back."
"24478070","24485490"," But to actually make consistent money, money that will help you to retire, help you to not work a"
"24485490","24488910"," job, buy the house of your dreams, all that kind of stuff."
"24489810","24491850"," And I've only found one consistent way to do it. "
"24491970","24492430"," It's so basic."
"24492630","24495290"," Everybody knows about it, but nobody actually has a discipline to trade it."
"24496410","24499050"," So we're going to look at two things. "
"24501050","24501890"," So we'll do that."
"24501990","24505410"," I've done this before with, I should, I should, I should cut this out of the video."
"24505570","24508710"," I can't, I can't download this YouTube video. "
"24508870","24509710"," We got to record one of these."
"24510290","24515210"," So, you know, as a matter of fact, I got kind of known for when to buy the dip last"
"24515210","24516110"," couple of years, right?"
"24516250","24519090"," I jumped on Twitter a couple of years ago and they were like, I used to be on Wall Street"
"24519090","24521350"," Bets and I jumped on Twitter because I fucking eat Wall Street Bets now."
"24521470","24524170"," But you have a regime here, right?"
"24526210","24527090"," And there's a comment. "
"24527090","24534730"," There's a smart-ass commentary, smart-ass commentary on, on, on social media where they say, oh,"
"24534730","24537650"," yeah, you could buy the dip down here and you were fine."
"24537950","24541430"," Intuitive surgical ISRG, $1.13 per share."
"24542910","24548930"," You know, that beats the 107 consensus estimate, $1.49 billion in revenue beats the 1.44 consensus"
"24548930","24549630"," estimate. "
"24551170","24556410"," There's this commentary that, if you're a bull that you could just buy anywhere here and it"
"24556410","24557110"," eventually printed."
"24557870","24561050"," And that you could be a dumb trader, a stupid trader and make money."
"24561850","24569310"," And then their point was also, once we came over here, that you couldn't, that you can't make money"
"24569310","24577750"," in a market that's falling, that you don't know where to buy when a market is falling, that, you"
"24577750","24580010"," know, this is, this is, this is destroying bulls. "
"24580970","24584050"," Now, I do agree that it is destroying some bulls out there."
"24584050","24586690"," A lot of bulls, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of retail traders."
"24587630","24594730"," I agree with that statement, but it's not through, not, not investing or trading dumb. "
"24595570","24601250"," It's by not having this, using the same tools that work best here, still apply to over here."
"24601610","24604050"," It's just that nobody ran those tools over here."
"24604390","24609950"," No, nobody ran those tools here and didn't, didn't use them again in this regime. "
"24610270","24611610"," So this tool is very basic."
"24611610","24613010"," Everybody knows about it."
"24613270","24616510"," Everybody talks about it, but nobody fucking does it. "
"24618010","24619490"," And that's where you get into problems."
"24620030","24624810"," So I used to complicate my trading and I've simplified trading."
"24625470","24627490"," I've simplified how I look at things. "
"24627870","24635870"," Like when I read a complex paper or a report from, from the internet or from, from watching some"
"24635870","24639150"," complicated YouTube video or reading a book or any of those kind of things."
"24640050","24646490"," But a lot of you don't realize that no one will admit to you, is behind a closed door, that"
"24646490","24653650"," long time traders, investors, professionals, they do, they simplify a lot of what they do."
"24654830","24660570"," The rest of them, not all of them, the rest of them are selling a service to you, or they're"
"24660570","24663310"," selling something where they can get paid for an article. "
"24664310","24665690"," They sound smart."
"24665690","24667470"," It's not no bad on those people."
"24667750","24671530"," But in the background, when you actually find out what's going on there, they're actually making"
"24671530","24675850"," pretty fucking basic money, almost guaranteed money making trades. "
"24676730","24681370"," And I was talking about this the other day in chat that there was some, there was some leaked texts"
"24681370","24686150"," and emails from the Hindenburg report that came out."
"24686450","24692470"," And when, when you read those fucking things, they're fucking, they're fucking buying zero-day puts"
"24692470","24693650"," and zero-day calls."
"24694110","24698930"," And they're making, you know, they're, everybody sounds smart like they know what they're doing,"
"24698930","24702710"," and you find out what they're actually doing, and it's not as complicated as you think. "
"24703570","24707590"," Now some people are like, hey, I want to be smart, I want to be a smart trader, and I"
"24707590","24709730"," want to beat the system because I'm more intelligent than you."
"24710070","24712330"," But it's just not required by a retail trader."
"24712590","24715270"," It's not required by a retail investor. "
"24716190","24717970"," It's, it's just not fucking required."
"24717970","24723950"," And we over-complicate, I think that traders and investors over-complicate what they're doing."
"24726270","24728590"," So, but here's the other part, everybody likes to be risky. "
"24728950","24730970"," Everybody loves to find a company they love."
"24731470","24733670"," Everybody loves to hate, let's say you love, let's say you hate Tesla."
"24734350","24738190"," So you're going to start buying puts on Tesla, you're going to start shorting Tesla, and you make"
"24738190","24740950"," one wrong move and Tesla goes up a thousand points to blow up your account. "
"24741770","24744330"," It's fine for you to take those forays into the market."
"24744950","24748070"," If you have a way to provide those funds consistently."
"24749850","24758250"," So, if you were to say in the last two years, if you were to say in 2020-2021, that"
"24758250","24763590"," you could just buy anywhere in the print, there were still some key places to buy. "
"24764430","24767410"," And I think later, 2021, there was every OPEX."
"24768690","24773090"," But I remember, come on, it's supposed to be like, this is where we buy, this is where we buy,"
"24773190","24774530"," this is where we buy, this is where we"
"24774530","24796110"," buy."
"24796110","24802570"," And I'm going to explain to you why it's difficult later and why you shouldn't need me to do this,"
"24802650","24802810"," right?"
"24804810","24809610"," Who talks about this often is Mike, who was on stream earlier. "
"24810070","24814610"," He talks about this in his broadcasts all the time."
"24815470","24821350"," Not this specific thing, but something like this, where he looks at the market threat and it's"
"24821350","24823570"," important why it matters."
"24823570","24830790"," And that price doesn't matter as much as market breadth matters and how the market moves together"
"24830790","24832790"," as a team, right, or as a group. "
"24834530","24836630"," So, in this regime."
"24836990","24840550"," Snap, SNAP revenue, $1.06 billion."
"24841870","24845430"," That's in line with the $1.05 consensus estimate for snap. "
"24846130","24848910"," Headline loss of $0.22 a share adjusted."
"24849110","24849910"," Not good enough."
"24850210","24855470"," Seen flat to $0.50 million in the second quarter revenue up 20 to 25%. "
"24855470","24862410"," And the current quarter adjusted even at $0.64.5 million and adjusted loss of $0.02 per share for"
"24862410","24862950"," SNAP."
"24863470","24864450"," Not good enough."
"24870160","24871500"," That's not good enough. "
"24877390","24879590"," Now down to $0.2347 on snap."
"24881070","24882150"," How do you fuck up?"
"24882150","24882730"," You know what it is?"
"24882790","24884330"," You've got to fire all that fucking upper management."
"24886490","24889370"," You've got these kind of like Netflix, these companies, man. "
"24892670","24894910"," I'm not a Republican, by the way."
"24895470","24902570"," But I'll tell you what, it's like the crazy crazy left this and the crazy crazy crazy run right."
"24903690","24909370"," When both sides are, either one of those two sides are in charge, things go fucking stupid. "
"24910550","24912490"," I thought Sam came out before."
"24914690","24916590"," I guess Sam hasn't come out yet."
"24920130","24921670"," I shouldn't even say it's political. "
"24922110","24924010"," Maybe it's just people that think they're better than everybody else."
"24925170","24925210"," Right?"
"24925810","24927010"," Black pastor had that same problem."
"24927330","24927530"," Okay. "
"24927810","24930470"," So they're smarter than everybody else."
"24931490","24931970"," Okay."
"24932490","24933390"," Drinkin' too much Kool-Aid. "
"24941250","24943530"," So I want to see something to compare something."
"24943790","24943910"," Okay."
"24944110","24950730"," This market was heading up here and we still had market capitulation moments. "
"24952850","24953410"," Right?"
"24955590","24958270"," It's almost, it's forced buying."
"24961010","24962530"," It's forced buying."
"24962970","24971310"," And what's interesting is the last time I saw one, I think it was Ackman or Niles or somebody said,"
"24972010","24977990"," the market's going up whether you want it to or not. "
"24980490","24984850"," And the reason they were saying that was because we were at one of those moments where the market's"
"24984850","24985710"," forced to be bought."
"24986030","24989110"," Now, I'm going to show you a moment where you'll say that's not true and I'm going to show you"
"24989110","24991630"," even in, even in March 2020 where yes, it was true."
"24992670","24994210"," So you have these moments. "
"24994750","24995690"," Now price doesn't matter."
"24995830","24996710"," We're heading up here, right?"
"24997950","25000930"," And we still have market breadth capitulations."
"25002410","25003810"," That's in, that's in Bulltown. "
"25004050","25007550"," I want to show it to you down here in, in March 2020."
"25008950","25010990"," So you had this rollover down here, right?"
"25012630","25014170"," See this rollover down here?"
"25014570","25015690"," You see it right here, right?"
"25015830","25016410"," I want you to see it."
"25017610","25020010"," And you might think to yourself, well, we tagged. "
"25020990","25024070"," So let's say in March, let's say in March 2020 you were oblivious to COVID."
"25024190","25025510"," You didn't even know who was going on."
"25025510","25028490"," We blasted off down below down here, right?"
"25029150","25030450"," We, we ripped down. "
"25031030","25037770"," You got every fucking bear and his fucking brother telling you that the fucking world's going to"
"25037770","25038830"," end in this doom and gloom."
"25040190","25042510"," So let's say you blast off down here, right?"
"25043350","25044450"," You start ripping down here."
"25044650","25044730"," Boom. "
"25044910","25045990"," You hit market capitulation."
"25046030","25046550"," You hit a bottom."
"25047050","25050770"," Let's say you know that's COVID, but you see this happen down here, right?"
"25051630","25054630"," If you see this in your bear, you would take profit. "
"25055610","25058650"," And, and because you're going to know that we're going to rip higher, right?"
"25058830","25060310"," Now we didn't rip higher for long."
"25060430","25061770"," We ended up rolling over here, right?"
"25062510","25064710"," So you would have, you would have, you would have rolled over."
"25065170","25066810"," You wouldn't have even been long here. "
"25067030","25069610"," I always say people go, well, I always say people up here go."
"25070270","25072270"," Oh, oh, everybody got caught this up here."
"25072390","25073810"," I'm like, that's fucking bullshit, man. "
"25074330","25075310"," I'm going to explain to you why."
"25076190","25077630"," Because when you're down here, right?"
"25077630","25080390"," And you're going to make your nine or 10 trades a year."
"25080690","25080830"," Let's see. "
"25080930","25081770"," We go down here, right?"
"25082570","25088010"," And if I go in with $100,000 on some call spreads, right?"
"25088210","25092250"," At 285.51. 285.51, right?"
"25093130","25099110"," What do I need to get those to print between 1 and 300 or 500 percent, right?"
"25099430","25100390"," 286, right?"
"25100630","25103010"," We went all the way up to 313, 312."
"25103930","25105610"," I'm going to get 100 percent print off that."
"25106270","25106950"," Does that make sense?"
"25106950","25109510"," So if I buy that bottom, right?"
"25109930","25116650"," And I'm going to sell at my 100 percent sell and take my money and run with my large trade. "
"25117690","25121970"," I don't care if the market continued up in March, 2020."
"25122650","25125730"," I could give a rat's ass less if it continues to go up."
"25126190","25128490"," Because I'm not in the trade for this whole move. "
"25129010","25134010"," I'm only in the trade for that capitulation moment for a limit sell."
"25135330","25140210"," I know if I buy down here with enough time on it that it's coming back as well."
"25141110","25142750"," So let's say I made my trade here. "
"25142810","25143470"," I made my money."
"25144070","25145890"," And I'm waiting for this to finish."
"25147210","25148290"," And we end up rolling over. "
"25148350","25149390"," It doesn't matter to me."
"25149870","25154290"," Because the next time we hit this bottom down below here, I know that I can buy it again."
"25154450","25157050"," Matter of fact, I could have bought it there and I could have bought it right here. "
"25157050","25160210"," Austin, dear, S.A.M. reporting results."
"25161270","25163170"," First quarter net revenue, 40 million."
"25165870","25167350"," It's a 473 consensus. "
"25167930","25168650"," It's alpha Michael."
"25169450","25170370"," Depletions decreased."
"25170850","25171910"," 7% in the first quarter. "
"25174130","25181130"," Jim, it's decreased to 25.1% versus S.A.M. Now, the point behind this is this."
"25182110","25186630"," You would have known COVID was going on even if you didn't, even if you didn't wasn't, if you were"
"25186630","25188710"," not disciplined enough, right?"
"25188710","25192210"," If you are not disciplined enough, let's say you lost one of these trades."
"25192630","25193690"," It's still only one. "
"25194170","25196810"," And this is one of the worst moments in recent history, right?"
"25197170","25200690"," We haven't had moments like this in recent history."
"25200950","25202590"," We don't have these don't happen frequently."
"25203250","25205230"," You don't see moves down like this. "
"25205550","25206430"," We had COVID."
"25206810","25211250"," So even in these, this environment, you should do well if you're disciplined in the trade."
"25211750","25216670"," Now, when these events don't happen, generally speaking, and let's say I'm doing this with 10% of"
"25216670","25222950"," my account 10 times a year, I still could have lost this entire trade and I would still be up"
"25222950","25224530"," 90%, right?"
"25224910","25226350"," Compounding every trade I take. "
"25227070","25233050"," So my point to is even if you have a catastrophic loss, you're not blowing up your account over the"
"25233050","25234030"," course of years."
"25234870","25237550"," So with that being said, let's talk more on this subject."
"25237790","25238130"," It's important. "
"25239130","25240910"," Now, this is where things get difficult."
"25240910","25242670"," I'm going to show you now this."
"25242890","25244850"," I've run this back about 30 years. "
"25244870","25245670"," I've run up here."
"25245810","25251670"," I've run it on farther back in SPX and then on the New York composite."
"25252350","25256070"," Now, the key to this trade is you can't run this on the queues. "
"25256210","25261630"," You can't run it on an individual ticker because this accounts for this trade accounts for the"
"25261630","25263330"," components of the S&P 500."
"25263950","25266290"," You can see the components over here on the right, right?"
"25266630","25269150"," Utilities, tech, real estate, materials."
"25269150","25271270"," You can see the list down below. "
"25271790","25274730"," Now, it's looking for a full liquidation moment in the market."
"25275110","25278310"," Now, you can see we've had them consistently, right?"
"25278470","25282370"," One, two, three, four, five, six, over here, seven."
"25282610","25283890"," These are guaranteed, right?"
"25284490","25286770"," If you're waiting for another one over here, you got another one right here. "
"25286990","25289870"," And then you might say, yeah, hey, Cap, well, that doesn't work, right?"
"25290030","25292470"," You'll hear bears say that doesn't work when the market's rolling over."
"25292770","25293810"," It doesn't fucking work."
"25294010","25296510"," That's a fucking goddamn lie, okay?"
"25296870","25298210"," It's a goddamn fucking lie. "
"25299470","25300630"," It worked right here."
"25300790","25302110"," You can see right down below here."
"25302290","25303250"," You would have made this trade. "
"25303730","25305210"," You have taken this trade at capitulation."
"25305850","25306790"," You'd be sitting in the market."
"25306790","25309050"," You'd know that the market's selling off. "
"25309270","25312570"," When these events happen, you know we have capitulation."
"25312690","25317630"," We have straight fucking down over the course of one to three days, right?"
"25317830","25320770"," The market just screams to a halt, okay?"
"25321070","25322670"," Everything bottoms the fuck out."
"25323210","25326870"," If you don't buy just, if you bought a naked call, not a call, a naked call, if you bought"
"25326870","25331230"," a call, you know they can kill those, even if the market comes back up, right?"
"25331590","25335410"," So, if you buy yourself just the call spread, do a debit. "
"25335750","25336350"," You could do a credit."
"25336690","25340550"," There's more rules that are inside of the sub that I have."
"25341430","25347710"," But basically a fucking debit call spread, I like to make them for like 300%. "
"25348370","25353350"," I do 300% and I capture just the first hundred and take a walk."
"25353350","25356710"," And that has to do with the mechanics of a call spread."
"25356930","25361430"," You normally only make 25-50% in the beginning of that trade depending on how much time you put"
"25361430","25361710"," on it. "
"25362010","25366030"," If you make a call spread that's a month and a half out, typically if we come into the money,"
"25366090","25370970"," I'll typically only make 25-50% of that spread and the rest of the money they make in that"
"25370970","25372970"," spread is at the end of that spread."
"25373130","25374670"," I don't want to hold those spreads to the end."
"25375130","25381330"," I want to hold them just for that first 25-50%, which technically on a 300% spread is going"
"25381330","25384110"," to print like 100% of the actual cash I paid for it. "
"25384590","25386950"," I don't know if you get all that, but you need to watch some YouTube videos."
"25388210","25394270"," So, when you see these moments and if you put enough time on them in case you fuck up, let's"
"25394270","25396470"," say you don't get your 100%, right?"
"25396590","25402510"," Or the 10% of your real accounts, your money that you're trading, let's say you say shit, I fucked"
"25402510","25404010"," this up and we didn't get my 100%."
"25404590","25407490"," But you have a month and a half on that trade, right?"
"25408030","25409670"," This is where it gets challenging. "
"25410070","25411130"," You might see your trade."
"25411510","25417290"," Let's say you spend 100 grand and your trade goes to 80 or 90 and it doesn't get you your"
"25417290","25417610"," 100."
"25417790","25419270"," You have to be able to be disciplined. "
"25419830","25421090"," You might just take your 90 and run."
"25421490","25424290"," But you might be disciplined and say fuck that, I'm holding it to 100."
"25424890","25429950"," I'm sticking to my fucking rules and you have sitting on it and losing 80%, maybe not 80, but like"
"25429950","25431170"," 70% of that trade. "
"25431750","25435850"," And then it comes back up at the end after a month and a half and it actually prints you"
"25435850","25437310"," fucking 300%."
"25437310","25438070"," Right?"
"25438390","25442290"," Towards the expiry, which you would see happen down over here."
"25443270","25448530"," So enough time on your trade, you're looking for certain moments in the market and you start to"
"25448530","25458450"," even look when the market is rolling over and we hit these moments even in a rollover where we have"
"25458450","25459610"," market capitulation. "
"25460150","25463270"," Now, some guys the other day, I probably would have missed this trade."
"25463270","25465130"," This trade, I would have missed."
"25465390","25469290"," Now, if I'm, it was me and you in social media, you're going to say fuck you, Captain. "
"25470090","25472270"," You missed this entire trade right here."
"25472910","25474590"," How could you miss this trade, Captain?"
"25475270","25475550"," Right?"
"25475950","25477610"," How could you miss this giant fucking runner?"
"25478310","25480310"," And it's because it doesn't meet my fucking rules."
"25480470","25485050"," I have to have certain rules for this trade to be met every single time. "
"25485470","25487090"," Or 9 out of 10 times."
"25487690","25491630"," And to be honest with you, 20 fucking 9 out of 30 times."
"25492110","25494710"," Out of 30 of those trades, I only want to lose one. "
"25495150","25495850"," Maybe two."
"25496550","25502650"," If I do this and go full-tits, we'll pull in on these trades, I have a high chance of"
"25502650","25505210"," them printing and printing very fucking well."
"25505570","25507410"," And especially on the S&P 500. "
"25507930","25512850"," I don't have to show you guys a chart of the S&P 500 to the last fucking 30, 20 "
"25512850","25513470","-something years."
"25514150","25514190"," Right?"
"25514410","25516550"," Go straight the fuck up or the New York Stock Exchange."
"25517210","25518350"," It's not nice to not the New York Stock Exchange. "
"25518570","25519550"," New York got a composite."
"25519550","25520950"," It goes straight up."
"25521250","25522470"," It's been going straight up. "
"25523110","25528510"," Since the beginning of the United States of America, even in the 1930s, even in the fucking crashes"
"25528510","25535790"," that we've had in 87, in the 80s and the 2000s, it still gets bought every fucking time."
"25536150","25540990"," You'll always hear people in the crash in 87 say, some of the rips higher or even better the rips"
"25540990","25541290"," lower."
"25542030","25544670"," Timing the tops of these markets is never fucking easy. "
"25545270","25548110"," But I'll tell you in the world, just as you can see it here, you can get a put spread"
"25548110","25548530"," up here."
"25548530","25551270"," But see this put spread here?"
"25551710","25554450"," You can also have relentless buying on the way up."
"25555250","25555290"," Right?"
"25555470","25557230"," So this doesn't always work. "
"25558190","25562830"," This breath indicator doesn't always work as the market rotates rolling over."
"25563070","25568350"," But you probably have a lower weight rate on the put spread side."
"25568670","25573310"," But generally speaking, the problem with this trade is not that it's easy. "
"25573870","25579890"," It's managing the trade, managing the stress that you're under, managing listening to people on"
"25579890","25584690"," social media tell you that the fucking world's going to burn and die, managing your own stress"
"25584690","25586610"," saying, I don't want to lose all this money."
"25587010","25589210"," It's not easy trading large amounts of money."
"25590330","25594010"," And so you have to keep that stress or manage that stress. "
"25594590","25600730"," But what's crazy is when you do this, if you do this with me over the next year, you're going"
"25600730","25605690"," to be able to learn how to manage a trade like this, learn how to not stress about it or"
"25605690","25610190"," manage the stress about this trade, but then learn how to consistently make money in this market."
"25610770","25614550"," So if you do this now, if you're, I don't recommend that you follow me in this trade."
"25614630","25619170"," I recommend that you follow me as I make the trades, and track the trades with me on the account"
"25619170","25626330"," so that you can find a dumb, down, consistent way that if you wanted to walk away from the market,"
"25626750","25627490"," let's say you're like, fuck it. "
"25627550","25629630"," I don't want to be in the market where we go hiking, biking, skiing."
"25630050","25630970"," I've made enough money."
"25631110","25632710"," I don't need anybody's money anymore. "
"25632710","25635270"," But I do still want to make money off the market."
"25635610","25639830"," Then you know, you know that you can just use something like this."
"25640470","25645670"," And whenever it hits, you get a little alarm on your phone that says, pick up, it's time to buy"
"25645670","25646090"," the market. "
"25647290","25649910"," And you know that you can go in, you can buy the market, go in heavy."
"25650570","25654110"," And if you put enough time on that trade, that it's going to print for you."
"25654210","25655370"," It's going to fucking print. "
"25655610","25659590"," And if it doesn't fucking print to 300%, it's going to fucking print 100 or less."
"25659950","25662510"," Do I think that you should go in on this trade with all of your account?"
"25662990","25663350"," Fuck no."
"25664170","25666390"," But I know that some of you guys out there are new traders. "
"25666710","25668550"," So I know you want, so we're going to do it for a thousand bucks."
"25669030","25673450"," And I'm doing this as a lesson, but a learning experience."
"25673510","25679290"," I'll do it 100% each time to show you how to actually build an account so that you don't"
"25679290","25681370"," have to worry about this shit ever again. "
"25681830","25684790"," Now, do I think that any of you following me are going to follow me through to this?"
"25685070","25685470"," Fuck no."
"25686390","25691210"," I think three quarters to 90% of you will never follow me through."
"25691450","25695050"," We'll never follow through this trade with me because then you're coming out towards the end. "
"25695430","25698490"," Yeah, we're going to drop $500,000 on some calls down here."
"25699470","25704010"," I'll tell you what, by the ninth trade or so, I call it by the seventh trade."
"25704690","25708030"," We'll be down here buying this shit and two things will happen. "
"25708850","25712950"," If you follow me, you ain't fucking trading anything else because you're going to panic."
"25713870","25717490"," If you follow me, you probably won't even do it."
"25717670","25721950"," You'll just lie and say, fuck yeah, I'm doing it, but I don't only do it with fucking 10 grand"
"25721950","25727190"," or 50 grand because it takes a fucking balls of steel to make these trades. "
"25727630","25732550"," And it takes balls of fucking steel to hold them and not worry about them knowing that they're"
"25732550","25733830"," going to print, right?"
"25734230","25739430"," Because you're working with a lot of fucking money and you need this money to fill the fuck off in"
"25739430","25739730"," the market."
"25739730","25741490"," You want to go buy some fucking zero dates?"
"25741930","25743850"," You want to go buy some fucking Tesla at the top?"
"25744070","25744790"," You can do that."
"25745510","25746230"," You can do that. "
"25746550","25752130"," You want to buy the actual S&P 500 and sell calls and sell puts on it and be rich?"
"25752410","25752990"," You can do that."
"25753170","25759430"," If you fall down the gambling hole of trading the stock market, you can't do that without having"
"25759430","25763210"," some kind of a tool that's almost 100%, it's not 100% guaranteed."
"25763730","25768270"," But if you do 10% of your accounts and you do it every fucking time, like a stickler, and"
"25768270","25772410"," you only lose that one trade, you are going to win over all every year. "
"25772730","25774190"," Year in, and year out."
"25774410","25778530"," It's in a big reversal and snap after initially moving lower shares up a couple points."
"25779370","25780110"," After hours. "
"25780950","25781690"," Oh, yeah."
"25782290","25782750"," Oh, yeah."
"25782910","25783290"," Trust me. "
"25783590","25784230"," I've done that."
"25784710","25785770"," I've done that."
"25786410","25790530"," So my point to you, if you're still tuning in now, if you're like new to the channel or new"
"25790530","25793390"," to this thing, this is the implication of what I'm talking to you about. "
"25793670","25798310"," So you're not going to get on that handle me telling you, oh, yeah, we're going up tableways."
"25798530","25799790"," You're not going to get that from me."
"25800110","25803010"," You're going to be getting me waiting for seasonal green mark down here. "
"25803110","25803630"," This is a green line."
"25803890","25808110"," You're going to wait for this to happen and or get close to it happen."
"25808330","25809950"," It can accelerate when it happens. "
"25809990","25811190"," It's usually quite fucking faster."
"25811410","25811990"," It does happen."
"25812470","25815710"," And we're going to also look at some other market conditions, right?"
"25815930","25817590"," Are we fucking selling the shit out of this?"
"25818150","25819770"," Are we, is the market breath low?"
"25820410","25822310"," Is there only an capitulation moment in the market?"
"25822610","25824090"," Are the technicals all right, right?"
"25824250","25825730"," Are the technicals lining up as well?"
"25825730","25830050"," So we add all those things together and then we look at the market, and the market breath indicator"
"25830050","25831810"," is that one last piece of that puzzle. "
"25832830","25838650"," And once the market is completely fucking 100% oversold, we're going to go full tits bore into this"
"25838650","25838910"," trade."
"25839670","25843910"," When we go full tits bore into this trade, we hold it, we diamond hand it to put enough time"
"25843910","25845530"," on it and eventually it prints."
"25846110","25847470"," Now that's some dumb down shit. "
"25848250","25854710"," Well, fucking tell you what, I know for a fucking fact that a whole shit ton of you out there"
"25854710","25858830"," don't make mid six figures or higher every fucking year."
"25859530","25860150"," I know it."
"25860910","25862050"," I know it. "
"25862450","25866470"," I know it because I can see the fucking, I know it because I can see the fucking, I can"
"25866470","25867270"," see some of you have jobs."
"25867550","25872690"," I can see it because when you look and find out how many people actually make high six figures in"
"25872690","25874130"," this country, it is low as fuck."
"25874570","25876310"," It is super fucking low. "
"25876910","25878310"," And it's because we do stupid shit."
"25879030","25881390"," We over complicate things to make things complicated."
"25882550","25886370"," So when I do this trade with you this year, you're going to get one year of these trades for"
"25886370","25886530"," me. "
"25887150","25888790"," And then I'm done on social media."
"25889270","25890410"," I am fucking out."
"25891050","25896650"," That's my one gift to social media is that we're going to manage these trades for the over the"
"25896650","25897230"," course of a year. "
"25898270","25900290"," And I don't give a fuck of this market."
"25900290","25904050"," I don't give a fuck of this market sells down to a hundred fucking dollars."
"25904570","25906490"," This shit works every fucking time. "
"25907850","25909350"," Every fucking time."
"25910210","25914090"," You burn money in the street and this trade works every single time."
"25914550","25915210"," They have algorithms. "
"25915670","25917430"," They have banks that have to buy this market."
"25917610","25919110"," They're required to buy this fucking market."
"25919650","25923130"," And there are triggers where they will buy this market no matter where the fuck we sell to. "
"25924390","25924870"," All right."
"25924890","25925750"," That's all I got for you today."
"25928710","25931730"," So you might say watching this video, Hey, this is easy. "
"25931850","25932670"," I can do this on my own."
"25933310","25939990"," The only thing that the real, the real take of this trade, the real meat of this is knowing when"
"25939990","25941190"," to execute it, right?"
"25941650","25945270"," Knowing how to manage the stress as it grows."
"25945950","25948850"," Or it even starts to sell off for a day or two or a week or two. "
"25949190","25952790"," Trust me, you make a trade like that with enough money and you have to sit through two weeks of"
"25952790","25954670"," bullshit for it to start printing."
"25954950","25955290"," It sucks."
"25956510","25959870"," I don't know if you've ever done that before, but it's not fucking pretty. "
"25960310","25961910"," You start to second guess your trade."
"25962090","25963370"," You start to second guess yourself."
"25963910","25965870"," You start to ask other people what they think. "
"25966530","25969010"," And you're not even telling them that you're in this kind of a trade."
"25969610","25971090"," And then you know, you're getting doom and gloom."
"25971290","25974110"," I've had fucking trades do that haven't printed until the day. "
"25975090","25975970"," The day."
"25976970","25977410"," I've expired."
"25978390","25979610"," The day of expire. "
"25979850","25980130"," Are they printed?"
"25980590","25982810"," Like that's how fucked up sometimes these things can get."
"25983230","25983670"," So."
"25985750","25986570"," Follow along. "
"25988530","25992750"," If you're, you know, if you don't care about this stuff, tune up and that part of what this channel"
"25992750","25993130"," is."
"25993130","25995630"," But this channel is running this challenge."
"25995650","26000030"," It's really isn't a challenge like pay your, I don't know, like some kind of stock bumper or"
"26000030","26000330"," something. "
"26000770","26005910"," This is a challenge for me to show you guys how to consistently make money in this market on the"
"26005910","26007290"," S&P five fucking hundred."
"26007630","26008230"," All right."
"26008310","26014190"," So that you can go off and run around and fucking fuck off with whatever shit stock you like or"
"26014190","26015390"," whatever shit stock you hate. "
"26015670","26016350"," Whatever that is."
"26017130","26022130"," And if we're here to trade day trading together, you can at least say, oh fuck, I burned 10 grand"
"26022130","26022410"," today."
"26022610","26027650"," I don't give a fuck because I've got this other tool that I use to always have money in my"
"26027650","26029290"," pocket, no matter what. "
"26030050","26034150"," Because if you do, I'm going to tell you, if you're just out there trading like buying Tesla,"
"26034510","26037490"," buying Apple, selling Tesla, whatever the fucking is you're doing."
"26038110","26043270"," And if you look at the numbers for investors and traders, right, when you hear and when you hear 97 "
"26043270","26048370","% lose all their money, that's how they lose all their money because they don't have a way to make"
"26048370","26049790"," consistent money in this market."
"26050310","26052670"," Or they're constantly funneling money in from their jobs. "
"26053210","26057830"," You have to find a tool that consistently prints for you so that you can be part of that three"
"26057830","26063410"," percent, part of that 10% of the market that can stay in this market, that can weather getting an"
"26063410","26067410"," account blown up that has money in their savings, that rolls there."
"26067570","26072250"," We'll talk about that later, but as you make these trades with me in the year passes, we'll talk"
"26072250","26076950"," about how to roll your money out of the stock market and to invest it in better investments."
"26077890","26080990"," And then if you ever need that money, if you ever blow up a country and come back to you,"
"26081110","26084630"," these are exponential ways to be well off in your life. "
"26084950","26086950"," But simplify it right now."
"26087430","26092190"," If you're here in the market to make money, we'll make these trades as only nine to 12 a year."
"26092750","26095050"," When they come, we're ready to take them. "
"26096390","26097570"," Have a wonderful afternoon."
"26104450","26108470"," Yeah, I don't care if we do."
"26108470","26110190"," I could give a rat's ass if we got a bottom. "
"26110710","26111750"," I could care less."
"26116080","26118280"," Yeah, and this is the indicator down below here."
"26118920","26122420"," And you can see when the breath, and you know, it's crazy about this. "
"26122600","26123580"," Look at this with me right now."
"26124220","26127000"," Before we even stop the live stream, right?"
"26127320","26132360"," You can see, so you've got everybody screaming out there even today, right?"
"26133220","26134640"," What the market is today?"
"26134980","26136840"," And the fucking market hasn't sold off yet."
"26137640","26141440"," The fucking market hasn't fucking given up its tits yet. "
"26142220","26148080"," You haven't shaken the last dollar out of the market today for everything that happened today."
"26148520","26154120"," But we're still at fucking 58, 57.8% out of 1100."
"26155000","26158160"," We still haven't drained the fucking market down to nothing yet. "
"26158660","26159360"," Isn't that fucking wild?"
"26160320","26161640"," Still, still."
"26162740","26166320"," So if you were like, hey, I'm going to buy this bottom down here and I'm going to go all"
"26166320","26171480"," the way with 100% of my accounts, I would say you're fucking taking on a huge ass risk."
"26172260","26174560"," You might, it might bounce tomorrow and you might win. "
"26175260","26181460"," But I'm telling you, in the grand scheme of real risk, you're going to get fucked up one of these"
"26181460","26183760"," days and blow the fuck out of your account."
"26183960","26185300"," Maybe not be not, maybe not today."
"26186100","26188660"," You put two or three or four of those with taxes. "
"26189040","26190180"," You roll taxes into that."
"26190420","26193120"," You've met some bad trades on Tesla or Apple or something."
"26193120","26196180"," Now, I guarantee you, you'll be gone in three to five years. "
"26196220","26198040"," You will not be trading anymore."
"26198280","26198780"," You'll be gone."
"26199620","26204120"," And then 10 years, or you're going to make these bad trades for 10 years. "
"26204520","26208900"," And if you keep sticking with it, you will eventually get a baseball bat to the head so many times"
"26208900","26209800"," that you say fuck this."
"26210440","26212500"," I'm going to remember what Cap Jim told me to do."
"26213400","26216580"," And you wait for market breath or market capitulation. "
"26217120","26221420"," Every time is market capitulation, you step in with the banks and you buy with them and you ride"
"26221420","26223520"," with those guys because those guys are the big boys."
"26231230","26232590"," Well, that's the last point."
"26232910","26235270"," Jade pasture is like, well, that's the point, right?"
"26235430","26235950"," You get itchy. "
"26236030","26237090"," You're like, I want it now."
"26237590","26239090"," I want it right fucking now."
"26241630","26242030"," Yeah. "
"26242210","26245130"," No, so what I'll do is when we get here, so here's the rules."
"26245910","26246010"," Okay."
"26246430","26250210"," Normally I don't trade on Robinhood, but I got a small, I opened a small Robin and I put a"
"26250210","26251730"," thousand bucks in it. "
"26252490","26254930"," And I'm going to live trade that account with you."
"26254930","26257670"," You'll see me live stream and buy the exec."
"26257970","26261010"," You'll see me buy and sell the spreads. "
"26261350","26267110"," You'll see the exact time I place them and we'll monitor the trade all the way along through its"
"26267110","26267370"," life."
"26268790","26274310"," There's a high chance that I lose this trade, but I'm going to go in 100% to each one"
"26274310","26274710"," of these trades."
"26274950","26279850"," So if I do a thousand, I'll do two thousand and I'll do four thousand and we'll run this over"
"26279850","26280630"," the course of a year. "
"26281430","26285690"," Mostly to prove the point of how do you build it, how do you build an account?"
"26285910","26289570"," And then during this time period, I'm going to talk to you about what to do with your money, how"
"26289570","26295210"," to pay taxes on this money, and then also how to get your money out of the stock market and"
"26295210","26301510"," invest in something better than the stock market, so that you guys can not risk all of your money."
"26301850","26304950"," Now, I don't recommend you do this with me 100% or 100%."
"26304950","26307910"," I think you do like, if you get a thousand dollar account, do it 100 bucks. "
"26308190","26308730"," Do it 50 bucks."
"26308730","26313490"," If you want to try more money, you can try more money."
"26314890","26317270"," Normally, I only do this with about 10% of my account. "
"26317770","26318130"," That's it."
"26318630","26319570"," Like 10%."
"26319570","26320230"," Right?"
"26320590","26323130"," And it's 10% every time I take the winnings and run. "
"26323690","26326210"," 10% every single time I take the money and run."
"26327030","26328010"," And it's consistent."
"26328550","26330710"," It keeps me in this game no matter what. "
"26332350","26333970"," So I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow."
"26335610","26338050"," Looks like future or looks like earnings today."
"26338910","26339690"," Kind of shitty. "
"26341110","26342550"," I'll see you guys tomorrow morning."
"26342650","26343210"," I have to get up."
"26344490","26345910"," Yesterday, I was supposed to get a permit. "
"26347510","26348970"," Building permit, I didn't."
"26349070","26352450"," And then today, I was supposed to get a building permit where you fucking went to the moon."
"26352650","26354030"," Went to the fucking moon today. "
"26355250","26356210"," So I didn't."
"26356630","26358470"," So I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow."
"26359370","26362310"," Try to be here at nine tomorrow for the last day of the week. "
"26362310","26366730"," If there's anything crazy going out of the market, if I can see that it's going crazy, I'll be"
"26366730","26367010"," here."
"26367470","26371950"," If the market is flat sideways since tomorrow, I might show up and then bounce at some point."
"26372810","26376290"," Because I got to get down there during like regular hours during the week. "
"26376970","26378790"," I hope this guys helped all of you out there."
"26378890","26380090"," Please like and subscribe."
"26380750","26381510"," It helps me out. "
