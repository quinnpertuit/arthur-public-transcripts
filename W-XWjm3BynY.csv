"W-XWjm3BynY","0","7600"," Good morning traders Captain Jim James here with a daily brief just starting to get up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","7600","8600"," this morning."
"W-XWjm3BynY","8600","11160"," I'm a little sore after this weekend before we get started this morning."
"W-XWjm3BynY","11160","18840"," I just wanted to talk to you all whether you're a bull or bear about how to be on a basic"
"W-XWjm3BynY","18840","24640"," level how to be a basic or a good trader and it mostly has to do with trends."
"W-XWjm3BynY","24640","29280"," Generally speaking our market goes up but this relates to whether our market goes up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","29280","30280"," or down okay."
"W-XWjm3BynY","30280","36880"," What I want to talk to you about is this is that you all know in the past that when"
"W-XWjm3BynY","36880","42800"," you use methods like Elliott Wave theory or you're using previous highs, previous lows"
"W-XWjm3BynY","42800","48920"," to look for areas of resistance or support whether we're moving up or down you know that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","48920","56920"," our markets can trade irrationally for extended periods of time mostly that's on the upside"
"W-XWjm3BynY","56920","60080"," but it could do the same thing on the downside as well."
"W-XWjm3BynY","60080","68040"," So oftentimes I'll see people say well I called the top or I called the bottom and it's tough"
"W-XWjm3BynY","68040","72320"," to do that because even if you do call the top or the bottom let's say you call a top"
"W-XWjm3BynY","72320","73320"," right."
"W-XWjm3BynY","73320","76880"," Let's say we look I want to show you real quick take you somewhere okay I want to show"
"W-XWjm3BynY","76880","81760"," you this high over here I'm going to delete this here and you see this high right here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","81760","84600"," 473 53 was a high."
"W-XWjm3BynY","84600","90680"," So when we were here if you said well I called that top I'm going to assume that you probably"
"W-XWjm3BynY","90680","96360"," called this top and this top I don't know this top and this top but you probably didn't"
"W-XWjm3BynY","96360","102120"," and if you look on a six month or a year chart you know it's six months that's a year I'm"
"W-XWjm3BynY","102120","106520"," going to assume that you called all of these as well which we know that you didn't and"
"W-XWjm3BynY","106520","110880"," this is where traders lose money on both sides bull and bear."
"W-XWjm3BynY","110880","116960"," So you try to play what's in front of you the entire time in case we become irrational"
"W-XWjm3BynY","116960","121040"," and there have been many moments of this as a matter of fact this move right down here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","121040","128120"," to here was an irrational move and so you have to play those moves until they stop playing"
"W-XWjm3BynY","128120","129320"," for you right."
"W-XWjm3BynY","129320","133840"," So in the way up you're looking for some sort of see follow my cursor here you're looking"
"W-XWjm3BynY","133840","139760"," for confirmation that we're heading down and the same thing was even up here at 473 you"
"W-XWjm3BynY","139760","145440"," need confirmation it's not just that first dip you need confirmation and that is where"
"W-XWjm3BynY","145440","150360"," we are in the inverse right now and in the market we've confirmed that we were heading"
"W-XWjm3BynY","150360","156760"," down and we're starting to show a reversal but we still need confirmation to take long"
"W-XWjm3BynY","156760","161520"," like long like one month two month three month longs and we're going to talk about that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","161520","166440"," in the rest of this video but it's important for you as a trader because a trader in an"
"W-XWjm3BynY","166480","173000"," investor and an investor has different criteria but an investor has different criteria for"
"W-XWjm3BynY","173000","180040"," who to invest in when to invest in those companies and those are usually more defined"
"W-XWjm3BynY","180040","186320"," you seasonality does to an extent work for investors."
"W-XWjm3BynY","186320","191440"," You have a seasonality for tech you have a seasonality for consumables you just have"
"W-XWjm3BynY","191440","195640"," a seasonality if you're going long one three four five years you even have seasonality"
"W-XWjm3BynY","195640","200760"," and just charts in a company that you can check as well you start to back test these"
"W-XWjm3BynY","200760","205680"," theories back and forth on companies right how long has a company been going up for an"
"W-XWjm3BynY","205680","211560"," entire year right does it need to cool off a little bit as a stock been down since February"
"W-XWjm3BynY","211560","216220"," of this year bleeding off for an entire year are they rated to make another move up so"
"W-XWjm3BynY","216220","222060"," investors have their own criteria you've got swing traders that have their own criteria"
"W-XWjm3BynY","222060","227300"," then you've got traders right so as a trader to me it doesn't matter if the market goes"
"W-XWjm3BynY","227300","234420"," up or goes down but at the same time if I was calling tops along this entire way and"
"W-XWjm3BynY","234420","239900"," started to go short I would lose my shirt right I would be out of a job I'd be selling"
"W-XWjm3BynY","239900","247820"," subscriptions on social media which is more than likely what happens to most people that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","247820","253020"," trade like this so what happened so my point to you though is this it doesn't matter if"
"W-XWjm3BynY","253020","257740"," we're as a trader it doesn't matter if we're heading up if we're heading down it doesn't"
"W-XWjm3BynY","257740","262860"," matter if it's extended and you can play both sides as a bull and a bear okay and if you're"
"W-XWjm3BynY","262860","266620"," not comfortable with that you can always just step back from the market until it's ready"
"W-XWjm3BynY","266620","272140"," for your style of trading so understand that as as we move forward as well so let's say"
"W-XWjm3BynY","272140","278140"," hey I'm only a bull in tech I only trade apple you can check apples charts see the weakest times"
"W-XWjm3BynY","278140","282540"," of the year and then start making and take the rest of the year off right same goes for the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","282540","288140"," spy in a one year I've talked to you many many times in the past when we come into these bottoms"
"W-XWjm3BynY","288140","294380"," you can safely until we start until we start to make something different right so if you're"
"W-XWjm3BynY","294380","300780"," looking on a year chart here you can start to see have we broken through let's all put this"
"W-XWjm3BynY","300780","308140"," up right now for as a matter of fact right so you've got this is 11 this is 11 so we're in we're in"
"W-XWjm3BynY","308140","317580"," the 12th we're in December right so you can take this support line and you can still see that our"
"W-XWjm3BynY","317660","324940"," markets in a bullish context so you know that you can buy this still or you from previous history"
"W-XWjm3BynY","324940","331260"," and continue to go long so depending on what your time frame is right so just just it's an"
"W-XWjm3BynY","331260","336780"," important note for you as a trader and as an investor as a swing trader to realize that you"
"W-XWjm3BynY","336780","341500"," have to be able to look for the signs that we're rolling over or the signs that we're turning back"
"W-XWjm3BynY","342060","348380"," up you need to know how much risk you can put on and then and if you need to be switching to bear"
"W-XWjm3BynY","348380","354860"," or bull and then you need to know when is the trigger for you to take along that's one to three"
"W-XWjm3BynY","354860","361740"," months without right or if you're a bear like right now we are turning up for all intention"
"W-XWjm3BynY","361740","368620"," we're starting to show signs of turning up so that means that you if you're a bear you put less risk"
"W-XWjm3BynY","369580","373260"," now some people out there are going to say just tell me this so that i'm not a bear and that's"
"W-XWjm3BynY","373260","379260"," just not the case because i take shorts all the time i buy puts all the time i buy calls i play"
"W-XWjm3BynY","379260","387180"," both sides in this market i'm a bull because 90 percent of the time we're going up it's the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","387180","393260"," only way that you can survive for me at least in this market i guess if you're a bear if you're"
"W-XWjm3BynY","393340","399900"," only making trades every you know only at critical times or playing small moments in the market"
"W-XWjm3BynY","399900","404860"," yeah you can get by as a bear but for me i've got you know people in my life i got to take care of"
"W-XWjm3BynY","404860","412140"," i got two dogs i got a house is you know all that shit so for me at least i'm not here to tell you"
"W-XWjm3BynY","412780","416060"," don't be a bear today because you know we're heading to the pits of hell or whatever"
"W-XWjm3BynY","417020","421100"," you know because i don't want you to take that stuff i'm just saying when the market's turning"
"W-XWjm3BynY","421100","427660"," over rolling over i'll still play that market heading up until proven otherwise right and when"
"W-XWjm3BynY","427660","433340"," it's curling back up that i'm going to play that market that in that same method and we're there"
"W-XWjm3BynY","433340","440540"," right now at we're we're possibly at a bottom right now for this pullback so that's what's"
"W-XWjm3BynY","440540","444780"," important about where we are right now so keep that in your mind as you as you move forward here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","444780","449500"," bulls you are not out of the woods in any way shape or form yet and this could just be a relief and"
"W-XWjm3BynY","449500","455580"," i'm going to go through the i'm going to go through uh i wm in the rut for that reason i'm going to"
"W-XWjm3BynY","455580","460380"," go through tech and i'm also going to talk about the rotation that's been taking place some of the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","460380","464380"," some of the some of the key things to be looking at for why we should we could be turning up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","465020","470060"," why we're not going to go to the depths of hell today we'll get into that right now okay so number"
"W-XWjm3BynY","470060","475500"," one the calendar for this week economic calendar we don't have a heck of a lot three o'clock we've"

"W-XWjm3BynY","481500","485980"," the news has been unreliable lately it might become more reliable as you start to move forward at"
"W-XWjm3BynY","485980","491580"," this point i do like to trade the news but even when news is out you have to understand why it's"
"W-XWjm3BynY","491580","497100"," being used you have to understand why it's relevant for that moment even if it really isn't relevant"
"W-XWjm3BynY","497100","501340"," if you're like well that we know that's not relevant but why is it relevant right now right"
"W-XWjm3BynY","501340","505100"," which is they're trying to give you signals that we're going somewhere for that reason"
"W-XWjm3BynY","505100","509900"," and then also remember that they get bad news out first and they bring out good news later"
"W-XWjm3BynY","509900","515340"," okay uh with news so this week we don't have a lot on the on the economic calendar we've got a lot"

"W-XWjm3BynY","541180","545980"," have heading into the rest of the week on the calendar so that's known events taking place"
"W-XWjm3BynY","545980","552700"," week someone talked about the apple emcee coming up i don't think that is anything that's going to"
"W-XWjm3BynY","552700","557420"," take place for i don't think that's anything that's going to get dumped on us right now i think you're"
"W-XWjm3BynY","557420","563340"," going to start to see from this point forward you're going to see uh big players start to wind down"
"W-XWjm3BynY","563340","568700"," their operations for the holiday season well you can disagree with this or not or you can do"
"W-XWjm3BynY","568700","573900"," whatever you want but most of the market's going to start to slow down at this point heading into the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","573900","582300"," new year most of the tough stuff is done at this point and they'll get right back at it though"
"W-XWjm3BynY","582300","587660"," the moment we get back from january first trust me it'll be you know hell on wheels guarantee well"
"W-XWjm3BynY","587660","591500"," not guaranteed but most years you know a lot of your beers up a lot of your beers out there like"
"W-XWjm3BynY","591500","597180"," say well season seasonally uh doesn't really count but i guarantee if you're a bear you'll be"
"W-XWjm3BynY","597180","602540"," talking about the seasonal downward movements for us when we come into january through march right"
"W-XWjm3BynY","602540","610140"," so seasonally tend to trust those to some extent so we'll deal with that as we head into january"
"W-XWjm3BynY","610140","616780"," february march and for all the investors out there that we talked about earlier in the end of summer"
"W-XWjm3BynY","616860","622620"," early fall we talked about you pulling your long-term investments out right and we can see right now"
"W-XWjm3BynY","622620","627900"," that that has worked out for us so hopefully you were you stayed cash gagging you only played like"
"W-XWjm3BynY","627900","635420"," we talked about playing this market day in week out month out and you should be safe i if you've"

"W-XWjm3BynY","647900","652540"," along the way okay so moving forward we don't have a lot on the dock at this week"
"W-XWjm3BynY","653100","659820"," so you're going to be looking for news right if we're if we're at a specific volatility level"
"W-XWjm3BynY","659820","664940"," right in the market or resistance level in the market you're also going to keep your ears open"
"W-XWjm3BynY","664940","670380"," for bad news or what news organizations are pushing as bad news if you don't see that bad news coming"
"W-XWjm3BynY","670380","676380"," in to your social media feeds that means everything's okay right and that's a secondary or a third"
"W-XWjm3BynY","676380","681820"," dairy causation for resistance levels to be respected right you start to those are the part of your"
"W-XWjm3BynY","681820","688140"," tools in your toolbox that you're using at different support and resistance levels and that's close"
"W-XWjm3BynY","688140","692540"," for good news too so anyways we don't have a lot going on here for the news for this week and we're"
"W-XWjm3BynY","692620","695340"," going to talk about where we are right now with the spy"
"W-XWjm3BynY","698300","701100"," you can come over to the three month here this really doesn't matter i want to want to show"
"W-XWjm3BynY","701100","707500"," you this for a reason okay i was talking in i have a i have a handle called captain's alpha"
"W-XWjm3BynY","708060","711580"," and i was talking i'm going to try to do a drawing here for you"
"W-XWjm3BynY","714460","719660"," talking about us possibly moving around in this area here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","720140","727900"," until the puts are we have put expiration day in the 17th very large i think it's six or eight"
"W-XWjm3BynY","727900","734220"," percent we have another one there after i think on the 21st i'll post i'll repost those you might see"
"W-XWjm3BynY","734220","742620"," us trade sideways until those puts expire okay then we end up making a move higher to all-time"
"W-XWjm3BynY","742620","749420"," highs again let's call 480 up here now don't use this as what's going to take place either"
"W-XWjm3BynY","749980","755580"," but this is probable or possible that we do something like this okay what you are looking"
"W-XWjm3BynY","755580","759900"," for though as it as a trader and as an investor or not an investor but a swing trader is this"
"W-XWjm3BynY","760860","767740"," you're going to be looking to buy these supports down here right 450 possibly as deep as 445"
"W-XWjm3BynY","769420","775500"," and you're going to long those until we hit this volatility zone above at 457 to 460"
"W-XWjm3BynY","776380","784140"," now if you want to be success a successful trader you buy these dips right and you sell out"
"W-XWjm3BynY","784860","795420"," up here at 457 and you wait for 460 to 464 it's between 460 and 464 you can start to take long"
"W-XWjm3BynY","795420","804620"," as long as this zone holds you can take this long to 478 possibly 480 now some of you want to put"
"W-XWjm3BynY","804620","807900"," more risk on you're like i bought the dip on friday i'm going to hold these until they"
"W-XWjm3BynY","807900","813980"," we go to 478 that's fine for you if you take on that risk myself i usually take risk to here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","813980","819740"," if we break through i'll take on more risk and i'll through stages make my way up through"
"W-XWjm3BynY","819740","827100"," to 478 or 480 and then begin to take less risk on if we roll over if we continue on and melt up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","827100","831260"," into the new year which typically we do this year typically we do in December we'll melt"
"W-XWjm3BynY","831340","836620"," up straight up to sometimes it's right before christmas like 24 and sometimes it's directly"
"W-XWjm3BynY","836620","843420"," to the 31st and we have an expiration date on the 31st this year with no puts so you've got that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","843420","850700"," right now for today the play for today is that same thing if you got in on friday at this bottom"
"W-XWjm3BynY","850700","857100"," down here if it was me i didn't i was cashing i would hold until we hit 457 in cash market now"
"W-XWjm3BynY","857180","862380"," myself i'm going to be looking for any dips that i can find this morning so i'm going to be looking"
"W-XWjm3BynY","862380","871900"," for i'm going to be looking for this cash gap right down here that's at 45374 i believe that's"
"W-XWjm3BynY","871900","877900"," where we were we closed and i'm also going to be looking for the low i've got this low way but"
"W-XWjm3BynY","877900","885340"," right back here right but so i'm going to be looking for 45374 to go long i'll be looking for 450.05"
"W-XWjm3BynY","885420","890300"," to go long right so this is where i'm looking for not being in the market if i was holding"
"W-XWjm3BynY","890300","895260"," every looking to sell somewhere up in here now there is one thing that happened in the in the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","895260","901660"," overnight that's not shown in this chart and that's when we hit 457 in the overnight we didn't sell"
"W-XWjm3BynY","901660","908380"," down to the pits of hell and that is a nod or indicator we did sell off but we didn't sell to"
"W-XWjm3BynY","908380","913820"," the pits of hell and we have done that if you look at previous charts you can see here right here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","913820","919180"," that we sell down heavy you can see right here we sold down heavy and not doing that and the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","919180","927420"," overnight is a tip of the cards to say we more than likely won't sell down to 445 today"
"W-XWjm3BynY","927420","933500"," that's probably off the table for today they're likely i would give it a 70 60 to 70 percent chance"
"W-XWjm3BynY","933500","939900"," that we don't sell down to 445 at this point it looks like liquidity is coming up and i'll check"
"W-XWjm3BynY","939980","946060"," the i'll check this thing called book map today for you and i'm on spot gamma as well i'm going"
"W-XWjm3BynY","946060","953820"," to talk to you about both of those today but our book map is what i use to track where liquidity"
"W-XWjm3BynY","953820","960300"," is now we're still in a negative gamma environment until we break above 460 to 464 this is where we"
"W-XWjm3BynY","960300","966300"," flip to positive gamma up in this area here so i'm going to be looking to buy anything down here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","966300","970940"," i doubt we even get down here today i think everybody kind of knows that we're heading up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","970940","977180"," so my expectation is or my plan is this if we green bar it right up here and don't sell off"
"W-XWjm3BynY","977180","981900"," i'm going to pick up a long right at this volatility level and head higher if we bounce down below"
"W-XWjm3BynY","981900","988540"," down here i'll pick up long's hair as well today's also a good chance for you to take some spreads"
"W-XWjm3BynY","988540","993420"," some risk on that our a month out maybe to the end of December the 31st would be good"
"W-XWjm3BynY","993500","999900"," a week after 17th would be good and there's some dates in january i think i posted them now from"
"W-XWjm3BynY","999900","1006780"," the bear case the bears still don't believe that you're out of the woods here and i tend to agree"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1006780","1013660"," with that at this point i'm going to show you why in the ndx or nasdaq and in small caps that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1013660","1017820"," were not out of the woods and it also lends some credence to why we will probably try to trade"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1017820","1024940"," sideways coming into the next few days we need to kill the vix and sideways movement does a better"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1024940","1029980"," job of killing the vix if you wanted to short the vix and we wanted a safer play you could short"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1029980","1036940"," the vix for the next few days and before we make a run up run higher you might see uh spy kind of"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1036940","1042460"," stagnate here and some other indexes have some work to do so we'll talk about that and why we may"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1042460","1046860"," not go higher today and why though it still might not be a bearish movement you could just this could"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1046860","1052540"," just be day trader stuff the next few days okay and that's how you should treat it and if you're"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1052540","1056860"," a bear and you want to go short in this market heavy if you see some resistance above here at"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1056860","1062380"," 460 or and you want to take this down or 457 that's fine i would not be taking it down any lower than"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1062380","1070940"," this 445 or 450 uh and if you start to see that we're breaking through these resistances today"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1070940","1076780"," this is a sign to is a bear to not be taking shorts because it could be a violent move up all"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1076780","1082460"," right so i hope you i hope we've covered all the bases on this one today we're gonna look at uh"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1082460","1090060"," ndx real quick nasdaq and this is what i'm trying to talk to you about okay is we're very close"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1090060","1093900"," involved usually you can swing a hundred three hundred points without any volatility in it and"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1094860","1101980"," right now the volatility triggers that 15800 this one says 15780 but it's 15800 i could move that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1101980","1107580"," up a little bit i guess right there okay so 1500 is where you're going to hit some volatility"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1108220","1112060"," if you are a bull you want to be taking longs again to this point you want to see what the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1112060","1118540"," reaction is if it isn't a steep sell down and you can start to take it long again uh to 1600"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1118540","1125660"," anything above 1600 is going to flip to positive gamma and that is going to skyrocket us up to"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1125660","1132060"," 1600 guaranteed but i think that there's a lot of repair in needed in ndx and i think it's the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1132060","1138060"," tightest trading zone that we have in the market right now so wouldn't shock me to see"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1138060","1144140"," nasdaq bounce around in here and this is where i want to make a key point if you are long in stock"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1144700","1151340"," in nasdaq there is some high risk that you'll see some stocks stay up or start to recover"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1152220","1159340"," and overvalued tech stocks continue to get whacked in the coming days you saw that happen to docu"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1159340","1165020"," sign last week i thought that i felt this or not felt i thought that to me was and you saw pay"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1165020","1169420"," pali you saw pins you starting to see some of these companies that have always gone up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1169900","1176780"," started to get whacked down and that is good for bull bears and bulls to extend ticket profits"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1177580","1184860"," is important but then it also shows bulls that the market is trying to knock down some of these"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1184860","1190860"," stocks because we're not going to have a market crash okay now i'm going to get into market"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1190860","1196380"," crash territory here in just a second because this is the scary one okay i'm going to show you"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1196380","1201980"," i-w-m here on a much larger scale and show you how messy the chart looks i mean that's an ugly"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1201980","1209100"," looking chart right there and you know bears want to come down to 205 minimum if not even deeper"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1209740","1216460"," in all honesty if we saw 163 if we had a market crash this is where it's going to take place"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1216460","1223260"," it'll take place in small caps you'll see us sell down to this 163 number and this is really"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1223260","1228300"," what the bears are talking about down here i don't like trading i-w-m and the daily i do like"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1228300","1233020"," looking at it from a weekly perspective or monthly perspective and we broke through some"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1233020","1238620"," serious key supports when you see this chart looking different i'm going to show you a different"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1238620","1244060"," chart somewhere else when you see this chart looking different it's because we did see these"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1244060","1249900"," two yellow lines right here these are supports that we just ripped right through and these are"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1249900","1254300"," some more supports that we just ripped right through and you see this volatility line above"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1254300","1259580"," here this is where this this is the this volatility line right here right this is where"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1261260","1270540"," there is huge massive put resistance to small caps going up okay so anything at that 225"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1270540","1275740"," the 226th level is high resistance when you start to look at the i-w-m and the weekly too"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1275740","1281980"," you're going to see some major resistance at this 218 level so this is where the danger zone is"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1281980","1287100"," this is where i made a note on twitter i think a week ago where i said of all the indexes"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1288140","1294540"," the biggest put wall was put on i-w-m it was scary dangerous the put wall that was put on there"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1294540","1299500"," this is where the pin is for the market this is where the pin is from us stopping to go up"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1299500","1305420"," in NASDAQ this is the pin for spy going up this leads me to believe that there's that here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1305420","1310700"," there's a couple things going on one you're going to see huge squeezes in i-w-m you're going"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1310700","1316700"," to see huge moves this is where a lot of money is going to be and then it's also where the danger"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1316700","1323100"," zone is right if we start to break below this 213 down here if you start to see the support"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1323100","1328940"," weighing over here this will kill our market guaranteed now seeing where we were down here"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1328940","1334700"," also you know the Fed knows this you know the Fed is looking at this and saying well if we"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1334780","1338380"," break through this area this zone here we're going to crash the market"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1339660","1346540"," they know this so you're going to see the Fed use their quote-unquote tools to stop this from"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1346540","1351420"," happening here so what does that mean does that mean we just trade up until we hit this massive"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1351420","1357820"," wall of volatility trade back down in here and we kind of have a stabilized market for some time"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1357820","1362860"," until we get into the first of the year so we can have our seasonally downtime we can drop the"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1362860","1368060"," market and use it as an excuse i think that's on the table especially for bears we're still in that"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1368060","1373500"," in that construct right now that would be probable it would give the holiday rally to the spy"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1373500","1379260"," you know just as much as neat as needed it doesn't allow the i-w-m to head to all-time highs again"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1379260","1383020"," which if that football wasn't there absolutely would be going there right now"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1383820","1390620"," so we need to find out where the put explorations are for the i-w-m we need to see or track to see"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1390620","1395420"," if more hedging is put in place and more more shorts and puts are put on the idea of you"
"W-XWjm3BynY","1395420","1399980"," and this is an important thing to be looking at as we move forward i'm going to show you that over"
