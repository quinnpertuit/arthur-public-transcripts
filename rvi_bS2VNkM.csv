"350970","354550"," If you don't know what those are, it's three green days in a row. "
"356070","358270"," Three big green days happening right now, right?"
"358710","362430"," So we'll take a we're going to go over here and take a peek at a couple things here."
"364550","367580"," Forty seven four."
"371760","373460"," Right up in here. "
"378150","381830"," I'm sure there's bears out there saying this is all coming back."
"387900","389100"," Hold on a second there."
"390880","395430"," We're right about there. "
"395970","397370"," Now there's some truth to that."
"401880","404920"," We'll talk about how we know that to be true."
"417890","419150"," One quick second there. "
"423390","427530"," Let me have posted out the US pending home sales reports on the feed for anybody interested."
"431520","436160"," So pending home sales fell in all four US regions compared to one year ago."
"437300","438540"," We'll talk about that too. "
"438540","439500"," We're going to talk about home sales."
"439820","442160"," Most of these numbers, none of these numbers are really shocking."
"443280","445060"," And we're going to chat about that this morning. "
"445220","447100"," We're going to chat about a few other things here."
"447320","452400"," I read a fascinating article this morning and I was I was left kind of dumb."
"452680","457840"," Not quite dumbfounded by it, but nevertheless, let me write this stuff down here. "
"457920","459360"," Make sure I don't forget some of this stuff."
"460380","461940"," A pre stream."
"465620","466780"," Economic news. "
"469120","474130"," And then three bar trade energy stocks."
"476530","478290"," Write some of this stuff down for you."
"478790","485990"," Well, and then wait a minute, the stock market stock market goes up until cuts. "
"491920","494000"," So we'll talk about that too at some point this morning."
"495120","495960"," You want a quick second."
"503780","506220"," So coming into the, these are the triggers here. "
"509320","513960"," You can see that we caught this nice bounce up right here this morning, right?"
"515000","519460"," Talked about this beautiful plane coming down right here playing, coming straight down."
"520500","524480"," Had a nice little dip this morning boom and off to the races we are."
"524700","529480"," We're heading up here now and trading these upper ranges that we talked about yesterday. "
"530320","531840"," We tagged the first one."
"531920","533400"," We have one more tag above it."
"533720","535560"," It's at 45231. "
"537260","538940"," So 45231 to the upside."
"540340","541380"," We'll look for that today."
"541640","542420"," Why does that matter?"
"542720","545560"," We're going to talk, talk to you this morning of us to why that matters. "
"546280","550180"," And I want to point your attention to two places here."
"551400","554020"," You've got this first place right here."
"556840","557240"," Right?"
"557420","560600"," That's this first one that we're taking out right now, right where we are. "
"561780","564800"," We've got one more above it right here."
"565860","569100"," I want to say that place is to try to come into them a little bit early."
"569300","572920"," Don't like to do like, I don't like to, you know, it's like right to the tip. "
"572920","575000"," It's usually that first cell right below it."
"575660","582180"," So we're going to be, we're going to be looking at this kind of kind of, I mean, I guess"
"582180","583300"," you could do it right there."
"584380","589940"," Maybe we'll make that one white and see if they can get over that one, but that's really where it"
"589940","590240"," should be. "
"590480","591040"," But we'll put it."
"591160","595540"," We'll stop another yellow bar up there about halfway right about there."
"595660","600500"," Just a quick failure and then try to be a little bit more conservative. "
"600500","604600"," And then the big boy, of course, is all of this stuff here."
"605860","607700"," This is a big move right here, right?"
"607860","609620"," I don't trust any of these sellers here."
"609840","611220"," These are all in pre-market. "
"611660","613480"," This is all garbage selling in here."
"613700","615180"," All garbage selling in here."
"616060","621040"," So the next tag should likely be much higher somewhere on this close right here. "
"621640","623280"," This is all garbage selling in here."
"623640","624700"," This is real selling right here."
"625800","627780"," That's all real selling in here. "
"627780","630680"," This should be a strong resistance area up here."
"631140","633660"," That's 4.56, 32."
"634800","636640"," So we'll look for that tag there. "
"637420","639000"," This is fake bullshit."
"639280","641680"," Actually, this is bullshit selling, but that's real selling right there."
"642900","644920"," Maybe it's a small tag right there. "
"645100","650580"," And the last one is right up there to tee off."
"650880","655740"," So right where we are right now, we've got a bunch of ball here."
"655740","658020"," Just so you can see, we've got a bunch of ball in here. "
"658760","666980"," And then we've got free riding all the way up to 4.56 above 4.52.50. So we're going"
"666980","668520"," to look at these two places right now."
"668520","688020"," We've got a 4.52.90, 4.51.70, 4.52 "
"688020","689660",".90 right up in here."
"689660","699520"," And we've got"
"699520","708060"," 4.51.72. Right up in here. "
"710580","715440"," I said 90, it's actually, I think it's actually 70, 41.70. I got that one."
"716580","725480"," And then I got 4.51.68. That one already tagged that one already."
"725480","735420"," 4.52.50. 4.52.50. Right there. "
"735560","736980"," That's my high target right there."
"739460","740900"," Price targets right here."
"743480","745620"," I'm in no trades this morning, by the way, after wondering. "
"749060","753380"," That's my price target right there, 4.52, 49, 4.2, 50."
"754380","760400"," And then anything above this number is going to be some squeeze territory."
"762240","777110"," 4.53.32. So"
"777110","779230"," all this stuff up here is all squeezy. "
"787130","790010"," This is all squeeze, squeeze stuff up in here."
"798780","802220"," Now I've got some, now this is kind of fascinating."
"802480","804360"," I have, I was on the phone with Pinky yesterday. "
"805500","810320"," And, oh, sweet, we've got a Dixie's in a free fall right now."
"812340","815820"," Dixie could go all way, way down, way down for Dixie."
"816160","818260"," NDX coming up to close some gaps to the upside. "
"819520","823320"," Vix getting smashed, Vix trading $14 right now, $14 some change."
"824000","827960"," Coming into a little bit of support right now on Vix."
"828800","831220"," Tesla's ripping right now. "
"832260","834960"," Apple's ripping and the likely rip into its event overall."
"838980","840140"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"841360","844740"," So I've got two trades on, I've got a half of a call spread on."
"845920","848920"," What's crazy is, I was on the fall of Pinky yesterday after close. "
"849220","854540"," And I was like, yeah, he was like, I closed, uh, the bot side of a spread."
"854540","856480"," And I'm like, I still have one on right now."
"857100","859440"," And I wish I had closed and I didn't close yesterday. "
"859440","860300"," It's still on."
"860540","863460"," And I have USO on right now."
"864700","867160"," And I think this is the day that I close. "
"868040","869960"," I said I had a price target of 74."
"871100","872860"," And it's, it's just been cranking."
"872860","875120"," And it's been like moving, moving, moving, moving. "
"876100","878680"," So we'll talk about that this morning."
"879600","885280"," And we're actually at a high, we hit 74 bucks earlier this morning."
"887480","890840"," I'm hoping that this day ends fully green for USO. "
"892000","893940"," I want to take this trade off."
"894160","898960"," If I can at 74 bucks, although I've got a, I've got a high target of 74."
"901100","905420"," 55 and, uh, 75, 01. "
"906540","909480"," Now I was telling myself, yeah, I'll get out before 75."
"910000","910960"," So it doesn't auto salary."
"911180","911620"," I miss it. "
"911660","915960"," It likes between four and six AM or six AM and nine 30."
"916880","921720"," Xamine options and not in, um, the underlying."
"924640","925200"," Yeah. "
"925200","927000"," Our doctor, uh, our dollars getting sold."
"927520","930840"," We'll chat about the economic stuff this morning briefly."
"932240","934180"," So we had 80 P unemployment. "
"934260","937080"," Let me reset the stuff and see if I can get some of these numbers to update."
"941540","942060"," Now."
"943100","947920"," 80 P employment, uh, employment's coming back in line right now. "
"947940","952320"," I don't know if that makes sense to you, but unemployment is coming back in line."
"952320","953400"," So."
"956160","960320"," It's back to, I think, March of 2021 levels. "
"960920","963140"," I think that's what someone from ADP said this morning."
"964000","965880"," So it's back to normalcy and."
"966560","967520"," It reinforces. "
"969560","972160"," It reinforces the idea that."
"973240","975200"," Uh, reinforces the idea that."
"975900","980020"," Uh, they're trying to bring these cycles back together, these business cycles. "
"980760","984980"," You've got the COVID cycle and then you've got the normal business cycle that we go through in our"
"984980","985320"," markets."
"988860","990140"," So are they bad numbers?"
"990700","990840"," No."
"991580","992520"," Uh, they missed expectations. "
"994000","996080"," But at the same time, it means that."
"997140","999800"," Uh, rate increases are doing their job."
"1000660","1002060"," Now there's another issue. "
"1002160","1003880"," We just got a home sale pending home sales."
"1004940","1005540"," And."
"1006420","1011520"," That leads back to those numbers lead back to our conversation we had this past week. "
"1012100","1014700"," And that conversation revolved around."
"1014900","1016380"," There's this thing for the Wall Street Journal here."
"1016500","1019060"," Work is making up to $55,000 per year. "
"1019220","1025060"," Would be eligible for overtime by default, uh, up from 35,568 currently."
"1025619","1029920"," As of the Labor Department proposes automatically raising salary thresholds for three years."
"1030160","1031540"," It's reflective current earnings data. "
"1032839","1035480"," So again, this has been cited by the Wall Street Journalers."
"1035579","1039040"," The Labor Department proposes raising overtime eligibility minimums."
"1040180","1043980"," We're all expected to affect workers in retail and hospitality industries. "
"1046579","1051900"," There's so this whole idea behind like housing, we, I think we, I think we discussed this."
"1052120","1058240"," But anyway, it's housing allows you to actually hear water, flame futures, forex and stock"
"1058240","1058480"," instruments."
"1059160","1065520"," Begin to think about all of these macro wheels or cogs in our system. "
"1066880","1069700"," Relate to each other and how they interact."
"1070220","1075940"," So, and I read another article this morning, uh, which from a website that I can't stand, but it"
"1075940","1081860"," was funny because they said, uh, these, you know, most of the time when we, when we pause rates,"
"1082660","1084100"," the market goes up substantially."
"1084780","1091260"," What the article failed to say was the end of rate hikes will be front run. "
"1091420","1096000"," Not the end of the end of the, the end of the pause will be front run to the downside."
"1097020","1101140"," So as we begin to pause, well, we should go higher."
"1102120","1108420"," Uh, once they say, or just before, let's say one to two months before, they actually start to cut"
"1108420","1108720"," rates. "
"1109540","1112940"," The market should be front ran price stand to go down."
"1112940","1114940"," Um, now."
"1116360","1120980"," This morning's numbers are kind of fascinating because for ministry here, this is a lab role and"
"1120980","1126120"," feed and I will discuss who's initiative to supply 1 million tons of grain to Turkey with financial"
"1126120","1128200"," support from Qatar at talks in Moscow. "
"1129080","1131040"," You've got a GDP revision down."
"1131120","1131860"," You've got."
"1132880","1134180"," To more normalcy. "
"1134720","1139660"," You've got, um, unemployment numbers coming back to normalcy."
"1139660","1141740"," Now the housing market."
"1142860","1145840"," Still, it's, it's, it's crunching, right?"
"1146680","1151160"," Uh, but the fascinating part about this housing market is we're still back to this thing that we"
"1151160","1153840"," talked about where anyone that bought a house. "
"1155440","1157660"," Then 2014, let's say."
"1159060","1162940"," 2014 this, that's when the housing market really started heating up, at least in my experience,"
"1162940","1163820"," like heating up."
"1164360","1167220"," Like 14, 15, 16 somewhere in there. "
"1167220","1171700"," Well, I got started getting crazy towards the pandemic."
"1173300","1177180"," But right around there, it started getting really like, like started really ramping, right?"
"1177980","1182080"," Now the average time that a person owns a home."
"1183460","1184640"," It is about eight years. "
"1186280","1189420"," Now a new home buyer, it's slightly lower."
"1190020","1196480"," But if you speak to a realtor out there, they'll tell you that when they get started, it takes"
"1196480","1199460"," about five years to start having repeat business."
"1200440","1201780"," These are usually young home. "
"1201980","1203320"," They're young first time home buyers."
"1203500","1205560"," They come back to buy their second home, not their starter home."
"1206200","1208920"," Now their second home, the average about eight years. "
"1210000","1213560"," And that kind of falls in line to where we are right now."
"1214400","1221300"," You've got a class of people out there that were buying in the mid 2000 or 2015s or teens, I"
"1221300","1222120"," guess mid teens."
"1224300","1226660"," And they are ready to sell, right?"
"1226820","1230800"," They're at that eight year mark, 10 year mark, and they're not selling. "
"1232220","1236220"," They're not going to sell unless two things happen."
"1236580","1237480"," You've got two different people."
"1237580","1239960"," You've got people that want to sell and people that want to buy. "
"1240760","1242420"," People that want to buy, they're ready."
"1242660","1243560"," They're like, I'll take the rates."
"1244180","1244980"," I know they're coming down. "
"1245160","1247540"," My realtor told me I'm drinking the Kool-Aid from the realtor."
"1248040","1248860"," All that kind of stuff."
"1248860","1251980"," Now someone that already owns a home is not in that same situation. "
"1252860","1255160"," But they're in their second home, not their starter home."
"1255700","1258640"," These people are, if they could own a second home, all kinds of stuff."
"1259060","1260400"," They have no need to sell. "
"1261140","1262920"," As of right now, they don't."
"1263220","1266640"," They're feeling the pressure to sell, but the pressure isn't on."
"1267240","1269620"," It's not like I've been in this house for eight or 10 years. "
"1269620","1272620"," And you know, just right now, it's mandatory that they sell."
"1273680","1275120"," But it's getting crispy now, right?"
"1275240","1278320"," If I've been in the house for eight years, like coming on 10, you're like, yeah, I got to start"
"1278320","1278940"," getting out of here."
"1279360","1280680"," So you're starting to get people. "
"1281640","1285620"," They're almost ready to sell regardless, but still not quite pushed there."
"1286560","1290860"," To open up stock, housing stock to buy."
"1291660","1300520"," And the Fed, not surprisingly, is in a rate hike cycle specifically for two reasons. "
"1301620","1305160"," One, we know that the Fed knows that they don't know."
"1305160","1310080"," If rate hikes actually impact inflation."
"1310260","1311200"," Hear that again for me. "
"1311780","1312960"," Listen to me clearly here."
"1313800","1321600"," We have prior Fed officials that are quoted in books that you can read."
"1322300","1326840"," Usually they're auto or biographies that where they state, we don't know. "
"1327560","1332320"," If raising rates actually impacts inflation."
"1332320","1335600"," This is the secret that nobody wants to tell you."
"1336500","1340360"," They're federalized upon normal business cycle expectations. "
"1341340","1343720"," Like this is where we think we are in a business cycle."
"1344160","1349700"," And they literally start hiking cycles based upon that thesis."
"1350940","1355260"," And that hopefully that are aligns with inflation. "
"1355780","1360760"," But there are prior Fed officials that say it might just be a normal business cycle where inflation"
"1360760","1361640"," goes up and down."
"1362000","1365080"," Of course, we need to apply tools."
"1365080","1368100"," This is back in the 70s to try to combat this. "
"1369040","1370800"," But we don't know if it actually works."
"1371440","1372220"," This is fact."
"1372760","1373340"," Okay, so. "
"1375200","1379860"," The idea here is that you're not shocked to see rate increases."
"1380400","1383640"," And these, we have a fucked up cycle right now business."
"1383820","1385700"," I mean, two, two business cycles right now. "
"1386040","1389300"," And they're trying to bring them back together."
"1389300","1390080"," Right."
"1390820","1394600"," Trying to bring these cycles back and line together. "
"1394960","1395000"," So."
"1396360","1401100"," Right now you've got the case of some guy and you've got people pre COVID and during COVID buying"
"1401100","1402040"," houses too, right?"
"1402260","1403320"," None of these people have to sell."
"1403720","1406860"," So these sellers, not the buyers, but the sellers. "
"1407980","1411980"," They're kind of getting long in the tooth and their average homeownership."
"1412800","1413360"," Right."
"1413920","1418560"," They've got rate in rates increasing, but they're not, they don't believe. "
"1419260","1421320"," That the rates are coming down."
"1421520","1424820"," So they're like, no, we're not selling until we see rates come down."
"1425700","1426340"," Okay. "
"1426860","1431260"," Or they get pushed out by their average home ownership or."
"1431920","1434960"," Rates continue to go higher and higher and higher and higher, right?"
"1435340","1436900"," And rates actually break people."
"1437860","1438500"," Unemployment. "
"1439720","1444320"," If it begins to rise unemployment, not the Goldilocks zone for."
"1445120","1446260"," A D P jobs."
"1446920","1451600"," Like you can't have like normalization of jobs and normalization of unemployment. "
"1452560","1454860"," And consider that negative to the market."
"1456020","1459240"," So, so there's only a few ways to get these people to sell, right?"
"1459440","1464480"," If I was the Fed chair, I'd be like, well, their, their homeownership averages are starting to come"
"1464480","1466760"," to maturation, right?"
"1467180","1467460"," To maturity."
"1468560","1473760"," And the only other two ways that I have to get these people out of their home, out of their"
"1473760","1473960"," home ownership. "
"1473960","1474720"," And credit crunch on them."
"1475940","1480620"," Take their jobs away from them, honestly, or cut rates, right?"
"1480840","1484740"," Now we know right now that the rate increases aren't hurting these people that own homes."
"1485820","1491280"," But we do know that if we, if they have, if they like drop the ball, we crunch their credit,"
"1491280","1495380"," they won't be eligible for loans or they take a high interest rate loan, that kind of stuff. "
"1498240","1499520"," That, that would work."
"1499760","1501800"," The other thing would work, of course, would be cutting rates."
"1502740","1506460"," And the, it actually has an opposite impact on the economy. "
"1507220","1511800"," You wind up getting a group of people that are all trying to sell at the same time."
"1512300","1518580"," You've got this pent up, pent up group of people that they're like main streeters."
"1519000","1523780"," These people will hear that rates are actually being caused or not caused by cuts. "
"1524180","1528240"," And they will begin to want to sell their homes."
"1530240","1533520"," The real estate market is very sensitive to stuff like that."
"1533640","1539500"," If you get a rolling wave of people that have owned their homes since the early or mid to mid"
"1539500","1541180"," teams of the 2000s. "
"1541420","1547080"," One spot, four, six, seven million distillist inventories forecast at minus one million prior zero"
"1547080","1548580"," spot to nine, four, five million."
"1548980","1550560"," Sorry, I'm watching the USO here in the background."
"1550820","1553380"," The prior was minus three spot one, three, three million. "
"1554700","1556780"," So you have these people, right?"
"1559500","1561660"," That they'll make a mad rush to sell."
"1562100","1563560"," And you've got a large group of sellers."
"1564820","1566980"," Let's say we all live in the same block here, right?"
"1567060","1570360"," And let's say I bought my house for $200,000 when I was this. "
"1571100","1571680"," I need to hear this."
"1575750","1578750"," Over time pay to be extended to millions of workers under Biden administration."
"1580070","1583650"," Labor Department proposes raising over time eligibility, minimum, the rule expected effective"
"1583650","1586310"," workers in retail and hospitality industries will look at that here in a minute. "
"1588230","1592630"," So the idea of being here, though, is that if I live on your block with you and we bought"
"1592630","1595130"," our houses for $200,000 and they're now worth $450,000."
"1595990","1597890"," And I know rates are being cut."
"1599930","1601690"," Then I'm going to try to sell, right?"
"1601890","1602950"," My neighbor is going to try to sell. "
"1602950","1609010"," And let's say he lists for $450, a smart realtor would know to offer under $450,000 because there's"
"1609010","1610370"," five houses for sale in my block."
"1612270","1614950"," And my neighbor is going to take $425,000."
"1615630","1616630"," I'll take $425,000. "
"1616710","1617850"," Just get me out now, right?"
"1618850","1621770"," Trying to time the topping of the housing market."
"1622350","1624790"," Now here comes me and I'm already up a couple hundred grand."
"1624790","1627270"," And, you know, my neighbor just accepted 425. "
"1627790","1630670"," The constant neighborhood going down realtor is talking to me about this."
"1630670","1632130"," And so I take 400, right?"
"1632470","1636650"," And then you start to see a really quickly a drop in housing prices."
"1637270","1640270"," Now, to get there, one of those three things need to happen, right?"
"1640410","1645170"," We need to start to have people either age out of their homes and start to have, I don't know,"
"1645170","1645570"," they need a roof. "
"1645710","1647870"," They don't want to take a 30% loan, right?"
"1648910","1649510"," They don't have the money."
"1649670","1652190"," They don't even get approved for it because of the credit crunch."
"1653710","1655330"," Or the cutting of rates. "
"1656070","1660430"," So they're not surprised by these housing numbers this morning at all."
"1661230","1663910"," Not surprised in any way, shape or form."
"1664850","1667790"," And housing prices for where I live have just gone up. "
"1667990","1669530"," They just don't stop going up."
"1669650","1670370"," They just keep going up."
"1671130","1675070"," There's no stock available either where I live still to the stay, no stock available. "
"1675750","1679550"," Matter of fact, I'm going to the auction this year because there's no stock available."
"1681330","1682850"," So get a little bit of a roll here."
"1682970","1687750"," A little bit of cell on our one down below coming down a test right now, the 129 EMA. "
"1695130","1696790"," Come on, USO, baby."
"1699990","1703230"," We're going to talk about USO's topping right now."
"1703390","1704990"," Just heads up to you if you are in that trade. "
"1706230","1709590"," Now, why did I say this morning that it should come back down?"
"1709850","1711630"," Why should it come back down on spy?"
"1711930","1713230"," I'm going to explain it to you right now."
"1713890","1715250"," We're going to go over and look at spy."
"1718310","1722770"," And it's because of, it's two reasons because of stretch, basically, though. "
"1726780","1728960"," I may delete all this stuff for now."
"1729080","1731800"," I wish I didn't, but I want, I'm going to delete all this so you can see it."
"1733420","1738240"," So I just want you to see two things that have not happened yet or two things to pay attention"
"1738240","1738640"," to. "
"1741180","1746680"," One, whenever there's a lot of stretch between hourly and price, we tend to come back."
"1746680","1747080"," Okay."
"1748340","1755460"," Number two, we still have not tested the hourly trigger cross on the daily here. "
"1756480","1758420"," This is still very bullish."
"1758640","1768600"," We have price, HD, and DT have not had this in some period of time."
"1768940","1774180"," We've had some brief ups and overs and back down, but not quite. "
"1774180","1777620"," Well, this kind of a structure as of yet."
"1779420","1787160"," So what bulls are looking for is some kind of a confirmation preferably down on their hourly"
"1787160","1787520"," trigger."
"1788060","1789820"," Above the daily trigger. "
"1790380","1791040"," That's the preference."
"1791740","1792540"," Some kind of check."
"1793540","1796180"," Now we're trading right now the half hour trigger up here. "
"1797160","1798740"," So can we continue higher today?"
"1799060","1799400"," Absolutely."
"1801080","1802140"," Absolutely can."
"1803340","1807600"," But for you as a bull, you're still not bullish. "
"1808500","1815260"," You need to have a test of that hourly above the daily trigger to continue higher."
"1815660","1822240"," The confirmation trade is like 99% of the time, 99% of the time."
"1822860","1824400"," And that number is quite low. "
"1824740","1827400"," It's 44 7 25ish."
"1828440","1832180"," The daily trigger is way down here at 44 25."
"1833100","1838160"," So it wouldn't even surprise me to break below test this and then come back up. "
"1838200","1839880"," Even that is bullish right there."
"1840680","1840940"," Right."
"1841680","1847840"," So, so any of this like interaction down here is what a bull is actually looking for. "
"1848060","1848920"," I don't care if it's today."
"1849460","1854540"," I don't care if it's tomorrow or not tomorrow or tomorrow or Friday or Tuesday."
"1854820","1855580"," I really don't care. "
"1855580","1861800"," But a bull should be looking for that test that initial break higher and then."
"1862020","1862700"," Hey, we're going up."
"1862900","1863840"," We're going higher here. "
"1863960","1866700"," And this is that confirmation trade."
"1867460","1868620"," Why is that so important?"
"1870460","1872260"," We're going to talk about that right now."
"1872400","1873440"," We're going to go to the full chart. "
"1873440","1874960"," We will full chart screen."
"1875760","1878480"," We're going to go just just an example here."
"1878620","1878800"," Okay. "
"1878980","1880560"," So there's your hourly trigger down here."
"1884930","1887410"," We talked about this briefly yesterday, right?"
"1888790","1892070"," That's a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous move right there."
"1892490","1893030"," Nice extension. "
"1893870","1896030"," Any kind of like, Hey, we're going higher."
"1896190","1898830"," We checked to go higher is extremely bullish, right?"
"1899270","1900830"," We don't want that fake out."
"1901350","1905690"," Break below the hourly in the daily and continuation to the downside. "
"1906050","1907770"," We know if this fails right here."
"1908690","1913670"," We know if that fails right there, that it's just a correction."
"1914770","1916630"," Or a bear correction. "
"1916910","1918650"," I hate saying this stuff is so corny."
"1920530","1925370"," The mean revision trade for continuation of the downside on correction."
"1925670","1927990"," As a matter of fact, I checked last night. "
"1928170","1931170"," The exact how far down we've got."
"1931250","1937270"," I think it was 5.74% was the full tip to tail."
"1938810","1940530"," And this trade higher. "
"1940530","1943590"," We're now down, I think."
"1944570","1949090"," Under 2% from the 2023 all time highs."
"1949330","1950150"," This I right here. "
"1950670","1954390"," This morning, I think puts us under 2% away from."
"1955430","1956290"," Heading higher."
"1956730","1956890"," Now. "
"1957290","1961610"," The next thing you should think about here too is if this does hold."
"1962910","1966650"," To expect a little bit less aggressiveness as we get up there."
"1968630","1971330"," A little bit less volatility, believe it or not. "
"1971530","1974230"," Not the huge violence that you might be looking for."
"1974850","1978010"," A little bit of blood right now."
"1978090","1981210"," Nice squeeze coming down played play coming down to this half hour trigger. "
"1981410","1983730"," This is where it held all day yesterday."
"1984990","1988150"," We've got the hourly trigger down here at 447 30."
"1989270","1992170"," The entire move from just before the open erased. "
"1993710","1997910"," We also have the pre market low down here at 448 30."
"1998690","2002070"," Attaching a quick bounce right now on the half hour trigger."
"2002210","2003510"," I don't think we're done going down. "
"2004210","2005770"," But we'll keep watching it here."
"2011020","2012740"," Need one quick second air."
"2015040","2016540"," That's why I like to start late. "
"2016820","2018260"," Give you guys some cool enough time."
"2019000","2019720"," Hold on one second air."
"2023370","2024790"," I shouldn't close that. "
"2025050","2025390"," What I did."
"2030880","2033500"," We're going to watch this half hour bounce right here."
"2033600","2036300"," You watch down below the screener down below me. "
"2038240","2040140"," There's your half hour bounce right here."
"2040140","2042320"," Had a nice little half hour bounce back here as well."
"2043260","2045400"," We'll see if this half hour is owned. "
"2045460","2046520"," If we're owning this or not."
"2047100","2048440"," We bounced on this half hour."
"2048560","2049659"," Watch this half hour down here. "
"2050400","2053159"," Bounce bounce bounce and right back to the start."
"2054820","2056840"," All that half hour or one more time."
"2057000","2058340"," So we're going to see if this bounce holds. "
"2058340","2061159"," Got a nice big fat green candle off that."
"2061380","2062760"," Almost a pin strike down there."
"2062840","2063219"," You see that. "
"2064020","2066719"," If you are a bull looking to buy a dip here."
"2067860","2069659"," You know what to look for right."
"2070040","2073760"," You know exactly what to look for to buy a dip in confidence. "
"2075040","2077639"," Pay attention closely to this part of the program."
"2078280","2079760"," Very closely here."
"2080020","2080860"," It's a one minute chart. "
"2083340","2085719"," You're looking for something like that right."
"2088900","2092699"," You're looking for price to come over here and start to head higher again right."
"2092920","2093340"," Something like that. "
"2093860","2095940"," But what is going on right now in the one minute."
"2096540","2099120"," I want you to tell me what you think is going on here."
"2100320","2100720"," In the chat. "
"2100920","2103060"," I want you to tell me what do you see here."
"2103660","2104800"," Does this look like a reversal."
"2105320","2106380"," It doesn't does it. "
"2106980","2109060"," This does not make a reversal to me."
"2109920","2112860"," To me this looks like more downside to come."
"2113900","2115640"," So when I'm looking at this right here. "
"2116220","2117600"," I don't like to see this."
"2119300","2122880"," Because this is looking for a rejection candle right here."
"2123740","2124220"," Okay. "
"2125140","2125980"," Or more downside."
"2126560","2128220"," So let me draw this again for you."
"2129580","2130900"," So you can see it better. "
"2134320","2135340"," Hold on here."
"2138000","2139880"," So do you have a trade here as a bull."
"2140380","2140500"," No. "
"2141360","2142060"," The answer is no."
"2142760","2146460"," You'll find people in stream say yeah I bought that and let's say it worked out."
"2146720","2147300"," We were going up. "
"2147300","2149640"," But I guarantee you they disappear."
"2150440","2151200"," They disappear."
"2151660","2152700"," Most of the time they're wrong. "
"2152940","2154560"," They're wrong like 70% of the time."
"2155360","2158300"," 70% 80% of the time they're actually wrong."
"2159340","2161360"," So you've got no trade here as a bull. "
"2165680","2168720"," Even if we squeeze higher here and reject."
"2169320","2171320"," Now they should reject this candle right now."
"2171940","2174600"," But even if they squeeze higher here it's only another opportunity. "
"2175000","2179020"," You'd be buying more puts right here and adding to a put position right here."
"2179020","2181900"," And we should see continuation."
"2182980","2184860"," To the downside here. "
"2186100","2187820"," And because of that."
"2188540","2190160"," Because of that bear."
"2190900","2193180"," Bear plane that's forming right here. "
"2193640","2195420"," So if you're a bull right now."
"2195880","2196960"," What are you looking for?"
"2197100","2198360"," I already showed it to you earlier right."
"2198860","2200140"," You're looking for that reversal. "
"2200700","2203120"," You're looking for this to turn back around."
"2204020","2204520"," Right."
"2204780","2205900"," And you're looking for price. "
"2209240","2210700"," To squeeze higher here."
"2210860","2211260"," Break above."
"2212240","2212720"," Right. "
"2213200","2213540"," Turn red."
"2214280","2214460"," Right."
"2214740","2216160"," And there's your bear trap right there. "
"2216480","2216700"," Bear trap."
"2216960","2217800"," And we start heading higher."
"2218820","2221880"," You actually can't make entry until right about there. "
"2222520","2223120"," Right there."
"2223280","2223960"," You can make entry."
"2225060","2226220"," So if you're a bull right now. "
"2226300","2229860"," You can't even jump in on this until this structure reforms itself."
"2230600","2231960"," Does that make sense to you if you're a bull."
"2232920","2234140"," You got no dip by here. "
"2234200","2234340"," None."
"2240240","2241100"," You got it."
"2241100","2241600"," Yeah. "
"2242660","2244260"," So there's no trade for you today."
"2244440","2244940"," No, no trade."
"2245100","2245680"," You're a bull bull. "
"2245820","2246060"," No trader."
"2246340","2248760"," You need to see no rejection above here."
"2248960","2251480"," I guess you can do a one minute trader or five minute trade. "
"2253560","2256180"," You can take like you can take this trade."
"2257660","2261320"," You can take possibly like one or two bars right here, but it's too risky."
"2262240","2264000"," I don't do these oftentimes on. "
"2265660","2267060"," Where for where we are."
"2267060","2270420"," If we were like, if we had like gone up here."
"2272360","2275780"," And had come straight down here. "
"2276640","2278420"," And we set this up one more time."
"2278560","2282900"," I'd probably then take those those five minute trades, but just where we are right now."
"2283380","2284500"," No point in taking it. "
"2288080","2289480"," When can you enter as a bear?"
"2289740","2291080"," So this set up right here."
"2292100","2292980"," Good question."
"2293640","2296120"," So if you're a bear and you miss this trade right here. "
"2297300","2297740"," Right."
"2298000","2299240"," You're like, I missed that trade cap."
"2299380","2300720"," You should have actually caught it right there. "
"2302280","2303180"," And you get out."
"2303400","2304500"," That's a trade right there."
"2304720","2308260"," And then there's the second part of the trade right there that green candle that was rejected. "
"2309100","2310580"," Went right back down right there."
"2310840","2315660"," So what you're going to be looking for right here on this major support or minor support, but we"
"2315660","2316440"," know where it is."
"2316900","2319860"," So right in here, you're going to attempt to take a trade. "
"2320780","2321820"," Right in there."
"2322960","2326500"," So you'll try to buy puts right here for reversal to the downside."
"2328560","2329000"," Continuation. "
"2329580","2331040"," You actually take it right here right now."
"2331040","2331800"," You can take it actually."
"2332360","2333860"," Star event straight in this shit. "
"2334040","2334720"," Now let's say."
"2335320","2336320"," Let's say you're wrong."
"2336560","2337300"," Let's say you're like, okay. "
"2337520","2338440"," I'm buying puts there."
"2339300","2340240"," Let's say you're wrong."
"2340400","2342080"," Let's say it squeezes up right. "
"2343060","2343440"," Oh shit."
"2344360","2347720"," My puts I bought for 20 cents are now worth 10 cents."
"2348760","2349780"," Do you panic there?"
"2350280","2350860"," Fuck no. "
"2351940","2352740"," Fuck no."
"2355880","2358260"," See this point where they sold right here."
"2359580","2361080"," They sold that green candle. "
"2362120","2364940"," You're likely going to still see a rejection above."
"2366140","2367720"," In a reversal down."
"2368580","2370080"," Even if it's going to go higher. "
"2372500","2373600"," You're going to be given a chance."
"2375000","2376580"," To get out of that trade."
"2376680","2378460"," So if you're taking a put right here. "
"2378460","2380640"," And you get squeezed up."
"2381360","2383560"," You're going to hold until it comes back down."
"2383860","2385400"," Then you unfuck yourself. "
"2385920","2388480"," And reposition to the upside."
"2388480","2389640"," Does that make sense to you?"
"2389800","2391040"," So if you're if you're a seller."
"2392080","2393640"," Matter of fact yesterday in stream. "
"2394760","2397560"," You watched me take a trades exactly with you, right?"
"2398020","2400340"," And did you see how they tried to flush me out of that trade."
"2400920","2402820"," I went back and looked at the half an hour candle."
"2403100","2403480"," It was green. "
"2403940","2405100"," I said, I'm going to stay in here."
"2405100","2409880"," But I was still in that process given the opportunity to get out of the trade."
"2411120","2413380"," Yesterday in stream, when I said, look, I bought for 26. "
"2414160","2415380"," I'm down to 20 right now."
"2416100","2417320"," I'm back up to 25."
"2417660","2418160"," Back to 26. "
"2419040","2419780"," Down to 20."
"2420880","2421320"," 32."
"2422360","2422620"," 34, right?"
"2422840","2423580"," 37, 39. "
"2424120","2424960"," All that kind of stuff, right?"
"2426760","2433140"," But you're given a chance to not just exit a trade, but like I'm entering at the right place in"
"2433140","2433520"," time."
"2433520","2439420"," And how often am I given the chance to get out of my trade?"
"2440180","2441480"," So the idea here is that."
"2442320","2446700"," If I'm timing my trade, think of think about this from like a layered. "
"2447660","2449200"," Like a layered tool."
"2449780","2451400"," Or like a layered plan."
"2452060","2453940"," Did I enter the trade at the right time?"
"2454760","2455980"," The right place. "
"2457020","2459180"," If the trade goes against me."
"2460260","2464660"," What is the percentage of time that I can exit that trade if I'm wrong?"
"2465800","2466820"," Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"2468040","2472920"," So if I enter a trade, because I have conviction, it's going up, let's say, or down."
"2473140","2473560"," It doesn't matter. "
"2473720","2474660"," It's going up or going down."
"2475360","2482860"," I already know that if I enter the wrong place, the wrong time, and it goes against me, I won't"
"2482860","2484560"," be given the chance to exit."
"2485780","2487800"," If I enter the right place in time. "
"2488460","2496320"," If the trade goes against me, I'm given an opportunity to usually exit about 70% of the time."
"2496880","2497420"," That trade."
"2498100","2499240"," Not every time. "
"2499740","2504440"," Let's say it runs like they take that 20 cent put and it goes to 10 cents every once in"
"2504440","2504760"," a while."
"2505400","2506880"," Three to three out of 10 times."
"2507220","2508380"," I might get run over. "
"2509080","2511960"," But the other 70% of times that I lost."
"2513220","2514240"," I'm going to be able to get out."
"2514980","2515900"," Does that make sense?"
"2516320","2518760"," So if I have a conviction trade that we're going down. "
"2520340","2523020"," If I have a conviction trade that we're going down, right?"
"2524040","2525540"," You guys want to see it happen right here?"
"2525640","2526540"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"2526540","2527020"," You want to see it?"
"2527320","2528280"," I'm going to see it go down."
"2530860","2534980"," If I have a conviction trade already that it's going down, I should already have a high probability"
"2534980","2536300"," that it's going down, right?"
"2536840","2537920"," So I'm already up. "
"2539060","2540760"," I'm going to win this 70% of the time."
"2541200","2542420"," When it goes against me."
"2542420","2546240"," I now have a 70% of the time chance to exit. "
"2547220","2550660"," So even my losses should be low overall."
"2551240","2557120"," If I'm right 70% of the time and when I am wrong, I still have a 70% chance"
"2557120","2559740"," of exiting without getting torched."
"2560540","2564200"," My end result is a high probability of winning. "
"2564660","2570080"," A high probability of not blowing up my account when I am wrong and the ability to adjust to make"
"2570080","2571220"," money elsewhere, right?"
"2571560","2576020"," So I start to become a profitable trader even when I'm wrong."
"2577140","2581000"," So let's look right now and see what's playing out right here as we are."
"2581300","2582960"," We have the rejection above here. "
"2583220","2585620"," Sellers stepped in, right?"
"2585820","2586960"," So so far they're right."
"2588980","2592760"," So far seller right at this point is fine right now, right?"
"2592940","2594100"," They're doing well, right?"
"2594500","2597000"," Seller is winning this trade right now."
"2597000","2599980"," Where does a seller exit this trade?"
"2600840","2601980"," We already know, right?"
"2602400","2608480"," Only if there's this squeeze higher, but you don't exit here, do you?"
"2608940","2612400"," You're going to wait for if you get some kind of crazy reversal, right?"
"2612880","2618800"," You're going to wait for this failure right in here and come back down and that would give you the"
"2618800","2621580"," chance to exit right here. "
"2621680","2624000"," So right now seller is in control, right?"
"2624000","2627220"," Whoever sold this bar is right now in control."
"2627800","2630000"," They have no, they're not sweating anything right now."
"2634820","2637020"," Let's check the five minute chart real quick. "
"2638840","2640640"," Looking for a closing bar."
"2640940","2642500"," So if you're a seller here, we'll look at this."
"2642580","2644000"," Watch this bar right here. "
"2644920","2652040"," We know that if you're a bull or a buyer, you don't want closing bars below the five minute, right?"
"2652940","2657940"," You don't want a closing bar below the five minute."
"2658340","2659980"," So that's what's happening right now, right?"
"2660480","2664660"," Sellers are trying to close a bar below the twenty seven EMA."
"2665000","2665980"," Will they be successful?"
"2666740","2667200"," I don't know. "
"2668800","2670040"," We're going to find out."
"2670140","2672100"," There's that green reversal candle right here."
"2672520","2676180"," So a seller that's selling right here, they're sweating right now, right?"
"2677460","2678580"," So watch this with me. "
"2679380","2681420"," So there's a seller right here."
"2688940","2692100"," And this seller is watching this green bar right now."
"2693060","2698060"," And you tell me where you, if you were this person, you tagged this perfectly right here. "
"2698680","2700600"," I'm going to tell you where I think you'd sell."
"2700940","2704060"," You'd probably sell right about there."
"2708370","2711990"," This is where you'd likely sell right here. "
"2714650","2717470"," And in fact, you should not sell right there."
"2717510","2722210"," You should be waiting for a reversal down so you can get out of your trade."
"2722490","2725670"," So we're going to watch these candles as they, as they play themselves out. "
"2728770","2735090"," We're going to see if a seller has an exit or not."
"2738270","2739410"," Hopefully it goes up."
"2739570","2743730"," I'm hoping that it goes up so you can see this thesis play it out. "
"2749060","2751160"," No sweat right now from a seller, right?"
"2751400","2752900"," Sellers like, yeah, we're good so far."
"2754360","2756740"," Got no, no, no, not sweating anything."
"2757020","2758080"," We haven't gone up yet. "
"2759280","2761180"," No sweating yet for a seller."
"2763980","2765960"," Seller still in control right now."
"2780840","2783160"," Got a nice little cross right there. "
"2783660","2786120"," See that white line crossing that red line right there?"
"2786220","2787620"," You can see it right just peeking out."
"2791040","2793760"," See that little cross right there inside inside of that box?"
"2794280","2794880"," It's right there."
"2808040","2809000"," Come on, baby. "
"2809200","2809760"," Give me that blood."
"2814240","2817660"," I'm like, I want it to go up so they can, I can show the pieces that I'm like, yeah,"
"2817820","2818800"," go down, down, down, down."
"2822580","2823600"," I'm a masochist. "
"2835150","2837630"," See right there, seller's in charge right now."
"2837890","2838770"," No sweating right now."
"2838950","2840190"," No sweating by the seller. "
"2840850","2843810"," We'll actually draw this box in instead of doing the thing."
"2843830","2845790"," It's right here."
"2851000","2853480"," This is where a seller panics right there. "
"2858580","2860060"," Draw that in so you have it."
"2870570","2871870"," That's where the seller is."
"2872070","2873090"," That's where the seller panics. "
"2890960","2892640"," I don't think anybody bought the top."
"2892860","2895960"," I don't think anybody and I don't think any bulls in our program bought the top."
"2896240","2897720"," I don't think a single bull here. "
"2898080","2901580"," I don't think a single person inside of our stream has done that."
"2902040","2902420"," Maybe."
"2903540","2905980"," I don't think I don't think any buyers here. "
"2906360","2910680"," I don't think any buyers here are buying tops."
"2910960","2912540"," We're buying bottoms the whole way up."
"2912660","2914380"," So I don't think any buyer here is. "
"2917340","2919400"," I don't think so, maybe I could be wrong in that."
"2921340","2929380"," It could be wrong, maybe the stream was buying 450, but I don't know any bulls that are buying 450."
"2936080","2946000"," Let's send that over and watch this"
"2946000","2946440"," play out. "
"2960120","2961460"," Thanks, I appreciate it."
"2967030","2968490"," It is bear town sheriff."
"2968710","2969830"," It's about to squeeze right now. "
"2972770","2974310"," You're correct bear town sheriff."
"2975630","2982570"," So bear town sheriff is making a comment that I think this is what bear town sheriff is saying is"
"2982570","2986110"," bear town sheriff wanted to see rejection right here."
"2988710","2993270"," Bear town sheriff saying we should have immediately rejected and I agree with him on that. "
"2997370","3001450"," I am in agreement with bear town sheriff on that seeing this not happen here."
"3002290","3005610"," Not good for bears bears are sweating right now they're already sweating."
"3006330","3009730"," So we'll just watch the solid panic step to kick in in just a second. "

"3077110","3079790"," I think a put buyer here is fine right now."
"3081190","3084830"," I think any whoever the seller is is still good in my view. "
"3087710","3089710"," Even though it looks quite bullish here."
"3090930","3096890"," I want to be able to show the idea behind exiting without losing your ass."
"3106080","3106880"," There we go. "
"3107040","3107580"," Get on up there."

"3191180","3191600"," Fuck you."
"3197820","3200780"," Now let me know in the chat would you sell this or not. "
"3201580","3204640"," Would you be exiting your short here or would you be staying in."
"3204900","3206360"," I'd still be in to be honest with you."
"3206360","3209240"," So I would still be here. "
"3209340","3211020"," This guy right here is like he's pissed."
"3213440","3215100"," Let me write off pissed off seller."
"3223050","3223810"," Pissed off seller. "
"3224250","3225190"," There he is right there."

"3228930","3229330"," I wouldn't. "
"3229410","3230270"," I'd still be short here."
"3232830","3233510"," I'd want to."
"3234070","3235170"," I'm pretty aggressive. "
"3235370","3236790"," So I'd be wanting to see that first."
"3242080","3243520"," But you're given a chance right."
"3243700","3245480"," Just like yesterday I was given a chance in here. "
"3246940","3251060"," When I was trying to take a long they gave me ample opportunity to get out of my trade."
"3251660","3255220"," So as a seller you at least have your original seller right here."
"3255340","3256880"," You're now the same seller right here. "
"3257120","3261160"," You're given a chance to get out if you feel like you're in the wrong place right."
"3261880","3262900"," Still given a chance."
"3263780","3266120"," Think about that as a buyer or seller. "
"3266980","3268020"," You're positioning."
"3269400","3275240"," Where are you positioned and then if you get run over where do you exit."
"3283840","3285180"," This guy's still here. "
"3285400","3286440"," He's like God damn it."
"3288620","3291020"," He's like they're coming back up to fuck with me again."
"3297850","3299830"," I hope we get a squeeze. "
"3300090","3300970"," I want to see one squeeze."
"3304070","3305610"," These this is all still here."
"3305730","3306810"," None of this has changed here. "
"3307870","3309410"," Actually make it we can actually make it larger."
"3315850","3318350"," Look at me is like we're sending this shit to the depths of hell."
"3318830","3322270"," Somebody play the song depths of hell right now because they're going to try to send it down there. "
"3324110","3326910"," Let's put it right there because that's where he is pissed off seller."
"3331370","3333110"," Where is the seller's price target."
"3333230","3333890"," Do you want to know that. "
"3339100","3339900"," It is."
"3342660","3344420"," The seller price target is."
"3347980","3349040"," Right down there. "
"3354040","3355540"," We'll give him the benefit of the doubt."
"3365190","3366850"," Don't make it yellow so you can see it."
"3371210","3372430"," Put it back right over there. "
"3390000","3391340"," Now he's really upset."
"3391660","3393440"," He's like just send it."
"3394120","3395240"," Just send it. "
"3406300","3411720"," Yeah, it's kind of it's bullish."
"3412080","3413400"," It's more bullish than bear share."
"3413580","3414340"," It's not bearish. "
"3415540","3416580"," It's bearish."
"3416780","3418480"," We're below right now the white line."
"3418480","3421920"," So it's still bearish, but it's kind of how to explain. "
"3422060","3422480"," It's kind of weird."
"3424120","3427960"," It's still bearish, but it's not it's not good structure for bears."
"3428720","3430160"," It's not the structure you want to see. "
"3434120","3436620"," This guy's now like second question in himself."
"3437840","3438840"," He's like damage."
"3438840","3441120"," I just sell before it goes up here. "
"3441820","3445160"," He's like I just get out of my short right now don't lose any money."
"3446020","3447980"," Got run over the past few days."
"3456910","3459090"," Oh, no, they're going to squeeze me out right now. "
"3459310","3459750"," Oh, my God."
"3459850","3460310"," I'm panicking."
"3461130","3462230"," Oh, super panic. "
"3463270","3463630"," Panic."
"3463790","3464130"," Oh, my God."
"3464130","3464610"," What do I do?"
"3464730","3465630"," What do I do?"
"3465710","3466670"," Hold, hold, hold. "
"3467070","3468290"," Those are the brain works, right?"
"3475880","3476920"," Oh, what do I do?"
"3477100","3477540"," What do I do?"
"3477800","3479160"," Oh, please don't don't squeeze."
"3479420","3480120"," Don't do it."
"3480400","3480940"," Don't squeeze. "
"3482780","3484300"," I bet this is how happy you think."
"3484680","3485240"," That's how I think."
"3485240","3489020"," Or at least the dumb ones out there. "
"3489300","3490740"," If you like me, if you're dumb like me."
"3498390","3500050"," Here comes the seller panic."
"3513570","3515290"," Give me that squeeze, baby. "
"3516510","3518610"," Squeeze those sellers out right now."
"3519750","3520790"," Make them panic."
"3521670","3522410"," There you go. "
"3522610","3523430"," Start squeezing them out."
"3525410","3526930"," Close your short."
"3528950","3530370"," Close your short. "
"3537210","3543410"," It's like die spy, die, die, die, die."
"3546790","3548310"," Get some guy in a basement."
"3548550","3550630"," He's like, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. "
"3552050","3555150"," Some guy in a plaza."
"3556790","3557650"," He's not even on Wall Street."
"3557730","3559010"," He's in some plaza in Illinois. "
"3562110","3566190"," It's like 30 desks in a small shitty office from the 1980s or something."
"3567430","3569770"," Still has cigarette smoke in the sailing tiles."
"3576250","3580330"," You should have seen the, if you, I don't know if you guys have any experience as a professional"
"3580330","3580870"," trader. "
"3581370","3584470"," You should have seen the trading fucking boiler rooms in the 90s, dude."
"3584830","3585050"," Gross."
"3587390","3589270"," Early 2000s, like big gray offices. "
"3589910","3593990"," You get like a desk with like a wall that's like three feet away from you on each side."
"3594870","3597690"," It's just like a bunch of dudes sitting in an office space."
"3598190","3599530"," It looks like a call center. "
"3605970","3608190"," It goes the seller panic up here."
"3608190","3609610"," Now the seller is panicking."
"3610430","3614290"," And this is usually the most compromised time for a seller. "
"3614290","3619630"," So right in here is where a seller is, if they didn't sell, let's say the seller didn't sell."
"3620410","3624710"," This is the moment where a seller panics, right?"
"3624850","3631530"," This is where the pain comes in for a seller and the seller will likely sell and lose money here,"
"3632030","3638330"," but has a high probability on this squeeze that it still reverts down."
"3638930","3641130"," So I want you to pay attention to this if you're a seller. "
"3641710","3643450"," Let's say you're getting the squeeze put on you."
"3643450","3649510"," You'll likely still have a chance to exit without major losses."
"3650350","3651730"," And so that's a key point here. "
"3652570","3657950"," If you're this pissed off seller here, are you getting taken for the ride right now?"
"3658450","3661490"," Or are you going to be given an opportunity to exit?"
"3662390","3665470"," So far we have this one little candle right here."
"3665910","3667310"," Here's your first chance exit."
"3668210","3668730"," Right?"
"3669290","3670250"," Right in there. "
"3670250","3671910"," So you have this big green candle."
"3672070","3677010"," You're getting taken losing points on on on grow pecs or whatever, grow pecs."
"3678550","3680650"," You're giving a chance right there to get out. "
"3681810","3684230"," Right now you didn't get out on this candle."
"3684730","3687270"," And now you've got this part that steps in."
"3687370","3689370"," This is where you're like, oh shit. "
"3689990","3695490"," I'm going to get a margin call on my account because I've only got, I don't know, five grand in"
"3695490","3697270"," the bank or something on the bank from the brokerage."
"3697270","3700170"," And I'm about to get taken for a ride here."
"3700610","3701970"," I'm going to panic sell now. "
"3702110","3707530"," I'm going to go down and sell only having $4,000 in my account because I'm freaking out here."
"3707670","3707790"," Right?"
"3708410","3714310"," How do you deal with this and manage this as a, as a seller here?"
"3714630","3714850"," Right?"
"3715030","3716210"," Watch this panic set in here."
"3716730","3717810"," It's going to freak them out. "
"3719950","3721270"," Big freak out here."
"3721370","3722410"," Watch this take place here."
"3746230","3748990"," Here was your first opportunity to get out right here. "
"3773300","3774380"," Big freak out."
"3804280","3805520"," There's one, there's two."
"3837550","3840930"," Oh, that seller is sweating now, isn't he?"
"3843050","3845030"," Here comes that squeeze, baby. "
"3869720","3880550"," Oh, oh, oh, oh,"
"3880550","3880950"," oh, oh."
"3898590","3899550"," They're scared now."
"3904860","3909800"," Some guy in a, some guy in a sweatshirt, a boiler room right now is like, oh, shit. "
"3911000","3912500"," Somebody call Bob downstairs."
"3920050","3921370"," We asked you the next question."
"3921590","3923410"," Would you get out on this candle right here?"
"3925070","3925990"," Let me on the chat. "
"3926150","3927650"," Would you get out in that candle right there?"
"3937820","3939640"," We didn't get out on this candle."
"3944830","3946430"," Would you have taken that candle?"
"3946990","3947630"," Not me."
"3947790","3949210"," I would have taken this candle right here. "
"3950630","3952610"," I'm looking for that candle to get out right there."
"3954830","3957790"," That's like caps exit, begging, hoping, pleading, candle."
"3981260","3982660"," Now they're about to get wrecked here. "
"4011250","4013290"," Remember where they are, they're right here."
"4030810","4032990"," So this seller is right here, right?"
"4033850","4035350"," What is he going to do right here?"
"4035450","4035710"," Do you know?"
"4037090","4037670"," He's going to get out."
"4038950","4040450"," He's going to get out right here. "
"4041370","4044710"," This pissed off seller is going to exit his position right here."
"4045950","4047570"," So let's take a look here."
"4047570","4050390"," This is where the seller got in right here, right?"
"4050650","4052130"," Look at this pay attention to this. "
"4052490","4054130"," This is where the seller got in."
"4056170","4061210"," This is where most retail traders get stopped out right here."
"4064310","4064870"," Right?"
"4065570","4066950"," This is a professional trader. "
"4069110","4070870"," This is a retail trader."
"4074130","4075970"," Retail trader gets squeezed out."
"4076250","4077610"," What does the professional do?"
"4078190","4079010"," Most of the time. "
"4079150","4079530"," What does he do?"
"4081390","4086230"," He has a chance to exit here or stay in his position, right?"
"4089230","4092910"," He's giving it up being given another opportunity here to get out."
"4095410","4098990"," With minimal, minimal losses."
"4100029","4101250"," You see that?"
"4101430","4103270"," You see how that works itself out right here?"
"4104830","4107149"," Now this guy can stay in if he wants to. "
"4108170","4109029"," That's number one."
"4110470","4112430"," What's his second option here?"
"4115170","4117729"," If this holds, what's his second option, right?"
"4118770","4120490"," So he can stay short right now."
"4120729","4123810"," Professional would buy the market if we were, if we start heading out here. "
"4124410","4125229"," We started going up."
"4125970","4131529"," He'd buy the market, but for you as a retailer, here's the pissed off seller."
"4135620","4140180"," Here is the retail seller that panics and sells up here, right?"
"4141520","4145520"," The seller is easily given another opportunity to get out, right?"
"4146740","4148600"," Easily given another opportunity to get out. "
"4149100","4151439"," If you didn't get this red bar right here."
"4153240","4154979"," Can I do a black color in here, maybe?"
"4156240","4156979"," In here."
"4158200","4162380"," If you didn't get this black candle right here, or this red candle, sorry. "
"4163100","4165260"," You didn't get that candle right there."
"4166420","4170859"," You are still given an opportunity to exit, weren't you?"
"4171700","4172680"," Right in here."
"4172740","4173279"," Do you see that?"
"4173840","4179680"," Still given an opportunity to exit. "
"4179680","4187279"," So just like yesterday's lesson about panic, don't be panicking here."
"4187439","4188500"," Does that make sense for your seller?"
"4189160","4190760"," This is what a retailer does."
"4190880","4191359"," He panics. "
"4193340","4196360"," That seller panic is a retailer, not professionals."
"4197400","4197980"," Does that make sense?"
"4203240","4204780"," If you don't want to get out of your trade, right there."
"4204960","4205640"," Ample, plenty. "
"4209180","4214940"," Let's say you get out of your trade right down here."
"4215060","4217360"," You're like, hey, I have a chance to get out of my short right there."
"4217520","4218260"," I'm taking it. "
"4218680","4219700"," I'm out now, right?"
"4220760","4222320"," And you're like, okay, I want to take another short."
"4222420","4224720"," I want to take another stab at it because I'm angry."
"4224720","4229880"," I want to take another stab at it and start again right here, can't you?"
"4230720","4235080"," If you see another red candle here, not the green candle, but the red candle. "
"4235580","4240280"," If you see a red candle here, you can jump on that trade, can't you?"
"4240860","4245940"," So if you're a seller now and you're like, well, I'm still pissed off here, Cap."
"4246680","4248580"," You're not buying a short here, are you?"
"4249140","4252520"," You're still waiting now for another candle to reject."
"4252520","4260400"," So you're looking for a rejection here and a red candle to follow to reenter a short one more time"
"4260400","4262240"," to take this to the downside. "
"4263100","4263720"," Does that make sense?"
"4264920","4268880"," So you're managing the entire trade from start to finish."
"4269380","4271680"," You're entering at the right places to sell."
"4271980","4273480"," You entered at the right place here, didn't you?"
"4274220","4281040"," Even if you didn't make any money, you're still managing the trade. "
"4281040","4289320"," I love that this happened too because it gives you the opportunity to see how to manage a trade"
"4289320","4297760"," that goes against you and the opportunities it gives affords you to exit when you're wrong."
"4298360","4299000"," Does that make sense?"
"4299880","4305300"," Rather than panic selling up here and then whining about it and blaming other people."
"4305740","4306840"," Does that make sense to you?"
"4307940","4309680"," So this guy wants to sell again. "
"4310220","4312060"," Did he get a red candle right here?"
"4312400","4314360"," No, he didn't."
"4315580","4320740"," Because these other sellers are sitting on the sidelines waiting for that red candle."
"4321320","4324460"," The professionals and they're not seeing it, are they?"
"4333500","4336760"," You guys understand this concept in the chat, please tell me you do. "
"4340320","4346210"," You're getting fucked at calls and puts at the same time."
"4346950","4348830"," That's a disaster if you didn't get all that."
"4350610","4351570"," Yeah, I get it. "
"4352730","4354890"," So some of you are getting this concept."
"4355270","4355450"," Okay."
"4356410","4359030"," So this pissed off seller is you have a trade right now?"
"4359290","4359690"," No. "
"4361130","4363590"," Where are we likely going up?"
"4364910","4366470"," Likely going where?"
"4367430","4369990"," We're likely going right there."
"4378490","4380750"," Pull out some coffee while that happens."
"4388170","4389010"," Cool. "
"4390810","4394390"," I'm trying to show you guys how to manage trades here."
"4401790","4405130"," Getting a reversal for a bull cross to the upside."
"4410560","4412900"," Looking for 451 20. "
"4423320","4424900"," The works doesn't hit Zodiac."
"4425100","4425440"," That dude."
"4425640","4429640"," So like this, this portion of the broadcast I just gave to you. "
"4429760","4435140"," Binky, if you're watching record that because this is like a pry."
"4435280","4436660"," This works for bulls and bears."
"4437040","4437440"," Up or down. "
"4437600","4438020"," Doesn't matter."
"4438500","4439780"," You flip the chart upside down."
"4439780","4441020"," It works for bulls and bears. "
"4445780","4447900"," It's a prime example right here."
"4448280","4449840"," So now this pissed off seller."
"4450080","4451320"," He's not in a trade, right?"
"4452880","4454620"," That red bar doesn't help him. "
"4455420","4455940"," What is this?"
"4456120","4457260"," What is this guy waiting for?"
"4457700","4461060"," This guy is waiting for closing red bars below."
"4461780","4462920"," Still not there, right?"
"4463140","4463680"," He's still here."
"4464420","4465840"," But he ain't got no trade, does he?"
"4465960","4467020"," He's got no trade here. "
"4468100","4468440"," No trade."
"4479840","4480940"," I'll show you right now."
"4481060","4482040"," I'll tell you when he can reenter. "
"4482240","4484600"," I'll tell you exactly where he reenters."
"4486040","4488600"," I'm actually going to tell you he's he's short again."
"4488660","4490360"," I'm going to tell you exactly when he's short. "
"4492420","4494000"," He shouldn't be short here."
"4496040","4497700"," He should be flat right now."
"4520090","4522530"," The pissed off seller is flat right now. "
"4531960","4532660"," Thanks, pink."
"4532840","4533560"," I appreciate it."
"4538980","4541200"," Maybe I'll write pissed off seller is flat. "
"4562810","4563730"," No, I'm not a seller."
"4563990","4565110"," I'm not a seller here."
"4565210","4566550"," I've got a trade lined up. "
"4566690","4571190"," I've got a trade lined up for 452C, but I'm not in it right now."
"4571410","4572150"," I'm just sitting on it."
"4572970","4573930"," I want to take it. "
"4574050","4575690"," I want to take it right now because I know we're going."
"4576230","4577730"," I know I already know we're going up."
"4577930","4579410"," So, or my view we're going up. "
"4584930","4588110"," I shouldn't say I already know where we're going because that's not always the case."
"4593680","4595480"," But that's the red bar right there."
"4595600","4596260"," That's the expectation. "
"4604090","4608210"," I think we're going to tap HD right now running on the half hour."
"4608490","4608630"," So."
"4610090","4611670"," I don't know exactly. "
"4612830","4614330"," Or why I know exactly."
"4614610","4617230"," I don't exactly know why we're so bullish, but I kind of do."
"4620210","4623490"," I think we're going to go up there and get close to that 4720. "
"4623950","4625910"," There's not a lot of time left to do it."
"4626850","4628330"," We have to like the 15th."
"4629910","4632830"," 12th is my target, but I think it's insane to even say that publicly. "
"4633850","4637110"," Because I think people will be like, you're out of your fucking mind, but."
"4643470","4645650"," We'll print those calls for JPM, I guess."
"4651150","4653210"," Where all those puts they sold down there. "
"4658590","4660190"," To make diamond very happy."
"4660370","4661230"," And then the end of the quarter."
"4664790","4667930"," Make a good quarter this year or this quarter will be very good for JPM. "
"4674340","4675340"," Waiting to enter a trade."
"4676660","4678320"," I have no like I have no want to buy."
"4678460","4681940"," I don't want to trade this like it's so small that I don't even I'm not even going to bother"
"4681940","4682260"," here. "
"4685060","4686880"," Look for that next bounce right there."
"4688240","4692780"," And the big boy for our two will be on deck."
"4693080","4694860"," So we'll see how this works itself out here. "
"4700220","4702980"," Why am I not in a trade I'll show you right now."
"4703960","4705920"," I want to see this here."
"4707820","4710160"," I want to see that trade there. "
"4711720","4714160"," And I want to see a confirmation right there."
"4716240","4719640"," I want to take that trade right there."
"4732920","4739400"," Oh, this seller is getting all saucy guys like, whoo, whoo, whoo, come on down, come on down to. "
"4741300","4745060"," Captain's doppelganger buy some puts town."
"4749040","4751520"," He's like, come on, just trap these bulls."
"4752640","4753900"," Give me a red bar down here. "
"4756560","4757780"," He ain't getting it though."
"4764940","4767800"," They have quarters where they they've gotten run over."
"4768100","4771540"," They've been run over since 2021, I think. "
"4772400","4774300"," Last time I remember them getting run over."
"4776840","4783880"," 2021 was last time, I think 2020, they probably did too."
"4783880","4786320"," And then 2021 for sure twice, I think. "
"4794930","4796210"," Well, they can get run over."
"4796830","4798270"," You can do like a VIX."
"4798470","4803770"," If you do like a VIX, it was a VIX divided by SPX or something SPX divided by VIX. "
"4804510","4805650"," You can see when they get run over."
"4805730","4806810"," It's pretty pretty easy to see."
"4809010","4810090"," When they get run over. "
"4812870","4815850"," Every like one to three years, they get run over."
"4820630","4820750"," They get run over."
"4820750","4821510"," The next thing I would say is, Bob's cheap put lot. "
"4821810","4822030"," Exactly."
"4822310","4823050"," Bob's come on down."
"4823150","4823990"," Bob's cheap put lot. "
"4830510","4830990"," Okay."
"4831190","4833590"," So we talked about economic news."
"4834190","4836530"," We talked about the three bar trade, three green bars. "
"4838670","4841010"," Energy stocks we briefly talked about."
"4842570","4846390"," So if you are, if you're looking for that energy."
"4847390","4850430"," Building for that energy hurricane trade, the hurricane is here. "
"4850650","4851730"," It's like starting to come inland."
"4851730","4858430"," there's still some threats to the hurricane that can do more damage than usual, more flooding than"
"4858430","4858850"," usual."
"4859630","4864030"," If any of you, I don't know if any of you are in these companies, but somebody yesterday brought up"
"4864030","4865670"," Generac, they were looking extremely bullish. "
"4866590","4871110"," I'm in USO, you could actually trade CL if you wanted to."
"4872270","4879090"," Also consider Home Depot, Walmart, Lowe's, battery companies or another good one."
"4879250","4888850"," So generator companies like Generac, ACM for engineering companies, FLR is another ticker to"
"4888850","4889630"," consider. "
"4890670","4896430"," You saw battery companies already pumping and then some water solution companies like PG, Procter"
"4896430","4903790"," and Gamble's a good company, XLY, another good ticker for you to look at on on energy stocks."
"4907780","4911180"," Well, look at him over here, he's like, come on down and give me some closing bars."
"4912820","4913980"," Let me get short again. "
"4925140","4926640"," Am I the seller that I'm talking about?"
"4926720","4927460"," No, I'm not a seller here."
"4928920","4930620"," Not a seller, not a buyer either."
"4930740","4931840"," I'm gonna wait and see this move. "
"4932040","4933140"," I want to see this move up."
"4933260","4937760"," I want to see this happen first for me to take a trade to go up."
"4947560","4955420"," I've got yeah, HYG grounded some of that. "
"4955860","4958020"," Some of that gap HYG is taken out."
"4959680","4961700"," VIX might have a roll, but here comes your squeeze."
"4962180","4963000"," Squeeze should be here soon. "
"4963740","4965400"," Just a few moments we should start squeezing again."
"4969120","4970560"," VIX about to get hammered again."
"4982180","4994450"," Just looking for this"
"4994450","4995230"," nice quick roll, quick squeeze on this whole chat. "
"4996010","5001490"," If you are a moderator, well, first of all, Chillio, if you're watching the broadcast right now,"
"5001490","5005370"," I'm gonna keep you on as a moderator even if you don't want any responsibilities."

"5363510","5365090"," It's like they'll hide out and not say anything."
"5370030","5371310"," Think I've got everybody here. "
"5371430","5372110"," I think I got everybody."
"5373230","5373670"," Okay."
"5374470","5378170"," If I missed you, or if you weren't here, we can add you later. "

"5379430","5379790"," You missed me."
"5379850","5381870"," We'll just do you one at a time as long as the majority. "
"5384910","5385270"," Yes."
"5385290","5387730"," If you're a moderator, I want your discord handle."
"5388930","5389970"," Please just type it out. "
"5390050","5394770"," Even if you delete the comments, type it out so that I can, uh, we're going to make a special"
"5394770","5395170"," room."
"5396530","5398750"," We're going to make the special room for you."
"5399050","5400030"," It's not a special room. "
"5400030","5403410"," What we're going to do is we're going to open up a discord private room."
"5403950","5405610"," I'll keep it on during stream."

"5411350","5412410"," what's this guy doing over there?"
"5412430","5413750"," What's that guy doing over there?"
"5414750","5415790"," Do we talk to him?"
"5415890","5416890"," Do we time him out?"
"5417090","5417790"," Do we ban him?"
"5417890","5418250"," What do we do?"
"5419130","5421890"," Or, hey, can we run a poll?"
"5422570","5424710"," Who wants to run a poll and what should we ask for questions?"
"5425390","5425930"," Let's run a game. "
"5426190","5426590"," Let's do this."
"5426710","5427170"," Let's do that."
"5427930","5430670"," It's kind of like it's not just a negative place, a positive place as well. "
"5431490","5432530"," It's another good place too."
"5433250","5436490"," If you wanted to talk to a moderate and administrator of the discord."
"5437030","5443670"," You could tag an admin in that room, just be like, at admins and say, Hey, we just timed out. "
"5444070","5445010"," I don't know."
"5445250","5447630"," Bob in the basement on Twitch."
"5448190","5450610"," And can you time him out and discord as well or watch him?"
"5451190","5455750"," Make sure he's not going off the handlebars and going post on there or anything like that. "

"6183370","6185010"," Just did a trade with you brother."
"6192120","6194180"," Yeah, baby trading thirty two."

"6235900","6237760"," So you decide what you want to do right now."
"6246330","6247630"," Take your money and run."
"6250980","6252380"," How it is a good trade. "
"6253700","6255180"," You just made thirty percent."
"6256540","6257940"," People do that in a year."
"6258960","6260480"," And they're rock stars. "
"6266470","6267970"," Hey Darth Molly, how are you man?"
"6269110","6272910"," Hey Darth Molly, are you are you in the discord band?"
"6273150","6273970"," Do you have a discord handle?"
"6281590","6283010"," No, no Robin Hood."
"6283750","6284370"," You need a broker."
"6285090","6286250"," I'm going to say something's a good question. "
"6286510","6287430"," I always love these questions."
"6288370","6289410"," Someone just asked."
"6291410","6295430"," What do you recommend for a broker if you day trade?"
"6295990","6297970"," I'm going to give you a fair warning here. "
"6299150","6302850"," You never I'm going to tell you this is a true fucking shit."
"6303010","6303470"," No bullshit."
"6305070","6309790"," Never ever day trade with a broker that you cannot call ever. "
"6310770","6312290"," Ever ever ever."
"6312530","6315450"," And I'm going to give you your best bet is always a prime bank."
"6316410","6321130"," I guess who's a Schwab is moving over now fully to think or swim. "
"6321870","6323450"," And there is a reason for this."
"6324050","6329510"," You want the order like order sell order flow selling is gnarly."
"6329790","6332070"," What I always recommend is this was what I did. "
"6333390","6337850"," Over the years I've signed up for fucking twenty different brokerages."
"6337970","6338950"," I shit you not like twenty."
"6340130","6342250"," I leave a lot of those brokerages open. "
"6342250","6350910"," I did a test once where I was watching the pricing of options between brokerages."
"6352090","6354390"," And you want the best price that you can get."
"6355190","6356830"," And there is discrepancy. "
"6358510","6363210"," In brokerages people tell you there isn't there is if you open up like six screeners in front of"
"6363210","6363350"," you."
"6363590","6368090"," You will see pennies on zero dates on larger trades."
"6368090","6371010"," This is a big learning lesson moment. "
"6372310","6376050"," On smaller trades you will see penny differences those matter."
"6376970","6380790"," If you're trading a week out or a month out or you're trading spreads."
"6382150","6384110"," You should be with a broker that you can call. "
"6384610","6387430"," If you're trading day trading broker that you can call."
"6388150","6391110"," I'm going to explain two reasons or a bunch of reasons for this."
"6391770","6392130"," One. "
"6393430","6399590"," Opening and closing positions is difficult with order flow brokerages."
"6400510","6403130"," Getting fills is a challenge."
"6403690","6406250"," If you try to tell me that you don't see a difference in pricing. "
"6407090","6408430"," We'll do it on the show one day."
"6408510","6409190"," I'll show you the difference."
"6409350","6412870"," Maybe I can open them all up on a screen or some and show you all the differences. "
"6413530","6415410"," Now let's say you're like I don't I don't believe you cap."
"6415510","6416170"," It's all the same."
"6417550","6421390"," There's another aspect to order flow selling that a lot of you don't know about. "
"6421850","6424510"," It's called it's some people call it slippage but."
"6426130","6427390"," I have a hard time."
"6428410","6431170"," Closing positions and opening them when I'm chasing. "
"6431790","6433610"," So let's say we're going up."
"6434750","6437530"," If I'm if I'm trading with an order flow brokerage."
"6438730","6442310"," They will oftentimes I'll put out they'll say it says 10 cents. "
"6443070","6444530"," I'll slam the buy order."
"6444530","6448070"," The order will not fill and will automatically flip to 11 12 cents."
"6449450","6454690"," Right and I won't I won't fill that order and then it'll go to 13 14 and you're just constantly"
"6454690","6455130"," chasing. "
"6455630","6457650"," That's because of order flow selling."
"6458170","6460030"," Same thing on the on the closing."
"6460530","6462450"," Oftentimes I'll try to close positions. "
"6463390","6467670"," And on day trading specifically and they will not open or close."
"6468470","6472430"," Now there's a whole nother thing about like a few a few own like."
"6473570","6475310"," Three hundred blocks of options. "
"6475610","6478950"," And let's say you own like a thousand fucking options you're trying to sell and there's not enough"
"6478950","6479590"," quiddity."
"6479770","6481970"," They'll let jagged miss when you're selling."
"6482490","6483470"," That's a whole nother thing. "
"6483730","6486170"," But what I'm talking to you about is the slippage in order flow."
"6486590","6487850"," Now here's the bigger deal."
"6487850","6488850"," This is the big one. "
"6489630","6490450"," This is the one."
"6491130","6494710"," That will send you outside a chopper tree down."
"6496270","6504370"," If anything happens like your brokerage stops working literally like your screener. "
"6505450","6508210"," Stops working that's happened to me."
"6508510","6513650"," I've had I can't tell you the number of times where I've had like trying to close an order or"
"6513650","6514410"," open an order."
"6515110","6517550"," Where I've had actual problems with my brokerage. "
"6517550","6524550"," If you have a real broker even if they sell order flow but not but a broker that you can"
"6524550","6527030"," call immediately and say hey."
"6528050","6531330"," You know this just happened on my platform."
"6532330","6533930"," They will refund you your money. "
"6534330","6535570"," Now don't abuse that."
"6536530","6540690"," If you're like a regular trader with a brokerage they will refund"
"6540690","6547530"," you your money."
"6550370","6555670"," Now the second reason telling you to get a broker a real broker that you can call and they answer"
"6555670","6556370"," the fucking phone. "
"6556930","6561110"," Like dial the phone and by the third ring someone's on there for you."
"6562370","6567230"," The second reason that you do that is because if you're ever going to trade a spread."
"6568130","6573350"," You can likely call and negotiate a price if they are an order flow brokerage. "
"6573970","6581050"," So if you're like I want this for 47 cents and it's that the ask is 50 spreads a little"
"6581050","6581410"," wide."
"6581950","6585890"," You can like call them up and say hey man can I get 47 on this."
"6586830","6590110"," You know I'm trying to place a $20,000 trade $30,000 trade. "
"6590610","6594010"," It's possible to get that in some time on it like two three months month and a half."
"6594650","6598990"," Oftentimes if you know your broker talk to him you nice to him will sometimes give you that"
"6598990","6599410"," discount."
"6600770","6602830"," You ain't getting that shit from Robin Hood. "
"6604110","6609690"," So Robin Hood does great for like what I do like Robin Hood for is its potential to become a"
"6609690","6610630"," kick ass trade in sight."
"6611390","6613210"," It's potential that it has down the road."
"6613870","6618670"," Right now what I really like about Robin Hood is that you can do complex spreads on it entry level"
"6618670","6619430"," complex spreads. "
"6620990","6623950"," I like that I also like Robin Hood for."
"6624770","6629570"," Maybe buying a stock and holding that's not a high beta stock."
"6631610","6635170"," You can't buy GME you know that kind of shit. "
"6636730","6643570"," But you could buy like a Clorox bleach or something and run into no issues with it."
"6643930","6651010"," So it's in the other positive thing about Robin Hood is that it's an entry drug for young retail"
"6651010","6651550"," traders."
"6651550","6653510"," So I'm not I don't mind that either. "
"6654470","6655590"," Some people hate that."
"6656270","6657350"," I don't mind it."
"6658130","6665010"," There's a there's a that argument to me is banks not wanting retailers to have a larger share of"
"6665010","6665370"," the market. "
"6665790","6669090"," To be honest with you as active date as active traders."
"6669870","6673910"," They don't have to own as much of the market as these big banks own but I'm talking about when"
"6673910","6674990"," the banks are making moves."
"6675930","6680290"," When the when options are influencing the market the other 30% of the time. "
"6681110","6686530"," They don't want you to have 30% of that share 30 40% of that market share."
"6687170","6688590"," They don't want you having that."
"6688830","6693670"," So there's like they want to keep you like 25% of the market share or lower if possible as"
"6693670","6694030"," a retailer. "
"6694550","6701370"," But retailers if they rise up they start capturing 34% and it's going to be fucking war."
"6708470","6709310"," So there you go."
"6709390","6710370"," There's a trade for you. "
"6711030","6711430"," Right."
"6711530","6712290"," You took that trade."
"6712530","6712810"," Yippee. "
"6713010","6713310"," You're happy."
"6719980","6723780"," We talked yesterday about some grinding in the market."
"6724060","6725720"," So let's look at a higher time frame here. "
"6726860","6727380"," Let's look."
"6727540","6728660"," Let's scroll out a little bit."
"6732910","6735950"," Just let's scroll out right here and take a look at what's happening here. "
"6736050","6736210"," Right."
"6738310","6739290"," What's going on here."
"6739390","6741110"," We came that squeeze all the way up here. "
"6741310","6741410"," Right."
"6741610","6741690"," Yeah."
"6741870","6742530"," Who tapped it. "
"6742710","6742830"," Boom."
"6743190","6743290"," Yeah."
"6743290","6745210"," Who baby came back up. "
"6745210","6748490"," Where else we do came back down closed all the bullshit down below."
"6749150","6752550"," And ready to reload to go higher to the end of the day up here."
"6752550","6752850"," Right. "
"6753110","6753870"," That's the thesis."
"6754950","6755470"," Right."
"6755650","6758470"," Closed all that bullshit that pre not quite the pre market low. "
"6758610","6759170"," But most of it."
"6760370","6763410"," Didn't quite get the pre market low down here."
"6763410","6767130"," Did we didn't quite get that pre market low down here. "
"6768570","6771130"," But did close most of this bullshit down here."
"6771130","6771950"," This opening price."
"6772690","6774650"," And now we're trying to go higher. "
"6774990","6775950"," Where are we trying to go."
"6777170","6778930"," So we're going to go to a five minute chart here."
"6780730","6781210"," Right. "
"6781550","6782610"," This is a five minute chart."
"6782850","6782930"," Right."
"6784430","6786850"," You've got the first trade up here. "
"6787030","6788470"," I said I wasn't going to take this trade."
"6788650","6790190"," But I did because you guys wanted to take one."
"6790710","6791930"," What are we looking for now. "
"6792730","6796810"," We're looking to find out if the six CMA is going to bring us up."
"6797350","6797830"," Here."
"6798610","6799130"," Okay. "
"6799430","6800310"," Not this one."
"6802170","6802690"," Right."
"6802810","6804130"," But if we do go down there. "
"6805290","6807090"," That one to take us up."
"6807230","6807370"," Right."
"6807610","6808690"," So that's what we're looking for now. "
"6809290","6810790"," What's our next price target."
"6811110","6811470"," Do you know."
"6813570","6817110"," Our next price target to the upside is a new high. "
"6817710","6819450"," So above our one."
"6819670","6821530"," We are looking for this trade right now."
"6823510","6826970"," So we're on the six or that or the for the twenty seventy. "
"6827210","6827750"," Either way."
"6828970","6830630"," We're looking for a new high."
"6832710","6833230"," Right. "
"6833570","6834390"," That's what we're looking for."
"6834510","6835310"," We've got the four."
"6836870","6838650"," Four fifty one sixty two. "
"6839110","6841730"," And now we're looking for a new high to the upside."
"6842310","6843110"," So next PT."
"6852800","6854620"," The right up here. "
"6856760","6858220"," Pissed off sorrows to get rid of them."
"6858420","6859000"," We'll get rid of."
"6859940","6861880"," The panicking sellers up there. "
"6863400","6866060"," And now we're looking for this one right here for fifty one."
"6867140","6867960"," Seventy three."
"6869560","6871220"," Next target to the upside. "
"6873120","6876000"," And this could this could actually just go right now."
"6876140","6877980"," We're not we don't even there's no requirement that we."
"6879000","6881540"," It's actually no requirement that we actually go there. "
"6881540","6883140"," It's just go straight there right now."
"6885920","6888420"," So either right here or right down here."
"6914790","6916010"," You got grinded. "
"6928210","6931950"," I don't know why I'm not showing the chat from YouTube."
"6933190","6935090"," Like streamlabs fucking sucks."
"6941370","6944430"," Hey, I'll do it on a on YouTube right now. "
"6944430","6945250"," I'm trying to read your chat."
"6945750","6946170"," Hey, Jimmy."
"6946350","6946750"," How are you doing?"
"6948050","6951210"," Jimmy saying if you trade options, interactive brokers, I be. "
"6951410","6952350"," Yeah, I like interactive brokers."
"6953130","6954010"," I also like."
"6955170","6956550"," What did I use to use. "
"6958170","6959770"," It's like an interactive broker competitor."
"6960170","6961850"," There's another really good one out there too."
"6962290","6964310"," That does a good job of competing with them. "
"6964310","6965510"," And I like Ivy."
"6965830","6966850"," I got no issues with Ivy."
"6970640","6972240"," More contracts to trade. "
"6972660","6973740"," Yeah, on."
"6974500","6976020"," Chase said the more contracts to trade."
"6976360","6979720"," I normally run into problems on like if I'm trading like. "
"6980860","6981840"," Thousand contracts."
"6982880","6984080"," Not usually a thousand."
"6984200","6984800"," Usually like 900. "
"6985580","6986220"," Like 900."
"6986840","6987800"," Eighteen hundred contracts."
"6988540","6990740"," If it's like a huge squeeze that expected. "
"6991540","6992460"," Hard to close that shit."
"6992460","6993140"," If it's expected."
"6993700","6994320"," Not as hard. "
"6994320","6996540"," And a high on a high liquidity stock."
"6997080","6999620"," Let's see if like an unexpected squeeze higher."
"7000260","7002520"," That's what I really run into problems closing. "
"7004420","7006820"," That's usually negotiate much lower than even the ask."
"7017750","7018150"," Yeah."
"7022490","7023230"," Market is insane. "
"7023650","7024010"," Coming around."
"7024210","7024630"," No pecs."
"7025630","7026470"," Yeah, Chase. "
"7027070","7028010"," Do you think they get there?"
"7028110","7029390"," I think we get there by the 12th, man."
"7030150","7034150"," I don't want to say that publicly, but I don't even know if it takes until Opex."
"7034370","7039910"," I think we like go up to it into Opex and we come back down and settle in for Opex. "
"7047220","7048240"," I don't get."
"7048360","7049120"," I don't get any fees."
"7049560","7051200"," So I get fees, but I don't see them. "
"7051460","7052600"," I don't notice the fees."
"7058160","7058940"," Apple Chase."
"7059560","7060660"," Apple should run up. "
"7060660","7063860"," Chase their event is on the 12th of September."
"7064620","7066760"," So that kind of falls in line, doesn't it?"
"7068400","7069840"," So you sell the event, right?"
"7070740","7075180"," So Apple keep going up until until the 12th of September."
"7078420","7079620"," Hey, you're welcome. "
"7079620","7080240"," Just ain't right."
"7083040","7084520"," Do I think 443?"
"7085100","7085560"," Yes, I do."
"7087220","7089300"," We're not going to test the hourly trigger. "
"7089900","7091500"," Right now we're trading the half."
"7091700","7094520"," So there's no need to right now."
"7094560","7095380"," But yes, will we?"
"7095380","7097440"," Yeah, fuck yeah, we'll eventually come to the hourly trigger. "
"7097560","7098840"," If you're waiting for that, just keep waiting."
"7106860","7108340"," Yeah, I guess my limit order, right?"
"7109440","7112040"," Well, I don't want to say anything because I think I'm being watched."
"7112420","7116440"," I'm fairly certain that some funds are watching me. "
"7116640","7117060"," Not fail."
"7117200","7118540"," I've been told that they're watching so."
"7119280","7125000"," And I know that there's, I know that if I, not know, but I had a conversation with, I had"
"7125000","7128660"," a conversation with a friend with Joe Donut. "
"7128660","7134900"," And we tried to calculate the impact on the options market that were likely happening."
"7134900","7136040"," It's, it's pretty high."
"7136400","7140700"," So I'm afraid of, I'm afraid to be in front running. "
"7140880","7142760"," I'm afraid of too much impact on the market."
"7144880","7148100"," Cause there's like, I don't know, there's like 1000."
"7148480","7151740"," I slowed down on the Twitter posts too for the same reason, but. "
"7152960","7157000"," Like you get like, you get like 12,000 people on Twitter read a post and then."
"7158160","7163680"," You know, 1000 people here read a post, then we got 2000 people in the discord reading the post."
"7165220","7168520"," It's like five, six thousand, let's say half of them tell their friends. "
"7168900","7170400"," That's another 10 or 20,000."
"7171180","7173080"," Start to think about the impact of the market."
"7173280","7175520"," And it's like, uh, I don't want to tell people this shit. "
"7175640","7178300"," Like some of the stuff I don't want to do at all, like."
"7180620","7182540"," And then they can go against me too."
"7182740","7184000"," I think it like hurts me sometimes. "
"7184920","7185960"," I'll be honest with you."
"7187340","7188300"," I'll be honest with you."
"7188960","7191480"," Like, uh, there's a part of me that doesn't want to tell anybody anything. "
"7193620","7197320"," It's like, ooh, look, we're going up or expect us to go here and then I expect us to go"
"7197320","7197520"," there."
"7209230","7212150"," Right on parley's for days, saying caps trade sells brought me back."
"7212330","7212410"," Yep. "
"7212670","7215770"," And you can, you can apply all of this on higher timeframes."
"7216270","7217990"," You can apply every, every part of this."
"7218730","7221330"," I don't care if we trade in a month out three months out. "
"7221330","7223970"," This works on a larger chart, like a bigger chart."
"7229970","7231410"," Yeah, you can apply all that."
"7231470","7235610"," You don't need to do this on a, uh, you can, you can do this on this, my day chart. "
"7236030","7239910"," And use these same concepts on a higher timeframe."
"7241070","7242090"," Much higher timeframe."
"7243350","7251170"," Uh, that's not true, Chase. "
"7252870","7254050"," That's a false brother."
"7255070","7259730"," Uh, we chase just said we are now one of the most expensive markets ever on a melt up."
"7259730","7264950"," Uh, no fundamentals, just positioning all multiple expansion going to global growth slowing. "
"7265130","7266370"," Let's, let's chat about that."
"7266430","7267170"," It's a good topic, Chase."
"7267770","7274150"," Uh, we're going to look at that, that, that argument that's being ported out there and, uh, pushed"
"7274150","7274730"," out there. "
"7275290","7277110"," We're going to talk about that right now."
"7277770","7278730"," It's a good one, Chase."
"7278870","7279170"," I like it. "
"7280670","7282010"," Uh, hold on one second, brother."
"7283870","7291540"," Uh, what are we looking for here?"
"7291540","7292460"," Here we go."
"7292860","7293980"," We're going to chat real quick. "
"7297930","7301290"," We're going to talk about the most expensive market ever."
"7303670","7306170"," We're going to go over to this right here."
"7309740","7311220"," We're going to have a special look. "
"7311860","7313980"," I always like to bring this chart up."
"7316520","7318640"," We're going to have a little chit chat session here."
"7321080","7323100"," And I want to show you guys something here. "
"7323100","7327720"," So this is the Ford PE ratio for the stock market."
"7329340","7334440"," Uh, you might, you may barely be able to see this, but I want you to see something."
"7335460","7337480"," That was pretty high, wasn't it, right?"
"7339000","7341860"," Came down and I want you to pay attention to something. "
"7342440","7344860"," This is 1975 right here."
"7347060","7347960"," Right, boom."
"7348600","7350680"," Came back down right here, right?"
"7350680","7353820"," And I want to show you what happened here. "
"7354520","7356100"," So this is 1980."
"7357440","7360380"," Does anybody know who became president in 1980?"
"7361440","7362440"," Anybody out there?"
"7362760","7363680"," Jimmy Barry probably knows."
"7365300","7366160"," Anybody know?"
"7367880","7370360"," Guess how old these people are right now. "
"7372000","7374780"," They're the people that you see on CNBC."
"7375840","7378200"," All the fat old white guys with fat greasy palms."
"7379120","7380640"," And guess what they've been doing?"
"7381280","7382540"," I'm buying this right here. "
"7382720","7382900"," Yahoo."
"7384060","7384380"," Yahoo."
"7385260","7385480"," Yahoo. "
"7386780","7388060"," Yeah, baby."
"7388440","7389060"," Give me that cocaine."
"7390440","7390700"," Right?"
"7392220","7395920"," This white line is the same representation on the ticks, right?"
"7398600","7402760"," And these same guys came out to you. "
"7404380","7406680"," All right, I called them out when they were on CNBC."
"7406680","7410400"," I called them out right here."
"7412700","7415400"," I posted this chart on Fintway. "
"7416860","7421980"," And I said, they're on CNBC lying to you."
"7422560","7425860"," They're literally lying to you."
"7427720","7429860"," They've been lying to you. "
"7430020","7432660"," These same guys have been lying to you."
"7434660","7437780"," Since these late 70s, early 80s."
"7438500","7439600"," And look what they've been doing. "
"7440200","7441900"," Having a fucking party, haven't they?"
"7442280","7444980"," On one consistent line."
"7445540","7451120"," Going all the way up there, drinking your milkshake, aren't they?"
"7452240","7453580"," And what did they do here?"
"7454600","7455620"," They drank your milkshake."
"7457020","7458520"," They lied to you again. "
"7459220","7464320"," So when they tell you they're not greedy, they're lying."
"7465460","7468580"," They are lying to you."
"7469640","7475900"," And when they tell you this is the most overpriced market in all time, they're also lying to you. "
"7476660","7479320"," Because if you look here, it isn't, is it?"
"7480460","7484560"," It's just slightly coming higher from way back in 1992."
"7485980","7487660"," And look at all this up here."
"7488520","7491860"," Prior example, prior example, prior example. "
"7492340","7495440"," We're a little bit higher than this previous one in 2017."
"7496900","7498620"," Prior example right here."
"7500600","7503400"," So let's just look at that right now, right?"
"7503660","7505020"," Do we have a red bar here?"
"7505340","7505360"," Nope. "
"7506100","7507300"," Do we have a red bar here?"
"7507680","7507800"," Nope."
"7508960","7511120"," No, no red bars doing, right?"
"7512500","7515000"," So let's just look at that real quick, right?"
"7516320","7519440"," Are we the most overpriced markets in history?"
"7520220","7522080"," The answer is no."
"7524040","7525240"," Absolutely not. "
"7525920","7528220"," And this isn't even that high yet, is it?"
"7529220","7530640"," Not that high yet."
"7531040","7534920"," And this month is not, or this quarter is not closed out yet, is it?"
"7535640","7537020"," This is your monthly candle here."
"7538020","7539980"," And watch this last candle right here, right?"
"7541540","7543940"," Look at that little bit of green right there. "
"7543940","7546620"," A little bit of green indecision candle."
"7547160","7549380"," You can barely see it right in there."
"7549540","7552460"," Monthly indecision candle, where are we going?"
"7553200","7560240"," Do you think that they want this month to end red, right?"
"7561420","7563020"," Yeah, that's what a seller wants. "
"7563100","7564400"," They want that red candle in the monthly."
"7565120","7566620"," And what day is today?"
"7567280","7568080"," It's the 30th."
"7569020","7571860"," So does this month end red or green?"
"7571860","7573180"," Big question, right?"
"7573500","7575080"," Does that end red or green?"
"7575900","7578660"," We would love to see the green close, right?"
"7578820","7580220"," Is that little litty bitty one right there?"
"7580940","7582720"," Is that little litty bitty one right there?"
"7583280","7585480"," And what is this month closing right now?"
"7585520","7586560"," What is this candle showing?"
"7586780","7587560"," You can barely see it. "
"7588040","7590000"," It's green right now, believe it or not."
"7590180","7591000"," It's actually green."
"7592360","7595060"," So is this the most overpriced market?"
"7595940","7597340"," Based on Ford P.E. estimates?"
"7598060","7598140"," Nope. "
"7598940","7600680"," Did they buy the dip down here?"
"7600680","7601240"," Yep."
"7601580","7603960"," If we know they're greedy down here."
"7604980","7606420"," We know that they're greed. "
"7607840","7608840"," Stepped in here."
"7608980","7610740"," Do you think that's enough greed?"
"7611940","7613560"," I'm going to say fuck no."
"7615740","7618000"," Fuck no, they're greedy as fuck. "
"7618860","7619920"," And they ain't done."
"7622280","7623540"," They're not done."
"7624040","7627860"," From my previous experience with them going back to. "
"7628520","7629400"," You ready for it?"
"7629400","7633080"," 1998 and 2000."
"7634280","7636020"," They're not done being greedy."
"7636860","7637500"," It's now 2023. "
"7638980","7640240"," 23 years later."
"7640700","7643360"," And I'm going to say have chances are."
"7643820","7645280"," Probably not the top here. "
"7645400","7647300"," We got this one previous example here."
"7647820","7649880"," But they're not done being greedy."
"7650300","7650920"," You know what I'm saying?"
"7651820","7652040"," Greedy. "
"7652360","7655780"," And the worst part of this chart is what?"
"7657220","7661780"," Have we since 1978 actually gone down?"
"7662860","7665980"," No, it's just gone up and up and up and up."
"7666540","7668720"," And what would I expect to happen here?"
"7669060","7672600"," Even if roles, I'm expecting to buy that shit right there too, aren't I?"
"7674120","7679660"," So all that talk they tell you, all that shit they roll up and sell to you."
"7680080","7682220"," Has been a lie since 1978. "
"7684400","7685800"," Then a fat lie."
"7686940","7688480"," Absolute fat lie."
"7689460","7692840"," Stole to you by someone trying to make some money on a short or long. "
"7693500","7696560"," Meanwhile, in the background, they're just buying it."
"7697280","7700660"," Buying it, buying it, buying it like greedy fat pigs that they are."
"7701480","7702520"," Since 1980. "
"7703760","7708060"," Well, that's passed a lot to do with the tax structure and the tax changes that we've made."
"7708060","7710420"," That's trickle down economics for you."
"7710580","7711260"," Poor's out there. "
"7719700","7720940"," That's the Ford."
"7723320","7726100"," P.E. ratio for our stock market."
"7726760","7729360"," And they have never stopped buying that dip down there. "
"7729600","7731280"," Every time we go down there, they buy it."
"7732380","7734940"," Been doing it since the 1980s."
"7744890","7751510"," Shit, if you're a long-term trader, you're a long-term investor, that should be your friend right"
"7751510","7751750"," there. "
"7751870","7752570"," You want to see it again?"
"7754930","7763750"," If you're a long-time investor, if you're like a 22-decade investor, you know exactly where to buy."
"7764470","7768430"," There, there, there, there, there, there, there, and there."
"7770690","7772190"," Long-term investor. "
"7779850","7781010"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7782390","7783610"," That'll piss a bear off."
"7783770","7784650"," You want to piss a bear off?"
"7784870","7786010"," That'll, that'll rage a bear. "
"7786370","7787090"," That'll, that'll rage a bear."
"7790670","7793330"," You want to, you want to see the thesis behind the fraud continues?"
"7793730","7794510"," That was it right there."
"7802410","7804530"," Do you want me to tell you the next time we're there?"
"7804530","7809650"," I remember when we bounced to people were like, oh, dude, we're going down hard. "
"7809650","7810650"," I'm like, no, we ain't."
"7811650","7813130"," They're going to buy the fuck out of that."
"7814190","7815410"," And they went on CNBC. "
"7815710","7821630"," These guys, all these fat old white guys were like, they're, they're like, the greed needs to stop."
"7821770","7824210"," I'm like, dude, you've been doing this shit since 1980."
"7824610","7826650"," You fat fucking liar. "
"7827090","7829270"," I was like, you're buying this right now."
"7839000","7841060"," What's another thing we can extrapolate from that?"
"7841420","7843560"," Do you guys know what we can extrapolate for that?"
"7844040","7844540"," You want to know?"
"7844700","7846520"," There's another cool thing you can extrapolate from this."
"7847340","7849160"," What else can you extrapolate for this?"
"7850480","7853400"," You can also extrapolate the length of time these last, right?"
"7854740","7856020"," Is it usually six months?"
"7856820","7856920"," No. "
"7858940","7860160"," No is the answer."
"7862060","7864580"," Sometimes it is, but not frequently, is it?"
"7865280","7867440"," Usually it lasts like a year and a half to three years."
"7869160","7871400"," Have you been in a bull run for a year and a half to three years?"
"7872060","7872420"," No. "
"7873040","7874040"," The answer is no."
"7880670","7881610"," You got it, right?"
"7882090","7885850"," So if you guys, hold on a second here."
"7887010","7888830"," You guys want this to keep for yourselves?"
"7892670","7893630"," You guys want this?"
"7895070","7896350"," You guys want me to give you this?"
"7896590","7897190"," Hold on a second here. "
"7898190","7899710"," You dirty dogs want this?"
"7899930","7900630"," Are you an investor?"
"7901490","7902370"," Are you an investor?"
"7904310","7906410"," Are you a top and bottom caller?"
"7908190","7912710"," Are you watching me right now and you're out there and you've got a half of a million followers and"
"7912710","7915090"," you want to know when to call the tops and the bottoms?"
"7916250","7917670"," Correctly every single time."
"7918410","7919030"," Here you go."
"7921350","7923570"," So you pop this in. "
"7924490","7927730"," You pop that into a to trading view."
"7931820","7935380"," And now you're now you have the now you have the sauce brother."
"7935880","7937380"," Now you got the sauce. "
"7942460","7946040"," So there you go."
"7947930","7948730"," So there you go."
"7948810","7949450"," I just posted. "
"7949710","7958990"," I just posted something that says quand dl colon multiple sp 500 p ratio month."
"7959130","7960190"," That's what you want."
"7961230","7963510"," Matter of fact, guess what you could do with that?"
"7964230","7965590"," What could you do with that?"
"7966830","7968610"," You go smoke some weed, right?"
"7970970","7972110"," Hold on here. "
"7975130","7977230"," You go smoke some marijuana, right?"
"7977450","7978490"," Go party on the beach."
"7980110","7982970"," Set an alert right on that line right there, couldn't you?"
"7984950","7987630"," Set an alert right on this line right here."
"7989010","7990610"," You go a little bit higher with it. "
"7990710","7991630"," You go right about there."
"7993730","7995450"," Set that line slightly higher."
"7996490","7999070"," You could make an alert saying when we're crossing. "
"8000430","8003450"," We're crossing below that line right there."
"8004250","8006650"," Time to start getting along, right?"
"8007990","8009450"," Cross below that line."
"8009570","8010310"," Start to get along. "
"8010650","8011750"," Touch the line right here."
"8013450","8015930"," Went below the line, below line, below line."
"8016530","8020010"," And the moment that you get that alert, you could turn off all your alerts. "
"8020490","8023270"," Every last alert that you want for the next decade."
"8028360","8030340"," And every time that alert went off."
"8031020","8033280"," You could say, send it to my bat phone. "
"8035000","8038820"," And then you like turn back, turn, turn CNBC back on again."
"8040660","8044580"," And you're going to get like all these nut dip shits, but liars."
"8047000","8049320"," Stone, you not to buy the dip while they buy it. "
"8049880","8052060"," So they can tell you in three months to buy it."
"8052560","8053140"," You know what I'm saying?"
"8054480","8055720"," They want in first."
"8055720","8059000"," And then you get to buy their bags. "
"8070100","8073680"," You might have to do the, you might have to delete the, um."
"8075160","8078400"," The MLTP Y colon thing."
"8079560","8082960"," If it still doesn't work for you, let me know and I'll try to replicate it. "
"8084260","8089060"," You can just, you can probably just type in symbols and symbol search."
"8089640","8094800"," Type in S&P 500 PE ratio."
"8100800","8101960"," It's a great little chart. "
"8102920","8104820"," So it's one of my favorite charts."
"8105840","8109200"," You're going to get an alert package from it on our website."
"8110260","8113260"," So we'll talk about it when we're back down there again. "
"8114180","8118400"," You'll have shiny old me telling you, Hey, look, guess where we are again."
"8122140","8123460"," Time to buy the market."
"8125360","8126660"," But cup, it's all burning. "
"8126940","8128880"," I know we're going to buy it here."
"8141350","8142810"," I like the monthly."
"8144470","8145690"," I like the monthly. "
"8145970","8146970"," I like to know like."
"8147750","8152030"," So last year when we people were saying this is not the bottom and I was like, they're fucking"
"8152030","8152310"," wrong."
"8152850","8154350"," It was like they're fucking wrong. "
"8155030","8157070"," I knew they were wrong."
"8157430","8160550"," Oh, my thesis was they're wrong."
"8161830","8167130"," And the only way they're right is if we had a fundamental shift. "
"8167950","8169170"," In greed."
"8170970","8174010"," Fundamental shift in our tax code."
"8174670","8179650"," Fundamental change to our society like a world war. "
"8181270","8185630"," Not even not even COVID like a world war like outside of something like that."
"8188050","8192549"," My thesis is sound and it proved itself to be sound again."
"8192830","8192950"," So. "
"8204799","8207000"," I have problems with."
"8208940","8210139"," I have problems with."
"8210299","8212299"," I have problems with tasting not think or swim. "
"8214620","8216000"," Secret sauce, baby."
"8222260","8223400"," I agree, John."
"8223559","8224840"," I agree 100% man. "
"8225780","8226980"," I agree 100% dude."
"8228740","8229139"," 100%."
"8229980","8234700"," If you were able to buy that bottom, it was a great place to buy a bottom. "
"8236760","8237459"," Great play."
"8237559","8241520"," Matter of fact, if we go back to that chart real quick, you could probably."
"8242820","8243340"," That's all. "
"8243500","8244340"," Let's take a look at them."
"8245360","8247520"," So on your own time, you can do this."
"8248459","8251000"," So let's snap some lines and talk about this. "
"8252180","8253219"," Had you bought."
"8254139","8257080"," In September 1st of 1984."
"8259139","8260840"," Here's the next cross right here. "
"8260879","8264440"," If you had bought January 1st, 1989."
"8265600","8269420"," If you had bought May 1st, 1995."
"8271180","8272680"," You would have missed this run right here. "
"8273400","8276120"," But if you bought again in September of 2006."
"8279219","8282120"," If you had bought again on this next tip down below."
"8283879","8286940"," September or September 1st of 2011. "
"8288160","8293340"," And then if you had bought again down here in January of 2019."
"8294580","8296440"," And then last one."
"8297320","8298840"," Was right down here. "
"8300559","8303240"," In June of 2022."
"8304700","8307180"," You could even make a case for this one over here."
"8307700","8310719"," This is September 1st of 2022. "
"8311500","8313219"," And you hadn't listened to anybody."
"8313959","8315100"," But this chart."
"8315780","8317040"," You'd be doing quite well right now. "
"8317700","8319160"," Absolutely fucking well."
"8320139","8321240"," So if you're an investor."
"8323020","8325219"," You're just looking to make this plane right here. "
"8325580","8327459"," And just wait for a break below it."
"8328180","8332020"," Push your cards in your money in your tips in your."
"8333040","8338020"," Doobies in your tea, whatever it is that you your clams, whatever it is that you. "
"8338459","8341280"," However, whatever your money sources are wealth is."
"8341700","8343860"," And you just go all in right there."
"8344820","8345540"," Has worked. "
"8347139","8348340"," Since 1980."
"8349260","8352379"," How many years that 43 years."
"8352980","8353760"," It's worked. "
"8357340","8358299"," 43 years."
"8363000","8366240"," You got somebody out there telling you this is the most it's been valued."
"8366240","8367820"," You can kiss my ass with that shit. "
"8368260","8368879"," We need even close."
"8369780","8371280"," We need even close."
"8373200","8374160"," 43 years. "
"8374600","8374879"," Feel that."
"8375299","8377639"," If you're a collapsed bear feel that right now."
"8379219","8380180"," 43 years. "
"8381780","8383219"," That dip has been bought."
"8384120","8385040"," 43 years."
"8388320","8389800"," 43 years, man. "
"8390100","8391100"," Think about that right now."
"8391520","8393340"," That's got to piss off a collapse bear."
"8394320","8396320"," 43 years of being wrong. "
"8396900","8397300"," 43."
"8399240","8399800"," Wrong."
"8403360","8412720"," If you buy that shit, you don't you never sell. "
"8412720","8418700"," You know, you know, during the initial initial part of it, you go high growth and then the end of"
"8418700","8418840"," it."
"8419140","8422140"," You switch over to spy or something like that or a vanguard."
"8423840","8426060"," You roll over that in a vanguard. "
"8427520","8429880"," But if you do that system, you should always be up."
"8430600","8433560"," You if you did that system, you would never be down."
"8434080","8434560"," Never. "
"8435240","8438680"," If you just bought vanguard or spy there, you're always up."
"8438680","8445040"," And you're just going to sell puts against that for the next 40 fucking years."
"8448900","8449660"," It's true. "
"8452840","8455300"," A mere brief 43 years."
"8456760","8461800"," So like if you bought that bottom in June, September, October, October 12th bottom, you bought"
"8461800","8462060"," that."
"8462820","8467580"," You just sell puts for the next fucking 10 years from that point lower. "
"8469640","8472460"," It even brings up another question, doesn't it?"
"8472560","8473960"," What's your other question that it brings up?"
"8474140","8474420"," Do you know?"
"8475820","8479580"," It's kind of telling you that 3500 is the bottom, isn't it?"
"8480280","8485060"," It's kind of telling you, you might not ever see 4300 or 3500 ever again, doesn't it?"
"8485840","8487400"," Kind of telling you that, isn't it?"
"8487620","8489220"," It's kind of, maybe."
"8491060","8492500"," Where are we going right now?"
"8492720","8493740"," Are we going up right now?"
"8493740","8495480"," Could I draw that in for you enough?"
"8496340","8498080"," Could I draw that in there for you enough?"
"8498900","8500620"," Those yellow lines work for you?"
"8503140","8505800"," 452 C is now trading 40 cents."
"8515700","8517400"," So there's your thing right there. "
"8523130","8527270"," I don't know what else to, I don't know how else to make it simpler for you."
"8531940","8535360"," Okay, so another squeeze coming up right here."
"8535580","8537140"," Two nice trades for bulls. "
"8538560","8539980"," Sellers, hopefully you got out."
"8540340","8542420"," Here's the second trade for bulls right here."
"8544540","8546960"," You can take your money and run at R1 if you want. "
"8547140","8549520"," You can take your money and run at the PT up here for the new high."
"8550120","8551200"," This could be slightly lower."
"8552080","8554540"," I feel like a tick lower right there if you want it to be more conservative. "
"8556560","8557600"," Hello, handsome boy."
"8557820","8558360"," What are you doing?"
"8558780","8560200"," Well, what are you doing handsome boy?"
"8560420","8561840"," I got two handsome boys today."
"8561940","8562620"," What are you guys doing?"
"8563800","8564340"," What's up, handsome?"
"8565580","8565980"," That's up. "
"8566340","8566780"," I love you too."
"8567000","8568300"," I love you and I love you and I love you."
"8571520","8572720"," Yeah, yeah, you're a good boy. "
"8578130","8579730"," Yeah, we're going to squeeze here."
"8592260","8593160"," No, no, no, no."
"8594700","8596620"," Not the highest we've ever been valued. "
"8596820","8600060"," The devaluation of the dollar has continued for all of these years."
"8601440","8603220"," You used to be able to buy a hamburger."
"8603760","8610480"," The devaluation of the dollar, dollar becoming worthless. "
"8612340","8615080"," You're trying to talk about 19 cent hamburgers."
"8615100","8615900"," You never get in those."
"8616380","8620980"," You never get 19 cent hamburgers ever again, ever, ever again. "
"8623420","8625360"," You're arguing two different things here."
"8625480","8629660"," You're trying to mix two different arguments here."
"8630420","8633860"," If the value of a dollar, I want to talk to you about this real quick. "
"8634140","8635960"," This is something that people get wrong all the time."
"8636820","8646220"," If $1 pays for a hamburger or it costs $3 to pay for a"
"8646220","8649340"," hamburger, it doesn't matter."
"8650720","8652320"," Conceptually, it does not matter. "
"8652320","8657520"," If that dollar is only worth 33 cents, it's still that same dollar."
"8658040","8658740"," Does that make sense?"
"8659520","8664680"," And so as this plane goes higher, it is based upon this fact right here."
"8665260","8672520"," So what you're asking to happen is for a D or a revaluation of the dollar so that hamburgers are"
"8672520","8676080"," now $1 again, right, or 19 cents. "
"8676080","8685920"," But we know again, we know that prices have not come back down"
"8685920","8688840"," in 43 years."
"8689620","8690920"," Do you understand that point?"
"8691460","8693940"," You must understand that point."
"8694520","8699140"," If you understand macro reasons why the market continues to go higher. "
"8700260","8704740"," You're arguing a point about inflation, right?"
"8704740","8711020"," And saying, well, you know, if you get inflation down, that line should stop, right?"
"8711520","8714180"," That's the rate of inflation that doesn't stop."
"8714840","8724360"," And those are fundamental tax policies that we have, fundamental liquidity being added to the"
"8724360","8724760"," system."
"8725700","8726420"," Do you understand?"
"8726780","8728020"," Do you get that concept here?"
"8728160","8735080"," That line that's going up since the 1970s and 80s is because your hamburger has continued to climb"
"8735080","8736720"," in price since that time period. "
"8737660","8738940"," Does that make sense to you?"
"8739760","8744500"," So if you bring inflation back in line, right?"
"8744980","8749020"," It's still going up into the right over time."
"8749320","8750460"," Does that make sense to you?"
"8751720","8753480"," Maybe or maybe it doesn't, I don't know."
"8754160","8760240"," So you're asking for something saying we're going to make this more glaring. "
"8760240","8765020"," You're trying to argue that you're going to bring hamburgers back to 19 cents."
"8766020","8771740"," You sound like a crazy person thinking that that is ever going to happen."
"8772060","8773640"," Why do I get to make that statement?"
"8774340","8779600"," Because of the last 43 fucking years that has not happened. "
"8780440","8781760"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"8783020","8783760"," Do you understand?"
"8784500","8788780"," It's like when I was a kid, a dollar went farther."
"8788780","8792300"," If you look at the rent prices, they were lower."
"8792780","8797940"," Now any arguments outside of that like, well, you know, if you still compare the price of a house"
"8797940","8803280"," back in 1978 to a price of house now, I'm still paying more because it's overvalued. "
"8804060","8808980"," It's not relevant to that line that I showed you as it goes up."
"8809420","8811940"," And I want to make this point clear to you."
"8813160","8817000"," If you were correct, they wouldn't have bought that line. "
"8817000","8818060"," Do you understand?"
"8818960","8824600"," You are incorrect because they did buy that line and they're going to buy that fucking line again"
"8824600","8826580"," when we come back down there."
"8827000","8831460"," And you can't argue against it because you've been wrong for 43 years."
"8832120","8832900"," You understand?"
"8833720","8839700"," Only until that line actually breaks and rejects to the downside and you start seeing more rational"
"8839700","8840920"," PE ratios. "
"8841840","8843040"," Are you right?"
"8843640","8845300"," So until that happens, I'm sorry."
"8845300","8846600"," You are wrong."
"8847340","8854280"," And even the argument about the rationale behind PE ratios is argued on social media and in the"
"8854280","8861460"," news saying we can't expect these companies to come back down to a PE ratio of six or eight or"
"8861460","8861800"," nine. "
"8862600","8864360"," Do you understand the point here?"
"8865020","8871240"," So you're arguing that the argument here is that, well, you know, we're paying too much for housing"
"8871240","8872300"," right now."
"8872300","8882220"," If you think that your housing is coming back down to a $400,000 house is going back"
"8882220","8883660"," to $50,000."
"8885760","8888980"," Do you think you're going to still get paid $200,000?"
"8889740","8890580"," Fuck no. "
"8891140","8899060"," You're going to get paid, you know, a $20,000 a year, $30,000 a year."
"8899840","8906140"," And that this goes right back to the arguments of all of these unions asking for $47,000 and $50"
"8906140","8906960"," an hour."
"8907900","8914280"," So when these unions are asking for this kind of money, when you get, when you get a, and they're"
"8914280","8918100"," not going to, they're not going to tell you we have wage growth spiral, but we do. "
"8919100","8924760"," A lot of America is being paid more money and a ton of America is now asking to be paid"
"8924760","8925340"," more money."
"8925860","8932240"," And you're not going to tell me that next year or the year after or five or 10 years from"
"8932240","8940500"," now or 15, if everybody, every entry level workers making 50 bucks an hour and you think that the"
"8940500","8948140"," spooze is coming down below 350 while they're making 150 or 200,000 a year, an entry level worker"
"8948140","8952940"," and that spooze will be lower because you want a PE ratio of six, eight or 10."
"8952940","8957520"," You're out of your fucking mind, like straight out of your mind. "
"8958000","8960140"," So the numbers disagree with you."
"8960440","8962220"," Now, I will agree with you."
"8962540","8968700"," If you saw a fundamental shift in our politics or our policy, but these companies and these"
"8968700","8973060"," workers, they're very smart and they see what's down the road. "
"8973620","8974820"," They know what's coming."
"8975380","8976600"," Do you know what you want to know what's coming?"
"8977520","8980200"," Your rent is going to be five to $10,000."
"8980860","8982120"," That's what's going to happen. "
"8982780","8988800"," And when you see a four PE ratio of Apple, you know, that's now going to be like 20 or"
"8988800","8989140"," something."
"8989320","8992880"," That's going to be a low, believe it or not, 18, 14."
"8993460","8994980"," We just had 14 and 12, right?"
"8995340","9002740"," In 10, 15 years, your PE ratios will then be 14 to 15, 16, 18, anything like that. "
"9004700","9006680"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"9007680","9011640"," So we're looking at an absolute price on Apple going, well, Apple's too high."
"9012340","9013440"," Too high right now."
"9014480","9023200"," But Apple won't be value, an Apple at $200 today won't be an Apple at $200 in five years, will"
"9023200","9023420"," it?"
"9024280","9026020"," It'll be two different $200, right?"
"9027040","9029080"," That's what we're doing trying to try to escape this, right?"
"9029320","9034180"," We're trying to make money to preserve the money that we have, right?"
"9034180","9036600"," So if I have half a million dollars, right?"
"9037360","9039640"," What is that half million dollars worth in five years?"
"9040340","9042460"," What's that half million dollars worth in five years?"
"9043200","9043720"," Tell me. "
"9045500","9050200"," You're telling me that the stock market's going to give me a fucking discount on spy in five years?"
"9051080","9057220"," You're telling me I'm going to be able to buy spy in five years at 1600 or 2400?"
"9059060","9060320"," That sounds insane."
"9061560","9063420"," Absolutely insane even think that."
"9064460","9066460"," Nothing is saying that's going to happen. "
"9068860","9071140"," You're watching the devaluation of our currency."
"9071620","9073680"," You're watching a Japanese moment happen here."
"9074320","9076140"," You're in the early stages of Japan. "
"9077880","9079400"," That's what that's where we are."
"9080100","9081000"," I'll be honest with you."
"9082140","9083980"," When the dollar is like a quarter. "
"9086840","9087880"," You get what I'm saying?"
"9087880","9091240"," So you're trying to outrun all of that."
"9091540","9093700"," And then meanwhile you've got people saying in the background."
"9096240","9099540"," You know, it's going to go to the depths of hell and truth is it just hasn't. "
"9099940","9101140"," You're going to keep buying that."
"9101260","9105000"," It's going to keep going up and keep going up until they do something fundamentally different."
"9106420","9109820"," Normally, I don't want to say what that is, but it's normally a war. "
"9111000","9112760"," It's more like a world war three, a big one."
"9113720","9115240"," Everybody's everybody's getting in on it."
"9117260","9119160"," A major depression. "
"9119780","9125080"," Like major, like a war inducing depression for a world leader."
"9125880","9127500"," Outside of something like that."
"9128360","9129420"," It's that way, man. "
"9130040","9131380"," It's definitely not that way."
"9135190","9136510"," I am afterwards."
"9136990","9140230"," I'm expecting that long period and about 10 to 15 years. "
"9141090","9141770"," Absolutely."
"9142930","9144550"," I'm trying to be conservative on that aspect."
"9144810","9145750"," It could last 20 years. "
"9146890","9149950"," This next cycle could be about a 10 to 15 year cycle."
"9151190","9152510"," High end would be 20 years."
"9153470","9154550"," And it's going to be disgusting. "
"9157050","9158250"," The writing's on the wall."
"9158550","9160030"," I don't know what more you need to hear."
"9160290","9162070"," I don't know what if you're out there watching right now. "
"9162310","9165710"," I have no fucking idea what you need to hear from me at this point."
"9166230","9170270"," When you find out that right now when I hire a labor, it's 30 bucks."
"9170750","9172050"," It's no longer 20 cash. "
"9172330","9172670"," It's 30."
"9172670","9178290"," And that's your like, that's like the guy that's shit face coming to work or has a closet fucking"
"9178290","9181730"," pill problem or smokes crack at night time when you pay me disappears."
"9182490","9184730"," That worker is asking me for 30 bucks an hour. "
"9185270","9190850"," That guy is asking me for 30 an hour, not 20, not 15, not 10 cash, 30 bucks."
"9191410","9193530"," And I, and I honestly can't say no to it."
"9194590","9195690"," What was that guy going to do?"
"9195810","9199970"," Well, fucking work for me for a day and not be able to afford to go to McDonald's with his"
"9199970","9202290"," two kids or his four kids. "
"9203010","9209590"," I mean, he probably doesn't have his kids if he's doing that shit, but paying child support."
"9210810","9216150"," You know, like, like how do you, like, so when you're looking down the pike, like outside of the"
"9216150","9217670"," microscope of a one minute chart."
"9218590","9221070"," When you're looking five, 10, 15 years down the road. "
"9222230","9226590"," Even this, even this PE ratio chart is it's screaming at you."
"9227630","9229730"," It's literally screaming at you saying."
"9230470","9232230"," We're going up and to the right. "
"9232590","9233950"," The greed has not ended."
"9234610","9236070"," They're lying to you."
"9238450","9239030"," You understand?"
"9240010","9244670"," So, and like they play all these arguments about like inflation and get this under control and get"
"9244670","9245550"," that under control. "
"9246130","9247370"," They ain't getting shit under control."
"9248330","9249950"," They ain't getting nothing under control."
"9250710","9254310"," They're going to do it long enough and keep doing their operations and all this other shit until"
"9254310","9261150"," I've said this before. "
"9261150","9262150"," Those higher prices."
"9264210","9266890"," Until it becomes normal for you to pay more."
"9269010","9269330"," Right. "
"9269970","9274170"," And if you're young watching me right now, if you're 25 or younger."
"9275290","9276670"," You mark my words."
"9278210","9282170"," Anything that seems expensive to you right now, you're going to look back in 20 years and go. "
"9282670","9284070"," That wasn't expensive at all."
"9285530","9286050"," Right."
"9286330","9288090"," You'll start to talk about wage stagnation. "
"9289090","9292730"," Twenty years, you're going to say, well, wages are stagnating right now."
"9292910","9293550"," We need more money."
"9294410","9296570"," And you're going to remember this side part of the cycle. "
"9296790","9298430"," You'll be like, oh shit, here we go again."
"9299790","9302630"," We're going to go from $50 an hour to 75 and 80."
"9302850","9303130"," Why are these?"
"9303250","9305470"," Why are these young kids asking for 80 an hour?"
"9306430","9307550"," $100 an hour. "
"9308170","9310550"," When I was a kid, I thought 40 to 50 was outrageous."
"9311650","9312250"," You get what I'm saying?"
"9323920","9326480"," The devaluation due to the dollar is a real fucking thing."
"9326640","9327260"," It's not a joke. "
"9327500","9328920"," It is a real, real thing."
"9329100","9331160"," The devaluation of everything is a real, real deal."
"9331440","9332460"," It's not a joke. "
"9334340","9335120"," It's not a joke."
"9335260","9338360"," And it hasn't been a joke since it's basically what happened."
"9338360","9343000"," Basically what happened was we had a big problem in the, I think it was 65. "
"9344200","9344500"," 1965."
"9345240","9345580"," That could be wrong."
"9345780","9346760"," Don't quote me on these years. "
"9348880","9353120"," In 1965, up until about 1965, rich people, this isn't political."
"9353780","9354180"," This is real."
"9355200","9360500"," Rich people basically paid for our taxes. "
"9361740","9364000"," We did have a tax rate that would come off every war."
"9364460","9366140"," They did leave it on after World War II."
"9366880","9367900"," Did you guys know that?"
"9368080","9369400"," Like our income tax would go only. "
"9369500","9371140"," We only had an income tax during times of war."
"9371700","9374180"," But then we had some structural changes to our tax code."
"9374180","9378080"," And we had another structural change to our tax code with Reagan. "
"9378720","9380980"," Whether that was good or bad doesn't matter."
"9381080","9383260"," I'm not here to argue the good or bad of the politics of it."
"9384020","9385900"," But it was making wealthier people wealthier. "
"9386940","9388780"," That's the simple version that I can give to you."
"9390140","9394840"," And in fact, making you poorer over time, right?"
"9395700","9396380"," Concentrating wealth."
"9397080","9397940"," Concentrating wealth. "
"9398200","9399660"," Until right now, what are we left with?"
"9400420","9402320"," Very wealthy individuals, right?"
"9402880","9404100"," Extremely wealthy individuals."
"9405200","9407400"," And you guys are kind of left behind in that pack."
"9408040","9411960"," You can see the direct result of that right inside the PE ratio, believe it or not. "
"9411960","9414880"," The direct results of those policies."
"9415160","9419360"," Now you have to ask yourself, are they willing to roll those policies back?"
"9420380","9422580"," How do you get them to roll those policies back?"
"9422980","9427640"," The only way that that happens, right, is like some fundamental change."
"9428460","9430220"," How do you get a fundamental change?"
"9430220","9433640"," You might be young now thinking that your generation will be that change. "
"9434300","9435520"," It likely won't."
"9435960","9441260"," You likely need an internal conflict within the country."
"9441860","9444320"," Like a civil war in the United States, believe it or not. "
"9444760","9448000"," Or you're so poor that you can't even feed yourself."
"9448900","9450460"," That's the beginnings of that are depression."
"9451600","9456020"," Then you'd have mass rioting, real mass problems, right?"
"9456500","9461040"," And that would be, but your generation would be the first and you'd be scarred by it. "
"9461460","9462820"," You'd be a lost generation."
"9463840","9466380"," The other thing that I couldn't tell would be a world war."
"9467060","9469180"," And that would be another lost generation. "
"9470280","9473240"," That greatest generation was also a lost generation."
"9474060","9478820"," They came back from war and they were like, we're going to do this, all this stuff in the United"
"9478820","9480860"," States because it's the right thing to do."
"9481720","9483880"," We don't have that class yet. "
"9483880","9490240"," We don't have that young, young generation where a third of your people got maimed."
"9490440","9491320"," They're just gone."
"9492080","9495600"," They're either maimed, wounded, hurt, gone. "
"9495880","9499780"," Like a fundamental like bombshell to your generation."
"9500200","9501160"," That has not happened."
"9502100","9502660"," Right. "
"9503000","9508560"," So, so what happens when you don't have that as you have greed, you have your generation right now."
"9508620","9509740"," They're like, oh, I'm for it."
"9510180","9512580"," But just like the hippies and the yuppies, right?"
"9512580","9517080"," We're for all this change, but as they get older, they get greedier and greedier and greedier. "
"9517500","9520420"," The greed sets in and the greed continues higher."
"9521360","9527720"," And you're going to expect that out of every one of these future generations to be the same way."
"9528120","9533280"," So if you're 18 right now and you're watching my show, right, I expect your generation, unless"
"9533280","9535380"," something really bad happens, not COVID. "
"9536000","9538260"," Really bad happens to your generation."
"9538260","9544020"," I see your generation just becoming just as greedy as the older generation from you."
"9544700","9548540"," It's horrible to say, but I've been right for 43 years. "
"9549040","9553580"," So until that, until some fundamentally changes, I expect it to continue."
"9560940","9562060"," Yeah, it's gross."
"9562540","9570680"," Now, whether you like that or not or whether you think in your mind, a reckoning is coming, that"
"9570680","9571700"," will be the case eventually. "
"9572820","9575700"," You need to have a young generation basically unemployed."
"9576820","9578520"," You need a young generation with no money."
"9579280","9584160"," You need a, I don't mean living at your mom's basement or rent, like scraping by. "
"9585380","9589960"," I mean, like you could work three jobs and not have enough money."
"9590640","9592900"," Like there's no jobs for you."
"9593660","9596120"," Like you're living literally on a street corner. "
"9596120","9602200"," And I mean, you like the normal people, not the people that are ship bags, the normal people, when"
"9602200","9605420"," those people have nothing, that's the only chance you'll see."
"9605760","9608900"," There are one of a few ways for that change to happen."
"9609640","9614980"," That like, like that, that generational, like we're going to do the right thing here. "
"9615280","9616540"," So you're not going to see that."
"9616980","9618420"," It's really fucked up."
"9618920","9623500"," And even on that same topic, how do you get those people to be that poor?"
"9624360","9624760"," How?"
"9625600","9627540"," The devaluation of the dollar, right?"
"9628340","9630280"," You devalue the dollar where it's worthless. "
"9631840","9632740"," That's how you do it."
"9632920","9633940"," It's one of the ways that you do it."
"9640790","9641910"," No, I'm not quite. "
"9642630","9644230"," I think China is still an emergent."
"9644650","9647050"," Well, there's, I don't know, I'm iffy on this."
"9647310","9651830"," China has a growth problem with, with people in my view. "
"9652710","9655230"," They need to, they need more babies, whole time more babies."
"9659150","9661210"," They're a maturing society as well."
"9661430","9663030"," They've got more middle class than they ever had. "
"9663950","9666670"," And I would suspect Africa to pick up the slack."
"9667010","9668730"," It's like maybe you're like pointing the finger at China."
"9669590","9676350"," But I think that China will become our Africa will become that next emerging bottom of the barrel"
"9676350","9676790"," society. "
"9677170","9683750"," They'll replace China and become that, that, that, that country that does what China did for us."
"9684630","9687470"," So I think like the collapse of China is the doom."
"9687810","9690590"," No, I think that Africa is the place. "
"9690970","9693710"," I think Africa is the place that will provide those goods and services."
"9695270","9696290"," Extremely cheap prices."
"9696770","9698070"," I think there's a reprieve. "
"9698610","9704350"," Sorry to say that, but not that it should be that, but that's probably most likely the outcome in"
"9704350","9705130"," 10 to 20 years."
"9706410","9707730"," Africa will fill that gap."
"9714390","9716930"," No, I don't see a range brown repound right now. "
"9717310","9723230"," I think, I think, I think you, I think, unless we fail, we have some like major failure at 443."
"9725350","9726250"," For this year."
"9727810","9729270"," For this year, I think. "
"9731210","9736450"," I think it's a, I think like, so if you look back on historically, if you look back."
"9737910","9742330"," To fail for us to fail to get the, the high this year."
"9743530","9745090"," For us to fail to get like 470. "
"9745890","9746290"," Hold on."
"9746390","9747010"," Hold on a second."
"9747110","9749630"," Let me go back here and look at a quick second here. "
"9750090","9751670"," We check the exact."
"9752610","9753530"," One quick second here."
"9753750","9754350"," 30 minute chart. "
"9762120","9763540"," No, not in a 30 minute here."
"9769860","9771340"," Let's go back and look at this."
"9777610","9778130"," Historically. "
"9787980","9788920"," Change that."
"9789360","9790740"," The one day right there."
"9794400","9796060"," So this is the S&P 500. "
"9796320","9796820"," This is spy."
"9797000","9799180"," It doesn't matter if it's SPX ES doesn't matter."
"9799740","9801100"," What does matter is this. "
"9802240","9805220"," This is the previous high back here in 2022."
"9805220","9805620"," Okay."
"9809700","9811400"," The number of times. "
"9819140","9824880"," The number of times that we fail to at least get the new high."
"9825500","9828180"," Is very low, extremely low."
"9829300","9830260"," To find a new low. "
"9831120","9832920"," It's like go down here and find a new low."
"9834040","9834440"," Very rare."
"9834700","9836900"," It's like, you can count it on two hands. "
"9837800","9838400"," Now."
"9839900","9841720"," The number of times that we."
"9843560","9846000"," Come up here and never look back. "
"9847380","9848840"," We have thousands."
"9849440","9851940"," I mean like tens of thousands of examples."
"9853240","9854740"," Of continuing higher. "
"9856920","9860680"," The number of times that we come up here and get the new high and then roll over."
"9861320","9862740"," That's pretty good chance."
"9864120","9866000"," Pretty fair chance of that happening. "
"9866600","9867280"," So."
"9868440","9871100"," What are the chances that this is the top."
"9872040","9873140"," Very low. "
"9874320","9877400"," Like a point zero zero five percent chance."
"9877780","9879960"," That low it's actually that low."
"9880060","9882640"," It's like extremely low that that is the actual top. "
"9884940","9886220"," Coming up here."
"9887580","9890780"," Is about and then and then rolling down."
"9891540","9893700"," That's about 30% of the time. "
"9895040","9900200"," About 30% of the time and I mean like a new low below 3500 testing 3500."
"9900900","9903560"," I'm going to give this like the best chance of happening."
"9904740","9906560"," And this is the most bearish. "
"9907560","9908120"," Viewpoint."
"9909080","9911480"," This is the collapse bear viewpoint."
"9911780","9914600"," This is the one in a million shot here. "
"9915060","9918080"," This is the most likely bearish scenario."
"9919280","9922840"," This one up here we go down and actually continue higher."
"9923880","9926540"," It's like 4800 right here. "
"9927360","9930700"," Tag that one before a roll over and not seeing."
"9931620","9937300"," 3500 on that roll like hitting 4800 rolling over and not ever seeing that 3500 ever again."
"9938120","9940480"," The most probable outcome. "
"9941320","9944120"," That is literally the most probable outcome."
"9944120","9948920"," And the stuff that I've already shown you here today."
"9949280","9950380"," What does it say to you. "
"9950820","9952500"," Say to you."
"9952540","9954740"," We're probably at the top."
"9955780","9958180"," And we're probably not going to even get a new high. "
"9959400","9959880"," No."
"9960220","9963260"," Now is there a role over there up here where we are right now?"
"9963460","9963660"," Yes."
"9964820","9966960"," Will these sellers be right?"
"9967680","9967880"," Yes. "
"9969060","9970720"," Between now and February they will."
"9971540","9973700"," So do they care right now about all this stuff?"
"9973900","9974300"," Probably not."
"9975200","9977200"," Do they care when that roll comes?"
"9977520","9978080"," Probably not. "
"9978580","9980440"," Do they care if it comes right now?"
"9980720","9982540"," Do they care if it comes at 4720?"
"9983460","9983960"," 4800?"
"9984260","9984860"," Probably not."
"9985720","9987100"," They probably don't care."
"9987860","9993700"," They put the short on for next year by sometime in spring sometime in late winter. "
"9994120","9995700"," You'll probably get a pretty decent rule."
"9996460","9998260"," So it's like hand grenades."
"9999060","10001000"," Now here's the fascinating part of that statement. "
"10002140","10003420"," Where is that low?"
"10004120","10005040"," Is that low?"
"10005980","10006400"," 4000?"
"10007260","10008760"," Is it 3800?"
"10008960","10010020"," Is it 3500?"
"10010640","10015060"," Or is it the Mike Barry fraud case where we go way lower than 3500?"
"10015200","10020680"," We tagged, you know, 32, 28, 26, 16, something like that."
"10021900","10025620"," You're not going to get that unless there's literal fraud."
"10025620","10026280"," That's it. "
"10026540","10028000"," That's discovered."
"10028940","10030460"," Literal fraud that's discovered."
"10031400","10038980"," You're not going to get that unless you get a fundamental change to the policy making in our"
"10038980","10039440"," country. "
"10039860","10041380"," And how do I back that up?"
"10041780","10042180"," 1980."
"10043580","10045440"," 1980 is how I back that up."
"10046040","10050920"," And the greatest trick that's being pulled on you right now is the fed buying time. "
"10050920","10060320"," The more time they buy, even if that happens, even if that fraud happens as time passes, the"
"10060320","10063560"," stretch goes higher."
"10064320","10066240"," So you start to revert back down."
"10066940","10074340"," That bottom target that was once at 1600 is then at 2000, then at 26, then at 35. "
"10075720","10078540"," You can get them saying like the absolute rock bottom of the market."
"10078540","10082020"," Every day that passes moves higher."
"10083280","10086200"," Always has since 1894. "
"10087260","10089560"," 1890 fucking four."
"10090260","10094620"," That absolute bottom is moved higher and just marched along and marched along."
"10095140","10096040"," Not 1980. "
"10097320","10098280"," 1894."
"10102870","10103350"," Yeah."
"10111720","10113780"," So it's the greatest trick they're pulling. "
"10113980","10117460"," If there was one trick that the fed is pulling right now, the biggest one."
"10118140","10119400"," The one that's shocking me."
"10119700","10121520"," It's the buying time trick. "
"10122380","10123700"," Hats off to them."
"10124800","10126260"," Absolute hats off to them."
"10126320","10128080"," I got a lot of respect for that. "
"10128180","10129520"," I did not see that coming."
"10130760","10131860"," And one other."
"10132360","10136340"," One other major policy shift thing that I'm impressed with. "
"10138220","10142580"," Is not pulling the surprises out of the hat like they once did."
"10143200","10146880"," Them giving you for warning and fair warning has softened."
"10147160","10148640"," A lot of this stuff. "
"10150440","10153340"," If you're a bull and."
"10154180","10159060"," If you're a young bull, you should count yourself lucky."
"10160940","10161280"," That's. "
"10165460","10168280"," The fed has been pre telegraphing."
"10168860","10169760"," What to expect."
"10171420","10172520"," We had a."
"10174460","10175180"," Organize. "
"10176140","10177520"," Non chaotic."
"10179360","10180700"," Dismantling of the market."
"10181820","10183760"," Underneath the sectors underneath the market. "
"10184180","10186520"," That started in December of 2020."
"10187920","10190320"," And it has been an orderly fashion."
"10190320","10193300"," We've come down and we've bought time. "
"10193760","10195960"," We've done all kinds of stuff."
"10196720","10198100"," To soften the blow."
"10199200","10201720"," Of what 2022 could have been. "
"10202280","10204040"," Had they not dismantled."
"10205080","10208980"," Spec growth in 2020 in December of 2020 through to 2022."
"10209360","10212140"," It would have been a brutal crash. "
"10213940","10215240"," Absolutely brutal."
"10215880","10217740"," And they did it nicely."
"10218920","10221680"," It's the it's the greatest trick they pulled on. "
"10221940","10222840"," Collapse bears."
"10223540","10225060"," Collapse bears are."
"10225740","10227280"," It's not like it once was. "
"10228020","10229420"," They can still survive."
"10229940","10233280"," But for wherever these operations have been since they started."
"10233580","10236020"," Like fascinated by the fed. "
"10237060","10237960"," Pre telegraphing."
"10238380","10238940"," What to expect."
"10241440","10245660"," Could be because of change the dynamic of our market my viewpoint with doing that stuff. "
"10247260","10248520"," Become more orderly."
"10255700","10256700"," I mean we'll check."
"10257000","10257440"," We'll go back. "
"10257580","10260580"," We'll go back and look when that ratio rolls back down again."
"10262100","10263740"," We'll see that same arguments."
"10264800","10265080"," Right. "
"10265320","10266600"," We'll see them saying hey."
"10267040","10269800"," Pe ratios are coming down to 16 right now."
"10270500","10272320"," And I've been in the market for 10 years. "
"10273340","10274660"," And I know that."
"10275120","10279220"," I know that they were arguing that the ratio of 12 and 14 was too high."
"10279760","10281840"," That it was better to buy a 10 or 12. "
"10282400","10283540"," Right now we're at 16."
"10285680","10287240"," It's got to keep going down right."
"10288060","10290680"," And so you're going to be sitting there short and they guess they're going to be doing. "
"10290800","10291600"," They'll be buying that 16."
"10292200","10293060"," That's what they're going to do."
"10293120","10294000"," They're going to buy that fucking 16. "
"10294500","10295820"," It'll be like 80 years old."
"10296720","10299440"," Like all these now these old fat greasy hair men are going to be like."
"10300400","10302360"," 80 year olds going to be like Buffett. "
"10303440","10306660"," They're just going to buy that shit and you're going to be like God damn it."
"10306760","10307500"," They bought 16."
"10309240","10313180"," You're going to have another excuse for why it's not going down. "
"10323710","10325050"," Well, Mr. talking monkey."
"10325350","10326030"," I agreed with you."
"10326630","10328650"," I don't disagree with this fraud going on. "
"10329470","10331570"," I don't disagree with this fraud going on."
"10331570","10332290"," I know there's fraud."
"10332470","10334090"," You and I both know this fraud going on. "
"10334270","10338350"," When we all know Jimmy Barry knows everybody here knows this fraud going on."
"10338950","10340590"," What was the key thing that I said?"
"10341950","10347270"," Unless fraud is uncovered on a mass scale uncovered right has to be uncovered."
"10348190","10351870"," Unless it is uncovered unless the buyers don't show up. "
"10351910","10352990"," Mike Barry made a great point."
"10353770","10356410"," He said congratulations retailers you bought the dip."
"10357210","10357810"," Right?"
"10358350","10363970"," Unless something's uncovered to sway that everybody knows there's a fraud. "
"10364870","10365390"," Right?"
"10365750","10368430"," People are losing their houses losing their mortgages due to a fraud."
"10368610","10369190"," Something like that."
"10369770","10372290"," The fraud continues on doesn't it?"
"10372890","10373590"," Fucking gross. "
"10381090","10383590"," Look at that nice squeeze right here baby."
"10383930","10384610"," Squeeze it up there."
"10385450","10386730"," Slap the shit out of that. "
"10388870","10390790"," New high on spoos right now."
"10391190","10392890"," New high on spoos."
"10393310","10394130"," We got the new high. "
"10395110","10395590"," Yippee."
"10395970","10396910"," Let's take a peek at it."
"10397170","10398170"," Oh, look at that. "
"10398490","10398890"," New high."
"10400010","10400290"," Right there."
"10400510","10401510"," There's your yellow line. "
"10401690","10402570"," There's your new high."
"10403090","10403630"," We got it."
"10404730","10405390"," Good job. "
"10406890","10407610"," Whoo."
"10412910","10414030"," Next target."
"10414450","10414930"," 452. "
"10416230","10417430"," 49 to the upside."
"10425340","10427380"," I would say one thing to you."
"10428260","10430020"," Vix is starting to bottom. "
"10430480","10431580"," I would take pause here."
"10437100","10442520"," Vix can trade $13.71. But it is bottoming right here."
"10442800","10442920"," So. "
"10443900","10445440"," Careful of getting trapped in here."
"10445740","10446380"," If you're a bull."
"10448540","10453240"," We also have a NASDAQ trying to close. "
"10454300","10458080"," If you pay close attention to the hourly on NDX."
"10459400","10463280"," You'll see a giant gap that needs to be closed right now."
"10464220","10467320"," We're looking for a major squeeze to happen here. "
"10468960","10470400"," You can see it right here."
"10471580","10474080"," If you check NDX on hourly chart."
"10475040","10476320"," I'm going to show it to you right now here. "
"10476380","10476900"," I'll just bring it up."
"10481930","10482870"," Here's NDX."
"10483570","10485990"," Here's a one hour chart on NASDAQ. "
"10490610","10492070"," We will full chart."
"10493410","10497490"," Spy right now testing for a second time."
"10498750","10502290"," To rip some faces off here to the upside. "
"10503870","10507710"," Up here testing and one more time trying to rip faces off."
"10508410","10511170"," I want you to know that if there is a rejection here."
"10511710","10515570"," We are going to blast down to the depths of health. "
"10520810","10522630"," This is NASDAQ right here."
"10523790","10526630"," And I want to discuss this with you briefly."
"10534910","10537750"," So do you see how we're like banging on the door here light?"
"10537970","10539270"," Like let me in, right?"
"10539510","10542550"," Let me in so we can squeeze this bad boy up, right?"
"10543730","10546070"," Let me in so we can squeeze. "
"10547310","10548610"," And where are we squeezing?"
"10549410","10550610"," You see it right here?"
"10553610","10555410"," Pull a lot of bullshit in there."
"10556450","10560510"," And that squeezes us straight up to 454, right?"
"10560750","10561130"," You see it?"
"10562050","10563330"," Straight up to 454."
"10563810","10564830"," So how do you trade that?"
"10566930","10569270"," So we're going to go back to a one minute chart here. "
"10569410","10569570"," Okay."
"10570310","10571350"," How do you trade that?"
"10572990","10575390"," This is the squeeze zone here, right?"
"10576470","10578130"," Big old squeeze zone, right?"
"10580310","10586210"," I'm going to first warn you, if this works and we begin to squeeze, you are going to see a"
"10586210","10589110"," violent rejection up here."
"10590110","10590150"," Violent. "
"10591030","10594910"," Even if it comes back up, you're going to see a violent rejection here."
"10595290","10595910"," Guarantee it."
"10596350","10599830"," 100% guaranteed violent rejection up here. "
"10600110","10604350"," If we start to go up, if you're a bull and you're like, I want to trade this cap so"
"10604350","10604650"," bad."
"10605190","10606610"," Oh, cap, I want to trade this so bad."
"10606610","10609070"," I'm going to tell you two things about this. "
"10611310","10618050"," The first is your best bet is always to attack this from lower."
"10618790","10619970"," Somewhere down in here."
"10620550","10621990"," Be long from down here. "
"10622950","10623950"," You got what I'm saying?"
"10624170","10628150"," Always be long from down here so that you don't have to worry about a rejection here, right?"
"10628430","10629470"," Because you're already long down here."
"10630410","10636670"," You don't actually have to be fearful of this because if this, if this five minute trend breaks,"
"10636750","10639090"," you know that you can't be long any longer, right?"
"10639630","10645230"," So you know if you're a bull right now that you can be long for this trade higher."
"10646170","10662650"," You also know that if you break below 450, you can no longer be long for this trade higher, right?"
"10662650","10669470"," You know that you want to sell this and you know that you want to sell this, right?"
"10670250","10676750"," And you know that you want to break up 450 for continuation to the downside, right?"
"10677490","10678190"," Right there. "
"10678330","10679010"," You know that, right?"
"10679250","10679670"," I know that."
"10679910","10680390"," You know that."
"10680770","10683130"," You may be like, hey, Cap, but where are we going here, right?"
"10683790","10684790"," Where are we going, Cap?"
"10686330","10688930"," I already told you we're going into Friday, right?"
"10689330","10690290"," Give you a target up here. "
"10691070","10692290"," We're already there, right?"
"10692290","10693350"," 450 to 453."
"10694490","10696190"," I think I said 450 to 30."
"10696590","10697570"," We're already there, right?"
"10697670","10698710"," We're already trying to get up there. "
"10699550","10701090"," So we've got Monday."
"10701430","10702310"," Matter of fact, here it is."
"10702530","10702830"," It's right here. "
"10702890","10703350"," Here's the box."
"10704130","10705370"," We're already there, right?"
"10707250","10709470"," That's our Friday box right there already there."
"10709670","10712050"," So if you're a bull, what are you looking for?"
"10712570","10714810"," Likely to be buying all this crap in here, right?"
"10716350","10718810"," Likely buying all this crap right here, right?"
"10718990","10720210"," So you're long from right here. "
"10720210","10721790"," You're long from right here."
"10722410","10723850"," And your target, you've already hit."
"10724050","10730550"," And your next target above is now 454, right?"
"10730690","10736550"," Your next target by weekend is right here. "
"10744970","10746090"," It's now higher."
"10748030","10752830"," So if you're a bull, best bet is right here, right?"
"10754190","10755990"," Best bet is right here, right?"
"10756650","10765910"," If at any point we break trend on a 5-minute chart, you know to cut your longs and re "
"10765910","10766790","-enter down below."
"10767410","10772690"," As of right now, we're along this market right now, right?"
"10774330","10776450"," On this white line right here. "
"10776590","10777570"," So you see this white line?"
"10778530","10779850"," Watch this white line right here."
"10780670","10782710"," As long as we don't get closing bars."
"10785490","10787490"," Below this white line, right?"
"10789230","10791290"," We're actually buying the dip here. "
"10791570","10793010"," So you're going to buy the dip right here."
"10793630","10794490"," Any touch?"
"10797770","10800330"," Buy the dip to go higher and close the gap."
"10800690","10804530"," If there's a failure, you know where to make to cut your losses, right?"
"10805290","10812690"," If we fail on this 450-90, I said 450, but it's 450-90, if we fail this 450-90,"
"10812830","10813330"," what are you doing?"
"10814070","10815970"," You've got two entries down below. "
"10819680","10821880"," We'll just write the gray love, baby."
"10823760","10824800"," Gray love."
"10832470","10835010"," You know where your next place is right here, right?"
"10835570","10842990"," If you think there's more resistance here, if you don't think we can break above here without some"
"10842990","10848790"," help, if you're like, we're not going to break through this without some help, then you know that"
"10848790","10850530"," this needs to come up, doesn't it?"
"10852070","10854790"," And this is going to need to come up, isn't it?"
"10857050","10857490"," Right?"
"10858290","10867170"," And give some help to push us up and through these people, right?"
"10868970","10871650"," So let's take a look at the trigger screener here. "
"10871650","10876570"," And let's see what we've got going on here."
"10877090","10878030"," So trigger screener."
"10881670","10884350"," Trigger screener right here, we've got a lot of push here, right?"
"10884710","10886570"," A lot of buyers here, right?"
"10886790","10887150"," Look at them. "
"10887650","10890130"," Buyers, buyers, buyers, pants on fires."
"10891630","10895870"," We've got this resistance right here, because they don't want this to squeeze, right?"
"10896350","10897670"," They're like, fuck you, we're not squeezing."
"10899410","10900830"," Look at them over here. "
"10903610","10906670"," They're like, you're not squeezing, right?"
"10907450","10909410"," I called these liars yesterday, right?"
"10909650","10910810"," So what do we need to get up there?"
"10910950","10919210"," We probably need all of this momentum to come up and slam it up higher, right?"
"10923920","10924520"," You see that?"
"10925220","10925940"," Slam it up higher."
"10926640","10928580"," I can show you two previous examples of that."
"10928580","10932240"," One, two, and three, with the extension to the upside. "
"10934080","10939660"," But just a matter of time right now to get that squeeze to squeeze iron."
"10940240","10942280"," It's just a matter of time."
"10946960","10951500"," So five minute chart, we're trading above the five minute right now. "
"10952340","10952820"," Still bullish."
"10954200","10962080"," One way or another, unless we break hourly or gray love trend or daily trend, we are going to the"
"10962080","10962860"," fucking moon."
"10988970","10997050"," If you're looking to buy this here and you're panicking, you can always wait for the squeeze back"
"10997050","11000530"," in that white line to come up to carry you to home up here. "
"11001450","11007030"," You can always long this right here and put stops below."
"11007030","11010210"," Look at this ST OPS."
"11012490","11014810"," That way you're licking your, you're licking your wounds. "
"11015250","11017850"," You can even buy a monthly call here, weekly call."
"11018610","11022510"," And if it begins to roll down on you, you're not going to take too much of a pain, right?"
"11023230","11024330"," Won't take a ton of pain."
"11025510","11027530"," And then you stop out right there. "
"11027670","11028590"," We start going down."
"11029370","11032270"," Now you're not going to get paid unless we go up here, right?"
"11032450","11037110"," You can't close those monthly calls out unless we go up there to four, fifty four and change."
"11045120","11047280"," So I'm going to draw a little box right here. "
"11054580","11056700"," Can't be below that little box right there."
"11059100","11062580"," So right here, we'll change the color, make it red."
"11071200","11072980"," Doom below that red box. "
"11087870","11090370"," I'm going to read some stuff to you right now."
"11092370","11097370"," The Fed ramps up demands for corrective actions by regional banks."
"11098830","11104150"," As part of a stepped up attempt to tighten oversight following three banks' collapses earlier this"
"11104150","11104410"," year. "
"11105190","11111550"," U.S. authorities are subtly requesting that regional lenders strengthen their liquidity strategy."
"11111930","11115590"," According to those knowledge of the situation, the Fed Reserve has privately warmed a number of"
"11115590","11115930"," lenders."
"11117190","11120350"," With assets between one hundred and two hundred billion dollars, including citizens financial"
"11120350","11121110"," group. "
"11121850","11127950"," Fifth, Third Bank Corp and M&T bank the individuals who asked not to be identified because the"
"11127950","11129090"," conversations involved."
"11129650","11134710"," Secret supervisory materials said wide ranging letters covered everything from lenders capital and"
"11134710","11134890"," liquidity."
"11135710","11137730"," To their technology and compliance. "
"11138690","11140530"," It's kind of a neat little headline there."
"11142310","11145650"," It's neat that it's being leaked right now."
"11146430","11151090"," I'm assuming that someone's short and does not want or just to us to squeeze here. "
"11162400","11165220"," Someone's like leak this ship to the press right now stat."
"11170960","11172260"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"11172560","11176860"," What do you guys think about the TLT trade?"
"11178000","11181120"," You guys think that pays off in a spring and summer?"
"11205130","11206990"," Let me ask you another question too. "
"11210090","11219670"," Do you think do you think that do you think I'm being risky leaving my U.S. all U.S."
"11219670","11223650"," so calls on for 75 bucks."
"11224330","11229230"," Got a nice bounce on our early trend this morning on U.S. so let me switch over that real"
"11229230","11229490"," quick."
"11234840","11236880"," So I'm a buyer down here. "
"11240360","11246860"," I bought that right there with you on stream and way back down here slingshadow way back up"
"11246860","11248560"," slingshadow way back up."
"11249480","11251200"," Resting bitch face right here."
"11251200","11257560"," My target is right up here. "
"11259520","11261480"," I don't want that one last push."
"11262480","11271300"," I can't decide if I wait for the hurricane stuff or if I just exit before before like a wet"
"11271300","11272760"," but not Wednesday before like Friday."
"11273400","11275460"," Thursday Friday before the damages come out. "
"11276740","11278500"," Do you think I just stay long here?"
"11278660","11281740"," Do you think I just take the money and run a best like best case scenario."
"11282480","11283400"," The next rip."
"11285900","11291060"," I think I caught if we get anything lower than this closing but I don't know if I want to"
"11291060","11292220"," deal with that bullshit again. "
"11292780","11296300"," Kind of at the halfway point right now."
"11315790","11317710"," Yeah, I don't think it's an event either."
"11317990","11322250"," I think it's a I think it's an idea that so I'm trying I think we describe this. "
"11322250","11323210"," I agree with you on that."
"11324770","11330790"," I think I'm looking at this more of a by the dip and then when people think it matters and"
"11330790","11331930"," they all sell into them."
"11332370","11334090"," I think I'm selling into those people. "
"11334090","11338550"," I think I'm going to be selling into those people."
"11338550","11342570"," What I don't want to do is get caught with my with my hands or pants and there's no buyers"
"11342570","11343010"," there."
"11344410","11345330"," I need the buyers. "
"11345610","11346130"," There's my point."
"11355210","11355970"," Yeah, you did."
"11356070","11356750"," You cut it loose yesterday. "
"11357010","11358150"," I thought about it yesterday in the open."
"11358150","11359590"," I thought about this morning on the open."
"11359930","11361270"," It was a great open this morning. "
"11361850","11363130"," I was like, yeah, cut that shit loose."
"11363990","11364650"," Didn't do it."
"11364810","11365870"," I'm looking for one more push. "
"11377160","11380300"," Yeah, you figure waiting till the news started to scare everyone with oil short shock."
"11380520","11384420"," Yeah, I'm hoping that like there's I saw some articles this morning."
"11385300","11389420"," They were saying like they were like, don't worry. "
"11389560","11391640"," We got more doom and destruction coming from this hurricane."
"11391640","11393360"," I'm like, okay, good, good, good."
"11393360","11394540"," I'm going to keep on that doom news. "
"11398880","11400040"," I'm going to keep the doom coming."
"11407050","11409630"," Yeah, I'm up right now pretty significantly, so I don't know."
"11411290","11412550"," I don't know when to cut here. "
"11413050","11417470"," I can just cut right now and be happy, but I want that one last push higher."
"11421610","11422950"," I didn't want to watch it at nighttime."
"11423090","11425910"," I was going to buy CL and I was like, fuck this. "
"11425910","11427010"," I just wanted to cash market."
"11427550","11428130"," I feel like."
"11429370","11434030"," Like, you know, like all these major moves are made like on the opens and closes and fucking like"
"11434030","11437390"," four o'clock to six a.m. nine a.m. I'm like, I don't want to deal with that shit. "
"11438110","11441610"," I'm like, I'm just going to cut it loose, like get ahead of it and cut it loose."
"11448500","11449500"," Maybe we should run a poll."
"11449680","11450380"," Let me see if I can run a poll. "
"11451420","11452680"," Let me see if I can do one right now."
"11453660","11454580"," Let's see if we can do a poll here."
"11455040","11456600"," We're going to find out if we're going to roll here or not. "
"11458820","11460260"," Looks like a good place to roll."
"11463940","11464660"," Hold on here."
"11465360","11466400"," Let me take a look at something here. "
"11468620","11470040"," Yeah, dude, I think we can roll here."
"11471360","11473180"," I'm not sure puts to the downside."
"11474540","11475520"," Where's the hourly trigger?"
"11475800","11476200"," I'll let us say. "
"11476300","11477700"," I need a minute here."
"11488900","11490860"," It's just like hunting right now."
"11492300","11494760"," Like that hourly is just racing higher. "
"11495040","11511180"," 447.94. That's"
"11511180","11513100"," such a juicy little hit and run right there."
"11513260","11513540"," Just like."
"11515120","11517640"," Send it right down and that's the actual dip by. "
"11523580","11525360"," Like 448s are fucking."
"11526920","11529100"," They're five fucking cents right now."
"11536120","11537800"," 449s are 10 cents right now. "
"11561110","11562790"," I own 449 P."
"11567110","11568150"," They're dirt cheap."
"11568150","11571830"," I don't own a lot of only 25 of them."
"11574850","11575710"," Just in case. "
"11576470","11579010"," It's a little bit of pro-holactics."
"11581170","11582450"," I expect them to burn."
"11584390","11587350"," I was going to buy the 448s because they were fucking six cents. "
"11590650","11591690"," That's not my expectation."
"11592010","11592750"," I think we squeeze here."
"11592750","11595410"," Just like I can make 250 bucks. "
"11605680","11606660"," I own fucking."
"11606960","11608460"," I own some puts right now."

"12441470","12443290"," It actually shows you how to vote. "
"12443510","12448050"," So if you don't know how to vote in the poll, you have to hit the exclamation mark, then V "
"12448050","12452730","-O-T-E, and then a space bar in the word or the two words together."
"12452730","12454450"," You can see him here on the chart."
"12460220","12463100"," Right now, who's winning right now?"

"12500270","12510880"," I'm like, I'm still in them, but I'm like, eh, I"
"12510880","12512800"," shouldn't put them on unless we get underneath here."
"12512980","12518440"," The reason why I shouldn't have these puts on is because we should be down here for me to enter"
"12518440","12518660"," puts. "
"12519320","12520720"," I'm probably going to close them here in a minute."

"12540460","12541760"," I like that answer."
"12543200","12545780"," I like the answer of, yeah, we can go each way. "
"12546120","12553990"," So I do like that answer."
"12555790","12557870"," I like the indecisiveness of it."
"12557870","12558550"," I actually do. "
"12560810","12563430"," I wonder if we squeeze and then roll."
"12570580","12573680"," NDX coming up to test its gap right now."
"12574180","12575780"," Tesla's trying to fight for a squeeze. "
"12577140","12578580"," Vix is about to roll over."
"12580500","12582400"," Into the downside on Vix."
"12605370","12606770"," Way back machine. "
"12612420","12614940"," So I'll give you guys some targets on the Vix."
"12619790","12620510"," 1403."
"12629200","12632120"," 1393 closes the gap on Vix. "
"12640980","12644980"," The most recent really major previous loan the Vix was."
"12648440","12648960"," 1285."
"12677420","12678060"," Hold on. "
"12678120","12678900"," I'll go back and do some."
"12693300","12694800"," So Vix right now."
"12701010","12702650"," Some flat again right now. "
"12702770","12703210"," Just went flat."
"12704170","12707630"," So Vix right now has a gap that's starting to fill."
"12708510","12710070"," It's first gap right now. "
"12720340","12722200"," It's second gap to fill."
"12724340","12737750"," It was"
"12737750","12740150"," between 1358 and 1340."
"12742170","12743830"," The current gap it has. "
"12745450","12762040"," It's got tons of gaps"
"12762040","12762760"," down there to fill."
"12762760","12765180"," So we got all kinds of fucking gaps to fill on Vix."
"12768940","12770500"," To the downside baby. "
"12777900","12780960"," Now is that trying to close its gaps to the upside right now."
"12787330","12788890"," Tesla just heads up."
"12789450","12790590"," If you're trading Tesla. "
"12791970","12793670"," This is your place right here."
"12795370","12796770"," This is your place too."
"12796910","12798590"," If you're going to get bullish this is it. "
"12798790","12799970"," If you get a break on Tesla."
"12802130","12803990"," Below two fifty eight oh one."
"12805390","12807030"," Doom and destruction to you. "
"12823200","12824580"," Let's see what the poll says."
"12824840","12826980"," Okay, so the poll I'm going to close the poll now."
"12828200","12830640"," We have thirty one votes for up. "
"12830960","12833340"," Thirty two votes for roll for down."
"12833820","12836520"," Eight votes for no idea eight votes for second cap."
"12836820","12838280"," Now 10% of the vote is stuck. "
"12838500","12839020"," I dig it."
"12839380","12840800"," We're going to close the poll here."
"12840800","12843880"," If you want to vote one last time you more than like you can. "
"12844440","12848720"," I tend to agree here with with the poll."
"12849380","12853000"," That I can't tell you where we're going to go if we're going to squeeze a roll over here."
"12853340","12855840"," If I had to take a guess we're going to roll. "
"12857080","12860600"," So I'm going to close the I'm going to close the poll right now."
"12860700","12861280"," Just closed it."
"12861600","12861900"," Okay. "
"12861980","12862440"," What do I do now?"
"12862720","12863100"," Go back."
"12865740","12867200"," It looks like it's closed."
"12867980","12869760"," Let me see if it's closed. "
"12871760","12872820"," View active poll."
"12873320","12873780"," What can I do?"
"12873980","12875560"," It says it's still up so."
"12877260","12878200"," All right, complete. "
"12879960","12880340"," Complete."
"12881360","12882360"," Okay, so it's done."
"12884400","12885840"," So that poll is now done. "
"12886720","12888180"," My take is that we go down."
"12888300","12889040"," If you want my answer."
"12890240","12891720"," I think that we go down here. "
"12891760","12893420"," I don't think that we squeeze up just this one moment."
"12893520","12894840"," I think we're looking for a dip to buy."
"12895940","12901280"," So I do agree with the poll pollsters. "
"12901760","12903340"," I think the pollsters have been a straight."
"12903540","12903780"," That's me."
"12905000","12906540"," The respondents of the poll. "
"12908060","12910380"," I think I have a valid answer."
"12910720","12911960"," We can squeeze here."
"12912080","12915440"," We can roll over here and it's a it's a really risky place. "
"12916520","12920120"," To be long or short either one."
"12921480","12924900"," So with knowing that, what would you what would you take away from that?"
"12927340","12928920"," If you begin to see the role."
"12929700","12930780"," Enter puts, right?"
"12931820","12933180"," Begin to see the rejection here. "
"12933180","12935700"," You enter puts somewhere right here."
"12935820","12936900"," If you begin to see the squeeze."
"12939380","12941340"," Right, let's say we get a nice big by here. "
"12941340","12944140"," We come up and we come right back down."
"12944180","12945980"," You see something like this and a break."
"12946580","12947820"," Of this are one. "
"12948100","12949780"," We start to break above this are one."
"12950080","12952020"," You're going to take along for the squeeze."
"12952500","12952680"," Okay. "
"12953260","12956360"," So either way, I'm in agreements with the poll with the poll saying."
"12956760","12959200"," I can just as easily go down as go up here."
"12960460","12962100"," And I don't have a take on it. "
"12962180","12965720"," I see some gaps to close to the downside on VIX."
"12966860","12973820"," I also see a gap that needs closed on NASDAQ that needs to be closed to the upside."
"12974440","12976660"," So maybe they close that gap and rolls down. "
"12977260","12981100"," So for me right now, Mike 5050 with everybody else."
"12981900","12983720"," So whatever which way we see here."
"12985200","12986300"," We'll enter a trade. "
"12986480","12987720"," So we're going to watch this right now."
"12992540","12994060"," And I'll enter a trade."
"12998220","13000060"," That's the Quinnipiac Pro poll, baby. "
"13000800","13001640"," We did a poll."
"13001820","13001980"," Sweet."
"13002340","13002940"," That wasn't hard. "
"13002940","13004100"," It wasn't as hard as I thought it was."
"13004760","13005880"," That it was harder than that."
"13012810","13014570"," I think NASDAQ is going to squeeze here. "
"13015990","13019990"," I think NASDAQ has to close out that fucking gap above."
"13023900","13026620"," They're like so close right now to closing that gap on NASDAQ."
"13034640","13038780"," That target is 15, 15, 7, 10, 41. "
"13045050","13050090"," My problem here is the thing that I'm looking for here is the thing that's concerning to me is that"
"13050090","13050390"," I'm like."
"13051470","13053310"," You know, they do this bullshit here."
"13053930","13056290"," Close the gap on NASDAQ, then roll spy. "
"13057570","13060850"," Like I'm hedging spy and I'm long spoos or not spoos."
"13061150","13064210"," I'm a hedging spoos and I'm long tech."
"13065890","13066790"," You hear what I'm saying?"
"13080010","13083390"," We'll just pin the fuck out of spoos and print all of our calls everywhere else. "
"13089900","13091160"," Dude, I'm going to leave that shit up."
"13091280","13091700"," That's awesome."
"13093120","13095940"," I'm going to start running all kinds of a let me ask another poll. "
"13097500","13098540"," We'll do a different poll."
"13100460","13101760"," Okay, so I deleted that one."
"13104480","13106320"," How many years have you been trading?"
"13114780","13115340"," Let's ask. "
"13115520","13116700"," Let's do a round robin here."
"13118800","13119200"," Option."
"13125910","13129390"," One, two, three to be a pretty decent one. "
"13131510","13132310"," One."
"13133270","13133350"," Add."
"13135570","13137130"," Three to five. "
"13140270","13140670"," Two."
"13140970","13141850"," That's option number two."
"13142250","13143050"," Add. "
"13145010","13146110"," Five to 10."
"13149710","13151050"," That's vote number three."
"13151910","13152290"," Add. "
"13153490","13154430"," Ten plus."
"13157330","13158730"," There's option number four."
"13159630","13160210"," Add. "
"13160610","13161190"," Let's try this one."
"13161990","13162210"," Done."
"13163570","13164350"," Start poll. "
"13165590","13165810"," Here we go."
"13165930","13166430"," I'm going to do another poll."
"13167470","13168270"," Seeing as we're fucking around. "
"13169570","13170810"," Start another poll."
"13171430","13172990"," How many years have you been trading?"
"13173410","13174670"," Investing or trading doesn't matter."
"13177190","13178250"," One to three years. "
"13179050","13180190"," Three to five years."
"13180490","13181670"," These seem like pretty decent milestones."
"13182830","13183770"," One to three years. "
"13183990","13185130"," Then you get the three to five year mark."
"13185150","13186330"," Then you get the five to 10."
"13186730","13188090"," Then you get the 10 plus years. "
"13189550","13190510"," I said one to three."
"13190590","13191430"," It should be zero to three."
"13192250","13193290"," So zero to three years. "
"13193530","13194830"," Even if you're new brand new."
"13196210","13197370"," Zero like three months."
"13198430","13199650"," You're in the one three year camp. "
"13200610","13201670"," You got a gold star."
"13201930","13203310"," You're considering a year."
"13204130","13204950"," Partial year. "
"13209840","13211540"," No five to ten years, huh?"
"13212520","13213340"," What's fascinating?"
"13215180","13216620"," Three to five, ten plus."
"13218520","13224420"," You got a little bit of five to ten year traders."
"13232440","13233800"," Twenty nine votes right now. "
"13236340","13238040"," They're getting you guys involved in the stream."
"13238260","13238560"," You see that?"
"13239040","13241680"," Get a little bit of action from the chats right now."
"13242300","13243720"," Stats are in here working up. "
"13243860","13245500"," They're working like, oh shit, I got to answer that poll."
"13251100","13252920"," Ten plus is twenty plus."
"13254280","13256160"," You want you want to be grandfathered in?"
"13256420","13257260"," You get ten plus. "
"13258040","13261440"," I figure if you're not doing it right after ten years, you got a problem."
"13263440","13265080"," Now pay attention here."
"13266240","13266980"," Pay attention. "
"13267480","13270100"," Look at the people that are saying they've been trading longer than ten years."
"13270920","13272400"," Keep your eyes on those people."
"13272600","13273340"," Anyone that's voting. "
"13274220","13275520"," Number four right now."

"13282200","13283520"," Keep your eyes on all those."
"13283580","13284500"," All those people, right?"
"13284680","13285560"," Take notes right now. "
"13285980","13291600"," And be like, that guy I trust, that guy I trust, that woman I trust, that woman I trust."
"13298580","13299900"," That woman I trust."
"13302100","13305720"," Those guys are probably making like 5,000% trades. "
"13307340","13309960"," They're like, yeah, we're going long on fucking chess."
"13310160","13311440"," They're going up a hundred points by morning."

"13329900","13330740"," God damn it."
"13340560","13343870"," If you don't want to vote, you don't have to."
"13343950","13344710"," Don't worry about it. "
"13353290","13354270"," It's like you test."
"13355630","13357070"," Who just voted 10?"
"13357630","13357970"," I'm just kidding."
"13374570","13377670"," I'm buying right now for 52 C's. "
"13389160","13389920"," Come on."
"13390060","13391000"," Do it for me."

"13401140","13403340"," Now DPMs are looking up boss right now."
"13403400","13403720"," Go right on."
"13403820","13404460"," Thanks for saying that. "
"13404660","13405200"," Appreciate that."
"13408240","13409780"," I've got a LDPM."
"13415360","13416200"," Down there. "
"13423830","13424790"," You're voting five."
"13425430","13425970"," I'm long."
"13426990","13428030"," I was at some puts. "
"13428510","13429770"," I didn't make any money, lose any money."
"13430350","13430650"," Just flat."
"13430990","13432530"," And then I got to get some calls now. "
"13432970","13436390"," A little bit of reversal the upside here is looking bullish."
"13437250","13437670"," I'm liking it."
"13437850","13438810"," I'm liking the structure of it. "
"13443590","13444690"," So far I'm liking it."
"13446290","13447630"," Okay, so let's check this poll."
"13448970","13450510"," We're called poll day. "
"13452850","13457050"," So far we've got 15 votes for one to three years."
"13458150","13459810"," I actually liked being a trader."
"13461450","13462770"," Year one through three. "
"13462950","13463950"," I enjoyed that time period."
"13463950","13464290"," It was good."
"13464390","13464650"," It was fun. "
"13465490","13466630"," I had a lot of fun actually."
"13467090","13468030"," I'd actually had a lot of fun."
"13468330","13473870"," I didn't realize when I was a young trader that I had no idea what the fuck was going on. "
"13474310","13475710"," And I was just extremely lucky."
"13477330","13479810"," I also took another lesson away from that time period."
"13481350","13485810"," But I didn't get that lesson until much later, which was simplify everything. "
"13487990","13488790"," So, so."
"13490710","13492030"," So you're one to three years."
"13492050","13492810"," We've got a lot of those. "
"13493070","13495070"," We actually have a lot of three to five year traders."
"13495470","13496930"," That's what I thought we would have."
"13497870","13501910"," So my three to five year trader, when I was three to five year trader, I over complicated"
"13501910","13502370"," everything. "
"13503250","13504710"," Thought I was smarter than the market."
"13505950","13507190"," Thought I was a rocket scientist."
"13507190","13512270"," That's also that three year to five year, but like three year to five year mark. "
"13513010","13514450"," Was when I started becoming a bear."
"13515430","13519010"," Into my 10 year mark, I started to learn that I wasn't a bull or a bear."
"13519670","13521350"," So like that five 10 year mark. "
"13522390","13524090"," I became a much better trader."
"13524910","13525490"," An investor."
"13526750","13528250"," In that time period, like that. "
"13528490","13529350"," It's a real sweet spot."
"13529810","13531630"," And not only that I started to."
"13532890","13535810"," Become more like, hey, I'm going to be a bull tired of this. "
"13536790","13542710"," Another fascinating part of that time period was I reverted back to realizing that I was over"
"13542710","13544750"," complicating stuff for a lot of my career."
"13546090","13548790"," That 10 plus vote, there's only 13 votes."
"13549530","13553470"," Those people that are voting that number or anyone that voted five or six or seven. "
"13554190","13555750"," You should trust those people."
"13557350","13558790"," Anyone with time and market."
"13559370","13565790"," I don't I don't. "
"13568050","13570730"," I'm not trying to compare someone like him."
"13570910","13573170"," Let's say to a 10 year plus trader."
"13573370","13575930"," I'm saying if you meet an actual trader that's been trading 10 plus years. "
"13578310","13580870"," This is one of those things where experience counts."
"13582630","13584590"," Not every profession is like that."
"13585450","13587150"," Some professions you need a lot of education. "
"13587490","13588510"," You need a lot of hands on experience."
"13588810","13589790"," All kinds of different stuff, right?"
"13590730","13592170"," Sometimes you just need education."
"13592890","13594670"," Sometimes you just need to be really smart, right?"
"13595230","13599490"," This this this this I've seen smart people fail and I've seen dumb people fail. "
"13599590","13602250"," I've seen smart people win and dumb people win."
"13602910","13605870"," This is very much a hands on profession."
"13607770","13611150"," It does help you to be smart, but even a dumb person. "
"13611430","13615670"," There are traders out there with zero college and they've done quite well."
"13615870","13616790"," They're very famous traders."
"13617130","13620930"," So it is fascinating to read these poll results. "
"13622070","13628050"," If you see anybody in the chat that posted 10 plus and they say something, I'd be listening to"
"13628050","13628290"," them."
"13628950","13633930"," They will they will likely an all likelihood have seen a lot of shit."
"13635270","13638670"," They've an all likelihood seen things that aren't supposed to happen. "
"13639510","13642570"," And I would I would lean on them for their experience."
"13643530","13649290"," So I don't know who those 10 or 13 people were, but I would trust those people to some extent."
"13651130","13655250"," And when they like they talk to you about their experiences in the market specifically. "
"13662910","13670030"," Yeah, I guess we should we should segregate that right investing in trading and two different"
"13670030","13670410"," things."
"13670830","13673070"," We maybe we could have clarified the club."
"13673150","13675910"," Maybe the poll could be a better better structure or multi part poll. "
"13676490","13677610"," I don't disagree with that answer."
"13677750","13678290"," That's good answer."
"13680950","13685050"," You know what I noticed was I've become a better trader the past few years from a day trading. "
"13685510","13688370"," This much like I trade the dog shit, the good shit, the bad shit."
"13690030","13691790"," Like I trade what's bad, but it's good."
"13692230","13697050"," I don't make nearly as much as I used to make being more more selected my day trading. "
"13701750","13702990"," Yeah, overthinking trading."
"13703490","13704470"," That's a problem, right?"
"13705130","13711310"," I think my biggest thing today is my two biggest weaknesses right now."
"13712330","13717370"," Would be holding not long enough. "
"13718990","13721050"," I don't know if that's good or bad."
"13721350","13723750"," I've got mixed results on that."
"13726450","13728990"," I still need time in that. "
"13730610","13731350"," And then."
"13733950","13736250"," Still dealing with fear every once in a while."
"13737650","13739290"," Still deal or self doubt. "
"13740110","13740690"," That's a big one."
"13743270","13745650"," Like self doubt, panic, fear."
"13746490","13748090"," You'll notice I step sometimes late night. "
"13749590","13752610"," You'll know you'll know in positions from up late night."
"13752850","13756290"," Sometimes I'll wake up at nighttime and get on Twitter and then I go to bed and you'll see me"
"13756290","13756470"," again."
"13757030","13758010"," That means I'm just checking. "
"13758790","13759830"," Like are we okay?"
"13760070","13760510"," Is everything good?"
"13761310","13767170"," Okay, I'm going to bed now, but that's one of my biggest faults is teachers will consume my life."
"13767590","13767870"," So."
"13769650","13771230"," I still deal with that to this day. "
"13776530","13778930"," Yeah, that helped me a lot to make myself dumber."
"13779330","13781630"," That helped me become a better investor and trader."
"13782830","13783930"," Dumb down everything. "
"13785790","13789090"," Another big part of that is stop watching the fucking news."
"13790110","13792310"," Stop believing the news, stop believing."
"13793250","13795090"," Like everything that you see. "
"13796090","13798330"," I've become a very big specs skeptic."
"13800690","13803830"," Of the intentions of whatever I'm consuming."
"13804910","13807630"," So like if someone's feeding me something. "
"13808250","13811710"," That has like bazillion followers or."
"13812530","13815110"," It's like, you know, like fucking Bloomberg or fucking."
"13815630","13821150"," Bloomberg has a little bit better record on their on their websites and on their news paper online"
"13821150","13821710"," newspaper. "
"13823210","13827390"," I can't say don't like Bloomberg, but that's a bad example."
"13827390","13828290"," I mean, like CNBC."
"13829390","13832570"," Or like an interview on CNBC, like they interview somebody in a CNBC. "
"13833010","13833910"," I'm like fuck that guy."
"13834730","13835130"," Really?"
"13835270","13836190"," I'm like fuck that guy."
"13837470","13838610"," Anyone being interviewed. "
"13839450","13840050"," They have a motivation."
"13841710","13842590"," That kind of stuff."
"13842750","13842950"," I don't. "
"13843070","13844310"," I'm very much skeptical of that shit."
"13850700","13851920"," Yeah, it's still on right now."
"13851980","13852800"," It's still running right now. "
"13853040","13853520"," Paul's still on."
"13855040","13856280"," You can vote."
"13856600","13861120"," It's it's an exclamation point vote and then the letter the numbers one through four. "
"13864290","13867130"," You know, I'm going to say something to you here where we break here break."
"13867430","13868210"," You got to be very careful."
"13868210","13869550"," I got to say some careful to you. "
"13870130","13873290"," I'm watching NASDAQ squeeze higher right now."
"13874750","13877230"," And this can be a function of."
"13878610","13880090"," Smaller sectors within. "
"13882990","13887070"," NASDAQ being pumped while they're pinning the spy to hedge."
"13888150","13893270"," And if that gap gets closed on NASDAQ and spy does not squeeze, we will get a role."
"13893510","13895130"," So it's a warning to you if you're a bull. "
"13896070","13899530"," Be ready to to have a stop below."
"13899530","13899950"," Okay."
"13901270","13906870"," I'm watching NASDAQ get up there right now and it sometimes it doesn't end well for bulls. "
"13907710","13909670"," Just be cautious of that."
"13910290","13916190"," So you'd see like spy be synthetically hedged like a buying cheap spy puts."
"13916950","13924070"," While I'm trying to push up the price of some some neglected tech stocks right now. "
"13924570","13926190"," Just be conscious of that."
"13926930","13930770"," There's another there's some other wheels moving in the background of the market right now."
"13935630","13938470"," Okay, I'm going to close the poll got 62 votes. "
"13939430","13941530"," You don't have to answer if you don't want to get that."
"13942150","13947910"," You might not want not want people to know how long you've been trading or investing or anything"
"13947910","13948370"," like that."
"13949330","13950050"," That's a good poll. "
"13950430","13950790"," I like it."
"13951050","13952010"," It's a good blend here."
"13952130","13953150"," It's a really nice blend. "
"13956130","13958550"," I am going to expect less people."
"13960790","13962570"," Well, you guys can't you guys can't see that."
"13963230","13967730"," I'm going to expect less 10 year plus veterans less five 10 year veterans. "
"13968570","13972790"," It's really positive to see how many three to five year traders there are."
"13972970","13977530"," And this is a good mix of of a good representation of our chat."
"13978050","13985950"," So looking at our chat knowing that 62 people have this kind of a rounded curve to them gives me"
"13985950","13986190"," hope. "
"13986670","13989250"," Well, that gives me good faith in our chat."
"13989530","13992970"," So our chat is a well-rounded group of people."
"13993210","13994170"," So I'm going to say that. "
"13994310","13995290"," So that's a very good thing."
"13998070","13998470"," Congratulations."
"13999770","14003410"," If our poll is all one year traders, I'd be kind of sketched out, right?"
"14004630","14006330"," So I'm going to close this poll now. "
"14007270","14008410"," And I'm going to complete it."
"14009310","14010490"," And what does that tell us?"
"14010490","14015270"," I think what we can glean from it is that we have a well-rounded group of traders here."
"14015270","14016450"," Well, we're on a group of investors. "
"14016550","14017470"," Well, we're on a group."
"14017730","14018670"," It's very good."
"14019510","14021070"," I'm very happy to see that. "
"14021170","14023950"," It's not just like, hey, we're all one year traders here trying to learn."
"14024150","14027170"," So you've got good support inside the ranks here."
"14028710","14030590"," Oh, they're trying to squeeze me out right now. "
"14041820","14043120"," So I just closed the poll."
"14044800","14045320"," It's a very good."
"14045400","14047780"," It's about very good for 52 votes. "
"14047920","14049300"," It's a very good rounded number."
"14049940","14052200"," It's a well-weighted chat group."
"14052200","14055240"," So congratulations to you in the chat right now and you voted. "
"14063220","14064360"," It's a good chat, dude."
"14064480","14065420"," I can't say that's bad."
"14066380","14069100"," It's a very good fucking chat response. "
"14077320","14079160"," Hey, thanks for subscribing, Paul."
"14079700","14080180"," Goodness."
"14080740","14081340"," Appreciate it, man. "
"14085560","14090560"," Let me still sit in here trying to break through."
"14093440","14095160"," Just trying to smash through, right?"
"14095600","14098000"," You know what happens if we break through here, right?"
"14099400","14100640"," You know what happens."
"14100900","14101540"," We do squeeze. "
"14102100","14102760"," They don't want it."
"14102840","14104980"," We typically don't break through the first time."
"14105560","14108120"," Like typically it takes one or two stabs. "
"14108180","14110140"," We have to get the hourly and the half hour to go up there."
"14110640","14111760"," I am long calls right now."
"14112160","14113120"," I was in some puts. "
"14113940","14115020"," Now I'm in some calls."
"14115900","14117140"," Looking at this role right here."
"14118060","14119100"," They're trying to squeeze me out. "
"14120020","14121760"," So I'm going to watch this right here."
"14121860","14122780"," I'm going to slide this backwards."
"14123760","14128940"," And I want to take a quick peek here because if they're going to squeeze me out of calls, I"
"14128940","14130200"," want to be prepared for it. "
"14130840","14135340"," If we have a bloodbath in here, see this little bit right here coming down."
"14136520","14137200"," Right there."
"14137600","14139360"," They're going to try to squeeze me out right now. "
"14139720","14141800"," And I'm going to hope to try to get out of my calls up here."
"14142480","14145080"," Just the opposite of what I was telling bears earlier."
"14145360","14146500"," So keep your eyes on this. "
"14149280","14150820"," Watch that blood right there."
"14159510","14160870"," Give me all scaries."
"14161050","14162810"," They're giving me the Sunday scaries. "
"14165950","14167750"," You can see it happening right here."
"14167890","14168590"," One and two."
"14171430","14173290"," They're like panic, baby, panic. "
"14188800","14190260"," Mike, do I buy puts here?"
"14196190","14198450"," Look at that big old droopiness right there."
"14198610","14200910"," Trying to, trying to whittle out the bowls here."
"14239930","14241550"," Nice little bit of blood here. "
"14241890","14243630"," You got the cross starting right here."
"14269430","14271650"," Target to the downside right here."
"14276360","14279820"," Just waiting to make an entry on puts still own calls right now. "
"14280160","14284100"," Should have held onto those 449s but didn't."
"14284280","14287100"," Got some puts lined up here still long calls."
"14307280","14311740"," I've got a cell set up on my calls and a buy set up on puts. "
"14315630","14320430"," And I'm going to try to slam the cell calls and buy puts button here in just a minute."
"14332530","14334890"," Give me one more green bar up there."
"14335010","14336730"," One more green bar. "
"14341710","14342910"," Keep on going."
"14343970","14345690"," Keep on going."
"14350090","14357350"," This is probably my chance right here. "
"14358510","14359410"," I'm sweating right now."
"14364350","14368230"," I'm going to order into cell calls and 5, 449p."
"14371550","14373490"," Still no fill on either side. "
"14376310","14377330"," There we go."
"14379430","14380050"," Nope."
"14391570","14393510"," I'm not getting fills here. "
"14393590","14394030"," Hold on a second."
"14399790","14400430"," All right."
"14400790","14401370"," That's good. "
"14405440","14409220"," I've sold calls and I'm now just long 449p."
"14434770","14436550"," Took a hit there and calls man."
"14436710","14441090"," They took me for 50% of that trade. "
"14452680","14454660"," That's means I got to make 30 cents don't I?"
"14454920","14456980"," I got to make a full 30 cents on 449."
"14466800","14467580"," Come on, baby."
"14467760","14468140"," Come on down. "
"14473420","14475160"," We did tag this earlier."
"14475440","14476000"," This gray love."
"14481160","14483640"," Looking for some kind of a break below it. "
"14484140","14486080"," And then a tag of the hourly trigger down here."
"14499270","14500070"," Come on."
"14501110","14502410"," Slide that over so you can see it. "
"14502490","14503450"," Sorry, you guys can't see this."
"14508850","14510650"," Put that up there so you can see it."
"14516330","14518270"," Trade 19 cents on 449p. "
"14522810","14524430"," I need 30 cents to be out."
"14524570","14526290"," If you guys want to know, I need 30 cents on that trade."
"14527270","14528230"," 30 plus cents. "
"14530530","14534750"," They'll pay for my previous trade and be starting to actually be profitable."
"14542540","14546200"," It's trading 22 right now on 449p."
"14561740","14563380"," God, I fucking hate puts. "
"14564040","14566020"," I fucking hate puts, dude."
"14566920","14567860"," I fucking hate them."
"14569100","14574000"," I fucking hate puts. "

"14588430","14590890"," Trade 19, 18 cents right now."
"14605440","14607640"," And just the structure of puts suck. "

"14839110","14842290"," Come on, come on. "
"14842290","14843150"," Let's do some bear music."
"14843270","14844510"," Where's that bear music at?"
"14848210","14849650"," Him played bear music in a while."
"14852330","14854070"," I'm going to turn some shit on right now. "
"14863000","14863900"," Oh yeah, come on down."
"14868880","14869600"," Come on."

"14880860","14881880"," Don't fail me now, bears. "
"14886130","14887630"," Don't fucking fail me, bears."
"14888070","14891910"," Oh, that's a little loud bears."
"14892110","14893070"," Bears are so loud. "
"14893390","14894550"," Turn it down a little bit, bears."
"14895890","14897650"," Oh my God, you're so loud."
"14901890","14902770"," So saucy. "
"14908340","14909220"," Come on."
"14909620","14910320"," Oh, no."
"14910520","14910860"," Wrong way. "
"14911040","14911680"," Wrong way, bears."
"14914160","14915100"," Wrong way, spy."
"14924490","14925510"," Not loud enough. "
"14936630","14937970"," Come on, bears."

"16894870","16899410"," My wife and children didn't believe me, but I did sell everything."
"16900570","16902850"," And I went to permanently short the market, Mr. Schiff. "

"17193960","17195480"," That's your target for calls."
"17196900","17197920"," Fucking a man."
"17208670","17210510"," That fucking hate puts, dude. "
"17210510","17212470"," Trading seven cents right now."
"17214310","17216270"," Down 50% on puts."
"17216610","17218170"," This would be a full loss trade. "
"17218410","17221310"," This would make me kind of fucking pissier."
"17224010","17226190"," No follow through here for bears."
"17226730","17226790"," None. "
"17227250","17228210"," No follow through."
"17228470","17229490"," This doesn't mean shit."
"17233290","17234710"," No follow through. "
"17235770","17238170"," We're reversing to the upside right now."
"17241310","17243030"," Hope I can get out right over here."
"17267230","17269190"," That fucking hate puts, dude. "
"17269370","17271150"," I can't stand them."
"17272070","17277210"," Like every time I buy puts, I'm like, even if I win, I'm like, I ain't fucking buying those things"
"17277210","17277750"," ever again."
"17278550","17279810"," And then there I go buying them again. "
"17280930","17282730"," I can't stand them."
"17283630","17288230"," The one time they fucking print the other fucking ten times, they fucking suck."
"17290070","17291530"," I made 700%. "
"17291530","17292650"," What about your other ten trades?"
"17293050","17294150"," I fucking lost 700%."
"17307420","17309400"," Let me just check this level right here."
"17309400","17311080"," Make sure right there. "
"17336320","17340720"," I'm thinking about adding like 100 puts right here just to try to DC on the way down."
"17341520","17344700"," Try to fucking, try to fucking save this trade."
"17367540","17369220"," Not damn bears, dude. "
"17369600","17371060"," No fucking follow through."
"17375000","17376120"," Still sit in puts."
"17376120","17376920"," I haven't added any. "
"17377540","17385100"," I want it to add, I want to add some for potential roll down before the fucking squeeze that's"
"17385100","17385340"," coming."
"17386200","17389100"," Then catch this right here for like two pennies or something."
"17392840","17394720"," Still on puts right now. "
"17397500","17400940"," HYG, dude, holding its 129 EMA."
"17401700","17402940"," Let me get stopped out here in just a minute."
"17403060","17403800"," I'm going to take it off. "
"17405700","17408000"," Two L's on the day so far for me."
"17408420","17409640"," Two, unusual."
"17411320","17411720"," Not the norm. "
"17415140","17416200"," Not full L's."
"17416320","17419280"," I didn't like, I didn't like go to zero or anything like that in the first one."
"17419420","17420220"," Just a shitty trade. "
"17441660","17443320"," I fucking hate puts, dude."
"17443460","17446980"," I'm like thinking about my brain right now is like don't ever fucking buy puts."
"17447980","17449620"," What are you fucking thinking?"
"17454260","17455780"," That's my head right now. "

"17457940","17460160"," What the fuck are you thinking ever buying puts?"
"17461780","17462260"," Ever."
"17462960","17463320"," Like literally. "
"17463620","17466060"," We could get down fucking 20% and don't ever buy puts."
"17466780","17466920"," Seriously."
"17475030","17476890"," Fuckers were trading like 23 cents. "
"17477090","17479090"," Now they're trading five cents."
"17480970","17481650"," Fucking puts."

"17498150","17500310"," We're about to rip some faces off here too. "
"17501550","17503150"," HYG holding its 129."
"17504450","17508550"," My last chance here is the HYG rolling down into this close."
"17508790","17510830"," I got one more chance but it ain't looking good. "
"17511630","17513050"," It's looking like dog shit right now."
"17522520","17524520"," I'm going to hope in a prayer right now that I get paid."
"17525960","17526760"," They're staying on. "

"17557340","17558900"," I had like fucking 50 of them. "
"17559520","17567840"," Come on now baby."
"17568060","17568600"," Come on."
"17569040","17570320"," Give me that end of the day roll. "
"17570500","17571580"," They sound like a fucking bear now."
"17571800","17572520"," Just begging and pleading."
"17574420","17577440"," I'm like looking over here at Tesla and Tesla wants to fuck. "
"17578060","17579260"," It wants to go way up."
"17579580","17581040"," Nasdaq wants to go way up."

"17589680","17591260"," It's all looking pretty bullish here."
"17591580","17592520"," Let me take a quick look at something. "
"17593400","17595040"," I want to see something really quick."
"17597340","17600900"," We had a checks on the background because I'm going to probably get my ass handed to me."
"17601620","17602920"," GME still going up. "
"17603120","17604760"," GME looking to fucking crank still."
"17605480","17609620"," GME want to tag that big beautiful nineteen dollars and twenty cents."
"17609620","17612440"," So I'm checking GME and AMC right now. "
"17613160","17618540"," And these shit stocks because what they do is they run these bad boys up if they can."
"17619680","17621360"," Like a basket or a risk on basket."
"17622420","17624480"," A note to you if you are a trader. "
"17625460","17627120"," If you are a trader out there."
"17628300","17633200"," There is a bullish crossover coming right now for AMC."
"17635360","17638820"," They're getting a confirmation test right now on. "
"17639600","17641520"," Twelve dollars and fifteen cents."
"17642180","17645580"," As long as AMC holds eleven dollars and seventy one cents."
"17646600","17650920"," It's got the potential to get to start moving like trade a hundred percent trade. "
"17651420","17656000"," I don't think you get there but you are targeting twenty eight dollars on AMC."
"17656980","17657560"," So AMC."
"17659460","17660560"," GME looks good too. "
"17660660","17662300"," It's got a bunch of work to get where it needs to be."
"17662440","17665700"," But I'm watching these shit stocks because."
"17667380","17671040"," I'm watching these shit stocks because when you get it when you like to have a three bar trade. "
"17672040","17673960"," At the end cycle of that trade."
"17674500","17676960"," You'll see hedge funds of baskets of."
"17677880","17681440"," Like very risky stocks and they'll take the hedge off and run them up. "
"17681920","17684100"," And then re hedge them at the end of the run."
"17684360","17687300"," So just heads up to you AMC."
"17688180","17689260"," Looking beautiful right now. "
"17690680","17692700"," GME has already done its work to go higher."
"17694900","17699040"," GME is looking for I mean they've got some resistance above here at eighteen fifty one."
"17699040","17703160"," But they are looking for a squeeze to nineteen thirty three. "
"17703400","17704680"," I'm still long puts here."
"17705320","17707200"," I see the cycling going on."
"17707280","17708600"," I see the rotation going on. "
"17708600","17709300"," I can see it."
"17710580","17713800"," I can see it playing out in NASDAQ right now."
"17715400","17717500"," So I'm still long puts on spy here. "
"17719540","17723060"," I'm not going to fucking sell those things because I can see the late cycle."
"17723340","17726320"," I can see the late cycle in the background here."
"17727840","17729020"," Still long puts here. "
"17731440","17732420"," I like GME."
"17732540","17733020"," I like trading it."
"17733680","17738700"," Matter of fact AMC right now is the one to trade AMC right now looks great. "
"17740580","17742540"," AMC looks extremely bullish right now."
"17743360","17744780"," I'll show you why right now if you want to see it."
"17747880","17749840"," I'm going to get fucking blown out in this trade. "
"17749980","17751040"," I'm fucking pissed."
"17752780","17753920"," Okay so this is AMC."
"17756100","17757480"," And I want you to see this here. "
"17761550","17765530"," So sellers have teed off on this hourly trigger pretty consistently."
"17766970","17767490"," Right short."
"17768650","17769090"," Short. "
"17770830","17774830"," No big deals right even right here just fuck you in the cash market we're going to short you again."
"17776350","17777970"," Big fuck you right here."
"17778290","17780230"," And then we have a flattening action happening. "
"17781950","17784110"," Flattening when you start to see this flattening like this."
"17785010","17787450"," It's bullish but not confirmed bullish."
"17788630","17790690"," But when you start to see price. "
"17791630","17794250"," See how price has gotten above the screen line right here."
"17796030","17801630"," And it's still claiming down here we have more down to go on AMC believe it or not."
"17802150","17803050"," But it is looking squeezy. "
"17803050","17805010"," So that's the point here."
"17805150","17808090"," Sorry I'm trying to pay attention to my fucking trade."
"17809230","17811710"," So I want you to see this structure here. "
"17812230","17815150"," You got the initial squeeze up gets sold down."
"17815450","17817750"," And it's being bought right now on its hourly."
"17818330","17827470"," So the expectation here would be as long as we stay above $11.84. You have targets above of"
"17827470","17829130"," right there. "
"17829930","17830410"," 1419."
"17831450","17833010"," And the big kahuna up here."
"17836270","17837410"," 1856 on AMC. "
"17839010","17844770"," The only word of warning I would say to you on this trade is it's not done going down."
"17845010","17846310"," You've got a big boy up here."
"17846750","17851610"," I'm assuming this is what the AMC nerds are saying like oh yeah we're going all the way up here. "
"17851710","17855930"," We're going to 2472 this will be here at that point."
"17856930","17858730"," This will just do this kind of shit."
"17859690","17860150"," Goddamn. "
"17861210","17864410"," By the time we get there it'll be about 2472."
"17867990","17870830"," But it looks bullish to me right now."
"17872390","17878030"," And just looking at this stuff this stuff down here it's saying down here that we have more down to"
"17878030","17878470"," go on AMC. "
"17879330","17883790"," So even if you get the squeeze here I would still expect an attempt to sell it to the depths"
"17883790","17884150"," of hell."
"17884890","17886830"," And have new lows coming."
"17887770","17890010"," So I'm still bearish in long term on AMC. "
"17891030","17895210"," But I am bullish on a short term period on AMC right now."
"17895330","17899050"," It does look like after these three great bars on spy and NASDAQ."
"17899630","17906230"," You might get your chance here for a hedge fund to take the finger off into the end of month. "
"17907070","17910230"," And get a nice fat squeeze from the reset their shorts."
"17910830","17913770"," Their reset place is likely $25."
"17914390","17915170"," If I was hedge fund. "
"17915930","17917830"," I'd be trying to reset this price right here."
"17918050","17920870"," Twenty five dollars re hedge AMC."
"17922430","17923970"," That's horrible to say to you but. "
"17926590","17927750"," We'll back to the main screen."
"17931130","17933710"," NASDAQ trying to close up the end of the day to the upside."
"17938370","17942090"," So some still some up to go for individual tickers. "
"17943250","17948730"," I'm hoping that there's this blood down here into this close man."
"17949630","17952230"," If we don't get this today and I'm going to warn you."
"17953030","17957670"," If we don't get this down move today you're likely going to see it tomorrow. "
"17958650","17960590"," So I'm going to warn you now if you're a bull."
"17961290","17964110"," If you don't see the roll today in the close."
"17964110","17967050"," You will likely see it tomorrow okay. "
"17967250","17969790"," Even if we green bar it up and close all this bullshit up."
"17970650","17975150"," You're likely going to see a roll either today or tomorrow by open."
"17978190","17981350"," Even if we squeeze this even if we do this shit in the close. "
"17981930","17985930"," Up here you're still going to see a pretty significant roll."
"17986890","17988990"," Big roll here coming today or tomorrow."
"17989350","17990610"," I do think we squeeze this today. "
"17991410","17993490"," I'm getting fucking torched right now."
"17996980","17998940"," I'm like watching NASDAQ right now."
"17998980","18000080"," I'm like fuck me man. "
"18003720","18006060"," I would not be selling calls on GME."
"18006500","18011080"," Or maybe if they're farther dated than next week I'd sell calls on it."
"18012560","18013380"," Or AMC. "
"18013840","18014760"," I'm bullsharing AMC."
"18020050","18023710"," I'd be selling puts here for like Friday or something."
"18024390","18028050"," We sell puts on Friday below 10 bucks. "
"18029330","18031890"," Only come back and revisit that on Friday and see if I'm right."
"18032590","18036270"," Like sell some $10, send out $10 calls or not calls."
"18036830","18038030"," Sorry, $10 puts. "
"18039290","18041550"," I think a Friday expiry or something."
"18050300","18051420"," I'm not bullish here."
"18052480","18054840"," There's more I think a trend is saying down. "
"18055740","18058160"," There's like you want to know what bullish is on AMC."
"18058860","18062440"," It's like oh shit man."
"18063020","18065280"," Really you want to know what really what bullish is on AMC. "
"18066120","18067060"," Like true bullishness."
"18068420","18069820"," You're not going to believe this."
"18070220","18071280"," It's above $73. "
"18072740","18073680"," That's fucked up."
"18075340","18077100"," I'm going to get stopped out here."
"18078820","18082220"," It's above $73 for AMC for bullishness. "
"18083360","18091560"," If if if a year or two passes that number will come lower where bullishness will be like 20, 30"
"18091560","18091800"," bucks."
"18093260","18098440"," You've got like a year to two to three years to make like an actual like bullish."
"18098440","18102040"," I'm bullish on AMC has to be above $73. "
"18102420","18103000"," I don't see that."
"18103380","18104940"," I'm not I'm not in agreement with that."
"18104940","18108660"," I like trading AMC. "
"18109300","18112500"," I like trading GME, but I'm not like the Kool-Aid drinker."
"18114240","18120460"," Like it should be AMC should be like $3 and start trading it from there."
"18125890","18127010"," Still long puts. "
"18131890","18134030"," Yeah, well, I mean."
"18135690","18144330"," Even like like even Warren Kitty's like viewpoint on on GME was it was a good sound opinion."
"18145630","18150010"," Made sense, but you know when you're trading, you know, three, four, five hundred bucks. "
"18150110","18153770"," It's like we know why it's squeezing."
"18154190","18156070"," We know it's not fundamentals, right?"
"18156290","18157030"," We know it's not fundamentals."
"18158250","18163770"," Like fundamentally, it was a great price down in like $3, $5, $12, $19. "
"18164690","18171750"," It's like fundamentally like sound like AMC at 73."
"18172650","18173750"," I think."
"18176310","18178070"," I don't know like AMC. "
"18179550","18182690"," I think they need to switch their model."
"18184050","18188650"," I think that the real danger to them is kids, today's kids."
"18189050","18193990"," I don't think that the way that they survive is by Hollywood sticking with. "
"18195090","18195810"," Spectacle entertainment."
"18197290","18198790"," You don't need to know the story."
"18198950","18201930"," You can just pay attention, not pay attention, pay attention, not pay attention. "
"18202310","18206010"," And just like tuning in and being like, oh, that was fun."
"18206170","18206570"," That was cool."
"18207390","18207850"," I don't. "
"18207990","18208870"," I think cinema is dead."
"18210130","18211670"," All right, cinema as we know it is dead."
"18211850","18213710"," And I think it's only going to get worse as time goes on. "
"18214470","18217790"," I got did I've got to home get a real home theater and then a home theater."
"18218270","18218890"," Yeah, two of them."
"18220170","18224090"," And I just built a new game ring room and I put a home theater in that fucking room too. "
"18224870","18225230"," And."
"18227070","18228630"," I don't need to go to the movie theater."
"18229490","18230590"," Every once in a grand. "
"18230770","18232790"," What, matter of fact, you got a good story for you."
"18232810","18233330"," I was going to go to."
"18233550","18235890"," I was going to go see Oppenheimer. "
"18237850","18238210"," Oppenheimer."
"18238430","18243970"," I was going to go see Oppenheimer and I was going to buy tickets to like one of four movie"
"18243970","18245450"," theaters in the country to go see it."
"18246610","18249570"," Seven four seven movie theaters in the country is going to go see Oppenheimer. "
"18251250","18255610"," And I was like about to buy them and then I had some other event I had to do."
"18256110","18257630"," So I was like, fuck this amount of air."
"18257770","18258370"," This sucks. "
"18260750","18262170"," Hold on a second here."
"18262470","18264190"," Trade four cents right now and puts."
"18265050","18265450"," I'm not selling. "
"18265650","18266250"," I'm just leaving them on."
"18267030","18268510"," They just stay on until they go to zero."
"18269410","18270790"," I'm going to calls now. "
"18271510","18274730"," I'm going to squeeze out all these fucking bears myself included."
"18276210","18281670"," I try to make this fucking trade back."
"18288160","18291600"," Long four fifty two C and put still on. "
"18292340","18295540"," I'm on both sides of the market so they can go fuck themselves."
"18295760","18296820"," They can print me one way or another."
"18298000","18299040"," So Oppenheimer. "
"18299420","18300660"," I was going to go see it and."
"18301620","18304840"," On the surface it seemed like a movie that would be perfect, right?"
"18304840","18306360"," I'm going to go see Oppenheimer."
"18306540","18309440"," We're going to see it on like this like perfect screen. "
"18309460","18309900"," Perfect."
"18310040","18310740"," It's had everything."
"18311660","18315180"," Private couches like walls and all that kind of stuff. "
"18319290","18324510"," We had all kinds of like walls like walls in between a couch like two chairs that you can make"
"18324510","18325170"," into a couch."
"18325270","18331250"," They may be a chair couch and I'm like, okay, I'm going to go see this movie because of timing."
"18331250","18332050"," I couldn't go. "
"18332610","18333850"," So I didn't buy the tickets."
"18333850","18339150"," And then it started to come out that you couldn't listen to the words."
"18340090","18344050"," That it was more that mumblecore shit that he does that Nolan does. "
"18344990","18349350"," And I'm like, I'm not fucking, I'm like, I'm not fucking, I'm like, I'm not fucking going to this"
"18349350","18349710"," movie."
"18350870","18354430"," I'm probably, but Ty was done and probably cost me like a hundred bucks."
"18355090","18357410"," I'm not paying for this fucking movie to have. "
"18358150","18361930"," I'm not paying for this fucking movie to not be able to understand what the fuck they're saying."
"18362490","18363870"," So I think I'm not doing it."
"18364310","18367510"," And that was like the prime reason for me to go, right?"
"18367730","18369050"," Like great story. "
"18370150","18374950"," And then of course I found out that it wasn't actually about the building of the bomb."
"18375090","18377350"," I'm like, ah, I could pass on that on the big screen."
"18377550","18378550"," This big beautiful movie theater. "
"18379150","18382010"," I was looking for all these cool effects and all this cool stuff happening."
"18382950","18384550"," And they weren't focusing on it."
"18387730","18389490"," So sorry, I got to watch this shit. "
"18403460","18411380"," I'm selling 449 P at three cents, bought those at 16 and then 12."
"18413160","18420100"," Long calls here, third time today, 452s, I bought them at 11 cents, still owning them right now."
"18421820","18423300"," I need to payday, man. "
"18423540","18424620"," Give me a fucking payday."
"18425020","18431120"," So this Oppenheimer shit, I'm like, this Oppenheimer shit, I'm like, I'm not going to go, right?"
"18431280","18432480"," So I passed on Oppenheimer."
"18433360","18434760"," Did not go to Oppenheimer. "
"18436260","18438600"," And I'm just going to watch it in my home theater at home."
"18438960","18440440"," I'm not going to watch it in a movie theater."
"18441060","18446400"," And it's very rare that I want to see many movies today in a theater experience. "
"18447000","18454920"," For my own personal tastes, I get pulled out of movies when I see things that are too unbelievable."
"18455960","18460100"," Like if I see like the earth get blown up 30 times by the same franchise, I can't do it"
"18460100","18460320"," anymore."
"18460320","18463080"," I just cannot do it. "
"18463300","18466220"," So I can't do it."
"18466300","18467280"," I want nothing to do with it."
"18467480","18477300"," So in terms of like, I can watch a movie that's like half VFX and half real with"
"18477300","18479120"," spectacle in a movie with good writing. "
"18479500","18485000"," So for me, even personally, as an older person, I don't find much enjoyment of the movie theater"
"18485000","18485480"," these days."
"18485940","18487120"," No one's quiet the movie theater."
"18488500","18489940"," It's disgusting in there. "
"18490060","18490620"," They don't clean it."
"18491240","18493820"," The price of everything to go is obscene."
"18494200","18496940"," Like like 20, $30 for popcorn candy. "
"18497500","18498680"," So does for the kids."
"18499000","18500680"," Some of the movie theaters are good."
"18501340","18503200"," I like the Alamo have been there. "
"18503440","18506900"," I've been to some movie theater in Santa Fe at a kick-ass place."
"18507860","18509620"," But they're very hard to come by."
"18509840","18511700"," Like great movie theater experiences are very rare. "
"18511900","18512260"," So like AMC."
"18514940","18516620"," Is it going to trade $73?"
"18517140","18518340"," What does it need to trade $73?"
"18519800","18520240"," $100?"
"18521460","18522980"," $3 would be sustainable."
"18524120","18526840"," They need like, they need crowds, right?"
"18527580","18529480"," They need like crowds coming to the theater. "
"18530260","18531680"," I don't know how they get those crowds."
"18532000","18535680"," I feel like by the time these kids are like 30 years old, 20, 30 years old."
"18536760","18538820"," Like my kids have an attention span with media. "
"18538820","18542300"," That's like you're lucky if you get 15 minutes."
"18543320","18545940"," Lucky if you get 15 minutes out of a kid walk."
"18546120","18547260"," Even their favorite shit. "
"18547820","18550440"," They're like, they're on their phones watching stuff."
"18551200","18553540"," And then when they don't have their phone on them, they talk to each other."
"18554140","18554920"," Like my kids do that. "
"18555140","18556500"," Like they'll just like talk to each other."
"18557080","18558440"," They start talking in a movie."
"18558940","18560720"," They just like turn each other and start talking. "
"18561220","18562260"," They don't even listen anymore."
"18563700","18566780"," And I'm assuming that's part of the writing writers like we know that."
"18566780","18568820"," So we're not going to, we're not going to spend money in writing anymore. "
"18568900","18569500"," That's what I think."
"18569740","18577700"," But that's sweet cowboy starfish."
"18581300","18582100"," That is sweet. "
"18582560","18583260"," I've been there."
"18583800","18585160"," I've been to Los Alamos."
"18585340","18588040"," I might want my kids used to play a soccer up there. "
"18589280","18590600"," Los Alamos cool as fuck."
"18591980","18593920"," It's like a little oasis in the middle of nowhere."
"18594660","18596120"," There's a giant like chasm over there. "
"18596220","18596860"," You can go check out."
"18600600","18602160"," Yeah, it's starting right now."
"18603060","18603760"," We're squeezing. "
"18605080","18607280"," Trade in 14 on 11 cents."
"18609500","18610520"," Come on, dude."
"18610760","18612480"," And the worst part of this shit right here. "
"18614440","18618500"," We have 500,000 calls expiring in the money."
"18622380","18625620"," 500,000 right now calls expiring in the money."
"18630590","18631990"," Trade in 12 right now. "
"18632090","18632290"," Penny."
"18650760","18653400"," Carlsbad caverns, I think, are way farther south."
"18654940","18657800"," I think those are like four hours away. "
"18658420","18659720"," They're actually quite far away."
"18659980","18661960"," Maybe even farther in driving time."
"18663100","18669640"," The Los Alamos Labs are southeast of Santa Fe. "
"18670200","18673280"," I think southeast of Santa Fe."
"18673900","18674800"," Don't quote me on that."
"18674920","18675300"," Oh, no. "
"18675800","18677300"," Southwest of Santa Fe, baby."
"18677560","18678520"," I'm getting that wrong."
"18679740","18681540"," I think I'm I think I'm dead wrong on that. "
"18681620","18688400"," Southwest or just like slightly southeast or sluts or slightly southwest of the town of Santa Fe."
"18700640","18701720"," Yeah, Roswell."
"18701860","18702300"," I've been there too. "
"18702380","18702980"," Been Roswell."
"18703380","18705560"," I thought I'd get more out of Roswell than I did."
"18706340","18707280"," I was kind of boring. "
"18708380","18713120"," I think the blast sites are down there, but then the the the building was north."
"18714180","18716480"," The building was like north closer to Santa Fe."
"18727180","18729600"," And Los Alamos, like a short drive from Santa Fe. "
"18730080","18734440"," You drive through these not there's like national mountains of our national forest of some kind."
"18735320","18736700"," It's this really small town."
"18736880","18737660"," You drive up in a town. "
"18737760","18740840"," There's like a giant building that you're like, what is this?"
"18741160","18743840"," And it's like it's like big radar station of some kind."
"18744300","18746060"," And you drive through like a main street."
"18747120","18749560"," Then there's it's around the town surrounds the base. "
"18750100","18752340"," And then you can go around and hike and bike and shit."
"18753540","18755560"," There's a bunch of like waterfalls up there."
"18755760","18756780"," And there's a cat. "
"18757000","18757160"," There's a."
"18758880","18760620"," Not as not a crevasse."
"18760740","18762400"," It's like a collapsed volcano."
"18763000","18764320"," Or no, I think they said a meteor. "
"18764600","18765880"," I think they said a meteor hit it."
"18766500","18767640"," Or it's a collapsed volcano."
"18767640","18769560"," I can't remember a caldera. "
"18770020","18770540"," That's what it is."
"18770740","18771360"," Collapse volcano."
"18771740","18772480"," It's caldera. "
"18774800","18779400"," And you look down into that thing and it's like 20 miles away, but it looks like it's just a"
"18779400","18781460"," looks like it's 500 yards away from your face."
"18785620","18786840"," Glad right now calls."
"18787280","18788400"," Dude, I might stop trading today. "
"18790100","18791400"," I might just stop trading."
"18794080","18796740"," Glad on calls right now, even that big squeeze right there."
"18797120","18797960"," No money. "
"18799340","18801460"," Now I'm down a penny on calls here."
"18802660","18803820"," Might just stop trading here."

"19032410","19032970"," this right here."
"19035530","19043050"," $4.57.06, $4.57.506. We know that we're going there."
"19043190","19046850"," We know that we're going to squeeze up here and smash and talk to these guys. "
"19047590","19048930"," We know they're up here."
"19049070","19049750"," We know where they are."
"19049810","19051910"," We know these guys are liars over here. "
"19053230","19055210"," So I'm long calls here for this close."
"19056570","19062450"," If we do it today, tomorrow or Friday, I should have just bought some fucking call spreads for"
"19062450","19062730"," Tuesday."
"19065530","19066990"," We confirmed bullish. "
"19068310","19071110"," But a one minute right here, a reversal to the upside."
"19073990","19076250"," The one hour has not confirmed."
"19076950","19078010"," So I want to show you this. "
"19080790","19083430"," I want you to see this if you're a bull."
"19084490","19089450"," You know, they squeeze this up and then immediately get sold down to test."
"19091170","19091710"," 4467. "
"19092710","19093790"," It's 4700."
"19093910","19095930"," So be aware of this into Friday."
"19096510","19100210"," If they pull any of this, if they pull any of this hanky panky in the overnight. "
"19100850","19104990"," In the pre market in like over the weekend, you get it up there."
"19105570","19106810"," That kind of stuff."
"19107270","19108830"," So call spreads are your friends. "
"19114720","19118760"," Dude, what is going on with these fucking calls?"
"19119720","19120480"," Seriously."
"19121200","19121600"," Sorry about that."
"19124100","19127460"," So upside target into Tuesday. "
"19128680","19129440"," Remains."
"19132300","19133900"," Let me see if I get this right here."
"19134040","19135700"," Make sure that's right. "
"19140380","19144140"," Upside target into Tuesday, 456, 91."
"19145460","19147520"," On spy specifically."
"19148880","19149960"," Tuesday. "
"19152380","19154180"," Or 455, 91."
"19157760","19160080"," So I said this was Friday target to make it Tuesday."
"19161140","19163320"," There's your Tuesday target right there. "
"19172000","19176640"," Tuesday target, 455, 76, 4591."
"19177380","19179280"," There's more to go up here."
"19180080","19181320"," You've got like a range. "
"19186910","19189670"," You've got this range by Tuesday that you could do."
"19189810","19192210"," This would be retesting the previous highs."
"19193010","19194810"," There's, but I think it's going to take longer. "
"19195030","19196390"," I don't think you actually get that."
"19196650","19202790"," I think it's going to take you until September 12th to 15th to actually tag this upper target."
"19203330","19205070"," I don't think you get that right now. "
"19205230","19208090"," I'm going to be a conservative in my bias there."
"19208090","19212370"," I do think that's between now and Friday."
"19213110","19214370"," You get the squeeze up. "
"19215570","19217070"," Into this 454."
"19217950","19222430"," I think when you grab that 454 squeeze, we're going to roll back down."
"19223130","19225630"," Try that 447 and go higher. "
"19225970","19227290"," So let me draw that out for you."
"19232220","19238220"," Let me draw this out for you for what that expectation looks like."
"19245850","19247810"," Whether that takes today or tomorrow. "
"19251770","19252210"," 31st."
"19252450","19253810"," Is that really what we're doing?"
"19253930","19254530"," That's 31st."
"19255270","19257510"," I don't know, man. "
"19257850","19259250"," Can we crank up there on Friday?"
"19259550","19260790"," Can we actually go up there Friday?"
"19261330","19262170"," Can we actually do that?"
"19266510","19268510"," We actually have 31st right there."
"19269050","19271630"," I'm still going to go with my initial summation here."
"19273470","19274710"," There's Tuesday Friday. "
"19274990","19275750"," Tuesday we're back."
"19276550","19277190"," Damn, dude."
"19279330","19281270"," It just wants to go, doesn't it?"
"19285150","19286590"," Hold on a second here. "
"19287190","19288210"," I'm watching this right now."
"19288310","19290390"," I'm like, this fucking thing just wants to explode."
"19292350","19293510"," Hold on a second here. "
"19297540","19299160"," So this will be next week sometime."
"19299820","19300580"," Hold on a second here."
"19300580","19302320"," I got a 15 minute chart. "
"19303700","19304780"," This thing wants to rip."
"19304900","19306340"," It's ripped fucking faces off."
"19308200","19310620"," I got the Tuesday target right here. "
"19310900","19312080"," That's Tuesday right there, right?"
"19313220","19316580"," This fucking thing just wants to go fucking on Friday."
"19316580","19318460"," Be like, hey, fuck you or Tuesday."
"19318820","19319660"," Oh, fuck you there. "
"19320980","19321660"," I'm honest."
"19321920","19322560"," I'll be honest there."
"19322660","19324340"," It just wants to go fuck you straight up. "
"19329520","19330260"," Squeeze it up."
"19330260","19330340"," All right."
"19332080","19332960"," Tomorrow close. "
"19335780","19336820"," Dude, I'm serious."
"19337040","19342720"," You might have a down day on Sunday and then Monday you're going to get that fucking cranker right"
"19342720","19345580"," there into next Friday right there."
"19345640","19346040"," It's the target. "
"19347480","19350000"," I'm going to check this really quick and make sure I'm right on this."
"19354120","19354780"," Yeah, dude."
"19355100","19355920"," Look at that move. "
"19356080","19356680"," Look at those moves."
"19357780","19359400"," That's insane right there."
"19363100","19365040"," That's like Tuesday target right there. "
"19365240","19366160"," I mean, just look at that shit."
"19366340","19366700"," Fuck that."
"19366820","19367360"," We're just going to do it. "
"19368300","19369120"," It's right there."
"19369200","19369800"," You can see it."
"19372520","19374100"," You can actually see it right here. "
"19375140","19376060"," Oh, damn."
"19379480","19380220"," It's so violent."
"19381340","19381900"," Just look at that. "
"19384080","19386000"," It's like squeeze this close here."
"19386260","19387240"," Come back down on Friday."
"19387240","19387540"," Close. "
"19387820","19388560"," Wake up on Tuesday."
"19389220","19390120"," Hello, ladies."
"19390340","19390660"," Right there. "
"19390860","19391260"," Whoop."
"19393160","19393640"," Whoop."
"19395060","19399560"," If we do that for fifty nine, that would be the craziness right there. "
"19400240","19401160"," I'll give it to you."
"19401200","19401560"," How about that?"
"19401840","19402840"," I'll give you that."
"19402920","19403840"," If you're a bull. "
"19406080","19408520"," Tuesday target for fifty nine ninety two."
"19408680","19409520"," No fucking way."
"19412380","19413740"," No fucking way. "
"19414100","19415280"," Tuesday target right there."
"19415280","19416640"," There it is."
"19419560","19420520"," You're a beer dude. "
"19420800","19422280"," You got a lot of selling to do."
"19422480","19424360"," You got a whole bunch of selling to do."
"19426060","19427260"," This is going to look insane. "
"19434790","19436610"," This is going to look insane right here."
"19438770","19439650"," Holy shit."
"19442810","19443250"," Okay. "
"19444330","19445110"," Over the weekend."
"19445890","19446650"," Well, you should get a week."
"19447150","19448110"," Do you like seriously?"
"19451030","19454110"," I'm going to have to buy some calls tomorrow. "
"19457070","19458490"," Let me go back and look at that again."
"19460990","19462150"," Thirty first, man."
"19464910","19466450"," There's Friday right there, right?"
"19466730","19469470"," Friday low and Friday and then rip faces off over the weekend. "
"19470310","19471210"," Oh, damn."
"19476800","19478880"," Thursday update Friday down day."
"19479660","19480680"," Bloodbath into Friday. "
"19482980","19485900"," And then wake up on Tuesday and we're at four fifty nine."
"19486140","19487520"," I don't know if that's going to happen."
"19488200","19491420"," That seems so out of that seems so unbelievable to me. "
"19492140","19493160"," I think we get a failure."
"19498320","19499820"," Okay, sold calls."
"19501020","19501900"," Right now. "
"19502140","19503540"," No more trades for me for the rest of the day."
"19505420","19508160"," I'm probably going to buy some calls for."
"19510020","19510540"," Friday. "
"19512380","19513600"," Friday for Thursday."
"19516820","19517860"," Too late."
"19518100","19520060"," Like I'm looking at this right now and I'm like, really?"
"19520580","19521680"," You're saying we're going to. "
"19521680","19523400"," I mean, look at this right here."
"19525060","19526460"," I mean, this would be it, right?"
"19527420","19529240"," They get a little bit of a dip down here."
"19529440","19531180"," Like kind of a bloodbath down here. "
"19532020","19533820"," A little bit more dipage."
"19534880","19535900"," I mean, look at this again."
"19540080","19541480"," That happened right there. "
"19543320","19545940"," I have a real question mark about this here."
"19549590","19551610"," I have a real question mark about that."
"19551610","19555830"," It's like one, two, and then three. "
"19557410","19558970"," Let me go back and check this out."
"19561950","19564850"," One, two, three."
"19566150","19567590"," Jesus, not even a three bar trade. "
"19567730","19570190"," It's like a fucking nine session, like up move."
"19571590","19572690"," Yeah, I guess so."
"19574030","19575330"," I guess so. "
"19576390","19579210"," Or do I just wait for that to happen and then take that?"
"19579210","19580090"," I don't know."
"19584700","19585600"," Tough call here."
"19591280","19592560"," Yeah, it's a tough call. "
"19592720","19593720"," It's a tough place here."
"19594000","19596360"," I'm like, I'm flat right now."
"19596440","19597140"," I got nothing on. "
"19597340","19598340"," I got torch today."
"19599080","19600220"," I got nothing on."
"19600840","19601560"," I got no trades. "
"19601800","19602820"," And this is garbage in here."
"19602960","19603440"," All this shit."
"19603740","19605400"," It's like, I got hammered. "
"19605660","19606140"," Well, not hammered."
"19607480","19608460"," Lost a grand or so."
"19608600","19609700"," So maybe a little bit more than a grand. "
"19617400","19618380"," End of month as well."
"19618540","19621920"," Yeah, I see the end of, I see the end of reason."
"19622160","19624420"," I said the end of month like window dressing stuff. "
"19624600","19625720"," I can see it in GME."
"19626300","19630120"," I can see it in AMC is going up right now too."
"19630200","19630800"," It's it's blasting. "
"19632520","19635630"," I think it's blasting me."
"19635710","19635770"," Look."
"19637510","19638850"," Yeah, it's starting to go up again. "
"19642020","19643320"," I'm checking right now."
"19644040","19646020"," I'm not a little guy down there doing its thing."
"19646020","19650360"," Just trucking along bounced off that 1214 now trading 1277. "
"19654360","19656040"," Just just trucking right along."
"19660210","19661470"," Yeah, I don't know."
"19661730","19666330"," It wouldn't surprise me to see we come back on Tuesday and they just sell that market. "
"19666650","19671590"," Like they sell that 459 on like the Tuesday that you come back."
"19672370","19675130"," Like instant sell, get a nice fat low for the month."
"19678330","19678870"," I'm losing. "
"19679130","19679810"," I'm a loser today."
"19680250","19680590"," Guaranteed."
"19680670","19680970"," I'm a loser. "
"19681510","19682330"," I haven't even looked at it."
"19682330","19682730"," I didn't want to look."
"19682890","19683670"," I'm angry right now. "
"19684510","19685810"," I'm definitely a loser today."
"19688810","19689530"," Yeah, yeah."
"19690370","19692030"," Like I feel like the news. "
"19692530","19696470"," Like I feel like if we were in a low and they got the news on Friday, that would pop."
"19705470","19706830"," Yeah, that's what I've got to."
"19708190","19708550"," Zazandran. "
"19708730","19709390"," Let me show you this."
"19712290","19713010"," So Zazandran."
"19713150","19714010"," Let me talk to you real quick. "
"19714550","19715810"," I'm going to show you this on an hourly."
"19716150","19716210"," Okay."
"19718830","19719390"," Hold on. "
"19719510","19722210"," I think it's clear that maybe let me do something different alone."
"19725470","19728310"," I agree with you, but I don't think we're done with the role yet."
"19728770","19729590"," Let me explain it better. "
"19732250","19733890"," I'm just going to put this on dates here."
"19737420","19738420"," Maybe a quick second brother."
"19762240","19764140"," So Zazandran, just take a look at this here with me. "
"19764240","19764340"," Okay."
"19766520","19770400"," So this is kind of like your last, your last sellers, right?"
"19770660","19771000"," Like here."
"19773940","19775660"," Right where we are right now, right?"
"19780360","19782380"," This is where your squeeze is, right?"
"19783320","19784820"," Big old squeeze zone right here. "
"19787420","19788580"," Say a closer look."
"19792020","19797820"," So my thought process, Zazandran here is that we squeeze up, right?"
"19799680","19800160"," Sold down."
"19801260","19804200"," I give the failure on the squeeze instead of the squeeze happening. "
"19805760","19808940"," And then we break through this, believe it or not."
"19810100","19811940"," And it gets pulled back up."
"19815760","19818400"," But all this structure is good right here. "
"19818700","19820200"," The half an hour is coming up."
"19820360","19825460"," The hourly is coming up for a little long and mellow to the upside here."
"19825600","19827980"," We're at 56 right now. "
"19828960","19832320"," So we're a little long in the tooth on mellow to the upside."
"19832320","19836300"," What I would really like to see brother would be."
"19836940","19839420"," I'd really like to see like that squeeze here. "
"19840760","19845960"," And then some kind of a failure, like a, like a, like a turnaround Tuesday or something."
"19848060","19849740"," Blast up here, consolidate."
"19850240","19851520"," Here's September 1st right here. "
"19853220","19858600"," This one rolls down and then you actually get your push higher and then the, the higher push here."
"19865440","19868820"," And I'm kind of like, and I see what you're saying down here, man."
"19870720","19872140"," So expect a roll. "
"19874860","19877040"," Tomorrow overnight or by open tomorrow."
"19877320","19878520"," We're either going to get the squeeze up."
"19879300","19880860"," Roll this in tomorrow. "
"19884720","19886460"," Or you begin to roll in the overnight."
"19888840","19891020"," That's, I think I'm still showing that on this chart."
"19891020","19893700"," So let's look at, let's go back and just look at this. "
"19893780","19894220"," We will chart."
"19903300","19906040"," You know, this hourly trigger and this daily trigger is right here."
"19906500","19907500"," So this is the. "
"19909160","19910260"," That's your daily by."
"19913620","19914840"," That's your hourly by."
"19916980","19923080"," I mean, this is the, this is the lowest by here. "
"19923080","19925980"," And that's the biggest one down there, like blood bath, that shit."
"19926560","19928880"," That's also a half back trade on this stuff right here."
"19928880","19930300"," So let's see the half back on this. "
"19931060","19932140"," Erase most of that."
"19932480","19933220"," Come down here."
"19934140","19935080"," Erase most of that. "
"19935740","19939560"," Unless I guess if you're a bear and you think we're going to erase the entire move, then do a"
"19939560","19940860"," huge bounce into the weekend."
"19942340","19942780"," But."
"19946020","19946900"," Right now. "
"19948060","19949880"," It's not proving itself to me."
"19950960","19953020"," I guess you're saying this is the top."
"19953200","19954280"," We don't get this squeeze here. "
"19954520","19955380"," Like none of this happens."
"19958520","19959700"," I don't have a trade here."
"19959820","19961480"," I want a trade down here like that. "
"19961660","19962400"," I want this trade."
"19962960","19964780"," I want that trade."
"19964980","19965740"," I want that trade. "
"19966500","19968800"," Trying to like, I'm trying to make nickels up here."
"19969660","19973180"," And they're taking me for fucking 15 cents trying to make nickels."
"19980380","19982600"," Like they're just like squeeze me for nickels here. "
"19983480","19985140"," Or I'm trying to make nickels."
"19986040","19989540"," Trying to grab this last little, this last little squeeze up here."
"19989540","19990860"," Because I know I'm going to sell that. "
"19993520","19995200"," Or I want to, I want to sell that."
"19995820","19997800"," I want to sell this R2 if I can."
"20006020","20007900"," I think this is still valid though. "
"20010360","20016320"," What I don't like about this is if it happens at like nine a.m. If this shit happens here"
"20016320","20020840"," at nine a.m. Or six a.m. we're up there."
"20022600","20025740"," Then we wake up at nine a.m. and it's like, yeah, fuck you."
"20026300","20027400"," We're going down now. "
"20029900","20032400"," Like nine 30 sitting right there."
"20033260","20034440"," That didn't help me, right?"
"20035320","20036200"," No buyers."
"20036580","20037600"," They're going to be wanting to sell this. "
"20041640","20043740"," This looks like fucking dealers, man."
"20044260","20045640"," Not wanting to pay this shit."
"20047240","20049280"," Like they want to go there, but they don't want to pay it. "
"20050580","20051600"," That's what it looks like to me."
"20060380","20062180"," Not enough juice, not enough money."
"20069360","20071580"," If we get the puts out of our system, there were winners. "
"20073340","20075840"," I, just today, dude, I told myself, I'll never buy puts again."
"20076280","20076700"," Like I'll just wait."
"20078980","20080300"," Yeah, garbage day for me too. "
"20080480","20081140"," I got a bad day today."
"20087180","20087900"," Thanks for your insight."
"20087900","20088940"," We had the puts of our system. "
"20089160","20090680"," We lost two or three trades probably."
"20090880","20093000"," I lost three trades."
"20093720","20095400"," I've lost three out of four trades today. "
"20096760","20101660"," Not zeros, but I got taken for two of them pretty low."
"20101840","20103540"," I got fucking taken pretty low in two trades."
"20103860","20105460"," The other one I didn't look didn't lose. "
"20105620","20107080"," I think I lost 50% on one of them."
"20110040","20111440"," Yeah, kids got picked up today."
"20115510","20116990"," Yeah, this is garbage to me. "
"20117050","20117870"," I want nothing to do with it."
"20118470","20119990"," I want nothing to do with it."
"20120570","20124430"," They're not taking back all the shit that I've made the past week, so they can go fuck themselves. "
"20125290","20126470"," I'm keeping all that money."
"20130510","20131890"," Yeah, same, same, same, bro."
"20132890","20134870"," It's like, it's like, how do we roll here?"
"20135210","20136150"," Do we roll here?"
"20137450","20138550"," Or do we roll here?"
"20138790","20139270"," Where is it?"
"20142520","20144840"," If we squeeze here into the close. "
"20147160","20149760"," Let's say we squeeze up or in the overnight we squeeze up."
"20149920","20151400"," Do I have a trade here if it starts to sell?"
"20151780","20151860"," No."
"20153180","20155380"," I'm going to get paid on calls for tomorrow here. "
"20155560","20155800"," No."
"20158200","20159220"," So I got no trade."
"20159540","20159980"," I got shit. "
"20162820","20165120"," I got nothing on a cash market trade."
"20165580","20168560"," Like I got like small part of my brain is like by calls for tomorrow."
"20170680","20173060"," I already know the best trade for me is. "
"20174800","20175780"," Buying that hourly trigger."
"20176040","20182760"," So that's my best, like high paying 300%, 500% trade."
"20183120","20185300"," So I'm going to let this one go. "
"20185860","20187880"," I don't normally let these go, but I'm going to let this one go today."
"20190180","20191220"," I'm going to let this shit go."
"20191340","20192100"," I'm not going to over trade it. "
"20192160","20194500"," I'm not going to not give him back my fucking money to anybody."
"20195220","20195860"," Fuck you."
"20202800","20203780"," Yeah, yeah, exactly. "
"20214270","20215810"," I want nothing to do with it."
"20216070","20217170"," Not a goddamn thing."
"20217790","20219330"," See you guys are saying in chat on YouTube. "
"20226700","20227960"," Yeah, I want nothing to do with it."
"20229260","20230980"," I can already see it in other sectors."
"20231380","20234480"," I'm looking right now at tickers that are being pumped up in the background. "
"20235520","20237280"," I don't want to fuck around with this as it happens."
"20243180","20243760"," What do you got?"
"20243860","20244380"," You got to pull."
"20244540","20244880"," What do you got here?"
"20244880","20245900"," After the summer, OPEC. "
"20246080","20247340"," So in three weeks, we're each 3500."
"20247480","20248300"," What event will cause that?"
"20249600","20252880"," Purple, Tom, student loans, government shutdown and spending black swan events."
"20254460","20255900"," All right, Camille, chill out. "
"20264100","20265100"," Kill out Camille."
"20266160","20268400"," We said we gave you 10 minutes earlier, Camille."
"20277720","20279660"," I just want you to drive bar, please. "
"20280000","20281700"," Should you do a poll on how everybody do today?"
"20282420","20283520"," Might be a good idea."
"20283660","20284460"," Green for three 11."
"20284920","20286880"," Everyone dollars see that as a win could have been worse. "
"20287740","20289640"," I was up on puts today, too."
"20289760","20290240"," I was actually up."
"20290420","20293660"," I was up from six about 16 and 12. "
"20294200","20297000"," We went to 23 cents and I didn't fucking sell."
"20298280","20301160"," I wanted you guys want to know that number is 34 cents."
"20301600","20303380"," That's what I wanted was 34 cents. "
"20310750","20311750"," I got you, Camille."
"20316390","20317370"," He's like, sorry, cab."
"20317990","20319050"," I'm going to write it in a little bit. "
"20320250","20320810"," Hold on here."
"20322230","20323530"," Hold on one quick second here."
"20337990","20339350"," I'm taking a bath today. "
"20342290","20345190"," I'll take I'm going to drink some whiskey and ice and we'll be angry about it."
"20347990","20349190"," Things do look bad, though."
"20349330","20350510"," For the end of the day, move not going to lie. "
"20350730","20352990"," I hope my swing prints swing prints through."
"20353970","20355610"," Four to six, six level."
"20356670","20357890"," Would be a nice chef's kiss. "
"20358050","20358570"," Agreed with that."
"20360530","20361430"," What's the gray level?"
"20361610","20364570"," That is a hidden trigger."
"20365310","20366230"," Send them a hand say. "
"20366470","20367230"," Send them a bad idea."
"20367290","20367790"," I agree with that."
"20368370","20369550"," That's what you guys are saying here. "
"20371470","20372090"," End of month."
"20372310","20374330"," Yeah, I see they had a month trade going on right now."
"20375410","20376690"," And I don't want to fuck around with it. "
"20377850","20380350"," I got no, I don't want to get caught up in the end of the month."
"20380350","20380790"," Pull shit."
"20380990","20381810"," I can already see it. "
"20381930","20382930"," I'm like looking at it right now."
"20383650","20385650"," I'm watching it in the background happen right now."
"20386730","20390730"," I see him fucking pumping individual sectors up and tickers and baskets. "
"20392310","20394610"," And meanwhile, they're just they got dealers."
"20394910","20396110"," They're just like fuck you on spy."
"20396630","20397950"," So what am I going to do?"
"20398450","20399170"," Shit, I can do. "
"20400170","20402010"," I guess I get trade individual ticker."
"20402230","20403230"," We could trade AMC."
"20405170","20406710"," We could go to the dark side. "
"20410350","20412330"," We could go to the dark side and trade AMC."
"20415150","20416290"," We could put some."
"20418210","20421310"," Some Friday texts zero dates on. "
"20422350","20424390"," On high beta stocks like AMC."
"20425310","20426910"," For those fucking things, costume."
"20434270","20437030"," Does AMC have an expiry coming up tomorrow?"
"20439050","20439830"," Nope. "
"20441090","20443270"," Next expiry September one."
"20448710","20451490"," Oh, there's 29,000 calls."
"20455740","20457060"," For September one. "
"20457620","20457780"," Hmm."
"20458320","20458940"," No wonder why."
"20460160","20461960"," I guess I guess I'm not the only one looking at AMC. "
"20462640","20465660"," They're trading 53 or 56."
"20466200","20468660"," So basically 54 55."
"20470580","20472940"," I have to think about that AMC trade. "
"20476950","20478830"," So those don't close until."
"20480590","20482590"," Those don't close until Tuesday."
"20484030","20485250"," But actually is a Friday. "
"20486370","20486870"," Hmm."
"20489230","20490410"," Need to get some more interest."
"20490610","20491830"," Need a little bloodbath in AMC. "
"20491830","20495410"," Take those calls down to like five cents and make them buy more."
"20499950","20503840"," Make them buy more."
"20505420","20507400"," So they can feed off each other. "
"20508120","20510000"," You guys know how that works, right?"
"20511060","20513600"," Like need call buyers on these stocks to."
"20514940","20516440"," They're like betting with themselves."
"20517800","20519480"," They're actually eating each other. "
"20525050","20526010"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"20526210","20527450"," Look at fucking USO."
"20528550","20530190"," Keep on pumping USO. "
"20530310","20531810"," Give me that last fucking out move."
"20533550","20536210"," Give me 75 bucks on USO, please."
"20545430","20546570"," Take it easy, lead farmer. "
"20550030","20551930"," Pay at the highs and lows in advance tomorrow cap."
"20552230","20552910"," Ready tomorrow."
"20554330","20555430"," Expectations for lows. "
"20558630","20560410"," 448 on spy."
"20561190","20563730"," You can go as low as 445."
"20565550","20568410"," On spy expectations to the upside for tomorrow. "
"20569530","20570970"," For 50."
"20571910","20573210"," Make sure I get this right."
"20576050","20577630"," Upside target for tomorrow. "
"20577930","20578490"," 454."
"20579490","20581810"," There is a possibility of an extension."
"20582950","20583910"," To. "
"20586530","20591650"," An extension to 458 or 459 by Friday."
"20591650","20592370"," It is."
"20592930","20595690"," It is possible, but not probable. "
"20598210","20600170"," Probably into Friday."
"20603900","20606860"," So there's your target for Tuesday right here."
"20609720","20611080"," So there you go. "
"20611180","20612100"," You guys will see this."
"20612200","20613300"," You can take a screenshot of this."
"20617940","20619280"," Saying all of this. "
"20620560","20622260"," Because we're where we are."
"20624680","20626100"," That wouldn't shock me."
"20626480","20627520"," That wouldn't shock me. "
"20627720","20629940"," And then this larger move next week."
"20632760","20634360"," Your race all this crap."
"20634720","20636660"," You actually get the big move next week. "
"20636660","20639200"," So that's Tuesday, not Monday."
"20642540","20645640"," This role could come here or above."
"20646060","20647920"," It's it's not a good place for retailers. "
"20648840","20650800"," It's kind of a shitty place for retailers here."
"20652220","20655640"," Like 30 points just to get that 30 points."
"20656580","20658260"," For a known role coming. "
"20658600","20659420"," I don't know, man."
"20661120","20662900"," I got, I got a real tough."
"20663220","20670000"," I feel like this is like late in the game for a bull. "
"20670960","20673460"," That's why that's what my feeling is late in the game."
"20675900","20678060"," So when I say late in the game, I mean."
"20679840","20680840"," Can we go there?"
"20680980","20681180"," Yes. "
"20681640","20683660"," Is it worth the pennies to pick up."
"20684260","20685920"," When you shouldn't buy in the dip and risk."
"20687140","20688240"," Is my point. "
"20689900","20692020"," Does it doesn't even matter if we go there."
"20693100","20697040"," Because you still want that pullback to take the larger trade to go higher."
"20698720","20700260"," I have like a mixed. "
"20704340","20706560"," Like I'm still bullish here, but is it worth."
"20706940","20709000"," Is it worth me getting cut up to go there."
"20717350","20719070"," I'm trying to read what you guys are saying here. "
"20719070","20722850"," I think this is like individual ticker trading time."
"20725030","20725670"," That's my guess."
"20726390","20726890"," Hey, thanks. "
"20727010","20727370"," Come out, man."
"20727450","20727890"," I love you, brother."
"20728730","20729710"," You have to tip me, man. "
"20729810","20730490"," I appreciate the tip."
"20730730","20731350"," You don't have to tip me, brother."
"20733970","20735350"," I appreciate the tip, come out. "
"20736850","20737630"," I love you, man."
"20739870","20740970"," Hit the likes, please."
"20746870","20748170"," Do you want to shut up the computer?"
"20749050","20749770"," I've done that. "
"20752230","20757670"," I have had really bad emotional losses on a lot of money in the past."
"20758330","20759810"," That's not a lot of money, though, so."
"20762550","20765890"," If you start taking six figure losses, I'll tell you what you do. "
"20766050","20766550"," You want to know."
"20767510","20768410"," I've done that."
"20769590","20774030"," I've taken multiple five figure losses multiple like. "
"20774930","20775710"," I've lost."
"20777190","20778750"," Maybe a hundred times."
"20778970","20780810"," I've lost five figures, six figures. "
"20780830","20782710"," I've only done it two or three times."
"20793790","20795230"," Nobody got pulled up chase."
"20795470","20796450"," We bought that bottom, brother. "
"20796750","20799010"," We made bank like I made stupid bank."
"20801450","20804790"," I'm still making money on a call spread, so for where we are."
"20808400","20809280"," I love you, Camille. "
"20810460","20814020"," I did that shit like ten years ago."
"20814120","20815020"," How long ago was that?"
"20815620","20816780"," Pot stocks was like what?"
"20817120","20818920"," 2016 or 17, wasn't it?"
"20819460","20820120"," It was a long time ago."
"20820520","20821860"," A long time ago, pot stocks. "
"20826060","20827180"," What have I done, maybe?"
"20827780","20830460"," Shit, I haven't traded for months at a time after those losses."
"20832340","20834880"," I've broke a desk down to fucking Kenlan."
"20835640","20837420"," Like an old school Oakwood desk. "
"20838040","20838540"," I've done that."
"20840300","20842180"," I impacted my personal life."
"20843980","20844460"," Relationships. "
"20844920","20847180"," I felt like complete failure."
"20847840","20848820"," That kind of stuff."
"20849560","20850180"," Yeah, I've done that. "
"20854980","20857260"," Who do you talk to about those six figure losses?"
"20857780","20858720"," Not many people."
"20860420","20863220"," I can't talk about it with my real life friends."
"20863720","20864440"," They wouldn't understand. "
"20864980","20866760"," They don't understand small losses."
"20867980","20870460"," My friends wouldn't understand $1,000 loss."
"20870960","20874680"," They wouldn't understand $5,000 loss, $20,000 loss. "
"20875160","20878920"," When you try to do that, they become ostracized from your friends, so you don't bring it up."
"20879620","20880200"," That's truth."
"20881840","20885820"," Normally, I talk to people that I'm training with or investing with stuff like that. "
"20886240","20887100"," I'll tell them if they take a loss."
"20887960","20889120"," How bad the loss is."
"20889500","20890040"," That kind of stuff. "
"20890220","20890680"," Other people."
"20891760","20896520"," But I don't talk to loved ones and I do not talk to my friends that don't know what I"
"20896520","20896680"," do."
"20897340","20898480"," They know what I do. "
"20899140","20903580"," They know I make my living, but they don't know what that entails."
"20905140","20906480"," In any way, shape or form."
"20906480","20907920"," I've made that mistake. "
"20907980","20908920"," Don't do that."
"20909440","20910800"," Do not tell your friends."
"20911240","20911740"," Do not. "
"20912380","20913960"," You'll ostracize friends too."
"20915100","20916600"," Not only will they think that you're crazy."
"20917380","20918200"," They'll think you're reckless. "
"20918600","20920960"," They'll think that you're a bad person."
"20921300","20922700"," They'll think all kinds of really weird shit."
"20923900","20927780"," You'll tell that you're treated differently forever. "
"20928280","20929840"," If anything bad ever happens to you."
"20930220","20930860"," Let's take a divorce."
"20931880","20933640"," You're going to get people speculating that. "
"20934060","20935280"," That's what it was due to."
"20935980","20937440"," That person is a poor."
"20938360","20940340"," They have poor morals and values. "
"20940600","20941680"," They're gambling all day long."
"20941920","20942760"," Don't ever do that."
"20942880","20944160"," If you're wanting to know that. "
"20944280","20946480"," Don't go off telling your fucking parents and your fucking buddy."
"20947060","20950480"," Do not ever tell anybody that works a real job."
"20952500","20957080"," These people work their asses off all day every day for what they have. "
"20958240","20961060"," They don't understand anything about what we do."
"20962020","20963020"," Don't ever do that."
"20963020","20964220"," I've done that before. "
"20964420","20964880"," It's not good."
"20965900","20967740"," Don't ever tell them they're but your winnings either."
"20968120","20970020"," This is another thing that I tell you guys on the upside. "
"20970740","20971820"," Do not ever tell."
"20972660","20974640"," You can say I did great in the market or something."
"20974880","20976720"," But don't tell them like oh I just made 100k. "
"20977480","20978900"," Don't tell somebody made 50k."
"20979460","20982880"," Those fucking people work their balls off year round."
"20983380","20985320"," And you're going to tell them you made their salary. "
"20985980","20986800"," Don't tell them that."
"20986880","20987380"," It's not nice."
"20988280","20989900"," You're being mean to those people. "
"20990220","20990980"," It's not nice to do."
"20992580","20997360"," So there's a sword that doesn't pay you."
"20998240","20999740"," It doesn't pay on either end. "
"21000580","21003040"," It doesn't pay you to tell them your losses."
"21003060","21004720"," It doesn't pay to tell them your winnings."
"21005480","21006540"," So do not tell people. "
"21007140","21007900"," You can tell people."
"21008100","21009380"," Tell your friends and shit that you trade with."
"21010080","21011020"," Tell your trading partner. "
"21011320","21011840"," Tell your mentor."
"21012640","21013160"," Whatever that is."
"21013440","21014580"," Don't go fucking telling your friends. "
"21015820","21016440"," I'm telling you."
"21016520","21016920"," I'm warning you."
"21024140","21024960"," It's very true. "
"21025140","21025480"," I've done it."
"21025740","21026940"," It's not cool."
"21034610","21035630"," It's not cool. "
"21035850","21036410"," It's not cool."
"21036550","21038070"," It doesn't help you in any way."
"21038190","21039010"," It doesn't help you. "
"21040170","21041290"," Just go live your life."
"21042350","21045570"," It sucks to be you that you can't go unload on somebody."
"21046670","21047450"," But don't do it. "
"21047550","21048590"," Don't even do it to your best friends."
"21049730","21050970"," They're either not going to believe you."
"21051810","21055630"," If you say I made 100k in this trade this week. "
"21056530","21057690"," They're either not going to believe you."
"21057890","21060030"," If they see it, then they're going to be jealous."
"21061950","21067670"," And if they see you lost $100,000, they're going to look at you and say, why didn't you take"
"21067670","21069870"," the $100,000 and do something else with it?"
"21070750","21074250"," If I ever made $100,000, I'd pay down my school debt. "
"21075230","21076850"," I would, you know, all the I would."
"21077030","21077790"," That's what I've heard too."
"21077870","21079530"," Like I would do this and I would do that. "
"21079530","21084290"," And I'm like, you have no fucking idea what you're talking about."
"21086350","21088030"," But you say, why bother?"
"21093130","21094970"," Yeah, there's no bother there."
"21097850","21099530"," You don't win in any of those situations. "
"21100370","21101030"," You don't win."
"21101230","21101830"," There's like no winning."
"21121760","21122840"," That's another part of it. "
"21123520","21124920"," So here's an example."
"21125080","21125480"," You want an example?"
"21126140","21127200"," I have an example for you."
"21127740","21128880"," This is actually a true example. "
"21128880","21130140"," So who just said that?"
"21130520","21132640"," If you can gamble that 20k, why not give it to me instead?"
"21133080","21135660"," So this is another topic here."
"21136320","21137380"," This is a good topic."
"21137980","21140880"," People in your family that need money, ask for it. "
"21141180","21142200"," That has happened to me."
"21142680","21143980"," And there's another side to this too."
"21145640","21150300"," Like I don't, my brother, my brother-in-law, shouldn't be saying who exactly that. "
"21150560","21151540"," You have a brother-in-law, right?"
"21151660","21153580"," I love this guy to love him."
"21154400","21156100"," Would never say how much money I make."
"21156760","21158020"," Mother-in-law, don't tell her. "
"21158020","21159940"," I made the mistake of telling my parents."
"21160140","21160760"," They asked for money."
"21160880","21161540"," They did. "
"21162100","21165980"," I shouldn't say this shit, but I can't do it."
"21166980","21168900"," And I never flash money and all that stuff."
"21169320","21170200"," I live a normal life. "
"21170400","21174380"," You wouldn't know, if you saw me on the street, you'd think I'm just a regular guy walking on the"
"21174380","21174560"," street."
"21175400","21177760"," You wouldn't think I'm anybody, anything, nothing."
"21178720","21179860"," I'm from New England originally. "
"21180400","21185420"," So like New York, the New York mindset, that Boston mindset of no flash."
"21185740","21186560"," New Yorkers have some flash."
"21186560","21187620"," Like New Money has flash. "
"21189080","21190940"," But you don't do that shit."
"21191340","21191980"," Some people do."
"21193040","21193840"," I don't. "
"21194140","21195160"," So I'm not that person."
"21196920","21198820"," I live a very like frugal normal life."
"21199320","21200720"," Like my life is normalcy. "
"21208240","21211400"," People will know that you're making money with your proof and not your words."
"21211600","21212280"," That's not true either."
"21212460","21213080"," Well, I guess it is. "
"21213600","21214260"," I've posted proof."
"21214440","21214940"," It doesn't matter."
"21215880","21216580"," How about this?"
"21216720","21218540"," When you post proof, I'll tell you this. "
"21220060","21220880"," Nothing happens."
"21222460","21223220"," They disappear."
"21225040","21226040"," That's all that happens. "
"21226860","21230680"," Like the only thing that matters to you is that you, the only thing that matters to you is that"
"21230680","21231380"," you make money."
"21232040","21233600"," The end of the week, you're making money, right?"
"21234020","21238900"," And that you get to pay for your girlfriend, your boyfriend, your husband, your wife, your"
"21238900","21240180"," children, or yourself."
"21241360","21241780"," That's what matters. "
"21242260","21246080"," Like when you've closed laptop on a Friday, laptop goes down, right?"
"21246080","21251280"," And you didn't or did earn internet points on Fintuit or Wall Street bets."
"21251920","21258280"," If you're at least able to pay for your bills, buy your houses, buy your cars, live your life, go"
"21258280","21259220"," out and enjoy your life."
"21260000","21262540"," You guys don't see me hanging around on a Friday and Saturday, do you?"
"21262920","21266800"," You guys don't see me hanging out on a Sunday on Fintuit. "
"21267580","21269300"," What do you think I'm doing on those days?"
"21270180","21271900"," Like I'm out and about with my family."
"21272200","21272500"," You know what I mean?"
"21272580","21272880"," My friends."
"21273140","21273700"," I'm doing stuff. "
"21273700","21279460"," If you can do that stuff, then you don't give a fine fuck what what like internet points are."
"21279880","21281700"," Like I 100k or 150k."
"21282660","21283760"," It's like fucking out of here. "
"21283920","21287200"," You'll have some joy and excitement briefly, but you're like, I'm going to go spend this money."
"21288460","21289280"," Trust me, you will."
"21296300","21297140"," What else you got here?"
"21297540","21299140"," I'm trying to read what you guys are saying in the chat here. "
"21299360","21299920"," What's going on on YouTube?"
"21302900","21306420"," Do I ever offer to take financial hardships for family?"
"21309100","21310360"," Yes and no."
"21311460","21312520"," Yes and no."
"21313460","21318080"," I don't think I'm at the point where I have that ability. "
"21319220","21320720"," Where I would like to."
"21322580","21323440"," But it's like."
"21324080","21326720"," Ultimately, I have to take care of myself first. "
"21327920","21328440"," So."
"21330920","21332880"," If I take care of me, right?"
"21333940","21335900"," Then I can take care of my wife."
"21338060","21342080"," If I love my wife, and if I love myself, I can then love my wife. "
"21343180","21348780"," And then in turn, myself and my wife have some love left over for our children."
"21351060","21354180"," So a lot of time, something I've learned as I've gotten older is."
"21355440","21358380"," If you don't take care of yourself, you can't take care of your kids. "
"21360220","21361780"," That sounds counterintuitive."
"21362960","21364340"," Take your kids come first."
"21364740","21369540"," But truly, if you take care of yourself, you can then take care of your children. "
"21370560","21374520"," A lot of things they see out there is like, I'm going to take care of somebody else and not"
"21374520","21375180"," take care of myself."
"21375600","21377060"," And then you fail and they fail."
"21377440","21381120"," So if you take care of yourself, take care of your wife, kids, your husband, whatever it is, if"
"21381120","21385400"," you're the woman, you take care of your husband, take care of your kids, your husband's happy, take"
"21385400","21389300"," care of your children, your happy, take care of your children, happy family. "
"21390300","21394460"," And then if you have more left over, you can take care of other people."
"21394760","21397160"," And to get to that point is not easy."
"21397920","21400620"," I don't feel like I'm at that point yet where I can do that. "
"21402700","21403740"," That's a good question, man."
"21404000","21404940"," That's a really fucking good one."
"21405040","21406260"," That's a hard one to answer. "
"21414970","21416310"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Jimmy."
"21416510","21419050"," So Jimmy's saying, let me shine some light on everyone and captain."
"21419330","21420970"," When you die, you can't take your money with you. "
"21420970","21424450"," But if your family asks and is reasonable, better to give that bet to receive."
"21424810","21425330"," I agree with that."
"21425330","21425390"," I agree with that. "
"21425430","21426110"," Reasonable money."
"21426450","21426630"," Yes."
"21427950","21428350"," Absolutely. "
"21429310","21433970"," Like I went to a family reunion last year and I was asked to give right."
"21434210","21434490"," I didn't ask."
"21434670","21435930"," I just, I offered. "
"21436110","21438010"," I said, I'll help pay for the family reunion."
"21438930","21440210"," There's some people that didn't want to go."
"21440590","21443470"," I offered to pay and that was my offer. "
"21443610","21444030"," I'll help pay."
"21444810","21446030"," You want a bigger house?"
"21446330","21448450"," You want, you know, whatever you want and we'll make it happen."
"21449770","21450550"," Stuff like that. "
"21450750","21451350"," Yeah, I'm down."
"21456280","21457080"," By calls."
"21458180","21459240"," No calls for me. "
"21459420","21460120"," I am out."
"21460400","21461040"," I'm flat here."
"21463700","21464960"," And I do that. "
"21465400","21467800"," So Jimmy Barry saying, make sure you feed your whole local homeless."
"21468000","21468820"," There are things that I do."
"21469220","21471460"," I donate to dog shelter. "
"21472020","21473620"," I love dogs more than you know."
"21473780","21476320"," I don't talk about it here, but I fucking love dogs."
"21477100","21478660"," I've taken in stray animals. "
"21478980","21481360"," Matter of fact, I just tried to capture some stray cats this summer."
"21481460","21482120"," I failed at it."
"21483420","21483940"," And. "
"21485660","21488640"," But I'll bring them and get them all their shit done for them."
"21488740","21489540"," Thousand bucks cat."
"21490120","21490640"," Seriously. "
"21491300","21493520"," Like warm riddled cats and stuff."
"21495520","21501240"," And I do pan money out on the street corner to homeless people on the corners."
"21501340","21501920"," I do that. "
"21505100","21506760"," I donate to my kids schools."
"21507420","21508560"," I do that still right now."
"21508560","21511600"," Now we volunteer as well. "
"21511740","21513260"," We volunteer in the city of Detroit."
"21514040","21516240"," We pick up a trash, believe it or not."
"21516340","21520700"," Not trash, but they have this dumping problem in Detroit. "
"21520980","21522380"," And we do volunteer to do that stuff."
"21527010","21528390"," But that's absolutely Jimmy."
"21529270","21531810"," You got to give man plus up to the taxes to so. "
"21536820","21537740"," I love dogs."
"21538400","21539340"," No, I have not seen it."
"21539680","21541560"," I have not seen it. "
"21551250","21555690"," I do want a business, but I tell people that asked me about things that supply chain has been great"
"21555690","21556610"," last few years."
"21558210","21560270"," Oh, yeah, the dog story is bad."
"21561550","21562530"," I have heard. "
"21563950","21567350"," From what I've heard is that."
"21568370","21570050"," The business to business."
"21571470","21572850"," Suppliers are cutting back. "
"21573530","21574850"," I am not going to say."
"21575540","21576710"," How I know that, but."
"21577890","21581310"," From what I've heard, major, large, like. "
"21582210","21582870"," Large."
"21584990","21588830"," Like big business America are tightening the belt."
"21589170","21593430"," These are the suppliers to the retail establishments that you go to. "
"21594990","21597550"," I bleed not into the bell right now."
"21601030","21603590"," There is, I want to give you a heads up here."
"21603590","21605630"," Into this closing bell. "
"21605850","21608150"," There is that second."
"21609090","21609670"," Bear."
"21610890","21612650"," Cross is happening right now. "
"21612650","21613790"," I talked to you about this earlier."
"21614170","21617270"," There is a second bear cross very bearish in the close."
"21618530","21621870"," Just as we're closing right now, very bearish in the close right now. "
"21623170","21624350"," You've got the double."
"21625210","21626130"," Bear plane."
"21626430","21629690"," Usually these resolve quite violently to the downside. "
"21631590","21632950"," Major moves to the downside."
"21633310","21634710"," Just be aware of it happening right now."
"21634810","21636230"," This is a one minute chart where it's happening on. "
"21637270","21639150"," I want nothing to do with this garbage dude."
"21640950","21642210"," Straighten for 50."
"21644670","21645530"," Oh, dude. "
"21647950","21649170"," So we're ready for this."
"21649250","21653290"," We're closing for 51 C's in the money."
"21654690","21660570"," Almost five hundred and sixty one thousand zero dates for four fifty one C."
"21661710","21663930"," Closing in the money buying the market here. "
"21664630","21665090"," Oh."
"21674300","21676480"," Dude, that's a lot of buyers this market in this close."
"21676980","21677360"," Fuck ton. "
"21678400","21680860"," What do you tell people if they ask you what I do for it?"
"21681140","21681580"," Good question."
"21681740","21682860"," So I tell them I'm in finance."
"21683460","21687460"," It's my wife tells people in finance and we keep it short to there. "
"21688140","21689440"," People ask me what I do."
"21690200","21691340"," I tell them that I'm an analyst."
"21691720","21692000"," That's it. "
"21692140","21693500"," I just analyze the stock market."
"21693720","21694280"," That's all I do."
"21695420","21696820"," I sit in my office all day long. "
"21697080","21697760"," Look at the stock market."
"21698220","21698720"," That's all I."
"21698780","21699460"," That's all I say."
"21699600","21700660"," Keep it really simple. "
"21701140","21702160"," Really, really simple."
"21702700","21703420"," I don't even tell."
"21704640","21705560"," I think I've got. "
"21707060","21707880"," I think maybe."
"21709440","21713740"," In my in real life friends, maybe friends and family."
"21717540","21721220"," Three people in my real family know and I've asked them not to say. "
"21722180","21726240"," And then in real life, maybe five to ten people know that I do the screaming stuff."
"21727520","21728080"," That's it."
"21728260","21731620"," Most people just know that I'm in finance and that I analyze the stock market. "
"21731760","21732000"," That's it."
"21737010","21737950"," Keep it simple."
"21737950","21740650"," As a matter of fact, my wife, this happened to me recently. "
"21742850","21745310"," So my wife sometimes will get like."
"21746230","21747430"," She does weird shit."
"21747870","21748450"," She's like a."
"21750290","21752750"," So like here's a prime example. "
"21753250","21753350"," So."
"21755450","21755930"," Some."
"21756270","21757850"," So like someone I don't know. "
"21758690","21759410"," I just meet."
"21759610","21760290"," I just met this guy."
"21760550","21760850"," He's a burner. "
"21761090","21761630"," I met a burner."
"21762450","21763130"," Nice guy."
"21763270","21763930"," I liked him. "
"21764250","21764470"," He's awesome."
"21766650","21767390"," My wife tells him."
"21767390","21768670"," Oh yeah, he's been streaming. "
"21769710","21773030"," It's like streaming on the internet on like YouTube and Twitch and shit."
"21773110","21773450"," It's wild."
"21774250","21775910"," And immediately the guy treated me differently. "
"21777230","21777850"," And I got upset."
"21778230","21779330"," I was like, why are you telling this guy?"
"21779450","21780050"," I don't even know this guy."
"21780130","21780790"," I'm just becoming friends. "
"21781010","21781870"," I'm just meeting this guy."
"21782390","21784610"," Just like just like becoming acquaintances."
"21785730","21786030"," And. "
"21794200","21796760"," Oh, they got the calls juice for tomorrow, don't they?"
"21798280","21799880"," Look at these calls, man."
"21800040","21801640"," They're just juice up for tomorrow."
"21803600","21805820"," Four fifty four C's are looking pretty cheap. "
"21811380","21813500"," Yeah, they're only seven hundred bucks, dude."
"21816160","21819560"," Twenty five of those bad boys for seven something seven and change."
"21820140","21821940"," Was that seven hundred thirty five bucks or something?"
"21827340","21828880"," So this guy, right?"
"21829280","21829700"," Treat me differently. "
"21830220","21831060"," I got upset about it."
"21832100","21833120"," Wasn't a good situation."
"21833120","21834080"," No, my wife. "
"21835160","21839100"," I'm like, I need to change my phone number because I've got too many people calling me and texting"
"21839100","21839760"," me all day long."
"21840560","21844680"," She gets right on the phone with the guy from the phone company and she doesn't tell him."
"21845520","21850760"," And I'm like, you should be telling that guy that I don't know why I'm changing my phone number,"
"21850940","21851280"," the truth. "
"21852500","21854900"," And why are you telling every all my friends?"
"21854900","21861140"," Uh, like she's like, uh, she's like Mother Teresa or something."
"21861600","21863460"," She's like, can't tell a lie."
"21863800","21865880"," So I'm like, not quite a lie, but just don't tell them. "
"21866160","21867640"," Like, just don't say anything."
"21869700","21871540"," Don't don't say anything and she does."
"21872520","21873940"," She's like, tells everybody. "
"21875120","21875940"," God damn."
"21876120","21877140"," I'll be quiet."
"21884440","21886320"," So that I hope that answered that for you. "
"21888940","21890260"," I bought some calls there."
"21890400","21891700"," So I got some calls for tomorrow."
"21893760","21895100"," Oh, we do creepy crawly. "
"21895620","21897600"," Oh, they're trading 32 cents right now."
"21897660","21898920"," They were 28 just a minute ago."
"21901300","21902380"," Like I couldn't resist. "
"21904400","21907480"," I don't want you to buy them though because I want to fucking trade them my own."
"21911480","21912760"," The fucking gambler."
"21917100","21924560"," Can I explain the impact of big buying the market as a result of high volume of calls closing in"
"21924560","21924780"," the money?"
"21925820","21927580"," It makes me think we're going up. "
"21928020","21929340"," Well, it makes me think two things."
"21929900","21934240"," It makes me think that we're going up and it makes me think that when they're ready to sell them,"
"21934300","21934540"," they will."
"21935560","21936580"," That's also scary. "
"21937360","21942540"," So like if they're buying all those underlying spy, their expectation is that we're going higher."
"21942540","21947400"," And I'm also scared that they're going to try to sell them as soon as they get paid."
"21950220","21952440"," So yeah, that's my takeaways from that. "
"21952600","21954860"," I don't like seeing puts when I see puts in the money."
"21956200","21960360"," Like large orders of puts in the money, but there are people out there will say to you."
"21961100","21962320"," People out there will say to you. "
"21963020","21965960"," Oh, if calls are closing in the money, it doesn't mean anything."
"21967380","21971940"," It might be a part of a bigger strategy like a butterfly strategy."
"21972540","21974380"," And they don't mind owning the market here. "
"21974860","21976460"," I'm like, okay, that makes sense."
"21977120","21982980"," But then when I see zero dates coming to the market, I see a fucking half million of them."
"21983860","21987480"," And it's pinning the markets and they're letting them close in the money. "
"21987920","21989220"," They're not closing them right now."
"21989300","21990220"," They're still on right now."
"21990680","21991800"," And it's one pass. "
"21992160","21994000"," So they get to four fifteen to close them."
"21994440","21996860"," If they don't close them by four fifteen, I'm going to watch."
"21997020","21999460"," I always watch this shit till to the close. "
"21999840","22001080"," Then they're buying the market."
"22001080","22002700"," That's how you know they're buying the market."
"22003180","22007440"," That implies that we're going up quite heavily into the future, right?"
"22008700","22011200"," What's oftentimes if they close the money at the bottom?"
"22011660","22013100"," It says the same thing to me. "
"22013280","22014460"," Hey, they're closing puts in the money."
"22014680","22016160"," They don't mind owning the market here."
"22016520","22018900"," They have an expectation that we're going higher. "
"22021000","22025300"," Normally, you do not see calls and puts expire in the money."
"22025800","22027340"," Normally, you do not see it."
"22031840","22032840"," What else you guys got?"
"22038740","22039820"," Yeah, she's proud of me. "
"22040620","22042840"," Dude, I don't know what the shit is."
"22043240","22044960"," I don't know what the fuck she is, but..."
"22046620","22048080"," She doesn't listen to me."
"22048200","22049320"," I can assure you of that. "
"22050080","22052320"," She does the direct opposite of things that I say."
"22052560","22052900"," That's the truth."
"22053920","22057080"," She literally does the exact opposite of what I say. "
"22057080","22061560"," I will say, can you, the sky is blue?"
"22061760","22062360"," She goes, nope, it's red."
"22062640","22063460"," I'm like, God damn it."
"22069040","22070240"," No, no, no, no, no. "
"22070380","22072140"," So, no, no, no, no."
"22072240","22079520"," So I'm watching them with, I'm watching them put fucking calls and puts on and off this market as"
"22079520","22080740"," the diet day is moving on."
"22083340","22085260"," Stay on till 4.15. I'll stay on with you. "
"22085440","22090480"," I'm on with you till 4.15. Mm-mm."
"22101950","22104110"," A well-known friend, professional dominatrix."
"22104670","22107890"," Few of her friends of family know, yeah, I can't say anything. "
"22108270","22110050"," I can't say anything to anybody."
"22110330","22112670"," I get looked at differently."
"22113090","22116910"," People think, when people find out, it's really..."
"22116910","22120070"," So, if you don't see something that's weird, you guys want something really fucked up and weird?"
"22121510","22122990"," So, I know you, right?"
"22122990","22126470"," Oh, I only know you over the internet, but I'm here with you all day long. "
"22126730","22129070"," If you and I met up, we'd hang out and do our thing, right?"
"22129550","22132310"," And you would then decide, I like this person or I don't."
"22132710","22135630"," Or I like this person more on the internet, not in person."
"22136190","22139670"," Or I like this person on the phone, but not in real life. "
"22139950","22148250"," Or I love this person on YouTube and on a phone, and I also like him in real life, right?"
"22150290","22160230"," Every time somebody finds out that I'm a fucking streamer, and they don't know me, it hasn't"
"22160230","22160650"," ended well."
"22161070","22162710"," There's like an automatic assumption."
"22163690","22165510"," Like, that person is an influencer. "
"22165810","22166930"," Like, I don't like influencers."
"22167610","22169290"," The internet tells me that's like influencers."
"22170010","22171990"," So, it doesn't help me in relationships. "
"22173030","22173550"," That's true story."
"22174530","22175110"," True fucking story."
"22175590","22180070"," They have like expectations of me, that I'm this person or that, or all that kind of stuff. "
"22180270","22181650"," There's like all this like shit that comes with it."
"22181730","22183310"," So, I don't often tell people."
"22184010","22187610"," I'm assuming that your dominatrix friend, same kind of a deal. "
"22192810","22194150"," Oh yeah, I keep testing it."
"22194330","22194730"," It's not ready."
"22194910","22195470"," It's almost ready. "
"22196470","22197270"," I keep testing it."
"22197850","22199730"," Time table tomorrow, last week."
"22200390","22201410"," It really is right there. "
"22201550","22202230"," Like, is it last week?"
"22202390","22202750"," Is it tomorrow?"
"22202990","22203630"," Is it next week?"
"22204550","22205410"," I want it right now."
"22205410","22208950"," So, I love you too, man."
"22209070","22210030"," I love you just saying right. "
"22212990","22214490"," I'm down to 30 cents right now."
"22221990","22224990"," Yeah, I'm holding some calls here."
"22226350","22228050"," I'm going to wait and see this last 15 minutes. "
"22228070","22228690"," What happens here?"
"22229710","22230210"," I'm watching."
"22230990","22232410"," I got my eyes in the market here."
"22232550","22233470"," I want to lose all this money. "
"22234690","22236530"," I've been losing all fucking day long."
"22238150","22239290"," Let me see what else you're saying."
"22241630","22242690"," CRM beat possibly. "
"22243170","22243290"," Nice."
"22244950","22246130"," It actually makes me want to stream."
"22247730","22249130"," I wouldn't want to be a streamer. "
"22250090","22250930"," Be honest with you."
"22252150","22253150"," It's hard work."
"22253630","22254270"," You don't get paid. "
"22254930","22255770"," You can get paid."
"22256510","22257210"," I shouldn't say you don't get paid."
"22257330","22258710"," You can get paid as a streamer. "
"22259570","22260810"," It's a weird ass life."
"22261110","22262510"," Like, it's really weird."
"22263330","22267550"," There's like a, uh, okay. "
"22267850","22272390"," So how many followers do I have on Twitch?"
"22273750","22275470"," I don't know how many followers I have."
"22275550","22276970"," I should probably know and I don't."
"22278650","22280650"," I don't know how many followers I have. "
"22282670","22283950"," I have no idea."
"22285050","22285850"," I don't even pay."
"22285930","22287070"," I need to pay attention to this shit. "
"22287210","22288190"," I don't pay attention to this shit."
"22290250","22291970"," How many followers do I have?"
"22291970","22293830"," Anybody know how many followers I have on Twitch?"
"22297250","22298130"," See you later, man."
"22299790","22302630"," So I have 1.5,000 followers on Twitch. "
"22305230","22306750"," Do you know how rare that is?"
"22307590","22309770"," Some, any of you out there know how rare that is?"
"22310690","22315610"," Like a streamer to get 200 followers usually takes like two years."
"22317770","22318250"," Point."
"22318250","22320410"," What is it?"
"22320530","22326670"," I feel with the fact that it's like 0.0079% of streamers never get an affiliate or, or, or"
"22326670","22326830"," a."
"22328750","22332650"," Or offer affiliate status or partner status on Twitch. "
"22333190","22337570"," It's like the first thing you have to deal with is, um, these are your questions, I guess."
"22337830","22338150"," I like these."
"22339210","22340790"," Uh, is anybody going to watch you?"
"22341650","22345210"," And then, uh, the determination that you have to have, right?"
"22345770","22347150"," I'm going to commit to this. "
"22347890","22348890"," I'm committed to this."
"22349030","22351850"," Second thing you need to have is, uh, you're not going to get paid."
"22352590","22355210"," Uh, and you don't, shouldn't have any expectation to ever get paid. "
