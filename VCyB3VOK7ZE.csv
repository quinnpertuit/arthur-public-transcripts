"68280","68700"," Okay. "
"71040","71880"," Weird."
"81460","84580"," Got missing a chat here."
"86280","102380"," And Q."
"104660","105140"," Q's. "
"108020","109340"," Good morning out there."
"109440","109780"," How y'all doing?"
"111860","112780"," Turn that off."
"114480","115780"," Get right into it right away. "
"125710","126670"," All right."
"126670","133750"," Give me one secondary to have some technical stuff I have to do in the background."
"133750","135890"," Good morning to you all if you're joining us right now. "
"162190","162590"," Decision."
"165710","166110"," Dude."
"173990","174610"," Second here. "
"197320","200800"," So that's all I just got some technical stuff I got to do here in the background."
"200800","204820"," And there's a rug pull going on."
"207860","209340"," We're going to talk about that too. "
"213000","214400"," Keep that right there."
"223180","224820"," Okay, stop right there."
"227220","228300"," Yeah, it's kind of funny. "
"229020","229740"," This morning."
"232080","233680"," So I've been burning the midnight oil here."
"234680","237080"," Some live streaming during the day and then I'm working until. "
"237900","238840"," Oh, I don't know."
"239620","242000"," That's how I'm actually done two, three in the morning, I think."
"242640","245480"," So I said I would be late this morning. "
"246900","248600"," And I'm glad I did."
"250320","252920"," So let me switch over here right now."
"254600","256680"," As I had meetings until. "
"258140","259700"," Quite late last night."
"261060","262840"," It's a five minute chart right now."
"263820","267600"," And then after my meetings, I've been working on. "
"269480","272000"," I think that here's one more thing you're going to do."
"278580","279940"," Almost forgot."
"286400","287380"," Sort by newest. "
"289600","290360"," Customization."
"291880","292640"," Members."
"299500","300100"," All right. "
"300980","301880"," So just a moment here."
"301980","304200"," I got some technical stuff to do in the background here."
"305480","306940"," It'd be just a moment. "
"309540","310380"," Get some calls."
"310640","311820"," I'm going to say no to those right now."
"311880","312860"," We're going to talk about that too. "
"313120","314320"," We got a bunch of stuff to go over this morning."
"315080","318020"," We got a bunch of stuff to get through on the."
"319420","321840"," We have a bunch of stuff we have to get through. "
"322540","323500"," Heading into."
"324760","326140"," This rate decision."
"326420","327700"," So we're going to do this rapid fire. "
"328880","330060"," I am bearish here."
"330180","330680"," Just so you know."
"331000","334560"," We're going to talk about my bearishness into this rate decision too. "
"334560","335600"," We'll lead up to that."
"336740","337300"," And."
"338380","339340"," We're just chatting. "
"339700","341540"," So let's start baseline."
"342940","344380"," I'm kind of happy here."
"344460","347500"," I'm very impressed because we've been. "
"350140","352080"," We kind of charted."
"352240","353500"," Kind of."
"353560","354860"," We kind of like. "
"355320","356640"," Six sessions ago."
"358480","359840"," Charted all this out."
"360200","363800"," And I'm quite impressed right now that we have followed. "
"366140","367220"," That trend."
"367580","371400"," One, two, three, four, five."
"372720","373260"," Six. "
"374160","377040"," Now I did start a position."
"377040","379020"," Yesterday I was a little pissed off."
"379220","381140"," I started a call position yesterday. "
"381900","383000"," In the bell."
"384780","385300"," Down here."
"385480","386620"," Watch my cursor right here. "
"386840","387800"," So right down here."
"389320","393400"," I bought some calls on this down spike for today."
"394980","396760"," Now there's two things on this. "
"397040","400160"," I bought some calls down there and I was fucking livid."
"400740","402040"," Into four 15."
"404280","407180"," The price of those calls did not change. "
"407740","408900"," Now I knew better."
"410100","412720"," And I should not have bought calls down here because."
"414260","416320"," Right there bottom like right at the bottom. "
"416700","417240"," And."
"418260","421760"," Should not have bought them because when they when we came back up."
"422520","423340"," Those calls. "
"423900","425600"," Did not budge in price."
"427100","427660"," And."
"428640","431160"," We saw that all day long yesterday, right?"
"431160","435120"," There really wasn't a ton of payout on calls. "
"435920","437880"," I was so frustrated yesterday."
"438220","439720"," I looked at all of my trades yesterday."
"440660","443620"," And I was so frustrated after the close yesterday. "
"445480","448940"," Because the input the implication that we have range expansion."
"450100","454580"," Means a couple things means you have to stay long all fucking day long and you have to go up"
"454580","456420"," 100 fucking points to get paid."
"457580","463820"," And it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a it's a function of dealers basically saying go fuck"
"463820","464280"," yourself. "
"466240","470400"," Not getting that expansion of of the implied range."
"472020","474420"," And that premium repricing all that kind of stuff."
"475140","477280"," It made me not want to play today. "
"477940","482560"," That's how much much fucking angered me into the close yesterday because I was just like, you know,"
"483020","484740"," I was like, I don't really want to trade this."
"484740","486680"," If if this is how it's going to go."
"487100","490300"," Now, normally we don't have a lot of range expansion on these dates. "
"490700","493400"," Implied moves are usually like here and here."
"494300","496200"," And because they're higher and lower."
"497940","502060"," Dealers are just like, well, we're not going to pay you for 100 point move or 200 point move. "
"502140","502540"," We don't care."
"502620","506460"," We're not going to pay you like hold this and play the game."
"506460","511520"," And I'm like, why am I playing this game this late into the close yesterday when I already know"
"511520","512020"," that. "
"512960","515640"," I have to hold for giant moves just to print."
"516120","520480"," We saw it yesterday that like we we'd move two three bars up and I'd get a penny and I'm"
"520480","522740"," like, you I like this is bullshit."
"522740","527700"," You know, so when we're in these events, I'm like, what am I doing?"
"528320","531220"," And I had a nine, I had 10 trades yesterday. "
"531840","534580"," I thought I had eight winners and one loss at the end."
"534820","535960"," I had 10 trades."
"536200","540360"," I had one loser in the morning, but I think three or four pennies. "
"540920","544480"," I can go back and look and then I had one loser at the end of the day."
"545280","551080"," But even after eight winning trades and two losses that I had stops on."
"551640","553900"," It was a good day, but it wasn't a great fucking day. "
"554160","558360"," And you can't have eight out of 10 winners and not walk away rich."
"559180","568440"," So the implication here for me at least is that this event is rigged to me to some extent."
"570440","575600"," If I have eight winning trades, I better fucking be up a ton and eight out of 10, I should"
"575600","576600"," be doing very well. "
"576900","578240"," So it's already showing that."
"579040","584040"," It's already showing that even with the range expansion expectation that you pretty much have to"
"584040","587280"," fucking hold until the end right and ride the casino."
"589140","594600"," So normally I give the normally I tell people don't bother trading this. "
"595660","600980"," What's really nice about this too is if your implied move is here, let's say as an example in here"
"600980","603320"," and you actually trade out of that range."
"604040","606500"," You get paid some big fucking money."
"607440","610520"," And so so I don't know how much I'm going to play this today. "
"610520","611360"," I'm going to start with that."
"611460","612100"," I might play this."
"612740","615860"," I still have those calls on this morning. "
"616120","617660"," So if they print, they print."
"620440","623100"," And then the other thing that I noticed last night at late night was."
"624060","629640"," Now that six o'clock scam candle on NASDAQ, which, you know, sure people say that I disagree with"
"629640","631360"," that, but you can't move the market that much. "
"631700","635400"," That easily unless you control the market in my view."
"635800","638080"," So I made that post late last night."
"638160","639420"," I think like one to the morning. "
"639420","640000"," I'm not sure."
"640500","641660"," So that's out of the way there."
"641780","641900"," Okay. "
"643220","647340"," The other thing that I did last night was we'll talk about this later."
"647480","649720"," I've been working on refining the tool."
"650600","652400"," And so the tool is changing. "
"653260","656540"," It's changed about 20 to 30% from what it was."
"657340","658640"," So I've been testing it."
"659220","664160"," And last night I spent a lot of time back testing into two, three o'clock in the morning. "
"665020","668460"," And not surprisingly, I turned bearish last night."
"668860","670000"," No, no, not surprisingly."
"670700","674500"," The improvements that I'm making this tool are telling me to be bearish today. "
"675340","677860"," And I was actually kind of bullish heading in today."
"678380","684460"," Even if I thought we'd come into today and kind of do this like bloodbath down, then it moved"
"684460","684780"," higher."
"685860","688580"," I'm kind of going against this right now. "
"688620","690220"," So we're going to talk about that too."
"691260","697340"," We're going to talk about my a difference of opinion that I have."
"698480","705300"," And even if we do go up here today, I don't know that I would take the trade. "
"706120","711200"," So the improvement to this tool is telling me not to trade this too."
"711200","712180"," So that's second."
"714100","722040"," Strike against trading today is tools like, well, even if we do go up, you're not validated to take"
"722040","722480"," the trade. "
"723100","724920"," So we'll look at that as the day goes on."
"725600","727360"," At some point, I'll show it to you."
"728140","729820"," I don't know if I'm going to show it to you today. "
"729920","731320"," I may or may not show it to you today."
"732940","737500"," But it's fascinating because you can lose a lot of money in this trade today."
"737500","743840"," So just a little bit of changes today to talk about as the morning in the afternoon moves forward. "
"745260","748920"," So the tool is telling me to be bearish right now."
"749180","750140"," No, not bearish."
"750300","754120"," Not necessarily bearish to not be bullish right now. "
"754620","755980"," So we're going to go over a bunch of stuff this morning."
"756220","756880"," We have to talk about."
"757880","759020"," We will see. "
"761000","762700"," Let me take a 30 minute chart here."
"762700","767860"," Yes, 30 minute charts telling me not to not to be bullish, not to hey, buy this dip."
"768880","771540"," Now that could change if price gets above. "
"771820","773700"," So just I want to make that note as well."
"774220","776280"," So let's say price gets above here."
"777000","778260"," It's a five minute chart. "
"778720","784020"," If price were to come higher, I would invalidate my bearishness and we would go up here and I would"
"784020","784760"," take that trade."
"785600","790420"," But without seeing this right here, without seeing price above and across."
"791540","797800"," My new tool is telling the same tool just improved is telling me do not take calls here right now. "
"797840","799180"," So just heads up to you out there."
"799560","802220"," If you're bullish here, whatever you might be thinking about."
"802980","804760"," I am not at this point bullish. "
"805460","806740"," There's a one minute chart right here."
"806880","810540"," We'll take a look at the hourly trigger and see where that is and see it rolling over currently"
"810540","812420"," right now."
"812420","814700"," I'm going to train down into S one. "
"815520","816600"," A one minute chart."
"818560","821000"," Yes, we will take a look at all the stuff right now."
"821020","821940"," Hold on one second here. "
"833850","835430"," There goes the blood right there."
"837070","839430"," I'm actually kind of happy that's happening right now."
"844950","846370"," Hold on one second here. "
"847050","854350"," And then working on this thing for like a week now and kind of happy that's happening right now"
"854350","855810"," because it's telling me no."
"856250","858230"," So here you guys the hourly trigger right here."
"858690","861190"," Three trigger three trigger cluster here as well. "
"861190","864610"," On the hourly trigger the one in the five minute."
"865990","871590"," And then we're going to look at an implied move for today and we're also going to we're going to"
"871590","872870"," map out an implied move."
"874330","876110"," See what the options market is saying. "
"877890","879390"," The move is today."
"884200","885880"," And just one moment here."
"903790","912760"," Four fifty six forty six. "
"914660","918400"," And that was another note about yesterday was that."
"929090","935830"," This is what spy has priced into the market for today markets pretty fucking bearish today right."
"937050","938410"," Text right here. "
"944940","946100"," Leave that over there."
"947600","948760"," We took that out."
"948900","950220"," We don't need to know about that anymore. "
"950440","952380"," We don't need to know about that anymore."
"954360","955860"," We don't need this anymore."
"958960","963330"," We need that took all those out yesterday. "
"966970","968390"," This low right here."
"970390","971690"," That low right there."
"974870","976950"," One right there that one right there. "
"980960","983520"," Mission accomplished and all that stuff right there."
"985140","991700"," We got one more right down here."
"992600","993680"," Is that low?"
"998890","1002110"," The implied move to the downside today. "
"1010890","1012570"," Four fifty one eighty eight."
"1015130","1016670"," It's actually tightened up today."
"1017810","1021110"," Four fifty one eighty eight right down here. "
"1028859","1029760"," Right there."
"1029920","1031660"," So here's your implied move for today."
"1035020","1036040"," Copy that now. "
"1052570","1057470"," I shouldn't say expected move is the correct term."
"1062980","1066220"," I just want you to be aware of the expected move for today."
"1067060","1068980"," The expected moves for today. "
"1075620","1077080"," Right down in there."
"1086360","1087520"," That down there."
"1127560","1133520"," So we're going to talk about what to expect today in the Fed rate decision. "
"1134820","1137760"," So the expected move to the downside is."
"1140920","1144800"," Outside of the implied ball like the serenade options."
"1145500","1147160"," Stuff that was recorded this morning. "
"1147420","1150120"," The expected move is down here for fifty one eighty seven."
"1150800","1153880"," This is not expected down here for forty four sixty."
"1154520","1157260"," For a bloodbath in the marketplace. "
"1158640","1161200"," We're going to review what to expect today."
"1165830","1167530"," Five minute chart we're still on."
"1168590","1171370"," Look at that almost perfect fucking moves down here. "
"1172270","1173270"," Fucking almost perfect."
"1174950","1180910"," I got to say man this thing is like we have like six straight sessions one two three four five"
"1180910","1186630"," six one two three four five six sessions almost exact."
"1188350","1189290"," It's kind of wild. "
"1189290","1193950"," We're a little bit of out of bounds on the top side here yesterday but otherwise fucking shit is"
"1193950","1194170"," closest."
"1195010","1197730"," It's like hand grenades and horseshoes good enough right there pretty good."
"1199170","1201610"," So impressed as to where we've gone so far. "
"1202370","1203710"," Now for the bulls."
"1204910","1207930"," Up here you've got your top a new high here."
"1208210","1209310"," You've got a cup and handle. "
"1209670","1212730"," We all know though the traditional stuff can can fail."
"1213390","1213850"," Right."
"1214050","1217190"," We all know that we can always get a dip down here and then you get your move to the"
"1217190","1217470"," upside. "
"1218330","1220490"," We're going to talk about this today as well."
"1221070","1221930"," The open mark to me."
"1222210","1225030"," It's kind of important what exactly is said today. "
"1225030","1230950"," I saw what Nick Temeros had to say on Twitter."
"1231210","1233890"," So we will put that down here."
"1234490","1235770"," Just get rid of this fucking thing. "
"1236890","1237990"," I'll just leave that there."
"1238790","1240090"," Hold on one second here."
"1241030","1242790"," One right there one right there. "
"1243750","1244450"," We're fine."
"1244670","1244930"," That's good."
"1251450","1255890"," We're going to look at previous the June meeting and see what the June meeting held. "
"1256470","1258610"," We're going to look at the Fed minutes."
"1259870","1264180"," I guess we'll extend that down there."
"1268880","1269440"," 1109. "
"1270100","1275020"," Sometimes the hedge comes off 11.30, 1.30 in the afternoon heading into the Fed minutes."
"1275020","1276940"," We're going to talk about that too."
"1277700","1280200"," We're going to go over what Temeros had to say. "
"1281300","1284220"," He's the considered the Fed's mouthpiece."
"1292840","1295220"," I'm going to give you a quick preview for today."
"1301110","1302890"," So the Fed is widely expected. "

"1314010","1319270"," More importantly will be whether the open market committee officials feel they have gone far"
"1319270","1319590"," enough. "
"1321110","1326530"," Hiking more from here carries risk to an economy that many think is heading for at least a mild"
"1326530","1326850"," recession."
"1328130","1332210"," So at least there's some change in, you know, we're going to have a recession."
"1332470","1337550"," We're going to have a depression to a mild quote unquote mild recession. "
"1337550","1344910"," And the more more hiking that we do or the Fed does the more risk to damage to the economy"
"1344910","1346130"," actual damage."
"1346510","1354350"," And that balancing act that the Fed plays in trying to reach dual mandates, right?"
"1354930","1359490"," We know that the Fed is trying to maximize employment at the same time."
"1359490","1361310"," They're trying to destroy jobs. "
"1363390","1367810"," Despite an improving inflation picture, the Federal Reserve is expected on Wednesday to approval"
"1367810","1371690"," would be the 11th interest rate increase since March 2022."
"1372790","1377890"," Investors are hoping that it will be it will be the last one for a long time and we've discussed"
"1377890","1378730"," that this week."
"1379950","1383930"," Do we get a pause or the talk the last time was. "
"1385110","1385670"," Pause."
"1387930","1388690"," And data dependent."
"1389750","1390310"," And. "
"1392790","1393770"," In the future."
"1395050","1401430"," Now, Tim Rose came out the last rate decision meeting and said, hey, we've got to change in tone."
"1402910","1407250"," And that time he was like, we're going to expect the next meeting to get a pause. "
"1408370","1410630"," Not data dependent in actual pause."
"1411690","1418770"," You remember when I was speaking in the presser, he was a little bit more hawkish in his tone than"
"1418770","1421950"," what the press release stated."
"1429280","1434120"," Investors are hoping that will be the last one for a long time markets are pricing in an absolute"
"1434120","1437480"," certainty that the Fed will approve a quarter percentage point hike. "
"1437480","1440020"," It will take its benchmark borrowing rate."
"1442320","1443580"," We'll mute this right here."
"1443680","1445040"," We don't need to listen to that right now. "
"1448300","1455940"," Well, to erase the benchmark target rate to 5.25 to 5.5%. That would push the upper boundary of"
"1455940","1458920"," the federal funds rate to its highest level since 2001."
"1458920","1464140"," More pressing matter will be whether the open market officials feel they've gone far enough or if"
"1464140","1468160"," there is more still more work to do in the fight against pernicious inflation."
"1469580","1475340"," The signal will probably be yes, we're hiking, but then we think we can sit here for a while and"
"1475340","1477820"," see that comes from Kathy Jones. "
"1478680","1482460"," Chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab, but quote, no promises."
"1483180","1487400"," We can't give up the option and that is a needle to thread."
"1487980","1494640"," If you're a bull out there, you're kind of like sweet spot here today is going to be. "
"1496180","1502800"," A pause to a 25 BPS a pause and some kind of threat."
"1507440","1508720"," Let me rephrase that."
"1509180","1513660"," We pause that sustained for a known amount of time. "
"1513660","1516320"," Let's say three months or longer."
"1519500","1521540"," And some kind of like threat."
"1523000","1526580"," That there'll be a possibility of let's say one more rate hike. "
"1527840","1534100"," At least one more rate hike down the road and as long as that threat stays there, it doesn't open"
"1534100","1543040"," up the Pandora's box to the market to front run an easing of rates within the next three months."
"1543120","1547260"," That would put an end in my view, put an end to the bull run, basically."
"1548180","1555560"," If at any point the market thinks that there'll never be another rate increase and that we actually"
"1555560","1561100"," should anticipate rate cuts at some point two months down the road, you would see. "
"1561100","1568620"," A front running of rate cuts and that would mean a down move in the marketplace."
"1569440","1570720"," So bulls is a hard thing."
"1570820","1578000"," Not a hard but if you can't grasp that concept, you still want the threat of possible rate hikes"
"1578000","1581580"," down the road, even if they're going to cut. "
"1582320","1586540"," You want the threat there and you want that threat to be believed."
"1589760","1594700"," Indeed, the Fed's course is far less certain central bank policy makers almost unanimously believe"
"1594700","1599080"," inflation is too high, but hiking more from here carries risks to an economy that many think is"
"1599080","1600960"," heading for at least a mild recession."
"1603800","1605220"," The Fed should be done. "
"1605780","1609360"," Jones is part of a growing market course that thinks the central bank has gone far enough."
"1609780","1611580"," Now that's a different argument, right?"
"1612340","1618720"," Whether people believe the Fed has gone long enough or not is not, there's two arguments here."
"1619320","1623380"," As long as you believe that it's going to stay higher for longer, even if it's just where it's at"
"1623380","1626760"," right now, versus, hey, we're done, let's party. "
"1627940","1629760"," There are two different concepts here."
"1630460","1634120"," So Jones is part of a growing market course that thinks the central bank has gone far enough with"
"1634120","1636180"," the annual inflation rate declining to 3% in June."
"1636180","1639120"," It was 9.1% a year ago. "
"1639260","1644340"," The danger is growing that the Fed could unnecessarily push the economy into contraction."
"1646200","1650040"," The quote, the Fed should be done already, Jones said."
"1650480","1652520"," They're walking a difficult line here to me. "
"1652680","1657200"," The decision would be, hey, we've done enough for now and we can't wait and see."
"1657540","1661160"," But apparently the folks, the Fed think they need one more at least."
"1661160","1663920"," Now I think the Fed needs one or two minimum. "
"1664600","1672460"," Personally, I think they need at least this one and probably one more down the road sometime in the"
"1672460","1672720"," fall."
"1673680","1679040"," Or even what a great time to do would be in a late winter."
"1681690","1684890"," In fact, the officials indicated strongly at their last meeting. "
"1685450","1691230"," The first one during the tightening cycle, they didn't see a rate increase that they see at least"
"1691230","1692610"," two more hikes this year."
"1692610","1696850"," Now that's coming from the Fed minutes."
"1697490","1698950"," And I do want to be clear here. "
"1699350","1706330"," Something that you need to be able to parse is that there's three different things here."
"1706510","1708790"," There's the press release."
"1709770","1713910"," There is the the presser from the Fed chair. "
"1714930","1719590"," And then there's the minutes and news organizations love to model."
"1721230","1727890"," The message from the Fed using all three of these sources."
"1729250","1738870"," I tend to separate all three and put different weightings behind the three outside of the reporting"
"1738870","1741190"," organizations out there. "
"1741670","1744870"," The most important one to you today is the press release."
"1746150","1747490"," That's an important one."
"1747490","1754650"," The presser is more of like a ringleader for what to expect today in the stock market. "
"1755210","1759370"," The press release is the message from the Fed."
"1760010","1767970"," The Fed minutes is like the ringleader going into the back room and there's a bunch of this clowns"
"1767970","1768530"," back there."
"1768810","1775230"," There's people that feel like they get their say there, but it really isn't the Fed minutes to me. "
"1775230","1779610"," At least it doesn't mean shit to me."
"1779870","1781130"," To me it really doesn't."
"1781250","1783530"," What really matters to me is the press release. "
"1785770","1790890"," Since that meeting, policymakers have done little to dispel the likelihood of higher rates."
"1792550","1797370"," I don't mind the little Fed presidents having their say, but it isn't in stone."
"1797890","1800550"," These Fed minutes are not in stone. "
"1800870","1801430"," They're not policy."
"1802070","1804070"," I don't mind them saying what they want to say other."
"1804190","1808050"," I think Jerome Powell has made that clear as well. "
"1808530","1810970"," These little chairs can say whatever the fuck they want, I don't care."
"1811590","1813770"," Because at the end of the day what he says is what goes."
"1815510","1820230"," We actually have reports of people in the past, very smart people that work for the Fed, that are"
"1820230","1823830"," like, yeah, it comes down to like three or four egos deciding what happens. "
"1825310","1827130"," It's actually been written in books."
"1827770","1830430"," We have scientists working on this."
"1830850","1836270"," It's literally like three persons, three people and their egos off the cuff making a decision"
"1836270","1838390"," because they feel like this is the right thing to do. "
"1840230","1841350"," Hey kid, you're not."
"1842390","1847910"," Since that meeting policymakers have done little to dispel the likelihood of higher rates."
"1848170","1849110"," That's a key point though. "
"1850590","1855390"," You want the threat of more rates down the road, whether we get them or not."
"1855390","1856830"," If you're a bull, you do."
"1857050","1862010"," I know you don't believe that, but you actually do want that threats in front of you. "
"1862910","1865690"," And you probably do want rates higher for longer as well."
"1865890","1867610"," If you're a bull, I know you think you want."
"1867870","1870990"," I think you think you want to eat and I think you think you want. "
"1871870","1873950"," Rate cuts, but you really don't."
"1875550","1877970"," Markets though, haven't seemed to mind."
"1878190","1884250"," Wall Street has been in a tier all year with a DJ DJ IA jumping more than 5% over"
"1884250","1885050"," the past month alone. "
"1885050","1890890"," That could be because traders are ignoring the Fed's rhetoric and pricing in just a 35%"
"1890890","1891350"," probability."
"1892590","1894650"," Of another hike before the end of the year."
"1896170","1898430"," I do want to make another note too. "
"1899130","1904870"," The traders betting on whether we get rate hikes or not is it means nothing."
"1905050","1905390"," It's garbage."
"1906550","1911230"," I don't know why news organizations report that stuff. "
"1911230","1915290"," It's just a bunch of gamblers trying to make money."
"1915530","1922250"," Believe it or not."
"1925870","1930190"," That's according to CME Group's FedWatch gauge of futures market pricing. "
"1930530","1935730"," One key note from the meeting will be whether Fed Chair Powell indicates that at least the FMC will"
"1935730","1938850"," again skip a hike at its next meeting in September."
"1939390","1943470"," While it analyzes the impact of previous increases of hat on the economy."
"1944190","1945810"," I was saying one more meeting. "
"1946150","1948970"," I'm hoping for three, believe it or not, like three months."
"1949570","1952190"," I guess the September is, what is that?"
"1952370","1952550"," Two months?"
"1953450","1955210"," During July, we got August, September."
"1957190","1959170"," I'll make that concession there. "
"1959310","1960250"," September sounds good."
"1962650","1966750"," While it analyzes the impact of the previous increases of hat on the economy."
"1966750","1970730"," Paul has said the Fed has not locked into an every other meeting pattern of hikes. "
"1971530","1973850"," But he has indicated that a slow pace of hikes is likely."
"1974170","1974930"," He has said that."
"1975710","1980190"," Quote, the hike that's going to happen Wednesday is unnecessary and probably the last couple were"
"1980190","1980850"," unnecessary said. "
"1981050","1982470"," Luke Tilly chief economist."
"1983350","1985770"," Willing, Wilmington trust investment advisors."
"1986130","1989370"," By the time we get to November, they'll be even clearer. "
"1991490","1995510"," Fed policy, though, has been informed by a belief that when it comes to fighting inflation, it's"
"1995510","1998370"," better to do much too much than too little."
"1998590","2000450"," That's the hammer on the nail concept, right?"
"2001070","2007010"," The current bout of price increases was the most severe in the U.S. The U.S. and many developed"
"2007010","2010630"," nations has had to face since the early 1980s."
"2011370","2017290"," Last price by the last period is also behind a lot of the Fed thinking with a particular focus on"
"2017290","2019130"," how policymakers then backed off. "
"2019130","2023570"," The inflation fight too soon and ended up having an even worse problem."
"2024450","2028410"," Quote, it's easy for me to say that I think they're going too much, Tilly said."
"2028830","2033250"," But I'm also quick to say that if I was in their seats, I might be doing the same thing"
"2033250","2036790"," because they really are playing a game of risk management. "
"2038510","2045210"," The game is familiar by now retreating from the inflation fight soon could lead to a repeat of the"
"2045210","2046370"," 1970s."
"2046370","2053190"," Early 1980s stagflation of high prices and weak growth while going too far risks tipping the"
"2053190","2054250"," country into a recession."
"2055250","2060770"," Recent indicators are showing that credit conditions are tightening significantly with higher"
"2060770","2064670"," interest rates and tougher lending standard substantial headwinds to future growth. "
"2065510","2070190"," Quote, recently softer core inflation will be welcomed by Powell, but he's likely to want several"
"2070190","2076350"," more months of softer inflation data before confidently terminating the hiking side."
"2076350","2076590"," The cycle."
"2077489","2082150"," City group economist Andrew Holenhorst said in a client note in our view, the US economy is not"
"2082150","2083270"," headed toward a soft landing. "
"2083949","2090050"," After a summer projected softer core inflation data, we see upside inflation risks reemerging in"
"2090050","2090590"," the fall."
"2090870","2093810"," I think that's kind of funny that he says that, right?"
"2094090","2097650"," You can see that the stock market has outperformed since October."
"2098370","2101250"," I mean, actually pretty much at a bottom in May, June. "
"2101250","2110510"," We had a great dip by as well in October and then December, March, we're coming up to take a"
"2110510","2112050"," peak at all time highs, right?"
"2113690","2120530"," Likely to fail those all time highs or slightly break above and then have a beautiful pullback in"
"2120530","2120990"," the market."
"2121870","2125910"," So I think the entire market, entire sentiment is looking forward to that."
"2126790","2128410"," We'll discuss that at some point. "
"2128410","2134250"," If you want historical examples of that, I want you to realize that outside of this five minute"
"2134250","2142290"," chart here, there is a general sentiment amongst the masses out there that we're going to get a run"
"2142290","2146510"," to at least try to fail at all time highs."
"2147250","2150310"," Break over and then have a pullback."
"2150450","2154910"," So we're either going to get a pullback on all time highs or approaching it or a pullback just"
"2154910","2156230"," above all time highs. "
"2156470","2160130"," And until that sentiment changes, we're going to stay on that course."
"2165980","2168640"," I want to make a note on that comment that I just made too."
"2169180","2171660"," I want to talk to you guys about something about that. "
"2171700","2173020"," Let me see if I can bring this up here."
"2175740","2177120"," I want to be clear."
"2177120","2178620"," Let me clear about something here. "
"2181140","2189540"," Well, you're going to see as we get closer, unless we have some fundamental shift from the fed."
"2190460","2192620"," I want to be clear with you about something."
"2194960","2196680"," I showed this the other day. "
"2196680","2201380"," And I want you to know something."
"2201580","2204120"," Even if we get a pullback here today, this doesn't mean shit."
"2204260","2204440"," Okay. "
"2205220","2209480"," I want you to know that the market is poised."
"2215340","2217340"," These bears were wrong here."
"2218900","2220140"," They were wrong here. "
"2220340","2221020"," They were wrong here."
"2221160","2221340"," Okay."
"2222060","2223780"," And the market is poised. "
"2225580","2230400"," To come up and fail all time highs."
"2232180","2236160"," Meet all time highs and have a decent pullback."
"2238480","2239920"," Or break over. "
"2241100","2242980"," And make it all time high and have a pullback."
"2243820","2247340"," We're at a story last night about it hasn't been it's never been this cheap."

"2250000","2254500"," Put spreads and puts for a market crash."
"2255580","2258780"," And I want you to know that as we get closer up here."
"2259840","2265180"," The the company of bears and sellers, you're going to you're going to see. "
"2265860","2266980"," An increase."
"2268500","2271560"," In the drum beat of calling a top."
"2272400","2275620"," And the claims that they call the top. "
"2276420","2277980"," They're not calling the top."
"2278320","2283140"," We all know the sentiment of the market is that we're going to do this right here."
"2284360","2286260"," So there's no like top collar. "
"2286540","2287120"," They were calling."
"2287400","2288920"," They were calling crash down air."
"2288980","2292080"," They were calling crash down air down here down here. "
"2292520","2295760"," And they have not participated in any of this."
"2297700","2301600"," And they're being forced right now to participate in this."
"2301600","2304680"," These late cycle bull runs. "
"2305440","2307320"," Is when size comes in."
"2307700","2312200"," I want you to realize that size actually enters the market as we come up here."
"2312520","2315060"," They're forced into the market in size. "
"2315760","2322840"," And they will drive this market up to these upper targets up here before a substantial pullback."
"2323180","2326800"," Even when we get this substantial pullback."
"2326800","2331240"," It is likely going to go higher once again. "
"2332120","2337320"," So you're going to hear the top calling get really loud when it eventually does roll over."
"2337500","2339980"," You're then going to hear crash down here."
"2340600","2342280"," And they're going to be wrong again. "
"2343120","2343400"," Okay."
"2343480","2347240"," I want to be a make you aware of these two things that are going to take place."
"2348520","2350120"," You're going to hear this cacophony. "
"2351080","2356000"," In fact, I'm reading it right now in this article right here in the background."
"2356400","2358520"," It's just not reading that they're calling it."
"2359120","2362280"," You know, you got someone saying we're not getting a soft landing yet. "
"2362320","2363440"," You should have bought this dip."
"2364280","2367400"," You should buy this roll over here."
"2367460","2369820"," Whatever this takes place as well. "

"3744690","3754030"," vicinity this is where we got the bounce yesterday if you were coming right back up right now"
"3754030","3767180"," now there's another argument here and that is is the market forward looking does the"

"3776400","3783720"," to do their job if they make their money if the sound smart the question becomes uh is that"

"3801860","3811600"," Timeros getting back to him he's saying that"
"3811600","3821280"," um um economic growth has likely been too firm in recent months for Fed Chair Powell right"
"3822420","3829420"," now we discussed that a few moments ago we said he's done a great job in inflation he has not"
"3829420","3836340"," tamped down economic growth nor jobs has he uh economic growth has likely been too firm in recent"
"3836340","3841760"," months for Fed Chair uh pot of signal that Wednesday's increase in the Fed's benchmark short-term"
"3841760","3850780"," rate to a 22 year high will be the last of the current tightening cycle so Timeros is stating that"
"3850780","3862060"," the Fed will uh imply that the tightening cycle is not over or the threat of"
"3862060","3866600"," the tightening cycle will not be over so we're gonna we're going to listen to this really quick I"
"3866600","3872560"," got something for you to listen to I think uh he's also says that it could come down to whether"
"3872560","3878960"," the next few months of data settles an argument between the two camps of economists these are the"
"3878960","3892640"," people that say so we can listen to this most"
"3892640","3896960"," people don't really pay attention to what the Fed is doing but these days it feels like it's"
"3896960","3902160"," getting a lot of attention do you feel like it's like you're covering a sports team yeah yeah"
"3902160","3906820"," you're covering a winning sports team not in a sense of the Fed is winning but that you know when"
"3906820","3911680"," there's action when the team is doing well when somebody's getting hot then everybody's paying"
"3911680","3918180"," attention that's our colleague Nick Timeros he covers the federal reserve so he's always paying"
"3918180","3924340"," attention to what goes on at the Fed and for Nick tomorrow is like game day because the Fed is"
"3924340","3932080"," expected to raise interest rates again another attempt to beat inflation the increase Wednesday has"
"3932080","3937100"," been so widely telegraphed that it would be shocking if the Fed didn't raise interest rates so the"
"3937100","3942020"," question here is has the Fed done enough is this interest rate increase enough well does it tighten"
"3942020","3947820"," financial conditions enough where the Fed has confidence that the economy is going to continue to"
"3947820","3955480"," slow down and not re-accelerate the Fed's goal is to get inflation down to two percent we've made a"
"3955480","3961020"," lot of progress in the last year but we're sitting at around four percent and it's that last yard"
"3961020","3966660"," that economists are fighting over does the Fed continue to act aggressively because inflation is"
"3966660","3973740"," still a big problem or has it done enough and inflation is on its way down this has been sort"
"3973740","3980180"," of the central fight in economics for the past two years so you could compare it to two different"
"3980180","3986260"," football teams and whenever one inflation report comes out and it says oh boy inflation looks"
"3986260","3992280"," really bad you know one side is going to do an end zone dance spike the football I like the"

"4001790","4010990"," Jessica Mendoza it's Tuesday July 25th coming up on the show"
"4010990","4020710"," the Fed is expected to raise interest rates tomorrow will this be the last time this"
"4025730","4031930"," episode is brought to you by Empower journalists power personal dashboard or hey the Fed is going"
"4031930","4038290"," to raise interest rates by five percent of points over the next 14 or 15 months not very many"
"4038290","4043710"," people would have believed you and a lot of people would have said there's no way financial markets"
"4043710","4049650"," will manage that there'll be a complete meltdown in stock prices the bond market will go haywire"
"4049650","4055430"," hmm and so this is very unusual you would say it's quite unusual for the Fed to raise interest"
"4055430","4063430"," rates that rapidly so far those rate hikes seem to have helped inflation has dropped from its peak"
"4063430","4069890"," of nine percent to about four percent depending on what inflation measurement you use energy prices"
"4069890","4077010"," have come down goods prices are coming down housing rents are coming down that's a lot of success"
"4077010","4082790"," but getting inflation all the way down to where the Fed wants it to be that's where economists are"
"4082790","4091090"," getting stuck and disagreeing Nick breaks them up into two camps the first group says inflation is"
"4091090","4097670"," transitory temporary just due to these weird last few years and it's not deeply ingrained in our"
"4097670","4103010"," economy one group team transitory they're taking a bottom-up look at inflation they're saying look"
"4103010","4108790"," at the ground level whether it's car prices or rents you can see when they went up you can see"
"4108790","4114290"," they're coming down so just chill out here we see that they're coming down you don't have to weaken"
"4114290","4121270"," the economy more this group can go by another name the optimists the opposing group is more"
"4121270","4128050"," pessimistic they say inflation is likely to stay high without more action from the Fed I would call"
"4128050","4133410"," them team persistent they are worried that inflation will persist at a higher level maybe it won't"
"4133410","4140729"," be six or seven percent that we saw a year ago but still three or four percent would be"
"4140729","4146490"," uncomfortable and they're saying well wait a minute there are deeper underlying forces at work and"
"4146490","4150810"," if you look at the big picture you can see that there are people are making more money they're"
"4150810","4155810"," spending more they feel wealthier they have money to spend even if it's not keeping up with"
"4155810","4160930"," inflation and there's long as the people continue to spend you're not going to put the downward"

"4220010","4225110"," a lot of money because car prices went up so they had to jack up premiums but those things should"
"4225110","4231230"," also run their course and so the they would say hey Fed stop it with interest rate increases you've"
"4231230","4236690"," done enough it's going to fix itself it was always going to fix itself on its own in part you've"
"4236690","4243010"," slowed down demand enough that would be sort of the optimistic story here is that this all can come"
"4243010","4248170"," back down on its own and hopefully the Fed hasn't done overkill and we will have a soft landing"
"4248170","4255330"," lots of people including the Fed have said that the best outcome would be a soft landing meaning we"
"4255330","4261230"," can get inflation back down a target without risking a recession and many people's jobs that's"
"4261230","4267810"," always the goal it's very difficult to do there's a very thin list of examples of soft landings so"
"4267810","4274630"," I don't think the Fed has been- Three trigger both plus they're looking for a squeeze and a retest"
"4274630","4280970"," on the HV created a lot of unusual disruptions in the economy and so there are reasons to think"
"4280970","4285890"," that this time could be different of course every time I hear myself saying this time could be"
"4285890","4292250"," different I sort of want to slap myself because that's what people say in every cycle and it's"
"4292250","4297830"," usually not different the optimists think that if the Fed keeps raising interest rates that could"
"4297830","4303810"," hurt the chance of a soft landing and it could tip us into an unnecessary recession they want to"
"4303810","4308830"," give the economy time to metabolize all the changes of the last couple of them one the one minute"

"4315710","4321850"," energy housing and other consumer goods are coming down services and the labor that goes along with"
"4321850","4329510"," them is more stubborn average wages are still high think about all the things that you consume that"
"4329510","4335610"," are services you know going to the doctor getting your haircut taking your pet for lodging if you"
"4335610","4341070"," go on a trip and those are things that tend to be more labor intensive you're paying for you know"
"4341070","4344290"," when you get a restaurant meal you're paying for somebody to cook the meal for you and bring it to"
"4344290","4350890"," your table so the labor bill is a big part of that and the question now is how much of"
"4350890","4357690"," a slowdown in the labor market if any do you need to get that last bucket of inflation to behave"
"4357690","4364950"," more like it did before the pandemic this is exactly what team persistent the pessimists takes"
"4364950","4371970"," issue with for the optimists the labor market is one data point out of many for team persistent it"
"4371970","4378550"," is the data point basically they say that to make an anti-inflation omelet you're going to have to"
"4378550","4388480"," break a few eggs that's coming up gonna do"
"4388480","4394700"," if and so they've been arguing that look it's great that inflation is coming down but what are you"
"4394700","4399480"," going to do yeah there's an interview with uh nik tamarose right now three and a half percent or"
"4399480","4404660"," something closer to four percent and you've been saying that two percent is your target what are"
"4404660","4410240"," you going to do then these pessimists argue that inflation has to come all the way down to the"
"4410240","4417100"," fed's target of two percent getting close isn't close enough i would say the pessimists aren't"
"4417100","4422220"," necessarily saying the fed has to raise interest rates a lot more we're really arguing here about"
"4422220","4426700"," whether after wednesday's anticipated increase you're gonna have to raise rates maybe one more time"
"4426700","4431300"," i think the bigger issue behind that is just how easy is this going to be to get inflation to"
"4431300","4434840"," come down if the fed has to hold interest rates at higher levels for longer then you could begin to"
"4434840","4439640"," see more weakness in the economy over time good walkers through the logic behind what this camp is"
"4439640","4445140"," saying to get inflation that last mile down to two percent what what do you need to do well this"
"4445140","4449100"," camp is saying that they get inflation down that last mile you really need to get wage growth to"
"4449100","4455760"," slow wages reveal what employers think they can recover via prices or productivity and what workers"
"4455760","4461240"," expect given their own cost of living so the more pessimistic camp will say until you get wage"
"4461240","4470880"," growth to slow down you can't really be confident that you're going to get big picture"
"4470880","4476800"," is for people to lose their jobs and unemployment to go up typically you don't cover that last mile"
"4476800","4482520"," without a downturn because workers and businesses don't just you know voluntarily lower their"
"4482520","4489140"," prices or accept lower wages on their own think about your own situation at work for the last two"
"4489140","4494800"," years for most people inflation went up more than you're paid it and so when you're bargaining with"
"4494800","4500000"," your employer this year for what wage you should get next year are you really going to accept zero"
"4500000","4505380"," percent inflation adjusted pay gains probably not so now people are going to demand more pay and"
"4505380","4509640"," businesses are going to have to think about you know am i going to accept less margin let my profit"
"4509640","4514500"," get squeezed am i going to try to pass that increase along to customers that's what's going to"
"4514500","4519500"," determine how easy it is to get inflation down so i think if i'm understanding you correctly like"
"4519500","4525100"," wages are still going up which sounds like it's good for workers for the average worker like how"
"4525100","4530000"," could that be bad for the economy it is good for the worker i mean the best news is that"
"4530000","4534560"," in the last couple of months wages are now going up more than inflation so you are getting an"
"4534560","4539380"," inflation adjusted bump you know your money the money you're making now can actually cover your"
"4539380","4545780"," costs that's great the concern for anybody who wanted to see the economy slow down i.e the fed"
"4545780","4551680"," would be well if people are making more money that's going to allow them to spend more and if there"
"4551680","4557300"," isn't more supply then prices will go back up again and so team persistent argues that the fed will"
"4557300","4563060"," need to raise interest rates to help control wages but is there a scenario in which a resilient"
"4563060","4568800"," labor market might be good because it might bring about or help bring about a soft landing"
"4568800","4573240"," absolutely yeah absolutely i mean the fact that interest rates have gone up so much in the last"
"4573240","4577620"," year and the unemployment rate has basically barely budged it was at three point six percent in"
"4577620","4582780"," june you know that's a sign of resilience that you know the economy has been able to withstand"
"4582780","4589740"," higher rates so far and so maybe it has allowed the fed to fight inflation or at least manage"
"4589740","4593220"," against the risks that inflation would have gone even higher if they hadn't raised rates without"
"4593220","4599260"," having to do serious damage to the labor market okay it feels sort of weirdly paradoxical it is i"
"4599260","4603620"," mean everything about the economy over the past two years has been weird right i mean we shut"
"4603620","4609160"," everything down for a few months turn it back on and what we learned was it just you know it's"
"4609160","4616440"," a very complex thing and can't flip the switch why is it so important to get inflation down to two"
"4616440","4620660"," percent that's a really good question because you're going to be hearing a lot of people say maybe"
"4620660","4624680"," it's not so important to get it to two percent if you got it from nine to three take the"
"4624680","4631320"," win and don't focus so myopically on two percent now for the fed it's important because they said"
"4631320","4637860"," two percent was their target and the whole their whole strategy of targeting inflation i.e. having"
"4637860","4643160"," a target means you have to hit your target the fed believes that they have to follow through on"
"4643160","4647160"," what they said they were going to do to be credible and if you just declare victory at three"
"4647160","4650900"," percent then you won't be credible the next time inflation goes to four percent maybe people will"
"4650900","4655200"," say well they said two last time and they settled at three maybe four percent will be good enough"
"4655200","4661740"," and that's how you lose control of these kind of amorphous mystical inflation expectations got it"
"4661740","4666620"," right like so one camp is almost asking like is it worth risking a recession to maintain"
"4666620","4672900"," credibility and the other camp is saying kind of yeah yeah that's exactly it this is all about you"
"4672900","4678000"," know doing what you said you were going to do and that makes it easier to actually get inflation"
"4678000","4683400"," down next time because people will believe you know these things can influence sort of the vibes of"
"4683400","4690140"," the economy to an extent no matter which camp is right about inflation the average consumer"
"4690140","4694960"," shouldn't expect prices to drop two percent inflation or three percent inflation means prices will"
"4694960","4698400"," still be more a year from now than they were today it just means they won't be going up quite"
"4698400","4702040"," so fast that's the rate of inflation you know you're paying if you're paying like four or five"
"4702040","4704840"," dollars for a cup of coffee you're saying one isn't gonna go back to the three dollars or the two"
"4704840","4710200"," dollars i was paying before spoiler alert it's not going to go back once the price level goes up it"
"4710200","4714720"," usually doesn't go back to air there's a role risk that's not seen in the market just to head up"
"4714720","4723310"," just as it was going up are you a betting man Nick no i'm not all right so i'm going"
"4723310","4727310"," to turn that off right where we are just a couple things the market is showing an explosive move to"
"4727310","4733210"," the upside of bellows saying no that we can likely have a liquidation break here just be conscious"
"4733210","4739550"," of that if you get shaken out of a position uh now that end of that last part of that"
"4739550","4749150"," conversation is the secret squirrel and that is inflation has come down but the rates of inflation"
"4749150","4757310"," were not above and we need to actually get above the rate of inflation for you to see a lot"
"4757310","4764470"," of your costs come down and that has not happened yet we need to be above i believe seven percent"
"4764470","4768170"," seven and a half or correct me if i'm wrong on that number but i think it's somewhere around there"
"4768170","4774990"," seven point two five seven point five to begin to fight uh inflation and we were talking about that"
"4774990","4782250"," yesterday i think um um jay berry and i were saying yesterday that you know the the cheapness of"
"4782250","4790070"," money and as time passes uh makes money cheaper no matter what unless unless you're above the rate"
"4790070","4799930"," of inflation uh what you're going to end up seeing oh one second"
"4799930","4824660"," here the"
"4824660","4829220"," uh the rate of hold on a second i'm trying to try to have a text message conversation while we're"
"4829220","4837340"," trying to do a fed meeting um the rate of inflation is a problem if you don't get above the"
"4837340","4843720"," rate of inflation uh the stock market will price in uh ultimately inflation climbing over time"
"4843720","4852440"," right can't have uh cheap you can't have apple stock sitting sideways for two years uh and then"
"4852440","4871470"," when the rate of inflation marches on over time i'm"
"4871470","4882090"," having chat issues this morning now i did wonder about um we've been we've been trading these"
"4882090","4893430"," gas and oil refining and transportation stock tickers and i was wondering about um i"
"4893430","4899390"," was reading that story did you guys see that story about the readings in florida of the water temps"

"4989710","4996630"," for an upside target and it down it was ten bucks and fifteen dollars because of an eighteen"
"4996630","5006630"," percent implied move it was immediately rolled over and is"
"5006630","5012890"," now down at that ten dollars and nineteen cents are any of you going to take if any of you"
"5012890","5022810"," took that trade yesterday and snapped it was a um a wide wide wide wide trade on ten and fifteen"
"5022810","5028930"," dollars down the road let me know if you're going to take the money on the ten dollar or the"
"5028930","5034890"," ten dollar put for next week and then hold the calls to see if we swing up in the next"
"5034890","5045270"," two weeks on snap or not I'm interested to find out what your thoughts are on that um"

"5139310","5147070"," murky water or whatever now these buoys they take temperatures multiple times in an hour they give"
"5147070","5153830"," you an average reading it's not like oh for just one second it was 101 degrees and those buoys are"

"5263190","5270490"," guys knew what i paid for car insurance you your eyes would pop out of your head and uh what"
"5270490","5277550"," we pay for home insurance here is out of control as well now we do have something here in Michigan"

"5285710","5290910"," disagree with the intent of no fault insurance i believe that everybody should be able to have"
"5290910","5297370"," health insurance of some kind just like you have the fire department uh but because of how it's"
"5297370","5311340"," structured or built here it's a lot like you know insurance for all in the u.s it's greed we're"
"5311340","5314640"," insuring to the fire this is actually there a bunch of clowns they went paying premium getting"

"5380590","5387470"," looked like uh the the the broadcast from the meteorologist looked like a scene out of independence"
"5387470","5395410"," like uh like one of these movies like like i'm a climate denier and i'm on tv right now and"
"5395410","5402850"," we're super fucked it was hilarious because like i don't know what to say we're really fucked here"
"5402850","5412790"," we're in deep shit oops although i did i went down the rabbit hole with this climate science stuff"
"5412790","5423070"," last night quickly and uh like Nature magazine had something about a catastrophe coming in 2025 and"
"5423070","5430190"," uh it was really loosely written it was kind of like uh you don't know and um you know we"
"5430190","5434870"," all know what we're doing to the climate but then of course i went down um further to the rabbit"
"5434870","5442510"," hole and uh MIT had some scientists with big discussions on youtube the big like MIT did a big"
"5442510","5447510"," thing on this and i had to listen through uh fuck an hour and a half until i got to"
"5447510","5453690"," the point where they said yeah we're fucked but you're not going to see an ice age in 2025 it's"
"5453690","5460190"," still going to take we're over the tipping point it's going to get triggered around then probably"
"5460190","5465870"," have another 25 years until you're super fucked and then the fucked up part of it too is that it's"
"5465870","5471410"," like um well it's Europe that's fucked not the u.s so what do we care it's like me is"
"5471410","5480390"," so fucked up yeah yeah yeah that that's when they set it up that's when they said we triggered it"
"5480890","5485830"," they said we triggered it i think in uh 85 or not between 85 and 90 we actually triggered it"
"5485830","5491570"," uh that's when that's what we fucked up back then uh it was too late way back at 85 and"
"5491570","5499270"," between 85 and 92 i think they said it was too late uh in that time period they said now"
"5499270","5505250"," we're going to have uh the ice age is going to start in 2025 there's no coming back from it"
"5505250","5511230"," either the this one guy was like it'll still be another 25 or 50 years until you see the major"
"5511230","5516050"," effects of it uh and then the guy the guy from my team was like we can we fix it"
"5516050","5521090"," there guy was like no fucking way there ain't no fucking fix this you're totally fucked it's like"
"5521090","5533770"," oh shit yeah"

"5543100","5548200"," like the uh there's a lot of like fear news over this but at the same time all of these"
"5548200","5553620"," things have happened so uh but it's like on a scale of like what are you going to see in"

"5559120","5565400"," a woman you feel like 20s 30 years old you're probably not fucked but um and we'll probably adapt"
"5565400","5571720"," to living with it it's gross to say that but that's likely what'll happen you'll end up um it's"
"5571720","5577200"," gross to say that but it's likely what's going to take place you're going to have to adapt to um"
"5577200","5583740"," to that now i do want to let you know that there's likely going to be at some point some"
"5583740","5589220"," kind of weakness into this two o'clock hour here you often see that you'll see like hey it looks"
"5589220","5595020"," really bullish then you see that quick bloodbath and the move higher so i am looking to buy a dip"
"5595020","5600640"," down below if possible if you guys want to know my my idea here i've got calls right now from"
"5600640","5607340"," yesterday bought some calls in that close after the closing bell and i'm looking to add to that"
"5607340","5612880"," position today so i am looking for some kind of bloodbath down here if there's any kind of an"
"5612880","5615900"," extreme there's two there's a bunch of stuff i got to go over with you guys some of you guys"
"5615900","5620020"," know some of you guys don't uh so i'm going to go over some of this with you i want"
"5620020","5626640"," to talk get some key points out here for you okay uh number one key points as we head it's"
"5626640","5631120"," uh 12.22 we got an hour and a half so i'm going to go over some key points here"
"5631120","5637920"," number fucking one you do not have to trade today i make this statement known every single time we"
"5637920","5643580"," do one of these rate decisions and every single time somebody comes back inside the chat and they"
"5643580","5651480"," say something like uh i pick the direction right or they repriced it on me or i should have just"
"5651480","5658120"," waited until tomorrow i'm going to tell all of you out there right now there's no reason for you to"
"5658120","5666760"," trade these events um they what they do is they cause a lot of uh traders especially new traders"
"5666760","5672240"," not people don't understand them the mechanics that i don't mean understand i mean the mechanics of"
"5672240","5680880"," the market very quickly like your brain can compute oh shit i'm fucked or oh shit i'm not and"
"5680880","5687260"," you're actually not going to make mistakes so if you still want to have some skin in the game buy"
"5687260","5694420"," yourself one contract uh if you get a large account buy a hundred contracts don't be betting like"
"5694420","5698800"," fucking you know hundred percent of your fucking accounts then hundred percent of your accounts"
"5698800","5707700"," then doubling down um any of that kind of stupid shit so uh that's rule number one on these events"
"5707700","5717700"," usually the best trade is a reaction trade uh and that will likely take place after today uh"
"5717700","5723000"," if you miss a trade higher you'll have 2020 vision if you miss the trade lower you'll have 2020"
"5723000","5731100"," vision doesn't fucking matter uh you can make any excuse you want in the world it doesn't fucking"
"5731100","5736060"," matter and if anything this serves if you're going to trade this this is going to serve as a good"
"5736060","5742920"," time for you to break yourself out of crayon and preferably a triangle crayon in a piece of paper"
"5742920","5749680"," and uh go back and look at how you fucked up in your decision-making if you fuck this up"
"5749680","5757260"," so um there are some key points here to also say that would be this is our expected move up"
"5757260","5765580"," and down on this uh event oftentimes and there's one other thing to one of the key points here and"
"5765580","5772940"," that would be that you have more economic news coming out tomorrow in friday and you'll hear some"
"5772940","5777360"," bullshit about how you you'll always hear this news like well they're still waiting on more news"
"5777360","5783940"," thursday and friday uh you'll hear that bullshit after the fact now you have you have two events"
"5783940","5791360"," here you've got the press release uh we'll have that released here on the show live you then have"
"5791360","5800540"," the joron paul interview uh two vaul events you'll get a re-pricing inside of the initial news"
"5800540","5808380"," you'll get a re-pricing during the interview and you'll get a further re-pricing again as we close"
"5808380","5814220"," the day out i don't care if we're going up or down okay you're gonna get a re-pricing two"
"5814220","5820340"," three times you could pick the right direction and still be fucking wrong uh afterwards you could"
"5820340","5824980"," buy like you could sit down here and buy yourself some calls let's say you blow up bleed down right"
"5824980","5833820"," you buy some calls woo-hoo we fail right here they re-price then we go up we're right where"
"5833820","5839460"," you want to be and fail again and you're now wrong in in your in your in your trade does"
"5839460","5846200"," that make sense to you i got us i got to press this upon you spreads can can help with"
"5846200","5855860"," that time on your trade can help with that but if you're trading zero dates that kind of stuff i"
"5855860","5861740"," need you to understand that you will get re-pricing you guys one two and then even if we went"
"5861740","5869200"," up here you could possibly have three uh we have implied volatility right we've got um event"
"5869200","5875820"," volatility uh and we have vaul crush if you have any positivity that comes out of this uh just the"
"5875820","5883180"," event vaul uh we'll get crushed on you the interest will get crushed on you let's have to be very"
"5883180","5892720"," crystal clear with you on that on this note here would be when the presser starts uh it can be"
"5892720","5897740"," all the the price can be all over the place right we can trade up until just before the presser"
"5897740","5906780"," roll down into the presser and oftentimes you'll see negativity we could be way up here"
"5906780","5915520"," when the presser enrolls right back down here okay it hits both sides the expected upside the"
"5915520","5926040"," expected downside move actually would hit uh it would fail believe it or not and fail so"
"5926040","5933360"," you so be careful of the interview for the presser another point on the presser would be the"
"5933360","5939260"," questions that come at the end can sometimes be some of the most brutal questions that are asked"
"5939260","5944660"," and it's also about about two-thirds of the way through the pressers Jerome will oftentimes become"
"5944660","5951840"," very aggressive in his responses uh he will say things that are off script uh so be aware of that"
"5951840","5958100"," as well so you've got a lot of landmines pitfalls that kind of stuff along the way knowing where"
"5958100","5965560"," the expected move is you have the possibility of you know let's say you come down here you get a"
"5965560","5973120"," good release right you're going to be able to see a place to take uh a long or if you"
"5973120","5977960"," get the press relief we're coming down here let's say we get a bad press release you know not to"
"5977960","5984180"," buy calls right we could start to trade down to the daily trigger I also want you to be aware"
"5984180","5993620"," that there are bulls out there not just bears there are bulls out there that want to see uh a"
"5993620","6002840"," much lower target they're looking for 446 at minimum to get down to uh another note here is that we"
"6002840","6008880"," are getting close to a correction we're going to talk about that before uh the next next over these"
"6008880","6014160"," next 15 minutes we're going to take a look at the marketplace uh and we're going to talk about that"
"6014160","6022100"," so we're going to do that right now actually so we're getting close to a correction not uh top like"
"6022100","6036820"," we're going to fucking crash none of that stuff we're going to talk about that right now give me"
"6036820","6049050"," one second here the past"
"6049050","6056730"," uh past it's been chewing on it chewing on it for a couple days or no maybe two weeks uh"
"6056730","6063570"," and then discussing it with uh Joe and Quinn and a bunch of other people and then um people from"
"6063570","6072690"," the discord some admins and stuff and uh I was going through the mechanics of some of this stuff"
"6072690","6077790"," and I was like huh I was like I see something here so we're going to take a look at"
"6077790","6102390"," what I saw and uh we're going to we're going to look at that right now it's welcome"
"6102390","6109170"," to the show if this is your first time here now I want to draw your attention to something here"
"6109170","6119030"," okay and what I want to draw your attention to is uh two important things uh take"
"6119030","6128850"," notes because take notes so I want to draw your attention to uh the"
"6128850","6134250"," difference between a correction and a rollover so let me move this down here all right it doesn't"
"6134250","6138450"," matter so I want to show you a difference between a correction and a rollover you'll sometimes see"
"6138450","6145290"," price uh break below the yellow line right here uh but the yellow line continue higher right you"
"6145290","6152590"," got to pull back correction correction right here correction right here right yet the yellow line"
"6152590","6158490"," continues higher you can also see moments where we get a correction but the yellow line follows"
"6158490","6167010"," with price corrective non-corrective uh there's some other indicators as to if we're getting a"
"6167010","6173470"," correction or a roll in the market we have not fulfilled those that's down here we're not topping"
"6173470","6181430"," right now uh so we're not expecting a market top right now at this moment but we are expecting a"
"6181430","6187850"," correction and the reason for it is I want to draw your attention to when we begin to top out"
"6187850","6195170"," here and we are right now beginning to top out here uh whenever we see a decline a top and"
"6195170","6203530"," decline in uh deli velo uh we tend to get uh uh a weak moment inside the market same thing"
"6203530","6211490"," right here weak moments inside the market and we're starting to see that right now right here uh so"
"6211490","6221190"," we have high risk of a pullback here uh likely a break uh brief a brief break of the deli"
"6221190","6228350"," trigger to about 440 uh 440 446 somewhere in there we are setting up for it right now in a"
"6228350","6233250"," higher time frame does it mean it happens today no but I want you to be aware of it because"
"6233250","6239210"," we have an event today we have economic news that we're waiting on Thursday and Friday we are"
"6239210","6247050"," primed for that kind of uh downside move in the marketplace uh that the conditions are there the"
"6247050","6253070"," conditions are not there for this market to roll over but the conditions are there for us to uh"
"6253070","6269030"," take a roll down uh I'm going to show you something else right now I'm going to show you"
"6269030","6278110"," another chart here it's one nobody's seen here and I'm going to show you one other thing that's"
"6278110","6287950"," important here and this is on a swing trading chart for spy spoos doesn't really matter uh now we"
"6287950","6293710"," can squeeze up today on this event if we get good news we blast up here you might miss that"
"6293710","6299450"," trade on no we won't go that high but you get my point right though you get the illustrative uh"
"6299450","6307090"," point here you might miss the trade up today uh but when you're looking for prime candidates for a"
"6307090","6316750"," swing trade think tight for a second here like hey I feel confidence in this trade a multi-day"
"6316750","6326330"," trade to the upside uh we're not really where we want to be now saying that watch this yellow right"
"6326330","6331810"," here this yellow is telling me that whatever pullback there is will be corrective and not a"
"6331810","6336610"," rollover this yellow is saying uh we're extremely bullish right now this is actually good we're at"
"6336610","6342270"," a bull market uh we're not seeing declining value in the daily so any pullback that we have should"
"6342270","6349750"," be bought uh but it's not a prime candidate see this green down here it's not a prime candidate for"
"6349750","6356330"," a dip to buy with confidence you can actually see it right here hold on to actually see the"
"6356330","6361430"," confidence coming in to buy a move to the upside you can actually see another one right here"
"6361430","6368890"," forming right for some work confidence to buy a move to the upside right multi-day multi-week multi "
"6368890","6375530","-day buys to the upside do we see the green to the downside right now no we do not do"
"6375530","6378790"," we see the white to the downside right now no No, we do not. "
"6379310","6382330"," Do we see a major low on the five down here?"
"6382450","6383270"," No, we do not."
"6383850","6388630"," So on a swing trade basis, we already know that we're due for a correction."
"6389190","6393870"," We already know that we're not set up for a great trade over here, right?"
"6393950","6396630"," We're not down here already looking for a great trade. "
"6397270","6401230"," We don't already have it set up for us to get that beautiful trade."
"6401450","6404810"," You can see down here, wait to see this right there, right?"
"6404870","6406930"," We're not seeing that right there, are we?"
"6407470","6412990"," So not seeing this right now in a swing trade to the upside, I have no confidence."
"6414630","6420190"," Even if we go higher today, I have no confidence in the next week or two that we are going"
"6420190","6420570"," higher. "
"6421010","6424470"," Now we can, and price action will always prevail."
"6425190","6430650"," If at any point, you see price get above and across, you see price get above, let's say."
"6431310","6436550"," If you see price get above here and the red line goes down and price is up here. "
"6436550","6438210"," Sure, I'll take that long with you."
"6438730","6442430"," But the swing trade to the upside is not showing itself right now."
"6442590","6445810"," So that's number two against you if you're a bull. "
"6447350","6450670"," And I'm gonna show you one last one here in just a moment."
"6451410","6453350"," We are rolling right now in the market."
"6460600","6464520"," When this is the last one that I want to talk to you about, this is a day trader chart. "
"6465840","6468580"," And I want to talk to you about this last one right here."
"6468580","6473180"," On an intraday day trader chart, we're not at lows down here, are we?"
"6473440","6477480"," We are in the one minute, but not the one in five minute for even a one or five minute"
"6477480","6478340"," trade right now."
"6479400","6482120"," We are losing Velo on the hourly. "
"6482480","6486200"," I want you to look at the hourly here and we are losing Velo."
"6487120","6495200"," I want you to see the sideways movement right here of the hourly trading sideways and now starting"
"6495200","6496100"," to curl down."
"6496820","6499900"," So hourly is telling you we're bearish on a day trader chart. "
"6500440","6502180"," The hourly is telling you we're bearish."
"6502340","6504780"," We're not at a bottom on the one in five minute."
"6505100","6510000"," So even for a day trader one or five minute trade, there's nothing there for you. "
"6510560","6518880"," Now I do want to say to you if at any point you see price above the green here, you"
"6518880","6522620"," see a successful retest of the green line, right?"
"6522820","6523320"," We trade up."
"6527090","6528590"," We trade up, right?"
"6529050","6531190"," You see the green line turning up."
"6532170","6537130"," You have a successful retest and you see price above the white and yellow line. "
"6537590","6546090"," I'll get bullish and follow it up regardless of what, regardless of what Velo and the higher"
"6546090","6554290"," timeframe charts and the correction chart says and the 30 minute swing trade chart says."
"6555730","6559030"," So, you know, if price ever gets above all this stuff, sure, I'll take it along."
"6559230","6566970"," But the three things that I have are saying be wary into today. "
"6567070","6570970"," Now, saying that these events can be wild, right?"
"6571210","6574570"," These events can kind of like rip up all of your thesis is."
"6575110","6584190"," So for a bull, you have a lot of risk here today, a substantial amount of risk for a major"
"6584190","6585010"," roll down."
"6585750","6590890"," I'm going to warn you into this specific meeting that that's what I'm seeing in the background. "
"6591130","6592750"," I spent a lot of time late last night."
"6593050","6595610"," I was awake until three in the fucking morning doing this."
"6596450","6606390"," And for me specifically looking at that stuff last night, I would need to see, I personally would"
"6606390","6616310"," need to see either a target of 451, 446, 440 to long this market or I would"
"6616310","6622870"," need to see price above the hourly trigger, the one in five minute trigger with a successful"
"6622870","6623650"," retest. "
"6624670","6627510"," I wouldn't even trust a trade up here to hold."
"6628310","6634690"," I'd want to see some kind of reversal here like a failure here at 456, 40."
"6635530","6644410"," And then I would also need to see, I would need to see the movement up of the hourly trigger"
"6644410","6652590"," and I would also need to see a price to be above the whites and the red line and start"
"6652590","6654830"," to make its way up over here somewhere, okay?"
"6654990","6656410"," Whether that's today or tomorrow, I don't care. "
"6657190","6664710"," So I want you to know that in the background, the mechanics of the market are showing weakness that"
"6664710","6672350"," is unseen right now, regardless of what market making news there might be."
"6680750","6683030"," Did that piss off the bulls in this broadcast?"
"6683090","6684130"," I bet it did."
"6685470","6687270"," I bet it pissed off the bulls. "
"6699290","6701110"," That's all you need to know right now."
"6703030","6705030"," Just think of me as the black box here."
"6710140","6712060"," Can I take a look at IWM?"
"6733530","6742990"," I don't know if you're in the fourth or fifth day of a dip buy and is bullish right now,"
"6743030","6743590"," believe it or not. "
"6743730","6744910"," But all bets are off today."
"6745570","6754870"," I want to warn you that regardless of your positioning, the market rules over every other index out"
"6754870","6755170"," there."
"6755730","6761890"," Rules over DIA, like SPX, DIA, like DIA, kind of rules everything to extend. "
"6762630","6765390"," But the S&P 500 is one of the best bellwethers."
"6765470","6769610"," So even if IWM looks good, the greater market moves will prevail."
"6770030","6776650"," So for me right now, if you are trying to enter a position, bullishness on IWM, I'm going to say"
"6776650","6778090"," to you, wait until the event is done. "
"6800370","6803830"," Yeah, I mean, say right now, I'm looking at IWM, it looks great."
"6804410","6805650"," It looks overall great."
"6805850","6807130"," It looks really good overall. "
"6807130","6813070"," But, you know, it's like, there was another ticker yesterday."
"6813450","6819590"," We have to go over today, by the way, or if we have time today by end of day, we"
"6819590","6824130"," need to review Pack W."
"6824890","6832730"," We need to take a look at Pack W because Pack W is showing signs of a lot of other"
"6832730","6834410"," growth tickers."
"6836590","6837590"," Not necessarily bearish. "
"6840370","6842550"," As a matter of fact, let me take a look at this right now."
"6850350","6851650"," Yeah, it did catch a pound."
"6851810","6852750"," So I was wondering if it would. "
"6854010","6855170"," Good, good, good, good, good."
"6855470","6859270"," I want to talk to you guys about Pack W yesterday, and I didn't get a chance to."
"6860230","6863790"," There were some tickers that have been selling off. "
"6864950","6866370"," Now, there's another one, Spotify."
"6866370","6875150"," So I re-reviewed Pack W after the close yesterday, and I also looked at spot to fly yesterday."
"6876170","6884690"," And they're bouncing right now, and Spotify specifically is a beautiful"
"6884690","6894330"," Spotify, is a beautiful example of bullishness and a pullback to go higher. "
"6895410","6900850"," Matter of fact, Spotify is recovering right now, and we're going to review, if we have time today,"
"6902070","6910590"," we're going to try to compare and contrast Spotify to a lot of spec growth, and how you can have"
"6910590","6915010"," moments in these tickers where you get that major drawdown."
"6915590","6916770"," You know what, you have some cool?"
"6919750","6925530"," There's a lot of bearishness yesterday in the news on Spotify, and this is Spotify right now."
"6925630","6931930"," It actually bounced almost perfect on its weekly down here, and it's going to need some time to"
"6931930","6932790"," recover here. "
"6933330","6940630"," It's got some work to do to continue to go higher, but Spotify is one of those companies that was"
"6940630","6942810"," showing a recovery."
"6943530","6945470"," You know, it was all positive, positive, positive."
"6946310","6948190"," You get the initial move higher on it. "
"6948490","6950670"," We actually got a target on Spotify."
"6950670","6953170"," We hit our target on Spotify."
"6953750","6955550"," We have charted this one in the past. "
"6956010","6961590"," We tagged it, dude, 177-77, and people were wiling about that yesterday."
"6963110","6967790"," And people were crying, people were like people in the stream, people were panicking, and I was"
"6967790","6970530"," kind of shocked because we already charted this thing out."
"6971710","6981490"," And so if you're tactful here, you already knew that the first target was hit at 177, and you"
"6981490","6983370"," already knew to take your money. "
"6984430","6988230"," But another fascinating part about this was we went right down to the weekly."
"6989430","6994590"," So whenever sometimes, you guys know when I chart these things and I say, yeah, there might be a"
"6994590","6996590"," dip buy really low on this ticker."
"6997330","6998910"," Here's an example of it happening. "
"7000050","7004250"," And so people are like, I'm getting torched, and I'm like, well, wait a minute, why didn't you take"
"7004250","7011850"," your profit up here and why weren't you looking for a dip buy down here for continuation to the"
"7011850","7013810"," upside to that 196 and 215."
"7014330","7019830"," So I'm a little fascinated by the news."
"7020770","7023690"," I'm fascinated by the spinning of the news. "
"7024670","7029370"," I'm fascinated by bulls like did you not enter until we got up here?"
"7030250","7033050"," Did you see us chart this out?"
"7034290","7038370"," And actually, here's your blue, here's your monthly right here."
"7038750","7043850"," So if you have a recovery of the monthly and it's turning positive, believe it or not, if you have"
"7043850","7049830"," a recovery here, there could be a continuation back to the upside for Spotify."
"7050310","7059030"," So I'm always fascinated by the the cacophony of loud noise out there and what the truth actually"
"7059030","7059270"," is. "
"7059990","7062710"," So Spotify, we'll go over that one again later at some point."
"7070620","7078040"," We'll go over that one later at some point and review Spotify against some of these other tickers"
"7078040","7083120"," that we have in our investment portfolio and say, hey, if we go down there, are you going to be"
"7083120","7083540"," a buyer?"
"7083780","7084620"," Are you going to be a crier?"
"7084860","7088160"," Are you going to read the news and think, and believe the news, that kind of stuff?"
"7089720","7095040"," And we have some of these tickers are like, hey, we're squeezing right now to these huge highs."
"7095040","7097820"," Some of these tickers are like, we got a ton of vol ahead of us. "
"7098460","7102680"," Some of these tickers are, hey, we'll squeeze, but it's going to be six months down the road."
"7103860","7107860"," And some of these tickers are saying, hey, we're going to get a pullback down to that weekly at"
"7107860","7108360"," some points."
"7110800","7113640"," So fairly easy to see where to take profit on Spotify. "
"7114940","7121380"," Fairly easy to see the role and a couple lower bound targets to buy a dip on Spotify."
"7122600","7132360"," And I wonder who sold Spotify at 141.06. I'm fascinated if, because that's not the stops."
"7132500","7135140"," That's actually the buy and your stops are lower. "
"7137340","7143200"," So like you had the sell above people probably entering it, right?"
"7143680","7144900"," They're buying when you should be selling."
"7145660","7149600"," You've got the place to actually buy there are probably people selling."
"7149600","7153280"," And the stops are actually lower on that ticker. "
"7153900","7155600"," So I'm fascinated by that."
"7158300","7159540"," That up right there."
"7169220","7170620"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"7171180","7172660"," Yeah, happy JPOW day to you as well. "
"7173340","7174460"," I'm looking forward to this one."
"7175180","7177740"," I was pretty bullish into this."
"7179640","7185280"," Personally, I was pretty bullish into this meeting today. "
"7186180","7189980"," And I'm I'm slowly turning kind of kind of bearish here."
"7191820","7193460"," Maybe I just need to get it out."
"7198280","7200820"," Maybe I just need to get all the bearishness out of me today. "
"7202080","7203760"," Oh, you're doing well right on Rockwood."
"7205700","7208940"," I made I made about Basra and Chase happy today."
"7212460","7217940"," Yeah, I'm not necessarily bearish. "
"7217940","7219620"," I just know the setup is there."
"7221080","7223420"," So I got to let you guys know that it's there as well."
"7239230","7242750"," It's not that choice set up that I'm always looking for, right?"
"7244870","7246550"," You have the 30 up right now. "
"7248530","7250590"," The one minute goes down here."
"7255510","7257270"," I'm going to turn off Nick Timrose."
"7259210","7264660"," Put the new squacker on for you guys 1249. "
"7265720","7267480"," Our in 10 minutes left."
"7269180","7274040"," And the the chat, the poll is hawkish as well today."
"7278460","7285440"," I also want you to be aware that there are 117,000 calls. "

"7370470","7373150"," good news trade."
"7373950","7375490"," I'm interested in that trade. "
"7376310","7381650"," Now it is a come to me note is a hedge fund closes shorts and we start squeezing up before"
"7381650","7383270"," you get there more than likely."
"7384470","7385650"," More than likely."
"7393210","7394190"," Are you serious?"
"7394430","7396150"," We've got another storm coming tonight, dude. "

"7416120","7419080"," I've ever experienced anywhere."
"7420180","7424240"," When it comes to like outages."
"7425380","7427940"," You guys should go to like the Detroit Michigan subreddit. "
"7427940","7429520"," It's like every fucking week."
"7429620","7431800"," It's every fucking week in Michigan."
"7432000","7432760"," It's out of control. "
"7434160","7435720"," Let me check the news forecast."
"7438080","7439900"," I can't believe we're getting another one."
"7441340","7446020"," If the stream shuts off at any point today, I apologize. "
"7446020","7450160"," Should I just switch over to?"
"7451740","7458920"," I could switch over to the generator and turn on the breaker for turn off breakers to other stuff."
"7459900","7461200"," Oh, shit."
"7461340","7461700"," Look at that. "
"7467250","7469490"," Gus of 25 miles an hour."
"7469930","7470270"," Fucking awesome."

"7503750","7507650"," I need to be able to run the office out of Jenny too, I guess."
"7509010","7510050"," It kind of sucks. "
"7510350","7511130"," Oh, that's the other thing."
"7511230","7515750"," I was talking to a buddy in to Chaz and he was like, so now I want to run."
"7515750","7517990"," So now I want to run hard pipe. "
"7518910","7524670"," I want to run like some hard pipe and hook up the generator or convert the generator that I just"
"7524670","7528310"," got a new generator and convert it to natural gas."
"7530030","7531790"," That I like that idea."
"7532430","7535150"," So right now when we lose power, I can't leave. "
"7535530","7537070"," I have to stay at the house."
"7542250","7547830"," You have to stay at the fucking house and the wife and kids like Rod here and we've had a"
"7547830","7548970"," natural gas generator."
"7549590","7554730"," I would feel more comfortable with a natural gas generator not having to be here. "
"7563760","7566940"," Touching a rug pull right now on the spy."
"7581400","7582160"," Not bad."
"7582340","7583860"," Oh, not bad for six sessions. "

"7893070","7895590"," I think you are getting 25 BPS."
"7896370","7899650"," I think the language will change in the."
"7900490","7906430"," There'll be even more modification to the actual language of the press release statement. "
"7908070","7912850"," Further reinforcing a more lengthy pause."
"7913970","7917210"," I think you are going to get the language from."
"7918030","7918950"," Chair Powell. "
"7920750","7924110"," Trying to talk the market down to some extent."
"7925910","7927590"," With threats down the road."
"7928750","7930730"," I think that they need to keep threats. "
"7931430","7936410"," For higher rate on the road or an hour away to the headline event of the day, the US interest"
"7936410","7939290"," rate decision and FOMC rate statement following this."
"7942380","7948660"," So have an almost unanimous expectation here for a 25 basis point hike up to 5 spot 5% in"
"7948660","7949180"," this decision."
"7949820","7954000"," So this is from analysts and also from market pricing via CME FedWatch. "
"7954460","7959740"," Wish today has been sitting around 98 spot 9% chance scene of that 25 basis point hike."
"7961900","7966760"," So just as another reminder, our very own Tony is currently going through a prep video."
"7967660","7968940"," It's live on the website. "
"7969240","7969960"," Now, if anyone."
"7983230","7987050"," You also have the expected move to the upside right here."
"7987050","7990590"," This is about 456 46 does not take into. "
"7992690","7993290"," Consideration."
"7993630","7997450"," Any of the implied vol from zero dates being bought in this market."
"7997450","8000110"," We usually have a failure. "
"8004670","8007010"," We have a failure here where the before re pricing."
"8008130","8010730"," Same to the down the initial downside move."
"8010890","8012550"," You'll sometimes see a failure as well. "
"8013270","8014150"," Trying to clean out."
"8014370","8015870"," Thank you for playing kind of stuff."
"8018510","8020590"," We have the hourly trigger right here. "
"8024570","8030070"," You know that if price can squeeze above the early trigger."
"8031210","8035930"," But you are still looking for a back test of it and price to stay above."
"8036670","8040070"," The 27 and the 130 EMA's. "
"8041170","8043270"," Right now we're looking at a one minute chart."
"8044450","8048130"," We'll switch over briefly to the five minute chart see what that's looking like."
"8060380","8062900"," Also want to highlight the last six sessions. "
"8071230","8073110"," Kind of drew this out right."
"8073870","8076290"," Kind of fall that same path down there."
"8076930","8078390"," Fall this path to the upside. "
"8078750","8080230"," Now following the path to the downside."
"8081810","8084890"," Do we get the the squeeze of the squeeze higher."
"8086110","8090690"," From bottoming out or do we just begin to squeeze higher and head higher here. "
"8090910","8093810"," Does the fed get super duper dooper bearish."
"8093810","8097570"," We start blasting down to 446 and 440."
"8098270","8100450"," There are some indications here. "
"8104040","8106660"," That we are due for a correction."
"8107640","8109440"," And that there is not yet."
"8110620","8116200"," A swing trade showing itself on a 30 minute chart at this point. "
"8120890","8123130"," Events can reverse that of course."
"8123710","8126050"," But right now there is no swing trade."
"8126470","8128190"," Multi day swing trade for bulls. "
"8129310","8130950"," Proving itself at this moment."
"8132710","8136190"," The two yellow lines that you see right here are for the."
"8137110","8138430"," Actual presser. "
"8139690","8143790"," And the excuse me the press release and the presser."
"8147970","8149830"," We're under an hour until."
"8168610","8170070"," Jerome Powell gives. "
"8178310","8181970"," Yeah the the bots we've been fighting them in the background."
"8182150","8183730"," So we're tracking the bots."
"8184050","8187770"," We have one major issue in the discord and that's that it's open and free. "
"8188730","8190810"," So what happens is this is."
"8191670","8193809"," When you're a fine so if you're a gaming discord."
"8194309","8197910"," You're talking about not all gaming discords but they tend to attract people. "
"8198730","8200070"," That don't spend money."
"8200070","8205190"," They buy their their console they buy their games."
"8205990","8209410"," Now we of course we do have some kids with disposable income. "
"8209950","8213530"," There's that argument there but not quite like a financial discord."
"8213650","8214410"," Financial discord."
"8215129","8218049"," Know that everybody in there is pissing money away. "
"8219309","8221290"," They know that it's gambling right."
"8221670","8226490"," So you if you're a scammer you're going to target people with disposable incomes."
"8227170","8232209"," I know some people think that our followers have five bucks but from my experience our followers. "
"8232590","8237170"," Are high net worth individuals and I meet these people outside of the stream."
"8238290","8244049"," And these people have a lot of money in the line they have wealth and so scammers will try to"
"8244049","8244670"," go after."
"8245350","8248129"," People with disposable income right they want to spend money. "
"8248629","8251570"," So due to us having a open and free discord."
"8252510","8255850"," We are admins and moderators are constantly working in the background."
"8256549","8262430"," Trying to fight three kinds of people trying to fight off scammers bots. "
"8263750","8267950"," And wolves that come into the discord we're hyper aware of it right now."
"8268450","8273290"," And unless we close it or make an invite only or a small fee to be in there."
"8274330","8278830"," It's like just a layer to keep all these it's like the extra effort that it takes to be in"
"8278830","8278950"," there. "
"8279250","8282870"," You're just dissuading those people and it's good that you're not seeing it."
"8282870","8287350"," So if you're not experiencing this right now it means that the admins are actually doing their jobs"
"8287350","8288110"," very well."
"8290910","8291950"," Hot dog baby. "
"8294290","8296450"," Yeah David's great man great fucking trader."
"8297790","8299690"," You can't buy that shit anywhere."
"8300270","8303030"," I'm sorry you can't buy like can't buy this stuff anywhere. "
"8303690","8304410"," Nobody's offering."
"8304610","8310410"," Matter of fact I'm not going to name the company but I read this company put out a weekly"
"8310410","8311650"," newsletter on Saturday."
"8312389","8320350"," This company probably has 20 30,000 people paying for this newsletter somewhere in there 20 or 30 "
"8320350","8320690",",000. "
"8320830","8321330"," I was shocked."
"8322590","8325850"," I showed it to somebody last night late late and I was like can you believe this."
"8326430","8328330"," I was like this is what they put out on Sunday. "
"8328950","8330790"," I was like read this with me right now."
"8330930","8332750"," So we read we went over and read this thing last night."
"8333389","8336990"," I was like people pay fucking three four five six hundred dollars for this garbage. "
"8337650","8341850"," It's fucking every month like hot fucking garbage."
"8358950","8361469"," Jimmy's like Jimmy's like Joe Joe donut."
"8362110","8366230"," I'm telling you there's bulls out there that are like please please just dump the market. "
"8367770","8373430"," Those are like just please give me a chance that my one like 10% like the devil on the"
"8373430","8374209"," shoulder is like."
"8375030","8378469"," They're not going to let these they're not going to let these fucks buy for 40."
"8378750","8380770"," They're going to force them to chase the upside. "
"8382110","8383870"," That's the little devil on my shoulder."
"8384070","8390270"," It's like all these fucking bulls think they're getting a fucking all these fucking strokers all"
"8390270","8391330"," these fucking bulls are."
"8391530","8393810"," That's the thing about a bull market right is that. "
"8395410","8399150"," You're out there and you're like yeah yeah you're like I just I'm bearish today."
"8399350","8400230"," Why are you bearish?"
"8400490","8401650"," Well because I want to buy a dip."
"8402990","8407390"," Whenever you hear that in a bull market it's going to squeeze and you're going to chase. "
"8408170","8411270"," The whole point of a fucking bull run is that you're just constantly chasing."
"8414630","8416590"," You don't ever get the dip that you want."
"8420350","8424570"," You're constantly looking for the dip right then then you're at a top and you're finally by the"
"8424570","8424850"," top. "
"8444460","8446280"," Turn that off right there."
"8452790","8457570"," Your theory is an actual good trader doesn't need to sell a goddamn thing they should be able to"
"8457570","8458770"," make more money trading."
"8458770","8462530"," They ever good in some descriptions and that's why I'm here. "
"8463790","8465550"," I agree and disagree with that statement."
"8468590","8474850"," The cost and time and money for a good trader to put out things is very expensive."
"8475410","8476130"," It's not cheap. "
"8477730","8481270"," And then of course you get to a point if you're a good trader."
"8481710","8484510"," I'll be honest I could just be sitting on a fucking beach right now."
"8485050","8487690"," So why the fuck am I spending my time with you guys I'll be honest. "
"8488770","8493270"," So you know if there's good data and good there was two parts to this."
"8493430","8498290"," There's time the cost and then data is not free like matter of fact I was just looking at data."
"8499270","8503670"," Yesterday I was on the call with the dev data 15,000 a month. "
"8504110","8510030"," Who's fighting that fucking bill and then you've got people like David and you got admins putting"
"8510030","8511670"," all their time and you got to keep them interested."
"8512290","8516830"," So you got to you got to like at some point make sure they stay interested or else it devolves"
"8516830","8517410"," into garbage."
"8519550","8524250"," You know there's a bunch of problems with this where I was talking last week with someone about"
"8524250","8524770"," GME. "
"8525850","8527510"," I was using GME as an example."
"8528630","8536650"," There's like a do-gooder out there and like the do-gooder is like GME and a do-gooder problem."
"8537010","8540890"," I tried to explain I was in a meeting last week and I was like there's this thing called a"
"8540890","8541390"," do-gooder. "
"8541390","8547050"," And they kind of like they're not traders they're not investors."
"8547890","8553830"," They think they're doing a good thing and then they break what was a good thing."
"8554450","8560830"," So Wall Street Bets had a really good thing going trade Wall Street trading GME and then do-gooders"
"8560830","8563250"," told everybody in my view. "
"8564150","8569390"," And then of course the sharks came around and then of course they broke it."
"8569390","8574130"," You know the sharks broke it and because too many people knew."
"8575170","8578670"," So there's that and then there's the other there's some other issues too. "
"8578710","8587650"," There's issues of if it's free people don't value things people psychology believe it or not like"
"8587650","8592190"," human psychology is the pay for something even if it's cheap it's more valuable."
"8593270","8598310"," Another fascinating thing too is our chat here so here's an example of this."
"8599010","8608670"," Our chat in YouTube and which became a very counter alpha very destructive due to being free"
"8608670","8609410"," and open. "
"8610250","8616770"," So we charged a minimum fee I think it was five bucks on both and a free option but you"
"8616770","8619550"," had to take steps to become able to chat."
"8619550","8624010"," So like right now you can chat for free with us but you have to take steps like if they"
"8624010","8627390"," go to Amazon subscribe to Prime Gaming to the channel."
"8627970","8633550"," And what it does is it increases the quality of alpha and the chat. "
"8634090","8639210"," So not everything free is actually good start with that not everything free that you get is"
"8639210","8639910"," actually good."
"8641390","8646870"," So there's I used to think the same thing that you think and then I realized that's not really true"
"8646870","8648610"," there's like parts to this they're not true."
"8648610","8651490"," There's like caveats or gray area or something. "
"8652470","8658390"," So you need to like get out the bad alpha in the chats you have to keep you can't have"
"8658390","8665230"," the do gooders running the show to right so you have too much of a mix of do gooders and"
"8665230","8667950"," they actually break what you're trying to do."
"8669010","8674850"," So GME was a classic example of that you get people that understood what was happening people that"
"8674850","8676330"," understood when it was going to break."
"8676330","8683450"," And then once you have you get overrun by you maybe have 3,000 people 5,000 people and then"
"8683450","8690870"," you get 100,000 people that that that that rollover of people attracts and breaks what you're"
"8690870","8691330"," trying to do. "
"8693050","8693970"," Believe it or not."
"8694190","8703770"," So it's like counter to what you think you're doing."
"8703770","8706810"," There's a trainer on to fit into it. "
"8706970","8712470"," Some of us know I'm not going to mention her name but she released a cool thing publicly and it"
"8712470","8716210"," was broken in a month because it was free and open to everybody."
"8717310","8721950"," And then you attract scammers wolves all these other fucking monsters out there."
"8722590","8724210"," So there's an issue with that too right. "
"8724570","8733530"," And then you've got the cost of what you're doing."
"8741310","8748510"," But when you start to scale this stuff to help for free people out there."
"8749070","8754670"," It's hard to stay open or free to some extent, not fully just to some extent. "
"8755370","8757150"," So then you want it to continue on right."
"8759010","8764770"," So you know if you're trying to do this day in day out over the years, you need to attract"
"8764770","8769390"," people that will continue doing this and then keep them interested."
"8770630","8773950"," So they continue to provide data and then the services all cost money. "
"8774490","8778930"," You know like all this equipment in here costs fucking bank dude like serious money and we wouldn't"
"8778930","8781710"," be doing this if we didn't have people donating to the stream."
"8781710","8787610"," You know they're like I got like 15 20 K in here and that doesn't count any of the broken"
"8787610","8788990"," existing broken over the years."
"8791250","8792990"," Like that's a whole nother cost. "
"8794470","8798390"," I think at one point it was costing me every month and just services."
"8799190","8804590"," I think every year sponsored by 15 or 20 K ticks right allows you to actually hear water flowing"
"8804590","8806570"," futures forex and stock instruments."
"8806570","8812670"," So the entire like the entire thought that if you're a great trader should be free. "
"8813230","8815130"," It holds weight to an extent."
"8815630","8819110"," Like if you're fucking around and been to it and just posting here we're going up here we're going"
"8819110","8819330"," down."
"8819570","8820550"," I agree with that statement. "
"8821170","8825130"," I don't agree with it as it grows because I know that I'm feeling the pain."
"8825830","8827550"," My wife is pissed off at me."
"8827690","8828770"," It's like hey 300 grand. "
"8828970","8829270"," What are you doing?"
"8829550","8833550"," Like I don't know what I'm doing."
"8834370","8836910"," We're going to shut this shit down or make it self sustainable."
"8837970","8839590"," That's the only answer she wants to hear. "
"8842130","8843810"," You're going to set it all down."
"8852890","8854190"," That's kind of where we are right."
"8856850","8857590"," Yeah, yeah. "
"8858070","8859470"," We're at that point right now."
"8859670","8863070"," We're actually in the background stuff you guys can't see."
"8867630","8876110"," We have to constantly be trying to have an edge that no one knows about and roll that stuff out"
"8876110","8876570"," over time. "
"8876830","8882930"," We have to constantly be trying to fight losing the edge and we have to make it self sustainable."
"8883830","8886630"," If it doesn't become self sustainable it just goes away."
"8887530","8892870"," So you have one you have like a you have like a flag waiver out there saying, you know, that's"
"8892870","8893050"," state. "
"8893050","8893810"," That's a statement that was made."
"8895130","8898830"," But yet that person waving that flag probably doesn't know that."
"8899770","8900650"," Two things. "
"8900970","8903070"," One that those things eventually go away."
"8903270","8904410"," They just shut down and go away."
"8905250","8908990"," And that flag waiver typically will go somewhere else to the next thing. "
"8909430","8909770"," Right."
"8910270","8912830"," To the next thing they can find that works for them for free."
"8913110","8915330"," So they have no skin in the game. "
"8915590","8917350"," They have no care if it goes away."
"8918710","8924070"," Again, I'm saying so if you understand that out there, then you do if you don't you don't."
"8925930","8929650"," You just go from thing to thing one thing to the next thing to the next thing. "
"8938030","8941490"," Yeah, good job there Tony cheese just said Mr. Yen put out a post."
"8942290","8943070"," Ended it with."
"8943830","8945010"," I'm feeling higher, baby. "
"8945490","8945810"," Good luck."
"8946090","8947830"," So Mr. Yen is bullish air."
"8947830","8951470"," I trust Mr. Yen. "
"8952070","8953910"," So thanks for posting that in the chat."
"8964030","8964670"," We'll see."
"8964870","8965630"," I've got calls, man. "
"8965730","8967010"," I bought some calls that bottom yesterday."
"8967310","8968690"," We'll see if they print today or not."
"8968970","8971690"," So we start squeezing higher. "
"8973270","8976190"," I think the bulls have that one good thing going for them."
"8976310","8977150"," That's rear view mirror."
"8977750","8980150"," Rear view mirror is a powerful fucking thing. "
"8980930","8981410"," Powerful."
"8996650","8997730"," Yeah, I like Mr. Yen."
"8998070","8999650"," I always still watch him all the time. "
"8999850","9001830"," He is I have a lot of trust."
"9002050","9007750"," He's a fucking one of the best like day traders on a live stream period of all time."
"9008190","9009390"," He is the fucking goat. "
"9009670","9010430"," He is the man."
"9020920","9025960"," Yeah, there's there's a there's a reason for it."
"9025960","9029200"," It's not always profit driven while they do the discord. "
"9029280","9030420"," It's not really profit driven."
"9030560","9032660"," It's just time effort costs."
"9034540","9035800"," There's no need to do it. "
"9037720","9039160"," There's like there's a guy out there."
"9039280","9039860"," His name is Derek."
"9040120","9043680"," And he sells a newsletter every month. "
"9044140","9045640"," And my fucking love it."
"9045760","9046240"," I think it's awesome."
"9046860","9048260"," I like the time that he puts into it. "
"9048720","9049440"," There's another guy."
"9049560","9049700"," Chris."
"9049820","9051660"," Marko puts a ton of information out. "

"9072140","9073520"," Say how much time do you put in your newsletter?"
"9073660","9075080"," I think you charge is 20 bucks a month. "
"9076060","9078620"," I got no problem paying that for Scott."
"9078840","9080240"," So volatility was doesn't newsletter."
"9080240","9082680"," That guy puts a lot of fucking time into what he does. "
"9083700","9086980"," The guy's a professional guy comes from a hedge fund background."
"9087700","9091300"," And he takes the time to put out a newsletter every week."
"9091900","9093180"," I got no problem paying that guy. "

"9128020","9130540"," I don't know if you're making that much money."
"9130700","9131920"," Then what do you sit in my stream for?"
"9137220","9141680"," I find mostly it's people trying to get it slide by on the cheap because they're not making money. "
"9142180","9143160"," That's my suspicion."
"9144140","9146040"," Because I paid for services all these years."
"9146320","9147620"," I paid for them because they help. "
"9148100","9149580"," They help me to make money."
"9150440","9153060"," If you're making money, you don't care about the cost of services in my view."
"9161750","9163090"," Hey Stacy, what's going on?"
"9173320","9175240"," Oh, I should have said Krista Mackerel. "
"9176360","9178020"," I should have said Krista Mackerel."
"9178320","9179600"," I shouldn't say Krista Marco."
"9180420","9181480"," I probably shouldn't say. "
"9182020","9182960"," What's the other one I say?"

"9203440","9204280"," You've got unusual will."
"9205400","9206800"," You're like, you need an edge."
"9207060","9209480"," Edge is a fucking hard thing to get. "
"9210340","9213600"," Edge is like, that's the thing, man."
"9214140","9216860"," We were talking about the discord the other day."
"9218180","9219160"," I was speaking with some admins. "
"9220380","9226300"," There are some people in the discord that are trying to run like EMAs without an edge."
"9227680","9229640"," They're acting like they got an edge and they don't."
"9230420","9231740"," It's kind of bizarre to watch. "
"9232300","9233680"," And I'm like, okay, whatever."
"9234380","9239960"," Like having an edge is like not an easy thing to get."
"9242620","9249700"," Forget about management and patience and emotions and not waiting for the right setup. "
"9249920","9252460"," Just having an edge is a hard thing to get."

"9282660","9289000"," I'm going to go potty."
"9290040","9293460"," The other thing that I don't do is the, um, I don't do sponsors."
"9293460","9294220"," Either. "
"9294240","9298440"," I should have done sponsors, but I don't like, I don't like, well, I don't mind."
"9298580","9299420"," Maybe I'll do sponsors."
"9299760","9303080"," I have to like, like the sponsor believe in the sponsor. "
"9304220","9305360"," And, uh, who else?"
"9305520","9308480"," I don't know who's just said bear set bear or bear town sheriff said something."
"9309220","9310240"," About no edge."

"9320060","9322480"," Uh, like I like people with conviction. "
"9322480","9323520"," Like we're going there."
"9323520","9324220"," We're going there."
"9324720","9326080"," I don't care if they're wrong. "
"9326260","9332120"," I'm paying for conviction usually if it's, um, someone giving me their insight."
"9333440","9334960"," I don't really care if they're wrong."
"9343230","9344910"," Yeah, it's not the same version. "
"9345190","9346590"," So you guys don't know some of this stuff."
"9346730","9349870"," So like the thinkorswim, uh, the thinkorswim."

"10358260","10359200"," interest rate decision."
"10359400","10364600"," So the again medium forecast expecting a twenty five basis point high cut to five and a half"
"10364600","10370640"," percent as this is almost unanimously expected to also get the FOMC rate statements as well. "
"10370640","10375100"," So for anyone interested we've just posted out a prep article did post us out earlier in the"
"10375100","10377880"," morning as well just thought we'd post this out again for you."
"10378200","10382700"," It goes over some investment bank views on what to expect for this so just going to go over some"

"10387760","10392460"," And they comment that the Federal Reserve is set to resume its policy tightening today inflation is"
"10392460","10397160"," moderating but remains well above the target and with a tight jobs market and resilience activity"
"10397160","10399960"," officials may feel that they can't take any chances. "
"10400640","10405720"," So the Fed will continue to signal prospects of further hikes according to ING but with the credit"
"10405720","10409400"," cycle turning ING doubt that it will carry through."
"10409860","10415400"," So after 10 consecutive interest rate hikes over the previous 15 months the Federal Reserve left"
"10415400","10421880"," the Fed funds rate unchanged at the five to five spot 25% range in the June meeting while it"

"10426900","10433080"," updated fed forecasts released in the SEP in that meeting signaling a broad consensus behind the"
"10433080","10435940"," idea of two more rates rises later in the year."
"10436600","10441320"," So just away from the ING piece now this has been signaled by multiple Fed officials before the"
"10441320","10447480"," blackout period while being one expecting to additional 25 basis point hikes this year. "
"10450870","10454390"," So back to the ING view ahead of the US interest rate decision."
"10455130","10460630"," So ING notes that Fed Chair Powell had previously stated that the long and varied lags in monetary"
"10460630","10465390"," policy meant that the decision should be interpreted as a slowing in the pace of interest rate"
"10465390","10470370"," hikes rather than an actual pause with regards to the pause at the June meeting."
"10471250","10476070"," So while inflation is moderating it is still far too high and jobs market remaining very tight that"
"10476070","10477170"," cannot take any chances. "

"10529310","10535350"," sound like I'm bearish I don't like the idea of momentum leaving meta right now. "
"10537550","10544170"," My my thesis here is that or Facebook I should say I don't think I can ever call Twitter X"
"10544170","10545610"," by the way I don't think I can do it."
"10546570","10548630"," It's sitting on its daily trigger right now."
"10549630","10555430"," Looks like the dip was bought on meta at 130 for a move higher. "
"10558770","10564780"," I like the by that took place on the 24th right the dip was bought on the 24th."
"10566330","10575270"," The daily velocity though is counter to meta right now there's a lot of velocity leaving meta right"
"10575270","10577530"," now so underneath the surface."
"10579370","10588110"," Now if meta were let's say if meta were to trade above 302 at the close today and hold that"
"10588110","10590230"," number I'd be bullish maybe buying the underlying. "
"10591470","10596370"," But for a discount I would love to buy a 242."
"10600460","10607060"," Not necessarily like not bullish on meta it's just by here probably not."
"10607060","10614230"," I do like the by that took place though on the 24th. "
"10623860","10633730"," I'm going to check ES really quick in tighter check SPX."

"10818730","10822690"," Maybe at the end of the day if you don't have any followers on Twitter you're like five followers"

"10823990","10824970"," I will follow you."
"10826730","10828410"," So we can do that end of the day. "
"10830030","10835010"," We'll do is I'll get on Twitter and if you need somebody to follow you I will follow you."
"10846670","10849410"," Hey random random things support the stream appreciate it."
"10855130","10859010"," Yeah it's weird they it's actually more watchers than 400. "
"10859930","10865390"," So it's kind of weird like YouTube intentionally does not show my actual watchers right now."
"10866090","10871630"," They don't show me until end of the day."
"10871630","10875190"," I can tell me I had like two three four thousand watchers really bizarre. "
"10876230","10879310"," Like I think they what I was told is that they."
"10880430","10885090"," What I was told is they won't show you how many people are actually watching the stream."
"10886050","10891970"," In case you are doing something various like committing suicide or crime. "
"10891970","10899490"," Right statement on live streams for decision median forecast sees a 25 basis point height to five"
"10899490","10903150"," spot five percent from the prior five spot to five percent."
"10903690","10904490"," It's really wild."
"10904710","10908690"," So like if you're live streaming they will not show. "
"10909490","10914210"," How many people are actually watching the front analysts commentary ahead of this US interest rate"
"10914210","10914530"," decision."
"10914530","10916510"," So comments from Black Rock."
"10917010","10920270"," So they say that the Federal Reserve is set to height rates again this week. "
"10920690","10923290"," Yeah markets have been taking this in stride they know."
"10923310","10929290"," It's like a new US core inflation has revived hopes for rate cuts next year."
"10929730","10933030"," And this can fuel a ball run across assets for some time. "
"10933370","10939670"," Black Rock do note that until it runs into some disconnect between a fast falling inflation and"
"10939670","10941530"," stronger than expected economic activity."
"10943750","10949550"," So just a note on Tesla here also to seeing some comments from a JP Morgan's doctor David Kelly"
"10949550","10950770"," regarding this rate decision."
"10951190","10956530"," So it says at both parts of the feds mandate continue to trend in the right direction and JP Morgan"
"10956530","10959350"," expect the feds to hike another 25 basis points today. "
"10959910","10964910"," So they say that the market clearly agrees and is pricing in at the time of writing their piece a"
"10964910","10967310"," 96% probability of another hike."
"10967310","10972930"," Looking to the CME Fed Watch tool now still showing around a 98 spot 9% chance of this."
"10973810","10978710"," So JP Morgan's doctor David Kelly does say that regardless of the end of the fed hiking cycle looks"
"10978710","10980470"," closer than it did earlier this year. "
"10980910","10985510"," It was this week's chart showing the market expects no further hikes for the remainder of the year"
"10985510","10987130"," assuming we get a hike today."
"10988050","10993490"," However he does note that the market appears too pessimistic in its outlook for rate cuts with only"
"10993490","10996970"," one full cut expected in the first quarter of next year."
"10997310","11001770"," And a cumulative 125 basis points of cuts for the year in general. "
"11002350","11009650"," So the Fed often raises rates on an escalator before being forced to take an elevator down with"
"11009650","11013730"," rates falling on average 275 basis points within the first year of cuts."
"11014190","11015410"," Dr. David Kelly notes."
"11017610","11022050"," So I will chart Tesla for you later but nothing has changed with Tesla. "
"11022890","11032510"," 262 is the bottom for Tesla right now though I think it comes down again and still sees that"
"11032510","11035510"," 222 that we talked about the other day."
"11036870","11039190"," Now if we get a positive bet."
"11039190","11043250"," With the JP Morgan it's a buy almost $2 billion of mortgages in the Pac West deal. "
"11043950","11053270"," You could still see a retracement mean reversion half back trade on Tesla up to 277"

"11202750","11206530"," You get the FOMC rate statements that will be coming out of with the interest rate. "

"11213230","11215030"," forecast a 25 basis point hike."
"11215650","11221510"," So they say that when the FOMC last met on June 14th the committee had left the Fed funds rate"
"11221510","11223490"," unchanged for the first time in 10 meetings. "
"11224010","11229010"," However, world's Fargo noted the FOMC signal that its tightening cycle was unlikely to be over at"
"11229010","11229390"," that point."
"11229390","11234990"," And the Darvish policy decision was delivered with a hawkish message via the summary of economic"

"11239890","11244810"," year is 50 basis points higher than the prior quarterly SAP that was released in March."
"11245690","11250290"," However, with the FOMC having raised rates 500 basis points in a little over a year. "
"11250770","11255370"," The committee believed it prudent to hold the policy rate steady in the month of June in order to"
"11255370","11259370"," assess the additional information on how the economy was weathering in the key."
"11265910","11273040"," It was also noted that markets appear braced for the likelihood of further tightening in the month"

"11485550","11487070"," Hike 25 basis points."
"11487250","11488350"," Hike 25 basis points."
"11488550","11490490"," Hike to five spot five percent as expected. "
"11491110","11494290"," So seeing the Fed here, they're sending banking system is sound and resilient."
"11494910","11498210"," The Federal Reserve raising the key overnight rate by that quarter point as expected."
"11498750","11502050"," We'll continue to assess additional information and its implications for policy. "

"11512050","11516390"," Fed says it will continue to assess additional information and its implications on policy. "
"11518290","11522130"," And adding that they are strongly committed to returning 2% inflation targets."
"11523950","11528410"," So he said does add that it will continue to reduce its bond holdings as described in the"
"11528410","11529570"," previously announced plans."
"11530690","11535970"," And Fed says the recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate"
"11535970","11537670"," pace versus a modest pace. "
"11537950","11539850"," So that was said in the June statements."
"11540450","11543010"," Yeah, that's a change there to change in the growth."
"11543490","11549610"," And also says that tighter credit conditions are unlikely to weigh on economic activity, hiring and"
"11549610","11552030"," inflation, the extent to which remains uncertain. "
"11552850","11557030"," No change in the rate increases change."
"11557030","11557730"," It was unanimous."
"11560990","11566590"," No change in verbiage on the press release or in the S&P 500 and some weakness emerging in the"
"11566590","11566910"," dollar. "
"11571250","11573750"," We are strengthening HYG right now."
"11575910","11579610"," Strengthen Apple strength in IWM right now."
"11582440","11584880"," Just a note on that dollar weakness. "
"11584880","11586580"," It's coming down to retest."
"11586800","11587300"," It's five minutes."
"11587300","11597030"," The only change"
"11597030","11602470"," noting here is that the recent indicators suggest economic activity has been expanding at a"
"11602470","11603750"," moderate pace. "
"11604430","11607590"," And so the language used in the last report was a modest pace."
"11608850","11612550"," It was really interesting that we have put out the full FOMC rate statement on the feed."
"11612830","11614410"," That has changed at this point. "
"11617370","11619870"," The HYG is just ripping your face right now."
"11620010","11621150"," Strengthen the S&P 500."
"11621610","11622670"," It's just pairing some of its gains. "
"11622950","11623870"," So it's up around spot four."
"11624050","11625950"," Sorry, down around spot four on the session now."
"11627210","11629030"," Apple showing strength right now. "
"11639230","11641710"," U.S. interest rate futures put the chance of a FedHike."
"11641810","11646970"," That's why it's showing strength right now on the Q64 as well after that statement."
"11647430","11650350"," They are just waiting on fixing what its reaction is. "
"11650570","11655250"," Putting the chance of a FedHike in September at 18% and a 36-pot fight."
"11655250","11657670"," It's why G ripping faces off right now."
"11658290","11660090"," Going back to retest, it's previous I."
"11660330","11662910"," Newest treasury yields are dipping after the Fed rate decision there. "
"11663210","11673290"," 10-year yields lasted around 3.8-1.1%. Sorry, that's 3.8-8.1%. This"
"11677090","11679330"," stream is sponsored by Tixriche."
"11679590","11681350"," Tixriche allows you to actually be away from the point."
"11681370","11683030"," Looks like the market is waiting on. "
"11683030","11684230"," Just the heads up out there."
"11684350","11690730"," Looks like the market is waiting on a recheck of Dixie right now."
"11690950","11695350"," Dixie's coming down to test 101-22. "
"11695470","11698910"," You'd want to see that rolling over effect on Dixie for the market."
"11699170","11700150"," It starts to explode to the upside."
"11709980","11715330"," Watching some percent after that. "
"11715790","11718930"," In November, it was 37-pot 3%."
"11718930","11722630"," It's dropped now to 36-pot 5% after this statement."
"11724030","11726590"," Watching and re-pracing right now in the options chain. "
"11728270","11732590"," Let's see your first venture event ball kicking off this right now."
"11738670","11740310"," No, that's the one here."
"11740310","11744310"," One thing that did not change was about 8-3% after the Fed. "
"11745010","11748930"," So the two and 10-year curve inversion lasted minus 101 basis points."
"11750690","11760510"," One thing in this press release that did not change was pause with an introduction"
"11760510","11764230"," of language of no further rate hikes planned."
"11764830","11765910"," So that did not happen. "
"11766110","11774110"," So you have similar language to the last press release where the Fed is still open to more rate"
"11774110","11776130"," hikes down the road."
"11776130","11784870"," Now, in the presser, you're going to be looking for Jerome's statement on how soon they're going to"
"11784870","11787370"," expect or consider another rate hike."
"11787650","11788450"," Is that September?"
"11789090","11790230"," Is it December?"
"11790790","11791670"," Is it next year?"
"11793510","11797030"," Now, that's not quite data dependent either. "
"11797510","11800750"," So that's good for bulls, believe it or not."
"11801270","11802530"," It's not bad for bulls."
"11802710","11806890"," I know bulls will take that as negative, but it is not overall negative for bulls. "
"11807890","11816410"," The longer that there's a threat of raising rates, even if they do not, keeps this market alive"
"11816410","11817970"," historically."
"11818930","11826450"," The moment they actually cut rates or leading into the cutting of rates, you will usually see the"
"11826450","11829970"," market front run, a significant move to the downside."
"11831950","11834530"," I know that's counter to what you're told on Fintuit. "
"11844940","11848380"," So again, just reading into the Fed statement here."
"11848520","11852420"," So it is said the Fed are to consider the extensive additional firming in order to curb inflation."
"11853560","11861300"," Yeah, you usually see a big ramp up into pricing in a rate cut or if it's unexpected or immediate"
"11861300","11861800"," drop. "
"11863580","11872660"," So right now that opens the window to bulls overall for the bull run to continue for a longer"
"11872660","11875160"," length of time actually into 2024."
"11876880","11881520"," So positive overall news in a higher time frame for bulls, believe it or not."
"11881620","11883400"," I know you don't want to hear that, but that is the case. "
"11891280","11893220"," You might get a roll over here."
"11893420","11896340"," You'll probably still likely tag the upper and lower end here."
"11897760","11899800"," You'll still likely hit these today. "
"11903110","11905010"," Event vol rolling off though."
"11912580","11916320"," And the Fed has been more open with their decision making."
"11916720","11924460"," So we actually, to prove that point, you saw the market roll over before we got rate increases. "
"11925240","11928600"," Jerome Powell went public and said, we're not going to do any surprises."
"11928600","11929920"," We're going to tell you guys everything."
"11930680","11935640"," And so you watch the market roll on spec growth and other sectors. "
"11935900","11939700"," Then you saw the roll over in the indexes in 2022."
"11940220","11941820"," All of that was front run."
"11942120","11948540"," You'll see that same front running take place or you're anticipating that same front running to"
"11948540","11951980"," take place once they do finish with their rate hikes. "
"11952360","11957340"," So as long as they threaten, even if they give you a pause, as long as they're threatening the"
"11957340","11964760"," possibility of more rate hikes, that will extend the potential for the bull run to be over."
"11965360","11971500"," Now, even if you had weakness today or a correction, still doesn't signify that that major roll"
"11971500","11976160"," over that's going to retest the previous lows that were at one time at 3450."
"11986350","11987550"," Yeah, I like that idea. "
"11987670","11988010"," I like it."
"11988510","11988970"," I like it."
"11989330","11990990"," Fed's working on inflation, baby. "
"11993870","11994610"," It's a pot."
"11994790","11995950"," I'm taking this as a positive."
"12002150","12005750"," And we'll still watching Dixie here in the background and see what its reaction is. "
"12017750","12019130"," We now have the presser."
"12019210","12049850"," I'll have the presser live for you here in just a moment at 2.30. I've"
"12049850","12052090"," got it on right now in the background for you."
"12052410","12054570"," So we'll have the presser up for you live. "
"12070430","12072910"," One minute chart's getting bullish right now."
"12079360","12082780"," 30 minute chart not looking for anything extended at this point."
"12083660","12086180"," Any kind of an extended multi-day move at this point. "
"12086800","12089580"," Trying to break above the hourly trigger right now."
"12089580","12090760"," Try to form that cluster."
"12090780","12100700"," We have a bull plane forming right now with a bull cluster on the H "
"12100700","12104860",".C. This is the 90 heads up in under 20 minutes time now to get the F.M.C. press"
"12104860","12106480"," conference following the right decision there. "
"12106660","12107860"," We'll see if we get a move there."
"12107860","12109600"," A lot of it is possible to move here."
"12109600","12110780"," I'm going to move up here. "
"12112180","12120080"," Before 2.30. Be careful me charting that for you right now because once we get close to it we"
"12120080","12124440"," only have 20 not quite 20 minutes we got like maybe 10 minutes left."
"12125460","12130160"," You could be getting bullish right now and then as we get closer to that presser they'll roll it"
"12130160","12134420"," down on you due to the presser volatility that's ahead."
"12139280","12144780"," So this is a bullish setup right here but I don't think it's anything that is sustainable. "
"12146160","12147880"," If that makes any sense to you."
"12152610","12159770"," When there is a bull cluster forming not confirmed and even if it was to squeeze it would need to"
"12159770","12163870"," confirm and that is where the long is right there believe it or not."
"12164010","12164970"," Not where it is currently. "
"12169750","12174250"," I guess I should say there's like a quick but three minute or two minute play here to the upside"
"12174250","12175870"," but not something that's sustainable."
"12184460","12186340"," Tesla making a move to the upside."
"12186620","12188080"," H.Y.G. bullish is fuck. "
"12190640","12193840"," Dixie getting annihilated right now that's good for bulls."
"12197700","12200500"," Apple NDX moving to the upside right now."
"12224720","12227480"," This red line is when the presser begins. "
"12228960","12234200"," I'm going to move it slightly over to 425 just so that we have a warning sign."
"12235620","12237500"," We have more vol entering here."
"12257250","12260310"," Bullish day trade and one minute chart bullish at the moment. "
"12284050","12286950"," 455s were pretty steady around 80 cents."
"12287870","12293410"," They draw 89 cents and they dropped to 72 cents now trading a dollar 13."
"12347950","12349770"," You're craving candy right now. "
"12350170","12360070"," So my wife buys expensive caramel chocolates like these small like Swiss chocolate bars and"
"12360070","12361170"," nobody liked them."
"12361530","12364170"," Now my youngest loves them and I don't eat them."
"12364350","12366990"," She keeps them in a freezer for me a little mini fridge to have. "
"12367850","12374010"," And I haven't been eating them but they've been just stacking up and they're stacking up in there."
"12374590","12381110"," And so I went over to the freezer yesterday looking for one and they were all gone."
"12382090","12385270"," So the culprit is likely my youngest daughter. "
"12386830","12396010"," And I remember being a child and my father would progressively over the years"
"12396010","12403850"," consume shittier things so that kids wouldn't eat or drink at all."
"12403990","12409690"," I remember turning like 21 years old and we would have friends over all the time."
"12409850","12412370"," And we started drinking my dad's beer. "
"12413510","12421050"," And so my dad would like start getting worse and worse flavored beer to deter my friends and I from"
"12421050","12422030"," drinking all of his beer."
"12422850","12425910"," And so I feel like I'm in that phase right now with my youngest."
"12426670","12430210"," Let's find a candy that my youngest will not want to eat. "
"12448010","12449270"," I kid you not."
"12449630","12451150"," Your old man did that too."
"12451410","12452150"," Yeah exactly. "
"12453310","12462630"," It's like my dad was started drinking like my dad had plenty of money."
"12463990","12468970"," I actually remember that label to this day and we were like this is nasty shit."
"12469570","12472990"," And then we would start to we started to figure out what he was doing. "
"12473890","12478510"," And we used to joke around that we were like some days just going to start buying like old English"
"12478510","12480970"," forties and mad dog 2020."
"12482690","12486450"," But we had already learned we drank all the slow gin when we were underage."
"12486450","12491950"," We would we'd raid the bar and we'd drink the shit that nobody drank like slow gin. "
"12491950","12494090"," If I don't know if any of you guys ever drank slow gin."
"12495150","12497210"," Man like nobody drinks that shit."
"12497950","12502850"," So we were in there pounding the slow gin because it had dust on it. "
"12502950","12503950"," Probably would have killed us too."
"12504030","12506110"," It didn't even realize probably sat in there for like 20 years."
"12511170","12518030"," What's that stuff that that that rotten fish that you get from like Amsterdam from Sweden and"
"12518030","12522530"," Norway like get some of that canned rotten fish and put a chocolate label on it or something. "
"12530170","12534530"," You guys ever do and that stuff you like go inside your parents bar and you're like okay and"
"12534530","12536290"," someone just said they mix the liquor right."
"12536890","12541510"," And then like you like you like pour a bunch of it into like a glass with your friends and"
"12541510","12544330"," you're like ah they'll never know man they'll never fucking know."
"12544770","12549290"," And what's really bizarre is some liquor bottles have little tick marks on them. "
"12549290","12551970"," But it's just it's just like a mark in the bottle."
"12552130","12555570"," Your dad didn't make it but you know you're not sure if your dad made that mark or not."
"12557870","12560510"," Yes you're a strong man that stuff is nasty. "
"12562430","12562930"," Nasty."
"12565150","12565930"," Super nasty."
"12575500","12578900"," No joy right now for call or put buyers. "

"12618520","12619440"," or down move minimum."
"12620620","12624520"," If not we'll get the one percent to two percent up down move. "
"12624940","12629800"," And right now there's this call seller out there and a put seller and they're like high five in"
"12629800","12630120"," each other."

"13046850","13047050"," too."

"13225820","13227940"," It's almost as bad as it has to wait. "
"13250770","13260010"," Another note here as Chair Powell speaks if he touches on anything bearish I will highlight it for"
"13260010","13261090"," you as he speaks."
"13261930","13268570"," So if you hear me speak whilst Jay Powell speaking it'll be considered a negative for bulls okay."
"13269250","13272610"," Not necessarily roll over just he says anything. "
"13273030","13274210"," Here he goes coming up right now."
"13289850","13293030"," They have the press conference video is now live."
"13293610","13294850"," Jerome is still not out. "
"13296830","13298310"," Here he comes right now."
"13307120","13308000"," Good afternoon."
"13309720","13315200"," My colleagues and I remain squarely focused on our dual mandate to promote maximum employment and"
"13315200","13316960"," stable prices for the American people. "
"13317720","13322900"," We understand the hardship that high inflation is causing and we remain strongly committed to bring"
"13322900","13324020"," inflation back down to a two percent goal."
"13324780","13329660"," Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve."
"13330580","13333620"," Without price stability the economy doesn't work for anyone. "
"13333940","13338980"," In particular without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market"
"13338980","13340720"," conditions that benefit all."
"13342520","13345420"," Since early last year the FOMC has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy."
"13346980","13354040"," Today we took another step by raising our policy interest rate a quarter percentage point and we"
"13354040","13357560"," are continuing to reduce our securities holdings at a risk pace. "
"13358420","13363200"," We've covered a lot of ground and the full effects of our tightening have yet to be felt."
"13364200","13370040"," Looking ahead we will continue to take a data dependent approach in determining the extent of"
"13370040","13372060"," additional policy firming that may be appropriate."
"13373580","13377700"," I'll have more to say about monetary policy after briefly reviewing economic developments. "
"13379540","13383960"," Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace."
"13385200","13388920"," Growth in consumer spending appears to have slowed from earlier in the year."
"13389680","13394980"," Although activity in the housing sector has picked up somewhat it remains well below levels of a"
"13394980","13400380"," year ago largely reflecting higher mortgage rates and higher interest rates and slower output"
"13400380","13403440"," growth also appear to be weighing on business fixed investment. "
"13404860","13407000"," The labor market remains very tight."
"13407360","13412420"," Over the past three months job gains average 244,000 jobs per month."
"13413340","13417860"," A pace below that seen earlier in the year but still a strong pace. "
"13419200","13425720"," The unemployment rate remains low at 3.6%. There are some continuing signs that supply and demand"
"13425720","13427740"," in the labor market are coming into better balance."
"13428780","13434360"," The labor force participation rate has moved up since last year particularly for individuals aged"
"13434360","13436000"," 25 to 54 years."
"13437520","13443160"," Nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing and job vacancies have declined so far this"
"13443160","13443440"," year. "
"13444460","13450600"," While the jobs to workers gap has narrowed labor demand still substantially exceeds the supply of"
"13450600","13451240"," available workers."
"13453040","13456900"," Inflation remains well above our longer run goal of 2%."
"13456900","13464300"," Over the 12 months ending in May total PCE prices rose 3.8% excluding the volatile food and energy"
"13464300","13472360"," categories core PCE prices rose 4.6%. In June the 12 months change in the consumer price index or"
"13472360","13480820"," CPI came in at 3.0% and the change in the core CPI was 4.8%. Inflation has moderated"
"13480820","13482720"," somewhat since the middle of last year. "
"13483600","13487700"," Nonetheless the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go."
"13489700","13495360"," Despite elevated inflation longer term inflation expectations appeared to remain well anchored as"
"13495360","13501280"," reflected in a broad range of surveys of households businesses and forecasters as well as measures"
"13501280","13502620"," from financial markets."
"13503900","13508480"," The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment. "
"13508480","13510720"," These are all neutral statements by the way."
"13511320","13518120"," My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship as it erodes"
"13518120","13524200"," purchasing power especially for those least able to meet the higher cost of essentials like food"
"13524200","13526100"," housing and transportation."
"13527480","13532680"," We're highly attentive to the risks that high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate and we"
"13532680","13536420"," are strongly committed to returning to inflation to our 2% objective. "
"13538020","13542540"," At today's meeting the committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by a quarter"
"13542540","13546800"," percentage point bringing the target range to five and a quarter to five and a half percent."
"13547920","13552400"," We are also continuing the process of significantly reducing our securities holdings."
"13553800","13558960"," With today's action we've raised our policy rate by five and a quarter percentage points since"
"13558960","13559960"," early last year. "
"13560960","13565000"," We have been seeing the effects of our policy tightening on demand in the most interest rate"
"13565000","13566540"," sensitive sectors."
"13566640","13567500"," It comes the money shut."
"13567860","13568800"," Particularly housing and investment. "
"13569760","13574740"," It will take time however for the full effects of our ongoing monetary restraint to be realized"
"13574740","13576540"," especially on inflation."
"13577680","13582600"," In addition the economy is facing headwinds from tighter credit conditions for households and"
"13582600","13583040"," businesses."
"13583620","13584920"," Just said headwinds that's positive. "
"13584920","13586660"," Economic activity hiring and inflation."
"13588180","13592840"," In determining the extent of additional policy farming that may be appropriate to return inflation"
"13592840","13599100"," to 2% over time the committee will take into account the cumulative tight nigga monetary policy the"
"13599100","13605140"," lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial"
"13605140","13605820"," developments."
"13606540","13611940"," We will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting based on the totality of the incoming"
"13611940","13617400"," data and their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the"
"13617400","13618040"," balance of risks. "
"13619500","13624780"," We remain committed to bringing inflation back to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term inflation"
"13624780","13626460"," expectations well anchored."
"13627140","13631220"," Seeing the effects of tightening some sectors below trend growth."
"13631760","13635120"," Looking in the rear view mirror stuff right now. "
"13635360","13640080"," Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable"
"13640080","13641900"," prices over the longer run."
"13642900","13648000"," To conclude we understand that our actions affect communities families and businesses across the"

"13649220","13651600"," Everything we do is in service to our public mission. "
"13652660","13657000"," We at the Fed will do everything we can to achieve our maximum employment and price stability"
"13657000","13657460"," goals."
"13658060","13659560"," Thank you and I look forward to your questions."
"13660840","13664580"," So that's pretty forward looking for a presser there was not a presser. "
"13664800","13665100"," Thank you."
"13666720","13669240"," I think a couple times in your opening remarks."
"13669680","13670100"," It's right. "
"13670380","13671560"," Lasting off right now."
"13671620","13673700"," The extent of additional policy from it may be appropriate."
"13673700","13675320"," Apple blasting off right now. "
"13675400","13681940"," To mean that additional hikes are likely on the way and should we also believe that all future"
"13681940","13686400"," meetings say September and November are live or are you in a every other meeting mode."
"13686720","13687000"," Thank you."
"13687240","13689800"," So we haven't made a decision to go to every other meeting. "
"13690000","13691140"," It's not something we've looked at."
"13691140","13696140"," We're going to be going meeting by meeting and as we go into each meeting we're going to be asking"
"13696140","13697240"," ourselves the same questions."
"13697620","13699720"," So we haven't made any decisions about about any future. "
"13699920","13702680"," That's a big one right there that's not competing after meeting."
"13702680","13707000"," It's every meeting for further tightening that may be appropriate."
"13707000","13709920"," You read the language to return inflation to 2% over time. "
"13710840","13714700"," I would say that the intermeeting data came in broadly in line with expectations."
"13715260","13716960"," Economic activity remained resilient."
"13717520","13722880"," Job creation remained strong while cooling a bit and the June CPI report actually came in a bit"
"13722880","13724660"," better than expectations for a change. "
"13726060","13730920"," And the June CPI report of course was welcome but it's only one report one month's data."
"13731560","13738320"," We hope that inflation will follow a lower path as it will be consistent with the CPI reading but"
"13738320","13740220"," we don't know that and we're just going to need to see more data."
"13740520","13744820"," So what are we going to be looking at really it will be the broader the whole broader picture and"
"13744820","13751060"," starting with we're looking for moderate growth right we're looking for supply and demand through"
"13751060","13752740"," the economy coming into better balance. "
"13753640","13761660"," Right now on E500 we'll be asking ourselves does this whole collection of data as do we assess it"
"13761660","13766740"," as suggesting that we need to raise rates further and if we make that conclusion then we will go"
"13766740","13767460"," ahead and raise rates."
"13767760","13771900"," So that's what that's how we're thinking about the next meeting and you know how we're thinking"
"13771900","13775740"," about meetings going forward potentially but you know we're now mainly thinking about the next"
"13775740","13776000"," meeting."
"13776600","13781800"," I will also say since we're talking about it between now and the September meeting we get two more"
"13781800","13783640"," job reports two more CPI reports. "
"13784280","13786600"," I think we have an ECI report coming later this week."
"13786880","13793000"," Gap being filled right now on spoons and lots of data on economic activity all of that information"
"13793000","13796520"," is going to inform our decision as we go into that meeting."
"13797020","13801880"," I would say it is certainly possible that we would raise funds again at the September meeting if"
"13801880","13806220"," the data warranted and I would also say it's possible that we would choose to hold steady at that"
"13806220","13806460"," meeting. "
"13807040","13813020"," We're going to be making careful assessments as I said meeting my meeting and I'll close by saying"
"13813020","13817480"," we've raised the federal funds rate now by 525 basis points since March 2022."
"13818040","13823120"," Monetary policy we've taken a victory lap right now just a note that he is taking a victory lap in"
"13823120","13824040"," a speech right now."
"13824140","13827800"," If I could just briefly follow up on something you should even on a tough question data in the"
"13827800","13831640"," intervening period that is a victory lap in line with expectations. "
"13832420","13836100"," Does that mean there's unlikely to have been a change in the overwhelming outlook of the committee"
"13836100","13837220"," that two more hikes are necessary?"
"13838680","13840280"," I'm just going to go back to what I said."
"13841340","13845200"," That's the question we have eight weeks now until the September meeting and all that data that I"
"13845200","13850700"," recently learned and all that it's moving up and expect the move in the S&P 500 to fill the"
"13850700","13853260"," final gap above that but it's just one reading."
"13853540","13861200"," We've seen this before over a moment there many forecasts call for for for inflation to remain low"
"13861200","13864500"," but we just don't know that until we see the data so we'll be focusing on that. "
"13867160","13869620"," Thank you."
"13870060","13871740"," Thanks for taking our question to Chair Powell."
"13872420","13876480"," Obviously you upgraded the language around growth in the statement today. "
"13877020","13881740"," You know we've seen the Barbie movie numbers we've seen everyone going to Taylor Swift concerts"
"13881740","13886680"," this summer it seems like the American consumers in pretty good shape and it does seem like growth"
"13886680","13892440"," is a little better doing well and I wonder from your perspective if that continues."
"13892700","13896720"," If I want to put on the four fifty six seventy five forty six eighty four."
"13896880","13898840"," You've got the early trigger balloon. "
"13899340","13903680"," The one in six racing up at the last of the ball."
"13903780","13906920"," It's smashing all you're thinking about that sort of trajectory."
"13907420","13912440"," Dealers also have four fifty eight as a possibility to go up all at the fourth of the eight twenty"
"13912440","13920120"," three believe it or not that we've been able to achieve disinflation so far without any meaningful"
"13920120","13923580"," negative impact on the labor market the strength of the economy. "
"13923840","13926280"," Overall that's good thing."
"13926460","13927700"," It's good to see that of course."
"13928040","13932040"," Coming into the line right now right here just be aware of that right there. "
"13932180","13933800"," I will support you get activity going forward."
"13933880","13939080"," Another level above it that would be at the margin stronger growth could lead over time to our one."
"13939200","13942400"," Let's see if there's more above their response from monetary policy. "
"13943120","13946420"," So we'll be watching that carefully and seeing how it evolves over time."
"13950580","13952980"," Thanks to your pal Neil or one from Axios."
"13953320","13957580"," So as you referenced earlier in the inter-meeting period there are just brushing up. "
"13958100","13959320"," There's questions still strong."
"13959620","13960240"," Get out of here."
"13960400","13961120"," Pick your lap time. "
"13961400","13962060"," Get our fucking thing."
"13962340","13963200"," Get the fuck out of the face."
"13963540","13963540"," Independence. "
"13964400","13964700"," Why not."
"13964980","13965160"," Unreal."
"13965740","13966080"," Stay on hold. "
"13966180","13969200"," Why not take another meeting off when they're cutting in the direction you want."
"13969360","13969960"," Mission accomplished."
"13971140","13972120"," Dropped the microphone. "
"13973040","13978800"," If you go back to see what we're trying to do here we're trying to achieve a stance of policy"
"13978800","13981420"," that's sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to two percent."
"13981740","13986020"," At the last meeting we wrote down our individual estimates of that."
"13986020","13990480"," Now say no one breaking above what's in addition to one. "
"13991060","13998340"," So I would say we looked at the inter-inter-meeting data and as I mentioned broadly consistent."
"13998900","14003480"," Not perfectly consistent but broadly consistent with expectations and as a result we went ahead and"
"14003480","14004360"," took another step."
"14005320","14009480"," And that's you know a labor market that continues to be strong but but gradually slowing. "
"14009780","14011460"," Oh yeah he's fucking victory lapping."
"14011700","14012060"," Hopefully."
"14012680","14012760"," Yeah baby. "
"14012760","14013740"," It's actually a little better."
"14014400","14018720"," He has a victory lap that we're going to be careful about taking too much signal from from a single"
"14018720","14019060"," reading."
"14020160","14022220"," Now growth came in stronger than expected. "
"14022260","14025120"," No 50% and so we did take a step back."
"14025120","14027280"," A little bit of negativity or not even negativity."
"14027900","14031480"," Just the threat of more rate hikes possible. "
"14032220","14034140"," Do it a victory lap right now."
"14034340","14035180"," Chair Powell markets."
"14035900","14036920"," Nick Temeros up next. "
"14036980","14042740"," I'm seeing participants inflation forecast from June for the fourth quarter of this year will be"
"14042740","14048240"," too high given autos and shelter that by September that may warrant a downward revision and the"
"14048240","14050520"," inflation forecast of 20 to 30 basis points."
"14051380","14057380"," Would that type of inflation progress be enough to hold rates steady from here or do you need to"
"14057380","14063720"," see below trend growth and decelerating labor income growth to be convinced that you've done"
"14063720","14063900"," enough."
"14064400","14067100"," So it's hard to pick the pieces apart and say you know. "
"14067420","14073480"," Like we're looking at everything and you know we'll of course we'll be looking to see whether the"
"14073480","14080780"," signal from June CPI is replicated or or the opposite of replicated or whether it's somewhere in"
"14080780","14081060"," the middle."
"14081180","14082200"," We'll be looking at the growth data."
"14082200","14084640"," We'll be looking at the labor market data very closely of course. "
"14084980","14086780"," This is definitely more tough."
"14087040","14092680"," I think but with a particular focus on on making progress on inflation."
"14093480","14098380"," Last month you said there were benefits to moderating the pace of increases because it would give"
"14098380","14099180"," you more information. "
"14099180","14099840"," That's right."
"14099860","14101420"," Nick's bringing up a good point here."
"14101420","14103420"," The report like the one we just had in June. "
"14104000","14107780"," Allow you to at least maintain that slower pace and defer until the fall."
"14107780","14110880"," Any decision on whether you need that second rate hike."
"14111620","14114340"," So I'm just going to tell you again what we're going to do in September. "
"14114340","14118600"," We're going to look at two additional job reports two additional CPI reports."
"14119360","14120480"," Lots of activity data."
"14121240","14124860"," And that's what we're going to look at and we're going to make that decision then and that decision"
"14124860","14130120"," could could mean another hike in in September or it could mean that we decide to maintain at that"
"14130120","14130460"," level. "
"14132200","14137180"," ourselves is is that is the overall signal one that we need to do more that we need to tighten"
"14137180","14137460"," further."
"14137960","14141520"," And if we get that signal whenever we get it then and that's the collective judgment of the"
"14141520","14143420"," committee then we will move ahead if we don't."
"14144080","14149720"," You know then then we'll have the option of maintaining policy at that level but it's it's fine"
"14149720","14150640"," with a new high. "

"14159440","14169040"," So consumer confidence in the large part because of the of the decline of 56 pages are also rising"
"14169040","14174460"," faster than prices now after trailing the new high on the spy just how much are Americans truly"
"14174460","14180640"," harmed by inflation at its current level headline level of 3% and with that in mind when do you"
"14180640","14183920"," put some weight back on the new high for this bullrod for our schools."
"14184600","14186320"," So I guess I'd say it this way. "
"14186560","14191360"," First it is it is a good thing that headline inflation has come down so much because that's really"
"14191360","14196600"," what the public experiences and and I would say that having it headline inflation moved down that"
"14196600","14200120"," much almost creates a it will strengthen the broad sense."
"14200440","14206940"," There's your cup and handle trade down which will in turn we hope help help inflation that that cup"
"14206940","14211900"," and handle trade should give you continuation really sorry later in the week."
"14212100","14217240"," Well I mean you've talked for many press conferences now about the harm created by inflation how"
"14217240","14218040"," hard that is for people. "
"14218040","14221120"," So how much of that are we still seeing with inflation now down at three."
"14221380","14222760"," So I guess I would put it this way."
"14222920","14223640"," We we. "
"14223800","14224680"," Oh it's your own confident."
"14224680","14225560"," Look at him."
"14226020","14227280"," I know it's confident. "
"14227280","14229800"," Any really a question of how do you balance the two risks."
"14230000","14231460"," That's a bit walk right there."
"14231600","14234700"," And you know we I would say that you guys see the confidence. "
"14234940","14238440"," We're coming to a place where where there really are risks on both sides."
"14238480","14241240"," It's hard to say exactly whether whether they're in balance or not."
"14241380","14245940"," But it's like I got a white student home and a bunch of coke and hunters that can't wait to"

"14253680","14258380"," You know as you know we think in most economists think that core inflation is actually a better"

"14262600","14264600"," You're going to expect that to play out."
"14264600","14265900"," I vodel. "
"14266040","14267300"," Huge move to the upside."
"14268140","14268520"," We would want."

"14270380","14275060"," That's what we think that's corn is signaling where headlines going to go in the future."
"14275820","14277760"," And core inflation is still pretty elevated."
"14278060","14281880"," You know there's reason to think it can come down now but it's it's still quite elevated. "
"14282400","14284120"," And so we think we need to stay on task."
"14285060","14287460"," And we think we're going to need to hold certainly hold."
"14287500","14290920"," Watching a repricing right now in the office chain once again. "
"14291020","14293960"," And we need to be prepared to raise further if that if we think that's appropriate."
"14294780","14300220"," Well and then if inflation were to just a quick follow if it stays at three or drops even a"
"14300220","14300820"," little bit more."
"14301400","14303820"," I mean how much of an increase in unemployment. "
"14303900","14305580"," He's just shit not people."
"14305840","14306200"," Temeros."
"14306200","14309360"," That last bit of inflation people are talking about. "
"14309380","14310960"," Are we still bearish."

"14312740","14314720"," Shut down by Jay Powell. "
"14315000","14316740"," How much do you think."
"14317100","14318460"," To the previous statements."
"14318840","14324480"," So it is the last rate decision got all that all of us with Jay. "
"14325040","14330760"," That's a real blessing and that we've been able to achieve some disinflation."
"14330760","14332700"," The press is upset right now."
"14332700","14333860"," We don't seek to it. "
"14333860","14338000"," It's not that we're aiming to to raise unemployment but I would just say the historical record."
"14338000","14339020"," We have to be honest about."
"14339140","14342100"," Look at Jay Pous just leaning into the lectern right now. "
"14342420","14342880"," When and."
"14343380","14348820"," To bring down inflation the result tends to be some softening in labor market conditions."
"14348840","14349920"," Oh yeah you see these. "
"14351220","14351960"," Outcome here."
"14352880","14354880"," And you know we hope that that's a look at that."
"14354880","14356300"," Look at that. "
"14356300","14356620"," Look at that ego."
"14356840","14357700"," It's on full play."
"14357700","14360760"," It looks like up the war talk or rooster. "
"14361040","14361220"," Of course."
"14361520","14364840"," He's on top of his state or is on top of the stage right now."
"14365020","14365760"," Just look at him. "
"14366240","14369500"," Whatever the short term social cost of getting inflation under control."
"14370220","14370880"," The longer term."
"14371620","14376320"," Failing to do something greater and that the historical record is very very clear on that. "
"14376320","14377100"," I can see like."
"14377100","14378120"," I can see like."
"14378420","14380560"," Flying outside right now. "
"14380660","14381040"," Volatile."
"14381560","14383940"," It interferes with people's lives and with economic activity."
"14384000","14385800"," Big American flag waving outside. "
"14386040","14388620"," We really need to avoid and we'll avoid."
"14393030","14401170"," At this point you say the policy is restrictive but all year long we have seen growth surprise to"
"14401170","14405330"," the upside unemployment to the downside and inflation lately to the downside."
"14405990","14411030"," So I'm wondering by definition should you be restrictive enough right now under these conditions. "
"14411030","14416890"," Do you think you might need to do more because I'm curious about what you see as inflation dynamics"
"14416890","14421930"," now is the economy still moving in a direction where it creates more inflation."
"14422170","14429530"," People talk about base effects and higher energy costs and now we have some large labor settlements"
"14429530","14436170"," or is the economy disinflating and you're just you're able to go back to the old Fed policy of"
"14436170","14437690"," opportunistic disinflation."
"14438570","14445630"," So I'll just say again the broader picture of what we want to see is we want to see easing"
"14445630","14450470"," of supply, consent, strengths and normalization of pandemic related distortions to demand. "
"14450770","14455970"," There we go pandemic related to distortions running at moderate or moderate levels to help ease"
"14455970","14456870"," inflationary pressures."
"14457210","14461410"," You got a day we want to see continued restoration of supply and demand balance particularly in the"
"14461410","14464630"," labor market and all of that should lead to declining inflationary."
"14464630","14469170"," You got a day you got a day we see as we see those pieces of the puzzle coming together"
"14469170","14474250"," and we're seeing evidence those things now but I would say they pause on that same thing right"
"14474250","14479830"," there man that's telling us the policy has not been restrictive restrictive enough for long enough"
"14479830","14486470"," to have it say backing up the bull pieces right now, Jerome Powell backing up the bull pieces is"
"14486470","14491910"," coming down transitory or 2% andemic related further tighten if that is probably have done enough"
"14491910","14495590"," bring us back into a normal business cycle a long way to go. "
"14495950","14502290"," Long-term extremely bullish and that's just that restrictive enough unless something changes."
"14503730","14508730"," There's we think you know today's rate hike was appropriate and I think we're going to be looking"
"14508730","14514250"," at the incoming data to inform our decision at the next meeting about what is the incoming data"
"14514250","14519130"," telling us that we need or we're looking right now rear view mirror that's our view then we will do"
"14519130","14519330"," more."
"14520770","14529890"," Thank you Colby Smith at the Financial Times if September is in fact a live meeting how does that"
"14529890","14535430"," square with the need for a more gradual tightening pace that you spoke of last month and explaining"
"14535430","14540410"," the rationale for holding these fucking reporters are gonna at the time they get to the 10th report"
"14540410","14544290"," they're gonna be like a more gradual we just want to know if you're gonna do it right in September"
"14544290","14549490"," tell us because we need some bearish shit to say right it could be it just means if you you're"
"14549490","14555630"," slowing down the point what really was to slow down the decision cycle as we as we get closer and"
"14555630","14562390"," closer to we think our destination and I wouldn't want to go automatically to every other meeting"
"14562390","14567550"," because I just don't think that's we don't I think it's not an environment where we want to provide"
"14567550","14571450"," a lot of forward guidance it's there's a lot of uncertainty out there we just want to keep moving"
"14571450","14575650"," at what we think is the right pace and I do think it makes all the sense in the world"
"14575650","14582850"," to slow down as we now make these finally slow down each other said a decision market or so that's"
"14582850","14587970"," a rate rate hike to slow down possible I mentioned before it's possible that we would move it"
"14587970","14591730"," consecutively means we're not taking that off the table or we might not it's really gonna depend on"
"14591730","14596710"," what the data tell us that's the best we can do so we shouldn't assume that every other meeting is"
"14596710","14601370"," the lowest tightening frequency so we're gonna interject here really quick I want to say something"
"14601370","14605530"," to you guys here I don't know if you read between lines here we're gonna make a decision about the"
"14605530","14611550"," next meeting so we've set this before we set it before today three days in a row we've non-stop"
"14611550","14618010"," you're getting a forward-looking Jerome Powell you're getting a Jerome Powell saying that this is"
"14618010","14625290"," all due to a secondary business cycle that what the work that we've done has been to rein in that"
"14625290","14633190"," secondary business cycle the market has reprised itself he's also being very savvy right now and"
"14633190","14642850"," saying sorry there's we're not going to commit to set cycle of rate hikes but they are"
"14642850","14649470"," open on the table we need to see the effects down the road now what that does is say two"
"14649470","14656810"," things one job well done two no we're not gonna roll this fucking market over on the on the"
"14656810","14664130"," expectation of QE or rate cuts and it's not clear that it has it's saying party on and what we"
"14664130","14668090"," know and then what we don't know we know that if I say you know that's what it said you"
"14668090","14672530"," have an inflation with a lag that can be long and variable or lags plural that can be long and"
"14672530","14677570"," variable a lot of uncertainty around the length of the lags and by the way that's just one"
"14677570","14682790"," component look out of me smiling over there he's got confidence so I'll tell you how I how I think"
"14682790","14687330"," about this first the first thing to say is we're determined to bring inflation down to two percent"
"14687330","14693410"," over time and we will use these committed that no one should doubt that we don't work well we don't"
"14693410","14698610"," we don't go that through is now in a meaning to the territory that's like your dad telling you I"

"14707610","14712770"," beat us I would say monitor just let him say what he wants to say so after today's decision meaning"
"14712770","14719550"," that it is putting downward pressure activity and inflation we'll keep monetary policy restricted"
"14719550","14728470"," until we do so so that's how I think about it we that smile we come a long way we"
"14728470","14733210"," are resolutely committed to returning inflation to our two percent old fucking rain on my parade"
"14733210","14738970"," inflation has proboscopy stupid questions you guys remember forecast did people to that beat me to"
"14738970","14743010"," like oh see you're a bull now and at some point it's a robot like freak out be like we"

"14754330","14759930"," in the in the latest lose to the fact that a board to be patient at this point he also"
"14759930","14767690"," said he is open to slowing the growth rates edging down slowly below heading below zero the pace of"
"14767690","14774910"," rate increases indicator that's new that the sluice will come out early next week and I would just"

"14805850","14810570"," Powell Rachel Seagull from the Washington Post thanks for taking our questions could you break down"
"14810570","14816010"," the reasons why inflation is fallen and what share of that credit you would give to factors that"
"14816010","14820390"," don't stem directly from rate hikes or that might be within your control at all like easing supply"
"14820390","14826050"," chains and a drop in energy prices over the past year yeah Rachel has a quivering voice I think"
"14826050","14831530"," she's afraid she can't buy her first house interesting question so let me start by saying that the"
"14831530","14838710"," inflation surge that has resulted from a collision of elevated demand and and constrained supply"
"14838710","14844390"," both of which followed from the unprecedented features of the hell yeah Paul is going monetary"

"14856490","14861770"," posting right now which would help return the balance between supply and demand by reset and we"
"14861770","14867250"," think broadly what we're what we're seeing so to go break it down a little further of course"
"14867250","14872110"," headline inflation has come down sharply from elevated levels as energy and food prices have come"
"14872110","14877190"," down mostly due to reversal you guys don't want to give you guys don't want to give good thing in"
"14877190","14882110"," the public experiences that you guys are you guys are savages like flation I'd say I'll just went"

"15154850","15163210"," I would be a buyer of this for a Friday move to the upside for that cup and handle I"
"15163210","15175150"," also like the hourly trigger so let me draw some boxes for you hold on here there's"
"15175150","15184310"," a five minute chart you got one right here green baby you got the hourly trigger right here"

"15198470","15204830"," right now you need a closing red bar for this to be dead so if you get a no closing"
"15204830","15211610"," red bar we're gonna continue higher so no closing red bar right here we will actually blast through"
"15211610","15219070"," all this and we will see our two today so let's take a look at this are we watching the"

"15251830","15261730"," continuation to 458 21 it has been my view consistently that we do have a"
"15261730","15267850"," shot in my base case is that we will be able to achieve inflation moving back down to our target"
"15267850","15273250"," without the kind of really significant downturn that results in high levels of job losses that"
"15273250","15278590"," we've seen in some past in some past instances many past instances of tightening that look like"
"15278590","15285790"," ours that's been my view that that is that's that's still my view and I think you know that that's"
"15285790","15291450"," sort of consistent with with with what I see today so but it's it's a long way from assured and"
"15291450","15296970"," and you know we we have a lot left to go to see that happen so the staff now has"
"15296970","15302490"," a noticeable slowdown in growth starting later this year in the forecast but given the resilience"
"15302490","15308770"," of the economy recently they are no longer forecasting a recession it's I just want to note that"
"15308770","15314590"," it's that our staff produces its own forecast which is independent of the forecast that we as FOMC"
"15314590","15320330"," participants produce having an independent staff forecast as well as the individual participant"
"15320330","15326470"," forecast is a really a strength of our of our process there's just a lot of I think constructive"

"15352790","15359270"," good way to think about it we've we've seen so far the beginnings of disinflation without any real"
"15359270","15364170"," costs in the labor market and that's it that's a really good thing so one minute chart right here I"
"15364170","15368730"," would just also say the historical records suggest that there's very likely to be some softening at"
"15368730","15373410"," labor market conditions and consistent with having a soft landing you would you would have some"
"15373410","15379410"," softening in labor market conditions and that's still likely as we as we go forward with this"
"15379410","15383510"," process but it's a good thing to date that we haven't we haven't really seen that we've seen"
"15383510","15387530"," softening through other not through unemployment not through higher unemployment we've seen"
"15387530","15394710"," softening through you know job openings coming down part of the way back to more normal levels that"

"15408750","15413390"," yet I've heard a whisper about it we're seeing that kind of cooling and that's that's very healthy"
"15413390","15423250"," and you know we hope it continues thank you Mr. Chairman Jeff Cox from CNBC.com you"
"15423250","15429690"," another Fed officials in the past have suggested that you don't need to keep hiking until inflation"
"15429690","15437030"," hits 2% that as long as you see continued progress I'm wondering how close do you need to get"
"15437030","15443210"," with the inflation numbers coming down how many months of data do you need to see that will that"
"15443210","15448850"," will give you sufficient confidence and you know how how how far does this fight need to go before"
"15448850","15456470"," you're willing to kind of declare victory on it so the idea that we would keep I think hiking until"
"15456470","15461870"," inflation let's try to answer a project of going way past the target that that's clearly not the"
"15461870","15468750"," appropriate way to think about it so in effect if you look at our forecasts we we the median"
"15468750","15473250"," participant and again these are these are forecasting out years so take a look at that of course"
"15473250","15479570"," 60s for Friday are cutting rates next year because because you know the federal funds rate is at a"
"15479570","15486270"," restrictive level now so if we see inflation coming down credibly sustainably then we don't need to"
"15486270","15492170"," be at a restrictive level anymore we can you know we can move back to to a neutral level and"
"15492170","15497070"," then below a neutral level at a certain point I think we would you know we would we of course"
"15497070","15501610"," would be very careful about that we'd really want to be sure that inflation is coming down in a"
"15501610","15507110"," sustainable level and it's hard to make I'm not going to try to make a numerical assessment of when"
"15507110","15513130"," and where that would be but that's the way I would think about it is you'd start you'd stop raising"
"15513130","15518930"," long before you you got to 2% inflation and you'd start cutting before you got to 2% inflation"
"15518930","15526810"," I grabbed some four sixties for 34 cents for Friday there they were 13 so 25 or so so"

"15599430","15606910"," actual effect on if you think of a particular set of banks that were that were affected because of"
"15606910","15611450"," their size and business model and things like that they were more affected by the turmoil in March"
"15611450","15617470"," than others it's it's very hard as I mentioned it's very hard to sort of tease out the effects on"

"15646190","15650930"," that's going to restrain economic activity is a restraining economic activity so that's how I would"
"15650930","15656330"," look at it and how is that informing your outlook for setting policy so I think we that that goes"
"15656330","15662210"," that is an expected result of tightening interest rate policy is that is that bank credit"
"15662210","15667470"," conditions would bank lending conditions would tighten as well and so the question is is it is it"
"15667470","15672210"," more effective this time because of what happened in May I just don't think we know that I think we"
"15672210","15676790"," think we're looking at the current data in GDP and we're seeing strong spending we're seeing a"
"15676790","15682410"," strong economy and it's made us confident that we can go ahead and raise interest rates now for the"

"15705570","15710950"," you were at all concerned about any inflationary impact of wages now outpacing inflation which is"
"15710950","15715030"," likely contributing to the boost in consumer sentiment and the continued strength of the consumer"
"15715030","15721910"," that we've been seeing well wages in excess of inflation means real wages are positive again that's"

"15731610","15737810"," wages have been coming down gradually and that's what we want to see we expect to see more of that"
"15737810","15743130"," that's just more of what's consistent over a longer period of time we don't really think that that"

"15800470","15805210"," very families especially families at the lower end of the income spectrum is to get inflation"
"15805210","15810190"," sustainably under control and restore price stability we think that is the most important thing we"
"15810190","15815910"," can do now and we're determined to do that and I would just point out that the people who are"
"15815910","15821690"," the most hurt by inflation right away are people who are on a low fixed income who you know when"
"15821690","15828610"," you're talking about travel you know transportation costs heating costs clothing food things like"
"15828610","15833630"," that those if you if you're just making it through each month on your paycheck and prices go up"

"15904790","15910570"," minutes right now many times when we go into a meeting the decision is not you know fundamentally"
"15910570","15916090"," in doubt nonetheless we have the meeting and we're discussing this earlier how what the minutes"
"15916090","15925910"," actually mean some meetings are you know less uncertain than others and and I just leave it at you"

"15971170","15975810"," have to do more but what what tends to happen though is financial conditions get in and out of"
"15975810","15981190"," alignment with what we're doing and then ultimately over time we get where we need to go if I could"
