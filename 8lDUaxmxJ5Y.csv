"784870","790050"," am on that trade for the quarter Now that trade that I went into this morning."
"790830","799190"," I do have some concerns with it Do you have some concerns with this trade and we have to talk"
"799190","808690"," about them The biggest thing or the biggest thing that I see that's like the danger to this trade"
"808690","818670"," is Some of the data that we have releasing next week and And the fed rate decision to some extent"
"820090","821750"," Nothing material from him. "
"821750","830770"," I did have a long conversation last night with a friend about That rate decision We should talk"
"830770","840590"," about that today Because there seems to be some maybe more information from the GDP numbers"
"840590","850570"," that were released this past this week and What Jerome had said in the last last rate meeting?"
"851410","856050"," So we'll talk about that this morning as well So the risk to this trade right now that I can"
"856050","865570"," see There's is twofold So The first major risk to this trade"
"866790","878180"," This is a spooze The first major risk to this trade is going to be Well,"
"878360","887800"," this cross right here and it's pretty it's fairly dangerous Number one into next week Get"
"887800","897360"," rid of that Into next week, I'm going to at least expect For this rate"
"897360","906580"," decision that we could at minimum get pinned in here So I'm on this on this this holiday trade,"
"906820","907000"," right?"
"907920","915540"," And there's likely going to be some kind of a painting action and You know that doom and gloom So"
"915540","922260"," even if I think this is Wednesday here I could be I've got my dates wrong in here, but this"
"922260","928460"," is still the general gist Would be that we could squeeze up into that Tuesday or Wednesday of next"
"928460","931260"," week But then have you know that bullshit down here we go down."
"931480","938020"," That's the actual buy for the holiday trade now I'm not as concerned with it being down here."
"938020","945400"," It's a good place for me to buy it Even if we do have that pull down from From the"
"945400","950480"," panic from the Fed rate decision, but if you were like hey, I want to wait for that that makes"
"950480","959920"," sense to me on a secondary On a secondary point though here I don't like this"
"959920","970500"," holiday trade Below anyways, so I'm like well if we do squeeze that before we get to Wednesday I'll"
"970500","975780"," just take the trade off the table in here and capture all this stuff and then if we get the"
"975780","978540"," more blood Into the rate decision. "
"978840","985820"," I'll place a third MBI trade up here So are down here So I'm trying to like I don't know"
"985820","986720"," I'm trying to get greedy here."
"986880","990280"," So Anyways, I am on this trade."
"990420","991680"," It's four forty four twenty. "
"991960","1000860"," I do want you to realize that I Will take this trade off before we get to This daily trigger"
"1000860","1006660"," next week if we do get to it next week if this if we end up going up here And"
"1006660","1014840"," we do a price that ends up going up before When's they have next week I will take the money"
"1014840","1022220"," and run off that trade and then set on my hands for the rate decision for the Third it would"
"1022220","1027300"," be a third quarterly trade on MBI and there's some concerns We're gonna look at what those concerns"
"1027300","1028500"," are the dangers here."
"1028680","1035520"," Why is it dangerous to put this trade on a Price will matter when when you take it off Now"
"1035520","1039440"," a lot the last one for this quarter I took off to it was cranking so I was making pretty"
"1039440","1042060"," good money on it I got a good premium kick on it."

"1074120","1077940"," So don't get too crazy Don't be like saying."
"1078020","1078840"," Oh my god. "
"1078880","1085520"," We're gonna crash and all those stuff You still need to confirm This cross to the downside."
"1086340","1092040"," It's not gonna be something where it blasts down to the depths of hell You have your 1987 crash You"
"1092040","1099400"," are going to have to confront that cross and it's meaning Confirm that that's the direction that"
"1099400","1106160"," we're headed And if that's the case, we'll know it if we get that cross or not the cross But"
"1106160","1112340"," if we get the confirmation, I'm gonna end up turning very bearish on that move to the downside this"
"1112340","1119980"," would be a Seal the deal for the bulls for the year if there if there is any kind of"
"1119980","1126160"," rejection up here So this this could be my last Technically, this could be my last bull trade of"
"1126160","1136160"," the year If that ends up being the case if we end up rejecting this cross above So that is"
"1136160","1144020"," where the risk is the risk to you is roughly here Right, there is if you're a bear Trying to"
"1144020","1146100"," short the markets and you're like fuck that cap."
"1146420","1151800"," I'm super bearish and we're gonna crash this market down This is the place that this yell this"
"1151800","1157480"," yellow daily trigger is the major place for you to take shorts You can actually see this one up"
"1157480","1157680"," here. "
"1157820","1161340"," You can see this one up here You can actually see the bear plane that was formed the alert that"
"1161340","1169820"," was given Way up here You can actually see it right there That's written right in bear plane and"
"1169820","1176040"," you'll see the next bear plane once it once it creates itself to give a trigger For a reversal to"
"1176040","1183860"," the downside if that is what is going to happen So we'll look for it if we see that reversal"
"1183860","1185400"," we see that bear plane or whatever."
"1185420","1191900"," We'll look for it and see if it happens again but otherwise long here long with holiday trade in"
"1191900","1201100"," mind and I am fascinated to see what does happen next week on the economic calendar For next week"
"1201100","1201680"," we talked about it."
"1201800","1202000"," Yes, sir. "
"1202140","1202800"," We're gonna talk about it again."
"1202960","1210960"," This one's the you're all aware of it into next week We've got nothing scheduled for Monday We have"
"1210960","1212240"," at 8 30 a.m. On Tuesday."
"1212540","1218640"," We have on 8 30 a.m. We have employment cost index 9 o'clock case Shiller Chicago Business Prom"
"1218640","1223220"," and our consumer confidence none of those are gonna matter none of those reports are going to"
"1223220","1232560"," actually matter You should see today tomorrow Should be today Monday or at least a Monday session"
"1232560","1239260"," Tuesday session Should not be focused on any of any of the news that you see coming out the key"
"1240760","1250000"," Dates will be ADP on Wednesday You're using SP 500 US manufacturing PMI Job openings gonna be key"
"1250000","1258960"," ADP unemployment and job openings should be the two glaring to me Or our economic news"
"1258960","1263660"," next week until we get the Fed rate decision. "
"1263920","1271120"," That's on Wednesday same day That too in 230 p.m. And the reason why I'm saying that those are"
"1271120","1276020"," the two most important might be asking Hey, why is ISM manufacturing not important?"
"1276080","1284540"," Why is PM manufacturing PMI not important and the reason being is the rest of the sauce And the Fed"
"1284540","1289400"," knows this you hear the Fed talk about this right you'll hear the Fed talk about which spiral Which"
"1289400","1290740"," by weight growth spiral?"
"1290740","1297760"," You'll hear the Fed talk about robust jobs, right They'll talk about GDP and GDP is gonna be"
"1297760","1302220"," wrapped into that PMI that meant manufacturing PMI and all that kind of stuff But really the secret"
"1302220","1304320"," sauce here is unemployment in jobs."
"1304680","1309660"," There's a Goldilocks zone In unemployment and jobs right now."
"1309660","1316000"," That's gonna be the key driver That we're gonna be looking at as well as these previous these"
"1316000","1319920"," products just these GDP numbers We just got and the answer to that. "
"1320020","1327080"," We have to talk about that today as well for Jerome next week Because the GDP numbers even if"
"1327080","1335140"," they're revised are telling a completely different story Then everything that we're seeing I mean"
"1335140","1341140"," that story is absolutely different so anyways, and we're gonna talk about that today So we've got"
"1341140","1347580"," again Wednesday Fed Chair Powell 2 30 PM 2 PM and 2 30 PM And then we've got some more"
"1347580","1350080"," numbers coming out that are important as well."
"1350280","1356100"," We've got Thursday you initial jobless claims That's another important one Then Friday non-US non "
"1356100","1361880","-farm payrolls US unemployment rate are gonna be some very important ones as well So in that that"
"1361880","1369700"," volatility lasts into Wednesday starts Wednesday then Thursday then Friday are all very important"
"1369700","1379440"," numbers next week that you need to be looking at and For what the Fed Chair Powell says so"
"1380780","1386220"," And let's talk about that because I had covered well first of all or we talked about how tired"
"1386220","1396400"," everything is Into This this Fed Jerome Powell meeting You"
"1396400","1400880"," know here are things like light recession double dip."
"1401140","1402120"," I heard something yesterday. "
"1402360","1406680"," I was talking for a friend He said what about double dipping And I said well we'd be triple"
"1406680","1407000"," dipping."
"1407580","1408560"," He said what do you mean?"
"1409720","1418660"," And I said well I said we have our first dip in 2022 so you're looking for your second dip"
"1418660","1422740"," and He said to me What do you mean by that?"
"1422840","1426160"," I said well and I said let's talk about GDP."
"1427220","1428920"," I was a what's how about timing?"
"1433440","1443400"," The macroeconomic landscape against the market and The timing of the marketplace so if we've got"
"1443400","1449120"," like that double dipper where you get the first role in the second role Are you do you expect that"
"1449120","1451880"," third role third role is much less common?"
"1453300","1462320"," And so where we are in price on the stock market Mine until that GDP number came out and then"
"1462320","1470100"," listening to Jerome Powell my initial thought was well They're gonna try to front-run a bottom to"
"1470100","1476780"," the market into 2024 And it seems like it's early this year right they're doing it earlier then"
"1476780","1486720"," even spring or fall of 2024 and This conversation we're having I was like I'm looking at these"
"1486720","1491720"," GDP numbers and you can they can fudge them They can say do whatever they want. "
"1491720","1497640"," I'm looking at inflation and I'm looking at employment's unemployment's and we're just discussing"
"1497640","1507340"," this conversation about Is he actually done raising rates now the idea here is that he only has one"
"1508080","1518520"," Maybe at most two left and then hold them into December of 2024 Inflation"
"1518520","1524040"," looks like it can be fudged into the the the two percent that he's looking for and unemployment"
"1524040","1532060"," looks like it can go to five to six percent In December of 2024, but that GDP number Disagrees with"
"1532060","1539080"," all of that right That GDP number seems to say that everything's great out there not great, but"
"1539080","1548780"," what it's actually saying is that producers and Producers aren't bringing the pricing"
"1548780","1555700"," down retailers aren't bringing their pricing down And you're actually getting paid more It's saying"
"1555700","1556360"," that too."
"1556460","1562040"," It's saying that you're working more or have a second or third job or you're getting paid more"
"1562780","1567640"," Because GDP is telling you that these people have raised their prices and that they're raking it"
"1567640","1571560"," hand over fist Now, I don't know how you're getting that money."
"1571760","1576160"," Where you got that money or whatever There's something else here, too that we were discussing in"
"1576160","1588570"," this conversation yesterday But that ties into this and that is That"
"1588570","1598390"," is what we are what we're fed From news reporting people always want"
"1598390","1607110"," to Define a narrative For whatever reason there's always a narrative right but that narrative is"
"1607110","1613530"," oftentimes not accurate If any of you've had any experience with the news on the inside, you know"
"1613530","1619410"," that a lot of it is truly fake That's been my experience my experience in the military and then my"
"1619410","1627310"," experience as a business owner as well, believe it or not, so It really is it's not art's not or"
"1627310","1630790"," it's inaccurate If any of you ever been the subject of a news story, you're like wow, they got all"
"1630790","1638790"," that shit wrong or it's kind of right, but not really exactly What's real so my take on that is"
"1639990","1645530"," Something that we've discussed in the show before which is You know, Mary the landscape where we"
"1645530","1656090"," talk about her, right and that there's a material fundamental change in in the US and We"
"1656090","1664410"," were told that people during covid Burt's got a bunch of free money and they pissed it all away and"
"1664410","1668670"," we had examples of that right you've got someone that gets arrested for fraud You get somebody that"
"1668670","1670030"," gets arrested driving around. "
"1670110","1676030"," I don't know Lamborghini or something that shouldn't have one Any of that kind of stuff they're"
"1676030","1681210"," trying to get money for fake people or stuff like that Like they kind of like dead people with dead"
"1681210","1687290"," social security numbers But there's never a conversation about the person that was giving that"
"1687290","1695370"," money and what they did with that money responsibly No one wants that story No one wants the story"
"1695370","1702730"," of an old person Who has a medical emergency and they go bankrupt, right?"
"1704470","1710350"," That's not like the high up no one cares about like so like Joe Blow works 20 30 years at"
"1710350","1717590"," his company did everything he was supposed to do and then you know Gamefully employed went to"
"1717590","1724750"," college 2.5 kids you name it and then they have a massive medical debt and they just disappear,"
"1725030","1725130"," right?"
"1725770","1732150"," no one cares because they're older and They're not knowing people cares about people care about a"
"1732150","1736270"," 30 year old or 25 year old is doing right What's the hottest newest coolest thing?"
"1737250","1743490"," And the same thing I think applies to some extent with these GDP numbers From COVID that we're"
"1743490","1752810"," still not over here There's some resilience in the economy And I don't know how you beat that"
"1752810","1757210"," resilience I don't know how you beat that resilience."
"1757370","1759150"," How do you beat that out of the economy?"
"1760810","1766150"," and I was talking to this friend last night and I said, you know, I remember when COVID happened"
"1766150","1771470"," and there was money being given out I had a lot of employee I think I'd 30 30 employees that"
"1771470","1776470"," had worked for me prior to COVID and in one shape or another these guys were all unemployed and"
"1776470","1782970"," wanted Or needed weren't them couldn't get jobs couldn't work during COVID and to apply for Some"
"1782970","1788030"," form of PPP or whatever that shit was unemployment all kinds of other stuff I remember having"
"1788030","1793610"," conversations with a lot of these guys And I was like, this is the only time you should ever expect"
"1793610","1798550"," in your life to get a government handout What are you gonna do with it?"
"1798610","1799710"," Are you gonna piss it away or not?"
"1799930","1805410"," I remember having these conversations with these guys and Most of them said they wouldn't most of"
"1805410","1810050"," them said that they were going to try to change their lives for the better Or do something"
"1810050","1816110"," important like I don't know start a construction company or I don't know buy a plow truck Whatever"
"1816110","1816550"," it was."
"1816630","1825170"," Each one of these guys was gonna do the fascinating part of that is It this looks like GDP look"
"1825170","1831390"," with with the rate increases we've had the GDP looks like Some people may have better their lives. "
"1831850","1838210"," You might not have your Your experience might be different, but We have we don't have destruction"
"1838210","1847810"," going on out there, right and You've got the the Fed chair saying higher for longer one maybe one"
"1847810","1857250"," more rate hike GDP disagrees with that And the resilience of our economy is disagreeing with that"
"1858050","1864930"," In general It's like recession what recession if you go out anywhere right now places are packed"
"1864930","1872270"," people are doing things There isn't mass unemployment People are working they're struggling to pay"
"1872270","1872610"," their bills."
"1872870","1877330"," They don't like paying their bills, but they're out there spending the money GDP says that they are"
"1878250","1884950"," So the question then becomes Jerome only has a few choices, right?"
"1885750","1891350"," And let's talk it goes back around to that timing of the market you get that first roll down Then"
"1891350","1898810"," you get the second roll down How do you get that second roll down if our economy is that resilient"
"1898810","1899710"," right now?"
"1900650","1906910"," And if that is the actual second roll right that that quote-unquote crash that we're going to have"
"1908690","1909930"," Hold on a second here."
"1909970","1911130"," I get some problems going on here. "
"1911290","1911850"," Give me a quick second."
"1912230","1918030"," I don't know what's going on Give me one quick stand here."
"1918310","1919130"," I didn't notice that. "
"1919350","1929860"," So the one quick the important part of this conversation is that The"
"1929860","1933500"," important part of this conversation is that you've got a resilient economy right now."
"1933540","1939200"," It's resilient You get a Fed saying we're gonna do higher for longer until at least December 2024"
"1939200","1947360"," and Maybe one more rate hike and then pause and wait and see But our economy doesn't look like it"
"1947360","1952560"," needs that does it we're my friend and I last time we're talking and I was like I was like"
"1952560","1961560"," man we could be we could be needing like 10 basis points 15 basis points And"
"1961560","1970860"," he asked why so high and I said if people are this resilient, are you gonna We're gonna hold where"
"1970860","1978980"," we are for three years four years five years We just bounce out of this this like no recession at"
"1978980","1986400"," all And And Inflation is it ever going to come back down?"
"1987240","1996720"," so He likely is not done hiking even one or two more times That's a base case with these GDP"
"1996720","2006120"," numbers So he may have been in his last rate meeting That"
"2006120","2014280"," conversation might have been to introduce ramping of rate increases Further down the road That's a"
"2014280","2014620"," problem."
"2014940","2017860"," It's not a problem for the for the market, but it is a problem, right?"
"2018580","2028860"," higher higher rates not just one or two, but possibly even more rate increases down the road To"
"2028860","2034920"," try to try to try to beat this economy down That's option number one option number two for him and"
"2034920","2043940"," for the Fed is to declare a victory And Fudge the numbers believe it or not an inflation and say"
"2043940","2050820"," hey, we accomplished our our goal of beating inflation And yet inflation just rages in the"
"2050820","2059840"," background Number choice number three would be mass bailouts and crash the crash the economy crash"
"2059840","2068360"," The debt cycle crash the the equities market and all that kind of stuff But that triple dipper is"
"2068360","2075120"," the one that's bothering me Well, this is the cycle of the the economic cycle and the stock market"
"2075120","2082699"," when you're looking at this from the GDP side of things It doesn't make sense for the stock market"
"2082699","2090699"," to crash right now if he has more work to do And more than he's even saying That we go"
"2090699","2097180"," higher for longer than even 2024 and higher than longer than even one or two more rate hikes That"
"2097180","2101880"," would mean that we're not going to crash that it's going to take another year two three four years"
"2102540","2107860"," To possibly make that happen to get that second rule Now some of you out there might be thinking"
"2107860","2113620"," well, there's this other option where we have that crash right now Then we go even further down"
"2114280","2122440"," Later on the idea here would be what if these banks are trying to front run the Fed sometime next"
"2122440","2130620"," year, which analysts are all agreements on that that's what they're trying to do So let's say you"
"2130620","2133460"," take the stock market down from now into springtime, right?"
"2133940","2143600"," They take it down to three thousand From now into next year And we're still not done raising rates. "
"2143600","2151280"," We're still not done destroying the economy That's makes me scratch my head that doesn't make sense"
"2151280","2157360"," to me that the Sock my we're gonna three thousand and then you'd still be dealing with a"
"2157360","2164060"," destruction of the economy down at three thousand I don't see like sixteen hundred or twenty four"
"2164060","2170840"," hundred for our stock market Personally so not personally I just technically don't see it either"
"2170840","2175240"," unless there's some fraud of some kind some major Fraud that we don't know about well, there is"
"2175240","2183580"," fraud, but that's the fucking Fed so I'm fascinated to see what this rate decision meeting is going"
"2183580","2191780"," to be That last rate decision mean that he had was to me bizarre But I'm have a second second"
"2191780","2199560"," second thoughts about it that maybe it was to introduce even more rate increases rather than"
"2199560","2208780"," another 25 BPS or 50 BPS this next wave of I don't know higher for longer increases in the 2024"
"2208780","2217200"," so I'm fascinated to see what this what this rate increase decision is going to be this week this"
"2217200","2223300"," upcoming week with Fed Chair Powell And if that's the case that they're going to raise for longer"
"2223300","2232300"," if they're going to actually truly raise through 2024 and likely beyond Is this the second role"
"2232300","2241340"," I'm gonna go with no And I think he has more work to do it was weird we were discussing"
"2241340","2251080"," this last night and We're discussing this last night and we another topic that we said was that you"
"2251080","2259120"," trick Not trick, but you you give people this the false hope that we're gonna cut rates So that"
"2259120","2266200"," they begin to sell their homes and loosen up that real estate market so it can come down and We're"
"2266200","2267580"," not seeing that right now, right?"
"2267820","2269340"," You're just not seeing that in the housing market."
"2269440","2273980"," You're not seeing the destruction that you want to see So I'm I'm fascinated to see what these"
"2273980","2278540"," unemployment numbers are with jobs numbers are this week as well as these upcoming numbers We're"
"2278540","2284960"," gonna get if we continue the March higher unemployment or not I'm gonna think that unemployment's"
"2284960","2290040"," gonna flatten a little bit and Employment's going to flatten a little bit with these GDP numbers"
"2292920","2300660"," Credit bubble now, you know, there's Credit bubble I've heard that like I've heard that argument"
"2300660","2305140"," was brought up in our conversation last night as well As long as people are paying their bills."
"2305260","2308060"," I don't care I don't care if they're working two jobs three jobs. "
"2308340","2312480"," Then there's some wage spiral stuff that they're hiding They're not they don't want to discuss some"
"2312480","2317340"," of this wage spiral stuff people make more money to pay their debt I'm fine with that."
"2317340","2322640"," I mean, it's not good for you and I it's not good We discussed that last night too."
"2322860","2328340"," So if I'm making a hundred dollars I'm let's end poor and I make one hundred dollars a week and"
"2328900","2335820"," I can't pay my bills and then I get a wage increase two hundred and fifty dollars Now I can"
"2335820","2343140"," pay my bills But let's say I was making us poor right I was making a hundred bucks and I"
"2343140","2349560"," just barely paid my bills and so now cost of services and goods goes up to 150 bucks You give"
"2349560","2355100"," me a raise now I'm making a hundred fifty bucks And I can now pay my bills, but I'm still"
"2355100","2359260"," poor right They just need you to pay your bills if you're poor if you can just pay your bills. "
"2359600","2360840"," We can move on, right?"
"2361640","2367100"," It's kind of when Your bills become a hundred fifty dollars and you're not getting paid the hundred"
"2367100","2376820"," fifty bucks where we start to have Internal problems in our economy And we don't wait that's not"
"2376820","2377720"," happening right now."
"2377760","2378940"," It's just not happening."
"2379260","2379820"," You can see it. "
"2379940","2381100"," I can see it everywhere."
"2381360","2391360"," It's not There's there's no panic out there from like Jip Bob on Main Street So the"
"2391360","2401160"," idea here would be The idea here would be his that the idea here be If you really want destruction"
"2401160","2410520"," right now, right under normal circumstances, you get it But we aren't in normal circumstances We've"
"2410520","2416240"," got an entire country of people that were given, you know, not a free ride or anything, but you"
"2416240","2423420"," know some substantial chance to make some changes in their lives and I don't think that's talked"
"2423420","2432200"," about often enough or Put under the microscope enough Because normally we should be we should have"
"2432200","2433700"," we should have some destruction here."
"2433800","2440320"," We don't have it And he talked about this in one of his rate decisions He talked about how he"
"2440320","2446480"," was trying to get the COVID cycle and the business cycle back on track together He mentioned that I"
"2446480","2452760"," think is not this last Rate increase decision, but it's the decision before that he discussed it"
"2452760","2458560"," And then he felt like he had finished the job He said he was like we did it. "
"2458780","2465280"," He's like we we think we've done we need to do to deal with the COVID cycle the COVID business"
"2465280","2473580"," cycle But I don't think that he has those GDP numbers are In the face of that the hang tight"
"2473580","2491180"," one second I think that"
"2491180","2498560"," one second so his his It's just flies in the face of what he's saying, right?"
"2499620","2505260"," When you see those GDP numbers were it where they are it it cast like I can't get it off"
"2505260","2513840"," my mind I can't get it off my mind that we're we haven't had any destruction yet You've got average"
"2513840","2520440"," years of people living in their homes as well First time home buyers."
"2520460","2523120"," I think it's four to seven years second time home buyers."
"2523120","2529760"," I think it's eight to twelve years And then you've got and that pretty much is the cycle for you"
"2529760","2534900"," raising your children And you have some extensions in that so you get out of college you buy your"
"2534900","2535380"," first house. "
"2535720","2542500"," You have a child Within that four to eight years you're selling your first home You get your second"
"2542500","2542800"," home."
"2543000","2547680"," That's your 20 years of roughly about your 20 years I've been trying to downsize as you hit your"
"2547680","2556460"," 50s and 60s and your kids are all going off to do their adult things that children do and We"
"2556460","2563380"," all we also talked about Bob on Main Street Mary the landscape or he last night and how I"
"2563380","2573640"," don't know what's better and formed But the age of the internet is a provided people with More"
"2573640","2583300"," access to information that they deem trustworthy Then in previous generations And this"
"2583300","2589360"," in this time period People know that Like hey, I own a home."
"2589520","2595560"," I should be selling it or I'm Aging out of my home whether it's I want to buy my forever"
"2595560","2600240"," home my McMansion or whatever or my kids are leaving To go to college. "
"2600400","2605820"," I want to downsize from what I thought was my forever home in that McMansion and These people are"
"2605820","2612200"," saying I'm not selling I've got this two three percent Mortgage I'm not going to sell."
"2612380","2620980"," I'm just gonna I'm gonna wait this out, right and They haven't given up the reins yet These not"
"2620980","2627960"," just boomers like true boomers like 70 year olds Mid to late 60 year olds, but even younger people"
"2627960","2637360"," 60 year olds 50 year olds That is not They're not selling are they they're they're like fuck it."
"2637420","2643820"," I'll wait it out and I don't think we had people doing that in 2000 or 2000 in 7 8"
"2645020","2651840"," 2000 2001 and then 2007 7 8 today these people are like I'm moving I'm staying right what I'm doing"
"2652580","2659420"," So I don't know if they're better informed they're better off If they had time with their family to"
"2659420","2664420"," sit at home and love on each other and make these big plans Maybe people were starting businesses"
"2664420","2669940"," at home during COVID or they were going to college again or they're improving their lives in one"
"2669940","2677620"," way or another while they were at home During COVID and the impact of that on our business cycles"
"2677620","2685820"," in the United States So I'm fascinated by it was this long conversation we had last night and it"
"2685820","2691500"," was I think it was a 40 We talked about it was a 50-minute conversation where we discuss the"
"2691500","2699220"," state of the economy and What really needs to happen to get that destruction what would the Fed"
"2699220","2700740"," actually need to do?"
"2702580","2706900"," And is how possible is that I don't think that it's possible be honest with you. "
"2707060","2713100"," I don't think From my perspective, I think corporations realize this you can see it in some of the"
"2713100","2723000"," renegotiations of Wages you can see it in the gouging that's taking place Inflationary concern from"
"2723000","2724040"," an inflationary perspective."
"2724600","2729140"," Hey, we're not gonna drop our prices This is our only chance to only get this chance every 10 to"
"2729140","2737000"," 20 years to raise prices and There's some Background acceptance of inflation is going to go higher"
"2737620","2740280"," So they could do the mission accomplished fake out."
"2740400","2746080"," We just keep moving forward And you end up paying people more money and your your cost of goods and"
"2746080","2754400"," services becomes embedded or ingrained into our Economy now even if that stuff is ingrained in our"
"2754400","2758180"," economy It still doesn't solve the issue of demand destruction. "
"2758220","2766460"," It doesn't solve the issue of cyclically how to weed out All of these poor companies bad companies"
"2766460","2772420"," company that that natural capitalist System where we weed out bad debts."
"2772680","2773440"," We haven't done that yet."

"2969040","2975160"," jump this previous reading, but it's normal to have a jump While inflation is normal to have a"
"2975160","2981280"," couple jumps as inflation is coming down and Do they only need this narrative into the election?"
"2983380","2989660"," Because the base or the base voters for both the Democrats and the Republicans are going to be old"
"2989660","2995280"," people not young people Old people are the voters in this country whether you like that or not."

"3101730","3108010"," So in Steve at the 50 to 65 year old class of people Then you're looking for the 65 year"
"3108010","3113930"," olds and older to begin to have to distribute their wealth and we're not seeing that quite right"
"3113930","3122890"," now and that election matters because that person that's heading into That person that's not that's"
"3122890","3129210"," like 65 and older they vote and so there's going to be a lie told to them that that we're"

"3201690","3208570"," it's not it's the wrong thing to say overpaid, but They've matured in their salaried career and a"
"3208570","3215090"," cheaper worker can be put in their place with less experience They're coming to the end of their"
"3215090","3217270"," work working life that kind of stuff. "
"3217470","3222170"," You're looking for those people to get the pain The kids should be in their teenage years somewhere"
"3222170","3229670"," in there like 10 10 to 20 years old And those people to begin to lose their jobs or not"
"3229670","3239620"," be offered employment and stuff like that Oh, no, this is not wisdom This"
"3239620","3247800"," is from data all of it data driven we go over this data in the stream all the time So"
"3247800","3254760"," so we're I'm interested this at this This upcoming week we've got a rate decision on Wednesday and"
"3254760","3263880"," this prior rate decision that we had he changed his tomb and he changed the narrative from the Hire"
"3263880","3269640"," for longer and data dependent to pay you've got one maybe two more rate increases And we're going"
"3269640","3273280"," to hold until least December 2024 That's up."
"3273540","3276280"," That's a change in in his thesis."
"3276280","3284380"," That's a change and is Is status on rate increases and this these past GDP numbers are pointing"
"3284380","3285640"," towards not only?"
"3286480","3289280"," One more rate increase and higher for the next year. "
"3289460","3300420"," They're pointing towards Multiple rate increases and likely higher than even 2024 Based on GDP And"
"3300420","3308080"," I'm fascinated to see what the employment numbers are this week Absolutely What are you saying"
"3308080","3308280"," here?"
"3308520","3312900"," I'm always concerned that size and difference isn't based in things being being okay But more being"
"3312900","3319840"," blissful and aware of how they things seem to be falling apart I think they do realize map that"
"3319840","3328260"," things are falling apart by wage increases 23 states in the United States have raised the minimum"
"3328260","3337960"," wage this year alone and There are more states planning on raising minimum wage next year We"
"3337960","3343720"," haven't had that in some time and so There's an undercurrent."
"3343940","3349700"," So Matt koala just said I'm always concerned that societies and difference Isn't based on things"
"3349700","3356980"," being okay, but more being blissfully unaware of how Things seem to be falling apart You know"
"3356980","3364280"," things could seem like they're falling apart for you Corporations will attempt to Keep you on life"
"3364280","3367440"," support, but only life support, right?"
"3368020","3373080"," We're not talking about Improving your life or any of that kind of stuff or you like give you a"
"3373080","3378740"," giving you a living wage Just enough so that you can get by and that seems to be happening Seems"
"3378740","3387520"," to be happening out there right now Yeah, stretching walls is saying I think Powell's going to try"
"3387520","3393200"," to clean that up a bit this go around no charts or their visuals this time I'm wondering if he"
"3393200","3396660"," was opening the door to even more rate increases next year."
"3396960","3406540"," I know that sounds crazy, but Our economy is very resilient right now But I think we squeeze out of"
"3406540","3410520"," day I'm in calls here, so I'm in call spreads right now. "
"3410580","3417040"," I bought call spreads this morning below and that's all I'm in right now and no other trade Do I"
"3417040","3418620"," think we squeeze up into the clothes?"
"3419420","3427020"," I I don't know I think we normally we shouldn't You've killed so many positions this week on the"
"3427020","3433620"," long side of the likely pin it And you won't see us rise up until next week into when we"
"3433620","3440540"," should squeeze up into Wednesday into that rate decision and then We've got what Saturday Sunday"
"3440540","3441580"," Monday Tuesday?"
"3443020","3450160"," Wednesday Before that rate decision, but then the dealers aren't gonna want to pay you Not any bad"
"3450160","3454380"," decisions that you made this week and all of the reports this week, so do I think that we'll"
"3454380","3454900"," squeeze today?"
"3455160","3461800"," No, but I think that it's positioning today for a squeeze into next week good question by the way"
"3466200","3475700"," What else we got here We're gonna talk about Earnings calendar for next week anyways, let me know"
"3475700","3482500"," your thoughts on Jerome Powell rate increases I want you to think about I want you to think about"
"3483880","3485360"," Not your situation."
"3486040","3488200"," I don't know what your situation is out there."
"3488600","3497220"," I want you to look at the macro landscape out there and Try to piece together Now the economy is"
"3497220","3504260"," not the stock market in any way shape or form But we can look towards the economy where it's at"
"3504260","3512060"," and where the stock market should be or be headed towards and There's there's something not jiving"
"3512060","3512300"," here. "
"3512560","3520660"," So So that's what my question is it doesn't wrap itself up as neatly as I want it to so"
"3520660","3530040"," prior to that GDP number it was wrapping itself up kind of neatly and That GDP numbers now a thorn"
"3530040","3534420"," in the side of me For that for that wrapping itself up."
"3534440","3535380"," That's my point here."
"3535480","3538020"," Do you guys understand that that prior to that?"
"3538680","3545780"," GDP number Everything seemed like it was on track there and then that GDP number is You know, you"
"3545780","3549820"," know, they fudge it and you know, they know the number before and you know, they know what it's"
"3549820","3557740"," going to mean And so it looks like that GDP numbers saying more work ahead And not just one rate"
"3557740","3567640"," increase saying more rate increases Missing some of stuff"
"3570500","3574060"," Missing some of your comments here Hey, good morning. "
"3574160","3575700"," She came Princess King."
"3575800","3576100"," How are you doing?"
"3581390","3585590"," Yeah, I don't know You know, Binky might be a good person tip."
"3585750","3590650"," So Binky's in the chat right now He might be a good person to ask about this Because Binky's coming"
"3590650","3592850"," into the end of his working career, right?"
"3593010","3601670"," I think you are I'm not positive, but You know, I There's you know that those GDP numbers man, they"
"3601670","3610470"," are You know, if you're an older person You've got to be you've got to be wondering I'm fascinated"
"3610470","3617450"," to ask an older person what their thoughts are on what and what their vote is going to go towards"
"3617450","3622250"," because if you're an older voter you're going to vote towards protecting your retirement and"
"3624830","3630890"," Inflation is the thing that scares old people It doesn't scare me yet. "
"3631050","3636610"," It's gonna scare me when I'm older a better way to explain this would be There's a better way to"
"3636610","3643550"," explain this so So by the way, if you want to trade this market up so you we can Hold"
"3643550","3646970"," on a second here You want to trade zero dates?"
"3648490","3649590"," Let's see what happens here."
"3650070","3654190"," So this is a bear cross right here See this right here, right?"
"3654730","3658350"," Positioning is short You're looking for a rejection to the downside here."
"3658510","3667290"," So if you want to grab some some puts up here And have some stops above it you can So"
"3667290","3677350"," I guess yeah, I guess the idea here would be If"
"3677350","3685790"," you're if you're an older person There are I make it simplify this so If I if I work my"
"3685790","3692250"," whole life and I plan on X amount of dollars Let's say I plan on I say I'm gonna retire"
"3693130","3697450"," And how much do I need to retire and in your brain you say to yourself?"
"3697730","3705650"," Oh, I need a hundred thousand dollars So I retire I'm making a hundred thousand dollars a year And"
"3706190","3711510"," And all this shit that just happened happened and all of a sudden now for that same lifestyle I"
"3711510","3717890"," have to come up with two hundred thousand dollars and I'm retired So if I can't maintain that two"
"3717890","3723330"," hundred thousand dollars in my retirement if I didn't expect that huge increase in inflation and"
"3723330","3732290"," wage spiral That it's gonna cost more money then I'm gonna I'm gonna downgrade my My quality of"
"3732290","3737450"," life at that point right or go back to work or whatever it is I have to do So maintain"
"3737450","3738250"," now. "
"3738350","3743010"," I have to go to 150,000 right or 200,000 to keep up with the Joneses that are 25"
"3743010","3744470"," years old, right?"
"3744770","3752970"," so I'm 65 or something and I Think well, I'll be final I've got two my two percent mortgage over"
"3752970","3758530"," here and I've got I'm making my retirement $100,000 in a liver."
"3758810","3763870"," I live in the community live $100,000 Way plenty all of a sudden it becomes two hundred thousand"
"3763870","3769890"," dollars to live in that community and I'm now competing against 25 year old Worker What am I gonna"
"3769890","3770230"," do there?"
"3770550","3776110"," I'm gonna hit that voting booth In this next election cycle, and I don't care who the person that's"
"3776110","3782610"," running Senate we're state rep governor President doesn't matter all I want to hear is that we're"
"3782610","3788050"," fighting inflation because I don't want to compete with the 25 year old To live in this community"
"3788050","3790190"," for two hundred thousand dollars a year, right?"
"3790550","3793150"," I want to go back to where it was a hundred thousand dollars a year."
"3793210","3795130"," I worked my 30 years I got my retirement. "
"3795230","3799610"," I did what I was supposed to do and I do not want to get priced out of my lifestyle"
"3799610","3807710"," in my old age So that is probably a mechanic that is going on in the background So where they"
"3807710","3813410"," claim to be fighting I guess if they my point here is that if they stick with the one more"
"3813410","3822190"," rate increase only And maybe possibly one more and hold it until December of 2024 or this next"
"3822190","3828590"," election cycle and They get your vote because you're still fighting technically inflation, and then"
"3828590","3831530"," they just let it run away After they get your vote."
"3831950","3837140"," Yeah, how we did our thing That you want some zero dates."

"3857390","3858570"," Yeah, I think some of that's changed too."
"3858650","3861130"," I like that George Collins statement, but I think so much changed."
"3862090","3870270"," I Don't think people realize how poor they actually are today I think you we become more normalized"
"3870270","3875890"," to poverty or at least I see it in quality of goods a lot I see it in clothing clothing"
"3875890","3882170"," is the one that gets me all the time And then last week are two weeks ago the pizza thing"

"3898210","3904990"," really on my mind and How we accept things that are deeper than they ever were before just because"
"3904990","3909510"," it's our only experience Let's see if we can turn this around to the upside. "
"3909730","3918590"," We're gonna look for some calls here Let's see if we can take that trade right there."

"3956820","3962640"," We're still in a downtrend right now, so We're still still in a downtrend so still not want to take"
"3962640","3968100"," that trade If we begin to turn up though, I'll take the trade and we'll see if we can get"
"3968100","3977710"," higher You think that the overall attitude"
"3977710","3983590"," of the mature individual be to vote any establishment politician out Given the opportunity there"
"3983590","3990710"," viewed as the problem of solution, you know, it's um I'm not saying to you that I think that"
"3990710","3992490"," they're doing what they're supposed to do. "
"3992490","3998930"," It's what they're telling the voter That's the problem that's where the fucked up shit comes into"

"4399420","4405540"," one has been Well not day one I thought they were gonna cut rates I was actually wrong. "
"4405880","4409660"," Well when they first started raising rates by October, I think of last year I thought they would"
"4409660","4418580"," start cutting And they prove them wrong, but this role in spring I was expecting or even summer and"
"4418580","4427540"," then cutting rates by spring or summer was my my thesis and Possibly Chasing with Ray cuts into the"
"4427540","4434600"," winter of next year But these GDP numbers man and the and the wage spiral that's happening."
"4434620","4441860"," That's not discussed publicly too often The wages that are going up in saint like wages are going"

"4491520","4492500"," it now. "
"4492600","4498140"," I don't know how you're paying for it I don't know if it's one job two jobs increase wages now."
"4498240","4503920"," I'm looking at those increased wages But right now they're saying you are paying it and that goes"
"4503920","4516570"," fully against All the work that's been done at this point What else we got here Yeah,"
"4516790","4518530"," Brad, I would give you that Brad."
"4518710","4524810"," I like what Brad says that would be my only counterpoint that That we don't get a rate increase if"

"5971620","5979340"," On their report when I expect a positive report for those guys So a low if you have a chance"
"5979340","5987520"," to buy two fifty one at any point with a price target of two sixty two sixty five twenty five"

"6003380","6008960"," It looks like it's in distribution So it's not positive, but in the short term it looks great. "
"6009200","6014460"," So I'm gonna expect a spike on their ere reports But it will be short lived now."
"6014640","6021500"," There are a lot of analysts calling for McDonald's to go to three twelve three ten That's their"
"6021500","6027980"," target price much higher than that two seventy expectation It's possible that they I would expect"

"6075640","6079060"," run And then directionally we'll find out at end of year. "
"6079220","6082380"," I think we get a role Ultimately on McDonald's."

"6157070","6158450"," switch over to the weeble chart. "
"6158690","6167330"," So here's McDonald's and I'm gonna expect some weakness Possibly today now it is above its hourly"
"6167330","6167670"," trigger."
"6167930","6168710"," So that is bullish."
"6168910","6169370"," Believe it or not. "

"6290670","6296650"," Yeah, right around at 217 220 something like that into end of year at some point So McDonald's"
"6297250","6303690"," Bullish into their earnings, but then take the money and run There is this target above that"

"14430330","14439990"," I said the bulls need to Thread the eye of the needle and escape This daily and weekly And begin"
"14439990","14446570"," to make their way higher to escape danger Right and they failed to do that they failed to do it"
"14446570","14452630"," here and they failed to do it here But it you know it's the bizarre part about Some of what"
"14452630","14460410"," was said yesterday is that there's no bulls in here that are um Feeling safe Or feeling like they"
"14460410","14466290"," can buy the market And even in all of this action none of this is bullish unless you begin to"

"14490670","14495530"," I'm going I need to explain it to you in a better way I don't know how to explain this"
"14495530","14503490"," better to you Uh this market as a baseline goes up into the right whether you believe that or not"

"14525870","14531450"," going to crash or correct or whatever um Now I've put out one correction video."
"14531450","14540610"," Well, I put a series out of three or four correction videos Uh, they all started on Uh up here"
"14541350","14550790"," Okay, and this high Back here What you haven't gotten from me is expect a correction Here here"

"14565810","14571210"," bulls did see that that correction coming Do you get the point that I'm trying to make here?"
"14572510","14580150"," so uh The idea here is that The idea here the idea here is that uh we gave you an"
"14580150","14587490"," alert of the correction coming in the marketplace And so often you'll hear people say we're getting"
"14587490","14592430"," a correction where do you guys remember when mike barry made that prediction two days later He just"
"14592430","14598130"," did a victory lap today Are you today or yesterday on that correction call and he called that two"
"14598130","14603850"," days after a matter of fact in that video I said expect guys like mike barry to come out and"
"14603850","14609950"," call for a correction So the idea here the idea i'm trying to point out to you here is that"
"14609950","14615190"," Uh, you hear these I hear these weird things from people saying they're right."
"14615390","14615650"," They're right."

"14628810","14633810"," know You finally get the one that works and you you called it right You can't be right one out"
"14633810","14642230"," of 12 times does that make sense to you all out there Now In this corrective move that we've had"
"14642230","14651850"," here there's more danger here uh than it would seem And so I issued you yesterday A not just a"
"14651850","14658770"," corrective warning, but now a crash warning And the reason why i'm telling you this is if someone"
"14658770","14667150"," said see someone said yesterday see I told you and What you can't do is you can't issue those Uh,"
"14667190","14669330"," we're going to crash or we're going to do this. "
"14669330","14674390"," We're going to do that if you do that 12 times Uh, you're going to fail at it right the"
"14674390","14680590"," one time that you're right Um, you're going to be right you need to see the you need to see"
"14680590","14686870"," the confirmation of what's taking place And then say hey, this is the warning."

"14694030","14700890"," and so what I want to talk to you about here is this cross above And just like this correction"
"14700890","14710350"," back here, right Uh, and why don't you call why didn't you call a correction cap Why didn't you"
"14710350","14718510"," call a correction Here here here here here here is the same reason why you don't call for further"
"14718510","14726270"," downside to come Uh over here in this correction does that make sense you need to see not only the"
"14726270","14736350"," price action Uh, but the indicators tell you to be afraid So this cross back here on spy Uh,"
"14737570","14744850"," where this daily trigger is crossing this are this a weekly trigger is extremely bearish Uh"

"14809010","14819120"," Let me explain this even better here If you didn't have this crossing of the Of"
"14819120","14827420"," the orange and yellow And that's not there right if you only had price crossed down And then it"
"14827420","14834780"," bounced way up and escaped This cross down below right if it just escaped Uh, there still would be"
"14834780","14841940"," no risk of or a major risk to the market No major risk to the market without that that cross"
"14841940","14849100"," there, but with that cross there there is a problem here Uh, there is a there is a major issue"
"14849100","14855880"," inside of the of the market now it can resolve itself to the upside Spy can squeeze back up and"

"14883980","14890680"," that high danger that they're in Should give them anyone that is long if anyone is long this market"
"14890680","14898380"," from up here Or over here or anything like that They will still be likely given ample opportunity"

"14950320","14957420"," exit the market and orderly fashion to the downside Okay, so the so there's a couple points here"
"14957420","14967060"," You've been warned right You have warning here of a market being very dangerous now Uh to be long"
"14967060","14976060"," in And that's from this cross above Saying that There is a very low probability that we blast down"
"14976060","14983880"," here And do not come back up to this cross Or this daily trigger at some point At a minimum"
"14983880","14990300"," you're going to see this market oversell and squeeze back up to this daily trigger It's got a"
"14990300","14992360"," probability of about 80 percent. "

"15042320","15046780"," I'm not going to become a bear I'm like you want to see a bear suit."
"15047140","15054340"," It would be with price action Just like this right here Where you get the rejection off the cross"

"15061620","15066900"," eventuality wherever that wherever this price comes up here to this daily trigger Is where i'm"

"15085280","15090940"," to trade up again We trade up here and we get above and start consolidate and head and hire again"
"15090940","15097660"," No problem, but if we get that bear plane up here again Uh, it's going to be Messy to the"
"15097660","15105260"," downside and you need to be aware of it because you should then get extremely Extremely bearish."

"15186220","15193860"," october run So this all this structure in here You're still being given opportunity to get out, but"
"15193860","15200540"," I'd have to make it very clear to you out there Of the danger Here this danger is not the"

"15253860","15259520"," This is the best a correction at this point It does not fit the bill for a crash."
"15260060","15266280"," It is in no way shape or form that But it can become that Uh, and it'll be violent to"
"15266280","15272560"," the downside like we're talking straight down Of violence in this market if you get this corrective"

"15438800","15445100"," instead of trying to buy this dip and thinking yeah, it's going to recover to the upside Right,"
"15445420","15445920"," it's okay."
"15446180","15451540"," So instead of saying yeah, we're going to buy this dip and we're going to continue up here It's uh,"
"15451880","15456320"," we'll buy this dip But i'm not buying and putting any money in this market."

"15529900","15542950"," Actually, we could do it like this Excuse me Then"
"15542950","15555550"," you would do that break there And This"

"15770000","15774180"," We'll take a look at uh PPO's as well said pmi- did I say pmi?"
"15775600","15784860"," I said pmi I think like five times PMI should Ppo's saying the same thing and you can see this"
"15784860","15791340"," bloodletting down below And there's no reversal showing is there it's that nice reversal right here"
"15792050","15798860"," See this nice reversal right here See this nice reversal to the upside nice reversal right here And"
"15798860","15801940"," even a nice reversal down here nice little relief rally, right?"

"15817480","15825260"," uh on this uh monthly trigger right now and it's showing Uh, yeah, you know Yeah, maybe not we keep"
"15825260","15826160"," going down, right?"
"15827120","15829480"," So this is my danger sign right here. "
"15829860","15836700"," This ppo is saying Uh, no bottom yet cap and not only that Uh due to these new lows over"
"15836700","15836900"," here."

"15848220","15855320"," kind of squeezing that you see is not to be trusted is my point Not to be trusted if you"
"15855320","15861000"," start to see the market begin to squeeze to the upside It's not a function of a turn in the"
"15861000","15862300"," market Right now. "
"15862520","15868440"," It's more of a function of just squeezing for better positioning Or more downside to come over that"
"15868440","15878080"," cross pmo's and uh ppo's so pmo's p ppo's and Uh, the triggers are saying bad news"
"15878080","15886800"," coming This is not the dip to buy or if you if you buy this dip not to expect Not"
"15886800","15893340"," to expect much out of it you can expect that if you want to expect that Uh, but likely more"
"15893340","15899640"," downside to come unless we have some Some resolution to the upside so you can get above that 430 So"
"15899640","15908460"," the expectation here is any squeezing Any squeezing should be followed by rampant selling Uh and"
"15908460","15918400"," more crazy Downside to come uh to at least that octoberlo Excuse me That's 3,800"
"15918400","15921880"," to start with right there Uh, but it doesn't matter."
"15922040","15926260"," It's going to go down to we're going to hit the octoberlo One to pin that 3,500 as well."
"15926360","15930840"," I think it'll matter Because we're going to come back up here and get and sell all this shit We'll"
"15930840","15936100"," end up selling this up here Uh, and then we'll end up selling all that to the downside over there. "
"15936100","15946260"," We'll end up tagging Uh, this one right down Right down here, I believe Yeah,"
"15946340","15954320"," right down there Into uh, February and april so just be very careful here on this stuff here On"
"15954320","15961700"," these continued moves to the downside, okay, whatever squeezing this is Ppo's pmo's telling you"

"16013380","16018420"," we have an example recently Where we did trade underneath it and this is where it gets super scary"
"16018420","16021440"," I want to show you this prior example right here."
