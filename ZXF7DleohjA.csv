"523830","532890"," can look at let's take a look at SPX really quick and There's one positive here There's one"
"532890","539530"," positive here with such light trading It's it's easier to trade that it's pretty easy to trade this"
"539530","549290"," right now This is where Well, let me go to the we will chart so This is this"
"549290","552090"," this 45 50 been talking about this level, right?"
"552310","559250"," We can't pair and tag this nobody's business Came back down bounced on what could be considered"
"559250","559850"," support?"
"560950","567450"," now, there's a little bit of a gap down here that could be closed up and Then still hold that"
"567450","574790"," support to come back up here and keep tagging this 45 75 But this 45 50 down here is now"
"574790","580190"," technically support unless we begin to reject underneath it And that would mean if you look at this"
"580190","580850"," right here, right?"
"581050","586090"," So let's say you see this one right here You'd be looking for the rejection, right?"
"587130","592330"," So it was a good lot good teaching with very simple thing for you to learn get your papers and"
"592330","594910"," pens out at home Whatever it is you have at home."
"595270","596350"," Take this note down. "
"596490","598210"," It's an important thing for you to learn."
"598430","604130"," So if you don't already know it so I always find it hard to Describe this on fin to it"
"604130","611070"," and this is a better medium to describe this, but uh, what you're looking for here is Uh, when we"
"611070","612690"," come into some support."
"612730","613130"," Okay. "
"613330","613990"," We're gonna talk about support."
"614190","614710"," You're seller."
"614990","621170"," Okay not resistance But support so let's say you're selling this over here, right?"
"621870","623930"," You take the money and run down here. "
"624190","628350"," Okay, should we take in the money like here Because we could bounce directly off, right?"
"628830","630530"," So you just take that money off here, right?"
"631430","633150"," Now, let's say you're like, well, fuck you cap."
"633350","639630"," I want to be you know, bloodbath in it down here and stuff like that Uh, the one thing that"
"639630","645410"," I want you to address here is you know, even if you come down here Let's say we swooped down"
"645410","652190"," and took this out Uh, it's not really the trade the trade was right here Right, this is the trade"
"652770","654250"," How do we bounce right here?"
"654410","656330"," They'd start taking your money away from you, right?"
"656550","664730"," So this is the actual trade right here That's the trade now If you want to extend that trade"
"664730","672370"," normally what'll happen is if we're going to continue to go down we'll blast through And uh, can I"
"672370","673530"," just kind of erase this?"
"675330","684750"," Yeah, yeah, there we go We'll blast through right And you'll see the rejection You'll see this"
"684750","685030"," rejection."
"685030","693930"," You're still not putting on a short second short You're actually looking to break below So one two"
"693930","702130"," right and then you break below this previous low Now you just put your finger on sqq over here or"
"702850","709710"," Some esta or I don't know shorting spy or spoons, whatever you set it up right where you'll say"
"709710","713190"," you're selling Uh Not puts or anything. "
"713330","716630"," Let's say you want to enter puts that would work too, but let's say you're wanting to enter for"
"716630","723590"," this next leg Uh, you you wait until you get the double single or double tap and the key point"
"723590","728410"," here is that you break below these two previous lows here And then you can jump right on board and"
"728410","729230"," continue down."
"729550","735290"," Okay, so you have to be like tactful And what you're gonna do another thing to be aware of"
"735290","740650"," specifically where we are right now is is where's that hourly trigger in here Now it's not showing"
"740650","748970"," up right here, but we know where it is Um, so the hourly trigger on spx right now Is um"
"754230","774340"," 4524 so Hold on here, I'm just thinking it's right And"
"774340","780560"," Tight here Right there."
"782580","784660"," So that's like the red line right here. "
"784760","795660"," Okay So I want you to keep keep your eye on this so the idea here is that So"
"795660","796860"," you come back down here, right?"
"797040","801760"," We start to reject and you see that rejection boom right there right you take the short You know,"
"802000","809620"," you've got the gap to close Right and you're then looking for this move down below here And uh,"
"810100","812120"," you're still on trend to the upside."
"812300","818300"," I want to make a key key key point here is that Even if you go down here You're still"
"818300","825140"," on an uptrend If you want to get actually bearish like bearish like we're selling this this move"
"825860","835100"," Uh, you need to then be underneath uh, this one right here So currently Where that sits is that uh"
"837040","848300"," 4524 so if you want to get bearish Right I spoke that wrong Uh, it's"
"848300","854940"," underneath this level right here Okay, so so bowls are still in control Even all the way down here."
"854940","856280"," So be aware of that. "
"856340","863000"," Okay Uh, and keep those keep these keep these numbers Keep these numbers, uh, write these down"
"863000","869480"," whatever you need to do for right now and i'll show you how these things correspond now Saying that"
"870080","872580"," Uh currently we're forming support right here, right?"
"873000","880100"," on this on this gamma node right here right in this 4550 and uh If we start to form that"
"880100","881080"," base down here, right?"
"881300","884400"," This is the inverse of a bearish This is right now."
"884560","887660"," This right here is an inverse right now of this down here, right?"
"888500","895400"," To blast down so we're kind of consolidating to make another move higher And you can't get bullish"
"895400","905060"," for 4600 now, which is right up here right this white box Until you get above This previous high"
"905060","905780"," right here, right?"
"906540","912980"," And then you can take that trade with with a lot of confidence That's that same trade under here A"
"912980","918380"," lot of confidence in here right a lot of confidence up in here Now you can day trade this stuff"
"918380","923820"," you can come down here trade this trade this trade this until you get a break Either underneath or"
"923820","929660"," a break above and take that trade up there But this is consolidation or distribution Going on right"
"929660","929900"," now."
"930020","935720"," So right now this looks like Consolidation for a move higher doesn't look like Consolidation for"
"935720","940740"," distribution at this point just looks like Consolidation for another leg higher or at least another"
"940740","945580"," attempt to fail to get the high Right, this would be just like upside down right with these two"
"945580","951580"," these two right here Right you come up here if you inverse that you come up here And if you"
"951580","956700"," fail to get that new high right here, that's pretty fucking bearish Right and you're going to"
"956700","962260"," actually expect us to sell off that if you fail to get that new high So if you're if you're"
"962260","974240"," a bull Right now what you're looking for as a bull For continuation Hold on a second here Say"
"974240","975940"," they are in agreement and delayed me. "
"975940","976840"," I gotta turn this shit off."
"976880","983500"," So if you're a bull You can you can day trade this stuff here, but you're really looking for a"
"983500","990000"," new high You see that new high from from this previous high right here And then you're going to be"
"990000","995080"," looking to tag this next note above To that uh to that 4,600 up here."
"995240","995380"," Okay. "
"995660","996580"," Now does that happen all today?"
"996840","1007310"," Probably not but We'll talk about it And we'll take a look at what to expect So"
"1007310","1015630"," this is a spy and we'll look at yesterday and today And we talked yesterday about Uh if we're above"
"1015630","1021250"," this node right here, we start getting bullish right And uh, we got up there didn't we and bought"
"1021250","1021970"," some calls yesterday."
"1022310","1031310"," We came up here And I didn't expect us to get above This on the open I expected us to"
"1031310","1036990"," squeeze up here and maybe come back down consolidate then maybe make a move up higher Now, what do"
"1036990","1037230"," we do?"
"1037329","1041650"," We camp here before the bell and we got that that by in the morning and we whoop We went"
"1041650","1048070"," straight up here tagged that r3 And now we're down here consolidating to decide what we're going to"
"1048070","1054550"," do next so as of today This red box by the way is uh that we're just closed tomorrow."
"1054590","1062330"," I also want to uh bring to your attention that we have a half a day on Uh friday, so"
"1062330","1070100"," i'm going to write that in up here We have a half day on friday Uh So if you're not"
"1070100","1074140"," aware of that, I want you to become aware of it If you didn't know that Some of you probably"
"1074140","1078660"," know that we're open on friday, but you might not know that we're it's only a half day So we're"
"1078660","1086400"," gonna write half day over here And do what's the expectation from here This is that gamma node this"
"1086400","1087540"," yellow box over here. "
"1087560","1090540"," Let me get rid of that This yellow box on spy."
"1090980","1091940"," This is that gamma node."
"1092100","1101880"," This is that 4550 And this is that 45 75 up here So what you're going to do here is"
"1101880","1107200"," you're going to buy these dips Which they did right buyers stepped in and bought they bought again"
"1107820","1113200"," Right and every time we're down here you're going to buy these dips to trade And attack this node"
"1113200","1113580"," up here. "
"1113860","1120460"," So this is that ping pong trade sideways move And we begin to get bullish for 4,600 above the"
"1120460","1129220"," uh 45 4600 and spx Um to start trading above this here And what are we looking for up here"
"1129220","1139540"," is uh, that what is it 47 Hold on a second here One quick second We're"
"1139540","1147720"," looking for on this on spy after that r3 Excuse me after the um r3 for stx cell Is going"
"1147720","1155000"," to be the previous eye or or near the previous eye From this past summer and that was that um,"
"1155140","1166690"," what was that at 45 793 So we'll put a target up here Right"
"1166690","1167170"," up here."
"1167310","1168490"," That's that's the target."
"1168810","1169290"," Okay. "
"1169450","1176790"," That's stx up here Uh, so we see they can go back over here It's a one minute chart And"
"1178350","1182950"," And this is where your next node is to the upside right up in here We've got a we've got"
"1182950","1188710"," a large node up here Uh, so you're just buying this dip down here buying the step down here You"
"1188710","1191590"," you already know that there's going to be some resistance in here."
"1191590","1199410"," So I'm going to draw that in for you next I'm going to draw this one right here This one's"
"1199410","1204170"," going to be we're going to make this one yellow down here And uh, hold on a second here."
"1204470","1214310"," Let's get rid of this Right now So This is the"
"1214310","1219710"," top of the market right now until we until we get people buying more calls expanding the call The"
"1219710","1222070"," like loading up on calls, right?"
"1223070","1228910"," This is the top right here And we already know that Uh, there are that there's not a lot of"
"1228910","1230030"," trading going on right?"
"1230310","1239910"," So to expect a new like like Call wall to come out today Friday highly unlikely Now"
"1239910","1244570"," next week week after we can get another call wall Right now there. "
"1244730","1245270"," This is it."
"1245350","1246770"," This is basically it's not yet."
"1246970","1253470"," There's other walls above it, but this is the main one up here Uh, so the expectation Into friday"
"1253470","1261390"," the top should be up here As long as this holds right here, that should be the direction that we"
"1261390","1261690"," go. "
"1261690","1265370"," Okay Uh, now do I think that we're going up there?"
"1266090","1267550"," You know, we came up here already."
"1267630","1268230"," We got up here."
"1268410","1270350"," We got pretty high right here, right?"
"1270930","1276830"," Uh, so i'm not too keen on it I'll enter date day trade this and this has actually moved up"
"1276830","1277270"," a little bit. "
"1277470","1280150"," So this is um Right up here."
"1280330","1286590"," That's that 4500 node So the the idea here would be that you were attacking this up here And if"
"1286590","1290930"," we begin to break underneath this over here, then we're going to start heading down close that gap"
"1290930","1298510"," on spx Go down there, maybe even tag that uh, tag that lower node Uh, and maybe even start to"
"1298510","1303490"," sell this market So if you're a bear and you want to start selling the market you need to get"
"1303490","1308050"," underneath this over here And I that that and this will bring up."
"1308190","1313510"," Uh, this this is also the hourly trigger right now So i'm going to quickly go back over there and"
"1313510","1319850"," show you that our that's spx want to bring up spy for you really quick And show you where that"
"1319850","1324750"," is and you can see it on book map right here, too It's not too too hard to see on"
"1324750","1334450"," book map Yeah, I want to show you where that hourly trigger is"
"1335090","1347930"," It's at 45352 So here we'll actually bring this down a little bit in a second here Right"
"1348630","1349990"," There it's right here. "
"1350130","1359210"," Okay, so you watch this bottom of your screen over here Uh, this is where support is and If we"
"1359210","1366230"," start to break down in here And reject we're going to expect that downside move close that spx gap"
"1366230","1372830"," stuff And maybe even reverse trying to go to the downside here So if you're a bear, that's what"
"1372830","1373470"," you're looking for you."
"1373530","1377170"," You're looking for that break of this green bar Uh right here."
"1377550","1381630"," Now, what are my expectations into friday would be the question, right?"
"1382730","1390370"," and um my expectation in a friday is we're up from here And I talked to you about this yesterday. "
"1390630","1395010"," I said to you expect this move into friday That slams up into that 460."
"1395710","1399470"," I didn't know how long it would take I didn't know if it would take one two three days to"
"1399470","1407250"," get there, but I do expect us uh to trade that 460 into friday close maybe Now there's a caveat"
"1407250","1413450"," to this Um, if we do it now, right if we maybe we already did it's even possibly where he"
"1413450","1415290"," does Let's say this was the top right here."
"1415290","1422530"," Okay for the week It's possible But regardless, uh, what I do want to what's most important about"
"1422530","1430750"," this is Um That let's say we do this move Uh into friday No big deal. "
"1430910","1432410"," That's that's good check mark, right?"
"1433550","1438890"," But if we stay kind of like this Uh, my expectation is that we come in friday."
"1439030","1440190"," We're not going to do anything else."
"1440350","1445950"," It's going to be like it's going to be like flat in here Uh, we'll grind this out and then"
"1445950","1448550"," we'll see a nice fat drop off into next week. "
"1448890","1457210"," So if you're a bear right now Uh, if you're a if you're a bear I have I here this"
"1457210","1457550"," morning."
"1457770","1463250"," I have some close people that I trust Bears that I trust and what what's going on here?"
"1463250","1465210"," What the fuck is going on down here?"
"1465510","1472670"," I don't know what is going on down here Now now traders that I try this is kind of a"
"1472670","1473330"," funny thing too."
"1473330","1483160"," So uh traders that I trust are already short right now"
"1483160","1493040"," and You know if if If If You can be short here"
"1493780","1495920"," You can be in put spreads here. "
"1496200","1503460"," You can be in whatever you want put back spreads you name it what I hate is Uh, I guess"
"1503460","1508260"," I guess spreads might help you into next week But they can help just by the theta burn over the"
"1508260","1512680"," next few days I think the point that i'm trying to make to you is I feel like I can't"
"1512680","1516680"," short this market Until like we two rules for me."
"1516880","1523500"," We get underneath the hourly trigger in the second rule or not a rule but what's in my brain is"
"1523500","1533520"," that uh, we're likely going to Uh, we're likely going to um like"
"1534200","1538920"," Go sideways in the friday close and you know you like put the put you have to put you like"
"1538920","1545400"," your short on on friday at 359 or something stupid 415 or something on friday like we get pinned in"
"1545400","1551620"," a friday It's not really going down if you're in puts for next week you're gonna get torched Put"
"1551620","1552560"," spreads you'll be all right."
"1552780","1557380"," There's some people out there that are like I can take that move up to 4600 and then catch the"
"1557380","1565620"," roll But I want you to be aware that like between now and friday that you should expect uh Or"
"1565620","1574060"," start looking for a place That you can handle Uh, you can handle an upside move before for for 60"
"1574060","1581960"," 4600 which I believe is a slightly higher in spy but That you can handle that move higher And then"
"1581960","1584060"," the move down into next week. "
"1584340","1589940"," I expect next week that we have a pullback Historically I want you to all give you a caveat here"
"1589940","1597080"," too Historically the week after thanks given we start to sell the market for about a week to two"
"1597080","1603200"," weeks So be aware of that Now where that is I don't know like that that's my point here is"
"1603200","1609200"," You know, we could we could spend the next two three days Fucking around up here and then we don't"
"1609200","1615060"," get the roll until after the weekend So if you were to do a spread today, let's say you're gonna"
"1615060","1620280"," do a spread Yeah, you could you could take out all that Uh time or if you do like a"
"1620280","1626300"," credit spread or something or or a debit spread of some kind You could capture all that time decay"
"1626980","1633640"," Over the week or what we got what we got today Thursday friday and then you got saturday sunday and"
"1633640","1641000"," then monday So you got like five session or five days to torch a bunch of uh uh Time decay"
"1641660","1644060"," Uh and and get gather all that money."
"1644200","1653820"," So I expect Next week that we begin to sell now now Remember what I said We also need to"
"1653820","1658920"," be underneath that fucking that hourly trigger So let's say we come into monday We keep going up"
"1658920","1661880"," and grinding and we're above the hourly trigger."
"1662180","1666240"," Don't come back to me and be like hey captain, you said We're gonna start selling on money. "
"1666280","1671120"," It involves these other things you want to see us get underneath that hourly trigger And that's"
"1671120","1676340"," like the confirmation that we're gonna start heading heading lower and Uh, close out all those gaps"
"1676340","1679700"," down below that island reversal and there's something else here too."
"1679980","1688630"," Oh, they want to talk to you about and that is I'm saying go to spx again and that is"
"1688630","1694590"," um You know, we're trading one minutes and one minute and five minute charts around these parts,"
"1694950","1695010"," right?"
"1695010","1704630"," but If you look on spx on a four hour chart Uh, what are we looking at here, right?"
"1704850","1710610"," We're looking at a cup and handle potential cup and handle So we got we got the cup right over"
"1710610","1718170"," here And you got what normally happens after this is what you get the handle over here, right?"
"1719010","1719990"," Can we go higher?"
"1720890","1728970"," So if you're a bear You know that 460 you tee off it Or 4600 you tee off it And"
"1728970","1732930"," then I would limit my expectations for a downside move And that's kind of the point that I'm trying"
"1732930","1738230"," to make if you're buying a put spread here and you only get a couple points down here Uh, it's"
"1738230","1740850"," gonna it's gonna be it's gonna be a it's gonna put a hurting on you, right?"
"1741330","1747890"," So let's look at that really quick and see what we're talking about here You see where this gamma"
"1747890","1750950"," flip is right Down below over here."
"1750970","1758130"," We wrote that one in earlier So, you know can Would you rather take if you're gonna take this one"
"1758130","1764190"," here just be you're gonna take that put spread I would only be looking for that that put spread to"
"1764190","1770430"," come down to this um This this first this first gap down here. "
"1770650","1772410"," Do I think you get all the way down here?"
"1772630","1778050"," It's possible I would be day trading this this stuff down here to clean all this stuff up If you"
"1778050","1782290"," think that's what it's gonna be if you think that it's gonna be somewhere We come all the way down"
"1782290","1782490"," here."
"1782510","1783670"," I don't think that's the case."
"1783690","1788290"," I think that we only come down here Uh, just just down here me to clean this stuff up and"
"1788290","1795890"," then we're we're off and running you gotta remember too That we can leave behind these gaps And if"
"1795890","1799870"," it's the end of the year I want I want to let you know that this is we're in the"
"1799870","1804850"," end of the year end of the quarter that we can But end up leaving this shit behind and come"
"1804850","1810590"," back to deal with this shit Uh after the new year So, you know this stuff gets left behind we"
"1810590","1812610"," come back in the in the new year and take it out. "
"1812770","1819490"," So if you're a bear Just be try to be tactful if you're a seller try to be uh have"
"1819490","1820350"," stops, right?"
"1821610","1831350"," and try to try to Think about like like how deep we're going Take the money and run"
"1831850","1837290"," If we get underneath and start to reject here and start heading lower You can jump back in again"
"1837770","1846370"," For that second trade remember that hourly trigger is going to be huge for you as a seller Uh for"
"1846370","1853750"," like for like commitment to the downside and even so with that that um That would limit your"
"1853750","1859210"," expectations because if that shit gets bought up and it ends up turning into a cup and handle Um,"
"1859470","1860790"," you're gonna get in trouble, right?"
"1860950","1864730"," So just be aware as a as a bear where you need to be where you need to get under"
"1864730","1871790"," and all that kind of stuff Um in targets and things like that for downside moves And I do think"
"1871790","1872830"," that we go down next week."
"1872870","1878190"," I think that we're going to go back down Uh and then come back up for that 4,600."
"1878810","1881090"," I don't think we We might tag 4,600. "
"1881230","1886510"," I think that I think this um this might be like it for friday and even if we do tag"
"1886510","1889330"," 4,600 Uh, we're going to sell the fuck out of that."
"1889370","1894850"," So I want to wear another we're going to we're going to sell that one way or another Now that"
"1894850","1901910"," cup and handle That's setting up is setting up for an end of quarter Uh, believe it or not, uh,"
"1902270","1905890"," 4,800 Uh, I know that's shocking to you."
"1905890","1907330"," So let's say we get this pullback. "
"1907490","1915290"," So look in your bottom screen down here Right You get hold on a second here Let's bring this up"
"1915290","1919490"," here This is the 46 that PT right there, right?"
"1920270","1923270"," And we're so close, you know, it's pretty fucking close, right?"
"1923710","1928990"," But my expectation here is that we're going to sell down And then we're going to ramp up into"
"1928990","1938130"," december Uh, and possibly take out that 4,800 So just be aware of that into it's down below here."
"1938250","1944690"," Just be aware of This move into the end of the year up here If you're going to trade this"
"1944690","1949730"," this move up into that 4,800 if you're really get your eyes set on that there are some huge"
"1949730","1959690"," nodes Of calls at 4,800 on spx There's shit tons of them And not spx on spy spx"
"1959690","1967450"," has One standing order for an 800 lot sell at 4,800 but spy Specifically has a shit ton of"
"1967450","1974590"," calls at 4,800 expiring in, uh, the last, uh, expiry of december So just be aware of that and"
"1974590","1980130"," they might not hit it on the on the 34 or 29th, I believe this year Was the last day"
"1980130","1980310"," for them."
"1980450","1984410"," I think it's the last day of the market It could be the week after or the two weeks after"
"1984410","1988270"," so depending on how you're structuring your stuff If you're just in straight wantin straight calls"
"1988790","1993210"," You might need to put a month or two on them If you're gonna get some call spreads or something"
"1993210","1999810"," You probably need to put an extra at least two weeks on those call spreads Just like see why it's"
"1999810","2004010"," like see why I cover your ass In case it takes a week or two because what they'll try to"
"2004010","2007770"," do is kill all those calls I want you to know it They're gonna try to mer even if they"
"2007770","2013150"," even if they hit those calls all that that big node up there That big 4,800 node on spy"
"2013150","2018650"," at least You're likely going to see those calls get decimated Uh, so you want to be a little bit"
"2018650","2024410"," farther out So you don't get those calls get wrecked Um, you're not getting that theta killed that"
"2024410","2027250"," theta burn all that kind of stuff into the end of the end of the year So just be aware"
"2027250","2037170"," of it As you're planning out your as you're planning out your um uh, your trades here so uh, all"
"2037170","2043130"," in all All in all we've got mission is accomplished at this point Even if we go to 4,600"
"2043130","2049290"," mission is accomplished And you're looking for that pullback so that we can attempt to take out"
"2049290","2059370"," that 4,800 for uh end of year on spy Or spx uh, I should say Uh"
"2059370","2069290"," Uh Hold on a second here Okay I'm gonna bring"
"2069290","2075730"," this in a little bit here There's everybody clearing that now there's some talk out there I saw"
"2075730","2082889"," people on fin to it yesterday loaded up on vix calls and they got fucking annihilated This morning. "
"2083370","2089570"," I used to trade vix and I assure you Whoever was buying those vix calls Those those things are"
"2089570","2096490"," fucking dead Uh, vix is you want to be an exacting trader, man You trade vix vix is vix is"
"2096490","2100370"," when people say vix is broken It's because it's not an easy thing to trade."
"2100410","2107490"," So, um I was looking at the vix there's some contango with vix right now and we can easily I"
"2108210","2110390"," Pointed toward you towards march."
"2110770","2118610"," I believe Of this year and I showed you how vix can grind sideways up or down slightly And the"
"2118610","2126370"," market can just grind up into the right Uh, and not we don't get like 30 points on vix So,"
"2126370","2134770"," uh, so you might be tempted to buy vix calls for the vix hit Low this morning Uh, not the"
"2134770","2136590"," low but hit a low this morning. "
"2136610","2146140"," Let me take a look at it where we're tagged Yeah, it was almost a pin strike"
"2147140","2154500"," I was looking for $12.85. It was slightly higher than that And the next the next level down for"
"2154500","2164340"," vix is uh, $12.73 So if we go to like 1273 on vix While taking out for uh"
"2164340","2170520"," for 60 that's on the table vix is showing that right now that we can easily do that Uh, so"
"2170520","2174780"," vix isn't to me anyone that's out there saying I see people on fin twits saying you can buy the"
"2174780","2181320"," or buy the vix here I guess so Um, but I like I think you I think we can easily"
"2181320","2185840"," take vix down to I think I said 12 1273."
"2185960","2191500"," Let me chat Yeah, 1273 is easy easy."
"2191880","2196820"," This is this room here is my point on the vix Uh for us for the vix to continue to"
"2196820","2197900"," go down for the rest of this week. "
"2198020","2204400"," So I don't know It depends on how you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna um You're gonna plan this"
"2204400","2214200"," uh this roll over that we expect to happen here Into next week That is the sound the dragon"
"2214200","2218800"," makes Do I think the same for q's and iwm?"
"2219260","2226620"," So there's a rotation going on it's good question There's a rotation going on right now That's kind"
"2226620","2233140"," of discombobulated Like I was looking at um today or this morning."
"2233340","2240180"," I was looking at john dair right And there's a rotation out of us like this john dair's a great"
"2240180","2247300"," fucking example uh, there's a rotation going on in and out of uh, let's look at a couple of these"
"2247300","2252220"," stocks from Like if you all right we don't have to look at them on your own look at a"
"2252220","2259400"," company like john dair on a daily chart over the course of a year That shit's never come back down"
"2259400","2260280"," from covid."
"2260300","2268160"," Okay now They're cycling out of john dair Okay, even even if it gets bulls for the next week or"
"2268160","2272680"," two, they're cycling out of it But then you look at a company Let's say like tyson foods or you"
"2272680","2275040"," look at a company like a budweiser, right?"
"2275680","2282540"," And they're cycling into those tickers right now So there there's like that there's a um, there's a"
"2282540","2284400"," rotation, but it's not a full. "
"2284600","2285620"," It's not it's weird."
"2285800","2291860"," See me see this week said Uh expect the like expect like don't be Uh looking at individual tickers"
"2291860","2297160"," and i'm like we're doing that and fucking not are in uh, dao john's right now They're literally"
"2297160","2303500"," still rotating out a bunch of covid stocks and dao john's and rotating into some stocks Into the"
"2303500","2310620"," dao john's industrial average and I think that might be the uh, that might be the same for uh, iwm"
"2310620","2317520"," and Specifically, I think you do see a rotation out of tech And s&p 500 into next week You"
"2317520","2323760"," may find individual tickers in the next week in dao john's industrial average and an iwm that are"
"2323760","2333580"," fine Whatever that pullback is Though you should see it play out still Uh in the in in in the"
"2333580","2340680"," wider market in iwm and the cues you should see that same pullback uh, if you overlay a chart of"
"2340680","2350460"," Uh, iwm Small cap small craps small cap small caps And uh spy you can you'll see"
"2350460","2358240"," divergence for like half a day Maybe a day But it generally follows the same track as s&p 500"
"2358980","2366700"," Nasdaq has out outperforms oftentimes, but it still generally follows the same Even they have"
"2366700","2372240"," outsized Outsized down moves and up moves in nasdaq, but you still have the general it still"
"2372240","2379120"," follows the s&p 500 Remember s&p 500 is built with tech in it Um, so it's it's more"
"2379120","2385440"," breath out of the market and of course dia has All the blue chip breath too, but Uh, so yeah,"
"2385620","2387280"," do I think there's a pullback coming for all of it?"
"2387460","2389220"," Fuck yeah, I do absent fucking lily."
"2389420","2399300"," Oh, I I do if we get underneath that hourly trigger uh And the the call"
"2399300","2400420"," wall is at 4600. "
"2400420","2404760"," I mean if I start to list this stuff off to you Think about this if you're a bull right"
"2404760","2409520"," start to think about this right you got the vix the vix is almost that it's at it's Uh, the"
"2409520","2416260"," yearly low right here Right, it's you got uh, the call wall is at 4600."
"2416480","2423300"," We just traded 40 45 70 I believe 45 75 maybe And you know, I don't know how to say"
"2423300","2428560"," anything you start stacking all this stuff up And it starts to look like yeah, we're gonna roll at"
"2428560","2429000"," some point."
"2429200","2435900"," So if you're a bull here And you're looking for that trade like I'm gonna roll with 25 grand 50"
"2435900","2441900"," grand or something hundred grand Just cool off for a little bit Uh cool often for the next couple"
"2441900","2442820"," weeks two three weeks. "
"2442980","2449500"," We'll sit in your hands do something else And you should see a nice fucking dip by with uh, and"
"2449500","2453100"," in the short term Sometime late next week."

"2562480","2565940"," squeeze all over the fuck up on the bell And by that point, I'm tired. "
"2566160","2571940"," I'm like I feel like I just got done working or something So I didn't want to take puts uh"
"2571940","2577700"," or even a put spread It was more it's not more like I don't want to I should like probably"
"2577700","2582180"," should have bought some put some put spreads for A couple weeks out on that paying up there."

"2611820","2618140"," if we go to 4600 you're likely going to be safe Uh And make some serious money in the next"
"2618140","2618980"," couple weeks in that trade. "
"2619180","2624260"," So if you did that congratulations to you Uh, you likely took if you took a put spread right up"

"2632300","2635960"," and take it You could go up just a little bit more and bounce up there and look for that"
"2635960","2640400"," uh roll back down into next week If you took that put spread up there, whatever you structured it"
"2640400","2643960"," Congratulations to you're setting yourself up real nice up there."

"2694480","2696200"," not quite topped out on deli velocity."
"2696200","2704860"," So i'm um, i'm passively bullish here Um, but we're close to a top so either either at that four"
"2704860","2713060"," seven 4570 or that or that see that yeah 45 75 For that 4600 You should start to see a"
"2713060","2718740"," topping action in the deli velocity and It sees whatever that next ramp is it's probably going to"
"2718740","2722940"," be done at some point in here And you'll see you'll see us start to top out. "

"3899490","3909420"," tickers for you, okay So we've got uh nvidia I was bullish on nvidia to the upside, right?"
"3909800","3915740"," They sold it they didn't care We're gonna get this nvidia conversation CNBC is pushing a narrative"
"3916400","3923480"," So I don't understand the entire narrative from nvda nvda And seem to see us pushing this narrative"
"3923480","3929120"," of oh, we took the money and ran And i'm like if you took the fucking money and run if"
"3929120","3934700"," you took the money and ran On nvidia then that was way back here in the 15th, right?"
"3935940","3941920"," So why are they pushing that narrative That they took the money and run i'm not buying that"
"3941920","3951120"," narrative on nvda on nvidia so I'm not as bearish as some of you might be uh, I can see"
"3951120","3958520"," the idea that that that the That the options market's not going to want to print this Move to the"
"3958520","3967800"," upside But they could print this after next week so that upside moves so Be patient with nvda If"
"3967800","3974940"," you have calls or call spreads, I should say Uh, you probably will still get that that prints to"
"3974940","3975380"," the upside."
"3976000","3983700"," I'm not bearish on nvda even with this weakness um So what we're going to look at here is an"
"3983700","3992760"," nvda is I'm going to draw this out right here And you'll see that weakness in the market next week"
"3997460","4014840"," Let's switch that over It's"
"4014840","4030100"," nvda and then market You got all that volatility and make"
"4030100","4039300"," that bigger maybe you can see it So something just like that right there, okay So if you're trading"
"4039300","4046060"," nvda, I do expect an nv to come back up trade this And then bleed off in the next week"
"4046580","4049820"," And then you're going to get your larger move over here next week."
"4049940","4059570"," So there's nvda for you That's the idea on nvda Consolidation then I move higher"
"4060350","4070990"," Uh, we're going to then do tesla tesla man bullish Uh,"
"4071770","4076370"," so it would not not bullish I am not bullish on tesla. "

"4080090","4088450"," We're going to talk tesla, okay um I want to bring this up in a larger chart, but I shouldn't"
"4088450","4093330"," say that I'm not bullish Um, how should I describe it?"
"4096229","4102149"," What the i'm going to switch over really quick to I'm going to switch over so you can see this"
"4102149","4111750"," is tesla My one concern with tesla is That I don't like uh, the failure to get a new high"
"4112229","4117010"," This is a big larger time frame right 30 minute chart I never liked seeing this here."
"4117109","4122490"," I never liked seeing the failure to get the new high I really would have liked to have seen tesla"
"4122490","4131330"," get that new high Even if there was a major pullback To then get that cup and handle so On"
"4131330","4141319"," tesla i'm bullish here on it Where we are on bullish, but I think we do"
"4141319","4151200"," pull back Uh, I think we do pull back or at least grind Then that's when you start to see"
"4151200","4158680"," or um Uh, the targets that you're looking at those upside targets that you're looking for up here"
"4159920","4162859"," Just that's the first one right there. "
"4162859","4173040"," Yeah, so It actually comes down Right there and then it pulls back And"
"4173040","4181580"," that's when you get your bigger upside move there That one goes right there Right there Let's go"

"4226000","4234640"," more time than you think um So tesla It's tentatively bullish for the rest of the week Uh price"
"4234640","4244500"," target 238 240 Uh, and then maybe one more push up into friday you could possibly come back up here"
"4244500","4250520"," in a friday intent to trade that 243 Uh, maybe you'll get slightly higher and trade that 250."
"4251060","4252280"," It's possibly get this friday."

"9381570","9388490"," fucking followers He's never once made a conspiracy theorist, uh video He doesn't make any videos"
"9388490","9397110"," having to do with war or terrorism or anything This guy's platform is not that This guy is also,"
"9397110","9405730"," uh, the son of a very famous astronaut Uh for for the us And uh, he only made this he"
"9405730","9406390"," made this video. "
"9406470","9414550"," It happened in march Uh, but he's only now, uh, making the video And i'm not really a fan of"
"9414550","9416910"," his format or how he speaks."
"9417330","9425490"," I don't like his Um Um He talks but it does that's more a personal thing Key point is the"
"9425490","9427190"," is what he talks about in the video."
"9427370","9428430"," That's important for you to know. "
"9428610","9437490"," So I behoove you to watch that video um And Start to like start thinking about that video the video"
"9437490","9444710"," is very concerning Uh Probably the closest thing you're going to get to the truth to Uh, when I was"
"9444710","9448290"," when I was in the military everything's a fucking lie What they tell you publicly as a as a"
"9448290","9452590"," civilian is completely different than the truth What's really happening and this guy's a civilian."
"9452870","9460590"," So, um When he made that video, that's probably true Or it's truer than you're going to be told by"
"9460590","9465010"," our government Uh, so I would be watching it closely."
"9465290","9466770"," I'd watch that over this weekend. "
"9467450","9473350"," Uh, that video that is posted to you Yeah, the channel's cool."
"9473710","9481670"," His his topics are cool Uh, but know that this guy is not like He's not like rfk."

"9484050","9486950"," He has zero background Talking about this stuff."

"9493530","9495430"," you ever been to micronesia the islands are really small."
"9495570","9501510"," Everybody knows each other Um And something like that is totally fucking plausible. "
"9501890","9508210"," What he what he encountered and witnessed And i'm sure That people talked that he that was the talk"
"9508210","9513270"," on the island as well Uh, that everybody was talking about that happening and he happened to he"
"9513270","9526050"," happened to get caught up in Some stuff that's very concerning Yeah,"

"9887580","9894760"," I think if I ever got a divorce now at my age I would probably stay single forever."
"9895080","9900460"," I don't think I think it'd be done Make things could change, but I guess I could fall in love,"
"9900620","9906840"," but I wouldn't actively be looking for a relationship I got too much shit And I'd probably be"
"9906840","9912400"," friendly with my wife if I could and of course the kids and all that shit You gotta take care."
"9912480","9913920"," I gotta take care of the kids and all that stuff. "
"9913920","9923530"," So Um, I don't know that I'd actively seek out a relationship at this point in my life Uh, so"

"10435840","10440940"," yelling or just saying You know, you said something and now you're saying something different So my"
"10440940","10443320"," response to him was uh, I wrote a good question."
"10443740","10447680"," Thanks for asking us people like to have selective hearing not you Uh, I said there is no long"
"10447680","10453820"," position unless spies above 452 It was a gamma node that we need to get above to go long We"
"10453820","10459120"," got above it on the opening bell on monday updated to uh, I updated to a long to 450 5"
"10459120","10461380"," 0 on monday. "
"10461580","10467660"," We traded that into the close on monday Uh And we tagged it at the end of the day on"
"10467660","10473060"," monday Otherwise longing was lower if we stayed below 452 And there's a key point here about this"
"10473060","10479880"," there's a very very key point here Uh, which is not this person not Tommy, but other people will"
"10480600","10489020"," have what's called selective hearing and so Uh, so my my point here is this so to you is that"
"10489640","10497380"," I'll usually give you uh, I'll usually give you Like if this then that or if that then this and"
"10497380","10506380"," so on uh sunday or friday or whatever it was into monday Expectations that holds true right here"
"10506380","10506600"," too."
"10506600","10517050"," So on this we will chart right here Right on this we will chart right here I"
"10517050","10521450"," said this morning that You're a buyer here, right?"
"10522590","10524530"," So you're this is this is the hourly trigger."
"10524530","10528870"," This is up trend Right, so i'm bullish. "
"10529450","10535490"," We can trade this all we want, right Uh, this is that next gamma gamma node up here, right?"
"10535650","10537910"," We can trade this up down up down up down up down, right?"
"10539410","10544690"," Uh, but we need to get a buck so this node here becomes this node right here So if we"
"10544690","10547730"," can get up here, I get bullish again to this right here."
"10547790","10548270"," Does it make sense?"
"10548990","10556030"," Uh, now let's say let's say today we broke down below this hourly trigger Right, um, then the dip"
"10556030","10556910"," buy would be lower."
"10557130","10562710"," Does that make sense or you're buying a dip right here with a stop underneath it Right and if"
"10562710","10565070"," you'll say you know, there's always risk, right?"
"10565770","10570470"," So let's say you're buying this dip down here and it goes against you you your stops are triggered"
"10570910","10573590"," And then your your dip buy is even lower, right?"
"10574070","10575410"," It's it's down here, right?"
"10576230","10583450"," Um So I I guess the idea here is I can give you I can tell you I can tell"
"10583450","10589450"," you I guess what I can do is I can always tell you hey, we're going to 460 by friday,"
"10589470","10589750"," right?"
"10590010","10596190"," We're going to go to 460 by friday Now if we start to sell right let's say you start breaking"
"10596190","10600670"," below the hourly trigger and we're not at friday yet You have to have a plan, right?"
"10601430","10605710"," And you know, it does a really good job of this is uh, chris tamarco does a good job of"
"10605710","10611990"," this And uh matt ryan does a good job of this and that is um, i'm a momentum trader, but"
"10611990","10617710"," i'm also a price action trader um So in regard to some of gamma tells me I really don't give"

"10668990","10673970"," and Uh, they then what happens is price doesn't go there, right?"
"10674270","10680850"," They said they get they all it's invalidated I'm a price target of 460 right Using le wave We don't"

"12309050","12314510"," right because they're controlling the the product Um, so so certainly that's not big of an issue"

"12342070","12345970"," was 18 years because for luxury it feels like you never wanted that again Why are they falling back"
"12345970","12347270"," are they are they nervous about the economy?"
"12347510","12350350"," They just got what they need or want It's probably a little bit of both."
"12350430","12353810"," I think the luxury consumers very leverage their confidence, right?"
"12353910","12358610"," It's not an ability to buy they still can buy whatever they want It's how confident do they feel"
"12358610","12362410"," and I think there's been something that's happened if it's the macro conditions if it's interest"

"12364830","12365690"," It's really impacted."

"12400450","12405230"," employees to do more right do the pick up to Watch this storm or closely, but but I think that"
"12405230","12409250"," the employment situation probably less acute than it was this time last Where does this leave you"
"12409250","12409670"," on the stocks?"
"12410130","12413890"," Especially we've had some big declineers like walmart We've had some big gainers like burlington"

"12417970","12422690"," We like value a lot right now So I think a walmart in the target Um, you know, they they"
