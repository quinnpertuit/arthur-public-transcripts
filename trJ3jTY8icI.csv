"41350","44690"," Yeah, I don't know why I got a lot of you guys listening right now."
"45870","49510"," I got kicked off, but I don't know why I got kicked off."
"51230","61270"," Probably somebody reported the videos, if I had to guess right, so"
"61270","69070"," it was saying on my end that I was still streaming, and on my end it was saying I was"
"69070","69870"," streaming still. "
"70490","75970"," Let me post this on Twitter, hold on a second, let's share this one too."
"82530","83810"," So when did it cut out?"
"84010","85370"," What time did the stream stop?"
"87010","91310"," So I probably got somebody probably reported me because they were stinky about it."
"101610","110750"," No, it's nobody complaining about DMCA, there's some, there's some fair use stuff out there. "
"116720","117840"," Yeah, so here we go."
"118020","128740"," Here's that fucking rip for you, pump it higher, pump it daddy, pump"
"128740","129220"," it for daddy."
"131440","137380"," Yeah they love selling their shit out there, they love selling, they love that I pump it for them"
"137380","137620"," too. "
"137620","144360"," You got dang rag ripping, they love when you're selling, they love that you, and you know what the"
"144360","151420"," worst part is, right, I can contact them and they would give me probably the shit for free for"
"151420","155440"," selling, selling doing this, you know, bookmark, bookmap does this with people."
"156100","165980"," All these services want you to pump their services because then you go out and buy them, you end up"
"165980","170800"," getting it for yourself, they know what it means, slap that ass baby, push it."
"171940","177120"," They like when I talk about, they like, if I say spot cam at 10 times in a day, Brent,"
"177780","182320"," Brent Kopachal is probably over there just banging stroking himself because he's getting free"
"182320","188480"," advertising, bookmap is stroking themselves because they know you're going to buy them so I look at"
"188480","194620"," Tesla and other tickers, Flow Algo knows that they have all got all kinds of other information out"
"194620","196820"," there so you'll be listening to them and that kind of stuff. "
"199160","204400"," So don't channel from the trade the news broadcast network, if you are hearing this message your"
"204400","207640"," sound card and network configuration, that's we're good to go."
"209980","217200"," So the key being is, yeah don't be panic selling today, I know it pissed people off just more than"
"217200","217660"," that's fine."
"217880","223260"," So I don't know why the stream ended, why I got kicked off stream, someone probably got pissed off"
"223260","226320"," and reported me or like four or five people and they're all but hurt. "
"226820","231780"," And now they're all but hurt that their fucking puts are getting crushed, I'm going to post that on"
"231780","252700"," tour, I'm going to post a lot of second, there,"
"252880","262460"," fuck your puts, there you go, yeah see so John Alexander just says to your point to have on"
"262460","263240"," bookmap now."
"263600","264740"," So here's the key, right?"
"264920","268960"," I don't pump anything to you guys, I don't get paid by any of these companies."
"269520","275060"," I don't receive this stuff for free, I pay for my shit and they're getting free advertising from"
"275060","275280"," me. "
"275640","279280"," So there should be no issues out there or complaints from them, there should be no fucking"
"279280","279620"," problems."
"280320","285780"," This has more to do with pissing off a group of people that are setting their ways and then when"
"285780","289740"," I piss them off they're going to report my video till it gets taken down or I catch a strike,"
"290200","297240"," fuck them, fuck them, I don't give a flying fuck, I honestly don't, I'm not losing anything here, I"
"297240","303420"," don't lose anything out of this deal, I don't deal with churn, I don't deal with like losing"
"303420","308460"," subscribers, I've got, I've got an offsite website, if you guys ever seen me get kicked off Twitter"
"308460","314960"," or YouTube, I have an offsite website that Joe donut helped me with, he's hooked me up and I've got"
"314960","317020"," chate and just helped me up with another website."
"317020","322140"," So don't ever worry about this, they can't take shit away from me, I can do live streams on my"
"322140","327860"," own website with my own streaming service, my own video player, so I can get this stuff to you all"
"327860","333860"," I want, there ain't nobody that's going to fuck with Captain Jim James, nobody can lick my balls"
"335430","347000"," for the"
"347000","352000"," people all day, every day forever, that's what it always will be, it's always what it was, it's the"
"352000","357860"," only way that I can live with myself, I've got a wife, I've got two daughters, I have two dogs,"
"359480","367520"," you know like my life isn't built around being an asshole, so the only time you hear me freaking"
"367520","373260"," out is because it hurts man, I don't want to be hurt, I don't want people out there, I don't,"
"373460","379480"," I get hurt because I take that shit personally, you know, I take that, that, you know what it is,"
"379580","385260"," I take personal, it's like when I was young right, you're in high school, this is a good story, so"
"385260","389460"," you're, so we're setting up right now right, getting back to this, you can see here a little bit of"
"389460","397600"," resistance following my cursor, 369, 373, 71, you see the calls coming in right now, $1.3 million,"
"398260","403120"," watch my cursor up here, right, you saw that spike, calls coming in for a couple million dollars,"
"403400","407960"," it's giving that push up to the market, right, so you got two things working for you and sometimes"
"407960","413060"," against you, new hedges will come on and push it down, but the two things in your favor is any"
"413060","419280"," longs coming into the market on this OPEX and the expiry of huge puts today should help you out,"
"419360","424020"," the dealer should help you out today on this trade as we go along the rest of the day. "
"424600","429400"," Now the story from when I was a kid, when I was young right, I was a good looking guy,"
"429520","433720"," I'm an older guy now, you know, I could admit that right, but I'm not some, you know, not a"
"433720","439060"," offense of your fatty broken down at your older age, but I took care of myself, I ate the right"
"439060","446800"," foods, I only did drugs and didn't drink, but you know, I played sport, took care of myself, ate"
"446800","451320"," healthy, lived a healthy life, but when I was a young guy, I was in the military, so I was"
"451320","455800"," always in shape required to be in shape, but when I was a young guy, I was a good looking"
"455800","463620"," guy, I had a nice affable personality, I attracted all kinds of girls to me, so I had like good"
"463620","471380"," girlfriends and bad girlfriends, and when you're young, you end up attracting sometimes crazy, when"
"471380","475700"," you're when you're dicks thinking for you, when you're dicks out there thinking for you when you're"
"475700","482160"," young, I'm going to lose this real quick here, okay, I want to make sure that this is lined up"
"482160","482680"," to where we are."
"483380","489480"," When you're dicks thinking for you, when you're the wrong captain is thinking, you know, if you're"
"489480","492240"," a woman and you're listening, right, put some air muffs on."
"494100","502500"," So when you're, yeah, look at that TQQ calls coming in, you can see right here, we're getting a"
"502500","504780"," pump in the market, we should trade up higher to this 371. "
"506520","514059"," So when you're, when you're a young guy, even when you're smart, if you have testosterone run"
"514059","519059"," through, through you're like crazy, you're like, wow, I want to, I want to get with that girl over"
"519059","519260"," there."
"520140","523400"," And that girl's typically really hot, or whatever you consider to be hot."
"525060","530240"," We don't know is that, we don't know is that that girl's probably fucking crazy. "
"530940","532820"," Not all of them, but a good percentage of them."
"534200","539000"," The ones that are like focused on how they look, not the ones that are just naturally beautiful,"
"539300","542160"," even you know, girls that aren't that beautiful, but they're just kind of natural."
"542900","548020"," Care more about their friendships, care more about their experiences, care more about learning,"
"548680","551320"," care more about living a great life. "
"552160","555800"," That really didn't matter when I was young, I was like, I want to fuck the hottest girl in the"
"555800","556000"," room."
"557100","558440"," I shouldn't have been like that."
"560640","561700"," Because that attracted crazy. "
"562280","568300"," If you mark seven catching a bid, the last year, that's that now two and a quarter percent S&P"
"568300","570220"," up almost 1%."
"571380","575160"," Well, the same thing I applied that same principle and concept to the stock market."
"576320","579800"," When you're a new trader, you attract crazy and you like it. "
"584420","588640"," But as we become an older trader, you calm down a little bit."
"589600","590840"," Let me try not to attract crazy."
"591220","598540"," So when crazy comes into the picture, you're like, you're more apt as you get older to be like, hit"
"598540","599920"," the fuck God out of here. "
"613330","615770"," Wiki's like, I don't want to do this all day long with your cap."
"616270","618190"," He's like, he's like, this day sucks."
"618470","619170"," It does suck. "
"619270","620070"," This is just like yesterday."
"621610","623030"," Like yesterday is trading day."
"623170","626630"," When I woke up, well, you hear, look at, um, let's look at yesterday real quick. "
"629250","630690"," So like yesterday, right?"
"631290","638900"," Man, yesterday, let's say yesterday real quick."
"641770","646690"," So yesterday, sorry, I cleared this entire chart."
"647270","649730"," So yesterday we closed this, we closed this on Wednesday. "
"650230","652270"," I was like, I'm closing my calls here or something."
"653450","655390"," I was like, don't pick any overnight calls."
"655390","657370"," I'm probably going to trade down at some point tomorrow. "
"658190","659370"," Oh, this is the wrong one."
"659450","659930"," That's XLF."
"660830","661850"," That's why I didn't clear it out. "
"665480","667060"," Yes, I think this was right here."
"668100","669660"," Matter of fact, I even left it a good thing."
"669680","670300"," I didn't clear it out. "
"670480","674800"," So remember when I said to you on Wednesday, I was like, I was like, I'm probably going to come"
"674800","677360"," down here tomorrow at some point and test this level."
"679060","680140"," And we did, right?"
"680300","682360"," But we did it overnight, which I was stoked at."
"682480","684440"," I was like, so we woke up on Thursday yesterday. "
"685000","687280"," I was like, I'm not fucking live streaming."
"688320","692040"," I'm like, we woke up to this instead of trading down to this on Thursday."
"692740","695820"," And of course, probably going to go to this lower low, this S2, right?"
"696020","698200"," We talked about this on Wednesday, predictions, right?"
"698460","699300"," Crystal fucking ball. "
"701040","702060"," And then we did, right?"
"702260","703400"," This Thursday was brutal."
"703740","704360"," Like watching this."
"705080","706140"," I was like, I ain't doing this. "
"706920","708000"," I was like, I'm not trading this."
"708220","709380"," I'm not even buying any puts in here."
"709500","710880"," I'm like, I don't even want to sit here. "
"711280","717260"," Because you really literally have to buy like a put spread here and hold it until, I don't know,"
"717260","718820"," and we're kind of doing that same thing now, right?"
"718920","721220"," We get that little dip down below here, right?"
"721380","724780"," We actually tagged yesterday's Vwap."
"724940","725960"," You can see it right here."
"726040","734020"," My cursor tagged that nice Vwap, came back down for a support buy, traded right back up here, and"
"734020","735380"," right back up here right now. "
"735700","739560"," And that's what Winky's talking about is like, Mark, he's like, Mark, Winky, Winky wants like,"
"740200","749100"," Winky wants this, Winky's like, I want this, this, this, and this, the clothes, and they're"
"749100","749960"," dragging us out here."
"750480","753420"," So if they drag us out here today, let's say they drag us out here today."
"755020","757540"," And they're like, let's say they're like, fuck you, we're not doing this. "
"759140","765220"," We're not going to deliver a three cooperation under three count of parties taking 2.29 trillion."
"765680","769120"," Let's say we're going to drag this out here, right?"
"769860","773440"," And they're like, we're not going to spend all this put gamma today."
"773920","774680"," Well, that's, that's fine. "
"774680","777260"," It's a fresh record in the university for operation."
"777580","780500"," If we don't get it today at some point to the close, I think we get it in the close."
"780520","782180"," I think we're going to rip the fuck up in the close. "
"782480","788480"," But if we don't, what we're going to get is we're going to get an ass blaster 3000 over here"
"788480","789820"," on Tuesday."
"791560","797340"," Now, if this is what happens, if this is the outcome, and let's say we close, let's say, let's say"
"797340","800960"," the bears like no cap, we're going to close it way down here."
"801400","801880"," That's fine. "
"802740","803800"," How do you deal with this?"
"804060","812080"," You just buy some fucking three week calls, or you buy some call spreads in the money down here for"
"812080","813100"," like Tuesday or Wednesday."
"813660","816200"," Doing a bottle with zero dates, just get some spreads."
"816920","823620"," Get them with like, get them with some fucking some, some what do you call it?"
"823740","828920"," It's not a debit to get the other ones credit spreads right down here, and it'll fucking bang up"
"828920","830360"," here on Monday. "
"830540","833240"," So either way, that's the implied move."
"834120","839780"," We're either going up here today or going up here Tuesday, Wednesday, but they might, they could do"
"839780","840420"," some fucking here."
"840540","845100"," Sometimes they're like Wednesday better for spreads because they'd be like on Tuesday, ah, I"
"845100","845440"," gotcha. "
"845660","846500"," You didn't get what you needed."
"846500","850040"," And they'll slam it up on Wednesday when they've cleared out all the call buyers."
"851120","853200"," So the safest bet's probably Wednesday. "
"853760","859040"," But otherwise, day trade and this, my hope is that we do something like this at some point today."
"859660","863220"," Even if it's last 15 minutes, you're going to have calls, you know, it's funny about days like"
"863220","865760"," today, you have a call like right here."
"866580","869280"," And then you watch it just burn. "
"870500","873240"," Last 15 minutes it just fucking booms."
"874760","877260"," And just cranks up here like 376."
"877880","880420"," I show you not like 372 last 15 minutes, 376. "
"881340","882680"," Now this would be the tops for today."
"882780","885200"," You got one, two, and three."
"886640","889040"," Let me get some some daytime tops up here, right?"
"890000","894040"," Top up here, top up here, and a top up here. "
"895060","896880"," And the real top is closing this gap above."
"897720","900660"," This is like, this is like, this is what Winky wants."
"900940","903080"," Winky's like, I want to close all this shit on Friday. "
"903400","904880"," Let's wrap it up and take a long weekend."
"905540","906480"," Let's be out of here."
"912480","915520"," Let's have a look at 400C on 715. "
"918360","919500"," Yeah, am I a millionaire?"
"920060","923300"," I don't know how you'd describe am I a millionaire?"
"925800","926960"," Depends on how you look at it."
"929040","931000"," In some respects, no, not a millionaire."
"931440","933260"," In other respects, yes, I am. "
"935960","940760"," You have to think about my debt."
"940980","943220"," You have to think about what I make for money."
"945160","948960"," You have to think about what I don't appreciate or appreciate. "
"949660","951380"," You have to think about what I spend my money on."
"952880","956480"," Then you have to look at what I like, you know, like, I've got two daughters that are private or"
"956480","958060"," homeschooled in a private school."
"958660","961240"," Just that alone, like, is like a giant sucking sound. "
"968830","970450"," Yeah, they're going to rip the Band-Aid off."
"970690","978990"," They don't, they can carry the, if they carry, if they carry the, um, if they carry, hold on a"
"978990","982030"," second, I'm going to give you hope, stuff all squared away again."
"984530","994960"," If they carry over the, um, if they carry over the, oh"
"994960","997260"," yeah, this one makes me want to run in here. "
"998240","1004200"," If they carry over the gamma into Monday, Tuesday, or close the Monday, but if they carry that"
"1004200","1014620"," gamma over into, um, if they carry that gamma over into Monday, Columbia,"
"1014820","1018120"," April economic activity, up to 12%."
"1020010","1024859"," If they, if they, if they, it's more than the 9.6% expected for Columbia."
"1025240","1025599"," Oh shit. "
"1030190","1030910"," That's good."
"1031770","1034430"," I know it's a small economy, but it's still good."
"1035410","1042750"," In a 12% versus 9.6 expected Columbia, April economic activity index means that people are"
"1042750","1047870"," traveling, means that Americans are going, this is, this is implying not what Columbia is doing. "
"1048250","1053830"," It's implying that they rely a lot upon tourism in Columbia, means that U.S. citizens are still"
"1053830","1057050"," traveling, which is good for the economy, good for our economy."
"1057790","1065190"," So if let's say they carry that over into Monday, maybe they're saying, well, we want to see if, we"
"1065190","1068650"," want to see if Jamie Diamond slams the market with books at the end of the day, that would make"
"1068650","1068930"," sense."
"1069770","1075250"," Uh, their weight, so smaller funds, smaller banks are waiting to ensure they don't get trapped. "
"1075330","1076530"," That would make sense, right?"
"1076690","1077810"," That you're like, yeah, you know what I'm going to do?"
"1078450","1083350"," I'm going to wait till the end of the day on the 17th and the 30th to place any longs"
"1083350","1084750"," until I see what the big banks do."
"1090950","1094190"," That they slam the market with anybody knowing would make sense to me."
"1094190","1094430"," That's it. "
"1094550","1098270"," If I was a smaller hedge fund, I'd be like, yeah, we're not putting a third of our money to"
"1098270","1100910"," work yet until we find out what the big boys are doing."
"1101550","1105070"," Uh, we're going to wait for the caller to come out on JPM at the end of the month."
"1105150","1105930"," That makes sense to me. "
"1110870","1116930"," I've got, uh, I do want to make you aware that, uh, there's a pin on the market right now"
"1116930","1120270"," that just came in on June 17th for today expiry."
"1120930","1129890"," Uh, that they, you've got bears or HFTs or algos have, uh, entered into 360 P."
"1131410","1136830"," Uh, they've got, they're at till 14 cents right now, 232,000 puts."
"1138750","1142390"," Well, though I think they're going to, I think they're going to murder those at some point. "
"1142790","1144090"," There's nobody on the call side."
"1144290","1147430"," 370 C is where all the bulls are right now."
"1147610","1149650"," 370 C, they're worth 73 cents currently. "
"1150610","1151910"," 71 cents right now."
"1154320","1155180"," That's where all the bulls are."
"1157390","1162730"," Had a little bit of a rejection above here at, at, at this, uh, 368 three, or, excuse me, 368,"
"1163330","1166090"," uh, 91 or so 75. "
"1169230","1173630"," We want to see more calls coming in for large money to get up higher again for the next pump."
"1183020","1185280"," Yeah, that's a good point that Winky's making."
"1185280","1187800"," You can see that we've got new support down below at 363. "
"1188020","1189440"," We'll take a look at that real quick."
"1191350","1192610"," Yeah, they have moved up."
"1192730","1194730"," You can see that Winky's pointing that out. "
"1194750","1195410"," Good job, Winky."
"1196030","1198350"," Uh, you're seeing intraday support now at 363."
"1200370","1203270"," These buyers down the buyers, 358 is still there. "
"1203350","1207690"," They were there earlier today, but these buyers here have moved their stops up at this point."
"1208250","1212990"," We should do a video on stops at some point so that, um, we can talk to you guys about"
"1212990","1216650"," how to, uh, save your money that you're making."
"1217110","1218150"," We'll do that at some point. "
"1218430","1222890"," One of these, well, you know, I should do is I should, like, I should actually do it."
"1223470","1228450"," Like, make a trade live on air and show you how you move your stops up as you go going"
"1228450","1229470"," in the direction that you want."
"1230010","1233430"," When it reverses, you're able to take money and then reenter again for the next leg. "
"1235130","1239090"," We were talking about that this week, or I was asked to talk about that on the last stream that"
"1239090","1242630"," I did, about how, when I moved my stops and that kind of stuff."
"1245530","1247330"," We'll leave that back up so you guys can see it."
"1247610","1249590"," You guys now, you guys now have the bitch in feed. "
"1250030","1250910"," Let me know if you see it."
"1251010","1255330"," Let me know if you know another feed out there that's got a candlestick chart and a spot can and"
"1255330","1257930"," trade the news and options flow live on it."
"1258210","1258810"," I don't know if you do. "
"1258930","1260630"," I don't know if there is one out there that does that shit."
"1270280","1271740"," We have some weirdness going on."
"1272500","1273360"," Oh, yeah. "
"1274040","1282680"," Point red five three, which is a winky saying he's got 22,000 contracts on 715 400 C that came"
"1282680","1283000"," out."
"1292400","1297000"," Markets in mayhem is tweeting that yields are falling back to earth as investors decide that bonds"
"1297000","1299620"," might be worth buying at least for five minutes."
"1299680","1300980"," I think that's a great one. "
"1320860","1325040"," Accounts pulling up is saying that they think they're going to try to pen us the 3700 on ES."
"1327740","1328900"," They could try to pen us."
"1329000","1330740"," It doesn't really matter typically on days like today. "
"1331400","1339940"," For me at least for days like today, if they do pen us, what I'll do is let's say they"
"1339940","1340520"," pen us today."
"1340740","1341660"," Let me scroll over here."
"1342040","1343500"," Say pen us this vicinity. "
"1344880","1347600"," Oftentimes what happens in these times, right?"
"1347780","1352980"," You might see some weakness, but what happens here, right, is you can paper trade this."
"1354380","1364160"," You could buy like a call and you're, let's say you brought it at, I don't know, a"
"1364160","1366720"," dollar and then it goes all the way down like 25 cents or something."
"1367480","1372560"," And then like that last few minutes, the last 15 minutes, they'll fucking run it straight to the"
"1372560","1372760"," moon. "
"1373380","1377000"," And you'd be like, Oh shit, I bought it at a dollar, went 25 cents."
"1377300","1383380"," Then I fucking this shit went to three dollars the last 15 minutes, not always, but oftentimes"
"1383380","1386080"," you'll see something like that craziness happened."
"1386080","1395200"," And that's what a accounts in this 370 into or 3700 into the bell. "
"1395600","1400140"," The thing that I would say on that still though, is as soon as that put gamma rolls off, whenever"
"1400140","1402600"," it rolls off today, there's nothing they can do about it."
"1402720","1403620"," They don't have a fucking choice."
"1404460","1413210"," The only thing that would stop that that gamma from dealers pushing, pushing us higher into the"
"1413210","1417450"," bell would be like 50 billion in put hedging. "
"1417450","1426110"," Some stupid, not 50 billion, like 25 billion, something insane in put hedging, like just rolling"
"1426110","1432310"," waterfall cascading puts is the only thing that's going to stop this thing from squeezing."
"1432630","1440890"," Now, does that, does that squeeze get not just Vanna, but the the charm, the charm trade?"
"1441190","1441930"," Probably not."
"1441930","1442610"," It'll be subdued. "
"1443430","1447350"," So it's not like our expectations are, yeah, we're going to the fucking moon."
"1448250","1453590"," But as you can see right now, have you, if you bought puts today, they're just burning."
"1454710","1456430"," And not only are they burning, I'm watching them right now. "
"1456590","1460610"," I'm actually watching the put side of this market right now burn up."
"1460790","1465510"," You guys watch like the put the premium on puts right now across the market."
"1465990","1467570"," They're getting smoked right now. "
"1468230","1473130"," So now you're seeing the premium kill on the put side of this market right now."
"1481320","1483660"," Yeah, so let's talk about, let's talk about stops real quick."
"1483780","1484400"," Somebody's mentioning it. "
"1484500","1487780"," So let's say, let's do it."
"1487960","1488260"," Let's do it."
"1488300","1489360"," So watch my cursor over here. "
"1489540","1493760"," So let's say, you know, I'll do it."
"1493840","1495420"," Oh, I'll bring it up over here."
"1498180","1498840"," Give me a second here. "
"1499640","1501600"," Let's talk about stops and that kind of stuff."
"1501960","1510370"," So, let's say, see you bought."
"1513590","1514950"," We have, let's go to one minute. "
"1518720","1519580"," So one minute chart."
"1521460","1521640"," Okay."
"1523020","1524100"," So see this right here. "
"1525320","1527480"," As a matter of fact, I took this trade earlier today."
"1527540","1533420"," So let's say, see you buy this for a rip, right?"
"1533660","1535020"," You get the bull flag forming up."
"1535220","1540980"," We break through and down here you have, you know, two more places to buy a dip down here. "
"1542460","1543900"," But that's not, that's a consequence."
"1544140","1545720"," Let's say you didn't buy that dip, right?"
"1546500","1548200"," The trade starts to come back in your favor."
"1548980","1554320"," You already know that the trade normally they'll stop it below the last one, right?"
"1554560","1555560"," To kill you. "
"1556220","1557840"," But let's say you wanted to get out in here."
"1558160","1560980"," So let's say you diamond handed, we're starting to make our way higher now, right?"
"1561120","1562080"," Series of higher highs."
"1562820","1567980"," So what you can do is let's say you just want to save your trade and you're like, ah, I"
"1567980","1568360"," miss time. "
"1568360","1569560"," My traders want my money back."
"1570300","1572240"," So, and you, you took the trade here."
"1573540","1575720"," So as a recovering, we're coming up, right?"
"1576860","1580000"," You would go in and do a stop limit on the options you were in. "
"1580440","1583860"," And let's say you move them to right here, right?"
"1584100","1584880"," We start to trade up here."
"1584940","1587160"," We still haven't broken that stop limit, right?"
"1587560","1590240"," Still haven't broken that stop limit that's down here, right?"
"1590420","1593120"," You didn't get a fishing expedition, right?"
"1593220","1595800"," And we start to trade above that previous high right here."
"1596480","1597960"," You'd move your stops right here. "
"1598720","1600940"," And you see, manually go in and move your stops."
"1601260","1602800"," Now we break that, right?"
"1603380","1606260"," Boom, you would have at least captured this part of the move right here."
"1607040","1609560"," Okay, probably close to break even. "
"1611160","1615700"," Now you're going to be looking for this previous low over here, and you can see that we didn't"
"1615700","1616780"," break that previous low."
"1616920","1618060"," We had an accumulation phase."
"1618280","1620780"," There was a little bit of scary right here with the fix, right?"
"1621120","1626400"," Was telling us we could, whether it was, it was, uh, a fix was looking like it was going to"
"1626400","1627840"," go up, but it didn't, right?"
"1628260","1628880"," It didn't. "
"1629180","1631280"," And you know where your previous stops are."
"1631440","1635620"," You could take a long in here and have down below here a stop."
"1636180","1638140"," Now that stop wouldn't have been broken, right?"
"1638680","1639200"," And what do we do?"
"1639340","1640260"," We traded up higher. "
"1640520","1643460"," So now you would have been close to breaking even from over here."
"1643700","1645320"," Let's say you were down at that bad trade."
"1645780","1647460"," Let's say you were down like 20, 30%. "
"1647460","1650240"," On this move higher, you would have made that back and profit."
"1650620","1651060"," Does that make sense?"
"1651860","1653440"," So now that you're up here, right?"
"1654000","1655700"," Now that you're up here, where's your next stop?"
"1655860","1657800"," Let's say you stayed in this trade, right?"
"1658340","1659100"," And it starts to roll over."
"1659220","1660360"," You're already watching book map. "
"1660520","1661840"," You know, there's resistance here."
"1662120","1662760"," You already knew that."
"1662800","1666140"," You're like, well, I want to put a stop and you already know where to put that stops right there. "
"1667060","1668260"," So you should be stopped out."
"1668540","1673520"," Some of you probably got in down below here and like me, where am I going to put my stop?"
"1673760","1676180"," Well, my stop is going to be somewhere down in here, right?"
"1677120","1678800"," Because where my stop is down below."
"1679580","1684420"," If you're looking to buy a dip, you're probably looking for a bounce somewhere down here for a"
"1684420","1686540"," bounce, excuse me, I'm not fucking at all up now. "
"1687260","1692140"," You're looking for a bounce somewhere here for the next run up."
"1693360","1697560"," Maybe you get that out of range trade is there right?"
"1699100","1701000"," So you're like, I want to put some risk on say cap."
"1701260","1706620"," There's A, there's B and there's C down here, right?"
"1706840","1708720"," You already know about this previous level of support. "
"1709100","1710680"," This is the seedier trade."
"1710900","1713860"," So if we do fail, we make another leg up, right?"
"1714160","1714480"," Time of the day."
"1714580","1715460"," What time of day is it?"
"1715760","1717980"," Everybody at lunch right now and that kind of stuff. "
"1718020","1719500"," So A, D, C, right?"
"1719780","1723780"," And let's say you, let's say you, let's say you get a fake bounce here and you're like, got to"
"1723780","1725500"," weak ass bounce, right?"
"1725700","1732780"," By, by, by averaging into this trade and, and identifying it was a pre week ass V, V shape bounce,"
"1733080","1738820"," you would at least probably make back all of your trade to even that you could exit it before we"
"1738820","1740040"," actually make the next leg below."
"1740720","1742420"," If that helps, I don't know if that helps you guys."
"1742740","1745580"," Some of you guys that have been trading long enough, notice this stuff, some of you guys don't"
"1745580","1747820"," repeat this every day that I'm on trading with. "
"1748040","1749420"," I think we talked about this last time I trade."
"1749580","1752300"," We'll talk about this in day trading every single day that we trade."
"1752900","1756540"," So you can see how to, how to be successful as a trader. "
"1758100","1764460"," That's not exactly, and especially if it doesn't go your way, how to save your ass, if the trade"
"1764460","1765160"," doesn't go your way."
"1765360","1769760"," And what you're looking for at the market reverses, we didn't talk about that in this, in this"
"1769760","1772860"," little thing, but where do you look for reversals?"
"1773560","1775020"," We can do that real quick."
"1776300","1783560"," So if you're a bear and you're looking for reversals, you're going to be looking for what?"
"1784400","1788700"," You know you've got major support down here, you know that support's moved up to this area here at"
"1788700","1789700"," 363, right?"
"1790080","1792320"," You know, this has moved up at this point, right?"
"1793140","1796440"," And you know that down below at 358 is where the next level of support is. "
"1796600","1800740"," So if you're a bear, this is risky, right?"
"1800880","1801660"," A risky trade down."
"1802140","1804380"," You can see we're getting some rejection there and that's right."
"1804500","1806580"," If you're a bear, you're like, well, I want to see this, oh, sorry. "
"1807420","1808860"," I want to see this break in here."
"1811700","1812960"," You don't care about any of this."
"1813180","1814100"," You don't care about any of this. "
"1815180","1818060"," You want to see this break rejected, and then that move lower."
"1819100","1820600"," This is where the money is, is a bear."
"1820900","1824000"," You've even noticed you take a put, if you don't take, if you take the put and you're like, yeah,"
"1824080","1828320"," I made money, I made like 10% or 5%, but I didn't make big money on it. "
"1828580","1833680"," You usually make more money on call side on small rips, then you do on put side."
"1833980","1837540"," If you want to make serious money in put side, you got to see major breaks and then that like"
"1837540","1837820"," lower."
"1838400","1841920"," You want to see like that break of support and then a rejection and a move lower. "
"1842040","1843160"," That's where you make money in puts."
"1843900","1847340"," Puts are not designed to make you money here."
"1847740","1849760"," They're not designed for you to make money in this move. "
"1850760","1852120"," Anyone tells you that's the case."
"1852340","1853560"," It's not, it's not real."
"1853700","1853900"," It's fake. "
"1854620","1859000"," Normally you'll get that move for like a few seconds and then a quick move up and it erases"
"1859000","1859880"," anything that you had."
"1860280","1863960"," If you're a bear in your bear trader, you want to be looking for like major levels of support"
"1863960","1866120"," break, rejection, and then a couple legs down."
"1866600","1870720"," And even when you're making those major legs down, as a bear, you got to take the money off at"
"1870720","1875860"," each leg, take the next leg, and then you make you actually make it money as a bear that way. "
"1877340","1882520"," There's some other places too like double tops that can be good for bears, but even then you want"
"1882520","1882860"," confirmation."
"1883320","1885460"," You don't want to get help getting squeezed out, right?"
"1885960","1888680"," That's a double top cap, then you still want to have some rejection."
"1889840","1891620"," Let's say you're going to do one of these moves up here. "
"1892040","1896960"," You're saying, hey cap, here's our one top and we're going to get our second top at some point."
"1897120","1899820"," It's going to double top and then we're going to we're going to crash it down, right?"
"1900500","1902020"," You still need to have some confirmation."
"1902640","1907080"," So you're going to want to see that double top and then you're going to want to see bam. "
"1907360","1908780"," Might even come over a little bit."
"1909040","1909740"," Start to peter out."
"1909740","1910820"," This is distribution. "
"1911800","1914180"," Then you want to see that move and then you take that."
"1914520","1915580"," You wait for that confirmation."
"1916400","1920280"," Otherwise you end up getting squeezed higher as a bear. "
"1920520","1921540"," That's the bear trade."
"1921720","1922820"," For me at least, my trade is a bear."
"1923300","1924360"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"1924720","1931120"," And if I missed that first initial roll over top and I didn't capture all of it as a bear,"
"1931620","1933420"," I don't need the entire trade as a bear."
"1934880","1936000"," The entire trade."
"1936180","1939060"," I need the large big portion of that trade. "
"1940640","1943460"," And usually in a bear trade like that, you'll get two or three legs down."
"1943660","1944560"," It's not usually just one."
"1945300","1949620"," That first rollover, that confirmation, you'll still get usually two solid legs out of that"
"1949620","1951100"," rollover in the market. "
"1959440","1965300"," For the European energy markets, Italy government says that they will not get all the Russian gas"
"1965300","1967860"," supply they requested for June 18th."
"1967960","1974080"," What are you guys talking about here?"
"1974300","1974960"," I got a lower two."
"1975540","1977240"," I sold a few of my three 70s for the dollar five. "
"1977440","1978580"," Just to get rid of the worst ones above."
"1978760","1979240"," Neither that."
"1979480","1984160"," Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Draghi said that Italian gas stocks are at 52%. "
"1985540","1986920"," I was about to speak in Tennessee."
"1987380","1988900"," It's the back of Kennedy voters."
"1988900","1993200"," I'm pretty sure he's about to be arrested so he may want to lay low. "
"1995460","1997580"," Yeah, he probably wants to do on vacation somewhere nice."
"2000060","2002840"," I would be surprised if he gets arrested."
"2003460","2008400"," They have this like unsaid thing where they say they're going after presidents, but this is an"
"2008400","2013280"," unsaid thing where it's a pretty big note. "
"2013760","2018300"," Italian government will not get all the Russian gas supply, which was requested on June 18th."
"2018960","2021180"," That impact UGA and UNG."
"2021880","2022420"," Thank you. "
"2024400","2025300"," Thanks for the list."
"2025420","2025980"," I appreciate it."
"2026920","2027640"," Thank you. "
"2027820","2028580"," Thank you in turn."
"2029460","2031600"," Happy summer vacation helping daddy out."
"2033680","2040560"," I was asking my daughter to generate a list of people that have financially supported this channel"
"2040560","2045760"," so that we can have a little bit of a thank you to supporters. "
"2048719","2051780"," I was talking to Joe Donut on the phone and my phone died."
"2052900","2053960"," My new iPhone."
"2054600","2055600"," I have a problem with that too. "
"2055840","2062000"," If any of you guys have my real phone number out there and I haven't contacted you, it's because I"
"2062000","2071620"," went from an android to an apple and it didn't transfer all of my contacts over."
"2072179","2072699"," Long story."
"2073960","2079540"," So, okay, we've got some support down below here at 36577. "
"2079800","2080920"," Next leg down would be 363."
"2081840","2082900"," So we're looking for a buy zone."
"2083340","2087780"," If you're looking for a buy zone, you're looking for a VWAP or slightly below VWAP. "
"2087960","2091060"," You're also looking for 36318 if you want to take another trade higher."
"2092040","2093300"," So that's why we're expected to happen."
"2095219","2102740"," The other thing to take note of though here is I'm watching the VIX right now and the VIX, you"
"2102740","2106760"," know, when I'm looking at the VIX on the daily chart right now, it looks like it could squeeze"
"2106760","2112420"," higher here for end of the day, but at the same time, it really does look like it's getting pretty"
"2112420","2112920"," weak here. "
"2113400","2114440"," We're going to have some capitulation."
"2115180","2123220"," I also want you to know that the HFTs, the robot, the robots just switched from 360p on June 17th"
"2123220","2124460"," to 370c."
"2125060","2131040"," 240,000 calls just came in on 370c at 48 cents on the spot. "
"2132740","2134320"," So a bunch of spy buyers here."
"2135080","2138560"," They're looking for that bull flag trade higher right where we are right now."
"2138640","2139440"," Just heads up on that. "
"2140900","2142440"," Okay, so we're going to get into it."
"2143220","2144680"," It's 139 in the afternoon."
"2145360","2147780"," We'll get into the power time around 3pm. "
"2149560","2155200"," First, I want to say thank you to like your wife's boyfriend, Quinn invests, Winky."
"2155720","2156800"," He's also known as RedFi."
"2157700","2161660"," I want to say thanks to anyone out there that's been a long time friend like Brad. "
"2162440","2163580"," Like I've got it."
"2163840","2165300"," There's a ton of you guys out there."
"2165960","2171460"," I got a friend up in Montana that I want to thank my attorney too. "
"2171480","2180900"," Like anybody out there that has fallen along like Tesla Wolf, Eric Hagar, the"
"2180900","2191040"," agent bubblegum, Chaz Wilson, of all plateau at today, Marcus, Brad, another badass, counts"
"2191040","2197780"," blown up, sonova, little SpaceX, just some gangsters that are out there."
"2197940","2205440"," Chantu, Kristoff, Kristoff, or Baba, figuring out money, of course, markets in mayhem, Von Der"

"2214820","2215480"," friends. "
"2216380","2219020"," Okay, so supporters of the channel."
"2219560","2229280"," I want to give some shout outs to Jorgen to Ben Jose, Matthew Anthony James, Jordan Ben, Benjamin"
"2229280","2237880"," Godfrey, Brad, Tom Pomecheco, Keith Bean, Brad, Bonnie Douglas, Cody."
"2239100","2239880"," Who else?"
"2240140","2241680"," This is going back like a month and a half, I think. "
"2242160","2251680"," Jason William Dredan Breslin, Tomás G, Samuel U, Jordan S, TKN, Henry A, Jason F,"
"2252040","2257700"," Jacobus, Nick P, Kevin M, Standard Mobile Company, whoever you are."
"2258240","2259800"," I might be me paying a bill."
"2260580","2261780"," My wife, somebody's stealing money. "
"2262260","2272240"," Danielle, Catherine, Dustin Bailey, Joshua K, Bart O, Jessica G, Jordan S, pro"
"2272240","2273380"," rollers, whoever you are."

"2282260","2288500"," Beatty, Chris S, Kelly S, David G, pro rollers, right on, my brother."
"2289540","2293100"," Uh, so I want to say thanks, maybe that's helped support to keep this channel live. "
"2293260","2296840"," He helps keep Twitter live as well, putting this information out there for you guys."
"2297660","2300060"," Uh, and I've got a whiskey here, a bourbon."
"2300680","2301840"," So I'm going to do a toast with you guys. "
"2301840","2305660"," This is like, you guys bought me a drink, a beer, uh, bourbon or whatever."
"2305920","2307160"," I want to say thanks to all the support."
"2307780","2310520"," Uh, please click on that like and subscribe button. "
"2310540","2311960"," I want to say thanks to all you guys out there."
"2312300","2313700"," I know you guys don't always agree with me."
"2313760","2315260"," You know, sometimes I rub some of you the wrong way. "
"2315360","2316200"," I apologize for that."
"2316960","2320080"," Um, as long as you guys keep it, you guys can always fuck with me."
"2321220","2322860"," Uh, I'm fine with that. "
"2323620","2324660"," Well, you guys can disagree with me."
"2324740","2325920"," You guys can fade me whenever you want."
"2326660","2329900"," Uh, so those calls are now up to 57 cents. "
"2330100","2331060"," They're at 46 cents."
"2331180","2332280"," So now up to 55 cents."
"2332660","2333360"," Just heads up. "
"2333480","2335840"," We got dip buyers in the house on 370 C."
"2336780","2339040"," I just want to say thanks to all of you guys out there for sticking by me."
"2339900","2342800"," Uh, I don't care if like, you know, it's weird."
"2342940","2348680"," Like, uh, I'm out there trying to be like two million followers with blonde hair and some flashy"
"2348680","2349580"," background shit. "
"2349860","2351560"," And I'm not looking for churn."
"2352100","2354900"," I'm not looking for like, you know, a million fucking followers."
"2355540","2360640"," I could have two followers to give me and Joe Donut and like Chaz hanging out and fucking off and"
"2360640","2365960"," sailing, giving me and you RS hanging out here all day long, me and trading five hanging out all"
"2365960","2366360"," year long. "
"2367080","2369040"," Uh, Ergo and I just hanging out here all day long."
"2369040","2369740"," I'm going to be fine with that."
"2369840","2370840"," It's five of you watching me. "
"2371340","2372520"," We'd do that together alone."
"2372520","2377380"," So I care about the friendship and the, and the where we go, then anything else."
"2377680","2378960"," And I want you guys to know that's true. "
"2379100","2380640"," That's part of living life, right?"
"2380900","2384720"," We're all here living our lives and, uh, so I wouldn't want you to know them."
"2384780","2388320"," Very grateful to you all out there."
"2389360","2390740"," Uh, here we go, right?"
"2391100","2394260"," Looking at that nice little bull flag down below, trying to trade, take a trade at higher. "
"2394460","2396700"," We got a little resistance here at three 69 above."
"2397340","2398900"," Three 69 is right up here."
"2399000","2400420"," We'll lower this down a little bit. "
"2400640","2403160"," Three 69 can change."
"2403580","2404600"," See if we can squeeze higher."
"2404780","2405620"," I think we're going to squeeze higher. "
"2405640","2406280"," I'll be honest with you."
"2407520","2408780"," I think we're going to squeeze higher here."
"2408860","2410720"," Unless this is an HF key that's just in for a second. "
"2411260","2412440"," I think we're going to get that squeeze now."
"2412520","2413880"," I think we're about, about due for it."
"2414200","2415360"," I love all you guys out there. "
"2416020","2417320"," Jay Rowan, my man."
"2418200","2419300"," I should have brought you up, Jay."
"2420400","2421260"," Pinky, my man. "
"2421880","2422800"," There's a bunch of you in there."
"2423260","2425020"," I should, there's a bunch of others of you in here too."
"2425760","2427680"," Uh, we got Mary out there, Garris. "
"2427800","2429040"," Mary Garrison's out there somewhere."
"2430380","2431640"," I get a bunch of different people."
"2431840","2433240"," Evan, good to see you. "
"2434660","2436380"," Uh, I love all you guys out there."
"2437400","2439660"," There's a, there's a long list of fucking names."
"2439820","2442220"," There's probably like 500 names that I have to actually go over. "
"2442800","2445500"," At least 500 names, hardcore friends."
"2445800","2447940"," Like, if I follow you, you follow me."
"2448060","2448980"," I follow you on Twitter too. "
"2450500","2451820"," Pinky's like, I just want that 360."
"2453160","2453780"," Right on."
"2453980","2453980"," Yeah. "
"2456360","2459240"," So right up here, we got, let's look at this real close level."
"2459240","2464780"," We got 369.08, 369.40. Uh, but I'll be honest with you, this looks like a squeeze."
"2465100","2468780"," I'm going to give, tell you, I think it's a squeeze because, uh, there we're going, I think we're"
"2468780","2473660"," going to squeeze the 370.93. And the reason I'm saying that to you, there's some resistance up"
"2473660","2473860"," here. "
"2474360","2477640"," Uh, but I want to, I'm saying it because the HF keys are on this trade."
"2478960","2480440"," You got robots on this trade."
"2480740","2483460"," Maybe there's some news going to come out in five or 10 minutes. "
"2486160","2487140"," Something's going on in the background."
"2487320","2487940"," I don't know what it is."
"2490330","2491630"," I don't know why they're holding it up. "
"2494090","2497530"," Backed out or not backed on quite to the initial stop."
"2497850","2500030"," But, uh, the calls are down to 54 cents."
"2500230","2502310"," They got in at 48 cents or so. "
"2502750","2507450"," Just note on your, if you're trading this, just note that they're out there in at 48 cents."
"2507630","2522880"," I think it dropped to 46 after they got in, but I think they're"
"2522880","2526840"," in the, uh, Wednesday calls on a low here."
"2527560","2533480"," Uh, you could possibly, you could, at some point today, we're more than likely going to retest 362. "
"2533820","2535600"," Uh, let me, let's look at another retest."
"2535840","2537040"," Where else could we retest today?"
"2537080","2537700"," That's a good question."
"2538880","2540520"," Uh, let me take a peek over here. "
"2542240","2543740"," It's a very fair question."
"2544580","2546000"," Uh, and I haven't thought about it today."
"2548460","2550400"," We're going to retest a low today. "
"2551080","2557240"," Uh, maybe 360, 68 could get a retest."
"2557340","2563000"," I doubt we go there, but there could be a possibility of one last slap down to 360."
"2563760","2568960"," If you were looking for like a trade for next week, uh, I would be patient and hope that we"
"2568960","2570820"," can get a trade down to 360. "
"2571720","2575300"," Um, if you're like, I don't want to wait for that trade."
"2575720","2581340"," If we don't retest 360, I would look for a retest of 362, 17 or so right around there."
"2581940","2588700"," Um, so that you would, you'd want to at least retest this 362 and I haven't looked to see what"
"2588700","2589980"," the low was in the overnight yet. "
"2589980","2594120"," I haven't, I should look deeper into this, but I haven't to be honest with you."
"2595180","2596980"," The low is, I don't think the low is that high."
"2598100","2600260"," I think we had a low that was actually that low. "
"2600580","2604760"," So, uh, a few places of interest would be the previous low from yesterday."
"2604760","2613120"," I think it was 364 15 is one to take note of, uh, 360 to 17 and then 360 to"
"2613120","2619500"," 18 would be another place like three notable places to look into towards the end of day so that you"
"2619500","2620100"," could take a trade."
"2620860","2622560"," Yeah, they're still in those calls right now. "
"2622640","2624620"," Those 370 C's are down to 33 cents."
"2624800","2625420"," They're still in them."
"2625680","2627080"," They haven't gotten out of them yet. "
"2627480","2631020"," They're now up to 244,000 calls on 370 C."
"2633670","2635010"," Yeah, so they're still in them."
"2635250","2636110"," They're still watching them."
"2641590","2643950"," Matter of fact, I might buy some calls here again. "
"2654590","2656670"," Yeah, we, and we squeezed right higher again."
"2656710","2657170"," We're back to third."
"2657390","2657990"," So I'm, hold on. "
"2661330","2664110"," So I'm in at 38 cents right now."
"2665750","2669790"," So I'm in 370 C's for 38 cents on calls."
"2670350","2674170"," If they get like 50, 60 cents, once more, I'll put a stop-loss on them. "
"2676200","2682920"," If we start to break down this, if we start to break down from this, if we break this consolidation"
"2682920","2687040"," right here, I'll be looking to get out of those calls somewhere down in here."
"2687800","2688900"," I'll sell them below here."
"2689800","2692140"," So if any of you are in calls right now, I'm in some calls. "
"2697380","2698600"," So we'll see what happens here."
"2709630","2711250"," Now I'm starting to sweat pull up again."
"2712270","2713590"," I'm starting to start now. "
"2713590","2715810"," Every time in every time I'm in a trade, I'm always panicky."
"2720370","2722490"," I always say, you got to trade them with no emotion."
"2722830","2726030"," I try that, but it's not easy. "
"2730240","2731100"," Yeah, right there."
"2731220","2733940"," We'll see if this, we'll see if this cross holds or not."
"2738200","2740120"," Some of you guys are called a golden cross. "
"2740440","2741880"," Some of you guys are called a death cross."
"2742520","2744060"," So I just put a cross on there for you."
"2744120","2745580"," We'll see if this cross is over or not. "
"2747780","2749140"," We don't want it to cross over."
"2749420","2750040"," I don't know if you know that."
"2750120","2752040"," I'll bring the ticket that I just cursed over here. "
"2752040","2753360"," You don't want to see a cross down below."
"2754520","2756940"," And you definitely don't want to see a break of this."
"2757360","2762680"," So if you watch my curse over here, you want to see this fail and roll and break through this"
"2762680","2763380"," cross and down. "
"2763960","2766100"," If it breaks this part of the cross, it spells death."
"2768200","2770400"," Say a simple basic trading rules."
"2771400","2773000"," You see that it didn't break here, right?"
"2774980","2777060"," Looking for that same kind of a move up here. "
"2779770","2781350"," Calls an hour up to 45 cents."
"2782150","2785250"," I'm going to wait to put a stop on it until it breaks above 50 to 60 cents."
"2786470","2791510"," I'd really like to at least capture 50 or 60 cents or 65 cents or so in the trade. "
"2797170","2798470"," Making us some money here."
"2801780","2802360"," There we go."
"2802360","2804660"," We're up now up to 48 cents, 49 cents. "
"2808500","2810680"," It's already a 20% winner or so."
"2814810","2816830"," That's 20%, 20% trade right now."
"2821080","2823740"," Just on that one dip, that was 20%, 20% trade. "
"2824700","2827800"," If we get 50 cents, I'll put another stop on it up here."
"2831430","2833170"," From the free trade every day."
"2846040","2847620"," See if we can break through here or not. "
"2849300","2854040"," We do have some, we do have some resistance fading above, which is good to see."
"2854800","2856100"," Price target right now, 371."
"2859060","2860680"," See if we can see if we can see. "
"2864990","2866990"," We can do a nice little break above here."
"2867490","2872810"," Winkie's looking for 369.69. At least by 420 in the afternoon."
"2877000","2878080"," Come up to the end of the day. "
"2878160","2878380"," It's 151."
"2878900","2879780"," We've got two hours left."
"2880620","2882060"," We know we usually get some pretty decent moves. "
"2882800","2885440"," Days like so, get some fairs action here."
"2885960","2895850"," I do want to warn you that it is, if you don't already know it is quad witching, you can"
"2895850","2899750"," see some violent moves take place as we head into the clothes today."
"2900730","2905230"," The only thing I would say to you on days like OPEC's days today is if you do see a"
"2905230","2912050"," violent move, if you see anything move like this up and down that let's say you get caught in a"
"2912050","2917390"," put or you get caught in a call that you would not sell it but add that bottom if it"
"2917390","2924730"," happens so that you don't get what you watch my cursor. "
"2924730","2929850"," Let's just say we fail down here and bloodbath it down to 360 or whatever."
"2930170","2931090"," Give me a second here."

"2957670","2962330"," So I do want you to be aware as we head into the clothes."
"2962510","2969010"," A couple of things I want you to know here is that they'll try to kill options in here as"

"2972120","2977460"," Sometimes there's a pin because they've got long they've got long puts or long calls that they've"
"2977460","2982100"," held for months and months and months so it could go sideways but oftentimes in quad witching"
"2982100","2984640"," sometimes you'll see some really wild movements. "
"2985300","2992840"," Not so much in spy typically in in specific tickers so you might see a you might see like a"
"2992840","3001560"," Tesla let's say drop 70 points then climb 90 points you might see kind of kind of craziness like"

"3034820","3040240"," little bit and you'll see fast movements."
"3040240","3046440"," If you see those fast movements typically if let's say you rocket ship down you'll grab that bottom"
"3046440","3050240"," rather than just cutting your calls and then you'll see a rocket ship back up and you're kind of"
"3050240","3050960"," cursing yourself. "
"3052220","3055100"," Sometimes you'll see us rocket ship up right."
"3055260","3060720"," You'll see us grind really or you'll see a ticker go to the moon and you'll think oh yeah it's"
"3060720","3064020"," a good time to buy a call probably not it's probably a good time to buy a put as we"

"3080560","3080780"," clothes."
"3081420","3086720"," You should also start to be considering wanting to buy like I think I figured who was that said"
"3086720","3092680"," something above but they're any good trades they asked they're any good it was who asked that"
"3092680","3102530"," question it was forgot who asked that question above here but are there any good trades in the"
"3102530","3102930"," next week?"
"3103550","3107730"," My best trades are for next week are always spreads. "
"3107970","3113070"," These are the best on a long weekend spreads that your fucking friend I tell you what they're your"
"3113070","3117990"," fucking friend so if you're looking for like a trade for next week if you can't buy a spread then"
"3117990","3124150"," I would say get some time on some calls like one to three weeks minimum so that you can at"
"3124150","3129690"," least not get theta burned over the weekend and still capture of a trade higher so if we don't"
"3129690","3136250"," capture that that put gamma squeeze over the weekend or today in the bell if it comes over the"
"3136250","3142850"," weekend you just don't want to deal with theta right you want to deal with opening up 50 points 70"
"3142850","3149670"," points 100 points take your money on the opening bell on Tuesday and walk away make yourself a"
"3149670","3155070"," mojito and you know find a man or woman to to want to date with or something."
"3158140","3165840"," I'd say a best of TikTok right out of tibro yeah so if you so yeah so that's what you"

"3174980","3182240"," trade I can talk you through it talk you through a credit spread talk through a debit spread if you"
"3182240","3189220"," want it to because you can just manually take those trades do those trades if you don't know how to"
"3189220","3195440"," do spreads of any kind I always recommend to people to start out at least doing them on like"
"3195440","3200660"," options AI I think it's options.ai I think it's called options.ai I think is the name of the"
"3200660","3208060"," site or it's options.ai.com you can actually quickly just get a feel for spreads and they'll place"
"3208060","3214520"," the trades for you it's like an intro to spreads they give you basic butterflies and basic condors"
"3214520","3222780"," and basic debit spreads and credit spreads at least gives you the structure and the confidence the"
"3222780","3227280"," only problem with them is you can't cut legs off but if you're like if you're just buying calls and"
"3227280","3234400"," buying puts it's a great entry it's like the Robin Hood of spreads so there we go we're trading"
"3234400","3240540"," higher we're now at 61 cents this is not this right now but start to put a limit sell on"
"3240540","3246920"," your spreads bring it to like 55 or 50 cents or 60 cents I think 60 is a little low"
"3246920","3253200"," so I'm gonna put some I'm gonna put a limit on on my my calls right now and these are"
"3253200","3265450"," just like zero dates you know you're second here so"

"3319670","3323590"," if I tag out of this trade I'll look for another entry a little bit lower if I can get"
"3323590","3329330"," it again at like 48 cents or 30 cents yep as I just triggered now I'm down to now now"

"3857100","3863200"," if it does right there's a better buy down below here we'll leave this we'll extend this this would"
"3863200","3867320"," be where you're looking for to really buy a dip and then these two lines right here this is let"
"3867320","3873360"," me see if i can uh this is like intraday vault figures right here uh it's it's all it's all"
"3873360","3882260"," moving as we go along the day like an intraday vault figure there's your s1 somewhere right here"

"3887640","3892380"," your these put your vault to trigger down here just make it like this make it easy it's not real"
"3892380","3896600"," but uh the point would be that if we do break down you want to be able to catch a"
"3896600","3903900"," dip here uh this this is the real like this is volatility in here and then uh if i do"
"3903900","3911280"," like this you want to see if it breaks down you want to see you know a trade higher like"
"3911280","3921360"," that if uh it doesn't your next place would be right here to buy to go up for"

"3944750","3954240"," get rid of this one but i'm still long right now if you work to see see we break down"
"3954240","3962260"," here right when you start grinding in here kind of nonsense it's really that cool either right"
"3962260","3967480"," that's going to show you distribution right look for rejection you take that take that short that"
"3967480","3974100"," short low that's that's horrible look at that it's like the worst where's the drawing i could ever"
"3974100","3982160"," give still long here still some nice support in here this is another setup for a roll what you guys"
"3982160","3987140"," if you're a bull uh this is setting up for roll we could squeeze here too i'm long right now"
"3987140","3992600"," i'm back to almost even where i'm at even right now um and i think we are going higher here"
"3992600","3997500"," i think we're going i think i think the move is higher um and i think the move is the"
"3997500","4005160"," 371 there is some resistance here at 369 there's some volatility as well 368 29 if if this"
"4005160","4010280"," volatility if this resistance is too much though it will roll it down until we find some support"
"4010280","4020260"," some of the key levels are 366 uh 366 89 another one would be 366 04 and"
"4020260","4026100"," then down here at WTI crew futures holding you're the lows of the day with about 20 minutes to go"
"4026100","4033140"," to the close we've given back about 7 percent today alone in WTI crewed 105 76 intraday rail"

"4076650","4083950"," to know my my take on energy i think you're safest well i don't know the best trade right now"
"4083950","4092930"," in energy is probably the the the energy refineries and producers to an extent uh probably your"
"4092930","4098149"," best trade like the most confident trade you're sick you're most your best paying trade is more"
"4098149","4105250"," than likely going to be gas until the war ends uh there should be no like if you want to"
"4105250","4113370"," bottom the buy with danger and risk exposure probably gas uh oil trade will usually traditionally"
"4113370","4119630"," end sometime around now like mid june mid-july the oil trade itself usually ends and and they get"
"4119630","4125069"," and then they pull it back for a winter trade now i know we've still got like the the oil"
"4125069","4131370"," shortages and all that kind of stuff i like the xle trade still but i think that uh just looking"
"4131370","4138609"," at a year now you're looking for a decent dip to buy and also xle was showing some real uh"
"4138609","4146050"," exa i'll bring xlea so like xle was showing some real um break of here we go baby push it"

"4168430","4176710"," lee and we'll go just we'll quickly we'll click quickly uh looks like we're get some we'll see"
"4176710","4183069"," we'll see we're gonna go for some support lower we're gonna quickly look uh we're just briefly look"
"4183069","4190510"," at xle and see this area right in here like this whole area this is kind of like uh accumulation"
"4190510","4200010"," right push up accumulation leg higher right this is distribution right took the money and ran and"
"4200010","4205350"," now it looks like they're gonna do this kind of a thing and then leg it down right but you've"
"4205350","4211330"," got more distribution or more accumulation here in this zone and what i would really what i really"
"4211330","4216290"," like to see here is i don't think we're going down here fifty bucks but it would be nice to"
"4216290","4223170"," see us like uh maybe in a low trade to 60 bucks i don't think we get that deep at"
"4223170","4229950"," like 60 65 something like that would be nice to see on xle and it's more about greed than anything"
"4231010","4235690"," i don't know that we get that low this is a good place to buy a dip on xle right"
"4235690","4241970"," now believe it or not i think it's a good place to buy a dip on xle but there's three"
"4241970","4251390"," places to buy a dip on xle you just 50 all good places to add to an xle um"
"4251390","4260450"," an xle bet uh so if you wanted to buy xle or buy into gas energy if you think the"
"4260450","4267030"," trade is over uh it's probably not over um it's probably going to be the safest investment that you"
"4267030","4271910"," could have going into end of year but it's probably going"
"4271910","4281570"," to be weak and it'll take some time to accumulate people to accumulate"

"6132080","6137260"," we're getting this i don't we might trade up here so anything is possible we could trade up here"
"6137260","6143240"," and close the quarter green it's actually more bearish uh if we do close the quarter green for the"
"6143240","6148340"," for july in august it's more bearish we want to close the quarter red if you're a bull believe it"

"6154640","6159520"," for july you want to see like uh we want to see a failure for q2 you want to see"
"6159520","6167240"," q3 uh close slightly green from wherever we close uh q2 you just want to see it a little bit"
"6167240","6173800"," green but these are key levels and then uh for real if you're a bull uh these are your levels"
"6173800","6182640"," this is you're looking for like 380 that's less than that you don't want to see a failure right"
"6182640","6190120"," here let's call it 380 you don't want to see a failure at this one you want to see a"
"6190120","6196260"," sideways consolidation it's a nice round number then you want to see a sideways consolidation you"
"6196260","6202420"," would close all this shit up here i don't think you're getting this maybe you think we are but if"
"6202420","6208660"," we do now these are your levels and then you'd see a failure above here uh that's what you're"
"6208660","6214740"," looking for this this is generally speaking what you're looking for uh for upcoming if you're"
"6214740","6221200"," bullish here these are important levels key levels uh but truthfully i want to see where we close"
"6221200","6228960"," out the month of june like june 30th closing price is going to be critical and important uh to uh"
"6228960","6238340"," it's going to be critical and important to uh tracking what do i expect all right"
"6238340","6248340"," so it's going to be critical that the um the"
"6248340","6253860"," failure is just coming in cleaning out real quick uh uh hold on a second just coming in cleaning"
"6253860","6261420"," out options real quick i got to reset up another trade here i got to hold on a second i"
"6261420","6270860"," got to buy some shit uh so what you're really looking for as a trader as an investor hold on"

"6283280","6290580"," specific things you're looking to know what the closing price of this quarter is on the 30th you're"
"6290580","6296680"," looking to compare the two of those for q3 uh you're looking you're waiting for the jpm collar to"
"6296680","6304020"," come out you're looking for uh not to know what that collar is see what our range is right that's"
"6304020","6310300"," the tail wagging the dog right they don't like to lose money in this market how to give you your"
"6310300","6315540"," trading range you're going to expect if we close the month red though we're going to have a slight"
"6315540","6325040"," a green quarter q3 and then it'll start to sell off to be only slightly green heading into q4 and"
"6325040","6331440"," that lines up to the volatility that will come into the market for the elections uh you're going to"
"6331440","6336380"," see volatility in the elections and the crazy part about the volatility in the elections is uh you"
"6336380","6341560"," should go back and study midterm elections and even presidential elections but in particular"
"6341560","6347300"," midterm elections for how that volatility plays out because there's some really good trades in"
"6347300","6352880"," there on the bear and bull's side and it really doesn't matter they always drag out our passion"
"6352880","6357780"," like they'll bring our passion out they'll be like uh why didn't you sell the market because this"
"6357780","6363140"," happened it's because they pre-planned the entire fucking trade so our passion regardless of who's"
"6363140","6368440"," elected whether it's a republican or a democrats or it doesn't fucking matter the only thing they"
"6368440","6372900"," care about is that they're that the the senate can't change anything so that it's predictable for"
"6372900","6378520"," the banks and they care unless it's positive right or i guess if it's positive or negative they'll"
"6378520","6385300"," move the market but generally speaking you'll see these moves pre-planned and pre-traded starting"
"6385300","6392260"," now they'll trade this market on a lead-up and they'll trade this market for volatility in q3 now"
"6392260","6398140"," so start thinking like a bank right how's the bank going to look at this stuff heading into q3 q4"
"6398140","6404260"," i think i said q3 q2 but i mean three two four on top of all the other shit you"
"6404260","6410140"," have to know about that's going on the market like the yen in the fucking housing crisis and the"
"6410140","6418320"," oil crisis and the gas crisis and qt and when is qt going to rip the market apart pieces and"
"6418320","6423720"," all that other fucking nonsense uh so what would i do i think we're getting up to 400 probably"
"6423720","6428720"," fucking not i think you'll you'll be lucky right now i think you'd be lucky if we get to 380"
"6428720","6435700"," i think uh you'll be lucky i think there's going to be a lot of sideways trading sideways and down"
"6435700","6441580"," and then sideways and up into july and august and then you're going to see the next big moves down"
"6441580","6447480"," heading into election season but i could be wrong we have we talked this morning about headline"
"6447480","6453680"," risks and what those are the yen we talked about the housing mortgage how do you how do you trade"
"6453680","6461520"," trade against those those happening or trade to trade for those risks events those left tail risks"
"6462280","6469360"," you the only in in my view the my favorite way to trade those is with uh on a high"
"6469360","6477080"," buying put back spreads that are dated far out so get some otm uh ratio spreads that are dated one"
"6477080","6483240"," to three months out hold them throughout the entire one to three months until we have a break of"
"6483240","6492100"," the market uh so somewhere from here into 400 let's call it uh 370 to 400 look to be putting"
"6492100","6500980"," on a new round of uh put back spreads from now into june 30th uh just buy some they don't"
"6500980","6507020"," cost you anything you you buy them and they either break even or make you a little bit of money"
"6507020","6513900"," or they print fat for the next three months you'll get them at some point to print fat put them"
"6513900","6518580"," in a separate brokerage uh i tend to put those trades on a different brokerage i don't look at them"
"6518580","6524860"," day in day out i don't think about them i have got uh what do you call it's a email"
"6524860","6532660"," alert set on trading view for if we hit certain key levels that uh i get an email and a"
"6532660","6539360"," text message uh saying check your shit that's the best way to do it too if you're gonna i'm gonna"
"6539360","6545160"," buy some calls here so the best way to do it is you you set up like a trading view"
"6545160","6553800"," account pay for trading view uh you get sent alerts uh you do an entirely different chart and any"
"6553800","6558760"," of your hedging strategies i always separate them uh and then you do alerts to your phone or your"
"6558760","6564280"," email and if and when that they hit uh you then look at them and you just keep them out"
"6564280","6569640"," of sight out of mind don't think about your uh those trades you just you just don't think about"

"6634030","6639030"," here we got uh it's 254 six more minutes i'm gonna hope that we get a little bit of weakness"
"6639030","6644790"," into the three o'clock hour hopefully like 302 303 and then hopefully it's a buy side imbalance i'm"
"6644790","6650430"," gonna look for any kind of weakness from a hedging that comes out today if there is any hedging"
"6650430","6660100"," yeah i don't see any right now i don't see any uh BPT"
"6660100","6670720"," is a good trade i like that trade TQQ"

"6694640","6699860"," bit lower so you can see the of the bell uh it's another good time for you to think about"
"6699860","6704660"," into the bell if you're not any trades for next week this is a good place to be thinking about"
"6704660","6712500"," buying call spreads uh or debt or debt or uh not just uh call spreads put spreads call spreads um"
"6712500","6718520"," depending on your viewpoint into next week you should see some opportunity here heading it's shit"
"6718520","6724540"," dude i'm already losing my shit i missed the trade here set 48 cents was down to 38 cents 36"
"6724540","6729340"," cents i think at the worst i just missed the trade talking my ass off here i should have bought"
"6729340","6738940"," that dip uh so that was actually a big fucking trade right there so um think about some spreads"
"6738940","6742600"," into next week as we head into the bell sometimes i like to buy spreads after the bell like four"
"6742600","6748200"," o'clock to four fifteen if your brokerage allows it uh to try to fill a spread after the bell"
"6748760","6753480"," because sometimes you can get some weakness uh into the bell and get a really good price on on some"
"6753480","6767240"," spreads um i'll probably be placing a spread trade here into the bell myself and"
"6767240","6774820"," i'm open for a buy here at uh american airlines this was puts coming out 12 16 22 10 p"
"6775660","6789700"," half a million dollars american airlines let's look"

"6844830","6851650"," those puts i think that that by the guess that's a hedge i'm guessing that's a hedge on on uh"

"6931860","6941500"," 2020 it put a hedge on a 10 bucks so my assumption would be that's a hedge my assumption is"
"6941500","6945680"," that they're saying i'm going to take american airlines long that's the trade against oil believe"
"6945680","6952580"," it or not gas and what they're saying is uh it's a pretty big fucking bet too uh they're saying"
"6952580","6958560"," that if this if this fails here right we're coming up to the final hour of trade here again it's"
"6958560","6964220"," options expiration today and we do have a closed holiday closure in u.s. markets on monday one hour"

"7029980","7036020"," you guys want to know i'm not flat and at any point right now there was i was someone putting"
"7036020","7045590"," a hedge on american airlines in case there is a break of it you'll notice that they dated that"
"7045590","7052410"," hedge out to deuce sember so that hedge wasn't put for it so they didn't put a ten dollar a"
"7052410","7059790"," ten dollar excuse me a ten strike p a ten p strike on american airlines dated for june july august"

"8168570","8176230"," something that you have to watch uh closely because uh they print on the demand side uh so you want"
"8176230","8182370"," to like you want to be on them if you're like squeezing higher than three for squeezing higher than"
"8182370","8187570"," like 368 in the 370 you should get a hundred percent print on that money that you should have made"
