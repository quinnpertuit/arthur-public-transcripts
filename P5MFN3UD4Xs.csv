"P5MFN3UD4Xs","0","4720"," It's good to see Jim we're all trying to make sense of these what seem like fantastic numbers"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","4720","9000"," but then again set offset against what you think the Fed may or may not do and how you"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","9000","12840"," think that's going to impact markets over time."
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","12840","17040"," I think this is really, really good market for this really good numbers for the stock"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","17040","22040"," market Andrew here it is just one number and they tend to be volatile so you got to take"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","22040","26620"," it with a grain of salt but what this did I mean I think a real concern was building"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","26620","31580"," with the bond yield collapsing towards 1% on the 10 year here earlier this week as we"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","31580","38900"," were down to 1.12 or now almost up to 1.29 this morning that is a huge turn I think technically"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","38900","44740"," that's going to raise a lot for a lot of people that bond yields are done going down and maybe"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","44740","51900"," head it up again and what this does more than anything is it causes a big shift in the leadership"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","51900","56760"," of this stock market you can see this already where the Nasdaq is off a lot this morning"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","56760","63260"," and small cap stocks their futures are way up the recipe is not doing much but the undertow"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","63260","69340"," here is shifted towards cyclicals and smalls maybe even international markets to some degree"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","69340","75100"," those more sensitive to the economy and away from defensive and growth stocks which have"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","75100","79380"," been leading for a while here and you know I think that's the undertow I think the other"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","79380","85180"," thing this does is sort of calm down these covid fears a little bit and reminds people"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","85180","91080"," that there's still an incredible fundamental story here going on not only being reported"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","91080","97940"," by company earnings but now on Main Street as well in calm some of those fears yeah tightening"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","97940","102300"," is going to come at some point but I'll tell you what when we're when we're growing earnings"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","102300","108460"," like we're growing them and we have a you know a sub 1.3% 10 year treasury yield Andrew"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","108460","111900"," I think we've got to get some tightening of the system before this stock market is"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","111900","116860"," going to run into real trouble."
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","116860","121380"," Good morning traders this is your daily brief with Captain Jim James I hope you all had"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","121380","125180"," a great weekend grab yourself a cup of coffee or a whiskey because this is going to be a"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","125180","131740"," long one on Friday morning I watched the numbers reported and I also was watching the tape"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","131740","137620"," very closely the reaction to the numbers did lead me to turn on or check CNBC at some point"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","137620","142540"," during the day to see if they'd will out our cash in as the market reaction reminded"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","142540","149260"," me of the Senate election in November you'll remember that in Friday's daily brief I did"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","149260","155140"," mention that the NFP and unemployment numbers could be great in contradict a tapering dump"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","155140","158940"," and this is very similar to what took place in November though when the Senate election"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","158940","166660"," took place there were two seats that were left undecided which left the election undecided"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","166660","172100"," and whether the Democrats or the Republicans would firmly hold the Senate now they did roll"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","172100","176780"," out our cash and he explained that the market stayed up because the Senate would not go"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","176780","181180"," to those two Democratic seats and that the market was for looking that the Senate would"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","181180","185940"," be Republican now of course two weeks later we find out that no those two seats did go"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","185940","191540"," to Democrats and the vice president became the tie breaking vote now the markets should"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","191540","198180"," have dumped at that point right because the Republicans were not in control of the Senate"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","198180","202940"," well the market did not dump it continued to move up and they dragged our cash now once"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","202940","209580"," again to talk about that and that reminds me a lot of the tapered dump that we didn't"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","209580","215940"," get and I don't think we are getting a tapered dump right now even if we have a minor pullback"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","216020","222540"," or correction so keep that on your plate as we move forward you will hear the boogeyman"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","222540","226560"," come out of the closet saying you know look at this we actually are getting a tapered"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","226560","230540"," dump when meanwhile you'll miss out on buying these great dips that are going to present"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","230540","237180"," themselves because the nod in other aspects of the market is that the market is going"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","237180","243940"," up unknown news may briefly impact the market but known upcoming market news is only used"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","243940","249380"," to fit the narrative of where the big boys want the market to go I know that's a long"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","249380","255620"," statement to make but there's a lot of meaning in that you know and on a similar note oftentimes"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","255620","262180"," I'm asked why I'm bullish when placing bets with bad news on stocks or exiting stocks"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","262180","267420"," or shorting with great news on stocks and it's for those same reasons the news is usually"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","267420","273820"," only being used to position a long bet or exit a long position to go short you know so"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","273820","277540"," what does all that mean for the markets this upcoming week and month well you don't"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","277540","281820"," have to take a look at the market that doesn't lie and that's the bond market you know and"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","281820","286460"," somewhere at the and sometimes you have to somewhat look at the US dollar and gold as"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","286460","290940"," well as we know we know those markets can be manipulated but they do tend to tell some"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","290940","297180"," truth as to where the money is going right so feeding this will also be more economic"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","297180","302820"," news starting with CPI Wednesday and PPI and claims on Thursday so you're going to have"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","302820","308940"," the boogeyman with taper talk coming down the pike right that will be the bear thesis"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","308940","314140"," in the coming weeks and they will use any pullbacks in the market even if it's small"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","314140","320540"," with some uncertainty and CPI and PPI and claims on Thursday to try to get that market"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","320540","328740"," to pull back to get print prints on short positions but on the market moving upside the 10 year"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","328740","335380"," and gold and somewhat the dollar is showing that there will be some risk put into the"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","335380","340220"," market you know and those are really the things you want to be looking at and also this week"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","340220","346380"," don't lose sight of the fact that we have a big earnings week on small and mid caps somewhere"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","346380","352940"," like 900 to 1000 of those and then remember that those job numbers included a recovery"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","353020","359580"," and like travel and leisure and service sectors so that does give some sort of a nod towards"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","359580","363980"," these earnings reports being quite good for some of these companies you know to be quote"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","363980","369460"," unquote recovering at least and then lastly you want to also weigh in the quantity of easing"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","369460","375540"," express you know that whether you want to admit it or not and it is funny because it"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","375540","381420"," now includes more stimulus talk I will try to post that on Twitter today but I had somewhere"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","381500","386940"," yesterday I saw in the news that I think it was to leave or so one of the one of these senators"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","386940","392220"," is proposing permanent payments to people that make less than I think seventy five thousand dollars"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","392220","398700"," now the proposal of that bill is irrelevant what is relevant is that that bill is proposed"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","398700","405020"," and as long as it's debated stays alive or stays in the news that is considered part of that"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","405020","411340"," quantitative easing character we all remember last year when they used those carrots the markets"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","411340","417340"," went up and whenever the mark they were there were whenever the thought of stimulus going away"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","417340","422300"," happened the markets went down so those will be used to make the market pump and for the market"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","422300","428700"," to dump so now we have what we have talk of more stimulus we have the infrastructure bill"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","428700","434300"," carrot that will be toted around and then we have the eviction moratorium which now there are"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","434940","441100"," lawsuits being made against the CDC but so you'll see those three things be used over the"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","441100","446620"," coming weeks to both pump and dump the markets they're overall they've put all these pieces"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","446620","452780"," together and find out which direction the market is going to take and that does bring me back to"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","452780","458620"," that guy up that they wheeled out on CNBC you know where did he say the money was going to be this"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","458620","463820"," week it's good to see Jim we're all trying to make sense of these what seem like fantastic numbers"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","463820","468460"," but then again set offset against what you think the Fed may or may not do and how you think that's"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","468540","474460"," going to impact markets over time. I think this is really really good market for this"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","475020","479820"," really good numbers for the stock market Andrew here it is just one number they tend to be"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","479820","484700"," volatile so you got to take it with a grain of salt but what this did I mean I think a real"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","484700","489820"," concern was building with the bond yield collapsing towards 1 percent on the 10 year here earlier"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","489820","497500"," this week as we were down to 112 we're now almost up to 129 this morning that is a huge turn I think"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","497500","503340"," technically that's going to raise a lot for a lot of people that bond yields are done going down"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","503340","509340"," and maybe head it up again and what this does more than anything is it it causes a"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","509340","514700"," big shift in the leadership of this stock market you can see this already where the Nasdaq's off"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","514700","521340"," a lot this morning and small cap stocks their futures are way up the recipe is not doing much"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","521420","527500"," but the undertow here is shifted towards cyclicals and smalls maybe even international markets to"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","527500","533260"," some degree those more sensitive to the economy and away from defensive and growth stocks which"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","533260","538220"," has been which have been leading for a while here and you know I think that's the undertow I think"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","538220","544300"," the other thing this does is sort of calm down these covid fears a little bit and reminds people"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","544300","550860"," that there's still an incredible fundamental story here going on not only being reported by company"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","550860","557260"," earnings but now on main street as well and calm some of those fears yeah tightening is going"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","557260","561820"," to come at some point but I'll tell you what when we're when we're growing earnings like we're"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","561820","568620"," growing them and we have a you know a sub 1.3 percent 10 year treasury yield Andrew I think we've got"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","568620","572940"," to get some tightening of the system before the stock market's going to run into real trouble all"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","572940","578540"," right so you got that right so that would be probably the art cash and kind of a guy coming"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","578620","583580"," out of the woodwork or them wheeling him up to CNBC to tell you where to be putting your money"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","583580","588780"," now another place you can look to see where the money is going is the 10 year treasury note"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","588780","594620"," and what you want to be looking at is this firm bottom that was put in place and the 10 year going"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","594620","601340"," up infers that the market is going to take more risk on that people will be culling their bonds"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","601340","607020"," taking profit another hint would be the price of gold you will see that the price of gold did fall"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","607180","614460"," off on on the eighth specifically on yesterday there was a massive dump in gold and the dollar"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","614460","619820"," of course came back now when you see a dump in gold that is does not hold well for the market"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","619820","625260"," crashing that shows a weakness and of course it's showing a weakness in gold but it's going to show"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","625260","632060"," some strength later on in our markets now the only negative side to this viewpoint the markets"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","632060","637580"," are going up of course is the dollar now right now the dollar is trying to make a jump up and above"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","637580","644460"," to catch some support up here above 11953 and we might get this inflationary play where the dollar"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","644460","649820"," moves up and the market continues to move up now what moves up and what will move up in this market"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","649820","659740"," would be small caps and the S&P 500 now the NASDAQ might fall back a little bit or start to trail"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","659980","667420"," over time but if you remember last fall that also happened as the S&P and IWM moved up"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","667420","673740"," NASDAQ fell back a little bit but it came roaring back later in the month and my expectation for NASDAQ"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","673740","680380"," is possibly for that to happen where you see a small bleed off or pull back on NASDAQ and meanwhile"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","680380","686140"," while all the bulls are jumping on board small caps in the S&P the banks will be buying the bottoms"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","686140","691340"," of NASDAQ for another run much higher into the end of the month so my viewpoint right now is"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","691340","698060"," that the market does not fall in any meaningful way that bears are expecting now this week we do"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","698060","704780"," again have that CPI number coming out at 8.30 on Wednesday and we have claims coming out on"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","704780","710220"," Thursday at 8.30 am that might lead into some volatility that will give some good opportunity"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","710220","716780"," to buy some bottoms in the market this week specifically the NASDAQ and looking at the ES today"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","718540","724460"," we are looking for this new support this this was resistance just the other day and you can see"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","724460","730460"," we've had two bounces on ES here and we have a new resist or a new so this has become support"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","730460","738620"," and above has become resistance it's 4437.50 I do expect even if we come even if we start to test"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","738620","745980"," lows and come as low as 4366 I doubt that we break through here and fulfill that that bear"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","745980","754220"," tapering issue of hey are we going to come back down to 4331 or 4320 I am doubting this move lower"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","754220","758780"," so today I'm going to be looking to hopefully take some profits today or tomorrow if we can get"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","758780","764940"," down here to this 436.9 hopefully I can get some of the prints that I have to print down here though"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","764940","773420"," for the next leg up into 4481.75 on the smaller time frame you'll even see some resistance down"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","773420","780940"," here as we talked about around this 440.67 and possibly even seeing some resistance down here"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","780940","790300"," at 439.89 we also talked about 436 being the deepest that we go so today my call on s on the"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","790300","797980"," spine is going to be a bounce off of 441.50 that's right down here I'm looking for this bounce"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","797980","807500"," this morning and I move up to retest 44331 the risk on the downside is going to be this 440.55"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","808060","815340"," 439.93 and then heading back to this chart the deepest we could possibly go I see in the next"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","815340","830700"," two days would be 436.75 moving on to the NDX let me bring up the NDX on a larger time frame"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","830700","838060"," here and you can see that we broke above this resistance right here now you can see this this"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","838140","845660"," resistance line here we broke above and it is possible that we slide down over the course of this"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","845660","857100"," week here down and retest these numbers of 15023 and possibly even as deep as 14,865 I'm not"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","857100","865500"," bearish until we break down below these two numbers here somewhere around 14,865 14,800"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","865500","870060"," in reality I'm looking for some sort of bounce this is where I'm looking for a dip bounce or"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","870060","875500"," dip by this week so hopefully I can get this we can get this to come down grab this for the next"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","875500","883020"," move up later in the month so my expectation for today is that hopefully we trade down to 15,009"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","883020","889980"," and we make our move back up to 15,122 look for a big dip buying opportunity in the NASDAQ"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","890540","897020"," onto IWM this trend line right here this white trend line you want to keep your focus on"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","897020","902140"," as we move forward in the coming weeks and month remember that video that we watched earlier that"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","902140","907340"," would infer that the IWM is looking even more bullish than it was in the past another note to"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","907340","913100"," that would be the 10 year and even the dollar if we get some inflation could still point towards"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","913100","918860"," at least small caps moving up people have to go to Walmart whether they like it or not people"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","918860","924460"," have to go out and purchase gas there are things that people have to spend money on"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","924460","931260"," regardless if the dollar goes up so you want to check this trend line and right now as of right"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","931260","939100"," now as we come in to retest this trend line I'm buying this this trend line or anywhere below it"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","939100","945820"," down here which is where I have these numbers at 211,213 and 216 today I'm looking for no less or"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","945820","954860"," no more of a drop to 215.25 we make our next move up to retest 225 again today and then make a"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","954860","961100"," continued move up to 230 or 235 and that's moving up into this vicinity up here"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","961900","967340"," here's to maybe 235 right here and here is 230."
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","968060","978460"," Now moving on to Tesla and why I was speaking earlier about I buy bad news is exactly for what"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","978460","985580"," took place this week on Tesla now I am bullish on Tesla because we keep retesting this resistance"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","985580","992620"," up here now we did lose support Thursday and or we lost the will to move up Thursday and Friday"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","992700","1000140"," I attribute this to call options expiring this past week now I do think that we could possibly"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1000140","1005740"," still have have some room to come down to this 682 number right here and even possibly down to"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1005740","1013580"," this 653 so my plan right now is to buy some slightly outside the money call spreads and if"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1013580","1020060"," we continue to move down I'll go more aggressively on weekly call options for a spike up between now"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1020060","1028140"," and August 23rd I do not think that the rise of Tesla is over as we've spoken about in the past"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1028140","1034220"," there's a lot of equity buying down here here in banks and in the short term nothing is showing"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1034220","1040540"," me any big sell-offs in Tesla this is more of a rhythmic move that Tesla tends to go up 10 to 12"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1040540","1046860"," percent it tends to come back anywhere from 2 to 5 percent for its next move that's all I've"
"P5MFN3UD4Xs","1046860","1051500"," got for you today I look forward to seeing you all on Twitter have a great day trading"
