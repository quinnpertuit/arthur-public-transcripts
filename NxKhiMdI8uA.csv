"NxKhiMdI8uA","0","3320"," It's like, it's like a half an hour to get the show off."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3320","5320"," At least."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","5320","8320"," Well, on Mondays it is."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","8320","10320"," Get the stuff rolling here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","10320","11320"," Look at that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","18040","19640"," It's at least a half an hour."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","19640","24520"," It's probably like, figuring them up at like six in the morning"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","24520","26680"," and then like by seven bros starting to get ready."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","26680","28160"," Like big shower and stuff."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","30000","40000"," We actually, you guys see me on, uh..."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","40000","55000"," You chewed this morning, it's like, yeah, we'll do our own thing here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","55000","58000"," That's my legion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","58000","73000"," Dave, good morning out there, how y'all doing?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","73000","74000"," Good morning, uh, just stay right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","74000","75000"," Good to see you this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","75000","78000"," Check once you almost there, boys and girls."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","88000","100000"," Let's burn this shit to the ground."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","100000","105000"," I don't know if that's happening here, but we'll check into it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","105000","107000"," But I am expecting some volatility."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","107000","110000"," So, we're going to press the camera on."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","110000","117000"," Let's tell me the camera's on."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","117000","123000"," Power round, boys and girls."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","123000","124000"," Power round."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","124000","127000"," Maybe I can post the links everywhere."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","127000","128000"," Let me see spy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","128000","131000"," We're looking at BDA."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","131000","134000"," There's some Anakin bowls or something."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","134000","135000"," Oh, yeah."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","135000","137000"," Good morning, everybody."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","137000","139000"," How y'all doing out there this morning?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","139000","140000"," I've got a few things I've got to do."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","140000","141000"," I've got to set some stuff up here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","141000","146000"," We're going to go right into the market brief here and start talking."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","146000","148000"," Shit chatting away."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","148000","149000"," Spyend video."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","149000","154000"," We'll do IWM and we'll do, uh, what else will we do this morning?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","154000","162000"," Uh, we'll do the Qs, QQQ, live stream."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","162000","165000"," Did you guys see the, did I get the thumbnail up there this morning?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","165000","168000"," I've got the, uh, bring out the volatility bear thumbnail."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","169000","171000"," Uh, so we'll talk about that today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","171000","173000"," We've got a bunch of stuff to go over."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","173000","178000"," Uh, from the market briefs from yesterday and probably from Friday too, if we can."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","178000","182000"," Uh, the one that was for Friday and then the one that was for yesterday."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","182000","185000"," I got to do one quick thing here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","185000","187000"," Uh, what am I looking for?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","187000","188000"," There we go."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","188000","192000"," And then, uh, what do we got on this one here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","192000","197000"," But we're going to take a look this morning at, uh, to start with."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","197000","199000"," Um, CNBC."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","199000","201000"," I know you guys hate CNBC."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","201000","202000"," I do too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","202000","203000"," Don't get me wrong."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","203000","205000"," I'm not a fan of CNBC."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","205000","209000"," Uh, but this is, you know, a lot of people do care about CNBC."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","209000","211000"," Not, you know, not just me."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","211000","213000"," Uh, I care what they say."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","213000","214000"," I care."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","214000","219000"," Actually, I was talking to a ball whiz and he said that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","219000","226000"," He sometimes will read CNN, uh, news about the stock market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","227000","232000"," Just to see what, uh, they're feeding to regular people on Main Street."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","232000","236000"," There is some, some, some need for CNBC."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","236000","245000"," Um, because you do know that old men, uh, or at least by, I don't know if you're watching Wolf of Wall Street or some of these guys, one of those movies, they all watch CNBC, like we're just guys or whatever."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","245000","247000"," I don't know if they actually do that, but."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","247000","252000"," They probably doing it so they can see each other up there begging for free money."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","253000","257000"," Uh, stock futures fall after Dow's worst week since October."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","257000","259000"," Doom."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","259000","264000"," Uh, we don't have the big painted red stuff up there though."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","264000","267000"," So we're not quite in markets and turmoil yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","267000","269000"," And I don't expect that either."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","269000","275000"," I'm going to expect the market to be bought this morning and for us to trade to about 516."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","275000","277000"," Um, and then I think we're going to go higher."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","277000","280000"," I think we're going to go up to 520, believe it or not."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","280000","284000"," Uh, but there is a range in here that we can trade a little bit lower."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","284000","286000"," We've got the gamma flip on SPX down."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","286000","288000"," I believe at 5100."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","288000","289000"," Don't quote me on that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","289000","292000"," We're going to check this morning's data and see where things are."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","292000","295000"," Uh, so we'll take a look at that here briefly."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","295000","298000"," We've got a Monday analyst calls."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","298000","299000"," We're not even going to bother."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","299000","300000"," Look at that stuff."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","300000","301000"," We don't want to."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","301000","302000"," I just don't want to hear it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","302000","305000"," Um, here are Monday's biggest analyst calls."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","305000","308000"," I think I read it to raise nearly 750 million upcoming IPO."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","308000","313000"," I think this article I read will yesterday from someone else of the day before was 450."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","313000","315000"," So now it's up to 750."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","315000","318000"," We already know how this happens here, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","318000","323000"," They put that pipe out there and, uh, everybody's at a different level, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","323000","327000"," You guys know when they start these IPOs, it's like, well, it's worth a dollar."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","327000","329000"," Let's go sell it to our best buddy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","329000","334000"," And then we're going to sell it to our other buddy for $2 and then $3 and then $4."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","335000","336000"," And they racked the price up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","336000","340000"," Uh, we bet you basically short basically all IPOs get shorted today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","340000","343000"," That's, that's like if you did that, that's a rule."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","343000","346000"," I mean, it's just, and I don't know why people buy it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","346000","349000"," I don't know what, I don't know how this is allowed."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","349000","350000"," Um, but it is."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","350000","354000"," And, uh, when people hear that, they're like, I'm all in."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","354000","363000"," And so, uh, I would assume here that whatever opening price of Reddit is that you short it into the fucking ground."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","363000","365000"," That's my expectation."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","365000","367000"," Uh, it's going to open up something stupid."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","367000","370000"," Uh, and that you'd want to short that ticker into the ground."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","370000","374000"," Uh, we'll wait and see where it opens."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","374000","378000"," Uh, or even if it rips, I mean, it would even be better if it ripped off the bell."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","378000","380000"," Uh, that would be great."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","380000","385000"," Um, but I'm, I'm going to assume here that people are going to do their darn just."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","385000","390000"," Um, let me know if I'm, if I'm wrong in that, uh, to short it into the fucking ground."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","390000","392000"," There'll be an attempt to do that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","392000","394000"," Uh, what else do we have here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","394000","400000"," Uh, oh, Trump suggests you would not crack down in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as president."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","400000","402000"," Can you believe that shit?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","402000","407000"," I would make mag seven double."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","407000","410000"," We were just discussing this last week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","410000","416000"," We were discussing if, um, if Trump would have an impact on the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","417000","421000"," Uh, and bring back volatility to, uh, our markets."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","421000","423000"," And what do we have here today?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","423000","428000"," Trump's suggesting he would not crack down on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","428000","430000"," Uh, if he was president."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","430000","436000"," But in 25, 25 budget, Mary's progressive tax hikes with populist campaign planks."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","436000","438000"," This one here is a developing story."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","438000","442000"," Uh, he rolled out some kind of a very wealthy tax."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","442000","444000"," Uh, last week, I believe."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","444000","446000"," And I think that's this article is tied to that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","446000","449000"," We discussed this last week too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","449000","454000"," Uh, before that news began to drop, I think it was like two days later, they started dropping that news."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","454000","459000"," But you're the only, the only thing that I could see here would be Ray Dalio talks about this stuff,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","459000","464000"," which of course Ray Dalio sucks at timing, but he's really good at explaining."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","464000","468000"," And, uh, this late stage of these cycles."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","468000","472000"," Normally you go after you text the fuck out of the richest people."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","472000","476000"," Uh, whether that those laws pass or not is a whole nother thing."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","476000","481000"," Uh, but there would be an expectation that you're looking to, um, take money away from the ultra rich."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","481000","482000"," That's what it is."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","482000","484000"," Or at least the threat of it or the perception of it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","484000","487000"," Um, I don't think we've done that since 78."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","487000","491000"," So, uh, I don't know that that ever really truly happens."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","491000","497000"," Like it'll look like it's happening, but, um, this, this is not shocking to me either here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","497000","499000"," This article, so all these articles are starting to come out."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","500000","502000"," Uh, what else do we have going on?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","502000","504000"," We've got an anger over Pope's white flag."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","504000","509000"," We've got stocks making the biggest pre-market moves, not a whole bunch of news today because we've got so much coming."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","509000","511000"," Over on financial juice."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","511000","513000"," Let me see if I can find anything here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","513000","515000"," See, there's anything worth looking at here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","515000","518000"," I don't know if we're, we still on the hundred and thirty five percent."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","518000","521000"," Let's go back to the, uh, 80% that's supposed to be."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","521000","526000"," And, uh, whoa, that's a little, that's a little bit smaller than it should be."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","526000","528000"," Back up to this one right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","529000","531000"," Uh, US CPI prep."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","531000","533000"," Uh, that was for eight thirty this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","533000","536000"," Uh, so we've got a bunch of data coming out."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","536000","539000"," Uh, this morning and then the rest of the week, we're going to go over all this stuff."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","539000","543000"," But instead of the market briefing, how we normally do it, I'm going to go through."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","543000","546000"," Uh, some of the events that are coming our way."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","546000","548000"," Uh, now if you're a supporter level."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","548000","551000"," On the website, you got that from yesterday."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","551000","552000"," I listed off, I think everything."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","552000","554000"," If I've missed anything, let me know."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","554000","561000"," Uh, but I did, uh, list out the dates, times and the expectations of this volatility."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","561000","565000"," Uh, that could be coming our way in over the next two weeks."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","565000","567000"," Uh, so there's a lot of land mines."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","567000","570000"," And I also did post, I believe somewhere."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","570000","573000"," I don't know where either on Twitter or in the discord."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","573000","579000"," Uh, that the takeaway here is to scale out from a one minute chart."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","579000","584000"," To, um, the next, especially the next like two weeks."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","584000","589000"," Uh, into maybe the first two weeks of the next quarter."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","589000","595000"," You scale it, just step back a little bit and just see where we are and look for some range expansion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","595000","600000"," Uh, so if you're looking for more, more for range expansion, you can be looking for."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","600000","605000"," Uh, places of interest on the downside and then, uh."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","606000","608000"," Ceilings on the upside with gamma."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","608000","611000"," We know we've got a large ceiling above it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","611000","612000"," 5200."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","612000","614000"," We know where the gamma flip is down below."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","614000","617000"," We know where CTA's are most likely to sell."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","617000","621000"," Uh, so we're going to start to, uh, so just open our eyes a little bit more."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","621000","623000"," Look a little bit, a little bit, stand a little bit back."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","623000","628000"," Uh, as these volatile events come into play and it should relieve."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","628000","633000"," Some of your stress out there, we're going to talk about that stress as well."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","633000","638000"," Uh, today that when we come into these moments, how your stress can go away."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","638000","642000"," If you scale back a little bit, just pull back a little bit, see where we are."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","642000","647000"," If we're going to expect volatility to rise, you're going to expect prices to."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","647000","652000"," Uh, begin to make more violent moves, uh, for a period of time, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","652000","657000"," We also know that there is a window of weakness after a triple witching."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","657000","659000"," That is on Friday, the 15th."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","660000","666000"," Um, so we also know that, uh, there's a, like a clench into that and then an unclench."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","666000","669000"," Uh, well, sometimes people call it an unclench."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","669000","672000"," Some people will call it a window of weakness."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","672000","677000"," Um, but there is a window there of some, some of the ability for some vault to come into the marketplace."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","677000","683000"," Uh, due to the expiry of gamma and options expiry, uh, all coinciding at the same time."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","683000","688000"," There's a little bit loosening of that, uh, of that pinning action that takes place."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","688000","692000"," As we come into, uh, triple witching, but then even afterwards."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","692000","696000"," Now when that happens, it doesn't necessarily mean we're getting a down move."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","696000","697000"," It just means volatility."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","697000","702000"," And it's the, the, then it also comes the ability for us to check sentiment."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","702000","708000"," And also, uh, there also comes, uh, the ability to find out if people are rolling higher into higher calls,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","708000","712000"," or if they're rolling into puts to the downside."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","712000","717000"," Uh, so we, we'll be monitoring that as we come into this, um, these events and just be aware here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","717000","728000"," That, uh, there are all, uh, there's volatility gang nuts, vault sellers, but vault buyers that are aware of all of this stuff coming down the pike here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","728000","731000"," Uh, in the next couple of weeks, they're hyper aware."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","731000","732000"," They know all the dates."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","732000","735000"," They're, they're listing off all the reasons why the market crash."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","735000","740000"," And, uh, we know though that right now they do sell vault into each of these events."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","740000","742000"," Uh, that they're going to be talking this up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","742000","745000"," If you're on the fin to it, I haven't been on fin to it all weekend."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","745000","752000"," If you have been on fin to it, I'm fucking betting that people were out there all weekend, like spitting all kinds of yarns to you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","752000","756000"," Like, you got to check this one out and you got to check that one out."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","756000","760000"," And what about when this ends, you know, that we're doomed, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","760000","763000"," Dude, this is all doom ahead of us."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","763000","764000"," And you're not aware of that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","764000","768000"," We have all that doom coming because we got to create some volatility in this market, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","768000","769000"," We can get none."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","769000","774000"," Uh, now the question becomes, does that volatility turn into, uh, true sentiment?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","774000","778000"," Or is it just, uh, noise in the background?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","778000","781000"," So we have to monitor that over the next two weeks."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","781000","791000"," If we're going from, if we're going into volatility or the perception of volatility, does that turn into a sentiment change?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","791000","792000"," That is a key point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","792000","795000"," Sentiment matters more than you think in this market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","795000","797000"," Um, and not just the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","797000","799000"," The sentiment matters."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","799000","801000"," Uh, for the discussion everywhere."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","801000","803000"," What's being discussed on CNN to the regular people?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","803000","806000"," What's being discussed on CNBC to you and I?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","806000","810000"," Well, what's being talked about in Fintuit and, uh, how scared are people?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","810000","815000"," You know, are they really scared, kind of scared, sitting on hands, waiting to put their money in the market?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","815000","816000"," What are they doing?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","816000","821000"," Uh, so pay attention to that out in your, uh, in your, whatever, wherever you hang out out there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","821000","825000"," And so let's get right into the opening bell position right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","826000","829000"," I should have deleted this, but I'm going to leave this up for right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","829000","834000"," Uh, so this is from last night's, this is from last night's, um, market brief."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","834000","838000"," And I am looking to go up here, believe it or not."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","838000","841000"," People are probably going to be like, cap, that's not happening."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","841000","849000"," Uh, we're going to come up here, test this, uh, hourly trigger and then blast out of the depths of hell down here or something like that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","849000","850000"," Uh, I do."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","850000","855000"," I'm still open to some rejection for more downside, but I am looking at that worst case scenario."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","855000","858000"," Uh, for five, I want to see 508 get bought."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","858000","862000"," I don't know where we are in price right now, but if we tagged 508 at this point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","862000","864000"," Uh, we're at 51062."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","864000","865000"," Let's take a peek down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","865000","867000"," 508 is what I want to buy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","867000","871000"," So let's, I'm saying that as I haven't bought shit sitting here right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","872000","873000"," So that's 509."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","873000","874000"," 27."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","874000","875000"," Uh, it's kind of close."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","875000","876000"," It's kind of close."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","876000","877000"," So."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","877000","878000"," I'm not anti."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","878000","879000"," It's going up right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","879000","882000"," I would really like to see about this 508 right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","882000","883000"," This is what I want to buy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","883000","885000"," You want to buy this right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","885000","886000"," Right in there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","886000","888000"," I want to buy that one."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","888000","889000"," So we'll see if we can get there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","889000","891000"," If we can get a, uh, another rejection."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","891000","893000"," Uh, we'll see if we can get a, uh, another rejection."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","893000","894000"," Uh, we'll see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","894000","895000"," Uh, we'll see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","895000","896000"," Uh, we'll see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","896000","897000"," Uh, we'll see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","897000","898000"," Uh, we'll see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","898000","899000"," We'll see if we can get there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","899000","902000"," If we can get a, uh, another rejection here, it'd be kind of nice."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","902000","904000"," And that's the actual dip."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","904000","907000"," Uh, we'll find out now if we get above the hourly trigger."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","907000","910000"," Uh, right here, it'd be more than willing to take that trade up here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","910000","912000"," So I'm open to that trade as well."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","912000","914000"," Um, and I am bullish here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","914000","916000"," So I don't know what you guys are."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","916000","917000"," I'm assuming."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","917000","919000"," I'm assuming right that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","919000","924000"," Uh, and I, I potentially stayed off, uh, some serious downside."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","924000","926000"," Uh, blood to come."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","927000","928000"," Uh, I'm not quite there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","928000","929000"," I think we do have that ability."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","929000","931000"," I just don't think it's today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","931000","933000"," Uh, I think there's a weekly dip by this week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","933000","937000"," And I think as we get into, um, Wednesday, Thursday, there could be, uh,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","937000","940000"," some, some nice volatility into triple witching."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","940000","943000"," But I think next week is when, uh,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","943000","946000"," you guys have a real fair chance of some kind of nastiness."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","946000","949000"," Um, no, saying that, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","949000","950000"," I'm over here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","950000","953000"," What, you know, blowing my, blowing my stuff over here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","953000","955000"," Going blah, blah, buddy, blah, blah, blah."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","955000","960000"," Uh, if we do get underneath, uh, let's say we reject this and we come down."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","960000","963000"," We do actually blast down below this daily trigger."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","963000","968000"," Uh, if at any point, uh, if it, let me just say we make that a little greener."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","968000","972000"," If at any point that our early trigger comes back down underneath, uh,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","972000","977000"," and there's a rejection above that we come back up here and begin to reject this stuff"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","977000","980000"," and get underneath this daily trigger, get underneath the hourly trigger."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","980000","985000"," Uh, I will switch from being a buyer of dips to a seller of rips."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","985000","989000"," Uh, but until that happens, till we start, till we start to confirm an actual"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","989000","993000"," correction to the downside, any of this kind of price action right here,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","993000","998000"," still a buyer of dips, regardless of, uh, what anyone is out there telling you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","998000","1003000"," Uh, now there is a little bit of a, a sideways flattening going on right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1003000","1004000"," So you can see this."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1004000","1006000"," This is important to see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1006000","1009000"," Uh, there is a little bit of flattening, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1009000","1013000"," A little bit of consolidative, uh, action going on here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1013000","1019000"," So this doesn't necessarily mean, uh, doom and gloom just doesn't."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1019000","1024000"," And until that price action shows itself, uh, you're not going to get anything from me"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1024000","1027000"," in terms of a, uh, a video."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1027000","1029000"," You're not getting a, um, a correction video."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1029000","1031000"," You guys normally get correction videos from me."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1031000","1035000"," Like that is the top right there or, uh, this is a potential top right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1035000","1037000"," I don't see that today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1037000","1041000"," So I need to, so today I need to see price action this week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1041000","1043000"," I need to see price action, set that up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1043000","1048000"," Uh, otherwise the other thing that I'm expecting here is, uh, some range expansion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1048000","1051000"," Just this nice little range expansion up here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1051000","1052000"," Come on down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1052000","1053000"," That kind of stuff like that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1053000","1054000"," Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1054000","1057000"," Uh, and then some, then some, some, uh, calm this too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1057000","1059000"," And as we had it, they parked the bus right to come in."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1059000","1062000"," They parked the bus and then, uh, they're going to do that same park in the bus."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1062000","1063000"," Bullshit."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1063000","1065000"," Into the end of month at some point as well."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1065000","1068000"," Usually not always, but oftentimes you'll see that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1069000","1073000"," So expect volatility is the name of the game here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1073000","1075000"," Go over to the, uh, main screen."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1077000","1078000"," See what we can see here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1080000","1081000"," What do we got down here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1081000","1083000"," Uh, we're going to get rid of this."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1084000","1085000"," Turn that off."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1086000","1091000"," Uh, we're going to set up the, we're going to check the data right now for, um, the."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1092000","1096000"," SPX gamma and see what that's saying this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1098000","1100000"," See, we can find out here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1101000","1104000"," I'm going to read you some notes from some other guys as well here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1104000","1108000"," If I can, uh, toggle, toggle the sidebar here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1108000","1112000"," To then get some other stuff going to you and we're going to put this then down below."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1116000","1120000"," See what magical stuff is, uh, being said to us this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1122000","1126000"," Now I'm not a whole bunch of changes this morning. We do have the, uh, get. Ooh, nice."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1126000","1128000"," Switch over here. Let's take a look at that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1130000","1136000"," Pause that right there. We've got a nice little bit of support setting up down below at 5100."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1136000","1138000"," Uh, the gamma flip has moved up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1139000","1141000"," I think it's moved up a little bit down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1142000","1146000"," Uh, so I'm hoping for this, not hoping, but wanting this to hold down here. Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1146000","1153000"," So you have 5100. You got the gamma flip down below at, uh, that roughly 51 10 on the gamma flip."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1153000","1157000"," So this looks like the, the zone right to trade."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1157000","1160000"," Let's take a look down here. See what we can see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1160000","1163000"," Let me switch this over to the, uh, one minute chart for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1163000","1166000"," And I'm going to clear all this stuff up here for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1166000","1169000"," So just right in here to see, you can see it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1172000","1174000"," We'll leave that up right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1175000","1178000"," That's the one minute timeframe for spy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1181000","1184000"," A lot of air push all that out. See what's happening over there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1189000","1191000"," See if we can see anything here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1195000","1198000"," There we go. Is that helping right there? Maybe a little bit."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1198000","1199000"," Get that right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1205000","1209000"," Yeah, it's already stepping right here. It's like, bam, there's one, bam, there's two."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1211000","1220000"," That was just a few moments ago somewhere in there. I'm looking for that dip by the one thing we are watching here is the one thing we are watching here is another leg down."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1220000","1225000"," Have a little bit more, you know, just right down there. And then that's your real upside."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1225000","1229000"," If you're a bull, you know that you want to be above."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1229000","1233000"," This is a, this is a moment in the stream right now. I want to talk to you about. Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1234000","1235000"," Listen closely."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1236000","1238000"," Don't pull a captain, Jim James."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1240000","1243000"," If we are above the hourly trigger, uh,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1244000","1248000"," I would be interested in a long, but we are not above the hourly trigger right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1248000","1252000"," So until we are above that hourly trigger, uh, I would expect."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1253000","1257000"," I'm going to expect selling off of that hourly trigger, okay, because we are below it right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1257000","1264000"," So until we're above this area right here, right? Get above, come back down, get a new high, right? There's your new high."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1264000","1268000"," And we have the continuation of the upside for the bulls until that happens."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1268000","1272000"," On an intraday basis, looking for a little bit more downside."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1274000","1279000"," Let's pay attention to that and see if we can get that more downside on the open this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1280000","1285000"," All right. So, uh, we've got the updated charts down here for SPX, a gamma."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1286000","1290000"," Uh, this is what I'm going to be looking for down here. I can draw a little line. See if I can catch that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1291000","1294000"," Maybe I can catch that down there and then that up there. That'd be nice."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1295000","1297000"," Close all that gap right there. You see that nice gap."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1298000","1301000"," And then maybe come back down right down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1303000","1306000"," Consolidation, maybe, and then you get your run to the upside. Whoop."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1307000","1310000"," All right. There we go. Something like that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1311000","1314000"," Uh, if the bear, the doom bears can get us down below."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1315000","1318000"," Watch this, this gap down below here. You see it right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1319000","1322000"," Doom bears sometimes want to catch us down below here, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1323000","1326000"," Close that gap down there and then we're continuation to the upside right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1327000","1331000"," So we'll pay attention to both of those, uh, these, both of these gaps down below here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1331000","1338000"," Keep an eye out down here and see what the bears are going to be doing. The, uh, especially the vault, not necessarily the bears, but the volatility bears."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1339000","1348000"," You know, a lot of noise from volatility bears, not necessarily, uh, not necessarily, um, not necessarily, um,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1349000","1355000"," I'm real, I don't know if you want to call it real price action, but not necessarily doom just yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1356000","1357000"," So."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1360000","1362000"," Yeah, I mean, I'm reading some of you guys."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1364000","1368000"," Cap, could you tell us if NQQ's look the same as by? No, they do not."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1369000","1373000"," Uh, and if you are a supporter, uh, you would know that I did post last night."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1374000","1379000"," QQQ's and spoons, uh, they have all three charts look different."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1379000","1382000"," Uh, my expectations and all three charts are different this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1383000","1386000"," Uh, as well. So we will, they are different."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1387000","1390000"," All right, so I'm going to read a few more things for you this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1390000","1396000"," The Euro recap, uh, markets dip ECB considers rate cuts European stocks open lower across the board."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1396000","1402000"," Uh, you ECB member, uh, Kasmair suggests June rate cuts are possible citing."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1402000","1404000"," Fragile disinflation, Portugal center, right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1404000","1407000"," Coalition narrow, narrowly wins a parliamentary majority."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1408000","1412000"," Uh, Spain, some data highlights would be Spain's January retail sales year over year,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1412000","1415000"," or 0.3% versus 2.7% prior."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1416000","1418000"," Well, hello."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1420000","1421000"," Uh, what else we got here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1424000","1427000"," Oh, okay. So I got to look that. Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1427000","1429000"," I got some stuff I got to look at this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1431000","1432000"," Uh, what else we got here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1433000","1436000"," I got to check something here this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1436000","1438000"," I'm being told that, uh,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1439000","1442000"," I got to take a look at some other stuff this morning, but also I got here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1443000","1444000"," Check what we got here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1449000","1452000"," That's all I got for you right now at this moment."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1452000","1454000"," Nothing's really changed here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1454000","1461000"," Uh, all expectations from this, from this, um, from this, um, weekend remain the same as we're posted."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1461000","1462000"," Yesterday."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1462000","1464000"," There's a really, there's a bunch of weird stuff going on here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1465000","1470000"," It's, um, there's a bunch of weird stuff going on here in the background."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1472000","1477000"," Um, market breath right now is marching higher."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1478000","1482000"," Uh, and it's spreading out in, in sector rotation."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1484000","1490000"," There is a divergence being created to an extent on PPOs and PMOs."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1492000","1497000"," That suggests the divergence in price on the S and P 500, uh, with PPOs and PMOs."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1500000","1508000"," Uh, so there's a, like there's a, there's a, there's a, the, the, the second divergence would, or the second divergence, of course, would be market breath."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1508000","1516000"," So, um, between that and that, and if you've looked at that chart last night, right, that chart specifically."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1516000","1519000"," Also, some of the data that's coming out right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1520000","1527000"," I made a note last night on a post about, um, on a post about the, all, all the macro you need charts."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1528000","1535000"," Now that, those charts show the, um, fed funds rates, the unemployment rates, the inflate rate of inflation."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1536000","1538000"," And the 10 year yield."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1539000","1541000"," And what's fascinating about it is."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1542000","1548000"," You can kind of get the inflation spiking and you can get the unemployment, the jobs rate spiking in conjunction."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1549000","1553000"," Um, in conjunction with like a price rollover, it can, it's good."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1553000","1555000"," It's good for bears at least."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1556000","1563000"," Um, but on that same token, uh, what I've been watching these report, like I've been watching all these reports that come out."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1563000","1568000"," And these reports that come out there like this, this is how it goes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1568000","1573000"," It's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, oh, dude, inflation's so bad right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1573000","1576000"," And then like a week later, like, oh, no, no, no, it's not so bad."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1576000","1577000"," The inflation's coming down."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1577000","1578000"," It's really nice."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1578000","1580000"," You know, it's like the market reacts to it that way."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1580000","1583000"," And then like, oh, yeah, dude, inflation's super bad, dude."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1583000","1584000"," Really bad."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1584000","1585000"," Same thing with that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1585000","1586000"," Well, not as much without employment."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1586000","1590000"," Unemployment is, uh, steadily rising slowly."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1591000","1595000"," And as a matter of fact, they're near that four percent level."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1596000","1602000"," So I'm fascinated to see if they pull it back down, but the same shit's going on as well with unemployment and jobs."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1602000","1603000"," It's like this year."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1603000","1607000"," And you can tell that the Fed is attempting to manipulate."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1608000","1610000"," Uh, this stuff, you can see it in the reporting."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1610000","1613000"," It's like, yeah, you know, it's really good right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1613000","1615000"," Oh, no, no, it's really bad right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1615000","1617000"," Oh, no, it's really good right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1617000","1623000"," Um, and so you're just seeing that that's the base stable or the attempt to stabilize these numbers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1624000","1628000"," And, uh, as these reports went, I'm like, don't tell me it was a, it was a hot read today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1628000","1632000"," And then like the next week, I'm like, don't tell me it's cold read today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1632000","1638000"," You know, so it's like hot, cold, hot, cold, uh, massage the beast as much as you can."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1647000","1649000"," And then when you make it happen, can we make?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1649000","1650000"," I don't know."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1650000","1651000"," You know, I got to David."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1651000","1652000"," I got to tell you something, David Garris."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1652000","1654000"," I still have a hedge on this market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1654000","1658000"," I could have fucking sold it twice and haven't like I have, I need like."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1659000","1663000"," I need five 25 to 500, but I would really like."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1664000","1668000"," Sub 500 as we head into the end of the month because all that fucking data I'm going to catch."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1669000","1671000"," And it's going to be a great trade, but."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1672000","1673000"," Um, yeah, I'm with you, Damon."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1674000","1676000"," Any, any doubt, not just me."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1676000","1678000"," Uh, this is another thing too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1678000","1680000"," We talked about this last week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1680000","1684000"," There is still a shit ton of money in the sidelines."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1685000","1690000"," That did not go long from, uh, Jan one until right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1690000","1693000"," And they just watched this meteoric rise in the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1693000","1698000"," And they're like, they told me not to take along until, uh, March April, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1698000","1699000"," They told me March April."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1699000","1700000"," I'm supposed to take a long."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1700000","1701000"," I'm supposed to wait."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1702000","1704000"," That's the safest thing to do."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1704000","1708000"," And historically it is historically you should be waiting if you're like, uh."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1709000","1711000"," I don't know if you're not a market participant."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1711000","1713000"," You're just managing your own investments."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1714000","1715000"," Uh, yeah, March April."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1715000","1717000"," So they have seen that meteoric rise."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1718000","1719000"," And they're all angry."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1719000","1723000"," So I think there's a lot of, uh, bulls and bears."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1724000","1728000"," In conjunction that secretly wants a seasonal low."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1728000","1730000"," Uh, so yeah, I'm with you, man."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1730000","1731000"," I hope we get one."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1731000","1733000"," Uh, if we can get one, I'd be stoked."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1733000","1734000"," I really would."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1735000","1744000"," Like, if you look at a market, if you look at the market breath, it's like, yeah, there's, there's been some good buys, but price hasn't followed, uh, to those good buys."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1744000","1748000"," Market breath's given good buys, but price just hasn't gone there with it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1750000","1756000"," Some blood coming down here right now, a little bit of rejection off of, uh, uh, five, 10, 34."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1756000","1758000"," Coming back for a third retest down below here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1758000","1763000"," Of course you heard me earlier said really like to get like 508, maybe even 507."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1763000","1769000"," Let's take a look and see what the, um, let's take a look and see what the, uh, pivots are saying here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1769000","1770000"," We'll bring those up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1772000","1773000"," And here's the first one right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1773000","1774000"," This is S one."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1775000","1777000"," I'm going to remove this, uh, this gray box for you now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1778000","1781000"," You got S one down here and you've got, uh, S two."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1782000","1784000"," Five oh six, 60."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1784000","1787000"," Five oh two, uh, five oh six, 60."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1787000","1790000"," I'm going to clear out, clean all this up for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1790000","1792000"," And, uh, we're going to start taking a peek here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1793000","1794000"," Right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1795000","1796000"," Still a seller."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1796000","1798000"," Uh, we are below the half hour and hourly trigger."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1798000","1800000"," Let's take a look at the 30 minute really quick too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1800000","1804000"," And just see where we are in the 30 minutes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1806000","1808000"," Let's see if we can get some calculations going here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1809000","1811000"," Uh, and I want to show you one other thing here too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1811000","1814000"," So just on the hourly, uh, on, on the hourly of velocity."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1815000","1817000"," Uh, it's still looking like it's still coming down, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1817000","1819000"," We still have some velocity to the downside."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1820000","1824000"," Uh, so, you know, unless we get something huge here, I'm still still kind of bearish here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1825000","1829000"," So at least in the 30 minute side of things, um, still waiting."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1830000","1831000"," No dip by for me at this point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1831000","1833000"," See that right there and see, let's see if that right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1836000","1837000"," Take me like 508, man."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1838000","1840000"," I'm going to try to squeeze it up right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1840000","1842000"," I'm going to try to juice, get some juice right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1842000","1843000"," Crank this bad boy up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1843000","1844000"," Let's see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1844000","1845000"," All right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1845000","1847000"," Light trading this morning, huh?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1847000","1848000"," Does this look like light trading?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1848000","1850000"," You guys, any guys are checking the volume bars yet this morning?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1851000","1853000"," Looking like some really light trade in here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1854000","1855000"," Am I wrong here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1855000","1856000"," When I'm missing here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1856000","1857000"," Missing something."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1857000","1862000"," You know, when you're missing something, it's like, what's the most important thing about getting in here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1862000","1864000"," You know, I'm trying to squeeze it up right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1865000","1866000"," I'm trying to get some juice right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1866000","1867000"," Crank this bad boy up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1867000","1868000"," Let's see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1869000","1870000"," All right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1870000","1871000"," Light trading this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1871000","1872000"," Huh."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1872000","1876240"," Am I wrong here? What am I missing here? I'm missing something here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1876960","1881760"," This looks like mechanical. This looks like either light trading or mechanical trading."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1882560","1885120"," This looks like somebody turned on the robots this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1889520","1892240"," Well, hold on, Jay Shameri, what you're saying I can't read that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1892240","1897280"," Saw that last week was the largest tech net outflow since 2017."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1897280","1899600"," Typically, there's been a good result in previous times."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1899600","1902880"," It happens. The market then rallied further."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1902880","1906720"," Yeah, I want to know what those outflows were. Who is doing the outflowing?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1907440","1911440"," I'm not seeing that. I'll look right now and see if I can see. Maybe I'm wrong here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1914400","1916160"," Yeah, I don't know that that's. Oh, wait a minute."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1917520","1920160"," Ooh, nice. Let me check."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1924160","1926640"," Check CTA. What am I doing here? I'm doing something wrong here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1927600","1930320"," Yeah, I'm not seeing that on my end, man. That's possible."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1930880","1937680"," Maybe it was profit taking, but I'm not seeing like, I'm not seeing like net sellers anywhere."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1939520","1942800"," That's possible. I'm not into that. It's statement."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1942800","1945360"," Either. I just, I'm not seeing it on what I've gotten in front of me back here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1949360","1952640"," You've got a contract role. So folks are moving around."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1953200","1955200"," Yeah, I think there are people moving around,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1955280","1958960"," but I think it's more of a function of like, is it dealers doing that?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1958960","1963680"," Or is it market? I guess you could say market participants, but"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1964720","1968640"," is it dealers de-heading themselves? Maybe? I don't know. I don't know who it who it is."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1968640","1971600"," I guess I'm questioning who it is. I'm not saying it's not true."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1971600","1974560"," Saying I want to know who actually is doing that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1976640","1982880"," Coming down into 509.53. It heard me say that I was looking for but 508 ish."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1982880","1986160"," Somewhere in there, this S2 is saying 50660."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1986800","1989440"," We'll see if we can slam down in there and find that next."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1989440","1992160"," I'm going to bring up that gamma profile for you again."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1992160","1994480"," I'm going to lock this thing in right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1995040","1999840"," Yeah, just so you can see where some of these targets are in a better way."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","1999840","2004880"," We are now testing currently the 20 million block."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2004880","2017200"," And SPX down below at 5100. Let's go where the next layer is down below here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2018160","2020160"," You know, this looks kind of bearish. I mean, look at this, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2020160","2022560"," They're trying, dude. Let's go down there and look at this really quick."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2024240","2027760"," You got like, you got like, um, you got like bears or like, they're,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2028400","2032080"," they're in closure right now and they're like scooping up all the shit and throwing"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2032160","2034560"," across them to the to the clear glass."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2042560","2044240"," You can see them right here, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2044240","2049440"," They're just like flinging shit down on you like down to the depths of hell, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2049440","2052720"," Down to the depths of hell, right? Just throwing bombs down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2052720","2057520"," Down, just down, down, get underneath down, down, down, down, get underneath, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2058320","2061040"," Just like a lot of that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2061040","2062640"," But there is a gap down here to close."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2062640","2063760"," Just be aware of that one."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2063760","2071280"," See this gap down below. That's at 5080, 5080 down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2071280","2073040"," This is the one that I really want to see."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2073040","2075280"," I really want to see like this right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2077040","2078880"," So that's that 508 on spy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2079680","2083600"," There is a little bit of a price difference through the contract role."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2083600","2084640"," That's happening right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2085120","2087760"," So bring me more blood."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2087760","2088720"," I guess that's the point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2088720","2089440"," Give me more blood."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2089440","2089760"," Here we go."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2089760","2090560"," We got more blood coming."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2091920","2092960"," Bring me more doom."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2095280","2096960"," Now we're going to talk about some of the,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2096960","2098480"," let's look at some layers down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2099840","2101520"," Right down there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2101520","2103040"," Let's see if we can get that down there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2103040","2104400"," So we can tag that bad boy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2105120","2105920"," What does that one have?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2109120","2111280"," It's a 5150."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2114640","2120880"," A good drop in the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2123040","2124880"," You know what this I didn't put this in."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2124880","2131840"," So I didn't put this in the market brief yesterday, but I wanted to."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2133440","2139360"," There is, if you want to see something really cool of recent,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2141040","2142640"," I would be looking back at"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2144640","2156320"," I would be looking back at December of 2020, December of 2020."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2158320","2161920"," And then the, then the following year."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2164640","2166240"," There was, it was really fascinating."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2167520","2170160"," As it came into December of 2020."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2170720","2176080"," See, Sam, you see was say, they like rolled out a package where."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2179680","2181760"," I think our K rolled over."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2184000","2188960"," And Sam, you see, was pushing a narrative of pay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2189840","2192880"," People are taking their winnings and running from our K,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2193440","2197680"," but you should buy by ArcG or you should buy Arc."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2197680","2198240"," I don't know."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2198240","2199360"," Nobody's body yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2200560","2201280"," Arc, whatever."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2202080","2207840"," And in reality, what was happening was all of the spec growth,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2207840","2210160"," stuff or anything that ran higher."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2211840","2213840"," There was like, I'm taking the money and running,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2213840","2220480"," but they were these investors were pushing their money into safer or unloved"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2221440","2225520"," stock stickers and indexes, just a safer trade."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2227040","2228720"," I think we're kind of there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2228720","2229920"," It's like that middle."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2229920","2232560"," I think I might, I don't know if I said this last night or I deleted it,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2232560","2238960"," but I wanted to say to people, we're entering the middle to in late stage of a bull run."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2239600","2246320"," And normally when we get that middle to late stage of a bull run, you get expansion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2248320","2253920"," And you, we still go up and get new highs, but you get like range expansion,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2253920","2256560"," you get new low, new big lows, new big highs."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2258720","2260960"," In the indexes specifically."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2262320","2267040"," So this could be a time period where if someone's out there going, you know, whoa."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2268800","2271040"," I took this ride from $10."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2271040","2272640"," It's now worth a thousand."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2273760","2280480"," You may want to get out of that stuff and look for a decent buying opportunity with less"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2281120","2283840"," exposure to speculation."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2284800","2288480"," And we may be in that part of the, of the bull run."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2288480","2290320"," If you disagree with that, let me know."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2291520","2294960"," I'm fascinated to know if you think that the bull run will last."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2296640","2300320"," Let's say deeper than March of 2025."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2300320","2304560"," If you, if you think, hey, Cap, this rally extends past that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2305840","2310320"," Let me know what your thesis is or just say something in the chat if you want."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2311280","2314400"," If you think that's the case, because I think as we get into this mid to late,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2316640","2322320"," slightly not a price things in, even if we're going to have a bull run that extends into,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2322320","2327920"," let's say late 2025 or 2026 or something like that, maybe you think it's longer."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2328880","2334000"," I think they're going to price in like, Hey, marches are, are, you know, like,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2334000","2336480"," that's the end right there somewhere in March max."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2336480","2339920"," That means we're going to get shit done by December."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2340400","2346800"," And if that's the case, we get a broadening of, of the markets into that time frame."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2346800","2348480"," Buckle up was what I would say to you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2355680","2359680"," Remember one of those guys, Pope mentioned the pullback in the last week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2360880","2362640"," Um, I don't know."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2362640","2364880"," I don't, I don't know that we get the pullback."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2364880","2366240"," I think we get range expansion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2366800","2368000"," I think we could draw it out."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2368000","2368640"," Probably two."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2369200","2373280"," I think it's more of like a, like the usually late cycle bull, bull markets."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2374080","2375200"," We get more violent."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2376080","2377600"," We get a little wider range."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2379600","2382400"," We should at some point to start seeing divergences."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2383200","2384720"," It's part of like velocity too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2385440","2390000"," It should start to see some some divergence in velocity and higher time frames."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2390560","2397040"," Like a monthly velocity, your quarterly velocity, really your weekly velocity and your monthly velocity,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2397040","2400480"," though, those things should start to diverge from price setting higher."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2401120","2406960"," We haven't quite seen it yet, but that's part of that, uh, that broad, the broadening of the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2410240","2414080"," Everyone is running into, uh, running into Bitcoin."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2416000","2418480"," Uh, can we call that a pullback?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2418480","2422800"," No, you see your pullbacks right now are down to more good questions."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2422800","2431600"," So pullbacks for right now where the market is is to, uh, 50207, 50207, uh, we start to set up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2432560","2438080"," I guess you could go to 495, uh, but if it doesn't reject the daily trigger,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2438080","2439280"," we come back and blast through it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2439840","2440960"," Uh, that's still a pullback."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2440960","2445200"," I need to, you guys want to see what a, I already shown you guys our correction looks like."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2445760","2448000"," Um, we're not in a corrective environment just yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2448000","2448880"," I'd like to see one."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2448880","2450000"," I just don't, we're out there yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2452800","2459600"," We're down below waiting for self on good news and margin, dead exhaustion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2461040","2462080"," Uh, Damon, did I miss?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2462080","2463520"," I might have missed what you were saying, brother."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2463520","2465600"," I can't read, I just heads up out there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2465600","2472000"," So I only see like the four or five of the questions or things you guys are chatting about."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2472000","2473360"," So sometimes I miss the chat."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2473600","2476560"," Um, it's hard for me to do it all at the same time."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2476560","2478320"," I apologize if I miss any of your questions."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2478320","2480560"," Uh, Damon Garrett's especially."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2483280","2486240"," Dude, all S2 is 506 for today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2486240","2486560"," Yes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2488160","2490640"," Five, oh no, sorry, 502.07."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2491280","2491920"," That's what I've got."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2494000","2495360"," No, that's what I've got for today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2496320","2501600"," You can also go, also go into your, um, you can go into the, um,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2501600","2504720"," cog whale and change it from Fibonacci to traditional."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2504720","2506000"," I think I'm on trad right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2506800","2508080"," Yeah, I'm on traditional pivots."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2508080","2508720"," I think right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2509440","2509840"," Let me look."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2510560","2511840"," Yeah, I'm on traditional pivots."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2513040","2520240"," So for spy that what I have for spy traditional pivots this morning is, uh, 502.07."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2530080","2531520"," Uh, what are you saying here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2532080","2532880"," That right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2532880","2534800"," That's the thing that keeps giving me hope."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2534800","2537600"," The guys that say we're not in a corrective environment yet,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2537600","2543280"," because if you guys like UCAP or say we were then, it is likely wouldn't happen."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2544000","2549840"," Um, I don't know what you, um, I'd probably need more information on that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2550480","2560640"," Um, I've seen too many times, uh, man, it's hard like to describe this."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2561520","2563920"," Uh, I would say with time and market,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2563920","2568880"," you realize that I would say with time, not that you don't have time,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2568880","2571760"," market, turkey, McNugget at all, just, um,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2574240","2577360"," you know, when you're a buyer dips in a seller of rips,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2577360","2583040"," some of it has to do with, um, negative, uh, gamma, but in truth, um,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2584000","2586320"," there's momentum that needs to get behind."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2590560","2592560"," Oh, it's okay, but I, I do turkey."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2592560","2593200"," I love you, man."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2593280","2595440"," Um, you're, I'm a bull, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2595440","2596000"," That's okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2596000","2597760"," It's hard like to."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2597760","2598480"," That's okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2598480","2600000"," I love you for that much of a bull you are,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2600000","2601680"," but in order for a real drop to happen,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2601680","2605200"," I need guys like you not believe it's actually going to happen."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2605760","2606480"," Uh, okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2606480","2607200"," I get what you're saying."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2607840","2609040"," Uh, I think I do."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2609040","2609680"," It could be wrong."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2611440","2612880"," Uh, they're turkey."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2612880","2613840"," I agree with you on this."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2614240","2615600"," Uh, one, I think I do."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2617200","2619600"," Um, I don't know."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2619600","2621280"," It's hard to explain market sentiment."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2621520","2623280"," Uh, market sentiment is a weird thing, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2624560","2630160"," Uh, we need people to believe that I agree with you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2630160","2633360"," We need people to be, uh, unhedged in the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2635360","2636560"," To some extent, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2636560","2638000"," For that window to open."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2638000","2639280"," Like people aren't scared."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2639280","2641760"," I guess you're talking about like we're down 200 points one day."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2643040","2646640"," Um, I don't know if we're in that environment."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2646960","2650560"," Um, but I do know that sentiment can change quickly."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2651200","2654080"," Uh, and that does have a material or it seems to have a material"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2654080","2656240"," or has been having a material impact in the market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2656880","2661200"," When sentiment changes, at least for price velocity, uh, down or up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2662800","2665840"," Uh, you know, there's another thing at play here too, turkey."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2666400","2672640"," Uh, the information today is so much cleaner than it ever was."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2672640","2674720"," Like if you went back on the old boards,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2675920","2679120"," people would like show you a lot of this stuff and be like,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2679120","2682880"," who wouldn't be like something like a, like a one line on a chart."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2682880","2686320"," It would be like, oh, I got an, I got an Excel spreadsheet here for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2686320","2687760"," It's like 4,000 pages."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2688400","2691440"," Uh, and you can figure out and figure this out on your own."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2691600","2694640"," Um, today the communication, the level of communication out there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2695360","2699680"," Uh, there's like that whole like fucking, that the sentiment shit is wild to me."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2700320","2703600"," It's like everybody knows that the market's going up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2703600","2705760"," Everybody knows the market is going down."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2706400","2707760"," Uh, all at the same time."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2708480","2714800"," Um, so it takes like, takes like real money selling to actually move this shit down, doesn't it?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2715200","2718560"," Um, or real panic or a real event."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2726080","2726400"," Yeah."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2727760","2730000"," Is the market, the market's coming for them eventually."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2730000","2731280"," You know, I got to say that though too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2731280","2737520"," Like, I understand your sentiment, but, uh, we were told that in October."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2738160","2741440"," Of 2022, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2742480","2746000"," Uh, we were told that then, uh, we're going to crash down to the depths of hell."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2746560","2754160"," The truth was when we rolled in January, um, we did a whole show on like, you have a 60% of this pullback."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2754960","2758000"," You got like a 30% chance of that pullback."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2758000","2762560"," You got a, about a 15% chance of this number and a 5% chance of that number."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2762560","2766400"," The closer we get to those numbers, yeah, you're in your, your odds increase from there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2766880","2769360"," Um, but then we went down there and hit those numbers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2770240","2775680"," Uh, we were also told like, you're going to pay and you're going to, uh, you know, one of these days,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2776400","2780480"," um, there was only been a few of those instances."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2781040","2785360"," Like you've got the, you got the, you've got, um, the depression."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2786800","2792960"," You've got World War II, uh, 2007 to 2008."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2792960","2799920"," Uh, you got the second leg down, but even when you did, like even when Mike Barry got that second leg down,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2801200","2807360"," uh, when he started calling at the mark, where the market went before the second leg down even came,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2808160","2810240"," um, it was a long time."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2810240","2812720"," Like there was so much money left on the table."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2813360","2820400"," Um, so we're talking basically about a major event like, uh, World Wars, you're basically,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2820480","2823120"," in theoretically, you're saying we need a World War"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2824560","2832240"," or we need tires burning down, uh, broadened 50th, 50th, uh, the middle of New York City."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2832240","2834320"," That would be number two. That's like a depression, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2834320","2838320"," Like you're basically asking for, uh, depression, uh, World War"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2838960","2845760"," or you're asking for, uh, fraud to come out in the market, uh, something like that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2846640","2848640"," This is more than a tech bubble."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2848640","2852880"," This is more than, um, the end of a bull run, normal bull run."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2852880","2856880"," You're asking really truly for, um, that to happen."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2856880","2858240"," Do I think it can happen?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2858800","2866400"," Uh, sure, I do, uh, but until it happens, uh, that fraud comes out or there's a major news event,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2866960","2867920"," it shouldn't happen."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2867920","2872960"," Uh, they'll abuse this system until they fucking break it, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2872960","2875360"," So you're either gonna get one of those events"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2876720","2885200"," or you're going to get, uh, the abuse of the stock market, uh, until it happens."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2885840","2889440"," Uh, that's famous, the stock, the stock market's about a greed, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2890000","2895360"," Uh, so they ramp shit, they break shit, they, the, the, the, the, like, sucky buses, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2896000","2901440"," Um, so you have to, so you have to put the skin in the game until that happens,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2901520","2902240"," this is my point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2902800","2906480"," Um, and when it happens, you have to know when to leave, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2906480","2910720"," The market, how do you exit properly, um, the markets?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2910720","2911760"," We know how to do that too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2911760","2913600"," We've, we'll talk to you about it sometime."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2913600","2919280"," We'll show you, um, when the market is risk off, when the market is risk on again."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2919840","2926080"," Now it's a cross of the, uh, daily trigger, the weekly trailer trigger below the monthly trigger."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2926720","2931120"," When that happens, you should always go, um, risk off the markets."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2931760","2934240"," Until that resolves itself."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2934880","2939280"," And what's fascinating about that too, is there's always one more chance to exit the"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2939280","2944960"," markets in a, um, in an orderly manner, seeing that price action."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2944960","2945840"," But we're not there yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2946400","2947760"," Uh, we don't have that yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2947760","2950080"," So to call it, you'd be broke, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2951040","2953920"," Um, so you, like, we are in the stock markets."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2953920","2955920"," We are participants in the stock market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2956720","2960960"," Um, so until that shows itself where we see that price action, uh, even then,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2961440","2964400"," even if you're not a buyer, it's like, you've got like, I'm a buyer of dips."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2965040","2966320"," I'm a seller of rips."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2966960","2970640"," And then you get into the phase of, uh, we are risk off."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2971360","2975600"," The markets, like run, or look for, look for an orderly exit."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2976080","2977440"," Um, we're in a bear market."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2978000","2980320"," Um, so we're not there yet either."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2980320","2983680"," So, um, do I think one day they'll pay maybe?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2984320","2984960"," Yeah, I do."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2985520","2988480"," Um, I'm with, I saw Palk over the weekend."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2988480","2991280"," So like all last week, Palk was, um,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2991520","2998800"," making cryptic posts, uh, not, not cryptic, but you wouldn't necessarily know what he was talking about"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","2999440","3005200"," unless you've read some books on economics and the cult of economics."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3005840","3008880"," And specifically modern monetary theory."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3008880","3014080"," And then he eventually started saying more or posting more and more uncryptic posts."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3015280","3018480"," Uh, but I'm in the camp with that, uh, cult of economics."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3019120","3020480"," Uh, there are the,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3021040","3024480"," if you, if you get a degree in economics, you follow one of the cults."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3025520","3031280"," And one of the cults right now that's out there, uh, is the cult of modern monetary theory."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3031920","3035840"," And these people will push that theory until it breaks."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3036560","3040560"," Uh, they base, they're basing their entire career off of that shit."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3041200","3043840"," Uh, they're, they're smarter, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3045040","3048400"," Yeah, I get, I get, I understand, I understand you guys are in the other cult."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3048400","3050640"," I understand. I've been there. I've, I've been the same guy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3051280","3054400"," Uh, none of this makes sense. This is a fucking fraud."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3056560","3058400"," And then I think eventually at some point,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3060080","3062080"," you, uh, what's the other thing that happens, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3062080","3064320"," I know this is a fraud, but I'm going to accept it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3065760","3070000"," Can you like get absorbed? Oh, you know what it reminds me of? Uh, it reminds me of the matrix."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3070640","3076240"," Do you guys remember when the guy in the matrix is like, uh, all I want is a fucking steak."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3079360","3083520"," Do you remember that? Like the one guy's like, uh, the guy's like,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3083520","3087680"," I don't want to fucking live down here in the sewers anymore. I just want to buy a fucking steak."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3093360","3095760"," Except the Ponzi and buy it exactly."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3098000","3103760"," We just said that brawling, brawling in the mail or brawling the mail eventually."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3104560","3108960"," You just say fucking I'm buying the Ponzi. And when we roll, I'll be ready."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3108960","3113520"," But until then, uh, play the Ponzi. Otherwise, I'm going to get fucked here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3116480","3119040"," Let's see what's going on, I don't know, on a closer level down here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3120000","3122320"," Do you guys know what I'm saying at least? Like,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3124160","3130720"," you'll, you'll lose. Not you. There, you might hear, you might hear, um, what are those stories"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3130720","3135600"," called? You might hear, uh, anecdotal stories of, of, of bears that say,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3136400","3140720"," and not all bears, but you'll hear an adult, little stories of, well, I can operate in here as a"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3140720","3145840"," seller. I think that's true. People are like, they can, they can operate as a seller. Uh, but"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3145840","3153040"," you're never going to find the doom bear that's saying they're making a living, uh, as a bear."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3153040","3158240"," It's impossible. If you, no offense, uh, only cause by the way, I like cause, I enjoy what he"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3158240","3162320"," writes, but, you know, I think when they, when they write the, like the, the weekly chart of the"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3162320","3168800"," S&P 500, it's like a straight bar down to the depths of L. And it's not really like that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3168800","3175840"," You bring up like a six month bar chart of the, um, of the, uh, NY, I think it's NYCA, right? The"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3175840","3182320"," New York, uh, NYA or something. I mean, I forget the ticker name, but if you look at the composite"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3182400","3189520"," of the entire stock market over like since like day one, it's very rare to have red bar, one year"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3189520","3195760"," bar charts, six month bar charts. We just had one. Um, they're very rare going back to the start of"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3195760","3201440"," the stock market. Um, maybe I'll bring one of those at the NYA chart. I'm thinking I'm talking about."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3204800","3209440"," Yeah, no, no, no offense to you guys either. If you're a bear or a seller, like, I got no,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3209520","3214720"," I love bears. I love sellers. Um, I don't trade as well from the south side. I'd trade better from"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3214720","3220240"," the bear on the bull side. Um, completely aware of that too, right? Um, there used to be a bear."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3220880","3224960"," Uh, I've lost a lot of money being a bear, but more money losing. I've lost more money as a bear"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3224960","3230560"," than as a bull too. Um, in some significant ways. Um, so even when I take an L as a bull,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3231280","3238560"," nowhere near the L's have taken as a, as a, as a, as a, as a bear. I got wrapped up, man. I'd be like,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3238560","3242960"," I'd go right down that fucking hole. I'd drink that fucking Kool-Aid. And I'm like, this is the"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3242960","3251200"," one. It's happening fucking, let it all ride. Fascinatingly enough too, right? I let it all ride and"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3251200","3256240"," diamond hand more as a bear. Do you guys ever find that out? Like I was like, from the bear stance,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3256240","3261920"," I'm like, yeah, I'm fucking short, man. Um, and I'm like, I'm like, this is happening. That should"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3261920","3265600"," have go right again. I'm like, that's coming right back down. Don't worry about it. Even my,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3265600","3269920"," even my mentality is different. Um, from that, from that perspective."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3272000","3278800"," It really is, to be honest, like, uh, so yeah, I buy the Ponzi. I buy the fraud, uh, have to."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3280640","3289600"," Um, I do, uh, I'll prepare for the Ponzi to crash. Um, when that starts to happen, like, um, but,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3289600","3297040"," but until it happens, until we see it happen, um, I got to buy the fucking fraud, man, it sucks."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3301040","3306800"," Yeah, the bear intoxication is strong. It's the smart. I can't say it's not, right? It's the"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3306800","3312640"," smart, uh, perspective. If you sit there and listen to a bear, you're like, that shit makes sense."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3312640","3318800"," I'm like that. I'm like, that fucking guy's right. We're totally fucked here. Um, so I get like,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3318800","3324080"," from a technical analysis, like, or a fundamental, not technical, from a fundamental analysis,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3324720","3329120"," it's, um, it's striking. Uh, how much sense it actually makes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3332320","3337200"," Yeah, it's like a drug. It's like a fucking drug when you win. Uh, it is. It's like a fucking"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3337200","3340880"," drug. And once it gets its hands around you, it's like, it's like heroin or something."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3341600","3350240"," Yeah, it does. Uh, la, la, la, said I feel like you get what you pay for. Market generally goes up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3350240","3355120"," So being a bull makes more sense. Uh, but while being a bear is an overall losing strategy,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3355120","3358240"," if you get it right, you can make a ton in the short, in a short time. I grew with that too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3358800","3364400"," I'm not into that, that's steak. I always make a joke on if you guys ever hear me on, um,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3365280","3370080"," um, I've been doing this for years, I would say, when a bear, when a bear that knows how to"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3370080","3374720"," short with size, they will place their trades and literally close their fucking laptop."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3375360","3379520"," Uh, they don't want to hear into the bullshit out there. Um, they like place that trade and"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3379520","3382640"," they're like, I'm out. So I'm not going to do anything until this shit goes to the depth sale."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3390160","3393200"," Yeah, it's hard. Uh, it's hard to, it's not easy being a bear."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3394000","3394800"," Not an easy thing."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3397440","3401200"," Trying to get underneath this S1 right now in target 506 60."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3401200","3407120"," I'm looking for more like 508 ish. Uh, I'd like to see this get cleaned up right here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3407120","3409120"," Get a little bit of a dip down there. You see it down there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3410240","3413840"," I'd really like to see us get that last little roll right down there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3413840","3420240"," And then we start making our way higher. Um, so we'll keep an eye out, see if we can get down"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3420320","3423520"," there. I don't know what that relates to on a, on spy because I haven't,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3423520","3429840"," this roll thing is kind of wonky about 508 087 ish somewhere down there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3430400","3432320"," Let me get a little bit bigger here so you can see it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3436480","3438400"," Nice big moves in the market right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3443280","3448160"," Uh, you're a bull, but you get, uh, you get excited when this massive drop to buy dips."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3449120","3451680"," Uh, I'd always recommend the market breath for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3451680","3455680"," If you're a bull that needs to make money, um, that's where my make,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3455680","3459200"," most of my money in the market is from, uh, market breath."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3459200","3463600"," When we have, uh, liquidation moments in the market, that's when I usually step in with size."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3464880","3468320"," Yeah, as long, if we can trigger like minus, if we get to like 20 or less,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3469120","3472880"," uh, on the market breath, I will then begin to, uh, get really greedy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3478640","3480640"," That's cool, uh, brawl in the mall."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3481200","3482400"," It's a nice name too, by the way."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3484000","3487280"," G. That gold saying he's going to target a 50569."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3492160","3494080"," All right, I'm going to take a quick break with you guys."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3494480","3497280"," Um, I got to take a quick coffee break here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3497280","3498880"," Gonna stand up, do some stuff."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3499440","3502240"," Uh, we're not seeing anything to the upside right now as it is."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3502800","3503680"," Uh, so it is Monday."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3504240","3506160"," Uh, still looking for more downside to come."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3506960","3509200"," S2 down below at 50660."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3509760","3514640"," Um, I'm looking for a turn right around 508 if it goes down to 506 or 505 and find with that too."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3515280","3519120"," Uh, there could be some front running of vault two coming in to this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3519120","3520080"," So just be aware of that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3520080","3522560"," If everybody knows that there's volatility coming,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3523040","3525360"," that seems like everybody does know his volatility coming."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3525360","3527920"," Let them have their, uh, let them have their moment."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3528640","3534400"," Um, did I grab, uh, put spreads on Friday?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3534400","3538400"," No, so in the background right now, oh, you're asking somebody else."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3538960","3540320"," Uh, I don't know if that's me or somebody else."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3540320","3543280"," I'm not, I don't, I hadn't taken that trade into the close for today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3543280","3543520"," I did."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3543520","3547360"," We did talk about it though on Friday, uh, to expect more downside into Monday,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3547360","3555200"," but, uh, I didn't, mostly because I'm getting really, um, we're not getting in the background."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3555200","3561120"," I still have a lot going on at the launch and it still hasn't been, uh, stuff hasn't been finalized."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3561840","3562880"," Uh, things need change."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3562880","3565600"," We have fires going on that we have to fix and that kind of stuff."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3565600","3569760"," So, um, a lot of new coding, all kinds of craziness."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3569760","3574720"," So I'm still like, I'm still being pulled from, um, like I'm still not,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3574720","3576320"," I'm still sleeping like four hours a night."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3577040","3580160"," I'm like working still monster hours right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3581120","3582400"," Well, that was for trader podcast."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3582400","3582720"," Sweet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3582720","3583360"," All right, not me."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3584160","3584400"," All right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3584400","3586400"," I'll talk to you guys in just a little bit."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3586400","3590080"," I'm gonna put on some CNBC and I'll be right back with you guys in a few moments."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3593600","3594160"," Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3608400","3612800"," What is the timeline of events that will go from there, assuming it passes, which people do?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3614880","3616720"," I think everybody assumes that it passes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3616720","3617040"," Yes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3617040","3619440"," And then it will come into effect in a sequence."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3619440","3623040"," The first thing to come in effect is the ban of certain uses of AI,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3623040","3627920"," like social scoring systems, like embedding AI in toys that could have a"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3627920","3633920"," adverse effect for children, uh, like the ban of, uh, live facial recognition,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3633920","3636400"," uh, surveillance in public space."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3636400","3641040"," And then, uh, the watermarking of, uh, of artificial intelligence comes into effect."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3641040","3643360"," This is the EU, by the way, not the U.S."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3644160","3647200"," Careful as to what will happen before it comes into effects."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3647680","3652080"," And we are in dialogue with a big tech that has signed up to make sure that"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3652080","3656400"," watermarking is indeed available, because this is the biggest election year."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3656400","3660000"," I think no one has escaped that fact on the planet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3660000","3665200"," And of course, it is really important that the platforms, uh, they enable us to see"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3665200","3668800"," what is real and what is made by artificial intelligence."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3668800","3670800"," But shouldn't you be working with the U.S."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3670800","3675440"," here on, on, on a law like this at this stage of the technology?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3675440","3677840"," I know that a number of big European companies,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3677840","3680880"," Hine again, or no, they penned a letter saying that,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3680880","3684800"," that you're risking European competitiveness going at this, in part, alone."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3686880","3690160"," We've been working with the U.S. since the very first meeting of our trade and"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3690160","3694000"," technology council to have the same approach, uh, to artificial intelligence,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3694000","3698000"," which is not to regulate technology, but to regulate the use of technology."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3698000","3702880"," And that also means that innovation, research, uh, all of that is not touched"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3702880","3704480"," by the, uh, AI act."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3704480","3708480"," It is when you put it into use and the points, uh, of our regulation."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3708480","3711760"," Someone was asking me earlier what my target was on QQQ."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3711760","3715840"," It's, uh, 430, 430 use cases."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3715840","3718560"," We have very big, uh, public sectors in Europe."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3718560","3723840"," And they should be part of the, uh, demand, uh, sort of, uh, push for, uh,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3723840","3725520"," the use of artificial intelligence."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3725520","3730160"," And obviously no public sector service can have a bias towards one gender or"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3730160","3732480"," another. Uh, one more thing here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3732480","3735280"," I'm going to mute this, uh, person speaking in the background."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3735280","3737760"," Well, let me ask you guys a quick question here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3737760","3739200"," If you are, hold on here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3740880","3742160"," Hold on a second here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3744160","3744960"," Hold on here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3747600","3748000"," All right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3748000","3749760"," So they meet that thing."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3751040","3751440"," Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3751440","3754960"," So if you guys want me to bring up some charts this morning,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3755680","3758960"," if you have some, if you're a subscriber or whatever out there,"

"NxKhiMdI8uA","3777600","3778720"," Make it nice and clean for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3778720","3779760"," This is a one minute chart."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3783040","3785040"," We'll do the 30 minute chart on cues."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3785040","3796800"," If you are a, uh, if you are a pro or sub sub trader, what do you guys want to see for,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3797600","3801680"," uh, tickers to rotate on this bottom screen down below today?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3801680","3802720"," What do you guys got for me?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3803680","3806320"," Any guys want to see a specific ticker down there today?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3815200","3815760"," Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3819760","3821120"," NVDA is one of them."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3821120","3822400"," You guys are asking for NVDA."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3827040","3829440"," XBI and IWM Tesla."

"NxKhiMdI8uA","3938160","3938400"," All right."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3938400","3939760"," I can only put up like five of these."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3939760","3941200"," I can't put up like a thousand of them."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3943200","3944560"," Spy squeezing right now."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3946560","3953840"," Remember, I said 508 and this is a 50861 looking juicy here, boys."

"NxKhiMdI8uA","3958640","3960320"," Let's just do that right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3961440","3963360"," Switch on over to a 30 minute chart."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3963920","3965600"," Slow this bad boy down a little bit."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3967520","3968960"," I think that's bottom right there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3968960","3969520"," I could be wrong."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3970080","3970960"," I think that's bottom."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3973280","3975520"," I think that's, I think that's your weekly low today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3977840","3980560"," You're going to hate me for saying that, but it's pretty close."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3980560","3981360"," It's probably it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3982320","3982880"," Okay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","3982880","3984400"," I'll be back with you in just a few moments."

"NxKhiMdI8uA","3994640","3996480"," Yeah, that being for a weekly low, dude,"

"NxKhiMdI8uA","3998880","4001040"," one month call or something."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4003200","4004720"," Get rid of them on, you know,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4004720","4007360"," get rid of them by the Friday or something like that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4007360","4009520"," You know, is this the weekly low right here?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4010560","4011760"," That's about it, dude."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4011760","4013360"," That's the one that I got targeted at least."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4013760","4014960"," You are a subscriber."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4016240","4018880"," I think that's 300 and something dollars a year."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4019440","4022320"," That basically means you're supporting what we do around here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4023040","4028560"," This is about where I tagged on the market brief last night for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4028560","4031040"," You get those for me every day when we need them."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4032560","4034960"," So this is about the, it's about the area here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4044160","4045840"," Where do you guys want a 15 minute chart?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4045840","4046560"," Is that better?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4046560","4047840"," Maybe that's a little bit too slow."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4048560","4049600"," Look at the 15 minute."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4063120","4064400"," Now I'm going to turn this back on."

"NxKhiMdI8uA","4072080","4072960"," using a computer."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4073600","4074480"," It's available."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4075120","4078240"," Most other assets only trade less than 20% of the time."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4078240","4081200"," Bitcoin's trading 168 hours a week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4081200","4084400"," We bought 800 million dollars of Bitcoin."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4084400","4087760"," And a lot of it we bought over the weekend"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4087760","4089600"," when all the conventional markets are closed."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4090560","4092640"," Shares a micro strategy, of course, more than doubled."

"NxKhiMdI8uA","4095040","4098640"," Meantime got a target increase on coin from Jeffries."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4098640","4101280"," They were at 160 to go to 245."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4101360","4104560"," As a result of just the ecosystem enlarging at this point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4104560","4106400"," Chasing the rally of some of these."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4106400","4109120"," Let me ask you guys one more question in the,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4110400","4112560"," ask you guys one more question in the stream."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4114240","4116640"," What it could mean for your wallet next?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4116640","4117440"," Let me ask you guys."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4119840","4122880"," Let me ask you guys one more question in the stream this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4122880","4126160"," And let me know, write something in the stream about this, okay?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4128480","4129680"," I have a question for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4132240","4134880"," Do you guys have a target for ETH?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4137520","4140640"," You're looking at like 6,000 like what do you guys,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4140640","4143200"," what do you guys have for a ETH target?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4143200","4144560"," Let me know in the chat please."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4162240","4166960"," Last year, 5,800 was your target since middle of last year."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4167520","4171680"," So would you be trying to get out of ETH at 5,800 trader podcast?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4171680","4179360"," Or would you be trying to get out of ETH at 6,000 from last year?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4180560","4186000"," We'll take a look at it today, I think."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4191280","4216400"," Yeah, thanks for that insight, trader podcast."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4221280","4234880"," You guys even hear me out there?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4234880","4237920"," Okay, I don't know if you guys heard any of the discuss,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4237920","4243360"," maybe I was just talking to myself just the heads up here at 1030."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4243360","4249360"," The Fed Reserve, there's a poll that the Fed Reserve out of cut rates by 70 BPS or less"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4250080","4258800"," in 2024, say 52 of 108 economists, 26 say more cuts, 100 BPS."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4259840","4268640"," The Federal Reserve to first cut the Fed funds rate in June, say 72 out of 108 economists,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4268640","4271280"," we do have a rate decision coming up here in March."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4272560","4274960"," Now the question becomes the closer we get, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4275120","4280960"," So like start, I wouldn't be thinking so much about this rate decision,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4281600","4288560"," but we should probably have a discussion about the next rate decision, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4288560","4291200"," Because they do begin to price this stuff in."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4291840","4294480"," And that's a big question mark from me."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4295360","4299120"," We'll go to the 5-minute chart, take a look at that, see what's going on up here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4299120","4306640"," There's a 5-minute chart right now on still trying to pound it down."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4308000","4308960"," Still trying here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4310560","4313600"," I have a question though about, so we're going to start cycling through here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4313600","4317200"," I'm Contessa Brewer with your CNBC news secretary of state."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4317200","4320640"," It's trying to, I wanted to pause it yesterday."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4321360","4325040"," Go back to a 1-minute chart here, this is a 1-minute chart on spy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4326000","4331120"," What I wanted to ask you guys about in the market brief last night was"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4332080","4335520"," humanitarian aid ship Ban for Gaza is facing a third day of delay."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4335520","4338320"," I wanted to ask you guys about IWM."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4338960","4343760"," 200 tons of food and the front running that goes on in tickers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4344320","4351120"," And my question to you is, back in November, December,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4351120","4355360"," here to receive aid off the gosh, there was a front running of."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4355360","4358080"," Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4358080","4360160"," the anticipation of a rate cut."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4360160","4368640"," And it's impact on small caps and shutdowns began across the country."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4368640","4370480"," COVID-19 has now killed more than."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4370480","4371600"," It didn't matter."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4371600","4373680"," How do I say this so that I don't anger people?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4373680","4375120"," More than 1 million."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4375120","4378480"," It doesn't matter if you get the rate cut or not."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4379360","4381360"," How do I avoid those symptoms of the long curve?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4381360","4384320"," It does matter if they try to front run."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4385600","4392480"," That it does matter if they front run it, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4392480","4394640"," So the thesis here would be,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4397760","4400400"," we come into this rate decision, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4401520","4404880"," And you've got the vol associated with it, the doom and gloom."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4405840","4409200"," And in reality, when do they begin?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4409200","4413120"," And my question would be if you're a bear out there"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4414080","4417360"," and you've got all your doom with this rate decision."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4418560","4420000"," Check out shares of Facebook."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4420000","4425360"," When do they begin to front run the expected rate cut for June?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4426400","4427600"," And where would that most,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4428800","4431920"," and what index would be most impacted by that"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4432800","4434960"," in terms of the bullish outcome?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4434960","4438080"," It's likely going to be IWM."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4438080","4439840"," And that would benefit the most."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4439840","4441440"," It was just introduced last week."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4441440","4442320"," Right there, the ZwM."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4442320","4443120"," The committee mark up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4443120","4446400"," XBI and VDA, SPX, gamma, cues."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4446400","4447840"," This measure should be good."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4447840","4449200"," Now you're going to expect to have it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4449200","4450160"," Let me ask you guys that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4450160","4453440"," That should be a topic of discussion, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4453440","4454480"," We've honed in on meta,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4454480","4455680"," and that's kind of in the source"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4455680","4458000"," for most of his comments on this TikTok ban."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4458000","4460080"," The front running rate cuts."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4460640","4462240"," He did try to ban TikTok,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4462240","4463760"," and it was a national security."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4463760","4465360"," Buy as a do-or-die place."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4465360","4467040"," They concerned for lawmakers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4467040","4468400"," This is the reason they're putting that up."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4468400","4469600"," Were you right there?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4469600","4473040"," The question here is, is the bill going to be narrowly?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4473040","4474160"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4474160","4475920"," So a couple of discussions for you."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4477040","4479280"," The next discussion is going to be"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4479280","4482320"," about the front running."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4482320","4483600"," It'll be named in the bill."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4483600","4485200"," There's a conditional question."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4485200","4487120"," The actual rate cut after this."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4487840","4489360"," Wait a minute, here I'm getting some volcanoes."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4489920","4492560"," And then, of course, the discussion."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4492560","4494800"," And then we'll talk about TikTok later."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4495440","4497360"," But I want to hear what you have to say about TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4497360","4498800"," What I really want to know about is,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4499840","4502800"," do they front run at the rate cycle"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4502800","4507200"," that could positively impact specifically IWM?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4507200","4510480"," And when does that next front running begin?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4513120","4516480"," In DC right now around China and national security."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4517440","4519360"," Sorry, you know, TikTok's owner,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4519360","4521280"," ByteDance, obviously, is a private company, Emily."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4521280","4522880"," We've talked about it in a number of times,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4523840","4526640"," given its enormous size, despite being private."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4527600","4530080"," And we're already speculating at this point"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4530080","4534480"," about what ByteDance could do to retain value,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4534480","4538160"," so to speak, and meet the objections of lawmakers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4538160","4541600"," I'll avoid the ban or do what needs to be done."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4541600","4542720"," Do we have a sense?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4542720","4544560"," Do they need to recreate the algorithm?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4544560","4546240"," The servers have to be in the United States."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4546240","4550480"," I remember going through a lot of this back in the fall of 2020,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4550480","4552480"," when we were also talking again,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4552480","4554320"," as you pointed out, when the Trump administration"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4554320","4555440"," was moving towards a ban."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4555440","4557120"," No, I mean, it's a very good question."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4557120","4559600"," And at this point, it really seems like ByteDance"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4559600","4561200"," is who this bill is targeted at."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4561200","4563120"," You had a couple lawmakers even come out and say,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4563120","4564480"," look, we love TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4564480","4566160"," We know our constituents love TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4566160","4567680"," We don't want to ban TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4567680","4571200"," What we want to ban is the ability for a Chinese company"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4571200","4574640"," to get all this data that TikTok collects on its users."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4574640","4577280"," And that is really at the heart of the concern here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4577280","4578880"," So as far as what ByteDance can do,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4578880","4580080"," I mean, look, they've said,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4580080","4583440"," they've already said previously that they're not going to divest TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4584080","4585440"," They've tried some other things,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4585440","4588080"," Project Texas building servers in the U.S."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4588080","4591760"," But it just really has not been enough for Congress at this point."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4591760","4594800"," And that's why you are kind of seeing this groundswell of support."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4594800","4597280"," Now, of course, there is some larger government studies"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4597280","4598800"," going on into TikTok,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4598800","4602080"," into exactly how much of a national security threat that poses."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4602080","4604640"," Those have been underway now for more than a year."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4604640","4607520"," But lawmakers have said, look, we have enough concerns."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4607520","4609280"," We've heard enough. We've seen enough."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4609280","4612400"," We think that it's time to sort of put this ultimatum on the line."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4612400","4614000"," We don't have to ban TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4614000","4617040"," It's just that TikTok and ByteDance need to separate."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4617040","4621360"," I just wanted to also throw in some context around the Trump bashing of meta"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4621360","4624240"," and saying that it was the enemy of the people."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4624240","4627280"," I mean, in a way, not super surprising, right?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4627280","4631840"," Because Facebook banned Trump at one time from using its platform."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4631840","4637440"," Also, there was this narrative going around that Emily,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4637440","4640480"," that Mark Zuckerberg donated $400 million, excuse me,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4640480","4645280"," to help get President Biden elected when it turns out that the donation"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4645280","4650240"," was actually to two nonprofit organizations that were helping with elections,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4651040","4653760"," conservatives think they helped with Biden."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4653760","4655440"," So there are a few threads out there."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4655440","4659040"," I feel like that are important context for the meta bashing."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4659040","4661200"," But interestingly, the stock went down on it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4661200","4665440"," And you do wonder what a Trump presidency would mean for a company like that"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4665440","4666480"," when he has beef with them."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4666480","4670320"," I mean, it's not surprising to see Trump kind of going after those who he feels"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4670320","4672160"," has wronged him or hasn't been loyal to him."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4672160","4674880"," That was certainly a trend that we saw with his presidency."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4674880","4678560"," But look, you're already seeing reporting that there are folks who are interested"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4678560","4679760"," in buying TikTok."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4679760","4683280"," They really haven't seen meta kind of entered that part of the discussion yet."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4683280","4684640"," Doesn't mean they won't, of course."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4685200","4688160"," But I think there is kind of a question that if ByteDance tries to"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4688240","4691280"," divest TikTok, what is that going to mean for TikTok's future?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4691280","4693440"," Certainly a really profitable country."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4693440","4696400"," Lawmakers have suggested that maybe a media company could buy it."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4696400","4698640"," This has kind of been pitched as a news organization."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4698640","4704480"," We've heard lawmakers kind of say we see China's ownership of ByteDance and"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4704480","4709680"," of TikTok being similar to say if China came in and bought NBC, CNBC,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4709680","4711920"," and those news media organizations."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4711920","4714720"," Yeah, but it gets back to a very more difficult thing to ascertain,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4714720","4716720"," which is do you get to keep the algorithm or not,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4716720","4719360"," which obviously is one of the really the key asset in many ways."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4719360","4720960"," Otherwise, you're buying a user base."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4721680","4723600"," You got to recreate the algorithm."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4724560","4727680"," That's sort of the side that I'm going to keep working on Emily as well."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4727680","4730080"," So trying to understand from ByteDance's perspective,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4730080","4732080"," what it can do to try and retain value for obviously,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4732080","4736160"," what is an incredibly profitable platform largely in the US,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4736160","4738480"," therefore contributing to ByteDance's value Sarah,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4738480","4742640"," that's some 220 billion, even with the discount perhaps being applied"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4742640","4744880"," as a result of these fears about a ban here in the US."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4744880","4745920"," Scale is enormous."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4746560","4747360"," Thank you, Emily."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4748000","4751200"," President Biden set to unveil his budget proposal today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4751200","4753520"," Megan Cassella joins us now from the White House"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4753520","4755600"," with more on the president's priorities."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4755600","4756560"," Megan, what do we expect?"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4757680","4758240"," Hey, Sarah."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4758240","4760480"," So ahead of the full report being released later today,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4760480","4764880"," the White House is giving us a few more details on its 2025 budget plan."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4764880","4767440"," The administration says its proposal will cut the deficit"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4767440","4770160"," by roughly $3 trillion over the next decade."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4770160","4773520"," That's a figure that Biden hinted at last week in the state of the union address."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4773520","4774640"," We'll see that today."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4774720","4778160"," On the spending side, he'll be calling for greater investment in manufacturing"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4778160","4779120"," and clean energy."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4779120","4781760"," He wants to strengthen Medicare and Social Security"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4781760","4783680"," and provide national paid leave."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4783680","4787200"," We're also expecting a focus on efforts to lower costs for families,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4787200","4790880"," in part through investments that would make child care and college more affordable,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4790880","4795440"," and he will propose a $400 monthly tax credit for some first-time home buyers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4795440","4798320"," On the revenue-raising side to pay for all that spending,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4798320","4800960"," this is something we also heard pushed in the state of the union,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4800960","4803760"," but Biden wants to put corporations on the hook here."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4803760","4806640"," He'll be raising the corporate minimum tax to 21 percent,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4806640","4808800"," cracked down on corporate profit sharing,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4808800","4812160"," and imposing a 25 percent minimum tax on billionaires."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4812720","4814240"," And guys, in the next couple of hours,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4814240","4817520"," we'll get specific numbers on exactly how much Biden plans to spend"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4817520","4819760"," and expects to raise through these plans."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4819760","4823440"," But for now, at least we can see his policy priorities heading into the election."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4823440","4824000"," Guys."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4824000","4826400"," Indeed, we'll be looking for the reaction on the Hill."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4826400","4828240"," As usual, thank you so much, Megan."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4828240","4829200"," Megan Cassella."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4829200","4832800"," As we take a break, check out some of the biggest gainers on the S&P this morning."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4832800","4836880"," Got some Moderna in there, a media as well, between Charter and Warner Brothers."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4836880","4838880"," But the Dow is down to 25. Stay with us."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4844800","4848640"," At the age of 16, my career ambition, career goal,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4848640","4851440"," was to be a commissioner of a professional sports league."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4851440","4855120"," So I feel really proud that I was able to achieve that."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4855120","4859520"," Our league is at this extremely pivotal and transformative moment,"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4859600","4864000"," where the world is recognizing the value of women."
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4864000","4870160"," And I'm just really humbled and appreciative of the opportunity to be able to shine a life"
"NxKhiMdI8uA","4870160","4876640"," on our league and everything that we've achieved to date and what's to come."
