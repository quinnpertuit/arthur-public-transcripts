"3850","4830"," Check 1-2."
"10300","11020"," All right."
"19950","22070"," Check 1-2. "
"28360","29440"," Come on, baby."
"30500","35620"," Let's see here."
"43520","44800"," Scrubbers. "
"46520","47800"," See."
"63650","64930"," Okay."
"76510","77370"," Copy. "
"86060","95640"," Let's see if we can switch right over to it."
"96800","97280"," Okay."
"97700","98860"," Give me just a second here, guys. "
"99820","100440"," Good morning."
"101200","102100"," Hope y'all had a great holiday."
"109420","109900"," PX. "
"118920","131140"," Good morning,"
"131140","131420"," everybody."
"132300","134080"," We've got a little bit of a..."
"135240","135980"," That's some..."
"135980","136460"," Wait a minute."
"137260","138460"," Let's see if that's going to work. "
"140180","142640"," We've got some walkiness going on with Twitter the past couple of days."
"144620","145360"," Good morning."
"145760","146680"," Good morning, Eric. "
"147080","148240"," Good morning, kid time."
"151160","152300"," Good morning, Binky."
"152920","153460"," Good morning, Mark. "
"154080","154360"," Herms."
"154860","154880"," Chase."
"156000","156820"," Yeah, we're doing great. "
"157020","157440"," Had a great holiday."
"158500","161060"," Good morning, fishing with Pan Dan."
"161700","162260"," Pan Fish Dan. "
"162900","163320"," Good morning, Liam."
"163580","164020"," Poor Badger."
"164020","164980"," G.M. Hiroshi. "
"165060","165420"," Winky face."
"165940","167120"," Johnny Moggs in the house."
"167220","168400"," Patrick Cruisins here. "
"168880","169740"," Good morning to all of you."
"171120","173420"," So we're going to take a quick look at the market this morning."
"174120","175980"," I just wanted to highlight a few things for you. "
"176160","183260"," So now, before the market opens today, we'll talk about Tesla at some point as well."
"184020","187360"," There was a giant gap in here."
"187640","189140"," There's a giant gap in here this morning. "
"190820","194000"," And that gap was closed just now, which is..."
"194020","195500"," Which is actually very productive."
"195960","198320"," I'm going to explain to you why here in just a moment."
"199640","200700"," I'm going to clean all that off. "
"200900","205180"," You can see, we remember on Friday that..."
"205180","206980"," I'll get this mic a little bit closer here."
"208620","214860"," So remember, we're trying to trade this up on Friday when we're having our holiday party here at"
"214860","215220"," this show."
"216280","217580"," We pushed this up here. "
"217860","220880"," We changed this color here."
"221500","226300"," And we had James Rowland on Friday."
"227020","229060"," And he was talking about triggers, right?"
"230080","232240"," And so we're talking about picking this up on Friday. "
"233120","237780"," And you saw the seller's just heavy and hard here on Friday, right?"
"237980","238520"," Picked it up again."
"239000","239900"," Picked it up again."
"240860","241900"," Picked it up again. "
"241900","247660"," And the overnight actually sent us higher."
"249340","251780"," So we got up and hit that 386 in the overnight."
"252680","255079"," And we had a gap that we left behind here. "
"255140","256880"," We actually just closed that gap down below."
"257760","263400"," But going with what James had said on Friday, we know where the squeeze is, right?"
"263540","264620"," We know where the trigger is."
"264620","267140"," So I've put here a bullish above. "
"267620","269320"," You'd expect the same thing today."
"269880","273160"," You need to get past these sellers here."
"273560","277500"," And you need to get past all this down with pressure that we're seeing here. "
"277820","285520"," Now, the other neat part is the difference today in Friday was that you remember on Friday we"
"285520","286160"," had..."
"286160","288320"," Our three was way up here at like 394."
"288940","294360"," So we're getting a little bit of compression today and a look below today."
"294660","297460"," You can actually see the support and resistance. "
"298100","305780"," The resistance has become tighter and there's more room for a dip to buy down below here today."
"306540","315080"," We want to look behind and see that we've got 37802 is previous low and then we've got a previous"
"315080","317160"," low back down here at S3 today."
"317160","320160"," So not seeing..."
"320160","325600"," We're seeing these sellers here and then the gap get closed and not immediately picked right back"
"325600","326360"," up here, right?"
"326980","333100"," It would seem at least logical to want to come back down at minimum and retest this pivot. "
"333580","335760"," You remember that this is still positive gamma on the day?"
"337040","341560"," And I would even like to see us come back down and retest this..."
"341560","343820"," Maybe this low down here at 37002."
"344240","346000"," Anything above here, it's positive."
"346120","347460"," We got a bounce here today. "
"347540","350140"," It could just be a slow grind up into the end of the year."
"351240","352160"," We're looking on this morning."
"352300","352740"," We'll go over. "
"352900","356540"," At some point today, we'll go over expectations into the 30th."
"357700","359420"," What to expect into the 30s."
"359520","361940"," There's a bunch of stuff we can look at and this is actually some other stuff. "
"362500","364940"," We'll take a look at some Tesla stuff this morning as well."
"364940","369220"," I just wanted to know, coming off the bell here, you're still positive gamma."
"369380","373500"," Anything above 32.39. And this was the same pivot. "
"374060","377640"," We're not quite pitted, but that push point that we had on Friday, right?"
"378540","379820"," That we need to start..."
"379820","381740"," Press to start making higher highs."
"382240","385500"," We really need to get above these sellers back here."
"386100","387620"," You're only going to get so many attempts. "
"387860","391600"," You're not going to get a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"391600","394500"," We got up the pajama traders, right?"
"394820","398060"," Veritably put us up here this morning to that 386."
"399200","401980"," And it was immediately sold off, right?"
"402380","404480"," So we talk about it on the show all the time."
"404840","411200"," If you can't get that traction, if you can't leg it up in pre-market and then off the bell,"
"411540","415080"," we're going to start looking for where real support is down below. "
"415080","420520"," We know that that first place for real support is down here at 37804."
"421060","423940"," We know that the next one is back here at 374."
"424460","428640"," If we start breaking through those levels, we've got some places, right?"
"431860","438520"," You can remember this move here, this nasty move that we had, that same kind of a spot, right?"
"438720","442600"," Remember we had this low here, another low here, we tagged it again. "
"443080","445840"," So is this, is it inevitable that we come all the way down here today?"
"446500","447260"," I don't know."
"447620","448500"," I don't think so."
"449540","451020"," I don't think we get that low today. "
"451400","458220"," I think my thought process in the end of the year, it's going to be a sideways and wide dip"
"458220","459780"," kind of environment until the 30th."
"459820","460560"," I could be wrong on that."
"461200","466360"," But I don't think that you're going to see mass selling into end of year. "
"466360","471500"," There's a couple of other things, the JPM collar spot or closes on the 30th."
"471840","473140"," JPM doesn't close that collar."
"474060","476220"," It could pin us right around that 38250. "
"476220","477640"," I think it is a 38230."
"478600","483800"," So you've got that pin effect here heading into the 30th that could happen."
"484400","488240"," And then you've also have the new year coming, right?"
"488400","492500"," You know that you still have some rotation that's going to take place into end of year. "
"492500","495380"," And that's part of what I'm looking at with Tesla."
"496320","504840"," I made a post last night about Tesla and about it going back to close some of these gaps."
"506440","511100"," I've got different instances of Tesla, but you can see these gaps down below here. "
"512419","518799"," And if you're going to, if you're going to put some money into the market, you know, are you going"
"518799","523059"," to put, you know, if we don't, we're at, I think we're down here at like, we're pretty lower, like"
"523059","524340"," one 16 or something."
"524560","529580"," But if you're going to start to deploy money into the market for the new year into Tesla, you might"
"529580","532420"," as well come back down and start at least closing these gaps at a minimum."
"532720","534440"," You want to come back and close these gaps. "
"534940","537160"," People say this all the time, right?"
"537860","541260"," Every gap that gets left behind comes back to revisited."
"542580","550140"," This could be a bullish sign for the market to find a bottom."
"551080","552460"," This isn't guaranteed. "
"552820","559420"," But when you if you fill these gaps down below here, this could actually trigger a some kind of a"
"559420","564080"," bull run in 2023, which is bizarre to say."
"564080","570700"," But if there's any chance of the market coming up in 2023, let's say we find a low in that"
"570700","576060"," January, March, if we can't sell the mark, we can't have our quote unquote bloodletting of the"
"576060","577840"," market in January or March."
"578140","579940"," You might see the market go sideways and up. "
"580560","585540"," And if they close these gaps down below here, this could be a signal to that taking place."
"586560","594260"," This happening and you can see the spine not quite reacting the same same way, or even cues react"
"594260","598820"," the same with Tesla decoupled from the major indexes."
"599760","605920"," So I'd be paying attention to something down here in the next next week or two into the first and"
"605920","610580"," see if we can get Tesla into some kind of a bloodbath, right?"
"613440","616140"," There's not no other explanation that I have for it than that. "
"616800","618020"," Well, there's other explanations."
"618540","622440"," We didn't have a lot of buyers back here, but let's just be conscious of this."
"622600","625140"," If we can get to get it down into the 90s, get that 96. "
"626180","630600"," This is the one that I've been talking to Joe about for a year, I think, maybe longer, maybe a"
"630600","633600"," year and a half now getting down to this 96 level."
"633740","639480"," So if we can get down here to this 96, the 80, I think some bears were saying on Twitter"
"639480","645020"," too, you know, they'll just buy this hand over $50 or $80 or anything down below here, but it could"
"645020","652920"," be some kind of a precursor to a localized bottom coming into the new year."
"653380","658300"," And we know that we've got all those puts, the yearly puts on Tesla expiring in January. "
"659600","667420"," A poster talked about it on either Twitter or here, which was the one mistake that bulls make as"
"667420","668540"," price is no object."
"669240","676340"," When you know that information, I think Spock Emma had said, you know, these yearly puts on Tesla"
"676340","677440"," are all expiring."
"678120","685280"," And we could see like almost like an inverse what happened in January of 2022 where instead of this"
"685280","687600"," violent move down, it's a violent move up, believe it or not. "
"688300","697600"," If we get that violent move up in January on Tesla, price, price getting into January doesn't"
"697600","697920"," matter."
"698480","701620"," Because I guess that's my point is everyone would say, well, if that's going to happen, we should"
"701620","701920"," stabilize."
"702960","708140"," And the reality would be it's either going to be another opportunity to roll into new put positions"
"708140","712180"," or it's going to be an opportunity for all those put positions to roll off. "
"712900","718840"," And, you know, if it's down at 80 bucks, these guys can buy it at 80 while while it's burning,"
"718840","719220"," right?"
"719220","721360"," Or while the last bull is left standing."
"721520","727520"," I think that's what I meant in my, I don't know what that's called, but the picture on my video"
"727520","729820"," this morning is there's not many Tesla bulls left."
"730700","739580"," Not only are there not many Tesla bulls left, but Tesla gang is being gutted right now by Elon"
"739580","740080"," himself. "
"740840","742580"," You can't really deny that."
"743800","747820"," Even myself, some of the things that I've been thinking of is why are we here?"
"747820","749760"," I can't believe that we're here right now."
"750180","755940"," I was thinking this morning, I was like, I was like, even a Ford, Ford CEO wouldn't be talking with"
"755940","761440"," Russians on Twitter, cracking jokes about what they expect in 2023. "
"761980","763660"," It's kind of vile, to be honest with you."
"765660","768240"," I've got no sympathy at all for Russia."
"768720","769080"," I'm sorry. "
"771140","772360"," Here, he'll give you a second here."
"775010","776250"," Let's see who's here this morning."
"776750","777730"," Good morning, Rowan. "
"777830","778150"," How are you?"
"778490","779050"," Merry Christmas."
"779250","779530"," Happy holidays."
"779770","780270"," Happy Hanukkah. "
"780390","780990"," 10 of you out there."
"782850","784490"," TLT pretty much at the buy zone."
"784670","785290"," Just for your first year. "
"785390","786650"," We'll take a look at TLT as well."
"788510","790810"," TLT is coming into, why is that not so?"
"790970","792650"," I get some weird wonkiness going on this morning."
"793130","794010"," Look at that right there. "
"794230","797490"," So it's almost perfect right here, right?"
"799230","804290"," TLT tagged 100.31, and I've got TLT as a buy down here."
"804290","805930"," We'll take a look at why that is too."
"810300","813380"," And what we want to see to reenter TLT. "
"814000","816020"," Now we're going to look on an hourly."
"816360","817160"," We're going to look at TLT."
"817480","819160"," This is my buy zone down here, right?"
"820240","823340"," And we're going to look at TLT in a one hour and a four hour chart. "
"824080","826080"," And we can see that it hasn't turned yet."
"826140","828500"," You can see there's this little bit of bloodletting down here."
"829680","831640"," You're watching that blue line, right?"
"831780","834160"," This is the trend, hourly trend on. "
"836560","839100"," You can see this hourly trend down here, right?"
"839320","842960"," We're still trending down on TLT this morning."
"843840","845520"," You can see when we reverse."
"846420","847760"," You can actually see it right here, right?"
"847900","849800"," Blood bath down, crossover. "
"850380","852180"," And the meat of the trade was right here, right?"
"852780","854500"," Look at that blue line right there."
"855000","860360"," You can see where the meat of the trade came in here, right?"
"860660","861640"," The cross was right here."
"862400","863740"," It's a little bit of a cross right here too. "
"863740","865560"," Some a trade here, a trade here."
"866120","870380"," But we can see above every one, two, and three cells."
"871280","873140"," And they just teed off it, right?"
"873600","874760"," Just teed off it. "
"875400","877020"," So on TLT, what are we looking for?"
"877120","880280"," We're looking for some kind of reversal here, right?"
"880980","885480"," If we don't see a reversal down here, 100 on TLT, we're going to wait, right?"
"885840","887940"," And look for even a lower low."
"888800","892060"," So if this 100, we'll get rid of this this morning."
"893680","899180"," If this 100 does not hold, and even if it does hold, we want to see some constructive this, right?"
"899620","901060"," So let's say you see this come down. "
"901200","906560"," We're going to be watching for TLT to become constructive, break above, and then we'll start"
"906560","909440"," considering a trade in TLT."
"909780","914940"," If you don't break above trend on the one hour, we'll look at the four hour real quick."
"915480","916780"," We're going to continue to watch it. "
"917260","918080"," You can see it here."
"918080","920140"," On the four hour, we haven't broke."
"920340","923640"," We haven't came back into trend either here, right?"
"924040","926520"," So it's just like catching a falling night, right?"
"926620","930720"," When you're selling down like this, right, you want to see it hit, right?"
"931180","932680"," Some accumulation, right?"
"933100","935460"," Break the downtrend, right?"
"935760","943920"," Some accumulation, and then you're going to pick that up when this one hour, a four hour turn comes"
"943920","945180"," back around and starts to turn. "
"945180","947240"," We stay above that one hour chart."
"947500","947860"," Make sense?"
"948500","950340"," I'm not into day trade and TLT."
"950480","951980"," I have no interest in day trading. "
"952500","955680"," It's just like a DIA or the Dow Jones."
"956040","960340"," It's a trade that takes a week, two weeks, a month sometimes."
"961060","962740"," So just we'll keep our eyes on it here. "
"964000","965380"," We're going to keep our eyes on it."
"965520","965900"," Let me see here."
"966820","968800"," So yeah, almost to a pin strike, right?"
"969620","972060"," A hundred bucks, almost to a pin strike. "
"972060","975460"," So what we'll do is we'll snap a line here on TLT."
"975900","979920"," We'll see if we get any kind of constructive moves off TLT."
"980900","987700"," And if we can see some constructiveness, if we can see it begin to break above the hourly trend,"
"988620","988700"," right?"
"989300","990440"," And become constructive. "
"990860","992580"," Watch the hourly trend swing back up."
"993280","995940"," We'll consider our next entry into TLT."
"996220","1000860"," Not quite there yet, but it is getting to that place where you start wanting to keep your eyes on"
"1000860","1001580"," it for sure. "
"1002800","1005320"," Good job, Winky, preventing it."
"1011440","1013180"," 923, a little bit of a buy here."
"1015020","1018180"," Gap is closed, closed this gap before pre-market this morning. "
"1018360","1020620"," We want to see that gap get closed."
"1020960","1021440"," That is bullish."
"1022760","1025220"," And we want to see, as we want to see, hold on a second here. "
"1026780","1028660"," Dang it, dang it, dang it."
"1032540","1036500"," We want to see that same attack that we had on Friday, right?"
"1037040","1038900"," We want to see this attack."
"1039520","1044760"," We want to see a break above, which is right around here. "
"1045540","1046339"," Yup, sorry, hold on here."
"1047580","1052620"," We want to see that attack and boom, which changed the thing here."
"1053200","1054680"," So you can see where to start getting bullish. "
"1055420","1055440"," Okay."
"1057000","1060760"," You want to see this same attack happening above, right?"
"1060880","1063100"," You want to see this same teeing off here."
"1063800","1067920"," And eventually we're going to see a squeeze if we can maintain this, right?"
"1068840","1072720"," And this smash above into new training zone. "
"1074080","1079780"," Expect a low today of 38139 and possibly even testing this low behind."
"1080840","1090820"," At 372.02 and bullish above, you"
"1090820","1091420"," got it already."
"1097060","1099300"," And remember, this is the five minute EMA. "
"1099820","1103040"," If we stay below this, they try to tee off here on the open."
"1103660","1106600"," You don't want to be grabbing calls down here to get teed off on."
"1106680","1109800"," You don't want to see us trade slightly higher and then roll over. "
"1109860","1111060"," You want to see productiveness."
"1111940","1116820"," Or you want to see us get above the 21 EMA and then start heading higher."
"1117720","1119680"," So we'll watch the open and see what happens. "
"1120420","1122440"," And I've got some stuff going on today."
"1123060","1133040"," I've got some construction guys show back up yesterday that wanted to do some work."
"1134480","1136820"," And so my house is covered in dust. "
"1140260","1143560"," I'm a little upset at the moment, but that's okay."
"1143560","1147600"," So I'm going to read through your questions this morning and see what you guys have to say."
"1147680","1148040"," It's 419. "
"1148400","1149780"," We've got four minutes left until the open."
"1152820","1157120"," Hope you guys all had a great, I hope you guys all had a great holiday, by the way."
"1160660","1161200"," Hey, thanks. "
"1161200","1161520"," Thank you."
"1161520","1162300"," Let's appreciate it, man."
"1163520","1163840"," Matthew. "
"1163880","1164220"," Good morning."
"1172460","1173100"," Good morning, Matthew."
"1178400","1182740"," And anyone trying to see why a follow up post almost five hours later. "
"1183020","1184680"," Yeah, you know, I think that like."
"1187040","1188820"," I got some problems with Elon, man."
"1189000","1190940"," It's testing my wherewithal. "
"1191180","1192700"," I still believe in Tesla."
"1193260","1195400"," I have some other concerns with Tesla too."
"1196240","1201420"," I have some concerns with the same using same same same models and car and vehicles. "
"1202840","1204720"," This is really a time when."
"1206340","1210080"," You've got every auto maker out there's going."
"1210080","1211560"," I saw the stuff. "
"1211760","1214360"," I saw the article from Toyota."
"1215040","1217000"," I have no comment on that."
"1217060","1219000"," They dumped all their money into hydrogen fuel cells. "
"1219760","1221980"," I agree with his statement that."
"1223160","1225620"," Most car companies are not on board."
"1225620","1227040"," Evie's behind the scenes. "
"1227940","1232840"," That they're just ready to go back to ice vehicles at the at the drop of a hat."
"1234320","1237220"," I do believe that what that aspect of what he's saying."
"1238340","1244020"," But I don't like the idea of Tesla not being slightly more mainstream. "
"1244420","1246240"," They have to at some point become a Ford."
"1246800","1247700"," There's an argument against that."
"1247820","1249960"," They don't have to become somewhat like a Ford, but they really do. "
"1251460","1254620"," If Tesla is going to take off and kind of be its own thing at some point."
"1255420","1258120"," And then I've got some issues with Elon right now that are just not."
"1258480","1260540"," It reminds me of right now is. "
"1262120","1265420"," You have you have a CEO CEOs of companies."
"1266480","1266960"," Politicians."
"1267280","1270040"," I don't care what what what what political party they're from. "
"1271680","1272640"," CEOs politicians."
"1273380","1275480"," Anyone in power has a limited."
"1276480","1277780"," Amount of capital. "
"1279300","1281700"," In their staying power."
"1284460","1287380"," If you spend too much of it too quickly."
"1289140","1293040"," When that when that when that when that merry go around stops. "
"1293260","1295200"," It's usually the end of their career."
"1296120","1300640"," You'll see CEOs of a lot of major companies won't expend that."
"1301120","1301720"," Capital. "
"1301720","1305540"," All at once like they want to load their gun all at once."
"1305620","1307040"," They'll spread it out over years."
"1307300","1307520"," You'll see. "
"1309380","1311100"," You'll see an apple for it."
"1311120","1311700"," It doesn't matter."
"1312040","1314680"," The CEOs that want to be there for their entire career or. "
"1315620","1318940"," You see in politicians some politicians can have a nice long career."
"1319640","1323600"," We got to be agreed to speak with their politics and some politicians."
"1323680","1325900"," It's it's like a flash in the pan. "
"1326080","1327960"," It's the flash in the pans typically."
"1329280","1331940"," Are kind of in the where where Elon is right now."
"1332320","1334720"," And so it's very very you know you can only. "
"1335240","1336360"," You only have so much."
"1337960","1340560"," People get tired of the flash in the pan."
"1340740","1340840"," Right. "
"1341060","1341640"," I don't think it matters."
"1342220","1342960"," Who they are."
"1343180","1343960"," I think it's becomes. "
"1344420","1345880"," You become tired of it."
"1346180","1349500"," And whether you agree or even even if you agree with the politician."
"1350040","1350700"," Or the CEO. "
"1350980","1351840"," It just becomes tiring."
"1351840","1353100"," You're just like I don't need this anymore."
"1355060","1356300"," Positive or negative too. "
"1356300","1358680"," You'll see that with with companies on the rise."
"1359080","1360880"," You'll see with companies on the way down."
"1361880","1363380"," And in my career. "
"1364980","1366940"," Oftentimes we had to commit and replace."
"1369300","1370360"," People like that."
"1371060","1372240"," They couldn't make the jump. "
"1374660","1376280"," They expended all their capital."
"1377660","1379220"," So I'm concerned right now."
"1379260","1379540"," Be honest. "
"1383700","1385360"," Someone's saying something about TLT."
"1385580","1386440"," I trade TLT."
"1386540","1386900"," We do too. "
"1386900","1388520"," We trade TLT here."
"1389480","1390340"," We have been."
"1392500","1392940"," Yeah. "
"1393280","1393400"," Okay."
"1393520","1395860"," So when he's saying I trade TLT a month is only agreed with that."
"1395960","1396580"," That's some other things. "
"1396740","1397440"," If you're going to trade like."
"1398240","1398680"," DIA."
"1399040","1400560"," If you're going to trade TLT. "
"1401380","1403300"," I will give you a couple warnings."
"1404020","1405720"," It's a it's a trade and hold."
"1407120","1409280"," It's at least a month out if not three. "
"1410400","1415980"," Zeros and fives and wherever the concentration of calls or puts are."
"1416400","1417920"," You need to make sure that you have liquidity."
"1418580","1420060"," Get to make sure that you have time on it. "
"1420220","1423060"," You know, it's also say in the money is always better."
"1423360","1424100"," Always better."
"1424460","1425020"," And those tickers. "
"1428020","1428340"," Yeah."
"1428520","1430180"," Really the Friday show is really good."
"1430340","1431040"," I pulled it down. "
"1431200","1432640"," I was like, there's no way I'm leaving that up."
"1433040","1435060"," I'm not leaving that up for the world to see."
"1435480","1436120"," I'm like, that was it. "
"1436260","1436520"," That was it."
"1436660","1437980"," That was between me and my friends."
"1439500","1440500"," So I pulled it down. "
"1440740","1442060"," You guys let me know if I should put it back up."
"1442060","1442880"," But I don't think that I should."
"1443420","1444540"," That was a hot mess on Friday. "
"1444540","1445460"," It was blast though."
"1446880","1448260"," It was a total blast."
"1448600","1450580"," I had family come over, friends come over. "
"1451380","1452440"," And I'm of course a hot mess."
"1452640","1454560"," I'm trying to drink coffee and water trying to get sober."
"1455120","1457400"," And then I started drinking again with some friends late night. "
"1458020","1458620"," It was horrible."
"1459800","1463200"," And of course I've been sober ever since because I'm like, I can't drink like that."
"1463960","1465520"," So I'm grateful that you all showed up. "
"1465680","1469100"," I'm grateful for the bottle of whiskey or bourbon."
"1474010","1474930"," Yeah, baby."
"1475230","1476330"," Thank you Sunday Never Ends. "
"1478350","1479270"," Good morning, everybody."
"1479450","1479950"," Good morning, Nick."
"1480090","1480570"," Good morning, David. "
"1482390","1486810"," Our data center has been on generator since Wednesday night because AP decided I don't care at all."
"1487270","1487610"," Wow."
"1490270","1494530"," Yeah, I got a, I'm going to probably cut out of here at some point this morning. "
"1497230","1499110"," We could do better on that like button."
"1499270","1499790"," Thank you, Nicholas."
"1500290","1501530"," My actual Christmas was great though. "
"1501910","1506850"," You know, I had some other, you know, I had something that, uh, I had something that I had a"
"1506850","1508010"," really, I had a great Christmas."
"1509290","1510370"," But I had something happen."
"1510610","1514170"," I had, uh, my, I had a belt that I bought. "
"1514370","1516030"," This is, this is so, so weird."
"1517650","1523370"," Uh, I want to say 10 or 12 years ago, I bought a belt and I used it for anything"
"1523370","1524130"," that wasn't."
"1524250","1525210"," This isn't dress up belt. "
"1525350","1527130"," I used it for hike and bike and skiing."
"1528050","1528670"," Used it."
"1529510","1531830"," When I'm first houses, I was renovating. "
"1532050","1533690"," And this was like a buy it for life kind of belt."
"1535330","1540910"," Handmade in the U.S. They so they sewed in a little quarter, right where the, the tongue of the"
"1540910","1541350"," belt was."
"1541890","1542670"," Very simple belt. "
"1543610","1545290"," I destroyed it over the years."
"1545490","1546570"," Like, I mean, destroyed it."
"1547530","1550990"," Rolling around, branding, uh, cattle up in Montana, you name it. "
"1551110","1552530"," Anything you can think of, I wore this belt."
"1553470","1556310"," And it became like, it became that thing you couldn't get rid of, right?"
"1556950","1560470"," Dirty old torn up, well made, buy it for life."
"1562070","1563750"," And it's starting to fall apart. "
"1564650","1568190"," And my oldest daughter had the fourth thought."
"1568890","1570510"," I knew how much I love this belt."
"1571410","1572530"," That she got me a new one. "
"1573570","1576450"," And it made me hurt like I was crying and stuff as all."
"1576990","1580110"," Cause I couldn't believe that she actually thought of something that I really care about."
"1580450","1586270"," And I don't have a lot of stuff that I care enough about for quality, from a quality perspective,"
"1587510","1589690"," like I'll destroy Milwaukee tools. "
"1590290","1591430"," I'll destroy all kinds of stuff."
"1592110","1596090"," Apple iPhones have driven over Apple iPhones in other boxes."
"1596770","1598070"," All kinds of craziness. "
"1598550","1603890"," So like if something has survived all these years, I have, it's, I hold it up in an altar."
"1604090","1607790"," I'm like, this thing right here is one of the best things I've ever owned."
"1608030","1614650"," And she knew that and got me this belt and this belt, they must have moved manufacturing overseas"
"1614650","1615230"," or something. "
"1616130","1623470"," I'm so devastated that this belt is not built like the old belt."
"1624410","1626210"," So it's like this weird thing."
"1626350","1633170"," I'm so like, I can't believe how happy I am that my daughter thought of me and sought that buy"
"1633170","1634090"," it for life belt out. "
"1634570","1636170"," It's not a common belt."
"1636810","1638230"," It used to be a handmade belt."
"1639470","1645710"," And then I was so incredulous and destroyed when I picked it up and said, what did they do to"
"1645710","1646090"," my belt?"
"1646410","1648510"," Like this company was so amazing. "
"1649610","1650870"," I don't know why the belt."
"1651590","1653010"," That got me this Christmas."
"1655990","1657930"," Other EVs on what charging. "
"1658210","1660210"," Yeah, you know, that's not a good enough answer anymore."
"1661090","1664690"," You know, it's the only thing that Tesla has right now is the charging network."
"1665170","1666270"," And it's not good enough. "
"1666850","1669390"," You can't just say charging."
"1669650","1671950"," Matter of fact, the EU is going to put an end to that."
"1672750","1674970"," But the charging network is not enough. "
"1675570","1676370"," It was enough."
"1676610","1677530"," It's not enough anymore."
"1677690","1678050"," You can't. "
"1678270","1680330"," We're not going to sit here and do charging network."
"1681650","1684730"," And two or two or three years or five years from now."
"1685490","1687530"," We don't have the charging network anymore, right?"
"1687690","1688290"," That's not good enough. "
"1688490","1688970"," It doesn't work."
"1690570","1692090"," You always have to be."
"1692690","1700770"," Matter of fact, even as it to that point, you're not going to see Tesla and growth base until until"
"1700770","1702170"," you have something new. "
"1703070","1704230"," We know this about Apple."
"1704910","1706370"," We know it's for every company out there."
"1706450","1707490"," You have to be in growth. "
"1708130","1709490"," It has to be new."
"1709770","1710830"," It has to be new."
"1711330","1713210"," It has to be something big. "
"1714410","1715750"," You just have to be there."
"1715830","1718290"," If you're not in that part of the cycle, that this is what happens."
"1718910","1719630"," The price goes down. "
"1719830","1721110"," You have to look at Tesla objectively."
"1721790","1726570"," And to say you've got the charging networks, it's not good enough."
"1727090","1728850"," That's priced in is what they say, right?"
"1729130","1730370"," We've repriced that in already. "
"1733040","1733440"," Yeah."
"1733660","1737020"," I'm not a fan of hydrogen at all in any way, shape or form."
"1738160","1738880"," They dumped too much. "
"1739140","1740660"," Two to dump too much money to that shit."
"1741120","1742660"," So they can kiss off with that."
"1747120","1747720"," We're in Montana. "
"1748240","1750460"," My family has a ranch in."
"1752340","1753100"," He could lack."
"1753340","1754320"," He could lack in Montana. "
"1758210","1761770"," You'd like to review it for the James and I'm only in my discussion."
"1761970","1762070"," Yeah."
"1762190","1762830"," Well, do is. "
"1765050","1766830"," I contacted James this morning."
"1766830","1773190"," I'm going to try to get him to do a actual recorded video so that you guys can review all"
"1773190","1774010"," that information."
"1780120","1782520"," You can take the same pair of ribbons 10 years ago than today. "
"1782640","1783900"," It's not even the same product anymore."
"1784060","1784560"," I agreed."
"1784900","1785900"," I was devastated. "
"1786540","1787640"," I was absolutely devastated."
"1788580","1792980"," It's hard to find something that, you know, just lasts the test."
"1793240","1794080"," It has a test of time. "
"1796280","1797920"," The situation in the stock market."
"1798100","1799180"," You'll go over that at some point."
"1804010","1804930"," I was crushed. "
"1805210","1805490"," Yeah, restaurants."
"1805970","1807390"," We don't we go out rare now."
"1808230","1811690"," Go go out to restaurants and not the same. "
"1812790","1813490"," Craft the board."
"1817500","1817980"," Yeah."
"1820640","1823300"," Yeah, I have a I have high expectations of Tesla. "
"1823880","1827960"," I am an old school Tesla bowl and it's not good enough anymore."
"1828060","1828740"," It's not good enough."
"1830780","1831620"," It's not it's. "
"1833280","1837060"," The quality and craftsmanship has to be there at this point with that."
"1837060","1843100"," With a model that they've had for so many years, there has to be more than just the charging"
"1843100","1843440"," network."
"1844860","1846220"," There has to be more done. "
"1846380","1852780"," It has to be work that work at this point should have been done on making self driving."
"1854700","1859020"," A topic of conversation, at least with the bureaucracy in the United States."
"1860580","1864560"," And instead, it's become a flashpoint and like a fight. "
"1864560","1873300"," He could have people on the ground talking to counties, state, county officials rolling out some"
"1873300","1875620"," kind of a program that none of that's going on."
"1876100","1877180"," I've got some real issues."
"1877360","1878560"," I got I got some issues, man. "
"1879160","1882200"," I don't want to see a Ford electric truck coming out."
"1884160","1888300"," That's that it really is in direct competition to Tesla."
"1888300","1889000"," I don't want to see. "
"1889100","1890880"," I'm seeing these scene cars come up."
"1891000","1894340"," They're twenty twenty twenty five thousand thirty thousand dollars."
"1894840","1896020"," There are some real. "
"1897160","1898780"," There are some real threats to."
"1900100","1902080"," I don't think the test has become Ford."
"1902280","1907480"," I mean, I'm saying Ford that they don't have to come forward, but you can't have BMW coming out"
"1907480","1908420"," with what they're coming out with. "
"1908440","1910720"," You can't have all these other car companies."
"1912160","1913360"," They're going to squeeze Tesla."
"1913720","1915240"," It reminds me of Studebaker to an extent. "
"1916000","1918940"," And then it then you've got the whole entire."
"1920720","1927000"," Elon thing, which is an issue to some extent, I'm almost at a point of maybe Elon shouldn't be CEO"
"1927000","1927940"," anymore of Tesla."
"1929140","1931660"," Tesla needs some new some new blood or new direction. "
"1940970","1947690"," Yeah, no, I don't disagree with that the I don't disagree for any moment that Tesla doesn't control"
"1947690","1949470"," the charging the charging network."
"1950470","1951590"," It's it's not good enough."
"1951590","1952430"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1952430","1952950"," It's just not."
"1954090","1962970"," We actually saw something really cool was Apple when they Apple had stopped launching new new"
"1962970","1963370"," products."
"1964450","1966450"," And they got hit hard from it. "
"1967190","1970430"," And I remember sitting in on one of their earnings earnings."
"1973510","1976490"," Earnings calls and they were trying to explain to."
"1977690","1981310"," Reporters and investors that they had switched to. "
"1982810","1984690"," Earning money from a subscription model."
"1985370","1987250"," And no one understood what that meant."
"1988550","1990210"," And so Apple got hit. "
"1991090","1993750"," With for that to their next quarter."
"1994530","1999850"," And of course they've banged out a bunch of money from focusing on the subscription models."
"2000390","2001710"," And Apple came back. "
"2001710","2006770"," But then once that was once that was priced in Apple stock went down again."
"2007310","2012450"," And so you always have to be in the in the in the process of launching new products."
"2012830","2014670"," It's required for a company. "
"2015710","2016950"," Expanding your market share."
"2018750","2020450"," There's nothing nothing but that."
"2021670","2024170"," Especially when it comes to a publicly traded company. "
"2033820","2035380"," I agree with all of this."
"2035520","2037500"," I know they've got tech that needs to release those chips."
"2037820","2038780"," I realize this. "
"2039240","2042360"," They've got a truck that they got a truck that I put a deposit on."
"2043100","2045860"," When was that 2017 I think."
"2046160","2047719"," A deposit on a truck. "
"2048239","2048960"," Not here."
"2049840","2051179"," No one cares about excuses."
"2051920","2052440"," Nobody cares. "
"2058179","2058620"," Yeah."
"2058760","2059580"," My wife has a model X."
"2061360","2061800"," My wife has a model X."
"2061800","2061960"," My wife."
"2062040","2062739"," It's not good enough. "
"2063080","2064280"," You have to do it."
"2064340","2065460"," We're looking at this."
"2065719","2068020"," You know we're looking at Tesla like two different places. "
"2068860","2070960"," We're looking at it from a main street perspective."
"2071760","2074400"," And we're looking at it from a Wall Street perspective."
"2074580","2076420"," And those are two different perspectives. "
"2077400","2080580"," You and I can discuss how awesome Tesla is."
"2080659","2081460"," I love Tesla."
"2083040","2087920"," But the Wall Street perspective is a lot different than my experience and your experience. "
"2087920","2095040"," My wife's experience is absolutely different than what Wall Street wants to see."
"2101990","2103570"," Morning Merry Christmas."
"2103770","2104270"," Oh, how are you?"
"2111990","2114330"," Oh, yeah, I saw the production was cut. "
"2114470","2115470"," I saw that article this morning."
"2115990","2117110"," The Winkies posting here."
"2123020","2125800"," Yeah, there's that's why and that's a key point. "
"2126560","2128580"," Legal honesty is making a key point here."
"2128660","2129100"," You can't."
"2129620","2132660"," You can't say we're launching a truck and then not launch a truck. "
"2134060","2136140"," If you work in a corporation, right?"
"2136840","2138840"," I'm telling you, if you work in a corporation, it's results."
"2139900","2141100"," No one fucking cares."
"2141320","2143080"," I don't want to swear, but no one fucking cares. "
"2144340","2150060"," That you have a chip shortage or your research wasn't done or your development wasn't wasn't wasn't"
"2150060","2151080"," to spec."
"2151300","2151780"," It doesn't matter."
"2153000","2156120"," You have to meet these goals. "
"2156740","2160620"," You do when you don't, especially when they've become priced in."
"2162180","2162920"," It's interesting."
"2163320","2171040"," If there's a rumor that let's say the war with a current Ukraine ends, the stock market will pump"
"2171040","2171460"," on that. "
"2172620","2177980"," If the war doesn't end from their perspective, well, we front we front ran it, right?"
"2177980","2181540"," So now they'll dump it until the war is actually going to end."
"2181960","2184900"," It's a horrible example, but it's the same example."
"2185080","2188180"," It works all the time in the stock market. "
"2189280","2192240"," And so I think that's where we are with Tesla to some extent."
"2192520","2196080"," And then we've got good old-fashioned profit-taking for the next run for Tesla."
"2196360","2201020"," So it's not like I don't think Tesla's ever coming back or doesn't have a future. "
"2201420","2204020"," There is some risk to bankruptcy for Tesla."
"2204020","2210580"," High risk of bankruptcy for Tesla in the next couple of years, but it's to be expected."
"2211120","2216900"," When you're at the end of a short-term debt cycle, this is what we see in high-flying companies"
"2216900","2217420"," like Tesla. "
"2218560","2224480"," It's normal to see this, but at the same time there's risk and you need to see Tesla start to"
"2224480","2224780"," produce."
"2233480","2238560"," Yeah, you can make those agreements all day long."
"2239660","2240220"," It's irrelevant. "
"2240820","2242340"," It has nothing to do with the price of Tesla."
"2243700","2245340"," It has zero to do with the price of Tesla."
"2256440","2261260"," Yeah, I think the put opportunity is on this big blue line right here, right?"
"2262040","2267980"," You've got this big blue line there, teeing off it, your first place you're looking for. "
"2268500","2270760"," So I wasn't paying attention to the market at that moment."
"2270880","2271580"," I was trying to read your comments."
"2274060","2276540"," So this is your credit point right here, right?"
"2277000","2283420"," As I told you earlier, you don't want to take a bullish position unless you see us trade above that"
"2283420","2284420"," blue line right there. "
"2284580","2286820"," So I'm going to show you guys right now."
"2286920","2287820"," I'll make this a blue line."
"2289160","2290400"," See this blue line right here?"
"2291640","2292820"," Hold on a minute here. "
"2292920","2294080"," Maybe you can't see that blue line."
"2294760","2295760"," Close that for you."
"2298860","2308790"," So you're not going to take a call position unless you get above this blue line right"
"2308790","2309030"," here. "
"2309330","2309770"," Make sense?"
"2310470","2313330"," You'll actually see that blue line turn back around and start heading higher."
"2314250","2319510"," Until then, you're going to expect us to tee off this blue line until we find support, right?"
"2320190","2324190"," So you're going to be looking for this blue line to continue to head lower."
"2324890","2327870"," You're going to continue to see us trade down until we find support. "
"2328410","2336030"," We know that 378.02. We know we've got the pivot and 370.02 as the two places that we're"
"2336030","2337750"," looking for to see if we found support."
"2338470","2340270"," If we don't, we'll continue to head lower there."
"2345380","2350900"," So S1 is at 379.64, although I'd really like to see us retest this low back here. "
"2350900","2352620"," Let's see if you guys can see it."
"2356140","2357220"," Right back here."
"2358580","2362940"," This is the previous low and the next previous low down below over here. "
"2369560","2370720"," Leave that so you can see it."
"2375350","2381830"," You should get from me every morning I post these numbers to you so you can snap these on your"
"2381830","2384090"," own chart at home."
"2400180","2406540"," Coming into, yeah, that's kind of light support there and book map. "
"2407140","2408680"," Not quite big support."
"2424780","2428960"," We can look at the bottom of book map and you'll see 3775."
"2432670","2433890"," That's right down in here. "
"2434050","2436330"," This previous, previous low down here, right?"
"2437690","2438690"," Hold on a second here."
"2439030","2441550"," Get some weird air things going on too."
"2446370","2447970"," See my cursor right in here. "
"2449630","2454270"," So that's 3775."
"2455230","2457810"," But I think that's actually down here."
"2459130","2459690"," 846. "
"2460610","2460830"," Yeah."
"2461570","2465390"," So that's roughly right in here at S3 is where real support is today."
"2468670","2472670"," And the next, this stop right here has got decent support, not great support. "
"2473630","2474910"," I'll show it to you again on book map."
"2489760","2490440"," Hold on air."
"2491080","2492120"," Some weirdness going on. "
"2504040","2504980"," Grubster, have a great morning."
"2505360","2506320"," Yeah, I have to cut out too."
"2506460","2508560"," I've got some construction guys showing up in a little bit. "
"2509420","2510140"," So I'm going to have it."
"2510180","2511780"," It'll be really fucking noisy air."
"2520060","2523240"," Short should cover before January 2nd PD numbers. "
"2523560","2525820"," Yeah, I'm not really concerned about PD numbers."
"2526860","2529940"," It has more to do with yearly puts on Tesla."
"2531220","2532700"," That expire in January. "
"2534280","2536600"," I care less about Tesla news events."
"2557880","2560960"," What happens on maintenance for all those Teslas that they get bought out?"
"2561700","2562560"," I don't think."
"2563300","2569810"," I have other auto manufacturing. "
"2570250","2571170"," No one else is using it."
"2571210","2574390"," You can press this point much more efficient than old screw and weld process."
"2574910","2578030"," Yeah, I'm not I'm not anti all this stuff with Tesla. "
"2578490","2579750"," I have no like."
"2582750","2585290"," I'm impressed by Tesla up and down."
"2590630","2592890"," So since it's first refresh by now. "
"2592890","2593970"," Yeah, exactly."
"2594210","2594650"," Exactly."
"2594970","2599310"," At this point, I would have liked to have seen. "
"2600370","2601950"," At this point, I would have liked to have seen."
"2602630","2604410"," Cyber truck already be out."
"2605150","2606550"," I would have liked to have seen. "
"2607910","2613550"," The Ford electric truck come out and have a version, at least a version of the cyber truck to"
"2613550","2613870"," compete."
"2616410","2618690"," With with the Ford electric truck."
"2619210","2620250"," Not having that. "
"2620850","2625970"," I know some big bulls disagree with that concept of you're not trying to compete with Ford."
"2626430","2627970"," You're not trying to compete with BMW."
"2628830","2630550"," And it's like, well, who are you competing with?"
"2631910","2634610"," Because your competitors are coming after you right now. "
"2637010","2638710"," There's there's only so much market share."
"2648400","2648880"," Yeah."
"2648880","2655040"," Yeah, no, it's it's it's a it's a it's a huge part of the market, right?"
"2655300","2657160"," And electric I want an electric truck bad. "
"2657960","2659200"," I want one bad."
"2659440","2665920"," I would take one in a heartbeat and I'm not going to sit there waiting for the cyber truck."
"2674260","2675680"," Let me say I'm going to take a look at some stuff. "
"2699090","2701530"," Yeah, there's there's there's no trigger right now."
"2711930","2712730"," This later."
"2714710","2716590"," We've got some news headlines for you this morning. "
"2730350","2732650"," Yeah, no news from the news squacks."

"2766910","2768970"," I already know about that stuff."

"2894730","2897570"," Still more sellers in the market right now."
"2898870","2901610"," Could see relief bounce here, but it doesn't look like real bottom."
"2908630","2910870"," See if I can look at Tesla real quick. "
"2917850","2925690"," New lows right 114 75 down 6% on the day down $7.40 brutal."

"3073790","3075670"," Kind of cheap."
"3075670","3077350"," I'm going to keep my eye on those. "
"3080460","3090130"," If you have access, if your brokerage has the full options complex"
"3090130","3095370"," on it, keep your eye on 390 C for the 30th."
"3097750","3099310"," If you see it at any point."
"3102410","3105110"," If you see any point that's come down here let's say. "
"3106590","3109870"," And you stop seeing them lose value."
"3111330","3114630"," Hold value maybe and if we go down some more."
"3115690","3118710"," If you see us come down here and you stop you stop seeing them lose value. "
"3118990","3122370"," Maybe start to gain some value as we make it if we make a turn down here."
"3123170","3125170"," Just keep your eyes on them for the 30th."

"3153410","3156310"," I'm interested in watching some premium get built into them."
"3156610","3159010"," If the market makers think we're actually going there. "
"3175150","3176930"," Yeah, I don't think I disagree with you."
"3176970","3177670"," You've got this at all."
"3178130","3180090"," I don't think that I disagree with anything that you're saying. "
"3182910","3186110"," But I think it's I think what you're saying is completely different than."

"3947220","3949160"," out their garbage because they know it's going down."
"3949960","3953240"," Oh, he said investors that says right on. "
"3953360","3954300"," Yeah, it's a part of it."
"3954360","3955460"," It's a normal part of a debt cycle."
"3955520","3955880"," There. "
"3956040","3962720"," This is nothing abnormal about knowing your stock prices going down and using it to air out dirty"

"3967100","3968360"," as far as I came with my antics."

"3974840","3975360"," You'll you. "
"3975560","3976420"," This is not uncommon."
"3976640","3977440"," You're not going to see."
"3977780","3979300"," You didn't see Elon do this stuff. "
"3979440","3980960"," We're cranking at all time highs, right?"
"3981180","3981680"," Of course not."
"3982340","3983860"," This is a prime time to do it."
"3983900","3988720"," It wouldn't shock me if Elon or any some of his friends were short short Tesla stock right now. "
"3988740","3993440"," None of that would phase me in the least in the least."
"3994480","3996220"," They can't say, Hey, James, good morning."

"4035020","4036160"," No, my numbers are the same."
"4036980","4038540"," They're the same that's posted right now."
"4046600","4047920"," My Oh, they're different. "
"4048100","4049660"," Why are they different every day is what you're asking?"
"4050380","4053640"," It's because they're calculated based upon previous pivot points."
"4054100","4055520"," And so every day they change."
"4056500","4057820"," They change every single day. "
"4058060","4064260"," Matter of fact, you'll when you hear people talk about range expansion or range compression, that's"
"4064260","4068480"," where you see it is inside of the inside of the pivot points, right?"
"4068640","4071080"," The R1s, R2s, R3s, S1, S2, S3."
"4075640","4078240"," Yeah, I don't think don't think that I don't love Tesla."
"4078940","4083500"," You have to understand I'm holding Tesla to a higher standard of expectation. "
"4083920","4091580"," I'm holding them to two or also to what Walmart or what Walmart what Wall Street's expectations"
"4091580","4092140"," are."
"4092940","4094220"," And that's a fact."
"4094840","4096020"," You can't get away from that. "
"4103500","4108319"," Henry Ubuntu's asking, Cap, is there a service that Wall Street subscribes to that consolidates the"
"4108319","4110700"," margin call exposure on a stock?"
"4111240","4112520"," If so, how do we get that info?"
"4113100","4116859"," You know who I think had that at one time was."
"4118520","4120160"," I don't know if I should say who it was."
"4120700","4123840"," You know, Walter Bloomberg's got a discord. "
"4124700","4129620"," I think he used to release some of that data from Bloomberg on his discord."

"4144720","4145580"," What do you got there?"
"4145880","4147620"," 393 January 2023. "
"4149020","4150220"," Yeah, I see that too."
"4151020","4151620"," I didn't sit."
"4151740","4153000"," No, I'm looking at 390 C."
"4153439","4155120"," What what's what expiry in January?"
"4157479","4160660"," What's the date on January Winkie vase?"
"4162380","4163460"," Always blame the interns. "
"4164140","4164960"," I still like that comment."
"4164960","4166500"," To me, your family capital."
"4166680","4168040"," I hope you'll have had a great business. "
"4168160","4169680"," Hey, yeah, God throws a great Christmas."
"4171140","4172240"," You got stuck in Dallas."
"4172640","4175880"," Oh, oh, oh, no. "
"4178560","4179520"," I can't do it."
"4179620","4183920"," You're the worst part about losing your bags is you never get them back until you're done with your"
"4183920","4184180"," trip."
"4188399","4189740"," I answered the DM. "
"4189920","4190420"," Oh, you did James."
"4190840","4195580"," I'll give you give me a call man on my phone or send me your phone number so I can"
"4195580","4195980"," give you a shout."

"4202400","4203120"," Oh, hold on."
"4203180","4204260"," I'm trying to catch up with you guys are saying."
"4204980","4205780"," Let's go under the moment. "
"4206060","4207480"," Test under 100 is the deal of a decade."
"4209360","4211060"," I agree with that."
"4211180","4211840"," Well, I don't know. "
"4212000","4212540"," That's a two sided."
"4212920","4213780"," Give me one second here."
"4220560","4222800"," So that's a two sided coin there. "
"4224040","4225160"," I agree."
"4226140","4228720"," Tesla under 100 is the deal of a decade."
"4230520","4235100"," If there's a market repricing event in 2023 lower. "
"4236760","4238620"," It could go much lower."
"4238980","4240980"," I want to warn you that Tesla can go."
"4241980","4242720"," Much lower. "
"4243080","4244700"," All stocks can go much lower."
"4244920","4245580"," Be aware of that."
"4245640","4245900"," Okay. "
"4246520","4248660"," So that doesn't mean you don't buy Tesla under 100."
"4248700","4251480"," It means I think I've said this before, right?"
"4252320","4259120"," I was talking to Joe last week and I was like, I'm like 96 was the low target."
"4259540","4262540"," But now I'm looking at 60 and now I'm looking at 40 something. "
"4263460","4270220"," I'm like, so if I can get it at if I can deploy some cash at 96 or 115."
"4271220","4276480"," 136 and then I deploy some cash at 60 and 40 and still have some leftover."
"4276840","4280780"," I can come out regardless of when we make the turn and be in that. "
"4280780","4283220"," This is the last part is you have to be happy with where you bought Tesla."
"4284360","4289440"," So if you're buying Tesla, if you're a Tesla bull, you can see the fair ingredient index 38 out of"
"4289440","4290860"," 100, which indicates fair."
"4292200","4295280"," Nice little push on on spy right now. "
"4295640","4298760"," Breaking above the one minute on the big blue line."
"4301000","4301960"," Pushing higher now."
"4302640","4303780"," I wasn't I wasn't paying attention. "
"4303880","4304660"," I was reading your comments."
"4305220","4306880"," I would have taken that trade right there."
"4306880","4308000"," That's a good trade right there. "
"4309100","4309960"," A little bit of a gap."
"4310060","4312560"," Fair and great index 27 out of 100."
"4312840","4314640"," I need to pay the fair as well right now. "
"4317280","4324460"," 390 C's trading 56 cents 60 cents right now on December 30th."
"4333720","4335720"," I'll take a look at it."
"4336900","4338100"," Thank you. "
"4343000","4345100"," Yeah, losing back ski trips are nightmare."
"4347240","4349000"," Somehow I got them back from the end of my trip."
"4349260","4349960"," Yeah, that's wild. "
"4352600","4354640"," Sorry has a higher P ratio to Tesla."
"4361560","4363460"," So Tesla should really make roadsters."
"4375880","4377180"," Yeah, we can take a look at the volume. "
"4383580","4384600"," It's decent volume."
"4384600","4385800"," It's a low volume market."
"4386080","4388080"," It's not bad volume. "
"4393200","4394040"," Million though."
"4394440","4395420"," We want to see more than others."
"4395740","4396580"," 3 million right there. "
"4397100","4398960"," That's pretty good on a low volume day."
"4399280","4399620"," Pretty good bounce."
"4400580","4410420"," You want to look for some targets you want to see this"
"4410420","4411660"," hold in the five minute here. "
"4418840","4421160"," In 10 minutes time now at the bottom of the hour."
"4421460","4427560"," Do you get the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index forecast minus 15 on the prior minus 14 spot"
"4427560","4428700"," for 20 is somewhere in here."
"4429400","4432460"," 3 to 3 20 on the 15 minute the one minute showing it. "
"4436700","4446240"," And this we're going to become bullish here if we can maintain above this blue line right here."
"4455340","4457740"," Check out the book map trying to ladder it up and spy it."
"4457780","4458680"," It's hourly trigger again. "
"4461460","4463120"," Yeah, it's right here, James."
"4463920","4464660"," It's right here brother."
"4470340","4472780"," It's 390 C's on December 30th. "
"4472840","4473500"," They're pumping now."
"4473500","4474820"," They're like 41 cents."
"4475040","4476200"," Now they're at 70 cents. "
"4478120","4480020"," They're cranking right now."
"4488260","4490360"," I wish I had bought those."
"4495620","4497260"," I would have liked to have own those. "
"4501500","4502180"," Yeah, winky."
"4510000","4511980"," Yeah, I'm looking for just a thing."
"4512160","4513820"," It pulls back hopefully for just a second. "
"4513980","4514940"," I'll jump on board with you guys."
"4515840","4522080"," I'm looking for I wanted to buy the 390 C's for the 30th of December."

"4530120","4534180"," If I'm grabbing them like right here, I end up getting upside down and it's nonsense."
"4543580","4544720"," You look at it."

"6211890","6220510"," He basically fucked every single person that, uh, I don't know."
"6220710","6221710"," I don't know if that's all of that."
"6221850","6223710"," I'm assuming that he's making the money in real estate. "
"6223910","6224730"," I don't know the whole story."
"6225530","6228770"," And my assumption is I remember he pulled out everything out of the market."
"6229170","6229930"," A couple times. "
"6230130","6231190"," I think I remember when he'd done that."
"6231350","6232290"," So he did good on that."
"6233410","6235470"," So I can't, I can't fault him in those things. "
"6236350","6239450"," But the real scummy fucking thing is that FTX bullshit."
"6239850","6242730"," I told you guys to me, you guys have been following me for a long time."
"6243770","6247510"," Uh, know that I used to not even have a ton of followers. "
"6248190","6252310"," I don't have a ton of followers, but you guys know that I've told you in the past they get"
"6252310","6256270"," emails from the gambling sites and from the FTX type sites."
"6256530","6260910"," They're like, they want to pay me like a thousand bucks just to post that shit, which is nothing."
"6261390","6264950"," Only a thousand dollars, but it's a lot of money to me, right?"
"6265230","6272450"," If I post an ad or a link to the gambling sites or a link to FTX, they were reaching"
"6272450","6273850"," out to everybody that was on YouTube. "
"6274830","6280990"," So if they're willing to pay me a thousand bucks a week, just imagine what they were paying him."
"6283010","6286130"," And I've told you guys at the past, I get these emails from those companies."
"6286790","6290710"," I don't get them right now, but I was getting them when he was running all those ads. "
"6291070","6293230"," They pretty much reached out to anyone that was on YouTube."
"6294470","6298910"," And so you can just imagine what they were paying him for that stuff."
"6299890","6301770"," And dude, like there's people out there. "
"6303430","6309630"," Just people out there that are like, like there's suckers out there."
"6309950","6311610"," And I don't know."
"6311870","6313210"," I have a real problem with that. "
"6315030","6320210"," I have a real problem with the, with the just, I'm like, did that pay for the jet?"
"6320450","6326730"," Was it, was it all that like FTX money and all the, like all the advertisement money or like when"
"6326730","6332110"," you plug people, like the fact like James and I have plugged James on Friday, right?"
"6332670","6333870"," There was no backdoor deal."
"6334170","6337610"," There was no like, Hey, James, we're going to make a deal where, I don't know."
"6337750","6338570"," I don't know. "
"6338890","6341850"," I fucking rub your feet and you rub my feet or anything like that."
"6342430","6343810"," But that shit goes on all the time."
"6346030","6347430"," It goes on all the time. "
"6347910","6351110"," I get emails constantly about that stuff."
"6351310","6354810"," And I haven't said yes to it once, not one time."
"6357790","6359850"," But I can, I can understand the allure of it. "
"6360970","6363490"," But then meanwhile, you're the one that's getting fucked here."
"6364230","6364450"," One second."
"6366470","6369190"," I'm going to go back to the, I'm going to go back and look at the 30th. "
"6372510","6375550"," Is it too much to ask for your stream to just get paid for?"
"6379410","6381410"," It shouldn't, it shouldn't be like this."
"6385030","6386550"," Damn, they're still holding value."
"6387950","6390610"," The 390 C's and the 30th, they're still holding value. "
"6393050","6396170"," I think it's like this weird like, I don't know."
"6396310","6402790"," I don't know if they just suck a trade in or if they tie a trade in or I don't"
"6402790","6404710"," know exactly what it all is here."
"6416710","6419670"," I'm trying to fucking place trades won't fucking talk to you guys. "
"6433210","6434310"," Like maybe it's the greed."
"6434790","6435530"," I don't know you."
"6437170","6441630"," I know you have to do like, if you want to have like a Brazilian followers, you have to like"
"6441630","6443630"," be a certain way act a certain way. "
"6445290","6451730"," It's constantly like, you're constantly making videos and posting videos that are attention"
"6451730","6452690"," grabbers, right?"
"6453230","6455390"," It's all about like churn and it's all about."
"6457690","6460250"," I was like, oh, if this thing just pays for itself, I'd be happy."
"6461290","6464890"," That's how much I'm like, I don't really care what. "
"6465550","6467390"," I don't really care what this turns into."
"6476910","6480650"," I'm just saying, I'm trying to watch, trying to see if I should, I can't tell if we're going to"
"6480650","6481630"," get a roll here or not."
"6483130","6486730"," I'm trying to use the five minute. "
"6486830","6487830"," We're kind of just sitting here."
"6491070","6492370"," That's a risky fucking trade."
"6498530","6499430"," I'm just gonna be patient. "
"6499510","6500630"," I'm sitting in my hands here for a minute."
"6502470","6503410"," This looks like a roll."
"6516150","6517890"," We're still going up though too, right?"
"6518130","6519710"," See, we're still following that trend line up. "
"6523470","6526610"," We're still, we're still, we're still, we're still, we're still, we're still, like trend hasn't"
"6526610","6527250"," been broken yet."
"6532830","6535070"," Believe it or not, which is crazier, right?"
"6535430","6536710"," The trend has not been broken."
"6540770","6545690"," We just keep going up here and then you can see it on a five, on a five, on a"
"6545690","6546470"," five minute, I think. "
"6546470","6549810"," And no trend has been broken here, right?"
"6550090","6551330"," None of this has been broken."
"6552430","6553650"," All dips have been bought."
"6554170","6555970"," All dips have been supportive in nature. "
"6557410","6560990"," But again, the sellers don't want, you know, the sellers don't want us."
"6561070","6568130"," The sellers don't want, you know, the conclusion of this, right?"
"6568290","6569230"," They don't want to see that squeeze."
"6570270","6573450"," They want you to, they want to tell you this is a bear flag is what they want to tell"
"6573450","6573650"," you. "
"6573890","6577210"," Now, if that's a bear flag, that wouldn't have been bought, right?"
"6577210","6578070"," It would have been a bloodbath."
"6578910","6580870"," I'm assuming people on Twitter said that."
"6581530","6584850"," I'm going to bet that people on Twitter this morning was like, we're going to get a bloodbath and"
"6584850","6586230"," it's going to be terrible to me a monster. "
"6587090","6590290"," It's going to be like doom and gloom into the 30th, but that hasn't happened."
"6590510","6594530"," So this looks more constructive than just so far."
"6594690","6596010"," Looks more constructive than a bear flag. "
"6602150","6602830"," Excuse me here."
"6609370","6615030"," These bears are like doom."
"6616850","6617990"," That's what bears want. "
"6618490","6618790"," Blood red."
"6620190","6621090"," What does the fail?"
"6627470","6629050"," So far, it's not failing, right?"
"6629330","6632630"," So far, the trend is up still."
"6632630","6634670"," So even right now, at this moment, trend is still up. "
"6634910","6639050"," So you want to see this break here."
"6639210","6644230"," If you are bearish right now, you want to see a break of this blue line right here."
"6644490","6645430"," You're getting bearish right now. "
"6649410","6651690"," You want to get underneath this, right?"
"6651930","6652710"," Start looking lower."
"6655230","6659930"," First price target with 370.06. Then, of course, down here."
"6662630","6664430"," You need to get underneath this five minute, though. "
"6665190","6666510"," You got some more work to do."
"6669930","6671810"," And you're getting it right now."
"6671930","6673850"," You're getting some productivity here. "
"6674810","6676670"," We're going to have some weakness in the market."
"6679270","6689110"," We'll get some price target below is 370.06. Start a break below on the"
"6689110","6689710"," five minute here."
"6706770","6707910"," You want that blood red?"
"6709870","6711870"," I'm going to draw the blood red for you. "
"6712790","6714690"," All your bears are going to frisky out there, your pain."
"6718750","6720150"," This is not the one that you want to see."
"6726430","6728350"," Is that the puddle down here?"
"6729330","6732250"," The one that you're talking about?"
"6735670","6736970"," The old push. "
"6737870","6740630"," Trapped them bulls in right here thinking that they're going up."
"6745070","6745890"," So you want."
"6747190","6749530"," So the bears want that right there. "
"6751590","6760730"," Just send it to the depths of hell."
"6761050","6761610"," It"
"6763310","6773790"," just"
"6775160","6776520"," pulls the blood down here."
"6782880","6783720"," So nasty. "
"6783960","6784360"," Look at that."
"6787440","6788320"," I'm not in anything."
"6788760","6789340"," I don't think so. "
"6789480","6789720"," Let me check."
"6793680","6795660"," I say I'm not in anything right now."
"6795760","6797060"," I can be getting wrecked right now. "
"6799220","6800560"," I'm flat right now."
"6800620","6800780"," I'm good."
"6801060","6801260"," I'm good. "
"6809420","6810300"," Blood red."
"6811680","6812200"," We're bleeding."
"6813040","6814980"," We're bleeding right now, boys and girls. "
"6815580","6816160"," We're underneath."
"6818240","6823620"," We're bleeding the US to sell $45 billion in four week bills on December 29th, settling on January"
"6823620","6824060"," 3rd."
"6838910","6840210"," Talked to me, Captain. "
"6848550","6850250"," What's your pattern of those blood drops?"
"6854810","6856550"," It's a Michelangelo, if you ask a bear."
"6873190","6875770"," We'd rather have the 38c for 1230."
"6876010","6876470"," Yeah, I like that. "
"6876590","6877290"," I like that better."
"6877350","6878070"," I like that better."
"6878250","6879190"," 38c Herms. "
"6881170","6881850"," Then 390."
"6882290","6883670"," I'm going to watch in the 390s."
"6884650","6886030"," So here's the example. "
"6887730","6888590"," So, okay."
"6888890","6893950"," So just right now, it's not either you want to buy the 390s."
"6894530","6897010"," You're watching for you. "
"6897230","6898030"," Sometimes you'll see."
"6899470","6901090"," He's made a good point."
"6904970","6908290"," I like the idea of the 388c as well. "
"6909410","6911050"," The point I'm trying to make with the."
"6913170","6915210"," If you're a bear and you're in puts, right?"
"6916250","6917490"," You'll see a moment where."
"6918230","6919770"," I don't care if the turn is here. "
"6920490","6921990"," I don't care if the turn is here."
"6923270","6929070"," Whether you're seeing a major market turn up or down, but this really works well on calls."
"6929910","6936010"," You'll you'll see it's like like right here and you'll see calls that are like a 100 points away. "
"6936230","6939130"," They'll stop losing money."
"6939250","6943110"," If they're like a week or two out and they'll start gaining money as you come down here."
"6944730","6945610"," Same for puts. "
"6946010","6948750"," You'll see on the tops when we're on tops as well."
"6949690","6955490"," And you can usually just keep like a screener open with a round number like 390, 380."
"6956890","6959570"," Put circles and if you're seeing a start top. "
"6961750","6962690"," Like a real top."
"6962970","6964690"," You'll see them like 100 points away though."
"6965090","6969430"," You know, they'll lose like half value or add like half value to whatever they were at that at that"
"6969430","6969970"," big turn. "
"6971910","6973730"," You can see those spy contracts."
"6973790","6978510"," If you like wherever the implied move is, anything outside of that move, they're worth like"
"6978510","6978950"," pennies."
"6979930","6983030"," And if we start to if we if they start to if the market make a certain thing, we're going"
"6983030","6984430"," to trade outside of that range. "
"6985190","6987210"," Some range expansion and we're heading that way."
"6987330","6992790"," You'll see like you see like 10 cent calls just start cranking, even though we're going down."
"6994770","6996190"," Just watching it as a."
"6997230","6998610"," I entered it for a minute, but. "
"6999650","7000970"," I want to see that that turn."
"7001310","7003770"," I want to see that build on the back end."
"7016230","7017810"," I'm not I'm not seeing it right now. "
"7029210","7035430"," Yeah, Dixie Dixie Dixie fucking sold off for a minute."
"7036030","7039350"," Tesla dude 112 93 new lows on Tesla."
"7046130","7050170"," I bet every Tesla bull in the world hates me posting that this morning. "
"7052650","7053930"," They shouldn't hate me."
"7055370","7056830"," I'm a fucking Tesla bull."
"7064390","7066070"," Oh man, you guys ready?"
"7070530","7072810"," 95 70 on Tesla. "
"7077890","7079690"," 95 70."
"7083690","7087830"," Talk about being a fucking Tesla bull 95 70."
"7089190","7089950"," Eight dollars away. "
"7092830","7097210"," Tesla having a capitulation moment now trading 112 88."
"7098870","7100870"," 95 70 is not far away."
"7101670","7104650"," It's not eight dollars away. "
"7107330","7109250"," That's crazy."
"7111050","7113230"," You all watching Tesla right now?"
"7113890","7116630"," Tesla's having a fucking bloodbath right now."
"7120610","7121790"," Fucking straight bloodbath. "
"7140190","7142630"," One 12 88 trading on Tesla right now."
"7143510","7144630"," Do I even get there this week?"
"7144870","7145770"," Yeah, yeah, I do."
"7148270","7149630"," I didn't get there before the end of the year. "
"7160130","7162230"," I don't post that shit lightly on Twitter."
"7163410","7164350"," Like shit like that."
"7164450","7165290"," I don't post that shit lightly. "
"7168990","7170550"," I'll shit post on Twitter."
"7173750","7177110"," But stuff like that, what I'm serious and I post that shit on Twitter."
"7178150","7180050"," I just even post that I'm going to look serious, I'm serious. "
"7186690","7191770"," Getting a little bounce right now, 112 80 on Tesla."
"7196290","7197730"," It's not a volume spike though."
"7202750","7204030"," Yeah, I think we can trade down there. "
"7204170","7205250"," It's eight fucking dollars away."
"7205470","7206090"," Might as well, right?"
"7208890","7209830"," We're already down here."
"7210150","7214150"," If you're a Tesla bull and you close every gap down below, put that shit. "
"7214270","7215310"," You put that feather in your cap."
"7215550","7216770"," That means we come back down there."
"7217410","7221170"," If we have macro conditions, let's say we're going low, we will. "
"7221870","7229630"," But if you're looking for a bounce, you close every gap on a year chart on Tesla, you're going to"
"7229630","7230090"," get a reaction."
"7233730","7235630"," Spy rolling over now in the five minute chart."
"7254760","7256480"," Oh, yeah, we're talking about that earlier. "
"7256880","7258720"," Tesla's going to fucking rip face in January."
"7262160","7264840"," I believe that the Tesla's going to rip face."
"7265000","7271620"," Well, if all those puts roll off for the for this past year and Tesla can get down there and"
"7271620","7276220"," it kind of matches up in time, like, let's say we get December 30th, we hit 95 bucks. "
"7277900","7278780"," 9570 or something."
"7279620","7280660"," That would make sense, right?"
"7284060","7285480"," And then you get your face ripper."
"7286100","7287400"," I think that was the one key. "
"7288620","7289820"," I think the one key."
"7290020","7293640"," Everyone's saying it's based upon the Tesla numbers coming out in January."
"7293760","7294020"," It's not. "
"7294680","7298760"," It has more to do with options positioning in the market."
"7299660","7304760"," I think Russia's Putin signs a decree on Russia's response to Western oil price cap."
"7305360","7313380"," If a Tesla bull just focused on when we come into January, if those puts aren't rerolled into the"
"7313380","7317800"," stock, buy that dip for the all those puts to roll off Tesla. "
"7319840","7325300"," It happens between now and the 30th."
"7326140","7332540"," So you don't know what bottom is on Tesla, but you do have some idea of the gaps below, right?"
"7332820","7336560"," And one of those gaps is at 90 set 95 70 96 bucks."
"7339720","7341040"," There's things you can look for. "
"7341160","7342700"," You can look for a big giant volume spike."
"7343780","7346180"," That capitulation move that bloodbath."
"7346540","7347340"," It's happening right now. "
"7348020","7349500"," There could be more to come."
"7351420","7353060"," If those gaps aren't closed."
"7353380","7355880"," If you're a bull, you want to see those gaps closed hands down. "
"7356640","7359580"," It's a no brainer as a bull to want to see those gaps closed."
"7367900","7368820"," It doesn't."
"7369180","7370240"," It doesn't matter. "
"7370600","7371140"," Price doesn't."
"7371320","7371400"," Everyone."
"7372140","7374080"," Everyone focuses always focuses on price. "
"7375120","7379700"," The key things you're looking for on Tesla is you're looking for a giant volume spike."
"7379700","7382420"," You're looking for like a fucking hammer candle out of nowhere."
"7383080","7383500"," Big one. "
"7384240","7385720"," Like big giant green bar."
"7386780","7387660"," It'll be fast."
"7388080","7389680"," It can happen in after hours. "
"7390220","7392060"," It can happen in pre market."
"7392260","7393840"," It can happen during the daytime."
"7395880","7400320"," It should happen sometime between now and January or December 30th. "
"7403220","7403860"," All right."
"7403980","7406300"," You've got tax off season harvesting ending."
"7407140","7408920"," You've got money wanting to be deployed. "
"7410680","7412760"," You've got capitulation."
"7413500","7415460"," You've got margin calls coming out on Tesla."
"7415720","7417640"," You've got all these mechanics working in the background. "
"7418380","7423720"," And then you want to see if the year long puts on Tesla are rolled into a new put position."
"7424320","7429040"," If they're if they're pulled off, it could be a rip that just ends like you rip."
"7429460","7431100"," You get a van a trade and then it stops. "
"7431860","7440700"," If you get a van a trade and then you get no rolling of puts for 2023 on Tesla, it"
"7440700","7442860"," could extend right for the whole month or two."
"7444020","7446580"," But I wouldn't be looking at price necessarily biggest."
"7446920","7450820"," The only indicator in price you can really take here is where the gaps are below. "
"7451540","7454380"," That really is because that's where your real two levels are."
"7454380","7457040"," As once those gaps get filled, it's a level."
"7457300","7458460"," It's a Putin degree balance. "
"7458740","7461740"," It's applied oil to clients that comply with the Western price cap."
"7462060","7466740"," So again Putin's degree balance the supply of oil to clients that comply with the Western price"
"7466740","7467100"," cap."
"7467400","7469820"," Let's take a bit of upside moving in WTI crude here. "
"7469980","7472180"," I'll trade one 1273 on Tesla."
"7480280","7481980"," I'm trying to look back here."
"7483280","7486280"," The background here, I'm trying to see if there's anything I'm missing here. "
"7486480","7491900"," But yeah, that's the only gap to $23."
"7492780","7500400"," The only gap left to fill is $95.95 and change."
"7501940","7503440"," It's the only gap left to fill. "
"7504080","7513920"," There's a place between $64 and that gap that could"
"7513920","7514400"," get erased."
"7515140","7520960"," Well, you'd need to probably need to see market capitulation along with it."
"7521920","7527660"," So more color is Putin's degree comes into force on February 1st and remains in place into July 1st"
"7527660","7528460"," of 2023. "
"7530220","7536680"," If you want to see Tesla get down to the 60s, 65 bucks, you probably need to see spy roll"
"7536680","7539780"," over and retest the previous low from October."
"7540380","7541600"," Weekly moving average."
"7542220","7543980"," There's something else for you to look at too. "
"7544620","7546140"," I'll show you guys something else right now."
"7546820","7547600"," Hold on here."
"7549340","7550540"," I'll show you guys some cool. "
"7554140","7561720"," There is this like, like does the door get opened down below?"
"7563380","7564760"," I'll do this somewhere else."
"7565060","7565760"," I'll do it over here."
"7570900","7579360"," I was looking at this one month, monthly and clear all this out. "
"7587160","7589040"," I got the weekly moving average."
"7590460","7591820"," I'm going to move an average."
"7592680","7595040"," Yeah, we're going to do the 50, I think. "
"7598260","7599360"," I was looking at this."
"7602240","7603140"," No, no, no."
"7603520","7604540"," Hold on a second here, guys. "
"7608060","7609620"," The weekly right there and the weekly."
"7612320","7613400"," Let me just sit here."
"7615600","7617640"," Yeah, set this up for you. "
"7618500","7620080"," The 50, the style."
"7622480","7624100"," Yeah, we'll do the line, we'll do the blue."
"7624620","7625200"," We should do the yellow. "
"7626860","7629480"," We'll make it kind of thick here so you can see it."
"7639000","7644940"," Okay, you're kind of coming in."
"7653800","7655280"," Let me bring this up for you guys. "
"7664700","7666360"," It's a pretty simple chart, right?"
"7667140","7670020"," Yeah, I think I saw hose or someone said we're going down here."
"7673400","7675580"," This yellow line here is the 50."
"7676300","7685260"," This is SPX, I believe. "
"7685260","7690040"," You get the double bottom here, do you get the triple bottom down here?"
"7690220","7692180"," You got the other head and shoulders hidden here, too."
"7693420","7694280"," Right there, there's one."
"7694880","7699360"," If we can get above it, you'll see the move higher, but it's a pretty simple chart. "
"7699980","7700840"," It's not really what you're looking at."
"7700920","7709780"," You're looking at the confluence of this right here and"
"7709780","7713660"," this right here."
"7713660","7720320"," What makes this important here is where SPY goes. "
"7720980","7724560"," So we know historically what happens at this confluence here."
"7724940","7730120"," It's a three month bills, total seven spot of $1 billion, six month bills, total $6 billion."
"7731020","7733300"," You can get like a year long bull run, believe it or not. "
"7734680","7741460"," If we go below it, historically it ends in some pretty rough."
"7744280","7746780"," Rough start trading below this down here, right?"
"7748400","7749900"," It can get really ugly."
"7750460","7754140"," It's kind of like a confluence here, right, where the confluence of two rivers. "
"7755100","7759200"," You get a river here and a river here and you're going to get a break one way or another."
"7760120","7763400"," There's not a lot of time left for this to happen."
"7763740","7768220"," So let's just say it's right here. "
"7768440","7769280"," That's March, right?"
"7769860","7771220"," Let me see you right there in March."
"7772720","7775500"," You're going to know by March, which way we're breaking."
"7775940","7779000"," Now I'm going to show you previous history, what I'm talking about. "
"7779080","7779380"," I watch that."
"7779480","7781980"," Remember that yellow line coming down upon the red, right?"
"7784600","7790140"," The yellow line comes down to break above the yellow line and we're off and running, right?"
"7791320","7795460"," So bulls have to like March, right?"
"7795460","7800740"," Bulls want to be getting above this yellow line right here, right?"
"7802140","7803820"," It's kind of like a confirmation thing."
"7804000","7804380"," Where are we?"
"7805080","7808640"," If you're a bear and you're like, we're going to go to the depths of power and if you see"
"7808640","7817360"," us break above here, you would really want to reconsider your positioning and your market outlook"
"7817360","7819780"," to kind of see where it happens here, right?"
"7821440","7824100"," Let's look for where the yellow line crosses, what happens. "
"7826600","7828640"," And here's an example of it right here, right?"
"7829860","7835400"," You don't want to see that 50 and us trade under the weekly."
"7836320","7838220"," You see that 50 come down like that."
"7838340","7840080"," It gets nasty every single time. "
"7842000","7843580"," We'll look at other examples of it here."
"7845700","7846200"," See it right here."
"7848220","7852660"," This is the 50 on the 200 weekly moving average on a weekly chart. "
"7853700","7856720"," Do you see a start to move down in a below here?"
"7857680","7859400"," You really can't call this stuff either."
"7859960","7864220"," You can have me or anyone else out there like I can be playing with baseball that same or going"
"7864220","7864640"," to the moon."
"7865340","7867480"," And you can see people say we're going to the depths of hell. "
"7868480","7870640"," But this is kind of what's going to show you the way."
"7871400","7876560"," The cool part about this though is here's an example of a rip, right?"
"7876760","7880500"," Traded below it, fought our way back on, and it was off and run to the races."
"7882260","7887880"," This is a pretty vicious one right here, but again, we're not below the weekly moving average. "
"7888800","7890600"," Not below the weekly moving average."
"7894660","7898980"," Went below the weekly moving average, fought our way back, off and run."
"7900660","7905340"," So if you're going to take that bear trade below, you're like, okay, I'm getting super bearish. "
"7905920","7910900"," You're going to have a stop loss right back up here where that 50 and 200 weekly is, right?"
"7912200","7914440"," Because you'll get destroyed in here if you don't."
"7915280","7919100"," So you can trade this down, but you still need a stop loss for that move lower."
"7920120","7921380"," This is back in 1982. "
"7925000","7926420"," Same kind of a deal here, right?"
"7928720","7934420"," Come down here, you cross, you take the bearish trade, but you still put the stop loss there in"
"7934420","7937220"," case the trade's back above and traps you if you're a bear."
"7939720","7942340"," But whenever we've crossed like this, right, it is nasty."
"7942420","7946220"," You start to see that the yellow line come down, screaming down over here. "
"7946660","7948000"," We're not even trading to the 50."
"7950800","7952620"," Back to a one day, one year."
"7954700","7955480"," Hold on here. "
"7958600","7960300"," Weekly here, where's the weekly?"
"7962320","7966280"," And notice we haven't, we haven't touched the yellow line, right?"
"7966460","7968420"," We want to see us not touch that yellow line."
"7969100","7970500"," Bears don't want us getting near it."
"7970740","7972400"," We want to see us like trade below it. "
"7973080","7977320"," We want to see the yellow lines kind of stay above as you break below here."
"7977320","7979620"," You don't want to see the yellow line come right down here."
"7980060","7980680"," This is my point. "
"7981140","7983400"," You don't want to see the yellow line like right up on."
"7983680","7985120"," You want to see the yellow line over here."
"7985600","7989260"," You want to see this weakened into and slip below the weekly moving average. "
"7995300","7996400"," So it hasn't happened yet."
"7996580","8000260"," So even if it does happen, it doesn't mean that it's blood."
"8000460","8007180"," It just means your position or your thesis has some validity to it. "
"8025320","8026220"," Weekly is gaps."
"8026820","8027340"," Only one with gap."
"8027680","8029080"," 95, 60, 70 or so. "
"8029320","8030180"," That's what I'm looking for."
"8030180","8034620"," Since I'm in this time now at the bottom of the hour, US due to sell $54 billion in three"
"8034620","8035120"," month bills."
"8035620","8039900"," Private to cover is two to 57 with a prior high yield of four spot to 9%. "
"8039900","8045580"," US is also selling $45 billion in six month bills with a prior bid to cover of two to 86."
"8046320","8048560"," And the prior high yield of four spot to five five percent."
"8050420","8058720"," One of those two lines, it's a 200 weekly moving average and a 50 moving average on a weekly chart. "
"8060880","8062400"," You want to see him, I'll bring him back up."
"8064020","8065280"," So you can put him on your own chart."
"8068780","8072080"," Like do yourself or something and keep an eye on this. "
"8072760","8073960"," Check back on this every week."
"8074100","8075120"," I look at it every week."
"8075800","8076760"," So you can too. "
"8084560","8088000"," This is a, you can look this up under indicators."
"8088000","8090280"," The red one is weekly moving average."
"8092640","8094920"," As you can see it up here, weekly moving average. "
"8095340","8095840"," It's call limit."
"8097500","8098240"," Hold on here."
"8099040","8099740"," Can't see it. "
"8099980","8100320"," Can you?"
"8104980","8106220"," You can see it right there."
"8107060","8107320"," Hold on here."
"8109120","8111000"," I'm going to move my camera a little bit. "
"8111000","8111940"," Hold on a second here."
"8120100","8120860"," Give me a second."
"8128620","8130040"," You see it right here. "
"8131000","8133240"," Weekly MA and then MA."
"8133700","8134580"," MA is set to 50."
"8135520","8137920"," Weekly MA is just called the weekly moving average. "
"8137920","8140300"," It's 200 weekly moving average."
"8141000","8142680"," Just put on the weekly moving average."
"8142680","8145300"," It stays the same across all time, time frames. "
"8146080","8148100"," And then that's SPX on the week, on a one week chart."
"8148500","8148940"," It's real simple."
"8152540","8153560"," A second here. "
"8167920","8169380"," Is that my pretty again?"
"8178620","8180320"," Can you see SPY up there?"
"8181980","8183820"," I don't know if you can't account."
"8187420","8188300"," I think you can."
"8197920","8211440"," I'm"
"8211440","8211520"," looking"
"8211520","8227719"," at"
"8227719","8227900"," oil right now. "

"8275459","8276860"," 11186 on Tesla."
"8280400","8282320"," H.Y.G. Looking weak."

"8301100","8302920"," XLU is cranking right now. "
"8304459","8305280"," XLU is about to rip."
"8306080","8308639"," You can jump on XLU for a quick rip."
"8315620","8316680"," 5WM is about to rip. "
"8321559","8324120"," So we're now five minutes away from the bottom of the hour."
"8324420","8327219"," And the release of the US three-end six-month bill auctions."
"8327799","8330139"," You're selling $54 billion in three-month bills. "
"8330139","8332040"," The private cover of two to 57."

"10933380","10942090"," There's the support still here giant fucking gap over here to fill so truly You're"
"10942090","10957450"," looking for something in here Make sense The"
"10957450","10962170"," The other part of this is you've got a ton of trap buyers in here, and that's what they did"
"10962170","10968470"," here is they sold you back over Let's see if the wear out those sellers, so it's not that we're"
"10968470","10969150"," going down here."

"10980490","10990350"," You might have one more dip to buy down there Down the road this is March So that's all I"
"10990350","10997450"," can tell you about but I'm gonna assume that you're gonna trade in here Into March That's my"
"10997450","11003370"," assumption If you break apart if you if you're able to break above here And that means you've worn"
"11003370","11008610"," out these sellers and these sellers and these sellers And you'll start looking for this gap to fill"
"11008610","11014810"," above and this one over here But until you wear out these sellers over here, I'm gonna expect"
"11014810","11025630"," consult more consolidation for NVIDIA So"
"11025630","11032430"," if you can I would say it is probably a really decent like Buy a dip once a month and"
"11032430","11040110"," sell a rip once a month I had to fight a If I to talk about NVIDIA do I think"
"11040110","11045410"," NVIDIA is going to the fucking moon tomorrow probably not or this month probably not It's probably"
"11045410","11051170"," gonna be like a work in progress You can find like the fine time where support is find what the"
"11051170","11059230"," sellers are Take the the capitulation trade at 128 135 grab that it'll trade back up more than"
"11059230","11065530"," likely and then you'll find more sellers come down As soon as those are worn out that makes a new"
"11065530","11076160"," level higher you'll you can pick up that trade again Yeah spies not down yet Spy's"
"11076160","11077200"," still trying to break higher. "
"11077760","11087100"," I have this I Have this feeling that spy is going to fucking just we have years into December 30th"

"11111300","11122110"," four fucking days to get there Five days to get there trading higher now in the spy Hopefully"
"11122110","11132400"," get a squeeze out of this our step right back in again NVIDIA"

"11828330","11838150"," matter of fact we'll go back and look at Tesla real quick So you saw that tee off right so"

"11926920","11932620"," looks to me like there's deployment of money in spy right now to be honest with you Now if you"
"11932620","11954730"," look at the S&P 500 it looks like it's being brought to me I Don't"
"11954730","11955190"," know chase."
"11955350","11956390"," I don't know what you're talking about man."
"11957510","11974260"," It's a Tesla or a temple spy Yeah, I"
"11974260","11975760"," agree I agree James. "
"11976000","11981720"," I don't think it's I think it's gonna be a slow grind into into Friday I think if you're gonna"
"11981720","11992880"," buy a dip it's somewhere down on this this blue dotted line Chase what are you saying about If"
"11992880","12000600"," you look at the S&P 500 there's money being spent on Underlying stocks of the S&P 500 right"
"12000600","12003060"," now you can see it the last three days."
"12003240","12005520"," We're up There's no that we haven't been down."
"12005940","12010020"," Well, anyone's telling you Defiant guru. "
"12010300","12010520"," How are you?"
"12011620","12012640"," That's a big name song."
"12012880","12019520"," Yeah, but but they're not the S&P 500 So There's two things going on right now."
"12019620","12025300"," You're seeing high fires You're seeing high fires get knocked down, right?"
"12027620","12036320"," For yearly puts right you're also seeing money be deployed in the market right now So what is the"
"12036320","12042080"," trend been then the blast three days up up up right?"
"12043640","12050300"," So until you break that trend It's still up It's by way to trade down right now to right here. "
"12050480","12051520"," That's still up."
"12051700","12052220"," Does that make sense?"
"12053260","12063540"," So you're gonna you're gonna need a trend break for any kind of a We're selling Oh, say yeah So"
"12063540","12071560"," you see that trend break And even if you see it just slightly it has to hold It looks like"
"12071560","12078200"," a classic it looks like a classic Santa rally classic They're like they did it's just a slow grind"
"12078200","12088010"," up into the 30th Now underlying tickers might be getting wrecked, but I guarantee for every 10 high"
"12088010","12095130"," fires that are getting wrecked There's probably another 30 They're being bought right now in the S "
"12095130","12098970","&P so Do I think that's gets sold off?"
"12099290","12102030"," Yes, it's probably not until Friday."
"12102210","12107750"," That's the problem Like is there a bloodbath here probably when whatever it was back from the"
"12107750","12118670"," Hamptons probably when they sell it out Yeah Yeah,"
"12118670","12128590"," I agree with that chase There's not much going on I can't I guess I"
"12128590","12138410"," would say is If you're a bear you're selling all this up here, right"
"12138410","12146250"," if you're a bull you're buying all this until some changes This this dotted blue and we'll make"
"12146250","12155190"," this Christmas colors So you're selling the red and you're buying the green It's fairly simple"
"12155190","12163790"," and I wouldn't fuck around in the middle here If you're already in puts here you're good to go if"
"12163790","12173120"," you're already in calls here you're good to go So So I wouldn't fuck around with any of this bull"
"12173120","12179980"," or bear just take if you can take it here take it If you get the role I guess in"
"12179980","12185550"," the five minute you can take this down But I wouldn't chase the hole down here. "
"12186050","12186530"," Uh-oh."
"12186810","12190750"," I wouldn't take I wouldn't chase a hole down here And I wouldn't chase a rip up here either."
"12190750","12191550"," I'd be very concerned. "
"12191970","12200380"," That's gonna get sold And what's the what's the 30th look like for?"
"12201100","12212830"," So here's another interesting point That whatever the Take"
"12212830","12215790"," here, you know, like what do they have to do they have to sell it down a little bit to"
"12215790","12222150"," get the To get the JPM print is like right here, right?"
"12222690","12230910"," It's like right here The JPM print so I could just grind higher in the Friday it would be nasty"
"12245470","12256090"," Hold on I would even suspect anything any kind of like I Don't"
"12256090","12260350"," even suspect that any kind of like we've start trading down s2 s3 anything like that's gonna"
"12260350","12269190"," actually come back for for Friday Just for that even that's validating the JPM color, right?"
"12269190","12280880"," We straight out a range is gonna whip lash back at some point into Friday Think"
"12280880","12285340"," I think that JPM color works against bulls and bears not just you know bulls or anything like that"
"12293360","12300440"," All right, so I'm gonna do my I'm gonna do my famous I'm gonna do my famous move here So"

"16560759","16564480"," The xbi has been consistent, huh?"
"16566369","16573450"," That's"
"16575330","16580290"," a good xbi. "
"16582750","16590509"," Yeah, it's xbi."
"16591650","16593150"," We charted that one, didn't we?"
"16603430","16604710"," It's been pretty consistent."
"16619830","16621770"," One, two, three, four. "
"16622330","16624230"," It's getting kind of close, isn't it?"
"16625290","16626590"," To a buy again, isn't it?"
"16626590","16632349"," I remember we were talking about this one right here."
"16632430","16634529"," It's sold right off on that yellow box."
"16641650","16642610"," Ruled right over. "
"16646119","16647240"," xbi is productive."
"16651759","16652340"," So productive."
"16653040","16654500"," It's looking pretty bearish right here still. "
"16663740","16666460"," Let me see what you're saying, buying this dip here with a stop on it."
"16666740","16668400"," That's a pretty good book place to buy, isn't it?"
"16670779","16672360"," Let's see if this holds up right here."
"16699919","16702720"," It's such a sweet-ass ticker. "
"16704619","16705640"," Bio-tech."
"16706840","16716640"," It's like where penny stock traders go or retire to write xbi."
"16727980","16731500"," Yeah, I want my effect to have in check TLT yet today. "
"16734300","16735080"," It's 102."
"16739340","16740640"," That's the thing."
"16740640","16743900"," We're talking about TLT. "
"16744340","16748560"," This is where you want to be looking for entry in TLT."
"16750180","16752820"," I didn't see any calls coming yet on TLT."
"16754900","16760259"," You can kind of see where the original buyers are. "
"16763140","16764800"," They're right where we are."
"16767220","16768460"," See, I'm looking to see."
"16768599","16770380"," I haven't seen any calls structured command yet. "
"16770599","16775200"," So if I see calls structured command, I want to enter this trade again."
"16775320","16776860"," This is a fucking sweet-ass trade."
"16777800","16779280"," This is a great trade right here. "
"16782140","16784160"," Still haven't seen the volume command yet."
"16786440","16787300"," It's in here though."
"16787420","16788220"," You see that right there?"
"16789120","16790180"," Right there on there. "
"16791400","16792980"," Kind of seeing it right now."
"16794300","16796020"," Beautiful gaps to fill above."
"16797620","16801040"," I don't even care if it's like something like this. "
"16803340","16805120"," There's a little bit of a roll here too."
"16805320","16809680"," You got to be careful of on the daily."
"16810060","16812720"," You see that coming over here. "
"16815120","16818260"," I remember people were thinking this is where the buy was and it wasn't."
"16820260","16822740"," People on Twitter supposedly thought that was where the buy was."
"16823520","16829190"," I don't know if I don't think TLT is ready yet. "
"16833050","16833770"," It might be."
"16834290","16835450"," I don't think that it is."
"16838730","16839150"," Yeah. "
"16839950","16841190"," Even if it's just a."
"16842430","16842910"," I don't know."
"16842950","16843750"," Two boxes and really."
"16843810","16845230"," That's kind of a lot right there. "
"16846070","16846970"," I'm watching it."
"16847670","16848750"," I checked the."
"16849330","16849930"," I checked the. "
"16852450","16853620"," Options, but I didn't."
"16854050","16856390"," I was checking this morning, but I'll check them at the end of the day today."
"16857190","16860250"," You can see if anyone starts entering. "
"16863130","16864370"," Garbage on spy, right?"
"16866750","16867650"," Nothing on spy."
"16868570","16869230"," Just sideways."
"16870150","16870930"," It's just kind of gross. "
"16874010","16875290"," It's kind of the same thing, right?"
"16875510","16875670"," Just wait."
"16875830","16877330"," I'm waiting for this if we can get it."
"16878050","16878950"," You can get that one more time. "
"16879070","16879290"," You still."
"16902030","16902430"," Yeah."
"16902570","16904310"," It's pretty much a fucking printing machine. "
"16905250","16906530"," You know, the other one is."
"16918020","16919000"," I took this."
"16919180","16920460"," I took this one right here. "
"16921600","16923260"," Matter of fact, I think I took this twice."
"16923560","16924520"," I think I took this one."
"16924520","16926440"," I took this DIA trade right here. "
"16926580","16927640"," The inverse."
"16928260","16930020"," And I made I did both of these."
"16930940","16935240"," I really want to see DIA come up here and close that gap and then take the next one. "
"16936680","16939080"," This is what I'm waiting for is DIA to get up here."
"16940520","16942460"," If you get up here for the end of the year."
"16943400","16944220"," Really like that. "
"16944580","16945120"," Really like that."
"16945220","16945860"," I mean, I know it shows."
"16947060","16949840"," I guess I would show an inverse head and shoulders too, but. "
"16953420","16954600"," Maybe it fails."
"16957580","16959580"," It fails the inverse head and shoulders."
"16963910","16966470"," I'm going to be looking for some kind of a failure up here. "
"16967530","16968910"," We get a failure up here."
"16969710","16970470"," We don't."
"16970690","16971550"," I don't want to see this. "
"16971830","16974390"," You see this kind of nonsense and we scared of this move."
"16975790","16977330"," But if we get a rejection up here."
"16980520","16982380"," Just concerned to rejection here. "
"16984180","16987640"," If we get that bloodbath for any part of next year."
"16989120","16990240"," I'd like to get that."
"16990420","16992520"," I asked out short for that right there. "
"16993520","16997120"," That would be a banger of a trade."
"17000840","17002840"," I want to see that failure up here."
"17003520","17004820"," It's like three thirty five. "
"17005320","17006120"," Three thirty seven."
"17006120","17006700"," I'm DIA."
"17010320","17014220"," It's probably like a couple thousand percent trade if it happens. "
"17015140","17016800"," Here's February like this."
"17017880","17018660"," Oh, man."
"17018780","17020200"," That would pay so fucking fat. "
"17022560","17023500"," Over there."
"17024680","17030440"," I think I have to get like June or April, May, June to make them print that though."
"17036180","17037340"," All right. "
"17037460","17038280"," Back to the intraday stuff."
"17055250","17056210"," I mean, Tesla."
"17056470","17057590"," I mean, Tesla, man. "
"17060510","17065990"," I'm like, I kind of just want the relief rally on Tesla so that if it's going to hit ninety"
"17065990","17066550"," five."
"17068170","17072530"," You'd expect some kind of a relief rally to get there."
"17087990","17090530"," It's got all kinds of like dogs getting here. "
"17091010","17092110"," It's got like sellers, sellers."
"17093530","17097190"," It's like so much work talking about like Tesla's got like sellers."
"17098510","17099390"," Sellers again. "
"17099870","17100490"," Sellers again."
"17102330","17103570"," They're a little bit weaker here."
"17103750","17106230"," You can see the weakness in the sellers. "
"17106650","17108110"," The sellers are getting weak here."
"17111250","17120310"," But it's like how high does it go before we get down to see a five day here."
"17122950","17128830"," I kind of want like where's the ninety five. "
"17128830","17133890"," The ninety five seventy is right here."
"17140380","17141220"," Right down there."
"17149480","17151760"," It's pretty much a resistance level now, right?"
"17151940","17152440"," One twenty one. "
"17157220","17159840"," So the big ass resistance line right there."
"17172840","17173820"," That's the target."
"17173820","17196300"," That's"
"17196300","17203800"," the target. "
"17225220","17225720"," That's the target."
"17225720","17229080"," Starting at Ducey down here, if we can get down below, if we can get down here at some point"
"17229080","17231440"," today, I'll buy this down here."
"17231660","17236760"," It'd actually be preferential if we can break this pivot. "
"17247200","17249320"," Now Spy looks almost to a buy for me."
"17249600","17253820"," If I can buy this, if I can buy Spy down here, I'd love to buy that right there, that"
"17253820","17254000"," move."
"17255260","17257160"," I just don't know if we're going to get down here or not. "
"17257760","17259300"," I'd like to see us get down there."
"17262440","17265520"," It's worked, I don't know, a bunch."
"17266020","17274120"," It's worked like. "
"17279580","17283500"," It worked pretty good down here, worked pretty good down here, worked pretty good down here."
"17287060","17289120"," So anything down here I think is going to be."
"17289940","17295700"," I'm assuming that I'm assuming that Chase is maybe saying, looking for this and then a break below"
"17295700","17298660"," down here at S3 or something. "
"17300420","17301620"," Maybe that's what Chase means."
"17309400","17312320"," I mean a one-hour bearish, right?"
"17315020","17317140"," Maybe Chase is talking about the big move down."
"17318960","17321780"," We get that new low over there, that new low over there. "
"17321780","17324400"," Maybe Chase is talking about breaking this."
"17327920","17330980"," And then Chase, you talk about this move down here maybe."
"17331680","17333940"," Into the 30th, 370s. "
"17344200","17345420"," I don't know."
"17345520","17347260"," Yeah, I guess you could possibly get that low."
"17353000","17354500"," You can bloodbath it down here. "
"17354640","17355700"," Then you get that slingshot."
"17359400","17361300"," We have that structure there, right?"
"17361460","17364420"," These are all red bars, red bars, red bars, red bars, red bars."
"17365540","17368420"," It's looking like a right, not a single green bar in here. "
"17375740","17376540"," It's been red bar."
"17376660","17377780"," It's been selling all day long, right?"
"17377960","17381580"," You got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven."
"17383240","17384780"," It's just all selling in here. "
"17385640","17387060"," We'll see if this holds or not."
"17402960","17407240"," It makes you wonder if we'll get 95 on Tesla tomorrow."
"17409440","17412720"," If you had that bloodbath here to get pretty fucking nasty. "
"17424440","17425400"," Man, there's some puts there."
"17426120","17430600"," If we can get a little bit more ejection here, I might grab some puts for tomorrow."
"17434240","17435600"," Let me look at that again. "
"17444010","17445170"," I'll tell you what though."
"17445530","17447410"," This is a huge fucking bear trap right here."
"17448110","17449950"," A huge bear trap right here. "
"17450050","17451330"," This is what I was talking about on Twitter."
"17451690","17452190"," Was that move?"
"17452750","17454850"," Was that move and that move right there?"
"17455310","17456890"," You just fucking hammer it."
"17457230","17457450"," Wham. "
"17458390","17458870"," Goodbye."
"17458870","17459270"," Goodbye."
"17459270","17459370"," Goodbye. "
"17489940","17492280"," I just want to see a break of this right here big time."
"17492640","17494220"," Piers do not want to see this hold."
"17494220","17518780"," Hello. "
"17531660","17533060"," Oh, look at that."
"17541450","17542650"," Oh, yeah."
"17542930","17544050"," That's blood right there, baby. "
"17545150","17547130"," That's the Dow Jones industrial average."
"17549470","17550770"," Giant gap below here."
"17552430","17555970"," I might add some puts here. "
"17561210","17563310"," I see they put this on a one minute here."
"17575240","17576700"," What is that down there?"
"17576700","17578760"," 3D."
"17591900","17593880"," Look at that 3DPs. "
"17599280","17601440"," This is back to Spy real quick."
"17615700","17617800"," I'm going to be looking at a bloodbath here in just a couple seconds."
"17622760","17625720"," Can I figure on the trigger for some 3DPs?"
"17626400","17628480"," They're like 32 cents right now. "
"17629460","17631600"," I'm going to wait and see if we can get a rejection above here."
"17632420","17634640"," We're looking for a rejection coming up here in just a minute."
"17635500","17637420"," Price started down below at least 380. "
"17644120","17645880"," This is the DJIA."
"17645940","17650540"," I want to see a rejection here somewhere in here."
"17651500","17653240"," There's a gap below, big one. "
"17657660","17659320"," I don't know where it is."
"17661700","17663580"," It's at 330."
"17665800","17667600"," The old fat gap right there. "
"17676980","17680740"," We just gap higher on Dow Jones industrial average."
"17682520","17687720"," I want to keep an eye on Spy right here."
"17690700","17692120"," Let's see if they sell this. "
"17692120","17721240"," This"
"17721240","17722100"," is pretty cool."
"17751240","17751800"," Look for a sell-off 38193."
"17754300","17782340"," This"
"17782340","17783280"," is pretty cool. "
"17802400","17803480"," Spy is better for puts."
"17803780","17813260"," No way, shape or form."
"17814240","17822980"," I can get a triple leveraged inverse CTF or inverse CTN. "
"17826660","17828800"," Three months out, four months out."
"17830900","17836040"," Spy right now could probably go to 410 and I wouldn't feel anything."
"17840240","17842560"," It's a really nice market hedge. "
"17842740","17844840"," It's not actually puts, it's a market hedge."
"17845720","17847020"," It does very well."
"17847580","17853560"," It holds its value and any time there's any interest in the market crash, it's just fucking, it"
"17853560","17854080"," just prints. "
"17855400","17856180"," It's fucking awesome."
"17856920","17860260"," My favorite market hedge, especially right now in Spy."
"17863920","17865420"," Spy Dow Jones. "
"17873840","17875680"," Still watching, still flat right now."
"17880370","17883610"," Looking for this, the five-minute is right here."
"17884510","17886750"," I'm just looking for this to roll here at some point. "
"17898250","17901710"," Just so you guys can see this."
"17901930","17908590"," If you're a bear, what you're looking for is this is your actual sell right here."
"17909650","17910790"," It's the big one right here. "
"17914830","17916250"," This is the bloodbath right here."
"17918330","17919650"," So you want this five minute."
"17923790","17925090"," This is like a big move. "
"17925230","17927190"," You want to see this five minute come down here."
"17928110","17929710"," And this should be the money maker."
"17930190","17930470"," Should be. "
"17936870","17939190"," We'll look at it on a one hour and see if that was a green candle."
"17939570","17940070"," It wasn't."
"17940790","17942790"," The holes are still losing there, you can see it right. "
"17943370","17944650"," We're actually looking for this."
"17945170","17946970"," It's kind of been like a battle here right?"
"17947210","17948390"," See these indecision candles?"
"17949410","17951190"," Indecision candles, indecision candles."
"17951330","17957630"," You really need like, you need a capitulation candle like this. "
"17977070","17979890"," One, two, three, four."
"17980830","17982370"," That's really all bears got."
"17982790","17984190"," This should have been fucking blood. "
"17986430","17987870"," This one right here should have been blood."
"17988130","17990550"," Like this one should have went right straight down to the depths of hell."
"17994450","17996030"," I don't think I was here for most of this. "
"17996290","17997350"," Maybe I just cut the end of it."
"18017620","18020000"," Yeah, like I said, it went below like 25."
"18023480","18024760"," I'm not looking at it right now. "
"18026100","18028520"," Yeah, I think Tesla's trying to make its way higher too."
"18028600","18029820"," Tesla's fighting down here."
"18030840","18034680"," The only thing I would say about Tesla here is when we're spending this much time down here in"
"18034680","18037060"," Tesla, it fucking sells out into the day. "
"18037800","18040000"," So I don't know what to say about Tesla right now."
"18040460","18041500"," It keeps breaking above."
"18042520","18044540"," Like Tesla's been teasing all day long. "
"18049180","18051120"," Like it broke above here."
"18052040","18054260"," This is a nice move down here broke above."
"18056100","18058160"," This is another nice move right here. "
"18058200","18058840"," This is a good move."
"18059820","18060500"," Decent prints."
"18061280","18063000"," I'm going to have his third one. "
"18063080","18064400"," One, two, three."
"18064560","18068800"," If you can't get out on your third try, it's not good."
"18072600","18082400"," You want to see like, that's not bad, five"
"18082400","18084120"," million, two million. "
"18084360","18085020"," This actually pretty good."
"18085860","18086620"," Eight million."
"18087560","18089560"," It's actually pretty good numbers on Tesla. "
"18089640","18090500"," That's a good squeeze here."
"18092360","18092980"," One hour."
"18093220","18093920"," I'll sit at the one hour. "
"18098880","18099780"," Twenty million."
"18100520","18101160"," Holy shit."
"18101360","18101720"," Thirty million. "
"18106580","18107940"," This is pretty good."
"18108180","18109800"," You guys be careful on Tesla here."
"18110380","18111520"," Tesla might squeeze today. "
"18117720","18120940"," One hundred fifty three hundred sixty three million."
"18121380","18122320"," Two hundred and ten million."
"18132660","18134320"," We're fucking trying at least. "
"18135180","18136680"," It's the twenty second."
"18136680","18146680"," I mean, this is what we got on"
"18146680","18148420"," the twenty second with that kind of volume."
"18150900","18154520"," Not really, you know, that's the pretty much the same volume. "
"18157440","18160100"," Maybe we get some constructive and they sell it back down tomorrow."
"18171470","18174270"," I see what you're saying about Tesla being constructive, but."
"18184610","18185890"," Still say dog shit. "
"18195610","18197410"," Yeah, James, there's a."
"18199730","18201570"," It's constructive right now."
"18203050","18205570"," It's a weird constructiveness though, James."
"18205890","18206170"," It's like. "
"18207850","18208810"," I would be."
"18209490","18212650"," I would be fucking closing it by the bell."
"18213670","18214850"," If it goes up here. "
"18216090","18217690"," I'd fucking be closing that shit."
"18219790","18221730"," If it's like a one hour play or something."
"18230470","18231230"," It's got buy. "
"18231410","18233310"," It's got some fucking volume buyers down here."
"18234150","18235990"," And it had some volume buyers down here."
"18239470","18240930"," Someone's accumulating down here. "
"18241050","18241430"," I know that."
"18242550","18244910"," Someone was accumulating on the twenty second too."
"18245970","18248950"," So maybe in a longer time frame, they don't care. "
"18254710","18256830"," You make it some constructiveness out of this."
"18259030","18261850"," I'd be looking for like one fourteen twenty six or something."
"18270830","18272550"," Could be a bear trap in here too. "
"18274010","18276230"," Could be a bear trap somewhere down in here."
"18277470","18278450"," It's tough to say."
"18279190","18281090"," You could take a long for Friday in here. "
"18282870","18285250"," That's like a spread right where you are right now."
"18286430","18289310"," And as long as you don't break this big green line right here."
"18293330","18295710"," This is going to be a right now. "
"18295870","18296510"," It's right now."
"18296670","18297250"," It's a bear trap."
"18299850","18304290"," If it doesn't break this green line, it'll flip into a fucking bull trap in a second. "
"18304530","18307570"," But there's a bear trap forming in here."
"18309870","18310530"," So far."
"18311490","18312770"," I guess they're going to call that a diamond. "
"18319350","18321130"," You get like a neckline right here."
"18321330","18323150"," It'd be one, two, three, boom."
"18323310","18324210"," It rocket ships up. "
"18354730","18356210"," We're looking for a bloodbath."
"18385750","18387250"," Yeah."
"18387770","18388520"," Yeah. "
"18388520","18388900"," There's a."
"18390160","18391020"," There's a."
"18394420","18398000"," The spy is bearish down here to 380."
"18400100","18401140"," Right now."
"18402780","18404760"," Tesla though is. "
"18405900","18406800"," They're accumulating."
"18407760","18409800"," I don't care how bear share on Tesla."
"18410580","18412180"," They're fucking buying it, dude. "
"18413220","18414760"," They're buying it like hand over fist."
"18414760","18416100"," Or not every day."
"18416220","18418000"," They bought it hand over fist in the 22nd. "
"18418140","18419800"," They're buying it hand over fist right now."
"18420500","18421240"," Since like."
"18422280","18423080"," I don't know. "
"18423260","18424680"," 12 o'clock they started buying it."
"18429100","18430580"," So someone's accumulating it."
"18432040","18433260"," Probably fucking Mike Wilson. "
"18435460","18436640"," Tells you how bearish he is."
"18436840","18438360"," Meanwhile he's in the background buying it."
"18450660","18452360"," It's not bad to own Tesla here. "
"18452600","18457920"," When you think about it, it's like your time horizon like."
"18460120","18464180"," Especially if you're only buying like 10% like somewhere down here."
"18464180","18466160"," 96 bucks is where I want to buy it. "
"18466280","18469080"," But matter of fact, I'll probably long it like permanently."
"18470060","18470940"," If we get $96."
"18471660","18475120"," $95 in Tesla, I'll be permanently back in and Tesla again. "
"18477580","18482280"," In behalf of all just protect the trade, I'll just fucking sell calls and sell books as it goes"
"18482280","18482540"," down."
"18483720","18487380"," And add more, add more at the 60s, add more at the 40s."
"18490440","18493080"," But I'll tell you what, I'm fucking pissed off as a testable. "
"18494140","18495240"," I'm not fucking happy."
"18496000","18497680"," I'm not happy with Elon at all."
"18497960","18499340"," And I'm not happy with progress. "
"18507240","18509340"," To be honest, we kind of need to see like a."
"18511100","18514160"," Remove Elon for a few years then beg him to come back or something."
"18516060","18517840"," Can I just fucking fire his ass?"
"18522600","18525140"," Fucking stock wouldn't fucking moon probably."
"18526720","18529340"," Imagine being short and they had a replacement CEO. "
"18529740","18531820"," I think it would actually moon to be honest with you."
"18533020","18535740"," Maybe it would bloodbath then fucking skyrocket."
"18536120","18537680"," I don't know, something like that. "
"18546360","18547720"," Yeah, it's a fair point, Winky."
"18548360","18552560"," If he just logged out of Twitter, if he just logged off a fucking Twitter."
"18557160","18558480"," It wouldn't be so bad. "
"18560300","18562420"," I know bulls that think that too."
"18563960","18566660"," Like serious, serious Tesla bulls."
"18566660","18568920"," They won't talk about it publicly. "
"18571140","18573440"," They just want him to shut the fuck up for 10 minutes."
"18580740","18583040"," No, it's the same thing that they do with Apple."
"18584180","18587800"," You get rid of Steve Jobs and you bring Steve Jobs back, same kind of a thing. "
"18589540","18591220"," It's like a jump start."
"18591560","18593020"," It's like a paddles."
"18595500","18596620"," It's like a jump start. "
"18598780","18600420"," Create a whole story behind it."
"18601720","18603380"," Elon makes his way back to Tesla."
"18604220","18606580"," Tesla stock just fucking rips to all time highs. "
"18608420","18609400"," It's a story."
"18610700","18612220"," Everybody likes a good story."
"18623140","18623960"," It's a story. "
"18631120","18632660"," He has a nice little cell here, right?"
"18633620","18634940"," Nice little cell right here, right?"
"18640060","18642560"," I want to see that 380 head down below here."
"18647480","18649260"," Those puts are up 30% right now."
"18653620","18655560"," I'm going to see a nice little bloodbath down here. "
"18662900","18664160"," I fucking hate puts."
"18664720","18667660"," I'm looking at them right now and I'm like, I don't know why you ever buy puts."
"18668600","18669340"," They're not built. "
"18674580","18675660"," All right, easy."
"18676720","18677840"," Guru trader, chill out."
"18678960","18680280"," Still out in the background. "
"18689880","18691120"," We should bleed."
"18691340","18692440"," We should bloodbath."
"18693120","18694740"," There should be a bloodbath down here. "
"18696840","18699240"," Fairly confident that we get the bloodbath down there."
"18704820","18706160"," Fairly confident you see that."
"18725900","18730740"," It's not enough where we are, but it's not enough. "
"18734620","18736600"," It's not enough where it's PE ratio is."
"18736700","18738000"," It's not enough for taking profit."
"18738740","18742620"," Nothing you can say works because you know what Tesla, the price Tesla is right now?"
"18743560","18744040"," Nothing. "
"18744360","18747620"," Nothing that a bull says to me right now means anything to me."
"18748980","18749460"," Zero."
"18750160","18756120"," I don't want to hear anything from a bull telling me any bullshit about anything about how positive"
"18756120","18758500"," Tesla is because Tesla's pricing the fucking dumpster. "
"18759560","18763840"," So instead of telling me bull shit as to why it's in the dumpster or bull shit why it should"
"18763840","18770020"," be up or any other nonsense, you have two different heads."
"18770220","18775420"," You've got the, I love Tesla as a company head and then you have to have the head of a"
"18775420","18779560"," trader or an investor and they're two different, they're two different things."
"18781860","18789580"," So like whenever here Tesla bulls try to tell me why this and why that, it never ever fucking"
"18789580","18790620"," matches the price. "
"18791660","18794100"," And so, you know, it's not even pissed off or anything."
"18795000","18801540"," I just, you have to realize that the truck is not, I mean, I could just list them, right?"
"18802360","18803320"," The truck is not out."
"18804160","18812340"," There's real concern about the placement of the seat in the, in the, um, hold on here. "
"18812920","18813380"," Give me a second."
"18818260","18819780"," Yeah, it's going to start bleeding here."
"18835900","18838020"," Yeah, there's, so there's real concerns here. "
"18838200","18841820"," There's concerns with, I mean, we can all argue in the background."
"18841820","18845960"," We can be like, oh, the fact that his attention is on Twitter is better for, I've heard that"
"18845960","18846220"," argument."
"18846320","18849780"," I've heard the argument that it's better that he's focusing on Twitter or not letting the people"
"18849780","18851240"," work at, at Tesla. "
"18852280","18854720"," Then you say, well, what if we remove him for a year or two?"
"18854920","18857020"," You say, no, no, he's, he's everything that's Tesla."
"18857620","18858080"," So it's constant."
"18858440","18859580"," This is constant, constant, constant. "
"18859580","18868240"," The fact is that there's FSD is not being pushed forward with regular people."
"18868480","18874700"," Like, you know, like when you're trying to make inroads in the changing of rules of the road, you"
"18874700","18882680"," need to be, uh, you need to be in the discuss, a positive discussion with the news people, the"
"18882680","18885060"," reporters, and you don't want to hear that, but you do."
"18885820","18888920"," Even if they're going to throw you under a bus, it's kind of like a pay-to-play thing. "
"18889420","18892420"," On a small scale, if you've ever owned a business, you know about this."
"18893080","18894480"," You have to play ball with reporters."
"18895620","18897840"," You don't want to, but you kind of have to. "
"18898680","18901960"," Uh, and it's not because they're always going to be kind to you."
"18902060","18906600"," It's because you're getting the discussion out there with the bureaucracy in our government on a"
"18906600","18908200"," county, state, and federal level."
"18908940","18914380"," Uh, you need to have the conversation, not having a positive conversation with the, the millions,"
"18914660","18922260"," like the little people, the plebs that work in the back offices of our county, state, and federal"
"18922260","18922640"," governments. "
"18922880","18924480"," That, that conversation is not happening."
"18925320","18930360"," Um, you're, you're talking about, uh, the semi, right?"
"18930820","18934620"," They got it, the seats in the middle of the cab and the truckers are like, we don't like this."
"18935480","18937840"," It should be addressed immediately, right?"
"18938100","18938800"," It should be addressed immediately. "
"18939400","18940780"," You want to make truckers happy?"
"18941500","18942180"," You do."
"18942540","18942840"," I'm sorry."
"18942840","18943540"," You got to. "
"18943920","18946500"," Uh, not, not that you have to."
"18946600","18952280"," You can force them into change, but if you're going to force them into change, then at least have"
"18952280","18955680"," to approach the truckers and say, hey, why don't you test this stuff out?"
"18955840","18958960"," Let me, let's get all the truckers, uh, eens out there across the cut."
"18959080","18960480"," There's like some PR about this. "
"18961040","18962080"," That's, that's not flying."
"18963040","18970200"," Uh, then you've got the whole alienating half of, um, half of the people that like Tesla, right?"
"18970200","18975440"," You've got a liberal people that like Tesla and he's alienating them on Twitter."
"18975720","18979520"," Then you're like, okay, so maybe he's attracting a new audience. "
"18980300","18981980"," But then you've got Ford making electric truck."
"18982180","18987760"," You've got all, you know, for everything that a Tesla bull is out there arguing why Tesla's great"
"18987760","18988280"," right now."
"18988700","18994580"," There are some very powerful people from other companies that would like nothing less than to see"
"18994580","18995220"," Tesla fail. "
"18995220","19002260"," And so you got powerful people in politics, you got powerful people in business that want to see"
"19002260","19002840"," Tesla fail."
"19003760","19006440"," So any argument that you have for me is useless."
"19007180","19009960"," Like I want to see, I want to see FSD be legal. "
"19010140","19016700"," I want to see, uh, some better updates on cars, uh, new versions of a Tesla car."
"19016800","19021360"," I want to see, uh, the semi get accepted by the drive, uh, trucker community."
"19021360","19025280"," There's a bunch of stuff that, uh, is not happening, right?"
"19025660","19029700"," I'm not like, I don't know what to say. "
"19029960","19035240"," You know, like the cyber truck is like, it's not out."
"19036200","19038140"," You can make promises all you want."
"19038480","19040140"," And all that shit gets priced in. "
"19040800","19044500"," And when it hasn't happened, they were in the end of a debt short term debt cycle."
"19045140","19046300"," They're going to reprice Tesla."
"19046300","19051460"," So they can run it up again for when that stuff actually does come out. "
"19052220","19053240"," So I don't know."
"19054160","19055260"," I'm a Tesla bull."
"19055500","19063360"," I just, uh, you like, you, uh, you can argue to your, to your blue in the face, but the"
"19063360","19067900"," fact is the truth is that, uh, it's upside down, right?"
"19068160","19068700"," Tesla's burning. "
"19069940","19070760"," That's the truth."
"19070760","19078860"," And so, um, rather than tell me what, why they should be up, tell me why they're down, and then"
"19078860","19080360"," tell me how it comes back up."
"19080780","19081860"," That's the, that's the key. "
"19082100","19087980"," You should be feeling like, or thinking like that as a bull, not even feeling thinking like that."
"19088120","19093940"," You should, there's an options market out there that's like swinging Tesla low into end of year."
"19095260","19102140"," If you were to see new hedging against Tesla in the beginning of the year, you will fucking see"
"19102140","19105180"," Tesla at like 40 bucks, 20 bucks. "
"19105400","19106300"," I kid you not, you will."
"19106760","19108100"," If you don't think so too, right?"
"19108800","19113100"," Uh, I can point out, I can point out when it's happened to Amazon, it's happened to Apple."
"19113860","19115580"," It's happened to the greatest companies in this country. "
"19115600","19119080"," So to say never is absurd."
"19120700","19127480"," Um, you know, I think Apple's going to scream in January, but at the same time, you have to realize"
"19127480","19128400"," that there's profit."
"19128600","19129780"," There's buying and selling. "
"19129960","19134600"," There's accumulation distribution of a stock and they'll use any excuse that they want to and can"
"19134600","19136020"," to dump the price of a stock."
"19136700","19137820"," They'll make shit up."
"19138140","19145360"," The arguments, the argument that even the Elon was making last week about why the stock was down is"
"19145360","19145640"," absurd. "
"19145640","19149100"," It wasn't trading anywhere near what NASDAQ was."
"19150060","19150320"," Right."
"19151460","19154680"," So I just, it's absurd to me. "
"19154840","19155140"," I'm sorry."
"19167460","19167900"," Yeah."
"19168180","19175280"," Yeah, I don't like, I don't, I used to follow. "
"19178400","19181580"," So maybe not a decade close, but not quite a decade."
"19182500","19184620"," I want to say like seven or eight years somewhere in there."
"19184680","19190300"," I have to look back and I've always been a testable. "
"19190600","19200400"," So, um, I don't"
"19200400","19202720"," know what to say to you."
"19206660","19207320"," Hold on a second."
"19244820","19245640"," Hang tight. "
"19245820","19246200"," Just one second."
"19248880","19250720"," There's a, there's a gas line over there."
"19250840","19250920"," Right. "
"19253660","19254640"," And you can pick that."
"19260300","19264040"," Right."
"19265910","19268060"," I'm back with"
"19268060","19280640"," them. "
"19280640","19280820"," Yeah."
"19281040","19287420"," So just back to what I was trying to say to you was if you, it's fine to believe in"
"19287420","19287780"," a company."
"19290900","19291800"," Hold on here. "
"19292180","19293600"," I'm trying to lose my train of thought."
"19294720","19297440"," But when I was a Tesla, what was a Tesla bull, right?"
"19297880","19302700"," When I was a first a Tesla bull, I would listen to people on social media, people in the news."
"19303460","19304720"," So tell me why I should buy a Tesla. "
"19304720","19308140"," And I went down the rabbit holes."
"19308160","19309700"," I was like the smart Tesla bull."
"19310420","19312800"," I drank the Kool-Aid and then I would get smoked. "
"19313940","19315560"," I would get smoked so hard."
"19319260","19325600"," And it sucks because you want to be a Tesla investor and buyer on the lows."
"19326240","19330280"," And you want to know when to accumulate on the lows and you want to know when to take profit"
"19330280","19330960"," on the highs. "
"19331900","19335840"," And there are people that will say to you, well, Cap, if you just buy it for life for 20,"
"19335940","19339980"," 30 years, you'll be well off."
"19340840","19342500"," Or it'll be, you'll be fine, Cap."
"19342760","19344800"," And that's just not always the case with companies. "
"19346780","19348220"," They go through cycles."
"19352000","19358500"," So if you, I don't have a, I don't have someone managing my, my wealth for me."
"19358500","19366240"," So if I'm going to do it myself, then I have, I know for a fact that when I stopped"
"19366240","19371640"," listening, when I stopped being such a rocket scientist on Tesla, it became more profitable on"
"19371640","19371940"," Tesla. "
"19373300","19378180"," And so when you're buying the lows on Tesla, trust me, you feel better."
"19378440","19384440"," I can assure you that when you, when Tesla's in the fucking dumpster, it feels so much better when"
"19384440","19385160"," you buy down there."
"19385160","19390160"," Then when you buy in tops, I can assure you of that. "
"19390920","19395400"," I can assure you that for every one of you that's Tesla bull, that's still a Tesla bull."
"19396020","19403340"," For every one of you, there's like 500 to a thousand that are gone."
"19403960","19404840"," They're just gone. "
"19405080","19409380"," They lost it all every last dollar."
"19410680","19412540"," And it's because they bought it the wrong times."
"19413600","19416140"," It's because they were too smart more than like more than likely to. "
"19417660","19422340"," Too smart for the market, too smart for Tesla, too smart for accumulation and distribution."
"19424760","19425980"," You know, they'll be flat."
"19426320","19432780"," You can look at, you can look at, um, Warren Buffett can show you. "
"19432920","19434900"," You could, like people analyze Warren Buffett."
"19435380","19439780"," If you like bought the wrong times, you'd be right where you were a decade later on some of the"
"19439780","19440820"," best stocks out there."
"19443980","19450900"," So, you know, like that, like even the, uh, the dark cost averaging has to be done at the right"
"19450900","19451240"," times. "
"19467220","19468040"," Yeah, it's okay."
"19468040","19469660"," I love, I mean, I love you, Melio."
"19470060","19470580"," I love all of you. "
"19470680","19471720"," I think I love Tesla bulls."
"19472200","19476960"," I just look at this from the perspective of how many fucking Tesla bulls get fucking smoked and"
"19476960","19477240"," burned."
"19478180","19484300"," If I was a top buyer on Tesla right now, now makes gasoline January futures, settling at $3.36"
"19484300","19484680"," again. "
"19485120","19490000"," If I buy fucking Tesla, like fucking whatever, $1,200, some nonsense."
"19491320","19492620"," And I'm sitting here watching this show."
"19492620","19501840"," I make these all January futures, I think it's $3.35. I would be raging, raging mad, raging mad. "
"19502220","19504000"," And I get DMs from people that bought the top."
"19504480","19505960"," I got them when they're buying the top."
"19508060","19512200"," I mean, like full bore, what you make in five years, ten years, fifteen years. "
"19513100","19514760"," And I'm like, it's not cool."
"19516120","19517600"," It's not cool if they get told."
"19517940","19520800"," I mean, there's tech, there's, there's tweets out there from people. "
"19520800","19526140"," Now makes W.T.I. crude, federal futures, settling at $79.53 a barrel."
"19526660","19527680"," I get the fervor."
"19527760","19528160"," I get it. "
"19530200","19531260"," I get it."
"19531420","19531820"," I get it."
"19531940","19532320"," I get it. "
"19532420","19532800"," I get it."
"19533640","19534000"," I get it."
"19534000","19534160"," I get that. "
"19534420","19537140"," I think as a retail trader that I'm going to make that difference."
"19537800","19538960"," The fact is it's not true."
"19539480","19541440"," The fact is that banks make that decision. "
"19542700","19543900"," Institutions make that decision."
"19544140","19551720"," And now makes natural gas January futures, that's about $5.28. And so as an investor, you have to"
"19551720","19552220"," follow them."
"19552360","19553540"," We are playing in their market. "
"19553800","19554800"," It's not our market."
"19554920","19555600"," It's not your market."
"19556340","19558220"," It's not Elon's market. "
"19558980","19560500"," And we think it is, but it's not."
"19563300","19570140"," So if we love Tesla and we want to play in the market, the public market, which is, you know,"
"19570720","19576040"," the cash stock market, we need to know when to accumulate Tesla stock."
"19576040","19584040"," And I assure you that when you accumulate on a deep low, you feel so much better. "
"19585440","19586900"," And you'll see."
"19588480","19590580"," When we're on a high, how crazy it is."
"19591240","19592120"," Because these people are crazy. "
"19594240","19596400"," I feel like these people are absolutely crazy."
"19597800","19599600"," I'll be talking to you in a few years."
"19600560","19603660"," And you'll be saying, Hey, do we do we sell for profit now?"
"19605460","19608020"," And wait for the next cycle to accumulate again. "
"19608300","19610420"," That's what you'll say in like 5, 10, 15 years."
"19610960","19618680"," The longer you're in the market, the more you realize the ebb and flow of stock prices."
"19619900","19622060"," And you'll become more comfortable with it. "
"19623840","19624840"," I don't know."
"19624880","19625740"," I don't know what to say on that."
"19626660","19627360"," Other than"
"19627360","19639640"," what"
"19639640","19639640"," I said. "
"19642340","19644260"," And we're like mixing up two conversations."
"19644560","19647160"," We can talk all day long about how great Tesla is, but."
"19648240","19652280"," Truth is that Tesla needs to have some kick ass news and not numbers. "
"19654200","19657540"," It's not good enough or it's going to be fun to be good news."
"19657900","19659540"," But it really doesn't make is it real though?"
"19659680","19661920"," Does it really is that the real reason that the price is going up?"
"19662040","19664360"," Or is it because it was accumulated by an institution?"
"19668310","19670670"," I think we're going to get down here and touch touch."
"19673270","19675850"," Touch this touch this little bad right out here or what?"
"19678150","19681070"," But I'm so I'm supremely disappointed right now with. "
"19681650","19684970"," With what Elon's doing while he knows his stock is being."
"19686710","19690670"," So he knows that the stock is being sold out and sold down."
"19691270","19696750"," And I'm supremely disappointed because he has a little base of followers that wants some"
"19696750","19697770"," reassurance from him. "
"19699310","19700770"," And they're not getting it."
"19700970","19703310"," So that pisses me out supremely."
"19711590","19712250"," Touch the tips. "
"19712910","19714730"," I'm supremely that's disappointing."
"19722390","19723590"," Are we going up now?"
"19724110","19724790"," Are we going up here?"
"19727450","19730290"," And I don't think it matters what your politics are either with Elon."
"19730570","19736210"," I think you just I think you want your you want your your favorite CEO to just do their do"
"19736210","19736810"," what they're doing. "
"19737750","19738730"," They're wasting time."
"19738910","19740510"," I don't want Elon wasting his time on Twitter."
"19741150","19741530"," I don't want him. "
"19741710","19742570"," I don't care what he says."
"19742790","19744810"," I don't care if it's Democrat Republican."
"19745550","19747470"," I want him focused on Tesla. "
"19748110","19750150"," I want him focused on the back end of Twitter."
"19751050","19752270"," I want him focused on SpaceX."
"19753630","19758990"," I want him focused on Neuralink and you know all this other stuff that he's involved in. "
"19759070","19760830"," That's what I want to hear from from Elon Musk."
"19761750","19764230"," I want him squandering his time fucking around on Twitter."
"19770290","19771210"," Yeah, I don't want it. "
"19778850","19780850"," No, no, I don't care at all about."
"19781610","19783790"," I don't care at all about the Republican."
"19784190","19785550"," So my I'm a very. "
"19786990","19789810"," You would probably hate me in my politics because."
"19791230","19795490"," You're like I loved like I would if my if he asked my wife my kids."

"20146780","20148660"," You guys are you guys aren't here in Jackhammer in the background."
"20148840","20149080"," That's good."
"20149520","20150400"," I've got I've got a."
"20151260","20153200"," I've got a pretty decent sound mixer. "
"20153200","20153720"," So."
"20160900","20163540"," I hope that I'm keeping up the noise in the background."
"20168040","20170680"," So let's just take a quick quick look around the market. "
"20175280","20178400"," So on the five day here, right?"
"20179000","20181380"," Let's see if we can straighten this out for you."
"20181380","20183820"," So you got two camps here."
"20183920","20184640"," You pretty much have. "
"20185700","20187340"," You pretty much have a."
"20188400","20190440"," You got bulls that are basically saying."
"20193460","20196880"," It's kind of like this kind of like the neckline right here."
"20196940","20197760"," Not neckline. "
"20197760","20199640"," This is an inverse head and shoulders forming up."
"20200880","20201660"," So you're like."
"20202480","20204340"," Bulls are going to say we're going this way. "
"20206380","20207920"," The bears are saying."
"20207920","20209200"," I don't know."
"20209400","20210980"," This is a huge bear flag. "
"20212120","20213500"," It's eventually going to break."
"20213940","20215580"," But the question becomes how deep is a break?"
"20215780","20216860"," Does it break just enough?"
"20218540","20221300"," Just enough on this three 78 to get that rip."
"20222420","20223780"," Or is like full failure. "
"20224140","20225600"," I think that's what Chase was saying was."
"20226240","20227800"," Does it get like real nasty down here?"
"20231380","20235500"," You know, there is enough that nasty is where you see that other."
"20235500","20237240"," The other channel right here, right?"
"20237820","20238480"," You'd see like. "
"20239940","20241160"," This move, right?"
"20241520","20242820"," And we come straight down here."
"20243380","20244840"," It's a pretty big move right there."
"20247260","20247820"," Nice. "
"20248380","20248880"," Three days up."
"20249460","20249900"," Sold it down."
"20250340","20250900"," Three days up. "
"20251320","20253240"," And then the bloodbath just keeps going."
"20254460","20260860"," And the one of the keys about this is if you look on a larger time frame."
"20261980","20263460"," It's kind of showing itself. "
"20265840","20268600"," So let me get rid of that box that they sold off of."
"20269000","20273520"," So a larger time frame trend is pretty fucking ugly right now."
"20274940","20276880"," So like a one hour time frame. "
"20277180","20278080"," This is looking ugly."
"20278220","20279340"," You see that blue line right there?"
"20279540","20280320"," And you see these bars."
"20280800","20283660"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. "
"20284660","20288680"," We talked about wanting to see that one big red bar and we kind of got it, right?"
"20290620","20297440"," And you can see we get these red bars, you know, green, green and we're all red today."
"20297840","20305800"," So when the bears are kind of in charge at the moment, though we know that we bought it here."
"20305940","20306440"," We bought it here. "
"20306560","20307220"," We bought it here."
"20308020","20308180"," So."
"20313940","20317000"," Trend is, trend is to sell this close. "
"20321500","20322600"," Almost tagged down below."
"20322600","20324900"," So even if we come up here, even if we trade up here."
"20326260","20327680"," Let's see if we rip up here. "
"20327820","20330840"," There's going to be a, there's going to be a want to sell this into tomorrow."
"20337440","20338680"," Should be a nice squeeze here."
"20338800","20339300"," Nice squeeze play. "
"20343820","20345620"," I believe the five minutes up here somewhere."
"20349260","20349780"," That's lower."
"20349980","20350820"," It's right on pivot. "
"20355680","20357240"," Be looking for reversal here."
"20357380","20360080"," If you're a bear somewhere right in here."
"20374360","20383220"," Yeah, it's pretty cheap, right?"
"20383620","20386800"," $1.20 for calls on, on $3.85. I saw those too. "
"20386900","20387900"," I'm looking at Fridays right now."
"20390080","20392300"," Nice squeeze higher right now on the spy."
"20400840","20403580"," Over below the pivot, we are in a solar rip. "
"20421280","20423520"," Had some similar happen earlier."
"20424450","20426240"," Had a big giant move right here."
"20426940","20428240"," Giant squeeze up. "
"20459620","20460780"," What's a PFE, though?"
"20462520","20463680"," I just got the bear."
"20463920","20464380"," 10 to the day."
"20464480","20465060"," Someone got a bear. "
"20467360","20468560"," What's a PFE, though?"
"20469800","20470460"," Let me look that up."
"20475580","20476560"," I have no idea."
"20476740","20477900"," I have no idea of PF is. "
"20479780","20481060"," COVID-19 drugs."
"20482120","20484960"," I haven't had COVID yet, not once."
"20486460","20488560"," I haven't had coronavirus at all. "
"20494180","20499860"," No one in my immediate family has had it, but I have had two deaths in the family, two or"
"20499860","20502140"," three deaths in the family from it."
"20508180","20508900"," No, it's not."
"20509120","20511900"," A PFE looks like it's a COVID pill. "
"20518180","20522340"," Oh, is it?"
"20522560","20525860"," I thought PFE says it says the COVID pill by Pfizer."
"20531420","20532200"," It works."
"20536420","20538040"," Oh, Pfizer pill, gotcha. "
"20539480","20545060"," I just typed in a typed in PFE pill and said Pfizer COVID."
"20545320","20545800"," I was like, okay."
"20551560","20552460"," How do I know that?"
"20552780","20555160"," Because I've had antibody tests. "
"20560560","20561780"," Oh, and they created Viagra."
"20567480","20572380"," Oh, you know what I was thinking about doing was taking a, I was thinking about starting, or"
"20572380","20575780"," getting tested for testosterone."
"20575780","20581540"," That's what I was thinking about in the classroom. "
"20598220","20601400"," That's what I was thinking about in the classroom."
"20601400","20603840"," Knock off hydroxychloroquine."
"20609820","20615820"," I was going to get my, I was going to get my labs done to see how my testosterone levels"
"20615820","20616020"," are. "
"20618900","20624520"," Two minutes time now at the top of the aisle, you get South Korea's manufacturing BSI, prior to 70."
"20628340","20629880"," That's a nice little trade right there, right?"
"20631960","20633340"," It's a nice little move right there."
"20634440","20636220"," This is a gorgeous little move right here. "
"20640300","20650460"," Yeah, I was looking at, I was looking at like the, like"
"20650460","20654240"," the actual doctor, like you know, the doctor, they run a bunch of panels on you and make sure"
"20654240","20654980"," everything's good."
"20656320","20657480"," Yeah, I work out all the time."
"20658960","20661980"," I work out good, but I think you have like a, I think as you get older, you have like"
"20661980","20664420"," a plateau and then you start to come down slowly over here. "
"20666800","20668500"," Yeah, I haven't seen anything either, Joey."
"20684180","20686880"," Joey Chaser around the bedroom with the TRT."
"20702820","20707300"," Yeah, I've got friends that, I've got friends that are on it and they love it. "
"20722560","20725060"," Yeah, I had that pump down below here, pump again."
"20725840","20726980"," Remember the green line chase?"
"20739110","20740890"," Ah, Wiki's getting this."
"20741450","20742710"," Wiki, Wiki knows what's up. "
"20743510","20752230"," Okay, so this blue line right here, you want to see, well, the bears want to be selling this right"
"20752230","20752470"," here."
"20755370","20762310"," Boles need to see some product productivity for the next leg higher."
"20763650","20766750"," Back to the yellow line that we've been talking about all day long. "
"20775590","20780030"," All day long, the yellow line, the yellow brick road."
"20789530","20795250"," So don't see a regular, yeah, so I went to my regular doctor and he said everything was fine, like"
"20795250","20802850"," my regular checkup, like I'm clean bill of health and I asked him about it and he was like, I'm"
"20802850","20803610"," not doing that for you."
"20804550","20812230"," So I reached out to a doctor, well, I reached out to a doctor on, well, not a doctor, but"
"20812230","20818050"," a company on the online and they were willing to send me to a specialist here where I live and"
"20818050","20819370"," they take a panel for me there. "
"20824490","20826590"," You guys hear the jackhammer in the background or no?"
"20829950","20832110"," Honestly, there's like a jackhammer going on in the background."

"22466440","22470860"," don't think we're going to 390 or at least the market is saying we're not going to 390 on Friday"
"22476460","22483820"," it's betting against it the other thing the other problem is I mean a call spread would be nice"
"22483820","22490880"," here and I wouldn't do a debit spread I'd do a credit spread because you could probably get the"
"22490880","22494680"," velocity in the time on this trade as you head into Friday but you want to close it probably"
"22494680","22501540"," Thursday or maybe the opening bell of Friday because the moment they start the moment they start"

"22544720","22553140"," on Tesla like truth on Tesla if you like the safety trade on Tesla it's not just the five minute"
"22553140","22561300"," so like on Tesla this is a prime example right here"
"22561300","22568380"," so on Tesla use this is the let's see the five minute in Tesla so the truth is here in"
"22568380","22575080"," Tesla you can see it you're looking for this break above the five minute it got above but then it"

"22642460","22649300"," above this there's no fucking retracement it just isn't and on a four hour chart you know this is"
"22649300","22658340"," bad when you start to see the separation here this is typically pretty bad I'm gonna say that by"
"22658340","22666460"," morning there's a fair chance of us hitting 95 there is a chance or even Friday"
"22666460","22676280"," there's a chance of us hitting down here there really is a real real real true chance guaranteed"
"22676280","22686220"," no but real chance of it yes one last capitulation moment you can see"
