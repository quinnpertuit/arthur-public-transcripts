"77550","78590"," Good morning out there."
"78690","79010"," How you doing?"
"102420","106920"," Good morning."
"118660","119680"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"120300","124880"," I wonder what the show looks like right now. "
"124880","128479"," I gotta check this out and see how it looks."
"148690","155370"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"156110","157170"," Harry and Kent Luke. "
"165280","166040"," All right."
"166080","166460"," Hold on here."
"166580","168540"," Let me get into my main streamer. "
"168660","169460"," Give me a second here."
"172440","180320"," So this morning, how the cookie crumbles."
"181640","182480"," I'll leave it simple. "
"182820","186340"," I'm not gonna say too much here."
"188900","191440"," I'll leave it simple this morning."
"194700","195560"," Hang tight here. "
"200490","202230"," What is going on here?"
"203810","206050"," I got some real wonkiness going on here."
"212570","213110"," Okay."
"213110","214610"," Leave it like that for right now. "
"215390","217870"," Having some technical issues here on the bell."
"218610","222570"," Off the opening bell, we have a huge bull cross this morning."
"229000","232300"," Right off the bell, we had a high of 412, 64. "
"232560","234080"," We're gonna chart this out together here."
"234760","237460"," You know, my take, you take the money and run."
"239440","241060"," You take the money and run. "
"244160","245720"," Take it when you're closing."
"246760","250800"," Take it on the opening bell, renegotiate the trade."
"251200","253860"," If it's going up, rebuy cheaper. "
"254640","261540"," So if you have nine cent puts and they go up 700%, you realize those gains."
"263580","264920"," Same goes with calls."
"265460","266480"," Get back in on calls. "
"266760","269320"," If you think it's going to continue hot, continue higher, they're cheaper."
"271700","277060"," Realized gains renegotiate the trade on zero dates, one dates."
"283680","286360"," I had, I had people. "
"288320","289920"," This is a funny story."
"290280","290900"," Give me a second."
"291020","291840"," I got something I got to do here. "
"294400","296240"," We'll go through a bunch of stuff this morning."
"296640","296940"," So."
"302770","304950"," My wife came to me this morning. "
"305570","307630"," Well, first of all, see that."
"307930","308510"," See my new rig."
"312510","314690"," So my wife came to me this morning, early this morning. "
"314850","315850"," She doesn't know anything, right?"
"315970","317090"," She doesn't know anything about my trade or whatever."
"317630","319850"," But she helps out and stuff like that in the background."
"320570","322050"," And so she came to me this morning. "
"323770","325730"," And she said, hold on here."
"327310","327670"," Yes."
"330090","330450"," Yes. "
"334830","335950"," Really a Tesla today."
"335950","336550"," It's a big one."
"342800","346500"," And she'll go through and so she checks my YouTube comments. "
"349620","353420"," Every day to make sure it's like bots come into the YouTube comments."
"354380","356840"," And then it'll look like it'll have like a hundred likes."
"363800","364940"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"365080","365100"," D."
"365180","365380"," S."
"365420","366260"," has become a member."
"369300","369700"," So."
"371060","372980"," We got a bunch of stuff about today, but. "
"374040","374820"," A whole bunch of stuff."
"376300","377280"," Good morning, everybody."
"377460","378700"," Good to see you all here this morning. "
"380120","382120"," A whole bunch of stuff about this morning."
"382580","385220"," But you know, the first point is this is that."
"388580","390320"," Into the stream closed yesterday. "
"390820","392760"," Well, first of all, earlier in the dead said."
"393300","394380"," But they're cheap, right?"
"395840","396440"," Dirt cheap."
"396780","397960"," No reason not to buy them. "
"398160","399500"," Now me, I didn't get to get any, right?"
"399660","400240"," I didn't buy any."
"400360","402960"," I'm like, I'm hoping for a squeeze up in the bell so I can get some puts in tomorrow."
"404400","408000"," We got the liquidation break into the end of the day, though, right?"
"408160","412780"," The restaurant and Belarus reaffirm their commitment to nuclear non-proliferation treaty in a joint"
"412780","413180"," statement. "
"413820","416460"," We also yesterday took a poll."
"416780","418180"," Everybody said 410 by tomorrow."
"418280","419300"," We ended up getting it yesterday. "
"423540","426160"," So hopefully you're able to buy those puts yesterday."
"427100","428820"," Make some money into yesterday's bell."
"429280","431920"," Now, as the day was wrapping up. "
"432660","434860"," I left you with, have you."
"436000","437640"," Closed for profit here."
"439300","440760"," And I was told no. "
"441880","444060"," There's a few that took the money and ran."
"444240","444980"," I saw a few of you did."
"445120","446380"," A lot of you did not. "
"447500","451680"," And then this morning, my wife was like, oh, I got a bunch of cool comments."
"452460","453980"," Looks like people are making money in your stream."
"455320","456420"," She's like, you want to look at them?"
"456500","456800"," I'm like, sure. "
"457120","459320"," So she had sniffed them and saved them for me."
"462840","467320"," And I said, oh shit, I got all these people that are leaving me comments that they're up to 670 "
"467320","470200","% wherever you are out there if you're watching right now."
"470980","472660"," You deleted your comment this morning. "
"473120","473480"," That's okay."
"473760","474520"," You don't have to delete your comments."
"474520","476900"," I can still see them after you delete them. "
"479260","481400"," So I have a bunch of deleted comments this morning."
"481580","485500"," My wife, of course, has no idea what's going on."
"485620","487760"," And I'm like, well, that they're waking up this morning. "
"488800","492160"," That's 670% is zero right now."
"493800","495560"," And I was fascinated into that belly."
"496020","496620"," Excuse me. "
"496700","497460"," I'm losing my voice here."
"498140","500560"," I was fascinated in that belly yesterday."
"501420","505420"," And specifically asked, are you have you closed for profit or not?"
"510780","513159"," Mostly because we're in the heat of those situations. "
"514280","516320"," You get all bold up or all beared up."
"521049","522710"," And don't realize profit."
"529140","530640"," Sorry, I'm losing my voice today. "
"531520","533960"," At this point in the week, it's been a long, long week."
"536420","538120"," So, you know, you have those comments."
"538660","541540"," And then in the stream yesterday, we get two beared up, right?"
"541700","543020"," So a little bit too much, right?"
"543140","545660"," A little bit too much alpha, counter alpha, that kind of stuff. "
"547520","549200"," And that leads us into our next thing."
"549440","550720"," That is our comments."
"551720","556460"," Our chat section is getting a little too crazy. "
"557280","558060"," It's not a bad thing."
"558180","558620"," It's a good thing."
"558800","559680"," It's part of growth. "
"559680","565540"," And so when we do these live streams from this point forward, we're going to try at least right"
"565540","565800"," now."
"566220","571280"," It's like every OPEX, it seems like every time we come into an OPEX, well, it's a couple of things."
"571940","577660"," First, we've been trading sideways for, what, 30 sessions or something, maybe even more. "
"578820","581640"," So people are, people are expectedly salty."
"582960","585980"," Bulls and bears alike are like, I hate 410."
"586440","587060"," I hate 412. "
"588700","590460"," That comes out in the chat."
"591860","596260"," Another thing that seems to happen is whenever we get around an OPEX, whether it's quarterly or"
"596260","600260"," monthly, people get even more salty as they come into these OPEXes."
"600400","601360"," I don't know why it's OPEX. "
"602840","608280"," So myself, I kind of subscribe it to, I get tired as well, right?"
"609040","611140"," A month goes by and I'm like, I'm tired."
"612220","614560"," You guys see me, I take breaks on quarterly OPEXes, right?"
"614680","615740"," I'm like, I'm out of here for a week."
"618220","621780"," And I take those breaks because I'm worn out as well, right?"
"622160","624920"," And the comment sections can seem like that as well. "
"626640","629520"," Where our comment chat sometimes can seem like that as well."
"630640","631960"," So we can't have counter-alpha."
"632300","633440"," We can't have not taking profit. "
"634740","638480"," We know that if you're taking a directional trade that you take the money and you run and"
"638480","639520"," reposition yourself."
"641960","644980"," And we can't be losing money around here with our asses, right?"
"644980","645600"," We know that."
"647060","648160"," I hang tighter for a second. "
"648300","656540"," And then as we grow, I don't want to come into these OPEXes and myself be like, eh, I'm just"
"656540","657500"," not going to stream for a week."
"658500","660420"," You know, take a break or whatever, do whatever I want to do."
"660720","664500"," So what we're going to do is we're going to try something and see if this works. "
"664680","666280"," If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of it."
"667680","671000"," What we're going to try here is hang tighter."
"671000","675400"," I haven't had levels yet here yet, so we'll do levels here in just a moment. "
"680690","685210"," We're going to try here, especially around emotional time periods, OPEX."
"685850","692470"," People expecting a crash is we're just going to limit who, if you want to talk in the stream,"
"693430","697610"," you're going to have to become a member or a subscriber."
"698390","703230"," If you're listening in right now wondering why you cannot comment, I think I'm, I haven't, I"
"703230","707530"," haven't, I'm not sure if this is the case, but I think you can go to Twitch and we can"
"707530","709390"," sign up through Amazon Prime. "
"709670","710070"," It's free."
"713210","720670"," And Bezos will give me $2.50 and he keeps $2.50. So then you can subscribe and comment to"
"720670","722490"," your, to your heart's content on Twitch."
"723110","724270"," You too, they don't have that option. "
"725530","727930"," So it's five bucks, it's five bucks on Twitch."
"727930","734470"," If you just, if you sign up or you can go through, I believe Amazon on Amazon Prime Gaming, that's"
"734470","736850"," free, or it's five bucks on Twitch or five bucks on YouTube."
"739250","745510"," We're going to try this model out and see if this helps with the counter alpha. "
"754420","756080"," So there's a, I think there's a free option."
"756400","759840"," If I'm wrong, if you can chime in there at some point, let me know if I'm wrong on this."
"759840","767440"," I think you can do this for free through Amazon Prime Gaming on Twitch. "
"767680","769580"," There is no option on YouTube."
"774480","777120"," I'm not getting notifications right now, but I don't know why."
"777920","779360"," I'm getting some, but not all of them. "
"786320","787460"," Yeah, so there is, right?"
"787580","790200"," There's a free Prime Gaming sub and you'll be able to comment on YouTube."
"790200","790960"," I don't have that choice."
"790960","797100"," So as we get passerby's that show up in the stream, people, I don't know that kind of stuff. "
"797260","799360"," I'm like, Oh, we're not dealing with these people in the stream anymore."
"802710","803390"," Hey, George."
"803630","804130"," Thank you, brother. "
"809860","810220"," Okay."
"810520","812820"," So we're going to do the, we're going to do levels really quick."
"812820","815200"," We're going to talk about today and look where we are today, right?"
"815620","816580"," Let's be honest, right?"
"816900","818580"," Hopefully I'm going to be honest with you. "
"818780","822240"," I hope that yesterday into that bell, right?"
"822580","823920"," That you were listening to me."
"823920","827500"," When I said to you, close those fucking puts for profit."
"828420","834420"," And I said, I'm taking along here into this bell so that I was the voice of reason for you. "
"834500","838520"," If you're one of those people that realized those games yesterday in that bell, congratulations."
"839360","842820"," You deserve every single dollar that you have this morning."
"844960","849080"," Congratulations to you for being the calm, emotionless trader. "
"850860","861020"," If you"
"861020","863640"," did not, you drank the Kool-Aid into the bell."
"865000","869040"," Please use that as a learning experience to beg you."
"878100","883600"," Pivot point for this morning is 411, 95. "
"893060","899180"," If you held calls overnight and you took profit, congratulations to the profit on the bell this"
"899180","899440"," morning."
"900840","923100"," We tapped"
"923100","924620"," the daily trigger in yesterday's close."
"924960","925360"," You remember that?"
"929960","937120"," S1 down here at 409.39. S2. "
"938700","948580"," 408.53. S3.406 "
"948580","950540",".81, baby."
"952680","957920"," And also, after I got the stream yesterday, I went to go get my computer stuff all done."
"957920","959780"," Went back to the computer store. "
"959900","961680"," I had the guys working on a bunch of stuff for me."
"964360","966760"," And I was in the store yesterday."
"968960","975880"," And John Haggerty, my man John Haggerty, called me up and he's like, guess who's streaming right"
"975880","976160"," now?"
"977740","978640"," And I'm like, who?"
"980300","983760"," And he says, Brian Watt is the goat. "
"985340","989140"," And I said, I said, no way."
"989900","991720"," He said, yeah, man, he's streaming right now."
"992260","993080"," He should jump on. "
"995260","997360"," So, of course, I got my phone with me."
"997420","999080"," I got no charger with me on that stuff."
"999080","1001680"," And I just jump on the stream just to hear his voice yesterday. "
"1004060","1012460"," And, you know, like for me, 411, 68, I don't know what your experience has been if you've had the"
"1012460","1013660"," opportunity to know that guy."
"1013660","1015500"," In any way, shape, or form."
"1017180","1023700"," I was never, I was never, I was always too scared to comment in his streams. "
"1024280","1031480"," From the moment I met him, from the moment I watched his streams, I was enamored by him, right?"
"1032800","1034540"," I think the dad you never had."
"1037940","1039960"," Coming into the hourly trigger right now."
"1039960","1042619"," And I heard his voice last night. "
"1042720","1045700"," It made me want to cry, listen to him."
"1048800","1049160"," 41009."
"1051780","1052520"," Like he's alive. "
"1052900","1053300"," He's safe."
"1054860","1056280"," The rumors are not true."
"1056760","1060540"," I don't, there are no rumors, but, you know, people, people are concerned about him, right?"
"1060700","1061280"," Make sure he's okay. "
"1062280","1065420"," And I got to tell you, man, I don't have many traders."
"1068520","1073220"," Like I'll read like a train or a post something or, I don't know, they'll have a subsurvers or"
"1073220","1073960"," something or whatever."
"1074840","1077080"," But there aren't that many traders that I've known. "
"1077800","1079540"," I don't know, like we're not friends or anything."
"1080540","1084460"," I never once commented in his streams over the years either."
"1084680","1085680"," That's another fascinating point. "
"1085840","1086600"," I was always too scared."
"1087740","1088820"," I was enamored by him."
"1090020","1091180"," You know, thanks Brian Watt. "
"1091360","1093240"," Whenever he speaks, you shut up and you listen to the guy."
"1094540","1097240"," Whether he makes the right call or wrong call, it didn't matter."
"1099560","1101420"," He had something to teach you. "
"1101840","1105900"," Something to, lessons for you to learn as the day traded."
"1107020","1108840"," We'll talk about some of that stuff, I guess, at some point."
"1108980","1116080"," But I was able to listen to him last night and I brought back all these emotions and memories of"
"1116080","1118980"," trading days with him in the background talking all day long. "
"1119720","1121500"," And telling stories that he's gotten that kind of stuff."
"1124000","1127680"," And I think inside of his stream yesterday, he said he might stop by."
"1128560","1132120"," I don't know if he might stop by our stream and stop in the chat. "
"1133520","1135460"," I'll be honest, I'm going to be on record with this."
"1135600","1138020"," You guys have heard me defend him."
"1138180","1142340"," You've heard me defend him when the market's been an asshole to him. "
"1142540","1145040"," When the social media has been an asshole to him."
"1145280","1147660"," I've always stood up for him publicly."
"1148820","1149920"," I respect the man. "
"1149920","1153300"," And I look up to him as a trader."
"1154240","1158280"," He's on a short list of people that I've known that are great traders."
"1158720","1160240"," And they trade live with you. "
"1160780","1162700"," They try to trade when they win, they trade when they lose."
"1163980","1166500"," And they say what it's like to be an actual trader."
"1166740","1168120"," That is so rare to come by. "
"1169260","1172640"," You'll get an alpha out there that'll pop on with you only on trend days."
"1173860","1175220"," So it always looks good, right?"
"1175420","1177460"," I know today's a trend day and it's going to be great trading day."
"1177500","1178280"," I'm going to look great on stream. "
"1179260","1180800"," Brian was there every single day, right?"
"1180980","1181320"," Didn't matter."
"1184200","1185880"," And he said he might stop in here."
"1186000","1191020"," Now we've got the members only chat on YouTube and the members only on the subscriber chat only on"
"1191020","1191300"," Twitch. "
"1192080","1195300"," In the middle of the night last night, I made him a moderator on this show."
"1196720","1202100"," So if he ever comes on this show in the chat, let him know that if he's, if it says"
"1202100","1203540"," he can't chat or something, he can."
"1203980","1205680"," He's a moderator here at this point. "
"1205680","1210420"," Now he might not want to be a moderator, but that gives him free access to the chat to stop"
"1210420","1211120"," in and say hello."
"1212180","1214700"," If he ever says anything like that, he's on board."
"1214940","1217460"," He can get in here and chat and I'm going to extend an invitation. "
"1218480","1223500"," If I could ever have a moment to sit with him sometime, I would sit there and I got a"
"1223500","1230560"," list of questions for him to put him down on a video to just get his history."
"1230960","1232160"," His history is amazing."
"1232160","1235420"," And he, he deletes a lot of his videos. "
"1235740","1239400"," So a lot of that stuff is like, you know, like it's like lost to the past and you want"
"1239400","1245680"," to get this guy's story on a, on a video if possible, maybe on a Saturday or something or a"
"1245680","1245980"," Sunday."
"1246120","1250420"," He can sit and have a bourbon together and just let him talk."
"1252660","1255120"," We don't tell his story because the story is unreal. "
"1261140","1265760"," So that was great to hear him last night pivot point right here."
"1265760","1269800"," Harley trigger, 41269 daily trigger, 41011."
"1269980","1272620"," We see where S1 and S2 and S3 are. "
"1274460","1280820"," We've got some pre-market stuff bar, some pivot points down below, 409.98 is the low."
"1281680","1286260"," This pre-market low right here is also the previous low from yesterday."
"1286980","1287900"," Early in the morning. "
"1290340","1292100"," We got a bunch of stuff to close."
"1292640","1294560"," Get a bunch of stuff to close back here."
"1294680","1300170"," Let me, let me mute this book map here for a minute. "
"1302450","1304030"," There's another target down here."
"1306550","1306950"," 40907."
"1312720","1314140"," So you got this pivot point here. "
"1315940","1318080"," We got this pivot point right here."
"1318120","1318960"," We got another one, I guess."
"1319120","1319940"," I guess we can look at that one. "
"1321620","1328280"," A whole bunch of stuff down here in this daily trigger."
"1329900","1331920"," We got this one back over here."
"1333060","1336880"," A whole bunch of, a whole bunch of points of interest down there. "
"1344140","1348200"," We still have a gap to fill above that's been left behind, that was left behind yesterday."
"1350140","1351800"," We got this mass back here."
"1356220","1359900"," I think we, no, we never closed these three gaps above to the left up here. "
"1362020","1370520"," Our one this morning is 411.96. We got a bunch of gap, crappy gaps up here."
"1382960","1384160"," We got that wrong there."
"1385540","1388340"," 411.95, hold on, 411.10. I got that wrong. "
"1389860","1396680"," Moabed, 411.10. Lay down here, that's the pivot."
"1398700","1402180"," 411.96 is actually our one right there."
"1408730","1411010"," Range expectations to the upside are limited. "
"1412350","1422000"," 413.68. Range is coming down from the upside, just the heads up on that."
"1426040","1431560"," 414.54. Call wall coming down, baby."
"1448260","1449480"," We can get over here. "
"1450720","1455360"," We got a new setup this morning, so I'm not feeling the ergonomics of it yet."
"1457360","1459100"," So bear with me here."
"1471320","1473320"," Okay, so let's take a look at this chart here. "
"1473460","1475820"," Okay, this is a 15 minute chart right here."
"1477020","1479000"," Range bounds still, right?"
"1480180","1482420"," By in the dips, selling the rips."
"1483400","1488700"," We talked about how the sellers were stepping in lower highs, right?"
"1489060","1493140"," Lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, lower highs, lower highs. "
"1493260","1495320"," They didn't fail again yesterday."
"1496000","1500640"," Trying again right now to jump right back into that sell side, right?"
"1501120","1503720"," We still know that demand is down below."
"1506080","1507700"," Still coming in, right?"
"1508160","1513100"," Coiling, coiling for an explosive move, still no explosive move. "
"1516300","1519800"," Saw the demand step in down here as well this morning."
"1523260","1530020"," Still range bound to no one's delight at this point, right?"
"1532000","1541520"," We also know that the daily"
"1541520","1547500"," velocity on the market is slowing, right?"
"1547980","1549860"," We were at a peak bullish velocity."
"1550680","1551780"," We're now neutral. "
"1552580","1554840"," We think we're going to turn bearish at some point."
"1556240","1559880"," We know we're anticipating that there will be a role in the market, right?"
"1560160","1562920"," We know that we've been expecting it now for our sessions, right?"
"1563000","1564300"," We've been talking about this for two weeks, right?"
"1564540","1565480"," When do we get the endclench?"
"1567320","1569040"," We're like, is it going to happen on Tuesday?"
"1569680","1570520"," Is it going to happen on Monday?"
"1571220","1572320"," Now it's Wednesday."
"1574280","1575680"," When does the endclench happen?"
"1575920","1576260"," Is it today?"
"1576480","1576880"," Is it tomorrow?"
"1578120","1579660"," Well, we're probably not tomorrow, right?"
"1579820","1580300"," We've got OpEx. "
"1581740","1582520"," Is it Friday?"
"1582800","1583880"," Is it June 2nd?"
"1583880","1587360"," And then we have, what are the expectations of that unclench?"
"1588020","1589460"," And those run the gamut, right?"
"1589880","1590560"," 3,600."
"1591120","1593980"," We've got 37, 378, 0."
"1595040","1595460"," Highly probable."
"1596840","1599620"," We know that 396 is a huge area of interest. "
"1612900","1614840"," Vic's still resisting off the daily."
"1616880","1620580"," And all along knowing all of this, spy continues."
"1623360","1624860"," It's run up, right?"
"1625660","1628300"," Still to this moment, crazily enough. "
"1628620","1629720"," I'll show it to you right now."
"1633510","1635870"," You know, that staircase up we talk about."
"1638570","1642850"," Even with velocity dropping, like velocity is just dropping off here, right?"
"1643270","1643850"," See it down here?"
"1645950","1649370"," But this yellow trigger is continuing higher, right?"
"1649990","1651090"," Look at it again this morning. "
"1651090","1652110"," The trigger is higher."
"1652590","1653970"," It's up another 50 cents."
"1654150","1657390"," They're trying to go up another 50 cents to the upside. "
"1658430","1659990"," Bears need this to break."
"1660210","1664190"," They have to get underneath the trigger and reject."
"1664450","1665590"," We know this trade, right?"
"1666490","1670290"," You take each trade to the level, you take profit. "
"1671530","1674070"," This was a pin strike down here yesterday."
"1676950","1680010"," You renegotiate the trade below the trigger once."
"1681090","1683450"," It's confirmed that we're making the next leg lower. "
"1684430","1687070"," Until then, you're getting torched."
"1689090","1690790"," Now I know everyone likes to come back."
"1690930","1691650"," We talk about that, right?"
"1691770","1693310"," Everybody comes back and says things like. "
"1695850","1698750"," Everybody comes back and they say things like, oh, I closed cap."
"1700690","1702150"," It's a half back trade cap."
"1702390","1703070"," And I'm like, yeah, whatever. "
"1703430","1708250"," I'm like, but on this program at all times, we say, take profit on the trade down."
"1708830","1710430"," Take profit on the trade up."
"1712070","1715250"," You renegotiate this next leg once the confirmation. "
"1717130","1720070"," To the downside to 403 or 404 happens."
"1720710","1721630"," Does that make sense?"
"1721890","1723270"," This is a new trade right here."
"1729530","1730770"," You're not Mike Barry. "
"1731650","1735570"," Your bank is not allowing you to carry for the next three months until you're right."
"1736130","1736630"," I know that."
"1737050","1737590"," I've been there. "
"1737710","1738050"," I've done it."
"1738470","1739470"," I've had the phone call."
"1739670","1740170"," I've had the email. "
"1747550","1749430"," So that's the spy right now, right?"
"1749830","1753810"," Spy at the bottom of its hourly bearish bearishness right now coming into it, at least."
"1758020","1762740"," You can see we're not quite at bottom right now, but we're getting there."
"1762840","1763120"," You know what I mean?"
"1763200","1763520"," We're close. "
"1771980","1773200"," Vic's doing its thing."
"1773880","1774360"," Still."
"1775560","1777120"," Trying to break above. "
"1778420","1779680"," The big number here."
"1779840","1781520"," Matter of fact, I want to show you this, right?"
"1781900","1783140"," There's another key point here."
"1784680","1786840"," Pretend this Vic's chart was upside down. "
"1789720","1791740"," You know, we blast above, right?"
"1792660","1796680"," We come to check the trigger on VIX."
"1798260","1800780"," And we're told no, right?"
"1801000","1801440"," Right here, right?"
"1801600","1802080"," That's the rejection."
"1802740","1805240"," What you're looking for in the VIX is for VIX to break above. "
"1806880","1807920"," Hold 1780."
"1808920","1809940"," And show you the way higher."
"1810400","1811900"," That's where the money shot is right there. "
"1811900","1818280"," That's when you pull the trigger either on VIX or expressed through an S&P 500 product or, you"
"1818280","1818940"," know, whatever you're trading."
"1819480","1820140"," Shorten in video."
"1820200","1821900"," I don't care what you're doing with Apple, whatever. "
"1822780","1825100"," We already know that didn't work on Apple right yesterday."
"1825840","1829200"," People are saying that's the 2000.com crash."
"1835140","1839020"," Apple will be up 5% for three days and then we'll roll the market over. "
"1839280","1839700"," That kind of stuff."
"1848380","1849560"," So, hold on."
"1849680","1857580"," John Hagerty is saying to me on a text message right now that DJ2112 is chatting with Brian right"
"1857580","1857860"," now. "
"1858200","1861840"," Brian says he does plan on coming over to the YouTube stream sometime this morning."
"1862640","1864200"," So can someone just relate to him?"
"1864480","1868200"," Just let him know that I made him a moderator so he can talk in the chat."
"1869280","1874540"," And if at any points he would like to come on the stream either on audio or video. "
"1875920","1883860"," If he just shoots me an email to CaptainJimJames.com, I will send him a link to get him on"
"1883860","1885760"," stream, video, audio, whatever he wants."
"1886000","1886520"," It's a simple link."
"1886620","1888160"," He just clicks on it and he can start talking. "
"1891080","1896200"," And if not today, if he just stops into the chat, maybe we can beg and plead and see if"
"1896200","1897260"," we can get him on at some point."
"1914100","1916360"," Pre-market, first pre-market lows right here."
"1916840","1924010"," 410.69. Get rid of that one. "
"1936430","1937110"," There we go."
"1937390","1937650"," Right there."
"1937770","1938810"," Clean that bad boy up. "

"1954860","1957100"," Let me see if I can find him right now."
"1957320","1958420"," Where's DJ in the?"
"1960780","1961900"," Can you give me DJs?"
"1962380","1963760"," I'm going to moderate DJ2. "
"1964160","1969460"," But I need to know his exact, I'm going to make DJ22112 a moderator in YouTube."
"1969580","1973460"," But let me see if I can figure this out in the background."
"1978130","1978870"," Let me have a second. "
"1978970","1979490"," I'm going to try it out."
"1979810","1983270"," So I need DJ2112's full name."
"1987580","1987940"," Settings. "
"1993120","1994980"," I don't know if I'm going to do this right here."
"1996000","1996980"," That was in the community."
"2000320","2001140"," Studio maybe. "
"2005200","2005660"," Settings."
"2010160","2010620"," Community."
"2011460","2013480"," Then get put him in there somewhere. "
"2027720","2029640"," Yeah, there's more than one DJ22112."
"2030860","2032460"," I don't want to make the wrong person or moderator."
"2032740","2033850"," Can someone get me his exact name?"
"2038220","2042360"," So the SEC weighs a new intraday margin cool powers for clearing houses. "
"2043280","2044420"," I need his exact name."

"5359500","5363260"," It's like in my my thought process tell me tell me where I'm wrong here. "
"5366540","5372060"," We start we we front ran the raising of rates right there so we the fed used to surprise us"
"5372060","5375600"," to remember the fed would like come into a Senate hearing and be like oh by the way we're going"
"5375600","5376920"," up 50 bps today."
"5377900","5382340"," Like surprise there's always a surprise at a fed meeting a Senate hearing and then they were like"

"5421820","5423620"," And then we're in the trough phase."
"5424300","5428440"," Do you feel like we've seen the bottom of the trough or do you think that we trade sideways and"
"5428440","5434920"," up until unemployment rate finally comes ripping up and they get the rate the rates above the rate"
"5434920","5435300"," of inflation. "

"5442180","5446740"," And then the other the other fly in the layman's here is I feel like I was like oh we're"
"5446740","5449760"," on the well that feeling I think they're like we're in we're on this track and then."
"5450880","5456860"," Unknown to us we're not unknown we have this like bullshit regional banking crisis. "

"6466030","6467530"," Yeah, I think we're pinned here."
"6468030","6470450"," I'm with onion hands on this. "
"6470770","6473550"," I'm about to take off in a few minutes here to the helicopter."
"6473810","6475290"," Here we go."
"6475390","6476590"," I'm a helicopter, but. "
"6477250","6477770"," Oh, Jesus."
"6478910","6481410"," Anyway, I'm going to leave for me as a G7."
"6482350","6486190"," America's role in the world is vital, especially right now, is working at other countries to"
"6486190","6487710"," support the crane and take on the challenges to manage. "
"6490210","6491010"," International cooperation."
"6491750","6496170"," And from tackling the climate crisis to strengthening the global economy."
"6497230","6499690"," And before I leave, I was going to hear him right now, right?"
"6499930","6502390"," Status and negotiations with the congressional leaders. "
"6503910","6509930"," We had a productive meeting yesterday, and with all four leaders in the Congress, it was civil and"
"6509930","6510290"," respectful."
"6511110","6513450"," And everyone came to the meeting, I think, in good faith."
"6514410","6519170"," I'm confident that we'll get the agreement on the budget that America will not default. "
"6519830","6524550"," And every leader in the room understands the consequences that we've failed at pay our bills."
"6525410","6530890"," And it would be catastrophic for the American economy and the American people if we didn't pay our"
"6530890","6531090"," bills."
"6532270","6537130"," And I'm confident everyone in the room agreed with the speaker from the speaker to the majority"
"6537130","6543590"," leader to the majority of the House and the Senate, excuse me, the majority of the Senate, the"
"6543590","6547590"," minority of the Senate, as well as the leader, the Democratic leader in the House. "
"6547590","6552790"," And we're going to come together because there's no alternative to do the right thing for the"
"6552790","6553050"," country."
"6553370","6554750"," We have to move on."
"6555410","6561190"," And to be clear, this negotiation is about the outlines of what the budget will look like. "
"6561450","6564330"," Not about whether or not we're going to, in fact, pay our debts."
"6565230","6567770"," The leaders will all agree we will not default."
"6568510","6569670"," Every leader has said that. "
"6570470","6571510"," And I'm proud of the progress."
"6572130","6574150"," Ooh, that was good right there."
"6574150","6578250"," Two years by $1.7 trillion in the first two years. "
"6578870","6582990"," And I proposed a budget that would reduce another $3 trillion over the next decade."
"6583830","6588390"," That includes more revenue by asking the wealthy and large corporations to begin their pay their"
"6588390","6588910"," fair share."
"6590210","6595470"," And cutting subsidies that exist in the law now to big oil and big farming. "
"6596510","6602430"," Yesterday, we all agreed that both the speaker McCarthy and I would designate senior members that"
"6602430","6607890"," we would negotiate to give our authority to make agreements in detail of what we want."
"6608050","6608970"," So we narrowed the group."
"6609730","6610350"," We narrowed the group. "
"6610770","6612750"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"6613290","6616290"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flame futures."

"6620970","6622830"," With my team while I'm at the G7."
"6623510","6626730"," And to be close touch with the speaker McCarthy and other leaders as well."
"6627590","6633010"," Now what I have done in anticipation that we won't get it all done until I get back. "
"6633130","6640830"," Is I cut my trip short in order to be for the final negotiations and sign the deal with the"
"6640830","6641770"," majority leader."
"6642450","6646950"," I made clear that, and I'll say it again, America is not a deadbeat nation."
"6647870","6648970"," We pay our bills. "
"6649490","6652310"," The nation is never to fall on his debt and it never will."
"6652870","6657110"," And we're going to continue these discussions with congressional leaders in the coming days until"
"6657110","6657990"," we reach an agreement."
"6658770","6660490"," And I have more to say about that on Sunday. "
"6661330","6663590"," And I want to have a press conference on this issue."
"6664090","6666630"," As it stands now, the intention is to."
"6667030","6668610"," All leaders have agreed. "
"6669190","6671910"," Back here on Sunday, a little press conference."
"6671910","6681270"," And in the meantime, I've spoken to the Australian leader Albanese."
"6681650","6685310"," And I've spoken to, I'm going to be seeing him at the G7. "
"6685530","6686490"," He'll be there as well."
"6686490","6692830"," Along with the in spy trading to trade to its previous pre market high."
"6694370","6696370"," Four twelve sixty five. "
"6696370","6698430"," There's a small gap above it for twelve."
"6698510","6703910"," Anyone know that dealers will sometimes reverse even if they're going higher to burn your calls."
"6704730","6714390"," Now trading for twelve eighty one on this by four twelve eighty two taking out the gap above. "
"6715030","6720930"," I'm not going to accept any work requirements that's going to impact on medical health needs."
"6721070","6723370"," I'm not going to accept them."
"6723410","6724910"," Short it to the depths of hell. "
"6728630","6735890"," Vicks trading like a redheaded step child down to 1709."
"6735890","6737610"," That's just the same."
"6738050","6741210"," That we're engaging in Australia. "
"6741690","6746630"," I know that it was important to you to focus on agents, but this is having to be put aside."
"6747290","6749530"," Take the money and run."
"6750130","6753750"," No, because we're still maybe we still have four good allies. "
"6754170","6762750"," Now he just exited away."
"6762890","6763770"," Maybe come back."
"6763770","6764250"," Hold on. "
"6768190","6770570"," He mumbled something and then left."
"6770910","6772490"," He's famous for doing that, right?"
"6772690","6773530"," Just bouncing out."
"6774330","6777570"," Hopefully you took the money and ran on that on those calls at that moment. "
"6778710","6780290"," Retracing the entire move."
"6783590","6785370"," We'll watch it on the one minute here."
"6787710","6791110"," Went up and slapped it and closed that gap on high. "
"6791110","6792590"," Come back down now."
"6792650","6798310"," If you took both sides of that trade, you can close out the put side of that strangle or straddle."
"6801570","6802610"," You should have bird. "
"6807270","6809170"," So he said the key word there."
"6809470","6809710"," Words."
"6810130","6810810"," I mean, we don't know. "
"6810910","6813030"," We know that shit's not what's true, right?"
"6813250","6816850"," They're going to pass it that sailing or kick it can down the road or something."
"6819730","6822530"," We know that that talk of."
"6823450","6825610"," Not raising the debt ceiling is like. "
"6826190","6828250"," Mad Max beyond the Thunderdome."
"6828410","6828950"," We'll be."
"6829190","6831890"," We'll be trading top burning tires in New York City. "
"6832450","6833810"," We'll make a market, damn it."
"6834830","6839870"," But you know, those words that he just said is the words he said they were key there."
"6840930","6845470"," Was all of the officials that have a vote have all agreed. "
"6846450","6848430"," Now that they will raise the debt ceiling."
"6848910","6851610"," Now whether that's true or not, we know this is political talk."
"6853370","6855410"," Market squeezed higher on that news. "
"6857010","6859570"," We're bright back to balance again, baby."
"6863010","6864550"," That was fast, right?"
"6865110","6866330"," There's your move for today."
"6866830","6867570"," Hopefully you took. "
"6867890","6872830"," So when we said we're buying calls in the clothes yesterday, hopefully you took profit on the bell,"
"6873050","6873130"," right?"
"6873250","6874150"," It's a directional move."
"6876630","6878950"," You're able to buy this dip and ride it up."
"6879730","6881230"," The two moves for today. "
"6881810","6882570"," It's done."
"6885750","6886570"," Wrap it up."
"6886990","6887270"," Let's go. "
"6887430","6887750"," Let's go."
"6888250","6888850"," Drink some bears."
"6889550","6891150"," Let's go to the beach and chase fine women. "
"6893590","6905310"," Yeah, then"
"6905310","6906330"," it'll be on again, right?"
"6906330","6913630"," That was your event vault for today."
"6913990","6914550"," Yahoo."
"6921910","6924030"," We got McCarthy coming up next. "
"6925190","6925970"," Oh, no."
"6928530","6930550"," We got it on here in the background."
"6930790","6934090"," If he starts making comments, I'll start reading them off to you guys. "
"6934610","6939530"," We've got the new squawk that'll quote McCarthy here in just a moment."
"6943960","6945840"," You got Fed Speakers all week."
"6945980","6949660"," The big one is Bernanke and Powell on Friday. "
"6963710","6966910"," Look at that beautiful up and down trade right there."
"6990720","6992140"," Yeah, nothing's really changed."
"6992440","6992900"," How's it dating?"
"7009970","7012590"," Daily triggers currently at 410-06. "
"7015550","7021470"," Our early triggers at 411-62, so it's a little bit lower down here somewhere."
"7071270","7073010"," I mean, I kid you not."
"7073250","7075310"," I said I kid you guys not out there, right?"
"7075490","7079770"," Whenever you come into, like, Vickspiration, OpEx, there's some good trading days, right?"
"7080410","7084830"," Usually, if you get down into Thursday, you can usually get a nice little face ripper up into that"
"7084830","7085090"," Friday. "
"7086030","7087870"," For OpEx, you can usually get a nice down day, right?"
"7087990","7088510"," Some nice trading."
"7089410","7091310"," Even into, like, the first of the month into June."
"7092090","7092970"," Haven't been seeing that, right?"
"7093190","7094910"," Having a big pin in the market right now. "
"7096630","7099290"," I always like, like, just normal days."
"7099910","7101910"," I always like day trading normal days, right?"
"7102070","7107350"," Not like some vol in the market or something, but I remember where I used to come into a, like,"
"7107490","7108650"," a Fed event, right?"
"7109670","7112610"," I'd open an options chain and I'd be like, I'd be like, shit."
"7113730","7116550"," I'd be like, the options chain is lopsided on puts. "
"7118950","7121210"," Like, puts were just ridiculously expensive."
"7123310","7125070"," Like, call side would be, like, a penny."
"7125370","7128330"," I'd be like, there's no fucking way we're going down today. "
"7128670","7133550"," Just based on that, I just load up on a bunch of calls, like, dirt cheap."
"7134850","7137630"," And sure enough, no matter what the news was, we'd rip faces off."
"7138490","7140850"," We were talking about this on Twitter, this is a couple of years ago. "
"7141870","7143490"," We're all like talking about a group of us."
"7143610","7145410"," We're all like, look, you got to see this shit."
"7146790","7149590"," And then, like, everyone's kind of figured it out. "
"7150550","7154490"," But before, and you come into another, you come into another Fed event or news, right?"
"7154650","7156230"," And it'd just be lopsided one side."
"7157230","7159590"," Everybody be loaded to the tits and call side."
"7160050","7163330"," Like, there's no fucking way these dealers are paying these fucking things. "
"7164610","7169990"," And, like, kind of this event and, like, from 9.30 till the event time, you know, like, traders"
"7169990","7173330"," being like, yeah, I'm going to buy 30 delta calls for $3."
"7174150","7175210"," It's definitely going up."
"7176410","7179110"," Like a 30 delta put would be, like, two cents. "
"7182810","7186430"," And then this past year, I think too many people figured it out."
"7187610","7189710"," Like the rise of the zero day trader."
"7191130","7195390"," And so then I start coming into these things that I'm like, mmm. "
"7197270","7201950"," I'm like, man, now, like a 30 delta put is five bucks and a 30 delta calls five bucks."
"7202450","7203510"," I'm going to rob everybody."
"7205210","7206950"," I'm going to take everybody's money today. "
"7209210","7211310"," Too many people, the gig is up."
"7213150","7220850"," So to that point, I always like just regular days with regular fall, regular economic news."
"7232640","7233820"," Now you're welcome, Beba. "
"7244990","7247250"," There's a liquidity break right now in the marketplace."
"7248910","7250250"," The market's real quiet here."
"7258740","7260260"," Yeah, did you see that gap, bro?"
"7260720","7261280"," Team Steve. "
"7261520","7263060"," Oh, there was like three little gaps up there."
"7263080","7263940"," They closed them, brother."
"7266120","7272320"," Next gap or next target below would be the previous low down here. "
"7272720","7278980"," This one's not as significant as 409.98. This one down here, we tagged."
"7279300","7280960"," This is the miss, we can show you guys this."
"7282500","7284240"," We tagged this one here from yesterday. "
"7284280","7286140"," We haven't tagged this one yet."
"7287960","7292080"," This 409.98. This is kind after the bell, but kind of not."
"7292260","7293920"," This was going on right in the last moment. "
"7294100","7295200"," So the bell closed yesterday."
"7300110","7302850"," See we tagged above tagged all this stuff up here."
"7304010","7306350"," Next one above that is three days ago. "
"7306550","7308010"," Let me see if I can reset this chart here."
"7308210","7309770"," We get rid of this book map here for a minute."
"7312070","7317710"," So if you're just joining us in the coffee says I'm optimistic about our ability to work together. "
"7319010","7323450"," Oh, McCarthy is optimistic about the ability to work together."
"7323570","7325470"," It looks like the meeting of the mines and the banks."
"7328590","7331450"," We're waiting for this speech before they went public. "
"7334750","7337190"," That's speakers, but this market right here."
"7337250","7339570"," We've been so this market's been going on with 30 sessions, right?"
"7340330","7344910"," We're literally like not every day that a lot of times like nine out of ten times."
"7345930","7349030"," It's we're straight up just trading pivots. "
"7349030","7354970"," Not just like levels, but like finding every finding every pivot on the high and on the low."
"7355150","7357910"," We're just like ping pong and back and forth from these pivots."
"7358610","7360130"," It's been very easy trading. "
"7363530","7365950"," Sell the rips by the dips until it doesn't work anymore."
"7366450","7368410"," You know that one time that it doesn't work for you."
"7369110","7369790"," That's okay. "
"7369850","7371710"," If it's been working for like 20 30 sessions."
"7372510","7378030"," You're doing better than you know full tilt full tilt bear."
"7409180","7413920"," Biden also in so the text came out for what Biden had said in that meeting. "
"7414900","7420520"," When he walked out the door, they were able to hear what he said that reporters were asking him."
"7421500","7428480"," A question about Z and China and Taiwan relations and he said I will be meeting with Z at some"
"7428480","7430080"," point, but not necessarily soon."
"7431780","7434140"," There is a possibility of some work requirements. "
"7434140","7437600"," We will not accept work requirements that will affect the medical needs of people that some"
"7437600","7437920"," different."
"7438840","7439540"," Let me see."
"7439700","7441300"," I got a bunch of stuff here from Biden. "
"7443060","7445920"," I think that was all related to debt talks."
"7446480","7451740"," So the one though one statement is walking out the door was meeting with Z at some point, but not"
"7451740","7453060"," necessarily soon."
"7463820","7467980"," How many of you thought we'd trade four one two eight four and spy today?"
"7467980","7469240"," Raise your hand. "
"7474180","7475060"," Not many right?"
"7486540","7488940"," Well shoot yesterday I was trying to buy puts."
"7489200","7491520"," Do you remember I was like I'm trying to buy puts up here."
"7492300","7493940"," I didn't get my price that I wanted. "
"7495400","7498440"," I was trying to buy puts into the clothes yesterday and I missed the trade."
"7498860","7499400"," I was so pissed."
"7500820","7501960"," I was angry. "

"7588990","7591350"," I believe the economy is much weaker than the Fed thinks. "
"7591870","7596590"," But more importantly going from zero to five percent in a year destabilized bank balance sheets."
"7598090","7598650"," Absolutely."
"7599310","7600230"," They ramped that man. "
"7600990","7603150"," This dream is sponsored by to the tech."

"7652420","7657440"," That's what I remember from it and then like the COVID thing I was like man I was like."
"7658140","7660920"," Have you ever have ever printed money quite like that."
"7660920","7668220"," I feel like we're fed some garbage to like everybody's out buying new like I guess. "
"7668380","7671720"," I'm appreciating assets and partying in Vegas and that kind of stuff."
"7672320","7675040"," But then like were some people maybe they weren't doing that."
"7675400","7677880"," They were actually like renovating their houses and they were. "
"7678240","7681120"," I always use this term where I'm like Mary the landscaper."
"7682020","7686660"," I'm like she was probably like like probably two kinds of Mary's out there is like a Mary that"
"7686660","7686880"," like."
"7686880","7690560"," Oh I always wanted to start a land because the game company never had any money to do it and"
"7690560","7691460"," that person did that. "
"7692540","7695900"," And then there's probably Mary the landscaper that was about to go bankrupt."
"7697420","7700420"," And she's like I just got a bunch of money I'm going to replace all my equipment."
"7701820","7705240"," And they kind of got to reprieve during COVID. "
"7705400","7709220"," I know a lot of you lost a lot of shit in COVID but it seems like there's this whole"
"7709220","7710560"," class of people out there that."
"7711400","7712980"," Didn't just piss their money away."
"7714080","7718740"," And so I'm like yeah we're going to we're going to crunch credit for them freeze credit for them"
"7718740","7719000"," but. "
"7719660","7722640"," We got to wait Mary out for the next two or three years."
"7725400","7729340"," Before they need to start buying new lawn mowers and new trucks and all that shit."
"7729580","7734120"," Even if they get a credit crunch it's like they probably don't repair that shit for two three"
"7734120","7734400"," years. "
"7734760","7737700"," It's like there's like mini cycle going on right now."
"7745340","7748980"," Yeah Mr. Yen is trying to clarify for you guys out there."
"7749040","7752180"," It's the rate of increase not the five percent. "
"7753340","7756140"," It's the rate of change the rate of increase of rates."
"7756640","7761620"," It's not like like Mr. Yen's saying I lived with by he lived with probably higher than five"
"7761620","7762100"," percent."
"7762620","7764440"," He used to be normal to have twenty percent. "
"7766440","7770860"," Fifteen percent twenty percent there were time you like time in our time a lot of time in our"
"7770860","7771160"," history."
"7771780","7775620"," Mr. Yen is also talking to some extent I think I'm trying to infer here but."
"7776500","7778500"," We're saying you may not see six thousand. "
"7778980","7784260"," If you look back historically in the fifty sixty seventies it was like sideways market for years"
"7784260","7785120"," and years and years."
"7789000","7792680"," My only fly in the ointment of that is the presidential election."
"7793240","7797340"," Like you get like a Reagan type guy running or girl or whatever running for president. "
"7798860","7801400"," They're like fuck yeah we're going to accept inflation."
"7802500","7805080"," We're going to pay everybody fifty dollars an hour."
"7806660","7808540"," We're going to snort a bunch of cocaine. "
"7809840","7811520"," Like oh man here we go."
"7813960","7815400"," Let's print some money baby."
"7816600","7817680"," That kind of shit. "
"7819560","7822200"," Yeah on the debt cycle man it's like mini debt cycle."
"7822560","7825700"," You know it's crazy too Mr. Yen is that I was drinking the Kool-Aid."
"7825840","7829840"," I was like I was like because that's like you get on Twitter and people are like yeah people are"
"7829840","7831140"," just pissing all this money away. "
"7831140","7833500"," They're snorting cocaine buying hookers."
"7834080","7836660"," They're you know partying it up at home and shit."
"7836820","7838740"," They're pissing all this money away they were given. "
"7839440","7843360"," And then you find out I'm like looking like normal like like p-tons a good one."
"7843940","7846960"," Like these like these companies like all these shitty companies right."
"7847480","7852520"," So if you're watching the stream right now Mr. Yen already knows this shit but in a normal debt"
"7852520","7853160"," cycle right. "
"7853780","7856420"," They free up credit and they give you the opportunity."
"7857000","7859760"," Let's say you're a young person they're like we're going to give you the opportunity."
"7859760","7862880"," Here is a bunch of money it's cheap and it's easy. "
"7864320","7866420"," You're a young VC or something."
"7867200","7868360"," You invented something."
"7868700","7871120"," You just graduated college and you're like a tech pro or something. "
"7871820","7873480"," So in this cycle you're getting some money right."
"7874080","7878320"," Now in that during that cycle you can either go and piss it away and hookers in cocaine."
"7879240","7880680"," You can build an actual product. "
"7881140","7882720"," You can fail to build an actual product."
"7883600","7885560"," You can buy a bunch of depreciating assets and shit."
"7885900","7888380"," Some people don't do that some companies do and don't do that. "
"7888380","7893040"," PCBs the window says ECB tightening is mostly done but still has a way to go."
"7893320","7896460"," The ones that do a good job right when it comes time for tightening."
"7897420","7900380"," They're like yeah I'm going to protect my money they're coming for it in taxes. "
"7900720","7905340"," They're coming for it in corporate taxes and county taxes in the houses I bought right."
"7906100","7907860"," I'm going to stop buying nice shit."
"7907960","7910620"," I'm going to just batten down the hatches until the next credit cycle. "
"7910840","7913200"," Some people like Peton and shit in a normal cycle."
"7913880","7917220"," Like all these companies right that were shit companies heading into 2019."
"7918380","7922920"," Like all these shit companies out there right they didn't in a normal debt cycle they'd be washed"
"7922920","7923380"," out. "
"7924220","7928640"," Some of these companies not just married the landscape but some of these companies are like we got"
"7928640","7930820"," a bunch of money and some of them did snort cocaine."
"7931160","7934280"," Peton's like they're like they're like we're reopening."
"7935640","7940660"," And did Peton go we should probably start to develop a bicycle for people to ride outside. "
"7941160","7944140"," Fuck no they didn't do that but they got a bunch of free money right."
"7945080","7945860"," So they got to reprieve."
"7945860","7947300"," Some of these companies got reprieves. "
"7947420","7950100"," Some of these companies did the right thing and they're like we were totally fucked."
"7950540","7951660"," Thank God we got some money."
"7951820","7953060"," We're going to do a better job. "
"7953240","7954480"," Some of these companies though didn't."
"7955640","7960480"," So it was like an artificial reprieve though for some of these small and middle size businesses."
"7961580","7965320"," You know like where they normally wouldn't get that free money anymore or a person wouldn't get"
"7965320","7965880"," that free money. "
"7966660","7969920"," There was that moment where some people were like I'm never going to fuck this up again."
"7971060","7977880"," It's like this mini small term short term debt cycle that's like grown it's grown out of it the"
"7977880","7979380"," side of our economy."
"7979740","7981380"," We don't normally have right. "
"7982280","7984700"," The normal debt cycle would have washed all these companies out."
"7985260","7987060"," All these people that made bad decisions."
"7987500","7991700"," People that make good decisions that have you know like they have health problems right. "
"7991820","7996200"," They fall off a ladder or something that they end of their working career right."
"7997220","8001480"," Given a reprieve during covid and you know people like oh they didn't get that much money."
"8001620","8005320"," I'm like you look at so many people are getting six figures seven figures. "
"8006040","8009280"," You know eight figures probably in some."
"8009420","8012360"," I didn't see the eight figures one but I saw six figures and seven figures."
"8013060","8014480"," Like just money just flowing. "
"8020980","8022200"," Yeah exactly man."
"8023240","8024420"," I agree with that man."
"8026580","8030680"," So Mr. Yen saying on the down leg of a debt cycle no one can get any money right. "
"8031060","8037640"," And Jay Powell said that he's like I think that the rest of the work will be done in a"
"8037640","8039680"," credit crunch coming later this year."
"8039900","8040900"," So we should have mentioned that earlier."
"8041760","8045760"," Like we have the debt sailing ball but truly the credit crunch. "
"8047920","8052400"," And took to Mr. Yen I guess I like I'll be on this stream and people will be like oh"
"8052400","8054200"," it's the twos and the tens or it's."
"8055340","8058540"," Inflation or it's this or it's that on macro shit."
"8058660","8063260"," And I'm like dude the only thing they ever fucking the only good indicator I know is unemployment. "
"8065080","8069500"," Like when you start and these young people don't like they're like what's really bad out there."
"8069620","8071900"," People who work in three jobs I'm like I'm fine with that."
"8072480","8078180"," I'm like I'm old enough to remember when it gets bad like people don't have jobs. "
"8078580","8081780"," You get a divorce your wife leaves you the dogs leave you the kids leave you."
"8082340","8084280"," There's empty houses on your street."
"8085020","8089280"," You know like me like you did the right thing right you're like okay I paid all my bills. "
"8089820","8091340"," I had a great job I didn't get laid off."
"8092800","8096100"," I bought a house I pay my bills every month I got a nice nice vehicle I have no problems"
"8096100","8097220"," paying I didn't even get laid off."
"8097800","8100040"," But then you look around your neighborhood and you're like oh shit. "
"8100720","8104240"," My house value is going down and it's not even my fault I did the right thing."
"8105460","8107080"," I'll never even recover from this."
"8107900","8111480"," For what other people have made bad decisions they get dragged into this. "
"8113100","8117800"," That's what we need right that's Mr. yet is saying is we do that credit crunch."
"8118300","8123660"," And this is a gross thing and disgusting thing to say but you got to hurt you got to hurt"
"8123660","8124520"," the people out there."
"8124860","8130400"," That aren't like Pete on you got to hurt like Jim and Bob and Mike and Mary and Sue. "
"8131120","8136380"," These people that are like they're either older or they made bad decisions like you got to take"
"8136380","8137060"," their jobs away."
"8137080","8141740"," Take their families away take the car away well they try to get a car and live out of the"
"8141740","8142980"," car but they take their house away."
"8143200","8146460"," Take that fancy F two fifty they're buying for a thousand away. "
"8146600","8151080"," Three eighty one wipe out went trigger a payout and you put the pain on them."
"8152280","8155760"," It's horrible but that's what happens the credit crunch comes in."
"8169300","8170700"," Yeah exactly man. "
"8173620","8176740"," We're not seeing that yet like I want to see blood in the streets."
"8176740","8179280"," I want to see like I want to see mass layoffs."
"8180140","8183140"," I've lived through so I was a kid during eighty seven during that crash. "
"8183620","8184760"," My dad lost everything."
"8185700","8189660"," Lost it all gone like an overnight boom gone."
"8190800","8192420"," Two thought days to live in veil. "
"8193100","8196440"," I lived the veil with the the Enron boys are up there partying and skiing."
"8197340","8198240"," Disappeared one day."
"8198860","8200400"," There's like two kinds of money that was up in veil. "
"8201139","8203740"," It's old school money and there was the new money."
"8204660","8205440"," And they just disappeared."
"8208080","8209639"," It was a great indicator too. "
"8209780","8211980"," I watched veil marketing to rich people right."
"8212260","8215100"," And then all of a sudden veil was marketing to middle class people."
"8216780","8220180"," Someone that would keep his job or her job through through a recession. "
"8220660","8222459"," It was like all of a sudden yeah come off the valance key."
"8223459","8224719"," Different kind of people right."
"8224959","8226059"," You went from drinking Christal. "
"8227660","8229680"," To old world money what they drink."
"8231160","8232120"," Some camis."
"8233940","8234820"," Old reliable. "
"8239020","8239500"," Right."
"8239600","8242620"," Then you go out to eat cuz sitting in a bar and you'd have to see a family in there."
"8242860","8244820"," That was like the once in a lifetime trip. "
"8244820","8245959"," They could finally go to veil."
"8246200","8247840"," I'm like yeah we're definitely in a recession now."
"8260370","8264330"," Trading back up to retest for twelve eighty four right now. "
"8265910","8268070"," I agree with the tightening too fast but."
"8269030","8271889"," I think like I think we continue to tighten over time."
"8271889","8273510"," I think we're dragging this shit out. "
"8273510","8274809"," I don't like the support."
"8275809","8278250"," As we go along shit just drags it out."
"8278370","8278930"," I'm like doing it. "
"8279010","8280430"," I'm like we're going to do this for three years."
"8281570","8283290"," And Mr. Yen saying probably."
"8286290","8286730"," Sideways. "
"8289090","8290330"," Sideways and up and then."
"8291370","8296090"," Two three capitulations every year and then the bloodbath would come before we know it."
"8298770","8300209"," Everyone's still working too. "
"8300690","8302889"," We need to shake out all these shitty companies."
"8303330","8303629"," We need."
"8304690","8306110"," We need everyone that's good. "
"8306190","8310290"," We need everyone that bought a theft to fifty for a hundred fifty thousand dollars."
"8310910","8316170"," We need that we need that we need that truck to start breaking down and crunch the credit on that"
"8316170","8316469"," guy."
"8318170","8318650"," Right. "
"8319850","8324389"," To where you can't afford to replace it with another brand spanking new shiny f two fifty."
"8334910","8337410"," Hey Mr. What I appreciate for showing up today."

"8361090","8365250"," I'll make it available only for members or something or I'll delete it if you want me to."
"8365629","8366290"," I'll do it."

"8403370","8404130"," I can't be bothered."

"9994010","9998750"," She has orange is down low orange down low orange down low orange down low. "
"10000790","10003510"," So this orange is kind of high right now, right?"
"10005010","10009010"," With that said, there's still some legs left."
"10011410","10014550"," See right here, grind higher here on the yellow."
"10015530","10021930"," Still a little bit of legs left on General Mills, but in all likelihood, it's not like the entry"
"10021930","10022810"," point on it. "
"10023530","10029030"," So in a higher time frame over a bunch of time, we're a little top heavy down here on the"
"10029030","10033450"," quarterly, the monthly, the weekly, we could extend like grind higher."
"10034390","10037630"," You want a couple places to take it, like long still."
"10038670","10040310"," You've got some targets down below. "
"10040550","10041790"," You're on the daily right now."
"10042190","10046710"," That's at 88, 27 stops underneath it."
"10047110","10053550"," Next target below would be 83.40. It's always a good buy in the blue line. "
"10053730","10054590"," That's the monthly."
"10054970","10058950"," That's down at 73.12. I think it still has legs right now."
"10060890","10062010"," But for how long?"
"10062970","10064530"," Probably not for too much longer. "
"10087280","10091080"," Here it is on the daily is starting to roll."
"10091220","10092160"," I don't like it right now."
"10092280","10092900"," Be honest with you. "
"10093300","10095880"," So I said I liked it, but you probably still has legs."
"10096020","10096760"," Probably not."
"10096960","10098740"," It's got legs, but not like you're thinking. "
"10100200","10102600"," You'll probably get a bounce right here at some point."
"10102800","10106200"," You'll get a, what I'm going to say here is probably going to get a bounce on 88, 33."
"10108300","10111480"," This could extend, but it's a, it's going to roll over. "
"10111560","10114740"," It's coming into a roll over next month, next two weeks."
"10115800","10117600"," I would expect to roll over on it."
"10118340","10127960"," GIS target down below 83.83 or 83.33. And in a cup four weeks, this will be 85"
"10127960","10128500"," bucks. "
"10128980","10132400"," So price target on general mills, 85 dollars."
"10134240","10140430"," I think you, I think you get the bounce."
"10140690","10144090"," And then, so another note to you too, is I think you get the bounce ready. "
"10144350","10145730"," I think you catch a bounce on."
"10147810","10152590"," 88 32 and you're then going to sell it at 89 80."
"10153490","10156450"," And look for that 85 bucks somewhere in there. "
"10161740","10162820"," Nice shout out."
"10188970","10191770"," Vick's trying to hold on right here and find some support."
"10210750","10212930"," Just a note for where we are right now. "
"10212930","10214190"," I want to show you guys something here."
"10222400","10227980"," I really don't like these like charting this stuff, but just an idea right here."
"10231920","10234380"," You're like, why are we finding resistance here?"
"10235020","10235940"," You can see it, right?"
"10239810","10241650"," It's been working, right?"
"10242850","10248130"," Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell and they're trying to sell it there. "
"10248350","10250630"," And they're again trying to do that right now."
"10252110","10255390"," One, two, three, four, five, six sessions."
"10266000","10268300"," This is kind of the place they want to sell it, right?"
"10268560","10270140"," It's not going to be easy to squeeze up here. "
"10271020","10272880"," It hasn't worked in six sessions."
"10280430","10281950"," Do it until it breaks, right?"
"10297080","10302020"," First little liquidation break on the six EMA in the five minute chart."
"10302200","10303400"," We'll look at it on the on the one minute. "
"10303400","10304020"," See right here."
"10304020","10305300"," The nice little roll right here."
"10306040","10307200"," It's 12 18. "
"10307540","10312900"," If we are, excuse me, if bulls can't get a new high right here, we'll roll down and test for"
"10312900","10313720"," 12 13."
"10314580","10319560"," And then possibly come down here and see if there's any real support in the hourly coming into one"
"10319560","10320500"," PM over here."
"10326550","10328050"," Panging by a thread here, bulls. "
"10343420","10345040"," You got 12 minutes, bulls."
"10346040","10347040"," Two more bars."
"10355160","10360080"," So just reiterating what had been said earlier, house rep speaker McCarthy had debt ceiling"
"10360080","10362320"," agreements by Sunday is doable. "
"10374990","10376590"," No worries, Connor, I got your brother."
"10384470","10389450"," You know, that's a good, so Perma Bear just said, hold on a second, we're going to get some of"
"10389450","10389750"," this stuff."
"10395010","10397430"," Perma Bear just said, sorry to step away for work stuff real quick. "
"10397570","10399290"," Looks like Chase addressed it from a technical perspective."
"10400030","10402610"," There is not much that has pushed us higher."
"10402910","10406590"," CPI, PPI, good earnings season, debt default, potential hasn't driven us downward. "
"10408050","10412390"," It is fully expected, in my opinion, that agreement in reach is reached in price then."
"10412630","10415230"," So maybe we get a quick pop of the news, but it will sell off."
"10415970","10417070"," You know, it's fascinating about that. "
"10417070","10423610"," That's David in Perma Bear."
"10423610","10425050"," It was like four, twenty, and four, eighteen."
"10426310","10428090"," And then immediately trigger to sell. "
"10428430","10429870"," And Mr. Yen mentioned that earlier."
"10430210","10433670"," He was like, yeah, I want to see four, thirty, forty or forty three hundred."
"10433690","10436250"," And what I expect to there to be a major short there. "
"10440840","10442480"," That does bring that question, right?"
"10444180","10445840"," I think about that shit with."
"10448600","10453040"," I can ask sometimes in stream, like, what are your thoughts on if the Ukraine war ended?"
"10453300","10454600"," I'm like, I'm bearish on it."
"10455120","10458020"," And people are like, well, you said it would squeeze and I'm like, yeah, it'll do both. "
"10458100","10460460"," Like, you'll get this, like, liquidity grab on high."
"10461740","10465860"," Everybody will be all bold up, as Chase says, and then boom, we start selling."
"10466460","10468020"," Because the war is over, man. "
"10468200","10469100"," It's going to fuck with our GDP."
"10470080","10479440"," So, yeah, you can get just the, like, the initial."
"10480700","10483840"," Hey, the debt ceiling, the debt ceiling crisis has been solved. "
"10484220","10484460"," Whoopee!"
"10484460","10489500"," We just rip faces, 70 points, 30 points, whatever it is, 10 points."
"10489680","10490000"," I don't care."
"10490640","10493690"," And it's just another opportunity to be like, boom, sell it. "
"10502840","10509760"," Yeah, he was here this morning, and so Brian was here this morning saying that he's going to do an"
"10509760","10511720"," interview with us on a Saturday or Sunday."
"10512460","10516120"," We'll do a Saturday, Sunday livestream for a couple hours."
"10516720","10518520"," What we'll try to do is something cool. "
"10518760","10522160"," We could take maybe, maybe we develop some questions."
"10523360","10525860"," I'll, maybe, Binking Out will develop some questions."
"10526240","10528260"," I'll tell you what the questions are. "
"10528900","10531120"," And if you're like, no, that sucks, get rid of that one."
"10533720","10537480"," And if Brian is like, yeah, that one sucks about answering that shit."
"10539240","10544160"," And then we ask you to submit some questions before we do the interview. "
"10544160","10549520"," So you guys can take part in what the questions are as my point."
"10550580","10555640"," And then we'll submit whatever we, whatever we talk about to them and say, is there anything here"
"10555640","10556600"," that you want to answer?"
"10556820","10557500"," Don't want to answer?"
"10557680","10558420"," And then we'll do a livestream."
"10560560","10562080"," And we'll do an interview with them. "
"10562380","10563720"," And we'll ask them these questions."
"10564460","10565880"," We'll submit them to them before the interviews."
"10565880","10567880"," We know what to answer. "
"10568680","10573240"," And then during the livestream, we'll do a Q&A from the chat."
"10574920","10575660"," We'll hang out."
"10575720","10576640"," We'll have a bourbon or something. "
"10576660","10577560"," We'll just hang out, man."
"10582700","10583340"," Yeah, dude."
"10583500","10587160"," My phone died when his live stream was on and I was out and about. "
"10587340","10588340"," I didn't have my charger with me."
"10588900","10591060"," So I was, I was watching them on YouTube."
"10591320","10592860"," My phone and my fucking phone died. "
"10593020","10593380"," I was pissed."
"10598020","10606080"," And wound up in a wound up in a, I got home late and then I didn't get done."
"10607620","10609800"," I was out very late and then I got done. "
"10609960","10610360"," Ready for this?"
"10610480","10610880"," I got home."
"10611760","10613880"," And I was like, I'm going to set this shit up for tomorrow."
"10613880","10616420"," I'm going to put this, this new rig together. "
"10617420","10622860"," That shit took me till five a.m. So I was up till five and then I went to sleep"
"10622860","10625180"," for, I think, three or four hours."
"10627920","10629120"," And I don't normally sleep."
"10629300","10632760"," So my sleep schedule normally is I go to bed early at night time. "
"10632760","10640280"," And I don't, I don't spend during the week when I'm with you guys, I go to bed early and"
"10640280","10645520"," then I'm up at four a.m. Like if the market's not crazy, like we're going to have a market"
"10645520","10649040"," crash at two o'clock in the morning, I will sleep early."
"10650160","10653460"," And then I wake up at four in the morning and get ready for the day for you guys."
"10653740","10654560"," Believe it or not that early. "
"10655880","10657140"," I used to be able to take naps."
"10657400","10659140"," Recently I'm been working out in the morning."
"10659880","10663220"," Oh, that'll change this week. "
"10663440","10665480"," I've been having to do a bunch of stuff at night time."
"10667520","10671480"," So on top of all that stuff, my whole sleep schedule flipped this week."
"10673040","10678500"," So I left a note next to myself for my wife and I said, because normally if I'm not awake"
"10678500","10683120"," at eight in the morning or something, she's like, get out of bed, something's wrong, you know?"
"10684160","10685080"," Why aren't you awake?"
"10685700","10689380"," So I left her a note this morning and I was like, please let me sleep until eight thirty. "
"10689560","10694460"," I was awake until five o'clock this morning trying to set up my office."
"10695620","10697220"," And so she let me sleep in."
"10698220","10703580"," And then she just gently woke me up with a cup of coffee and made my whole entire day. "
"10703780","10704200"," It was awesome."
"10704840","10706140"," It was so awesome."
"10706380","10709560"," So I got, I think I got four hours or is that five, six, seven, eight. "
"10709840","10711960"," I got like three hours of sleep."
"10712620","10713360"," It's really all I need."
"10713360","10720660"," So, yeah, and I didn't make any tweets last night. "
"10721060","10721800"," I don't think I did."
"10722500","10723280"," Oh, I might have had."
"10723520","10728820"," So I do have, I do have people that help me tweet. "
"10729260","10731980"," I don't know if you know that, but I have, I do have people help me tweet."
"10734400","10736820"," So that was not, that was not personally me."
"10738740","10742600"," I do have people in the background that have access to my Twitter. "
"10747280","10747680"," Yeah."
"10747920","10748260"," So I know."
"10748440","10753020"," So, so if you see me awake at night, so the, so if you see me awake at night time,"
"10754240","10758940"," I'm trading futures to hedge a position during the day and I hate doing it. "
"10759560","10765060"," Like I, I, I don't want to be a, like the futures, Globex, like PJ trading."
"10766140","10767280"," Fucks up my whole life."
"10767520","10768340"," I try not to. "
"10768440","10771820"," I try to close my positions during the day and get out and like have a normal life."
"10773060","10775860"," But then like sometimes I'm like, yeah, I'm buying some calls here."
"10776120","10778540"," And then I'm like, ah, shit, what they do after the bell. "
"10778540","10780220"," I'm like, I got to stay awake for this shit."
"10781720","10783600"," I got to counter a trade that I took."
"10783760","10785340"," That's like a key part of trading, right?"
"10785800","10787400"," Like a, like a rule you should have. "
"10787720","10794220"," You should, if you're a day trader and you're taking a lotto overnight, you should always have"
"10794220","10798240"," access to a, uh, to trade in futures to hedge your, your trade."
"10799560","10802780"," Otherwise you're just like, yeah, it's not a high probability trade."
"10803980","10806440"," So you have to be able to like come out in the middle of the night and be like, we're"
"10806440","10807520"," going to sell the fuck out of this. "
"10807700","10811380"," Or if you're like, I got a ton of puts and we start ripping face overnight."
"10811780","10814180"," Like you got to be able to get in there and counter that trade."
"10815860","10817160"," Or you'll be broke soon enough. "
"10820900","10824400"," Yeah, I sold, I think I was selling it like nine o'clock at night and then I, I wrapped"
"10824400","10825740"," it up around midnight or something."
"10826220","10828140"," We had like a double bottom or something like that."
"10828260","10828900"," And I'm like, fuck this. "
"10829020","10829540"," I'm out of here."
"10838130","10843850"," So if you're like, normally I don't carry stuff overnight, but if I do and the trade's going the"
"10843850","10845310"," other way, I will stay up."
"10845490","10846190"," I'll like fuck that. "
"10846350","10846650"," I'm awake."
"10851770","10853170"," It's like it's, it's."
"10855110","10861810"," But I personally normal, like normally I do not like doing overnight holds on day trade and shit. "
"10861910","10864630"," I don't normally must have a high conviction."
"10864950","10866770"," Yeah, we're definitely gapping up that kind of shit."
"10866990","10868510"," You'll see people out at nighttime too. "
"10870490","10875330"," You'll see people that are like, like, I used to, I used to, so back in the days that hold"
"10875330","10876270"," a lot of shit overnight."
"10878010","10880690"," And I'd be like, man, I saw that guy all day long today."
"10882430","10888150"," I saw a horse lover fat all day long today and he's up with me at nighttime at two in"
"10888150","10888470"," the morning. "
"10891370","10896610"," You know, it's kind of like the life of a trader sometimes, right?"
"10896850","10900250"," No sleep trying to, trying to hedge yourself."
"10918530","10921450"," All I mean, we're assuming you guys are saying fall block is saying cap."
"10921610","10923370"," I have a word feeling today is they break out. "
"10923470","10924810"," L.O.L. use me as an indicator."
"10926370","10928670"," Remember this little white line that I got here right now?"
"10928730","10929970"," We'll find out if we break out."
"10930330","10933270"," It would be unexpected for us to break out to the upside. "
"10936990","10937350"," Flama."
"10939730","10940990"," You still here with this brother?"
"10941930","10943370"," Squeezing right now."
"10943990","10947870"," 413 C's starting to print a little bit here. "
"10948610","10952510"," We now have 300,000 calls on 412 C."
"10974210","10975740"," I just took some profit there."
"10979850","10980550"," Sweet."
"10981030","10981590"," I'm flat again. "
"10987120","10988760"," See if we can get above here."
"10995140","10998650"," First time in six sessions, squeezing above."
"11000950","11001990"," Cell side. "
"11005980","11008140"," See if we can park our ass up in here."
"11008300","11009880"," We need to be able to park our ass right here."
"11010460","11012960"," A new high at 12.30 for the bulls. "
"11017560","11019080"," New high for the bulls."
"11019480","11022060"," Hedge coming off the market on a Wednesday."
"11023220","11026520"," Who thought we'd be trading 413 on a Wednesday?"
"11031690","11032330"," Nobody. "
"11035690","11040750"," On the bounce, squeezing up to 412.90. Six right now."
"11041710","11047450"," Just noticing some P500 extending gains up around spot 5% on the session so far."
"11047830","11051150"," Also stocks rebounding on hope that a narrow group of awards. "
"11051530","11052790"," Go back and read the chat."

"16781700","16783140"," There's the hourly right there right."
"16783640","16786080"," And maybe it's a little bit lower. "
"16788720","16790240"," He's going to try to close the gap."
"16796490","16802030"," Connor's like a like a like a I don't know like a rattlesnake or something."
"16803050","16804550"," It's okay if this comes down. "

"16820290","16821690"," That's what your triggers are right."
"16822870","16824330"," So I got a game deal with this. "
"16825030","16827310"," If he sees this rip cord."
"16830900","16832600"," But he knows what he's looking at."

"17769530","17771590"," In the background, I assure you of something. "
"17771590","17777250"," My wife, my kids, my friends, people that I'm partners with know that I care."
"17778390","17779390"," For all of you out there."
"17790690","17792010"," Bull's lagging right now. "
"17793110","17796490"," I said they had a half an hour to 220, 230, right?"
"17796930","17797410"," We're now at 223."
"17798130","17798990"," They got seven more minutes."
"17799190","17800490"," They better turn around if they can't. "
"17800950","17802690"," We have a couple targets down below."
"17804250","17805710"," Four, 14, 64."
"17810760","17812160"," Four, 12, 70. "
"17814540","17816660"," Another thing bulls are trying to do right here."
"17816820","17817860"," Even if they do pull back."
"17820860","17823500"," Bulls are trying to do what bears are trying to do, right?"
"17824340","17826320"," I'm going to show you what bears are trying to do. "
"17826520","17828280"," It's like just all this shit right here."
"17828620","17833720"," Bulls are trying to say you shall not pass, right?"
"17833720","17839680"," Even if you erase this stuff, bears are trying to say, or bulls are trying to say, even if you"
"17839680","17841320"," go down here, we're going back up again."
"17841980","17843360"," That's what they're attempting to do. "
"17843820","17845740"," This is a support level they're trying to build."
"17848620","17849540"," Now, do they get it?"
"17849680","17850000"," I don't know."
"17850440","17853300"," I'm going to show you in the inverse what bears are trying to do here. "
"17854920","17855520"," Or sell side."
"17862110","17863570"," This is where the daily trigger was."
"17863710","17864130"," It was higher. "
"17864130","17866070"," It was right here."
"17866130","17867310"," This is what the daily trigger was yesterday."
"17868250","17871430"," The daily trigger was right here yesterday. "
"17872710","17876310"," Sell side wanted to not touch it."
"17877610","17879410"," I wanted to get underneath it."
"17880930","17883050"," They didn't care if they got the snap back here. "
"17883490","17886110"," They want to get underneath it so they can sell it down."
"17886510","17887030"," You see that?"
"17887730","17890110"," I want you to think about this on the inverse to the upside."
"17893010","17894230"," Now, does that happen?"
"17894550","17895070"," I don't know. "
"17898150","17901910"," The big thing for bulls here is that they're like, hey, this is ours."
"17902530","17903110"," We own it."
"17905190","17906930"," You can see it right here going back. "
"17907410","17908810"," A bunch of sessions, right?"

"18503950","18504950"," There's like a couple things here. "
"18505410","18507630"," Number one, it's like you're going in somebody else's house."
"18509250","18510050"," To respect."
"18511430","18516930"," Who part about going in this house is all you have to be like is like, Hey, look, I apologize. "
"18517510","18520410"," I'm a serial this or I'm a serial that I really like doing this."
"18520450","18523030"," They will probably give you your own room to do that in."
"18526130","18531050"," When you go in some of this court, I always recommend be quiet, ask around, meet friends. "
"18532710","18533670"," Win friends."
"18536330","18539050"," No, I feel like I can't do that or I understand that."
"18539130","18539530"," I get it. "
"18541030","18544510"," Be like, Hey, can I have a room that I can go into and then meet some people you like"
"18544510","18546490"," and be like, Hey, I like you and I like you."
"18546590","18547570"," Can we go in there and fuck around?"
"18548270","18551110"," I don't think anyone has a problem with that from my understanding of discord."
"18553390","18557530"," If you read the rules, say I'll follow the rules and then say, Hey, look, there's no place for me. "
"18557610","18558650"," They'll make you a place."
"18559310","18560130"," That's my understanding."
"18561450","18565830"," The last part that I would state would be that everybody's a volunteer. "
"18566030","18566570"," I'm a volunteer."
"18566870","18569990"," Their volunteer is like, you know, it's hard."
"18570150","18571190"," It's not easy to be a volunteer. "
"18571690","18572210"," It sucks."
"18572770","18574210"," I mean, it's great, but it sucks, right?"
"18574470","18574930"," It doesn't suck."
"18575150","18575430"," It's hard. "
"18575530","18579150"," It's a hard thing to like to describe."
"18579670","18581710"," Like you love it, but it's hard."
"18581870","18585310"," And then if somebody's making it harder on you, you're like, Oh, man, I can't have that. "
"18586650","18587330"," You know what I mean?"
"18587370","18588410"," Like you love doing it."
"18588410","18592750"," But then if someone's making it hard for you and I know what you're taught."
"18592970","18596110"," You know, I know that anyone out there in the stream knows that I'm talking about. "
"18596510","18599530"," Like my father, my dad, right?"
"18599850","18601170"," I can hit every button on him."
"18601770","18603730"," He'd be like, Bam, pissed him off."
"18604430","18605650"," Bam, pissed him off. "
"18606130","18607150"," Bam, pissed him off."
"18608890","18610530"," I knew how to do that to my dad, right?"
"18612370","18615110"," Some people did, but some people I'd do that shit too."
"18615130","18616650"," They'd be like, what are you doing, little man?"
"18618110","18619150"," I'm going to squash you. "
"18620830","18623410"," Or who's the regard over there?"
"18623950","18626930"," Like sometimes you got somebody's number and you're like, Bam, Bam."
"18628110","18629370"," And you know what you're doing."
"18629530","18630210"," I know what I'm doing. "
"18630210","18631050"," I did to my dad."
"18631390","18632350"," We all do it to people."
"18632750","18633930"," Like I got that girl's number. "
"18634070","18635170"," I got that guy's number."
"18635830","18637930"," It's just that guy was getting paid."
"18639150","18641810"," I'm telling you that they wouldn't care that you had their number. "
"18642370","18643450"," But they're not getting paid."
"18643830","18644570"," None of us are getting paid."
"18644570","18647450"," But if it's not for you, right?"
"18647830","18648610"," Find something else. "
"18648930","18650010"," Not you personally, Nick."
"18650210","18653310"," But like you're like, I'm going to go in there and just do this and do that."
"18653590","18653970"," Piss around. "
"18654270","18654410"," Shit."
"18655170","18655950"," Smear it all over the walls."
"18656250","18660850"," Like if you're not helping somewhere else for you, man. "
"18661070","18661990"," Go do that shit somewhere else."
"18662170","18662570"," Like a Twitter."
"18662830","18664250"," You can go to Twitter and do whatever you want. "
"18664410","18666470"," You can smear shit all over the walls."
"18667670","18668490"," Nobody cares, right?"
"18672030","18673490"," This isn't directed at you, Nick."
"18673490","18675470"," This is just directed at everybody in the stream. "
"18684560","18685600"," Primals back."
"18686160","18687780"," You dirty dog."
"18695030","18698530"," Henry Chang said, made some good money since following you, man. "
"18698690","18700410"," Appreciate the help and you deserve a follow."
"18701650","18702590"," Primals back."
"18703110","18703610"," What are you doing?"
"18704410","18704710"," I know. "
"18704910","18709390"," I figured that we'd attract the real traders in here doing this."
"18709650","18711310"," We have to keep it."
"18712830","18713830"," We're here to make money. "
"18715410","18716030"," Primals back."
"18716370","18716610"," Hey, man."
"18716850","18717170"," Toy support. "
"18717990","18718770"," Charged with a chat."
"18718970","18720290"," It moves a lot of the background noise."
"18720710","18722610"," My wife's boyfriend approved the idea as well. "
"18723270","18723890"," Right on, brother."
"18729450","18730590"," You'll be quiet, Nick."
"18730850","18733690"," So you don't actually be quiet in the discord. "
"18734230","18735390"," I want you to like, flush there."
"18735530","18736630"," I want everybody to flush there."
"18736970","18738330"," Just like, find the place for yourself. "
"18739230","18740470"," Like, hey, I need this or I need that."
"18740630","18740990"," Can I get it?"
"18741930","18742610"," Alright, it'll be a month later."
"18742750","18743070"," No problem. "
"18743070","18744810"," It'll be nice about it even asking for it."
"18745430","18747110"," I think everybody can have a place in there."
"18747230","18748630"," It's just a matter of patience. "
"18749170","18749790"," Ask nicely."
"18750630","18752670"," And then get your own friends to go in there and hang out with you."
"18754950","18759450"," I mean, I think there's a time and a place for like the whole discord doing their thing together as"
"18759450","18759730"," a group. "
"18759950","18761110"," But like, read the rules."
"18761310","18762570"," Be like, okay, I can do this here."
"18762670","18763270"," I can do that there. "
"18764210","18765110"," You know, try to help them out."
"18765210","18765890"," I'll be honest with you."
"18766630","18770810"," I'm not going to publicly say this, but I don't want to publicly say this. "
"18770810","18774710"," But if I was going to a discord, I'd be like, who do I become friends with so I don't"
"18774710","18775130"," get banned?"
"18776450","18777470"," Even if I don't like them."
"18777610","18779690"," Who do I appease over here?"
"18782430","18786330"," I got to do that when I call for a bill that's all messed up."
"18786410","18789590"," I got to do that with, you know, and I got to get my car washed. "
"18789730","18790490"," I got to be nice, right?"
"18790810","18792290"," Order food at Wendy's or something."
"18792890","18795470"," I'd be like, hey, man, thanks for taking care of me."
"18795550","18796150"," I appreciate it. "

"18889390","18890330"," See if we see anything here."
"18890950","18891910"," Is this a cliff?"
"18895960","18898040"," You see that smart money down there?"
"18902810","18905450"," It's done at 4156 on ES. "

"18952910","18955550"," Price trading below the O line, right?"
"18955730","18957710"," We'd like to see that if you're selling here, right?"
"18957910","18959430"," Rejection above at 4186."
"18960490","18966110"," We know that at 1.30 to 2.30, the bulls are not able to get a new high. "
"18971910","18975030"," We know there's support on this white line right here, right?"
"18975170","18976950"," We know that this is one of the triggers."
"18978950","18981810"," I'm going to go over some stuff for the bears here that want to sell."
"18982350","18983150"," Because I love bears. "

"18984650","18986630"," I know you don't believe that, but I do."
"18986830","18987690"," I want to tell you something. "
"18989170","18990830"," I'm going to show you a couple things."
"18994330","18996810"," If you're a bear out there, this is for you."
"19001010","19003090"," Daily velocity, you've got to bump today, right?"
"19003210","19004410"," But we know it's down, right?"
"19004550","19006350"," We know this is not the place we're buying. "
"19006790","19008090"," I mean, you can buy, like, entertainment."
"19008710","19011610"," But we already know that we're at the top is up here."
"19012330","19014530"," Rolled it right over from this top back here. "
"19014910","19016710"," There's a good thing to be looking at here, actually."
"19018730","19019850"," So right there, right?"
"19020150","19020450"," Teed off."
"19021550","19024450"," I want you to keep your eye on this hourly velocity right here. "
"19025270","19027270"," You can see that we're topping out on the daily."
"19028330","19029750"," See it up here as well."
"19030790","19032650"," Not quite there yet. "
"19033530","19035090"," Thin trading in here."
"19035270","19035870"," You can see that."
"19036130","19036630"," Not much movement. "
"19038030","19038930"," It's toppy."
"19039490","19043350"," We got toppy at 1.30. You can see it right here in this hourly."
"19043730","19044610"," 1.30, you got toppy. "
"19045850","19048010"," Pretty big fucking squeeze there, right?"
"19051310","19053430"," See it better right now, right?"
"19054690","19058430"," Higher lows, higher lows in velocity, higher lows, higher lows in velocity."
"19058430","19061370"," One minute's a little bit like, yeah, it's okay."
"19061550","19063270"," But the five in the hour are important. "
"19064590","19066130"," Where does that take us?"
"19066470","19067890"," Takes us down to test."
"19071290","19078070"," 4.14.73. As long as price stays below that yellow line."
"19079430","19081970"," I'm going to hope for a retrace down here. "
"19085310","19090150"," Target down below 4.12.50. Trade is dead."
"19091690","19095270"," If we trade above at any point, what if we get the break here?"
"19096030","19098070"," This is 4.14.60 maybe."
"19098730","19100650"," I'm going to be aware of this if you're a bear. "
"19102910","19104470"," You get the red bar below."
"19105990","19108550"," You get the confirmation that we're going lower."
"19108770","19110610"," Your stops are above up here, okay?"
"19111550","19121140"," For that sweet juice target down here at 4.12.50. How does that translate"
"19121140","19121920"," for you?"
"19122200","19123400"," You see this green bar right here?"
"19123980","19125560"," You want to see red bar down below?"
"19127140","19130140"," You want to see rejection candles here?"
"19131820","19134440"," And then you take that short straight down right there, okay?"
"19135180","19136040"," It stops above. "
"19142970","19150650"," 4.12.86. I got 4.12.31 though as the real target."
"19151850","19152490"," Hold on."
"19152650","19153830"," I'm going to change this here. "
"19157600","19159420"," Make sure I got this right for you, brothers."
"19160260","19164160"," 4.12.36. So this 4.12.69 is backing off now."
"19183140","19185820"," And that's what a bear wants, the whole move erased. "
"19187820","19192680"," If you're a bear, remember what I said to you."
"19192760","19193820"," You want to see a red bar."
"19194080","19197360"," What you're looking for is a red bar below this. "
"19200200","19201240"," A failure."
"19202680","19204640"," Another red bar right here."
"19204760","19206120"," And this is where you get your blood. "
"19206820","19209320"," Here, water flame futures, forex and stock instruments."
"19210060","19211900"," This is where you enter the trade here."
"19211900","19212460"," Don't come. "
"19214380","19217300"," Once you get the reversal, you put your stops on."
"19218120","19220600"," What you don't do is take the trade in here."
"19222320","19223820"," This is the chop zone. "
"19223980","19227780"," This is where you get a bear trap."
"19239280","19239720"," Vicks."
"19240060","19245220"," I wanted to give you guys a heads up is in Contango right now. "
"19245360","19246360"," Vicks trading higher."
"19248140","19249500"," That's not real Contango."
"19249680","19250060"," It's like this. "
"19250820","19252420"," It isn't right now at the moment."
"19254360","19256420"," Earlier today, it was for a brief moment."
"19256760","19258520"," But I'm like a one minute or a five minute chart. "
"19269010","19270010"," Vicks right now."
"19276120","19280140"," With a bounce, price trading above the one in the five minute."
"19282500","19290670"," Bears want to see this loop and price stay above"
"19290670","19295650"," 17.05. They want to see the rip up confirmation. "
"19297350","19299090"," That's where you put your trade on the spy."
"19299970","19302190"," Target above 17 and change."
"19303770","19305790"," 17, 40, 17, 50. "
"19306790","19307130"," Above that."
"19308910","19309510"," 1782."
"19311670","19312270"," Ooh. "
"19313270","19314570"," Valhalla for bears."
"19315070","19325710"," They were wanting this yesterday, $20.04. Talk about a"
"19325710","19327830"," thirst trap for bears, huh?"
"19328230","19329690"," Man, what a thirst trap."
"19332970","19334430"," I will say this. "
"19335330","19336590"," I do want to show you something."
"19343700","19344900"," Nope, it's not there."
"19345480","19348580"," Daily, Daily Velocity is still to the downside on Vicks. "
"19350820","19351800"," I'm wrong there."
"19355850","19357990"," Or not with Daily Velocity, Daily Trigger."
"19360630","19362370"," It's still to the downside for bears. "
"19363410","19364390"," Just pure rejection."
"19365830","19368030"," And the Daily Trigger on Vicks is still coming down."
"19368210","19369530"," If it hasn't turned back up yet. "
"19371150","19375350"," I always like to see, like, the velocity of the, like, max bearish on Vicks."
"19375350","19380210"," And then the Daily Trigger is turning up and not coming down."
"19380770","19383370"," So we don't have the holy trifecta just yet for the bears. "
"19386510","19387330"," OPEC's weak."
"19390130","19391710"," Staying strong, right?"
"19393610","19394830"," Showing up every day."
"19400930","19402810"," Oh, yeah, right?"
"19409970","19414930"," Boom, boom, boom, boom. "
"19414930","19415530"," Broke to the upside."
"19416410","19417310"," That's where we broke."
"19421890","19422730"," Broke to the downside. "
"19423350","19423870"," Broke to the upside."
"19424590","19425530"," Where do we go?"
"19425770","19427530"," Do we smash above and tag 420?"
"19428590","19428650"," 430?"
"19429570","19429830"," Nobody knows."
"19430430","19431190"," I will tell you this. "
"19433770","19434810"," If you're a bull."
"19439980","19441520"," Oh, I'm getting some weirdness here."
"19443120","19443840"," There we go. "
"19450430","19452490"," This is where they tee off and sell, right?"
"19452490","19460530"," If you're a bull, the second part of this trade is above and consolidation to get that tag on 420."
"19464390","19469010"," If you're a bull, your next trade to the upside is up here."
"19473810","19478770"," Bears trying to sell this down right now. "
"19478770","19480410"," For 1242."
"19482750","19485190"," Into actual OPEC's."
"19488470","19493090"," Close that bad boy out at 410, man, for all them spreads. "
"19496840","19506300"," On Monday, tomorrow's Thursday and Monday we talked about what was the highest probability Thursday"
"19506300","19509140"," we said 410."
"19510220","19512260"," For OPEC's on Thursday."
"19513940","19516480"," We said it on Monday, 410. "
"19517740","19520380"," What's the next highest probability in the OPEC's?"
"19520460","19524120"," That's tomorrow, 415, 405."
"19525460","19528500"," What's the least probable trade in OPEC's?"
"19529920","19532180"," 420, 400."
"19536470","19539670"," Park this bad boy, this big old truck right in there. "
"19543660","19544620"," Thursday, OPEC's."
"19547080","19549480"," I guess that's when we're free to do whatever we want."
"19549580","19549960"," I don't know. "
"19553200","19554760"," Flying the ointment for the bears."
"19555940","19557220"," Closer we get to 420."
"19558260","19560700"," That magnet to 430 is there. "
"19560700","19564620"," Again, nobody wants to talk about it."
"19564720","19566200"," Everybody loves talking about JPM."
"19566440","19566840"," We're going to crash. "
"19567520","19574180"," No one likes talking about JPM caller at 430 for the end of the quarter."
"19574980","19576240"," 150 points up."
"19579280","19582920"," We know we're near the magnet to 3600 yet. "
"19583120","19590040"," We need to get some legs down to make 3600 a magnet."
"19590040","19596420"," I do know one thing."
"19597200","19599120"," If we were to trade to 430. "
"19601620","19607440"," The hedge in the market would force us down towards 3600."
"19609840","19612480"," The market would not like to go above that number."
"19612660","19613140"," I know that. "
"19614180","19618180"," I also know that I'm willing to take my winnings at 420."
"19620260","19622160"," And say, yeah, we don't get 430."
"19623680","19628940"," So if you're a bear out there calling for 360, you should be making that same statement. "
"19629980","19632940"," Yeah, we might just go to 378, not 360."
"19636160","19638200"," Instead of constant doom and gloom."
"19640200","19641220"," We just erased. "
"19641880","19642280"," Are you ready?"
"19644380","19651120"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten."
"19652680","19655380"," Almost 11 and 12 sessions."
"19657140","19657960"," To the upside. "
"19659440","19660480"," That's the fact."
"19670820","19673680"," We've been going on for this for two or three weeks."
"19674360","19676480"," I remember we were back here and I said to you. "
"19678180","19679380"," I'm going to say it again."
"19680100","19683180"," Ratio spreads in case the trade goes against you."
"19695270","19696290"," High probability. "
"19696650","19699150"," If we trade 430, you're safe."
"19700890","19703050"," If we trade 380, you made money."
"19704550","19706890"," If we trade 360, you're a rock star. "
"19708370","19711690"," Notice in all three of those trades, you won."
"19780890","19782150"," Expectation into tomorrow."
"19789910","19792290"," Oh, a park is somewhere in here. "
"19794090","19795290"," That's my expectation."
"19795690","19796030"," It's tomorrow."
"19796330","19801750"," It's possible we can hit this 415 or this 410 somewhere down in here, but it's somewhere in here"
"19801750","19803030"," for tomorrow for OPEC's. "
"19809070","19814090"," You're going to hear bears tell you, as they're already set on Monday in my rant."
"19817890","19819630"," The unclench is on Monday."
"19819770","19820370"," It's on Tuesday. "
"19820710","19821210"," It's on Wednesday."
"19821430","19822070"," It's on Thursday."
"19822370","19823070"," It's on Friday. "
"19823550","19824070"," It's coming."
"19824270","19824590"," It's coming."
"19825550","19826550"," It's still open to that. "
"19827270","19828270"," It's a great place up there."
"19828390","19830550"," Four fifteen eighty six."
"19831350","19832250"," What's your market edge on?"
"19833810","19835610"," You have another opportunity for it. "
"19847630","19848510"," Day traders."
"19850770","19852990"," I personally would not be trading tomorrow."
"19855910","19857110"," There's a couple things here. "
"19857250","19858490"," You're going to see two things tomorrow."
"19858730","19861190"," You're going to see two things happen."
"19863570","19865510"," You'll see it again on the 30th. "
"19869070","19871030"," You're going to see hedging flows."
"19874810","19880950"," The companies that do the institutions that do this, they're going to put their hedges on and"
"19880950","19885310"," they're going to trade zero dates against them."
"19886710","19889750"," If they have hedging flows to the upside, we could go down into the bell. "
"19891670","19894450"," If they have hedging flows to the upside, we're weak over that."
"19895810","19900150"," You'll see as an institution place a trade not to disrupt the market, but then you'll find in the"
"19900150","19904470"," morning, you'll find it leaking all over social media."
"19904730","19907870"," You'll get a bunch of people take these same trades but not hedge the flow. "
"19909010","19910410"," You get weakness into that."
"19912270","19918110"," What's really fascinating is a lot of these institutions to not disrupt the market, we'll put zero"
"19918110","19918990"," date calls on."
"19920170","19923810"," It's like end of the day, you'll get a face ripper. "
"19928060","19929340"," It's like two for one."
"19929660","19933800"," Here's all my bearish flow and I bought a bunch of calls, zero dates."
"19934120","19935240"," I'm going to be looking for those tomorrow. "
"19935420","19939400"," We might not get them, but if we get them, I'm like, oh, yeah, these institutions are out there"
"19939400","19939780"," tomorrow."
"19942560","19947500"," They don't disrupt the market, but then they get paid for the service of putting this shit on for"
"19947500","19950160"," like a day and like last 10 minutes of the day."
"19953240","19954960"," It's expectation tomorrow. "
"19955240","19956200"," Come on down here."
"19956360","19957280"," Come on down here."
"19957500","19959020"," Maybe we pin that for 10. "
"19961460","19961940"," Maybe."
"19962800","19966280"," And then move into the close."
"19976130","19977030"," That's your Thursday. "
"19981270","19987750"," You should look back on some of these May, April or May, June, not February."
"19989570","19992130"," May, June's in previous years."
"19992690","19995550"," We know that last year it sucked and anomaly. "
"19996350","20002130"," We know previous years on average, we've actually melted up into like June 2nd."
"20002590","20003970"," And then we have a hard roll."
"20004430","20005430"," Solid may go away. "
"20008370","20010410"," I'm a believer in solid may go away."
"20010930","20012210"," When it happens, I don't know."
"20012550","20015250"," We have monthly flows coming in right now as well into the market. "
"20017790","20019210"," People want to put money to work."
"20020070","20021910"," You had Brian Watts this morning."
"20022690","20024790"," I feel bad people in 401ks. "
"20025310","20026870"," I know there's people out there that have been sidelined."
"20027710","20028750"," Put some money to work."
"20029130","20031250"," You and I are different than a lot of these people, right?"
"20031490","20032990"," Brian Watts is different than a lot of these people. "
"20033290","20034070"," People don't know."
"20039670","20040810"," Sitting on the sidelines."
"20057240","20057860"," Oh, shit. "
"20058000","20058860"," I have the wrong time frame."
"20059000","20059620"," It's always the five."
"20061300","20062320"," Right down here. "
"20063740","20064820"," That one just goes away."
"20074530","20080290"," The bear cross right now on the 6 CMA and the 27 EMA."
"20080410","20083490"," We'll see if the bears can follow through with this to the downside. "
"20085730","20087370"," I'm going to remove this right now."
"20087410","20091530"," You can come back into this broadcast and snip this stuff for yourself."
"20094670","20096550"," Time right now is three o'clock. "
"20096570","20100050"," You can come back into this broadcast and just snip what I think about tomorrow."
"20122120","20123420"," Not financial advice."
"20123940","20124720"," This is what I think. "
"20124980","20125640"," Not what you think."
"20126320","20135230"," You take what I say and you mix it with your stuff and you put your money to work."
"20136230","20138690"," Nice little bounce right now on the spy. "
"20142410","20144330"," So I'm thinking we go down into tomorrow."
"20144690","20146130"," Let me know in the chat what you think."
"20146410","20148650"," If you're anti that trade, if you're like, yeah, we're going to go up tomorrow. "

"20155220","20156840"," You think we pin into the clothes?"
"20159320","20161560"," Yeah, I can see pin to fit for 15."
"20161560","20162260"," Is that what you're thinking?"
"20162260","20163280"," We pin for 15."
"20163280","20168320"," And that's the number of the spreads possibly not into that trade either. "
"20168440","20169080"," I'm for that."
"20169260","20170320"," Let me know in the chat what you think."
"20178440","20181720"," They just park this shit like they park for 15 for tomorrow. "
"20182480","20184200"," Can you imagine that they park right here?"
"20186300","20187240"," We don't go up."
"20187360","20187980"," We don't go down."
"20188240","20193820"," You know that hedge funds like nice round numbers, right?"
"20194000","20197080"," They're like four 15, four 10, 400, 420. "
"20197620","20199180"," They love that nice round number."
"20200380","20202400"," And four 15 is a nice round number."
"20209680","20210540"," Let me know in the chat. "
"20210680","20211500"," I'll read the chat right now."

"20215160","20216820"," Yeah, you're saying 412 out of day."
"20227120","20228360"," You're my dog's great man. "
"20228500","20228940"," Love a dog."
"20229840","20231940"," He hasn't come in to say hi though today, has he?"
"20233200","20234980"," I got a little I got a bourbon here by the way."
"20235060","20240480"," So just to admit, I haven't had a liquor drink in probably two months. "
"20240560","20242920"," I had one last night and I just made myself one."
"20243120","20244520"," So Binky chairs to you."
"20245540","20246540"," Happy OPEC's everybody. "
"20248060","20248680"," Bull bear."
"20248840","20249200"," I don't care."
"20249600","20250360"," Happy OPEC's. "
"20250540","20252620"," We're at the end of the OPEC cycle for the month."
"20253120","20255060"," We're two thirds of the way through the corner."
"20255340","20258020"," We have one more month left for OPEC's. "
"20259680","20263560"," Hopefully we can go back to trading the market up or down once OPEC's is over."
"20264300","20267460"," We still have some shit to go through for the end of the month."
"20268340","20269200"," Window dressing. "
"20278540","20280220"," So our chairs to all of you out there."
"20280300","20281080"," We made it through another month."
"20281180","20282280"," You're still alive with me. "
"20288770","20298450"," I didn't see the poll that was released."
"20299910","20303430"," Some of you guys think we're going to four twenty for the for OPEC's."
"20309580","20311060"," That'd be crazy, wouldn't it?"
"20311960","20315660"," Just squeeze some faces off to OPEC's boom four twenty. "
"20322750","20324730"," 50 points straight up into tomorrow."
"20335820","20338180"," Boy, that would piss some people off, wouldn't it?"
"20342060","20346280"," Like four twenty for OPEC's and then four thirty for end of month dressing."
"20346660","20356840"," Well, that would"
"20356840","20358940"," grind some gears. "
"20367650","20368390"," Yeah, Winky."
"20368590","20370850"," Our polls are pretty good, man."
"20370970","20371870"," I got to give it to the polling. "
"20374110","20375950"," I've been saying this for months now."
"20376270","20379490"," Our traders, man, they take that shit seriously."
"20380810","20386630"," We used to beg, we never had bad polls, but I used to beg of them to be like, please,"
"20386630","20387030"," please. "
"20387770","20389930"," Give me your like, trader hat."
"20390150","20391090"," Not your emotions hat."
"20391230","20392030"," Not your position hat. "
"20392750","20394130"," Like, what do you think we're going to do?"
"20394330","20395470"," They hit, they nail it, dude."
"20395750","20396270"," They nail it."
"20397050","20398810"," Yesterday we said four ten tomorrow. "
"20399410","20400270"," We hit it in the close."
"20401710","20403150"," Nobody was buying that four oh four."
"20404450","20404850"," Nobody. "
"20405250","20406950"," Well, there was some people, but not, you know."
"20409230","20413910"," I think the fact that our general audience is like, we know we're going."
"20420230","20423590"," Yeah, I think we got a, Winky, we got a poll right now, don't we?"
"20424590","20426590"," Henry Cheng was asking if we had a poll on YouTube. "
"20428450","20429950"," You guys think we hit four twenty?"
"20431850","20433190"," That'd be wild, wouldn't it?"
"20433750","20436410"," Just nail four twenty for, uh, for OPEC's."
"20441190","20442470"," Who are the results of the poll?"
"20442650","20443170"," I didn't see it."
"20448720","20449420"," Okay, wait a minute. "
"20449580","20450140"," Do we close?"
"20452560","20453900"," So what do you guys, what are the options?"
"20457860","20463700"," Today when we close, um, let me look and see what I think we do."
"20466900","20468580"," I didn't give you what my thoughts are."
"20468860","20472840"," I gave you what I, I gave you the, I gave you the market idea here. "
"20473460","20475420"," I gave you the responsible answer."
"20483870","20486090"," Let me look and see what I think is going to happen."
"20487770","20489010"," You want to know the truth?"
"20491150","20492050"," Four twenty. "
"20493210","20493770"," Tomorrow."
"20496750","20498410"," I'm sticking with my answer."
"20500090","20503650"," Four twenty tomorrow, four thirty out in the thirtieth or whatever it is. "
"20505070","20506130"," Maybe the second."
"20506210","20508250"," It could take into the beginning of the second or something."
"20509050","20510350"," Four twenty four thirty. "
"20510490","20511370"," I'm sticking with my guns."
"20513290","20514810"," We'll see how this plays out."
"20514930","20517050"," If I'm wrong, I'll, you know what?"
"20517130","20518290"," I'll make a post on Fintuit. "
"20518830","20521350"," If I'm wrong, I'll admit to it."
"20522030","20524430"," You got to wait till like June second or something somewhere in there."
"20532160","20533040"," So there you go. "
"20533160","20534040"," You got Captain Jim James."
"20535100","20536580"," You guys already know my thesis."
"20537960","20540080"," I've been talking about that shit for too long now. "
"20545620","20547700"," So we'll leave it to like June second."
"20548700","20552800"," If you guys don't know my thesis, you're just joining us in the stream."
"20555400","20556760"," We tag for thirty. "
"20557220","20562720"," I don't know if it takes like OPEC's or if it takes, um, and a month or like just the"
"20562720","20563180"," week after."
"20564280","20566060"," I will accept four twenty."
"20571560","20574540"," I've been saying that shit now for a quarter or something. "
"20575520","20577040"," I think it was when JPM came out."
"20577120","20578160"," I was like fucking four thirty."
"20578280","20578780"," We're going there. "
"20583360","20584320"," We haven't."
"20584400","20584800"," We've been teased."
"20585760","20587080"," We've definitely been close. "
"20588340","20589860"," I think twice now we've been close."
"20591460","20592920"," We have the quarter to do it."
"20593100","20593600"," So I'll give it. "
"20593760","20595280"," We have a quarter to do it."
"20601810","20602610"," Four thirty."
"20606600","20612200"," And you know, if you all said that today was, uh, uh, Mr. Yen said that too. "
"20612200","20616740"," And I was like, I was like, oh, yeah, he's on the same fucking page that I am."
"20617020","20619300"," And then, and then he said the same thing that I was thinking."
"20619540","20621300"," I was thinking actually two things. "
"20622620","20627660"," Like the first one that I'm thinking is short the fuck out of four thirty or forty three hundred."
"20628280","20630220"," Like short the fuck out of it."
"20630220","20635420"," Just, I don't care if it's at like four a.m. six a.m. fucking two o'clock in the"
"20635420","20635700"," morning. "
"20636460","20639680"," Whenever that shit comes full fucking cell."
"20639920","20640040"," Sorry."
"20640180","20640500"," I should be swearing. "
"20640960","20642280"," Just like full fucking cell."
"20643360","20646340"," The other thing that I was thinking was, uh, I'm like."
"20647800","20652080"," You know, if we're like if we're close to four fifteen four twenty four ten. "
"20652600","20655440"," Yeah, maybe we do pull back so we can get that."
"20655700","20657560"," Like you need a reason to go there, right?"
"20657560","20661620"," Like, oh, we're going to go to the fifty points to hit four thirty and we're kind of like dragging"
"20661620","20662520"," ass trading sideways."
"20662520","20664280"," I'm like, yeah, it's not going to do it. "
"20666100","20668900"," It's always better to make like a hundred fifty point run to get there."
"20668900","20670340"," Like some fucking three day."
"20670340","20671900"," Just face ripper to get there. "
"20672360","20675080"," Just we went up one day two days three days."
"20675560","20677020"," That's what this is setting up to be."
"20677540","20677940"," So. "
"20679720","20681440"," And I just relentless buying."
"20681860","20685560"," Just like by, by, by, by, by, by."
"20685560","20686780"," I see that too. "
"20690340","20692900"," Just straight melts up and you can't even chase it."
"20692980","20695480"," You're just like, I don't know what you're doing up there while you're chasing that."
"20695740","20695960"," Do risky. "
"20696840","20697400"," That kind of shit."
"20702490","20706210"," But I'll accept four twenty forty two hundred on SP."
"20706390","20707530"," This is SPX, by the way. "
"20708130","20709470"," You want to know the targets that I have?"
"20709830","20710290"," It's not spy."
"20711150","20711690"," It's not a yes."
"20711950","20712930"," It's SPX. "
"20725610","20727150"," The dream is still alive."
"20727370","20727510"," So."
"20728910","20730690"," I do agree if we fail trend. "
"20731570","20734170"," If we fail the actual trend, we're fucked."
"20734870","20738450"," Remember the last window of weakness we had when we were promised market crash?"
"20739130","20739870"," Was that a few weeks ago?"
"20741130","20742330"," We didn't get it, did we?"
"20744050","20745350"," Was that a few weeks ago, right?"
"20745490","20747390"," We got the, we got the doom and gloom."
"20747450","20751970"," We're like, we're told a moment of weakness, window of, window of weakness. "
"20751970","20753650"," And we're going to crash."
"20754110","20756050"," All it was was a perfect time to buy the dip."
"20756070","20758550"," We traded for three straight days straight up, right?"
"20758890","20763390"," They called Joe Donut that morning and I'm like, I was like, we're getting a fucking trend day"
"20763390","20764730"," today and it's going to rip your face off. "
"20765470","20766970"," Winky was like, how do you know this?"
"20767330","20769290"," And I'm like, I'll keep telling you every time we have one."
"20771790","20774970"," Before it happens, I'll call you on the phone and text you."
"20783010","20789100"," And it wasn't a week, window of weakness. "
"20789380","20792340"," It was just another opportunity to buy the fucking dip for face repper."
"20794340","20799500"," So like that 430 man, that 4,300 Jamie diamond, they parked that shit."
"20799680","20803120"," They're like, like pin strike. "
"20804180","20804620"," Ding."
"20808260","20813140"," I've seen them park that shit so many times of those three numbers, they park one of them."
"20814300","20819760"," Like they backed the truck up and they're like, right at four p.m. They're like, we told you we'd"
"20819760","20820200"," be here. "
"20825580","20830900"," Like, like four p.m. That was like, you know, like we're at the, we're at the one month of"
"20830900","20834240"," the quarterly OPEC's throughout the two month and we're at the three month and here we go."
"20837850","20839210"," They don't always do it."
"20839310","20844290"," There was a, there was a quarter, a couple of years ago where they missed it pretty big. "
"20846470","20848190"," I can't say it's every time."
"20848970","20854640"," I know people say that it's every time it's not."
"20854920","20859620"," I've been tracking it for a few years now, but at least three or four years. "
"20864920","20866820"," God, I'm getting fucking old man."
"20872390","20876370"," Fucking, everything I think is like, oh, yeah, last year I started tracking them like now's years"
"20876370","20876750"," ago."
"20876870","20879210"," And that time too. "
"20880230","20882390"," Like, yeah, I remember that article that came out."
"20882870","20884250"," I remember it was on Twitter too."
"20884830","20886170"," I remember it blew up on Twitter. "
"20886510","20887250"," I was like, shit."
"20887970","20888830"," Oh, man."
"20917180","20918920"," Yeah, I see that Omar too, man. "
"20920880","20922340"," So you guys have my take."
"20924240","20925740"," You have my responsible."
"20927460","20929040"," Sub seller take or whatever. "
"20929280","20930480"," I guess I don't want to."
"20930560","20933100"," I was going to say I was going to try to relate it to somebody else."
"20934100","20936640"," Someone, someone that said sell subs, but I'm not going to. "
"20950010","20953270"," Do we get three days of relentless buying up in a Friday?"
"20960840","20964840"," I don't think so."
"20966340","20969020"," I think you're getting by.exe is what you're getting."
"20979850","20981630"," I've been thinking that for weeks now. "
"20982510","20993140"," You're getting by.exe. I'm"
"20993140","20993440"," not old."
"20993620","20994000"," I'm conditioned."
"20997540","20998380"," Yeah, that's true. "
"20998580","20998900"," Hot chase."
"20999100","20999540"," You lose enough."
"20999680","21001060"," You're like, yeah, we're definitely going there. "
"21002680","21004040"," Dude, this day I'll never."
"21004200","21008100"," I'll never forget like I'll never forget those puts I bought, man."
"21008840","21011420"," And I was like, this shit is going to the depths of hell. "
"21011420","21016460"," And dude, I fucking, it went to zero, like literal zero."
"21017440","21019540"," I was so fucking bullhead."
"21019660","21021520"," Not bullheaded like a bull like I was bullheaded. "
"21021700","21022400"," They were going down."
"21022720","21023680"," It sucked balls."
"21025780","21029080"," They fucking ramped spy and they just didn't stop. "
"21032350","21035250"," I followed every single fucking bear off the cliff."
"21036630","21039890"," I was so I can't stop swearing."
"21044750","21046690"," They rammed it right up my bung hole. "
"21047050","21048630"," It wasn't even dry."
"21048970","21051730"," It was just like sandpaper and dirt and rocks."
"21051990","21053630"," And I was like, never again do that. "
"21056190","21057570"," For as long as I live."
"21059790","21060990"," I learned my lesson."
"21061790","21062970"," One time it took. "
"21078930","21081370"," Me and every other dip shit on on fence."
"21081890","21082970"," It was horrible."
"21084530","21085390"," It was horrible. "
"21089070","21091330"," It took my money and they went out on."
"21091470","21093370"," They went out in New York and they just parted with it."
"21093570","21094590"," They were just like, whoo. "
"21095610","21097130"," It's pisses money away."
"21110780","21113140"," Mr. Wet Yann had a 25 ring trade today."
"21113380","21115000"," Yeah, I don't doubt that the guy's a gangster. "
"21115880","21116840"," Straight gangster."
"21117200","21119340"," I'll always have something to learn from him."
"21120680","21124940"," Dude, I would shut my stream down and go sit next to him in his house. "
"21125660","21127360"," And just trade with him next to him."
"21127500","21128420"," Like guys a gangster."
"21130240","21132760"," It was like times where he's caught shit. "
"21134960","21136000"," From people, right?"
"21136240","21137680"," And I want you to know something about Mr. Yann."
"21137720","21139260"," I want to understand something about Mr. Yann."
"21139380","21142580"," Because I didn't want to discuss it when he was here earlier today. "
"21142700","21143760"," But I want to say something to you guys."
"21146140","21148860"," He sometimes can carry."
"21152860","21154280"," He angers people, right?"
"21154380","21155100"," He knows people's buttons. "
"21155480","21156220"," It's the best way to put it."
"21156760","21157920"," He knows people's buttons, right?"
"21158040","21160020"," He pisses a lot of people off because he knows their buttons."
"21160520","21166220"," But I want you to know that at the same time that he pisses people off because he's right a"
"21166220","21166440"," lot. "
"21169020","21170180"," He's mostly right."
"21171520","21172620"," So when he's wrong."
"21175100","21176400"," People want to shit on him. "
"21176480","21180700"," They're like, oh, look, he was wrong in laugh at him because he's not wrong that often."
"21180700","21182740"," And so when he is, like he sucks."
"21183080","21189660"," Another thing too is Mr. Yann kind of pisses on the idea of being a sub seller. "
"21189660","21196160"," Mr. Yann for how, what he does in general, but then secondly, he live trades with people."
"21196680","21198800"," He shows you the real life of being a trader."
"21199720","21202600"," He shows you his inside personal life, that kind of stuff. "
"21203460","21206100"," And, you know, like a furu doesn't want to do that."
"21206320","21213960"," Like a furu wants to show you a Lamborghini or a fucking boat or a jet or nice clothes or"
"21213960","21214940"," jewelry."
"21215600","21218480"," Whether it's rented, real, not doesn't even if it is real. "
"21219400","21221120"," You know, like they want to portray an image to you."
"21221800","21225500"," There's always an image, always an image."
"21226240","21227980"," And you have to maintain it and uphold it. "
"21229440","21231560"," To be that person, he doesn't do that."
"21231800","21234960"," And so, you know, he takes money away from people."
"21239130","21241110"," And you know, like he's wrong, been wrong. "
"21241430","21241790"," I've been wrong."
"21242190","21242550"," Everybody's been wrong."
"21242770","21244150"," I'm not even nearly as good as him. "
"21244690","21245730"," Not even a candle."
"21247350","21251930"," But you know, he doesn't candy coat those things for you."
"21252190","21253870"," And that's like, that's a key thing, man. "
"21254590","21255970"," It's a hard thing to find."
"21258390","21262890"," But not too many people out there, they're like putting their..."
"21262890","21264170"," I'll be honest with you."
"21265070","21267470"," I'll be like between you and I, honest. "
"21269990","21272630"," It's not easy to be like, hey, I'm going to take this trade."
"21272850","21273710"," I'm going to take that trade."
"21273950","21276050"," I'm going to show people what I'm doing. "
"21277590","21279530"," That's not an easy thing to do."
"21280750","21282830"," Because, you know, when you're wrong, it sucks."
"21283210","21284350"," It doesn't feel good when you're wrong. "
"21284350","21285990"," And then you're losing money when it's wrong."
"21286270","21289150"," And you see me get angry in this stream when I'm getting torched."
"21289690","21290530"," It's not fun. "
"21290830","21292550"," And I'm doing it like live with you guys."
"21294470","21296670"," So, like I have a guy like Mr. Yen doing that."
"21297050","21300410"," I got all the fucking respect in the world for him. "
"21302550","21302950"," 100%."
"21304830","21308590"," You know, if you didn't have a Mr. Yen out there, what would you have?"
"21309410","21310370"," You'd have nothing, right?"
"21311370","21313170"," There's a few guys out there doing options."
"21313170","21314590"," Millionaires out there doing it. "
"21315950","21316970"," Who else is doing it?"
"21317010","21317510"," Options, millions."
"21317730","21318870"," A few guys out there that do it."
"21319430","21321370"," There's a couple guys at nighttime that trade futures. "
"21322250","21324210"," Some guy named Jim or Joe or something."
"21325710","21330970"," I forget his name, but..."
"21331950","21334750"," These guys put their money in the line and they're trading with you."
"21335130","21337030"," So, if they're winners, they lose. "
"21337210","21338030"," I don't care like these guys."
"21338430","21341610"," I got nothing bad to say about these people."
"21349330","21353830"," Like in our day and age to have that, can you imagine like pre-internet?"
"21355090","21359990"," Like you know there are traders out there that are better than you or have been trading for 10"
"21359990","21361150"," years or five years. "
"21361670","21363130"," And you're like, I mean, one year trader."
"21363450","21369870"," And there's like a three year trader or a 15 year trader, 20 year trader trader, prop trader,"
"21370130","21370950"," professional trader."
"21371750","21378290"," Like you got Mero comes in here, spends time with us, like dropping just knowledge on us in here. "
"21383840","21387340"," And people are like, oh, he was wrong the other day, or this guy was wrong the other day."
"21387460","21389360"," Like, I have mad respect for these people."
"21391240","21391600"," 100%. "
"21391600","21395740"," And they got your button, right?"
"21396200","21397240"," So they pissed you off."
"21397620","21399540"," I know there's people in the stream and incognita right now."
"21400300","21401120"," And I know there are. "
"21401480","21402760"," People are incognita watching the stream."
"21403060","21403340"," I guarantee."
"21404760","21405980"," Like I hate that fucking guy. "
"21406800","21408180"," I hate Kevin's room, James."
"21409300","21409820"," But you know they're here."
"21410000","21410800"," They're watching in the background. "
"21413140","21414680"," And that's who they are, just people."
"21419250","21420450"," But they watch every day."
"21420710","21421690"," They want to know what's going on. "
"21421810","21423270"," They want someone next to them while they're trading."
"21424590","21429190"," You know, if those people weren't there for you or for me, if I wasn't streaming, I'd have one of"
"21429190","21429570"," them on it."
"21429670","21437070"," I'd have options millionaire on or I'd have Mr. Yen on or if he had the guy's name, Mike at"
"21437070","21439750"," nighttime, they'd have these people on the background. "
"21440610","21442470"," They used to be a guy on a thicker swim."
"21443150","21445070"," I don't know if he's still on anymore, but he's awesome."
"21445250","21448490"," The guy that does the voice program plays like the disco in the middle of the morning. "
"21448630","21449870"," He's done for like three or four hours."
"21450450","21451330"," I don't know his name is."
"21451390","21452110"," He was awesome. "
"21452270","21452990"," I'd have him on the background."
"21455070","21456430"," I'd better him than CNBC."
"21464140","21465280"," Now those guys weren't there. "
"21465400","21466500"," It would suck to be a trader today."
"21466620","21467940"," You guys have a good gift, dude."
"21468140","21469140"," Like it's the internet. "
"21469700","21470700"," It's the age of the internet."
"21474740","21476380"," Get to hang out with somebody else and trade."
"21476380","21477460"," Lose your money together. "
"21482900","21483660"," Yeah, Mike Schwartz."
"21483960","21484380"," That's his name."
"21484520","21484900"," That's that guy. "
"21485040","21485540"," Mike Schwartz."
"21485860","21486540"," I used to follow him."
"21486820","21487360"," I used to trade. "
"21487520","21492380"," I used to trade futures and on a regular and I'd put him on if he was on."
"21495460","21496220"," Yeah, Mike Schwartz."
"21501170","21502570"," Yeah, he goes on every night, right?"
"21504110","21505970"," I don't know if he does anymore or not. "
"21506110","21507150"," Is he still trading at nighttime?"
"21509130","21510070"," Thanks to watch him."
"21512170","21513370"," Have a voice in the background."
"21513630","21514070"," I was just trading. "
"21538540","21540820"," Oh, look at these bears getting salty."
"21542000","21544840"," Bears like there's a big old bull trap in here."
"21545740","21549340"," I'm going to trap these bulls down here and get it down to 410. "
"21551680","21552480"," I'm over here."
"21552740","21553740"," Give me a dip to buy."
"21557570","21559230"," You can dip down here, baby. "
"21564150","21565550"," Bears looking at that book map."
"21565790","21566850"," They're like pulled the rug."
"21573290","21574510"," Yeah, how do I vote on this?"
"21574990","21575430"," Ready?"

"21650040","21651300"," Should we go to the one minute here?"
"21652540","21653200"," Let's make it spicy."
"21654800","21656400"," You don't put it on the one minute anymore. "
"21656760","21657200"," Ooh."
