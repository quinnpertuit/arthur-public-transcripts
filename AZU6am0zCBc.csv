"67560","69220"," Get right into it this morning."
"71430","72210"," Check one, too."
"74730","84010"," You guys already showing up here that early, huh?"
"84930","85790"," My god. "
"86590","88790"," Go live chat here."
"96270","97590"," Good morning, winky."
"97850","99870"," Good morning, specifically to you. "
"100810","101830"," Good morning, indices."
"102070","103530"," We trust Fama Blanca."
"103670","104870"," Winky, I got something for you this morning. "
"105710","107030"," Morning Otis, Dean."
"111150","112990"," Good morning, Fama again, Michael."
"113110","119490"," We have got the 2018 process being in fact, my for December 2022 full report on the new seed for"
"119490","120270"," those of you that are interested. "
"120810","121530"," Tesla's now a beat."
"122810","124510"," Yeah, I don't think it was a beat, was it?"
"126170","127130"," No, it was a beat at all."
"136130","137190"," Okay, let me see what I got here. "
"160010","164630"," Let me bring up some things for you this morning."
"164630","174410"," Again, probably be one of our"
"174410","175570"," things that we talked about."
"175930","178090"," Okay, let's just get the day started here real quick. "
"178210","180890"," We're going to just do a quick market overview and then I'll bring up."
"182710","184510"," I'll bring up book map here in just a moment."
"196070","198170"," So, here's your five minute EMA, right?"
"198350","203730"," We are currently below the, I think this is the twenty seven EMA right now, whether you're on the"
"203730","205290"," twenty seven or twenty one, it doesn't really matter. "
"205290","208790"," Just notice that we are currently below the twenty one EMA."
"209630","213850"," If you want to pick up a position, you want to wait for us to trade higher than the twenty"
"213850","214650"," one EMA, right?"
"214810","220950"," If this is it right here, you'll be looking for us to get above it to take a long position."
"222910","224090"," We are going to look up. "
"224330","226350"," I'm going to leave this going to lead off into something else."
"229210","231370"," I'm going to one hour, we're still quite bullish."
"231590","233510"," We're actually going to have a nice bullish crossover here. "
"234270","238550"," So, we're going to look at this crude down by two dollars and mute this for a minute."
"238950","244150"," If you're looking for a nice dip to buy this morning, there should be something coming up here in a"
"244150","244470"," moment."
"244810","248990"," And this is all leading, believe it or not, this conversation into something on a much larger time"
"248990","249250"," frame. "
"249890","255930"," So, this blue line right here, you should see this pick back up and a dip be able to be"
"255930","256130"," bought."
"256370","258290"," Currently, it sits at three to two eighty seven."
"258930","264450"," So, just looking at a higher time frame, you have below here at three to eighty seven. "
"264790","267270"," We're still slightly under on the five minute."
"268530","272210"," You want to see this five minute get pick back up here for trade higher."
"273610","282910"," And this is going to lead into the title card in this video this morning, which is some predictive"
"282910","285850"," stuff for 2023. "
"287130","288950"," So, we'll take a look at that as well this morning."
"289150","291730"," So, just so you can see this here, we are bullish here."
"291930","294110"," We have some price targets above this morning. "
"294110","299270"," You know that the pivot is down below here at thirty one, three to one thirteen."
"299930","303010"," And then we've got a nice giant gap above here to three eighty eight."
"304810","307650"," We'll talk about Tesla at some point this morning as well. "
"308490","315710"," And we're just testing my tie into the algorithical phase that we're going to talk about here in"
"315710","316290"," just a few moments."
"316510","317090"," Just give me a minute here."
"317130","319670"," I'm going to turn on the book map for you now. "
"319670","321210"," So, you have a look at that."
"345780","347840"," And you see that big fat target up high."
"349220","351100"," It's thirty nine thirty on ES. "
"361440","367440"," Around the news this morning, Blueburg is saying that US recession is pretty likely ex New York Fed"
"367440","376400"," Chief Dudley says US stock laggards are twenty twenty two set to jump in first New Year's session."
"376400","383160"," We're not seeing that this morning from Tesla, which is what the question I posed last week was"
"383160","385780"," would the delivery numbers really matter that much."
"386620","391180"," And it seems like that they do today, or at least this morning it seems like they do. "
"391980","395440"," US auto sales expected to find inflation woes and other headline."
"395720","400380"," They had a headline futures climb with stocks on China recovery bets, markets wrap."

"435420","439040"," Zombie cut zombie companies hookups hookup to survive the startup winter. "
"439180","441080"," I'll take a look at that maybe later this morning."
"443620","444640"," Maybe we'll read that one."
"449540","452760"," There was an interesting article that I found last yesterday. "
"452960","460560"," I think that talked about the work from home crowd and how they're staying work from home."
"460560","462180"," So we can find that today."
"462180","465900"," I'll bring that up for a minute and commercial real estate. "
"467080","469680"," The impact that's had on the price of commercial real estate."
"469680","475360"," If they should, if they should switch over to residential real estate, it might be interesting to"
"475360","475760"," look at."
"478160","479920"," I think that's all I've got so far. "
"483080","488860"," Then we've got the, we've got construction spending at 10 a.m. Other than usual oil numbers,"
"489440","490860"," European closed stuff like that."
"490940","492000"," We don't have anything until tomorrow."

"525570","526430"," Give me a second."
"526570","527470"," I'm going to bring something up."
"527590","530170"," This is when I'll get Brody McBoatface here. "
"531750","535630"," And it's interesting because I've shown some of Brody McBoatface out there."
"539130","540930"," He does a really good job."
"546420","547580"," How do I word this?"
"552100","561600"," He does a really good job with pivots, stochastics, some Fibonacci numbers, moving averages,"
"562360","566360"," HLC, RSI, high lows, pivots, that kind of stuff. "
"567080","568920"," He doesn't do as well."
"572860","575120"," He doesn't do as well with distribution."
"575840","578800"," He doesn't do as well with Fibonacci lows. "
"579240","582980"," He does great with consolidation, but not as great with distribution."
"583700","587500"," When certain values are broken, he doesn't go down any farther."
"587760","589320"," He's just like, okay, we're going to consolidate here. "
"590040","592320"," So he doesn't work that well yet."
"592540","598520"," But I want to show you this this morning because it's a great example of how it does work well."
"602580","610740"," How it works really well, but how I haven't had to put triggers in for when certain values are"
"610740","613980"," broken, which I can do and I haven't done yet. "
"613980","620680"," So we're going to take a look at that today and bring some jams up for you this morning."
"620820","621620"," Give me just a second here."
"722510","724010"," Thank you. "
"752430","754050"," Thank you."
"782430","784050"," Thank you."
"798650","799690"," Okay. "
"801830","808990"," Breaking higher now on your five minute."
"822530","825790"," Previous side, three, two, three, six, eighty two."
"854550","866470"," I'm going to move over to you. "
"872830","882650"," So the count raises the drop versus the dollar to trade around $1.20. On Friday, I told you guys"
"882650","884530"," I wanted to wait until end"
"884530","908450"," of"
"908450","908450"," day."
"917710","919710"," 3060 P."
"923210","925430"," So here is."
"925430","930210"," Here's the 31st right here right"
"930210","937890"," there. "
"940010","947270"," We're going to put a March 31st right there so you can see it."
"948830","950030"," 10 seconds."
"951110","958350"," Do this at home if you want. "
"959330","962430"," 46 spot two, 46 spot two as expected."
"965570","966010"," 3630."
"988000","990180"," Put that on there right there wrong 3630. "
"992580","994460"," And I also wrote magnet in there."
"995340","1000680"," This is typically when they tell you that when they tell you or whatever the GPM car is going to"
"1000680","1003380"," close out at the end of a quarter."
"1003700","1006460"," It's where you where the magnet should be where we should trade to. "
"1024060","1024760"," Okay."
"1027140","1030200"," This is this blue line here is the algorithm."
"1031619","1037099"," We have also posted out the US S&P manufacturing PMI December final report on the news feed for"
"1037099","1038099"," those of you that are interested. "
"1038619","1042960"," Just taking a look at the key findings output force at a sharp array to make a faster drop in"
"1042960","1043520"," new orders."
"1044060","1047720"," Inflationary pressure is notably and employment rises only fractionally."
"1048660","1052420"," You want to see I want to see this first this first move higher here. "
"1056580","1059280"," Have this move here kind of corresponds with this one."
"1059860","1064320"," And then you kind of get this one right here right you get that same move right there the same"
"1064320","1065180"," one right there."
"1065840","1068660"," And it's it's anticipating a move higher here. "
"1068800","1073700"," At the point I'm trying to make you see this move higher and then a sell down and then a"
"1073700","1077140"," move back up and kind of a sideways sideways move."
"1078120","1082180"," This algorithm is not going to be important against a senior economist."
"1082280","1089060"," The global market intelligence says the manufacturing sector posted a weak performance as 2022 was"
"1089060","1093120"," brought to a close as output and new orders contracted at sharper rates. "
"1093520","1094940"," Demand good for good."
"1095600","1099900"," Swindled wind or even as domestic orders and export sales drop."
"1102400","1106260"," Just the heads up if you guys want to put falls in a sharp array to mid faster drop in"
"1106260","1110740"," new orders inflationary prices pressure is notably employment rises only fractionally. "
"1111940","1116240"," So the key though here is you've got one bump two bumps and then a sell off."
"1116840","1122680"," And then a cup to plateau which kind of kind of the problem is this should be deeper."
"1123280","1128560"," This this algorithm should go deeper price level on this should be lower. "
"1128560","1133900"," I have to make it lower, but it does give us some kind of an idea, especially if you're looking"
"1133900","1149550"," at, especially if"
"1149550","1153010"," you're looking at what JPM is saying, right?"
"1153190","1161850"," So if you're looking at what JPM is looking for here, right, I'm going to expect at some point."
"1162750","1167370"," I'm going to expect at some point for make this a little bit."
"1170520","1173300"," So I think the scale here needs to be slightly lower. "
"1180100","1187290"," So I guess that my point to you is the rectangle up there."
"1187730","1194270"," The point that I would make to you would be you can see where we have short here at 460."
"1199970","1202390"," So we have ER season coming up. "
"1204890","1207070"," I'm going to turn this into a cell signal."
"1210230","1210750"," Here."
"1214390","1216910"," And then if we have this dip coming down here, right?"
"1217050","1218970"," This would be the bloodbath kind of a zone down here. "
"1219470","1221670"," I'm going to put that down below here."
"1237430","1242070"," And then a magnet for end of March."
"1256630","1265530"," Now you can already see that this is kind of making sense to you, right?"
"1265890","1270170"," You would expect for us to get some kind of an S&P ramp. "
"1270170","1274730"," And I'm going to show this on another, I want to show this on another ticker as well."
"1275250","1285070"," Because I wasn't expecting, I wasn't expecting the Dow Jones industrial average to do well in the"
"1285070","1285630"," beginning of the year."
"1285930","1289170"," And this algorithm is saying something different. "
"1289550","1295390"," So the point being would be, see some kind of a ramp up for ER season and then a cell"
"1295390","1295770"," down."
"1295770","1303670"," And then I come back up, maybe an overshoot and then we're back on this 36304 end of March."
"1304510","1307470"," So you can kind of, this is kind of similar. "
"1307850","1310870"," It's a little bit higher than what JPM is thinking."
"1311470","1314650"," So I have lots of work to do in the background to get this lower."
"1316850","1321770"," Maybe a bullish bearish stance that I can add in to click it on and off and see the difference. "
"1323090","1329990"," But still it's path is not too far off from what JPM is predicting."
"1330410","1334230"," And there's something else interesting here I want to show you which would be, do you want to take"
"1334230","1335090"," a screenshot of that?"
"1336430","1344910"," Well, if I was going to do, I think somewhere in here I can do an hour of some kind."
"1345790","1349610"," I don't know if it's the curve, I forget, but that's not the curve. "
"1349610","1350050"," It's the path."
"1351390","1353150"," So if I were to have a path here."
"1364780","1367100"," Oh, I just fucked this up. "
"1367160","1368100"," I got to double click it or something."
"1369420","1370100"," There we go."
"1370960","1373280"," It's my cricket path. "
"1378900","1386640"," Anyways, if you wanted to take a photo of that, like a snipper or something on your end, you can"
"1386640","1388060"," see that my eye goes higher."
"1388340","1392360"," But I think it has more to do with how it's designed and the inputs on it than this."
"1393640","1397200"," And I think this is the JPM path for what they're expecting. "
"1398800","1401560"," So you'd be looking for some kind of a way to short the market."
"1401820","1408300"," The interesting part about this, though, is I was going to express this with a DJI or a DJI a"
"1408300","1410860"," short on the market."
"1410860","1425550"," But when I applied, when I looked at the DJI, not"
"1425550","1429730"," so deep of a move lower. "
"1430910","1439150"," So if we get the sell off, it seems to be indicating that S&P 500 will get hit harder"
"1439150","1440110"," than."
"1442150","1452060"," I don't know if it's harder, but see, March 31st is right here."
"1454830","1460450"," It's saying they expect to push up in in Dow Jones, the DJI a right. "
"1461130","1465090"," But the selling shouldn't be as steep as the SPX as spy."
"1465710","1470570"," And in fact, the DJI a should explode higher into end of quarter."
"1470570","1474550"," So I'm interested to see how this how this plays out with. "
"1474710","1480810"," I thought I was going to take the short on the Dow Jones industrial average, but there is some"
"1480810","1481070"," data."
"1481310","1487650"," I'll try to find it for you that suggests that the Dow Jones industrial average should have a"
"1487650","1488250"," better year."
"1488430","1492890"," I think market watch put an article out about this and said that the Dow Jones industrial average"
"1492890","1496150"," should have a better year than the S&P 500. "
"1497490","1499150"," I was just be conscious of this."
"1500090","1501690"," I'm not putting a snapshot of that."
"1502230","1508350"," But the DJI a might not be the way to go for a short for a market short might might"
"1508350","1509110"," be SPX. "
"1510090","1511190"," And I haven't looked at."
"1512510","1517150"," Haven't looked at tech yet to see what the implications are with tech, but I will at some point"
"1517150","1518070"," later today."
"1526230","1532370"," Ruthless sell off up here. "
"1544730","1546510"," Almost to the pin strike down here."
"1550050","1554150"," This is the hourly chart on the S&P found on spy itself."
"1554730","1556570"," This is the blue line on the early trend. "
"1559210","1561330"," The break here would be very, very bearish."
"1562590","1564150"," See what you guys are saying in the chat."
"1568630","1570230"," All right, let's see what you guys are saying. "
"1570750","1572030"," Happy new year to everybody out there."
"1572030","1577570"," So they're your predictions for 2023 at least until April."
"1577930","1579170"," Let's call it April March. "
"1581770","1587490"," My anticipation for the entire year would be you want a full year's worth of what I think is going"
"1587490","1587930"," to happen."
"1588790","1596590"," I think they set up 2023 to try to get an employment up to have that last market capitulation."
"1596590","1605950"," So I think you'll see the first quarter be representative of that January, March, February, March,"
"1606150","1613130"," and then it would restart again sometime in September, October, November, and then again for end of"
"1613130","1614210"," the year of 2023. "
"1614650","1617090"," And then January, I don't think we've seen bottom yet."
"1617890","1623310"," Though there are some out there that say we have if we were to trade sideways and make attempts at"
"1623310","1626730"," the beginning beginning at the end of the year to sell the market one final time."
"1627350","1633670"," I'd be happy with a sideways down or sideways up market, but I don't think we've I guess the"
"1633670","1640090"," ultimate key here is that I don't think we've seen the bottom of market for a bull run that you"
"1640090","1644070"," can take with confidence you could possibly trade the market up for the year. "
"1644730","1649450"," If you'd like by bottoms and sell tops all the way through the year, but I don't that nothing says"
"1649450","1650530"," we've seen a bottom yet."
"1651170","1657430"," I think the trade this year is more than likely going to be in TLT more than likely going to"

"2205660","2206880"," He's a regular guy."
"2207780","2209380"," You know, I got a crazy like so."
"2210240","2215560"," You understand like the famous people that would come out to Park City and just pay homage to the"
"2215560","2216500"," guy guys. "
"2217000","2222620"," Like helped so many people, especially people that are."
"2224400","2228240"," I don't know if you want to call it stream sports, but athletes that are."
"2229020","2233320"," It's not and it wasn't just it was like the jackass crew like. "
"2234360","2237900"," You name it like people are allowed to pay homage to that guy."
"2238300","2242320"," And he kept a lot of people in his fold, right?"
"2245420","2247140"," And he was a regular guy."
"2247260","2250060"," I mean, a lot of guys, those guys have issues in their own lives. "
"2250260","2256080"," They live like they live like they show on their public side of their face, right?"
"2256420","2257540"," And Ken was never that guy."
"2258120","2260920"," He was, but he was more grounded in a lot of ways."
"2262220","2266740"," If you've ever met him or knew him, he was he had a fire behind his eyes. "
"2267140","2271020"," It's kind of a goofy looking guy, big imposing, but really like relaxed."
"2271640","2273100"," But then you'd meet him and talk to him."
"2273380","2278740"," And every question every had for you was always like piercing into the depth of your soul. "
"2280520","2285560"," And you could tell inside of behind his eyes how intelligent the guy was guy was amazing."
"2288060","2291140"," In fear, so I would be I'd be scared to meet that guy in an alleyway."
"2291180","2293780"," So at the same time, I don't know if that makes any sense to you. "
"2304100","2307580"," Yeah, I used to hang out in Brian's in Brian's live streams."
"2308400","2310760"," That was what was one of the guys that I've hung out in his life."

"2322510","2328090"," Yeah, I don't I don't think the rumors about Apple is something for the so that the negative news"
"2328090","2328930"," stories about Apple."
"2329150","2330790"," I don't think it matters if they're true or not."
"2330870","2336170"," It matters that if I was if I was trying to short Apple and I had 50 fucking billion dollars,"
"2336170","2336950"," I'd just start. "
"2337970","2340810"," Astra chirping a narrative, right?"
"2341170","2341710"," That's what I would do."
"2342390","2345670"," What's the what's what's it going to cost me a couple hundred grand?"
"2345950","2346250"," Maybe Max."
"2347310","2348310"," It'd be worth doing. "
"2348830","2354290"," You see that when whatever stocks being sold off, you'll see a narrative build on media."
"2361250","2362370"," Yeah, he's one hell of a dude."
"2362550","2365690"," He's a or what it was and what help it is. "
"2365790","2366230"," Life is awesome."
"2366510","2367090"," Kids are awesome."
"2368370","2372790"," My daughter used to go up to the warehouse and they used to race race cars, a little RC race"
"2372790","2375910"," cars together and shit like that. "
"2378700","2381040"," He's like one of the cool people in Park City."
"2381780","2382220"," Okay."
"2387480","2388260"," Let's talk about. "
"2390920","2392060"," Let's have a look around the market."
"2392220","2392700"," We think we're going."
"2394340","2397640"," So you guys already you guys saw where my prediction predict. "
"2397860","2398660"," So that's what I'm going to predict."
"2398740","2402840"," I'm going to predict just right along with what JPM is saying."
"2404720","2407060"," There'll be a slow grind up into your season. "
"2408560","2411480"," You're going to look for a dip to buy into your season."
"2412640","2414300"," And you're going to look for something to sell."
"2415060","2416120"," In the R season. "
"2417120","2421480"," Regardless of regardless of how the season works itself out."
"2423620","2426980"," I don't think that they that they sell your season."
"2438090","2440990"," You can see here that we're below the early trend. "
"2441510","2443530"," You can see the early trend moving over."
"2444970","2448790"," If I was looking for a dip to buy, I'm probably looking to see this gap get closed at some"
"2448790","2449470"," point this week."
"2450110","2452150"," It's down below at three seventy seven oh five. "
"2453690","2456490"," If you get that gap closer, they probably like to take a long into."
"2457930","2459130"," Into your season."
"2459730","2461930"," Watch some kind of a sideways trade. "
"2468790","2469510"," Go on here."
"2473130","2474090"," It's almost perfect."
"2474310","2474430"," Right. "
"2475930","2477570"," Some kind of a sell above here."
"2479750","2483150"," I guess you could kind of count that as being one of them."
"2485310","2489490"," That would have been a nice place to take on a put for March. "
"2490030","2492250"," I'd like I would accept that as acceptable."
"2493230","2494690"," If we can get anywhere up in here."
"2498420","2500860"," I'll be looking to take a take a nice market short into. "
"2502320","2503180"," End of March."
"2505760","2506660"," Right up in there."
"2507200","2509480"," If you're Polish, you're probably looking for something down below. "
"2509860","2512500"," And implied moves somewhere down here this week."
"2514080","2516200"," To take long for your season."
"2536800","2538400"," We'll leave up the five minute chart here. "
"2556650","2558550"," Rest in peace can block man."
"2558710","2559550"," Ten is a fucking man."
"2560270","2561230"," I don't know how else to say that. "
"2561390","2561770"," I don't know."
"2563150","2563870"," I didn't know."
"2565130","2565810"," Probably count. "
"2565970","2566530"," Not on one hand."
"2566690","2568070"," The park city is a lot of cool people."
"2568310","2572930"," But he was one of the cool guys that was famous and didn't care that he was famous. "
"2579410","2580170"," You take some debit."
"2580950","2582650"," Yeah, if I'd seen this above here."
"2583710","2585750"," It's not quite where I want where I want it to be. "
"2586030","2586230"," I want."
"2586910","2588030"," I really want to take that."
"2588190","2589330"," There's probably two big trades. "
"2590810","2592430"," For January February March."
"2592710","2593970"," There's a dip by for."
"2594150","2596570"," I think there's a dip by coming up here for January. "
"2597690","2598710"," For your season."
"2599210","2603570"," And then I think that there's a beautiful probably a beautiful place above to sell the market."
"2604310","2605650"," For February March. "
"2622870","2629960"," And you can see right here where they where they sold this thirty nine thirty right above."
"2632860","2634300"," You can see right where my."
"2637580","2639760"," Let me meet my camera here for a minute. "
"2646320","2647520"," You should have been able."
"2647780","2653020"," I think earlier I said to look out for this thirty nine thirty up here."
"2653080","2654300"," It looks like they sold it immediately. "
"2656100","2658460"," Now it's come right back down to clean up what's below."
"2670880","2673060"," That's that thirty seven fifty which is."
"2675080","2676160"," Somewhere down in here. "
"2676980","2680480"," So we're going to look for some kind of a hopefully we can get down in here."
"2687470","2689250"," See if we can grab a dip by down here."
"2690250","2698360"," Three seven five zero. "
"2705680","2709380"," Four six three."
"2709380","2709540"," Three."
"2755480","2755500"," Two. "
"2777930","2779550"," Took in the five minute down here."
"2813560","2817820"," Sure if I'm that saying the by for your season would that be today or do you think sometime this"
"2817820","2818340"," week or later."
"2819080","2821880"," I'd like to see this gap get filled down here. "
"2821960","2822400"," It might not."
"2822900","2825320"," There's no requirement that this gap gets filled right here."
"2825320","2826180"," Let's see my cursors are there. "
"2826840","2828420"," There's a small gap down below here."
"2828980","2833460"," I think this gap everybody wants wanted this gap to get filled for some time now."
"2834100","2836860"," So I'm not really concerned if it's today or tomorrow. "
"2838340","2840420"," But I'd like to buy a call spread down here."
"2841160","2845780"," We can get down if we can get down here at any point today or tomorrow whether it's now or"
"2845780","2846020"," later."
"2847220","2849200"," That's what that but this is my greed talking. "
"2850420","2852380"," I'd like to buy something for."
"2855500","2858820"," I'm going to look at the reporting for the reporting calendar."

"2982750","2992580"," So big earnings start coming out late January early February late"
"3001190","3004150"," February early March almost the whole month. "
"3012950","3017250"," So I'm probably going to be looking for some kind of a dip by down here for the earnings for"
"3017250","3019950"," probably say a matter of fact I'll set the trade up with you today."
"3021270","3023410"," If we can get down here I'll set up the trade with you."

"3062140","3066020"," If we can get that we can get up into the into the four hundred."
"3067740","3072180"," Like three ninety five three on spy would be like three eight five four hundred. "
"3072200","3076900"," It's probably take take profit on that trade and then switch over to a."
"3077420","3078980"," To sell the news kind of trade."
"3097880","3101960"," Yeah, they start on the bank start in the first week but they don't we don't really rent so really"
"3101960","3104260"," long year season though don't you think they think."

"3427490","3428190"," Brutal."
"3436130","3438070"," The other scary part here is."
"3439450","3441830"," Or at least on Tesla is. "
"3448200","3448900"," S3."
"3452620","3457600"," It's not that far away from closing its gap below at 95, 97."
"3458420","3460620"," It has a retest at 104, 22. "
"3473200","3483190"," And it's retesting its prior lows here."
"3486620","3487980"," See if we can bring this up."
"3501370","3503050"," A second here. "
"3521220","3524560"," So here is Tesla coming into Friday's close."

"3530430","3532530"," Tips already brought down here but you can see. "
"3533530","3537290"," They sold Tesla right so broke underneath its hourly trigger."
"3537850","3543850"," You can see this hourly trend turn over and now come back down to resume."
"3546090","3547430"," It's it's downward path. "
"3549650","3551810"," So I'm not going to consider Tesla by here."
"3551930","3552830"," You can see here."
"3558470","3560970"," You can see its previous lows over here. "
"3562350","3564270"," It's retesting the first one currently."
"3564670","3567230"," We have one more down below and then we want to get more down here."
"3567350","3572230"," But the truth is that there's still a giant gap down here. "
"3572450","3574030"," We'll take a look at where this gap is."
"3575610","3576830"," And previous history."
"3577090","3581330"," I would expect it to even if this is bottom and expect us to come back down and close this"
"3581330","3581910"," stuff up. "
"3584630","3586990"," We'll take a look over there and see where it is."
"3591810","3593650"," It's not the gap isn't showing up."
"3593790","3594970"," There's another gap even lower. "
"3612940","3616300"," It was way back in August of 2020."
"3616580","3620140"," But you can see that this structurally there's nothing here, right?"
"3620140","3622100"," Oh, you guys can't see this stuff."
"3625200","3633400"," So this is way back in August of 2020 and you can see that this is currently where we're trading"
"3633400","3633880"," currently. "
"3634760","3636360"," This is Tesla right here."
"3642810","3644650"," Tesla's retesting this low right here."
"3645450","3647650"," And it just isn't much right here is there. "
"3647930","3649310"," And there isn't much right here either."
"3650930","3652210"," These are daily candles."
"3653130","3657270"," And this is 94, 74, 95, 80 back here. "
"3659130","3664390"," You know, if any of this support here doesn't hold, you've got another gap below."
"3670490","3672930"," It's not quite a gap, but it's light."
"3673370","3675070"," It's definitely light support. "
"3675970","3677190"," So from here lower."
"3692000","3693760"," This is the entire move erased."
"3695440","3696780"," Right down to $25. "
"3697040","3701300"," People say that can't happen, but most assuredly can't."
"3701500","3702880"," Or most assuredly can."
"3704200","3706340"," You can see it happening right now, right?"
"3706740","3708400"," So I just snapped all those lines for you. "
"3709140","3711540"," This is the target that I have down below at 95."
"3714140","3716900"," But you're talking about giant air gaps down here."
"3722500","3724760"," This is basically an air gap right here too. "
"3725580","3727100"," So if you were to take."
"3728980","3730520"," This is an air gap right here."
"3734310","3735250"," Link that gray. "
"3735730","3737010"," It's a giant gap right here."
"3751270","3752910"," It's a big old air gap right there."
"3764980","3768540"," So you're not talking about how I have a lot of support here, right?"
"3768820","3771780"," You're talking about this gap that's in here. "
"3772680","3773900"," It's a big giant gap in here."
"3774700","3776080"," This stuff needs to hold."
"3776240","3777980"," If they can't hold this right here. "
"3777980","3780720"," It's nothing to come back down, close that gap."
"3781000","3783600"," And then you've got this whole area right here."
"3783740","3786860"," That's all it's holding it up from blasting straight down south here. "
"3787640","3789520"," It's a 16 to mid 60s."
"3789780","3791660"," And then below here you have another gap."
"3791840","3793020"," There's another gap that takes down a."
"3795080","3796040"," 25 bucks. "
"3797920","3799940"," You know, so say you can't go down there."
"3800040","3801400"," It's not that far off."
"3802200","3804080"," There's literally nothing here. "
"3804420","3805100"," There's nothing there."
"3805740","3809880"," There's it's very weak down below here to this little spot right here."
"3810540","3811880"," Just going back in time. "
"3813700","3819830"," And the other one is way down below."
"3820010","3822330"," It's like 25 bucks or something somewhere down in here."
"3842730","3844290"," And the price target above here. "
"3844910","3848030"," You've got if any kind of consolidation happens."
"3849430","3852370"," There's a target of 150 and there's a target of 200 above it."
"3858630","3860250"," At least I've got a target of 200. "
"3902950","3904530"," That's a giant gap down there."
"3944860","3946340"," Put the news back on for you."

"7792550","7804810"," this is 2020 back here It's"
"7804810","7814730"," kind of where Tesla is right So even if Tesla comes back up You know, Sam Adams continued down"
"7814730","7827690"," and it's still in consolidation at this point And catching knives on a ticker When"
"7827690","7837690"," you're looking at distribution, you know, the length of time it takes to And"
"7837690","7846490"," to have another accumulation point This is you know, you've talked and this is 2021 back here,"
"7846630","7846750"," right?"
"7847410","7857370"," All of 2022 was a sideways and accumulate And so the begs the question about Tesla does"
"7857370","7867190"," Tesla spend all of 2023 and some kind of consolidation This"
"7867190","7875850"," could be just imagining a Tesla bowl and you spend your whole 2023 doing this That this would be"
"7875850","7879770"," gnarly right I wish you could do an overlay of Tesla and Sam Adams."
"7880190","7884190"," Maybe maybe I can here I should do that."
"7884270","7896130"," I should do a comparison on Well,"

"7902050","7909910"," US stock indexes extend losses The Nasdaq bluffs down once but one percent on on Tesla and Samuel"
"7909910","7919510"," Adams and just show That this could end up taking This Tesla this is probably Right here set point"
"7919510","7926310"," and then you can end up seeing some kind of a move like this on Tesla for 20 2023 Which"
"7926310","7931910"," would be Fucking brutal that if that happened because Tesla's not normally that stock, right?"
"7932530","7937510"," But we have had years where Tesla has been that stock we you might say oh Tesla's in growth cap"

"7962590","7970790"," This was being a Tesla bull in here was basically Tesla shares for 13% in the largest drop since"
"7970790","7979410"," September 2020 Tesla bulls were were cast through the depths of how People were buying you know"
"7979410","7987050"," three-year-out leaps here when there was some major leap buying going on in here So I mean if"
"7987050","7994870"," you saw that with just think if you saw that with Tesla over here for another year Strap in if"
"7994870","8004670"," you strap in If you don't know any Tesables from Or if you know any Tesables have been Tesables"
"8004670","8016230"," for like five ten years Ask them they'll tell you They'll tell you I"
"8021630","8025230"," Can Tesla spend two years in consolidation three years in consolidation?"
"8026370","8035170"," Yes, it can You see that for two or three years of Tesla can you imagine right now you're buying"
"8035170","8037290"," dips Buying dips buying dips."
"8037290","8042630"," I'm I just bought a dip on Tesla I Got a like dip by here."
"8042650","8051010"," I've got a dip by at 95 and a dip by at 65 in like $24 And then I do"
"8051010","8059270"," I do do truly expect to have to hold that for two or three years And sell stupid outside the"
"8059270","8068850"," money calls and stupid puts at $10 On that position So probably"
"8068850","8078470"," two to three years That's my that's my outlook on buying Tesla that's my positive outlook on Tesla"
"8078470","8086390"," right now is You know some of you are like it's going to zero, but My positive outlook on Tesla"
"8086390","8096250"," is buying stonk down here and Not seeing like the fruit of that buying for at"
"8096250","8101090"," least three years at least That's my that's my best case. "
"8101370","8110210"," So if it goes up It's going to be unexpected right Um But that's my best case the best case"
"8110210","8114050"," is that we can sell In my in some my buying active."
"8114330","8119330"," I've started some buying activity And if some of you guys may know that or might not know that but"
"8126430","8132510"," I I'm a testable I'm not an Elon Musk bull right now at all."
"8133390","8143630"," Anyways, shape or form But I am a testable and so as a Tesla bull starting to rebuy Tesla But"
"8143630","8151290"," do it like do I think that Tesla's not going to So do lower crude oil four three spots four"
"8151290","8158950"," percent to seventy seven dollars and fifty eight cents But if I can if I can DCA for the next"
"8158950","8167350"," one to three years one to two years I should be pretty well off whenever that turn happens And"
"8167350","8183310"," happy wherever whatever my positioning is I'll be I'll be a happy buyer Because it'll go up again I"
"8189390","8192110"," Think it'll go up shouldn't say it will go up again. "
"8192309","8204250"," I should I should have an asterisk on there The"
"8204250","8211209"," only way to mitigate that is to sell OTM calls puts Make sure you're DCA and make sure you're"
"8211209","8218590"," comfortable with and have a plan before you buy The moment I can catch the swing somewhere I can't"
"8218590","8226350"," like no one's going to crystal ball to say Tesla's not going to bottom till it sees 25 Um, so"
"8226350","8234190"," you kind of have to measure your buy-ins And have more most of your ammo for 25 dollars or"
"8234190","8239809"," so So I can get that I can get that if I bought it was it was the wrong thing"
"8239809","8254250"," to be buying Right now that I can at least DCA that shit down to like 30 40 bucks I"
"8260129","8267150"," Tesla's try to get gaps, but not it's got a lot of good basing That's that area I just showed"
"8267150","8268250"," you on Tesla back here."
"8268250","8276270"," So if you're looking at Tesla Yeah, I just claimed the test has got a lot of gaps, but the"
"8276270","8286170"," reality is Anything of this $25 is gonna be is gonna be a pretty good bet Um I'm not anti"
"8286170","8292129"," Tesla going down to 25, but I'm not against it going down here But this is the start of the"
"8292129","8299850"," buying if you were gonna start buying Tesla it's somewhere in here It's somewhere in here if you're"
"8299850","8304790"," if you're putting like 10% of your money in and 10 15% of your money in then another"
"8304790","8310930"," 10% and then you've got like tons of cash down here to buy It doesn't matter then if it"
"8310930","8313350"," goes here if it goes up here goes up here."
"8313490","8321490"," You just you've just caught part of the move So I feel as a as an investor I feel good"
"8321490","8331430"," down here Uh dollar cost averaging into it if we if it went lower than 25 bucks um"
"8332190","8344570"," just probably Bigger problems than Probably"
"8344570","8357309"," bigger problems than Then what seems apparent I'm"
"8357309","8370790"," gonna assume that most banks are in right around 25 bucks And"
"8370790","8376209"," if I took a hit if I DCA in and I'm in let's say a minute like Uh at the"
"8376209","8382549"," end of the next so from now until I figure one to three years If I was in at 43"
"8382549","8390330"," and I lost Let's if we went below 25 bucks now is in it like 43 35 43 If we"
"8390330","8398290"," started to break below 25 And I'm assuming that it's going to be some sort of News that's you know"
"8398290","8405050"," tassels and Risk of bankruptcy or some some nonsense And isn't going to be bought by another"
"8405050","8405270"," company. "
"8405270","8411510"," I don't believe any of that would happen According to oil ministry tweets iraq oil exports in 2022"
"8411510","8416330"," worth more than 115 billion dollars I'm assuming that would that would be fraud."
"8416630","8422090"," It would have to be fraud of some kind Uh that could be provable Uh, I take that risk for"
"8422090","8428430"," I'll take that risk for I take that risk for losing my my money On tassel they haven't done me"

"8442930","8449370"," the only other companies I think it would be google apple google apple Uh possibly amazon, although"
"8449370","8455650"," I think am some of amazon's growth is over There aren't that many companies like that walmart maybe"
"8457350","8460130"," Uh tesla is probably the riskiest of all of them."
"8460410","8467250"," It probably has the most potential for growth too So I want to have some growth in that exposure in"
"8467250","8473610"," my investing So I think that's I think most people think that about tesla I thought with all the"
"8473610","8483450"," semantics put aside But I still have I still"

"9607170","9608490"," the move that you want right here. "
"9608630","9614730"," You don't care about this move right here You care about this part of the move right here Right"
"9615290","9619190"," Makes sense You don't care about this move down here, right?"
"9619770","9622170"," You care about this part of the move right here, right?"
"9623090","9627650"," So when you're like when do I take that How do how do I find confirmation of this so I"
"9627650","9629110"," can buy this absolute bottom?"
"9629410","9636350"," You can't you can only trade this up Each level This is where you take your your trade and"
"9636350","9641550"," confidence So if you're looking for when do you pick this back up?"
"9642050","9648090"," I picked December output edged higher as Nigeria cracked down on theft And December crude output"
"9648090","9655890"," climbed to 29 spot 1 4 million barrels a day You're hoping that this consolidation turns into the"
"9655890","9663750"," big blue penis above So you need to get above this blue line right here So if we're looking at"
"9663750","9673250"," that blue line, we're not above it yet It is at where 386 46 you see it"
"9673250","9682030"," we sold right off of it teed right off of it So on a five-minute chart right here 386"
"9682030","9691950"," 46 None of this really matters in here does"
"9691950","9701550"," it the only thing that really matters in here Is we don't get that that the velocity Until we trade"
"9701550","9709610"," consolidate and make this move so you're going to be looking for The consolidation down here You"
"9709610","9714410"," don't really care about any of this either right is the buy down here probably not There's a buy"
"9714410","9722550"," down here, but If you're talking about the move to 395 or 400 It's above here If we can't get"
"9722550","9728650"," above this area here and start gaining some velocity Uh, because this is where the meat of the"
"9728650","9733290"," trade is is where that big thing that I showed you earlier was A big penis is way up here"
"9735610","9742430"," Uh, so currently at the moment That's not happening right currently at the moment you've got Uh,"
"9742930","9749510"," the sellers stepped right in here in the open And they're likely going to attempt to continue to"
"9749510","9758170"," step right in here I'm trying to make the price go down Uh, so I can't take that trade with"
"9758170","9766630"," you Until until we get some velocity right until we get Uh, above where these sellers have been"
"9766630","9776430"," stepping in the entire time they've been coming right in here and just selling Uh, so I guess"
"9776430","9783190"," maybe your question is Maybe your question is should I just buy this dip down here and cover my"
"9783190","9783410"," eyes?"
"9783590","9791550"," Probably not You probably take the trade only until Uh, right in here Like maybe right here you can"
"9791550","9795930"," take it too and then you have to pick this retrade up here I think you'd probably have a third"
"9795930","9809090"," trade for Pam super duper bullish and we're gonna have an okay time to 4,000 Yeah,"

"9904190","9905530"," Just the just this one right here. "
"9905690","9907190"," It gets blue right now."
"9907310","9911830"," You can make it whatever color you want Whatever size you want do whatever you want with it"
"9911830","9917990"," According to shipping reports and ship tracking data Venezuelan crude oil exports fell in 2022 with"

"9922970","9928270"," You could you could literally zen or ven beats What you could literally do right is go outside and"
"9928270","9938230"," smoke a big fat joint and do nothing And put"
"9938230","9944030"," this on an hourly on a one day chart, right You wouldn't have to do anything you just put this"
"9944030","9951770"," on a one day chart With this right here And you see how we're underneath the blue line right now"
"9951770","9961370"," on a daily chart See how we're underneath the blue line right now Uh, so this is"
"9961370","9967690"," bearish right We should expect continued this right And you're like I want to go. "
"9967810","9968390"," I want to take blue."
"9968590","9977050"," I want to take calls cap Um Do you see how we crossed over here And then it came back"
"9977050","9978230"," and we got the actual move."
"9978490","9987330"," So this would this would be the move right here Right kind of see the same thing over here By"
"9987330","9995390"," that dip and you're off and running right So We already had a nice little move right here in a"
"9995390","10001490"," daily so you're gonna expect us to come back down here Blue line to come down one big leg up"
"10001490","10007830"," over and then you'll get the move Um, so what are you looking for is looking forward known support"
"10007830","10017730"," is we know it's down here Do you make it big make it"
"10017730","10025910"," huge You We know there's some support down here. "
"10026030","10027450"," We know that buyers stepped in here."
"10027570","10032490"," We know that buyers stepped in here We're anticipating that buyers are gonna step in somewhere in"
"10032490","10042230"," here Right There are a couple other places where buyers have stepped in and we've got some"
"10050750","10056690"," We're going to look for some places We know that some buyers were down here, right?"
"10057450","10068150"," So we're just going to look for some places That we know buyers have been previously Where"
"10068150","10077890"," demand has been ready to call it demand down here To keep our eyes on see if there's any kind"
"10077890","10085350"," of buying activity down in here And we're gonna then look for some some some some some places of"
"10085350","10095450"," supply so we know we've got this gap that needs filled above Turn that one yellow Put"
"10095450","10096930"," another gap above over here."
"10097270","10098070"," Leave it or not. "
"10098170","10108010"," It's here Make those sellers up there Pretty simple, right?"
"10109690","10117730"," Uh, you can go outside smoke a doobie and just come straight back and when you see My point is"
"10117730","10126790"," that you could just you just let this play out down here And if you if you see us kind"
"10126790","10134730"," of do this and then we jump over briefly That's that's where I'd be looking for the long does that"
"10134730","10142570"," make sense So you consolidate consolidate look for some demand to come in at some point could be"
"10142570","10150290"," here could be here You don't really even care about this demand here You care about the first push"
"10150290","10159510"," over And if you're in positive gamma, this should be a supportive dip buy And you would take that"
"10159510","10165670"," trade with stops below is where your stops would be just in case of reverses on you And if the"
"10165670","10171470"," trade trade if the trade, you know, if it is supportive, you'll see this This is the move that"
"10171470","10178650"," you're trying to get in right here Sure, we'll do this fairly can fairly consistently And then you"
"10178650","10180570"," look at this on smaller timeframes at that point."
"10180770","10186790"," So you so you know, you don't have the time this part You don't care about this You don't care"
"10186790","10188870"," about this you can see a failure here, right?"
"10188990","10191870"," We went over And then you'd have stops here."
"10192110","10196870"," So if it's if you traded your stops You wouldn't have gotten blown out here, right?"
"10198310","10203690"," That makes sense This we had failure here too, right came over you would have bought that dip and"
"10203690","10204610"," it failed, right?"
"10205790","10212770"," So one two times with stops in place third time would have been the charm Right this one would have"
"10212770","10222950"," been a charm and now you're looking for one more down here Same thing to play out so Tactfully If"
"10222950","10226110"," I'm looking at the market right now, this is not the time to buy a dip. "
"10226270","10226850"," Does that make sense?"
"10227670","10235590"," I'm looking I'm waiting for some kind of volume to step in here And until I see that volume Uh,"
"10236490","10239950"," there's no trade now this trade in here this consolidation trade."
"10239970","10244150"," There's some good trades in here You can see that little trade right here."
"10244610","10251570"," This is a good trade Now is another good trade right there when it's not like the it's not like"
"10251570","10259150"," you can't make money here because you can right um Like an on a day or two or three day"
"10259150","10262550"," trade, but we just looking on a daily right now. "
"10262690","10263810"," This is looking pretty weak, isn't it?"
"10265110","10267010"," This isn't like some big giant green bar."
"10267170","10275190"," See that big giant green bar It's not yeah, not really seeing that Um so far today so far today."
"10275290","10276610"," This is looking kind of weak, isn't it?"
"10277710","10286130"," so Um, I'm waiting for that volume spike As a matter of fact, here's one right here, right?"
"10286770","10296610"," This is um 1013 So we'll take a look at 1013 And just look at what it looks"
"10296610","10307010"," like when we get a volume spike And"
"10307010","10307990"," we're not quite seen. "
"10308170","10310510"," This is actually kind of looks like today, doesn't it?"

"18454970","18469010"," Um So if you're looking at So"
"18469010","18478950"," this blue right here, this is the the algorithm And it showed this pump right here Showed this"
"18478950","18479650"," pump right here."
"18479750","18489010"," Yeah, the program the algorithm is not 100% it's not done yet Um Which and it should be lower."
"18489490","18493430"," There's some reasons for that it's higher right now, but don't worry about that We're working on"
"18493430","18498290"," this right now The anticipation is that there's going to be a pump here. "
"18498490","18499590"," You can see it right here, right?"
"18499870","18505530"," Now not that high It's probably going to be like here The neat part about the algorithm though is"
"18505530","18515510"," it's showing uh predictive path that matches up with what jpm put on as a Uh"
"18515510","18524810"," a collar Uh, so you would if we ever come up here you would sell it right So if you're"
"18524810","18528930"," a bear you could just be like, but i'm putting my shirt on today or i'm putting on my puts"
"18528930","18534830"," today It doesn't matter if you get your puts here or here If we don't trade any higher and we"

"18539370","18544870"," about the intraday moves today tomorrow or even Part of the er season you just know if you get in"
"18544870","18552960"," now at some point it's going to print This down here Um, and you know as long as you're in"
"18552960","18556480"," for this part of the move it doesn't really matter what it happens It doesn't matter what happens"
"18556480","18563640"," now or next month or february Um And you can kind of see even the predictive algorithm is"
"18563640","18567500"," predicting this now of course This isn't as deep as where it should be this should be the spool"
"18567500","18572600"," line should be down here somewhere I need to have some work to do in this fucking thing so that"
"18572600","18579980"," it's right But it's still a predictive in its path and the jpm collar is predicting something"
"18579980","18588590"," similar Uh, so if you my my thought would be that all this shit that you're seeing today is Uh,"
"18589030","18590130"," I don't fucking care."
"18590290","18597750"," I'm just gonna put a put spread on For march for 3060 and or a fucking short and you can"

"18607590","18608290"," It's not that much."
"18608610","18617610"," You know Uh, you're asking for basically a pump to 4065 that's pretty much all you're asking for if"
"18617610","18626270"," you're a bull That's all you're gonna get to so We're either gonna start selling down right away or"
"18626270","18633950"," we're gonna pump and start selling down I do think we trade sideways and up for er season, but You"
"18633950","18638750"," know, these guys are just gonna fit their fucking that's why you're seeing heavy sellers Any any"
"18638750","18651890"," any any pump is going to be met with positioning for put down move into February and march Uh, this"

"20545480","20555000"," 2 p.m. Tomorrow So you're going to see an expansion of of implied moves tomorrow Uh, so if"
"20555000","20562260"," I had to take a guess into 2 p.m. Tomorrow would be that we're gonna trade sideways Into two"
"20562260","20562580"," o'clock."
"20563040","20571460"," There's already a little bit of Is not let's say let's just call that the two o'clock Our normally"
"20571460","20579240"," we sell the the minutes what i'm gonna Anticipate for tomorrow is that hopefully that there's a dip"
"20579240","20582580"," to buy tomorrow Uh for this market."
"20582880","20586960"," That's my hope this could have been it right here Just gonna be the dip to buy you buy your"
"20586960","20591960"," call spreads now because this is your first chance to buy some call spreads Uh for a trip up to"
"20591960","20601920"," 395 You could encounter a bloodbath On the minutes, but I would I would warn you If you're in"
"20601920","20608700"," call spreads here, I would warn you that we're likely to revert back here again Uh, we've done this"
"20608700","20614300"," before right we've had like blood baths And then it comes straight back up, uh, super fairs if"
"20614300","20621080"," you're wanting to be more Uh, hey, I'm gonna wait just just in case that happens To buy that dip"
"20621080","20622640"," for the move up for er season. "
"20622920","20623800"," You could do that."
"20624000","20629860"," That's no big deal Um, do I think we start trading this up now into the minutes."
"20629880","20633700"," There's something that's unknown Uh, that's that's a possibility as well. "
"20633880","20637880"," That would be a precursor that I guess my own recommendation Is if you're gonna buy some call"
"20637880","20644660"," spreads for that move to 39395 you'd have to just diamond hand close your laptop Close your"
"20644660","20649920"," computer if anyone tells you otherwise If they're like we're gonna burn we're gonna burn tomorrow."
"20649920","20651000"," It's gonna be terrible, right?"
"20651600","20655600"," Because even if we do burn, it's more than likely going to come back, uh mean revert We've done"
"20655600","20659140"," that how many you can two three where we were famous for that, right?"
"20660000","20666880"," We'd have news like minutes or we'd have, um Uh meetings and we would sell off fairs And then it"
"20666880","20671480"," would just come straight it would like two three days later or right back where we started Uh,"
"20671980","20680020"," hopefully you guys remember those instances of that happening Uh in recent memory at least So my"
"20680020","20683340"," assumption would be you're gonna get trapped my assumption automatically is you're gonna get"
"20683340","20689180"," trapped in here Whatever the decision is You can either buy this dip down here or buy a dip It's"
"20689180","20693880"," the much lower down here, but I still think you'll get a mean reversion higher I think the same"
"20693880","20699100"," thing holds true Uh if you don't buy this dip and it just moons tomorrow I think if we go"
"20699100","20705500"," up there and we actually tag that 395 or or 380 if you we end up tagging this above You're"
"20705500","20714580"," gonna end up seeing this is the cell the cell trigger anyways for that trip lower um So I guess"
"20714580","20720500"," the you know that the management trade Is you take the bottom here for this trip higher?"
"20720500","20726440"," Doesn't matter if it takes till tomorrow if it takes until next week or if it takes into the end"
"20726440","20729280"," of er season Uh to get up there."
"20729400","20735120"," We should get up there Um, I'm hoping that we get some weakness tomorrow and then we're able to"
"20735120","20740860"," climb our climb our way back up into er season up here It gives us a room to breathe To"
"20740860","20747700"," get up into er season Uh, so I'll probably be flat in here You could take uh also a straddle"
"20747700","20753400"," on the market for the news tomorrow You could probably take some kind of a straddle that's uh up"
"20753400","20762340"," here at uh 388 or 390 And you could straddle the market down below at like 374 375 And try"
"20762340","20763700"," to capture whatever that move is. "
"20763880","20766520"," I don't know if they're gonna burn if they you do a straddle They'll probably have to have some"
"20766520","20770620"," time on it Um, so they don't get torched with zero dates in here."
"20770800","20777060"," They'll grind you in here in both of these trades The initial move up or down could be quick And"
"20777060","20782060"," then back down then higher so you know that you have to manage that trade as well Same would be"
"20782060","20789560"," initial move down Uh, and then you you carry it over afterwards Uh for the minutes tomorrow If you"
"20789560","20797220"," want to know what my take is on the minutes that i'll be released tomorrow Uh, I'm so the what"
"20797220","20805740"," the meeting In the last meeting that we had the way how angry jpa was How he was acting."

"20815760","20824420"," fed I think it's specifically in regards to um Specifically in regards to the backroom"
"20824420","20825000"," conversations. "
"20825600","20830620"," He couldn't say it in the last uh meeting would be too too much of a shock for the market"
"20831420","20840280"," But the minutes can be that Uh somewhat of you can you can let some of the shock out Uh"
"20840280","20844920"," for the market to absorb Well, so I think that's what the meet that that's that's the minute"
"20844920","20849520"," minutes are gonna come out as even though he didn't say that He pretty much addressed those"
"20849520","20855540"," concerns and the fact that that those concerns were coming from retail and not from Uh, the mass"
"20855540","20862340"," media means that he knows that people are aware of this Uh, they're they're kind of stuck in a hole"
"20862340","20869960"," right now Uh that they're stuck in a hole, you know that they're that they're backed against the"

"20981220","20985380"," And then i'm going to switch over to i'm going to bring something up in the back You guys are"
"20985380","20991640"," watching this right now, so i'll leave this on right here So you can see it in the background i'm"

"21016640","21026960"," inflation rate next New pain and then i'm going to bring up the federal funds rate new pain, okay I"
"21031460","21041400"," Have that right Head funds rate Makes you get the threat pectrophotophones rate inflation"
"21041400","21050980"," rate and then the unemployment rate we're going to look at I need to write that one in"
"21055880","21065580"," Yeah New pain, okay See a nice beautiful tag here at vwap"
"21065580","21070840"," you have the one minute Uh blue line coming up we'll see if they rebuy this again to go up"
"21070840","21085000"," higher I'm going to bring up for you the You"
"21097620","21106900"," So this here is the spx And historically this top line right here this orange line this is uh"
"21106900","21116740"," the fed funds rate i believe This Is the fed funds rate Yeah, this is the fed"
"21116740","21117180"," funds rate. "
"21117180","21120580"," This is the inflation rate."
"21121180","21131540"," This is the unemployment rate So just looking on a larger time frame here typically see The"
"21131540","21137420"," effective rate is really high right now Uh, if they're they they're probably talking about dropping"
"21137420","21143360"," it in the back Background of these meetings, uh, you've got inflation coming down even if it's only"
"21143360","21153180"," briefly and the last part here is that the Uh, the unemployment rate is not where we want it Um,"
"21153240","21161340"," so this is where the hawkishness from the fed comes from no a smaller time frame at least Let's"
"21161340","21167840"," have a look right there And i want you to see that the unemployment rate is actually rising right"
"21167840","21173940"," now So this is constructive because it makes sense when you start to see constructive unemployment"
"21173940","21181440"," you start to see Uh constructive inflation coming down and the fed funds rates rising it's not to"
"21181440","21190540"," say that the fed is going to get all um Uh dovish here But it does raise the question at"
"21190540","21193360"," least Uh, are we making progress?"
"21194220","21200860"," Yes Uh, we're not seeing maybe they're looking for continuation so you could get a conversation"
"21200860","21207900"," from the fed in the background that's Uh, you know, we're we're considering pausing rates in 2023"
"21207900","21211820"," We're going to monitor the unemployment rate They're going to tell you they're not going to"
"21211820","21214320"," actually tell you they're going to monitor the unemployment rate They're going to tell you they're"
"21214320","21215420"," going to monitor inflation."
"21215740","21221220"," They can't use the bad word of unemployment Uh, they'll get fired right everybody fired if that"
"21221220","21226840"," happens Uh, they have to say it's unemployment or inflation when in reality it's just this"
"21226840","21232860"," unemployment getting this unemployment trigger up The problem with that is Uh, it's not always"
"21233900","21236080"," Usually you see this snap right here. "
"21236180","21241840"," This is a prime example right here Right fed funds rate gets gets cut inflation is still coming up,"
"21241960","21242580"," but it's going down."
"21242760","21246960"," They know they broke something They're there, you know, inflation is coming down and and uh,"
"21247200","21255300"," unemployment's coming up But it previously in history we've had moments where Uh, right about here,"
"21255340","21255560"," right?"
"21256340","21260360"," You start a plateau And you get that you get the the fed fund rate."
"21260500","21265780"," I want you to see this when they cut here The market actually has a bloodbath moment And you have"
"21265780","21274820"," this ramp up here So if you hear anything from the fed that's like dovish Right Because the reason"
"21274820","21278720"," i'm having this conversation with you is because if you have anything like that dovish conversation"
"21278720","21282820"," from the fed Right, there's this is 1989. "
"21283400","21288360"," You actually saw you actually saw it pause rates there You can see the market go up for the rest"
"21288360","21295060"," of this year until we get one more bottoming once unemployment catches up over here Uh, so there's"
"21295060","21301460"," two things you need to know going into tomorrow and that would be I Would be if there's any kind"
"21301460","21311280"," of like If there's any kind of talk about Any kind of talk about Pauseing rates down the road"
"21311280","21316920"," to monitor unemployment or they were they're gonna say monitor inflation or something like that"
"21317540","21318660"," There's like two scenarios."
"21318960","21323960"," There's either this scenario where We get a face ripper initial public reaction and we start"
"21323960","21331580"," actually bloodbathing it down for 2023 If they were ever to come out and be like super super Super"
"21331580","21338380"," dovish That's what I would expect here Something like this The quick rip up and then we start"
"21338380","21346800"," selling market if they're like just just trying not to shock the market tomorrow Uh, you could see"
"21346800","21354000"," you know that bloodbath down But then this like a weird like year of going up until they can get"
"21354000","21359280"," that bloodbath down Once unemployment comes up to me Uh, this stuff and they actually cut rates"
"21360100","21368500"," Now, so you want to be hyper aware of that heading into tomorrow hyper aware of the context of What"
"21368500","21375280"," the fed is saying in the background Uh Is going to be important and they're always like well, we"
"21375280","21385040"," don't want to shock the market If they if it's super it's super duper Dovish Uh Historically"
"21385040","21392840"," we tend to Uh, start selling the market For what for where we are with the where unemployment is We"
"21392840","21402420"," tend to Sell it down if the fed is we're staying the course Uh, but"
"21402420","21410920"," we're we're we're we're we're we're monitoring it Something like that Uh, or if they're staying the"
"21410920","21419440"," course it'll be Um Market should should go down slowly Until we could have that crash but the"
"21419440","21426420"," market's like if the if the fed is like Uh, we're willing to To eyeball it or something crazy like"
"21426420","21426620"," that."
"21426620","21433260"," You could see enough market for 2023 Which is kind of bizarre with with with a bottom down the road"
"21433260","21437600"," once unemployment rises It says like well, I was just talking to you about it on the phone about"
"21437600","21444560"," that double pump That double inflation pump Where they come get you if end of the year Uh, so I'm"
"21444560","21448520"," interested to see what happens tomorrow or what's being talked about in the background and how it's"
"21448520","21450960"," packaged For your consumption tomorrow. "
"21451380","21457960"," There are a lot of uh, bears out there that There are a lot of bears out there that Uh,"
"21458380","21466500"," I think that the In myself included I think that the the fed is the fed the fed's in a"
"21467360","21474420"," like the the boxing end of the fed is Every time you have the minutes every time you have a"
"21474420","21481460"," meeting it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse Um They're being boxed into a corner."
"21481980","21483640"," And so the question always becomes here."
"21484060","21485920"," When do we have that last bottom?"
"21486160","21486440"," Is it?"
"21487080","21492600"," Is it when they finally say is it it's it's usually going to be when they finally cut rates?"
"21493440","21501620"," Now when they get super duper davish We'll typically see a bloodbath Uh, if they stay hawkish,"
"21501860","21507080"," we've had two different instances of what happens to the market It can be, you know, I'm hope we're"
"21507080","21512520"," holding the lines still that that argument And if if the market believes the fed is actually"
"21512520","21518860"," fighting inflation IE Getting the unemployment numbers high the market can go sideways and up Uh"
"21518860","21525520"," for the rest of this year until they dump it again Uh, that could be viable for the fed so"
"21525520","21532720"," that the market doesn't crash lower than 3000 Um, and we don't get the 14 1600 bloodbath 2400"
"21532720","21539560"," bloodbath that kind of stuff Now that talks about the argument that the fed uh put is down around"
"21539560","21546820"," 3000 And so they could attempt to try to pump this market into the rest of this year so that"
"21546820","21553380"," Uh, they can maintain control of the market But I guess if you see anything that's outside of those"
"21553380","21561260"," two things Uh, you know, if you see something that's like super super davish You could likely see a"
"21561260","21568320"," market crash If you see something that's uh, super super super I don't think you're going to see"
"21568320","21571280"," super dav or hawkish I don't think you're going to see in the minutes. "
"21571280","21579080"," Hey, we're considering raising rates even more Than our plant than our path Uh Uh, but maybe I"
"21579080","21590100"," guess that I guess that's maybe You"
"21590100","21596920"," did crush him 3d1 sees right on brother Appreciate that legend x 2d x thanks for supporting the"
"21596920","21605900"," channel What are you guys saying up there?"
"21607000","21610840"," Yeah, there's so there's there's a couple instances in the 1970s."
"21611040","21614160"," There's an instant some instances And the 1980s."
"21614300","21620180"," There are some instances where Uh, they traded it sideways even though they cut rates Uh, they were"
"21620180","21628480"," waiting for Uh unemployment to catch up Uh, so if we did trade the market up You would see uh"
"21629040","21634200"," Unemployment deteriorate Over the next other the course of the year and then you'd see one more one"
"21634200","21642560"," more uh bloodbath at the end of the year And that's that whole that's that whole idea that Oh, hold"

"22110690","22121230"," events, right for at least Uh, jolts is is a potentially surprising thing it has been um,"
"22121490","22128850"," but But You know the first day of the year federal trade commission says there's no ongoing"
"22128850","22137330"," settlement tools for microsoft act vision deal beaten down on the first day and Which means the"
"22137330","22143050"," obvious stuff like the thing stuff and that hasn't really happened so I think that's that's a"

"22148850","22155230"," 2022 at least get some kind of a pump bump up at least I think even spot Yes really been"
"22155230","22164930"," a continuation of the stuff that worked like xo i Now right that stuff is still outperforming It's"
"22164930","22171590"," the same trade as the last month Which I would have thought it would have at least today been a"
"22171590","22180190"," little bit the opposite of that Yeah I've got an algo that that's kind of tracking what the jpm"
"22180190","22186790"," collar is But then when it looks at the dgi a it's like, yeah, whatever weakness we get DJ i"
"22186790","22189790"," is gonna outperform again this quarter and i'm like, what?"
"22191130","22200250"," So What fascinates me about like that stuff like Dao xo i yt"
"22200250","22208390"," is that You know, it's xo e Xo e is obviously diverged from crude, right?"
"22208710","22217950"," So that's like something that deserves watching and so Just really wants to tank You're gonna have"
"22217950","22223790"," to hit the stuff that worked over the last like six months and they rolled into xl f All this"
"22223790","22228690"," p.m. Money when all the portfolio manager money went to xl f xle It's a little bit left in"
"22228690","22235030"," xl u Um, but they're in it right now the the trade the the percent bullish on xle is like"
"22235030","22244570"," 72 percent or 78 percent or something like that Mm-hmm Well, I mean you can't really short Bank"
"22244570","22247030"," stocks because earnings are like 10 days away."

"22256510","22262470"," Yeah, so it really stuff will levitate The closer you get the earnings so like if tech stocks don't"
"22262470","22270570"," start At least stabilizing and moving and floating higher like in in a week or two That's a really"
"22270570","22271170"," bad sign."
"22271390","22277190"," I would think to the market in general because Because people don't want to be short and get spiked"
"22277190","22277970"," out, right?"
"22278570","22288450"," So So if they if they're not acting well in another week That's a really bad sign would"
"22288450","22294210"," think for the market in general And what are your expectations on the volatility coming into"
"22294210","22298430"," tomorrow with jolts and ism and Or just jolts and ism."
"22298610","22299590"," What was your plan on that trade?"
"22300830","22308570"," Well, what I wanted to do in my mind was sort of like sell some ball For tomorrow and own"
"22308570","22320910"," like the next day like so i'm becoming of the static zero to one dte Have"
"22320910","22328390"," you heard have you heard that that there's a lot of speculation around the fact that That the banks"
"22328390","22335610"," are trading Uh zero zero stuff because they can avoid regs that way, right?"
"22336030","22339910"," Yeah So that's interesting. "
"22340490","22346430"," I you know, I I just caught winded that like a few days ago someone mentioned it to me and"
"22346430","22348010"," Yeah, he was good."
"22348390","22355190"," Yeah No, we've been we've paid so many zero dates here that we we actually we could see the"
"22355190","22362170"," transition into them from the banks themselves We could yeah, we could see it in the actual flow"
"22362170","22368230"," each day To start happening a couple months ago But then it really ramped up when they switched to"
"22368230","22372850"," this a lot and then well They kind of like cb or the cme was like, oh, then we're gonna"
"22372850","22378530"," start trading zero dates every day around here They used to never have zero dates Opex every day of"
"22378530","22379010"," the week now."
"22379090","22384990"," They have it every day of the week Yeah, so by request by who who's that request by?"
"22385970","22395670"," fucking banks Hmm Well, I just figured that like the cbe was like we have demands"
"22395670","22405530"," so why not who's the demand Retail was heavily demanding like they were they were but With the"
"22405530","22407050"," volume that was coming into the market. "
"22407290","22411270"," I think I think spot gamma once brought talked about it too I think that maybe a month or two"
"22411270","22411390"," ago."
"22411590","22415450"," They talked about it That was the banks getting involved it, but you could see it just in the"
