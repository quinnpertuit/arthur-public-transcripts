"129750","130990"," Can we unclench?"
"131330","132790"," Can the Vix has got a grip?"
"136470","139590"," Pink tighter, I've got a few little things to do here in the background."
"143240","143820"," Oh, come on now."

"157940","160460"," You know, YouTube is so janky."
"160920","163660"," Well, YouTube's kind of great, but it's also kind of janky."
"166800","170300"," So, you got to click this to get here to do this, do that, then you have to click this"
"170300","171820"," to do this, do that. "
"172820","179800"," And then, like that, close that, where things you should just be able to set up and have them run."
"180120","180960"," You have to do them manually."
"187990","188450"," Pink tighter. "
"200570","201550"," Okay, right."
"201750","202070"," Here we go."

"212290","213630"," No, Vix is bad."
"213730","214630"," I'll share the Vix right now. "
"215530","224570"," One big issue we have this morning is that the options market is not priced to go much lower, a"
"224570","226350"," little lower, just not much."
"227590","232510"," Where we're looking for some kind of runaway down move or hoping for some kind of running run away"
"232510","234350"," down move move the past couple days."
"234350","240470"," It's just a slow staircase down rather than elevator down. "
"242550","245930"," You're sort by newest customization."
"247830","251150"," Scribbers, like it should just be subscribers all the time."
"252090","254650"," It shouldn't just be anybody and YouTube should know that. "
"255990","258350"," All right, we got all that done."
"260940","262420"," Let me go on over to Twitch."
"263100","264180"," See how the Twitch gang. "
"269740","270580"," There we go."
"271280","272120"," Which people are up."

"282390","282870"," Happy Thursday."
"283190","283610"," Happy Friday. "

"302230","309510"," Some time to regenerate your own batteries, even if it's just in a spiritual way, regardless of"
"309510","310350"," your religious or not."
"311270","314010"," People do need that time for their souls. "
"314730","316350"," I hope you're able to get that this weekend."
"316350","319590"," And then, of course, we have golfers."

"332230","334970"," Tonight and then on Sunday."
"336770","342390"," We've been, you know, making our plans for spring and summer and, of course, they're full."
"344250","345530"," Michigan's a weird kind of a place. "
"345530","348790"," I travel in the winter to take ski vacations and stuff, but."
"350170","352910"," One of the best times in Michigan is spring and summer."
"354150","357510"," It's a very, it's, it has a lot of dark days. "
"358350","359030"," In Michigan."
"359290","361310"," So when you get sun, you're like, let's do this."
"361430","361790"," Let's do that. "
"361930","362310"," Let's do this."
"366100","368440"," Okay, so it's coming down here and some support right now."
"370600","376660"," I'm seeing a piece by Nick Timraus via Twitter says the Fed decision to raise rates last month was"
"376660","381280"," one of the closest calls in rate setters have made in years officials concluded. "
"382000","387540"," They would, they could go ahead with a quarter point hike just 48 hours ahead of the decision."
"387960","388700"," I'll do the credits."
"388940","389800"," We struggle was confused. "
"391700","393680"," So Nick dropping that this morning."
"394300","396940"," If you don't know this, whether you know this or not."
"396940","400560"," Nick Timraus is considered the Fed mouthpiece. "
"401280","407040"," And that news is coming out based upon the jobs are claim claims numbers this morning."
"408540","411140"," So some of our jobless claims this morning."
"411780","415500"," So right here, the reason we're getting this bounce right now down here is because the options"
"415500","416000"," market. "
"416340","417260"," Is not."
"418020","420660"," You know, the options market is not priced in lower."
"421040","423680"," We need like cascading puts right now to go lower. "
"424520","427160"," And yesterday we talked about four or five."
"427820","430040"," Think 18 or 13 or something."
"430160","432000"," That's the low end of the strike. "
"432420","435320"," It's right allows you to have the options market."
"435320","437060"," We open flat this morning."
"438040","439760"," Saturday put nothing. "
"440580","445060"," And then now we're trading and tagging this this lower range here."
"445420","448720"," We need to see puts hit the market this morning to go lower."
"449480","450300"," We'll look at that this morning. "
"450340","450660"," I'll see."
"450660","452640"," Remember back to bring up an implied move."
"453200","456540"," An implied move or not implied move implied ball will show if. "
"457440","458500"," If the market."
"460280","463180"," Can get some puts into it to push us lower."
"467190","469290"," We need zero dates coming to play basically. "
"473620","474540"," Then we're off the bat."
"474660","475120"," We've got a."
"475720","477220"," Forty nine thousand."
"478140","480940"," Four zero five P's off the bell this morning. "
"481180","485200"," Not a huge number, but more growing put buyers coming in right now."
"487180","489020"," We just hit 50,000 right now."
"489080","489880"," So we'll get some more. "
"490020","491840"," I'll put buyers that'll jump into the market here."
"495060","496060"," Hey, Ace."
"496240","496620"," Can I go?"
"496720","496940"," How are you?"
"499330","500050"," Good morning. "
"500750","501850"," So it's time to join us."
"501970","503490"," We get the Canadian IP PMI."
"503670","505430"," So prior 51 spot six. "
"505810","507490"," As well, we are expecting comments from."
"507770","511890"," That's a lot who discusses the outlook for the US economy and monetary policy."
"512210","513710"," And the event in Little Rock. "
"515390","519429"," The fact is expected as well as a Q and A with both audience and media."
"521770","524410"," And the registration to this event has ended."
"526670","527410"," So the. "
"528490","530070"," Now this is kind of odd."
"532110","533670"," You've got a few things here."
"533790","535250"," We're gonna talk about the rate decisions. "
"535370","538490"," If we pause, if we hike, we'll go over all that stuff today."
"539750","541350"," We'll probably have time to do that today."
"541450","542870"," So we'll go over rate hike or rate. "
"543770","546070"," Rate hikes, pauses and."
"548350","551150"," Cuts and how they impact the market."
"551510","554570"," There's a lot of stuff involved in this that we need to go. "
"554650","557470"," We went, we've gone over it in depth in previous videos."
"558050","561490"," But today is probably another good day to rehash some of that stuff."
"561990","566290"," And we probably have some new watchers listeners that have never seen this stuff. "
"566410","568150"," So we'll go over it again today."
"568150","571450"," I'll just keep everybody up on track and up and touch."
"573430","574350"," On that stuff. "
"574610","578090"," I am a little surprised with Nick this morning saying."
"578870","582570"," The latest Fed decision to raise rates came down to the wire."
"582790","584170"," Now that is concerning because. "
"585950","587070"," That's concerning because."
"589510","591010"," Number one, I doubt that."
"595360","596420"," The new Fed. "
"597720","600520"," I'm going to explain it to you very clearly why."
"601560","602780"," The old Fed."
"603340","605120"," If you're a new trader, new investor. "
"605920","608200"," If you're an investor trader since 2020."
"609780","610820"," Until now."
"612940","614080"," Until 2020. "
"614620","616280"," The Fed was the surprise fed."
"616500","617700"," They'd be like surprise I'm an effort."
"618380","623000"," And they would throw you a curve ball and it would, it would wreck. "
"623600","624000"," Any."
"625320","629660"," Almost every time whatever everybody was they take you to the other side and they take it to the"
"629660","629960"," wood shed."
"632360","636240"," However, the market was positioned it was always the opposite, especially when they really wanted"
"636240","637060"," to throw one at you. "
"637860","640820"," And get a lot of people over the years and then during COVID."
"642700","646100"," Jerome basically said I'm we're not going to do this to you ever again."
"646600","649300"," We're going to always telegraph to you. "
"650030","651420"," Before something happens."
"652260","654960"," And Jerome has not telegraphed at any moment."
"656180","657360"," Until this morning. "
"658440","660580"," That there will be a change to policy."
"661400","661960"," So."
"663520","667360"," Prior to this last meeting, you would have heard something. "
"668480","669700"," Leaked somewhere."
"671060","672880"," That the Fed was going to cut rates."
"673920","677440"," Now the bond market was saying, yeah, they're going to cut rates, but still you. "
"677740","680820"," The Fed had a tacit agreements with everybody."
"681140","682220"," They'll tell you."
"682860","684520"," So seeing this morning. "
"685200","687900"," The feds mouthpiece from WAPO."
"688240","692800"," This is clearly downside risks have increased the global economy."
"695220","699300"," Seeing the feds mouthpiece, Nick Temeros this morning, say. "
"699820","701100"," 51 spot six."
"701640","703360"," And as well, we are expecting comments from the feds."
"703580","706000"," But who discusses the outlook for the US economy. "
"706280","709600"," I'm going to mute this because board, nor board doesn't matter at all this morning."
"709740","711960"," What matters is that Nick Temeros said."
"713580","718460"," The fed this morning that the feds decision to raise rates last month was one of the closest calls. "
"718460","720000"," It's rates that is have made in years."
"720480","721840"," That's why I'm calling that bullshit."
"723780","728760"," If they were not going to raise rates, you would that would have been telegraphed before we got to"
"728760","732040"," even if it was just before you would have been telegraphed to just before. "
"732860","733980"," Is my point here."
"737370","739570"," And so now you're getting that telegraphing."
"740390","744850"," You're also getting not only the telegraphing that they will possibly or will cut rates. "
"744990","747270"," That will be the narrative from this point forward."
"748250","755370"," That will be the narrative into the minutes when those are released as well."
"756910","758710"," That they will be fed rate cuts. "
"759990","766250"," And that's not that's not the news that came out with jobs or claims this morning has to do with"
"766250","767290"," the fed."
"768130","773110"," And the fed is now telling you expect rate pause or rate cuts."
"774050","775170"," We're going to look at. "
"776610","781150"," Fed rate pauses cuts the interplay in those things."
"782450","783870"," Why it matters."
"784590","790570"," And it matters based on more though than just what you think matters based in that matters a lot"
"790570","791630"," with the interplay between. "
"792830","795970"," Unemployment with inflation."
"796950","798430"," Unemployment inflation."
"800350","806330"," Where rate or the inward yield curve all that kind of stuff all that stuff like rolled up into one. "
"806890","808690"," So we'll take a look at that this morning as well."
"809310","810370"," And just see where it all sits."
"813250","816770"," That's big news heading into a long weekend. "
"817690","818370"," Big news."
"821150","826650"," And this is the news also that bondholders want to see they want to see a rate cut."
"829050","830030"," Hold on here. "
"833060","834380"," Just a second here."
"842420","846120"," Now up to 62,405 P's."
"848180","849940"," 405 P for today. "
"854360","856180"," Now trading 76 cents."
"859870","861630"," Have some allergies this morning."
"866240","870720"," Having like a cold and hot friends come through to come through right now. "
"870720","875920"," It's kind of crazy getting like early season pollen and stuff."
"876680","881560"," And then we'll have like 30 degree storm fronts rolling through with 67 degree storm fronts."
"884400","888060"," I noticed just south of us it's like 70 degrees here. "
"888220","891600"," It's not even we haven't even had a 70 degree day and it's been like 60."
"892500","897120"," 35 in snow rain showers or rain storms and wind."
"898040","900040"," Back down to 30 degrees with snow. "
"904120","905240"," Thunderstorms tornadoes."
"905540","906920"," All kinds of nonsense."
"914360","916240"," The banks are micro recovering. "
"927300","930940"," There's a so honestly I want to show you guys the implied move for today."
"934270","936270"," Thanks or micro healing this morning."
"941090","942830"," There's a lot of stuff on this like. "
"945150","946690"," I don't anticipate."
"947550","950170"," I did anticipate to pause and."
"951610","957130"," Possibly some I just did a pause, but I want it to be told even if it was before I'm"
"957130","957370"," meeting. "
"957790","959230"," We never got that, did we?"
"959450","961570"," And I wanted the earlier pause."
"963390","964870"," It didn't get it."
"966110","969250"," We're it looks like now we're going to get the pause. "
"969250","970790"," I would not ever."
"971350","973890"," Right now drink the Kool-Aid that we're going to get a cut."
"976860","978160"," Would not at all. "
"978400","982940"," And furthermore, I would stay on course even if it's not priced like this."
"984280","984840"," Personally."
"986500","988260"," You have to remember that. "
"992380","994840"," This is a hard thing to explain to people."
"995140","996060"," They don't want to believe this."
"997940","999520"," You need to have. "
"1000940","1004840"," If you're looking for the market crash scenario, I know there's a lot of you out there that are"
"1004840","1005020"," like."
"1006000","1008680"," We're going to crash if they pause or cut rates."
"1010040","1011500"," There's a problem. "
"1014480","1015840"," With that scenario."
"1015840","1021620"," And the big problem with that scenario."
"1021860","1023560"," I got to tell you the big problem with that scenario is. "
"1024200","1028180"," We have not cut rate or we have not increased rates enough yet."
"1029619","1030180"," And."
"1031400","1034000"," To get above the rate of change on inflation. "
"1035900","1040240"," Inflation still still goes up whether you believe this or not."
"1040800","1042280"," I know it's some of you are like."
"1042280","1045020"," Oh, we got a rate cut. "
"1045160","1045560"," It's going to crash."
"1049580","1050800"," That's not the case."
"1052040","1053500"," The problem with. "
"1055640","1060140"," Rates pausing our cuts is if they're done a too low of a rate."
"1060700","1064400"," You haven't you haven't done the work that you needed to do."
"1065860","1070180"," And you haven't gotten above inflation yet to actually fight it. "
"1070860","1076000"," And also to stop the stop the rate of inflation going up and you have to like catch up and"
"1076000","1076860"," then jump over it."
"1077100","1078540"," To actually do some damage."
"1080200","1084880"," Now they this is the fastest rate increase cycle you've ever done. "
"1086020","1089960"," Rather than just take time and raise rates slowly over time."
"1090740","1094640"," We accelerated that path and so they're pulling back if they pull back from it."
"1094640","1099800"," Now I'm not anticipating them to stop raising rates at this point. "
"1100480","1101900"," And if you're a bear out there."
"1102940","1107120"," You need to understand that for the crash to happen."
"1108820","1112300"," That you need rates to get above the rate of inflation. "
"1113860","1118580"," And you need to not only break stuff and not only even if the fed is is trying to support"
"1118580","1118800"," it."
"1119260","1122240"," You need to get over that you need to jump over that to get that crash."
"1123000","1124200"," In the market. "
"1124760","1129020"," If you don't explain why right now why that doesn't help you to get a crash."
"1129940","1135720"," Because inflation continues to rage and go higher and they will reprice the market higher."
"1136680","1142340"," To reflect the value of the dollar and the value of the dollar continuing to lose value means the"
"1142340","1143340"," stock market will go up. "
"1143760","1144980"," It's a very simple explanation."
"1145360","1146860"," It's all you really need to know."
"1148940","1151080"," It's an important thing for you to know is that. "
"1151780","1155720"," Until they're until they're truly making the dollar worth something."
"1156320","1158360"," They cannot reprice the stock market lower."
"1159180","1166120"," I showed you the Ford PE's on the stock market where they bought the stock market. "
"1166120","1168420"," I showed it to you yesterday in the stream."
"1169380","1171000"," And they did buy that dip in October."
"1171640","1173420"," I showed it to you right there. "
"1173580","1175020"," I showed you a chart yesterday and said."
"1175680","1176580"," Here's where they bought it."
"1176720","1177660"," They bought the stock market. "
"1179320","1181460"," Not the actual like hand buying stocks."
"1182000","1186780"," They bought the PE ratio trend that's been going back to the 1970s."
"1188980","1190260"," They did that back in October. "
"1190860","1192080"," I put this up yesterday."
"1192240","1193400"," I'm not going to put it up again this morning."
"1194180","1195020"," But I did it yesterday. "
"1195160","1195980"," Some of you saw it."
"1196700","1200040"," It's a Twitter post that I made in February of this year."
"1200620","1201800"," And I said, look, they bought it. "
"1201800","1208700"," And then the crazy part was I posted that because Jim Channos got on CNBC and was bitching and"
"1208700","1212700"," moaning that he's never seen this in his entire career."
"1212740","1217980"," I'm like Jim Channos been buying this shit this bottom ever since 1980s, 1970s."
"1218520","1219540"," He's lying to you. "
"1220000","1221240"," He's telling you one thing."
"1222040","1223180"," And he's doing another."
"1223960","1226660"," That's because billionaires don't give a fuck what you think and what you want. "
"1227280","1227980"," Does that make sense?"
"1228770","1236020"," So right now as it stands, if you're a bear on this market, you need to understand that you want"
"1236020","1240820"," to see rates above seven and then a rate cut."
"1241500","1242260"," Does that make sense?"
"1243100","1243640"," Above seven."
"1243800","1251620"," If anything, if there's a pause right now or worse a rate cut, the show goes on"
"1251620","1254980"," likely in the stock market. "
"1254980","1259420"," And this is the one fly in the ointment that I've had since the last Fed meeting."
"1260120","1266520"," And that is that the Fed is kind of fucking, well, they're fucking, but they already fucked up the"
"1266520","1269740"," whole entire process anyways, but they already did."
"1269980","1275120"," But because of the whole COVID thing, nothing's lined up timed right. "
"1276660","1281520"," This looks more like the soft landing where you get the bounce and you go."
"1281520","1286340"," And basically what they're saying is the MMT show will continue."
"1287860","1289200"," It's basically what it is. "
"1290120","1292860"," It's not, it isn't exactly that, but it is that to an extent."
"1296670","1301130"," But that means the tightening is over for now and we have not caught up to fight inflation."
"1303210","1309390"," If you are not caught up to fight inflation and if you're not going to continue that fight against"
"1309390","1312170"," inflation, that means the show goes on. "
"1313130","1316190"," No matter how you slice it, dice it and look at it."
"1321960","1325220"," You can say anything you want because I've seen it too many cycles."
"1325800","1326860"," It's an easy thing to see. "
"1327040","1328000"," I'll show it to you."
"1331750","1334450"," Now there's like, hey, what about the talk about the credit crunch?"
"1336010","1337190"," People losing jobs."
"1338850","1339950"," It's not good enough. "
"1341410","1344110"," Or it's not good enough how it relates to the stock market."
"1347280","1348760"," I know you want it to be."
"1349440","1351940"," I realize that you want it to be, but it's not. "
"1353620","1360420"," It's funny as last night I was reading a story and someone said, or someone posted, I made a post"
"1360420","1362500"," last night that said, what do you wish would come back?"
"1365040","1366280"," Then someone made a comment."
"1366500","1370300"," They said, I wish Levi 501s would come back."
"1375410","1379050"," And someone else and someone else said, yeah, I went and bought some 501s. "
"1379050","1380950"," They just didn't feel the same."
"1382030","1386190"," And I actually feel the same way and think the same way about clothing today."
"1386710","1390070"," Not only do we have throwaway clothing and throwaway. "
"1393310","1394850"," Trend buyers, I guess."
"1396270","1399750"," Clothing is meant to be worn for a few times and thrown away, believe it or not."
"1400150","1403150"," The whole society built on this, the whole industry built on this shit. "
"1404730","1407590"," If you're older, you know that all clothes used to be high quality."
"1408250","1410630"," They expected to last for a long period of time."
"1411730","1415710"," We have this, we have this whole thing with throwaway, it's called throwaway fashion or something. "
"1416010","1417550"," You can look that at Google search throwaway fashion."
"1419450","1424370"," Everybody thinks it's cute, but the reality is the reason, the real truth reason why we have"
"1424370","1432970"," throwaway fashion is because people couldn't afford right now pay for the fashion or the quality of"
"1432970","1434250"," fashion we used to have."
"1438280","1442500"," And now the one of the comments was, oh, you can still get 501 jeans. "
"1442880","1444380"," You can still buy them if you want them."
"1444780","1445420"," But guess what?"
"1445580","1445820"," Guess what?"
"1445840","1447800"," A real pair of 501s cost today."
"1448720","1449020"," Classic 501s?"
"1453260","1456120"," That's what that and then what's that showing you is?"
"1457600","1462540"," What that shows you is that the value of the dollar is destroyed. "
"1463140","1469360"," It's not the dollar that you see on TV where, or even on a chart where, well, a dollar is"
"1469360","1470960"," worth a dollar or two cap."
"1471700","1472600"," Like, no, no, no, no."
"1472800","1476360"," Your dollar or two that you see on that chart means nothing. "
"1480060","1485560"," The value of the dollar for goods and services over time goes down."
"1485760","1487400"," Sometimes it levels off, it comes down slightly."
"1487400","1490760"," But right now it's still raging higher. "
"1491160","1491680"," Well, not raging higher."
"1492200","1496480"," Or the value of the dollar is raging lower, which means that the price you're going to pay for"
"1496480","1499760"," goods is raging higher, regardless of what you think."
"1503180","1511260"," So, like a pair of 501s is 325, I think, 325 dollars for a pair of fucking jeans. "
"1512480","1520860"," And that is a great way to, or to easily explain the idea that you're not stopping inflation and"
"1520860","1525360"," you are going to be forced to accept higher prices for things."
"1526840","1534480"," Over time, it reinforces that the fraud goes on, it reinforces that you will accept higher prices"
"1534480","1538240"," than a lot of shit unless they get above that rate of inflation."
"1539120","1539980"," That's raging higher. "
"1541580","1544480"," So, I know as a barrier like, hey, we're going to get a crash over this and all this other"
"1544480","1544700"," shit."
"1544840","1550320"," But the truth is, you really do want to see like a rate pause at seven or higher."
"1551740","1554300"," At least that's seven, eight, higher, something like that. "
"1554420","1555580"," And then I'd be like, yeah, I agree with you."
"1556340","1557360"," Probably get a market bottom."
"1557720","1563680"," Right now, if they're going to pause or cut anything like that, they're not going to reprice the"
"1563680","1568220"," stock market because the stock market is going to need to be forward repriced even higher. "
"1572980","1578980"," If you don't understand what I'm saying to you, we'll go over it later this morning."
"1580640","1583400"," So right now for today, four, six."
"1585960","1590420"," Well, the implied move say 40489, 40850. "
"1591420","1593420"," Notice into the 10th."
"1594200","1597800"," We only have an implied move of 40243 and 411."
"1598460","1599500"," That's not that much, is it?"
"1600840","1603540"," Not a whole hike of a lot of range expansion yet. "
"1604320","1610460"," It does start to open up on the 11th, the 12th, the 13th, the 14th."
"1611020","1615120"," Into next week and some real nice range expansion into the 17th of next week."
"1617020","1618440"," Not next week, following week. "
"1620020","1623140"," And then heading into the 19th, 21st and 28th."
"1623220","1624480"," We really do into the fifth here."
"1624620","1625180"," This is the fifth. "
"1625680","1626820"," This is the 28th back here."
"1626820","1628880"," It's a real nice range expansion."
"1629220","1634600"," But currently for right now, you know, just in here, you're not seeing much. "
"1634620","1635100"," Are you?"
"1636280","1639420"," You're seeing balance and consolidation so far."
"1641140","1642760"," That's all this is consolidation."
"1643680","1645120"," You can see it right here. "
"1645220","1646600"," We're not really seeing distribution."
"1646600","1647340"," Are we?"
"1649000","1651700"," It's not expected currently until down the road."
"1653160","1655460"," More consolidation in the move higher. "
"1655680","1657600"," We're just seeing consolidation into this weekend."
"1666950","1668270"," Squeezing higher right now."
"1673840","1675780"," We turn the juice back on here. "
"1677460","1679140"," We read what Bullard had to say."
"1680060","1682040"," Inflation has declined but stays high."
"1682680","1683100"," The key one. "
"1683260","1684120"," This is Bullard speaking."
"1691280","1693120"," Inflation has declined but stays high."
"1693740","1694860"," It's a key point right there. "
"1695220","1696180"," Bullard's saying to you this morning."
"1696900","1699360"," Inflation has declined but stays high."
"1699620","1701140"," I don't know if he says this yet. "
"1701260","1708120"," I haven't read it, but in that one line, he did not say, but inflation continues to rage higher as"
"1708120","1708340"," well."
"1708660","1710180"," He's not telling you that yet."
"1712540","1715720"," He also says the key one economic data is better than expected. "
"1716300","1718360"," The key one economic data is better than expected."
"1719160","1720700"," I guess that they wrote that twice."
"1721480","1724540"," Inflation can be maintained by monetary policy. "
"1724540","1726320"," I don't know what the fuck that means."
"1727440","1730940"," Financial stress can be contained in macroprudential tools."
"1731100","1731800"," Pudential tools. "
"1735800","1739880"," Also lower bond yields can assist in offsetting bank strains fallout."
"1741500","1743280"," That's all I've got on board so far."
"1746280","1755980"," I've got another the U.S. Department of Treasury published a 2023 debt defile"
"1755980","1757860"," listed finance risk assessment assessment. "
"1757860","1759940"," I'll read that to you here in a little bit."
"1762180","1764180"," Squeeze an iron out of 40720."
"1789680","1791520"," DGLY with a nice bounce this morning. "
"1792740","1793200"," That did you."
"1793360","1793800"," I am D."
"1794020","1795680"," I had DGLY up yesterday."
"1798620","1800780"," No dice for TLT this morning. "
"1801760","1805120"," TLT bought a holder's probably thought they were going to get face rippers today."
"1805820","1806560"," No dice."
"1813560","1815700"," You look at the Tesla this morning, right?"
"1815700","1821380"," Tesla tagged 179.74. Right at that 180. "
"1822680","1824580"," That I was telling you about on Tesla."
"1824900","1826000"," They can't break 180."
"1826460","1844320"," They tagged 179.74. Yeah, Tesla's"
"1844320","1846060"," like we go down there. "
"1846140","1846940"," It's going to be really bad."
"1848600","1850360"," It's going to be really, really, really bad."
"1851100","1852140"," We break 180 man. "
"1852900","1853780"," It's over man."
"1853780","1854940"," It's like aliens."
"1855380","1855980"," It's over man. "
"1856200","1856540"," It's over."
"1859980","1862300"," We talked about 180 last week, right?"
"1862520","1864640"," That nauseam should have bought that dip, by the way, probably."
"1869030","1869930"," Ooh boy. "
"1885940","1889260"," We still have some news coming out tomorrow, although the market is closed."
"1889640","1897520"," We've got the U.S. Employment report at 830 unemployment rates tomorrow at 830 average hourly"
"1897520","1898100"," wages."
"1899460","1901920"," We've got consumer credit at 3 tomorrow. "
"1905810","1906950"," Nothing on Tuesday."
"1907330","1909870"," We've got the NFIB authorized index on Tuesday."
"1910490","1911830"," Monday we've got wholesale inventories. "
"1912930","1916090"," We've got CPI though on Wednesday the 12th."
"1916490","1917310"," A whole bunch of CPI shit."
"1917510","1918150"," PPI on Thursday. "
"1918590","1918990"," That's a good one."
"1919490","1922670"," A bunch of nice ball next week on Wednesday, Thursday."
"1926180","1930920"," Retail sales on Friday. "
"1932100","1934740"," Inventories, consumer sentiments on Friday as well."
"1956640","1960740"," On the 12th we've got, looks like we've got the FLC minutes on April 12th."
"1960820","1962200"," So keep that under calendar as well. "
"1969720","1970520"," So there you go."
"1970560","1971260"," Last day of the week."
"1971720","1973180"," This is your last day of the week. "
"1973340","1975560"," The last day of the week here is your move, right?"
"1975820","1978220"," In and out before 1030."
"1979640","1982220"," Everybody goes and watches the masters now."
"1982220","1984260"," At lower price range tag. "
"1984300","1985220"," Basically tag."
"1985760","1986660"," This morning."
"2003330","2004890"," As withdrawn from. "
"2005210","2005890"," According to a statement."
"2006270","2009370"," He was taking the field from 88 participants down to 87."
"2009610","2010350"," He addressed the joint meeting. "
"2010730","2011630"," He said at the decision."
"2011810","2015470"," We are waiting to hear the reason he is citing."
"2016130","2016690"," And when we know. "
"2017090","2017550"," Oh yeah."
"2019390","2023000"," Important point here with."
"2023940","2026680"," The folks at home is choosing your weapons. "
"2026680","2030200"," So to speak, Michael, which which is you bring to Augusta National."
"2030700","2034760"," And we saw all the players trying to keep those wedges clean and dry."
"2035040","2037160"," But you also want to have the right equipment. "
"2037780","2038960"," And in some cases, play."
"2040320","2042140"," We can get this up and roll in this morning."
"2042380","2042620"," I am. "
"2042740","2046760"," George, Eva says low productivity is holding global growth back."
"2048760","2049920"," Clean and dry."
"2050219","2052320"," But you also want to have the right equipment. "
"2052320","2057880"," And in some cases, players will tailor their bag to this incredible tournament."
"2058260","2061540"," So he's working on a 130 yard shot here."
"2062060","2063139"," That first one was 132. "
"2063600","2065100"," This is who we can do this morning here."
"2067060","2074460"," You see that record of 2017 2022 PCH championship."
"2074679","2075159"," Hold on here. "
"2075219","2077500"," He also won the 2021 players championship."
"2079179","2082139"," And it really seems to be getting more and more comfortable."
"2082139","2084679"," Every time he plays Augusta National Golf Club. "
"2085040","2086400"," Last year, that tie for eighth."
"2087100","2088659"," They called it a back door, top 10."
"2088800","2089960"," He opened with a round of 76. "
"2091219","2093860"," So clawed his way back into contention."
"2094300","2097280"," Yes, the tournament belonged to Scotty Scheffler throughout that final round."
"2099020","2101920"," But an eighth place finish for Justin Thomas. "
"2102260","2104820"," They can fuel perhaps in confidence for this year."
"2105840","2107600"," Let's see if we can do this all as they get."
"2112140","2116800"," And now a master's champion will continue to watch him warm up for his practice. "
"2117160","2118240"," Or for his tea time."
"2118460","2120060"," But right now we send it."
"2121500","2122420"," Hold on here. "
"2123000","2124660"," Yes, here with Cameron Young."
"2124920","2126080"," And this is your second master's."
"2126160","2127860"," But your first with paltasoria on the bag. "
"2128120","2128460"," Just curious."
"2129480","2129860"," What kind of."
"2130380","2131560"," Don't want to say it. "
"2131560","2132620"," At a place like this."
"2133400","2134960"," He brings a ton of confidence for sure."
"2135360","2137340"," I think this is his 21st master's. "
"2137340","2138820"," So he brings a ton of course knowledge."
"2139760","2141720"," And we've had a really, really nice three days of prep."
"2142100","2143200"," Just kind of out there. "
"2143940","2145780"," Listen to him trying to learn where I can."
"2146280","2147200"," And I think he'll be."

"2161460","2163500"," Mostly just trying to commit to a plan."
"2164940","2167440"," It's a place that I think you have to play conservatively a lot."
"2167680","2169240"," And then every once in a while you're going to get some chances. "
"2169580","2173740"," So I think really just trying to stay committed to kind of how we want to play the golf course."
"2174480","2177660"," And knowing that you're playing the master's at Augusta."
"2178020","2179200"," But it's also still this golf. "
"2179600","2181620"," So we're just going to go try to try to do what we do every day."
"2181960","2182700"," It's just golf."
"2183020","2183540"," I like that. "
"2183700","2184380"," It's just golf."
"2184760","2185480"," Thank you for the time."
"2186020","2186380"," Kelly. "
"2186760","2188220"," I wish it were that simple though."
"2190900","2192880"," Justin Thomas playing with Cameron Young."
"2193620","2194620"," We got to figure it away. "
"2194720","2194880"," Hold on."
"2194920","2196260"," Let me see if we can get this cat food somewhere."
"2196320","2197840"," This is a wonderful grouping. "
"2198300","2201640"," And golfers can fuel off of each other."
"2202480","2206200"," If that is to happen, it could be somewhere else."
"2206200","2207300"," Hold on a second. "
"2207420","2211460"," It's going to be a fun change group because one of 22 B.C.F. on a product month."
"2211700","2211800"," And again."
"2212080","2212120"," Yeah. "
"2214340","2215800"," To his team is going to be a huge help."
"2216560","2221140"," John Ron winning his U.S. Open in 2021 and Hideki Matsuyama winning his master's."
"2221140","2223040"," The same year. "
"2223540","2226040"," He's a male major champion from Japan."
"2230410","2231650"," Put that up there."
"2234110","2235570"," Get rid of that. "
"2246210","2249930"," I'll get it up here."
"2250030","2250770"," Give me just a second here."
"2252050","2253770"," The championship of his career. "
"2315040","2316660"," Do I care about it?"
"2316820","2319480"," There's no such thing as DMC laws if I talk about it."
"2320800","2321860"," There's fair use."
"2325520","2327480"," Well, there's another thing too. "
"2328380","2330380"," So I was getting a."
"2331460","2338590"," I was getting."
"2338590","2341750"," To win last year and he held up to the challenge."
"2342330","2344650"," There's some fair use stuff you can get away with. "
"2344770","2346610"," Then there's also like people be like, yeah, you got us."
"2346770","2349970"," You got to strike against her monetization."
"2351730","2353590"," And monetization is kind of a weird thing. "
"2353990","2357730"," I don't get paid enough through monetization for it to matter to me that much."
"2359390","2360950"," It's like a lot of money."
"2361090","2364550"," It's like, I don't know, 30 bucks a month or something, 20 bucks a month. "
"2364730","2366690"," I'll make a ton right now on streaming."
"2367310","2368730"," It doesn't really matter."
"2369010","2373070"," If it turned monetization off, I have nothing to worry about either. "
"2373970","2374530"," There's Shane."
"2374750","2384480"," Hold on one"
"2384480","2385240"," second here."
"2385240","2389320"," A lot of golf course for those men to handle this week, but all the enhancements that have been"
"2389320","2391960"," made be added length to number 13. "
"2392320","2393940"," That being display."
"2395260","2398780"," Embraces and cherishes his place in master's tournament history."
"2399040","2399480"," That's right. "
"2399620","2402160"," There's some fair use stuff as long as I comment on it, stuff like that."
"2402440","2403120"," I got to get it up here."
"2403260","2404080"," Hold on a second here. "
"2404100","2405220"," It doesn't hit me just a second."
"2405260","2405600"," He goes."
"2406080","2408540"," You talk about the pressure and the weight they carry on their shoulders. "
"2408780","2409020"," Source."
"2409460","2409860"," In the country."
"2410580","2411640"," Well, he stood up beautifully. "
"2412180","2414100"," I mean display capture, maybe."
"2414660","2420660"," Now when you watch Hadecki pay attention to the capture of a display capture, where's the display"
"2420660","2421220"," capture at?"
"2421220","2423580"," This is about focus."
"2423980","2431620"," And there will be quite some time between when he is ready to hit this, and when he does hit"
"2431620","2431740"," it. "
"2433320","2435840"," This is as if he is on the golf course."
"2437320","2442300"," And you'll certainly notice that signature pause at the top of the backswing."
"2443240","2444820"," Never hurried up there. "
"2445280","2446660"," And then it all comes together."
"2452490","2455150"," You know, it's interesting you bring that up, Brian, because that was one."
"2455170","2456490"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"2456770","2459530"," Many times trying to settle the club a little bit quieter."
"2460470","2462650"," Hadecki was one that it was almost too quiet."
"2462650","2465910"," And he worked on trying to get quicker in transition. "
"2466490","2469670"," So this compared to what he used to do."
"2469790","2470610"," Good full turn."
"2470990","2472290"," Club settles at the top. "
"2472670","2473070"," Look at that."
"2473210","2474410"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"2474550","2474690"," Straight. "
"2475010","2476850"," That lead lead leg gets."
"2477410","2478030"," Let's go."
"2478190","2478950"," Let's fight over again. "
"2478950","2480170"," Kick off YouTube today."
"2480250","2480790"," They like to eat."
"2480930","2481110"," Freeze. "
"2481810","2483530"," One question coming into this week."
"2483530","2484330"," I had this."
"2484810","2486730"," He's had a recurring neck injury. "
"2486990","2492770"," We hope that that's in great shape when he had to withdraw from a couple of events earlier this"
"2492770","2493950"," year with some neck trouble."
"2494210","2495770"," What stands out to you here, guys?"
"2496070","2496690"," You're 6-4."
"2496850","2497950"," Never had a golf club long enough. "
"2499570","2500150"," Well done."
"2500230","2500650"," It's quite happy."
"2500970","2501410"," The EIA. "
"2501690","2503430"," Do you think you might do all right?"
"2503690","2504090"," That's a job."
"2504290","2504410"," Yeah."
"2505010","2506310"," That seems to be a nice part. "
"2506590","2506730"," Yeah."
"2506730","2506890"," Yeah."
"2508550","2508950"," Yeah. "
"2509210","2511850"," I mean, look, everybody says it's a second shot."
"2511930","2514870"," Of course, you've got to give yourself a chance to hit a second shot."
"2514910","2515330"," Thanks, Johnny. "
"2515790","2519870"," So it doesn't mean that, you know, what you do with your tee shot doesn't matter, but at the same"
"2519870","2525490"," time, the real focus is, and for so many reasons, the change in elevations."
"2526290","2528750"," The simulations of the fairways."
"2529050","2529170"," Yeah. "
"2529830","2530550"," All right."
"2530730","2532470"," I applied for kick or whatever it's called."
"2533250","2535710"," I was hoping I'd get on there next. "
"2535710","2537770"," Well, I'll start streaming there this week or next week."
"2537830","2540190"," I think it's a kick wherever the hell that other streaming service is called."
"2540190","2542030"," That's the key number right there. "
"2542030","2544650"," You have to get the ball under the green bar."
"2545010","2548650"," But you also have to make sure that you leave the ball in the right spot."
"2549250","2555950"," You know, there was a statistic many years ago about champions that had gone on to win and 3 "
"2555950","2556390","-putting. "
"2556810","2557430"," Thanks, guys."
"2557910","2558930"," I appreciate it, man."
"2559030","2564210"," It's not 3-putting that under, I think it was 1-3-putter. "
"2564210","2569310"," Maybe there was one major, a one master champion who had had 2-3-putting."
"2569570","2571250"," It's not more than that number."
"2571370","2572910"," And so you have to- Hey, we'll hop on down here. "
"2573090","2574370"," I guess I'm cool for you."
"2574690","2575790"," That comes with understanding."
"2576170","2586070"," And as Cam said, also, too, on his bag, a guy who's got 21 master's appearances with Web Simpson. "
"2586830","2587190"," You know what?"
"2587830","2590730"," And others, that's a really important part of it."
"2591690","2592630"," Great point, Michael."
"2592630","2598290"," I mean, ultimately, it's not just hitting these putting surfaces with the approach, but where you"
"2598290","2598530"," hit it. "
"2598670","2603610"," I would take 10 feet in the right position rather than 4 feet in the wrong one."
"2603770","2606170"," Tiger Woods will tell you, you don't go flag hunting here."
"2606810","2608510"," It's not about just getting it close to the hole. "
"2609330","2613130"," So you can make birdies, about getting it in the right area around the hole so you can make birdie."
"2613590","2618370"," As we take a look at some of these featured first round groupings in the 87th edition of the"
"2618370","2619170"," master's tournament."
"2619610","2620410"," This is a good one. "
"2620570","2621430"," 10.42 Eastern."
"2621730","2622550"," Thomas Ramen Young."
"2624090","2631690"," You know, back to your point, Kelly, as we look at the 10.45 grouping, Adecumata Yama Cameron Smith"
"2631690","2632510"," and Sun J."
"2633130","2640210"," M., sorry, 10.54. But what I also think is is that where you leave the ball either increases the"
"2640210","2642710"," speed of the greens or decreases the speed of the greens. "
"2642950","2645410"," And when you start playing- You're just saying to get some technical stuff and get it in the"
"2645410","2645870"," background here."
"2645990","2648610"," And making them faster now becomes a problem."
"2648610","2649190"," Absolutely. "
"2650570","2653590"," A major champion, Matt Pittspatrick, the Kalamora Kala."
"2653850","2659390"," A multiple major champion, Will Zalatoras, who wowed us all in his debut here and has been a factor"
"2659390","2660490"," in many major championships."
"2661270","2662250"," I was watching that. "
"2662310","2662730"," There we go."
"2662990","2663530"," That'll work."
"2663750","2668110"," To do what only Jack Nicklaus, Nick Fowler and Tiger Woods have been able to do in master's"
"2668110","2670450"," tournament history and that has successfully defend his title. "
"2670990","2674590"," He'll be with Max Homa, who's won three times in the last 12 months around the world."
"2675430","2678410"," And Sam Bennett, the U.S. amateur champion."
"2680270","2685710"," Tom Kim will win her twice before the age of 21 on the PGA Tour. "
"2685970","2688290"," He can only share that space with Tiger Woods."
"2689110","2689670"," Quite the accomplishment."
"2690410","2695710"," Jordan Spieth, the 2015 champion playing with Tommy Fleetwood and Tony Finau out at two o'clock"
"2695710","2696510"," Eastern time. "
"2698070","2699270"," Never disappoints."
"2702270","2703150"," Whoo-hoo."
"2703510","2704590"," International flavor. "
"2705270","2705710"," Hey, Dan."
"2706050","2707410"," Storylines, some final thoughts, guys."
"2707650","2708710"," You got a sick child today?"
"2709250","2709690"," Groupings. "
"2709990","2713050"," It's so hard to pick who you think is going to succeed here."
"2713370","2718590"," Ultimately, this week, there are so many incredibly talented players and many of them at the top of"
"2718590","2718930"," their game."
"2719410","2724510"," And we've had this chance to see them all up close here, but it's a lot about what happens from"
"2724510","2726550"," here to that opening tee shot. "
"2726550","2732550"," That trip from here to there and how you can settle yourself and commit to a strategy for this"
"2732550","2733090"," opening round."
"2733510","2737970"," To me, my thought goes to, you know, we've had a chance to watch a lot of players."
"2738070","2738550"," One minute remaining. "
"2738850","2742290"," Get loosened up, figure out their strategies, do what they want to do to take on."
"2743050","2745130"," My stream is frozen right here."
"2746290","2747910"," Is the stream frozen on YouTube?"
"2748150","2749310"," I think it's because that's how I'm running. "
"2750770","2788100"," Ten seconds."
"2788740","2790060"," You got too much running in the background."
"2796000","2797400"," Minus 23 BCF. "
"2797480","2798200"," Minus 23 BCF."
"2798800","2801320"," That is the draw on the forecast of minus 22 BCF."
"2801600","2804160"," Show us some downside movement in natural gas following that release. "
"2805500","2807140"," Yeah, I've got a frozen screen going on."
"2807240","2809060"," I've got to slow some of this stuff down."
"2809320","2809660"," Hold on there. "
"2809920","2810420"," Hold on one second."
"2818850","2819750"," Turn that off."
"2819970","2822230"," I think it's more of just running all of this. "
"2822430","2822810"," It's too much."
"2823430","2824210"," Too much data."
"2830010","2832210"," Can you guys at least hear me on Twitch right now?"
"2835270","2836410"," Can you guys hear me?"
"2838270","2840610"," Yeah, I've got too much data running in the background. "
"2841150","2843390"," We might not have the masters after all."
"2843390","2843970"," To the tick."
"2844390","2847070"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market. "
"2847230","2848390"," Yes, so you can hear the volume."
"2848530","2850030"," You can hear the audio, but not the."
"2850490","2850750"," Dot com. "
"2852010","2853130"," Yeah, you can hear it."
"2853390","2854370"," Which is fine for you."
"2854410","2856650"," If it's frozen on your and try to reset it. "
"2857330","2859970"," Let me see if they can reset it in mind and see if I'm back live."
"2867550","2868730"," Looks like I'm back live."
"2868930","2869270"," Just fine. "
"2869430","2874630"," If you just if you're on your end of your video is frozen reset on your end because I just"
"2874630","2874890"," reset."
"2875170","2875710"," I've got a lot."
"2875870","2879230"," I've got an actual version of Twitch in a display over here showing. "
"2880650","2882110"," So like like I'm a viewer."
"2883570","2885750"," You had to refresh refresh your page."
"2891560","2892380"," To be fine. "
"2896960","2897400"," Good."
"2899840","2902860"," Yeah, I've got the well, so just so you know."
"2905120","2909680"," You'll see like when you guys watch people like when you watch like what's that guy's name?"
"2909960","2911620"," The guy with the jet and stuff. "
"2913780","2914600"," What's his name?"
"2915200","2918680"," The guy that like got caught with the not caught."
"2918880","2919720"," I shouldn't say that's allegedly."
"2920460","2925020"," When you see a lot of streamers that stream financial stuff, you'll notice that they don't play you"
"2925020","2926320"," live data. "
"2926780","2931860"," They'll have like clips of things for you to look at or just a screener of a chart or something"
"2931860","2932340"," like that."
"2937490","2938850"," That's why you'll see is a chart."
"2940390","2942090"," And they won't show you anything else. "
"2942330","2943590"," They won't have anything playing in the background."
"2943790","2947470"," That's because it takes a ton of bandwidth data."
"2949010","2950430"," Processing software, all that kind of stuff. "
"2951370","2952550"," I'm not going to go into it right now."
"2952650","2960920"," What I'll do is I'll try to maybe I can just get the audio going in the background somewhere."
"2965930","2968290"," Just turn the audio in the background because I want to listen to"
"2999870","3014470"," it"
"3014470","3014470"," too. "
"3014470","3016910"," On April 13th."
"3044440","3045560"," Just like that."
"3045560","3045640"," There. "
"3094090","3096810"," Here's a good birdie look for Shane Lowry at the fourth."
"3101970","3103990"," That is supposed to go right."
"3105810","3107150"," You can't believe it. "
"3107690","3108610"," I can't believe it."
"3109870","3111370"," So the amateur Matthew McLean."
"3111570","3112070"," Yeah, that guy. "
"3112310","3112710"," Me Kevin."
"3113010","3114750"," So when you watch most of these guys, they can't."
"3114950","3117190"," I'll explain all that another time for you. "
"3117190","3124190"," I have to run a bunch of computers here in the background to have a live feed that's like laid"
"3124190","3125290"," by four or five seconds."
"3125510","3129650"," Three of us will have one more."
"3129650","3131190"," This is the short answer. "
"3131190","3136790"," A lot of people use the cloud service to get stuff to you."
"3138070","3139230"," Looking forward to it."
"3139470","3139810"," And who knows?"
"3140030","3141290"," Maybe he'll play on the weekend too. "
"3141490","3143090"," Maybe he'll catch a little lightning."
"3143250","3143490"," Good morning."
"3143630","3144090"," How are you doing Alex?"
"3144090","3145350"," I'm making a couple birdies. "
"3146610","3147350"," Peters."
"3148230","3150830"," I saw someone post it."
"3151210","3153890"," What do I see above here?"
"3156130","3158310"," Someone making a morning noises?"
"3160910","3162230"," Nice par save. "
"3167470","3170470"," In that instance, better to be in the bunker."
"3170990","3172650"," I can't see you with a bunker save."

"3368180","3369760"," Gold equals bag holders."

"3400890","3407210"," And we'll take a look what we'll take a look this morning at why that is in more detail and"
"3407210","3407510"," depth."
"3409130","3416310"," The reason is because you need to get above if you're looking for the bond trade."
"3417210","3421750"," If you're looking for the gold trade to go higher if you're looking for any I mean the simple"
"3421750","3422350"," reason is. "
"3423650","3424210"," Inflation."
"3427110","3433070"," And the fed did not use their tools appropriately for the cycles that we were in."
"3433310","3436530"," That's what I'll say something you would cut and doesn't reflect inflation out of. "
"3442290","3447170"," You don't want to hear of a pause right now if you're if you're a bear you don't want to"
"3447170","3447510"," hear that."
"3448850","3451990"," You want to see what that last like that last."
"3452870","3456210"," That that trough that has that last dip in it. "
"3456330","3458590"," That's what the that's what bonds wants."
"3460730","3468490"," You need to be above inflation with rates to get that move lower historically at least."
"3474030","3476630"," How is sticky inflation anti bear. "
"3477070","3479430"," I'll keep it really simple for you ready."
"3480890","3481810"," Let me see."
"3482110","3485010"," Let me make it simple for I want to simplify this for you. "
"3486850","3492290"," If apple fair value is one hundred dollars right."
"3493770","3503590"," If apple stock apple is fair value one hundred dollars that's just pretend everybody accepts apple"
"3503590","3505190"," fair value is one dollar right."
"3505190","3510270"," Just accept that right now I accept that you accept everybody out there accepts it just to pretend"
"3510270","3513550"," apple fair value is a dollar. "
"3513790","3519230"," Let me ask you a question now that you accept it and I accept everybody says right apple fair value"
"3519230","3520590"," one hundred dollars."
"3522430","3528390"," If inflation is going up where does the price of apple go does it go up or down you tell"
"3528390","3533730"," me I want to know can anybody in chat tell me."
"3535830","3544230"," Anybody out there at all somebody answering me that question out there. "
"3546290","3546990"," You ready."
"3547410","3550190"," Let me ask you a question I'll ask you more time."
"3550830","3560710"," If the real true value of apple is one hundred dollars today and inflation is going higher will"
"3560710","3562630"," the price of apple go up or down. "
"3566660","3567460"," Oh geez."
"3567460","3569940"," Here's Spencer two over for his third at the fifth."
"3581960","3583620"," Can't believe some of the answers I'm getting. "
"3586000","3589340"," Not all the answers but some of them not going to say anything."
"3594280","3599360"," It's okay it's okay if you didn't answer correctly that's why you were here right it's where we're"
"3599360","3600400"," all here all together so."
"3605980","3606700"," It's okay. "
"3611800","3618420"," We just went over the we just went over how much does a pair of five oh one blue plastic"
"3618420","3620900"," five oh one jeans cost today."
"3622880","3625000"," Three hundred twenty five dollars."
"3625700","3630500"," At one time they didn't cost three hundred twenty five dollars right. "
"3632240","3636180"," And that's because inflation goes up over time."
"3636980","3642200"," It goes up even when they're fighting it just goes up goes up unless you come above inflation right"
"3642200","3643480"," with rates with rate hikes."
"3644180","3645960"," To pause it and bring it lower. "
"3646460","3651620"," The price of jeans will go up."
"3653580","3662140"," The reason why the stock market went up in 2020 in March is because money became cheap."
"3663360","3673300"," So when money became cheap right you have to raise the price of stocks to reflect the cheapness of"
"3673300","3673680"," money. "
"3675320","3679560"," This is outside of fundamentals is outside of also the crap or whatever whether it's overvalued or"
"3679560","3682920"," undervalued when you decrease the value of the dollar."
"3683300","3687940"," The price of products go up."
"3690060","3698240"," So the idea here is if the Fed were to pause now or cut now you're not going to see"
"3698240","3700940"," the stock market go go down really deep. "
"3700940","3704720"," I'm going to go down but not like you're what you're asking for."
"3706040","3710660"," You know go up and down like it normally does but you're talking about a bear is tough."
"3711200","3716160"," Me me as an investor as an investor. "
"3718820","3725900"," When I say I want to buy Tesla at sixty bucks or Tesla at forty bucks I am also implying"
"3725900","3733980"," to you that we're going to continue to fight inflation and that we're going to get the price of"
"3733980","3734140"," Tesla."
"3734700","3740660"," My hope is we get the price of Tesla down to sixty bucks because we're fighting inflation rates are"
"3740660","3742860"," going higher above the rate of inflation."
"3744900","3751200"," I'm able to then buy Tesla let's say at sixty bucks right make this real simple for you to get"
"3751200","3755860"," that sixty bucks for a Tesla right like who they fought inflation I got it at sixty bucks. "
"3756140","3761460"," And then I'm going to make a bet that they're going to pour money back into the system and they're"
"3761460","3762140"," going to make Tesla."
"3763880","3764480"," Excuse me."
"3766160","3768100"," Listen close to this very important for you. "
"3769020","3773720"," So let's say I buy Tesla at sixty two bucks when they've been fighting true inflation and the rate"
"3773720","3774500"," of inflation right."
"3774700","3781520"," So I buy some Tesla stock and I'm going to bank on or bet on money to come back into"
"3781520","3786440"," the system and make the force the price of Tesla to highs again."
"3787320","3791880"," So then you see Tesla go from sixty two dollars all the way up to a hundred fifty two hundred"
"3791880","3797000"," three hundred right not just normal growth just this is just money being thrown back into the"
"3797000","3797580"," system right. "
"3798120","3804060"," So then Tesla now let's pretend Tesla trades to two hundred dollars three hundred dollars because"
"3804060","3809240"," they're now bringing back monetary are they're now injecting money into the system right."
"3809240","3818120"," So I take that Tesla share that I bought for sixty two dollars while they were in fighting"
"3818120","3820520"," inflation right guess what I do with it I sell it."
"3822320","3830360"," I take that now two hundred dollar Tesla money from Tesla right take that two hundred bucks and"
"3830360","3832060"," I've got cash in my hands. "
"3833420","3838760"," And the Fed then says we're going to start hiking rates again we're going to get this money that's"
"3838760","3840080"," floshing around out of the system."
"3846080","3851020"," Right and so what is the what does the Fed want to do what does the government want to do"
"3851020","3855820"," they want to get that money out of my hands you understand because they're going to make this money"
"3855820","3856640"," more valuable."
"3858280","3866920"," So if I own properties they're going to try to tax me right higher higher tax rates if I have"
"3866920","3870760"," a mortgage they're going to raise rates right and they're going to they're going to bet on me"
"3870760","3872760"," having to refi at higher rates right. "
"3874720","3880900"," There's going to be an increase on taxes on my gas purchases or my utilities purchases that makes"
"3880900","3884060"," sense they're trying to remove money from the system."
"3885980","3890740"," You're going to see companies try to steal that money from me there are going to be companies out"
"3890740","3895960"," there large companies are going to say oh shit they're tightening we need to raise the price of"
"3895960","3898380"," goods and services that were selling them to me."
"3899120","3905660"," So that they can be the last person to hold that money as as conditions tighten it's like musical"
"3905660","3906540"," chairs right. "
"3907240","3913500"," And so that entire game means that me the guy that bought Apple when it was cheaper."
"3913500","3917060"," So let's put on has now entered into the Q&A session."
"3917640","3927480"," I have to escape that removal of money in the system so that I am left with more cash that"
"3927480","3928640"," is now worth more. "
"3930160","3935100"," And this is how you create wealth does that make sense."
"3937080","3941380"," So when we're in a tightening cycle I want to own a home right."
"3943180","3946580"," I want to buy it when times are cheap. "
"3949140","3952940"," Right and then I want to keep the money in the home or I want to sell that home right"
"3952940","3955500"," take that money and then make it make more money one of the other right."
"3955500","3960400"," I need to like move weave and duck and weave with this money that I have now made before it"
"3960400","3965300"," gets taken out of my hands so that I don't get caught in the up and down cycle of moniness"
"3965300","3968520"," of the of the wealth of the worth of moniness does that make sense."
"3969280","3975100"," Even yesterday we're talking with Winky about how do you protect your money so they don't steal it"
"3975100","3975540"," from you. "
"3975540","3977520"," So if you have wealth."
"3978820","3980760"," You have to escape somehow."
"3982620","3983580"," Tightening conditions. "
"3985160","3990320"," When they stop tightening and especially if they stop tightening condition if they stops tightening"
"3990320","3992120"," conditions below the rate of inflation."
"3993840","3997920"," That means that we're going to devalue the dollar again does that make sense."
"4013440","4015700"," You know what we can make this simple. "
"4016600","4017800"," I promise you."
"4018600","4021660"," That if right now they pause we're not getting the crash."
"4023100","4024860"," We're not getting the crash that you're expecting. "
"4026080","4028260"," You're not going to see Tesla at 60 bucks."
"4028640","4029280"," I promise you."
"4030800","4032160"," Not at 50 either. "
"4033160","4034780"," I'll just promise you right now it's not happening."
"4056070","4059070"," We're not escaping the rate of inflation right now."
"4059950","4064370"," That's but also is a great time to reassess how we design deposit insurance. "
"4072200","4075660"," Inflation is great for stocks inflation is outstanding for stocks."
"4077700","4078640"," It's outstanding."
"4078960","4080300"," It's outstanding for the price of stocks. "
"4080580","4082180"," It's really good for the price of stocks."
"4083960","4089820"," I don't know if I was I'm not a bear but I'm a bull that wants to be a bear."
"4089960","4092640"," Like I want to see the fight on inflation continue. "
"4093800","4096720"," There are many bulls out there that want to see the same thing."
"4096939","4101120"," There are bulls out there that want to see us to get over the rate of inflation."
"4101500","4104240"," It's about right around 7%, 8%, 7 and a half. "
"4104380","4105060"," I think somewhere in there."
"4108859","4111700"," You need to get above it and make it go sideways and down."
"4111960","4113000"," And until you do that. "
"4113979","4115040"," You're just chasing."
"4118140","4119319"," It really sucks."
"4132420","4134120"," He's saying it to you this morning. "
"4134399","4136080"," I mean he's he's saying it right now."
"4136220","4137359"," Bullard saying it right now."
"4141390","4146630"," Bullard saying right now one of the most serious risks to the U.S. economy is that the current"
"4146630","4148370"," level inflation becomes entrenched. "
"4149189","4153130"," He's telling you this because Nick Temeros came out this morning and he's basically giving you a"
"4153130","4153450"," nod."
"4154370","4156630"," That they might cut rates, right?"
"4156890","4159229"," Because we saw we saw the claims come up this morning."
"4160010","4160850"," I mean it's like. "
"4164649","4165649"," He's also saying."
"4165890","4167229"," Bullard's also saying this morning."
"4167529","4169649"," I believe inflation remains sticky in the future. "
"4169790","4170770"," You don't want to hear this stuff."
"4171170","4172229"," I don't want to hear this stuff."
"4172850","4174109"," Bears don't want to hear this stuff. "
"4174229","4174770"," They guarantee it."
"4183520","4185760"," But we have normal ups and downs in the market."
"4185840","4187700"," It's not like we're not going to get normal ups and downs. "
"4187700","4188660"," I'm talking about."
"4189200","4191540"," I'm going to explain what I'm talking about with you right now."
"4191660","4191819"," Okay. "
"4192359","4194620"," We should work clearly for you."
"4206740","4207900"," This is SPX."
"4228180","4229860"," This is SPX right here, right?"
"4230660","4231900"," Believe it or not. "
"4232160","4233440"," You might not believe this."
"4235920","4236460"," Currently."
"4237260","4238900"," Our true trading range. "
"4238900","4239540"," That's PX."
"4240220","4242420"," I'm going to delete all this stuff here and show you something."
"4242420","4244840"," You had to leave all these drawings here. "
"4247260","4248440"," Lead them all."
"4248800","4249640"," Yes, lead them all."
"4250080","4250480"," Okay. "
"4252280","4254280"," So right now, right?"
"4254960","4260180"," Our lower bound true trading range is 39."
"4263080","4265860"," 4156 true trading range."
"4266480","4270780"," The lower bound of our true trading range. "
"4271620","4272160"," Is."
"4282880","4285380"," Let's say we call our upper bound."
"4286280","4289000"," I guess our upper bound true trading range really is. "
"4290440","4290980"," 4800."
"4291280","4293200"," This is our real true trading range right now, right?"
"4293680","4294680"," That's our previous high."
"4295340","4297720"," This is our previous lower low, right?"
"4298480","4299480"," Previous high, previous lower low. "
"4302380","4305340"," Let's just pretend we're trading this range right here."
"4312620","4314260"," You might not pretend we are, right?"
"4315080","4316040"," Came down here."
"4317020","4318340"," This is our lower low. "
"4318800","4321160"," This is our trading range right now, right?"
"4322000","4324020"," This is our, what we expect, right?"
"4325140","4330340"," When we expect to, if we expect, let's say, to 70% of the time to trade in here."
"4332500","4337640"," And we may have one time we come above and below our trading range."
"4338760","4339380"," Right, let's call this. "
"4339380","4342080"," Let's call this 70% of the time."
"4342100","4343800"," Let's call this 20% of the time."
"4345600","4349400"," Another 10% of the time you might expect a dip below. "
"4350360","4353720"," Another 10% of the time I'd expect a trade above."
"4353880","4354320"," Does that make sense?"
"4355160","4357080"," Over time you see how that works itself out."
"4360080","4364000"," Bears are expecting this and we're in a trough right now, right?"
"4364120","4366020"," Or it looks like a trough so far, doesn't it?"
"4366020","4373080"," If you understand anything about accumulation and distribution, normally we trade back down in this"
"4373080","4374460"," distribution phase of the market. "
"4374660","4376500"," We'll trade back down here bottom out."
"4376880","4383100"," We trade sideways and we typically get a pretty decent capitulation move at some point that lasts a"
"4383100","4383900"," month to three months."
"4384860","4390620"," Sometimes if the economy is really shitty, we'll continue sideways for maybe a little bit longer,"
"4390620","4392180"," but then we eventually come back up. "
"4392180","4397760"," And actually there's a point where you can confirm that the market is now in the new bull market up"
"4397760","4397980"," here."
"4398920","4402180"," Every once in a while we have some fraud that's committed."
"4402660","4406720"," This is all 2008 and we continue down even further. "
"4408120","4408500"," Right?"
"4408700","4411600"," This is the unexpected move that took place in late."
"4416950","4423790"," Currently, if Jerome Powell pauses and we're not above the rate of inflation, I'm not going to"
"4423790","4429610"," expect us to trade anything lower than 34, 32, maybe at best."
"4430890","4434270"," I really want the capitulation move down to 2800. "
"4434970","4435470"," Does that make sense?"
"4435710","4438150"," I really want that like last, last down."
"4438910","4441770"," I want that $40 Tesla, that $60 Tesla."
"4442590","4444110"," And we've already traded this. "
"4445230","4447010"," We've already traded 3500."
"4448470","4449370"," Does that make sense?"
"4449550","4450330"," We've already been there."
"4450330","4455210"," And we can put 200 points on the board a day, three days a month. "
"4455770","4461270"," We can go down 200 points on the spy SPX in a week."
"4463550","4466210"," So even if we trade down here, it's nothing."
"4467050","4467590"," Does that make sense?"
"4468750","4470510"," It means you should have bought 3400. "
"4470730","4473950"," I've had to balance this balance sheet reduction that's successful so far."
"4474070","4474950"," I want to stick with it."
"4479680","4483180"," It's not a, I'm not happy about that this morning. "
"4484220","4487180"," I'm not happy about what Timros is saying is my point."
"4489120","4495820"," Just Timros is telling you, eh, you know, the feds, the feds, like they were wondering, they were"
"4495820","4497280"," going to pause rates possibly."
"4497720","4501860"," So that note from Timros and what Bullard's saying this morning kind of upsets me. "
"4503300","4507640"," I want to see claims rise on unemployment."
"4508100","4508860"," I want to see destruction."
"4511080","4516320"," And I want to see the Fed telegraphing that they're staying the course. "
"4517360","4518900"," That's what you want as a bear."
"4519140","4522140"," That's what you want as a, as a bull with money."
"4523780","4525100"," You need to hear that. "
"4525180","4527580"," I'm not talking to somebody with a thousand bucks in their bank account."
"4527800","4528740"," I'm talking to people with money."
"4531270","4532670"," You don't want to hear that. "
"4532670","4538210"," That's upsetting to me to hear Timros come out and say, well, they were, they were considering"
"4538210","4540530"," pausing rates."
"4544480","4547660"," Because these telegraphing, he's considered the Fed mouthpiece."
"4548400","4553300"," And now you have Bullard out there backing that statement up from Timros this morning. "
"4562160","4565880"," You guys getting all caught up this morning in here?"
"4565880","4566260"," No."

"4587030","4593310"," Now, you know, I, I, after watching all the putts today, I, I play this inside lasting pro."
"4594010","4596330"," I mean, a second here, I want to pick a trade. "
"4597910","4599590"," Ability to see what we've seen."
"4600250","4601190"," Very frustrating."
"4601610","4602550"," He said two great jobs. "
"4603030","4607490"," So the US to sell 40 billion dollars of free in notes on April the 11th to settle on April"
"4607490","4608450"," 17th."
"4610990","4616270"," And the US to sell 57 billion dollars of free month bills on April the 10th to settle on April"
"4616270","4617070"," the 13th."
"4617470","4622830"," And to sell 48 billion dollars in 20, uh, apology six month bills on April the 10th to settle on"
"4622830","4623810"," April the 13th. "
"4624470","4628950"," Apparently right now, Vixx has led up to auction 18 billion dollars of 30 year bombs."
"4637310","4641410"," But Bullard's rates now in the low end of the sufficiently restrictive range."
"4644330","4647190"," And you can see the reaction today in gold. "
"4647630","4649190"," Gold did not react well to that."
"4650250","4654470"," Gold did not react well to what Timaro said."
"4655170","4660590"," Gold did not react well to what Bullard is saying this morning. "
"4660790","4661750"," It reacted badly."
"4662050","4663650"," It should react badly to that."
"4665470","4671530"," I mean, uh, 407 C's right now. "
"4674390","4675430"," From the fairway."
"4675850","4681070"," We have a three trigger cluster on the Vixx to the downside."
"4683330","4686690"," Hopefully get some Vixx crush today and go up there and nail that 410. "
"4687670","4689410"," 408 I guess right up in here."
"4689590","4690270"," This hourly trigger."
"4694910","4700040"," Now trading 67 cents. "
"4703980","4707180"," I mean, uh, Omar, I mean, uh, 407 C's."
"4715990","4719810"," We haven't hit the, uh, strike the implied move on the upside yet today."
"4720850","4722030"," It's 408 and change. "
"4723390","4727670"," Yeah, it's kind of a fucked up thing."
"4728050","4730290"," Uh, I'd be pissed if I was a bear right now."
"4730350","4734770"," If I was a bear out there, if I was a bear, I'd be pissed off as an investor. "
"4736090","4738090"," Uh, it's not good news as an investor."
"4738730","4741830"," You're not getting the, the, the discount that you're looking for."
"4747990","4754630"," There's people out there with money and they're constantly trying to evade, uh, the removal of"
"4754630","4756150"," money from the system right now. "
"4756330","4757910"," Do you guys may or may not know that?"
"4758010","4758750"," Some of you may know that."
"4758830","4759410"," Some of you may not."
"4759770","4766150"," There are savvy investors that when there's money being injected in the system, they know to put"
"4766150","4767690"," their money into the stock market. "
"4768210","4769250"," Then get it out."
"4769270","4773850"," But when they start to tighten and then they try to invest that money to keep it."
"4774350","4779690"," So that it's not when the money gets removed to the system, they're trying to evade, uh, the"
"4779690","4781810"," removal of that money from the system. "
"4783830","4786590"," And that's why you see the decline in the stock market too."
"4786650","4788790"," That's another effect of the decline of the stock market."
"4788950","4793790"," Not just the tightening, but the panic from investors, uh, they want to save their money. "
"4793970","4798570"," And then investors look for when it's safe again to reinvest in the stock market."
"4799270","4803430"," And that is when rates are tightened or are loosened or paused."
"4804330","4808210"," And they're also looking for a stock market bottom. "
"4808490","4810030"," And where is that stock market bottom?"
"4810650","4812810"," Now we're not above the rate of inflation."
"4813070","4816830"," So that's not being above the rate of inflation."
"4817570","4822110"," For us knowing that we don't have inflation under control, it means that prices are going to go up"
"4822110","4823610"," and the bottom is going to be higher. "
"4839800","4841120"," Is a board still speaking?"
"4841800","4844880"," Um, one half of it."
"4845480","4849740"," Yeah, I mean, boards, it boards back and all this stuff up that I said this morning."
"4849740","4857000"," So board just said, just now he just said, rates are currently at the low end of a sufficiently"
"4857000","4860140"," restrictive and, uh, range. "
"4860580","4861140"," I agree with this."
"4861280","4861520"," All this."
"4861640","4861900"," It's real. "
"4862620","4864320"," I shouldn't even have to say this stuff."
"4864320","4866520"," Yeah, forward saying everything to you that I said to you this morning."
"4868080","4874600"," Rates are currently at the low end of a sufficiently restrictive range. "
"4875880","4878320"," This is not the news that bondholders want to hear."
"4879240","4884520"," Now he's got to make sure he doesn't make a six answer for par."
"4885320","4894240"," We'll take a look at the fed funds rates and we'll take a look at unemployment"
"4894240","4896220"," and inflation. "
"4897400","4899220"," The rate of inflation this morning."
"4899260","4902300"," We'll take a look at the inverted yield curve as well for you if you like."
"4902300","4904220"," You guys want to see that stuff today or no?"
"4905340","4906860"," He could actually ship. "
"4907060","4907760"," He's got to chip it."
"4907960","4909200"," I think he has to chip it."
"4910120","4913560"," He's got to chip it up into the friend and do the friends and try to get it through the"
"4913560","4913860"," install. "
"4914580","4920130"," The fourth for Chris Kerr."
"4921310","4922570"," Ooh, just missed."
"4923910","4926350"," Almost their first birdie thing down below. "
"4926350","4928370"," Dude, missed by like a hair."
"4929130","4930250"," Chris Kirk, baby."
"4930790","4933010"," Double at two and a bogey of three. "
"4933710","4935990"," The second double at two we see today."
"4937210","4940030"," We just, I believe had our first eagle at two."
"4940190","4943190"," Victor Hoblin made a three there. "
"4943830","4944690"," Let's get it here at the lead."
"4944890","4948950"," We're going to see him at the fourth in just a moment alongside Tiger Woods."
"4948950","4950470"," He's handed softly. "
"4952630","4959710"," But two has played tougher than you would expect in the early parts of this first round."
"4960030","4964070"," You don't know if you're usually talking about birdies on two."
"4964530","4964870"," Not doubles. "
"4966390","4969230"," Rarely we see a double bogey there."
"4969470","4973170"," And then as many doubles as birdies at the par five seconds so far."
"4976090","4977630"," That is kind of shocking. "
"4980050","4986270"," 408.32 is where the pre-market scene of the crime was over here."
"4987270","4997000"," Hourly trigger above at 407.60. Sellers from the top of the key"
"4997000","4998680"," here, here, here as well."
"4998960","5002960"," So keep your eyes on these sellers that began this morning here. "
"5002960","5007680"," Yeah, I think he's going to chip, don't you?"
"5008900","5010160"," I think he has eye light."
"5023810","5025950"," 407 is now trading 75 cents."
"5026150","5028770"," You could take profit here and try to re-enter. "
"5029030","5031230"," This is a one minute chart if you wanted to go up right now."
"5031410","5038560"," That one right there was all about how was it going to hit and grab on the screen to be"
"5038560","5038820"," perfect."
"5044930","5046470"," Mateo Fernandez, the Oliveira. "
"5046790","5048390"," You don't want to see the reversal here."
"5048830","5049330"," Five minute chart."
"5050730","5051990"," Nice and bullish here. "
"5053350","5059970"," Foolish to 407.21 as your next target above here, 407.21. I'm still long right now."
"5062050","5064090"," We'll snap a little box in there for you."
"5064390","5065590"," Make some free money Fridays. "
"5068390","5069210"," Pretty good."
"5072200","5073100"," A little too much pace."
"5077280","5079600"," 407 is now trading 85 cents. "
"5079960","5080860"," 84 cents."
"5082060","5085100"," 86 cents is the longest par three at Augusta."
"5085100","5086520"," I just sold for 86. "
"5087680","5088200"," Congratulations."
"5088680","5089720"," Almost 100% trade."
"5090480","5092680"," Still, we've only seen one birdie. "
"5095200","5096880"," This grouping comes to the tee."
"5097100","5097760"," Victor Hoblin."
"5098240","5100180"," Look for a recheck down below. "
"5100540","5102920"," Sometimes we'll get a one minute chart right now."
"5103040","5106000"," Sometimes we get a check down here just to make sure that we're going to go higher."
"5109180","5112380"," Note that sellers are above here at the hourly trigger. "
"5114460","5122030"," I showed up for Alpha and didn't get it."
"5122210","5122410"," Shit."
"5122810","5124710"," He's got a free money trade. "
"5124930","5131090"," He's got the macro explained to you under an hour."
"5131170","5131650"," Unbiased."
"5140240","5144300"," Got people complaining in the chat that I didn't give them alpha for free. "
"5144300","5145140"," What's up for?"
"5149040","5149900"," Unbelievable."
"5151860","5153040"," One is 10."
"5155190","5157000"," They had a shoply now before. "
"5157500","5160080"," Never fails to impress me."
"5160560","5161680"," It's only this game every week."
"5164080","5164940"," Why?"
"5170900","5172600"," Apple's cranking right now. "
"5181320","5183220"," I'm reading the chat right now, you guys."
"5184560","5187400"," I see the real live chat."
"5187660","5188800"," I've got three chats up here. "
"5188940","5190380"," I've got one on stream labs."
"5191380","5193660"," Sometimes it's live and sometimes it isn't."
"5193740","5194700"," I've got a refresh and shit. "
"5195200","5198160"," And then I've got two other stream chats up that are real-time."
"5198920","5200480"," I've got to bounce between all three."
"5211420","5215760"," I have to go putt for Tiger. "
"5218600","5219920"," Hey, McGryph, how are you doing, brother?"
"5220200","5220720"," Football as well."
"5222580","5225380"," I hope you didn't get caught in that shit the other day on Thursday, man."
"5226520","5227040"," Not Thursday. "
"5227400","5229120"," I mean, was that two days ago, brother?"
"5230700","5231940"," That bullshit close."
"5232340","5234820"," That hole, it's like chased the hole and then blasted north."
"5235000","5236360"," They closed everything in the market and went up. "
"5236660","5237820"," The dealers."
"5238820","5242420"," This shows you how far the watch has left for bogey."
"5243380","5244600"," I'll show you guys the VIX. "
"5244720","5246000"," I'm going to show you guys a couple things right now."
"5246520","5248820"," There's still a little bit more room to blast higher here."
"5250060","5254620"," I'll show you guys this so you can put your own risk on or decide for yourself what you guys"
"5254620","5255480"," think you want to do. "
"5259420","5262800"," If you're still long here trying to get this trade higher, there's still a trade here."
"5262900","5264000"," This is the spy right now."
"5265900","5267300"," Very bullish right here. "
"5267420","5269640"," It's why you don't price is above the one in the five minute."
"5269800","5276180"," The target above is 407.59. We oftentimes though won't go straight into it."
"5277160","5279780"," Oftentimes it won't blast directly into it. "
"5280260","5281420"," Woof, right up in here."
"5282580","5286960"," We also have this previous high below here at 407.20 to pay attention to."
"5286960","5289680"," You saw the first rejection right here. "
"5289920","5291780"," I want pay attention to three things right."
"5292100","5293540"," First rejection we already had."
"5293700","5299700"," Second rejection is above at 407.30.20. And then ultimately of course the back check here. "
"5300020","5304220"," This will give you the kick ass trade higher to 407.60 here."
"5305140","5307340"," If the one in the five continue up higher."
"5308300","5310900"," Now with all that said, here we go. "
"5311100","5311800"," Trade higher now."
"5313100","5314820"," Now with all that said, the VIX."
"5318130","5321030"," Now what is this telling you about Friday and the VIX?"
"5322750","5326890"," It's telling you to expect the VIX to bloodbath today. "
"5327030","5327990"," At least it looks like it, right?"
"5328110","5328990"," It's going to bloodbath today."
"5330450","5333450"," We have this previous low down here at $19."
"5334170","5339690"," VIX is now at $19.12. You're going to expect a buy here in the VIX shortly. "
"5340130","5340730"," It's very soon."
"5342390","5345650"," And because it's Friday, maybe we sell the VIX into the weekend."
"5346210","5348690"," That doesn't mean it's over for bears either. "
"5351380","5354140"," If anything, it'd probably buy some puts over the weekend."
"5354580","5357120"," After the great car saved for the shameless power."
"5358280","5359000"," And here's the key. "
"5359260","5364200"," If VIX goes screaming higher on a Friday, I'd be like, yeah, I'm going to go buy some calls over"
"5364200","5364540"," the weekend."
"5365780","5369700"," If the VIX goes to the shitter on a Friday, I'm going to be like, yeah, I'm probably going to"
"5369700","5372000"," buy some puts on Friday clothes."
"5372380","5372620"," Make sense?"
"5373800","5376260"," Now you do have to wander and structure. "
"5378500","5380860"," Over this weekend, we got three days, right?"
"5381100","5382640"," It's like five days of theta burn."
"5383440","5387880"," So you're either going to buy some puts that are like a month out, two months out, three months"
"5387880","5391900"," out, or you're going to buy some put spreads, maybe."
"5393080","5393920"," Ratio spreads. "
"5399940","5401460"," That's an aggressive level of alpha."
"5404000","5408100"," I really want to know what you guys think, because the reason I'm asking you guys to tell me in"
"5408100","5415220"," the chat is because I want to know your finer understanding of the..."

"6480060","6481360"," Probably the time to start selling."
"6483520","6487480"," Get people on social media screaming, buy this, buy that, buy it right now."
"6487600","6489020"," It's all you see all day long every day. "
"6492960","6499480"," I saw another post, Wall Street, Betmod, put a post up there where someone was like, you're fucked"
"6499480","6500320"," when the market sells."
"6501160","6504240"," And that guy is like in the market with 5% gains."
"6504560","6506240"," The other guy's like, I fucking bought 345. "
"6507320","6509100"," I'm gonna fly and fuck if the market burns right now."
"6510300","6511220"," That's a real thing."
"6521280","6521840"," That's right. "
"6538920","6542300"," First time chatter said, you know, I don't think this is going to be a pullback after your pain"
"6542300","6542600"," clothes."
"6542880","6544720"," No, I think it's VIX Friday."
"6546360","6551600"," I think the move for the technical move for the options market that needed to happen was right here"
"6551600","6555360"," for the implied move for the day. "
"6555360","6561400"," And now we're going to get the technical move right here for the options market."
"6566360","6568600"," I showed you where the implied move was this morning."
"6572290","6574990"," I think you're going to see that implied move get tagged. "
"6578780","6580140"," And both sides will print."
"6580640","6581180"," That's what I think."
"6582660","6587740"," And the way that it's looking right now is looking like they might try to close the gap above and"
"6587740","6592740"," get VIX low so that we can sell the market into next week over there. "
"6593580","6594540"," That's what it looks like."
"6596060","6597640"," So far, that's what it looks like."
"6604490","6605370"," Good question. "
"6611090","6615690"," Why do you feel like the elevator doors are opened up and bears are getting inside?"
"6626350","6629890"," The reason that you fit the reason that you should feel like this."
"6630190","6631610"," Okay, so it before today."
"6633230","6634510"," You should know. "
"6634510","6636490"," So this is the simple."
"6636490","6637630"," This is the simple answer."
"6639510","6641710"," When we came into January, right?"
"6642770","6644510"," We made videos on this, right?"
"6644710","6648250"," You come into January and everyone's on same page. "
"6648310","6649770"," It's like, okay, here's the deal."
"6651790","6653550"," We go through 2022."
"6654010","6656170"," Come into January one and we're like, okay, here's the deal. "
"6656910","6658050"," The feds on our side."
"6659370","6660630"," The fed is fighting inflation."
"6661710","6662890"," They're doing demand destruction. "
"6663750","6666690"," They're working on a job market."
"6667190","6667370"," Right?"
"6667610","6668270"," They're doing all this work."
"6669970","6670710"," Tightening credit. "
"6671230","6672410"," All these other things, right?"
"6673450","6678110"," We haven't seen all of the good results that we're looking for for the market to crash to an actual"
"6678110","6679250"," bottom instead of trade sideways."
"6685750","6688170"," But we're on the same team."
"6688390","6688630"," Everybody. "
"6688930","6690350"," The entire market's on the same team."
"6690490","6692710"," We're all trading sideways and wondering what's going to happen next."
"6694450","6696870"," Feds telling you all these people are saying they're going to cut. "
"6697010","6697510"," We're not going to cut."
"6697650","6698330"," We're staying the course."
"6699210","6699990"," Everybody's like, Sharon. "
"6700050","6700370"," Whoo."
"6700470","6700630"," Yeah."
"6700790","6700910"," Right. "
"6701110","6701670"," Let's keep doing it."
"6703530","6706370"," We came to the first of the year and we're like, hey, we're probably going to trade sideways."
"6707790","6708430"," Into 2023. "
"6709890","6712490"," And we're going to expect the fed to do its job."
"6713130","6714730"," By the end of 2023."
"6717150","6718550"," That's what the expectation is. "
"6725670","6728450"," So everybody's like, hey, we're going to buy bonds."
"6729230","6731090"," High quality bonds on any low."
"6731830","6733050"," The rest of this year. "
"6734090","6734890"," 2023, right?"
"6736010","6737730"," Remember all those conversations we had?"
"6738350","6741330"," Tons of them over and over and over and over and over and over."
"6744740","6746140"," We're all on the same page."
"6747180","6748940"," So TLT goes down a hundred bucks. "
"6749060","6749940"," You buy some, right?"
"6750400","6751080"," High quality bonds."
"6753860","6754340"," Right."
"6754340","6755560"," It goes down there again. "
"6755720","6756260"," You buy some more."
"6756820","6757960"," You buy it physically."
"6758180","6758480"," You buy it. "
"6758520","6758960"," You buy it."
"6759080","6759640"," I own it."
"6759760","6760040"," I own it. "
"6761760","6764300"," Times passing, times passing in 2023."
"6765460","6766660"," Everyone's on the same page."
"6771200","6774160"," And the first nail in the coffin. "
"6774860","6778980"," The real true first nail in the coffin was when we had the fed had the last meeting."
"6778980","6783260"," And the first banking crisis that we had."
"6784300","6789700"," Rather than let some of this stuff fail, they're like, no, we're back stopping. "
"6790500","6795740"," And then you had people screaming on social media going, this is not new money."
"6796240","6800520"," It wasn't new money, but it is money that they removed that they're re-injecting back into the"
"6800520","6800860"," system."
"6801480","6803500"," You can call whatever the fuck you want to call it. "
"6805360","6808860"," You can, you can, you can label it, whatever you want to label it."
"6808940","6811580"," It has zero to do with me as a market participant."
"6812240","6817680"," The only thing that I care about is, is the balance sheet going up?"
"6818140","6819560"," Or is the balance sheet going down?"
"6819900","6821320"," Or is the balance sheet head and sideways?"
"6825580","6825980"," Right. "
"6826120","6826840"," It was going down."
"6827280","6828160"," Now it's going up."
"6830500","6831700"," That's new money in the system. "
"6831700","6832800"," I don't care how you cut it."
"6833020","6834460"," I don't care how you fucking package it."
"6834700","6836220"," I don't care how you fucking label it. "
"6836340","6838180"," I don't care what Janet fucking yelling says to me."
"6838820","6840100"," She can say whatever she wants."
"6840560","6841660"," They can say it. "
"6841840","6842400"," They can say it."
"6842460","6844020"," They can scream it to the blue in the face."
"6844460","6845140"," Doesn't matter to me. "
"6850130","6857410"," 407.50 now heading up into the daily trigger at 407.60. Many of you are still here long."
"6858110","6860950"," This is the place to take profit."
"6861450","6862970"," Even if we blast through this. "
"6869640","6874860"," Now trading 407.53. 407.54. Beautiful trade right here by the way."
"6875600","6881940"," 407.57. Coming into this brief resistance here trying to poke its head above the hourly trigger."
"6883340","6885340"," Almost a perfect pin strike right there. "
"6886860","6888680"," Now the contract got broken."
"6889220","6895640"," The contract with all of us was broken when they back when they when they when they when they when"
"6895640","6898380"," they when they not back when they supported bank the regional bank."
"6898380","6901000"," And risky money banks. "
"6902820","6906020"," The moment that happened the gig was up right we saw."
"6907760","6913220"," We saw money sloshing around again and we saw all of the inflation work that we had done."
"6914520","6917260"," We see we saw all the inflation work that we had done. "
"6918720","6924980"," Go get shitcanned in like two weeks right all that hard work gone going to two weeks."
"6932250","6935730"," So the agreement was broken at that point with the Fed."
"6939050","6941130"," We're not all on the same team any longer. "
"6941470","6943010"," There isn't team let's fight inflation."
"6944210","6946010"," Team bullshit is what it is."
"6947850","6950430"," 407 sees if you took that full trade. "
"6953580","6956500"," I didn't follow you up on this one I was over here blabbing."
"6958700","6962720"," But if you took that full trade those are trading a dollar six right now congratulations."
"6976150","6978530"," VIX is still in a death spiral. "
"6981460","6986720"," It's trying to base out on a previous low currently if it breaks down."
"6987540","6990220"," You will see a return to the scene of the crime on the high."
"6998730","7000230"," Let's look at that right now. "
"7001870","7003690"," For some reason I couldn't delete this."
"7009580","7012340"," For whatever reason I couldn't delete the hourly trigger from yesterday."
"7012940","7014540"," I don't know why that is. "
"7015560","7017640"," It's like frozen on my screen over here."
"7018540","7020500"," This is the daily hourly trigger from yesterday."
"7021000","7021740"," Here it is today. "
"7022100","7023160"," So just disregard this."
"7024000","7025180"," This green box."
"7025360","7027320"," I'm having some technical issues on my end. "
"7028060","7030420"," But I do want you to see where the scene of the crime is."
"7031180","7032120"," That's right here."
"7033560","7035480"," There's another one right here. "
"7035960","7038180"," This is right where the screen box is."
"7038380","7039480"," There's a scene of the crime there."
"7040160","7041600"," And there's a scene of the crime above. "
"7048770","7054750"," And there's more to the scene of this crime because we just want to say this because you've got"
"7054750","7055810"," these sellers right here."
"7059450","7061370"," And it goes on and on all the way up."
"7064820","7066680"," I don't think we get up here at the end of today. "
"7066740","7067140"," It's possible."
"7068540","7070820"," I just want you to know that at our one."
"7071060","7071380"," There's one. "
"7071660","7072040"," Our two."
"7072140","7072740"," There's one too."
"7073240","7074240"," I should have put that one there. "
"7074300","7075080"," That's the halfway point."
"7075660","7077080"," I was hoping to get back there yesterday."
"7083980","7086840"," If price is able to get above the hourly trigger here. "
"7089980","7094160"," I do want you to know that if price gets above the early trigger this trigger right here."
"7097730","7099130"," I'm going to show it to a different way."
"7103260","7105000"," It's going to start getting squeezy. "
"7105000","7114950"," And this"
"7114950","7117890"," is what I want you to pay attention to here."
"7119410","7122730"," So this combination right here."
"7124530","7126970"," One minute five minute hourly. "
"7127850","7129850"," If price is able to get above and hold."
"7131170","7133090"," We will start really blasting."
"7133290","7135590"," You'll see shorts get get wrecked in here. "
"7137150","7139930"," This is the next major trade right here to go higher."
"7139930","7141970"," So if price is able to get above."
"7142650","7144050"," Retest the one minute and hold. "
"7144710","7147190"," Or even the two to five minute as long as it holds."
"7148450","7151030"," We'll get really squeezy into the close here."
"7154010","7156050"," So we're going to pay close attention to this. "
"7156910","7159390"," And see if we can kill the VIX and get higher."
"7173420","7175340"," It's all about the interplay right here."
"7182570","7183830"," Gorgeous trade right now. "
"7184570","7189530"," Beautiful trade right now."
"7189530","7192330"," A hundred sixty four fifty two."
"7193810","7194370"," Doggy. "
"7196310","7200930"," Closing the gap on high on apple apple could go all the way up to one sixty five zero eight."
"7205280","7207580"," One sixty five fourteen for apple."
"7207800","7209900"," We'll watch some squeeze take place up here. "
"7214950","7216290"," Come on keep on squeezing."
"7217550","7219630"," Come on keep it on squeezing."
"7221910","7225210"," Give me that four oh eight thirty three or so. "
"7225210","7227050"," This is where the options market is up here."
"7227290","7227910"," Four oh eight and change."
"7229650","7232310"," Talked about this this morning when I first came on. "
"7232930","7235630"," Showed you where the options the implied move was for today."
"7238230","7240670"," See the resistance coming into the market right here."
"7245970","7247970"," New low on the VIX right now. "
"7248310","7249670"," New low on the VIX."
"7288500","7291320"," We've seen one putt miss high and it was just barely."
"7291760","7293620"," So yeah there's just a little more than the reading. "
"7295960","7301360"," And it's just a little more it's just a little one half a foot slower than they're thinking."
"7305230","7307910"," So now Justin Thomas on the tee at five."
"7313600","7315540"," He tried to get after it. "
"7316180","7317520"," He was trying to cut it there."
"7318160","7321100"," And I think he a little bit of a double cross."
"7321420","7322020"," Double cross. "
"7322260","7322580"," Exactly."
"7322920","7323780"," I'm pretty sure."
"7323800","7326380"," Well man boards now just throwing shit against the wall. "
"7326480","7327540"," He'd be unhappy because he knows."
"7327920","7329980"," Board now taking the bare stance on the market."
"7330420","7335000"," Boards now just paint the walls with speaking out of both sides of his mouth. "
"7335320","7335880"," Now Tiger."
"7337280","7338640"," His birdie putt at six."
"7340320","7341800"," Now he needs this one. "
"7341840","7343400"," I can't even read the rest of what he said."
"7343580","7345120"," Do you want to read the rest of what he said this morning?"
"7345120","7345740"," It was disgusting."
"7347640","7350040"," He said that it's hilarious. "
"7350360","7350560"," He goes."
"7355480","7358240"," He said I have not yet reviewed Thursdays."
"7358260","7359340"," That's a fucking lie. "
"7359800","7362840"," Thursdays revisions for the job to the jobless claims data."
"7363200","7364000"," That's bullshit."
"7366560","7367640"," That's utter bullshit. "
"7370800","7373520"," Now trading above the hourly trigger."
"7373880","7375980"," Trading 407-74."
"7376360","7378680"," There's a long way to go. "
"7378680","7380700"," If anybody can get it revved up."
"7381140","7382120"," He'll get it revved up."
"7382460","7383240"," He'll get it revved up. "
"7383240","7383260"," He'll get it revved up."
"7383280","7384180"," He'll get it revved up."
"7384180","7386580"," Now resting above the hourly trigger currently. "
"7386880","7388720"," Getting extremely bullish here."
"7389380","7391420"," Give me a squeeze higher right now."
"7397410","7398910"," That's where you want to be right there. "
"7401550","7402890"," Now back at the fourth on the tee."
"7403130","7403830"," Masters champion."
"7404930","7407650"," The deck should start squeezing up the 408-33. "
"7409310","7412290"," Waiting for the one minute and the five minute to climb higher right now."
"7412290","7416790"," Look for a big old squeeze at some point or a retest and squeeze up the 408-33."
"7419050","7422030"," 407 is trading $1.25 right now. "
"7424770","7430890"," I do want you to know that the 406 pees up to $272,000."
"7431490","7434110"," They're only worth $0.18 right now."
"7434250","7437430"," So we're going to lose rocket fuel as we trade up here at a 408-33. "
"7437910","7439950"," 408-10 right now trading."
"7439950","7441850"," Then 408-33."
"7442110","7446130"," I expect the squeeze to then end up here at 408-33. "
"7446630","7457890"," 407 is now trading $1.41, $1.47. This is the $1.39, $1.41. Put"
"7457890","7459950"," fuel though is running out at this point."
"7463050","7463870"," Nice squeeze higher."
"7465890","7468690"," You know that was hurting somebody out there. "
"7470370","7472290"," Tied for the lead with Cameron Young."
"7473570","7475510"," Tiger will tap in for his par."
"7476430","7477970"," It's by 408-Winky. "
"7478230","7478750"," What's up, baby?"
"7480870","7482610"," How are you doing, Winky?"
"7482950","7483970"," Happy Friday, brother."
"7491870","7498570"," 408-10, tagging coming into the implied move on the upside for the day."
"7498570","7500670"," Really good record around here. "
"7500710","7509030"," Torching 406 puts now for $0.16. Should see a roll at some point soon."
"7509290","7514670"," This is where the magic comes in right here."
"7515650","7517450"," Magic is right here though, man. "
"7517870","7530180"," If we can"
"7530180","7533880"," hold this right here, expect some big burrs."
"7533880","7538910"," It's on J.M. next to go at four."
"7540790","7542670"," He's played so well here. "
"7542930","7545330"," Another player who just seems to love."
"7545490","7546850"," We can get this test right here."
"7546970","7548290"," This is big one right here. "
"7548330","7549350"," We'll start smashing."
"7549690","7552910"," He plays every tournament."
"7553230","7553910"," This one right here. "
"7554030","7555030"," This is big right here."
"7555210","7556050"," Big, big, big."
"7556170","7557130"," He's all for good. "
"7558650","7560350"," Bear rage at this point."
"7560570","7564970"," He'll have to play as much as a travel and everything."
"7566920","7567400"," He makes it work. "
"7567400","7584120"," Three guys"
"7584120","7585840"," that are thinking they have a chance to win the tournament."
"7586100","7590600"," We want to see a successful retest of the white and red line of the one minute chart here."
"7590680","7594900"," You have to see whether Cameron Young stayed out of that second bunker. "
"7604270","7605270"," Young did stay out."
"7608310","7608710"," Sandwich."
"7609170","7609330"," Yeah. "
"7609710","7610710"," That's really all you can hit."
"7610910","7611990"," Yeah, I want to take a..."
"7611990","7612670"," I'm going to chase this."
"7613170","7614370"," You can't go for the green. "
"7614570","7618550"," I can get a nice retest down here or down here for a move higher."
"7619210","7619410"," Definitely."
"7620350","7622370"," So he'll be in that patron cross way. "
"7627990","7630150"," Got some calls lined up right now."
"7630270","7630730"," Ready to go."
"7632010","7632730"," John Rob. "
"7633870","7634810"," He'd get a beer."
"7637050","7638910"," We would like to say this is a..."
"7638910","7641990"," He can attack this pin, but it's just not the thing to do."
"7643390","7644390"," Bullish right now. "
"7644990","7646190"," Market is bullish."
"7646190","7647730"," Above the hourly trigger."
"7648670","7650230"," Bull's fighting back on a Thursday. "
"7650690","7651590"," Only one more downward."
"7651850","7653570"," Today left for the rest of the market for the week."
"7655510","7656410"," It's okay. "
"7657610","7658170"," It's okay."
"7658670","7659150"," It's okay."
"7659150","7659390"," It's..."
"7659390","7661410"," There's a lot worse places to be. "
"7661610","7662170"," We've already seen it."
"7662190","7663790"," Vicks trying to hold its pants up."
"7664110","7664950"," Trading $18. "
"7667050","7669850"," In 91 cents, sub $19."
"7671370","7672650"," Vicks and disarray."
"7673150","7674670"," It tears out of control. "
"7676490","7679450"," They eat a blow dryer and a brush for the Vicks this morning."
"7684120","7685920"," Destruction in the Vicks."
"7686580","7689180"," Vicks bulls devastated this morning. "
"7690640","7695580"," Breaking through two previous lows set on the fifth, and then on the fourth."
"7696420","7707070"," Next target below for the Vicks, $18.54. If"
"7707070","7712210"," that breaks, next up $17, believe it or not."
"7712850","7714210"," Woo-hoo doggy. "
"7714650","7717390"," From there, I think B.J. was kind of in the area."
"7719870","7723930"," Daily trigger just ripping down on top of the Vicks right now."
"7730980","7732120"," I'm looking at 408. "
"7732640","7738620"," They're like floating around $67.68. So I got them set up right now."
"7738620","7739800"," Let's see if they stay there or not."
"7740740","7742620"," I'd like to see a quick pullback. "
"7743140","7745380"," 11.52 right now, eight more minutes."
"7748600","7756800"," We got the new high at 11.48. So no new high required, but right around this 12 o'clock"
"7756800","7757060"," hour."
"7757520","7759540"," Look to see if they can get a dip by down here. "
"7768680","7774280"," If you are long puts here and you're getting torn up, we can roll this."
"7774280","7778220"," So if you are long puts and you're upside down, you're put, this can roll."
"7780380","7781940"," That option's still on the table. "
"7782160","7786100"," If the bulls can't fight on this retest, it's possible."
"7788740","7791160"," This is not a good look for bears right here."
"7791280","7795800"," Being above this hourly trigger, if this gets successfully defended, you'll definitely want to take"
"7795800","7797300"," the opposite side of the trade, the upside. "
"7798360","7801280"," Get it all the way there."
"7806420","7810880"," I think what goes through your mind, right when you're at impact, is don't hit a three feet pass."
"7811640","7815000"," When you say, Jeff, so you leave it a foot and a half short, and you go, okay. "
"7815440","7826710"," Now at this"
"7826710","7830890"," point, if you're getting upside down and put right here, you just leave them on and then look for a"
"7830890","7831550"," dip to buy."
"7832090","7836070"," You take the opposite side of the trade, you let the puts die and try to make your money back"
"7836070","7837690"," and break, even by end of day over here."
"7841420","7844440"," See if he wants to move it out of the cross way. "
"7845500","7846860"," It's on J.E.M. Meanwhile."
"7847420","7853160"," I've got a read from a little different angle, but yes."
"7853560","7856260"," Bullard now paint the walls with all kinds of bullshit. "
"7857060","7857660"," Let's be."
"7863170","7867930"," But to your point, it's just to be aggressive enough to get it there, you've got to risk being"
"7867930","7869550"," above the hole."
"7870430","7876230"," Okay, so his quandary here is, does he like the yardage from where he can drop and get a free"
"7876230","7876770"," drop too?"
"7876930","7883290"," Or does he like the yardage better from in the patron crosswalk cross way there and how's the lie?"
"7883490","7883970"," How's the lie?"
"7884150","7887610"," I mean, the lie's going to be with all the patrons going back and forth. "
"7887830","7888970"," Yeah, they're probably not as good."
"7889350","7891390"," But tighter, but you can spin it more."
"7891450","7893710"," But it appears that he likes this yardage a lot better. "
"7894230","7898470"," Because if you've got to go drop eight or ten steps back, that may take you out of the range"
"7898470","7899770"," of the club that you really love."
"7901370","7904230"," So we're going to go with this."
"7904690","7906990"," And there aren't many in the world who are better at these kind of shots. "
"7907290","7908370"," I don't think that Justin Thomas."
"7911010","7915430"," He's a rare young guy that is a shaper of the ball."
"7915670","7917590"," And he's not afraid to try it either. "
"7917790","7918890"," He's not afraid to hit."
"7919230","7921090"," Yeah, so that says a lot about it."
"7921090","7926250"," Yeah, I think the best thing that I've done, you know, is when I've got this whole pass like week"
"7926250","7931730"," or two, I've done better with just leaving shit out and letting it die. "
"7932330","7934010"," And then taking the opposite side of the trade."
"7937850","7941950"," In case there's a reversal, it's been a weird week."
"7942270","7952140"," And that was"
"7952140","7956800"," only two yards too long at the most, almost perfect. "
"7957480","7960460"," Does that make sense?"
"7960740","7961300"," Like this whole week?"
"7962060","7967300"," So whenever I've taken a bad trade this week, when I cut them loose, I've had a chance to make"
"7967300","7969680"," some of that money back and I'm like, look at it, I shouldn't have closed them."
"7969920","7973540"," And then I jump on the opposite side of the trade too and make that money to make money back"
"7973540","7974000"," when I lost."
"7974700","7977100"," It's been a really fucking weird week for zero dates. "
"7978200","7981120"," One under through his first four holes of this Masters."
"7983460","7984280"," Yeah, no fault."
"7984380","7985720"," We had one day of fall through, right?"
"7985840","7986280"," That was it. "
"7986880","7988540"," We had one good day of fall through."
"7988700","7990260"," I made a fuck kind of money in that day."
"7990660","7991760"," We had good fall through. "
"7992180","7993320"," The rest of the week, things garbage."
"7995660","7996580"," Like no fall through."
"7996740","7998140"," I think there's no fall through here, right?"
"7998140","7998720"," Look at this. "
"7999580","8000420"," Let's be honest."
"8002300","8004160"," Came down, tagged the implied move."
"8004500","8004780"," Came up. "
"8005040","8007480"," At this point, we've tagged the implied move."
"8007660","8009600"," This is the implied move in the downside, basically."
"8010040","8012320"," This is basically the implied move in the upside. "
"8013260","8015860"," It hasn't been like a trend day today, has it?"
"8016100","8016800"," It's not a trend day."
"8023100","8025000"," Or as of yet, it's not a trend day."
"8026280","8028260"," This is all Vic's driven, it looks like. "
"8028780","8031260"," Or anything from this point forward looks like it'll be Vic's driven."
"8035970","8038790"," It's really slowed down in the frames and then got back to the green."
"8040490","8041670"," A Masters champion. "
"8043730","8045450"," More than likely has practiced that."
"8045830","8048010"," I think that what helps you do that is you don't look at your P&L."
"8048470","8055050"," I think that what I think, I talked to Joe about this sometimes and I'm like, John Rob's not going"
"8055050","8056450"," to find him in this tournament. "
"8056990","8061690"," Joe and I are like, I bet that if people go 100% in every trade, that's what I think"
"8061690","8062170"," that people do."
"8066040","8068240"," If you put like that, you're going to win a Masters."
"8068680","8069900"," Just chances are going to get a lot better. "
"8070600","8072140"," That was really well done."
"8073680","8076260"," Yeah, that's as good as we've seen from down there in that position."
"8078700","8082860"," Surely expecting Freddie Mac's 15 and 30 year average mortgage rate. "
"8084740","8085880"," Can't lay for birdie."
"8086720","8087860"," That's what I think happens."
"8089040","8093740"," Many people roll that it's like I'm all in, that I'm all in again, and then I'm all in again,"
"8093840","8095560"," and then I'm all in again, and then I'm all in again. "
"8096280","8097000"," That's what I think."
"8098800","8100460"," I think a lot of it's sizing up."
"8106290","8107350"," I just turned it down. "
"8107750","8108010"," Yeah."
"8108550","8109390"," I caught here."
"8109590","8110630"," You're just not used to it. "
"8111210","8115030"," I think that explains 90% of them come up three or four feet short."
"8115830","8117110"," Just not quite ready for that."
"8118070","8120970"," On the tee, our next carrying at the fourth. "
"8122090","8126210"," That's Cameron Champ playing alongside Masters champion, Jose Maria Olathobel."
"8126910","8131230"," Exerinate to normally start with like, well, normally, it depends on how much they cost, and if"
"8131230","8133530"," we're in trend day, 100 contracts."
"8134590","8136190"," Day like today, 10. "
"8136690","8137270"," Add another 10."
"8138370","8140070"," The dollar BCA for another 10."
"8140370","8141630"," Worked my way up to 100 if I can. "
"8142730","8143810"," They start losing money."
"8144450","8146150"," Sometimes I'll add 100 on the other side."
"8146370","8147290"," Catch back up. "
"8149190","8149850"," Okay, don't hit it past."
"8150230","8151750"," You hit it past and you have that."
"8152390","8155190"," And then if I make money, I don't put all that money back into the next trade. "
"8156150","8157910"," Start restart all over again."
"8158350","8159690"," He did make his bogey."
"8161830","8162930"," Six to the yama. "
"8164290","8167110"," And you don't really need to take the entire trade either, do you?"
"8167390","8171670"," If you got some of this direction here, you could take just one trade and day and be done."
"8171870","8173910"," I know a lot of you guys make too many trades in the day too."
"8174230","8175070"," This is like this whole list. "
"8175630","8177990"," Joe did it and I wrote a list one day we're talking."
"8178550","8180330"," We're like, what do you think all the reasons are?"
"8180450","8181230"," We wrote them all out."
"8181450","8183450"," We're like, it's all these things combined guaranteed. "
"8183450","8186650"," So he's not thrilled that he's going to have to demonstrate his skills."
"8186930","8191930"," But he's going to take in just part of this trade here and turn the stream off and come back."
"8192469","8193950"," But you don't. "
"8199450","8201250"," You're like, I want to make more money."
"8201469","8206129"," Six straight mortgage average six foot two eight straight and four oh eight twenty five and"
"8206129","8206790"," fifteen."
"8207309","8209590"," Trying to tap that four oh eight thirty three. "
"8211090","8212650"," We turn to the scene of the crime."
"8213490","8215370"," It's actually thirty two not thirty three."
"8221969","8224110"," Gap to close above at our one. "
"8225670","8231490"," Huge gap up here between four oh eight sixty six four oh nine forty four."
"8231650","8233410"," So that's a drop shot for Justin Thomas."
"8233530","8236469"," Return to the scene of the crime train four oh eight thirty five. "
"8237129","8239030"," Not going to flirt with those bunkers."
"8241809","8243410"," Four oh eight forty right now."
"8244190","8246270"," Kind of underrated as a ball straight. "
"8246650","8251309"," And I mean, he's renowned for his putting in there, but he wants the guy playing."
"8251969","8252990"," He drives it pretty straight."
"8253530","8254370"," Nice iron player. "
"8254830","8258650"," He's improved a lot in the last twelve to eighteen months."
"8258650","8260590"," I try to be in a thirty delta zero day."
"8260709","8261150"," This is zero day. "
"8261250","8261990"," We're talking zero day."
"8265379","8266879"," Thirty forty delta somewhere in there."
"8267020","8267900"," So stay tied for the lead. "
"8273610","8277450"," Gave a target for Alpo earlier one to sixty five thirteen."
"8278030","8280950"," Now trading one sixty four eighty two."
"8285379","8289200"," Spied out trading four oh eight forty four forty eight forty eight. "
"8300270","8304570"," Now trading one sixty four eighty."
"8305090","8306690"," It's got another thirty cents or so hopefully."
"8306690","8308250"," If you get the stances. "
"8308969","8310410"," Honestly not that bad shot."
"8310530","8311090"," It's gonna come out."
"8311250","8313190"," He knows exactly what it's gonna do with no spin. "
"8314570","8315990"," Oh fuck yeah, dude."
"8317209","8318330"," I'm out though."
"8318709","8319570"," I'm out right now. "
"8319610","8320190"," I'm glad again."
"8320770","8322389"," Well, he'll fly."
"8322510","8323090"," He'll fly it on. "
"8323350","8324270"," He's going down."
"8324690","8325870"," He's going down."
"8326250","8328170"," Hundred contracts hard core. "
"8328469","8329889"," Dude, I used to do three hundred at a time."
"8330270","8331410"," Three hundred three at a time."
"8332150","8333650"," He's the call fucking brokers up. "
"8333650","8336570"," Should be like I want to trade fucking thirty forty grand in a trade."
"8336709","8337830"," I don't do that shit anymore."
"8337870","8340490"," The payment border flows bullshit. "
"8340709","8342490"," You said you're one of the greatest of all time."
"8342770","8344090"," Cause you do you Jose Maria."
"8346170","8349629"," I'll have to do a video on how I trade off my full trading. "
"8350430","8352450"," We've talked about it on stream like too many times."
"8352750","8355350"," I need to make a video so that I cut it from a video previous video."
"8357590","8359549"," So you guys have an idea of what I do. "
"8360230","8360990"," Far three six."
"8362370","8363469"," Four or eight fifty."
"8363830","8365010"," Close the gap on high. "
"8367730","8369330"," Close the gap on high."
"8371650","8375209"," Close the gap up here."
"8376430","8377389"," Close the gap. "
"8379850","8380330"," Good."
"8380990","8381969"," Close the fucking gap."
"8382850","8385389"," He's probably got a fifty two degree wedge. "
"8392340","8395200"," I guess we call that a bad break."
"8395580","8396300"," He wasn't a great shot."
"8399980","8400860"," Long again. "
"8402640","8404860"," Four or eight C's now trading dollar eight."
"8405080","8405820"," Dollar seven."
"8415210","8415930"," He did. "
"8417450","8420830"," Cameron Young one of the stories of this master so far."
"8421410","8423370"," Still early in the opening round."
"8423710","8424810"," This is our coverage of holes. "
"8425230","8425490"," Four five."
"8425510","8426070"," Dollar nine."
"8426250","8426870"," Dollar seven. "
"8427750","8429370"," The eighty seven."
"8429610","8430450"," The master's tournament."
"8431350","8432850"," Dave Fleming Scott for Plank. "
"8433230","8433550"," Jeff Slim."
"8433730","8437270"," Matt Berry is going to be in with you later this afternoon."
"8438810","8443250"," We watch every shot on these difficult holes on the first nine. "
"8443510","8446110"," Victor Habla has not played well."
"8446610","8447710"," Victor Habla and baby."
"8447930","8451590"," His master's career played very well when we saw him on four five and six. "
"8452450","8454590"," He's got a share of the lead with Cameron Young."
"8454830","8457950"," John Ramu got off to a very difficult start."
"8458250","8459270"," Double the first hole. "
"8460290","8461450"," But back to even."

"12256370","12262190"," new either with consolidation for move higher For an open higher going higher does it make sense"

"13428080","13432720"," Uh from what they learned from their great grandparents or their grandparents when they were young"
"13433720","13438860"," So, matter of fact, we just started having people die in our family That were alive during the"
"13438860","13444360"," depression And they relate stories before they died now eventually those stories my kids might not"
"13444360","13449740"," Remember those stories and that information will die off But as I get older, I'm like, oh if I were"
"13449740","13455100"," to tell those stories to people how poor people actually were You probably wouldn't believe it"
"13455680","13467560"," right I think it was I don't think it was a mess up Yeah, you"
"13467560","13472640"," know when you say like 31 percent of people can't wear your contacts of any kind Uh, I'm sure"
"13472640","13478200"," they're gonna work on that tech too Or you get the bear goggles You're like you like the one out"
"13478200","13483960"," of three that have to wear the bear goggles or you're a ludite Right, so 60 percent 70 percent of"
"13483960","13490600"," people wear the contacts Not 60 or 70, but most people A small percentage have to wear with in the"
"13490600","13490740"," army."

"13495180","13498480"," percent 15 percent are like yamish they're ludites. "
"13498740","13502820"," So I think it's ludites It's when you're like i'm not i'm not adopting this tech and you will be"
"13502820","13510880"," passed over They you'll be people walk right past you Right, even today you see some people don't"
"13510880","13522760"," use tech They get by by fine in life, but they're just passed over and stuff moves on It"
"13522760","13528100"," sucks to say but that is likely the likelihood of where we go The only other problems that I see"
"13528100","13533500"," are the only other problems I see along the way here is Uh If we don't integrate with AI and"
"13533500","13538340"," robotics, I mean I think robotics is farther off down the road I think we're not as in I'm not"
"13538340","13546340"," as in fear of robotics that that horizon to me is likely Probably not in any of our lifetimes Uh,"
"13548100","13550300"," but AI is AI is a problem."
"13550480","13551660"," We have to be integrated with the AI."
"13551740","13557500"," We must be integrated with the AI AI will kill us guaranteed And I'm not afraid so much or you"
"13557500","13558560"," might not be afraid of the us. "
"13558860","13565300"," I'm afraid of other countries I Mean like Elon's like i'm afraid of us corporations."
"13565580","13566300"," I'm like fuck that."
"13566300","13572220"," I'm not afraid of us corporations I am I get some of that fear, but Um, my own view is"
"13572220","13576640"," that the us government has already taken it over through microsoft and DARPA's got their got it I"
"13576640","13586600"," think whatever version that we're getting now is probably fake Hopefully Hopefully fake some kind"
"13586600","13593100"," of like Like a like hey, we're gonna we're gonna sell this company and Now you can still use it"
"13593100","13593500"," for the background. "
"13593780","13600360"," They're making it safe what they think is safe for you In the reality the real fair is likely"
"13600360","13601180"," another country."
"13601680","13608900"," That's going to try to destroy you Um, so there's yeah, so the other side of that fair is do"
"13608900","13615620"," we we at least integrate with AI Uh so that we can at least survive alongside AI AI will be"
"13615620","13623580"," our downfall My view if we don't AI will definitely that that's our exes existential crisis that"
"13623580","13627640"," we're probably have to deal with for the next couple hundred years Robotics are probably 200 years"
"13627640","13635440"," down the road And probably have integration with robotics as well would be required at some point"
"13646380","13651720"," Yeah, I agree with that too winky none of his companies do use anything that he's so He's so far"
"13651720","13653040"," off where AI is right now."
"13653080","13653740"," He's out of the loop. "
"13653860","13658300"," He'll never catch back up Never I don't think he will I agree with that statement."
"13658300","13658940"," That's part of it."
"13658960","13668150"," I think that's part of it I agree with some of that Yeah, the Twitter scams, man. "
"13668250","13669930"," I'm over that shit with him 100 percent."
"13670610","13671810"," I've lost all faith in Elon."
"13672310","13686880"," I think he's turning into um I want to say they're gonna do something Squeeze"
"13686880","13692580"," and I are now trading 409 20 Uh, I think like uh, he's like Howard Hughes, right?"
"13693180","13700420"," Best best used by date Best used by date eventually at some point Uh, what look at all his supply"
