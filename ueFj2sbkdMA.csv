"652310","652790"," or two."
"652790","661610"," I got to read this garbage and It's pure fucking garbage You know, I can read I'm reading some good"
"661610","667630"," stuff and then Some stuff makes you know, I got I'm reading this one story about the banks worried"
"667630","675750"," about money fleeing the money market accounts and Money or your savings being withdrawn from bank"
"675750","679370"," accounts, and you know where that money I don't know if you know where that money is going."

"745950","752850"," to the stock market Because you have to make money you can't it's not good enough if you have money"
"752850","758810"," if you pay your bills you pay it on your debt And you have excess money It it's not good"
"758810","767430"," enough So you're gonna understand that like during during like late 2020 2021 2022 um, there is"
"767430","777830"," money just trying to escape inflation and Trying to escape new taxation trying to escape Of"
"779770","787810"," The value declining of money not just for inflation and taxation also um Gout price gouging but the"
"787810","794450"," cheapness of money money gets cheaper over time even if we bring the rate of inflation down Uh, it"

"860310","864410"," on their money and that but though you've got that one argument on one side, right?"
"864990","871030"," Uh, and then of course i'm reading some articles where people are saying Uh, people are saying Hold"

"1275750","1285550"," like excel spreadsheets Uh crazy data about the market and he he constantly um Corla not correlates"
"1285550","1294130"," it, but um Aggregates it for a better picture or a Higher probability For the market is going to go"
"1294130","1300550"," up or down and then produces the results and says here These are my results and it's fascinating"
"1300550","1309010"," how close he is Uh, to what actually happens and takes place in the marketplace Uh, it's"
"1309010","1318150"," fascinating to watch and see And so I want to show you I'm assuming I download this because I sent"
"1318150","1327760"," it to A buddy And he just put a video out"

"1362230","1362790"," Mark up."
"1363230","1369010"," This is the new snipping tool Uh, at least follow my cursor here Uh, so he was showing that we"

"1373830","1376410"," right here This looks like that down move. "
"1376510","1382850"," This is the july down move right here We've already done that a couple bumps along the way, but we"
"1382850","1390170"," shouldn't see We shouldn't actually see, um, a down move until, uh, let me say it's this this is"
"1390170","1390930"," january, right?"
"1391370","1396870"," So you got december being the the maybe like mid November being the down move."
"1397030","1403530"," This is october Uh, and this is september a larger move up into the end of quarter here And a"
"1403530","1411110"," couple hiccups along the way, but what's even more fascinating is Uh, you see Uh, this boom move"
"1411110","1419310"," here In 2024 like a giant move in 2024 and this kind of matches up with the uh, this kind"
"1419310","1428930"," of matches up with Uh, one of the wack off scenarios Uh, we're going to go to 5000 maybe"
"1428930","1437690"," 6000 And this this kind of reinforces the idea That I was speaking about last week Uh, if any guys"

"1447990","1452250"," this is going to result in a trend day whether you know this or not should result in a trend"
"1452250","1458750"," day Uh, so we have a successful retest of the early trigger for now above the six 27 or 30"
"1458750","1464250"," and the 119 or 129 wherever that is Or we're going to up there and retest that previous eye at"
"1464250","1473690"," 454, uh, 45 Now, uh, we're like harping on the same harping on this same narrative"
"1474610","1483310"," You've got, um You've got time And you we talk out here oftentimes about how they've been knocking"
"1483310","1490870"," one peg of the stool out At a time so the market doesn't crash AKA soft landing But then you"
"1490870","1498410"," have time going sideways and down And this market goes up so You know if you trade sideways long"
"1498410","1505990"," enough And then you have people and fed to it going this is the top They're telling you hey, this"
"1505990","1506490"," is the top. "
"1506590","1510510"," This has been relentless In reality it hasn't been relentless."
"1510990","1518010"," We're just coming back to we're just coming back to um, our previous all-time highs on spy But"
"1518010","1522790"," we're just coming back to this place on the underlying tickers as well Uh that have all been"
"1522790","1531010"," reprised, you know, we're not at all time highs with these tickers so uh If you've reprised the"
"1531010","1537070"," entire market And we're just revisiting a previous high, you know, our stock market doesn't go"
"1537070","1543690"," sideways our our stock market goes up and so Uh, even if we have that that's so often the end"
"1543690","1548850"," of the year Uh, you're looking for another dip to buy for continuation in 2024 to the upside"
"1548850","1553630"," believe it or not No, so I'd be wary of a few things here."
"1553730","1559550"," I'd be wary of Um, I'd be I'd be I'm just going to stick with my my my my talk"
"1559550","1568250"," about The fed rate decision that it's rear view rear rear view mirror looking Um, it is it's going"
"1568250","1573150"," to be rear view mirror looking the verbiage is going to be very important for you to listen to We"
"1573150","1579470"," discussed that in depth last week About what you're looking for from from Jerome Powell to put in"
"1579470","1583470"," his press release Um, about is it a pause?"
"1584430","1589010"," Is it uh, is it like are we pausing is 25 bps anapause?"
"1589390","1590310"," Is it a 50 bps?"
"1591090","1597810"," Slap in the face anapause because the market is rear view looking on that stuff Um, it's going to"
"1597810","1602010"," be an important thing right and they will trade it up on that news if it is a pause Uh,"
"1602010","1605950"," we'll go over that in more depth this week as we get close So we're going to go over one"
"1605950","1612190"," more time for you if you don't know what i'm talking about we discussed this all last week All last"
"1612190","1618770"," week we discussed this now that would mean that we come back and retest Uh, all-time highs coming"
"1618770","1628720"," into Uh, let me see it here Do you figure by november we retest"
"1628720","1629420"," all-time highs?"
"1630260","1636180"," November one let's call it by November one we retest all-time highs We trade sideways and up into"
"1636180","1642480"," that into that time period Uh, we take profit at all-time highs Uh, but then there's a major dip"
"1642480","1649060"," by there and whatever that dip is Remember that sell-off is Uh, whatever that sell-off is we're"
"1649060","1652580"," going to buy that dip Uh for 2024 believe it or not. "
"1652760","1659360"," That's your fucking trough That's your retest of trough or retest Of trend we can look at that in"
"1659360","1665100"," previous examples too historically once we get the once we get back that all-time highs We'll tend"
"1665100","1671100"," to crest over it come back down and recheck it Then and then what's fascinating about that is when"
"1671100","1685540"," i bring this back up again and see if i can show you What's"
"1685540","1693680"," fascinating about that too is Whenever this happens like this Now this this dip could be lower i'll"
"1693680","1698380"," be honest this dip could be lower Or we could draw it like that if you wanted to but this"
"1698380","1704420"," dip might be lower here Uh, that would be where you don't get any more rate hikes the pause is"
"1704420","1709720"," in effect and they're going to start to try to front run Uh front run some kind of a some"
"1709720","1714700"," kind of an easing of rates And you can see that boom retest down below and you're off and running"
"1715270","1721320"," One of the most fascinating parts about when this happens and takes place Is that uh, you'll know"
"1722480","1729520"," You'll know you'll you'll buy the dip with some risk And uh, you will buy this dip down here with"
"1729520","1737420"," some risk on Uh and stops down below Uh, but it's a very like this is like a big move"
"1737420","1743380"," that takes place um For this next move higher believe it or not."
"1743820","1750060"," Uh, so you're talking about like i'm talking about a winter time low Uh early winter low retest and"
"1750060","1757940"," start Uh rocket shipping higher You can see the uh, you can see the break above Now if this fails"
"1758660","1765560"," We'll know it if this my point here is that so you see this high right here I'm going to"
"1765560","1769620"," show this to you It's a better way to describe it."
"1769740","1770240"," So you come up here. "
"1770320","1776060"," This is your previous high back in 2022 Uh, you see the failure here come back down."
"1776360","1777780"," Now matter if I can count this back."
"1777980","1780580"," This is november Excuse me. "
"1780720","1790120"," This is yes, november or december November october september August actually this is nogus low"
"1790120","1795120"," right here Now we did have this low right here."
"1795300","1798880"," So it does beg the question is that this one Have we not seen it yet?"
"1799440","1801340"," Do we have an august low and then the push higher?"
"1802240","1807360"," Uh, but the key part here is this this line right here Uh, whenever we break out of a trough"
"1807360","1808520"," we'll come back up."
"1808820","1815040"," We'll get that last sell off there Uh, now if this confirms if there's a place to buy the dip"
"1815040","1822940"," whether it's here or it's even deeper And you buy it here Um, wherever you buy this Uh, if it"
"1822940","1828140"," confirms and starts to move higher or even if you just let this play out here Uh, or if you're"
"1828140","1833000"," long here and get caught you don't sell this would sometimes last about a month month and a half"
"1833000","1839160"," Uh, it comes straight back up and we continue on and out of the trough Uh, so we'll look at"
"1839160","1845940"," this in more depth in detail Uh, another time and find out um and find out what exactly it means"
"1845940","1853040"," Uh for you as a net as a market buyer if it's a successful retest to the downside If you're"
"1853040","1857620"," already long the market, you don't do anything you could short the market But you literally just"
"1857620","1859740"," hold your lungs a month and a half later. "
"1859740","1866300"," You're right back to where you were Uh, uh, previously so it's not a time to panic sell."
"1866480","1873060"," It's not a time to, um Uh to to sell your holdings another fascinating part about this too is Um,"
"1873840","1880580"," another fascinating part about this too is that Uh about panic selling We've looked at this in the"
"1880580","1886960"," past You will know we've looked at this every example in the past if at any point the market is"
"1886960","1893960"," bearish Let's say you're you're concerned about Uh, a market crash or something like that."
"1894100","1900320"," You will always get a chance Uh, there's like a there's like a there's like a the first rollover"
"1900320","1907280"," that happens You might panic sell like oh shit i'm out Uh, but not realize that in a week or"
"1907280","1912900"," three weeks the market's going to come straight back up again Uh, and you could have sold Not"
"1912900","1919320"," losing most of i'm not even most like maybe losing 1% Uh, rather than saying should i cut it"
"1919320","1926420"," 7% or 4% Something like that it there's always there's always like a breath of fresh air There's"
"1926420","1933320"," always i call it drowning a bull right you You sell the sell the market on them We're complete risk"
"1933320","1940980"," off right Uh, you start to drown a bull And they have one or two chances To get out from"
"1940980","1941560"," that drowning. "
"1942000","1943200"," Uh, that's on every time frame."
"1943300","1949100"," It's not a weekly time frame a daily time frame Harley for our 15 minute five minute one minute"
"1949100","1952900"," doesn't matter Uh, you always have that chance so that initial like panic."
"1952900","1959420"," Oh shit You normally still have one or two opportunities Uh to unfuck yourself. "
"1960020","1964500"," Oh, this goes every crash we've ever had every rollover in the marker We've ever had there's always"
"1964500","1965000"," an opportunity."
"1965680","1967100"," You can always see it coming."
"1967420","1980280"," It's fairly simple to see You know, so anyways Yeah, I"
"1980280","1982380"," haven't I haven't watched Larry's video yet. "
"1982380","1988680"," I can't wait to watch it Um, I can't wait to watch it, but Uh, I gotta I gotta say"
"1988680","1993720"," it man like the guy's on all the time the guy gets the ship right I mean he gets think"
"1993720","1994760"," he'll tell you he's like him."
"1994900","1998680"," Sometimes I'm wrong Uh, but even if he's wrong, it's not wrong."
"1998860","2004020"," He's not wrong out in left field He might be like a week off or two weeks off or something"
"2004020","2009260"," like that But we follow that trend that he's he's talking about And I I've been agreeing with his"
"2009260","2011440"," trend for some for some time now. "
"2011580","2019220"," So And in what's crazy about what he just showed showed this weekend is Regardless, this is the key"
"2019220","2029880"," point here It Whether he's right or wrong, right In every scenario bull or bear We've"
"2029880","2039540"," we've said this on stream in every scenario bull or bear in every markup Of a distribution diagram"
"2039540","2048080"," we go back to all-time highs Whether we fail it or break above doesn't matter And we always go"
"2048080","2054840"," back those all-time highs So there is an expectation for market participants that we are going back"
"2054840","2062540"," to revisit all-time highs Now even if we roll or go higher, they'll be profit taking up there So"
"2062540","2069800"," that is a place to uh An inflection point for you being along this market to Take some money off"
"2069800","2076860"," the table and look for some kind of a pullback Either at all-time highs or slightly breaking over"
"2076860","2083480"," So if we're approaching all-time highs, right So the idea here is this I'm gonna make this really"
"2083480","2087540"," fucking simple Um, so we have all-time highs right here, right?"
"2088460","2096770"," Yeah, let me see if I can bring up a blank blank something blank to um Let me do a"
"2096770","2110260"," spx really quick Goddamn it sp So"
"2110260","2118340"," let me bring it to you this way, okay So the concept here is this is spx, okay Concept here"
"2119740","2124940"," Is that we are going to go to regardless of every diagram out there."
"2124960","2134460"," We're gonna go up here And we're gonna retest this all-time high Okay That that this doesn't matter"
"2134460","2138060"," if you're a bull bear Claps bear."
"2138200","2147580"," I don't fucking care We're going up here Now this is the place if you've been long since October if"
"2147580","2157820"," you've been long since June October December March That"
"2157820","2164520"," is the place for you to take some money off the table Okay as we approach there Now you might"
"2164520","2170520"," get a little bit more That's when we break above the trough and come back down and retest To make"
"2170520","2172120"," sure that we're going higher, right?"
"2173600","2179820"," Now the point here is that If we fail the all-time high you're still taking the money and running"
"2180400","2185540"," Only people that are staying in to get above is going to be late entry entries into the marketplace"
"2186340","2193880"," And you're just gonna sit on your hands and wait for The opportunity To put some more risk on on"
"2193880","2201880"," the recheck that we're breaking out finally and going higher for 2024 Now even let's say like let's"
"2201880","2207600"," risky cap it really isn't you put the risk on here if it begins to fail You'll know it. "
"2207660","2208640"," I want to explain this."
"2208800","2214920"," I want to explain something important to you Um if it begins to fail whenever these fail it always"
"2214920","2217160"," goes something like this you go up here, right?"
"2217660","2224620"," You get your dip And you end up getting a failure underneath The moment that you see that failure"
"2224620","2225820"," you have to put risk on this mark."
"2225920","2226660"," You have a choice, right?"
"2226800","2232380"," You're not going to always be right But the but if you're wrong, you're going to know it You get"
"2232380","2237740"," my point is you're going to know before it ever starts crashing down for the second leg down You're"
"2237740","2242780"," going to see the attempt to go up You're going to see the dip by regardless if it begins to"
"2242780","2245440"," reject You're going to get a chance to get out. "
"2245680","2246320"," Does that make sense?"
"2246320","2251100"," So if you're buying that dip we go up and we fail to make the new high to confirm the"
"2251100","2258520"," leg higher Uh, you got you didn't lose anything and into further that point If you didn't want to"
"2258520","2264080"," put to buy a dip down here if you even wait for it to come back up and make the"
"2264080","2277660"," new high You're still going to get a chance too long the market again You'll have a confirmation No"
"2277660","2281860"," big deal if you're like, hey, I'm not even going to buy that dip the Larry is saying we're getting"
"2281860","2288440"," You don't have to the moment that you they have the pullback off that all-time high Then if it's"
"2288440","2295900"," if it's but and we get the new high off of this high right here That's confirming that the that"
"2295900","2303100"," the correction is now fully over and we're going to start a new cycle over here a new cycle a"
"2303100","2310500"," new cycle Uh, now the bears don't want to see this wake or this wake off scenario because they know"
"2310500","2315140"," what this means Uh, this would this would begin a cycle that's going to last about three years"
"2315140","2321080"," three to five years believe it or not Uh, so there's there's plenty of opportunity to put risk on"
"2321080","2327300"," there's plenty of opportunity to not even have to put risk on You could watch that dip You could"
"2327300","2331360"," watch that dip at the beginning or end of the year beginning of the year not even buy it just"
"2331360","2338740"," look for Uh, look for the dip to get bought and if it's back up here and you see that"
"2338740","2344500"," Then you already know that the market correction is over We have examples of this going back to the"
"2344500","2349140"," beginning of the stock market Uh, we get out into that trough come out of the trough and I've said"
"2349140","2353280"," this in this program before maybe I only have said it in the last I think I've said it since"
"2353280","2361960"," october Uh, but I know that I've posted it I posted on that captain's alpha Sometimes we do go all"
"2361960","2369940"," the way down here To recheck a major low but not every time Uh, so not every time sometimes we"
"2369940","2375720"," get above that trough We do a a quick a quick dip buy we go above the that this high"
"2375720","2378100"," right here and we're off and running Bye bye."
"2378280","2378760"," See you later."
"2378920","2379420"," We're out of here. "
"2379680","2385620"," Uh, so there's no requirement that we go back down here to 3,400 There's no requirement we go back"
"2385620","2391320"," down here and test 3,800 or any of that shit Zero requirement that we do that."
"2391680","2399760"," Uh, so now this is probably the best outlook For, uh, the market Okay, it's probably we came back"
"2399760","2400180"," up here."
"2400240","2402240"," We tested that previous high congratulations. "
"2402240","2409900"," We took that trade There's no requirement that we do that now i'm going to say something that is"
"2409900","2415480"," the best that is the best outcome Uh, do we get that outcome?"
"2416600","2421420"," Probably not exactly I always I'm a I'm a probability guy."
"2421660","2428400"," So Uh, do I think that that pullback will be deeper than Larry's showing more than likely You more"
"2428400","2432020"," than likely going to get a nice bloodbath you might even get one in the spring time or not spring"
"2432020","2438600"," but late winter February lower some shit like that Um, but whatever that pullback is even if you"
"2438600","2443340"," don't want to take put that risk out there to buy find the absolute bottom on a new market You"
"2443340","2447860"," don't have to if the month if we go if we if we have that rollover an end of year"
"2448400","2455680"," And then we end up coming back above Uh that attempt at all time highs again From this run right"
"2455680","2463540"," here Uh Everybody's going to be along this market Everybody I assure you that what i'll show you"
"2463540","2469680"," we'll spend a day going over that stuff I've done in the past on streams where we've spent hours on"
"2469680","2471780"," this stuff Um, so there you go."
"2471880","2481420"," It's a nice little nice little trade for the bulls Uh How's that a crash coming along for the bears"
"2481420","2482060"," by the way?"
"2482460","2483180"," What is it?"
"2484820","2494760"," 454 right now Uh from a high of 456 42 Great crash of"
"2494760","2502000"," uh 2023, huh And you know we want to talk about something else here too and that is going to"
"2502000","2511690"," show you guys something here So we always talk about We always talk about some some key points"
"2511690","2511990"," here. "
"2512250","2522090"," So The one positive thing I saw for bears Was I believe it was thursday Uh, we had real selling"
"2522090","2526950"," real money selling we call it In cash market right in here."
"2527130","2529350"," This was good progress for sellers in here."
"2529350","2536250"," I believe this was thursday Um, this was really good progress for sell side bears They wanted to"
"2536250","2542570"," see continuation of this over the weekend I'm sure some of you thought you'd get that uh on friday"
"2542570","2547150"," possibly even in on uh the weekend You didn't see it on friday. "
"2547270","2547930"," So end of the day weakness."
"2548250","2553610"," I believe on friday and then over the weekend Um, i'm assuming it i'm assuming you wanted the rest"
"2553610","2555530"," of that over into monday, right?"
"2556070","2561050"," You wanted some more real money selling ends today and you know what we talk about around here and"
"2561050","2569090"," then it's fucking time Uh and the more time you spend Dicking around sideways The more bullish it"
"2569090","2575590"," becomes it becomes not distribution but consolidation For a move higher and what is this beginning"
"2575590","2576530"," to look like here?"
"2576870","2582390"," Velocity is telling you that we made a little loop down Time for for a move higher in the"
"2582390","2589130"," marketplace and we're at the bottom of this channel right now on trend still Uh, and what does it"
"2589130","2591590"," look like the bowls are trying to do bowls trying to confirm?"
"2592250","2598150"," Trying to get the hourly trigger to be above hourly trigger for a move higher here You see it right"
"2598150","2605430"," there And this boom move higher into tuesday or wednesday for the fad meeting You know what i'm"
"2605430","2606330"," saying fad meetings."
"2606430","2612030"," So you can already see this happening right now You can see they're becoming bullish right now. "
"2612070","2618590"," We're seeing a retested the hourly trigger Uh with a confirmation Had a nice squeeze above that's"
"2618590","2626750"," that big red one right there had a green bar right here Price is above the 27 Or 30 ema"
"2626750","2632850"," whatever it is you're using And we're looking to take out all of these all of these stops up here"

"2924580","2925860"," found this interesting too. "
"2925860","2935720"," They have rebalancing going on and um as a big rebalancing going on a Nasdaq 100 and Everyone's"
"2935720","2936260"," pointing out."
"2936340","2943580"," I believe 2011 As being a negative for Nasdaq, but they don't look at 1998."
"2943640","2949360"," I believe it was 98 And that was the other big rebalancing and it wasn't negative. "
"2949620","2957880"," We actually stayed with trend in both Circumstances Uh, so there's no causation a correlation."
"2957880","2967800"," There's no correlation to uh, there's no correlation to Uh, the previous example in 2011"
"2968500","2973980"," People are trying to uh, say there's causation like hey last rebalancing we had the market went"
"2973980","2980560"," down Well, the market was already going down Uh, so I can't relate it to that because the last"
"2980560","2986320"," example before that The market was going up and the rebalancing Didn't matter."
"2986620","2991680"," We went the Nasdaq went up if he didn't know With the the market at large. "
"2992100","2996940"," So we're going to be looking for this here Uh, see if this happens the five-minute chart of Nasdaq"
"2996940","3004340"," still has some work to do I'd love to take that trade right there love taking that trade right"
"3005020","3012360"," right there so Still no confirmation for Nasdaq to go up If you want to know where to take the"
"3012360","3022360"," trade on Nasdaq, you're looking for this to happen first You don't want anything to do with"
"3022360","3029340"," this right of no interest in that Uh, but you do have interest in this right here Uh, that's where"
"3029340","3030120"," interest lies."
"3030440","3035260"," Uh, this is very risky in here Uh, but this move right here is not risky."
"3035580","3045380"," So if you're trading Nasdaq Uh, you are looking for First a move higher Then"
"3045380","3053860"," some kind of a confirmation here If this begins to hold, you would long that Uh, somewhere right in"
"3053860","3059700"," there I need to see a big trend to the upside I'll go back and close that gap above you"
"3059700","3063280"," were saying what about the gap down below cap Can we can we get some of that blood down there?"
"3063400","3063640"," Sure. "
"3064100","3070320"," Uh, that's fine But you're looking for this to happen if you want to get bullish on tech Um Before"
"3070320","3081120"," you take a long on tech with any kind of uh, any kind of Any kind of, um Um"
"3081120","3093430"," conviction Oh, conviction Yeah,"

"3134530","3140250"," like, what the fuck is I mean, we talked about this last week, right So I guess we knocked all"
"3140250","3140670"," these out."
"3140810","3142990"," We can get rid of these now It's getting kind of sloppy here."
"3143090","3149110"," We knocked that one out already We knocked that one out already And this was a part of that. "

"3177160","3185320"," I mean I get kind of get it I kind of get the rebranding It seems the branding looks a"
"3185320","3196380"," little dated Uh, and then the whole idea behind x seems a little It's"
"3196380","3197800"," like it seems cool to a young person. "
"3198320","3208190"," It would like if I was young, it'd be like, yeah x man As a brand, I'm not"
"3208190","3215730"," sure And then of course people were people were relating it to um a bunch of porn shit like x"

"3240070","3248890"," I like I also like the the brand recognition of twitter And then uh, just use saying twitter tweet. "
"3249370","3250170"," Uh, it all kind of works."
"3250710","3255710"," It's a little bird You know the birds like, you know, uh flying here and there and telling you"
"3255710","3255970"," stories."

"3302480","3309060"," And probably what I why I appreciate it the most Uh, is that you can find out news when uh"
"3309060","3319040"," before CNN finds out or reddit or anyone else you get it on twitter I think uh"

"5880220","5885560"," when you buy Disney Like Boeing and I want you to pay attention to this one of the great parts"
"5885560","5891380"," about Disney Is um Like right where we are right now. "
"5891400","5898160"," I wouldn't buy this but whenever Disney has like a bad morning bad open Bad day or two or three"
"5898160","5905460"," like so from this point here where we are with Disney Uh, you're gonna be looking for a shitty"
"5905460","5912060"," morning or a shitty one to three days on it It's usually a violent violent move down you grab it"
"5912060","5918360"," and you hold it and it'll start moving higher So, uh entry is important on Disney unless you're"
"5918360","5922620"," buying the underlying Like yeah, I'm just gonna buy some stock and hold it for three months or"
"5922620","5929920"," something Uh, that's fine Uh, the only other thing I would say about this would be or about well"

"5971700","5978680"," fucking 15 We have another morning boings down 20 on bullshit news Uh, just be the other thing I'd"
"5978680","5987280"," say about Disney on a greater note here Uh, I would I would take some Want to say one other"
"5987280","5997160"," thing here Uh Uh, it's nice to see the rotation into the Dow Jones industrial average Um, I"
"5997160","6007120"," see the risk off flight to Dow Jones industrial average for the rate decision Um I'm bullish"
"6007120","6016040"," on, uh, Dow Jones industrial average I just think that with that with saying that Uh, I've been"
"6016040","6021520"," hearing that i've been hearing the drum beat out there with Uh, the drum beat of like, uh, the"
"6021520","6028860"," rotations into Dow Jones And you should be there and you should expect Outperformance from Dow"
"6028860","6038780"," Jones industrial average and less than outperformance from tech Uh from from big tech You see"
"6038780","6048880"," that That trade works For a period of time But not extended So"
"6050440","6058720"," Though there's a rotation into Dow Jones industrial average and it should outperform If like over a"
"6058720","6065080"," month or or weeks or six weeks let's say right or eight weeks It's not going to outperform."
"6065480","6066280"," It's weird. "

"6071560","6075580"," mid caps and Dow Jones and It'd be like probably your money over here."
"6075780","6083520"," I unloved unloved tickers Uh, you normally still have to wait a year three years for that shit to"
"6083520","6090640"," print Uh, and then meanwhile tech will have a pullback Uh, but then like a month or three months"
"6090640","6098400"," later tech is like just still like ripping faces off Uh, so don't Like you can have high"
"6098400","6106020"," expectations for Dow Jones industrial average, but Uh, like their rock is not as shiny as tech like"

"6669330","6680150"," press releases And you'll see that the language has changed slowly over time Now"
"6680150","6690150"," the press conference is a separate thing the press conference is more about um Talking"
"6690150","6699990"," the market down or talking the market up Depending upon uh where the market is Uh, the key"
"6699990","6707310"," point here though is the press uh release is what you want to be paying attention to Those are"
"6707310","6713030"," think those are historical documents If you go back and if five years from now, they're going to go"
"6713030","6720230"," back and look at what was said At this Fmc rate decision They're not going to quote what j pau"

"6739170","6748890"," uh, this Fmc rate decision You're going to go into this Fmc rate decision expecting a 25 vts rate"
"6748890","6760270"," increase and a pause in the press release Now that's the expectation Is"
"6760270","6770190"," a pause from that point forward Saying that Our market is always forward looking And"
"6770190","6787830"," our fed has been more Our"
"6787830","6797770"," fed has been more uh Honest with us Then they ever have historically And they warned"
"6797770","6806070"," us That we were going to get rate increases before they happened right And the market front ran"
"6806070","6812290"," selling down Uh when they told said they were going to get aggressive with rates before they even"
"6812290","6821110"," raised rates they forewarned us We sold the market down In advance with that forward knowledge And"
"6821110","6831290"," the same thing applies for uh for where we are now so From"
"6831290","6838490"," the from from my from my perspective and from what the fed Uh press releases have been They are now"
"6838490","6847370"," at the stage to give us a 25 vps and announce some kind of a pause being forward looking uh"
"6848110","6856630"," being forward looking Uh, it should be received as a positive news event Uh, it should impact the"
"6856630","6862350"," market in a positive way believe it or not Now we're not in uh in rate cuts."
"6862390","6870410"," Yeah, we're going to discuss that in a moment But a 25 vps rate hike And a pause Should be"
"6870410","6878550"," received positively by the market Even if even if we roll over on that news, it shouldn't be deep"
"6879390","6884510"," Uh, it shouldn't be like we sell down to the depths of health 3,800 or some crazy market crash"
"6885190","6886270"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"6886310","6896270"," It should be well received by the market Now saying that Uh, if we do get that 25 vps"
"6896270","6903670"," and a pause We could possibly see Uh the light at the end of the tunnel Uh for the bull"
"6903670","6911150"," run ending earlier than expected So if you have an expectation of the bull runs into Uh, January,"
"6911150","6919530"," February march Uh, I don't see it lasting that long Um, if you get the pause you probably have two"
"6919530","6927130"," or three months Of bullishness ahead Uh, they will begin to want to price in our front run and"
"6927130","6934970"," easing of rates Uh, whether that takes three months or six months to begin to happen They will try"
"6934970","6940630"," to price they'll try to front run Uh, that happening now the larry william's chart kind of says"
"6940630","6945930"," that same thing Right that you're going to have you'll have probably two or three months of um"

"6954570","6960150"," Let's run the market up Uh, and then you'll see a rate cut Which would actually sell the market"
"6960150","6965990"," into that rate cut You might get one quick squeeze up for liquidity and then we sell it down Now"

"7309810","7311490"," through all these sellers up here. "
"7311790","7318350"," Actually, this could take Uh, I would not be shocked to see Uh, the weakness then the squeeze and"
"7318350","7325990"," then down And then the move actually comes a week or two later next week not this week Uh, so"

"7338710","7344890"," So if you wanted to put some You wanted to put some kind of risk on to the down the"
"7344890","7354510"," side it probably starts Between 454 75 and 455 76 right up here Uh, you could start uh"
"7354510","7363050"," put position or a short here and right here For an anticipation of wednesday Uh, although I do"
"7363050","7367610"," think we're getting up here at some point between now and tomorrow Uh, that's up there that 456 and"
"7367610","7373410"," change Now with this set here, uh, what is the expectation for a downside move?"
"7373870","7379270"," If the news is bad, that's what we're talking about here is Uh, what we're talking about here is"
"7379270","7387270"," uh, what to expect from the fed So one two three And now you're looking for a target down below"
"7387970","7393210"," Because of no selling in time passing we talk about time all the time down here, right?"
"7393890","7395430"," Uh, we're now ready for this."
"7395690","7397090"," We were at 440 last week. "
"7397270","7403870"," We had no significant move down Way up here now daily triggers now moved all the way up here"
"7403870","7411150"," because you could not fucking put it together And sell this market In the in after hours and the"
"7411150","7418910"," overnight you had one day of selling You had one day right here That's all you got Because you"
"7418910","7426130"," couldn't put it together in after hours and the overnight and globex You've now fucking have lost"
"7426130","7436570"," So on wednesday a downside expectation if we get bad news Come in a wednesday It's"
"7436570","7445250"," going to be likely uh, 446 So downside move on wednesday Uh, an expectation, matter of fact, there"
"7445250","7450330"," you go right there Makes sense, right Boom right down there."
"7450350","7457810"," It's all kind of lining up now, right Uh, 446 downside move expectation So if you're looking to put"
"7457810","7464490"," some uh, put spread on or a or a uh, debit A debit, uh, put back spread or something like"
"7464490","7471530"," that Uh, and you're looking for a downside target on wednesday for bad news would be 446 40"
"7476940","7486380"," Otherwise, I'm expecting a squeeze On sellers between now and tomorrow up into this 456 Uh, unless"
"7486380","7495560"," we get a price break below in the five minute, uh, 30 EMA Yeah, maybe just keep grinding it keep"
"7495560","7511650"," on grinding it, baby fairly easy to see, right Uh,"
"7511970","7520910"," we could get a little bit of weakness in here Algo mcgagoface 2 has us um Algo mcgagoface has us"
"7520910","7530770"," going up like this And then algo has us selling the clothes today Uh I didn't"
"7530770","7536810"," put it on twitter i was going to but I just left it off Algo mcgagoface says we says we"
"7536810","7550190"," actually sell the clothes today I do expect to sell tomorrow at some point Yeah,"
"7550410","7560310"," there's so let's get back to that conversation so Um That demand being there is gotta it has to"
"7560310","7601310"," be concerning for the fed it has to be Like every one second here one quick second It"
"7601310","7610530"," has to be kind of concerning for the fed right Now you want they have a dual mandate They have"
"7610530","7619190"," this dual mandate of You can see that up there, right got vol still here and then boom squeeze up"
"7620750","7628930"," There's a there's a dual mandate here from the fed like so They need demand destruction But they"
"7628930","7639730"," also want to maintain or maximize employment, right So He's in a rock and a hard place Uh"
"7639730","7646370"," if you've got people out there you still have job You still have jobs available the unemployment"
"7646370","7656310"," rate kind of a goldilocks zone You know the fed doesn't want to hear People taking loans"
"7656950","7666950"," Uh at 7% anticipating rates being cut so I don't I wonder if"
"7666950","7675450"," his message will be geared towards Think do you get the the rate increase pause But then he like he"
"7675450","7683110"," has to keep that uh He has to talk the market down with we're going to revisit this Now if"
"7683110","7689870"," he would put a huge damper on the market Or the real estate market at least if he says He"
"7689870","7698010"," comes out if if I was thinking about buying a home with a mortgage At these rates, uh, I would"
"7698010","7706750"," be Waiting for whatever he's going to say Uh because he says no fuck you we're going to we're maybe"
"7706750","7714390"," pausing here, but we're going to hold these rates for the foreseeable future Uh, I'd be wary at"
"7714390","7732860"," that point I'd be wary of uh trading 4405 65 right now And"
"7732860","7741180"," if he says something like we're pausing but doesn't doesn't give the nasty language Uh, I would"
"7741180","7742660"," want to buy that house, right?"
"7743400","7753340"," So I think there's this like, um You know This this one this"
"7753340","7757660"," one specifically is going to be He's going to have to be very tactful."
"7757880","7764580"," He he can be he can be very tactful Um But if he comes off in any way as uh,"
"7764800","7771440"," my point here is if he comes off any way as being dovish In his presser, let's say he said"
"7771440","7779800"," let's say the press release is 25 bps with a pause And if his presser Comes off as dovish in"
"7779800","7790160"," any way It's going to trigger an exuberance from bob on main street Uh"
"7790160","7800040"," abs to fucking luley You will see people whether this works out for them or not"
"7801620","7809080"," You will see people start to Uh Put money at risk. "
"7809500","7814380"," There's no other way to say it Uh, they'll they'll bid up the house."
"7814480","7822420"," I think the housing market is a bit up now It'll go out of control If um If if any"
"7822420","7835900"," way it comes off as being uh, uh, dovish Yeah dual man date, baby Yeah,"
"7835980","7837480"," I know about the commercial real estate."
"7838020","7850930"," Uh, I'm hyper aware of that stuff And the uh handouts for for bailouts and that kind of stuff And"
"7850930","7851550"," That's tough too. "
"7851690","7857730"," A lot of those one of the problems with that jimmy is, um, they're not built to be converted It's"
"7857730","7864050"," very hard to convert office space into residential I'm fascinated to hear what that what he does"
"7864050","7872210"," because I think he I think it's a poor I think it's I think it's a bad move for him"
"7872210","7882090"," to not be hot more hawkish My personal expectation here Is or my personal expectation"
"7882090","7890350"," what I would like to see him do is give the 25 bps Give the pause But I want the"
"7890350","7897770"," I want the fucking presser Uh, and I don't mind him being kind of dumbish in the press presser."
"7897850","7898830"," I should be more clear here."
"7898890","7905170"," I'm muddling this I don't mind him being a slightly dumbish in the presser Kind of like yeah, we'll"
"7905170","7911110"," wait and see or revisit in the fall But I would like the presser to be or the press release"
"7912010","7921370"," To be a little bit more hawkish Like here's your pause It's data dependent You will likely see it"
"7921370","7926990"," increase In the fall or springtime We're not done. "
"7927630","7937370"," No, I think we need that I am very wary of a Very wary of giving the implicate or"
"7937370","7947180"," given the idea out there to I'm very wary of very concerned"
"7947180","7956960"," with Implying to A young person getting their forest mortgage the hope"
"7956960","7966840"," that rates are coming down Uh, if they're not If you get roped into that"
"7966840","7973680"," mortgage and they keep rates higher for longer Even if they just even if they pause and just hold"
"7973680","7978660"," them, I guess they could do the damage with that They don't necessarily have to raise rates in the"
"7978660","7987920"," future as long as they Um, hold them high for longer That could put some pain on people Um, so"
"7987920","7991240"," if you're like fucking i'm gonna go out there and buy a house and i'm gonna expect that he's gonna"

"8060960","8061940"," didn't talk about this for a minute. "
"8061940","8067740"," It's like one of the things that i've found is um There's a lot of cheap residential housing in the"
"8067740","8077920"," midwest uh flyover states I found some really great properties in like nebraska Nebraska,"
"8078160","8084940"," Kansas, Iowa places like that Uh, some of them are doing some of these towns are doing quite well."
"8084940","8094640"," So But some places people are there fucking mines Like i went looking down in uh, Georgia florida"
"8095660","8105600"," Mississippi on the gulf coast Uh looked in california Oregon, washington Uh, i i i had a hoe i"
"8105600","8112600"," looked at i had a hoe too And uh spent some significant time Um looking at properties and some of"
"8112600","8116720"," these properties you guys are already fucking mines Like people just don't give a fuck they're like"
"8119180","8124920"," They got like houses from the 1970s and shit full rehabs And i'm looking at these are like nice"
"8124920","8131260"," areas and stuff, but i'm like did you want How much money like you're out of your fucking mind And"
"8131260","8139140"," they're asking double Just three or four years ago like double Uh, we're not even talking about the"

"8178450","8184090"," reprising The only way they can think about so this is how disgusting i think this is how my mind"
"8184090","8192170"," works So I'm like well i guess i guess the only thing you could do would be Uh, you make"
"8192170","8202250"," people believe that we're going to get rate cuts And And you create a class of buyers And"
"8202250","8207889"," sellers This is the key trick here listen it goes in closely this is a very good So i'm going"
"8207889","8212190"," to chew it on this for like days and days and days they're like well late night i'm thinking about"
"8212190","8219030"," this at night time And uh, i'm trying to like i'm brain trying to figure out how do you how"

"8356770","8363889"," I mean maintain it like If something needs fixed fixed by a mechanic If something needs done"
"8363889","8372290"," maintain it like treat this vehicle Like it's worth more than it actually is And even over time I'm"
"8372290","8381610"," gonna save by not buying a car right now or trading it in or upgrading So It's fascinating because"
"8381610","8382950"," I could tell my wife. "

"8396050","8396510"," sight of mine."
"8396510","8406470"," Just start making a monthly payment every month to a car payments That makes interest So instead"
"8406470","8414270"," of instead of paying a car loan to somebody else I'm gonna pay my own car loan to myself I'm"
"8414270","8420810"," gonna make some money off of it I'm gonna keep the interest from me And when it comes time to"
"8420810","8427070"," actually buy a vehicle hopefully rates have come down And hopefully there's a there's a bunch of"
"8427070","8435190"," like a parking lots full of vehicles And we can negotiate with a dealership again And like we've"
"8435190","8437890"," waited everybody out Rates have come down."
"8437890","8445850"," This is the j-pow thing, right And Regardless, I'll be maintaining this vehicle I'll get I'll get"
"8445850","8453030"," I'll squeeze every last dollar value out of this vehicle I'll be saving money I'll be trading this"
"8453030","8461470"," vehicle like I'm gonna hold it for many years And I win no matter what I win I win no"
"8461470","8471250"," matter what I don't lose in this equation Now it would be fascinating If"
"8471250","8481080"," If This whole car thing that I'm doing if you could relate that to home buying You could"
"8481080","8489280"," kind of manufacture a housing crisis So right now I'm not willing to sell this Cadillac And I'm not"
"8489280","8493960"," willing to sell my house as either unless it's a high high price Like you got to pay me to"
"8493960","8499220"," to get my house And I'm actually fearful of moving right now I don't want to buy a house at"
"8499220","8505720"," a high rate Or 160 170 percent if the market's gonna come down Prices are gonna come down that kind"
"8505720","8515560"," of stuff But my point here is this If they don't want a housing crash But they do want the"
"8515560","8519920"," how like I manufactured housing crash How would you do that?"
"8520960","8530720"," You'd want to get someone like me Believe That rates are coming down The promise like a"
"8530720","8537340"," carrot You got the stick out you got the line out And you tell me the homeowner or the car"
"8537340","8547660"," owner Don't worry about it captain Rates are coming down You should put some risk on a car loan Or"
"8547660","8554500"," a home loan even if it's that seven percent Uh, and you should probably put your house up for sale"
"8554500","8561220"," and you can move wherever you want to move So let's say right now new home buyers at this at"
"8561220","8568860"," these high rates Let's say these people are Three percent of homeowners right now We actually want"

"8585000","8594960"," Trade in 484 87 67 right now Just grounding higher right now looking for some squeeze The"
"8594960","8604920"," point here is that if all these homeowners believe that rates are going to be higher for longer"
"8605780","8609880"," They're going to go much much higher They're not going to sell their homes. "
"8609880","8618040"," They they have great interest rates They're at zero They're not going to give up their house right"
"8618040","8620080"," and move somewhere else upgrade."

"8628920","8629740"," are going to come down."
"8629880","8636770"," You're going to get people like me going whoo Maybe this maybe we got rate cuts coming. "
"8637070","8644750"," Maybe we should start looking at houses Maybe we can get that seven percent And we'll refie in a"
"8644750","8645370"," couple of years."
"8645770","8646250"," What do I care?"

"8796840","8804800"," takes I'm trying to think like six months out or something a year You start to make people believe"

"9644190","9648670"," that They have high standards usually the state has high standards you have to meet Uh, but you get"
"9648670","9655570"," great tenants and you get a guaranteed check every month Uh, so that's positive My best, uh,"
"9655870","9660790"," outcomes for rental properties has always been, uh, airbnb even though you read nightmares about it"
"9661870","9667750"," If you provide a good airbnb not a fake bullshit nice pictures, but the furniture sucks the betting"
"9667750","9673930"," sucks Uh, you can you can make really good money Especially if you're like targeting like pilots or"

"9695430","9696370"," got the money to fix it."
"9697150","9705710"," I'm telling you what man like If you can buy a property Uh, my, my, my only rules here are"
"9705710","9712250"," this If you're gonna buy a property Uh, the best place to buy a property is always at an auction"
"9713350","9715990"," And i don't mean a i don't mean a bankruptcy option."
"9716270","9722630"," Well, yeah, I guess well the option my favorite ones are tax sales tax auctions courthouse steps"
"9722630","9732430"," auctions Uh with cash If you can't do that Uh And you want to go through a"
"9732430","9738230"," traditional loan process and rehab and rent it out I would go against that option too. "
"9738310","9745190"," Uh, my view on that is you take hard money loan Especially if you want to rehab and uh rent"
"9745190","9753170"," to renters i'll tell you this is the best honestly you guys Like for option number one if you have"
"9753170","9761650"," the cash You buy a house at a tax auction Hands down every time Even if you have to spend"
"9761650","9767070"," the rest of the cash to rehab that home and that they have them all over the country It's uh"
"9767070","9770830"," second best option Uh, if you don't want to take loans."
"9770890","9772630"," I have fucking hate loans, man."
"9772750","9775830"," I fucking hate them Fucking hate paying loans off. "
"9775830","9781450"," I fucking hate it Fucking hate the cost of all of it as a package."
"9781450","9786690"," I can't stand it Um, i've had deals fall through where i've lost money on fucking deals too like"
"9786690","9794930"," i've Like there's so much risk in doing this stuff so like The second best option for me and my"
"9794930","9799990"," personal experience has been if you don't have the money You take a hard money loan."
"9800150","9805830"," You find a hard money lender Uh, if you get decent credit You can find a hard money lender. "
"9805990","9814230"," They will uh match the money that you have You buy a house together You do the rehab They charge"
"9814230","9821750"," usually about 10 points 12 points your first deal which sucks You have a defined amount of time for"
"9821750","9825150"," you to uh do the rehab Then you have a defined amount of time for you to have it on"
"9825150","9829790"," market And it has to be a home that you know that you can buy for cheap renovate for cheap"
"9829790","9835810"," and sell Very key points here a little bit of a role going on right now failure to make a"
"9835810","9842770"," new high It's now 1237 in the afternoon got a previous side right here at 1215 Coming into uh 1237"

"9848530","9858050"," going on And if you can see it A little bit of a cooling off period happening right now So"
"9858050","9864110"," this the hard money loan reason i'm saying that is because You get experienced buying homes If you"
"9864110","9866570"," buy the right home It's number one."
"9866650","9872750"," It tells you you know what you're doing Number two Uh, if you take that hard money loan and you're"
"9872750","9878810"," able to rehab that home Cheap But very well, how do you do that cheap and very well?"
"9879270","9884310"," Uh, you have to be your own gc You have to write your do your own scheduling hire your own"

"9990490","9998090"," what you want it to be Uh, to turn into a rental And another thing about rentals is Uh, when"

"11674940","11676720"," Uh, we're not in super trend day yet today."
"11676800","11682400"," So r1 r2 good good place for the bulls Takes the money off the table and look for another place"

"17438230","17438970"," great decision."
"17439410","17440970"," I disagree with that trade right now. "
"17441250","17447690"," Uh, I am against These sell I'm I'm trading against these sellers right now Uh, because I do think"
"17447690","17456510"," they squeezed these guys out at some point Now Saying that You know right now that the buyers you"
"17456510","17461490"," guys want to you guys want to take a snapshot of this you can Okay, we'll snapshot this for you"
"17461490","17464450"," right now if you want Just right down here."
"17464470","17468110"," You can snapshot this You see where the hourly trigger is right here."
"17468110","17472990"," You know there's demand down here You know there's actually demand right here too, right?"
"17473210","17479570"," This there's uh weak buyers here And strong buyers down here at the hourly trigger You can also see"
"17479570","17481710"," the coiling that's taking place in here, right?"
"17482030","17488050"," Coil coil coil coil coil explosive move up or explosive move down I don't think that they can get"
"17488050","17489750"," underneath this hourly trigger right now. "
"17489750","17494130"," Maybe they can Uh, so what I want you to be aware of is two things here."
"17494210","17504410"," Okay two two important things you Target to the downside Is going to be at 446 By"
"17504410","17514070"," Wednesday It's lower right now, but by Wednesday Now if you want to get bearish Or begin to sell I"
"17514070","17522290"," want you to look for So for any kind of real true selling you want to look for Uh, this"
"17522290","17532050"," move here Okay Right down there And you want to look for price to get underneath The hourly"
"17532050","17532830"," trigger again."
"17533130","17538410"," So you don't want to see price get down below the hourly trigger Reject and begin to make its way"
"17538410","17544790"," down So it's somewhere below 453 to get bearish again on the marketplace believe it or even though"
"17544790","17554590"," you see this right now Your bearish and this is below 453 52 for a target of 446 40 in"
"17554590","17563650"," my My belief right here is that you're going to see You're going to see continued dip buy-in down"
"17563650","17570550"," here Until we get up here and then you're going to see a big sell come in So even even"
"17570550","17577490"," saying this if I see price underneath 453 52 I'll get my bear on put my bear code on or"
"17577490","17582830"," whatever And I'll get all kinds of fucking bearish But until then To me, this is just another"
"17582830","17590330"," opportunity to push this higher into 446 44 I do think though at some point Between now and"
"17590330","17599810"," tomorrow Uh, you are going to see a risk off Move, okay Now you see the yellow they're trying to"
"17599810","17606750"," say it's risk off early today is monday We have until fucking wednesday to get all weird My other"
"17606750","17613350"," fair here would be That if we don't see buyers step in to come up here You could see a"
"17613350","17620150"," nasty sideways trade in here Uh, and I if you see a nasty sideways trade you're talking about a"
"17620150","17628250"," very small range Uh very tight maybe Maybe 20 10 20 points something like that Leading straight"
"17628250","17629670"," into wednesday. "
"17629790","17635910"," I don't see Uh, like this blood I'm not seeing like blood before we get there and then a bloodbath"
"17635910","17643970"," down Maybe that maybe we get that anticipation of a forward looking on the fed I will say this I"
"17643970","17652510"," will say this If I see anything like this this breakdown and blood here and then Some kind of like"
"17652510","17658710"," nonsense move like this before 2 p.m on a fucking on wednesday Dude, I'm gonna be fucking I'm gonna"
"17658710","17663170"," I'm gonna guess that they think that we're forward looking We're gonna get a giant squeeze out of"
"17663170","17663290"," this."
"17663590","17666650"," I don't believe any of this I don't see this."
"17666650","17674330"," I don't know why this would happen Um, my my expectation here is they're gonna hold this And"
"17674330","17679430"," bloodbath this if we get hawkish hawkish fed They'll bloodbath this I think you're out of your"
"17679430","17686390"," fucking mind if you think That they're gonna bloodbath this Into into the decision And then you're"
"17686390","17691690"," gonna get a hawkish fed you're gonna come down here like this nonsense down here Like i'm just not"
"17691690","17692130"," seeing it. "
"17692150","17699430"," So My view is here is you're buying this dip Uh, and they're gonna squeeze out these these uh,"
"17699490","17708030"," these hedges And then they're gonna bring us back down in pinnace Somewhere at this 453 They're"
"17708030","17713970"," gonna pin you there And then they're gonna get your decision And we're either then going down to"
"17713970","17720430"," the depths of hell Uh, and then or going up and believe it or not failing Uh, you'll get your"
"17720430","17721510"," higher move later."
"17721590","17726970"," I believe Uh, and what they're gonna do is they're gonna wrap up the rest of the week They're gonna"
"17726970","17728570"," burn all of your shit in here."
"17728790","17735490"," Fuck you and your trades Right vol crush And then they're gonna move it up higher or move it lower"
"17735490","17741950"," again down the road unless we get super bear But I don't think you're getting super bear so Uh, so"
"17741950","17751390"," my take from now into tomorrow Uh, today is monday Uh upside target into tomorrow 4.56.06 I know"
"17751390","17757450"," that a failure of 4.56.06 at some point, but yes a tray a grind higher And then by"
"17757450","17762950"," 11.30 in the afternoon, you will see a hedge come on the market Uh, they will push it down"
"17762950","17772530"," into Wednesday decision And we should be right around 4.53.35 at some point Into that decision, uh,"
"17772790","17774610"," what are my expectations on the fed rate decision?"
"17775350","17777950"," Uh, I think you get 25 bps. "
"17778490","17787250"," I think you get a pause in the actual press release I think that uh, jerom is going to be"
"17787250","17794010"," dovish My thought here is uh, though that he's going to In his wording say something about"
"17794010","17801090"," revisiting end of summer fall winter Uh, I think you're going to get a pause Uh, I don't think"
"17801090","17805790"," we're done raising rates personally I think they're going to hammer you down the road."
"17806010","17814730"," I think they're going to try to unclench Uh Bob on main street And try to get bob on main"
"17814730","17819250"," street to believe that they're going to cut rates And they're going to they're going to they're"
"17819250","17825390"," going to trick all of the into Taking on all this fucking all these high rates And then they're"
"17825390","17830790"," going to hit you down the road And you're going to get trapped in those in those loans Uh, but"
"17830790","17832010"," I don't see it happening right now."
"17832310","17834550"," So Uh, I don't see that right now. "
"17834570","17838550"," I think that's the intent Um, so I think you're going to get get that."
"17838730","17843830"," I don't I think they're going to I think they're going to hold rates at seven Uh for a period"
"17843830","17844290"," of time."
"17844690","17850690"," I don't I wouldn't expect a rate cuts Hmm, they're going to try to front run it though And those"
"17850690","17856390"," try to front run it like december or some shit uh, november december, october Uh, if we get those"
"17856390","17860270"," rate cuts, you're going to see a bloodbath in the marketplace and then a and then i'm a bottom to"
"17860270","17863930"," buy If we do actually get rate cuts Uh, so that's the other side. "
"17864150","17870510"," I think rates I think hold for longer is best If they are actually going to cut rates at some"
"17870510","17877310"," point in the winter and they front run that action I think you will see Uh us trade up into"
"17878230","17887390"," Winter and then a bible bottom From the from the bloodbath on on rate cuts Now so right now, uh"
"17887390","17894290"," only thing that matters right price action matters Uh, I am I am bullish tacitly bullish to hear"
"17896170","17902770"," Biable dip probably garbage trading to be honest with you Uh, and then looking to put a put some"
"17902770","17911510"," kind of puts on into Wednesdays Wednesdays rate decision I'm assuming some of you are really"
"17911510","17912150"," bearish here."
"17912390","17918790"," If you are, I need to see price below, uh, 4352 So I see that with confirmation, uh get out"
"17918790","17925750"," of here If you're a bear You could likely sell this down if you wanted You want to like sell"
"17925750","17929690"," this down here Some like that and take that money."
"17929990","17935070"," Yeah, you might you might have that trade, but i'm not seeing your your ultimate bearishness It's"
"17935070","17936530"," hard for me to see that right now. "
"17936870","17941310"," It's hard for me to see us going into a rate decision And dealers are just gonna be like fuck"
"17941310","17944570"," yeah, we're gonna print all your shit for you Here's your fucking free money."
"17944810","17949630"," We're not even in the rate decision And they're gonna print like if if we get a hawkish fed and"
"17949630","17954130"," they're gonna print out like triple or quadruple for you That's not how this works Dealers aren't"
"17954130","17954530"," like that."
"17954770","17960510"," So I am against you on Uh two bloodbath or the possibility of it. "
"17960710","17965850"," I think you get paid if you get a hawkish fed Uh, and I think they will pay you but"
"17965850","17970430"," not before putting the squeeze on you until then There's no fucking free fucking lunches here in"
"17970430","17976310"," this market if you're a bear so Uh, I would be I would be trying to I'd be trying to"
"17976310","17981430"," sell like 1130 in the morning Wherever price is there sell that 1130 in the morning on Tuesday."
"17981690","17982410"," Maybe they'll come early."
"17982630","17986550"," Maybe i'm wrong Uh, I don't think the options market works like that. "
"17986670","17996610"," So You Yeah, I'm not on the uh, I'm on the I'm on the market fucking as"
"17996610","18005490"," many put people as possible trade Uh, so if you're looking for a dip to buy uh, try to be"
"18005490","18015440"," buying I'll give you an exact price here If you're looking for a dip to buy This might be"
"18015440","18021600"," a good overnight for people if you're a a futures glowback strater Yeah trend is coming up on"
"18021600","18022260"," hourly too."
"18022760","18029280"," Uh, so just be aware here Uh, trend is still to the upside on hourly Uh, I want you to"

"18035540","18045500"," see hourly trend is coming up And i'm going to expect in these dips to be bought And then"
"18045500","18052420"," you get your roll Turn to the scene of the crime then you get to roll down into uh, Wednesday"
"18052420","18058680"," Now the only way that my my the only way that I'll disagree with you on this is if we"
"18058680","18065980"," trade below 4354 Let me know if you're buying this dip or not You can see the dip was bought"
"18065980","18066380"," right here."
"18066380","18078510"," It's starting to be bought right now I should"
"18078510","18081330"," have bought it myself So what am I looking at?"
"18081430","18082430"," I should have bought this for tomorrow. "
"18082430","18084070"," I should have bought calls for tomorrow."
"18084510","18092290"," I didn't any of you guys, um I should have I should have bought this fucking thing down here and"
"18092290","18101490"," I didn't I should have bought fucking calls right on that fucking yellow bar Let's"
"18101490","18112040"," look at uh calls for tomorrow now Um yet Yeah,"
"18112360","18117340"," and i'm looking at like i'm even the dealers think this too like dealers You know dealers got 455"
"18117340","18120220"," at 95 cents for tomorrow."
"18120220","18125920"," They've got 456 is it Uh, was that 50 59 cents for tomorrow?"
"18126400","18131220"," They got 457's at uh, was it 35 cents for tomorrow?"
"18131880","18138080"," So I don't think i'm out of line even giving these numbers to you dealers are saying the same thing"
"18138080","18146920"," dealers are saying Uh expect more grind up into tomorrow Uh, and until proven otherwise under 453"
"18146920","18152260"," and changed Uh, that's likely going to be the move grind its sideways and up into the belt tomorrow"
"18152260","18158180"," You know this might might be it might be a nice um Uh, this this could be a nice, uh,"
"18158320","18166920"," theta trade or a nice Um, this actually could be a really nice, um, fucking butterfly Into tomorrow"
"18166920","18172760"," you just grind and then close them Let's see we squeeze up or something close them out, uh on the"
"18172760","18176760"," belt on the opening bell tomorrow Those are really nice. "
"18176960","18181880"," There's a really nice fly in here Um, so there's another idea for you as well."
"18182120","18191940"," There is a good there's a good fly trade between today and uh At least tuesday if not wednesday You"
"18191940","18199200"," know like put up you put a fly up here Put a fly like I don't know somewhere down here"

"18205640","18213540"," make their bets And uh, you just grind them As a matter of fact, I might I might put it"
"18213540","18218840"," for like I would say do it for friday, but Uh like a wednesday butterfly or something like that"

"18286210","18298500"," your your your bearishness is right It's that they're not going to pay you for it Yeah,"
"18298500","18299020"," I agree."
"18299360","18306220"," I I think there's a reversal the upside into tomorrow I'm looking for that failure up here."

"18307940","18317760"," Whoop then down There might be a better trade in the bell too I I'm"

"18327550","18334670"," the call side too a whole bunch of call buyers right now on uh 120 000 call buyers on 455"
"18334670","18349600"," c Uh for tomorrow's expiry we can look up a little bit farther out too I could always"
"18349600","18358180"," um It's a little bit more cost But you could buy like a weekly 255 and just close it by"
"18358180","18366160"," tomorrow By a weekly 255 or something like that Two weeks out month out and just ride the uh so"
"18366160","18371080"," you don't get fucked up with The up or down moves and just cut try to ride this grind higher"
"18371080","18378960"," into tomorrow cut it loose 11 30 1 30 in the afternoon you know, there is a there is also"
"18378960","18381320"," So for all the bearishness."
"18381520","18383060"," I've talked to you guys about here, right?"
"18383780","18391060"," There is one other thing This would be the So I spoke to you briefly about price breaking below the"
"18391730","18397240"," daily and how It's a very small chance that not daily with the price breaking below the hourly"
"18397240","18403800"," trigger and we start bloodbathing it like we bloodbath tomorrow we bloodbath today We go all the"
"18403800","18406400"," way down to the daily trigger and to the decision on wednesday. "
"18406680","18416480"," There's another side to this coin and that would be the front running of a the front running of"
"18417400","18423600"," a rear view mirror for the fed Uh, that's that's entirely possible."
"18423600","18432940"," It's small possibility like five to 15 percent chance You could if you're very risky You're very"
"18432940","18435000"," like risk risk on kind of person."
"18435200","18440940"," There's definitely not financial advice Uh, there is a possibility of watching the market just"
"18440940","18449440"," fucking rip faces off And just price in the the rear view mirror on the fed Uh, it's a low"
"18449440","18457060"," probability trade like five percent chance But there's that possibility there is Uh, if the fed"
"18457060","18464860"," does pause and they rear view mirror that shit You could see from now into the fed meeting. "
"18465060","18469520"," We just go up And it's just relentless to the upside that does happen."
"18469520","18476020"," It's rare, but it does happen I'll give that I'll give them to give that one like five or 15"
"18476020","18480560"," percent too So the bears that think they're going to get the daily trigger before we get to the"
"18480560","18483480"," meeting I'm going to give that like five or 15 percent."
"18483480","18492660"," I'm going to give bulls Uh more than a more of a chance of it happening than unlikely Normally I'd"
"18492660","18497740"," give bulls a zero percent chance of that shit happening, but You know if they just if they ran this"
"18497740","18504140"," shit up and nobody was long Like just fucking front ran it Like front run the rear view mirror. "
"18504320","18511460"," They fucking dump it on you Just as you're getting bullish because they're gonna rear view mirror"
"18511460","18519140"," that shit that would be epic You get every fucking bear short You get every bull sitting on the"
"18519140","18524920"," sidelines You get it up there in price then you dump it on the bulls the bears are already fucked"
"18524920","18532200"," up That'd be a great fucking trade They just there's there's front run the whole entire thing Start"
"18532200","18542440"," trading like uh 459 92 And you just you just ask last them 466 465 That'd"
"18542440","18552740"," be hilarious if the trade was today It'd be fucking hilarious You"
"18552740","18557160"," You get all that feel to the upside right and then all these bulls would jump in you're trading 460"
"18558220","18559580"," Bulls are like whoo."
"18559620","18560080"," Yeah, baby."
"18560200","18569560"," Then you're just fucking just fucking unload into these bulls Yeah, it's exactly it's the tails. "
"18569960","18579870"," It's the tails dude Yeah, it's the tails man"
"18579870","18583890"," I do too."
"18584090","18591810"," I think um So an spx on the jpm collar, I think they're gonna front run it I think they"
"18591810","18595550"," front run it and then we fade I think we trade sideways off the car."
"18595670","18603590"," There we go above the collar in um We're already in um I'm coming into the end of um the"
"18603590","18604630"," first the first month. "
