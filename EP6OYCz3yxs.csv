"98500","99860"," Good morning, Lucy."
"100100","100540"," Good morning, Brian."
"101060","102500"," Gary, the fire of Mid-Dot. "
"105200","106500"," Good morning, Jeremy."
"107340","108580"," Good morning, thank you."
"108860","109860"," Hope you all had a great weekend. "
"110100","120050"," Jake, you had tornadoes"
"120050","120770"," down in Texas."
"122170","124050"," We're going to have some..."
"124050","126570"," I got stuck in a tornado in Texas once."
"127570","128110"," I was..."
"128110","130210"," I was heading over, I think, from Oklahoma. "
"130810","132590"," I was going to go hiking down in Big Bend."
"132770","133090"," That's my park."
"134070","136170"," I had old school red box, Winnebago. "
"136170","139630"," And I wanted to have an arcade underneath, put it over the pass."
"139930","141250"," And that hit me right over."
"141370","143090"," I think I'm direct hit, but I was pretty close. "
"143290","143770"," It was wild."
"144330","149470"," But I got out of an army and climbed up underneath the girders."
"150230","153270"," With the girl that wound up becoming my wife. "
"155970","157470"," So stay safe, Patboy."
"159030","160130"," Not to suit the morning."
"160550","161930"," At a Z's, good morning, huts, good morning. "
"163010","163830"," Everybody's doing well."
"164350","167190"," I didn't bring up my bike in the body."
"168310","168810"," Okay. "
"169710","170890"," We have a lot of time."
"171030","175930"," I was having some technical difficulties, but I was trying to hook up a microphone today."
"176310","179270"," Obviously, you guys have put a microphone directly into airport. "
"179630","181470"," You should also listen to me there."
"181670","182170"," I've heard that."
"183190","185590"," We've had a..."
"186490","188890"," Or it's a faster feed in there, I guess. "
"192230","198910"," So one note this morning, if you are tuning in, if you have a lag on YouTube, if you just"
"198910","207330"," speed up the broadcast down in the little settings icon or hamburger or gear, just two times it"
"207330","208630"," fast and then it stays."
"209050","215610"," It will sound like a, you know, talking after hopping some nitrous or whatever."
"217830","220050"," But it'll eventually catch up and sound normal. "
"221510","225350"," And if you're listening to me live right now in Discord, then you don't want to listen to me on"
"225350","225770"," both sides."
"225770","226810"," Just mute one of the other."
"227490","228690"," And you should be good to go. "
"228990","234970"," But I know that there was a few people that just wanted to listen in Discord while they watched the"
"234970","235630"," flow come in."
"236890","244870"," Now we did have some puts come in after the belly yesterday on spy for April 14, 423 P, IWM"
"244870","247850"," as well, 197 P for April 14."
"248170","248870"," Just be aware of that. "
"249510","254390"," This morning it seems like we're gaining back all of our losses from the overnight."
"255649","258690"," Also another note on the show is..."
"259410","265750"," So rather than going back to trade the news, I went back or trying Ben Zinga one more time for"
"265750","266630"," live news today."
"266870","267690"," We'll see how that goes. "
"267690","274170"," I might also try to put like a live news feed in the broadcast at some point if that's possible."
"274450","277250"," So we'll try Ben Zinga Pro one more time."
"277270","280770"," I've got the options squawk on and the equity squawk on this morning. "
"281270","283070"," So we'll listen into that as the day moves forward."
"283070","284910"," If that works for you guys, we'll keep it."
"285270","288110"," If not, last chance will be back to trade the news. "
"288970","290330"," I just want to give them one more shot as well."
"290330","293910"," So I'm just going to give them a shot today and this week and we'll see how that goes."
"293910","296930"," So we've got that loaded up. "
"297070","299310"," Now for the economic calendar, we don't have a bunch going on this week."
"300130","301970"," Specifically today, we don't have a ton going on at all."
"302070","305050"," We've got nothing until 12 PM. "
"305190","307590"," We've got Bostick speech at 12."
"308050","310190"," So look for some volatility around him."
"310610","311190"," We know he's going to be..."
"311190","312130"," What do you think he's going to be a bear?"
"312910","313910"," Everyone's going to welcome out. "
"314750","317290"," Flip the script and turn bullish believe it or not."
"317290","321410"," T.S. car parts and answers termination of its at the market equity offering program."
"321410","329090"," Shares spiking here moving above the 770 level up at 779 up 4%. "
"330710","333210"," Papa Romeo, Tango Sandy, PRTS."
"334390","336210"," Car parts, PRTS."
"337310","338290"," We've got a..."
"338290","340970"," that's a termination of its at the money equity offering program. "
"342950","343510"," PRTS."
"346270","349730"," Quote, as we previously discussed in our most recent earnings call when we think about it."
"349730","350730"," We've got a number one inventory and safety stock. "
"350950","352950"," Number two, our currently undrawn line of credit."
"353350","354850"," Number three, our free cash fully feel confident."
"355030","358950"," Our ability to execute our strategy of right part, right time, right place, given our currently"
"358950","359350"," quiddity. "
"359890","362450"," And that lends itself to the inflation trade."
"364030","367230"," So we don't have much going on until Fed Chair Powell speaks at 4 PM."
"367890","369770"," And the rest of the week, we've only got..."
"369770","371990"," we've got some stuff going on, but it isn't that..."
"371990","374670"," isn't headline type news stuff. "
"374850","377830"," So we'll be looking for headline news events this week."
"377830","380990"," They should be important as we move through the week here."
"382070","385270"," Moving into the spot again report for today, the 31st. "
"385710","388730"," Futures were steady overnight and are currently near 4440."
"389170","392650"," Friday's expiration brought us a substantial reduction in negative gamma, which suggests a"
"392650","395730"," reduction in market volatility."
"397590","400770"," SGS rates 0.8.2% SPX move for today. "
"401090","402150"," So not a huge move, but a move."
"403090","405810"," For today, we see support at 4400."
"405810","408130"," Okay, so we're at 4444. "
"408350","410350"," Let me take a look where we are exactly right now."
"414590","421680"," So we're currently trading slightly higher, right?"
"421780","431360"," We're just trading at 44.5.0. So we're slightly above where our resistance"
"431360","432200"," is, right?"
"432620","434860"," So excuse me, we say our support at 4400."
"434960","437760"," So we're trading slightly at our first support level. "
"437760","439780"," The resistance is at 4471."
"440140","441480"," We're going to chart this out real quick too."
"442060","443980"," With expiration comes the release of max puts. "
"444260","449840"," You can see below the in delta tilt readings that were now up off of the recent heavy put readings."
"450360","454160"," We felt for some time that large put values were a signal that the market was well-edged, which in"
"454160","455500"," turn supported equities."
"456580","457740"," And there is a key note in this. "
"458360","464720"," You can see down here, down below here, all these puts are, and the corresponding market falling."
"465240","473000"," And you would to some extent expect these puts or this green line to rise and have a rise, an"
"473000","474640"," overall rise in markets, right?"
"474820","476360"," An SPX delta tilt."
"477720","481220"," Further, despite the major bounce in equities, large gamma strikes are still primarily put"
"481220","481600"," positions. "
"482460","483900"," But this is where the key lies, right?"
"484340","485920"," When you guys look at this dot plot."
"487280","490240"," I think bring this in for you guys real quick here."
"492160","495660"," Further, despite the major bounce in equities, large gamma strikes are still primarily put"
"495660","495940"," positions. "
"496340","497320"," That's key to know, okay?"
"497600","501020"," So you would expect a rise in the market as we move forward."
"501860","506740"," But currently, we still have a lot of put positions that are lower than the 440 strike."
"507200","509540"," Below is a percentile rank by strike for spy gamma. "
"509980","511659"," And you can see that puts still rank highest."
"512360","517260"," It's above 44, 440 on spy and 4400 on SPX."
"517260","519580"," We're in the gamut call strikes start to increase. "
"519860","525240"," But those call positions need to increase markedly to offer right here."
"525340","526300"," This part right here, right?"
"526520","531300"," Call positions need to increase markedly to offer market support."
"532060","534860"," Data from last week suggests that call buying was rather anemic. "
"535420","536740"," And we've been talking about that."
"536800","537880"," I posted about that on Twitter as well."
"537980","542140"," You're not seeing outside the money and far dated out calls. "
"542300","543660"," We did see some last week."
"543660","545140"," We saw it in on flow."
"545300","545500"," I'll go. "
"545660","552500"," But what we saw was directed calls that were dated into April into June, but it was very selective"
"552500","554080"," in what those calls were."
"554680","560520"," And so, and so the market or the market participants, the institutions and the banks are saying,"
"560820","564940"," well, we're going to be selective and we think is going to be the trade from now into April and"
"564940","565200"," June."
"566100","567720"," And we're going to talk about that later today. "
"567920","572340"," We're going to get into the bad months that we've, you know, we always talk about when you start"
"572340","576940"," stacking up bad days and you start stacking up bad weeks, then you start stacking up bad months and"
"576940","578420"," then you start stacking up bad quarters."
"579580","583120"," How long it actually takes to recover from that move."
"583840","585820"," And we're seeing some of that even currently. "
"586300","593080"," We know that bulls are only trading to a price and very short dated and in the money calls."
"593400","595340"," And, you know, I don't blame them for a bunch of reasons."
"595520","597920"," One, because of the risk in the market, right?"
"598100","602460"," We know that we don't know there's risk right now, but there's no real good news to be moving up"
"602460","602860"," right now. "
"603680","608060"," But another key factor is that there's no, or there's volcrush, right?"
"608340","613360"," So even when we make a turn in the market, if you're buying outside the money calls, even if"
"613360","617440"," they're dated, they're not getting that premium kick that you'd expect."
"617680","620620"," You're not getting more participation in buying those calls."
"621060","621700"," So, right?"
"621920","624160"," So it's like a, it's like a reverb, right?"
"624500","629900"," If you're speaking to a microphone and you hear the noise kick back to you, you are almost forced"
"629900","635760"," into buying in the money calls that are maybe one, three, five days away so you can actually profit"
"635760","636960"," off of those calls. "
"637180","642360"," If you don't put that risk on in that way, you're really not making any money right now because no"
"642360","647160"," one else is joining you one, three, five, six months out in those calls market wide."
"648520","651000"," And in this dot plot, you can see it here, right?"
"651360","652740"," So this is a percentage over here."
"652740","657440"," 100% of the options are puts that are below 440. "
"657900","659460"," This vertical line right here."
"659900","667880"," You can see there below down to 420 and even as deep as 340, 360, 380, and above 400, not"
"667880","673280"," technically at 400 right now, but slip right up in here between 440 and 420."
"674300","679300"," There's not a plethora of calls above that 440 to 460 strike. "
"679300","686040"," You know, they see this huge concentration in here, 450, 445, 440 somewhere in here."
"686420","693880"," Now, if these calls as they're not actually going to print quote unquote, unless we buy further out"
"693880","700860"," calls, that also means that call holders know this and that they will close these calls for profit"
"700860","703680"," and not roll them into farther out strikes."
"704200","704920"," What does that mean?"
"704920","710520"," What that means is that if you find bulls at the open today take profit, you're going to be left"
"710520","712120"," with a shit ton of puts in the market, right?"
"712660","716260"," And eventually we're going to end up gravitating towards those puts. "
"717000","721740"," If we don't replace those calls with something further out in the money, we want that call wall to"
"721740","723600"," not be directly at 440."
"724140","729140"," We want it to be at like 460 to get to 450 or 470 to get to 460, if that"
"729140","729560"," makes sense."
"730020","733420"," We want a broad market participation in those calls. "
"733420","735920"," Now, that does say to an extent, right?"
"736160","744880"," It bolsters the opinion that it bolsters the opinion that institutions were direct or specific and"
"744880","747280"," what they were going along for the next three months."
"747460","752680"," And it also bolstered the opinion that it could have just been, believe it or not, it was just"
"752680","757800"," sound shocking to some of you, but it could have just been options driven for one to three days,"
"757800","761640"," right, combined with short covering, right?"
"761640","765200"," But you don't see the extension of that further out in time."
"765760","768300"," So you do have the you have the Vana rally, right?"
"769300","772260"," But the Vana rally ends sooner than it should. "
"772780","779720"," And if that Vana at rally ends today, if we don't see substantial call volume today and into"
"779720","785100"," Wednesday, let's say, if you don't see expansion of call volume, you will see you'll see a"
"785100","786480"," stagnation in the market today."
"786480","788400"," And then you'll see bulls get scared, right?"
"788400","792080"," They'll say, I'm going to start pulling these calls out and start taking profit."
"792380","794440"," You'll see some panic come into the market. "
"796160","797720"," I don't know if anything else down below."
"797880","800140"," One of the other things in our radar is implied volatility, VIX."
"800640","804100"," And as you can see below, the VIX has dropped sharply from highs, which implies the Vana trade was"
"804100","805380"," in full force during the recent rally. "
"805820","810500"," We now view IV as hitting a lower bound, which suggests that the Vana fuel is now reduced."
"811220","815180"," This view is based off the fact that one month realized volatility is high is a high 25."
"815180","820620"," This may tether IV and markets must retain some event fall due to geopolitical unrest. "
"821140","824740"," It doesn't likely that you want large short put exposure before there's peace."
"826440","828240"," So what does this mean, right?"
"828360","831580"," This means that we could be getting some headline risk with war still."
"831920","836160"," It also means how far, what's the bottom in the VIX, right?"
"836520","838080"," It's probably not at 20. "
"838540","840220"," It's probably not below 20."
"840360","842900"," Let's just call it at 20, but not below 20, right?"
"842900","846720"," So even if we're just going to say, hey, Cap, how are we going to trade this this week?"
"847060","848420"," We don't really know what's going on."
"848820","851500"," This is when you actually do turn to the VIX. "
"851620","855820"," This is when you look towards the VIX and say, okay, where do I think the bottom is in the"
"855820","856100"," VIX?"
"857240","858500"," I want to say it was down at 23."
"858560","861780"," I'll take a look at it again, but I thought it was down at like 23, but if we can"
"861780","869240"," get down to like 23 or 20, you should start to contemplate putting on some hedging or selling your"
"869240","871640"," calls and buying puts, right?"
"871640","875740"," Or even just selling calls to bulls once we get down around the 20."
"876040","878140"," Is there anything that can get us below 20 right now?"
"878600","885960"," Probably just the cessation of wartime activities, wartime activities in Ukraine, other than that. "
"886160","890740"," And I know that it doesn't really, I know that Ukraine is not really the headlines that are driving"
"890740","892860"," the market, but what else could it be?"
"893420","898660"," You would have to have some other kind of news come out that says, oh, yeah, home prices have come"
"898660","900700"," down and the Fed's lending money."
"901320","906400"," And oh, by the way, don't expect all these all these all these rate increases."
"907160","909300"," Oh, and we're going to do some quantitative easing. "
"909780","910620"," Like, I don't know what else."
"910760","916540"," I guess the I guess some of the positive headlines today would be that I guess I guess the United"
"916540","924960"," States, the three major credit reporting agencies are going to dismiss medical bills from people's"
"924960","925480"," credit reports."
"925480","928220"," And maybe that could be some some headline positive news. "
"928380","932900"," But other than that, there really isn't much to go on right now in the market not to make us"
"932900","933180"," go up."
"933300","936760"," So just be wary that that headline risk from Ukraine news."
"936960","938700"," And I'm not saying that it's it's real. "
"938720","940480"," I'm saying that it can be used, right?"
"941100","942320"," It can be manipulated and used."
"942680","947200"," Matter of fact, over the weekend on Sunday, I saw a rutors put out a fucking bullshit story about"
"947200","948640"," housing prices going up."
"949800","954940"," And for a bunch of different reasons, but the funny part is if housing prices are going up, that"
"954940","956040"," means the market should go up. "
"956200","958700"," So they were trying to spin it into negative news for the market."
"959020","960740"," So you never know what they're going to use."
"961320","967220"," What what institutions hedge funds will pay to have news release that just make it seem negative on"
"967220","967540"," the market. "
"967540","969300"," Just be aware of that as we move forward here."
"971260","972780"," So we're going to take a look at the spy."
"972980","975400"," This is actually I got a couple charts I want to show for you. "
"975460","980040"," My charts didn't actually come over well from I did some other charts somewhere else."
"980580","982900"," And so we're going to talk about some charts for today."
"982900","986460"," And so at four four zero, right?"
"986600","988420"," You're going to get your first level of support. "
"989680","992000"," This morning, and we'll put that at four four zero."
"995850","997190"," Right there, right?"
"998910","1001130"," So I've got this chart somewhere else."
"1002110","1002930"," But it doesn't matter. "
"1003110","1003810"," I already know what the charts are."
"1003910","1006950"," I think I already know the charts are now down here."
"1007470","1008070"," Excuse me. "
"1009230","1012650"," Let me get a one month chart out here and make it simpler."
"1012650","1019120"," I mean, look at this here."
"1019520","1019560"," Boom. "
"1020860","1021260"," Wild."
"1028170","1029089"," Let me get that."
"1029550","1030630"," Scratch that out a little bit here. "
"1040550","1043030"," Bring that up just a little bit here for you."
"1043030","1043089"," Let me get a little bit here."
"1057960","1059420"," Do they get to scroll this up here?"
"1059920","1061340"," Being type for just a second here. "
"1071360","1072160"," Put that."
"1078450","1078850"," There."
"1080130","1080470"," Okay. "
"1080670","1083390"," So we've got some resistance here at four four seven one."
"1085430","1086710"," That one right there."
"1086950","1088750"," And we're going to do another one just above it. "
"1093040","1094500"," Right at four fifty."
"1109070","1110530"," Four thirty five."
"1114210","1117330"," This is a major four thirty five is a major. "
"1118910","1120270"," Move this over here."
"1121250","1126690"," Four thirty five is going to be a major level down here reporting."
"1127370","1128990"," Q four results. "
"1129890","1130930"," Reporting net revenue."
"1132430","1134070"," For Q four of."
"1134910","1136190"," Fifteen point nine million. "
"1137010","1138630"," Versus fourteen point four million."
"1139610","1140230"," Last quarter."
"1143600","1145000"," It's Sandy Oscar November. "
"1145620","1145740"," Mike."
"1145740","1146740"," S O and M."
"1152960","1157840"," I put our I made this I asked one to make this R one."
"1163660","1165120"," That R one right there. "
"1170220","1172480"," I make this R two here."
"1172580","1173420"," I think it's slightly lower."
"1173760","1176100"," I have to go back here and look to see exactly where it is. "
"1176100","1177420"," I'll just as we move forward."
"1177640","1180360"," And the charts looking walking right now because they're getting close to the open."
"1180960","1182860"," But you're going to be looking for resistance. "
"1183480","1186000"," Four four seven one and then again above."
"1186520","1189420"," Coming into that four five zero today."
"1189840","1194780"," Now if we break below forty four hundred at any point today tomorrow. "
"1195420","1197900"," You're going to say, hey, Cap, we're probably only going to retest down here."
"1198000","1199580"," Four thirty five or so."
"1200020","1201100"," Maybe slightly higher. "
"1202000","1204380"," But in reality, if we start making our way down here."
"1204640","1206840"," We're more than likely what going to do a half back trade."
"1207240","1211020"," Even if it's just for a moment, we'll get back down into this four thirty. "
"1211020","1212380"," Down below here."
"1212960","1216120"," So I'm going to put this back on a one day chart for you so you can see it."
"1223910","1226650"," And you're going to be looking for you got two minutes until the bell opens. "
"1228470","1231530"," And if you ask me what I think is going to happen, I think that we're going to trade higher"
"1231530","1235170"," today to this resistance or attempt to trade higher, even if it's a green bar up off the bell."
"1235610","1237130"," And then we are going to trade back."
"1237350","1240230"," I expect that if it doesn't happen today, it should happen. "
"1240970","1243110"," At some point into tomorrow."
"1244830","1247470"," So you bring this up better for you so you can have a look at it."
"1255160","1258280"," You can see that trend line still going down over here. "
"1258820","1262500"," And we really just need to stay above this four thirty four to be honest with you."
"1262680","1264640"," If we can stay above four thirty four and be happy."
"1265100","1268840"," Even if we break for forty for a moment and come back up and be happy with this. "
"1269420","1271380"," Maintaining four forty is important and critical."
"1272020","1275080"," Even if it was a quick run down to four thirty five and we go higher."
"1275700","1277820"," I would be I would take that right now as well. "
"1277820","1282900"," Because as we trend here downwards, it really is this trend line right here."
"1283120","1289260"," We don't want to break this trend line and it starts to turn start to turn negative."
"1289420","1293080"," And I have a larger time frame that I want to show you guys here in a minute. "
"1293080","1297560"," I'm going to work on it on another computer and post it for you this morning."
"1297620","1303700"," There's a larger time frame that I want you to see that we're now beginning to trend in."
"1303700","1306000"," It doesn't correspond well. "
"1306700","1308020"," You see if I can go back here."
"1312140","1314300"," But really it's this trend right here."
"1314540","1316580"," It's this trend right here as we move forward. "
"1317240","1319200"," I want to show you guys this right here."
"1325400","1327160"," It is right in here."
"1328900","1330140"," I want to keep this. "
"1333940","1338840"," You really do want to see this maintain even if we come back down here later."
"1338840","1343600"," You do want to see this trend shift as we trade."
"1344080","1349320"," Even if we were to trade, let's we talked about maybe coming down to make this slightly lower right"
"1349320","1349480"," here. "
"1349680","1352660"," You can see that resistance that's here."
"1352800","1354300"," This is still a bullish context."
"1355420","1358500"," And in reality, we don't want to be getting lower. "
"1359900","1364760"," We really want to stay trending in here to make another leg higher as we trade higher."
"1364760","1370820"," So now you can see this area of contention here that you want to maintain this to stay bullish."
"1371280","1377380"," If you don't stay bullish, you see these lower targets down here, 435, 430 down below. "
"1377620","1381440"," You don't really want to breach this negative channel."
"1381820","1383000"," We've done that in the past."
"1383220","1384020"," We did it back here. "
"1384340","1386820"," We had only had a channel that was over and over in this vicinity."
"1387000","1392020"," You go backwards in time here and see this trend as we came down."
"1392020","1395540"," Every time we trade it up and over, we gave it all back, right?"
"1396040","1400360"," Gave it all back here and we're kind of back in that same situation again. "
"1400800","1402380"," We don't want to give all this back."
"1402640","1407260"," We'll go back down into a lower trending channel and can possibly go even deeper."
"1408220","1409700"," We are now open at this time. "
"1414880","1417080"," It turns some of this beeping off."
"1475540","1482600"," Currently watching a small bid come in on the spy calls on 445 C, expiring on the 21st."
"1482740","1491140"," They're currently $1.49.50. Not seeing a lot of algos on puts currently for the 21st. "
"1491800","1493460"," We'll see how long live this is."
"1498670","1499390"," Yeah, it's weird."
"1499590","1503730"," Chase is saying that the speech by chair chair powers at 12 PM, not 4 PM. "
"1504790","1507310"," I'll look at national association for business economics."
"1508610","1509450"," Good morning, Gerald."
"1509630","1509890"," How are you?"
"1510070","1510270"," Good morning. "

"1518590","1519330"," Let's see here."
"1524400","1525760"," The music is drowning on my voice."
"1525960","1527020"," Otis, thanks for saying something. "
"1527200","1530000"," I'll make sure that I adjust that in the future."
"1534700","1538880"," Yeah, the Russian markets were going to open, but they're not technically open at this point."
"1540160","1540860"," Good morning, Karen. "

"1550180","1551440"," Everybody's doing well this morning."
"1551600","1551820"," Okay."
"1551900","1554580"," I had a chance to read what you guys are saying at this time. "
"1554580","1557400"," So we've got some news up here, but it's not really saying too much."
"1558880","1559860"," So we'll see what's up."
"1561700","1563460"," So we are trading higher off the bell. "
"1563940","1566460"," Now have 5,000 calls on those 445 C's."
"1566580","1571200"," They're now trading at $1.80 currently, $1.80 on those calls off the bell."
"1577790","1579750"," And I will put up wait a minute here. "
"1580450","1581950"," I'm going to move this over here."
"1584190","1586750"," Get some book map up and running for you guys."
"1592210","1593070"," Wait a minute here. "
"1620840","1622880"," No, no updates this morning."
"1623140","1623500"," Sorry, buddy."
"1625600","1628300"," I was running a little late this morning here. "
"1628400","1634420"," I've got some new stuff that we were installing this morning."
"1635080","1640060"," New microphones and some software."
"1664220","1666880"," See if we can see where resistance is. "
"1677890","1679770"," Some sellers at 447."
"1695930","1702370"," Those spy calls of 445 C's are now trading at $2.12. They were, I think I learned it at"
"1702370","1712710"," $1.49, $1.48 now trading at $2.20. Look"
"1712710","1715630"," to see if this ice actually kicks in above here."
"1716050","1722490"," You can see 17,000 put options versus 10,000 put options are 12,000, 13,000. "
"1723010","1723570"," 14,000."
"1723690","1725510"," We'll see if we'll get a bolster here or not."
"1726090","1731150"," Trading higher now to 446.03. Take this a little bit closer. "
"1733910","1736450"," Let's see if these sellers are still hiding up here."
"1736870","1739030"," And you can see that band up here."
"1745450","1750310"," We are trading as expected off the bell this morning. "
"1752690","1753890"," How's everybody doing?"
"1755530","1756930"," How y'all doing out there?"
"1759350","1761390"," Burm 80 burr right off the bell."
"1761710","1763530"," 446.12 resist."
"1763830","1770950"," We're hitting resistance currently right now, right around 446.41 or so. "
"1771690","1773450"," Sellers starting to step in currently."
"1776610","1779910"," We are watching the hero indicators start to trend lower."
"1780550","1781250"," Be aware of that. "
"1793570","1806310"," Spy calls now trading at $2.30. 446,"
"1806770","1807890"," 0 sellers."
"1808210","1813450"," And then above is 446.89 on the spy."
"1818200","1819500"," You had a great weekend. "
"1821700","1822960"," What did I do this weekend?"
"1822960","1832800"," So I bought a house and we have calls coming in on Nvidia June 17,"
"1833120","1835300"," 240 C, $1.3 million."
"1836220","1836920"," Great call expansion."
"1837840","1843600"," Tesla calls Tesla March 25, 1,005 C."
"1844120","1846040"," It's not a kind of an odd strike. "
"1847760","1850840"," So I bought a house and I've got a."
"1853280","1858260"," I've got a I've got these two trees that are really tall and they cross."
"1858840","1862800"," They're crossing some cable lines from a neighbor and the brand."
"1862940","1868540"," Some of the branches are and the electric line of this house is not buried. "
"1868820","1871420"," So it's like 30 or 40 feet tall."
"1871920","1874540"," And if I drop it, it's going to take everything out."
"1875380","1880680"," It's going to take out my neighbors is going to take out the electric to the house that I bought"
"1880680","1881580"," and all that kind of stuff. "
"1881780","1881840"," Right."
"1882000","1882620"," So what did I do?"
"1883320","1885640"," I looked at a couple of."
"1887000","1890060"," The arborists come out and they were like, you know, it's going to be like 2,500 bucks. "
"1891120","1893640"," And then I thought about renting a scissor lift."
"1894480","1897680"," And that was like 500, 600 bucks."
"1899120","1900800"," And of course I'm cheap as fuck. "
"1900980","1905680"," And I don't want it to get like a local guy to do it because I have hired local guys"
"1905680","1907500"," and they don't always fuck it up."
"1907600","1910940"," But they don't care if they drop a tree in a house or anything else for that matter."
"1912080","1916380"," So we are trading higher still looking for that 447 price target above. "
"1916800","1921940"," Do have some sellers still here be conscience of this 446.45 area."
"1924320","1925380"," So what did I do?"
"1926400","1929260"," So I'm like, I don't want to pay all this money for this, right?"
"1929440","1930660"," And I don't want to do it myself really."
"1931000","1932980"," But what I own is a tree limmer. "
"1934220","1940560"," Got some spy call or puts coming in IWM calls coming in a firm call or puts IWM puts again."
"1942680","1946380"," Small small small amounts, but still worth putting some information."
"1946700","1949900"," You might be able to get some get a nice trade back on this right here. "
"1951420","1956320"," And so what I did was this is I took a tree trimmer like electric tree trimmer and I cut"
"1956320","1958760"," off the middle of it."
"1959340","1962280"," And then I made like a PVC pipe that was like 30 feet long."
"1963500","1964780"," And everything worked. "
"1965200","1967080"," And then I broke one part of it snapped."
"1967800","1971820"," So I have to go back into the engineering drawing board and rebuild this pipe."
"1971820","1977100"," So what I could do is cut that start topping this tree down limb by limb till it gets to"
"1977100","1978160"," like four inches thick. "
"1978640","1982340"," And then I'll climb it and cut the rest of my way myself."
"1982640","1984020"," I think I think so far it's cost me."
"1984620","1989840"," I think I got 100 bucks or something or close to 100 bucks, but I'm such a cheap fuck sometimes. "
"1990400","1993520"," It's weird when you when you flip houses or rehab houses."
"1993520","1998740"," There's all these little things that can put the sum of it all at the end."
"1998880","2001140"," You end up building a house for the cost. "
"2001920","2004980"," So things like this kind of you want to do some things yourself if you can."
"2005640","2006300"," Whenever you can."
"2007640","2010060"," Still looking for this area of volatility above here. "
"2010260","2014860"," 446 now trading 446 4 4 4 4 7 here."
"2017120","2019820"," Just the heads up as we trade forward."
"2020780","2024840"," That those 4 4 5s the algos are now out of them. "
"2025020","2031180"," They're trading at $2.53 algos have now switched to 450 C's."
"2031580","2037720"," They're now 13,000 contracts on 450 C for the 24 for the 21st."
"2038000","2041860"," Those are at 37 cents currently 37 cents. "
"2041860","2046500"," So my assumption is that those algos took the $2.50 in profit."
"2047659","2054620"," Took the money and ran and then threw some money at 450 C's just in case it keeps going there."
"2055060","2059620"," So when necessarily at this point rely upon us going straight to 450 from here. "
"2060020","2061699"," But just be conscious that there are some"
"2061699","2071840"," algos"
"2071840","2071840"," that moved off of."
"2071840","2075900"," Trying to squeeze that last little bit out of this trade."
"2076239","2080659"," So maybe we would we don't go to 450 but there's another trade here for just a few moments. "
"2081560","2084460"," We might have one more push higher to that 4 4 7 mark."
"2089850","2091409"," And they're bouncing back and forth."
"2091949","2096370"," So they're sitting on 4 4 6 now sees and they're they're just tapping. "
"2096630","2101970"," They're going in and out of 450 C's just to push this last little leg higher."
"2101970","2106390"," So you should get one more small leg higher before we get a small pullback."
"2114940","2116860"," I'll get Tesla right now for you guys. "
"2126110","2130050"," You guys see that jump this weekend that Tesla jump that Duke's a hazard stuff."
"2130350","2131870"," That was some wild ass shit huh."
"2133690","2134890"," Balls of steel. "
"2136750","2138290"," Look at Tesla real quick."
"2138550","2139390"," We'll add some."
"2140810","2141890"," Head ons. "
"2143090","2144030"," Close it up."
"2146370","2151990"," Nice trade higher from that 900 resistance coming into the new area of resistance as everyone knows"
"2151990","2153070"," 950."
"2153890","2157230"," The hero indicator is positive currently right now on Tesla. "
"2158010","2158710"," Good eyes."
"2158890","2165470"," We also have some positive call flow coming in on tech across the board calls on Nvidia TQQQ calls"
"2165470","2167390"," on Apple AMD."
"2168070","2171990"," More on Nvidia as well actually Nvidia is just rolling in like crazy. "
"2172610","2173870"," So we'll get Nvidia next."
"2186040","2186980"," Yeah baby."
"2187700","2188380"," Fiverr. "
"2192120","2193020"," Fiverr baby."
"2194600","2195640"," Great morning."

"2199100","2201580"," I watch the I watch."
"2201860","2205400"," I watch the options flow."
"2205400","2210060"," That's one of my best indicators is watching options. "
"2210060","2211220"," The options chains."
"2211900","2212340"," I watch the."
"2213240","2216980"," I watch the algos come in and out of their. "
"2219640","2221200"," You know a lot of news this morning."
"2222040","2226880"," I'm reading a thing right now and everyone's saying there's not a lot of news today or at this"
"2226880","2227720"," moment there isn't."
"2228580","2230180"," Let me see if I can scroll through here. "
"2235400","2237620"," See what's going on here."
"2255580","2258440"," Just a second here."
"2271530","2277750"," Shopify shares celebrating lower selling off following a rally into heading into Friday's close. "
"2277750","2279150"," The Shopify is down."
"2331830","2338170"," A lot of calls coming in right now on Nvidia they are in traffic right now."
"2353160","2355320"," Fast rejection off the spy. "
"2360240","2367700"," We're going to look for some price targets down below look for 443 12 below that."
"2375460","2379080"," Maybe call it not 443 12 caught 442."
"2390560","2391580"," Right down here. "
"2391680","2393100"," This is where it started right at the bell."
"2405060","2407000"," Check out Jivo for you."
"2417420","2418720"," Also watching March. "
"2419500","2422540"," I'm actually watching nice to call expansion right now in the queues."
"2423020","2424980"," Lots of buyers on tech right now."

"2439230","2443190"," So I got this way we got lots of calls on TQQ lots of calls on the queues."
"2444730","2448950"," Big money like I'm seeing the queues just our million dollar."
"2448950","2457490"," Got a million dollar golden ticket on the queues March 31st 356 C 1.2 million dollars TQQs just"
"2457490","2458370"," I've got high. "
"2458610","2459210"," I'll go score."
"2460830","2465270"," Calls on TQQs across the board starting at 944."
"2465270","2467550"," I think they've been going in since 930. "
"2468550","2473070"," That's interesting to see this bounce could be short lived this morning."
"2473970","2480670"," So we'll take a look down below here 443.21. We also have some buyers stepping in watch my cursor"
"2480670","2481310"," right here."
"2481630","2484410"," Some buyers stepping in currently at 44560. "
"2484970","2486490"," You can see this here real quick."
"2486950","2488910"," You can see these buyers stepping in."
"2489530","2492130"," You can see the turn here on the spy. "
"2492630","2494530"," I never liked buying first bounces though."
"2503830","2507130"," Quick fast reversal on the VIX this morning."
"2509570","2511670"," Trying to break through 2385. "
"2511670","2521630"," And still major call holders sitting in."
"2522510","2527310"," Still major call holders sitting in on me a second there."
"2529310","2533790"," You got to turn the I can hear some some people talking in the. "
"2536150","2536710"," Okay."
"2537090","2540110"," And one other thing to note of is that we've got oxy calls."
"2540850","2544930"," This is for July 15 to 85 C 87,000 dollars. "
"2545050","2550990"," But to follow along with that we have calls on CLF April 14, 32.5 C."
"2552130","2556730"," High August score $127,000 some puts rolling in right now on the spy and apple."
"2560920","2562440"," Nice quick roll over."
"2562440","2567100"," I think this morning charted out 447 as a top and then a roll over. "
"2567180","2569800"," We'll see how deep this roll over actually goes."
"2583140","2583620"," Okay."
"2583840","2584880"," So Jevo, right?"
"2585200","2586500"," Take a look at Jevo. "
"2592110","2597310"," Gevo Martin Jevo Martin Gekko was that guy was Gekko's name was the Martin."
"2597990","2598850"," I remember."
"2601370","2602930"," Looks like it's squeezable. "
"2606360","2608080"," It's right at some resistance."
"2609180","2611060"," More sellers than buyers currently though."
"2614020","2615920"," Some some support here. "
"2622190","2623210"," Spike higher."
"2625070","2626650"," Are they trading on some news?"
"2628210","2628930"," That's nice though."
"2631130","2632470"," They like it. "
"2633450","2636610"," Traded all the way up to 15, 1557 or something."
"2638750","2640270"," Wants to squeeze huh?"
"2646380","2648140"," Has a lot to break here though."
"2648920","2658720"," A lot"
"2662780","2666280"," of sellers pushers down here right where it's at at 472. "
"2671120","2672340"," Kiss for 90."
"2680850","2682610"," Is that what you're trying for right there?"
"2685310","2686610"," I will set some alerts."
"2705120","2706360"," All right done. "
"2709940","2711360"," I will keep an eye on it."
"2719990","2722110"," I'm not hearing any audio squawk right now."
"2727860","2729080"," Keep that lower over there. "
"2730160","2731360"," Let's see if it's because I'm not."
"2731580","2733000"," Let me see if I have my audio on here."
"2734180","2736840"," It says I've got my desktop audio on so we should be good. "
"2750700","2754360"," Russian court decision bands, Facebook and Instagram and Russia."
"2754360","2755760"," Yeah, we already knew that though."
"2799080","2808820"," A little bit of a bounce on the spy at"
"2822290","2824490"," price target down below is 43 10. "
"2831270","2835930"," I'm going to make a mark out of my chart 43, 43, 10."
"2838590","2840430"," See if we can hit that 4, 4, 3, 10."
"2843770","2846010"," We'll see if this supports sticks down here or not. "
"2855410","2856310"," Can I check bubble?"
"2856670","2856730"," Sure."
"2860130","2861850"," Jevo got a major deal with an airline company."
"2867820","2868340"," BMDL. "
"2873650","2875990"," Everybody wants to go into bubble and then go on a date."
"2879070","2885890"," Spy still trading lower looking for that 4, 4, 3.10. If you are on puts right here, you may"
"2885890","2887850"," want to take some profit."
"2888790","2894370"," And what you'll do is wait for the next, the next squeeze higher than grab a second short. "
"2901880","2903920"," So, Bumble sold off briefly."
"2905620","2906740"," Actually, I've got, you know, it's funny."
"2906900","2911920"," I've got Bumble charted from the other day. "
"2911980","2913060"," You guys remember when I charted Bumble?"
"2913760","2915180"," You guys want to see what it looks like now?"
"2916400","2916900"," Look at that."
"2918940","2920320"," Here goes that Bumble chart."
"2922120","2924420"," Look at that. "
"2925080","2925480"," Bam."
"2926660","2929780"," And it's reversing right where I had this line the other day."
"2930380","2932560"," So each we charted this last week at some point. "
"2932600","2933700"," You can go back and watch the video."
"2934400","2935920"," And it's reversing slightly."
"2936460","2936800"," Look at that. "
"2936920","2939200"," Just bounced here, took down, came back up."
"2939400","2941020"," This is all to be expected, right?"
"2941720","2945640"," And so what would you be expecting in here is just a little bit of consolidation."
"2946680","2947400"," It's all you'd be looking for. "
"2947400","2948760"," This is the exact same chart I've made."
"2949040","2949980"," Changes do it or nothing."
"2950720","2951440"," No changes. "
"2951920","2953240"," So what would you be looking for here?"
"2953900","2954000"," Right?"
"2954120","2955060"," We talked about this all the time."
"2955100","2957020"," Are you looking for some kind of a consolidation?"
"2957300","2958400"," You want to see that consolidation?"
"2959220","2959940"," And then I move higher?"
"2961100","2966780"," And also within this consolidation, you guys all know about like two time failures, three time"
"2966780","2968960"," failures, two times, and then we go."
"2969340","2975260"," And then if we are going, if we are going to in any way, shape or form, you can tighten"
"2975260","2975900"," this up too. "
"2976300","2978120"," You could say that we're in here."
"2979700","2982140"," This looks like some better support in here now."
"2982580","2983800"," We've gotten this high, right?"
"2984320","2989580"," But you would want, if this is our trading range, let's say 25 to 30 is our trading range, then"
"2989580","2995140"," you're going to be looking to buy, if you're a bull, reentering buying in some lower area outside"
"2995140","2997020"," of our, our trading range. "
"2997020","2997320"," Okay."
"2997340","3004620"," So even if, even if we bounce, even if we take one bounce, let's say at 25, 48, you are"
"3004620","3008460"," looking for, for a move actually out of a trading range."
"3009160","3018060"," Looking for some consolidation and your next price target is $34. "
"3020780","3023700"," Good job on that bumble trade, whoever called that out last week."
"3026240","3028780"," And we'll look at the, we'll look at."
"3030620","3036040"," So you've got this support right here on bumble currently at $28. "
"3036980","3039300"," Let's see if there's any support down below."
"3040500","3042700"," Or if it sticks and keeps moving higher."
"3043460","3046740"," Here's some support at $25 right in here. "
"3047580","3049220"," I think that's what we were talking about, right?"
"3049520","3050440"," And then big buyers."
"3050660","3052520"," See what the big buyers are right here, $21."
"3053540","3058540"," So keep your eyes on $21 if you missed the bumble trade and want to grab bumble again. "
"3058540","3062200"," I'm not saying we're going to go down here, but see the sellers here on the right hand side, $80 "
"3062200","3064100",",000, $30,000, $33,000 buyers."
"3064820","3068420"," Just be mark on your charts, like $21 bucks."
"3068620","3069440"," It doesn't make me go there. "
"3069540","3073500"," I'm just saying that if there's a brief loan where you go that you can put a buy order in"
"3073500","3073860"," at $21."
"3074400","3075460"," If it fails, it fails."
"3075860","3079700"," If it happens at 4 a.m. It happens at 4 a.m. If it doesn't happen, it's just one"
"3079700","3080460"," more trade that you missed. "
"3080800","3086380"," You add alerts on 100, 200 tickers and wait for it to come to you."
"3087240","3088540"," Good job in that bumble."
"3089980","3093140"," Take a look at Tesla, bouncing off resistance at $950. "
"3094060","3095080"," Tesla's a great day trader."
"3095440","3096560"," I love Tesla as a day trader."
"3097240","3099880"," It's such a great ticker to trade, right?"
"3100600","3102280"," Kind of know where resistance is. "
"3102480","3103560"," Kind of know where support is."
"3104180","3108420"," And you can see that there's a big fight between $9.27 and $950."
"3109360","3110660"," We have some intraday support. "
"3110860","3113160"," It looks like fighting for VWAP here."
"3113160","3115140"," And let's say you didn't trade."
"3115340","3117160"," Let's say you pick up Tesla as a ticker that you trade. "
"3117500","3118460"," You don't trade it every day."
"3118620","3123640"," You're just waiting for that one time of the day where it trades lower at the lower support, right?"
"3123860","3128000"," If you missed the trade, it's four out of the five days, but that one day comes down here."
"3128340","3129500"," You grab Tesla at 900. "
"3129640","3130600"," You can trade it to 950."
"3132040","3135560"," The hero indicator is starting to turn down slightly on Tesla here."
"3136080","3137580"," So we'll just keep an eye on it in the background. "
"3139260","3141860"," Had a nice bounce down below on 43."
"3143100","3144960"," We'll call it 44 330."
"3146620","3151660"," If you were in short on spy, we talked about taking some of that profit, right?"
"3152320","3153060"," Take that first. "
"3153720","3158020"," Take that first one and then wait for the second one."
"3158480","3165060"," We're going to see here if we're going to see if see this trade higher came down here, right?"
"3165060","3166560"," We're in this line right here."
"3166960","3168560"," Rick a shade off here. "
"3169240","3169300"," Right?"
"3170340","3175160"," Take your money and run and then maybe reenter again for the next leg down."
"3176620","3178720"," So where's our price target down below?"
"3179320","3183480"," We've got 40 43 12 and then below that."
"3186160","3188100"," They can scoop this in here. "
"3193340","3194300"," Hold on here."
"3195720","3197020"," Know what I'm doing here."
"3197720","3198820"," Doing some weird stuff. "
"3199940","3202140"," Just auto kick this thing back into play."
"3206240","3209160"," Next price target down is going to be 44310."
"3210140","3216900"," And then we're going to be looking for some kind of a move off of this trend line or even"
"3216900","3218360"," lower to 440 55. "
"3233580","3236320"," And what you'll end up doing here is you'll end up giving the bulls."
"3236680","3237940"," The bulls will take two chances, right?"
"3238220","3241960"," One, two, and then reversal to bring it back over here and show what I'm talking about."
"3243520","3248900"," You'll get something like, you know, you get something like this, right?"
"3248900","3250000"," We fall below. "
"3250860","3254000"," You give the bulls one chance, two chance, and then boom."
"3254920","3255440"," We go down."
"3255680","3255760"," Okay. "
"3257680","3259620"," Do you guys understand what I'm talking about here?"
"3260460","3264160"," The bulls will try to maintain it and then they'll start to sell it down from here."
"3267360","3267760"," Ready?"
"3267880","3268020"," Ready?"
"3268200","3270880"," Go one, two, and three and then boom."
"3271060","3271500"," We're going down. "
"3271760","3273220"," So just give it a second before you reenter your shorts."
"3274820","3276660"," This will take a few minutes, I think."
"3285160","3287660"," We even have another target higher at 44635. "
"3289180","3290460"," Mark that one down as well."
"3305150","3307030"," 44630, I guess, slightly lower."
"3307170","3310570"," There's a little bit of a little bit of ice down here to 44592. "
"3320330","3324230"," So I just marked this one as a resistance point and even higher."
"3324750","3330490"," If the bulls can pull it back up, maybe they get to here."
"3331090","3333310"," That would be your two time failure over here as well. "
"3333550","3334210"," That would work too."
"3334970","3338490"," So if you're going to start taking another short position, you could start here."
"3338870","3343370"," A, B, and then C is the next leg down, maybe somewhere in here. "
"3350400","3351560"," Daytrading 101, baby."
"3352820","3353380"," Daytrading 101."
"3358120","3362280"," Yeah, I saw a bid coming into Oxy and oil CLF as well. "
"3362820","3364220"," So what are you guys I'm going to look at?"
"3364360","3364860"," You guys want to look at Oxy?"
"3365260","3369260"," I saw a bid coming in off the bell this morning on those tickers."
"3373340","3374200"," So we'll take a look at Oxy."
"3375840","3377940"," Oil was up in the overnight as well, right?"
"3377940","3379700"," Oil is not done going up either. "
"3379840","3380880"," Oh, yeah, I didn't even notice that."
"3381220","3386760"," So oil went from $57.91 straight and pinged off $61.80. Nice trade."
"3389660","3390880"," Sellers above at $63. "
"3391440","3392780"," You guys always know when you're trading."
"3393920","3396960"," When you guys are trading oil, I don't know how many you trade oil."
"3397260","3399280"," I haven't traded it in a while, but I used to trade it all the time. "
"3401460","3402360"," We'll keep it for a minute."
"3402460","3403540"," You guys want to see if you go higher?"
"3404680","3405660"," More sellers."
"3405920","3406320"," Where's he at?"
"3406420","3412360"," Sellers here at $62.91, $64.81, clear skies above $66. "
"3413780","3415820"," No more sellers until $70."
"3416820","3420800"," Now, there are more buyers than sellers currently on oil."
"3422380","3424420"," Looking for a squeeze higher here. "
"3430160","3439520"," If you guys trade commodities in the cash market, it's very similar to trading the smaller, the"
"3439520","3441420"," smaller components of the spy, right?"
"3441960","3442720"," It's all about timing."
"3444620","3447060"," You know, that's an options chain that I used to watch all the time."
"3447160","3450700"," Any of the smaller components, any of the commodity type of tickers like Oxy is a good one. "
"3453280","3457100"," You really have to pay attention to when to enter and when to exit."
"3461070","3467510"," Because you'll stay stagnant all day long and then I'll pop in pre-market or after hours."
"3482120","3484700"," So you're just kind of waiting for a move below. "
"3485560","3486480"," One, two wins."
"3487280","3490960"," And any of these smaller bounces or wins as well, as you can see, right?"
"3492820","3494460"," Move that one off here."
"3502860","3504020"," Spy still reversing. "
"3516060","3519340"," See if these buy looks like we're getting a little bit of a rug pull down here."
"3519480","3525980"," You can see that the buyers down here at $44.30, they're kind of got missing, right?"
"3526700","3529300"," You can see that they're slightly missing down here."
"3530360","3532960"," Or they've somewhat moved up as well. "
"3533960","3540300"," If this 443 fails, next target, 44269."
"3542320","3545140"," Yeah, 44280, 44269."
"3547480","3550200"," And the last hope for the bulls would be 44140. "
"3551300","3553960"," Price target below is 440."
"3553960","3557640"," It's 440, baby."
"3565120","3566540"," So you're going to look at USO next. "
"3577860","3581560"," Let's check the here indicator briefly and just see if it's still rolling negative."
"3582260","3584940"," A little bit of a curl up here, a little bit of trying to save it."
"3585780","3589020"," More puts coming in on the spy, cues, Netflix. "
"3590140","3592660"," Some puts coming in on Oxy right now as well."
"3596140","3599060"," We'll see if this doesn't hold here, we're probably going to make a leg down."
"3601960","3605800"," And we'll take a look at a better chart, a better day trading chart. "
"3606960","3611080"," See if we can see that nice rolling over here."
"3611780","3615080"," You know that this has this 443 is kind of going away."
"3616420","3618140"," That's a rug pull right there. "
"3618140","3620720"," So you've got clear skies down at 440 at this point."
"3620820","3624440"," It looks like there's some volatility you should see up, down, up, down."
"3624780","3625740"," But I do want you to be aware of this. "
"3625840","3630880"," When you're seeing this, when you start to see the creepy crawly right, when you don't see, this is"
"3630880","3632700"," a teaching moment, okay?"
"3633340","3635900"," I want to give a teaching moment to you guys right now."
"3636200","3638180"," You can't pay for this shit out there, okay?"
"3639200","3640520"," I want to show you something, okay?"
"3641140","3645140"," If you don't see violent moves like this, right?"
"3645140","3650480"," If you don't see that and you see this kind of bullshit here, when you see this kind of stuff"
"3650480","3655000"," like this, this kind of creepy crawly, when you see creepy crawly, right?"
"3655240","3658180"," It's like 95% fucking chance that we're going down, okay?"
"3659300","3663860"," So when you see creepy crawly down, creepy crawly, you know what this is right here?"
"3664300","3665960"," This is fucking call sellers in here."
"3666060","3668800"," That's all they're doing is just sawing their fucking calls, okay?"
"3668940","3674400"," So when you see the creepy crawly down like this, when you see this, is this specific movement that"
"3674400","3675420"," we're watching right now?"
"3675880","3676800"," See this right here?"
"3677440","3678540"," This creepy crawly shit?"
"3679240","3682680"," We're not going to do any of this nonsense, okay?"
"3682920","3684560"," It's going to literally just bottom out. "
"3684780","3689760"," So when you see this when you're trading and you're like, oh, hey cap, I see this creepy crawly"
"3689760","3690640"," moved down, right?"
"3691180","3693060"," Nine times out of ten, it's going to fucking dump."
"3694040","3695340"," Let's be aware of that, okay?"
"3695640","3700080"," If you're a trader and you don't know this already, I'm fucking telling you, when you see this"
"3700080","3701720"," creepy crawly down here, right?"
"3701980","3705420"," This usually shits the fucking bed, like nine out of ten times."
"3705640","3710060"," Watch it not, watch it not shit the bed right now, but I'm promising you at any other time, okay?"
"3710820","3712440"," If you see this creepy crawly, right?"
"3712520","3715780"," When you see this creepy crawly, this isn't actually an internal market action that's taking place,"
"3716300","3722720"," and it's just watching bulls just as fiercely as possible start selling calls, closing them, they"
"3722720","3724240"," were literally closing them out right now. "
"3724960","3731960"," So just, just be, just be, when you see this kind of stuff here, you typically don't see huge, huge"
"3731960","3732560"," moves up."
"3732700","3737120"," You typically just see the creepy crawly down, and it just creepy crawly is creepy crawly as it"
"3737120","3738220"," eventually shoots down."
"3739740","3743620"," This is a good, I haven't seen one of these in a little bit, and I wanted to show you"
"3743620","3744020"," guys this. "
"3745220","3747260"," I've been meaning to show you guys one of these actions."
"3748120","3752900"," When you see this stuff like this, it's very bearish, just so you know, very bearish."
"3756760","3758440"," Very, very bearish. "
"3761120","3762040"," Mark my words."
"3762760","3771850"," I don't know how many of you guys know that."
"3771950","3778030"," This creepy crawly downward move right here, it's like a classic trading step. "
"3778170","3782490"," I've never seen anybody talk about it on the internet, so I'm always like, oh, whatever, I see this"
"3782490","3783410"," creepy crawly shit."
"3784710","3786470"," It's like a sure sign we're going down."
"3789150","3789570"," Watch. "
"3789890","3793470"," If you just watch, it's like short sides."
"3794150","3795970"," All that creepy crawly stuff right here."
"3796370","3798190"," Don't believe any of this bullshit right here. "
"3800630","3804170"," All this creepy crawly, creepy crawly."
"3805010","3807430"," So I'm going to be looking to take a short here in just a minute."
"3812700","3813810"," I'm going to be entering 443Ps. "
"3815800","3818180"," I haven't bought them yet, but I'm going to be buying them here in just a moment."
"3820200","3821780"," Unless I see something that I don't."
"3821840","3824280"," Unless I see something that I don't fucking know about. "
"3825460","3826880"," Unless I see something crazy."
"3827380","3829540"," I'm going to be looking to enter a short here in just a moment."
"3831100","3832440"," Oh, that creepy crawly. "
"3833080","3836800"," Oh, that little spider or something trying to come down."
"3837700","3838680"," Just looking to get shorted."
"3875520","3877160"," Oh, let me get a good price. "
"3877620","3878840"," We get a good price here."
"3878840","3879820"," Just give me a second here."
"3934900","3935860"," Come on, Phil. "
"3936500","3937540"," What the fuck, man?"
"3951940","3952380"," Sweet."
"3957460","3958580"," Good morning, everybody."
"3958880","3959340"," Good morning, Lawrence. "
"3959560","3959880"," How are you?"
"3960680","3961320"," Creepy crawly, James."
"3964300","3970580"," Yeah, so we'll see when you see that creepy crawly stuff."
"3970580","3971100"," It's going on right now. "
"3971120","3971800"," Market internals."
"3972480","3973960"," It's not a hundred percent of the time."
"3974720","3979240"," And, you know, of course it might reverse today, but in general, if you see that creepy crawly move"
"3979240","3982660"," down like that, it's a lot of. "
"3982760","3986120"," And RSN neurosense therapeutics here is continuing higher here."
"3986940","3990940"," Moving above the $4 level of 196%."
"3992280","3998900"," Again, company earlier announced that it received FDA clearance of ID for prime C for the treatment"
"3998900","3999500"," of ALS. "
"4002210","4011370"," And shares, again, up above the 450 level now, up around 200% for November, Romeo, Sandy, November,"
"4011770","4012350"," and RSN."
"4027360","4031280"," Yeah, someone's commenting on Ben Zinga that they weren't hearing squawk this morning."
"4033320","4037180"," And there's comments in the feed that no one's hearing the squawk this morning. "
"4037400","4040520"," I think it's just a non-newsday, but I could be wrong."
"4040740","4043900"," Looks like the squawk is down on Ben Zinga this morning."
"4044680","4046980"," Not fully, but what it is down. "
"4050680","4054720"," So I am short the market if anyone wants to know."
"4071880","4072840"," Yeah, we can trade higher."
"4073020","4073280"," I don't care. "
"4074140","4075060"," I'm still short the market here."
"4076000","4079840"," And I'm assuming that bulls are going to want to get a better entry price as well."
"4080540","4081980"," Bulls are going to want to buy that 440. "
"4082740","4084440"," Some bulls are going to want to buy 430."
"4087240","4092820"," So I'll stay short into, I don't think I would get squeezed out until 450."
"4106210","4108729"," So Sam's saying that big news is coming out right now. "
"4108729","4109290"," Big news."
"4109729","4110970"," Rush has got fighting news."
"4117800","4119660"," Let me see if I can bring up my. "
"4121100","4121840"," Yeah, it's weird."
"4122000","4122319"," You know, it's weird."
"4122439","4124020"," I just signed up for Ben Zinga. "
"4124200","4125460"," It's like same prices."
"4127120","4128460"," Same price as trade the news."
"4128899","4130180"," I signed up for because I wanted. "
"4131260","4133399"," They said that Ben Zinga's got a better."
"4134840","4135640"," Better news."
"4141479","4145800"," And I'm not seeing better news so far on Ben Zinga or faster news. "
"4147100","4148660"," So I might have to go back to trade the news."
"4148819","4152840"," I think you know, the thing about trade the news is I think that they."
"4154300","4161000"," I think that they do a good job with Bloomberg terminal news, the news that actually matters. "
"4161000","4162279"," I could be wrong."
"4162279","4165399"," Maybe it's just one of the chat rooms is saying that."
"4167180","4168140"," It's saying that. "
"4171020","4177979"," So, or saying that the new squawk is down for Bloomberg or for Ben Zinga."
"4178140","4183620"," So we'll give it a chance this morning and see if their news comes back online."
"4184359","4185399"," Their squawk comes back online. "
"4185800","4187939"," Looks like I'm just getting one of their feeds right now, but not both."
"4190399","4196100"," And Walter Bloomberg is reporting that Russia says Biden comments may have caused a breach in US"
"4196100","4196760"," relations."
"4197760","4198200"," Yeah. "
"4199580","4202480"," UK prepares temporarily nationalized gas prom."
"4203220","4205160"," Yeah, we're not getting any of this news right now."
"4205200","4207460"," Normally, I think no trade the news would be out with this. "
"4210920","4212440"," News would be out with this news."
"4212460","4213660"," If it was if it mattered."
"4215420","4215850"," Watching. "
"4219850","4220910"," Let's see."
"4221390","4225770"," Some puts on oxy puts on silver calls on GM."
"4226790","4232670"," Calls on IWM March 21st, 207 C for $156,000. "
"4233150","4239590"," Calls on IW again, 321 207 C for $247,000 puts on the spy."
"4240410","4244210"," March 21st, 444 P for $204,000."
"4245130","4251290"," Calls on the cues March 21st, 349 C for $283,000 calls on the cues again. "
"4252330","4256130"," March 21st, 349 C, $194,000."
"4269440","4271240"," Putting the cut ties as it says."
"4271440","4275320"," So Sam saying big news coming out right now, Russia with fighting words threatening to cut ties"
"4275320","4276300"," with the ambassador. "
"4279220","4281340"," RSN shares halted on the circuit breaker."
"4283240","4284680"," Neuroscience therapeutics."
"4286700","4294340"," Shares up 293% halted at 584 or November Romeo, Sandy November and RSN. "
"4297080","4302080"," Yes, they did open Russian markets today, but they only opened them for."
"4303000","4304160"," I think it was."
"4304780","4306420"," Or I think it was for bonds. "
"4307360","4308880"," That's all I think that it was for."
"4311060","4313000"," Yeah, I'll show you where the buyers are for cues."
"4316380","4317960"," So you guys want to price target on the cues. "
"4325120","4326880"," See if you can subscribe to that one."
"4333960","4335100"," We'll let this load up."
"4342360","4344760"," Yeah, the cues don't want to see a drop here, right?"
"4345680","4348660"," Definitely don't want to see a move below on the cues here. "
"4349140","4351740"," Seeing some nice support down below here at 347."
"4360810","4368760"," Price target below 345.50. Next leg would be 340."
"4370680","4371680"," That's quite major. "
"4373100","4375040"," You don't want to see a break of the cues."
"4376840","4384820"," A 347.07. Yeah, pretty pretty pretty pretty large move down."
"4385560","4387040"," So we'll keep an eye on this. "
"4387420","4389520"," Here indicator is negative currently in the cues."
"4389980","4395180"," You can see distribution taking place, even though they're sitting on support currently on the cues"
"4395180","4395780"," as well."
"4401520","4407440"," Watching the same kind of a thing take place right now on the spy, right?"
"4407440","4409240"," We're on this support down here, 443. "
"4409860","4413320"," We'll see if it just continues to have some distribution and a move down."
"4413440","4416600"," My price target right now on the spy is 440."
"4418940","4425500"," Should be some volatility on the way down, but you're looking for somewhere right in here. "
"4427000","4428180"," Right down in here."
"4431620","4441260"," So we called the move higher off the bell this morning, and now we're calling a move lower"
"4441260","4443060"," on the spy this morning."
"4443060","4447320"," So we'll see if we get a fat print here or not, or if it can hold it 443. "
"4448660","4453500"," We'd need some news to probably push the spy up at this time."
"4453500","4456720"," So be aware of headline news as it releases here."
"4508500","4511500"," Just nasty right now. "
"4518270","4521970"," Make me some money, baby printed for daddy."
"4526730","4528110"," Make me some more money."
"4529290","4532610"," See if this holds or not. "
"4536640","4538920"," Oh, that creepy crawly."
"4539200","4541020"," You don't like that creepy crawly out there."
"4542240","4543140"," Can anybody confirm?"
"4543680","4544020"," Can anybody. "
"4545320","4550880"," Can anybody confirm what time that J-POW speech actually is?"
"4551660","4554060"," I saw something that said it was at 4pm."
"4554500","4555940"," I don't know if that was correct or not."
"4557880","4559160"," I don't know if that was correct. "
"4559340","4565500"," I keep hearing conflicting reports of whether it's at"
"4565500","4569980"," 12 or four."
"4570460","4572620"," I think you guys saw the economic calendar that I had."
"4573620","4574360"," Another bounce. "
"4574640","4576500"," Let's reach a test down below here at this."
"4576680","4581440"," And our sense here is resuming trade, neuroscience, therapeutics, and pulling back from some"
"4581440","4583460"," session highs nearing the six dollar level."
"4585260","4587720"," It's interesting that there's support here. "
"4587980","4592960"," So up around 240% for November, Romeo, Sani, November, and RSN."
"4597980","4601900"," I'm currently in 440 or 440 P's."
"4603520","4604740"," Looking for a price target of 440. "
"4606120","4607080"," On the spy."
"4610440","4619140"," And I will hold those until unless I get squeezed out above at 445.90. I got in."
"4621300","4623380"," So we'll see if this holds or. "
"4624420","4627340"," But I think I think I hold them the 450 to be honest with you."
"4627780","4633980"," Unless we had some headline news watching puts come in on heavy on XL V June 17th."
"4633980","4641140"," 130 P QQ Q's golden ticket three March 30 340 P 1.8 million dollars. "
"4641280","4644360"," Maybe you're going to see some weakness today on just hedging taking place."
"4644760","4647100"," Noticing some hedging coming into the market right now."
"4647460","4653900"," Q's March 30 340 P half million dollars spy March 21st. "
"4654080","4656480"," 441 P 177 thousand dollars."
"4659960","4665120"," Also just to note or just to note right now."
"4665120","4670140"," The algos are sitting on spy 443 P."
"4670800","4672200"," 55,000 contracts. "
"4672540","4675880"," They did switch from the from the call to the put side currently."
"4676100","4677080"," Just be aware of that."
"4677600","4682320"," That when they switched over like that, that you know, they are influencing the market right now. "
"4682780","4688960"," Even if we trade higher, just be just be conscious of the algos being on the put side of things."
"4697080","4698400"," So it's the chair speech."
"4698700","4700680"," Paul is at 1230, right?"
"4702240","4703540"," The news guy is a little high. "
"4703740","4704360"," Thanks for saying something."
"4704560","4705160"," I'll turn him down."
"4705740","4706860"," Give me just a minute here. "
"4707540","4708800"," Thanks for saying he's a little loud."
"4710640","4712100"," I just turned him down now."
"4712180","4714140"," Let me know if that's a better volume for you. "
"4715000","4718120"," As someone else is saying it's 12 Eastern standard time."
"4718120","4719940"," So you got a bunch of different."
"4722740","4724580"," Yeah, I'm in I'm in zero day puts. "
"4724940","4726280"," Fuck yeah, I'm in zero day puts."
"4726500","4727480"," Fuck you guys kidding me?"
"4727620","4728760"," Of course I'm in zero day puts."
"4730320","4732180"," Yes, I'm in zero day puts. "
"4735520","4737060"," Yes, yes I am."
"4743580","4747960"," Put on TSM April 14th, 115 P."
"4750140","4752520"," 933,000 dollars on TSM."
"4752880","4754700"," So we'll take a look at TSM real quick. "
"4756060","4757100"," We'll load TSM up."
"4759680","4762880"," I wonder if this is that had some negative headline news."
"4763060","4765940"," Maybe this is more some China news that we haven't seen yet. "
"4779530","4781410"," VIX is still trading higher."
"4787100","4789140"," A small rejection on VIX."
"4789200","4791740"," We need a nice VIX fat VIX spike right here. "
"4792460","4793420"," More spy puts."
"4816780","4818360"," More touchy down below."
"4826100","4828120"," TSM selling down to 105. "
"4828680","4829240"," I don't know about it."
"4829320","4830900"," I don't know if it's a TSM news currently."
"4847410","4850050"," Spy test starting to test lower bounds here. "
"4850750","4852110"," Might get a nice fat break."
"4920180","4923360"," Byers stepping in currently trying to hold the line here."
"4924060","4926100"," See all these big green balls right here on the cues. "
"4926700","4928380"," We'll check out TSM real quick too."
"4929080","4930500"," It's kind of floating around."
"4941780","4944160"," Finding support down here at 105. "
"4954540","4955600"," And 100."
"4957000","4957400"," Some buyers."
"4962100","4964340"," 95 has a much larger concentration. "
"4968640","4972120"," This could be bottom or a nice blast through here."
"4973020","4975220"," We need to be looking for some news to send us lower."
"4998060","5002020"," We need to see this 4.42 79 break. "
"5040540","5041780"," Let's get that away for us."
"5041940","5043920"," The only number you guys need to do."
"5044220","5044820"," So there's a note. "
"5045000","5047120"," I'll see you guys posting a bunch of Adam Dancini stuff."
"5047460","5049020"," So forget Adam and he's been seen."
"5049220","5050940"," The only thing you guys need to know about. "
"5050940","5052720"," I don't know what he's saying."
"5053640","5060100"," The key that you need to understand here is you don't want to see a break below 440 basically."
"5060420","5061360"," I don't know. "
"5061520","5062340"," Let me firm this up."
"5065160","5067820"," I got some wonky ass shit going on here this morning."
"5070400","5073820"," This morning at 3am I was doing all my charts for the day. "
"5074480","5078500"," And for some reason they didn't transfer over from one."
"5083970","5086590"," They didn't transfer over from one."
"5088150","5090650"," EC or from my laptop to my. "
"5091410","5092190"," You know I."
"5092430","5095270"," I like to have women in my life right."
"5095530","5099490"," So I got a woman a woman that's that's cuddlin up next to me."
"5099570","5104110"," I really don't want to be getting out of bed at 5am for anybody. "
"5104890","5109630"," So let's let me see if I can make this a better."
"5113510","5116330"," Let's make this a little bit better here so I can explain it better."
"5119230","5121630"," Maybe that maybe that's the way to look at it. "
"5127890","5129730"," So the exam would be."
"5131130","5134270"," So you don't trade when you trade outside of a."
"5136010","5138650"," I don't this isn't going to really do it well for you but."
"5139630","5142770"," So let's look at it from this point okay if you're trading. "
"5143050","5146350"," We always talk about trading in ranges right if you're trading in a range."
"5147610","5152450"," And so this is a range that we're trading in right here let me get rid of this."
"5153990","5158670"," It's like a range that we're trading in right you trade within a range that you're currently in. "
"5159310","5163110"," And then sometimes you come out of that range now this is sloppy right now."
"5163590","5164070"," But."
"5164990","5171250"," You trade outside of that range right outside of that range touched it down here and this goes back"
"5171250","5172670"," back here somewhere. "
"5174690","5177230"," I'm doing this note like a fun the fly here I'm not really."
"5177890","5181590"," And but you can see that you can like hey can buy this I can buy this I can buy"
"5181590","5182690"," this down here right."
"5183310","5189010"," And we just broke right so we just broke right so when we break out of trading ranges. "
"5190530","5194650"," They're good dips to buy so if you're trading in here these really you don't want to really buy"
"5194650","5195030"," this."
"5195570","5198650"," You want to buy this down here that's the one you really want."
"5199370","5204950"," Right the same thing for selling right you don't want to be selling so much this here. "
"5205570","5209890"," You want to be selling this right here right that's really what you want to be what you want to"
"5209890","5210250"," be selling."
"5210510","5215550"," Well at least that's what I try to do so currently right now we are trading below that channel"
"5215550","5215890"," right."
"5215890","5221290"," So this is either a really good buying opportunity right now or. "
"5223390","5228970"," And the reason why the reason why we bring up for 40 is because when you're trading out of out"
"5228970","5232090"," of bounds and you say to a bull when you say hey bulls you have to hold this level."
"5232490","5237530"," It's because when you when you trade out when you're trading inside of a range in here right."
"5238650","5245090"," Even if you pull down and out of your trading range and it gets saved the your your channel is"
"5245090","5246430"," still saved does that make sense. "
"5247010","5251910"," So if you break that lower bound forget all the other numbers right now the only thing you guys"
"5251910","5253610"," need to know especially if you're a bull or bear."
"5253970","5257790"," Is that if we trade in here typically where we have been right."
"5258590","5264630"," You don't want to see us break below this okay because that is what ends up giving you that move"
"5264630","5266450"," down to 430 okay. "
"5266450","5270290"," So this is that this is the real area of contention down here."
"5270730","5274450"," You don't want to be so so what's the keys here right."
"5274870","5281750"," The keys are that if you're a bull you want to see us test 440 right and then come back"
"5281750","5282790"," into our trading range. "
"5283590","5288710"," If you're a bear right so that's what you're looking for right you're looking for this believe it"
"5288710","5290230"," or not you're not looking for this right here."
"5290650","5294330"," You're not going to tell me they've been trading higher for five fucking days and that we're just"
"5294330","5296690"," going to bounce right here because we didn't we broke right."
"5297050","5299550"," So if you're a bull you want to save here 440. "
"5300150","5304790"," If you're a bear you like we want to get super uber bearish I want to order short to look"
"5304790","5308630"," under this market I should have got the short up here but I missed it cap and I'm too scared"
"5308630","5309250"," right here cap."
"5309830","5316150"," Well to be honest with you right you'd be looking for some kind of a move down below 440 and"
"5316150","5318950"," this would be the big short like this is the actual safest."
"5318950","5324430"," Is actually here so you actually might even miss this here you wait when it comes back up and"
"5324430","5328870"," rejects off 440 that's when you actually take that take the big short for the big money. "
"5329210","5334350"," So be patient being a bear you have to be patient you could you could wait for this rejection here"
"5334350","5337250"," for this move down to 440 if you wanted to right."
"5337450","5339830"," It depends on how much risk you want to put on the market right."
"5340230","5344810"," When I take shorts over here sometimes or when I buy puts if I'm going to buy a put here"
"5344810","5346090"," I'm going to try to get it cheap right. "
"5346090","5352430"," I don't want to be buying like I don't know expensive as puts up here and have us blast higher"
"5352430","5359890"," and get stopped out so if you want to buy some cheap just wait to see if this rejects."
"5359950","5366610"," So this is your next rejection level right here just give it a minute right and your rejection"
"5366610","5371370"," level is going to be if it even gets there is going to be 444 this next leg to 440."
"5373490","5379430"," It's helping you guys out here but when I see this creepy crawly shit like this right here telling"
"5379430","5383770"," you I want to see this creepy crawly moves like this man I'm telling you this all with not always"
"5383770","5385030"," like nine out of ten times. "
"5386350","5393650"," Eventually it just leads to fucking capitulation almost almost every time this is not bullish just"
"5393650","5397930"," as a heads up if you're a bull this is not bullish here just just intraday it's not bullish."
"5398510","5400770"," So you need some headline news to send us higher."
"5401850","5407910"," I need some kind of like somebody come out there you need J.P.O. coming out at 1036 you"
"5407910","5417830"," need J.P.O. to save your ass at some point today and hopefully you can get some"
"5417830","5418030"," love. "
"5418430","5421710"," So there you go right you're going to be looking for this right here so you've had that first one"
"5421710","5422870"," the first break right here."
"5422870","5427930"," This is a move down and now you're looking for the next one right here to take down right if"
"5427930","5432250"," you've traded futures this is the same shit that you do in futures right because this is the same"
"5432250","5433490"," future stuff right here right."
"5434550","5440810"," You see a little green bar boom rejected sent right down right boom rejected sent right down so"
"5440810","5444430"," you'll be looking for rejection up in here to take this next leg down. "
"5445730","5453730"," Does that help I don't know hope that helps so we'll see if we get that rejection here."
"5454570","5462690"," You're looking for rejection off of like 443.89 or so somewhere right up in here you're looking for"
"5462690","5464310"," some rejection let's see if there's any up there."
"5467240","5469840"," A little bit up in there some ice right here. "
"5472040","5479840"," 4409 or so see if we can get him to show up here"
"5479840","5489420"," some right there right here that's where it is"
"5489420","5493380"," and then the next one above is 4404."
"5506360","5509940"," I'll bring it back over for you one more time so you can see it right here."
"5511040","5515400"," Looking for a little swing lower boom might be another good short in there for you. "
"5525180","5526140"," You may look at wheat."
"5529380","5532700"," Look at wheat I've traded wheat I like wheat."
"5535900","5539260"," There's some there's some weird stuff flow coming in right. "
"5539380","5548120"," We've got some we've got some puts on China trades we've got puts on S E K web"
"5548120","5551060"," you've got wheat looking bigger."
"5551060","5559460"," You've got people talking about the Russia shit going to go or the Russia US is going to shit."
"5562580","5570580"," DVN Delta Victor November October 21st 70 P 1.9 million dollars. "
"5573750","5576150"," Look at wheat I like wheat I like the wheat trade."
"5577390","5580050"," I saw two articles this weekend about."
"5580890","5583790"," I saw two articles this weekend about. "
"5586510","5589170"," Price of groceries are going to continue to go up."
"5589730","5590970"," They're not done going up."
"5591790","5594710"," 30 to 40% increase in grocery prices. "
"5595710","5596830"," That was kind of wild."
"5602460","5604080"," Calls on VRM."
"5604420","5607020"," I'll go score VRM Victor Romeo Michael. "
"5614560","5616460"," That food prices would go to the roof."
"5617600","5621520"," I did do some shopping this weekend myself over those two articles I wanted to see."
"5621900","5623200"," You guys are going to think I'm crazy. "
"5624240","5626100"," But I hit three grocery stores."
"5629340","5635320"," I went out I had a date in the morning in the early morning hours on Saturday so I got"
"5635320","5640300"," asked to go out at a date and I said well so I really like to do was like to"
"5640300","5640780"," go shopping."
"5642840","5643900"," It's a true story. "
"5645660","5652780"," So I went so I went shopping and I mostly I went shopping to to just to see the price"
"5652780","5653200"," of goods."
"5654680","5658840"," Let's see if there any differences and then I was looking for shrinkage on the shelves and I was"
"5658840","5660040"," looking for shortages on the shelves."
"5661000","5668320"," And then I was also looking for this one guy had said this weekend he said expect a lower selection"
"5668320","5668940"," of products. "
"5669440","5673660"," So I don't know let's say you bought like Cheezits or something."
"5674260","5677140"," I know there's like a ton of different flavors of Cheezits that you'd expect."
"5677140","5681500"," You'd expect we got more buyers and sellers on wheat. "
"5683820","5686280"," I probably started above 1351."
"5688560","5691300"," But you'd expect to only see a couple flavors of Cheezits."
"5691460","5691920"," Not all the flavors. "
"5692160","5693760"," I guess cheetos or I don't know."
"5694000","5698220"," I don't know what the kids like but like soda products."
"5698520","5702620"," I guess you'd see more coke on the shelves and less flavored coke on the shelves. "
"5706560","5712840"," So the so the point being that you would see that and I did see some shortages on the shelves."
"5713430","5718280"," I saw the price of some stuff was high."
"5723260","5728020"," And our grocery bill has gone up our grocery bill is typically so for me. "
"5728020","5733140"," I take care of a woman into younger women."
"5735120","5739120"," They rely upon me to I don't know."
"5739860","5743300"," Make sure they can live a good life. "
"5743720","5747900"," So take a look real quick."
"5748080","5748700"," See this chart."
"5751000","5753680"," And so I'm looking to see if there's some rejection here or not. "
"5754300","5756240"," This is going to be an area of contention."
"5757120","5760880"," Another area to short maybe here and is another minor one above here."
"5761660","5763340"," I'm going to keep my eyes on this one. "
"5771270","5773210"," See if this gets rolled over or not."
"5774330","5775910"," But my grocery bill has gone up."
"5776110","5778750"," So I was like, well, I want to go to some actual physical shopping. "
"5783690","5784990"," And stuff's expensive."
"5785370","5789830"," It's weird too, because you know what I what I wound up doing was instead of."
"5791330","5792830"," Looking for bargains. "
"5794490","5798570"," I just bought what I'd normally buy when I grocery shop."
"5798830","5800010"," So I went to the whole foods."
"5801410","5804610"," I went to Trader Joe's and then I went to our regular. "
"5804610","5806670"," Our local grocery store."
"5810430","5813870"," And the price of goods have gone up."
"5815050","5816450"," And I didn't want to save any money. "
"5816550","5817250"," I wanted to see what it costs."
"5817450","5819170"," I ended up spending for the four of us."
"5819890","5823030"," I think we shop every two weeks or so and then we'll. "
"5823950","5828310"," Like every two weeks we'll get food and then we shop by the day."
"5829450","5830950"," And matter of fact, we have a deep freezer."
"5830950","5836030"," We have a deep freezer and I just and we just finished eating all of our food of our deep"
"5836030","5836290"," freezer. "
"5836670","5837730"," We're trying to clear it out."
"5837910","5838090"," I don't know."
"5838190","5838950"," This is weird stuff. "
"5839110","5839930"," No one wants to know this stuff."
"5841330","5843590"," And I scraped out all the ice in the bottom of it."
"5843710","5847770"," And we ate everything and anything that we didn't like. "
"5848290","5849810"," We're like, okay, we're never buying that again."
"5851070","5851890"," Found some idea."
"5851890","5853470"," I do a lot of backpacking in the summertime. "
"5853490","5854270"," I found a lot of frozen."
"5854590","5855370"," I take a lot of frozen."
"5855630","5860870"," I'll freeze some foods and take a backpacking with me for like my first day when I'm out. "
"5860870","5861570"," And stuff like that."
"5861790","5862950"," And I was like, ooh, that stuff's getting old."
"5863210","5864910"," Been out and then there since last summer. "
"5865810","5875710"," So, you know, anyways, so I end up spending almost $700 on shopping, which is expensive."
"5876170","5880130"," Now our average every two weeks is about $300."
"5881270","5886670"," So typically we'll spend about 300 bucks on food and then we'll supplement over those next two"
"5886670","5886890"," weeks. "
"5888090","5891730"," So it might come out to let's say we don't eat out a lot anymore."
"5891910","5892850"," We just eat out all the time."
"5893790","5897250"," We're not we're not having great experiences dining out right now. "
"5897410","5899730"," Between the service, the shortages."
"5902450","5904510"," And we just I don't know why this."
"5904670","5905230"," We haven't. "
"5905490","5910570"," We've tried to eat out and it hasn't been as good of his experience as it was pre COVID."
"5911250","5914430"," And so we do a lot of cooking ourselves."
"5916470","5919190"," So our grocery bill has gone up substantially. "
"5919670","5921130"," The grocery bill is."
"5922470","5924890"," And I know that that's just one person's experience."
"5926770","5930210"," And I noticed that so I was doing this shopping on a Saturday morning. "
"5930390","5931790"," I think I expected more people to be out shopping."
"5931930","5934230"," I didn't see as many people as I expected to be out."
"5935370","5937890"," And there was there was another odd thing. "
"5938170","5942310"," I didn't see a lot of high end stuff that I wanted."
"5943270","5946270"," So I was looking for some expensive pepperoni as an example."
"5946570","5947870"," And I couldn't find any of it. "
"5947950","5950350"," Matter of fact, all they had available was like Turkey pepperoni."
"5951110","5953870"," And I don't want to care that it's better or not."
"5954110","5955790"," But I want you to know that I couldn't get it. "
"5955910","5958910"," So there's like some things I couldn't get."
"5959250","5962210"," Like there are other items, but whatever."
"5962550","5964270"," Matter of fact, when I went looking for some chicken. "
"5964270","5970390"," I buy like the by the organic shit or whatever."
"5970610","5972750"," And I looked for it in the regular shopping center."
"5973430","5975210"," Not in Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. "
"5975590","5977150"," And there was a very small selection."
"5978210","5979410"," And I think two breasts."
"5981530","5984650"," Boneless skinless breasts cost me 12 bucks or something. "
"5985470","5988470"," That's pretty expensive for regular grocery store."
"5991050","5992850"," So you have the bulls fighting right now."
"5994270","5995790"," And so that that has some questions. "
"5996150","5998530"," That lends to some questions about trading."
"5999310","5999630"," What?"
"5999950","6001430"," Trading commodities food commodities."
"6002490","6005410"," It also lends some questions about trading. "
"6005790","6007150"," Maybe grocery stores."
"6008310","6009850"," How profitable they going to be."
"6010970","6014790"," When they don't have to handle as much product when they don't have to run as many sales when they"
"6014790","6015330"," don't have to. "
"6016470","6018850"," Or they can demand a certain price, right?"
"6021350","6023450"," So anyways, that was my experience."
"6024010","6025690"," Gas came down this past weekend."
"6025990","6030650"," I think I have to have two electric vehicles and I've got one ice vehicle. "
"6031190","6032970"," But I did fill up my ice vehicle this weekend."
"6033170","6033830"," That was a hundred bucks."
"6034190","6037970"," It was 120 like four weeks ago or two weeks ago or whatever. "
"6038370","6039050"," Last time I filled it up."
"6039170","6040110"," It was like 120 bucks."
"6040450","6041530"," So that's come down a little bit. "
"6042650","6049270"," We are breaking through right now, finding that support level down below here at 442 to 442 73"
"6049270","6054510"," bulls are fighting to maintain this market currently."
"6054750","6055970"," We'll see if they can hold it here."
"6056650","6057990"," Or if there's some rejection. "
"6064510","6065790"," What are you guys saying out there?"
"6066070","6067490"," Let me see what you guys are saying in the comments."
"6073700","6075020"," Okay, take care of you too."
"6076660","6077900"," Oh, I saw Jade. "
"6078160","6079500"," I did read that article too."
"6079640","6081080"," That was the third article I read."
"6081820","6086320"," That was the I didn't so that didn't like I didn't want to read that article because it was a"
"6086320","6087860"," it was an op ed piece. "
"6088400","6091500"," So I went down the rabbit hole trying to read the actual factual news."
"6092340","6095180"," And yeah, the the lentil thing was hilarious."
"6096220","6097900"," I did not go to Aldi. "
"6100160","6105240"," Family five now since go for like my house is 500 to 600 every two weeks."
"6105260","6105640"," Yeah."
"6106320","6108420"," So and that's the only key is right. "
"6109100","6110720"," Yeah, everybody's short staff too."
"6111060","6112420"," The only key was I didn't."
"6112600","6115580"," I wasn't so I intentionally didn't want to try to save money. "
"6115940","6119740"," I was like, I'm going to buy what I normally buy and I want to see the difference in price."
"6119740","6126820"," Now we could have easily have kept our bill this week down to we easily could have kept it down"
"6126820","6127080"," to."
"6127480","6128540"," I don't know. "
"6130800","6137460"," Maybe 30% less, but it would have been it would have been making sacrifice, but hey, we're going to"
"6137460","6138380"," get this instead of that."
"6138520","6140720"," We're going to pass on this instead of that."
"6141920","6143640"," We're going to I don't know. "
"6145400","6148240"," Just that kind of a looking to save money."
"6148440","6150440"," Now we are going to probably move into that."
"6150740","6155600"," We had that conversation on Saturday of trying to save money while we shop, but it was it was wild"
"6155600","6156180"," to see. "
"6156860","6163820"," That without shame modifying any behaviors to maintain that quality right is kind of high."
"6164060","6169560"," And what fascinated me was some of the numbers that have been coming out on discretionary spending."
"6169560","6174560"," Believe it or not, people aren't spending money discretionary spending. "
"6175080","6177640"," So people are not going out to eat as much as they used to."
"6177920","6180860"," People are not going out and just blowing money anywhere."
"6181640","6183560"," I'll try to find those numbers today for you. "
"6184040","6188940"," And so no matter what your friends are telling you, like your neighbor that drives that nice car"
"6188940","6190380"," and lives in that nice house."
"6191160","6194820"," That's telling you that everything is great and you know, he's going out every weekend and every"
"6194820","6196360"," night he's at the bar and all this kind of stuff."
"6196360","6202440"," The majority of Americans are not doing that majority of Americans have don't have their savings"
"6202440","6204820"," that they saved and now starting to start to disappear. "
"6205500","6212200"," And so it was interesting to see because, you know, we had that conversation."
"6212300","6215800"," Hey, probably shouldn't be spending this much money on groceries every single week."
"6216980","6219640"," And so it was it was just fascinating. "
"6219640","6222880"," It was fascinating to go do the shopping and see it in person."
"6222880","6227170"," I can't find biscuits."
"6234700","6237500"," Do I ever try butcher box for your meat cap?"
"6237740","6241180"," I raised all my beef chicken pork, but if I didn't, I'd probably at least try them. "
"6241600","6242940"," No, I will write them down."
"6243180","6248500"," So I used to we used to raise."
"6249160","6256780"," So we come from our family owns a large ranch in Montana where they raise livestock. "
"6258720","6263440"," And I have a local butcher that I use and then also."
"6264480","6269540"," We used to raise chickens and rabbits and I ate chicken and rabbit for a long time that we raised."
"6269900","6274120"," It was too much work now for us to for what we're doing. "
"6274120","6277420"," It's just too much for us, but I will look them up butcher box."
"6281620","6284640"," I'm going to have to write a note somewhere over here or a notepad or something."
"6294330","6296050"," Because I want to look that up. "
"6296810","6297910"," But I buy meats from Aldi."
"6298110","6298590"," I'll go to Aldi."
"6298830","6300210"," We shop at Aldi sometimes. "
"6302150","6304950"," I won't say that we don't shop at Aldi, but I don't do the shopping."
"6305450","6308450"," So, you know, it's like a whole second here."
"6308870","6312290"," I don't think I have a notepad on this on this build. "
"6313170","6314050"," We have to download it."
"6320730","6322450"," Sometimes we'll buy meat from Aldi."
"6322850","6325650"," We'll buy steaks of these grass fed steaks there. "
"6327350","6333070"," And we'll throw them inside these."
"6333310","6334870"," Well, they sell these New York strips."
"6335110","6335690"," They're like 10 bucks. "
"6336070","6338070"," You buy two of them, I think, for 15 or 20."
"6338510","6340690"," It's like 15 or 20 bucks to get two fat steaks."
"6341150","6344150"," I'll throw them in the freezer and then when summer time comes or barbecue and have friends over"
"6344150","6344530"," family. "
"6345050","6346130"," I'll throw a bunch of steaks in the grill."
"6347510","6348330"," They're not bad steaks."
"6348550","6348850"," They're good. "
"6364840","6368220"," I'm going to have to dig out some, I'm going to dig out some pictures of."
"6369680","6371640"," I'm going to dig out some pictures of."
"6373960","6376660"," I've got pictures of me. "
"6377460","6380940"," I'll go out to Montana when they're calves."
"6381460","6386340"," Some of their calves are they'll be small or sick when they're born."
"6386340","6391080"," And they can't brand them and cut their balls off. "
"6392460","6393400"," Until they get older."
"6394100","6396700"," So sometimes I think it's in April when we go out."
"6397660","6400740"," But some of these, some of these calves will grow up to be a little bit too big, right?"
"6400920","6402240"," Like 185 pounds or so. "
"6402620","6405840"," A little bit bigger than they should be when you cut their balls and branding them."
"6406160","6408620"," So you got to get a couple guys and you tackle them down on the ground."
"6408880","6411140"," You pull their hind leg back and then you brand their ass as well. "
"6411380","6414480"," You step their balls and pop them out here with your thumb."
"6419080","6427980"," Yeah, the revise are good too."
"6432220","6433980"," Yeah, we talked about the all we did talk about. "
"6434080","6434860"," Yeah, Montana, baby."
"6435660","6442460"," Matter of fact, I just found a house in Ecolaca yesterday for sale for like $80,000."
"6443960","6445680"," I was thinking about buying it. "
"6447600","6448600"," Ecolaca, Montana."
"6451300","6452100"," Ecolaca, Montana."
"6452380","6453880"," I was thinking about buying a house out there. "
"6458220","6461660"," So for like family reans and all that kind of stuff, the place to be."
"6462680","6464160"," There's only one small motel in town."
"6469680","6470680"," Yeah, so we're still waiting. "
"6471980","6474400"," I'm going to try to re-enter again here in just a moment."
"6474600","6475400"," I'm sitting here watching."
"6476280","6477360"," I just broke above here. "
"6477700","6478680"," Spice finding some support."
"6479200","6481080"," This is its upward trend."
"6482020","6482100"," Right?"
"6482240","6484520"," We know about this big white white line right here. "
"6484540","6486120"," This is its upward upward bound trend."
"6486400","6488040"," I'm looking for a rejection to trade lower."
"6489940","6491500"," It's every enter once more. "
"6491840","6493440"," So we'll see if we can get that or not."
"6505120","6508620"," Just the heads up that there's a golden cross on the Dow."
"6509980","6514260"," If there's any guy, if history's any guy, there may be a good fortune ahead for shares of the Dow,"
"6514420","6515760"," so-called golden cross is formed. "
"6515760","6520060"," On its chart, not surprising this could be bullish for its stock."
"6523460","6526120"," 50 in the 200-day, simple moving averages are commonly used."
"6526500","6528400"," Looks like it's the 50th cross, the 200. "
"6532080","6533160"," Keep an eye on the Dow."
"6534400","6543520"," I'll look up the Dow real quick, but I'll show you guys the Dow crossover."
"6543800","6544220"," It's right here. "
"6547140","6550440"," Beautiful golden crossover on the Dow."
"6550660","6556610"," Just keep the Dow in your cross hairs."
"6556890","6559070"," That news broke at 1054. "
"6563180","6564040"," This is hilarious."
"6567660","6568960"," Let's say we read this here."
"6575940","6578360"," I'll bring this up for you guys over here real quick. "
"6578360","6579080"," It's funny."
"6579300","6580560"," I'm reading this one right here, right?"
"6581320","6584440"," The Dow, golden cross for the Dow, should be positive."
"6586120","6590160"," It's just broke a moment ago, but then BX has a death cross. "
"6592080","6594220"," There's a death cross on Lucid as well."
"6595200","6600880"," Death cross on Blackstone and a death cross on Lucid."
"6603480","6604960"," Just the heads up on that one. "
"6606420","6612360"," It seems any other news in here that's worth it."
"6612480","6613820"," Not a big news day."
"6614620","6619020"," There's not a lot of news today, even on the news ticker. "
"6620020","6623960"," Not even just the spoken news, but there's just not a lot of news today."
"6628970","6630510"," Not a lot of news today."
"6640100","6641640"," Spy trading higher again. "
"6643320","6653160"," Trading a 444.93. See if it can maintain or"
"6653160","6669180"," if there's any rejection here at 445 or again we're looking for 445.93. The"
"6669180","6671560"," VIX is falling through support."
"6672560","6680700"," Now trading as low as 23.77. Continue to watch the VIX today."
"6702620","6708480"," Price target targets above include 445.91, 446 "
"6708480","6737570",".33. Keep"
"6737570","6738110"," a lack of baby. "
"6741330","6742650"," Yup, population 360."
"6744910","6745990"," There's nobody there."
"6746530","6750190"," As a matter of fact, the streets are named after my family. "
"6750510","6752230"," Some of the streets are named after my family."
"6756210","6757770"," Cowboy starfish is cranky."
"6758730","6759690"," VIX at 100 DM. "
"6759850","6760970"," Yeah, I'm watching the VIX closely."
"6764970","6767990"," So the one thing I want to show you guys, and we'll see if we can bring this up here."
"6768150","6771090"," There's something happening in the background that you guys need to see. "
"6771750","6773670"," I want you guys to see here."
"6774190","6782280"," Some of you guys are like, some of you guys are sometimes like, why did the market just shit"
"6782280","6782660"," itself?"
"6783000","6784580"," And I don't know why the market's shitting itself."
"6785140","6787180"," That's one of my favorites on Twitter. "
"6788120","6790480"," I'll see post saying, why did the market just shit itself?"
"6790700","6791360"," Well, there's nothing happened."
"6792140","6795000"," So we're going to look at some reasons why the market shits itself."
"6802780","6803140"," Okay. "
"6805940","6809600"," So we're going to look at just the five day real quick."
"6812620","6813700"," We're going to look at the VIX, okay?"
"6814820","6819480"," And so how the market's pretty, I get this churn going on right now."
"6819700","6822220"," And in this churn, we're not going to, we're not trading higher. "
"6823020","6825620"," Yet the VIX keeps rolling over and rolling over, right?"
"6825620","6828700"," See the VIX down here rolling over, rolling over this in the five minute."
"6829640","6832900"," Go to the two minute, see it's lost support, right?"
"6833120","6835960"," Pushed up here and then started to trade lower."
"6836220","6837500"," And like, what does that mean, right?"
"6837620","6839000"," Is the question like, what does that mean cap?"
"6840020","6842520"," And so let's say we churn here, right?"
"6843200","6845280"," And let's say the VIX continues to roll over. "
"6846880","6848840"," And let's say the VIX continues to trade down."
"6848960","6851140"," We talked about, does it go lower than 20?"
"6852260","6855700"," So you might be saying, hey, we're going up cap or going up."
"6856120","6861100"," But if the VIX keeps dropping down here, if we don't get any headline positive news, out of the"
"6861100","6862720"," blue, you'll see a huge spike. "
"6864320","6866340"," And you'll see a huge spike in the VIX."
"6866600","6869500"," And you'll see the markets start to roll over and sell hard."
"6870080","6875340"," So whenever you see like a non-headline reason why the market's doing this, days like today, I"
"6875340","6876620"," always like to trade against the VIX. "
"6876740","6880400"," Like this is a good day to be keeping an eye on the VIX."
"6880980","6882960"," Even though we're going up currently right now."
"6883800","6887740"," Because we're getting close to support for the VIX right now. "
"6888580","6888940"," Okay."
"6889400","6899350"," Now trading down at 23.59. So I'm going to"
"6899350","6903730"," keep an eye on the VIX and see where the bigger play is."
"6923460","6927100"," There are calls being held. "
"6927100","6928100"," I missed this earlier."
"6928400","6932980"," I don't know how long these have been held, but the algos are on 445Cs."
"6933480","6939080"," They're currently trading at $1.41. Most of the moves already have been made, but there's 82,000"
"6939080","6943740"," contracts on March 21st, 445C. "
"6953950","6954710"," It's a nice move."
"6954810","6956590"," I should have traded that move and I didn't."
"6957030","6958430"," That bounce I should have traded. "
"6958870","6959770"," I was looking for a rejection."
"6961630","6964450"," I was looking for a rejection right in here."
"6964610","6966350"," I still should have taken that trade. "
"6967050","6970050"," Even if it was to this area here and I didn't, I missed that trade."
"6971750","6972750"," I took this trade."
"6973450","6976390"," I missed this one too because I was talking to you guys on the open here. "
"6977350","6981630"," I took this trade down and I took this trade right here back down to this zone here."
"6983430","6984890"," But I missed this one completely."
"6984890","6987190"," I missed probably two of the best trades today. "
"6987310","6989990"," I missed this one and I missed this one right here."
"7012840","7015440"," Not seeing a lot of action on the options."
"7018560","7023420"," Seeing some decent call structure on March 25th. "
"7023640","7025100"," Weekly calls on Apple."
"7028840","7030820"," That's still not, you know, still not huge."
"7030820","7032680"," I'm going to take a quick break here. "
"7035600","7045280"," It's now 11 a.m. Remember that we've got the Euro close at 11.30. Or, wait a minute, sorry,"
"7045400","7046580"," I'm misspeaking here."
"7046660","7047540"," I'm trying to look at this right here."
"7048120","7064320"," What I want you to do is, if you're"
"7064320","7069840"," bullish here, look for, you know, some kind of a continuation up higher here. "
"7070580","7077820"," And if you're starting to get bearish here, this is about where a rejection should be somewhere"
"7077820","7078580"," higher here."
"7079080","7082620"," Look for a move higher and then to take this next short down."
"7084100","7086740"," I'm currently flat and I'm going to take a quick break. "
"7086840","7089480"," I need to get some coffee and a glass of water."
"7090140","7090980"," I'm starting to lose my voice."
"7091180","7093480"," I'm going to start getting a scratchy voice here and start coughing. "
"7094120","7095680"," So I'll be back here in just a minute."
"7096920","7098320"," And I'll be right back."
"7098480","7104180"," Give me 15 minutes and I'll be right back for the 11.30 hour. "
"7106960","7109420"," I'm telling you what, I'm not hearing shit on the squawk today."
"7110560","7113620"," I ain't hearing shit on the squawk."
"7113740","7116560"," And sometimes, sometimes I trade the news is like that too. "
"7116980","7119740"," Sometimes trade the news will be a slow, slow news day."
"7120440","7121640"," Maybe I'm missing something here."
"7122500","7123680"," Give them that logged into the right. "
"7123680","7127100"," Maybe there's another squawk that I'm missing."
"7128480","7132120"," Let me see if, see if there's anything I'm missing here."
"7174060","7176460"," Someone's saying that they're waiting for the Powell talk. "
"7198190","7199250"," Get the slow day."
"7203110","7204790"," Rejection on spy currently."
"7213440","7214280"," Trade it higher. "
"7215380","7216320"," A little bit of rejection here."
"7216420","7219820"," We'll see if it sticks or if we get this rejection here, we start to fade lower."
"7239220","7239700"," Okay. "
"7239840","7244100"," So you noticed on Friday and today that when the hero was his negative in the market moved higher,"
"7244100","7247160"," does this suggest support that real money?"
"7247460","7247720"," No."
"7247820","7252220"," So on, we talked about the hero being negative, even though the markets were going up."
"7253980","7258500"," And the question, I think the question, I think my question"
"7258500","7266640"," to Spock. "
"7266640","7270960"," Selling our accounts for accounts for."
"7274040","7276480"," The here in the care and I was actually told no."
"7276960","7281320"," But what I wanted to show you or what I'm going to show you is that no matter what this"
"7281320","7282420"," intraday action is. "
"7286060","7288980"," No matter what the intraday action is, right?"
"7291260","7291860"," It's a good question."
"7292160","7295040"," No matter what the intraday action that you're looking at is right."
"7295840","7297080"," Puts were being bought. "
"7297560","7298440"," Key is that."
"7300160","7301540"," Puts were being bought."
"7305020","7311860"," More puts than calls to exact were bought as we on Friday, regardless of where we are. "
"7312480","7313620"," That's what was that was."
"7313780","7315020"," That's what was done that last day."
"7315160","7318380"," So put positions were placed on Friday. "
"7318420","7325660"," It doesn't matter what your intraday need to scale out in a chart here and see that puts for"
"7325660","7326160"," reposition."
"7326160","7326880"," On Friday."
"7327180","7328880"," You can see it in the dot plot here. "
"7329320","7331980"," It doesn't mean that we're not going to trade higher here."
"7332300","7335500"," What it does mean is that you need to see calls."
"7336220","7337960"," An expansion of call buying. "
"7339240","7340880"," At farther out prices."
"7341740","7346800"," Somewhere up in here for four sixty four seventy for us to actually trade higher."
"7347600","7349280"," So for us to trade higher, you need to see. "
"7350040","7352880"," You need to see an expansion of calls over here."
"7353360","7356020"," We're not seeing that we're seeing just in the money kind of stuff."
"7356020","7357800"," In here that's short dated. "
"7358160","7359660"," We are seeing some of that this morning."
"7359760","7360300"," I will lend it."
"7360580","7361280"," I'll give it to the bulls. "
"7361860","7367520"," They're buying weeklies and not up until this will last week."
"7367740","7369240"," We didn't even see weeklies get bought."
"7369400","7374240"," We only saw one two dates zero or zero dates one dates and three dates get bought. "
"7374580","7376680"," So bulls are testing the water here."
"7377980","7382620"," Bulls are testing the water here in terms of buying slightly."
"7383240","7384700"," Slightly farther out calls. "
"7385700","7387960"," But on a larger time frame."
"7389200","7391640"," You would be you should be buying puts on."
"7391760","7395680"," You should have been buying puts on Friday and then adding to your position today. "
"7397500","7402300"," If you're a bull out there saying that this market shouldn't roll over retest the low."
"7403500","7404700"," That's just not the case."
"7405160","7408120"," No matter what the price action is currently at this moment. "
"7408820","7412280"," We can trade up from here and we can get expansion into the."
"7412280","7413300"," Thirty first."
"7413480","7415240"," We're going to talk about the thirty first to the end of the month. "
"7416000","7419960"," And what it means for the market to close the quarter negative."
"7421040","7423280"," It's implications that is the bull case."
"7425080","7426180"," The bull case would be. "
"7427000","7430040"," You don't want to close this month out on the negative."
"7431480","7433120"," Because if it does close on the negative."
"7433660","7435100"," The implications down the road. "
"7435260","7437840"," You guys have heard me in the past talk at ad nauseam right."
"7437840","7440320"," About when we close a bad week about bad day."
"7440460","7443620"," Then a bad week and then a bad month and then two bad months and then a bad quarter. "
"7444420","7449160"," How hard and how much longer it takes for us to recover from those bad quarters."
"7449280","7449880"," Then when you add up."
"7450400","7451500"," Two bad quarters. "
"7451940","7452800"," Three bad quarters."
"7453320","7455880"," The implications one two three years down the road."
"7456400","7457960"," This is intradate price action. "
"7458740","7463980"," I would be cautious or wary of the direction of the market for where we are right now."
"7464560","7466280"," But where we're headed to next."
"7467280","7469320"," Where the markets moving to overtime. "
"7469960","7470980"," We can easily trade."
"7471960","7473080"," To four fifty."
"7473400","7474300"," But where is the trade. "
"7474960","7476300"," So let's look at a."
"7476840","7478660"," We talk about this all the time right."
"7479400","7479760"," So."
"7481020","7483480"," The trade along was down here. "
"7483720","7484700"," This is where the trade was."
"7485260","7486680"," So where the long trade is."
"7487300","7488200"," Right here. "
"7489560","7490160"," No."
"7491000","7493220"," So the long trade was down here."
"7493780","7495460"," And the question becomes. "
"7495460","7498020"," Is the trade higher here right."
"7498380","7501760"," What is how much higher is it for as a for another fifty points."
"7502340","7506040"," As a for another sixty points or do we start to consolidate. "
"7507100","7509680"," For the next leg up which makes more sense if you're bullish."
"7510360","7513800"," The better sense that we trade sideways and we go higher if you're a bull."
"7514180","7515600"," If you're a bear. "
"7516440","7518800"," This is when you'd actually start to."
"7519740","7521600"," Look for short."
"7521600","7522740"," To at least. "
"7523160","7525740"," Before we make the next leg higher even if you are bullish."
"7526460","7526800"," Okay."
"7527060","7528220"," So there's just logic. "
"7529220","7531840"," So when you hear traders say things like today like."
"7532080","7534180"," I'm super bearish right or bullish right here."
"7534760","7535300"," That's like. "
"7535620","7538900"," That's like a bear down here telling me that he's bearish down here."
"7539380","7541620"," You have a bear is like oh yeah man we're breaking this today."
"7541860","7542620"," I'd be laughing at a bear. "
"7543040","7543660"," Up here."
"7543980","7546140"," Bull tell me we're going to go to all-time new highs."
"7546680","7547620"," Right where we are. "
"7547820","7549500"," I'm going to laugh at a bull generally speaking."
"7550480","7551260"," Mostly because."
"7552280","7555100"," I've survived in this market long enough to know that when you're. "
"7555260","7557860"," When you make a gut is one two three four."
"7558340","7560120"," You might get this fifth day."
"7560360","7561580"," This fifth day up. "
"7562020","7564820"," But at some but at some point one two three five."
"7565760","7567660"," You're more than likely getting a rollover."
"7567900","7571860"," Now this didn't apply the last two years twenty twenty twenty twenty twenty one. "
"7572600","7575260"," You know we could go for ten twelve straight days of green."
"7575780","7578060"," But right now unless we have some headline news."
"7579120","7583440"," To get us up on like ten straight green days or twelve straight green days. "
"7583740","7586240"," It's just not as common right now."
"7586620","7589780"," It's not as common when you're when you're looking at."
"7590200","7592920"," When you're looking at you know this right when you're looking at. "
"7593480","7594520"," This right here."
"7595400","7595500"," Right."
"7596640","7601060"," You should be happy to get five days and you're going to look for some consolidation. "
"7601880","7604760"," And you're going to look for a reason to go higher from here."
"7606000","7607680"," Now you need you need a reason to go higher."
"7608200","7610060"," So for today. "
"7611320","7613800"," Now this all to me looks like consolidation right."
"7614040","7615640"," A little bit of distribution as well."
"7615780","7617800"," So as this plays out. "
"7618100","7620460"," There's a few things we're looking for we're looking for."
"7621400","7625380"," We're looking for distribution and we're going to be looking for."
"7626060","7629120"," If bulls can actually find some news to send it higher. "
"7629580","7631340"," And if it can't what happens if we trade."
"7631720","7632940"," We talk about this all time right."
"7632940","7634820"," If we start to trade sideways. "
"7635540","7636900"," If we start to trade sideways."
"7638420","7641380"," What happens we all know this right nine times out of ten."
"7641620","7642860"," Seven times out of ten. "
"7643320","7646060"," We know that if we trade if we trade sideways in here."
"7647060","7652060"," That we eventually trade down until we find the support that we need to add higher."
"7653200","7655940"," Over time right one two three days or whatever. "
"7656660","7657800"," So all this intraday stuff."
"7658760","7659000"," I'm here."
"7659800","7660720"," Am I doing wrong here. "
"7661280","7665000"," All this intraday action right now is more just some distribution."
"7665880","7667240"," Doing some wrong here."
"7668520","7669460"," What I'm doing here. "
"7670140","7671380"," So all this move here."
"7671480","7672600"," All this here is consolidation."
"7673920","7678320"," This whole area here is consolidation and finding out our next directional move. "
"7678940","7680240"," Can we move higher into the close today?"
"7680340","7680520"," Sure."
"7681140","7684140"," But is the bigger trade this move from here to here?"
"7684440","7684960"," Probably not."
"7685440","7688960"," So position yourself for some kind of a rollover at some point. "
"7689620","7691700"," Or position yourself for some kind of sideways."
"7692240","7695560"," Trading to down until we find that next explosive move up."
"7695880","7696880"," If you're day trading it. "
"7697600","7701160"," This hasn't been too difficult to to day trade right."
"7701280","7702600"," We got this nice move down here."
"7704360","7705820"," This nice play right here. "
"7706580","7706680"," Right."
"7706820","7709040"," We got this nice beautiful play that took place up here."
"7710680","7711160"," Right. "
"7711840","7713240"," We have one two."
"7713600","7715900"," If you wanted to trade that take the move higher."
"7715900","7720060"," You probably do one two and then three and then another move up higher here. "
"7720200","7721540"," So maybe look for another bounce here."
"7721780","7722720"," Take this move higher."
"7723180","7724180"," I'm going to take a quick break though. "
"7724720","7726200"," So I can come right back to you guys."
"7726840","7726860"," Same."
"7727140","7728640"," Get another trade on here for just a minute. "
"7731160","7732120"," Let me see if I."
"7734580","7737360"," Get some weird shit going on to turn that off that off."
"7737640","7738140"," Here we go."

"7742580","7743820"," QQQ's calls coming in as well."
"7746180","7747520"," I mean just one quick second."
"7747680","7749580"," I'll be right back and I'll take another trade with you guys. "
"7758060","7761120"," If you're looking to catch a bounce trade and you're a bull."
"7761360","7763760"," Look for a bounce down below it for 44 flat."
"7765380","7767480"," Some nice support down here right now. "
"7767480","7768980"," There's not a lot of sellers above."
"7825020","7828320"," Who I just made a quick play that green bar."

"8646450","8649830"," This is that support down here that you can see on book map. "
"8650370","8652350"," It might be this is nice consolidation here."
"8653190","8657330"," This looks like a bear flag in some case some sense, but you might get a move quick move down"
"8657330","8658290"," and move higher here."
"8659810","8661730"," Until sellers actually show up. "

"9801500","9801980"," See what you think."
"9829390","9833300"," The only other note on this. "
"9834820","9836900"," From this possibility, right?"
"9837280","9838180"," If something like this."
"9840660","9842240"," Ooh, I don't know what happened there."
"9844620","9846400"," But if you've got something like that. "
"9847940","9848880"," Something like that."
"9849620","9854300"," But the only other concern that I would have would be that the VIX is starting to base."
"9855440","9861620"," So sometimes you'll get just a fake breakout and then move down. "
"9861620","9863420"," Let's keep an eye on the VIX too."

"10321030","10321650"," I appreciate it brother. "
"10323250","10324550"," What was who you guys asking?"
"10331250","10332950"," Trying to see what you guys are asking in chat here."
"10333270","10334670"," Just scroll back higher and see what you guys doing."
"10334750","10335470"," So far I just chopped. "
"10336070","10336610"," Guys is all chopped."
"10337290","10338630"," Look at those 10,000 orders."
"10339790","10340610"," Just captain out today. "
"10340890","10341510"," Cap seat in the sandwich."
"10341750","10341790"," Yep."
"10341990","10342510"," I was eating a Sammy. "
"10346630","10348010"," Took some shorts for May."
"10348390","10348510"," Yep."
"10350810","10353730"," Pretty soon need to be praying for it to go down as my trading strategy. "
"10357050","10357990"," Here my guy is closing."
"10358370","10360250"," Then you can see the soft into a lunch hour."
"10360450","10360550"," Yep. "
"10361790","10362950"," With daily cup and handle."
"10363450","10364810"," Yeah, I see the cup and handle too."
"10366970","10368650"," It's kind of a fucked up looking captain. "
"10369030","10369830"," It's not really a guy."
"10370010","10370510"," I don't know."
"10370510","10371330"," It's kind of a cup and handle. "
"10372030","10372450"," Kind of."
"10377180","10378100"," Yeah, we're getting wiki."
"10379000","10381600"," The one good thing about right now is that we're not getting. "
"10382540","10384020"," We're not getting the flushes."
"10384660","10386240"," We're not getting those violent flushes."
"10386380","10389800"," We saw some nasty violent flushes past week or two. "
"10389960","10390020"," Right."
"10392720","10393880"," Does anybody have a link?"
"10394160","10401860"," Chase is saying that Powell is speaking at 12 o'clock."
"10402360","10403340"," If there is one. "
"10406880","10410840"," Apples ripping and misfit is lagging L two pieces of spa."
"10411040","10411180"," Yeah."
"10411680","10412360"," It's just chopped. "
"10412620","10413540"," That's all there is right now."
"10413540","10413920"," So."
"10416480","10417460"," Head of six. "
"10417460","10419420"," Captain, you think below is in for the day."
"10420840","10422400"," You know, you guys."
"10423620","10426360"," So I don't see how breaks down through all those bars below. "
"10426680","10427800"," So I was going down in there."
"10433680","10437420"," I was just talking to my wife about how warm it is."
"10440640","10443160"," You're no longer expecting 440 today. "
"10443640","10443740"," Yeah."
"10444400","10444600"," So it's."
"10445480","10447320"," We already kind of discussed this, right?"
"10448020","10448600"," All this. "
"10450680","10451280"," Intraday."
"10451420","10452820"," Chop here really means nothing."
"10453700","10455740"," It means nothing at this point. "
"10455740","10459040"," It absolutely has no bearing upon."
"10459580","10461400"," Do you see 440 today or not?"
"10461560","10463620"," I haven't seen anything in the one thing."
"10463740","10466000"," The only thing I've seen in the market currently is. "
"10466600","10469200"," That could give an edge to maybe bulls would be."
"10469940","10473180"," But there's significant calls taken out on."
"10473720","10475420"," There's expansion of calls in tech. "
"10475580","10476200"," I can see that."
"10476580","10478540"," And that does make sense to an extent."
"10479600","10484500"," That you would see a big tech catch a bit that is. "
"10487420","10488920"," Uh, farther out."
"10489040","10489780"," I am seeing calls."
"10493400","10496140"," I am seeing calls farther out on. "
"10497440","10500220"," Tech weeklies seeing some monthlies."
"10501540","10503380"," On tech, but even so, right?"
"10503600","10505480"," Does it do we still roll over here?"
"10505920","10508460"," We could we could trade all the way to 450 and roll over here."
"10509260","10510240"," But what's 450?"
"10510520","10511060"," 30 points. "
"10512000","10515100"," Um, so you can't really call it for the bulls here."
"10516280","10520540"," And even if you do trade a 450, it should still be some sort of a roll over."
"10521580","10526600"," Just open up your brow or open up your charts to a little bit more than where we are currently"
"10526600","10527080"," trading. "
"10528840","10533160"," Uh, but for day trades, we can trade, you know, it doesn't matter which way it goes, right?"
"10533300","10534480"," If we're day trade, we can trade it down."
"10534580","10535080"," We can trade it up."
"10535080","10535720"," It doesn't really matter. "
"10535720","10538080"," So it's like different viewpoints as a day trader."
"10538440","10539940"," I don't care where the market goes."
"10540140","10540940"," I don't care if it goes up. "
"10541060","10541920"," I don't care if it goes down."
"10542240","10550780"," If you're looking at where the market is on a medium term scale, like just like."
"10553700","10555920"," The state of the market for a weekly. "
"10557120","10558500"," It's probably on the downside."
"10560080","10565060"," Uh, I would bet that if you, if you took the downside of where we are currently."
"10565740","10569000"," You'd win more often than not for just for where we are. "
"10569260","10570400"," Just just basic."
"10570600","10571860"," This is basic trade and stuff."
"10573320","10577860"," Uh, so if you took a put that was a month out or three months out or some right around"
"10577860","10579100"," here, you should be safe. "
"10579240","10582480"," It should print at some point whether today, tomorrow or the next day, it should print."
"10583960","10584360"," Right."
"10584780","10587700"," On a macro scale or a macro viewpoint. "
"10591380","10593300"," Um, you're looking for big headlines, right?"
"10593300","10596740"," If you're a bull, you're looking for better news from the Fed."
"10597780","10602940"," And you're looking for an end to war and maybe threat of war from China."
"10603300","10605140"," I don't know what else you could be looking for. "
"10607420","10609140"," Uh, currently at this moment."
"10609580","10613520"," Now another side of the bullish thing though for that macro look."
"10613780","10618680"," Yeah, if you wanted to buy the dip five days ago and then you might get another one down there"
"10618680","10620040"," between now and June. "
"10620040","10625960"," It's still a good buy down there for June, right?"
"10626180","10628360"," We're looking towards Q two."
"10630800","10634440"," Earning season, maybe not hold into earnings, but just that trade."
"10634820","10636140"," But the trade started a few days ago. "
"10637720","10639520"," So we're looking for your next bull trade."
"10641200","10643480"," Like, you know, like, Hey, one, two, three months out or something like that."
"10643580","10644900"," It's not, uh, it's not here. "
"10646740","10648880"," But you don't, you don't just up and decide."
"10651960","10652580"," I don't know."
"10652700","10655400"," I guess, I guess you can, but you just don't say like. "
"10656380","10659020"," Yeah, I'm buying calls right here because it had you done that here."
"10659540","10660400"," You would have lost it."
"10660480","10660880"," You've done it here. "
"10660940","10661360"," You would have lost."
"10661540","10661960"," You've done it here."
"10662040","10662380"," You would have lost. "
"10662560","10665640"," Same thing even goes back when we're, um."
"10667300","10667900"," Even we're bullish."
"10668160","10669560"," Like, this is all bullish right here, right?"
"10669780","10670820"," We can go back to where we're bullish. "
"10672060","10673660"," And you make a nice leg higher."
"10674300","10677620"," We wait for a pullback, like higher pullback, even in a bullish context."
"10678260","10680980"," You make a leg higher, even if we trade sideways, we come back. "
"10681600","10681920"," Right."
"10682000","10684040"," So like higher, this is all bullish context back here."
"10684580","10687020"," You know, this is, um, back in August. "
"10688600","10691320"," You know, you make a leg higher, come back down, come back down."
"10691400","10692660"," This is, this is when we're a full bull."
"10694020","10696160"," So, you know, you make a move like today. "
"10697020","10697940"," Are you bullish cap?"
"10698200","10698900"," No, I'm not bullish."
"10699360","10699940"," I'm fucking bearish here."
"10700260","10700520"," I'm crazy. "
"10700800","10701060"," I'm a bull."
"10701960","10702960"," I'm like a bull on."
"10702960","10705800"," If anybody doesn't know that about me, I am a bull. "
"10706100","10706660"," That's what I am."
"10707080","10708660"," If you ask me what I am, a fucking bull."
"10711480","10714760"," Um, but you know, bulls that only think we just straight go up. "
"10716000","10718360"," That, you know, they're, they're, they're."
"10718640","10719880"," I disappear from the market eventually."
"10720820","10722880"," Uh, same thing happens to bears. "
"10723340","10725920"," So what are we right now?"
"10727620","10729280"," Uh, we could get this nice trade here."
"10729460","10731060"," You know, this nice trade still on the table."
"10731060","10732480"," It's a nice little capitulation move. "
"10732840","10734500"," Usually cuts right across here."
"10735000","10736600"," Usually you see this mark right here."
"10737000","10737400"," It's 443. "
"10737960","10738720"," You usually see a dip."
"10738920","10739120"," Not always."
"10739320","10740520"," We just see a dip just slightly lower. "
"10741260","10743460"," And then you get that nice, that makes, that makes, that makes next move up."
"10744120","10744640"," I'm not anti."
"10744920","10747120"," You got us going to 450 or 470 or 480. "
"10747640","10753060"," I'm just saying that, um, to ask me, like, is 440 still on the table today?"
"10753220","10753360"," Sure."
"10753640","10754800"," I think it's easily on the table today."
"10755360","10756720"," I think it's easily on the table for tomorrow. "
"10757780","10760800"," If we, let's say today we traded to 450 today."
"10761560","10763060"," Uh, turn around Tuesday, right?"
"10763380","10764500"," You end up getting that sell off."
"10764920","10767200"," And let's, let me, let's go one step further. "
"10768580","10769660"," Let's go one step further."
"10769820","10769960"," Okay."
"10771080","10772560"," Sometimes we'll make a move higher here. "
"10773580","10780940"," But let's look at, um, let's look at, uh, the moves, right?"
"10781860","10782740"," You got a rejection here."
"10783320","10784620"," You got another small rejection here."
"10786340","10787880"," It's already 12 o'clock in the afternoon. "
"10787880","10790180"," You could consider this consolidation for the leg higher."
"10790420","10791000"," I agree with that."
"10792620","10795200"," But it has been straight up the entire day. "
"10796740","10800460"," Uh, so, you know, we, we can sometimes go up, but."
"10802060","10806060"," You don't want to keep seeing, you know, this is a higher high, lower high, right?"
"10806880","10808140"," Uh, first low of the day."
"10809360","10810460"," Where's the low from Friday?"
"10810620","10812360"," I haven't even looked yet to see what the low is from Friday. "
"10812860","10822360"," Yeah, down here at 4.35. Um, so, uh, I don't have to say to you guys."
"10823300","10824680"," It's a slow trading day, right?"
"10825040","10827120"," I'm sure you guys think it's a slow trading day too."
"10827280","10827460"," Look at me. "
"10827540","10828460"," Look at this from here, right?"
"10828620","10829120"," This is back."
"10829360","10830220"," This was 10."
"10830400","10830600"," 55. "
"10831660","10835220"," In the past two hours, we haven't really done shit in here."
"10836200","10836500"," Right?"
"10837500","10840100"," It was a small cross right here, uh, forming."
"10841760","10844920"," This can sometimes be a really nice trade higher right here, actually. "
"10845560","10847620"," Right at the moment, we make it a nice little blast off."
"10849140","10854540"," So, uh, just to enter day stuff, it's a slow, slow moving day today."
"10899310","10901090"," And I haven't taken a trade in the past hour. "
"10901210","10906430"," I had some lunch making myself, uh, like a prosciutto and, uh, super set a sandwich."
"10908670","10916030"," Mullen ticker, M-U-L-N speculative flow coming into the $10 strike $10 calls."
"10916810","10921350"," Expiring April 14th, approximately $30,000 worth. "
"10921870","10928810"," That's ticker M-U-L-N $10 calls coming in on the ask, expiring April 14th."
"10931300","10933020"," Speculative calls on Mullen."
"10933440","10935460"," Shit's been going up like mad dog. "
"10935500","10937120"," It was trading down at 70 cents."
"10937740","10939000"," It's not 40%."
"10939000","10940640"," It looks like a better short than it does along. "
"10941140","10941900"," I could be wrong on that."
"10942980","10948180"," It could be that more of that inflation trade, maybe a air trade with, I think there was another"
"10948180","10951020"," earlier this morning, there was some, uh, a car parts."
"10951640","10957940"," Might be a, just a continuation on, as, into that, uh, sector, auto parts sector. "
"10961220","10963580"," Looks like they're looking for bag holders, to be honest."
"10991760","10993080"," Yeah, nobody's got a power link."
"10994220","10995460"," Chase, do you have a power link?"
"11027430","11028650"," Yeah, I'm not even seeing it out. "
"11028670","11030090"," I'm not even seeing a link on YouTube."
"11030990","11032270"," Hey, Josh, how was your weekend?"
"11033090","11033770"," The weekend was great, man."
"11036690","11037410"," Power 320. "
"11047940","11052940"," Let me see."
"11053080","11054040"," I'm looking for it right now."
"11054880","11057780"," Yeah, I'm not seeing any, uh, links. "
"11057980","11059080"," I just did power live."
"11060080","11061020"," Didn't find shit."
"11069040","11070240"," How was your weekend, Joshua?"
"11073800","11075680"," Mullen equals GME 2.0, maybe. "
"11076580","11078300"," I didn't know I wouldn't wonder what the reason is."
"11079080","11080760"," I haven't looked at, I don't know any of the headlines on it."
"11087210","11088770"," It's, uh, Ben Zinga Pro. "
"11095700","11096480"," It's on CNBC."
"11131770","11132750"," Fucking hate CNBC."
"11141700","11142840"," We posted it. "
"11143220","11143500"," Let me see."
"11153150","11156090"," Spock Emma suggested sideways this week, at least on Twitter."
"11166950","11168450"," You had a chance to go to the fam. "
"11168750","11169390"," Hell yeah, brother."
"11171510","11172750"," Some pushback 1230."
"11185260","11186200"," Yeah, I can't do it. "
"11186340","11186740"," You know what?"
"11186860","11187080"," It's funny."
"11188920","11194080"," I, uh, I famously, I fit kind of symbol, and I'm famous in my own little head."
"11194820","11202440"," I famously made a, um, made a lot of money on a CNBC trade once. "
"11205520","11208280"," It's the only time they've cost me more money overall."
"11209720","11211020"," They've ever made me money."
"11212520","11216840"," Uh, but they, they leaked some news on live one day. "
"11216840","11218200"," They're interviewing somebody."
"11218420","11218840"," I forget who."
"11220880","11221440"," AKAN. "
"11221840","11223460"," She was halted on a circuit breaker."
"11225700","11229040"," A conda corp shares halted to the downside."
"11230240","11232900"," For Alpha Keila, Alpha November, AKAN. "
"11236600","11239400"," Here indicator is turning down a little bit currently."
"11245520","11252040"," And they leaked some news once on CNBC that wasn't publicly known about a deal with, uh, TikTok and"
"11252040","11252860"," Misfit Microsoft."
"11252860","11257280"," They made, uh, a lot of money in like 15 minutes. "
"11257700","11259120"," You wouldn't believe me if I told you, but."
"11261500","11266420"," So I happen to be whole, or I happen to have, uh, options open, screen are open."
"11266620","11267380"," I typed in Misfit. "
"11267960","11275040"," I bought a like 10 grand and, um, zero dates that were worthless and they, they made me stupid"
"11275040","11275520"," money."
"11307550","11309750"," I'm getting a little bit of creep on the VIX right now too."
"11326670","11336350"," Hey, Carl, thanks for making that, uh, point that was at 12.30, not, uh, one, not 11.30. I'm"
"11336350","11338530"," all in the delay short, I jumped out passing the entire float. "
"11342990","11344790"," I don't see it at my end for some reason."
"11344790","11346130"," I don't know why I'm not seeing the link."
"11346130","11347150"," I'm gonna have to log in. "
"11349550","11353290"," I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it on the, uh, link it on YouTube real quick and grab the link for"
"11353290","11353930"," you guys in the chat."
"11388010","11391790"," Yeah, I'm not seeing any links to my chat, my chat box, I'm not seeing any links from you guys."
"11392450","11396750"," Maybe you have to type them in like, uh, you don't do like the dot com or something or do"
"11396750","11398450"," some spacing between the numbers and letters. "
"11401810","11403730"," This is an interesting confluence right here."
"11404550","11406310"," Uh, I like seeing this right here."
"11406730","11409290"," This is an interesting move that comes up right here. "
"11412350","11412830"," 443."
"11412830","11413130"," 443."
"11416910","11419430"," 444, 443, 62. "
"11424540","11429980"," It's a 443.50. And 440."
"11437210","11439390"," I'm still watching it on my end here."
"11441930","11447870"," I wanted to see this get broached down below and haven't seen it yet. "
"11450690","11452650"," Or even it could even be down here."
"11455090","11456730"," Something further like this."
"11458030","11463550"," This point down here, um, or this point for signaling another low. "
"11466330","11468230"," Just one more low might miss it."
"11468910","11469610"," We'll see."
"11489040","11489700"," Hold on. "
"11489800","11490440"," You know what I'm doing too."
"11490740","11494440"," You know, I'll say anything fucking pay attention to is I'm looking at top chat, not a live chat."
"11501180","11502580"," The milk back alone. "
"11520100","11522580"," Ticker O X Y."
"11523180","11529280"," The $65 calls are coming in on the ask, expiring September 16th."
"11529660","11532120"," Approximately $1.5 million worth."
"11532540","11534860"," That's ticker O X Y."
"11535260","11537820"," $65 calls coming in on the ask. "
"11538380","11540440"," Expiring September 16th."
"11540940","11543120"," Approximately $1.5 million worth."
"11557450","11558450"," All right, I got it. "
"11567050","11571230"," Thanks for the, uh, not a link."
"11571430","11572110"," Thanks for the search."
"11572430","11572970"," I found it. "
"11613090","11614970"," Lots of bets being placed in here."
"11625920","11626900"," You don't worry."
"11627000","11627600"," I found it. "
"11632480","11635100"," Nice squeeze higher on the spy currently."
"11654280","11680100"," Yeah, they're"
"11680100","11681640"," good for fading most of the time."
"11681920","11684600"," Yeah, like, uh, CNBC fucking disaster. "
"11686420","11689200"," You had sucked to as a CNBC could be good."
"11692260","11694360"," And they know more than they tell you."
"11697820","11700340"," It's always like an after report and. "
"11703440","11708140"," You don't get the, you want to get the expectation."
"11708560","11710820"," I don't even care if they were wrong, to be honest with you."
"11711920","11714620"," It would be nice to have like a what to expect for today. "
"11715820","11720940"," But even their what to expect today is typically just what's left over from."
"11722740","11728220"," Like the what to expect today is, I don't know what to explain it."
"11730220","11731000"," It's not enough. "
"11731180","11732760"," It's not enough for like due diligence."
"11744050","11745250"," That's pretty much what you say."
"11745450","11746150"," You said you fade it. "
"11757450","11762890"," And it's funny too, because it's funny too, because the that trade that I made all that money off"
"11762890","11765930"," of the interesting part about that trade was that."
"11768970","11772530"," When they broke the story, they weren't supposed to break the story."
"11773990","11783670"," But you could see on the you could see that the the hosts knew the information already. "
"11785530","11786790"," And they it was like this."
"11786910","11789690"," It was over the course of like three to five minutes where they were like, we're not even that"
"11789690","11789850"," long."
"11789850","11793590"," Maybe like a minute, minute and a half where they were like, are you sure that's like, you're not"
"11793590","11795750"," supposed to be telling everybody that this is happening. "
"11795750","11802370"," So you could tell that everybody knew that Microsoft was in negotiations with TikTok."
"11803230","11808610"," And you knew that that they weren't supposed to break that news until a specific time."
"11809250","11815170"," Now the reporter didn't know the reporter thought that they had already broken that news or wanted"
"11815170","11816130"," to break the news, right?"
"11818310","11823990"," So the interesting part was that they already knew you could tell from the reactions of the hosts"
"11823990","11825010"," that they already knew. "
"11831200","11835480"," So, you know, everybody knows, but you raise the retail trader."
"11836920","11839240"," It wasn't out on Bloomberg or anywhere else either."
"11839500","11845160"," So the inside information, when they say that they don't have that information, they typically do. "
"11849200","11859040"," That's kind of like when Putin says, I make $150,000 a year, yet I own a $650"
"11859040","11861240"," million yacht, right?"
"11864480","11866580"," You just kind of wink and move on."
"11866740","11867320"," World's best traders."
"11873370","11875090"," Watching more flow into Oxy. "
"11876270","11878890"," Oxy calls, March 25th, 65C."
"11880170","11887830"," Two times their block, one sweep, one block, $73,000, and then $800,000 in the block trade."
"11888950","11895230"," So that's a prop desk saying, put a call ahead, John, then throw some calls at it too. "
"11896710","11899830"," Some spy calls, USO calls, CLF calls."
"11908670","11912550"," See if the bulls can push through or if we get a double top reversal coming our way."
"11926620","11934340"," Looks like we have some sellers here at 44647 and then again at 44775, clear skies above"
"11934340","11941070"," to 450. "
"11945110","11946610"," Right there they show up."
"11963100","11964840"," Yeah, I haven't looked at TLT today."
"11965020","11966220"," I haven't looked at J&K either. "
"11966780","11969360"," I should be making my way around the market right now."
"11970660","11973940"," And, you know, for some reason I'm not feeling this today."
"11974820","11977160"," J&K has got a little bit of a rollover here. "
"11977240","11978260"," Be conscious of that."
"11981000","11984720"," You don't like to see that rollover on J&K."
"11987600","11988740"," Take a look at TLT. "
"11990020","11993340"," Yeah, you know, TLT is kind of basing."
"11998430","11999610"," Take a look at TNX."
"12002590","12003750"," TNX is still going up. "
"12039910","12041990"," It's not really showing us anything right now."
"12049690","12051410"," This is just sideways action."
"12051690","12052670"," There's nothing to be said about it. "
"12052850","12053450"," It's low volume."
"12056960","12060780"," If I had to guess, if I had to take a guess."
"12063320","12065360"," We're selling bull's calls right now. "
"12066520","12068080"," That's what's happening right now."
"12068780","12075020"," If I had to guess, the people that own spy right now are selling calls to bulls."
"12076520","12077940"," That's what I think is happening. "
"12084870","12085670"," Hey, Jess."
"12089790","12093010"," So on Tesla, same story, right?"
"12093010","12094770"," We know a lot about Tesla trading Tesla."
"12095930","12098370"," We're doing this kind of repetitive around here, right?"
"12098630","12099590"," So we'll look up Tesla real quick. "
"12104400","12107460"," We'll let this Tesla chart load up here."
"12121790","12124910"," Tesla picked off 942.80 earlier today."
"12124910","12126710"," So 900 to 950, right?"
"12126870","12127610"," That next leg. "
"12135180","12140160"," When Tesla makes big moves like that, we tend to have one to three days of consolidation."
"12143520","12147660"," Still have the one good thing for Tesla right now is we have a lot of history back."
"12148160","12157820"," We spent some time from January 21st into February 17th, consolidating for a move lower. "
"12159940","12163400"," The capitulation moved down to, I want to say it's 650 in the after hours."
"12163760","12166500"," It could be around, I mean, it was 691 or so."
"12170220","12172880"," So just trying to make its way back up right now, right?"
"12173180","12173860"," Looking for consolidation. "
"12175600","12181200"," Tesla will be more than likely to consolidate between 883 and 950 for its next move."
"12184160","12188400"," That's pretty common for Tesla to make a move and then consolidate."
"12189940","12191000"," So we'll get Tesla real quick. "
"12208470","12210690"," A couple of rejections above here at 950."
"12211330","12213950"," Firm sellers see this big red here."
"12214510","12216370"," There are a wall of sellers trying to get out of their calls. "
"12217170","12218130"," More than likely these are bag holders."
"12220390","12224550"," You have to wear out these sellers, right?"
"12226090","12227150"," For the next leg higher."
"12229650","12232010"," And you can see it put down the bottom right hand side. "
"12232170","12233430"," More sellers than buyers currently."
"12234110","12237750"," So if you're looking for a place to buy a dip on Tesla."
"12238970","12239950"," Let's have a look, see. "
"12242110","12242790"," Same usual."
"12243030","12244690"," Same thing as usual, right?"
"12245310","12246610"," We're looking about buying any dips."
"12247250","12249310"," Any dips on Tesla by 910 to 900. "
"12252290","12254570"," As the days progress, that'll change."
"12254570","12262510"," As the days progress on Tesla, you'll look to follow this white line down here."
"12263470","12267230"," He buying these dips, buying these dips, buying these dips, buying these dips. "
"12267850","12270890"," Until you wear out the sellers above."
"12271290","12278130"," When you start to see eventually these sellers here at 950, that red line disappear, then you'll"
"12278130","12283670"," hold longer for the next move higher on a trend day."
"12284190","12286890"," So you're going to be looking to take profit up here at 950. "
"12287250","12289930"," And then you're going to be looking to buy these dips."
"12290570","12296990"," So you'd be setting up, you know, you're going to be setting alert down here, right?"
"12297890","12302410"," We'll trade this higher, set alert down here, trade that higher, set alert down here."
"12303390","12308290"," And then you can eventually smash the roof of pre-classic Tesla. "
"12309290","12310730"," You can see it down here too, right?"
"12310730","12312430"," A few days of trading sideways."
"12313130","12313670"," Move higher."
"12313970","12315470"," A few straight sideways, move higher. "
"12315630","12318170"," That even holds true for when you go up on Tesla, right?"
"12318830","12319270"," Nice big move."
"12319650","12321210"," Trade sideways, boom, move up."
"12322230","12324010"," We've seen that how many times in the past. "
"12324630","12326210"," We all know how Tesla trades."
"12326930","12327310"," Big move up."
"12327810","12329530"," Trade sideways for a couple days, boom, move up. "
"12329750","12331270"," Trade sideways for a couple days, boom, move up."
"12333370","12334710"," Kind of the same thing over here."
"12338720","12340040"," Wait for some support. "
"12340040","12340820"," Wait for the buyers."
"12341120","12341340"," Step in."
"12341520","12341580"," Wait. "
"12341840","12347420"," We're watching the options flow on Tesla so that you can buy one of these beautiful dips down here."
"12349840","12352140"," That's really what you're looking for is something like that over time."
"12352660","12354940"," It might take, you know, it might only take a day. "
"12356760","12358160"," Might not come this deep."
"12358420","12359280"," It might come down here."
"12362020","12365440"," But you already know your best buy is going to be here. "
"12365480","12368880"," You know the best buy is going to be down here if we can get down here at some point."
"12369840","12371240"," So you'll be your most profitable."
"12372100","12375160"," So anything down below 90910, let's call it. "
"12376440","12377960"," 910 or so, 90910."
"12378160","12385080"," You just buy them, sell the rips, unless you see the market trending that day."
"12385900","12387360"," You'll know if the market's trending right. "
"12393020","12394440"," Kind of coming down there right now."
"12394440","12399040"," You already had 919 on Tesla looking for a bounce at 910."
"12399040","12401660"," I already see it happening right now. "
"12415110","12416930"," I missed that weakness in the spy."
"12417130","12418770"," I was focused on some other stuff."
"12420610","12421530"," Oh, shit. "
"12421810","12424630"," S&P 500 features moving lower over the last few minutes."
"12425190","12425930"," It's funny."
"12426070","12426810"," I missed that whole thing. "
"12428490","12429010"," Portion."
"12429350","12432070"," Some comments that Fed chair Powell is making."
"12432330","12437690"," The house has quote inflation is much too high and fed will take quote necessary steps to address. "
"12438090","12439810"," Yeah, that video never came on either."
"12440070","12442090"," S&P moved around 20 points lower."
"12443950","12444730"," That's hilarious. "
"12447890","12449230"," Too fucking funny."
"12451170","12454470"," Too fucking funny."
"12455530","12461850"," So yes, as to that question that I said earlier, all those answers are giving you all day long. "
"12462110","12462210"," Yes."
"12465270","12465830"," Hilarious."
"12470760","12472020"," Too fucking funny. "
"12473320","12475220"," And spy just shit itself."
"12478340","12479460"," Too funny."
"12479720","12480480"," I missed that all that. "
"12480580","12486260"," I was looking at the Tesla at the Tesla feed."
"12486580","12487860"," I'm like, Oh, it's coming down right now."
"12488320","12489320"," Look at that surprise. "
"12492080","12492920"," Too funny."
"12494740","12495340"," All right."
"12495420","12496280"," So where are those bulls at?"
"12496980","12497900"," Just joking. "
"12499760","12500900"," You guys are hilarious."
"12503680","12504560"," Tesla or."
"12507770","12509630"," Chair Powell just shut all over the bulls. "
"12517490","12519270"," You guys want some price targets down below."
"12522670","12523430"," 440."
"12527030","12527790"," 440. "
"12538960","12540520"," Price target below 440."
"12542260","12543740"," Too fucking funny."
"12544900","12548640"," Oh shit. "
"12548940","12551000"," This is how the apples fall, right?"
"12551900","12552920"," And there it goes."
"12553480","12554120"," Fucking bleeding."
"12559580","12561580"," You guys want to show you in the chart?"
"12562500","12563240"," See that?"
"12564520","12566620"," And it just shit itself. "
"12569440","12570200"," Same chart."
"12570520","12570900"," There you go."
"12571100","12571540"," Right down there. "
"12573300","12575180"," There's that 440 down there for you."
"12576540","12577280"," Look at that."
"12577420","12578180"," Just fucking diarrhea. "
"12579980","12581780"," Just completely shit itself."
"12589670","12590910"," Yeah, I'm not happy that."
"12591150","12592590"," So some of the people were complaining. "
"12593650","12596010"," People were complaining on Ben Zinga this morning."
"12598330","12599410"," I'll show you up here."
"12600270","12601870"," Someone was complaining that. "
"12602210","12602270"," Yeah."
"12602410","12602830"," See, look at this."
"12603010","12603650"," Not hearing Charlie. "
"12605410","12606510"," So no squawk."
"12606670","12607270"," Do you guys see this?"
"12608670","12610690"," They're on the left hand side of the screen."
"12611590","12613090"," The squawk is down today. "
"12613950","12616230"," And so we'll give it one more day and see what happens."
"12617550","12620610"," Looks like the squawk is not working for Ben Zinga today."
"12628140","12630140"," So not a nice shit the bed moment for the spy. "
"12632520","12635220"," It's interesting that it tagged right here."
"12635800","12636880"," Tagged right at this 443."
"12639500","12641980"," So we'll see if it can make its way lower to 440 still. "
"12645800","12648740"," Where are all those bulls out there asking me if I still think it's going to 440."
"12653160","12653880"," Too funny."
"12656440","12659420"," This Powell is coming from Powell is almost a week late. "
"12659940","12661820"," I haven't seen the comments yet, so."
"12664380","12665500"," I haven't seen the copies."
"12665840","12670920"," You know, everyone said everyone was like, well, it was uber super duper bearish. "
"12670920","12672100"," What he said last week."
"12673120","12676020"," But, you know, it's not 20, 30% interest rates."
"12677980","12680740"," And he said he was committed to price controls. "
"12682640","12683200"," So."
"12684860","12689100"," You know, we did price in these rate hikes for this year."
"12689100","12694800"," So I don't know, like he needs to get a lot more bearish than what he's been in my view. "
"12699080","12700980"," Because it'll be run away inflation."
"12701900","12703040"," That's that's what it'll be."
"12703440","12709920"," I mean 2% there are 200 BTS is fucking nothing. "
"12711080","12713100"," And then it's funny because people are like, it's something."
"12713380","12714180"," I'm like, no, it isn't."
"12714780","12715800"," It is nothing. "
"12717360","12718880"," It is it is nothing."
"12722180","12724040"," Not in the grand scheme of things in the past."
"12724800","12726900"," And they still haven't done QT. "
"12727600","12730540"," You know, if they wanted to get bearish, they should have just announced QT."
"12731040","12732460"," They should have shocked the market."
"12733140","12736260"," Could have sold it down and off and we start over again. "
"12737480","12738540"," And you know, he's cut the pain out."
"12738940","12743160"," But you can't I think that you can't because of the presidential politics and the Senate politics."
"12746460","12748660"," If you guys are looking for if you guys missed that short. "
"12749740","12751320"," Just look for another one up here."
"12751780","12752540"," Look for."
"12756680","12758580"," Look for some kind of capitulation down. "
"12760760","12761540"," Right in here."
"12761740","12763300"," So 443 52."
"12765620","12768260"," If it even gets back if it even gets back up there. "
"12773210","12775650"," We'll look back on it up here and see it right here."
"12777590","12778870"," Looks like it's recovering though."
"12779450","12780870"," I'm not seeing sellers stepping in. "
"12781190","12781630"," Believe it or not."
"12782030","12783250"," Might be a nice dip by actually."
"12785090","12786930"," I'm not seeing the sellers stepping in. "
"12788270","12789410"," It's just look like this."
"12789490","12791010"," Look, I have looks more like a flush than anything."
"12792310","12793890"," I'm not seeing the sellers in here. "
"12794110","12794170"," Maybe."
"12797530","12798730"," I'm looking for him."
"12800350","12801150"," Where are they?"
"12808030","12809090"," See him right here. "
"12812170","12814130"," Yeah, I guess there are some heavy sellers here."
"12814270","12815130"," You can kind of see him."
"12818770","12820110"," Looks more like an intraday. "
"12820150","12821430"," Take money and run kind of a thing."
"12825350","12826790"," There's some heavy sellers up here."
"12826930","12828550"," We're not still not substantial. "
"12841440","12843940"," Yeah, we used to we used to have 20% interest rates."
"12844260","12848220"," You guys have to like you guys have to look at the long view on."
"12851220","12852180"," How bearish. "
"12852880","12853420"," They are."
"12853540","12854540"," They're not that bearish."
"12854700","12855420"," It's not. "
"12855740","12858440"," It's weird too, because they're like, Oh, he's been super hogish."
"12858560","12859860"," I'm like, dude, what the fuck is?"
"12860180","12863700"," If that's super hogish, then we haven't seen shit."
"12870890","12872750"," Well, so we priced in. "
"12873090","12875510"," So just to be clear, let's be super clear, right?"
"12875950","12878190"," We have priced in seven rate hikes this year."
"12879330","12881850"," At .25 BTS for the year."
"12882070","12883090"," That's priced into the market. "
"12883950","12885010"," But that's been done."
"12885990","12889870"," So you need to have something more fucking hawkish than that."
"12890870","12892230"," For us to go lower. "
"12892810","12893970"," I'm sorry, you do."
"12894190","12896510"," You need to have QT and that's the other thing."
"12896970","12899210"," We've priced in QT as well to an extent. "
"12901010","12902610"," But that hasn't shown itself either."
"12902790","12909950"," So when you start to see the credit markets getting wary, I don't think it's because they think"
"12909950","12910750"," he's going to do more."
"12910750","12916570"," I think the credit markets get wary of it because they think that he won't, you know, the Fed is"
"12916570","12921810"," known for doing too much too late. "
"12922210","12926070"," This can be when they're supporting the markets."
"12926150","12931010"," And this can be when they're tightening the markets in both in both instances."
"12932010","12938110"," They tend to publicly at least, you know, say one thing and then they're behind the curve. "
"12938110","12940190"," And this is on both sides of things, right?"
"12944010","12949390"," So that same thing, that same thing is, and the longer that we put it off, the worse it's going"
"12949390","12949650"," to get."
"12949770","12956170"," It doesn't matter if it's now, but from his class conversation to me, I smelled to me, I smelled"
"12956170","12962450"," like, oh, we're going to pump this market and then just, you know, create a bubble and then we're"
"12962450","12964470"," going to fucking crash it at some point."
"12965610","12966770"," Next couple of years. "
"12973340","12974700"," I'm not a bear."
"12975280","12978540"," I'm theoretically in my brain."
"12979320","12984340"," I want to see the market go up consistently and cleanly for years and, you know, decades to come. "
"12984720","12985940"," But that just doesn't happen."
"12986080","12986640"," We know that, right?"
"12986840","12988980"," We know that that's not how markets work."
"12992840","12997680"," And so they're going to squeeze it for everything they can in both directions when they sell it all"
"12997680","13002380"," off and when they pump it all off, they kill it on both sides. "
"13007930","13010330"," So we're finding some recovery quickly in the spa."
"13010530","13015330"," We had a little bit of negative news come out on J-POW just a few moments ago."
"13016610","13019810"," And we're coming back up to a quick rejection point here. "
"13021750","13023190"," This volatility here."
"13023270","13024810"," We'll see if it reverses and heads lower."
"13031840","13036500"," Lots of dip buyers still stepping in here or at least algo dip buyers still stepping in here. "
"13041080","13041940"," Yeah, it is."
"13042080","13050000"," It is more hawkish at .50. It's a good job J closing your puts."
"13050460","13051360"," You need more. "
"13051720","13052300"," You need more."
"13053460","13056240"," And you're not going to get it from this is the other side of it."
"13056240","13059020"," This is when you start to look at everything together, piecing it all together. "
"13062640","13064400"," You're not going to get it from companies."
"13064720","13068620"," You're going to get companies that, again, instead of announcing new products, they're going to"
"13068620","13070560"," focus on products they already have."
"13070780","13072740"," They're going to focus on laying people off. "
"13073500","13079180"," There's like steps to the market rolling over and those steps could take multiple years."
"13079540","13080040"," Believe it or not."
"13080140","13081200"," One, two, three years. "
"13081760","13088260"," It's not going to happen in one moment and you're not seeing J-POW nor the Fed willing to crash"
"13088260","13090480"," the market in one fell swoop either."
"13090900","13095320"," So this could be a process that takes, it could happen tomorrow."
"13095460","13096980"," We never know what's going to happen, but it could. "
"13097360","13100640"," It could be a process that takes one to three years."
"13103040","13103540"," Right."
"13104000","13110940"," And so when you're listening to people's takes on this, you have to keep in mind that it's not the"
"13110940","13113900"," trade that takes place in the next day or five days typically. "
"13114700","13117280"," So you have to kind of time out how long it's going to take."
"13118580","13122620"," How bear, like let's say, like, so I was trying to time, I was trying to time."
"13123680","13127160"," Yesterday, I think I made a post about how long it could take us to get to like 360. "
"13128180","13130600"," And that could take until 2024, believe it or not."
"13130800","13132380"," Like not, not guaranteed, but it could."
"13133080","13138220"," Like you could get into a bear market that just takes years to trade down. "
"13140620","13144400"," Unless you see a much more aggressive fed."
"13145240","13147960"," And we're not seeing that much more aggressive fed."
"13148180","13154240"," So if you're not seeing that, if you're from a hedge fund or an institution or a bank, and then"
"13154240","13158580"," you start to say, well, shit, we're going to have this market to fuck around with for one to three"
"13158580","13158940"," years. "
"13159820","13161840"," Then they're going to take it long to extremes."
"13162200","13166960"," They're going to take it to short to extremes, even though we're not going to get any growth out of"
"13166960","13167080"," it."
"13167600","13173520"," Then you're going to have certain seasons, seasonality, where you are going to have some companies"
"13173520","13175020"," giving great reports still. "
"13175300","13177800"," That's going to be hard to believe as well, but you will."
"13178320","13182800"," You will see companies give us, even if the analysts are never right, we already know that, right?"
"13183420","13184360"," Analysts are never right."
"13185160","13188300"," About 70% of the time, they're wrong in their estimates. "
"13189300","13193700"," I don't know if that's intentional, if they're just dumb or whatever, but, you know, I wouldn't be"
"13193700","13196420"," shocked to see companies turning profits for at least."
"13197620","13200780"," Three to four more quarters that wouldn't shock me in the least."
"13201180","13204640"," Or even if it was spread out, let's say they had, you know, like two good quarters, one bad"
"13204640","13206900"," quarter, two more good quarters than one more bad quarter. "
"13207140","13209300"," That's still a year and a half, two years away."
"13210700","13211500"," Down the road."
"13213760","13221360"," So you have to like measure what you're hearing from J-POW and how hawkish she is versus time as"
"13221360","13221660"," well. "
"13223920","13226280"," And then you have to think about the politics in the background."
"13226380","13228720"," You have to think about the greed in commodities."
"13231020","13236540"," You know, it's like so many other moving parts, even if, even if, even if the credit market's"
"13236540","13237380"," telling you different, some different. "
"13237820","13239080"," I brought that up a week ago too."
"13239440","13246160"," And that is that you have to remember that the Fed not only made a Fed put the Fed put"
"13246160","13248240"," that came out in March 2020."
"13248720","13253760"," Well, no one ever wants to talk about the Fed credit put that came out in 2020. "
"13255440","13258380"," And the Fed credit put is a big, big part of this."
"13259700","13264900"," So if we could get that at any moment too, we start selling hard or they get super bearish."
"13265160","13266140"," They're going to try to. "
"13266260","13267380"," They did it in March 2020."
"13267420","13270380"," They'll try it again if we, if we sell the market that hard."
"13270580","13275500"," So more than likely there's a, there's a backroom agreement that's going to take one to three"
"13275500","13275740"," years. "
"13275740","13280380"," So you're not going to get, you know, 250 this, this month."
"13280980","13285060"," I know that there's bears out there that are like, yeah, we're getting 250 or, you know, the big"
"13285060","13285400"," rainbow."
"13286780","13288200"," Rainbow market crash. "
"13288840","13289780"," It's, it's possible."
"13290620","13292380"," That risk is always there, but."
"13294080","13296400"," And contextually for how hawkish J."
"13296540","13303240"," It wasn't that hawkish and the scary part is the longer that they do this, the more severe those"
"13303240","13303980"," swings become. "
"13305260","13306060"," Until it breaks."
"13307560","13309800"," So how long does that take is the question?"
"13313300","13314800"," You know, I don't know the answer to that."
"13315860","13317760"," I don't think anybody out there does. "
"13320560","13323600"," You know what, know what the answer of when that happens is."
"13324440","13329660"," I mean, even, even this, even the move from January 4th or whatever it was."
"13331160","13332400"," Until last week. "
"13334260","13336020"," Wasn't that big of a move down."
"13336320","13339180"," If you look on, if you look on a 200 day."
"13340500","13346480"," MA right, if you look at a 200 day MA and then bring up about 365 that MA. "
"13347140","13349220"," And look it over, look over it over."
"13350540","13351260"," I don't know."
"13351840","13356980"," 20 years, 30 years or so, and we haven't even made a move down yet. "
"13358120","13363920"," So we have a lot, well, a long way we could go down and time wise, it could take years,"
"13363920","13366340"," you know, to get that far down."
"13369440","13373580"," And the only way that you have years, you start stacking for where we are right now."
"13374000","13379440"," And the way that you stack years of us going up like we did in 2020, 2021, if you look"
"13379440","13380800"," decades in the past. "
"13381640","13388700"," When the, then the years where we, where we trended over the, a long amount of time over one year,"
"13388820","13390620"," two years, three years, something like that."
"13392200","13393660"," The Fed was accommodating."
"13394600","13396560"," It was never when the Fed was not accommodating. "
"13397360","13402100"," And so the only accommodation that we have right now from the Fed is that the rates aren't that"
"13402100","13405280"," high and that they haven't begun QT yet."
"13406120","13412300"," So as long as that accommodation to some extent stays in place, you see that we have, we, I know"
"13412300","13413120"," that we're, I know about MA."
"13413300","13414020"," Everybody knows about MA. "
"13414460","13415500"," It's still haven't done it, okay?"
"13416160","13417580"," So that is part of the accommodation."
"13418180","13422400"," And then the other part of the accommodation, believe it or not, is that the rates are not that"
"13422400","13422860"," high yet."
"13423580","13428260"," You will, you will, if we, if we spread it out over two, three years, you will see rates go"
"13428260","13428420"," up. "
"13429940","13431800"," To 10% to 15%."
"13431800","13432400"," It's weird."
"13432580","13432780"," It's weird. "
"13432980","13434740"," I heard people say, you'll never see that again."
"13434860","13435660"," And I'm like, that's not true."
"13436440","13438420"," We've seen that a couple times, right?"
"13438660","13443340"," So there's, it's not like we can't do this again where we need to actually get rates high. "
"13447360","13450440"," And the longer we put it off, the more inevitable it becomes."
"13456430","13459330"," A little bit of a reversal on the spy currently again."
"13460310","13466710"," So you get this one cell here and we've got a little bit of a consolidation. "
"13466910","13469990"," We'll see if this rejects and makes the move lower or not."
"13470810","13475130"," I know that they're the, the bots are on, the bots are on 445 C's."
"13475250","13477630"," They at one point, they're at like a dollar $60 $70. "
"13478110","13480610"," Maybe even as high as dollar, it wasn't paying attention to that one moment."
"13480610","13484570"," But they've gone down to 60 cents per call."
"13485030","13487330"," It looks like they've added some more calls to it. "
"13487650","13493670"," Maybe another third if they've bought lower to try to regain some of their losses, but those calls"
"13493670","13494130"," are dead."
"13495110","13500930"," So there'll be, hopefully a capitulation move by bulls at some point and they'll, they'll sell out"
"13500930","13501510"," of their positions."
"13510690","13514630"," So Jay Paul did say he was prepared to raise interest rates and half percentage point steps. "
"13514930","13515810"," Did he say that today?"
"13517810","13520470"," Is the chat and did he say that today by chance?"
"13526270","13529090"," I'm missing what you're missing your contacts from above."
"13529890","13539810"," I missed your comments on the Wall Street Journal article."
"13579980","13581440"," My mic is quiet right now. "
"13581740","13582700"," Oh, Jay Paus, Mike."
"13585080","13586800"," I posted it in the last hour."
"13589200","13594900"," So Chet is saying that in a Wall Street Journal article in the last hour, there was a quote that"
"13594900","13601400"," he was willing to raise rates by point five VPS now that is not priced into the market. "
"13602480","13608180"," If he does mention that in this speech at any point today, it should be very negative on the"
"13608180","13608460"," market."
"13609420","13618600"," We've got we've got priced in right now point two five or 25 VPS and the move higher here."
"13620100","13622340"," Takes and or we've priced in somewhat. "
"13622860","13627200"," Twenty five and some close getting close to five 50 VPS."
"13627940","13634900"," But this move higher most certainly is not we haven't priced in 50 VPS at this point."
"13635920","13639120"," And I'm not listening to it currently let me bring it back up and listen to him talk. "
"13679550","13680350"," Oh shit."
"13683930","13684870"," I'm just talking about it right now."
"13702610","13703630"," Holy shit. "
"13713650","13714630"," That's not good."
"13729670","13744360"," Okay."
"13760830","13762850"," He's answered some pretty good questions right now. "
"13823160","13824940"," I'm making some serious money right now."
"13831990","13835070"," He's being pretty aggressive right now in his speech."
"13870620","13900600"," Okay. "
"13900600","13900640"," I'm not listening to him."
"13910540","13911500"," I'm not listening to him for 40."
"13913100","13915300"," Make sure you guys are listening to JPower right now. "
"13940400","13941660"," That's not our bullshit."
"13941660","13944380"," We were heading towards the rollover in the market before 2020."
"13969570","13970850"," So be careful here. "
"13971290","13975710"," He's saying third and finally this part of his speech will typically take some of the pressure off"
"13975710","13976930"," the market going down."
"13983710","13985830"," His negative comments are starting to wrap up."
"14034220","14035780"," Keep on pushing. "
"14042640","14045120"," Keep on pushing."
"14045820","14047060"," Another 20 points."
"14047300","14048960"," Give you another 20 fucking points. "
"14072380","14073520"," Oh, yeah."
"14085200","14086380"," That's pretty fucking hawkish."
"14086400","14087260"," I got a bit of an admit. "
"14094140","14096860"," I'm going to have to watch this again tonight closely."
"14099340","14102360"," That's most certainly this is interesting."
"14102740","14103380"," He didn't make this speech. "
"14103440","14106780"," He should have made this speech during FOMC, but he couldn't have, right?"
"14107820","14109740"," We would have hit 390 that morning."
"14133480","14135420"," How is the Buckstops hair speech?"
"14136780","14137820"," Holy shit."
"14138500","14140340"," And she's like, oh, I'm going to break it in it. "
"14140600","14142340"," Pucking it all up."
"14143800","14145280"," The Buckstops here."
"14150390","14151770"," I'm surprised more people"
"14151770","14162810"," aren't"
"14162810","14162810"," watching this. "
"14199860","14201460"," I don't know if that's going to happen."
"14201460","14203560"," This was billed as a big nothing burger."
"14205580","14207200"," But it's something. "
"14212240","14214420"," This is that is not the speech."
"14218160","14236190"," That is not"
"14236190","14242390"," the speech that you want to be hearing as a bull without a doubt."
"14242390","14246130"," That is not the speech that you want to hear as a bull. "
"14246250","14252530"," That shit is going to get quoted and headlined everywhere, whether you believe it or not."
"14253670","14260630"," That's going to get quoted, dissected, discussed, and that is not what you want to be hearing."
"14281920","14284060"," Without a doubt, that's not what you want to be hearing. "
"14284060","14285460"," You did not want to hear that speech."
"14285720","14289100"," As soon as that speech gets digested, this market is going to shit."
"14290900","14293420"," There's just no way around it. "
"14295240","14298100"," Your first price target down below is 440 still."
"14300560","14305440"," Those are some major headlines that is not what the market wants to hear."
"14305540","14306560"," That's not what the bulls want to hear. "
"14306760","14308940"," You don't want to hear that speech ever from J-POW."
"14308940","14310820"," That says bearish as it can get."
"14312720","14320340"," Watching puts roll in across the market, across the queues, spy, apple, DKNG of all things for some"
"14320340","14320520"," reason. "
"14320880","14322240"," Someone wanted to buy some Donkey Kong puts."
"14322520","14322920"," I don't know why."
"14324340","14326700"," But that's some headline making news right there. "
"14327060","14330500"," Not only is it a headline making news, but that is news that's going to be discussed."
"14338540","14341340"," They could have some ramifications across the world."
"14341540","14342840"," You don't want to hear stuff like that. "
"14343060","14343840"," It's not true."
"14344120","14344960"," It's all true."
"14347560","14356480"," Last week on this channel we discussed what he needs to say to stop inflation in the FOMC meeting. "
"14356840","14362480"," We've discussed the things that he hasn't said."
"14362480","14363480"," And today he said them."
"14363860","14365260"," He just said them right now. "
"14365360","14372740"," He's saying the things that he needs to actually say to gain control of the market and the economy,"
"14372740","14378640"," believe it or not."
"14385870","14386350"," Yeah."
"14387430","14387750"," Chatting. "
"14387850","14391450"," Good job pointing out that headline from the Wall Street Journal, brother."
"14394330","14395190"," Yeah, definitely."
"14395410","14400930"," This is what you wanted to hear on FOMC because the market would have dumped. "
"14403250","14405730"," I keep jumping in and out of 440 P's."
"14407190","14408910"," They keep buying them and then selling them."
"14409230","14411170"," If anyone wants to know, I think Paul was asking. "
"14425220","14428660"," Yeah, XLF is still kind of staying on the side there."
"14432640","14435960"," Yeah, JPM XLF is all kind of trading sideways right now."
"14437620","14442460"," I had a quick bounce on Tesla down at 9.10 just now. "
"14447080","14450980"," But you did that speech right there."
"14451200","14452360"," I have to at some points."
"14453140","14455160"," I'm going to have to watch that speech again. "
"14456820","14458060"," Because he hit every line."
"14458280","14460140"," I mean, you don't want to hear anything he said there."
"14461000","14463680"," And he's saying what everybody else seems to know. "
"14466600","14468360"," He's saying what everybody seems to know."
"14468520","14473280"," We all know what the truth is, but we all know that we'll take advantage of the market regardless."
"14474240","14476380"," We were talking about someone on an eye here in chat. "
"14476560","14480100"," We're talking about it when the person said exactly what I thought, right?"
"14480100","14485160"," Which is he's basically accepted inflation rather than recession."
"14485640","14490440"," And it's a it's a it's a perfect summary on a small like one or two sentences."
"14492100","14493140"," Did he. "
"14494320","14496820"," You know, the or the FOMC speech."
"14497040","14499300"," It seemed like he was accepting inflation."
"14500600","14504400"," In the FOMC speech because none of the tools that they're implementing. "
"14505340","14508880"," Points towards having any kind of control over our economy."
"14510260","14511640"," Nor the stock market."
"14512400","14514300"," And to me, that's why we went up. "
"14515420","14517920"," Partially the reason why we went up, even if it was only short covering."
"14520560","14525960"," That's the part of the reason that we went up because sentiment at that meeting, whether you liked"
"14525960","14528120"," it or not, was that they're fucking crazy."
"14528480","14531620"," Now, there's no fucking way that their tools and what they're doing is enough. "
"14532580","14533680"," To stem inflation."
"14535600","14538480"," Or the housing market or anything else, right?"
"14538600","14540380"," Or shortages with the war going on with shortages."
"14541380","14544560"," So the question people always ask that question was like, well, here's the deal. "
"14545020","14546120"," Where are you going to put your money?"
"14546320","14547440"," There's no other place to put it."
"14548380","14551060"," You have to be if you're if you have money, if you're wealthy."
"14552320","14553280"," If you're wealthy. "
"14555000","14559700"," You have to take risk on and that risk is going to wind up still being in the stock market."
"14559700","14561460"," Or real estate."
"14562880","14565880"," Unless they take the the the candy bowl away. "
"14566580","14569160"," On real estate and the stock market."
"14569600","14575060"," Because otherwise if inflation is going to run rampant, then the only way for you to outpace"
"14575060","14575360"," inflation."
"14575980","14578560"," Is to take risk on the stock market. "
"14578840","14581720"," But he's saying right now something completely different."
"14582320","14586540"," And then that right that he's going to take the candy bowl away from the stock market."
"14587780","14589760"," Now he still has and it's still talk. "
"14590080","14595360"," It's it's not like they have they haven't raised 50 BPS yet, but I can promise you this."
"14596040","14600020"," That the dot plot doesn't show it and the futures fund rate."
"14600440","14604400"," Doesn't show 50 BPS per per meeting either. "
"14604840","14606800"," So they're going to want to price that in."
"14606880","14609440"," I want you to be aware of that as a market note."
"14610140","14612260"," That that is not priced into the market. "
"14613880","14618860"," Regardless and that speech right there and then and whatever that article dropped in the Wall"
"14618860","14619400"," Street Journal."
"14619840","14622560"," Should have some impact on the market at some point."
"14624740","14626580"," As it as it's digested. "
"14643220","14644600"," Do I think this will set up?"
"14644620","14645160"," Yes, I do."
"14645780","14648220"," I think this is some of the rest of the idea."
"14648220","14652660"," I do because they have to they have to price it in. "
"14653300","14657980"," And it's not priced and we can look at the futures fund rate."
"14658700","14661160"," And this is not priced into that rate."
"14662000","14665400"," So it not being priced in it must be priced in there. "
"14665540","14670820"," It's required the market required, but the market will price it in ahead of it happening."
"14671720","14674560"," There's one thing that the market does not like in the market."
"14675260","14680400"," Specifically banks do not like unknown news, right?"
"14680580","14681420"," They just don't like it. "
"14681520","14683840"," We could trade up here, but it won't matter."
"14684020","14685080"," They're going to price it in."
"14685300","14686000"," They promise you. "
"14686780","14687800"," They promise you."
"14688120","14691120"," It's sometimes you will see a you'll see a squeeze higher again."
"14691720","14692980"," But then it will price in. "
"14693200","14699120"," If it's unknown news and they're breaking it to you right now and saying start fucking pricing in"
"14699120","14700620"," higher interest rates."
"14700620","14702620"," We're just talking about this, right?"
"14702940","14705220"," Before he started speaking, we were talking about this."
"14705500","14708540"," You have we've been speaking about for like two weeks or a week, right?"
"14708760","14710740"," You have to be more aggressive. "
"14711300","14716560"," If you're not more aggressive, then you know, you're going to lose control."
"14716980","14718760"," You you are going to lose control."
"14720180","14724140"," And so we don't I know well, you can just look at the future funds rate. "
"14724260","14728860"," We don't we haven't priced in 50 BPS moves each fed meeting."
"14728860","14730460"," I haven't listened closely enough."
"14730460","14737880"," I'm going to have to go back to the speech and probably listen to it two or three times to"
"14737880","14741060"," get a better grip on what it means for the markets for the moments. "
"14741060","14747940"," But from the first takeaway that I have of that speech that took place, it doesn't bode well."
"14749640","14755300"," If anything, you probably want to put some put spreads on the market right now."
"14757460","14763460"," Hands down or even if you pull off later, get some put spreads on the market because they're going"
"14763460","14764060"," to price it in. "
"14766340","14767440"," It's not even a question."
"14813250","14817870"," We'll have to see if we'll have to see the impact my my thought process from here."
"14817890","14820950"," I'm going to have I'm going to actually have to listen to this speech once the speech ends. "
"14821130","14822670"," I could care less about the Q&A."
"14823390","14829410"," But I want to listen to what the speech has to say and then see what the how it's digested"
"14829410","14834370"," by the news and how it's rolled out by larger news organizations."
"14839500","14844680"," You're going to hear or both say it's just talk right I agree with that to an extent that it"
"14844680","14845520"," is just talk. "
"14854960","14861820"," But I will say this to you that the market's going to price until until I hear otherwise for news"
"14861820","14862160"," organization."
"14863500","14871520"," However, it's consumed or digested or fed to traders in my view, the market will begin to price in"
"14871520","14872340"," 50 bps."
"14874560","14883000"," Rate hikes and not just 0.25. There will be opportunities for puts. "
"14883680","14885020"," The rallies are huge going down."
"14885440","14886640"," We are only halfway through the day."
"14887780","14889080"," Just a slow walk before it dumps. "
"14889800","14891420"," Yeah, this is it's going down in my view."
"14892760","14894900"," That was not the news that bulls wanted to hear."
"14900960","14903620"," Without a doubt that is not the news the bulls wanted to hear. "
"14907090","14909110"," We have the VIX climbing now."
"14909790","14910850"," It's at 2471."
"14912290","14914930"," You're looking for another retest of 2514. "
"14916770","14918930"," There's another number to be pay attention to."
"14919050","14928730"," That's 25.25. That also lends itself to volatility heading into the next FOMC meeting."
"14929540","14935450"," As well, it kind of puts a damper on. "
"14937230","14941150"," It puts a damper on your next FOMC meeting date."
"14941450","14948150"," So you could even argue at this point that leading into the next FOMC meeting."
"14949170","14956910"," That there's now volatility just based upon do they raise 50 bps and not 25 bps. "
"14970080","14973080"," And that kind of tops off the market even more."
"14989560","14990240"," Thanks."
"14990460","14991300"," Tight here. "
"15028320","15043310"," Okay."
"15059740","15059860"," All right."
"15062880","15068920"," Now trading down to 441.23. It's looking for that test of 440. "
"15077100","15078360"," I heard bombs."
"15078700","15079960"," I know that I heard bombs in there."
"15082180","15088360"," They also, if you recall from the last or from the last FOMC meeting, Jerome, or I don't know if"
"15088360","15095400"," he stated this, but it was announced that they'll be holding the next six meetings live, which is"
"15095400","15096500"," unusual as well. "
"15097180","15098920"," You don't always see that."
"15099740","15104640"," And then pairing that with the statement from today that they can raise 50 bps."
"15108500","15110320"," That certainly isn't good for the bulls. "
"15118650","15128130"," Now, by now trading at 440.98. We're looking for a tag of 440.06."
"15133910","15135730"," We'll look for some lower prices."
"15139710","15140290"," 438."
"15148670","15149250"," Okay. "
"15149290","15152870"," You just get yourself some weekly points or puts on a pullback here."
"15152870","15153170"," Let's see."
"15153250","15154030"," We get a bounce at 440. "
"15154490","15155770"," Just get yourself some weekly puts."
"15158730","15159610"," Expiring on Friday."
"15159970","15162150"," If you get another bounce here at some point as we move into the 440. "
"15174020","15176820"," So whoever asked me earlier today, do I think we're hitting 440?"
"15177500","15177900"," Yes."
"15178640","15179480"," Yes, I do."
"15183280","15193510"," Oh, there"

"15239440","15241460"," Where we talk about earlier, right?"
"15241580","15243080"," We talked about where we should be headed."
"15243720","15245780"," You know that big red, gray, red bar down. "
"15246120","15246960"," They were like fuck that."
"15247460","15251120"," So if we break 440 here, next stop, ready?"
"15252560","15253180"," You ready?"
"15254680","15255260"," Next stop."
"15255440","15256240"," If we break 440. "
"15258020","15260520"," There's going to be a touch of 430."
"15261420","15261480"," Okay."
"15262220","15263180"," So there's my price target. "
"15263440","15265800"," You'll probably see a bounce at 440 at some point."
"15265800","15268380"," I don't think you'll see a quick breakthrough here."
"15268800","15274960"," But I do think at some point today you'll see like a bounce and then a continued move down. "
"15275540","15279120"," So my price target from this point forward is 430."
"15280900","15284120"," Just based upon that speech, I'm going to have to review it again."
"15286420","15288520"," Make sure you're timing yourself properly. "
"15289240","15292300"," When I review that speech again, I'm not paying attention to Twitter right now."
"15292380","15293520"," I don't know what the Twitter versus saying."
"15293520","15297200"," But from what I heard in that speech, that is not bullish. "
"15298060","15299380"," In any way, shape or form."
"15301640","15303480"," Price target down below 430."
"15305380","15306760"," Expect a bounce at 440. "
"15307820","15310020"," And then eventually a breach of 440."
"15311120","15312800"," And a move down to 430."
"15313180","15315500"," I don't know how quickly that takes or that that takes to happen. "
"15316960","15320760"," But I'm going to assume at this point that you're going to see a retest of 430."
"15324030","15325710"," They're going to price it in, I promise you."
"15327750","15330130"," I promise you from what I heard, right?"
"15330270","15334250"," From what I heard in that speech just then, they're going to price it in. "
"15335550","15337450"," And you don't even want to know those numbers."
"15338330","15341310"," Those numbers are down 390."
"15344550","15346130"," We're at 440 right now. "
"15346310","15348430"," That's 500 points and it can go more."
"15348430","15350250"," It can go 360."
"15352770","15354230"," They can actually go that deep. "
"15354570","15356590"," So we're at 440 right now."
"15357670","15359390"," Even if you see a bounce here."
"15360130","15361890"," Let's say let's see you see a bounce here. "
"15362070","15364090"," If I have to watch that video again."
"15364930","15367070"," But even if you get a bounce like this, right?"
"15368170","15369690"," You are going to breach 440."
"15370510","15373110"," Unless there's something that I don't know in that speech that I missed. "
"15374190","15375270"," They're going to price it in."
"15375430","15377130"," And then price it in takes this to 39."
"15377130","15380910"," That's 500 points from where we are right now, right?"
"15381570","15383010"," So just be aware of that. "
"15384430","15387510"," I haven't checked the news yet to see what the interpretation is."
"15387630","15391570"," I haven't seen what the pundits are going to say about it."
"15391570","15392430"," I will tell you this. "
"15393310","15398270"," That if they quote that speech anywhere or if they start to digest that speech."
"15400170","15401510"," At any point."
"15402770","15407230"," And in 50 basis points is on the table during these live fed meetings. "
"15407890","15410670"," And if inflation continues to rage out of control."
"15411550","15416290"," If the one headline news story he just told you."
"15416810","15421270"," That you're looking for is an end to our cessation of. "
"15422210","15424130"," Fighting with Ukraine in Russia."
"15425070","15427370"," So as a bull, that's what you're looking for."
"15427510","15430370"," You're looking for shortages to go away. "
"15430370","15430450"," Right."
"15432250","15433950"," So if you see us move up here."
"15435710","15437470"," If you see a failure in here. "
"15442730","15443250"," Right."
"15445210","15447810"," You know that calls are dead now."
"15448070","15452190"," So eventually bulls are going to sell their calls. "
"15454110","15456230"," But I want you to see where we are."
"15456370","15460170"," We already know that if we start to price that in right."
"15460970","15463690"," If we start to price in 50 bit basis point. "
"15464530","15467730"," Rate increases we have not priced that into the market yet."
"15469750","15470410"," Have not."
"15478800","15488560"," Look, if you're if you're a bull that was not the speech you wanted, I promise. "
"15490360","15491800"," That was not the speech you wanted."
"15493480","15494920"," That was not the one."
"15496860","15500480"," Now that does that mean we trade down a for 390 today?"
"15500680","15500840"," No. "
"15501920","15504900"," Banks want banks always want to be in before you too."
"15505080","15506540"," So be conscience of that."
"15507080","15507420"," Right. "
"15507620","15511140"," You might not see the the push down lower right away."
"15513790","15517870"," More than likely at some point today going to be looking to grab some put spreads."
"15519690","15523610"," If I can catch one of these bounces and just grab something for Friday. "
"15525310","15528010"," But no way shape or form was that speech bullish."
"15531630","15535320"," All right on."
"15535460","15536920"," Thanks, Admiral, for tipping me. "
"15537300","15538720"," I appreciate it for supporting the channel."
"15539820","15541380"," All this stuff costs money, man."
"15543880","15547220"," I appreciate the tip and support the channel. "
"15549300","15553220"," I'll bring this I'll bring this I'll bring this chart back up."
"15554880","15556760"," So that's pretty good calls today, right?"
"15556920","15559400"," We we knew we were going to 447 or so."
"15560980","15564940"," We figured we'd go, but we'd come back down to retest for 40. "
"15566740","15568500"," That was not the new now."
"15568600","15573660"," Now, normally if that if so if J pal had been bullish in his speech."
"15574360","15577960"," I would have said that we would have caught this bounce on 440. "
"15578700","15580360"," And we'd make another run."
"15581160","15582780"," I would say right here."
"15582860","15586380"," I would say buy some weekly calls for 450. "
"15587360","15590020"," And it might take you week to get to 450 from here."
"15590120","15593420"," So at 440 right now, if you're a bull and you thought that speech was bullish."
"15594000","15596160"," Buy yourself some 450 C's right here. "
"15597340","15600420"," For Friday or for Monday and you should be able to make some."
"15600500","15602180"," Well, I wouldn't buy them for like a weekly."
"15602400","15604920"," I'd buy like a month out of three month out for 50 C's. "
"15605580","15606640"," And you should get up to 450."
"15607620","15608820"," That speech to me."
"15608820","15614220"," I usually have a pretty decent handle on interpreting interpreting his speeches. "
"15614240","15616860"," Not always, but nine hundred percent of the time I do."
"15617480","15621680"," And that was not the that was not the speech you wanted."
"15635810","15636770"," It's wild too. "
"15636910","15642110"," There's a bull saying that today's bottom is in that 440 68."
"15642570","15643670"," I promise you that it's not."
"15643670","15645850"," Not probleming. "
"15645970","15646370"," Not promise."
"15646610","15648310"," But you know, it's."
"15651450","15653450"," Unless the news is spun differently. "
"15656790","15658210"," That's not the speech you wanted, man."
"15660530","15662070"," Let me ask you guys in."
"15663470","15666450"," Yeah, they're going to short cover rally right now, but it's not going to be. "
"15667870","15669230"," No, the low of the day is not."
"15669350","15670470"," He's retards on Twitter."
"15670710","15671690"," I'm looking at Twitter right now. "
"15671690","15674650"," They're saying they're saying that the bottom is in."
"15674790","15676110"," I'm like bottoms not in right now."
"15677330","15679130"," Bottom is most definitely not in. "
"15686980","15688760"," Vix is still climbing right now."
"15700210","15702830"," 440 P's are still holding value right now."
"15725720","15732140"," So, you know, reading some comments and not in chat but somewhere else in someone saying, well, we"
"15732140","15733540"," all expected 50 anyways. "
"15733780","15736340"," Market is acting like this is new."
"15737240","15739360"," I want to be clear with you out there."
"15739440","15743760"," If you don't know this or do know this, there are charts that track. "
"15744780","15750600"," What is priced into the market and we have not priced in 50 basis points to the market."
"15750740","15751600"," I want to be clear on that."
"15754400","15759760"," I'm like reading some comments that are making me cringe on the Internet right now. "
"15760720","15764800"," They're making me cringe because it makes me wonder if they understand."
"15766340","15772440"," The actual facts of what's priced in and what's not priced into our markets that you can track."
"15774080","15775980"," What's priced in and what's not priced in. "
"15776720","15792630"," A little pissed"
"15792630","15794930"," off though at Ben Zinga for not."
"15797410","15798730"," Talking about this today."
"15798870","15800050"," This is important information. "
"15800430","15806070"," They're going to burn every one of these calls on 445."
"15806530","15807310"," I'm seeing a market update."
"15808970","15812150"," Bitcoin at 40,970. "

"15854700","15855640"," I saw that too. "
"15855760","15856900"," And you can see it."
"15857040","15857320"," You know what?"
"15857340","15859440"," You know, it's fucked up, Josh is that."
"15859440","15863320"," I was just watching it along with you. "
"15863720","15870060"," And when that interviewer or the host said something to him like, she was yucking it up thinking it"
"15870060","15871300"," was fucking funny what he said."
"15871300","15872900"," It's not fucking funny what he said."
"15873680","15874100"," And. "
"15876940","15878680"," It's not it's not funny what he said."
"15878900","15884260"," And you can see it in his stance on the screen and then that whoever that person was."
"15884480","15886420"," I want to say a woman because I want to see my it's a woman, but. "
"15889120","15891580"," You can see that he didn't want to make that speech."
"15892360","15893620"," Absolutely 100%."
"15894440","15895600"," You can see they don't make that. "
"15895700","15897040"," That was a hard speech to make."
"15897720","15899340"," I agree with you, Josh, 100% bro."
"15910840","15911940"," Yeah, I'm going to be looking to. "
"15912220","15915500"," I'm looking for any opportunity at this point to to add some more put."
"15915740","15916400"," I'm going to throw some money."

"15971730","15972830"," Somewhere in here."
"15973050","15978430"," I'm going to be looking for some kind of put spread and then I'll get more aggressive with puts"

"16125280","16126400"," He's finally shut his mouth."
"16157320","16159920"," Yeah, if I had to guess, it's not good."
"16162540","16163360"," So what do you got?"
"16163500","16164640"," So give me your take and chat. "

"16175360","16178680"," Do you think that people just haven't heard the speech yet?"
"16178680","16182620"," Do you think that it hasn't been consumed by everyone at this point?"
"16185880","16190560"," My one question on my one or not concerned, I wouldn't say. "
"16191040","16192480"," My one thought on."
"16198630","16199650"," My one thought."
"16199650","16206190"," My one thought on that speech is that it hasn't been consumed by mass media at this point. "

"16486060","16488560"," This is my only concern here. "
"16489119","16490439"," So just timing-wise."
"16491419","16492200"," Let me see."
"16492560","16493640"," We filled the gap this morning. "
"16494279","16496020"," February season last one is 465."
"16496400","16498259"," We're definitely filling course in the gap with 465."
"16499000","16500080"," No time frame given. "
"16500360","16501680"," People do not want to digest it."
"16504080","16508439"," Guys, I don't think that big of a deal not until somebody actually happens like in May."
"16509080","16513439"," It seems like, OK, so Josh makes a good point here, but I want to talk about this is important,"
"16513660","16513880"," OK?"
"16514439","16516460"," It doesn't matter if they do it or don't do it. "
"16516900","16519380"," Before it happens, the market will tend to price things in."
"16519460","16525640"," The only thing that I could say for the bulls right now is that the banks don't like unknown news"
"16525640","16530880"," so they could rip it higher, but only to sell it down to price in 50 basis points."
"16531240","16535040"," To be aware of that, they want to be positioned for that move. "
"16536560","16540500"," I'm going to assume that they weren't ready for the for the speech today."
"16542140","16545860"," I think he said what we all wanted him to say in the 16th and the price move that we"
"16545860","16546619"," expected on Friday."
"16547040","16548000"," I agree with that too. "
"16548520","16550720"," I'm a bull and I still want to hear something like that."
"16550759","16553220"," We've heard seven hikes to 0.25% percent."
"16553880","16558140"," Yeah, 0.25 and 0.50 is a whole different ballgame. "
"16559680","16560560"," I agree with that."
"16561240","16562140"," Don't have a 150."
"16562380","16562759"," Oh, come on. "
"16562900","16563220"," Look at them."
"16563279","16563919"," Green bar it."
"16564099","16564259"," Nope. "
"16564480","16565680"," We're not green barring it."
"16566180","16569140"," All they're doing is closing short positions."
"16569880","16575560"," I think that even if we think it's unlikely that we happen, the market still has to price in the"
"16575560","16576580"," 10% chance we have it. "
"16576779","16578200"," Yeah, so we don't have a price in right now."
"16578520","16580400"," We know that it's not priced in."
"16581500","16582779"," It's not priced in. "
"16583300","16584300"," It is not priced in."
"16584360","16587460"," The ENN shares up 37% for the session."
"16587460","16591099"," Moving near the 250 level, seeing some increased volume. "
"16591759","16592759"," Not seeing any news there."
"16593439","16596040"," Now moving above that 250 level."
"16597540","16600680"," Charlie Echo, November, November, C-E-N-N-N. "
"16600680","16601520"," I've been projected so far."
"16601759","16608500"," She was liquidity pair 4512 with the bottom 4-4-1-2 today."
"16610960","16614000"," Is this a new updated version of Trade the News cap?"
"16614340","16616720"," This is Ben Zinga. "
"16617660","16621300"," Should roll over, but they are doing the green bar pumping about stuff."
"16621560","16623060"," We're in a trend lane we drew earlier."
"16623860","16625040"," Nice flag in XLE. "
"16625580","16626380"," I'll take a look at XLE."
"16628520","16629340"," There's some needs."
"16629580","16630759"," It was never seven. "
"16630759","16636520"," You holding sticker, N-U- It's 0.25. No, it's down five and a half percent."
"16636700","16640640"," Seeing some volume to the downside here, November uniform, N-U."
"16641400","16645060"," So it's not a question of, so we're going to be clear here. "
"16645099","16651220"," It's not a question of that it was definitely going to be 7.25 rate hikes."
"16651619","16653200"," It's that we priced that in."
"16653840","16657480"," Where that started was Jamie Diamond from JPM. "
"16660040","16668480"," The three major banks disagreed on the number of rate hikes and the BPS per rate hike."
"16669119","16677040"," And he eventually came back to say, no, he eventually came back to say, no, you're wrong."
"16677919","16685200"," This is what he came back to say. "
"16687040","16691880"," He came back to say, it's going to be 7 at 2-5 BPS."
"16692800","16695020"," And there was disagreement amongst the banks."
"16696099","16699779"," And then everyone eventually came in line with him. "
"16699779","16704500"," And the market eventually priced in what JPM, I think it was JPM."
"16704759","16706180"," I got to be wrong on exactly what it was."
"16706619","16707160"," I might have been GS. "
"16707419","16708080"," I'm not exactly sure."
"16708180","16714980"," But whoever came up with that seven rate hikes at 25 BPS, they eventually priced that into the"
"16714980","16715320"," market."
"16716000","16723580"," And so if you've got, you can't tell me now from now into next FOMC that that doesn't put a"
"16723580","16729560"," top on our market because you know that there are other people out there right in banks that are"
"16729560","16731720"," going to say to you, well, we have to price this in now. "
"16731960","16733800"," We already know that it's not priced in."
"16734279","16738480"," So we know that we're going to get there at some point, whether it's now, whether it's later,"
"16738939","16744460"," whether it's, I don't know, then, you know, a month or so, it doesn't really matter."
"16744740","16748860"," So I mean, let's do something I'm missing in that speech today, which could be, I could have"
"16748860","16751960"," listened to that speech and missed some key points in that speech. "
"16752300","16758400"," That speech could also be turned around by, by, by media or banks that are not positioned"
"16758400","16758840"," correctly."
"16759099","16765000"," You could also see us, you could also see us trade higher until they can be positioned where they"
"16765000","16768020"," want to be positioned to price it in."
"16768340","16769119"," But let's be clear. "
"16770000","16779380"," If we haven't priced in 25 to 50 BPS, that pricing in, right, that pricing in was at 418 to"
"16779380","16782160"," 25 BPS."
"16782780","16784260"," So let's be clear on that."
"16785140","16786900"," Now, I want to be long this market. "
"16788040","16789400"," I want to see the market go up."
"16791980","16800940"," But I think you got a ceiling just in the volatility that will arise, whether because there was no"
"16800940","16806260"," question really was there, even though he had said, yeah, we could raise it more between now or at"
"16806260","16808040"," the next FOMC to 50 BPS."
"16808520","16810240"," He didn't say what he said today. "
"16811440","16813280"," He was, he was quite a hawkish today."
"16813460","16814540"," Have you my wrong in this?"
"16814720","16821080"," Did I hear the wrong and our standard therapeutics shares continuing higher here, moving back above"
"16821080","16823620"," the seven dollar level had dropped down in the last hour."
"16823800","16834180"," So, but seeing some volume to the upside, it shares up 350% for Nancy Romeo, Sandy Nancy, and"
"16834180","16834600"," RSN. "
"16835340","16841400"," I'm always, I'm always wondering like, like, so like when you start, like, I'm always wondering"
"16841400","16849040"," where the argument comes from, because I'm like, okay, so what would have been a bullish or a"
"16849040","16853040"," neutral statement in this speech, right?"
"16853840","16856780"," And does that, would that have matched what he said today?"
"16857600","16860260"," And so far, my answer is no, right?"
"16861180","16864480"," He didn't, that was not the same speech that he gave on the FOMC."
"16864700","16865500"," We know that for sure."
"16866160","16870200"," And that speech wasn't in any way, in my view, bullish. "
"16871320","16881300"," So, any argument that we had, the bullish argument was we've priced in 25 VPS at 7.7 points this"
"16881300","16881580"," year."
"16882020","16883000"," That's what we priced in."
"16883440","16889000"," And unless something changes, because remember, even in this, in this conversation, it was price"
"16889000","16894860"," controls, which we know is bullshit, and also price controls. "
"16895540","16902000"," And then that he feels as though inflation is, he didn't say transitory, but he said inflation and"
"16902000","16905820"," shortages will let loose once the Ukraine bullshits over."
"16906180","16911800"," And once the end of the year ends, remember, he said nine months, he was specific and said we"
"16911800","16915020"," expect inflation to start to go down in nine months."
"16915620","16922100"," And so you're saying, okay, I see where he's coming from saying 25 VPS, seven meetings, rolling"
"16922100","16925980"," into next year, gives him a little bit of buffer, but basically nine months till this is over. "
"16926280","16929940"," And now he's changing his tune to, well, we don't know if that war is ending."
"16931100","16933140"," Probably something with China that he's not saying."
"16933720","16939340"," And we know that inflation is going away and shortages aren't going to go away now at this point"
"16939340","16942900"," into in the next nine months, right?"
"16942980","16944320"," Because we only got nine months left, right?"
"16944520","16946620"," For this ship to take place next January. "
"16947180","16953500"," So if they're going to say, well, if we start to project that this will, this will last longer than"
"16953500","16957100"," next year, then they have to get more aggressive."
"16958060","16959940"," And that's probably what they're doing."
"16960920","16968140"," So I would be wary, if I was able, I would be looking for a test of 430, I'll be"
"16968140","16968700"," honest with you. "
"16969720","16972800"," We could still trade higher, we could trade a 446 again."
"16974040","16977520"," But I guarantee, I guarantee you that people are going to be getting short of here."
"16978580","16979080"," Guarantee it. "
"16981660","16982980"," The news guy sucks."
"16985420","16986700"," I'm getting rid of him today."
"16987220","16990980"," So they, what happened was, I'll tell you guys, show you guys what's happening. "
"16991640","16995300"," So the, if you guys look in this chat box over here, right?"
"16996860","17000280"," Their news, the regular news guy is down today."
"17002480","17010240"," It's regular news guy is, it said, in the comments over here, they're saying that Charlie is down"
"17010240","17010640"," today."
"17011980","17014600"," So you know, we're not listening to Charlie today. "
"17014760","17017380"," So we're going to get traded the news tomorrow."
"17017580","17019420"," And I'm going to cancel this shit tomorrow."
"17020360","17027140"," I think I've spent like, I think this week I've spent like six or seven hundred dollars trying out"
"17027140","17034320"," new news services and none of them covered it that is good as trade the news, not a single one"
"17034320","17034540"," of them. "
"17035480","17042060"," I should do a video and shit on every single one of these take a giant shit on every single"
"17042060","17045120"," one of these news squawks."
"17045680","17050940"," The only one I should do is just buy a fucking Bloomberg terminal and start, start, start, start"
"17050940","17055640"," doing a news squawk and charge like 50 bucks to everybody."
"17057740","17058460"," That's all we'll do. "
"17058580","17062620"," We'll just read the news to you as it comes in before, before anyone else gets it."
"17065220","17067140"," We'll call it cap trades the news."
"17068140","17069560"," The cap tells the news. "
"17070660","17071120"," Captain's log."
"17071660","17072540"," That's what we call it, right?"
"17072840","17073200"," Captain's log."
"17075000","17079960"," We'll do a service who will be better than all of them because they all kind of suck. "
"17081140","17087800"," I don't think I don't think do do you not like don't get me wrong."
"17088780","17090980"," I don't think it's not your bad."
"17091280","17095100"," And I think I'm not I'm not impressed at all with losing it today. "
"17096400","17102000"," Do not I don't get a minute that raising weight is going to stop a recession ability to track"
"17102000","17105900"," shipments from other services that according to nine to five Google."
"17106400","17112820"," I don't think for a minute that a Fox drive Delta X ray FDX that BPA or that that would"
"17112820","17115060"," be that I don't think for a minute the Fed has any control."
"17116800","17119380"," But I do care about its impact on the market. "
"17119640","17122000"," And that is that is concerned."
"17122360","17126200"," I could care shit a less about if it really helps the economy or not."
"17126340","17148040"," What I care about is the impact on the market and the impact on the market is going to"
"17149600","17158060"," be that we're going to trade down unless unless I'm I missed"
"17158060","17160500"," something. "
"17160540","17195300"," I had to have a So"
"17195300","17203160"," spied it's still down point three one I don't know scotch that point five three percent the implied"
"17203160","17211700"," move today was point eight percent it's a one fifty three."
"17211800","17218660"," I'm going to take a break from two p.m. until three p.m. I'll be back for the power"
"17218660","17219480"," hour."
"17219800","17221380"," We are trading higher currently on the spy. "
"17222840","17227880"," You've got my my targets for taking on some short positions."
"17230820","17232780"," My price targets are here."
"17232960","17234000"," I'll show you guys one more time. "
"17234700","17241820"," Four and we'll be looking to know maybe next time I'll be looking for reversal here at this four"
"17241820","17246140"," forty three fifty two ninety eight if we can get up that I hope we can."
"17246580","17252820"," I'm going to look to take a break and come back for reversal here and put some put spreads and"
"17252820","17257140"," then if we even get this high here if we I don't think we can get this high but if"
"17257140","17262380"," we can get this high I'll take some zero dates into the bell and I'll probably take some weekly"
"17262380","17267360"," puts up here as well and I'm going to be hoping and hoping I can get some cheap pricing up"
"17267360","17276160"," here on some form of put spread and I'll date some of the put spreads in the money for this"
"17276160","17284200"," Friday and then I'll also add some out for the next FOMC meeting in the money as well."
"17286780","17289460"," I'm just waiting to see if we can trade this higher here. "
"17290360","17297320"," You guys get these levels four forty five fifty four forty six maybe if it gets as high as four"
"17297320","17303620"," forty six maybe a quick little bump higher and then we grab it and then somewhere in this this zone"
"17303620","17308600"," here this four forty three ninety eight I might even throw some I might even throw some deep"
"17308600","17310540"," outside the money put spreads on."
"17311060","17315980"," I think I might throw some three nineties on believe it or not or a spread wide to three ninety"
"17315980","17325440"," maybe to the next FOMC meeting I might throw something on like three it's weird I haven't even"
"17325440","17335420"," looked right now we can look right now how because it goes it gets lower every day as time goes"
"17335420","17345380"," forward so what would be like well I can't see shit but three ninety"
"17345380","17354820"," two three ninety eight call it four hundred call it four hundred for a rollover uh"
"17354820","17361680"," unless some change the only thing that would change my view on this would be some positive headline"
"17361680","17370820"," news or possibly if the news interprets the speech today differently so I'm going to take an hour"
"17370820","17379320"," break I'm going to read some articles I want to see what the news view point is on this happening"
"17379320","17387140"," and I'll come back with a definitive answer in the next hour at three by three p.m. I'll know"
"17387140","17391900"," at least what I think is going to happen if we're going to if we're going to try to trade"
"17391900","17398220"," this down to four hundred three ninety somewhere down in here in the coming month and surely I"
"17398220","17403880"," would think as we come into FOMC if you don't test this now we'll test this heading in a couple"
"17403880","17410560"," weeks before FOMC the next FOMC meeting just based on the volatility you know the there might be"
"17410560","17418020"," some good volatility trades in here as well some good VIX trades heading into the next FOMC meeting"
"17419600","17425000"," uh buying the VIX believe it or not down here at 24 75 so I'm going to take a break"
"17425000","17437450"," here it's a 157 p.m. I will be back at 3 p.m. yeah"
"17437450","17441050"," I promise all of you out there yeah I don't give a fuck what happened you know it's funny we"
"17441050","17446450"," just talked about this earlier right we said that we weren't going up to 447 we did we said we"
"17446450","17451350"," weren't going enough down to 440 and we did I don't know how close you need to get to where"
"17451350","17458050"," we're going to be today so my next prediction for you is that we're going to trade higher fail and"
"17458050","17464130"," you're going to see people position to take this market lower unless unless someone out there"
"17464130","17470550"," unless there's some news out there that I don't know about or I'm misinterpreting that that um that"
"17470550","17476270"," speech or maybe sometimes they'll turn news around on itself I saw that this weekend with housing"
"17476270","17482190"," prices they're trying to turn that shit around so in my view we roll this market over we're going"
"17482190","17488350"," to definitely definitely the first stop is going to be retest or our first stop is going to be"
"17488350","17495190"," testing 430 and seeing if we need to go lower or not without a doubt even if we don't trade"
"17495190","17500510"," 390 we're going to go down there and see if this is where we're supposed to be we're going to"
"17500510","17506390"," at least probe it and find out which way we're headed I promise you now where I couldn't promise"

"20696520","20702940"," 470 cold fucking soon buy like 30 million dollars worth of them and you see them as the retail"

"20726860","20735160"," towards that price uh let's say it hits like 460 and but there's so far outside of money that I'm"
"20735160","20740040"," collecting them at like 300 or 500 or something if the market continues in that way I can hold on"
"20740040","20744780"," to them with more buyers step in a second third fourth round of buyers step in I keep holding that"
"20744780","20751220"," bag and then eventually hand it off to some you know top buyer but if those buyers don't step in"
"20751220","20757640"," let's say about 300 percent that puts us like 460 let's say 450 I'm going to end up selling out"
"20757640","20763780"," of those calls to you right or the second round or third round of bag holder and once no one"
"20763780","20768100"," thinks they can fill those bags up any longer we don't go any higher so that's a big misconception"
"20768100","20774240"," everybody thinks well if I trade 470s right now we'll go to 470 or going to 470 no you need"
"20774240","20781860"," second third fourth round of buyers to actually get us to that 470 now that could be two two kinds"
"20781860","20788640"," of buyer it could be a buyer that buys higher than 480 or it could be three four five rounds"
"20788640","20796000"," of buying 470s right this low we're at right now 445 right one round takes us to 450 another round"
"20796000","20800480"," takes the 460 and that last round let's say takes us to 470 and I get the I get the"
"20800480","20808160"," full realization but you need rounds and rounds and rounds of buyers to step in right now we're"
"20808160","20815860"," still not seeing that call expansion in the market where we can get higher than a certain price so"
"20815860","20825620"," it doesn't matter if I want the market to go up higher than our two"
"20825620","20832900"," 450 unless you have real money by us deputy national security advisor new burger says the this is"

"21472260","21478880"," at the same time that are are definitely arguable against what it's somebody had to say but i think"
"21478880","21485520"," he says that for the cameras usually so our trading slightly closer to that 440 tag seems to be"
"21485520","21494140"," more firm buyers down below at 438 looks like this this level is firming up from from from prior"
"21494140","21501660"," we'll see if we break this 440 and i'm not totally bearish if we break 440 and then touch 438"
"21501660","21510200"," let's say we trade down and bounce off and and maintain 440 then we remain bullish if we break"
"21510200","21518420"," through 440 and then uh don't close above 440 that is a negative against the rest of the week being"
"21518420","21525120"," green and so we'll see how we end this day here we definitely don't want to uh trade a new"
"21525120","21531340"," low and we definitely don't want to close on a new on a lower high so we've got two issues"

"21739300","21743820"," to be holding their value a little bit better than calls at this point seems like there are a lot"
"21743820","21761980"," of people loading up on puts still some juice on the put side he"
"21761980","21768600"," mentioned the economy is very very strong one more very very last week uh huh i'll bet gdb is down"

"21804840","21815970"," was a part of getting all those guys in trouble i think they"
"21815970","21820450"," found out that bowstick was long and then he was like oh i'll never do that again it was like"

"21900960","21931970"," that's fucking wild i"
"21931970","21941890"," wonder if they pin it right into the bell and just leave it neutral on the day he spoke this"
"21941890","21954050"," morning you think boss dick yeah i"
"21954050","21969680"," wasn't paying attention to it real quick yeah"

"21974400","21977680"," they're trying to do is they're just trying to they're trying to kill puts now so they're just"
"21977680","21985800"," going to murder the puts murder the calls and close the day flat i don't see i don't see them"
"21985800","21991120"," at this point uh trying to print either side i think they're gonna i think they're gonna close the"
"21991120","21996620"," flat but they hit both both targets for the the day too right they hit 447 above they hit 440"
"21996620","22003880"," below uh you really can't ask for too much more off the day would it wouldn't actually surprise me"
"22003880","22014540"," to see a close flat here due to the higher and lower range getting tagged into the bell so"
"22014540","22022000"," that might make tomorrow a trend day so hopefully i can get this higher into the bell if we can"
"22022000","22033200"," i want to take some puts yeah"
"22033200","22042800"," and there's there's 80,000 just a heads up the the algos are sitting on uh"

"22052340","22062280"," so they'll probably squeeze those or juice them into the bell and then we'll all enter some towards"
"22062280","22072120"," close but there are there are some algos on the short side of the equation heading into"
"22072120","22086390"," the just heads up on that calls coming in on bp april 29th 30c it's"

"22251100","22259440"," you get a close below this 440 it's not looking good for tomorrow so it's all a matter of timing"
"22259440","22264420"," right it's all a matter of waiting you don't want to be trading here taking a trade right here i"
"22264420","22269360"," don't want to take a trade right there at all so i want to take a trade if we if"

"22313960","22318380"," vacuuming them all up they just came through and just wiped out all the puts and they came through"
"22318380","22354160"," and wiped out all the calls so they're all pretty much worthless uh going into the bell cyrn"
"22354160","22360680"," shares continuing higher here with about 40 minutes left in the trading session shares above the"

"22506820","22511460"," 475 level in the Aromio, November, Tango, IRNT."
"22560830","22562170"," Let's see if I can get an answer on this. "
"22562170","22583440"," Yes, this is"
"22583440","22587000"," not someone saying that there was no news to talk about today."
"22588600","22591460"," It's kind of a shit news squawk then."
"22591680","22592420"," I'm not really impressed. "
"22608420","22613460"," So if that's the case, if some people are saying earlier that part of the news squawk was down,"
"22617680","22621020"," everyone, so one response was, no, that's the normal news squawk."
"22621160","22622300"," It just wasn't any news today."
"22668520","22669560"," That sucks. "
"22669880","22678180"," It's weird, too, because this cost me, I think, $177 to sign up for."
"22680000","22687260"," And then the other word thing is the, I was told that their text news is even better."
"22691480","22693980"," And I've been reading their news all day long today. "
"22694100","22697640"," It's been fucking an hour late on everything."
"22700120","22701000"," It's kind of crazy."
"22724370","22727310"," So I can't recommend Ben Zinga. "
"22728550","22733050"," Not only cannot not recommend Ben Zinga, but their news is slower than Twitter."
"22742720","22746280"," So if you're ever considering using Ben Zinga, I don't know what else will be worth."
"22750280","22754620"," I've scrolled through some of their other movers and scanner and signals. "
"22754620","22760480"," I have scrolled through some of this stuff over here, like ideas and insiders and calendar and"
"22760480","22761660"," watch list movers."
"22762600","22764140"," All everything is late."
"22764560","22768440"," Everything that they announced today I've gone into check and it's already moved. "
"22768600","22774560"," I guess it'll be good for shorting, but you can figure that out without paying $200 a month for it."
"22775760","22777020"," This is ideas."
"22778560","22783600"," I mean, look at this. "
"22783780","22790980"," This is Apple users experience, experience outages like 3 17 p.m. It's like two hours late."
"22792780","22802580"," There's no reason to like anybody to tell you this"
"22802580","22802820"," shit."
"22803380","22811400"," And this squawk has to it's got a equity squawk and options squawk and spend it's been nothing but"
"22815740","22817040"," shit to be quite frank. "
"22821560","22822940"," So don't ever buy Ben Zinga."
"22824680","22825520"," That's why I review it."
"22825660","22827200"," It's the second time I bought it once. "
"22827640","22835920"," I bought it once like a week or two ago and then I canceled it and then I bought it"
"22835920","22837860"," again because I was like, now I'll give it a chance."
"22840460","22842260"," So I'm not impressed at all."
"22850300","22853460"," Anything that they could be anything that they could be finding out here I could find out somewhere"
"22853460","22853780"," else. "
"22855780","22865240"," And what's really shocking is the squawk hasn't talked about anything inside of anything market"
"22865240","22865640"," moving."
"22866320","22870000"," You just pump it dumps after after the pump's already been made."
"22877410","22882370"," So I'm going to give it a hard pass on on actionable news and they're known for news. "
"22882930","22884190"," I looked them up again."
"22884410","22891870"," I did a I did a like who does the best news squawk and they came in pretty much equal"
"22891870","22898330"," to for number two to the best out there."
"22898330","22901070"," There's no way they're the best out there and not even for the price hundreds. "
"22901070","22905310"," I think it was a hundred and seventy seven dollars or something like that for the entry level news"
"22905310","22908070"," squad for the pro the pro version."
"22909190","22912630"," It was kind of a joke and there's no delay."
"22912630","22913590"," It's a real time. "
"22930210","22931630"," Let's see what you guys are saying here."
"22932190","22933250"," Fake oil pump trade."
"22934030","22938790"," It's not making a short term hidden shoulders raising rates without effects in elastic goods. "
"22939230","22940910"," Can you give us levels for USO?"
"22941330","22942510"," Yeah, I'll do USO right now."
"22943270","22944450"," You guys USO."
"22945190","22946150"," Sorry, I was looking up. "
"22946390","22948270"," I was looking up a corner earlier."
"22956720","22961160"," With that load up spy trading back to VWAP right now still no movement."
"22962260","22964020"," Still just kind of nothing on the spy. "
"22964400","22966720"," This is the spy right here still still kind of nothing."
"22967200","22971160"," I really want to see a trade higher still waiting on a trade higher on spy."
"22972900","22973880"," Not going to get it. "
"22973900","22975840"," It doesn't look like."
"22976480","22979860"," USO is kind of a tough one to get levels on but we can look at them."
"22981100","22990740"," Here's your VWAP 7930 79 78 70 78 50 76"
"22990740","22993500"," lots of buyers 77 some pretty big buyers. "
"22995240","22997520"," We have more buyers than sellers right now."
"22997560","22999140"," That's positive for oil."
"23004180","23005860"," USO lots of sellers above. "
"23010550","23012590"," Let's look at a chart for USO."
"23015170","23018270"," It's another one of those tickers that it's all about timing."
"23018710","23020570"," Do you want to know if you should buy USO at this moment?"
"23020750","23021470"," Probably not. "
"23024490","23026750"," Let's look at it in a more granular level."
"23033230","23036510"," Look at USO real quick as a ticker."
"23036670","23043590"," USO trades a lot like small component of not this component of spy but you're looking for huge"
"23043590","23044030"," moves. "
"23044330","23046650"," Whenever you see a huge move you buy it right."
"23046990","23049410"," If you get a huge move in any direction you sell it right."
"23050010","23051110"," It's pretty common. "
"23051450","23055650"," A lot of trading happens in the overnight in tickers like this."
"23056870","23061070"," Commodity tickers and also small components of spy."
"23061990","23063010"," You'll see these moves. "
"23063370","23068350"," So when you see a move like this, you see a steady move and another move higher like this."
"23068690","23070230"," Do I think it can gap up tomorrow?"
"23071110","23074490"," That's possible but the trade here is probably a short."
"23075950","23078510"," Well, there could be a nice gap above. "
"23078770","23080550"," Again, maybe you're looking for 85."
"23081550","23083570"," A lot of traffic in here to 82 though."
"23084570","23086890"," There's a lot of sellers here on 82. "
"23089010","23090810"," So maybe let's see here."
"23092210","23102790"," The other thing you'll be looking for is something like this."
"23105210","23107290"," And this is going to be much lower actually. "
"23109290","23111570"," Usually you see some kind of a move like this, right?"
"23111690","23112370"," You get slightly higher."
"23112590","23115810"," You get almost to where these sellers are trapped up here."
"23116130","23117630"," Because you got sellers trapped up here. "
"23119170","23126270"," And all they're saying is, please let me just stay in long enough until I get a, until I can"
"23126270","23127430"," get out of my trade, right?"
"23127610","23129850"," My long that I'm stuck in this 87, 83."
"23130550","23139690"," So I think we get much higher than, so I think we get much higher than"
"23139690","23142230"," 79, 43 or 80."
"23142990","23143550"," Probably not. "
"23144210","23145950"," Probably anywhere from here to 82."
"23147390","23152910"," And what we'll wind up doing is getting a rejection somewhere in here between between 80 and 82."
"23160650","23161270"," That's what I think that we get. "
"23161270","23166030"," And then another move lower, even if we expect all to go higher with, with bad news out there."
"23171560","23172740"," Sweet, I'll take it later."
"23173760","23174740"," The delivery guy. "
"23175560","23175840"," Thanks."
"23177640","23178400"," So oil."
"23179740","23185160"," If you're in, if you're in stock, I would say you could take it long, but I don't think that"
"23185160","23187320"," you can take it long into. "
"23189080","23194420"," And then you take it long into, um, into options."
"23195220","23199660"," Oh, there are a lot of calls out there for you for olive oil right now, like all olive oil,"
"23200040","23201020"," all of oil."
"23207450","23209410"," Just don't get caught in the wrong side of that trade. "
"23209610","23210330"," I guess would be the point."
"23213870","23215190"," Spy's still kind of fucking around."
"23217610","23220370"," Top, top, right?"
"23220370","23223150"," One top, another top, another top, another top. "
"23225670","23227270"," I'm still flat at the moment."
"23227470","23228430"," I'm not in a trade."
"23229590","23234470"," And I don't like this setup for bullish. "
"23236170","23238950"," And I don't like the setup for bearish either."
"23239370","23243450"," We should get a move, but I don't like that I prefer the trade."
"23245450","23255440"," Yeah, I still see, I still see more of this. "
"23256480","23258760"," Still, still see more of the sideways trade."
"23262180","23263340"," Don't see it."
"23263480","23265380"," If anything, I see the trade down. "
"23265980","23267940"," My bias is down here."
"23268680","23269580"," Sideways and down."
"23270140","23270880"," That's my bias. "
"23272160","23275020"," If I had to give you guys up, I know you guys like to see, you guys like to hear"
"23275020","23275480"," my biases."
"23276420","23278240"," I'm not always right, but I'm what right."
"23278240","23280320"," 70 to 80% of the time. "
"23280980","23285200"," So that's my bias is neutral to down."
"23287620","23293980"," Until we find the commitment from bulls to make the next leg higher."
"23295360","23300060"," And I'm not seeing that commitment from bulls to make to take the next leg higher. "
"23300200","23301620"," I'm not seeing it in the flow."
"23302260","23303120"," I'm seeing some good flow."
"23303240","23306420"," I'm seeing weaklies, but everything's in the money. "
"23306420","23308220"," Like it can't be in the money."
"23308460","23315160"," You have to see, you have to see, not that you should be taking the out of the money calls,"
"23316280","23318120"," but you know, do you know what I'm seeing right now?"
"23318300","23320200"," Like I'm seeing, I'm seeing calls on queues."
"23321220","23324680"," QQQ, March 21st, 348 C."
"23325020","23328360"," So some guys taking calls right here. "
"23329860","23331280"," And the money call, right?"
"23331760","23333620"," So you need to see calls higher."
"23333620","23336580"," You need to see people looking for 360, 370."
"23336960","23341820"," And until you see that, you're in the money calls for March 25th, are never going to fucking print. "
"23342420","23343940"," You'll fucking burn this market sideways."
"23344380","23348820"," If nobody's buying puts here and everything's in the money, it just ain't going to, it ain't going"
"23348820","23349120"," to print."
"23349800","23356460"," I promise you, they're just going to murder this shit into, um, into, into Friday, or even trade"
"23356460","23358300"," down if people just stop buying calls. "
"23358560","23364140"," Like if you just stop buying in the money calls and the puts just still hang out there, that'll be"
"23364140","23364580"," a magnet."
"23364920","23366640"," We'll have that magnet going down."
"23370080","23370860"," High, right?"
"23371260","23372940"," Uh, lower high, lower low. "
"23374400","23377600"," Uh, the only positive for bulls here is that we're not closing on a low."
"23378440","23383680"," It's the only, only positive on this chart for today, is that we didn't make a new low on the"
"23383680","23386100"," close, but this isn't healthy down here either."
"23388900","23390500"," This more it looks more like short covering. "
"23391040","23394460"," It looks more like, you know, I covered short, I took a short here, right?"
"23394560","23398660"," I took a short here again, and I'm looking for a better price to take short one more time."
"23399680","23401320"," That's all it looks like to me at this moment."
"23403640","23405140"," That's all I can say about it. "
"23405680","23409860"," Yeah, one right there, one right there, and then the bears are going to, and I'm hoping that we"
"23409860","23410600"," trade higher again."
"23410980","23413740"," So, you know, if we trade higher one more time, we're going to take another short."
"23415940","23417320"," And when do I get bullish?"
"23418020","23422700"," Uh, when we find support, I want to see like a slam higher. "
"23423380","23425200"," I want to see a nice fat reversal."
"23426080","23431160"," I want to see a hell, no, we're not going down there, and then I'll take a long for this"
"23431160","23431620"," trade up."
"23444110","23445950"," So, go up here and see what you guys are saying. "
"23451870","23456110"," See, you guys are saying in the chat, we still have 23 minutes."
"23457050","23458110"," Lower, lower, lower, lower."
"23458970","23460210"," No, no pump coming in. "
"23460830","23461390"," I'm missing stuff."
"23461810","23465110"," Paul, I missed whatever you, I saw the question marks, Paul, but I, I missed whatever you asked,"
"23465310","23465370"," bro."
"23465910","23467090"," So, ask the question again. "
"23471790","23474950"," Uh, nice, thanks, Janice."
"23476350","23478750"," HYG is down, bend over."
"23479750","23482950"," A fav, EFO edge, and discord, and free, but you have to read. "
"23483910","23485730"," Zach, the trade, the news, dude, you had before."
"23486910","23491170"," Uh, Oh, Sean, olive oil."
"23493390","23494270"," Extra virgin. "
"23495310","23497850"," I didn't know it was a pretty weak Greece and Spain increase."
"23497850","23500510"," I'll put up olive oil, green to red day."
"23500870","23505870"," If we finished that way, as embarrassed after a rally, talking about olive oil, because it said"
"23505870","23506410"," olive oil. "
"23506690","23507050"," Exactly."
"23507330","23508330"," Josh caught it."
"23508730","23510070"," A couple of you guys caught it out there. "
"23514560","23523740"," Yeah, I mean, even, um, I'll be, I mean, even, even, even, uh, fucking, even, uh, let's just, it's"
"23523740","23525740"," not, it's not rocket science here, right?"
"23525940","23527180"," This isn't rocket science stuff."
"23527180","23527240"," Yeah."
"23527660","23530340"," Like we're just looking at pretty simple stuff today, right?"
"23533780","23537580"," Um, you know, hold on here. "
"23542460","23550390"," You know, just look at the VIX, right?"
"23550590","23551710"," Trading down higher, right?"
"23551950","23552590"," Trading down."
"23553810","23557730"," Start, VIX is starting to get squeezed in here, right?"
"23557910","23559530"," It's starting to push down on the VIX."
"23560530","23567970"," The VIX recovered from 22.99. I don't know what you expect VIX to go to or how low you"
"23567970","23568770"," expect it to go. "
"23569050","23573770"," I don't, I don't think anyone's expecting the VIX below somewhere in here."
"23573970","23580190"," You know, there's, I don't think the VIX is expected to go, you know, any lower than this area"
"23580190","23580470"," here."
"23580510","23582270"," So what do you have?"
"23582470","23587210"," One quick move down where you, I guess we squeeze higher to 450 and then you get a rocket chip"
"23587210","23587430"," up. "
"23587650","23588130"," I don't know."
"23589110","23592450"," Uh, not the best place to be trading at the moment."
"23592450","23593230"," Right here. "
"23593390","23597690"," This right here is looking bullish for a squeeze actually higher."
"23599050","23602250"," That would give us that 435, right?"
"23602650","23608090"," And you'd say no to it and then we'd make a trade down here and you would get your 450."
"23608810","23610950"," That makes some sense to me. "
"23613570","23616470"," Um, but other than that, I'm not seeing it."
"23624660","23626660"," Um, like I see, I see that trade."
"23628620","23634420"," Uh, you're, but what you're saying is that we're going to go, we're going to gap up tomorrow, I"
"23634420","23634580"," guess. "
"23635100","23636420"," And then we, that we would sell off."
"23636720","23637020"," I don't know."
"23637860","23639700"," I guess that, that's the opposite of that trade. "
"23640060","23640920"," When that would make sense too."
"23641060","23644360"," We, we just kind of gap down and we get sub $20."
"23645300","23647840"," Um, do we need news to go sub $20?"
"23647840","23649280"," Uh, probably. "
"23650340","23652900"," So I'm going to give it, I'm going to give the edge to the bears right now."
"23653360","23656880"," If I had to give edge to anyone, I'm going to give edge to the bears."
"23661020","23665600"," And I'm going to say that we roll over our trade sideways and down. "
"23666320","23668940"," Uh, the next day or two, my edge is on the bears."
"23673280","23677400"," I'm going to give it 60% bears and 40% bulls at this point."
"23686420","23688420"," You want wheat to fucking explode again. "
"23689540","23690700"," So I get back and wheat."
"23690960","23692880"," I didn't even, I didn't even think about getting back in it."
"23695320","23697180"," It did well today off the bell. "
"23698580","23700760"," Oh yeah, it looks, it looks strong, doesn't it?"
"23701760","23703900"," Dude, it looks like it could explode in the overnight."
"23705220","23707860"," Wheat looks like it's ready to fucking fit to a face ripper."
"23709840","23711000"," Wheat looks strong. "
"23711000","23712380"," Strong, strong."
"23713660","23715080"," We, we looks really strong."
"23717620","23721340"," There's been a shit ton of buyers last three days on wheat. "
"23722480","23723940"," Shit ton of buyers on wheat."
"23724940","23726780"," I like the wheat trades Josh."
"23728880","23730660"," I think they're not telling us something. "
"23730800","23735220"," I think that if I had to guess there's some bad news coming that we don't know about."
"23735740","23738460"," That they tried to brush that J-Pouch it into the carpet today."
"23739440","23740680"," And they're waiting to fuck you. "
"23742680","23745380"," I don't like that there isn't much reaction on the internet."
"23745680","23746660"," Like that, that's social media."
"23747320","23749560"," But the news, there isn't quite much reaction about it. "
"23750440","23751140"," I don't like that."
"23751240","23752160"," It'd be the positive or negative."
"23762610","23765670"," If we could trade up, I would love it if we traded up the 4-4-7 again. "
"23766090","23766690"," Just trade it up there."
"23766690","23768230"," Just bring it to the top for me."
"23769310","23770410"," Just run it up. "
"23777720","23779100"," Yeah dude, fucking wheat dude."
"23779240","23780760"," I just looked at the last three days on wheat."
"23781120","23783500"," Fucking, they've been pouring into wheat the past three fucking days. "
"23787120","23788120"," There's a million speakers."
"23788720","23791460"," Yeah, we got Bostick at 4."
"23792000","23796340"," That'll be interesting to see what his, if he just, if he just gets on the mic and he's like,"
"23796860","23798520"," the market is doomed."
"23813130","23817370"," The US could out, out, out, grow wheat day in, day out. "
"23817510","23818250"," They just don't."
"23819290","23820710"," They don't make enough money off it."
"23823790","23827030"," It can take five minutes for the US to grow enough wheat to feed all of us. "
"23828050","23829110"," We just don't."
"23829410","23829870"," We get it cheaper."
"23832270","23836650"," My family, I'm telling you, like my family, they have to switch crops all the time. "
"23837330","23838670"," They're the last person to know."
"23839150","23840970"," They have to switch animals."
"23841670","23843390"," They're always the last person to know. "
"23846890","23851450"," If you, all you'd have to do overnight, you could stop your fingers and say grow wheat."
"23854850","23856890"," And they would rotate into it in a heartbeat."
"23859350","23862270"," Part of that whole like this is a shortage thing is a scam. "
"23863050","23869410"," It's a, it's a, it's somewhat to an extent a, a good shortage."
"23873550","23875510"," More US calls coming in."
"23876670","23879750"," USO January, or should be April 1st, ADC. "
"23880510","23886930"," If you do buy calls on, on, I want to do later one last thing."
"23887070","23889310"," If you do buy calls on these tickers like USO."
"23890450","23891030"," Oxy. "
"23892930","23893970"," Buy on wheat."
"23895610","23897650"," Dig through the options chains."
"23900390","23901750"," And try to stay. "
"23904790","23907510"," Where the interest is."
"23907990","23913250"," Unlike maybe like an apple where you can just buy like a nice round number outside the money."
"23913890","23918030"," Further down the line than where all the interest is on those specific calls and puts. "
"23918030","23923810"," A low or not low float on low trade and low interest tickers always stay with the pack."
"23925990","23930230"," I always tend to stay with the pack because you're, you're going to look for more buyers to step in"
"23930230","23931330"," and replace you at some point."
"23933190","23941530"," If I'm more success staying with the pack or slightly outside or one or two strikes away on a, like"
"23941530","23942490"," a five or a zero. "
"23944170","23947610"," I guess more I'm making a statement that's not really exactly true."
"23948870","23955050"," Yeah, but I'm on low trade tickers because of the difference in the spreads in the bid ask."
"23955430","23959270"," You can get really fucked and you don't really fuck to the most most is the market makers. "
"23960030","23964570"," They don't want to pay you because you're just one guy right with with holding calls."
"23965470","23968670"," And also in the low traders like, like, especially wheat."
"23969250","23973170"," Sometimes it's better just by the underlying just by the actual physical stock and don't even fuck"
"23973170","23974930"," around with the calls. "
"23975210","23979150"," Sometimes those calls are being used to actually raise the price of the underlying equity."
"23979810","23983890"," Just be careful on those on those illiquid trades."
"23986190","23988210"," BA is still trading down. "
"23991350","23993810"," Some higher highs heading into this positive for BA."
"23994430","23998030"," BA is touched a touch down below one 83 74."
"23998590","24002110"," I was later this early this afternoon at two 30 when that news came in that they were going to"
"24002110","24002590"," work with China. "
"24003210","24006650"," Another lower lower another lower low heading into the close that's positive for BA."
"24007970","24009450"," They had bad news this morning."
"24016730","24021110"," And then we know if you're holding on the on the overnight I'm flat right now still no positions. "
"24021630","24024230"," And I'll I don't care if we trade higher or lower."
"24024570","24031290"," I'm looking more for looking more on this close what I'm looking for is if we sell down to 435"
"24031290","24032990"," tomorrow I'll be looking to buy a dip."
"24033210","24039190"," And if we sell if we gap up into the overnight like 450 or 447 or whatever I'd be looking"
"24039190","24040170"," to short it from here. "
"24040370","24041890"," So this is not tradable for me."
"24043090","24049950"," Although I could see a move in either direction in the overnight a trend day tomorrow that you can"
"24049950","24050510"," get ahead of."
"24050510","24055310"," I don't know that I would take you either side of that trade because I think that I think it"
"24055310","24060770"," I think it leans towards the bears slightly better like 60% in the bears favor 40% of the"
"24060770","24061310"," bulls favor. "
"24062750","24065870"," But even so the risk is not spread wide enough."
"24069150","24073270"," You know it's like the trend that the last five trend days going up you kind of knew it was"
"24073270","24073890"," going up right."
"24073890","24078970"," You kind of landed I kind of led it to some conviction that we were going to go up and"
"24078970","24079590"," try to hit 450. "
"24080770","24085750"," I don't have any convict I don't have that kind of conviction in if we're going up or down from"
"24085750","24086670"," today into tomorrow."
"24108170","24112790"," Yeah they got a bunch of shit right they've got uranium they've got aluminum they've got wheat."
"24114030","24119810"," They've got a bunch of scarce materials to went long PC again good all commodities track ETF. "
"24120850","24123010"," So Christians bringing up PDBC."
"24128340","24135280"," Like if they come on say 50 BPS wasn't understood correctly Joe corn soybeans we look at wood crane"
"24135280","24137440"," in Russia do one quarter the global wheat."
"24137440","24142820"," Yeah Ukraine's wheat supply is huge right there for the size of their country. "
"24145700","24148480"," Prices will cause more farmers to plant wheat not really farming."
"24149460","24155120"," No that's the point is that it won't increase with the increase of prices will cause more farmers"
"24155120","24155500"," to plant wheat."
"24155680","24159600"," No not unless they're forced into it or they know they can make money off of it. "
"24159760","24163960"," They have to be like almost guaranteed that the wheat prices are going to continue to stay high."
"24166620","24172720"," Now US having drought too so not really in fertilizer is more expensive with oil of transportation"
"24172720","24174500"," is more expensive thought wood was toast."
"24174660","24177920"," I haven't looked at it in a while what the fuck is up with the zim they have a $17"
"24177920","24181600"," dividend with X dividend day tomorrow so allows you to talk right. "
"24182160","24182300"," Yeah."
"24184820","24190180"," Yeah I heard I saw some chatter about Zim as well on Ben Zinga today."

"24258070","24263410"," Also have that April 1st 80 C hundred ninety six thousand dollars USO."
"24264110","24269490"," I like to see this bolstering right now we've got June 16th four forty five C."
"24269610","24273170"," I already told you about that eight million dollars that's propping the market up right now. "
"24273850","24276650"," That's good that's good to see it's bulls want to see that."
"24276650","24279650"," Market on closing balance one point one billion to the buy side."
"24284960","24291960"," As if you've ever seen a little volume moving above the forty four forty level still down around a"
"24291960","24292700"," quarter of a percent. "
"24303440","24306660"," To eight million in spy calls."
"24312360","24313140"," Traded up."
"24341530","24344710"," This looks quite bullish I'll give you that if you look at. "
"24346050","24350670"," You got one nice down here a little bit higher low here higher low here higher low here."
"24351410","24353690"," It is being supported right now to spy."
"24356670","24359450"," This is a nicer close better close than I expected. "
"24360930","24367570"," Still not not not getting that that higher close over here this second price point right we had"
"24367570","24369070"," this number one tag over here."
"24369530","24373410"," And we really want to see this tag above here not quite seen it here."
"24380520","24382900"," So I'm flat into this bell here today. "
"24385160","24396260"," That means I"
"24396260","24396260"," got a good sleep tonight."
"24400460","24404380"," Yeah I was thinking the same thing drink tell I think they got like a bunch of interns reading the"
"24404380","24404860"," news off."
"24405320","24409760"," And they're quoting news sources that are I'm scratching my head over. "
"24412460","24416480"," He did a put back spread on a M.U.L. and this morning good job."
"24417020","24419280"," I love those put back threads love them."
"24420440","24421460"," Absolutely love them. "
"24455140","24460040"," Come on give me that trade higher man hit my higher number so I can take a fucking short."
"24461040","24462920"," This pissing me off now."
"24464240","24470580"," Pending it right into the bell just murder and options I was watching the options chain earlier and"
"24470580","24471440"," I'm looking at it. "
"24471580","24475760"," I'm like Dave these fucking guys are just killing both sides right now."
"24476020","24477580"," They fucking murder both sides."
"24477920","24479240"," The trade was made today. "
"24479820","24481080"," This was the trade from this morning."
"24481620","24486120"," We know that the lower trade was the 440 both targets were hit on the day."
"24487440","24491560"," And so the question becomes what is the trade in the coming couple days. "
"24492260","24498920"," This almost looks like more more OPEC OPEC stuff I had to guess watching some of the flow that's"
"24498920","24500160"," coming in as well right now."
"24501000","24504320"," One one note as we close up here we've got five minutes to the close."
"24504420","24509480"," Let's talk real quick about end of month and where we want to be closing. "
"24509480","24510780"," We want to be closing above."
"24512300","24514640"," Let's take a look at the three months here."
"24516400","24518940"," And we're going to be looking at January. "
"24522940","24527960"," Let's see if I'm the 31st is right in here 440 right."
"24529860","24531840"," And we're going to look at February."
"24537120","24538570"," Where we have the 28th. "
"24540400","24541980"," A little bit closer here."
"24545680","24549620"," 436 49 or so somewhere in there I'd have to get the official close."
"24550140","24553780"," This is 6 p.m. 434 18. "
"24554720","24557860"," So roughly this area of my cursor so you guys can't see this yet."
"24557940","24559220"," I want to show you guys this real quick."
"24560560","24562580"," Let's take a look at a couple things. "
"24562720","24564000"," We need to see some things here."
"24565040","24566040"," See some things."
"24566920","24568720"," This is the 31st right here right. "
"24568900","24570840"," 443 98 right."
"24570980","24572000"," This was a red month."
"24575090","24579010"," And then down here on the 28th we had another red month. "
"24580030","24588070"," This is roughly 435 65 or so 435 65."
"24591090","24595670"," And so right down here we don't want to be closing the month."
"24595790","24597930"," We only have so many trading days left right. "
"24600580","24601960"," Right down here."
"24605500","24609580"," So somewhere down somewhere down in here on the 31st."
"24611280","24619040"," They could pump this market up just enough to keep it from closing at 435 or they trade it down. "
"24620020","24621060"," And we trade higher."
"24622120","24628680"," But note that if we close below 435 61 or so."
"24629440","24632880"," This should be a big mark on your calendar down here 435. "
"24634680","24637200"," Do they want to close it below this."
"24637200","24642180"," If they close below 435 on February that there goes your red quarter."
"24643140","24648540"," You guys know that that's not good for the market right. "
"24648700","24652600"," We close a red quarter that opens the door to."
"24654700","24660800"," Further downside for the next quarter and even if you don't close that quarter red."
"24661580","24666000"," Just to close it green you might just pull it out of your ass to get high enough to get"
"24666000","24666620"," back to 435. "
"24667460","24671740"," Speak conscience of that as as we trade forward."
"24672080","24674340"," We've only got so many days left this month."
"24674420","24675300"," It's already the 21st. "
"24676680","24678960"," As a matter of fact I forgot to tell you guys I've got a birth."
"24679240","24680200"," It's my birthday."
"24681600","24682740"," We have to tell you guys. "
"24684500","24685960"," That it is my birthday."
"24691800","24695500"," Watching spy calls come in for the end of the day here."
"24695500","24697300"," March 23rd 445 C."
"24698000","24704940"," $230,000 $117,000 QQQ's March or 21st. "
"24706080","24711880"," Excuse me those were March or scratch that March 23rd 445 C's right."
"24712360","24718980"," And then March 21st on the Q's 350 C's that's for today."
"24719600","24724820"," Expiring today into this bell looking for a squeeze or a creepy crawly into the close. "
"24727840","24729980"," Trying to hold it up here into this bell."
"24733720","24735080"," That's why I forgot this for birthday."
"24744880","24747840"," I wasn't even paying attention. "
"24750500","24751620"," It's my birthday bra."
"24755420","24756720"," Yup, many areas."
"24761340","24762620"," It's my birthday. "
"24763680","24765180"," It's not today."
"24765420","24765980"," It's tomorrow."
"24766880","24767920"," Tomorrow's my birthday. "
"24769220","24770540"," But I didn't realize it."
"24770620","24771760"," I'm like, oh shit, really?"
"24776790","24777590"," Hell yeah."
"24777970","24779190"," I wonder if they're planning on anything. "
"24779190","24781250"," They usually keep it a secret if they're planning anything."
"24781630","24782910"," No one talks about it."
"24784390","24786530"," Nice little squeeze higher in the close here. "
"24787290","24789550"," We'll see if we can catch a higher plug here."
"24791710","24792870"," Into the end of the bell."
"24797090","24798290"," It is spring chicken. "
"24800430","24801110"," It's a birthday."
"24801430","24801850"," Thank you everybody."
"24804070","24805290"," Happy birthday to me. "
"24806110","24808450"," I didn't even realize it was my birthday until just now."
"24810270","24811030"," It's terrible."
"24812350","24812790"," Birthday. "
"24814670","24816150"," L.A.Z.R. Luminar."
"24817130","24818530"," Acquiring freedom photonics."
"24819190","24820650"," Not seen in the terms disclosed. "
"24821930","24823070"," Nice little push up here."
"24824490","24830860"," Zevo Romeo L.A.Z.R. So I'm going to take a look now."
"24831200","24831900"," Now we're at the bell. "
"24832080","24833080"," I'm going to take a look at March 23rd."
"24837220","24841080"," M.I.G.I. Moss and infrastructure group announces upgrade to."
"24842020","24842860"," Exiles targets. "
"24844020","24847920"," And financial results for Q four and fiscal year 2021."
"24857640","24860200"," Austin reporting fiscal year."
"24861080","24863300"," Revenue of 43.9 million. "
"24864120","24866360"," I'm going to see if they can grab some puts here."
"24866540","24872380"," Mike India golf India M.I.G.I. I'm going to grab some Wednesday or 40 Cs."
"24872540","24873760"," Or pharmaceuticals. "
"24874880","24877160"," There's now a hundred and twenty thousand contracts."
"24877720","24884600"," 58 are a loss of fifty eight cents up from a loss of eighty four cents year over year."
"24885440","24887300"," I've got Oscar Romeo India Charlie. "
"24887640","24888380"," I'm going to turn that off."
"24888580","24891560"," I've got some an order in for some puts for."
"24893360","24895220"," Wednesday the twenty third. "
"24897000","24900680"," If I can get them filled at like one twenty five or some one twenty."
"24912260","24914540"," And they're cheap dollar dollar puts."
"24914760","24915640"," I'll take them at four forty. "
"24917040","24921000"," Two days on them and I'll add to them again tomorrow if I need to."
"24923560","24926600"," Getting a nice bit into the market currently in the after hours."
"24936000","24938060"," Yeah, so tomorrow is my birthday. "
"24939060","24940480"," So I'll be here with you tomorrow."
"24951900","24954460"," I'm going to grab some puts here for the."
"24955940","24956880"," For Wednesday. "
"24967800","24971560"," Inside day or not inside day, but an inside training day at least range bound."
"24972620","24974860"," Not really too much of a change day, right?"
"24974860","24977320"," The high say four forty six below four forty."
"24977480","24982840"," And the bull for the for the bull case for forty held. "
"24983060","24988220"," That is an important key level for bulls to see that four forty had held."
"24988680","24990800"," The bulls want to see this."
"24991000","24993460"," The bulls did not want to drift down into this close. "
"24994040","24995100"," They closed higher."
"24995360","25000260"," This is bullish in that respect that four forty was held and maintained."
"25001100","25003120"," The other thing to consider is that. "
"25003120","25005400"," The end with the end of the month coming."
"25005980","25009120"," Bears don't want to chant or excuse not bears, but banks don't."
"25009160","25012480"," Some banks probably don't want to see us close below four thirty five. "
"25012680","25014740"," If we were to close below four thirty five."
"25014740","25018500"," It triggers a bunch of algorithmic selling to much lower numbers."
"25019980","25022680"," So you could see a bolstering of the market. "
"25023120","25026540"," Even if we were to trade down below four thirty five after the first."
"25026960","25029060"," So if you're a bear start to look for."
"25029720","25033240"," Maybe puts that are dated after the first of March. "
"25033920","25036540"," So in case we dip below after the first of March."
"25038080","25040300"," So they get that window dressing on the quarter."
"25040320","25045940"," You have a couple bad couple bad months and then a bank comes back and says don't worry about it. "
"25045940","25047140"," We saved the quarter, right?"
"25047940","25050060"," So you get that that instance of saving the quarter."
"25051620","25055460"," We have now had six where we're down today."
"25056360","25056980"," Which is interesting. "
"25056980","25057700"," We're down."
"25057820","25063540"," We were down to a point zero five percent point two two percent on the cash market today."
"25063820","25067080"," Not that bad right for for bulls could have been a lot worse. "
"25067720","25070580"," And it wasn't they didn't break four thirty five and had any lower."
"25070960","25075840"," A day of consolidation after this big power move is good for the bulls and the fact that it wasn't"
"25075840","25079400"," sold right away shows that there's still interest in holding this level."
"25080640","25083680"," So we'll see if the bears get any kind of a respite here. "
"25083680","25086640"," Or if we could just continue straight higher at this point."
"25086980","25091240"," Not seeing that sell off currently does lend something to the bulls."
"25091760","25093240"," And that's a good close for the bulls. "
"25093660","25098380"," It's good to see this this this bar right here at four at fourteen thirty."
"25098760","25102380"," It's in decision bar, but then a move higher is bullish."
"25103380","25104860"," This is a nice bullish move. "
"25105280","25108080"," All of this loss was through was retaken back by the bulls."
"25108380","25109800"," So I'm going to give the end of the day to the bulls."
"25110420","25111200"," I'm impressed for the bulls. "
"25111360","25112480"," Congratulations to the bulls."
"25112880","25114340"," And we'll see you guys tomorrow."
"25114680","25116220"," Please like and subscribe these videos. "
"25116400","25117180"," I'll be here with you."
"25117320","25117840"," I'll try to get here."
"25118000","25122020"," I tried to get here early this morning, but I was having some upgrades on equipment this morning"
"25122020","25122460"," and software. "
"25123240","25128640"," And I will if I can get here early tomorrow, we'll do a better review for the week ahead and"
"25128640","25130020"," where we expect things to go."
"25130460","25133800"," If you are bears still, you know how it's shaping up right?"
"25133940","25137420"," You start to look at I think someone mentioned a megaphone earlier."
"25137820","25139760"," You start seeing a megaphone pattern emerge. "
"25139760","25145000"," And we'll start watching this megaphone will hold on a second here."
"25148440","25150640"," Another new megaphone pattern emerging."
"25151360","25154540"," We'll start to track this and see if it. "
"25157970","25161710"," If this if this megaphone holds or if it starts to."
"25162090","25164270"," Let's take a look at us on a larger time frame."
"25167150","25170510"," We'll see if we're creating some kind of a megaphone pattern here. "
"25172210","25173490"," And where it leads to."
"25174310","25175990"," I think I was calling for 430."
"25176610","25180430"," And the bulls are calling for four or four or four fifty. "
"25180810","25183010"," You could get 450 in the next two days."
"25183010","25186550"," If you're bullish, that's what you'd be looking for or that we try."
"25186670","25190110"," We start to trade down into the right. "
"25190430","25191570"," So there it goes right there."
"25191710","25193970"," Okay, folks, I will catch up with you tomorrow."
"25194510","25197410"," I will be here with you tomorrow, my birthday. "
"25197410","25199550"," I don't think there's any plans for me unless."
"25200030","25203670"," It's usually after the I've got kids that go to school and that kind of stuff."
"25204070","25209830"," So we will look to see if we if we remain range bound within this within this range right here"
"25209830","25216730"," or if the bulls can push us up and above in the overnight and break out of this megaphone that's"
"25216730","25216930"," forming. "
"25218510","25220610"," You guys have a wonderful afternoon."
"25220630","25222410"," I hope you guys have made money today."
"25222950","25223930"," It was a pretty good day today. "
"25223930","25227250"," And I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow."
"25232640","25236060"," I should be way to go over to do a live stream or you're not doing your birthday, right?"
"25236380","25237560"," Yeah, I will tell you this."
"25237640","25239620"," If they do something tonight, I'll let you know in the morning. "
"25240280","25244040"," But if they don't do anything over tonight, I'd probably to hung over the next day."
"25244680","25245900"," Probably on Wednesday."
"25247160","25247860"," I'll be too hung over. "
"25248400","25249360"," But we'll find out."
"25249620","25250860"," I don't think anything's happening tonight."
