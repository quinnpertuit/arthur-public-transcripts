"2810","3890"," Here we go, B."
"5030","6130"," I-W-M."
"6390","7850"," Now looking so good right now."
"10090","12010"," Squeeze my roll over I think. "
"14310","15790"," We got some brain share."
"16550","18810"," We are higher though, we are higher than 5 and 10."
"24350","25750"," Check 1, 2, make check. "
"85600","87280"," Check 1, 2, almost there."
"93600","95400"," Well, if you have a little bit of..."
"95400","96740"," We got something to talk about today."
"98700","101800"," We have something to talk about today. "
"102400","106320"," Now I can't guarantee this, but we do have some to talk about."
"106740","116200"," The price is what matters."
"116420","117440"," Is that the camera not on?"
"118940","119460"," Okay. "
"120800","128060"," What's going on up there?"
"131280","133960"," We do have a slight tummy."
"135560","138900"," There's a first question about momentum earlier today."
"140140","141640"," We are going to break that up to you. "
"141880","143420"," We just switch right into the market brief here."
"150840","152620"," Good morning out there, how are you all doing?"
"152800","155720"," We are going to go straight into the market brief this morning as we are a little bit late."
"155720","157840"," I've got some meeting coming up I got to get to. "
"158160","161440"," I thought it was going to be earlier, but I've been waiting and waiting and waiting has not"
"161440","162160"," happened yet."
"162760","168400"," But right off the start here this morning, breaking stocks rise for the first day and three after"
"168400","173280"," FBI or FBI, February, CPI is about as expected."
"174320","178100"," Not too much here this morning in terms of news. "
"178560","181520"," We are going to likely talk about two big things today."
"181520","186280"," And that is momentum in the market."
"186280","188520"," I saw some talk about it this morning. "
"189340","195420"," There is some flattening of momentum, but it's more towards a corrective environment, not"
"195420","198020"," necessarily the entire market rolling over."
"198020","202500"," I think that's going to become a topic of conversation."
"203420","211060"," Now, even so that topic of conversation coming up, it's more relevant towards a broadening of"
"211060","214820"," price, where we get new highs, some significant lows. "
"214820","222300"," You should see traders be able to trade this larger range than we've had, but that doesn't"
"222300","226040"," necessarily mean the market is rolling over permanently or anything like that."
"226360","229020"," So we'll take a look at momentum today and see what you guys think of that."
"229600","233180"," We also had a slightly hot inflation print this morning. "
"233720","236320"," We'll look at that as well today at some point."
"236740","244360"," So give me just a few moments here."
"244360","250700"," The question about whether we're going to raise or cut rates in March, we'll discuss that, discuss"
"250700","253560"," that as well in this upcoming rate decision meeting. "
"254380","258760"," Most people are not expecting a rate cut at this meeting."
"259519","266000"," I think 75% of respondents to a poll I saw yesterday that was presented on CVS to the to"
"266000","269980"," the to the main street crowd right said, no one's expecting it."
"269980","271880"," This rate decision. "
"272260","273820"," So, and I'm not either."
"274000","276780"," They've been the Fed has been anti adversarial."
"277020","280060"," They have telegraphed what to expect. "
"280160","284720"," You figure at least two rate cuts this year, likely not back to back."
"285040","288180"," And there's a key point in this discussion about inflation here."
"289280","296780"," If they're all eyes are watching, if they do one cut, then no cut, then a cut, everything is OK. "
"297460","301700"," And the longer that they go without making a cut, everything is OK."
"302240","308900"," If you see any sort of emergency cuts or panic cuts, that's never a good sign."
"309140","309940"," You never want to see that. "
"310040","314240"," You want to see the Fed and the Treasury Department acting all common cool."
"315020","321820"," With that said, if you if you start to see those, you start seeing like a or cut this March,"
"321820","328920"," that's not going to likely be taken as a positive sign for the stock market economy."
"329360","333940"," More specifically, something being broke that we don't see. "
"334600","340680"," So the key point here in this in this question of whether we get rate cuts or not is this."
"342380","349260"," Differentiate between betting on a rate cut or not know that that's one thing on its own that has"
"349260","352760"," nothing to do with whether we actually raise or cut rates."
"353180","357620"," The second part would be if they take their time. "
"358760","362680"," Cutting rates or even raising rates, either or it doesn't matter."
"362680","363680"," Just just the."
"363680","368980"," The way that they do it does matter. "
"369340","371680"," The last part part on this too would be."
"372940","379640"," Well, well, the last part that I get into in this that not doesn't really matter here, but the"
"379640","389000"," velocity of inflation of unemployment of jobs of the yield curve, all those things."
"389000","394400"," The commerce, the more sideways it comes up, it comes down, it comes up, it comes down slowly. "
"395020","398400"," The safer you are as a buyer and as a bull, believe it or not."
"398940","402900"," When we start to see any kind of velocity in those movements, things get really spicy and"
"402900","403320"," dangerous."
"404580","406920"," So even this morning, we got a slightly hot print, right?"
"407440","413600"," Now that is actually negative on the markets in line with the ramp and unemployment. "
"414240","421220"," Okay, so we have an employment rising as we caught this this hot print, slightly hot print this"
"421220","424780"," morning, not not blasily in that print, just slightly hot."
"424900","429620"," So the two of those together, I'm taking as a negative on the markets overall because they're"
"429620","435460"," together, but even so, we're not talking straight vertical here in this stuff and that is real"
"435460","443580"," vertical up or down."
"449740","453740"," So we're going to switch from there over to financial juice. "
"454000","454680"," Couple of notes here."
"454780","457020"," We've got a treasury auction and a bond auction."
"457140","457520"," It's tomorrow. "
"457660","460360"," I noticed Andy Constant was on fintuit this morning."
"460780","462520"," He gave out a big red stick of gum."
"463120","470260"," And I'm assuming this morning that he's looking for those numbers or those auctions today and into"
"470260","470760"," tomorrow. "
"470980","473560"," We have no other really big news that I know of."
"473560","475000"," Unless you've got something out there."
"475360","478480"," But then we come into more volatility on Thursday and Friday. "
"478960","481600"," We also have triple witching coming up."
"481720","484580"," We'll look at some of those dates later today as well."
"485920","489160"," MOC imbalance, 33 million to the buy side. "
"490020","495060"," US bank liquidity likely to remain relatively stretched until there is a shift in feds monetary"
"495060","495840"," policy."
"496440","497680"," What else do we have here?"
"497960","500420"," This is all inflation stuff from this morning."
"501240","507180"," Traders still see June is the most likely start of the Fed rate cuts after inflation data. "
"507200","508060"," That's bullshit."
"508900","512880"," No one cares about inflation data that's coming out right now."
"512919","515720"," I mean, I guess we got an outside the really outside of the range. "
"517039","517840"," Inflation print."
"518200","518299"," Sure."
"518760","521780"," Does anybody really think that we're going to get a rate cut March?"
"522320","523260"," Not too many people. "
"523720","527660"," Now I did say something last night on the discord late night."
"527660","533860"," And that was I was speaking with David AMS. And I had said, man, I'm like, I got one more"
"533860","539420"," rip here on I got one more rip here on spy until that broadening of price. "
"539980","541380"," I was like, it's still there."
"541480","542420"," It's still sitting there."
"542420","548020"," I'm like, and there's nothing that I can think of that could make that happen. "
"548420","552780"," Now, this is the 25% chance of a rate cut, right?"
"552780","554820"," I'm with 75% crowd."
"555520","558020"," That 25% crowd that's out there."
"560600","562580"," That's the one thing that's bothering me. "
"562900","564300"," I'm like, what could happen?"
"564900","570160"," That would what could happen that could that could potentially open the options market to the"
"570160","570680"," upside."
"571200","580180"," You need sentiment to think we can get there and for a more robust upside options market."
"580180","583040"," We talk about sentiment around here, too, right?"
"584100","586300"," You need a reason to go higher than 530. "
"586540","587900"," Think about that in your head right now."
"587960","593580"," If you're out there right now and you're a bull for us to go to 53550."
"593760","595260"," No, it sounds crazy to you. "
"595660","598920"," You need a reason for that to happen, right?"
"599120","601520"," You need a reason to believe we can go there."
"601580","605620"," It's not good enough that we're trading 514 today."
"606100","607240"," Well, next up's 530. "
"607420","608460"," I'm going to start buying some calls."
"608460","609720"," It really doesn't work."
"609920","616620"," You need some continuation of the thought that we can go there and what would trigger that. "
"617020","622300"," Not that, not that rate cuts matter or why, why are we going to 530 or higher?"
"622780","630360"," But you do need some kind of a fire underneath the ass of buyers, bulls, whoever, even if it's not"
"630360","630840"," sustained."
"631600","636320"," You just need that moment of a spark for people to go, oh, wow, we got a rate cut."
"636320","638840"," I'm going to buy a 550 calls or go into the fucking moon. "
"639080","645240"," Even if we don't, you just need those buyers to open up those gamma walls higher and higher and"
"645240","645440"," higher."
"645940","647860"," Without that, I don't know if we get it."
"648120","652000"," We'll look at momentum this morning to try to see if we can find an answer to that. "
"653280","659880"," U.S. short-term interest rate futures drop after inflation data core CPI year over year."
"660080","668240"," Actual 3.8% forecast was 3.7 previous 3.9. That year-over-year number, every time you guys"
"668240","673820"," are watching CNBC out there, every fucking time, sorry to swear about this early, but every fucking"
"673820","681400"," time you hear these people, these garbage talking heads on CNBC discuss with you that these guys on"
"681400","687440"," CNBC, when they start saying to you, the Fed's favorite inflation number right that month over"
"687440","692780"," month stuff so they can complicate shit, has nothing on year-over-year inflation."
"692780","698880"," It truly is the indicator for if they're going to cut rates, yes or no. "
"699260","702460"," We are not at 2% on year-over-year inflation."
"702900","708120"," I realize they want to front-run that before we get to 2%."
"708120","713180"," But they're also going to manipulate that number as much as they can and try to stop the velocity. "
"713520","720060"," When we slam down at 2%, and we ricochet off of it, things are going to get really nasty."
"720060","723480"," There is a potential for some real true danger in the marketplace."
"724520","731500"," US CPI month over month, actual 0.4% forecast, 0.4, previous 0.3. Yesterday, talk to you guys"
"731500","733860"," about the manipulation of the market, right?"
"734060","739020"," As a matter of fact, on Sunday, if you're a pro-trader, I sent you a chart called all the"
"739020","739860"," macro you need. "
"741000","743040"," And I drew right in there for you."
"743640","745720"," We just had an unemployment print."
"745720","752380"," If you catch that hot inflation print, usually there's some down coming. "
"752720","755260"," You can actually look back when we have both of those."
"755520","759680"," You can actually see where they're manipulating all this stuff and you're like, right down there,"
"759760","760900"," you're like, oh, you can't see it there."
"761720","763880"," See that unemployment go up a little bit, just a tick. "
"764660","768660"," All of a sudden you get the inflation print tick, then all of a sudden you're down back again like"
"768660","768900"," this."
"769560","771080"," Just like this on both of them, right?"
"771340","773720"," You don't want to see any kind of stuff like this, right?"
"773720","776560"," Blast down, spike back up, right?"
"777140","781500"," You don't want to see unemployment above, let's say, 4%."
"781500","788760"," So right now, we already saw the hot print on unemployment, and we saw the down print on inflation. "
"789300","793640"," And of course, this morning it comes right back up, and now you've got both of these in line."
"793940","799380"," This usually or typically leads to a little bit of a do, not do, but just downside into the"
"799380","799740"," marketplace."
"800440","805320"," Our last correction, as a matter of fact, had both of those numbers going up slightly. "
"805820","808000"," So we'll see what happens on the opening bell this morning."
"808380","813700"," You can actually see some blood right now going down a retest below on 510c."
"814300","815360"," So we're going to get over there. "
"815740","816280"," Excuse me."
"816360","817700"," Sorry, we're going to get over there in just a few moments."
"818960","820040"," For the rest of today. "
"821240","827580"," For the rest of today, we've got on Tuesday, we had the NFIB, optimism index this morning at 6 a "
"827580","833440",".m. CPI numbers coming out, then we've got the federal budget today at 2 p.m. Nothing scheduled for"
"833440","833820"," Wednesday."
"834040","839200"," So the only two things left to do would be the treasury action bond auction into tomorrow."
"839780","845260"," And then we get back into more data again on Thursday to get core PPI. "
"845600","851200"," We already know that CPI can give an insight into what to expect on PPI."
"851600","855940"," So this is going to be a topic of negativity into Thursday."
"855940","862040"," And then also on Friday, we get the Empire State Manufacturing Survey, Import Price Index,"
"862520","868060"," Industrial Production Capacity Resolution, Consumer Sentiment Preliminary by 10 a.m. So some of"
"868060","872440"," this stuff here, not as important, but we also have triple witching on Friday the 15th. "
"872800","875120"," Let's get right into the markets here."
"875520","876460"," Let's go right straight to the main."
"876720","877640"," We already in there. "
"877760","877880"," Sweet."
"878460","879820"," Do we even do the opening bell?"
"880240","881400"," Let's do the opening bell graphics."
"885200","886160"," All right. "
"886300","886560"," Here we go."
"887140","889060"," Opening bell positioning 930."
"889260","892960"," You should have taken the money on the on the OTM calls on the opening bell this morning. "
"892980","896760"," You were given a chance to exit orderly above down below."
"896800","898800"," We've got two, uh, two pinets."
"899120","901360"," We're going to draw the first one out for you right here. "
"901500","903700"," Here's your first one down here at 5 10."
"904080","907200"," Bulls down here probably thinking this is a dip."
"907200","911320"," I don't think that it is as long as we do not hold 5."
"911320","912100"," 12 16. "
"912640","913520"," I don't like it."
"914000","914580"," Never do."
"914740","915080"," Never do. "
"915240","917640"," Every time we're down here to never like being down here."
"918120","919720"," So we've got that range right there."
"919720","922520"," We got another range above right up in here. "
"923880","925740"," And so far this would be out."
"925940","927900"," This would be what to expect on today, right?"
"928160","931240"," Upside or downside upside downside now."
"931560","933260"," I'm not liking this open. "
"933340","935400"," I'm going to be very clear with you here."
"936000","939600"," That print was not bad, but it's not good either."
"939600","941860"," It's not bad. "
"941960","948120"," It's not good, but watching both of those in line watching that unemployment crest on 4% watching"
"948120","953060"," seat inflation, even if it's just for a small amount of time till they've fraud fraudulently"
"953060","954060"," bullshit your ass."
"954820","958440"," It's going to be negative on the marketplace to some extent."
"959120","960640"," So just in here, right?"
"960800","963960"," We have the nice high up here at 4 5 14 83. "
"964780","965900"," Get the nice low down here."
"966160","969800"," I'm assuming that some of you are all out there going to say, yeah, we just closed that early"
"969800","970360"," morning thing."
"970520","972520"," Let's go back up and close this right here. "
"972740","975380"," I think that is a possibility this morning."
"975480","977620"," But what I don't want to see is a rejection above."
"978240","981040"," Like a bounce right here and then a rejection off that. "
"982640","983960"," It's got attacked by a cat."
"984320","985120"," Hold on a second here."
"985400","986720"," She just climbed up my back. "
"989040","992220"," I don't want to see is anything like this down here, right?"
"992480","992640"," Hold on."
"993720","994860"," Hold on down here."
"995240","996720"," Get through to some of this stuff down here. "
"996720","998720"," That's an ugly looking thing right there."
"998880","1003600"," What I don't want to see is any kind of rejection above that cat just attacked me."
"1004040","1004760"," Why kitty?"
"1005020","1005060"," Why?"
"1005880","1007300"," Why are you attacking me?"
"1007980","1011440"," Any kind of stuff like this fucking is like this to the downside. "
"1011500","1014300"," Okay, pay attention to this one specifically."
"1014920","1016340"," Forget that one right there."
"1016440","1018340"," It's this one right here that I'm afraid of. "
"1018440","1019000"," You see that one?"
"1019540","1022420"," You get a four trigger cluster here that's forming."
"1023579","1025480"," So I want you to see this right now."
"1025480","1028380"," Okay, I want you to watch out for this cluster right here. "
"1028500","1030220"," You got a bear cross right there, right?"
"1030740","1031819"," Kitty, I kid you not."
"1033359","1035300"," I don't like spring time."
"1035460","1039920"," I'm going to send you to the way we're at home for young girls for like four weeks until you"
"1039920","1041000"," get that stuff out of your system. "
"1041000","1041319"," Kitty."
"1042099","1042819"," She's over here."
"1042900","1044359"," She's over here looking at me right now. "
"1044460","1046000"," Am I losing my stream already?"
"1047079","1047660"," Dang it."
"1048560","1048980"," All right."
"1049340","1053600"," Right down here, right?"
"1053600","1054180"," Whoop. "
"1054420","1054820"," Come down here."
"1054920","1058900"," What I don't want to see is that rejection off of a four trigger cluster right near."
"1059280","1060080"," You get the one minute. "
"1060180","1061340"," The one minute five minute."
"1061480","1062840"," The hourly and the half hour."
"1062840","1064560"," We blast down to the downside. "
"1065280","1066900"," So if you are a bull."
"1067520","1069900"," If you are a bull this morning, listen closely."
"1070840","1074700"," As price comes up right now, you are not in safety. "
"1075220","1078060"," Unless you see some action specifically."
"1080860","1083500"," That specifically watch price down here, right?"
"1084220","1087200"," You want to see price come up, right?"
"1087420","1088320"," Come right back down."
"1089940","1094360"," Get yourself a nice new, nice, nice new little right there, maybe. "
"1095500","1096060"," Right."
"1096120","1099140"," Climb back down here and then get yourself at least in new high."
"1099380","1102500"," At least something like this, something like this, right?"
"1102960","1104080"," I'm going to get back above. "
"1104880","1106480"," Clear out all this bullshit in here."
"1106480","1111580"," Even if you pull back down, but you have to be above this hourly trigger, not below it."
"1111680","1116680"," If you see that rejection up here on that hourly trigger, start looking out for down below. "
"1117360","1118300"," I'm going to show you the."
"1119040","1120240"," Watching that cat, man."
"1120360","1120940"," That cat dude. "
"1121500","1123740"," That cat is getting sausier and sausier."
"1123920","1124360"," It's springtime."
"1124540","1124760"," It's coming. "
"1124920","1126080"," I don't know what she's thinking."
"1126540","1128240"," I don't know what is going on with this girl."
"1128440","1130080"," I want you to watch that right there, right?"
"1130460","1134360"," Don't do not want to get caught underneath this intraday ball to the downside. "
"1134360","1137640"," And get below that five, ten down here."
"1137960","1139260"," Five, ten down here."
"1139620","1140440"," Keep your eyes on it. "
"1142420","1142980"," Excuse me."
"1143260","1143960"," Sorry about that."
"1144760","1145700"," I'm losing my voice already. "
"1145900","1146760"," It's like, what day is today?"
"1147240","1147960"," Stay Tuesday?"
"1149300","1149600"," At least."
"1151100","1152640"," We're not even on Thursday yet."
"1153500","1154480"," I'm losing my voice. "
"1154680","1155720"," I'm going to cat all over me."
"1156180","1158260"," So right in there, keep your eyes on both that this morning."
"1158260","1160180"," We're going to switch over right now to the main screen. "
"1165220","1168020"," We'll leave that range right in here for you."
"1168160","1169360"," That looks good right there, right?"
"1170940","1171400"," Rangebound."
"1172440","1172900"," Rangebound. "
"1173520","1175980"," Don't want to see any breaks and rejections underneath."
"1176480","1177980"," Bulls know exactly what they need to do."
"1178460","1180260"," Watch that bounce right now down below. "
"1180420","1180860"," That's the market."
"1181080","1183940"," We're also going to shift over to SPX right now."
"1184000","1185060"," This is SPX Gamma. "
"1186060","1187220"," And what are we looking at here?"
"1187360","1188860"," Watch this tag above here."
"1189100","1190200"," Actually, let's just go down there."
"1190540","1191320"," Let's go down there. "
"1191980","1192900"," Let's go down there."
"1192900","1193400"," Let's go down there."
"1193480","1194620"," I'm going to go over there. "
"1195640","1196100"," Two."
"1197220","1197680"," Two."
"1197780","1198660"," We can see down here. "
"1199000","1200260"," Yeah, we can see all that."
"1200680","1200820"," Okay."
"1202060","1203440"," What do we have up here?"
"1204540","1213060"," Yesterday we talked about two, two place, two, two on gamma at least, two places of resistance. "
"1213900","1216020"," This is the first one we drew in right here."
"1216220","1218200"," So this yellow box, right?"
"1219180","1219980"," Wait a minute here."
"1220920","1221880"," Hold on here. "
"1222820","1223540"," All right."
"1223740","1225200"," So this yellow box right here, right?"
"1225660","1226520"," Let's see it right there."
"1227640","1231620"," So yes, we drew this as your first resistance on gamma. "
"1231620","1236000"," And this being your big second resistance on gamma."
"1236420","1240820"," This morning, the print came in just like calm, right?"
"1241660","1245460"," I would have said to you, yeah, we're going to tag this first one right here, right?"
"1245460","1250280"," And we'll likely get that nice next push to the upside."
"1250880","1253800"," I would put this the second one into question. "
"1254580","1256700"," I'd be like, yeah, today's print."
"1257840","1266260"," Not not as conducive to the big push up into that 51 75 or even the 50 200."
"1267180","1270740"," I would say this one above here at 50 200 likely. "
"1271080","1272480"," And this one should be a big old red box."
"1272600","1273540"," We didn't draw that one in."
"1273540","1275500"," So let's do that, draw that one and we didn't do that yesterday. "
"1275780","1276340"," We weren't even close."
"1278180","1281900"," But that one right there, it's kind of like the top for this week."
"1283460","1285700"," The most I'd expect for this week. "
"1286420","1286820"," Been here."
"1286980","1292300"," So you got one target, two targets, three targets, a possibility for the upside move."
"1292520","1295100"," And you also have a big old bear flag. "
"1296320","1301660"," Form it up for the end of the week for for a triple witching."
"1302240","1309760"," So I do have some concerns and questions about this into Friday and possibly even into Monday."
"1310140","1311840"," So even into Monday. "
"1312060","1315220"," So let's if we can get a little bit of a what an unclenching."
"1315840","1319560"," And they grind us up, grind us up, grind us up."
"1319800","1323780"," And then we come back on Monday right down to the downside, right?"
"1324760","1326460"," So we'll monitor this and see how this goes. "
"1326460","1329780"," The gamma flip is at 51 or 51 10."
"1330080","1334800"," Let me check that really quick and make sure we haven't had any major changes in gamma."
"1335340","1339240"," So we will input some new some new numbers this morning. "
"1340300","1341540"," One quick second here."
"1341800","1343960"," Drop this bad boy down right here."
"1345700","1347700"," Check this bad boy out right here. "
"1348720","1349860"," Just in case."
"1350540","1350580"," Bam."
"1351520","1351740"," Okay. "
"1351740","1353620"," See if we see any changes."
"1354000","1355640"," Oh, that gamma flip is lower."
"1356340","1357020"," See that?"
"1357600","1358480"," And look at that. "
"1358640","1363300"," Right on that gamma flip is much lower this morning at 51 hundred."
"1363680","1365060"," That's actually quite supportive."
"1365300","1367160"," That makes me very happy for an upside move. "
"1367180","1368220"," That makes me feel really good."
"1368880","1373140"," We have this other thing down below this giant gap bill that hasn't happened."
"1373620","1378860"," If I was a bull, which I am right, I would love to see that gap closure. "
"1378860","1382120"," Whenever I see that gap get left behind, I think about algorithms."
"1383100","1384160"," They're like, don't worry, buddy."
"1384320","1385340"," We'll come back for that later. "
"1386100","1391540"," I would not be shocked if we come back to fill this gap next week."
"1392420","1393880"," Next week, not right now."
"1394020","1394360"," Next week. "
"1396840","1400840"," So, so gamma flip 51 hundred."
"1402360","1407620"," Last real support right down here at five zero two zero."
"1408940","1410660"," That's kind of light there though. "
"1410800","1411760"," It's kind of light, man."
"1412180","1414740"," Like that five zero two zero kind of light."
"1415140","1418620"," Negative down here negative down here negative gamma down here. "
"1419240","1421840"," But this is your last true support down here."
"1421860","1422840"," Let's write this in right here."
"1422960","1424240"," Just so you know that it's there. "
"1427420","1428260"," Maybe you're right."
"1428380","1428840"," Real support."
"1429560","1431500"," There you go. "
"1432760","1434220"," Real support down here."
"1436680","1439380"," Price coming back up right now to attack again."
"1439380","1443560"," The pre market or the high at nine thirty. "
"1444020","1446620"," And that resistance point, we already tagged that one."
"1446680","1448180"," So we're going to get rid of that one right there."
"1448180","1453920"," So your next target to the upside is going to be this fifty fifty one fifty. "
"1454520","1457820"," And then fifty one seventy five and then fifty two hundred."
"1457820","1460860"," These are your three points of resistance to the upside."
"1460880","1462340"," So we'll monitor this today. "
"1463000","1463640"," Oh, look at that."
"1463800","1464320"," Dude, look at that."
"1464680","1466000"," Markets crawling right back. "
"1466740","1468880"," Here's your gamma flip right here."
"1469140","1470320"," And your gap to fill is down below."
"1470640","1472660"," And your real support is right down here. "
"1472860","1474420"," So let me make this a little bit smaller here."
"1475000","1477140"," Put this up for you for today so you can see it."
"1477660","1479100"," We'll actually write PT one. "
"1481060","1482580"," Let's do a PT one."
"1485400","1487080"," We'll get rid of those boxes too."
"1487400","1487720"," I don't like that. "
"1487880","1488600"," I don't like that box."
"1491440","1493380"," We'll make that smaller sixteen."
"1494600","1495460"," PT one. "
"1498600","1499560"," PT two."
"1502040","1502780"," Right there."
"1505340","1507980"," And we'll do like the bulls you're dreaming up here. "
"1508220","1508640"," PT three."
"1509820","1510780"," PT three."
"1511360","1512160"," You wish bulls. "
"1514640","1515340"," Right there."
"1515460","1516560"," We need a reason to go up there though."
"1516660","1517060"," So bad. "
"1517980","1518740"," We really do."
"1518880","1521540"," I want to really like, I want to get above that forty two hundred."
"1521540","1523660"," And I want to start smashing this stuff. "
"1524300","1525360"," Bam, bam."
"1525660","1527500"," Start trading that bad boy right there."
"1527600","1527760"," Look at it. "
"1527920","1529220"," Fifty three hundred."
"1529840","1531500"," Look at that magic up there."
"1531600","1532420"," It's like sunshine. "
"1534200","1535160"," And rainbows."
"1536580","1538140"," And hey, what's up guys?"
"1539300","1540700"," We're going to fifty three hundred."
"1541000","1543400"," What do we need for sentiment to believe that?"
"1544820","1545300"," Yay!"
"1546280","1547500"," Look at that cute little body. "
"1548060","1548920"," He's got his hands up."
"1549140","1549540"," He's all there."
"1549540","1550860"," He's like, yeah, hey, what's up?"
"1551140","1552600"," Let's get above fifty two hundred. "
"1552640","1553740"," Let's start consolidating."
"1553920","1555580"," Let's rip some faces off."
"1555960","1556420"," Yay!"
"1557080","1558480"," That's what everybody wants, right?"
"1562060","1563500"," I'm going to go with I doubt it. "
"1564480","1566260"," I doubt that's what everybody wants."
"1569260","1569960"," PT three."
"1570080","1570500"," You wish bulls. "
"1570980","1571120"," All right."
"1571200","1573460"," We'll get back to the main screen right now."
"1574660","1575760"," Hello in second air. "
"1579880","1580820"," Inside day, right?"
"1580980","1581300"," Or not inside."
"1581560","1582780"," We're going to inside range right now."
"1582820","1583520"," You have the bottom here. "
"1583700","1584860"," Bull's still buying this."
"1585760","1586500"," Bull's right now."
"1586580","1587520"," This is great for bulls. "
"1588380","1589580"," No rejection to the downside."
"1590740","1591360"," That's good to see."
"1591540","1592340"," Check mark for the bulls. "
"1593860","1596260"," We should see a nice fat squeeze right here."
"1596360","1597500"," Come right back down."
"1597800","1598080"," Bam. "
"1598460","1600800"," And possibly trade that one right there."
"1602060","1603920"," So we'll draw that in for you right now."
"1603920","1606360"," Nice little save here. "
"1606560","1607480"," Stick save by the bulls."
"1608080","1610000"," Some revenge right there."
"1611500","1612400"," Back down. "
"1612940","1614640"," Some revenge trading here for the bulls."
"1615500","1617320"," Well, I'm telling you right now."
"1617940","1622980"," This right here is a trap for bears right here. "
"1623560","1624820"," They didn't wait for the rejection."
"1625360","1627460"," They didn't wait for the rejection to the downside."
"1628480","1630520"," They're getting squoos right now. "
"1630840","1634040"," Definitely angry sellers right here on the open this morning."
"1634540","1636760"," Now it's 10 a.m. right here."
"1636960","1637900"," Let's put this one back up. "
"1640900","1642680"," Dude, they're getting smoked right now."
"1643120","1644540"," They got smoked right here."
"1646440","1648160"," They got smoked right there. "
"1649260","1650380"," Bears smoked."
"1651920","1655360"," Did not wait for the rejection on the hourly trigger."
"1656020","1657400"," Not good enough to get down here. "
"1657960","1660160"," You need to also get the rejection."
"1661000","1663660"," The moment you get the rejection, you enter the trade."
"1663660","1665320"," And bloodbath. "
"1665600","1665960"," Bam."
"1666420","1666960"," Bam."
"1667500","1668080"," Downside. "
"1669760","1672120"," Did not wait for the rejection this morning."
"1672400","1676320"," Well, that trap was just getting just getting stopped out right here in mass."
"1676760","1677480"," Upside target. "
"1677900","1678540"," Five fifteen."
"1680580","1687220"," Five thirteen ninety three and then if the bulls can hold it right down there."
"1687500","1687620"," Bam. "
"1687840","1689660"," Five fifteen ninety nine right there."
"1690360","1692660"," Yeah, they're going to get mad on that one for sure."
"1692660","1694960"," They're not going to be happy. "
"1701070","1703910"," Guarantee that was a guaranteed right that."
"1704570","1706490"," So that was a pain trade."
"1708630","1710270"," Guarantee that was that that was the pain. "
"1712530","1714690"," Leave that right there and see how that works out."
"1717710","1723110"," Oh, yeah, there's definitely a pain trade right here."
"1726320","1727100"," Definitely a pit. "
"1727200","1729020"," This is this is all pain right here."
"1731040","1731480"," Rage."
"1733260","1734600"," Murder the ball, baby. "
"1737040","1737960"," Murder the ball."
"1738420","1740480"," Okay, give me a few seconds here."
"1740520","1742300"," I'm going to set some stuff up for you. "
"1742580","1745100"," I have a I had a meeting at eight a.m. this morning."
"1745720","1748060"," These guys push me off, push me off, push me off."
"1748200","1750140"," So I got to call these guys back really quick. "
"1750560","1751040"," I get some stuff."
"1751200","1753320"," I got to take care of some technical stuff in the background."
"1753320","1757680"," So if you guys can't see on this launch that I got to make sure is firmed up. "
"1758300","1762460"," I've got I've got like I got a lot of moving parts going on the background right now."
"1762480","1764380"," I got people acting like they're not who they are."
"1764420","1765880"," I got all kinds of weirdness going on. "
"1766140","1771600"," And so I got to make sure that I tamp that down and that and that I'm not getting scammed"
"1771600","1773040"," or run around here in the background."
"1774180","1776960"," See me just a few seconds and I will take a peek right here."
"1777040","1777600"," Keep that up. "
"1778300","1781620"," And this is where's the early trigger right there."
"1781620","1783820"," It's a shitty looking line right there."
"1784380","1786560"," But this this this looks kind of terrible. "
"1786860","1787940"," Well, make it cleaner."
"1788520","1789640"," Yeah, there it is right there."
"1790940","1792180"," Does not look pretty. "
"1792820","1794720"," See here somewhere up in there."
"1795420","1797180"," Maybe a little bit maybe a little bit larger."
"1798460","1801120"," Something like that, maybe something like that. "
"1802420","1805200"," Guys like you guys are like Marines and stuff."
"1805320","1807760"," You're going to drop pretty something like that."
"1808360","1809400"," Something like that. "
"1810960","1811960"," See if they can do it."
"1812020","1813700"," See if the bulls can do it and push us up there."
"1814180","1815140"," First upside target. "
"1815800","1817100"," We got this target here."
"1817460","1819880"," Next target would be 51470."
"1820240","1821420"," Next target above 516. "
"1822420","1832180"," This should be in line right here with this 516 is roughly in line with that 5175 on SPX."
"1832840","1833740"," Somewhere up in there."
"1833820","1836040"," And I think that's probably the best you're going to get. "
"1836140","1838720"," I don't think you get 5200 with that print this morning."
"1838720","1840260"," That's just be aware of it."
"1842320","1843300"," What else we got here?"
"1843480","1844900"," I got cues up for you this morning. "
"1845080","1845500"," Here's cues."
"1846400","1848220"," Dip buyers stepped right in this morning."
"1848600","1857120"," There is a discussion that we need to have about the what?"
"1857320","1858240"," Let's take a look at this right here. "
"1860160","1866340"," So there's talk this morning about the rate of velocity and momentum in the market."
"1866340","1868240"," As of right now."
"1869260","1875700"," Yeah, there's a small sloping flattening. "
"1876080","1881120"," You could say a velocity, but it's not there."
"1882600","1883820"," It's not there."
"1884280","1890180"," And even when you get this slope here, let me come down below here and show you guys some. "
"1891800","1893640"," Let's look at the one hour chart."
"1893640","1894540"," Okay."
"1895160","1896960"," This is a better chart to watch. "
"1901400","1903540"," Let's go down and take a look at this."
"1909520","1912540"," We start to discuss the loss or momentum."
"1912540","1915140"," Let's say momentum and velocity. "
"1917480","1920400"," These are sometimes you'll hear me talk about."
"1923160","1932540"," One of the things that a retail trader has is they can enter and exit the market much faster than"
"1932540","1933480"," a bank can."
"1934140","1941220"," It takes time for the banks to exit the markets in an orderly or unorderly fashion. "
"1943080","1949460"," Okay, and they're also normally late market participants, especially bear or bull markets."
"1950000","1952440"," They will not enter the markets until late."
"1952760","1955120"," They will scream, which we saw, right?"
"1956080","1960920"," Marco and Jaime recently said that they were wrong and all this other stuff. "
"1962560","1966920"," On the market in that they now know that we didn't get into the recession."
"1966980","1968460"," We got a soft landing, all that kind of stuff."
"1968600","1970460"," That was some articles that came out earlier in the week. "
"1970460","1971940"," But here I want you to see this."
"1972080","1974340"," You've got a velocity right now to the upside."
"1974380","1975000"," Do you see it?"
"1975420","1979080"," It has not flattened yet as of yet has it. "
"1979580","1985720"," And there's an idea here from people that it will begin to flatten that momentum to the upside will"
"1985720","1989620"," begin to flatten out, which has not happened yet."
"1990180","1990920"," It has not happened."
"1991500","1994040"," But there's an idea that it will begin to flatten out. "
"1994240","1999660"," But the key point to this too is even if it does flatten out or flatten its trajectory."
"1999660","2002380"," So maybe that's not being as clear here."
"2002900","2004920"," So you've got this trajectory here. "
"2005720","2009340"," Even if you were to just go just a little bit flatter, right?"
"2009760","2014580"," It doesn't necessarily translate into bloodbath to the depths of hell."
"2015340","2017060"," You get more range expansion."
"2017820","2018240"," Okay. "
"2018980","2024380"," Now, depending upon that range expansion, depending upon how it forms, if you get something like"
"2024380","2028160"," this right here, it's not so negative, right?"
"2028160","2031980"," And you still have some of this steepness in the top side."
"2032460","2036660"," Yeah, you'll get some lows, but then you're going to get some major highs along with it."
"2037320","2040880"," This is that precursor to late market's bull action. "
"2041720","2045620"," I want to draw your attention though to one other key point here."
"2046100","2049280"," And I'm going to change this to spy specifically."
"2050460","2052780"," Now, I want you to pay attention to. "
"2053580","2063520"," I want you to pay attention to higher timeframes and be watching a divergence in"
"2063520","2069360"," the quarterly, the monthly and specifically the weekly velocity."
"2070080","2073900"," If you start to see a divergence in this stuff, right?"
"2074880","2075940"," It can matter."
"2076480","2076920"," It can. "
"2077239","2080719"," It can make a difference in if we are about to roll or not."
"2080719","2083900"," There's a little bit of a monthly divergence going on here."
"2084000","2085280"," You can see that right now, right?"
"2085400","2086340"," We came all the way down here. "
"2086679","2089719"," This is, but this is back in October of 2023."
"2090060","2091940"," And it's just starting to build right now."
"2091980","2093159"," Do you see it weekly?"
"2093620","2094420"," Just starting to build. "
"2094820","2100820"," We're entering a time period where, yeah, we're looking for a correction, but the monthly is just"
"2100820","2101480"," getting going."
"2101940","2103560"," We're seeing this as well."
"2104600","2106600"," 2324 looking to go up as well. "
"2106600","2112240"," As long as these two right now look OK, we can still roll down and weekly and continue higher."
"2112700","2118540"," I don't see anything right now where we have a topping pattern of any kind in either of these"
"2118540","2121260"," velocities signifying a top in the marketplace."
"2121260","2126220"," If anything, this is showing that we likely have many more months to go. "
"2126940","2132440"," Many more months to go, at least on spy for the for the upside, not the downside."
"2132440","2136820"," It's not like we've peaked out on monthly and quarterly velocity."
"2137700","2139520"," You can actually see that stuff. "
"2140200","2141880"," See this peaking over here."
"2142320","2143680"," I want you to see this right here."
"2144300","2145780"," OK, see that peaking?"
"2146520","2151440"," And then this this divergence right here right before we begin to roll. "
"2151880","2153300"," You see all this right?"
"2153420","2155820"," It's nice, nice little big stuff like this."
"2155860","2157900"," We don't have any of that happening right now."
"2157960","2160500"," None of that has happened as of right now. "
"2160500","2163320"," So even this we even had a break of the weekly yet."
"2163340","2164780"," See this weekly line that's orange line?"
"2165140","2166500"," No break of that orange line."
"2166660","2168400"," So no precursor down below in velocity. "
"2168960","2170420"," No precursor on the weekly."
"2171300","2174140"," So as of right now, if you're looking for something like this, we ain't got none of it."
"2174320","2175520"," None of it right now. "
"2175620","2176880"," Not even the setup for it."
"2178260","2179700"," Let me go back over to the 30."
"2180040","2185280"," So if you're looking for that, if you're if you're out there positing that that's going to take"
"2185280","2188220"," place or happen or anything like that, right?"
"2188220","2190140"," I feel like, hey, man, this is going to totally happen. "
"2190300","2191180"," We're totally doomed."
"2191180","2191940"," Everything is horrible."
"2192920","2194100"," I'm not seeing it. "
"2194200","2198120"," You're talking about the daily trigger crossing the weekly trigger."
"2198460","2199560"," We haven't seen that."
"2199920","2205160"," We haven't seen velocity at all topping yet in this marketplace. "
"2205960","2208020"," We also know that the elephants haven't left the room."
"2208260","2214380"," So even if we even if we go down, the market's not showing it yet."
"2215260","2219560"," Even if velocity is done, even if CNBC is calling it. "
"2221400","2223920"," I saw them calling it on CNBC this week."
"2224500","2226300"," They said, uh, the run is over."
"2227300","2231980"," Uh, momentum has left all of these mag seven stocks and the market's going to crash. "
"2232600","2237100"," You know, if these stocks like NVDA just fall in line with cues, what?"
"2237240","2239760"," It's just not cocaine fuel or it's just not crack field."
"2240320","2241800"," It's just now cocaine field."
"2241800","2245520"," So be wary of what they're telling you out there. "
"2245940","2252140"," There is no sign of momentum letting up at this point, especially on higher timeframes."
"2252660","2254540"," There is no sign in price."
"2254960","2257840"," There is no sign in the daily trigger crossing the weekly trigger. "
"2258080","2260880"," If anything, I could be on board with a correction."
"2261780","2268100"," But I am not on board on, um, velocity, momentum, uh, daily crossing over weekly."
"2268440","2269340"," None of that stuff. "
"2269340","2275700"," And even when we get all of that stuff, even when you see a divergence in price versus velocity,"
"2275700","2276840"," right?"
"2277080","2280300"," Even when you see that divergence, we likely will squeeze higher."
"2280720","2287360"," And even if we do roll and even if you do see the daily trigger, break below the weekly trigger,"
"2287760","2293780"," you are almost always offered an orderly exit to the market."
"2293780","2299120"," You are given so much time by these elephants in the marketplace. "
"2299340","2300960"," It is ridiculous."
"2302640","2304620"," You want to see an orderly exit?"
"2304940","2306560"," You want to see something that made people cry?"
"2307620","2308580"," You want me to show it to you?"
"2308720","2309320"," I'll show you make it."
"2309360","2310100"," You want to see people cry?"
"2312000","2313480"," I'll show you right now. "
"2315540","2317180"," Talk about sauce, right?"
"2317920","2319220"," You want to see something gnarly?"
"2323060","2323840"," Does anybody?"
"2324640","2325600"," Anybody out there?"
"2325600","2330560"," Remember, you might not have remembered."
"2331480","2332320"," Hold on here."
"2335870","2337330"," You might not have remembered. "
"2339430","2340550"," But I'll tell you what."
"2341570","2343430"," You want to see something painful?"
"2344370","2345730"," You want to see something terrible?"
"2347590","2348910"," Imagine being a bull."
"2353490","2358530"," Imagine being a bull and sitting on bentwits. "
"2360850","2362890"," We roll over here, right?"
"2364130","2367170"," And all you hear is doom, doom, doom."
"2368710","2370370"," You own S&P 500."
"2371650","2373150"," And down here, this is your pain trade. "
"2373150","2375850"," And you're like, oh, shit."
"2376490","2380510"," You're watching all your gains, all the shit you made, all the money you made."
"2380950","2381690"," You panic sell. "
"2382270","2383110"," And what did they give you?"
"2383470","2385490"," One more confirmation."
"2386950","2387730"," Right up here."
"2389050","2393510"," Can you imagine selling your holdings down here and then watching this up here?"
"2394370","2398370"," Now you might say, a cap that's hindsight 2020 vision right there. "
"2398470","2399150"," No, it isn't."
"2399490","2401430"," You're given the orderly exit here."
"2401430","2406650"," You exit the market appropriately and you still would not enter the market. "
"2407150","2411310"," Unless you had a successful trade higher than the previous high, right?"
"2411770","2413150"," We talk about that all the time."
"2413510","2419350"," And then we also always talk about the confirmation that we're going higher again in price."
"2420710","2421050"," Right?"
"2421230","2422110"," So think about this. "
"2422470","2423890"," I want you to look at this specifically."
"2424650","2425650"," Doom and gloom, right?"
"2425950","2426850"," Doom, doom, doom, doom."
"2427610","2428250"," You sell. "
"2429190","2430350"," Here, where's your chance to exit?"
"2430350","2434510"," Now you might say, hey, Captain, I would have stayed long here, bro, if we didn't go up."
"2434670","2435270"," No, you would not."
"2435750","2437590"," You would get out in an orderly fashion. "
"2437850","2442590"," You would let price show you the way higher before you got back in again."
"2442590","2443230"," Make sense?"
"2443770","2449190"," If price rolls down and continues to the downside, you were given the opportunity to exit the"
"2449190","2451270"," market in an orderly fashion."
"2451890","2452810"," Orderly fashion. "
"2453430","2455810"," This could be a one minute chart, five minute chart."
"2456130","2456510"," Doesn't matter."
"2456730","2458650"," How many times have you seen me on this show?"
"2458650","2461870"," Take a zero date, and I'm like, yeah, I'm going to buy that dip. "
"2461990","2463270"," We go up here and we start to reject."
"2463850","2464450"," And what do I do?"
"2464570","2465350"," I don't cut my losses."
"2465810","2467250"," We get blasted to the downside. "
"2468090","2469770"," These are on smaller timeframes."
"2470130","2471770"," This is a daily time frame."
"2472230","2473750"," This is the roll back then. "
"2474230","2478770"," You are always afforded an orderly exit from the market."
"2478970","2480570"," You're given that chance to get out."
"2481090","2482410"," So you exit orderly, right?"
"2482870","2484770"," I always tell you guys, your stops are down here. "
"2486230","2486750"," Right?"
"2486930","2491070"," But you don't execute them stops until we come back up."
"2491790","2492010"," Right?"
"2492210","2493710"," This is where you execute the stop."
"2494030","2494670"," Make sense?"
"2497890","2499730"," And that's really fucked up looking. "
"2500230","2504870"," But if price were to continue higher, back check and confirm and start to make its way, you could"
"2504870","2506910"," then re-enter the trade to the upside."
"2508270","2508890"," Soul crushing."
"2510530","2512670"," Literally soul crushing for people. "
"2512670","2519770"," We have people on the show that were along the markets heading into the roll over into 20."
"2519770","2524930"," It was that 2022 that were like long, like I'm long the market a million dollars."
"2525250","2527190"," I just sold and lost 300 K."
"2527690","2530990"," And then I watched that shit come right back up to where I was. "
"2531530","2533250"," You want to you want to feel bad?"
"2533730","2535170"," You want to feel horrible?"
"2535730","2539950"," That was a horrible feeling for a lot of people at that time period."
"2539950","2541250"," So right now, I'm not seeing it."
"2541470","2542270"," And that's that argument. "
"2542450","2547050"," That momentum that has momentum left has velocity slowed down."
"2547410","2549530"," Are we going to crash the market?"
"2550030","2551590"," All that conversation out there?"
"2552630","2553770"," Nothing showing it."
"2554190","2557290"," I know bears hate me, man. "
"2561470","2566730"," People on fence are like, I see people on fence with like, you're such a fucking bear."
"2566730","2569170"," I'm like, I'm like that person definitely doesn't watch my show."
"2569450","2571470"," Like that person does not watch my show. "
"2572590","2575370"," So yeah, is there is there a slowing and velocity momentum?"
"2575930","2576150"," No."
"2576770","2577950"," Does it happen fast?"
"2578550","2578950"," No."
"2579550","2585110"," When it does happen, you are given ample, ample warning of it. "
"2585550","2592730"," And you are given further ability to exit in an orderly fashion."
"2592730","2597750"," And look for some kind of a hint if we're going to continue up."
"2598130","2603810"," Or if that is if you're rejected at that moment where bowls are weak, fires are weak. "
"2604290","2604910"," Everybody's scared."
"2605690","2607630"," And what is sentiment at that moment, right?"
"2607810","2611670"," And sentiment at that time was in the shitter."
"2612090","2612810"," Do you remember it?"
"2613010","2616570"," That sentiment at that time was in the shitter. "
"2617910","2619470"," Do we have any of that right now?"
"2619810","2620430"," Sentiment in the shitter?"
"2620810","2620890"," No."
"2620890","2622610"," Yeah, none of that stuff."
"2622910","2623590"," Think about that stuff. "
"2623710","2625250"," All that basic simple stuff."
"2625750","2632730"," While people out there are trying to explain to you complicated shit that has nothing to fucking do"
"2632730","2635230"," with the fucking price of the stock market."
"2636710","2637310"," Nothing. "
"2638610","2639210"," Zero."
"2641650","2643370"," Didn't go out there and write you shit."
"2643370","2644690"," They pull out a fucking book. "
"2644690","2646410"," The source."
"2646950","2652950"," They pull out some obscure white paper and like we're just going to copy paste a bunch of these big"
"2652950","2654170"," word scientists use."
"2654410","2656170"," They're not going to know what the fuck I'm talking about. "
"2656470","2660810"," But it has nothing at all to do with the price of the stock market."
"2661590","2663390"," And that is why you follow price."
"2673070","2674090"," All right, I'm done. "
"2675330","2677050"," Trading right now into."
"2678370","2679310"," Excuse me."
"2679470","2680310"," R2. "
"2680730","2684110"," Trying to break above and smash into five five."
"2686150","2693290"," Fourteen fifty seven with an upside price target of five fifteen ninety nine for the bulls."
"2695230","2704070"," Yeah, I got to do it. "
"2704950","2706450"," Never fails to amaze me."
"2706510","2707890"," And then they're going to fint to it for too long."
"2707890","2709610"," And I'm like these fuckers are out here. "
"2709750","2710770"," They're like dropping bombs."
"2711510","2713130"," Like you can't argue with that."
"2713610","2715830"," And they're like, well, you know, captain's just dumb. "
"2716130","2719550"," And I'm like, I'll be dumb all fucking day long as long as I'm making money."
"2720090","2721850"," You can assign this shit to whatever you want."

"2889080","2896240"," I said it's always sucked as an indicator of recession."
"2897360","2902080"," It is one of the worst indicators of a recession."
"2903540","2913440"," It is the most unreliable data points, macro data points on if the market"
"2913440","2914240"," is going to crash. "
"2915320","2918160"," It's reliable about 60% of the time."

"2924000","2925740"," That's right, front row."
"2928420","2932320"," You guys that have been here since the beginning, remember these conversations, don't you?"
"2934440","2935820"," It's not that it's unreliable. "
"2936300","2938180"," It's never been reliable."
"2939600","2940960"," Do you know what is reliable?"
"2941540","2942100"," Do you want to know?"
"2942460","2944240"," I've already told y'all, why don't you tell me?"
"2946140","2947780"," Employment or unemployment?"

"2959480","2960000"," That's what the rates are."
"2960540","2961040"," That's it. "
"2961800","2963740"," And it's specifically unemployment."

"3050910","3052510"," He's really smart too, much smarter than I am."
"3053370","3055310"," But I know exactly what the fuck matters. "
"3056210","3065890"," Employment, jobs, big time, a bounce off of 2% inflation, a front"
"3065890","3067330"," running of bed rate cuts."
"3068590","3071250"," That shit's like 80% of the time, right?"

"3382600","3385360"," The consolidation of the rip up to that 5175."
"3391790","3393150"," I love those transitions. "
"3394410","3396070"," I met people hate those transitions."
"3396350","3398690"," They're like it's not that the goddamn transitions kept."
"3403640","3404880"," No I think it's cranking. "
"3405460","3408620"," The one thing that's dangerous about this though is the more violent it is."
"3408800","3410680"," We know what it usually comes back and doesn't hold."
"3411360","3412700"," That's the only thing I could say about this. "
"3413300","3414820"," The faster that it goes up."
"3415360","3416600"," The faster it comes off like this."
"3417320","3418840"," The more violent the reversal is. "
"3419500","3419740"," Usually."
"3420420","3421440"," More time we spend there."
"3422160","3424660"," The less violent the reversal is. "
"3425080","3426100"," So yeah I'd be careful of that."
"3426460","3426740"," Absolutely."
