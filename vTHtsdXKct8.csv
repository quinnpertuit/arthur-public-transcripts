"64239","65280"," Good morning out there."
"65400","65760"," How are y'all doing?"
"65760","66640"," We got a great weekend."
"70650","72210"," Dude, I needed some rest. "
"73950","79270"," I had to take it and you know, it's funny too is my good morning to all of you out"
"79270","79490"," there."
"79930","80630"," Hope you're all doing well."
"80810","82010"," Hope you all have a great weekend. "
"82770","84210"," Stress free weekend."
"86450","89070"," Nice month of going straight up, basically, right?"
"90210","91230"," Well, we had a bunch of back and forth."
"91290","91890"," It was very stressful. "
"93630","96550"," Overall, overall, it was huge stress."
"98510","101510"," Turn that off for just joining us."
"102210","103190"," Hope you had a great weekend. "
"105590","107290"," Talk about a stressful month, right?"
"107590","110410"," The month was up down, up down, right?"
"110970","113210"," 30 points, 70 points, 100 points, up down, up down."
"114190","117570"," Almost like we were trying to be shaken out to get where we are, right?"
"118650","121810"," Could have just, could have just placed a call."
"121890","124090"," Spread and walked away, right?"
"125730","129690"," Not paid attention to anything on the media, social media, news, whatever. "
"132020","138280"," And it's funny because on Friday, you guys tipped me on Friday."
"138280","144140"," So I took the wife and the kids out and made sure that the kids spend a bunch of that"
"144140","145920"," money on the kids so they can have a good Friday."
"146700","148380"," For all the hard work they do for you guys, right?"
"148500","151660"," They do a bunch of stuff in the background for the show. "
"154000","158480"," And it was like, put the phone down and put the, I mean, I get on Twitter here and they're"
"158480","162920"," trying to sneak away, but put the phone down, stop talking to people, and just spent some time with"
"162920","163180"," family."
"163800","168600"," And it was, it was nice to be able to do that because I've been disconnecting from my family."
"169360","171620"," This month was very, very stressful. "
"171980","173560"," I assume for bears to polls."
"173780","174240"," I don't think it matters."
"174500","176520"," If you're a market participant, this month was stressful. "
"178980","183190"," Well, we got through it, right?"
"183310","183930"," You powered through it."
"184430","185890"," Well, hopefully you had a nice long weekend."
"187210","189870"," You've got Tesla up in the pre market, up a buck. "
"191810","199210"," And we're going to do, let me just first look and see who's joining us this morning."
"199370","199870"," Let's do that first."
"200070","200570"," Good morning, McClac. "
"201230","208490"," Gary, good morning, Jay Cortina, Liam, Yolting, Harushi, Andre, Ross walks, Lisa Cullen, Sharaf,"
"208770","209450"," Pinky, good morning."
"210730","219030"," Caleb, DJ, D Crosby, indices, we trust, Ross Walker, baby, 10, Andre, Will M, Sweet Al, Dean,"
"219590","223530"," Johnny Moog, Grubster, Ryan Morse, good morning to all of you this morning."
"225350","228170"," I was assuming some more people will join us later once they wake up. "
"228730","230910"," I know I usually don't show up from 9.30 or 10, right?"
"231650","233350"," We have some stuff to look at this morning."
"234350","237670"," So that you can have an idea of what's going on here."
"239910","241370"," So we know we'll start here. "
"242510","243570"," So here's Friday, right?"
"245290","247010"," Right around here, it's like take profit."
"247250","250930"," If you're a new trader or something like that, there's no reason not to take some profit up here."
"251370","254650"," We knew that we could go up here in the Friday and the day. "
"256149","257630"," And we traded this right here, right?"
"258730","260050"," We re-entered again."
"260050","265110"," And career somebody, I forget his name right now, top my head, but he was like, oh, get out of"
"265110","265390"," your calls."
"266150","267230"," And so we all did, right?"
"269270","271890"," We had to close it wrapped up yesterday or on Friday. "
"274150","276870"," And we talked about being weak on into Monday."
"277290","280550"," The reason being for this is because we've got FOMC."
"281050","282130"," We've got a bunch of stuff, right?"
"282230","284850"," We've got an FOMC rate decision. "
"286430","288070"," We're kind of top of the key."
"288290","289310"," We have end of the month coming."
"289650","292650"," So there's a little bit for the next two days, a couple of things going on. "
"292710","293730"," We've got the FOMC, right?"
"294450","294970"," We've got earnings."
"297530","300790"," We're at, you know, we're kind of over sold or over bought right now."
"301270","302130"," And we've got end of month. "
"302830","310570"," So the next two days specifically, you kind of already know that it being a monthly OPEX that"
"310570","311130"," there's a PIN."
"312570","316830"," There's not not 100% guaranteed, but there's likely a PIN."
"317030","321330"," There's likely like a ton of calls, a ton of puts, and they want to print that shit in a"
"321330","321710"," month. "
"322210","323710"," Most months, that's what they want to do."
"325170","328870"," And so do I expect that into this Tuesday?"
"329230","329430"," I do."
"329750","330670"," I do expect that. "
"332530","335650"," Do I think we have a market crash today or over the weekend?"
"335910","335990"," No."
"337790","338590"," I don't."
"338690","339470"," I honestly don't. "
"339990","343870"," Not these two days and not with a big earnings week coming out."
"344470","345510"," I'm not expecting it at least."
"345970","347070"," We'll see if it happens. "
"347910","349550"," We've got a ton to go over the next two days."
"349730","352150"," We have a bunch of stuff the next two days to look at."
"352890","357130"," Some stuff I talked about on FinTwit over the weekend. "
"357770","361830"," We're going to take a look at that stuff so you guys know more than other people know."
"362670","369170"," I want you to have a firm understanding of traders ears perking up like a prairie dog, right?"
"369410","370630"," Like like an animal in the water."
"370810","373670"," If any of you have a hike in the woods like like true back back in. "
"373990","382270"," Well, any of you that are hunters out there, any of you that spend naturists, photographers, anyone"
"382270","386190"," that spent any real time in the wilderness or in the desert."
"387730","396710"," Anywhere where wildlife is knows that trader is almost almost like a combat vet or almost like a"
"396710","397630"," wild animal, right?"
"397890","402090"," That they they go about their business up down sideways, whatever."
"402550","407130"," And then if something is unnatural, they start paying attention. "
"407130","407990"," It's like a prairie dog."
"408170","411090"," Stick their head up and they're looking around going, wait a minute."
"411090","416450"," I just want to make sure that, you know, we're actually going to roll over here, right?"
"416690","421250"," For specific specific to this situation where we are. "
"422350","424550"," There are some there are some contrarian."
"427300","432500"," Things going on underneath the surface of the stock market is making a trader pause right now."
"433200","436760"," And I put made a big poster earlier last week to everybody. "
"436760","445220"," If you're bearable, it doesn't matter that there's a leg coming a leg L E G a leg is coming."
"447040","452300"," And you want to be on the right side of that leg to some extent or at least have some"
"452300","452640"," awareness."
"453880","456080"," But there's a leg about to happen, right?"
"456680","458700"," You don't really want to be caught on the wrong side of that leg. "
"460360","467020"," There's so much money there on that leg that you want to be positioned properly or at least I do."
"467100","467880"," I don't know about you guys."
"468220","468700"," I do. "
"469160","474320"," And unlike other tops this in 2022, 2023."
"476500","479600"," Screaming to at least pay attention to the sideways."
"480280","482920"," Or the up move to at least look for. "
"484160","487100"," Signs because you don't want to get you know, it's funny if you look back."
"488200","489520"," Look at this month here."
"489580","489800"," Okay. "
"490240","492220"," I want you to realize that."
"493380","494860"," You guys already remember, right?"
"494980","496020"," We traded this up right here."
"496540","497800"," We came down here. "
"499060","504140"," And I know it's funny because someone asked on fin to it yesterday about."
"505660","507920"," So are someone mentioned on fin to it?"
"509240","510760"," Well, let me just look at the post that I made."
"511080","512200"," So I made a post on fin to it. "
"512340","513340"," I think yesterday and I said."
"515280","517880"," I said, what did I say?"
"520360","521200"," Let me see here."
"521400","522179"," Let me see what I said here. "
"524760","531260"," Where did I say this?"
"533620","534500"," What did I say?"
"539180","541400"," I said, I said even higher now."
"541540","543740"," I said crazy to think a post of this on January 7th."
"543840","546380"," Crazy to think the spy could drop 5% today and still be an uptrend. "
"546700","549420"," 14% drop would wouldn't even give you lows, right?"
"549640","552560"," Bears want 20% more down from the lows as a high low target."
"553160","554080"," That implies that."
"559640","563200"," You know, down here bears wanted another 20% right. "
"564600","567660"," And when we were in here, we have we have like short term memory."
"567660","569320"," In the market."
"569320","571040"," We have very short term memory. "
"571320","575140"," Just a month ago, we were talking about 3,200, 2,800 down here, right?"
"576240","578060"," And you remember that argument, right?"
"578280","582440"," Then this argument in here, do you guys remember when if you guys go back on YouTube, you fucking"
"582440","584360"," go on YouTube to find anybody's videos in here, right?"
"585540","587980"," It was like this is a bear sign right here."
"588180","589220"," Bloodbath's got coming, right?"
"589580","590220"," That didn't happen."
"590900","595040"," And a lot of people got smart traders, smart investors got caught in this. "
"595620","597160"," And we blasted higher, right?"
"599340","602880"," And we're kind of in that same situation again, believe it or not."
"603700","605320"," Where you don't want to get caught."
"607460","611480"," Even if you come down here and then blast north, you want to be able to take the leg, take"
"611480","612800"," the leg, take the leg down. "
"614440","616540"," And, you know, we have short term memories, man."
"616840","618020"," It's like a month ago, right?"
"619160","620220"," Just like a month ago."
"620520","623580"," So, I mean, this is 12, 16. "
"625440","629280"," This is four months ago in October, right?"
"629680","634100"," So you just have all these, all this previous time periods."
"634220","635520"," You guys remember this shit, right?"
"636240","636960"," Let's look at this."
"639240","639720"," Right?"
"640220","641780"," Yeah, who barely, right?"
"642140","643080"," Perfect, time to perfect. "
"643540","644360"," Yeah, who barely?"
"645300","647060"," And boom, trap."
"648340","648660"," Right there."
"648780","649340"," That's the trap. "
"651860","652220"," Right?"
"652220","653600"," There was a trap right there."
"654000","655480"," You can't say it wasn't."
"655660","658520"," Yeah, I don't want to hear shit from anybody saying it wasn't. "
"658580","659140"," That was a trap."
"659960","661320"," That fucked a lot of people up."
"661920","663840"," The whole thought was, we're done. "
"664020","664740"," We're going back down."
"664860","672420"," We're going to go see 36 here at 32, you know, 36, 33, 600, 3, 200, 20, 100, whatever."
"672520","673800"," Matter of fact, we're thinking that down here. "
"675180","675740"," Hey, buddy."
"676260","677780"," How you doing dogs here?"
"678640","682720"," You know, so I just don't want to hear it at this point from people on social media, but I"
"682720","684320"," don't want to hear it at this point from the news media."
"685700","686760"," So it's important. "
"688540","694500"," It's important that, you know, in the next couple of days you've got, you get the, the, the plot or"
"694500","698080"," the picture that I put up for the stream is like peanuts and popcorn right out of the game."
"698900","701400"," Here's your puts, here's your calls, here, place your bets, everybody."
"702480","707260"," And to me, this next couple of days is just a matter of horse trading, right?"
"708180","709760"," Marketmaker is making a plan for you. "
"710460","711620"," You're going to place your bets."
"712600","716980"," And I'm assuming that you come into Wednesday and it's going to be all be priced in, right?"
"717080","717920"," For this range expansion."
"718560","725120"," We talked about this range expansion, expected range expansion into the 1st of the month, February"
"725120","727780"," 1st to the 3rd to see some range expansion. "
"727780","732800"," But this is like that time where bets are being placed, right?"
"733000","734000"," To take your position."
"734000","737260"," And what I'm saying trying to say is that I don't know, man."
"737840","741560"," I'm not really interested to be honest with you me for today and tomorrow. "
"742160","744180"," I'm not really looking to take a position here."
"745680","751680"," I don't mind day trading this, but I'd rather see like some real work."
"752040","752500"," You know what I mean?"
"754460","756720"," Directional bias and trade this kind of stuff, right?"
"757460","759140"," And then get some, get some confirmation. "
"760120","761840"," I don't want to be down in here and have some."
"761840","763940"," I don't care what the fed news is."
"764300","765760"," Honestly, I can find fuck. "
"766140","767840"," Sorry for swearing, but I could care less."
"768920","771280"," If we blast down from that, right?"
"771440","773140"," But then we come back up and stay in trend."
"773620","774680"," I care about that. "
"776680","781720"," I care about if the fed news comes out and we blast up and trade back down and start to"
"781720","783280"," roll care about that."
"784000","784940"," Does that make sense?"
"786320","791660"," I care about if we have the fed meeting and we blast down it at home."
"791660","794760"," It holds and sticks a few days later and we start blasting down. "
"795100","796280"," I care about that trade."
"797980","800680"," But this nonsense in here is built for only one thing."
"800840","802140"," It's to take your money away from you. "
"802220","804960"," I promise or so far nothing said otherwise."
"805920","809400"," Then this is meant for, you know, if I own the spy, I'm going to try to slay some vol."
"811240","812320"," That's what I'm going to try to do. "
"812400","814740"," If you're a bear, that's my whole job right here, right?"
"814860","816560"," If you're a bear, then I own the spy."
"817420","818720"," I want to fucking sell vol to you."
"819500","820800"," I want you to buy the vol. "
"820920","821780"," I want you to drink the Kool-Aid."
"823020","823780"," Does that make sense?"
"824100","827400"," If you're a bull and you're trying to buy some vol, I want to sell it to you."
"828040","830500"," So that's my thought process for these next couple days. "
"831360","835980"," There's a load up, pay a premium for it, and I'm going to get paid no matter what."
"836160","838440"," That's me thinking like a rich person, right?"
"838680","839880"," If I'm a rich person, that's what I'm thinking."
"841500","842340"," You get me?"
"847280","848740"," Good morning, everybody out there. "
"848840","849560"," Hope you're all doing well."
"854060","856600"," So that's my take on where we are right now."
"856820","857620"," That's like the baseline. "
"857960","860420"," That's the base case for the next couple days."
"862040","863780"," We're going to look at the spy real quick."
"864440","867020"," I'm going to start with the spy that we're going to go to the Tesla. "
"867220","867880"," We're going to go to the Apple."
"868860","870100"," Get your notepads out."
"870600","871560"," Get a piece of paper out. "
"872360","873040"," I don't know."
"873120","875140"," Get another screener open, whatever it is you do."
"881340","882860"," You want to see something fascinating?"
"884720","885680"," Check this out. "
"891800","893020"," Get your notepads out."
"893880","899590"," Look at that big little red bar up there."
"903200","903980"," Look at that thing. "
"905580","907760"," That's like the bull's blood."
"907940","911400"," The bull's that didn't sell on Friday are like, please Lord Jesus just give me."
"911740","914180"," It's giving me a chance to sell out, sell up here. "
"916360","917380"," They're like, oh, please."
"919020","921660"," Just let me sell and you get bears and bulls."
"921900","922780"," They're like, just buy some books. "
"924020","926000"," It's funny to watch all this get front run."
"926760","929800"," You know, it's hilarious to watch this get front run."
"933560","936220"," Okay, so we're going to talk about some more important stuff though. "
"936580","937960"," We always want to be thinking ahead."
"938600","939940"," We always want to be reacting."
"940780","943920"," We always want to know if a move happens, what do we do?"
"944800","948800"," So we're going to talk about that this morning starting out or closing a month out. "
"951550","952970"," And what we want to see happening here."
"953110","953210"," Okay."
"956290","957390"," So this is the spy. "
"959430","961890"," We're going to we're going to delve into what this means."
"965140","966940"," What this actually means right here."
"968520","970700"," Later on the broadcast week. "
"970880","971700"," I could tell you this."
"971880","973340"," Okay, that in the background."
"974540","975840"," See this line right here. "
"976800","977820"," This one right here."
"977940","978940"," This dark blue one."
"979260","981060"," This is a daily moving average. "
"981060","981540"," Okay."
"983340","985500"," And it's creeping up underneath the weekly."
"987740","989960"," And monthly going back years. "
"991280","996320"," And I would really like to see the market kind of sell down here and see what the reaction is."
"996460","999080"," My thought is the next two days we're going to fuck around over here."
"999840","1001780"," We're not going to interact with this stuff just yet. "
"1002660","1004940"," This is going to lead the way for us."
"1005620","1008280"," This cluster right here is going to lead the way for us."
"1008640","1010100"," If we're going to get bearish or bullish. "
"1010940","1012800"," As you can see right now we're still bullish, right?"
"1013080","1014840"," See on the spy we're still very bullish here."
"1015580","1017320"," Trend is still in the bull's favor."
"1018420","1019640"," Though right now currently. "
"1021600","1025200"," We are trading below the one minute to five minute and the hourly."
"1026540","1029200"," So I'm going to expect right now I'm expecting some weakness."
"1029579","1031099"," We are above the one minute right now. "
"1031859","1034040"," So bulls are technically in charge."
"1034880","1037680"," But I'm looking for some weakness with the hourly in the five minute above."
"1038200","1041140"," I would really like to see us trade down into Tuesday if possible. "
"1041740","1045660"," And try to get down here to this three ninety five three ninety four fifty."
"1045880","1046079"," Okay."
"1046319","1046780"," This is a spot. "
"1047420","1049900"," So how does how do we translate that to this morning?"
"1052100","1055860"," And what I'm going to do is I'm going to post up and you can see this on book map"
"1055860","1056320"," as well."
"1056320","1057040"," See these guys."
"1057060","1058220"," See that big red bar up there. "
"1058640","1059400"," Big orange bar."
"1059600","1061880"," I'm going to place a little yellow box down here."
"1062560","1063520"," Just on the intraday. "
"1064020","1064460"," Right."
"1064800","1066040"," Right here in S1."
"1066240","1067080"," We know are below the pivot. "
"1067600","1068820"," So intraday negative gamma."
"1069860","1071540"," Put this little right yellow bar right here."
"1071640","1072660"," We know that some sellers are here. "
"1073480","1074320"," We know there are."
"1074980","1075220"," Right."
"1076580","1079600"," We'll go back and snap some lines for previous high kind of shit. "
"1079760","1080720"," Previous low kind of shit."
"1081920","1084380"," But then down here I got my green box."
"1084380","1086440"," This is where this is truly a fumble. "
"1087260","1088460"," What I'm looking for."
"1088660","1091240"," I would love to see between today and tomorrow."
"1092680","1096620"," I would love to see some kind of like sellers here. "
"1097340","1098900"," Put buyers get all bared up."
"1099820","1101120"," And then some kind of like."
"1102140","1104140"," Reversion to 400 maybe. "
"1105940","1108340"," Or four oh six zero and SPX."
"1109260","1110700"," For the clothes on Tuesday."
"1111100","1111640"," That's end of month. "
"1111640","1113940"," And then you get pinned."
"1114440","1115940"," And the."
"1116740","1116940"," The. "
"1119740","1122080"," The boiler rooms coming on Wednesday."
"1122560","1124800"," And they day trade all this bullshit on Wednesday."
"1127020","1130120"," And then we're all waiting on Wednesday for the decision. "
"1130500","1130620"," Right."
"1131480","1133280"," So that's that's kind of my take here."
"1133840","1135140"," On the spy at least. "
"1136580","1140040"," Now if we stay up if we stay above you see the blue line."
"1140040","1140260"," Right."
"1140360","1142500"," When we open this morning if we stay above the blue line. "
"1143160","1144840"," We can trade this all day long."
"1144860","1146600"," We'll trade this until we meet some resistance."
"1147340","1149460"," If it sells back down we'll pick it back up again. "
"1149660","1150340"," You guys know the drill."
"1151240","1151360"," Right."
"1151640","1154240"," But as taking a long position here short or long. "
"1154780","1155900"," Really not the thing to be doing."
"1157680","1160080"," I feel like this is all trap the next couple of days."
"1160080","1160500"," The trap. "
"1161000","1161880"," And as a bear."
"1162060","1164580"," I'm going to if you're a bear joining us I'm going to give you your."
"1164760","1166160"," I'm going to give you your levels for. "
"1167160","1169040"," How far down is to send it."
"1169340","1170700"," And then where to take profit."
"1171240","1173420"," And then each stage for a bear. "
"1173980","1176300"," To get more bearish and bearish and bearish."
"1176460","1178140"," If this is just a bear rally."
"1178680","1180720"," I'm going to go with the bulls this morning as well. "
"1181200","1185120"," And show you the underlying current on a much larger time scale."
"1185980","1189620"," And why I haven't haven't confirmed it yet."
"1190380","1193820"," But if you want to know if you want to know for myself. "
"1196120","1197220"," This is the."
"1203670","1205690"," If you if you want to know for myself."
"1206570","1207710"," I am about. "
"1209310","1211410"," If I had a scale of one to one hundred."
"1212830","1215170"," Where I had to say the bottom is in."
"1216270","1218470"," I'm waiting for just one more confirmation. "
"1219550","1221250"," I said one to a hundred but."
"1222510","1226590"," If that confirmation shows itself in the next few days."
"1227830","1232270"," I'm hoping that I can track the JPM caller and whatever the fed says. "
"1233510","1237290"," But in the background I want you to know if you're a bull or bear that."
"1238370","1242130"," I just have one more thing to see if I see what this one last thing I'm going to call"
"1242130","1242510"," a bottom."
"1243590","1248990"," I'm not calling it but I would if I was if I didn't it's weird if I didn't have a"
"1248990","1250110"," fucking YouTube channel or. "
"1250550","1252750"," Wasn't I been Twitter something it was just me."
"1253210","1255070"," If I was having a private conversation with you."
"1255790","1256910"," On a phone call. "
"1258290","1259550"," I would tell you the bottom is in."
"1260470","1261130"," If you want to know."
"1262590","1264350"," That with that would be some caveats. "
"1266110","1270930"," There are some caveats if we break certain things it would be a null statement."
"1272450","1276070"," But there's some I'm going to show you some things going I'm going to show you some things going"
"1276070","1276330"," back."
"1276890","1278850"," We'll go back thirty forty years if you want. "
"1279570","1280750"," Go back like thirty forty years."
"1281410","1285670"," We're pretty we're pretty much confirmed I'm pretty much confirming a bottom is in."
"1287690","1290410"," Unexpectedly to there have been some structural changes. "
"1291150","1292790"," That have taken place in September."
"1293930","1300610"," That it's hard to deny now if we break if something happens that we don't see maybe that the fed"
"1300610","1301070"," sees."
"1303190","1308530"," We break those things it would make that statement null and void so don't hold me to that statement"
"1308530","1308950"," yet. "
"1309670","1312890"," I'll show you what I'm looking for to make that statement valid."
"1314810","1317690"," What you know what personally what I'm looking for for that statement made valid."
"1318650","1320830"," It's wild to even consider that because. "
"1322690","1323830"," It didn't show."
"1324170","1327510"," It showed that we were coming into that decision in October."
"1328370","1332450"," But I had no belief that we were going to go up six seven percent to actually get there. "
"1333710","1335910"," In the month of January we did so."
"1337010","1342570"," I have to be open to that possibility at the bottom is in so we'll look at that this morning."
"1343510","1344790"," Now let's take a look at. "
"1345590","1350970"," I'm going to look at quickly look at Apple and then Tesla with you and then we'll chart out Apple"
"1350970","1351310"," and Tesla."
"1352370","1354230"," It's nine fifteen we got fifteen minutes left."
"1354870","1355950"," We're going to do Tesla first. "
"1357870","1359850"," I know that's going to rile people up right."
"1360250","1363990"," I know it because I know you guys trust some very famous people out there."
"1364850","1367030"," I know you got trust me. "
"1367170","1369950"," I want you to know that I follow the JPM caller."
"1370970","1371990"," I follow it."
"1372270","1372390"," So. "
"1374030","1377590"," I know that there's famous people out there that you trust."
"1377990","1380850"," I know that there are smarter people than me out there."
"1388480","1389600"," Look at Tesla. "
"1391800","1392320"," Okay."
"1392620","1393300"," So let's talk Tesla."
"1393300","1395040"," Let's Tesla talk. "
"1396100","1397040"," Let's look at Tesla."
"1401380","1402680"," So far bulls are winning."
"1403120","1405580"," You stay above the one minute which you are right now in Tesla. "
"1407180","1409460"," Price target hasn't changed on Tesla for me."
"1410120","1410740"," Five minutes."
"1411860","1414420"," You want to get your pads out ready?"
"1415800","1419120"," You want to hold above currently one seven eight oh four to remain bullish. "
"1422250","1425290"," If you are flat on Tesla want to make an entry on Tesla."
"1425290","1430670"," I would really like to see a test of one sixty six ninety four."
"1431630","1434850"," If you stay above one sixty six ninety four today. "
"1435690","1440790"," You're going to maintain a bullish perspective on Tesla."
"1442790","1445810"," For bullish for Tesla to turn bearish."
"1446790","1449430"," You're looking to trade under one forty four eleven. "
"1449850","1451790"," That's a structural change in Tesla."
"1451790","1452670"," So if you're a bear."
"1453990","1456470"," You're looking to get underneath the one and five minute today. "
"1457130","1458370"," And take it to the one hour."
"1458770","1461870"," If you are taking profit right take your money and run."
"1463310","1465430"," If we can get underneath this if you're a bear. "
"1466010","1468290"," You want to then take this trade down here right."
"1469030","1474290"," This is right at the one forty four level likely becoming higher like one forty five one forty six."
"1475130","1478750"," Now this would be a structural change in a bearish stance. "
"1480250","1484130"," If you if we break the daily on Tesla but otherwise."
"1486550","1491630"," You know this is where it gets crispy right when we're getting up here to this one ninety six level"
"1491630","1491930"," here."
"1492050","1495170"," I can assure you that even if we continue higher. "
"1496410","1498590"," I can assure you that bears are waiting here."
"1498990","1500670"," And I'll show you this in a regular chart."
"1501150","1502690"," So you can see where they're waiting. "
"1503490","1505910"," But I want you to tag this right here this one ninety six."
"1507210","1511930"," Even if we continue higher you're going to expect some kind of a bounce off here."
"1512070","1514630"," And I would expect a bounce off here. "
"1514710","1518810"," I would expect that we come up and try to trade this one ninety six."
"1519310","1520850"," Or just make an attempt for it."
"1521310","1522510"," Have bears try to step in. "
"1523090","1524810"," Send it back down right."
"1525130","1526830"," You see this one sixty eight one seventy."
"1527710","1530510"," And we're going to find if we have real support underneath there one seventy. "
"1531390","1532910"," We'll find out if we don't."
"1532910","1537370"," We're going to go back down and check down here at one forty eight probably one fifty at that"
"1537370","1537670"," point."
"1538750","1543370"," And see if we have firm structural support right now these are some critical things. "
"1544210","1547830"," For Tesla bulls and bears like is is."
"1549070","1554530"," Are we done with Tesla coming down right is the correction and Tesla over."
"1555190","1556710"," That's what we're leading up to here in Tesla. "
"1556710","1562770"," And that basically it speaks about the market as well right is the market done going down."
"1564090","1568910"," So these are some key levels for you to look at on Tesla we've got one ninety six fifteen."
"1569670","1573150"," We've got current prices at one seventy twenty nine. "
"1574210","1578470"," And then we've got one sixty two one sixty seven eighty two."
"1579230","1580670"," And one forty four eleven."
"1581150","1584890"," I will leave I'm going to try to believe Tesla up for you this morning. "
"1586450","1590210"," On a screener here so you can watch it if I was a bull on Tesla."
"1591030","1593970"," There's not enough that you know it's not enough take care to be eaten."
"1595290","1600150"," If you're if you're if you weren't long on Tesla down at one hundred one thirty five you kind of"
"1600150","1600610"," missed the boat. "
"1601350","1605890"," If you're looking for summary entry in Tesla it's probably one sixty eight."
"1605890","1611290"," Me as a bull I'd really like to buy one forty four one sixty and anything down here I'm interested"
"1611290","1614190"," to see what the what the interaction is right."
"1614630","1617190"," I love that trade right there that'd be a great trade. "
"1617850","1623890"," I wouldn't even mind this just coming down getting underneath the hourly and fading this down to"
"1623890","1628630"," one forty four and if we can actually start to consolidate and start to make move higher."
"1629150","1632030"," I would love this trade as well so this is where I'm looking for entry."
"1632030","1635670"," I do have underlying Tesla stock. "
"1636750","1642710"," I've got a hundred shares of Tesla from way way way lower and I'm looking for this on the on"
"1642710","1646510"," those shares but as far as like options that kind of stuff it's down here."
"1646670","1650770"," Now we're going to now look at Apple real quick before the open."
"1651510","1655070"," As I did I did a talk about Apple. "
"1656930","1662050"," And you can see right here on this hourly this is kind of like the Tesla and spy chart."
"1662470","1663830"," I love seeing this right."
"1664630","1667010"," I don't want to see a break here on Apple. "
"1667170","1670430"," I want to see Apple hold one forty four thirty one."
"1670930","1676090"," This is critical for Apple if Apple cannot hold one forty four twenty five on this open."
"1677150","1680530"," We're going to expect some downside in the spy and in Tesla. "
"1681170","1683130"," So this is probably the ticker I'm going to be watching this morning."
"1683610","1688550"," I said I'd be watching Tesla but in reality I want to see if the bears can get underneath this"
"1688550","1693250"," on Apple and take it back down to one thirty eight fifty."
"1694630","1699490"," I'm going to be watching this closely because this can this can decide if spies going to go down"
"1699490","1701850"," the next couple days and this is really what I want to see. "
"1701850","1704070"," See I really want to see spy like bleed down a little bit."
"1704510","1706850"," Get down to that three ninety four three ninety five."
"1707410","1712350"," And if Apple can provide the leg down for for spy I'm down for it. "
"1712610","1713670"," I'm hoping it happens."
"1714110","1716390"," I always like to buy ship cheap I don't like buying tops."
"1717150","1718390"," It's not really my thing. "
"1718730","1723770"," Sometimes I do and I usually get burned if I do so I'm going to be watching Apple closely this"
"1723770","1724010"," morning."
"1726540","1732360"," So I'm thinking that's what this has to do with my thought process is we're going to gap here and"
"1732360","1735220"," we're going to see if they try to sell Apple down."
"1735500","1740740"," I'm going to assume that Apple's in here trying to sell Apple down so that we can get we can"
"1740740","1744640"," get a lower price on spy and I like the idea of coming down here. "
"1745260","1747040"," Three ninety four three ninety five."
"1747540","1751060"," Now that doesn't mean it's going to happen we're going to watch Apple on Bell and see if it gets"
"1751060","1751280"," bought."
"1751280","1753000"," See if it starts gap and higher. "
"1753600","1757680"," And if it doesn't starts to if it starts to break that one forty four."
"1758360","1761620"," We'll we'll we'll draw we'll make a we'll do Apple real quick and Tesla."
"1765150","1766290"," Twenty minutes we got left. "
"1767370","1768250"," Nine minutes left."
"1768650","1769250"," So we'll look at Apple."
"1770550","1772390"," I'm going to delete the drawings from Apple. "
"1772850","1774090"," Lead all the drawings from Apple."
"1775850","1779430"," See how do I delete drawings here."
"1780530","1781730"," This chart here. "
"1782150","1783070"," We got lead off."
"1783390","1784910"," We'll do all the dog drawings on Apple."
"1785370","1786970"," We're really just looking for one thing right here. "
"1787590","1789530"," We want to know if there are buyers on Apple."
"1791690","1796190"," No, we're price one forty four forty three."
"1798570","1800050"," Right down here. "
"1802450","1805210"," We want to know if the buyers are here if buyers are not here."
"1807550","1809530"," We're likely going to sell down."
"1810650","1812370"," One thirty eight sixty four. "
"1814860","1816280"," You can draw these at home."
"1819560","1821200"," We'll we'll put this up."
"1824540","1825920"," Really all you need to know. "
"1826400","1827440"," I know it sounds crazy."
"1827980","1829840"," Don't even put levels and I don't even care what the levels."
"1830940","1833840"," One thing one thirty eight sixty four. "
"1835040","1836000"," Right down here."
"1836760","1838200"," That's really what I'm looking for."
"1839360","1843560"," If you wanted a target for a high place target on Apple. "
"1843900","1845040"," I'm going to give you some."
"1846140","1849660"," Probably a retest above here of just this previous high."
"1849900","1850860"," I meant I do that wrong. "
"1854580","1856580"," Make this yellow."
"1862250","1863290"," Man, look at that."
"1863570","1863990"," You just like. "

"3020790","3023270"," Here's your S three but I want I'm telling you right now."
"3023770","3026890"," I'm telling you if you're a Tesla bull you not want to be underneath this. "
"3027530","3028390"," Do not."
"3031990","3036330"," I'm going to tell you exactly if you're a Tesla bull you do not want to see."
"3038570","3039910"," You know some kind of. "
"3040690","3044930"," Some kind of rejection trading down the yellow box is what's mostly important."
"3045810","3045930"," Right."
"3046350","3049850"," This would be a trade right here for the bears but if you get underneath this like this. "
"3050610","3051310"," It's good night."
"3052190","3053110"," Four bulls."
"3053110","3057270"," So bulls do not want to see this right here. "
"3057270","3059190"," This is no bueno."
"3064070","3066510"," That's my skull my skull and crossbones."
"3067050","3068430"," You don't want to see that. "
"3069010","3071370"," You really don't want to see an early trend change either."
"3071750","3074410"," This is early trend change will lead to."
"3076990","3079450"," Downage probably for today and tomorrow. "
"3079970","3085010"," Into the into the Fed decision to be where you get like."
"3085790","3087610"," Your decision doom and gloom."
"3087610","3091510"," You'll see people on social media talking about Tesla bad it isn't like stuff. "
"3094530","3096630"," But the real baddy is down here."
"3096830","3098070"," This is where the real baddy is for Tesla."
"3098570","3100990"," This means that correction is not over. "
"3102350","3103890"," And we're going lower."
"3105970","3108010"," My price targets up here 196."
"3109110","3111490"," That's my little yellow right there on Tesla. "
"3111870","3112910"," We'll look at Apple real quick."
"3112910","3114270"," Back to Apple."
"3116110","3117530"," Apple's being bought right now. "
"3117750","3120850"," You can see the buyers stepping in still haven't won anything here."
"3120850","3122410"," So I've got I've got no."
"3123130","3125270"," Nothing to say about Apple at this point. "
"3125610","3129330"," Looks like horse trading to me right after Bell horse trading horse trading."
"3129510","3131390"," No clear direction on Apple yet."
"3132450","3133930"," We'll look at spy. "
"3135490","3137270"," Spy seems to be winning right now, right?"
"3137810","3138710"," Move this over for you."
"3139690","3141630"," Spy has won the one minute chart."
"3142670","3145450"," And we're going to start looking at previous highs on Apple. "
"3147830","3148850"," We've got the pivot."
"3149590","3150350"," Hold on here."
"3152630","3154630"," We'll look at the pre market high right here. "
"3156610","3159090"," Whatever that whatever that ghost print is."
"3161580","3164240"," Well, a little sneaky peat right there."
"3166380","3169440"," Price target 404.56 on spy. "
"3171820","3175520"," We've got this other little sneaky one where they dumped it right down here."
"3175620","3176780"," It's price target two."
"3178740","3180120"," Right before that pivot. "
"3180500","3186620"," So I got two price targets above 404.56, 405.60. We call these the H lines."
"3188220","3189680"," And then the Hendrix line."
"3189880","3190480"," We also call it. "
"3191720","3196880"," We've got a previous high right here and a previous high right here."
"3197820","3198900"," Right right around our one."
"3199060","3200160"," We've got another one right around this pivot. "
"3200340","3201180"," We've got a one on one right here."
"3205640","3209100"," If you're looking for some gap closes below."
"3209160","3211180"," If we get a rejection, you got one right here. "
"3214920","3216900"," Right down below 40148."
"3227680","3229460"," Report one markets being supportive."
"3230640","3233640"," And then we're going to talk as the morning opens up. "
"3234700","3237040"," We're going to take 15 minutes."
"3237180","3239760"," Once this once this shakeout happens here, we're going to take a."
"3243090","3244710"," We're going to take a look at."
"3246250","3248030"," So bulls have one here. "
"3250190","3255950"," We're going to take a look at the macro in the market and why I'm saying this is bottom."
"3257810","3263010"," Haven't unconfirmed need a few more that more data points to confirm a bottom in the market."
"3264250","3265810"," And we'll look at those. "
"3266550","3270050"," There's they it's not condition or at this point it's conditional."
"3270450","3272170"," There's a few things that can't break."
"3272190","3274830"," If they do, it makes the statement invalid. "
"3276410","3279470"," But we are we are we confirming a market bottom?"
"3279730","3280230"," I can confirm."
"3280490","3284110"," I can confirm for you probably this week at some point with some caveats."
"3284410","3286910"," Some things you want to understand if we are at a market bottom. "
"3287610","3288750"," How long does it last?"
"3290390","3293710"," More than likely for a significant amount of time a year."
"3294630","3295550"," Probably a year."
"3298470","3300970"," One to three years would be the extension of it. "
"3302730","3304350"," So we'll talk about that this morning."
"3304610","3305790"," That's going to be a big one for us."
"3306310","3310670"," I'm going to show you guys some underneath underneath the hood stuff on the market that I want you"
"3310670","3311270"," to be looking at. "
"3311490","3316330"," If you're questioning that you could probably see the VIX go to like 13 before a pullback."
"3317430","3322670"," If we are at a bottom, you will see the VIX you will see the VIX get reprised believe it"
"3322670","3323050"," or not."
"3323890","3328430"," You'll see VIX get reprised down to like 10 13 somewhere in there and you'll be trading the VIX"
"3328430","3329550"," between 10 and 20. "
"3329950","3331350"," No, that sounds like a shocker."
"3333250","3339350"," But that I'm going to want to make that call in the next day or two with some with some"
"3339350","3340930"," confirmed to it."
"3341010","3343430"," I'm going to confirm it here really soon. "
"3343430","3346530"," And there's some caveats."
"3348530","3351930"," So there's some numbers you can't break to make that true."
"3353170","3354590"," And it's going to be a rough road. "
"3355110","3356370"," I'll tell you that too."
"3356470","3357330"," It's going to be a rough road."
"3357730","3359530"," There's going to be some times where we're going to sell off. "
"3359750","3364290"," You shouldn't be out there being a bull being like I'm fucking buying right now because there are"
"3364290","3365430"," some better places to buy."
"3366690","3374010"," But in terms of like you're going to see 2,800 or 1,400 this week or next month or"
"3374010","3374990"," three months from now."
"3376850","3382510"," No, and we can actually go down to like 360 and I don't see lower. "
"3383970","3384990"," I'll show it to you."
"3385210","3386870"," I'm going to show it to you so you can see it."
"3389010","3390790"," And I'm going to show you how it happens. "
"3390790","3395850"," And I'm going to show you in previous points in history when it's happened."
"3395970","3399390"," And I'm going to show you why 2008 and 2000 were different."
"3400110","3401410"," I'm going to show you that too. "
"3401430","3407770"," So I'm going to show you why I'm making this prediction and what it needs to confirm to make that"
"3407770","3408030"," prediction."
"3408410","3410590"," I'm going to show you why this time it is different."
"3410610","3412050"," And I'm going to show you why it is different. "
"3412790","3415330"," So when you got bears out there telling you it's like 2008 2000."
"3416250","3416750"," I'm sorry."
"3416970","3417890"," It just isn't. "
"3417890","3421690"," And I can show you the facts why it isn't the same."
"3424630","3426850"," Boy, man, I got I was watching."
"3427010","3428210"," I got told some stuff this weekend. "
"3428510","3431290"," Some people I pissed off some big bears this week, huh?"
"3431910","3433630"," I heard that I pissed off some bears."
"3434650","3435730"," I have a low file."
"3435890","3440470"," You have 10,000 followers and you got fucking million follower bears pissed off at me. "
"3440570","3440990"," That's awesome."
"3441650","3441990"," High five."
"3442310","3444510"," If you're watching right now and you're that guy and you know who you are. "
"3445090","3446030"," High fucking five, buddy."
"3446030","3447330"," Good morning."
"3462310","3470150"," Yeah, I'm pretty fucking confident here in this. "
"3472030","3474290"," I'm pretty fucking confident."
"3475590","3476750"," And I'll show you guys why."
"3477570","3480270"," I'll show you guys will know you guys will know you guys will know you guys will go about your"
"3480270","3482530"," business with it and why why it is like that. "
"3489720","3490080"," Okay."
"3490320","3491580"," So spy trading up to four or four."
"3491660","3494340"," The six pin strike to close the pre market cap right here. "
"3495000","3496100"," Kind of see it right there."
"3498360","3499260"," You know, and don't."
"3499420","3500240"," And I'll be honest with you. "
"3500300","3503140"," If I'm telling if you're watching right now, like don't at me."
"3503140","3506220"," If we trade down a three eighty don't that me if we trade out three sixty."
"3507040","3508160"," We need to see. "
"3508660","3510460"," We can't be moving the markers here."
"3510580","3512440"," You guys have to understand that they cannot be."
"3513020","3514700"," You can you are not allowed. "
"3515240","3519640"," I'm not allowed to read to make move the fucking goalposts."
"3521080","3524880"," There's no allowing like that was my point on Fentuit was."
"3525540","3527160"," There's no goal post moving. "
"3527880","3532300"," You're not allowed to be like, yeah, you know, at three forty five three fifty three sixty,"
"3532300","3533540"," whatever three forty five."
"3533980","3538620"," And you're not you know, and we want, you know, it's like I want twenty percent down from here."
"3538840","3539100"," Okay. "
"3539880","3542140"," And that's the top of the low end."
"3542140","3545000"," So the goalposts can't be fucking moved."
"3546200","3549660"," Three, four, five, six times because you know what's going to happen is. "
"3550060","3553320"," You're going to be trading for sixty and now you're going to be calling for."
"3553800","3554740"," I don't know."
"3555520","3557440"," Two thousand point move down. "
"3557600","3558240"," Does that make sense?"
"3558660","3562520"," See, see, so you can't be like, well, I want twenty percent from four sixty."
"3563320","3565100"," I want twenty percent from four eighty."
"3565280","3566000"," I want twenty percent. "
"3566220","3568740"," You're like the twenty percent just keeps fucking the goalposts move."
"3569720","3569880"," Right?"
"3570020","3570500"," Makes sense?"
"3571340","3575040"," So it just sounds it just starts to begin to sound irrational at some point."
"3575560","3577460"," We're like, okay, do you want twenty percent now?"
"3577540","3578420"," You want forty percent?"
"3578560","3579340"," You want fifty percent?"
"3579480","3580360"," You want sixty percent?"
"3580740","3581400"," Does that make sense?"
"3581980","3583980"," So right now we're trading four oh five, right?"
"3585020","3587580"," When we're trading three forty five, right?"
"3587760","3589600"," You want a twenty percent from there, right?"
"3590220","3591080"," A minimum, right?"
"3591360","3594080"," So now it's thirty percent, right?"
"3594280","3595460"," Or thirty five percent?"
"3595760","3596520"," What percent is it?"
"3596940","3597640"," What's the price?"
"3599120","3600680"," Does that make sense to you out there?"
"3601560","3607480"," So I really need some clarification because as we're moving up here, we've seen this in the past. "
"3608200","3611460"," You know, let's say we're trading for sixty at some point."
"3611460","3616700"," Does it become like do I still listen to that person that's like, you know, all right, so now it's"
"3616700","3617980"," forty percent drop tomorrow."
"3618260","3619540"," I'm like, this is fucking nonsense. "
"3619880","3621080"," I got to trade what's in front of me."
"3623020","3623380"," Right?"
"3623500","3625980"," It just starts to sound irrational at some point."
"3631680","3632560"," You get what I'm saying?"
"3632900","3634960"," Like down to three fifty or something. "
"3635260","3636340"," I'm like, yeah, okay, I get it."
"3636600","3639480"," Three eighty if we reject it and kept going lower that week in December."
"3639920","3640540"," Yeah, I get it. "
"3641840","3644480"," If you bloodbath January, yeah, I get it."
"3644480","3646440"," We didn't bloodbath January, man."
"3646500","3647200"," They fucking bought it. "
"3647280","3648120"," This isn't dumb money."
"3649060","3651260"," This isn't fucking dumb money buying this right here."
"3651380","3652300"," I heard that comment this week. "
"3652400","3656400"," I'm like, I'm watching fucking fifty million dollar blocks coming and buying the market."
"3657000","3658400"," That's not retail traders."
"3658660","3659100"," Get out of here. "
"3659660","3660180"," That nonsense."
"3662780","3663880"," So I don't know."
"3665240","3668040"," You'd have to see some kind of like event. "
"3669440","3671140"," Maybe the maybe the Fed does that."
"3672080","3674100"," That's what I'm waiting for is just the Fed, right?"
"3674100","3675420"," Outside of the Fed, man."
"3675720","3678040"," There's so much stuff just saying no to that. "
"3678600","3681780"," That positive, you know, I heard that."
"3681880","3682340"," I heard last week."
"3682380","3684340"," I heard like, recession's not priced in. "
"3684680","3685960"," And this isn't priced in."
"3686040","3686860"," And that isn't priced in."
"3686960","3689620"," I'm like, we went down for a whole fucking three years. "
"3690440","3691260"," We went down for three."
"3691360","3692020"," You guys don't get there."
"3692140","3693700"," Not me guys, but you guys. "
"3694080","3698160"," Like the the the the selling began in December of 2020."
"3699420","3701360"," Literally began in December 2020."
"3701360","3702120"," All spec growth. "
"3702520","3703580"," I remember watching CNBC."
"3703620","3707560"," They were like, you should be buying all these are products that aren't dark."
"3707560","3711300"," If you think our case got up too much, you should buy it beat by arc G right now. "
"3711400","3715660"," And then they sold that shit down January one and bloodbath it of 2021."
"3716040","3718860"," And they bloodbath all fucking 2021, right?"
"3719420","3720740"," Then they went and they came for."
"3721340","3727180"," They went and they came for all these blue chips that were not didn't have corporate debt bonds,"
"3727180","3727500"," right?"
"3727860","3729120"," And they just murdered all those. "
"3729120","3733360"," Just murdered in 2021, like just smoked them down, right?"
"3734260","3736500"," And then 2022, they came for the indexes."
"3736740","3737580"," They came for Teslas."
"3737820","3741760"," They came for the apples and they came for the Amazon's the Facebook's and all the other fucking"
"3741760","3743140"," companies that are out there. "
"3743620","3745500"," So then you have another year of just down."
"3746820","3747220"," Right."
"3747540","3749860"," And so I'm like sitting here going, man. "
"3750120","3751440"," All right, I'm down for this."
"3751580","3753100"," I'm down for the market to sell off hard."
"3753100","3759420"," I'm down for I'm open to the fact that we're going to bloodbath this market down from 405 down to"
"3759420","3760300"," 2800. "
"3760620","3762500"," We're going to go on 1200 points this week, right?"
"3762640","3763500"," That's what we're being told, right?"
"3763920","3764760"," I'm being told that, right?"
"3765220","3767640"," I'm being told we're going to we're going to fucking 2800 this week."
"3767940","3769320"," 3,200 3,000."
"3770180","3772320"," JPM saying man 3060. "
"3773360","3774180"," And I'm like that."
"3774320","3774780"," I see it."
"3774920","3775240"," I get it. "
"3775980","3776480"," I understand."
"3777020","3778100"," I'm open to that happening."
"3778100","3779320"," But what does that mean for me?"
"3780000","3782080"," It means that what do I do then?"
"3782080","3783380"," Do I just buy some fucking. "
"3784120","3785100"," I'm going to tell you what a bit."
"3785320","3786300"," You know what a bullish stance is?"
"3786920","3788380"," I'm telling you what a bullish stance is."
"3788920","3789620"," A bullish stance. "
"3790240","3791660"," When we're here today here."
"3793040","3794720"," Is different than a bear stance."
"3795100","3797720"," It's when you say, okay, so you're telling me we're going to 3000. "
"3798820","3799220"," Okay."
"3799420","3800940"," So that means I hedge."
"3802100","3804260"," To 3000 for dirt cheap, right?"
"3805740","3807100"," And I trade the market in front of me. "
"3807910","3809240"," That's a huge difference."
"3810600","3815640"," That's a that's a that's a fundamental difference for where we are right now."
"3816100","3821700"," I can actually I can actually buy this market and buy dirt cheap protection down to 3000. "
"3821880","3823040"," That's what you're telling me."
"3823460","3824480"," Does that make sense?"
"3826320","3828120"," So you've got like Kathy would."
"3829040","3834780"," Forced into buying protection at the worst possible place down at 345 right forced into it. "
"3834780","3842740"," I get to buy protection at fucking 4000 long this market for dirt cheap to 3000 in case we have"
"3842740","3843320"," a market crash."
"3843980","3845720"," That's a bullish stance."
"3847040","3848200"," What's a bullish stance?"
"3849180","3850780"," When you buy the market, right?"
"3851560","3854340"," You buy the market and you buy cheap protection. "
"3855280","3856400"," Does that make sense to you?"
"3860440","3863120"," So you bought that bottom in October."
"3863280","3864460"," You bought the bottom."
"3864780","3867520"," You bought Tesla 100 135, whatever. "
"3868100","3873040"," And you say, you know what, as we continue higher, I'm going to hedge my position."
"3874740","3879260"," If I buy Tesla 100 in DCA down at 65 and 46."
"3880760","3881640"," And I'm stuck with Tesla. "
"3881640","3884460"," A dollar cost average of $67."
"3885220","3889460"," I'm better off than most people ever, not ever, but you know, decade and a half."
"3890520","3896480"," You're telling me up here, all I have to do is buy some dirt cheap protection against my my trade"
"3896480","3897420"," or my investment. "
"3898380","3903500"," See, it's starting to sound, walk, act, look like a duck."
"3903500","3910960"," And the duck is, we're either at a bottom or close enough that the market's going to get bought by"
"3910960","3912280"," large participants."
"3913100","3914260"," Do you understand what I'm saying to you?"
"3915220","3918100"," You understand the fundamental idea behind this. "
"3919420","3924940"," If I'm a bull on the market, I'm saying to myself, okay, wow, some of these stickers are really,"
"3924940","3925680"," really low."
"3927580","3930320"," You know, these are, these are fundamentally sound companies."
"3930320","3933700"," I can buy these companies on the bottom. "
"3935200","3936580"," I can watch them go up."
"3937500","3940040"," If they come back down below that huge low at 340."
"3940460","3941940"," I mean, think about this structurally. "
"3942580","3943060"," 345."
"3944280","3945140"," The spy was that."
"3946180","3947860"," Right now you're claiming what?"
"3948200","3948540"," 3,600. "
"3949740","3950660"," Claiming 3,200."
"3951200","3951580"," 2,800."
"3952060","3953340"," Give me a number as a bear. "
"3953700","3954100"," Give me a number."
"3954320","3955760"," We're at 3,450."
"3957980","3961000"," And you're telling me we're coming back to 3,200, right?"
"3961500","3963200"," 3,600 is at 3,000. "
"3963780","3964600"," Is it 2,800?"
"3965640","3966660"," So if I'm about to buy at 345."
"3968220","3968660"," Right?"
"3968900","3970180"," 3,450, let's say."
"3970800","3971760"," We come back to 2,800. "
"3972360","3974860"," You're telling me I can dollar cost average into spy at 2,800."
"3976280","3978040"," Now, now I'm balls in for what?"
"3978400","3978880"," 3 grand?"
"3980960","3982260"," So it starts to sound."
"3982260","3988380"," You either have to be making a statement that we're going lower than that. "
"3989560","3992920"," You have to be making a statement that this quarter."
"3993500","3994540"," We're not going to 2,800."
"3994820","3998460"," We're going to like fucking 1,600, 1,400. "
"3998820","3998880"," Right?"
"3999140","4000100"," That's what you're saying."
"4001660","4006760"," Because if you're not saying that, I should be buying this market at 3,400, 3,000."
"4006880","4007000"," Right?"
"4007280","4008600"," I should be DC Aang down there. "
"4008960","4010820"," I should be DC Aang Tesla, Apple."
"4010820","4014720"," Any other particular that hasn't gotten their teeth kicked in."
"4014840","4014940"," Right?"
"4015260","4016240"," Because that's what you're telling me. "
"4018120","4020260"," So you fundamentally, not even fundamentally."
"4020640","4022340"," You just need the simple math."
"4024120","4027980"," Try telling me that we're going to 2,800. "
"4028340","4028820"," What do I care?"
"4036220","4036800"," You get what I'm saying?"
"4040440","4041420"," So where is it?"
"4042620","4047540"," If you're like this collapsed bear, it has to be below 2,800."
"4049160","4051540"," You're telling me we're going to 2,300 or 3,200?"
"4051920","4052820"," And I bought 3,450?"
"4053480","4054200"," The fuck do I care?"
"4056920","4061480"," So you're changing the goal post, changing the goal post, changing the goal post, right?"
"4062880","4066040"," Because the goal post was like 1,600."
"4066620","4067020"," Remember that?"
"4068960","4070240"," So that's my question. "
"4071300","4076980"," And there's some shit going on in the background that I'm assuming that that's a market like pros"
"4076980","4083620"," are doing simple math and they're saying, well, I got to put some risk on somewhere."
"4086660","4090180"," You're telling me that they're not going to make a market before we get to 1,600?"
"4090400","4093120"," Like that's like a 15% chance of happening."
"4095439","4099600"," Tell me the market participants only enter the market at 1,600 or something stupid like that. "
"4099700","4100220"," Get out of here."
"4101600","4102840"," Seriously, get out of here."
"4103220","4105600"," Even if it did go that low, how long does that last?"
"4106640","4111939"," Three months, six months, time with a collapse of the US financial system. "
"4112720","4114040"," Come on, man."
"4114779","4115200"," Seriously."
"4118100","4118700"," Seriously. "
"4120140","4120600"," Come on."
"4122240","4125220"," Get out of here with that noise."
"4127359","4134319"," So if we are going to 1,600, you say I can just as a bull buy that protection for"
"4134319","4135180"," like a penny, right?"
"4137020","4142800"," You tell me that I should that you're actually validating me buying the market at 3,400, 3,450. "
"4143920","4145680"," DCA, if we get down to 2,800."
"4147020","4151979"," And just protect my shit with insurance to 1,600 for a fucking penny."
"4153080","4154340"," Cost me nothing. "
"4155880","4157060"," That's what you're telling me, right?"
"4158040","4158740"," Got it."
"4158979","4159660"," I'm all over it."
"4160060","4160500"," Thank you. "
"4161920","4162800"," Thank you."
"4164120","4164760"," Appreciate it."
"4164760","4169279"," Keep fucking posting that shit on fucking CNBC that we're going to the depths of hell. "
"4170420","4172979"," Keep going on Finn to it and fucking saying what you're going to say."
"4173840","4176080"," Fucking double d- killing me."
"4184720","4186200"," You want to see anything possible?"
"4186460","4187120"," I'll show you anything possible. "
"4188140","4190340"," I'll show you where I would agree with you on there."
"4190600","4191380"," Jim Barry, I love you."
"4192040","4193160"," I got to say something. "
"4193560","4195360"," I want to show you guys something right now, okay?"
"4195360","4196800"," I'm not going to wait any longer."
"4196960","4199580"," I don't care where we go on the spot, but I want to show you guys something because I want"
"4199580","4200380"," to bear to see this."
"4200580","4204880"," It's important for a bear to see us because if this was laid out a different way, I would agree"
"4204880","4206980"," with the bear or the collapsed bear. "
"4207080","4209500"," I'd be like, and Jim Barry's not a collapsed bear."
"4209580","4211660"," He's just a regular bear or a trader or whatever."
"4212820","4214840"," But there's a sentiment out there. "
"4216700","4222400"," And this sentiment or this fundamental analysis or this technical analysis, right?"
"4222400","4223700"," And I can keep hearing this, right?"
"4223960","4225060"," People have tried that."
"4225200","4225820"," They don't hire for this."
"4226020","4226980"," Blah, blah, fucking blah. "
"4227460","4227640"," Bullshit."
"4228160","4234280"," I'm going to show you exactly what the structure was in 2008 and then 2000."
"4235180","4238940"," Now, if we had that same structure today, right now at this moment, I would agree. "
"4239080","4240420"," I'd be like, yeah, man, this guy is right."
"4241160","4242700"," This guy is fucking right."
"4244120","4246440"," But I can't right now because it's not. "
"4247580","4248700"," It just isn't."
"4252940","4253660"," Now, I don't know."
"4253800","4255660"," I'm assuming that J-POW knows this. "
"4257560","4259640"," I'm assuming that J-POW knows this at this point."
"4260620","4261440"," We're going to talk about it."
"4263920","4269820"," Now, trading 404.91. Let me show it to you right now. "
"4274060","4274840"," Give me a second."
"4274980","4275440"," I'll set it up."
"4280940","4282560"," I want you guys to see this. "
"4287560","4288460"," Hang tight here."
"4289200","4290220"," Can we just a second?"
"4290340","4290980"," It's going to take a moment."
"4293980","4295220"," Two and three. "
"4297520","4299180"," I want to show you guys something."
"4300580","4300600"," It's important."
"4301880","4303280"," I want to show you what I'm thinking. "
"4304460","4307220"," And then you can tell me that I'm crazy."
"4312980","4313840"," Because maybe I am."
"4314180","4316940"," Maybe I'm crazy. "
"4318180","4320000"," Maybe I don't know what I'm talking about, I guess."
"4320620","4327160"," If I don't know what I'm talking about, if you can punch holes in my theory, you can do it"
"4327160","4327580"," right here."
"4328320","4330200"," This is the time and the day to do it. "
"4332700","4333540"," This is it."
"4333780","4336120"," This is the big boy pants on."
"4336540","4338720"," Stand behind your thesis. "
"4340140","4341340"," This is that day."
"4341940","4343520"," I want you out there."
"4344160","4345560"," Tell me why I'm wrong. "
"4348580","4350120"," What's going on with Spy right now?"
"4350220","4350940"," Is it grounded up higher?"
"4351680","4355640"," I want you to tell me where I'm wrong here."
"4355840","4359040"," Now I know that there are some places we can get our teeth kicked in here."
"4359200","4359960"," So I'll agree with that. "
"4360380","4360960"," Hold on here."
"4361040","4361760"," We're good here."
"4363060","4364640"," Make sure I got this wrong right here. "
"4364800","4365240"," Hold on here."
"4365400","4365860"," We're doing here."
"4366480","4366800"," Good morning. "
"4367080","4369840"," I got this one right here."
"4370160","4371340"," This one right here in the background."
"4372320","4372920"," Lots of stuff. "
"4374460","4376440"," There's one right here."
"4378460","4379880"," I'm going to just do that one right there."
"4380300","4381140"," We got that one. "
"4382240","4385100"," And then what do we get here?"
"4385820","4386240"," Right here."
"4386340","4386940"," We got this right here."
"4387700","4388520"," Hold on here. "
"4390660","4392080"," I would love to be wrong."
"4392280","4393260"," If I'm wrong here, right?"
"4393700","4395520"," If I'm wrong, I want to know."
"4397300","4397900"," I do. "
"4398020","4401940"," I want to know if I'm wrong here because I hope I'm wrong."
"4401940","4405080"," Because if I'm wrong, I'm going to make a bunch of money, right?"
"4405380","4408020"," I'm going to make a bunch of huge money if I'm wrong."
"4408400","4416040"," If you guys can tell me that I'm wrong, I'd be stoked because, you know, you guys, you guys, you"
"4416040","4418380"," guys can be like, hey, Cap, you got it wrong, brother. "
"4418680","4420320"," And I can be like, you know what?"
"4420780","4421160"," They got it right."
"4421300","4421520"," I'm wrong."
"4423280","4424680"," And I'm going to take the short. "
"4426140","4427200"," The big short, right?"
"4433080","4434360"," Okay, we got the green there."
"4434660","4436240"," We got the green with the red, yellow."
"4436820","4437980"," Do I even need that one there?"
"4438080","4438640"," I don't know that I do. "
"4440600","4442360"," I might get rid of that one there."
"4445200","4448160"," I think I'm going to get rid of that one because it's not going to matter as much."
"4449080","4450520"," Yeah, that's what's going to matter right there. "
"4451220","4451460"," Okay."
"4451540","4451820"," Are you ready?"
"4452660","4453340"," I'm going to show you."
"4454060","4454960"," Hold on a second here. "
"4454980","4455740"," I'm going to take a sip of coffee."
"4456260","4457680"," Y'all paying attention this morning?"
"4462460","4463360"," I'm going to show you."
"4463360","4463640"," Okay. "
"4467520","4470460"," I'm going to show you a structural change in our market right now."
"4473370","4474170"," Hold on here."
"4474630","4475270"," A second here. "
"4479250","4480870"," And I want to know what you know."
"4484270","4485910"," Just being right there."
"4487030","4488350"," This is the S&P 500. "
"4489130","4489910"," This is SPX."
"4492930","4496070"," And we need to see this little red line down here coming on up over back here."
"4496170","4496270"," Okay. "
"4496910","4499110"," We're only just this one right here and the importance of it."
"4499950","4502030"," I want you to see what's going on right now."
"4504810","4506010"," I want you to see the time. "
"4508830","4512570"," I want you to see we trade above this yellow line right here."
"4512670","4512830"," Okay."
"4513670","4514290"," What happens?"
"4516010","4517550"," I want you to see this. "
"4517550","4517890"," Okay."
"4518410","4519510"," See that right there?"
"4521250","4522290"," You understand that?"
"4522610","4523910"," You understand this right here."
"4525910","4527610"," You understand this right here. "
"4528730","4533090"," You understand this big giant shark coming up from underneath."
"4534450","4534930"," Right now."
"4535090","4536290"," I want you to see that right there. "
"4536610","4537910"," And I want to show you a couple of things."
"4538130","4539190"," See, I want you in your brain."
"4539730","4540030"," Simple. "
"4540390","4545830"," We were doing this for crayons for the crayon for the for the for the trader that doesn't know what"
"4545830","4546470"," they're doing, right?"
"4546670","4549170"," This is the trader that doesn't know what they're doing."
"4549810","4551770"," I also want you to see this right here."
"4553070","4555770"," This is back in 2020. "
"4557010","4560590"," See how we came back down and tested that came right back up, right?"
"4560790","4561090"," You see that?"
"4562010","4563990"," But I want to show you something even more important."
"4564710","4565930"," This is for the collapse bear."
"4566890","4567330"," Okay. "
"4568470","4569510"," So we are right now."
"4569910","4571550"," I want to show you a fundamental difference."
"4572650","4577430"," You see this yellow line right here coming down underneath that red line right there. "
"4577470","4578670"," I want you to see that right there."
"4579530","4580410"," Fundamental difference."
"4581550","4585450"," See that yellow line on top coming over. "
"4585790","4587110"," You see this right here, right?"
"4587850","4591450"," Yellow line over crosses down next leg down."
"4592170","4593310"," Next leg down."
"4593610","4594350"," Do you see the difference?"
"4595070","4596710"," This is where we are right now. "
"4597530","4598530"," We're with the yellow line."
"4598690","4600150"," We're going to get real fucking simple for people."
"4600270","4602690"," I was trying to figure out a way to make this simple over the weekend. "
"4602970","4604150"," But this is the way I'm going to do it."
"4604970","4606230"," See a yellow line coming up?"
"4606950","4610030"," See some volatility in there and then we blast it up."
"4610350","4612090"," You see that retest blast up. "
"4612830","4614350"," But I want you to see a difference here."
"4615830","4618470"," Yellow line underneath coming up."
"4619330","4621290"," Yellow line above coming down. "
"4621750","4622330"," We're going to go back."
"4625400","4628200"," See that yellow line coming down and coming back up right here."
"4628480","4629100"," Exploding higher. "
"4630980","4632660"," Set red lines underneath right there."
"4633640","4634520"," See that right there."
"4638400","4640700"," Right, this red line is coming underneath, right?"
"4641420","4642660"," I want you to see that. "
"4647780","4649880"," See that red line just pushing up."
"4658020","4660220"," Can't have this yellow line cross underneath."
"4661000","4663700"," If we break up above the yellow line, right, you know what happens?"
"4668760","4670600"," We get explosive moves higher. "
"4671900","4673620"," See that red line comes underneath."
"4674240","4674800"," We sell off."
"4676040","4678020"," Come back down, hit that yellow line. "
"4678100","4679020"," We're off and running again."
"4686370","4687090"," Hold on here."
"4687310","4688090"," Hold on a second here. "
"4691770","4693650"," And so this is what you're watching for."
"4695770","4697250"," This is that same line right here."
"4697830","4698910"," This is that same chart. "
"4699790","4701730"," You can bring it back for you and show it to you."
"4701810","4702410"," It's right here."
"4706630","4708070"," Set red line coming up. "
"4708190","4709090"," This is what I say."
"4709210","4711330"," There's a shark underneath the surface here, right?"
"4714650","4716410"," There's a shark underneath the surface."
"4717230","4718850"," That's why we didn't sell off down here. "
"4720090","4721350"," Push this up, right?"
"4722370","4723410"," Push this up again."
"4723410","4725230"," Push this up again."
"4726730","4733200"," So if we start to rip higher here, right?"
"4734500","4737820"," But this yellow line, don't get caught. "
"4737980","4739340"," Don't get caught under here, okay?"
"4739460","4742200"," Because this could be explosive and explosive move higher."
"4742940","4744820"," And there's some other lines I'm not going to show you."
"4745340","4747060"," Some other stuff I'm not going to show you. "
"4747460","4748740"," I want you to see that, okay?"
"4749240","4752380"," I want you to see the shark is coming up from underneath."
"4754770","4761350"," And if you see this carry up here and we traded up here already, key here is that we've already"
"4761350","4762930"," traded up here."
"4763890","4766210"," We had an explosive move higher here. "
"4767690","4770070"," We start doing this nonsense here, right?"
"4771190","4772490"," And you're going to get caught."
"4773910","4775890"," You're going to wind up getting caught in here."
"4776110","4777630"," And you don't want to get caught in here. "
"4778010","4778970"," You get what I'm saying?"
"4781130","4782750"," Don't do not get caught in here."
"4784970","4790750"," Now, if we had bloodbath down in December, like remember that 380?"
"4791490","4795090"," Remember, like, oh, yeah, we're selling this is super bearish down here?"
"4795270","4796110"," I would have agreed with you."
"4797150","4800170"," That's super bearish, right?"
"4800790","4803610"," Because you come down here, you get sold down there and make sense. "
"4805030","4806750"," We're not seeing that right now."
"4807190","4812670"," If we come back up here and keep doing this nonsense over here, we're a bullish stance right now."
"4813010","4815470"," You need to understand that if you're a trader, you're an investor. "
"4816490","4818630"," You need to see some key levels get broken."
"4820730","4822530"," 394, 395, 396."
"4822990","4825070"," Look, it's 395, right?"
"4825870","4827050"," And so where are we right now?"
"4829550","4830490"," Where are we right now?"
"4830610","4831890"," What was that begging for last night?"
"4832150","4834390"," I was like, come on down here. "
"4834950","4836090"," A double dog dare you."
"4836090","4837310"," Look at how close we are to it."
"4841730","4843170"," I'm like, come on down here. "
"4843570","4844270"," I dare you."
"4845930","4848510"," I double dog dare you to come down here."
"4849030","4851030"," I double dog, double dog dare you. "
"4852730","4854610"," Triple dog dare you to come down here."
"4856350","4858290"," I beg of you to come down there."
"4859510","4861290"," That's your only thing that you've got. "
"4861390","4866450"," If you're a bear and you want to see bearish, you need to see not just come down here, but"
"4866450","4867330"," get underneath there."
"4868630","4870830"," This is the last part right here."
"4871310","4872050"," This is it. "
"4873770","4874530"," This is it."
"4874930","4875730"," If you're a bear."
"4876610","4881380"," If you're a bear. "
"4884770","4886270"," This is what you need right here."
"4889740","4891660"," Not 380, not 390."
"4892960","4894980"," You need to get underneath that green bar. "
"4901780","4903620"," Get your bear pants on."
"4909600","4910680"," That's what you need right there."
"4911780","4913480"," That's your jam if you're a bear. "
"4918450","4920070"," You've already been defended once."
"4924460","4925240"," That's what you need."
"4928280","4929640"," That's all you want right there. "
"4934980","4936260"," That's what you need right there."
"4938000","4940000"," You need to get underneath here if you're a bear."
"4942430","4946630"," You need to hold this and start bloodbathing it. "
"4947470","4949010"," If you can't do that for me."
"4950370","4953430"," If you can't do that for me in the next week or two, right?"
"4955990","4958210"," We're going to call this bottom in."
"4960450","4961270"," That's your job. "
"4961470","4962450"," If you're a bear, that's what you need."
"4965380","4966620"," That's your job right here."
"4966700","4967340"," Get underneath this. "
"4970340","4978910"," You can't get under that convincingly."
"4981270","4982870"," Get under this convincingly."
"4987460","4988100"," Bottoms in. "
"4993080","4994360"," You need a lot of blood."
"4995540","4996760"," Bears need some blood."
"4997800","5000080"," I'm not anti-doing that. "
"5000320","5001480"," Don't get me wrong."
"5002920","5006620"," If we get under there, I'll throw full bear suit on."
"5006860","5008280"," I'll look like a polar bear. "
"5008700","5009620"," I'll do whatever you want."
"5010700","5014660"," I am down to take this trip down to like 3,000 or 2,800."
"5016160","5021920"," I'll tell you what, this was it right here, right?"
"5024140","5026100"," This was your trip, right?"
"5026460","5027560"," Here's your trip again. "
"5027740","5028240"," It's up here."
"5029120","5033440"," We keep doing this every week, every month for the next three, six months or whatever."
"5035040","5039640"," I really want to know what your real price target is because right now, it's not happening. "
"5039840","5042000"," Right now, there's this force coming from underneath."
"5043140","5044760"," I was really scared right here."
"5044820","5045440"," We're going to do it. "
"5046300","5047520"," I think I posted on Finto it."
"5047680","5049040"," I was like, there's a real chance right here."
"5049080","5049960"," We're going to sell this market. "
"5049960","5051420"," And we didn't."
"5051560","5053160"," We camp here and I'm watching this."
"5053360","5055440"," I'm watching this big giant line come up underneath. "
"5056140","5057600"," And I was like, oh, fuck that."
"5057720","5058960"," We're going straight to the moon here."
"5059780","5060460"," And we did. "
"5060560","5061280"," We went straight to the moon."
"5062620","5065620"," And you know, you start selling this down in the next couple of days."
"5065620","5069160"," You see some goofiness where the Fed comes down here for a minute. "
"5069240","5070400"," That's not good enough for me."
"5071120","5075560"," It's not like if we have a Fed, if we have a Fed market decision, we blast down, but then"
"5075560","5076600"," come straight back up."
"5077380","5080100"," So that's why I said, say like the opening part of this broadcast. "
"5080440","5081960"," I was like, I really don't care."
"5082260","5083960"," I really could care less."
"5084840","5088680"," I can really care less. "
"5091420","5096360"," About the next, let's call it next, the Fed meeting Wednesday."
"5099460","5101300"," I care less about the move."
"5101520","5103900"," I care less about like, I'll be honest with you. "
"5104560","5108060"," If the matter what the fucking Fed says, if we blast down here."
"5108060","5111280"," And then two days later swing higher."
"5112240","5113600"," You know what that's going to tell me?"
"5113900","5119380"," The bottom is in so I can confirm it then. "
"5120120","5123820"," If we blast down here in the Fed meeting and we actually hold."
"5124900","5126780"," I'd be like, shit, the bottom is not in."
"5127060","5127680"," You get what I'm saying?"
"5130220","5136000"," If we blast higher in the Fed meeting and then come back down here, right?"
"5136800","5137600"," The bottom is in. "
"5138080","5138580"," Does that make sense?"
"5138580","5141420"," It's all about down here."
"5143540","5144880"," How important this is."
"5145160","5146020"," And I got to warn you. "
"5146660","5149020"," For that, just the last time I got to warn you."
"5149680","5152380"," The only thing I would say to you as a bear is this."
"5155240","5159700"," If this was reversed right here, if this red was up here, or I don't know if this is upside"
"5159700","5162800"," upside down chart right now, right?"
"5162940","5164780"," And this was coming down on top of me. "
"5164860","5166000"," Can I reverse this right now?"
"5166100","5166960"," Maybe I can reverse this."
"5167140","5168020"," Let me see if I can reverse this."
"5169320","5171620"," Let me show it to you a different way. "
"5172820","5174820"," And I'll tell you why I would be super bearish here."
"5175840","5178360"," Let me see if I can show you a main display here."
"5180040","5182260"," Let me show you what would make me super bearish. "
"5182260","5183660"," Why I would be super bearish here?"
"5183740","5185200"," Let me see if I can figure this out here."
"5185600","5186780"," I think I was able to do this once before."
"5186940","5187720"," Let me see if I can do it. "
"5189760","5190300"," Hold on here."
"5190540","5192220"," Let me see if I can transform."
"5193020","5194320"," Maybe flip this upside down. "
"5194320","5196460"," Edit, stretch, fit, screen, center, flip, vertical."
"5196920","5200140"," Rotate nine degrees counterwise, counterclockwise, counterwise."
"5200400","5201360"," Let me see if I can do this. "
"5203200","5203600"," Whoa."
"5209260","5209660"," Counterwise."
"5210140","5211320"," I always, I always fuck this up. "
"5211460","5211740"," Hold on."
"5215630","5216930"," Transform, counterclockwise, nine degrees."
"5217670","5217950"," Uh oh. "
"5218070","5218550"," Did I do that wrong?"
"5220630","5221030"," Rotate."
"5221270","5223350"," I always, I always fuck this up, but I'm going to show you."
"5223570","5224510"," Just pretend you're a."
"5225370","5225710"," Transform. "
"5227130","5227930"," Right there."
"5229370","5230290"," I have this right."
"5230390","5230450"," Yeah. "
"5230530","5230790"," That's right."
"5231590","5232350"," No, damn it."
"5232470","5233170"," I did it the wrong way. "
"5236910","5237350"," Hey, man."
"5237490","5238050"," Hold on a second here."
"5240130","5241090"," I always do this wrong. "
"5242950","5243270"," Transform."
"5243630","5244450"," It has a nine ways."
"5244950","5245810"," One more time. "
"5247150","5251230"," I was going to say why can't I just do this easy?"
"5252810","5254330"," It's for 90 degrees."
"5254990","5255310"," Nope."
"5255450","5256030"," Hold on a second here. "
"5259390","5265310"," I'm trying to kind of flip this thing upside down for you so that you can see what I'm, I'm"
"5265310","5266090"," trying to get with you."
"5266190","5266550"," All right."
"5266750","5267130"," There we go. "
"5268170","5268570"," Perfect."
"5272070","5273470"," Am I going the wrong way with this?"
"5275930","5276730"," Kind of wonky."
"5278390","5279770"," Do you see that red?"
"5281270","5283950"," See that red coming screaming down at you?"
"5284810","5286090"," This is an upside down chart. "
"5286610","5286630"," Okay."
"5288310","5289570"," You see what I'm saying here?"
"5291660","5292900"," Like just screaming down."
"5294280","5294720"," Right. "
"5294840","5295700"," I would be bearish here."
"5297940","5303220"," So if the, if the, if the, if the, if this was upside down, I'd be telling you, yeah, I'm"
"5303220","5304420"," pretty fucking bearish here."
"5308740","5309980"," This market goes up. "
"5316460","5318220"," You can see it down here, right?"
"5318960","5320560"," Even even here we broke down below."
"5321100","5321880"," How long was this?"
"5321880","5325280"," This is March 20th or March 11th."
"5326580","5335840"," This is April 14th, April 14th, March 20th, April 14th. "
"5337660","5343240"," This is December 19th, January 19th, one month later."
"5348430","5349990"," And this, look at the spacing in here."
"5353200","5353680"," Look at us. "
"5353800","5357780"," We blasted down below already once blasted down below what already wants."
"5358880","5361920"," Moving average comes a screaming higher here."
"5363340","5364180"," Sorry, man. "
"5364460","5365220"," Like, look at this."
"5365300","5365540"," What is this?"
"5365740","5367360"," 396, 043."
"5374240","5375080"," Right there. "
"5378580","5379440"," So I don't know."
"5379600","5380940"," I don't know what to tell you, Fira."
"5382560","5386460"," I don't know what to tell you about the market. "
"5387160","5388060"," Where is the market?"
"5388910","5390020"," Where is the market going?"
"5390500","5392660"," We're trading sideways into the decision."
"5393360","5394200"," Does it really matter?"
"5397300","5398280"," They just rotate."
"5398560","5399860"," This looks like rotation, doesn't it?"
"5401740","5402660"," Looks like rotation. "
"5420720","5421240"," Hold on."
"5421340","5421800"," Let me get this."
"5423040","5423780"," This wonky. "
"5423900","5424580"," This is our one."
"5426540","5427260"," There's the pivot."
"5428240","5429620"," Still trading the five minute. "
"5435110","5436890"," There's S1 for a test down below."
"5439750","5442570"," So at least if you're a bear, you know what you want to do, right?"
"5443750","5445750"," You know, there's a bear that you need to get underneath."
"5446910","5449450"," 395, 396 somewhere in there. "
"5452960","5453420"," With conviction."
"5455280","5456660"," You need to hold it."
"5460100","5461440"," That's all you can. "
"5461540","5464260"," I mean, if you can't do that in the next three days."
"5465140","5466040"," The 31st."
"5467280","5470100"," The fed meeting pivot, not pivot. "
"5472000","5473880"," The case isn't over."
"5477780","5479720"," If we if we blast down to 360."
"5481160","5483460"," And then scream back up and pin. "
"5486760","5488120"," To the yellow line again."
"5488440","5489660"," It doesn't make a difference to me."
"5494780","5498920"," So there's like a really fast blast down and slam back up and pin to it. "
"5499320","5501660"," If we start pinning to this yellow line going north."
"5503680","5505080"," The bottom is in."
"5506280","5508840"," And you can't keep following that yellow line up. "
"5510200","5512460"," Let's say we're following it up and we blast down."
"5512700","5514920"," I don't know 200 points 100 points."
"5515640","5518320"," You can't keep claiming that it's not a bottom. "
"5518620","5519520"," That's my point is."
"5520100","5521140"," Where is bottom?"
"5521520","5524440"," Because I know at 345 it was 20% down from there."
"5525480","5525540"," Right?"
"5526380","5527080"," We're going to hit 3200. "
"5527260","5527780"," We're going to hit 200."
"5528360","5529860"," And that's just the top of the low."
"5531660","5536720"," So as we keep trading this, right, you start to see that we're getting farther and farther away"
"5536720","5538240"," from what's actually bottom. "
"5539100","5539620"," Right?"
"5540320","5546320"," Farther and farther away from the targets of low 2000s low 1600s."
"5547380","5549120"," We're getting farther and farther away."
"5554920","5555440"," Right?"
"5555600","5557740"," You start seeing higher lows and higher lows. "
"5558060","5558180"," Right?"
"5558440","5559400"," You can see the higher lows."
"5563700","5564220"," Right?"
"5564380","5564860"," You can see them."
"5564980","5565100"," Right?"
"5565360","5566580"," It's not that hard to see them. "
"5568660","5569340"," Get higher low."
"5569580","5570480"," There is basic stuff."
"5570740","5570760"," Right?"
"5570940","5571180"," Higher low. "
"5571540","5572800"," Higher low."
"5573580","5574020"," Higher low."
"5574980","5576440"," Is business bearish to you?"
"5577300","5578080"," I don't know. "
"5578360","5580380"," I mean, I got to be missing something."
"5585770","5587090"," I got to be missing something."
"5587830","5589250"," Is it this bloodbath?"
"5589670","5590310"," Michael Barry?"
"5590590","5590910"," Bloodbath?"
"5591130","5591930"," Are you telling me it's a?"
"5592210","5593490"," What are you trying to tell me as a bear?"
"5594590","5596210"," Are you telling me that it's a?"
"5596770","5597050"," I don't know. "
"5597230","5598450"," You're telling me it's 20% down?"
"5599130","5599410"," 3200?"
"5600010","5601130"," What is that for a month?"
"5601790","5602410"," Is that what it is?"
"5605420","5606620"," So you're basically telling me."
"5608760","5610220"," I should have bought bottom over here."
"5610460","5611460"," I should have bought bottom over here. "
"5611560","5612480"," I should have bought bottom over here."
"5613160","5614960"," And you're telling me that I might have a month."
"5616680","5618340"," So don't sell my longs. "
"5619640","5622400"," And take a hedge protection that's dirt cheap, right?"
"5622580","5623160"," That's what you're telling me."
"5623580","5624820"," I'm assuming that's what you're telling me."
"5626260","5629100"," Assuming you're telling me we're going to blast down here to 3,000. "
"5629740","5630660"," 3200, let's say."
"5631920","5633620"," Historically, what is that last a month?"
"5635320","5636900"," So I should long the market."
"5637560","5638900"," And I should put a hedge on. "
"5639400","5640420"," That's what you're telling me, right?"
"5640420","5643340"," I'm sure shit doesn't sound like being bearish."
"5643980","5650970"," I'm sure shit sounds like I should be bullish and I should protect myself."
"5653170","5656990"," I should be looking for opportunities to DCA down here. "
"5657170","5657730"," Does that make sense?"
"5659390","5661870"," I should be looking for opportunities to buy."
"5664310","5665830"," Not miss a potential turn."
"5667150","5670850"," And if we have a bloodbath moment, I should hold strong and cash out my hedge. "
"5670850","5672150"," Does that make sense to you?"
"5673050","5675610"," Am I a line here saying this stuff?"
"5678340","5679720"," Am I saying something wrong?"
"5689680","5690540"," You're not understanding."
"5692280","5693300"," You're not understanding."
"5693640","5694760"," You have to understand, right?"
"5695020","5703560"," You have, you have, you have, you have a, you have a, like a, like on a time frame, right?"
"5703700","5704500"," A large time frame. "
"5704720","5705820"," Year, three years, doesn't matter."
"5707120","5709380"," You get asked, you go, what's your positioning?"
"5709680","5710760"," Are you, are you bearish here?"
"5710920","5711620"," You're bullish here."
"5712140","5716260"," And I'm not, I'm not bullish yet, but I'm like, I'm looking at this going. "
"5717100","5722620"," I'm looking at this and I'm going, well, here's a low, 345, right?"
"5723260","5724840"," You have to think about this as an investor."
"5725480","5729160"," Think about this as long term, one year, three years, five years, ten years."
"5730140","5733220"," When do I start buying the market, right?"
"5734620","5736620"," If I buy this market right here, right?"
"5738080","5740040"," And I'm like, okay, you got a bear right now. "
"5740080","5741140"," So remember, we're down here."
"5741140","5743200"," People are calling for 20% from here, right?"
"5743660","5745180"," So now we're up here, right?"
"5746120","5747660"," And then I just asked, I asked the question yesterday."
"5747940","5748840"," What's, what, what's your percentage?"
"5749220","5749620"," How far down?"
"5749920","5751680"," I got told 20%. "
"5751680","5753260"," We know 20% is, right?"
"5754100","5754480"," It's right here."
"5756240","5758240"," So, so that's the capitulation phase."
"5759560","5761860"," So I probably should have bought this and this. "
"5761860","5762340"," Why?"
"5762640","5763520"," Why is the question?"
"5764200","5769740"," Because if we don't capitulate here, I didn't have any skin in the game as a long term investor."
"5770080","5770580"," Does that make sense?"
"5771760","5776240"," If I have skin in the game and we come down here, what is this?"
"5776520","5777420"," This is nothing, right?"
"5778820","5779760"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"5780220","5784700"," If this last capitulation move last a month, this is nothing, right?"
"5785160","5785620"," Does that make sense?"
"5788520","5793440"," And this despite us and show it, but we've been selling off shit for two years."
"5793440","5794220"," Three years almost. "
"5795400","5803160"," So I'm just wondering, what's, like, like the, the bear case, how much longer does the bear case"
"5803160","5807980"," sound rational to not put some skin and some risk in the game?"
"5809500","5813540"," Because basically what you're telling me is, uh, we should wait."
"5813680","5816680"," You should, you shouldn't buy shit and wait until we're down here at 2,800."
"5817480","5819440"," You should time the bottom perfectly, right?"
"5819920","5821040"," That sounds insane to me. "
"5821620","5822860"," I can sell calls."
"5823980","5825980"," I can sell puts down below."
"5826900","5829260"," I can have some, a little bit of risk as exposure. "
"5830620","5834700"," Uh, if I don't even sell this shit, it's probably going to be back up here by summer, right?"
"5835060","5841640"," I mean, like, seriously, I get the bear case over here that it makes tons of sense."
"5842420","5851220"," I made videos back here in September and November and October of 2021 and said, yeah, time to wrap"
"5851220","5851700"," it up."
"5852320","5854840"," Like the bull case wasn't making sense anymore. "
"5856520","5860660"," And so as we come down here, I'm going, yeah, you know, in a matter of fact, we got a"
"5860660","5862700"," squeeze in 2021 in Apple, right?"
"5862920","5867240"," I thought, I think we did, but to me, I was like, to me, as a, as a bull, I"
"5867240","5869420"," was like, yeah, we're getting a little crispy around here."
"5871060","5876960"," You know, so where we are right now, I'm like, you know, I'm starting to sniff around and I'm"
"5876960","5879760"," going, are they going to front run this?"
"5881220","5883460"," Do they already know that we're close to a bottom?"
"5883500","5885060"," So they're just going to start front running it."
"5886260","5887400"," Because that's what they do, right?"
"5887500","5889260"," They front run selling the market. "
"5889360","5891460"," They front run selling a recession."
"5891720","5892720"," They front run all this shit."
"5894940","5896300"," And you end up getting caught. "
"5898460","5899860"," Left behind, right?"
"5900080","5900460"," We know this."
"5900680","5901620"," We know that every see it."
"5901760","5903780"," Oh, wait, 2000 87. "
"5905240","5907760"," The 90s, 2019, 2018."
"5907880","5909240"," You guys know this happens, right?"
"5909240","5910000"," You get left behind."
"5912590","5913550"," So that's all I'm watching. "
"5913550","5915170"," The next couple of days, Wednesday."
"5915890","5917110"," I want to see what happens here."
"5918570","5921050"," Do Wednesday, do we do this nonsense right here?"
"5921390","5923890"," And, you know, do we, do we blast through?"
"5925730","5929210"," Do we get told no and start selling this down?"
"5930230","5933370"," Even if we do sell this down, how long are we down here for a week, month?"
"5934370","5938070"," We're just doing this nonsense to get back on that yellow line, right?"
"5938330","5939850"," So this is like a long term outlook. "
"5941830","5942350"," Right?"
"5942610","5943290"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"5943590","5951930"," This long term outlook looks more like you should be starting to put some risk on for a move"
"5951930","5952270"," higher."
"5955240","5957620"," If I see the red bar turn around."
"5957880","5958360"," Yeah, I'll get there. "
"5958500","5963020"," You start once seen this nonsense is red bar coming down here and we start reversing."
"5965320","5965840"," Right."
"5965940","5967040"," We start reversing here. "
"5968360","5969640"," Getting underneath 3,200."
"5970160","5970600"," Yeah, sure."
"5970600","5973980"," But I'll have time to de-risk myself up here, right?"
"5974600","5975260"," You know what I'm saying?"
"5975560","5978920"," It's like start sniffing around and you start saying, I don't know, man. "
"5979080","5980440"," There's a shark coming up from underneath."
"5981360","5984500"," The shark's been here since May, 2022."
"5995290","5996190"," So yeah, show me. "
"5996430","5998870"," I guess if you're a bear, start showing me them wrong."
"5999770","6001430"," Because you haven't shown me since May."
"6003600","6003920"," May. "
"6011390","6012230"," I want to see it."
"6013110","6014510"," I want to see the trade underneath."
"6014510","6019570"," I want to see it hold because until I see that trade underneath that holds. "
"6020190","6023890"," I can't put a heads, another heads, but I can't put a short on the market."
"6027730","6030530"," I can't justify shorting this market."
"6032650","6033730"," Until we get under. "
"6035150","6036250"," Start trading down."
"6038510","6040930"," I want to like I want to put a short right now."
"6043870","6045990"," I want to short this market right here. "
"6045990","6046450"," Truly."
"6046870","6048510"," I want to short this market right here."
"6049150","6054950"," This money is not worth me for us to swing back high over here. "
"6056310","6057630"," I'll day trade it down."
"6058810","6061710"," I'll day trade this down with you until Wednesday or whatever."
"6062230","6062890"," But I can't pull. "
"6063090","6063930"," I'm not going to do like."
"6065170","6069170"," I'm not going to do like because I know there are people out there like full, full accounts."
"6069650","6070610"," They're just like short here. "
"6071410","6072290"," I can't, man."
"6072690","6073330"," I can't."
"6075250","6076670"," So if I were you. "
"6078230","6082830"," I'd be sitting on your hands here and waiting for the for the market to tell you which way we're"
"6082830","6083130"," going."
"6087230","6089350"," If I was a if I was a market participant."
"6090010","6093660"," I'd be like. "
"6094840","6097040"," Which way is that yellow line that red line going."
"6099240","6100360"," That's what I want to know."
"6102780","6104800"," I want to know which way we're going here. "
"6107440","6109480"," Can you just imagine the next three days."
"6110320","6112500"," From Monday to Wednesday, you're going to be in here like."
"6113980","6115280"," Oh, yeah, we're doing this. "
"6115300","6116360"," Oh, yeah, we're doing that."
"6116460","6121720"," I'd rather like I'd rather like blast through confirm it and then take that short right there."
"6122940","6124060"," That's what I want to do. "
"6126270","6130610"," Can you imagine just being short in here and it just goes down like you get the bloodbath."
"6131430","6135810"," You get like the fed bloodbath and you're like, whoa, my whole account is short."
"6136450","6138310"," We do some nonsense like this. "
"6140290","6141570"," Start looking for a job."
"6143730","6145330"," Get ready to rejoin the workforce."
"6148520","6150640"," Because you're never going to come back down there again. "
"6151340","6152240"," Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"6153700","6154400"," I don't want to."
"6154620","6154920"," I'm not."
"6155140","6155620"," I'm not. "
"6157040","6159360"," I'm not willing to go back and get a job."
"6159500","6160780"," Do you think I want to go out and get a job?"
"6161440","6162560"," Get the fuck out of here."
"6173750","6175310"," Do you guys understand what I'm saying?"
"6175690","6181350"," Do you guys at least, even if you don't agree with me, do you at least understand the full story"
"6181350","6181730"," here?"
"6194130","6195310"," Yeah, we can get bearish. "
"6195490","6196530"," I'll get bearish with you."
"6198070","6199790"," And I'll get fucking full bear with you."
"6199890","6202310"," If we, if we get bearish here, if we get bearish, right?"
"6204190","6205670"," I will get bearish with you. "
"6206790","6207450"," I will go."
"6207770","6209490"," I will go balls deep bear."
"6212120","6214980"," But right now there's like, there's too much happening. "
"6216300","6218740"," There's too much from underneath the surface for me."
"6219500","6222020"," Like if I was a bear, I'd be scared shitless right now."
"6222040","6223100"," I'd be like, oh, no, man. "
"6224540","6226200"," I need to get underneath that shit."
"6226580","6227740"," You get me underneath that shit."
"6228360","6230440"," Like if I was a bear, I'd be like, get me under that thing. "
"6230920","6235380"," I don't want to have some big ass whale shark coming up underneath that I can't see."
"6236620","6239700"," And I don't want to see this like, I just don't want to see it."
"6243140","6244340"," I don't want to see that shit. "
"6249600","6250800"," You want to see it on a monthly?"
"6254450","6256090"," You guys want to see some cool shit?"
"6267940","6269760"," I want to show you the momentum slowing."
"6272250","6274130"," This is a monthly chart right here, right?"
"6276330","6279130"," You see that slowing momentum going down?"
"6279650","6280110"," You see that?"
"6285080","6290220"," You start to see less purple bars, less purple bars, less purple bars, less purple bars."
"6291040","6293420"," You see we have that momentum come up and down. "
"6295120","6296460"," You see that right there?"
"6298920","6300360"," This is a monthly SPX."
"6303020","6303940"," You see what I'm saying here?"
"6304340","6310940"," If you get caught in here and you're a bear, this PPO and PMO is the weekly."
"6314020","6315960"," Do you see what's sneaking up underneath here?"
"6316960","6317320"," This is the weekly. "
"6321860","6322700"," This is the weekly."
"6322940","6324280"," You see what's sneaking up underneath?"
"6324540","6328680"," If you're a bear, I want you to know that underneath, right?"
"6329100","6330720"," See how these green bars are coming up?"
"6332380","6334740"," Do you see how this one right here?"
"6335160","6335940"," Look at this."
"6335980","6337940"," This is the crash in 2020. "
"6339000","6339780"," Look at this."
"6341140","6343100"," Do you see what's sneaking up from underneath?"
"6344500","6345420"," I'm warning you."
"6345500","6347300"," If you're up, I mean, I'll get bearish with you. "
"6348640","6349860"," But I'm warning you."
"6350000","6353920"," There is some momentum coming up underneath here, right?"
"6354720","6357080"," That is giving me pause right now."
"6357840","6360040"," My stance back here, shit. "
"6360160","6361160"," My stance was right here."
"6361740","6362540"," Was bearish."
"6362880","6364920"," Matter of fact, I sold equities. "
"6365680","6367820"," I sold spec growth back in 2020."
"6367820","6372820"," Matter of fact, horse lower fat and I were asked on fin to it in 2020 in December."
"6373380","6374240"," There's a tweet somewhere. "
"6374560","6377220"," People were asking, are you going to buy equities in 2021?"
"6377580","6379020"," Horse lower fat was like, fuck no."
"6379120","6380160"," And I was like, no way."
"6380540","6384440"," I think I even emailed or DM'd horse and said, are you going to buy any spec growth?"
"6384440","6385260"," And he said, hell no. "
"6385260","6392320"," And we went and traded the S&P 500 for 2021, excuse me."
"6392400","6392940"," Yeah, 2021."
"6393380","6394280"," We traded the S&P 500. "
"6395660","6395840"," Right?"
"6396380","6399360"," So you're like more bearish bear or whatever this is right here, right?"
"6399660","6400140"," Right here."
"6400700","6402120"," Starting to get bearish."
"6403160","6403240"," Right?"
"6403600","6404800"," I got super bearish in here. "
"6404980","6407300"," Then we blasted higher, eventually rolled over."
"6407600","6407700"," Right?"
"6408720","6409700"," Does it come down here?"
"6409860","6413420"," I'm like, man, I don't know, like this right here looks right."
"6414060","6415400"," This right here looks right. "
"6416260","6417700"," All this looks right to me."
"6418040","6418460"," Right is rain."
"6419980","6420380"," Underneath. "
"6420700","6421140"," Right is rain."
"6423800","6424100"," Right?"
"6427020","6430880"," So I don't know if it's a year or three years, but I'll tell you what, if you're bearish, you"
"6430880","6434360"," have a bearish stance, I would be at least the minimum."
"6437640","6443720"," At least like a prairie dog have your head up and be like, the fuck is going on around here. "
"6446200","6447260"," At least have your head up."
"6447260","6452760"," If you're a bear, at least, you know, don't consider this price action next few days."
"6453060","6454500"," You want to be looking at the next week. "
"6455060","6456580"," We're looking at what the Fed says."
"6457420","6463200"," You want to know exactly what's happening underneath the surface of the market."
"6464120","6468780"," And I want you to at least have a firm understanding that underneath the surface of the market. "
"6468960","6470300"," A weekly and monthly time frame."
"6472700","6475760"," There's like a whale shark underneath just waiting to grab your ass."
"6481920","6482760"," Yeah, exactly. "
"6483000","6485300"," I'm just like, you know, you're like embarrassing."
"6485720","6487260"," I'm sitting underneath the hole."
"6487500","6487520"," Right?"
"6487680","6488940"," Embarrass, embarrass, embarrass. "
"6489300","6493800"," And then I'm like, wait a minute, stick my head up and I'm like, what's going on?"
"6495700","6498540"," You know, I need to see that shit break."
"6499900","6502420"," I need to see a break underneath 394, 396."
"6503100","6503880"," I want to see it hold. "
"6506080","6508880"," If I can't get that confirmation, I can't be bearish right now."
"6510480","6511260"," I need it."
"6511900","6512640"," I need it bad. "
"6513640","6518200"," Well, not only, not only do I need it to break, like I need this to break."
"6518680","6523100"," And I want to see like rejection, rejection and start heading lower."
"6524680","6527120"," I'll take the, I'll take the short right there. "
"6527280","6528180"," That's where I'll take the short."
"6528680","6530040"," What is that 390, let's say?"
"6531680","6533320"," So 390, I'll take that short."
"6534560","6534860"," Right there. "
"6535420","6536020"," I'll take that one."
"6538700","6543500"," I'll tell you what, if they scam, if they make you load up your whole entire account short in here,"
"6543820","6544600"," I'd be sketchy."
"6544760","6546380"," I'm super sketchy. "
"6547720","6550440"," Get some fuel from you for a run higher."
"6553880","6555340"," It's super sketchy."
"6557000","6560960"," I don't trust, I'm not trusting these banks right now. "
"6562940","6564100"," I don't trust them."
"6566820","6569460"," Like I've stopped looking at sentiment gauges."
"6569460","6572580"," I've stopped looking at the shit we're being fed. "
"6572920","6574720"," Like I just stopped listening to it the past week."
"6574820","6575540"," I'm like, I can't."
"6575760","6576640"," I'm like, I'm done. "
"6576960","6580460"," I've had everybody out there like dropping all kinds of shit on me."
"6580460","6582060"," And I'm like, I can't look at any of this stuff."
"6584490","6585330"," Like I can't. "
"6585990","6589610"," I've seen this happen before."
"6590090","6592390"," Like, you know, it's neat too."
"6592510","6595710"," Last night, late last night, I watched a video on YouTube and again. "
"6595710","6597470"," Like I said, I'm not going to name names."
"6597470","6603270"," Guy goes on YouTube last night and he said, we're going to have a marked crash between now and"
"6603270","6603950"," Wednesday."
"6604910","6606030"," I'm going to have a marked crash. "
"6606210","6608410"," And I was like, yeah, I can see that."
"6609450","6611430"," And I see why you're saying that."
"6612210","6619470"," And then I tried to go back to previous instances in the stock market all weekend. "
"6619470","6627510"," I spent the entire weekend looking at previous instances with the VIX when it gets repriced."
"6628810","6630530"," And I'll tell you what, man, it looks the same."
"6632430","6634330"," The market's going to make a move higher, right?"
"6635110","6636530"," We look right at market crash. "
"6638770","6639310"," We do."
"6640050","6642870"," Like when the VIX gets repriced, we do."
"6642950","6644090"," We look like we're going to have a market crash. "
"6646850","6650550"," So, man, I don't know."
"6658520","6661140"," Yeah, the one problem with this or the one problem."
"6661540","6663840"," Okay, so let's talk about the counter argument. "
"6664040","6664940"," That's what I'm saying to you."
"6665340","6667000"," So Jimmy Perry is making a good point."
"6667820","6670180"," He said inflation, right?"
"6670760","6672780"," I have some problems with this thesis. "
"6673400","6673620"," I do."
"6675040","6677740"," I have some major problems with this thesis."
"6678680","6683060"," One of my major problems is not so much inflation. "
"6683360","6686920"," One of my major problems is an FOMC pennant."
"6688540","6690200"," Usually we have a bloodbath."
"6691900","6693180"," Usually, like historically. "
"6695020","6696080"," Love a bloodbath."
"6697580","6701740"," My other major issue with this thesis is you don't have high unemployment."
"6705680","6708900"," So, how do I deal with that counter argument?"
"6709720","6715880"," And I can't say that if this is a bottom, that it's going to last. "
"6716460","6719120"," I think it's something that's like a year to three years."
"6720100","6724440"," Have we seen something where the market's like bottoms for five to ten year run?"
"6724820","6725440"," Probably not."
"6726700","6728620"," That is an asterisk, I guess. "
"6732060","6738900"," But we're starting to look like we're starting to look like many times in previous decades where we"
"6738900","6740720"," get like a one to three year run."
"6742220","6747420"," Maybe not the five to ten year run, but like a one to three year sideways and up."
"6748340","6751100"," One to three years where we slow grind it up. "
"6751980","6753300"," We can even have a melt up."
"6753920","6758700"," It's becoming more apparent that that's probably where we're headed."
"6760520","6768500"," And so I guess, so I'm looking at that saying that would give the time for the Fed to pivot"
"6768500","6769200"," down the road. "
"6769880","6775060"," It would give the time for that last bloodbath to match uptime employment coming up higher."
"6776860","6782380"," I guess my just on the large scale like time wise though."
"6783140","6786840"," Time wise for the next one to three years, man. "
"6787060","6792660"," Like some stuff is saying that we've hit some kind of bottom."
"6794240","6796060"," And think about that goal post thing."
"6797520","6798940"," Think about that goal post. "
"6799160","6800460"," The goal post thing is key here."
"6801360","6802400"," The goal post thing is key."
"6802400","6808000"," Can't be talking about fucking 360 right or 3600 or 3200. "
"6808500","6815520"," When just a couple months ago we were talking about mid 2000s low 2000s 16."
"6815520","6816800"," You can't move the goal post."
"6817000","6817460"," My point. "
"6818560","6818860"," Right."
"6819120","6820080"," You can't keep moving."
"6820400","6820880"," Not keep. "
"6821600","6822860"," You can't remember in May."
"6823340","6824420"," Remember in May."
"6824880","6825460"," Remember in August. "
"6825760","6826620"," Remember in October."
"6827920","6830220"," You guys have to remember this like 2022 right."
"6832040","6835980"," It was the entire discussion was how deep does it go. "
"6836840","6838320"," How bad does it get?"
"6838960","6839960"," Remember the narrative."
"6841000","6842140"," How deep does it go?"
"6842400","6843080"," How bad does it get?"
"6844120","6845380"," Is it full collapsed time?"
"6845940","6847120"," This is like the newspapers."
"6847520","6849380"," This is magazine articles. "
"6849680","6850040"," This is CNBC."
"6850600","6852280"," This is people that we trust."
"6853920","6856700"," These are people from institutions. "
"6858360","6858780"," Right."
"6858980","6859680"," You're saying to yourself."
"6859780","6860240"," Shit man. "
"6860520","6862920"," I have to be a bear here because what if it does go there."
"6863340","6866520"," But you know it's time passes and we start to trade higher."
"6867480","6868500"," And we're not right now. "
"6868580","6870960"," We're trading four four four three right."
"6872420","6873760"," You start to question it."
"6873780","6874680"," You start to say well. "
"6875460","6877400"," If we're at three forty five and started selling."
"6878540","6880140"," Man I'd be scared shitless right."
"6883620","6886620"," You know if we're going to trade to three five. "
"6886620","6887260"," We're going to trade to three thousand here."
"6887440","6889560"," Shouldn't I just put a hedge on right."
"6890180","6892180"," It's like just like stance. "
"6892420","6893820"," What's your stance right now?"
"6893880","6896160"," Your stance as a bear or a bull."
"6898940","6900200"," I guess that's my question."
"6911640","6912120"," Yeah. "
"6912260","6913420"," I'm game for puts there."
"6913560","6914980"," Like I'm game for trading this down."
"6915600","6917160"," I'm game for people loading up. "
"6917300","6919020"," I'm game for people taking profit here."
"6919020","6921020"," I'm game for trading this down next few days."
"6922300","6926320"," I'm game for I'm actually game for lower than four. "
"6926320","6927780"," So this 396 here."
"6928220","6930900"," I'm actually on board for like a rotational trade here."
"6931180","6939320"," I'm actually game to 360 believe it or not open to even that but You have to the the stance"
"6939320","6946980"," that you're in Stand the stance that you're in so in this this actually this actually works with"
"6946980","6954900"," JPM collar If JPM makes their collar at 360 3600 and that's that's their new collar trade Right"
"6954900","6957700"," three thirty six hundred is not fucking twenty eight hundred. "
"6957700","6958580"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"6959840","6967420"," You can see you start to pull his pieces together and you go Are we have we found a bottom"
"6967420","6971860"," right Captain Jim saying we might have found a bottom He thinks it's possible."
"6971980","6972720"," We found a bottom."
"6973140","6977200"," So You know, let's say we trade to 360, right?"
"6977420","6978160"," Let's say we train this. "
"6978160","6979400"," They're all the arguments, right?"
"6980120","6986780"," Let's say a train to 360 down here Right still a higher low, right to get what I'm saying like"
"6986780","6995720"," see you start to wonder Because this is still a higher low so like all of these things we're"
"6995720","6999420"," talking about you can't be a bear out there and be like You know kept Jim."
"7000100","7001820"," We're going to the depths of hell and I'm like, okay."
"7002000","7011790"," Well JPM's now saying we're not right I Don't know man, so let's say we train to"
"7011790","7021230"," 360 Right JPM's now saying 360 Let's say we train to 320 how long does that last this is it"
"7021230","7021810"," last a month?"
"7022870","7027630"," Does that signal the bottom 320 Couldn't I just buy it?"
"7028190","7035510"," Couldn't I just hold long Underlying stock positions for a month and I'd still be right Right, so"
"7035510","7036890"," one three months down the road. "
"7037670","7046330"," I'm trying to find out here What I'm trying to find out here from you like Price really isn't a"
"7046330","7055350"," matter isn't really the concern here The real concern here is Was this a bottom back here are we"
"7055350","7057730"," confirming a bottom does it get front run from here?"
"7058270","7061070"," Do we not trade down the 28 or 3800?"
"7061170","7063430"," How long do we how long do we stay down there for a month?"
"7064930","7066610"," You seen if I bought Tesla over here."
"7066730","7069050"," I could just hold it for a month and I'd be right back to flat."
"7069430","7073410"," That's what you're telling me You understand how long does it last?"
"7074650","7081630"," How long is the pain if we do go there a Month or a year and a half Like a"
"7081630","7083970"," month yeah, I can deal with that year and a half. "
"7083990","7089750"," Maybe not Right Yeah, yeah get get my point here."
"7091110","7099870"," I don't I don't try to find a reason not to be bullish even with price I'm trying to find"
"7099870","7109210"," like a fundamental reason Look at them just trapping all these buyers in here just trapping them"
"7111050","7116790"," I'm trying to find like a Because because because the answer is I'm gonna tell you what the answer"
"7116790","7123310"," is And this one trying to get you two in your own brain And this is this is the key"
"7123310","7126310"," here is the key in your own brain like your own."
"7127030","7138830"," Whoa look at that Hold on a second here Nope that's wrong Nope"
"7138830","7148470"," that's wrong My uh my point to you is this is that My point to you here is that Think"
"7148470","7155690"," about the thick the bare thesis or the bull thesis Think about the bull and bare thesis here I come"
"7155690","7165610"," come back around with me and say to yourself Am I am I is my thesis bull or bear And"
"7165610","7172910"," I don't think bears just so if you're gonna maintain the bare thesis If you're gonna maintain the"
"7172910","7183110"," bare thesis then it's not 360 And it's not 3000 It can't be We"
"7183110","7190310"," could blast down from here down to 3600 hit the JPM caller Right we could blast down to 2800 for"
"7190310","7199590"," a month Come back up And this would be like this would be like start a summer spring summer and"
"7200410","7201130"," I'm a bull. "
"7201330","7202110"," I still got my money."
"7202290","7203930"," I've been making money all along the way."
"7204110","7204690"," I'm bullish. "
"7205010","7215310"," I'm DC and That's the worst that can happen to me That's the worst I don't That's"
"7215310","7223290"," not bearish That's looking for a bottom That's starting to that's starting to get a that's starting"
"7223290","7234040"," that's starting to look for uh entry into this market That that should bring out buyers That"
"7234040","7239380"," should bring up buyers looking for a bottom and that's my point So my assumption is going to be"
"7239380","7248960"," this so we haven't proven it yet But my my assumption here is that My assumption here is that going"
"7248960","7253940"," forward My assumption here is going forward, right?"
"7254100","7263580"," Let me let me make the final thesis statement Expect bulls to be looking to dollar cost"
"7263580","7273240"," average I don't know a 360 3,300 if the if it even if it even presents itself Expect"
"7273240","7282360"," sideline cash to step in expect demand between now and march Hoping that they can buy a low And"
"7282360","7292280"," that that is a that is a positional change Uh for market participants large and small I"
"7292280","7300720"," think you're going to see uh, mid-large banks retail Between now and march looking for a bottom to"
"7300720","7310880"," buy And they're just begging and hoping to to have that opportunity And"
"7310880","7312560"," that's that I'll count myself in there."
"7312560","7322060"," So If you present me at any point For the briefest moment With 360 or 3,000 or 3,800"
"7322060","7330420"," between now and spring i'm fucking buying it I'm going to buy the fuck out of it And I think"
"7330420","7340800"," and I truly think that that is uh I truly think that that is the truth that you've got The"
"7340800","7350800"," bear case is switching to the bull case I think that the I think that if the bull is now"
"7351440","7358320"," They saw tassel hit 100 now they're saying yeah, you know what Uh, give me that cheap buy man hit"
"7358320","7361820"," me with 100 bucks Slap my face with 100 again."
"7362240","7364080"," Slap my face with 60 40. "
"7364480","7365180"," What can you throw at me?"
"7365260","7370920"," How long is it going to be down there for a month Do it double double dog dare you triple"
"7370920","7376120"," dog dare you get what i'm saying So I think that the bear case you've you had a bear case"
"7376120","7387490"," now since december 2020 I think at this point Uh, if you're a bull bring it on Bring"
"7387490","7399470"," it on Give me a discount No fair down here none Seriously"
"7402350","7410570"," Zero, let me start buying this market There's a fundamental shift and uh where we are and"
"7418060","7435750"," what we're thinking fundamental shift Oh,"
"7435770","7437550"," yeah, you got trick arms bonds or sex here."
"7437610","7442050"," Yeah, I mean, but did you guys look at uh, hyg Do you guys look at the move index?"
"7442690","7444610"," You guys looking at you guys show me something."
"7444890","7445970"," I'll show you a bunch of stuff. "
"7446110","7451230"," You want to see vix looking bearish I show you that I can show you the vix going down."
"7451390","7461270"," I can show you the vix being bearish right now if you want Yeah, we've seen uh, we've seen"
"7461270","7469730"," the market decouple We have historical precedents For rates to remain in place and to go higher and"
"7469730","7475990"," the market to go higher along with the fed We have historical preference uh, precedence at multiple"
"7475990","7485470"," times historically for the for drone Powell to maintain rates Add rates or or increased rates and"
"7485470","7491310"," the market's actually decouple from uh downward move and start to begin the trade sideways and"
"7491310","7494410"," higher We've seen that I'm trying."
"7494590","7496850"," I mean My thesis is pretty good. "
"7496930","7497390"," It's that great."
"7497630","7503810"," There's a few small things in here There's a very small things in here that could could punch a"
"7503810","7506290"," hole in my thesis, but My thesis is man."
"7506410","7513830"," I've been trying I spent this weekend Trying to punch a hole in it like a major hole like This"
"7513830","7519410"," is really bad or yeah, this doesn't make sense Or what if this happened?"
"7519410","7524790"," What if that happened like backtraced it back tested it It's back historically and I'm like man. "
"7524850","7529450"," I don't know like If you had a if you've got a like a I think it was Thomas Edison"

"8226980","8229559"," longs and take their money and run, right?"
"8229980","8231080"," Look at look at this stance."
"8231200","8238680"," Think about this stance I Was long the market And I wanted to take profit does that make sense?"
"8238799","8247700"," So I I take profit And now I'm waiting For the market to find some new lows so that I"
"8247700","8254219"," can reenter the market Right And I can enter the market right and I can deploy cash to make any"
"8254219","8257420"," money does that make sense That's a bearish stance. "
"8257820","8264559"," You understand I take the money out of the market I Ran around you guys saw me on social media,"
"8264780","8264900"," right?"

"8289879","8296879"," I'm like, oh man Any dip I find I'm buying I want some exposure in the market to make sense."
"8296920","8300799"," I'm gonna start buying some shit That's not a bear stance."
"8300860","8310860"," I'm sorry You got to understand the Do you understand"
"8310860","8320700"," the fundamental difference between taking profit after a bull run And then looking for a dip to"
"8320700","8330360"," actually buy You found me that way Right on right on"
"8330360","8340280"," Zacharized think Do you guys understand So that's my point to you My point"
"8340280","8345760"," to you is there's a fundamental shift coming to the market Where a bull is looking for a dip to"
"8345760","8351440"," buy you need to be hyper aware of that If you're a bear you need to be hyper aware of"
"8351440","8359840"," that You need to know That there's a there's a structural shift Underneath the market right now of"
"8359840","8367440"," bulls not trying to sell out of positions and take profit They're trying to buy into positions for"
"8367440","8375080"," at least one to three years And I want you to be hyper aware of that. "
"8375160","8376360"," We're gonna talk about this today."
"8376600","8381719"," This will be the last time I talk about it You'll never hear me speak about this again We're going"
"8381719","8390440"," to revisit this In nine months or a year All right, so we'll replay this video or I'll cut some"
"8390440","8395380"," snippets of it I'm going to show you snip if we even if we blast down for a month to"
"8395380","8399280"," 2800 or 3000 It's like a quick let rip down a quick rip back up."
"8399640","8408140"," So I pretty much covered every base except for What the bear thesis is and that would be that we"
"8408140","8413160"," blast down to 3000 not only we hold it But we continue bloodbath in it down to like the mid"
"8413160","8422700"," 2000s Sorry mid 2000s and then down to the 1400s because that's the only other case That's the only"
"8422700","8432640"," other case So if i'm wrong If i'm wrong Then we're going to 3000"
"8432640","8437740"," and we're going to hold it and we're going to go down in the mid mid to low 2000 and"
"8437740","8445500"," like 14 1600 or something And the next year to three years that's where we're going And we're not"
"8445500","8446720"," going up we're not going sideways. "
"8447280","8453840"," We're not going to have a quick blast down and quick back up Bear thesis doesn't work If you're"
"8453840","8458460"," going to go like have a quick blast down to 3000 and back up in a month You can't expect"
"8458460","8466120"," a retail trader to time that if a retail trader an investor can Close enough catch a bottom and"
"8466120","8472300"," then just hold And they're still good a month later and that's a that's a bull case man period"
"8473640","8481060"," Especially the s&p 500 So Yeah, there's a fundamental shift coming."
"8481380","8486720"," I know that there are bulls out there that are sniffing around or traders or investors That are"
"8486720","8486900"," going."
"8487200","8491180"," Ah, I don't know like I think I think I think this is the high probability trade. "
"8491460","8499360"," This is the high probability Exposure that I need Can you imagine like not exposing yourself to"
"8499360","8503540"," some of this risk and then we do go higher What do I do get back on fin to it"
"8503540","8509560"," and find some guy and say hey man, you said we're gonna blast down to 1600 We never did here."
"8509640","8515760"," He's gonna do is gonna disappear Gone He's gonna come back and say I'm sorry."
"8515860","8524520"," I made the wrong call Gone You know, so the bull case is here the bull case is you buy"
"8524520","8531020"," bottoms down here You're gonna put some some insurance on in case we blast down for a month. "
"8531120","8539200"," That's gonna pay you too The only bear case that I see here but still relevant Is no cap or"
"8539200","8539780"," going to 3000."
"8540180","8545260"," We're gonna go down then go down another thousand points or I don't know 600 or 800 And then"
"8545260","8546520"," possibly another six or 800."
"8546680","8552080"," That's the only bear case that I see here Sorry, that's it man. "
"8552080","8553280"," Like that's truly it."
"8553540","8560880"," We're not moving the goal posts We're not moving the goal posts to where 360 is the bloodbath We're"
"8560880","8567660"," not moving the goal posts To 3000 is the bloodbath because I sat there when we're at 345 and I"
"8567660","8571360"," remember everyone saying We're going down to 2800."
"8571480","8577500"," We're going down to I don't know fucking 1600 2400 Even I was scared of that. "
"8577640","8577900"," I'll be honest."
"8578160","8581600"," I mean I was like shit are we going down there Are we going down to 1600 are we gonna"
"8581600","8583600"," have a market meltdown to collapse in the economy?"

"8591940","8600600"," can't keep calling prying wolf And You know if I had just bought 345 and then just bought 3000 I"
"8600600","8608800"," could have exposure in this market Put my money to work man I mean you just watched Tesla go from"
"8608800","8617040"," 100 bucks to 178 or something right Something insane Uh, this is like owning stock."
"8617400","8618640"," This isn't an option. "
