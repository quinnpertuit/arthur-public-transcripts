"23110","25230"," We'll have to see if this is any better."
"29000","33760"," So I'm setting up multiple monitors, and this is not working."
"35720","37740"," I'm gonna have to do a dual setup. "
"38140","49290"," Let's check"
"49290","60220"," on Tesla, check"
"60220","60680"," one too."
"61200","62740"," You guys have audio?"
"66890","67910"," You guys can hear me?"
"68130","69250"," There's no latency on this one."
"69830","74470"," I just changed the bit rates for the uploads. "
"74550","77750"," I went down right in FPS and the bit rates."
"77750","79390"," So I went from 2,500."
"79770","85650"," I think Joe Donut yesterday was saying that the uploads on the gigs, on the giga plan is not as"
"85650","86590"," good as the downloads. "
"87570","92670"," So I'm gonna have to do an upload test to see if my bit rate is set too high for"
"92670","93150"," this package."
"98070","100210"," Yeah, Joe, so oh, you're here, Joe."
"100750","102330"," I did not buy hood yesterday. "
"103030","104070"," I'm waiting for Friday."
"104430","105090"," I'm so cheap."
"106130","107170"," I haven't even checked it yet. "
"107630","112170"," I've been work, so I got this new internet program, but I think I had to go back in just"
"112170","122370"," now and reset my, what, my bit rate, and"
"122370","127330"," then a conversion between the streaming software and YouTube."
"132740","133660"," Let me look at hood."
"136450","138970"," I did not buy hood shit. "
"141000","143000"," I did not buy hood yesterday."
"143680","145840"," I'm so cheap, I wanted it like 15 bucks."
"148020","155800"," We talked about buying calls yesterday too on hood, that $16, and look at it's cranking. "
"157280","161580"," That's crazy, up 5%."
"165820","173360"," I do need the, you know, it's weird, so Henry, so I was discussing this morning with a friend."
"173900","175820"," I love that AMD Threadripper. "
"175820","185020"," Even the 1600, the AMD 1600's got a really neat little thing in it to stream on one computer, so"
"185020","189260"," I've got these two laptops that I wanted to dedicate to the stream."
"190700","199760"," What sucks is that their Intel Core i5s, eighth generation, but I've got two of them, so what I"
"199760","208400"," bought today was a, I bought a Delgado, so I'm basically running two GPUs"
"208400","211400"," together, I'm gonna sync them together."
"211780","213440"," It just, it hasn't arrived in the mail yet. "
"216560","221900"," So I'll run the streaming on one, basically I'm running a dual core computer, but I'm waiting for"
"221900","225260"," it to arrive in the mail because I'm running monitors off both."
"226040","235040"," I'm running BookMap, which is, BookMap runs off four gigs of RAM, and so I've got so much going on"
"235040","237700"," in this one processor right now, I need two processors."
"239040","244060"," So I got the Delgado coming in the mail, cost a couple hundred bucks, and what it does is they"
"244060","249260"," can bring, I can basically use two computers, one computer to run the streaming, and then another"
"249260","257279"," computer to run BookMap and the processing, the video. "
"264270","270170"," Yeah, so I was so cheap, I wanted, I wanted, I'm still waiting for it to happen, I'm still gonna"
"270170","275810"," wait for, I'm not gonna chase hood today, I'm gonna wait for hood, I'm betting on hood dumping into"
"275810","284090"," Friday, I should have bought the dip though yesterday on hood, and as a matter of fact, Joe and I"
"284090","291170"," both had calls on hood, and I sold mine early, Joe held onto his, and I think the original ones"
"291170","301060"," we had were dated for March for the ER run up, and I got a little too greedy yesterday, and"
"301060","309480"," you've got Tesla trading higher too, they're at 1080, they're crashing right into a wall right now,"
"312140","321680"," they've got a sell wall at 1079, but it's being consumed right now, and it's a really weird thing,"
"321940","326900"," because you've seen that we've got more sellers than buyers, and the Hero Indicator is negative"
"326900","328260"," right now, but we're going higher."
"328860","336740"," So, I wanna see what happens here as we're up here, and that your next level to above 1080 is"
"336740","344800"," 1100, and then I'll show you another one, especially if you're long Tesla, my assumption is that"
"344800","350860"," there's some really nice hedging coming into the market, you've got clear skies above 1100 by the"
"350860","356340"," way, so if Tesla does make a move higher this morning, you've got some clear skies, you could get"
"356340","368850"," some, probably have some shorts coming off this morning, so"
"368850","377610"," just like running a gaming rig, if you're running a gaming rig, so I don't have a game, so I've"
"377610","382750"," got two business computers that are, they're souped up for business, but I can tie both computers"
"382750","390830"," together like a gaming rig, so basically what I've been doing is running book map on one commute"
"390830","398390"," computer, and using the computing power to run book map and any other shit I wanna run, and then it"
"398390","408210"," sends it across the Delgado a live stream with low latency to the"
"408210","414470"," other computer that's running the other labor intensive stream labs OBS stream."
"416290","421450"," Because right now I'm running it all off, and then I've got monitors like monitors on the side,"
"421950","427310"," peripheral monitors on the same main rig, so I'm running like book map, I'm running stream labs,"
"427770","433690"," I'm running monitors all off one rig right now, it's just, it's too much for one rig, it's usually"
"433690","441790"," even too much for one gaming rig, so what you do is you just tie two computers together, and I'm"
"441790","445250"," just waiting for it to come in the mail, and the moment, the weirdest part is the moment that I,"
"445310","449850"," well not weird, but the moment that I am plugged my other monitors off this computer this morning,"
"450310","456690"," after I started to have frames freeze, I am plugged by peripherals, and it ran just fine. "
"457670","462470"," And there's no latency anymore, even on your end, I can see my other monitor for the YouTube live"
"462470","469530"," stream is just a few seconds, you guys are getting me like 20 seconds after I speak."
"478910","479790"," Yeah, no, that's badass."
"480330","486970"," So at this point, I had to decide if I was gonna get a new AMD, the, I think it"
"486970","491550"," was the 1600 or something, I was gonna be like, was it, am I gonna get a new rig, a"
"491550","494370"," new tower, or am I gonna just tie two computers together?"
"494930","501230"," Because these two computers alone cost me 1600 bucks each or something, so I'm already like three"
"501230","508030"," grand into these two computers, so I'm like, well, maybe I'll do is I'll put these two computers"
"508030","513049"," together, and just, I'll tie, I'm basically turning two laptops into a gaming rig. "
"519330","520870"," Yeah, you should see a rip today."
"521470","523310"," I'm more afraid of the front running."
"523550","528790"," The point is that you should see the market go higher today, but then it's sell down at some point. "
"529810","532330"," But I don't know if they're gonna front run it today or not."
"532850","536670"," There's real concern, this is real concern that this is still going to happen."
"538010","547830"," I got six monitors in my gaming laptop, it's AMD, but I did upgrade the"
"547830","548550"," RAM to 32. "
"553260","559740"," Yeah, so check out the Delgado, it's called the D-E-L-G-A-D-O, or ATO."
"561460","568760"," It's like this, and that's the other thing, so I've got a Sony camera I'm trying to hook up for,"
"568960","570960"," so I want to be able to take live video."
"571700","577520"," So look at all this stuff I gotta hook up, like I gotta hook up a Sony A600, or A6000"
"577520","584520"," camera, because I wanna do the live stream so you guys can see me, so I can talk to you"
"584520","585120"," from my office. "
"585860","592740"," So I've got that big camera rig, then I've got a microphone that is intensive, right?"
"594060","599320"," If you have the name of the microphone is, or the kind of microphone it is, but I've got this"
"599320","606980"," special microphone, that's labor, or that's GPU intensive, then I've got three monitors, then I've"
"606980","616980"," got just a loan, just book map alone, runs on four gigabytes of GPU, that's not even"
"616980","622720"," just the normal system processes, and I don't know what streamlabs runs off, but streamlabs sucks"
"622720","630780"," tons of GPU as well, and then I'm running other stuff, I'm running candlestick charts on Weebull"
"630780","637520"," that are up to the minute, up to the milliseconds, and then I'm running Thinkorswim for a volume"
"637520","642520"," profile, Thinkorswim's labor or intensive on the computer, I've got all this crap running in the"
"642520","649620"," background, so it's like I'm running like two or three video games, I'm running a bunch of"
"649620","659580"," different monitors and stuff, no, no, no, not front running OPEX, so OPEX took place on"
"659580","666440"," Friday, so what I'm talking to you about is that, so the week after we're still in OPEX in a"
"666440","671660"," way, because it's a quarterly OPEX, we still have hedging coming out of the market on the call and"
"671660","676040"," put side, so you have all these mechanics running in the background right now, right?"
"676820","684040"," And you've got volatility that could, there's a high probability of volatility coming into the"
"684040","687200"," markets between Friday and Monday."
"688420","694120"," The fear is that they front run it today or tomorrow, we also know that we've got a pin at"
"694120","704180"," 4,800 on the spy, specifically into Friday, and"
"704180","708860"," you've got hedging coming in, so you're watching right now, I don't know if you guys got flow out"
"708860","714840"," go, but you can see hedging flowing in this morning into the market, and if you guys are watching"
"714840","722560"," CNBC this morning, there was, there was this, matter of fact yesterday in CNBC, people were pumping"
"722560","729720"," up tech, people were saying that even though the foot was coming off the gas in terms of the Fed,"
"729720","734080"," that you can see our market healing, that was really bizarre."
"734620","741600"," You heard this morning, all the news about the Decepticon virus is, no one's getting sick, it's not"
"741600","747920"," as bad as they talk about it's weird, they're using the news to justify the market going up today,"
"748680","754280"," they're using the news to pump the market, probably grind up into tomorrow, but that doesn't mean"
"754280","758380"," that we don't, all these actions that are taking place should bring volatility in the market. "
"758920","759640"," It's almost guaranteed."
"761100","762880"," Now the question is, when does it happen?"
"763380","768260"," Does it happen today, does it happen tomorrow, does it happen Monday, and do you get caught in that"
"768260","769160"," volatility?"
"769860","775620"," So oftentimes what happens is, you get very bullish, we go higher, you're stoked, you're pumped, I"
"775620","782420"," do the same thing, and then in the overnight hours, we get this massive sell-down, and we don't"
"782420","787700"," know when that takes place, and if you get caught in that massive sell-down, you end up getting"
"787700","788520"," burned, right?"
"788960","790060"," Veritably you get burned."
"797240","800080"," We're seeing some real nice call structure coming in across the market. "
"800880","806560"," We're gonna take a look at, so Tesla's looking great right now, they're at 10.75, coming in at 10 "
"806560","815320",".80, the hood's looking amazing, I can't believe hood's up there, I'm so stoked that hood's up"
"815320","822960"," there, super stoked, Tesla's now only down by 10, I didn't be able to up a percent, plus two"
"822960","831920"," points, they're at 2.25, if IWM at any point breaks 228, there would be more shorts coming off to"
"831920","840440"," send it to 230 and above, RK is up 2 "
"840440","849220",".65%, which is insane, so shorts are being lifted on RK, GME's up"
"849220","857680"," 1%, snaps up 2%, SQ"
"857680","867530"," is up 2.74%, what's in, is Nvidia up right now, I'm hoping that Nvidia's"
"867530","877420"," up, Facebook's up 1%, Netflix's up 1.5%,"
"877980","887280"," XBI is up 2.24%, Peton is up 7%, Viacom is up"
"887280","897640"," 3%, TQQ up 1%, Nvidia's up 0.7%, it's okay, I"
"897640","898780"," wanna see what Amazon's doing."
"904170","913490"," Yeah, Amazon's a straight moonshot, it's at 34, 12.47, so if all these shorts being lifted, this is"
"913490","922410"," excellent for the market, and they're still trying to, so Rivian is up"
"922410","951210"," 4%, RIVN, they're a moonshot to 103, if"
"951210","955110"," you guys got tickers you wanna see, if they're gonna keep ripping, let me know right in the"
"955110","965080"," comments, give me the show Nvidia right now, see if Nvidia's"
"965080","978300"," gonna make an even bigger move higher, Nvidia's"
"978300","988260"," lagging slightly versus other tech stocks at the moment, do we gonna bring up, do we gonna bring up"
"988260","998710"," Neo4U next, if"
"998710","1007350"," you've got light resistance on Nvidia at 305, 310, 315, there's no real wall on Nvidia until 320,"
"1011160","1024670"," you've got massive supply here in Nvidia at 295, there's"
"1024670","1028270"," no, you've got nothing looking above until 320 on Nvidia."
"1033170","1035470"," All right, Hank, I'm gonna do these one at a time, okay?"
"1036569","1043089"," You guys have Nvidia, you guys can hear me, so Nvidia you've got supply at 295, and you've got of"
"1043089","1051930"," clear skies to 320 and 330, I'm gonna do"
"1054200","1071020"," MU next, because I know some of you guys are wrapped up in MU, I'll"
"1071020","1081040"," do, I'll check on AMD, Neo, I'll check on MU and Facebook, I'll"
"1081040","1083260"," check on UPSC, it's just gonna be just a minute, okay?"
"1083940","1120030"," As these things load, I gotta load these one at a time, it's"
"1120030","1130260"," gonna be just a second, got some loading coming out, got"
"1130260","1170090"," some loading issues, I still have loading issues, still having technical bullshit, this"
"1170090","1189400"," means the market is currently closed, yeah, I'm on DX feed right now, unsubscribe,"
"1189400","1202920"," unsubscribe, so we just bring one up here, MU, this"
"1202920","1204500"," book map is not liking. "
"1221850","1227030"," Not too much has changed this morning on MU, you've got supply still right where we are at 94,"
"1227890","1242130"," you've got a nice little support down here at, let me take a look at this, you've"
"1242130","1247190"," got support coming in right now in MU, it looks like a big support's coming in an MU at 93 "
"1247190","1257390",".21, same resistance as yesterday, same sellers at 96, 92, 97, your wall is still above at 100, I"
"1257390","1318820"," wouldn't sweat too much on MU this morning, it's"
"1318820","1337960"," always nice to see this right here, just ripping through sellers on Facebook, so"
"1337960","1346620"," Facebook, your walls are at 350, you've got some decent resistance, and then your next wall is at"
"1346620","1356560"," 354.79, so you can for resistance at 349.66, and 354.64, you"
"1356560","1363640"," still have more sellers than buyers, so this looks like just more shorts coming off, off the"
"1363640","1369000"," market, and all the tickers are showing this, all the tickers this morning are showing more sellers"
"1369000","1376740"," than buyers, this looks more like short-squeezing than, or shorts being lifted for end of month on"
"1379140","1389380"," Facebook, or the other ones you guys wanted, Netflix,"
"1390840","1400380"," Facebook please, UPST, we'll do UPST next, hold on here, so"
"1400380","1410160"," I do want to warn any of you out there, you guys aren't gonna believe me, any guys are pumped"
"1410160","1417480"," out there, so I do want to just give you a warning that you can still see that there are"
"1417480","1422760"," more sellers than buyers, these look like shorts that are being lifted off the market this morning,"
"1428410","1437170"," more so than buyers stepping in, and you probably also have some nice long-dated calls coming into"
"1437170","1450750"," the market on these stocks, and that helps as well, it unpins these stocks, so"
"1450750","1460430"," anyone that's in on UPST this morning, you are at a pretty significant wall here at"
"1460430","1470750"," 160, you have lots of supply below at 151, no excuse me, scratch that, you've"
"1470750","1480610"," got supply below at 141.87, you've got lots of supply below as well at 130, 126, 120,"
"1481450","1488930"," I will say to you that if you break through 160 here, you do have more buyers right now on"
"1488930","1496090"," UPST, and with no, you've got nothing, you've got clear skies above, so it would be nothing for a"
"1496090","1503110"," squeeze on UPST today to 180, if the supply kicks it or stays up on UPST, there's a good chance"
"1503110","1509330"," of a squeeze here, you do see though, I want you to see that your wall is at 160, so"
"1509330","1516130"," I would say open up a flow software, even if it's a free one, you can open up, is it"
"1516130","1524150"," options, what is it, there's a website that you can open, that you can see free flow, if you see"
"1524150","1539920"," more flow come into UPST, you could get a squeeze today for sure, y'all do AMD next, I'll"
"1539920","1548610"," do AMD next to have and done that one, and then I'll get back to spy, this all looks like"
"1548610","1553710"," short covering, if I had to guess this is all short covering this morning, so you might not see the"
"1553710","1559610"," spy go up today, you might see it move up to 480 by tomorrow, but what you're seeing is all"
"1559610","1566330"," these retail stocks, the shorts are being lifted on them, symbol, we're gonna do AMD, retail"
"1566330","1574540"," favorite stocks, looks like shorts are being lifted for sure, now do they put their shorts back on"
"1574540","1579480"," again, do they let the stock come up, and then re-short them again, that's a big question heading"
"1579480","1588450"," into the weekend, I like AMD right now, and we'll have to see what it looks like here in a"
"1588450","1598960"," couple seconds, I'm really like an AMD right now, let's"
"1598960","1608230"," see what AMD produces, but it does look like short covering across the market on retail"
"1608230","1614630"," favorites, and you can not, I mean seeing, you know what else you can kind of, you can see this"
"1614630","1624410"," is an IWM, you can see that IWM just screamed higher right off the bell, and spy kind of"
"1624410","1630510"," didn't, right, you had a little bit of back and forth in the spy, but we all know that IWM"
"1630510","1639420"," is the most shorted index out there, you can see that the shorts came off IWM this morning, and you"
"1639420","1645720"," do know that if IWM comes up to that 220, we've talked extensively in the past, if IWM is able"
"1645720","1651460"," to break through that 228 level, you'll see more short covering, it would actually, it would force"
"1651460","1658080"," it even higher, you'd be looking at something like 240, I'll bring up IWM here in a second, you've"
"1658080","1663500"," got clear, this is actually a nice looking chart, you still have more sellers on AMD, this is the"
"1663500","1669700"," same story across tech and speculative stocks this morning, same story across retail favorite"
"1669700","1674440"," stocks this morning, you can see that we've got more sellers, but we're moving higher on AMD,"
"1675980","1684500"," you've got some resistance at 155, 160, and 165, the real ceiling I guess you could call on AMD"
"1684500","1690680"," right now is 165, that's what you're looking for, then we're going to bring up IWM this morning,"
"1691660","1698740"," keep wanting to add, but we're going to go one at a time here, we want to look at IWM"
"1698740","1708700"," because of the short covering, you can't really subscribe it to anything"
"1708700","1724700"," else at this point, because they're not enough buyers, this"
"1724700","1731360"," is interesting to see on IWM right now, so IWM is an interesting one right now, so the question"
"1731360","1738420"," would be at this point and IWM is, do we break through, right, that's going to be the big question"
"1738420","1748180"," because you've got clear skies to 240 something, and we'll expand this a little bit, I want you to"
"1748180","1756420"," see what I'm talking about here, if we broke through above here on 226, you'd see like the mother"
"1756420","1761540"," of all squeezes today, like back here you would have seen a massive squeeze if you're able to break"
"1761540","1767060"," through this 226, so begs the question, where it does beg the question, more shorts lifted today"
"1767060","1771640"," and then put back on at 226, I don't know the answer to that at this point, I'm going to"
"1771640","1775840"," have to look into it, you'd have to get the short report and find out if they were just lifted,"
"1776400","1785450"," and then put back on by major institutions, you'd still have more sellers than buyers on IWM at"
"1785450","1798480"," this time this morning, even with the squeeze higher, and"
"1798480","1806970"," you should see actions like this continue on into Friday and even into Monday, these are the"
"1806970","1812150"," underlying mechanics of the market that are taking place that we've been talking about this stuff,"
"1812710","1819570"," ad nauseam, this week, having, they're going to take place as we get closer and closer to the end"
"1819570","1825130"," of the week, so let me know, I want to know from you guys out there, if you guys could"
"1825130","1830970"," type in the chat box, I want to know if you think that they're going to re-short these stocks,"
"1832290","1846810"," if this squeeze higher, if it's short-lived and we start to go down again, yeah, I'd"
"1846810","1851570"," like to know what you guys think, if you guys think it continues, if you continue to rip higher or"
"1851570","1860510"," melt higher to that 48 pin into Friday, if you think IWM has a chance to move higher, you can"
"1860510","1867630"," see just, you can see live here that IWM's got nothing, if you break higher than this 226, if you"
"1867630","1874270"," break higher than 226.59, which is, you know, you're talking a dollar away, right?"
"1874270","1882280"," If you broke through this, there'd be clear skies above, you'd be, you'd be ripping, ripping,"
"1882700","1892080"," without a doubt, so I've got, I'm questioning that myself this morning, yeah, we'll go back to"
"1892080","1897840"," Tesla right now, and you can also see that the numbers are not matching up, you can see that we've"
"1897840","1905300"," got more sellers than buyers, yet you can see the prices going up, and so you can definitely assert"
"1905300","1908500"," that to short covering."
"1914300","1924280"," So we're loading up Tesla right now, yeah, you'll see short covering,"
"1924520","1941160"," you will see short covering, but you'll also see shorts coming back on again, see"
"1941160","1959200"," if we can get this, get this Tesla feed spun up here, and"
"1959200","1965980"," Tesla's first wall 1085, next wall 1100, and then I thought we had one at 1120, but yeah, there's"
"1965980","1972280"," another one up here at 1120, this one's weaker than it was before, you can see the supply down"
"1972280","1980140"," below is at 1050, and currently at 1081, you can see from these nice peaks in here, you can see"
"1980140","1988110"," the smart money is down below at 1050, be conscience of that, and the hero indicator is not showing"
"1988110","1992610"," as much right now either, I guess we're waiting for it to catch up here, I hope it's going to"
"1992610","1996530"," take a minute for it to catch up for the feed."
"2000940","2006700"," I'm questioning the squeeze, especially in stocks like so far, yeah, so just as a, just as a, this"
"2006700","2013480"," is a firm rule, I want you guys to know this out there, okay, as a firm rule, is there"
"2013480","2022620"," is a difference between Vanna squeezes and short covering, and that Vanna squeezes tend to go"
"2022620","2029540"," higher and last longer, they can last anywhere from one to three days, sometimes they could get"
"2029540","2035580"," bigger I guess, but Vanna squeezes tend to last longer, even though they're in the grand scheme of"
"2035580","2040360"," things, they're short-lived, right, you could Vanna squeeze for a day and then just grind higher"
"2040360","2049620"," for a few more days in a trend mode up, but short covering squeeze is much shorter lived than even"
"2049620","2059320"," a Vanna squeeze, so short covering squeezes tend to last briefly, open memory allocation"
"2059320","2067929"," settings, okay, so this is where I'm going to go to five, now I'm up to five gigs, we'll go"
"2067929","2078880"," up to six gigs, it might decrease performance, okay,"
"2079020","2087060"," I've got plenty of gigs, okay, so what I wanted to talk to you about is that as a general"
"2087060","2091460"," rule of thumb, this doesn't prove true every single time, nothing, there's no absolutes in the"
"2091460","2098380"," market or trading, but generally speaking short covering rallies last much shorter than Vanna"
"2098380","2101680"," rallies, then gamma rallies, right?"
"2108820","2114240"," No, so we shouldn't have a Vanna squeeze, there should be no Vanna squeezes coming up, we are at"
"2114240","2122580"," the top of our, we're at a wall right now call wall, whether, well the market is, like spy is"
"2122580","2129600"," at a call wall at 4800, you can't get an expansion of gamma until people are placing bets much"
"2129600","2136740"," higher or much lower and further out in time, right now everybody's betting, for everybody's bets"
"2136740","2146520"," are ending on the 31st and that's compressing, that's compressing how the moves the market can"
"2146520","2156130"," make, what is the next Vanna squeeze, can I get a hit, hit to get, the"
"2156130","2162890"," UVXY, January 2011, 2005 call spreads for 20 cents now, want for 25 cents, yeah that was my take,"
"2163090","2167490"," before we opened this morning I was telling you guys, I don't want to buy the Vix until it's like,"
"2167750","2170790"," let me take a look at what I was talking, what I was saying, I want the Vix at 12"
"2170790","2171550"," or something, right?"
"2172150","2178290"," I want to see the Vix, I want to see the Vix just a little bit lower, instead of buying"
"2178290","2183990"," it at 17, I want to be buying it like 14, 13, somewhere down there, I don't think we're quite"
"2183990","2192690"," there yet but we almost are, yep so we're below 17 right now but if we could see it at"
"2192690","2202300"," like 14 or 12 I would be very interested in buying the Vix there, very interested,"
"2202820","2208120"," so this is the same Tesla feed, you've got light resistance here, you know Tesla could rip higher"
"2208120","2213540"," today, you can see, oh and this is excellent, I want you guys to see this, so Tesla has flipped"
"2213540","2219820"," at this point, I want you to be very aware that there are four times, or you've got 400,000"
"2219820","2225440"," buyers versus 300,000 sellers on Tesla, tell all your Tesla friends out there and the hero"
"2225440","2232760"," indicator is blasting off right now, it would not be a surprise to see the next squeeze in Tesla"
"2232760","2242340"," this morning, and we're at 10, we're at what right now, 10, 84, your next wall is 1100 and then"
"2242340","2250290"," above that you're looking for, let's see how high we can go in Tesla, see if I can even get"
"2250290","2257350"," it to calculate that high, because Tesla could really start ripping here, I might have to take"
"2257350","2266200"," this, I might have to take a trade here in Tesla, this one is looking pretty juicy, I don't even"
"2266200","2274770"," know if I can get it to scale that far out to higher than 10, 20, that's pretty high right,"
"2274770","2281930"," 10, 20, yeah I've got it I've got the wall at 11, 20, that's where I see the wall at,"
"2282110","2289130"," but it might be higher now, Tesla's going to be an interesting one to watch later this morning, we"
"2289130","2296110"," were talking yesterday about previous years around this time of year that Tesla would like dump 70"
"2296110","2301990"," points and then rip another 100 points but there were a couple moments last year where shorts were"
"2301990","2307610"," lifted and it was at end of day, it was at like 3.45 in the afternoon and if you"
"2307610","2313630"," weren't paying attention you totally missed a ripper for massive money, could have made tons of"
"2313630","2320090"," money so I'm interested to see if that takes place this morning in Tesla, it looks like there are a"
"2320090","2333980"," lot of people anticipating this happening this morning in Tesla, I'm"
"2333980","2343460"," going to give you guys the most bullish calls this morning, spy number one, they've got some"
"2343460","2348940"," expansion of calls in January, you want to be seeing that, Netflix is number two, then Facebook,"
"2349920","2359020"," then Baba, then GPN, I'm interested in this one, 1230 the expiration on this one is February"
"2359020","2367980"," 18th for it's a GPN a 150 call strike for February"
"2367980","2375940"," 18th for 1.1 million dollars that might be a nice one to run on, next up is a firm"
"2375940","2385560"," then Apple, then AMD, then HIMX then FIS, then NVDA"
"2385560","2393340"," then Donkey Kong is in there, I'm shocked, somebody played Donkey Kong for March 3rd, for March"
"2393340","2403700"," 18th 30C for 200 grand someone else played arcade this morning, someone else played IWM, I'm"
"2403700","2409840"," not sure about those calls right now though the short squeeze or the short covering, they can be"
"2409840","2415780"," really short lived, I'm looking to go short on these squeezes and you guys are all looking to go"
"2415780","2423440"," long out there, I'm always like kind of wonky though, I'm usually trading the opposite side of the"
"2423440","2432120"," trade that everybody else is trading, Winter Vana Charmflow is usually strongest two weeks"
"2432120","2441910"," preceding OPEX, how VIX goes to 1214 if you say there is"
"2441910","2448050"," volatility coming up, yeah so get a piece of paper and a penchaz out there, right, and drop piece"
"2448050","2454930"," of paper and a pen, right, drop piece of paper and a pen, or you know what, just bring out"
"2454930","2461250"," on your own chart the VIX, right, bring up just the VIX chart, VIX two minute chart right, and just"
"2461250","2467990"," before, when we had the first live stream this morning before the open, I was talking to you and we"
"2467990","2476070"," were at 17 and I said like to see VIX go down to between 12 and 14 and then you'll"
"2476070","2485430"," see a moment of volatility though traditionally it should take place between the 31st and the 4st"
"2485430","2493710"," or 3rd, I think Monday is a third this year, so you'd see that volatility spike between Friday and"
"2493710","2503870"," Monday, you'd see us rip higher, now today and tomorrow volatility should still go down unless"
"2503870","2510150"," it's front ran, the problem with the market right now is that everybody and their sister knows that"
"2511610","2519430"," we're getting a volatility spike in the next three days, so does the market front run it or not"
"2521720","2528160"," does the JPM caller get put on when we're not paying, everyone's expecting the JPM caller Friday"
"2528160","2534240"," morning 8am on the SPX, right, so do they do it today on Thursday so you have to be aware"
"2534240","2541920"," of it today prior to it happening because of the interconnection of the market today, everybody"
"2541920","2546340"," knows what's going on in this market everyone's trading the same stocks, everybody's trading the"
"2546340","2552000"," same ETFs you know you've got a pin at 4800 in the SPY tomorrow, so you know at some point"
"2552000","2558240"," we're going to 4800, we knew yesterday that at some point we were going to 478, so you know these"
"2558240","2563860"," things are going to happen, but the question is what do we know when the banks are going to do"
"2563860","2570040"," this stuff, and so if everyone's expecting something to take place at 8am on Friday, the question"
"2570040","2574380"," is do they move it forward, do they do it on Thursday at 8am, do they do it at Thursday"
"2574380","2580720"," at 4 o'clock, I remember this past week on Monday there was some hedging done at full, there was"
"2580720","2585900"," some hedging done at 2.45, then there was some hedging done at 4 in the afternoon, between 4 and"
"2585900","2596540"," 4.15, we had some heavy hedging come into play, I think that was Friday or Monday, yeah,"
"2596680","2602820"," there's speculation across the board on when this stuff takes place, and so you know from their"
"2602820","2608860"," perspective they don't want it to impact the market as much as they possibly can, so they will"
"2608860","2614760"," attempt to hide it from us, and if word on the street is it's happening you know if it's happening"
"2614760","2620440"," Friday at 8 that maybe it'll happen today, and so the rumor mill starts across the market, and even"
"2620440","2627540"," this morning SG put a note out saying to expect volatility in the retail favorite stocks, the"
"2627540","2632000"," implication was that they would go lower and of course they went the opposite way and went higher,"
"2632560","2641180"," and the next question is even if these, even if the short covering takes place right at the bell"
"2641180","2646380"," this morning does that mean that those stocks continue to go higher, or do they start to go down"
"2646380","2646760"," now?"
"2651400","2657240"," In my opinion most likely reshorting tomorrow, can you spy in queues also chart on spy?"
"2657240","2664220"," I saw something on Twitter, spot-gamma-says, JPM-collar will make market go up, but then sell off"
"2664220","2671240"," in markets starting next week, yeah, so originally the thought process was that they'd be selling,"
"2671240","2679660"," they'd be selling this collar right, and buying put spreads, but I guess some of the group think is"
"2679660","2684300"," switched to, they're going to be buying 10 to 15 billion or something like that. "
"2684300","2689720"," I think we've talked about this, we've talked about this right earlier in the week, and so it'd"
"2689720","2690380"," make it go up."
"2691200","2698640"," I'm unsure, I think my point, for me personally, there's going to be wild swings in the market the"
"2698640","2699160"," next three days."
"2699480","2706300"," We've experienced that this morning at 9.30 right at the bell, and so what are you grabbing"
"2706300","2707280"," positioning for?"
"2708600","2713580"," Are you getting positioning because you think we're going to break through and head up past 480,"
"2714100","2719460"," and that's the thing is what is your, instead of saying, instead of looking at just the moment"
"2719460","2726240"," right now, is the question, do I take a long expecting us to go from, so we're at 480, let's"
"2726240","2734720"," say we're veritably we're at 480 right now, so the question becomes, do we move from 480 to 500"
"2734720","2739180"," between now and mid-January?"
"2740340","2749060"," Or do we have moments of price spiking, let's say we go up to 480 or 483 only to sell"
"2749060","2754840"," down over a day or two or a week so that we can go back up for the month of"
"2754840","2755060"," January. "
"2755660","2764260"," So keep that perspective, keep this larger perspective, which is, are we taking longs here?"
"2765040","2771400"," Are we taking on longs for just a or are we taking longs for 200 points?"
"2772520","2779920"," If we're only taking them for 20 points right, then it'd be better for us to look for positioning"
"2779920","2786840"," in a spike, a 20 point spike to actually ride down, I guess this is the point."
"2787860","2797050"," So let me ask you guys that, let me ask you guys that out there, are you looking for positioning"
"2797050","2800750"," to short or positioning to long here?"
"2805060","2808400"," You guys can answer me, because I'm interested to know what you guys think."
"2809240","2817220"," I'm a bull and from my perspective, I'm in the mode of hopefully we rip higher to 480, we pin"
"2817220","2820760"," to 480 or even 483 so that I can take a short position. "
"2822000","2829100"," I'm not in the I'm not in the camp of believing that we go to, we go from 478 to"
"2829100","2835600"," 500 between now and January, 1st week of January."
"2836940","2838260"," I don't see that in the cards."
"2844460","2854410"," I'll have to look at the sense, I think, so Chris thinks, yes, it's 5K in January, that's I"
"2854410","2856410"," mean, I'm not anti that either. "
"2856810","2861230"," And I did chart 5, I did chart, I don't have it on this, I've got it on the computer"
"2861230","2865330"," rate, did chart a stupidly high number, it was like 493 or something."
"2865330","2867010"," So, I did chart it."
"2867230","2871690"," I can show, no matter of fact, I will show that chart later in the day or tonight. "
"2871750","2873710"," I'll make a video showing that really high chart."
"2876270","2881490"," I think we go up the next two to three months, long now with a small VIX called January Hedge,"
"2882290","2884830"," long but I'm flexible by rationale for long."
"2885510","2892190"," I think we may see another 5% down in the broad indices and then I melt up, short those"
"2892190","2893410"," 470s look good. "
"2893410","2899350"," Yeah, I'm always interested, especially on days today."
"2899690","2905550"," I'm always interested on days today when I see short covering and I want to see if people are"
"2905550","2915370"," exuberant, right, the more exuberance that we see does it impact, does it impact"
"2915370","2916590"," the call flow?"
"2917330","2924290"," And so the question then becomes if the greater market thinks, and that was the talk on the CNBC"
"2924290","2929230"," this morning, if you paid attention closely to CNBC yesterday and this morning, it was all"
"2929230","2932110"," rationalizing we can go much higher in springtime."
"2932850","2937950"," There was lots of, and I'm sure that that's being pumped, right, you know that people are selling"
"2937950","2946530"," this story of, hey, we need people to buy the 500 calls, we need people to buy the 520 calls"
"2947910","2950890"," with the belief that we break 5,000 in springtime. "
"2955780","2957820"," We need that market expansion."
"2960750","2964150"," So we're going to do, you guys wanted to do the spy next, right, so I'm going to do spy"
"2964150","2966470"," here real quick so you guys can see where everything is."
"2970960","2972320"," Do we go higher to 480?"
"2974080","2975260"," Yeah, I think we go to 480. "
"2975720","2977600"," I don't think 480 is off the table at all."
"2977940","2982540"," I think we're going to make, I think we're going to pin to 480 at some point today tomorrow."
"2983360","2987880"," I think it's the natural thing to do with where we are in our gamma and where we are with"
"2987880","2989680"," the expiring call options. "
"2990500","2993220"," The only fear that I have in this is that you've got some panic."
"2993740","2996720"," People don't think their calls are going to print so they start to sell them."
"2997000","3004100"," You end up having too many calls and you do see CNBC pushing this market narrative that we're going"
"3004100","3013180"," higher in January, text going higher into January, February, March and that might be convincing"
"3013180","3020180"," people to buy farther out calls in this market as we head into the Friday close. "
"3020700","3021860"," I'm all for that."
"3022020","3027180"," For myself, I'm just looking for entry and destroying the market."
"3028260","3035680"," So if that's at 480 tomorrow, the 480 pin, if it's at 483, that's where I'll put the meat of"
"3035680","3036320"," my trade into. "
"3037260","3041580"," But when we get into these levels here and let's say we move up 20 points, we go up to"
"3041580","3048000"," 4800 or we move up to 483 would be nice to be honest."
"3048520","3051100"," It would be nice to melt up to 483 into Friday."
"3059360","3061660"," You guys got to remember, I'm a full on bull. "
"3062020","3063520"," Bears hate me on Twitter."
"3064160","3067160"," I'm known as someone that bears hate."
"3069260","3073340"," I'm not well liked on Twitter by bears because I make fun of a lot of bears out there. "
"3074000","3080460"," But I do trade both sides of the, I think bears hate me often because I take both sides of"
"3080460","3085920"," the trade and I think someone feels like, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't be taking both sides of"
"3085920","3087420"," the trade or something like that."
"3089400","3096600"," But I try not to have that myopic bull view and I try not to have that myopic bear view"
"3096600","3101280"," of the markets but I do like to see certain things for bulls."
"3101680","3106720"," Like for me I want to see bulls take calls into January, February, March. "
"3107180","3116260"," I want to see bulls expand the market from 480 to 520, 500, 520, 530, 540."
"3116780","3118020"," I want to see outside the money calls."
"3118280","3121820"," I'm not going to take those calls but I want to see other people taking those calls. "
"3122340","3128460"," I want to see people see SNAP go up 5% and say it's all over, it's going up 10 "
"3128460","3133000","% or 20% and do we go up 10 or 20% in the future?"
"3133400","3133400"," Sure."
"3133400","3138880"," But we need that bigger call structure for a pullback before we go there."
"3139560","3141960"," The mechanics extend farther into time. "
"3143840","3148640"," But for myself I'm looking and if we go up 6% on SNAP I'd be looking to short it"
"3148640","3149460"," at 6 or 10."
"3150060","3156380"," I don't think that we get to 520 or that's the real, that's the long view."
"3156560","3161600"," If you're long here at resistance you'd have to be long to 520 to make it worthwhile. "
"3162320","3164880"," Like 525, 10, somewhere in there."
"3165300","3166100"," Maybe not that high."
"3166540","3167860"," I can't get that greedy as a bull. "
"3168560","3175400"," But where we are at 478, you want to go another 140, 120 points and where does that put us"
"3175400","3175620"," at?"
"3175940","3179760"," That puts us at where does that put us at?"
"3181120","3183280"," I'm already thinking this in my mind."
"3183500","3184500"," How high can we actually go?"
"3187380","3188620"," That puts us quite high."
"3188960","3190520"," That puts us in the 500s. "
"3190520","3192420"," And I don't see us going to the 500s."
"3201480","3204540"," Yeah, so hero indicator is negative on puts."
"3205840","3207420"," This is the whole thing on spy. "
"3207640","3212160"," So I want you guys to understand that all of these tickers that I'm showing you right now, one by"
"3212160","3215220"," one, they're still showing more sellers than buyers."
"3216540","3219680"," TASL looks pretty good with their buyers and their hero indicator."
"3220560","3225940"," But most of the rest of the speculative tech looks like short covering should be short lived. "
"3226360","3227760"," I would ride it as long as you can."
"3228180","3233960"," But at the same time, if it expands the call volume that I'm happy, because it does help."
"3234280","3235640"," Let's say you see Alsid. "
"3235980","3240580"," If you see Lucid crank today, it's good for the market."
"3240840","3244700"," It's good for the market to see expansion higher, even if it's short lived."
"3245380","3248300"," Because we'll then sell down and you'll get range expansion. "
"3249020","3253200"," Bears and bulls make money when we have range expansion."
"3253700","3258200"," If you don't have that range expansion, you just have to gain winning constantly, right?"
"3258760","3261080"," So we'll look at next."
"3269270","3271570"," Let me see what you guys are requesting to see next. "
"3278440","3284600"," Dragon Wolf saying I logged 5, 180 dash calls out to May and hedge weekly with cheap spy puts."
"3285020","3286340"," Dude, I love Dash right now."
"3286680","3287860"," Dash is on my short list. "
"3292730","3294730"," I've been liking on Dash for like two, three weeks now."
"3296860","3298240"," What are my favorite tickers right now?"
"3302770","3305630"," Okay, so let me explain the hero indicator."
"3306010","3311630"," So right now that you see this vertical where I've got my cursor in the bottom right hand side, if"
"3311630","3318310"," you see this purple line growing and you see this minus sign on the hero indicator, it's showing"
"3318310","3321170"," that there's more puts coming in than calls on the spy. "
"3321750","3328870"," If you see it rotate to the right and the minus sign go away, then that means there's more calls"
"3328870","3331030"," than puts coming in on the spy."
"3331030","3340480"," Now, if the hero indicator were to stay negative all day long on the spy, and"
"3340480","3349180"," the price of spy stays the same, it is implying that spy is going to go lower in the future."
"3349480","3350940"," It could be end of day today. "
"3351160","3351940"," It could be end of day tomorrow."
"3353100","3354120"," It might not happen today."
"3354300","3355200"," It could happen on Monday. "
"3356080","3361860"," And to me, it implies that people are positioning for spy to go down at some point."
"3362260","3362820"," And I am too."
"3362960","3366900"," I mean, if you look at the VIX right now, if you look at where we are, for us to"
"3366900","3371360"," go up in January, if we're going to go up in January, then we do need to come back a"
"3371360","3371680"," little bit. "
"3372620","3375320"," And I guess the next question would be, or do we just grind higher?"
"3375940","3377060"," Because we're not tapering."
"3377640","3380380"," You know, the feds talked this big game about tapering."
"3381000","3388360"," And if they don't taper or speed up the tapering, then you will see a mad, a mad grind higher"
"3388360","3389880"," in through January with no pullback. "
"3395420","3397500"," And you do see more, more sellers still."
"3397880","3405060"," So the tail of the tape is not matching what the equity buyers, the dome is saying something"
"3405060","3405300"," different."
"3405600","3410760"," The dome, the dome is saying the DOM is saying something different than what the ticker is telling"
"3410760","3412000"," you on the spy right now. "
"3422980","3427700"," Okay, a large buyer out to May 22 and Dash have followed that and have been adding when cheap"
"3427700","3428660"," weeklies are purchased."
"3429220","3429600"," Yeah, that's good."
"3429600","3431020"," I like following big tickers. "
"3431160","3436140"," Anybody, any of the tickers that you, if you guys are using Flow Algo, or if you guys are using"
"3436140","3443600"," tasty whatever tasty ticks or something, or if you're using unusual whales, you guys do want to be"
"3443600","3452420"," looking for large call structure that's dated out in March, January, June, with big money."
"3452720","3454500"," And you're going to see that range expansion."
"3455160","3458540"," You'll know that people have faith in those tickers. "
"3458940","3463660"," I don't know that I'd necessarily take that hedge, but I would, let's say if you had a ticker at"
"3463660","3470480"," $50 and you saw a June hedge, a call hedge at $75, you could more than likely take a call"
"3470480","3474280"," spread in the money into June and it'll probably print at some point."
"3478760","3484720"," So we're going to look at next, then what is SMP or is it SNAP?"
"3485020","3486860"," Do you want to look at SNAP or is that S&P?"
"3487980","3489800"," Denny was asking about SMP?"
"3490500","3492020"," Is that SNAP or SMP?"
"3492740","3494240"," And I'll show you some dash too."
"3498410","3499270"," And I'll show you NIO. "
"3499490","3504690"," Let's check on NIO for you guys and see, we'll start with NIO because I think Chaz is all pumped"
"3504690","3505330"," on NIO."
"3507110","3508510"," We'll deal with NIO next."
"3521880","3526440"," And you see the big dip on spy just now, spy slightly collapsed. "
"3529300","3531760"," MUs recovered slightly, which is nice to see."
"3535010","3536490"," Tussle's just kind of hanging around."
"3541660","3544120"," Lucid's still kind of ripping, which is nice to see. "
"3545040","3546860"," You got HUD still ripping."
"3547780","3549100"," I should have bought HUD yesterday."
"3549760","3553680"," I'm kicking myself this morning over not buying HUD yesterday. "
"3553780","3554200"," I knew better."
"3554340","3556820"," We talked about HUD all day long yesterday."
"3557680","3561980"," And one of you guys out there, I think it was Robert or somebody said, I think this is the"
"3561980","3563500"," bottom for HUD. "
"3564000","3567440"," So congrats to any of you out there that bought the bottom yesterday on HUD."
"3567920","3569620"," That's a printer today without a doubt."
"3571960","3572680"," And look at that. "
"3572760","3575420"," You got pins, moon shot on pins this morning."
"3581020","3589320"," Peton with a moon shot this morning, 7%, which is hilarious."
"3591260","3592260"," Utterly hilarious. "
"3592900","3597940"," You got moon shots on all these companies that are just actively being shorted."
"3608740","3614200"," And if any of you guys are long on NIO, you might be out of ceiling on NIO right now."
"3614280","3615480"," You might be in a wall right now. "
"3616820","3618980"," You do have more buyers than sellers."
"3619220","3620040"," It could squeeze higher."
"3620260","3620960"," You've got 251. "
"3622260","3628560"," You got 2.5 million buyers to 1.5 million sellers on NIO."
"3628680","3630340"," That's a nice ticker right now."
"3630520","3631240"," Risky, risky. "
"3631600","3641060"," But if you break through these, if you break through 3161 or so, you will see a squeeze in NIO."
"3641420","3642280"," That's an interesting one."
"3642740","3645440"," Your next wall would be at 40 above. "
"3647120","3648360"," I'm going to pop NIO up."
"3648420","3649040"," I want to look at NIO."
"3653480","3654940"," Yeah, NIO is cranking. "
"3659230","3661510"," It does make you wonder if it's still short covering."
"3679660","3681100"," What else am I going to look up here?"
"3681280","3681500"," Snap."
"3683320","3684920"," You guys want to see Snap next?"
"3687400","3688780"," We can take a look at Snap next. "
"3700370","3707690"," I thought Snap's wall or ceiling, I thought their wall was at 60 as of yesterday."
"3713760","3720720"," So you've got some clear skies on Snap up to 60 and then your big wall is up at $71."
"3721820","3724520"," So Snap could do some movement today as well. "
"3725020","3726560"," I like Snap here as well."
"3727120","3728780"," You've got one."
"3729340","3730360"," You've got 183. "
"3731400","3734960"," You've got almost double the buyers as sellers on Snap this morning."
"3738140","3740380"," So Snap could get pretty juicy as well."
"3742920","3744260"," Snap's got some clear skies. "
"3744760","3746440"," NIO's got clear skies above it."
"3748460","3750680"," Amazon's starting to come down a little bit."
"3754310","3756190"," You guys want to check on Hood real quick?"
"3757910","3760830"," Keep your eye on Snap and NIO at this point. "
"3761770","3762930"," We'll look at Hood next."
"3789700","3795280"," I wouldn't be trusting any, I wouldn't be trusting any like cup and handle stuff today."
"3798160","3804090"," The mechanics of the market how it's working this morning is unnatural. "
"3804510","3805150"," It's not normal."
"3808700","3810560"," Hood's still looking sexy this morning."
"3811060","3813440"," You've got double the buyers on Hood. "
"3814180","3817140"," Your next wall on Hood is not until 26."
"3818060","3822440"," If Joe Donuts out there listening his calls might print this morning."
"3823040","3827980"," If Hood was able to break through to 26, his calls would print. "
"3830210","3831110"," You get a fat print."
"3832190","3833770"," So Hood's looking like it could squeeze."
"3835670","3838730"," It's got 500, it's got 600,000 buyers. "
"3838810","3842090"," Get double the buyers as sellers on it this morning."
"3845910","3848330"," Yeah, I'm watching that big tech roll over right now."
"3849970","3851070"," I'll bring up Amazon. "
"3851370","3853790"," Let's see if we've got more sellers coming in than buyers."
"3854410","3861270"," So all the speculative stuff all the speculative growth stuff like the Hood's and the Snaps and the"
"3861270","3866910"," NIO's and all those are looking good right now still looking good."
"3867750","3872410"," And the Amazon's and the kind of sickly right now. "
"3886750","3887690"," Let's take a look at Amazon."
"3887750","3889850"," Then we'll bring up Facebook afterwards."
"3890750","3892270"," We'll bring up Apple after that. "
"3892350","3905990"," Then we'll look at the queues and just"
"3905990","3908670"," kind of bashed off this wall above here."
"3908750","3910450"," You see this bashing effect up here."
"3911290","3915550"," We bashed right off 34.20 on Amazon. "
"3916350","3919810"," Still have more buyers than sellers though at this point what it's looking like."
"3925800","3928680"," I'm not sure that I'm going to give up on Amazon at this point."
"3946330","3948910"," Yeah, I'm not giving up on Amazon at this point either. "
"3951190","3952810"," This doesn't look too shabby at all."
"3954610","3960410"," So big tech's looking weak right now but it's not it's not weak."
"3961930","3967210"," Let's bring out the I'll bring out the heroin indicator on this one and see what we're seeing on"
"3967210","3978320"," calls so we"
"3978320","3979840"," can get some insight. "
"3983790","3985450"," Yeah, heroin indicator is good on Amazon."
"3985850","3988510"," This might just be a breather on Amazon at this point."
"3996390","4001070"," This might be that nice slow melt up that we get that Christmas rally straight into the 31st. "
"4001890","4003510"," It would be nice to see this too."
"4010700","4012700"," The hero indicator is positive on Amazon."
"4016860","4018760"," This just looks like a pullback at this point. "
"4019500","4024220"," I don't know if any of you guys are wrapped up in an Amazon calls but Amazon looks great."
"4025000","4029940"," I'm going to bring up Facebook next and see if it's looking like it's going to burn or not."
"4043210","4047150"," A rune is saying that Misfit has 3.5 million in calls for January. "
"4047890","4048590"," That's good to see."
"4048790","4049350"," You want to see that?"
"4051340","4052400"," Yeah, look at Cucom."
"4052800","4054420"," I'll bring up Cucom next, okay?"
"4055200","4056480"," We'll look at Facebook real quick. "
"4057180","4058900"," A rune, I'll bring up Misfit for you."
"4062500","4064540"," Yeah, it looks very positive on Amazon."
"4065240","4065660"," Very positive. "
"4066460","4076900"," It was looking like big tech was starting to roll over while a speculative growth was looking and"
"4076900","4077440"," still looking healthy."
"4078420","4088190"," But from what those numbers are showing, from what the"
"4088190","4096630"," numbers were showing on the hero indicator and on the buyers, we had plenty more buyers than Amazon"
"4096630","4097290"," this morning."
"4098810","4101970"," I'll look at Facebook real quick and then I'll do a couple more of you guys. "
"4104830","4107290"," Facebook, you know it's Facebook, right?"
"4107490","4108189"," We've got more sellers."
"4109250","4112830"," Facebook is not looking as good as Amazon this morning."
"4113609","4114910"," Facebook, you have more sellers. "
"4115529","4117010"," It could be a product of the short squeeze."
"4117990","4119750"," Oh, let me, I'm misspeaking here."
"4119910","4120330"," Hold on here. "
"4121830","4127970"," So right now you still have more sellers than buyers yet the hero indicator is saying that we're,"
"4128250","4130430"," we've got more calls on Facebook."
"4132580","4134979"," We'd have to track Facebook all day long and see."
"4135220","4140540"," You do have a wallet, you do have a pretty severe wallet 350 then you've got a weaker wallet 355"
"4140540","4142319"," and another major wallet 360. "
"4148560","4154240"," I'm not as confident in Facebook as I am as I am in Amazon."
"4154520","4158479"," I'm not as confident in Facebook as I am in Amazon and that would be to be expected."
"4159000","4161260"," Amazon is a banks love Amazon. "
"4164359","4170359"," I'm going to do misfit next MSFT that I'll do Qualcomm after that."
"4178420","4179340"," Tech's looking good."
"4180300","4183479"," Didn't we have some tech flow earlier this week on TQQ?"
"4183800","4185540"," A bunch of TQQ flow?"
"4186460","4187800"," I swear that we had a bunch. "
"4204390","4206370"," You got great support right now."
"4206630","4207890"," Just heads up on misfit."
"4208010","4213170"," This might be a great buying opportunity on MSFT at Microsoft this morning. "
"4214470","4217490"," So you just bashed right off of 340."
"4218250","4223710"," You've got huge buy side supply on Microsoft right now."
"4224150","4233830"," Buyers stepping right in at 341 and you had some sellers swoop down from above at 343 but you've"
"4233830","4235870"," got some great support at 340 as well. "
"4236370","4241150"," You've got more buyers than sellers on Microsoft."
"4241790","4243630"," I like Microsoft a lot."
"4244290","4248170"," Microsoft's first real big wall is that 345. "
"4249270","4252590"," We all know out there that Microsoft does not move a lot."
"4252590","4259390"," And for Microsoft to move anywhere from one to four points in a day is a big move for Microsoft."
"4259910","4269650"," So you're seeing buyers stepping in at 340, 341, excuse me, I've got some congestion but"
"4269650","4271730"," you've got some great buyers stepping in. "
"4271950","4273710"," I would take a call on misfit to 345."
"4274950","4276430"," I would like that call actually."
"4278250","4280710"," The hero is slightly negative on misfit. "
"4281050","4283450"," That's the only negative you've got working against you here."
"4285510","4288430"," That would be where the caution is on MSM."
"4288570","4290090"," Hold on a second here. "
"4292640","4293880"," Yes I call misfit."
"4294300","4295500"," That's what I call Microsoft."
"4297080","4301700"," I've got all kinds of crazy names like DKNG is Donkey Kong. "
"4307430","4309990"," Yeah Microsoft is always turtle mode."
"4310670","4312910"," It's just kind of grinds."
"4315160","4318620"," Although I made some of my best money off Microsoft I have to admit. "
"4326010","4330090"," So Rob's calling out that the SPX 4800 magnet is working."
"4331650","4332230"," That's good."
"4332450","4335470"," That's a good sign for the market heading into tomorrow. "
"4342060","4343000"," What was the other one?"
"4343120","4343480"," QCOM."
"4343880","4345660"," YJP wanted QCOM done."
"4345860","4346580"," We'll do that one next. "
"4348140","4351720"," I would be, you know, Microsoft is its own thing, right?"
"4352340","4356940"," You kind of just buy Microsoft calls that are three months out of the money and the banks take it"
"4356940","4357400"," there, right?"
"4358100","4362580"," You make 20% or 50%, 30% and you're happy."
"4366080","4370680"," I have made my, you know, one of the best trades that ever made my career was on Microsoft."
"4371780","4378620"," But it was it was some news that was broken on CNBC that was not supposed to happen. "
"4379220","4387170"," I just happened to have Microsoft open so I wouldn't call it like any trading genius or magic that"
"4387170","4387570"," I had."
"4391700","4394470"," So QCOM, we'll bring up the hero indicator for this one."
"4394590","4402300"," I know some of you guys are, so we can bring up an add-on for hero indicator. "
"4411560","4418000"," There's no support for hero indicator on, there's no support for QCOM for the hero indicator."
"4419560","4420440"," That sucks."
"4421840","4424440"," Okay, so there's no support for the hero indicator. "
"4425120","4428040"," So what do we know about QCOM, right?"
"4429200","4433320"," Let's at least try to do some a look-see on it."
"4435540","4440160"," You've got 26,900 buyers, 36,000 sellers."
"4441800","4445940"," Your first resistance is at let's get more granular. "
"4446320","4454820"," First resistance is at 187.76. That's 187.76. It's minor resistance."
"4456160","4459020"," Your first major resistance, right?"
"4459220","4469330"," R2 is 189.79. You have another minor resistance at 192.83, and"
"4469330","4477270"," then major resistance at 194.61. Now these two minor resistances sometimes you'll see like this red"
"4477270","4478830"," band swooped down to the yellow band."
"4479310","4481170"," You'll see sellers just swoop in. "
"4481690","4484410"," That would be like a ricochet that you'd be looking for."
"4484510","4492110"," If you don't see a ricochet at this 187 then you can expect some hard resistance at 189.74 and"
"4492110","4502080"," then you get above it 194.61. Next level"
"4502080","4504400"," for markets."
"4504720","4505700"," Good to see you, markets and mayhem. "
"4506540","4507700"," Happy morning to you."
"4513120","4514920"," Right on everybody's making money on Microsoft."
"4515340","4515680"," That's good. "
"4518910","4521870"," CAP is a cup and handle forming on the weekly spy chart."
"4522370","4525610"," I would not, I'm going to do diz next for you."
"4525970","4528270"," Markets and mayhem, you got a ticker you want to see this morning. "
"4529050","4534530"," My brother, you want me to see where the supports and resistance are and anything out there?"
"4535170","4536630"," I'll do diz next."
"4543290","4544450"," That's not diz."
"4547890","4557190"," I would be hard pressed to be trusting any classic formations on our charts in the next three days"
"4557190","4563170"," due to the underlying, under the hood mechanics taking place in the market. "
"4564810","4572350"," Let's say you have a bullish wedge or a bearish wedge forming on a stock right now and shorts are"
"4572350","4572650"," lifted."
"4573230","4574810"," Well that goes right out the window, right?"
"4575650","4577410"," Ooh, Disney looks nice right here too."
"4577950","4578890"," I like Disney here. "
"4581780","4583180"," I like Disney a lot here."
"4583480","4587000"," So you've got support at 156-20 right where it's at right now."
"4587700","4590980"," You've got more, way more buyers than sellers on Disney. "
"4591640","4594120"," You might catch a nice bounce right here actually."
"4595040","4597280"," Let's see if we can get the hero indicator up for this one."
"4597680","4598540"," I like Disney here. "
"4601420","4605100"," Let's see if we can, let's see if we can get more, let's see if we can get some more"
"4605100","4605600"," information."
"4606520","4607700"," I like Disney here."
"4608380","4609000"," I like it. "
"4609280","4610380"," Oh, hold on here."
"4614330","4615490"," Let's see if we can get more information."
"4616170","4617710"," So this is a neat one to be looking at guys. "
"4618150","4623590"," If you guys are out there checking this right now, you can see nice steady supply at 156."
"4624210","4628510"," So you've got some more people ready to step in at 155 but that's not too far off for Disney."
"4630370","4632590"," Looks like all the supplies above right now. "
"4632670","4634070"," You can see this beautiful red band."
"4634630","4637270"," See all these beautiful green bubbles here."
"4637330","4646390"," These are nice big buyers here and you've got some resistance at 157-157-15-158 above. "
"4646930","4648430"," So not too much room for movement."
"4648730","4650950"," You've got major resistance at 160."
"4652370","4654290"," It's called 160 above here. "
"4654890","4654990"," 158."
"4655770","4657450"," But you've got more buyers than sellers."
"4658230","4660710"," The hero indicator is not showing too much resistance. "
"4661210","4664590"," But I would be on the lookout for more calls on Disney."
"4665110","4671070"," We talked about Disney earlier this week because one of the stocks that we've been looking at to go"
"4671070","4678810"," higher and I think even two weeks ago we talked at length about their ERs and do they go lower"
"4678810","4680130"," than the 140s or not?"
"4681330","4685190"," Will there be that one week moment in spring or summer where they can get lower?"
"4685710","4689110"," Because we all know, we all know Disney is great."
"4689310","4692970"," Whether you like Disney or not, we know structurally Disney is a great company. "
"4693710","4699270"," And the way that they talked in their last ER, even though it was kind of negative, it's still very"
"4699270","4700950"," positive in the long term."
"4701330","4704130"," Disney's long game is one of the best out there."
"4704810","4706850"," It's as good as Apple without a doubt. "
"4707790","4709810"," So 156 is a great price."
"4710510","4711510"," 158 and 160."
"4712770","4715950"," Looks like your resistance points for Disney for the next few days. "
"4715950","4717650"," We can go higher if you want."
"4718450","4719050"," And there we go."
"4719390","4721130"," So this is where the sneaky peak comes in. "
"4722450","4728510"," When you start to scale out a little bit, you can see that the smart money is down on Disney"
"4728510","4730270"," at 150 and 146."
"4731250","4732750"," Be aware of this down here, okay?"
"4733150","4738390"," So if you've got, let's say you're doing one one to three month calls on Disney right now."
"4738930","4741410"," You know that we have shenanigans on Disney. "
"4741510","4745210"," You know we get shenanigans in the opening and closes of Disney every day."
"4746250","4753450"," And lo and behold, you see the real supply, the real money, the real smart money is down here at"
"4753450","4754250"," 145."
"4755490","4755970"," 150. "
"4756870","4758570"," I would be cautious on Disney here."
"4759530","4762930"," And the hero indicator is starting to show some put action on Disney."
"4763530","4766710"," So I'm not liking Disney as much as I first said a few moments ago. "
"4767590","4771950"," I would be, I would put some, I would put, what I would do is snap a couple lines at"
"4771950","4772790"," 150 and 146."
"4773990","4779530"," And if you see any touches on Disney at 150 or 146, I would be a buyer."
"4779970","4786090"," Now if you're already in Disney calls, I can't say if you should or shouldn't take profit here"
"4786090","4788210"," because you do have more buyers and sellers. "
"4788850","4793930"," Even though we've got a negative hero, I would think that whoever's in these calls are looking for"
"4793930","4797090"," a price target of 160 before they sell."
"4798250","4803750"," But opening a new position at this point, for me conservatively, be looking for 150 or 146."
"4809020","4810060"," Good to see you, markets. "
"4811160","4813380"," Okay, brother, I'm going to put APPS up next."
"4814740","4816280"," Big Twitter guy is here."
"4816820","4821840"," I want you guys to know that, I want all of you guys are listening right now to know that"
"4822380","4825640"," markets in mayhem has a wonderful newsletter. "
"4826620","4830940"," He also does a, what would you call like a podcast?"
"4831640","4834160"," And then he has a really nice discord."
"4835180","4836200"," It's very friendly."
"4836980","4841260"," And people are trying to make money, trying to learn a lot of smart people in his discord. "
"4841800","4844260"," Make sure you check out his profile on Twitter."
"4845180","4852060"," And you'll find at the top of his profile, I think links to signing up for whatever he's doing."
"4852500","4854960"," And I'm a member of what he does. "
"4855440","4857900"," I like all the information he puts out there."
"4858260","4861940"," And he's a very smart trader and has a lot of insight in these markets."
"4873090","4874630"," So we're going to do APPS. "
"4882490","4884490"," Yeah, this is a Nancy Pelosi special."
"4885130","4886430"," You're absolutely right."
"4892160","4893360"," I love you markets in mayhem. "
"4895160","4896260"," You know, it's weird too."
"4896400","4900860"," You've got all these, you have all these like, you have all these people out there that they're"
"4900860","4902140"," always fighting with each other."
"4902440","4906620"," And then in reality, we're all retail out here. "
"4907360","4908960"," The only people were fighting are the banks."
"4908960","4914900"," And so I don't, sometimes I don't understand the grift or the anger that goes, gets on between"
"4914900","4917920"," people doing their own thing, right?"
"4918380","4921580"," So you want to be supporting people that are trying to get information out to you."
"4922440","4924700"," And I would be following those traders. "
"4925280","4931120"," You don't want to be following traders out there that are, that are, you know, saying F that guy or"
"4931120","4936340"," F this guy or whatever, unless they're, you know, maybe they're just selling subs or they're just,"
"4936720","4943240"," you know, but you want to be following people with a positiveness to themselves, right?"
"4943680","4944760"," You want to be there making money."
"4946240","4952300"," Okay, so APS or APPS, excuse me, we've got, let me see if I get the hero on this one."
"4956950","4958530"," See if I can just click on it. "
"4960290","4961190"," Not supported."
"4961810","4962330"," Dang it."
"4964150","4970540"," Okay, so we've got 20% more buyers"
"4970540","4980460"," than sellers We've got, well, you could call this the put wall and APS"
"4980460","4980940"," is 45. "
"4983120","4985420"," 45, 34 is absolute bottom."
"4987320","4995500"," The next band above you call this, this is called a, like a, here this is called, this is basically"
"4995500","4997300"," volatility until you hit the put wall."
"4997640","5000900"," This is between 51, 71 and 47, 68. "
"5001380","5002760"," It's also known as a combo strike."
"5007900","5012020"," The real money right now on APPS is down at $60."
"5012380","5015840"," My assumption would be is this is where they bought at $60. "
"5016400","5024200"," We are eating through some of the sellers above at $65 and the ultimate target is $70 in APPS."
"5031480","5032920"," Let's see what else we got here."
"5035310","5051190"," Next we're going to do MQ and then"
"5051190","5052810"," we'll hit up UPST once more. "
"5052930","5059230"," We did a UPST earlier but we're going to do it once more for Mm this morning for markets in"
"5059230","5059390"," Mayhem."
"5059390","5069190"," I always like doing"
"5069190","5075770"," these smaller tickers because you're always wondering, I used to trade small caps like small caps"
"5075770","5081710"," and penny stocks and often and you'd never know, you'd always be wondering like where are the"
"5081710","5086070"," sellers hiding and so you never really know where the sellers are hiding, right?"
"5086330","5087170"," And so you really want to know."
"5087890","5093330"," So we've got double the buyers, strong ticker this morning MQ is very strong. "
"5094050","5098950"," You've got a nice supply of buyers at $15, $15, $40, $15, $80."
"5101050","5111390"," You've got a supply of sellers at $20 and you've got sellers at $19.56, $19 "
"5111390","5119410",".47 and then you've got some sellers hiding at $24.52. So mark those down on your charts."
"5120070","5123430"," Currently the stock's sitting at $17.64. So you're pretty good. "
"5123930","5125390"," You've got clear sailing here."
"5126650","5130650"," You've got some, and you're eating through any sellers at this $18 mark."
"5131290","5139190"," Maybe you've got some sellers dipping down slightly at $19.38. But as you get, you should be good"
"5139190","5140090"," to go into $20. "
"5140170","5141050"," That's pretty good."
"5141490","5143250"," That's a nice, that's a nice take actually."
"5144010","5146330"," And you've got your cranking on the buyers today. "
"5146710","5148030"," So MQ is moving definitely."
"5154590","5155730"," And then what's the next one?"
"5156010","5156950"," I got one more."
"5160690","5161870"," What was that last one?"
"5161870","5162750"," I know we had one more. "
"5163230","5165370"," UPST. Well, do UPST?"
"5165490","5167010"," And then I see some other tickers out there."
"5167150","5168410"," So we'll make our way through all these. "
"5188450","5190390"," Let's look at a range of 146."
"5198290","5203750"," There is some selling on, I would be concerned this morning on UPST. We talked about this tick"
"5203750","5205690"," earlier that we had some concern, right?"
"5206290","5209850"," I think this morning we said UPST did not look that good this morning. "
"5209850","5210570"," It wasn't looking healthy."
"5211110","5212930"," It does look like it's coming down somewhat."
"5213770","5219210"," You do have overwhelming sellers like we did hit a wall above at that 156 mark. "
"5220050","5221630"," And you had heavy sellers at 160."
"5222630","5228370"," I would be looking for a bounce or a buy zone at 140."
"5229250","5234790"," If you are long in UPST, there is some reason for concern today. "
"5235190","5239090"," So this is the second time we've looked at it and it looks like it's been coming down at this"
"5239090","5239410"," point."
"5240130","5248230"," So you have overwhelming sellers on UPST. The buyers are very weak and it looks like the smart"
"5248230","5249070"," money is at 140. "
"5257060","5259340"," Two golden tickets on GPN."
"5260160","5268380"," Yeah, I hooked up the UPST. MQ's been beaten down pretty aggressively without any negative"
"5268380","5270640"," developments out of the share unlock. "
"5272400","5274760"," Yeah, there's lots of buyers in MQ this morning."
"5275980","5277620"," Yeah, I'll check gold for you guys."
"5279970","5285490"," If these feeds are helping you guys, if any of this is helping any of you become better traders,"

"5322810","5324170"," information out to you. "
"5325870","5328790"," We're going to do which one next."
"5330510","5331930"," Try to see what we're going to do."
"5337790","5340910"," GPST and gold, right?"
"5341110","5345770"," We'll do gold and GPST. I think I do GLD on this one."
"5351570","5357710"," Oh yeah, I always appreciate the support for running just as an example for running book map with"
"5357710","5361970"," the hero indicator and the DX feed."
"5362350","5368870"," I think it's costing me five or six hundred a month to run just this and then a time that"
"5368870","5377150"," I'm putting into the live streams with you and then I'm putting out produced videos and then"
"5377150","5382530"," posting on the handle and then of course I have to increase the internet and I get all these"
"5382530","5388870"," cameras and also the crap that I'm doing and we're trying to make this more like a semi "
"5388870","5395550","-professional so that we can streamline and direct the information to you as time passes over the"
"5395550","5398630"," coming weeks so the support is greatly appreciated. "
"5400630","5405670"," I know that some of you and I've paid so I have paid for myself for subs, right?"
"5405790","5413150"," I've paid up to 300, 500, 600 dollars for subs and didn't get any actionable information from these"
"5413150","5415790"," subs and some of these subs people are mean."
"5416210","5420710"," They're not nice people so if you guys can help support the channel I'd appreciate it."
"5421750","5424910"," So we're looking at gold right now and what does that look like on gold?"
"5425210","5428890"," Looks like JPM and GS have a firm thumb on gold. "

"5466290","5467010"," their way to 180."

"5775920","5798030"," a simple man myself I love playing spy I'll play individual tickers of spy isn't moving I"
"5798030","5803830"," like Amazon I want to play Amazon today so what do you got hold on a second you guys saying"
"5803830","5819090"," that Amazon is dying over here because the hero is not looking pretty let me"
"5819090","5828990"," take a look at Amazon oh yeah Amazon did run Amazon"
"5828990","5836810"," ripped to 34 20 whoo-hoo nice and so let's look at Amazon real quick I want to show you"
"5836810","5842370"," guys something on Amazon real quick and you saw that nice swoop above right and they just wrecked"
"5842370","5849070"," the sellers at that wall at 34 20 that was a nice call that was a really nice call that"
"5849070","5857610"," was outstanding yes and I do want you to see that you do have sellers coming in you do have"
"5857610","5862930"," the hero indicator is not looking good for Amazon you guys want to see where the buy zone is for"
"5862930","5870920"," Amazon at this far Amazon at this point see if we can show this here in a minute let's see"
"5870920","5874920"," if we can get this to catch up see if the buyers are stepping in or where they're going to"
"5874920","5880960"," step in if you guys are looking to buy the dip of get on Amazon we knew the wall was"
"5880960","5890870"," above it 34 20 you are looking at for strong support at 33 30 370 that's still"
"5890870","5904190"," really low we know we already know about 33 70 we need to get it closer you do"
"5904190","5908350"," have a grind see that I want you to see this right here okay this is important to see on"
"5908350","5915070"," here you guys want to see this so you do see when it ricocheted down it's bouncing here right on"
"5915070","5923150"," this red line right here at 3400 this is 3400 33 92 now this is a prime example if you're"
"5923150","5929150"," going to day trade Amazon right now right you are looking for behind this vertical white line right"
"5929150","5935250"," here to your right you're looking for this red line right here to stay right you don't want to see"
"5935250","5941050"," this disappear you don't want to see the shattering through that's happening right now so this"
"5941050","5948030"," might be a play where Amazon's going to bounce right here we do have more buyers and sellers you"
"5948030","5955650"," are looking for consolidation right at this moment at 3400 and to be honest there's nothing but"
"5955650","5965550"," you've got no buyers below 3400 until 33 70 so you want to see right now buyers stepping"
"5965550","5975280"," in so this is a critical juncture here for Amazon right where we are right now and"
"5975280","5984340"," the thing to note is that you would be looking to attack again at 3414 in possibly higher at"
"5984340","5994240"," 3416 would be the next run that's that same sailing right because you've got that ceiling"
"5994960","6000720"," earlier we saw it was at 3420 right so let's look at it from this perspective your your large"
"6000720","6010300"," supply of sellers are stuck above here at 3415 3420 they're coming down a little bit from and you"
"6010300","6016600"," can see the mountain right this mountain right here so you really are looking for supply to be see"
"6016600","6030380"," if we can get a little bit closer here going the wrong way this"
"6030380","6035140"," could be a nice buy zone for Amazon right now I got to look at the VIX and see what"
"6035140","6044770"," the VIX is looking like yeah if you get a VIX dump here there was a hammer candle"
"6044770","6052340"," just or there was a hammer candle this morning on the VIX well that hammer candle was from"
"6052340","6061010"," yesterday yeah if the VIX starts dumping here this is an interesting moment this is an inflection"
"6061010","6066730"," point in the moment right now you guys might want to be using Amazon as the inflection point for"
"6066730","6073270"," the market for where we are right at this moment right now because you figure if Amazon starts to"
"6073270","6083950"," starts to dump they would dump down to they would dump down to 3370 that's"
"6083950","6093950"," the next supply zone I think right let's look and see yeah so be conscious"
"6093950","6103110"," of this right here so you've got your next your next support for Amazon is 3370 right so your hero"
"6103110","6110810"," indicator is slightly negative right now but you do have more buyers than sellers and you're"
"6110810","6120590"," looking for and you can see the supply right here and you can see the seller is trying to break"
"6120590","6126950"," through the support level right here and so the point would be if if Amazon holds you would expect"
"6126950","6133630"," it to make another run again up to the 3420 mark now if Amazon doesn't hold hold and it falls"
"6133630","6141490"," it would be a free fall pretty severe free fall at this moment so leave this one up for just"
"6141490","6145430"," a minute here because we want to pay attention to this what you will see if you guys want to"
"6145430","6151210"," know if the market is going to dump at this point what you're going to be looking for is big"
"6151210","6157670"," red bands coming in over here these bands would move down and you would as you start to see a"
"6157670","6165070"," break you would see this green wall over here start to disappear and it would become very thin and"
"6165070","6171470"," this wouldn't be good for the spy or for the cues so keep your eyes on Amazon at this moment"
"6171470","6181080"," and then we're going to look up Tesla next so I think we promised Tesla and"
"6181080","6188000"," you can see that nice big green wall coming up on Amazon that there might be a great bullish trade"
"6188000","6210250"," on Amazon right now see if"
"6210250","6226570"," we can spin up Tesla right now so this"
"6226570","6233630"," stream is acting better than the other ones we haven't dropped this stream yet which is nice 1142"
"6233630","6247900"," and our stream is synced pretty well yeah"
"6247900","6253790"," by com so it's up here we're going to have a talk so especially the new trader especially if you're"
"6253790","6258530"," a new trader this is something that I don't hear talked about often in the market so first off"
"6258530","6264370"," let's look at Tesla and we know that we know remember yesterday we had we had some weakness"
"6264370","6270810"," yesterday today we know that yes or we switched early in the week from we started out with buyers"
"6270810","6278290"," at 1090 1070 and then it became 1050 we know that that same place is where buyers are down here"
"6278290","6284650"," at 1050 we know that we're moving up right now we've got twice the number of buyers as sellers in"
"6284650","6290430"," Tesla you know that we're moving up to attack this wall this is a good sign right here not seeing"
"6290430","6297670"," big red bands here at 1087 means there's a fair chance we're going to move above here to 1100 so"
"6297670","6302550"," that price target of 1100 is a good one if any of you are a long Tesla right now I"
"6302550","6310120"," would be looking for that let's get a little bit more granular here and you might see us move all"
"6310120","6316360"," the way up to 1100 at this point you've got minor this is just minor resistance at 1088 I would"
"6316360","6320860"," expect us to push up even through this wall no problems you're looking for your first real"
"6320860","6332070"," resistance at 1100 so you got another 12 points Tesla"
"6332070","6340660"," you could take Tesla long long right now you got another you got another 10 or 12 points no"
"6340660","6350560"," resistance on Tesla right now we'll leave this one on right now the"
"6350560","6358500"," hero indicator is slightly negative but you know it's Tesla now you've got you're just destroying"
"6358500","6365360"," sellers up here and one more thing if you encounter resistant I'll give you an exact number to"
"6365360","6375020"," watch out for in Tesla and that would be 1099.07 if we see the sellers swoop"
"6375020","6382240"," down I'll let you guys know if you're just listening via audio if we see any any kind of change"
"6382820","6392040"," I'll let you know and we're going to talk about something real quick so I was having a conversation"
"6392040","6400630"," with Joe Donut the other day and what we talked about was you know the past and I would say"
"6400630","6410570"," you see infrequently right now you see mergers and acquisitions it's not that common of"
"6410570","6416570"," a site and when you do see it right now especially the past three or four years it's usually a"
"6416570","6422510"," positive thing right you'll see you'll see mergers and acquisitions where it's considered a"
"6422510","6430510"," positive light and Joe Donut brought up a point that you see a lot of these speculative growth"
"6430510","6441120"," companies that are coming down in price companies like hood SQ and"
"6441120","6447700"," you will hear people talk in the market that we might have one more positive year left I'll say you"
"6447700","6452600"," know the way that cyclically how markets go we're coming to the tail end of a bullish market we do"
"6452600","6462420"," know that but you'll see companies that have a good a good product or a good service or in the"
"6462420","6468000"," right direction and their stock prices will get beaten down so low that they become absorbed and"
"6468000","6478280"," you might see you might see waves of that in the coming year to two years and"
"6478280","6484680"," so to consider that when you're thinking about maybe taking a company like Robin Hood Long at $16"
"6484680","6493820"," are we taking it long for a rebound play or is it being shorted into the ground because of an"
"6493820","6501540"," acquisition that we don't know about or because of a removal of a CEO so there could be that I"
"6501540","6512060"," guess the motions of that stuff happening into a not so bullish 2022 or not so bullish 2023"
"6512060","6519380"," so even if we had a bullish 2022 you might see the mechanics of lots of mergers and acquisitions"
"6519380","6528990"," heading into a not so bullish future we're now up to 1088 we are we are absorbing"
"6528990","6537030"," all the sellers you're now at twice the number of buyers on Tesla right now you've got a very"
"6537030","6546890"," strong equity flow into Tesla we're at 1088 and we're working on 1100 yeah Joe"
"6546890","6556830"," Gona snaps up today I saw snap ripping nice and high yeah I don't know"
"6556830","6562550"," if they get destroyed I think the point is that I think the point is that they don't go bankrupt"
"6563190","6567990"," it's that it's known that they're going to get absorbed so what happens is they get shorted down to"
"6567990","6572870"," the ground and then another company comes in buys them out and then the stock price goes to the"
"6572870","6578890"," moon it's not so much you do have some companies that go bankrupt if you look back and like pets "
"6578890","6585850",".com went bankrupt but during that time period some companies were absorbed into larger companies so"
"6585850","6590730"," he was trying to identify some of those earlier this week and that did make sense you know not all"
"6590730","6595430"," of these companies are bad some of these companies are just not cash rich or they don't have the"
"6595430","6601750"," infrastructure or you just have a company that is like a big fat old guy right you've got like a"
"6601750","6608170"," Visa out there Visa or MasterCard and they really want to do all they can to try to knock out"
"6608170","6614170"," one of these new players in the money scene right you don't want you know that Visa and MasterCard"
"6615490","6620690"," discover American Express they don't want to be dealing with an SQ right so what do you do you do"
"6620690","6629300"," you short it into the ground and then do a corporate takeover right good morning good morning"
"6629300","6637230"," everybody yeah you like that you like that Goldman Sachs job application that was a that was a"
"6637230","6644390"," knock on the intern well not just the interns but like the interns at Goldman Sachs and new hires"
"6644390","6649450"," at Goldman Sachs you know they're expected to work their asses off they work 24 hours a day seven"
"6649450","6655290"," days a week and someone was bitching about it and made the news last year and of course no one's"
"6655290","6663530"," really bitching about it no no no young Goldman Sachs trader is gonna you know whisper or complain"
"6663530","6669110"," at all you know it's all about money that's what it's all about so I was just making that comment"

"6767850","6773170"," are more critical than all the planning that you do you know that those pivot moments are the"
"6773170","6779010"," moments where you really need to be trading with other people and not alone you guys know that when"
"6779010","6783430"," you're when you're doing all your research and then you're alone trading you're getting your own"
"6783430","6787690"," head and you're like I'm committed to this viewpoint that I have when in reality we have to be a"
"6787690","6794930"," little pivot and start to make money so I've got a little bit of weakness here at 1086 so it"
"6794930","6801110"," looks like we've got some sellers coming in at this 1090 it's because they're going to get touchy"
"6801110","6808470"," but the hero indicator we should bounce off VWAP here VWAP right now just so you know is at 1082"
"6808470","6815570"," so we should be looking for a bounce right away we should see a big bubble at 1082 and we"

"8992620","8998560"," you saw the IWM come up there though today but you saw the you saw the stealth correction that took"

"9047700","9052540"," you want to see the VIX come back up for a moment even if it's in an overnight so what"
"9052540","9058580"," can happen is you'll see like you'll see like the VIX down low at like 12-14 and then let's"
"9058580","9063520"," say let's say you see that on a Friday and then you'll open with the VIX on a Monday at"
"9063520","9072560"," like 20 or 17 or something or 25 right you'll see just that overnight excuse me I need a lossage"
"9072560","9083250"," I keep Tom talking too much this"

"9106990","9114230"," we want 1100 all right so I'm going to take a break here I need to get a loss and"
"9114230","9121140"," just some tea or something when the 4800 gamma rolls off there's a lot of it yes and people are"
"9121140","9129010"," free to move based on other forces yeah so when the when the JPM call it's okay so"
"9129010","9138450"," Rob's making a good point so we have to we should expand upon that so when the 4800"
"9138450","9147770"," gamma rolls off right the volatility expansion could be positive or negative we don't know what it"
"9147770","9158280"," is yet it's a being implied the rumor is being implied that it's positive for the market based"
"9158280","9171330"," on other forces appreciate you"
"9171330","9176310"," as well markets mayhem you guys you guys need to understand like let's look at anyone that's"
"9176310","9179770"," listening right now that actually knows what they're doing in the market I want you guys to hear me"
"9179770","9187830"," out real quick and you have to look at it from are we go let's have the long view as"
"9187830","9194690"," a bull let's just just take the bull view we have ERs coming out end of January we have a"
"9194690","9202030"," ramp of course that people are expecting or anticipating right to ERs into late January early"
"9202030","9210900"," February and some in some time into March right seasonally we get to sell off in March just the"
"9210900","9216660"," anticipation of that you know that people are going to or we were looking for people to buy this"
"9216660","9224840"," market we've been waiting though for indications from the big banks that we can take this long into"
"9224840","9229920"," that time period right and so you're seeing some of the shorts some of the short covering today"
"9229920","9236500"," that implies it's one of the implications that we're going to go higher into January and February"
"9237400","9243360"," if they're not putting the shorts back on in the next few days that implies that as well right and"
"9243360","9249460"," when you see the new collars come out into the market or the new hedging strategies of these banks"
"9250560","9257260"," you're we're looking for smaller hedge funds are looking for retails looking for where is that"
"9257260","9262540"," where does that take place does it take place where they're selling calls at 500 are they selling"
"9262540","9268900"," calls at 520 550 where is where are those calls being sold are they buying calls are they selling"
"9268900","9275680"," them are they buying put put spreads that are down at 550 are they at 525 or they at 500"
"9275680","9281900"," we saw some hedging activity earlier this week on Monday that was as low as I think they were at"
"9281900","9289860"," 525 that's not positive that could even expand our range right maybe we do go to 425 and we do"
"9289860","9298220"," up to 550 we just get real volatile as time moves forward so we want to look at those things"
"9298220","9305160"," to try to map out what's going to take place in the future now the other concern though is as"
"9306600","9311480"," we head in let's say let's say we say oh okay so we think we're going to go up right"
"9311480","9317380"," but we're in a bullish stance we're still at the top of a trend that we've just made right we"
"9317380","9325680"," just went up from 548 all the way up to 478 and we're going to pin to 480 on Friday"
"9325680","9335480"," so are we going to go from 480 to 520 into February"
"9335480","9345910"," or January or February is that what we're doing and if not does the market pull back slightly so"
"9345910","9354550"," that we do make that big run up to 500 into January or 480 like 485 let's say we go"
"9354550","9362110"," to 500 in in the run to ERs you'd still want some sort of a pullback and then you've just"
"9362110","9366970"," got those trades coming on that's going to create volatility you'll have those brief moments of us"
"9366970","9371710"," dropping so I always think about it from the side of greed right if you're going to take it long"
"9372430","9378770"," there should be a moment for them to buy long again they did it this morning with and yesterday"
"9378770","9383030"," hood was a good example they had a moment to buy hood at a very cheap price at 16 bucks"
"9383030","9391030"," but that spies not cheap so do they dump it real quick to 470 or 460 to make that next"
"9391030","9400420"," run all questions right they know there's a ton of stuff to talk about we could probably talk we"
"9400420","9404760"," should have a little conversation you know it'd be cool to see if markets mayhem could put together"
"9404760","9410260"," a conversation with like 3 or 4 people to see what their thoughts are on this and even spot gamma"
"9410260","9415240"," this morning thought that their volatility would go to the negative side I think I think that's"
"9415240","9421200"," what they thought I'm not sure but I think that they thought that the speculative stocks could have"
"9421200","9427100"," that that capitulation moment like hood had yesterday which they didn't instead that they just"
"9427100","9437280"," lifted the shorts and they went straight up yeah"
"9437280","9443980"," so I trade off I trade off us off spot gamma and I've been very successful I know that some"
"9443980","9450240"," traders don't aren't successful off spot gamma I've done very well off off following them they are"
"9450240","9468320"," they're a part of my puzzle so I can't I'm not never going to talk negative about spot gamma yeah"
"9468320","9475420"," the JPM buy I heard even higher 10 to 15 billion is what I heard markets mayhem 10 to 15"
"9475420","9482580"," billion on the spy tomorrow so 8 billion even 8 billion is beautiful if they were to go higher to"
"9482580","9501380"," 10 to 15 billion yeah"
"9501380","9505660"," yeah no I let so you guys one last thing I wanted before I go I'm going to leave this"
"9505660","9510020"," I'm going to leave this out this stream up and so I get back but I want to talk about"
"9510020","9518800"," one last thing so remember they got to sell a story they started selling a story yesterday they're"
"9518800","9525900"," selling a story today that we're going up to five twenty or five hundred right five fifty let's say"
"9525900","9534780"," that things might be okay this year I agree with that story but it also is used to nudge smaller"
"9534780","9544000"," banks smaller hedge funds to take on risk on the upside into January February March we need we"
"9544000","9552340"," haven't seen long dated or long dated calls in this market yet until today until today we didn't"
"9552340","9561860"," see anyone taking risk on farther than the 31st so you really need to see you need to convince"
"9561860","9569300"," people because my point hey look we're going up to five twenty take some risk on right so even"
"9569300","9579870"," though we're going to go there does that mean we go there today yeah I"
"9579870","9586630"," think JP Morgan did say short squeeze into end of year if I think I already call that JPM said"
"9586630","9596470"," short squeeze in end of the year yeah because they're selling like"
"9596470","9605240"," 5,000 ES calls too so it's not it's not to say that we're not going there it's to say"
"9605240","9611720"," that they have to sell all these calls they need people to be buying calls and believing that we're"
"9611720","9616520"," going there and that doesn't mean we're not going there it just means that you have to get the"
"9616520","9626530"," entire market to buy into what you're selling you"
"9626530","9633990"," know and that that information or that that news is free flow if it's being given away like candy"
"9633990","9638550"," right today today and yesterday earlier this morning at 4am they've had like round table circles"
"9638550","9645390"," circles with with all these talking heads saying you know what we might be going up you know what"
"9645390","9649970"," we can invest in China and it's not that we don't it's that even if we are going there usually"
"9649970","9654910"," there's a small pullback before we get there do you ever notice that you ever notice like when you"
"9654910","9662790"," ever notice that like even an ER run up right you'll see that that pre run up and then you"
"9662790","9666910"," everyone's on board everybody's on the boat right the boat's full of bunch of call holders"
"9666910","9672770"," everybody's happy you're already up like 30% in your calls you're premium starting to kick in"
"9672770","9680170"," everybody's getting happy and then they dump it and then it forces you to buy back in to make sure"
"9680170","9684550"," that your calls are going to print into that ER for that next run up there's usually like a two"
"9684550","9691250"," pumps until we get there kind of a deal same thing always seems to happen on any kind of a"
"9691250","9697010"," price target we get a price we're let's say we're sitting at 100 bucks on a stock and news comes"
"9697010","9704670"," out that they expected to go to 150 everybody jumps on board to like 110 120 and then it dumps"
"9704670","9711190"," back down to 80 or 90 and then it makes its run to the 150 or whatever I think that's"

"11328150","11332990"," a nice little dip buy down here I think I just talked about like 15 have 1085 is the buy"

"11366710","11374530"," you have you have different support levels right so you got support level at 1085 1080 1070 and you"

"11381670","11389430"," VWAP right now but it's is so middle of the day you almost always see a slowdown in middle of"
"11389430","11395190"," the day anytime from like 1 o'clock to 2 o'clock well sometimes as early as 1130 depending on"

"11428100","11437140"," PayPal just did if the right conditions are present today and you see something where you see"
"11437140","11443300"," something where shorts are lifted so the my assumption is testables are taken at some point they're"
"11443300","11449920"," going to lift the the shorts on Tesla and the moment they do that you better be ready because if"
"11449920","11460330"," it happens between now and Friday you'll see a ripper you'll see probably 70 to 100 points in a"

"11472370","11481510"," I'm not too concerned with Tesla at the moment this is probably one of the tickers that tends to"
"11484680","11491700"," happen for Tesla to for shorts to lift along with other stocks and it tends to be when you're least"
"11491700","11497720"," expected it could almost even be set it could almost be said that you wouldn't it wouldn't even"
"11497720","11504240"," shock me to see Tesla dump 25 30 points and then swing up 70 to 100 points you were talking"

"11758920","11766860"," really seeing that right now there is a supply of buyers at 3550 on pins and this looks more"
"11766860","11774280"," volatile than say NIO is looking NIO had the look of forming support Tesla too to an extent is"
"11774280","11782240"," forming some support or it was earlier but right here in pins right now pins looks more like be"
"11782240","11789820"," grateful for what you've got take your money and run or take your money and run and then reenter at"
"11789820","11799220"," 3550 that's what it looks like right I mean I could be wrong on this but"

"12765170","12771270"," for me I'll get out right but you got to put some risk on you can't blame me if you"
"12771270","12778670"," if you lose money I can't blame you if I lose money right but at the same time if you"
"12778670","12784510"," see a stock move and if it's looking good on book map you got to throw some risk on and"
"12784510","12789870"," try to try to try to go with it right you can't wait until it's gone up 15% to"
"12789870","12795570"," take that risk and if you see it spike right off the bow and it pulls back a little bit"
"12795570","12801090"," grab it for the rest of the ride up I mean sometimes those spikes die right at the open but"
"12801090","12807210"," you got to learn to take the risk on you won't make money without putting the risk on and you"
"12807210","12812890"," just have some stop losses so if you start to lose money so if Tesla's like I'm thinking to myself"
"12812890","12819910"," about Tesla right now and I'm seeing the volume pop our premium leave and volume I'm looking at the"
"12819910","12825070"," hour it's 1.32 in the afternoon checking the VIX and I'm looking for certain things to happen right"
"12826150","12831610"," I see that there's good supply down here I know that there's some people here waiting for Tesla to"
"12831610","12838470"," do something VIX is rising so do I pull out possibly but you know you got to take that jump"
"12838470","12842850"," you can't sit there and watch something move and then enter at the top either because then you get"
"12842850","12853830"," burned that way so if I"
"12853830","12859950"," have 3 bad trades pull out and I just need that one ripper I'm good to go right you're good"

"12936410","12945920"," your buy the dip on AMC is $27 you've got lots of buyers coming in and AMC you can see"
"12945920","12952440"," there's buyers definitely on AMC you've got double the buyers and sellers on AMC you guys are"
"12952440","12958360"," probably going to make a move right here huh you've got light resistance at $31 you've got clear"
"12958360","12969840"," blue skies to $40 and you've got lots of people stepping up I'm going to call them people stepping"
"12969840","12978320"," up to make or force a squeeze on AMC to 40 bucks but you certainly most definitely have some"
"12978320","12985480"," support at $27 it's a nice support you can see it right here it's beautiful band right here these"
"12985480","12991220"," are active buyers right now and there's a lot of them and you've got a wall of support below AMC"
"12991220","13001600"," here so yeah AMC isn't good I like AMC right now I like it a lot the"
"13001600","13008560"," initial AMC right up 20 to 30 cap you read that I'm sticking to right now I'm watching I'm pretty"
"13008560","13015820"," deep in Tesla right now I've got a lot of money on Tesla right now so I'm going to stick"
"13015820","13021480"," with Tesla here because Tesla is falling off a little bit I'm gonna have to cut myself on Tesla and"
"13021480","13032790"," try to buy back at like 1080 or something but I do like AMC let"
"13032790","13037470"," me bring it up and bring up the chart on AMC you guys are right at the top on AMC"
"13037470","13046130"," you guys are sickos you guys are crazy on AMC not just AMC I played GME when it was five"
"13046130","13054010"," bucks that was talking about some diamond hands that was insane I made a lot of money on that"
"13054010","13061670"," though you've got clear skies on AMC there's no reason right now why you can't keep going higher"
"13061670","13070450"," today to 40 bucks 40 is not out of the question on AMC and nor should it should be not"
"13070450","13080020"," that it shouldn't be either AMC you guys I'm you know like that this is the thing let's say they're"
"13080020","13087060"," in shorts right now you've still got monster buyers here your hero indicator is not great but it's"
"13087060","13097370"," not bad you still have great by the dip of 26, 96, 27 bucks and"
"13097370","13107430"," that's peanuts when it comes to AMC the real money on AMC is at 25, 34 but"
"13107430","13114570"," look if you break through this you pretty much get clear skies it's a 39 bucks that would be"
"13114570","13120670"," ridiculous if you saw AMC go to oh you got some you've got some sellers sneaking around up here at"
"13120670","13129060"," 31 dollars you got some sellers stepping in up here this is the hedges they don't want you to go"
"13129060","13136060"," to 40 bucks and you can see you're starting to slip under over here you see this right here this"
"13136060","13145280"," is a supply zone you see this here at 512 you have 213 and 564 you are losing here on"
"13145280","13152380"," the heroine indicator and you are kind of pushing down so you might want to be waiting to grab that"
"13152380","13164610"," dip look for 27 if you're going to enter AMC wait on 27 but"
"13164610","13171970"," the AMC is in squeeze mode still even though it's up a ton today if you had the market got"
"13171970","13178550"," slow enough and people started stepping in it wouldn't shock me to see 40 today believe it or not"
"13178550","13188220"," but you'd have to see my assumption would be that the AMC and"
"13188220","13194600"," GME crowd is doing the same thing as the Tesla crowd you have so many stocks today that are ripping"
"13195380","13202080"," and you're looking for certain ones to rip way higher you know you're looking for AMC to go to 40"
"13202080","13210580"," I know you guys are I know you guys want to see AMC at like yeah 40 is nothing but"
"13210580","13215120"," 40 is probably where you guys want to see that right I would assume if you're if you love AMC"
"13215120","13221820"," you want to see it hit 40 and I know the Tesla crowd is the same way like Tesla crowd"
"13221820","13229880"," is not happy right now Tesla crowd feels as though Tesla crowd feels as though they should be"
"13229880","13239500"," hitting 1250 or 1300 before December 31st that's what they want"
"13239500","13249340"," they want their pound of flesh into the 31st and you know Tesla gang"
"13249340","13256200"," 2 last year they sold off real bad and Tesla gang doesn't want to see a repeat of that they"
"13256200","13263620"," don't want to see as much of a correction or a corrective movement we already had a corrective"
"13263620","13268980"," movement to 900 but sometimes corrective movements they'll go down once and they'll do it a second"
"13268980","13275540"," time and so of course the Tesla gang is thinking are we going to now correct down to 750 or"
"13275540","13283770"," 800 or something like that they want to close strong close the air out strong and they usually do"
"13283770","13289430"," most years Tesla gang does so it'll be interesting to see what takes place with all these tickers"
"13289430","13296550"," that haven't like well so I shouldn't say that Amazon has has squeezed today but Amazon hasn't"
"13296550","13308090"," squeezed like the expectations are of the AMC traders they've all"
"13308090","13316970"," highbrowed talking about AMC instead of the MoAS and all the other nonsense what I don't like about"
"13316970","13325890"," AMC is I can't stand the fucking CEO he's such a scumbag he loans this stock out as an asshole"
"13329070","13335480"," yeah AMC or IWM just as a heads up guys IWM is starting to curl over a little bit if"
"13335480","13343960"," you're in anything just so you know that AMC is a part of IWM large part of IWM be careful"
"13343960","13353620"," right here because I IWM is looking a little little cliffy so we're gonna look at IWM real quick"
"13353620","13368560"," that rip"
"13368560","13377200"," into close I'm wondering if I should add to my Tesla calls or if I should close and wait for"
"13377200","13388730"," better price even when I bought these things I figured we were gonna go down a little bit more what"
"13388730","13398130"," are we looking at here you know not not IWM IWM what am I doing here"
"13405770","13417440"," so I'm trying to do three things at once still"
"13417440","13423760"," watching some strong Baba calls coming through the door still watching people piling into spy calls"
"13423760","13431140"," expiring in the 31st some spy puts people buying probably some hedging for the volatility of the"
"13431140","13437720"," weekend it's weird too like I'm seeing some Nike calls expiring in the 31st it's weird to see"
"13437720","13447480"," people buying so many calls expiring 31st right now this is a nice one here RCL March 18th"
"13447480","13456960"," 100 calls I like those calls let me bring up RCL"
"13456960","13466770"," yeah I like that play I like all the I like all the cruise lines"
"13466770","13476760"," into the into the new year and I like"
"13476760","13489600"," that I like that Royal Caribbean crew cruise line is coiling right now I like"
"13489600","13497270"," that play okay so I've got some good news for you out there okay so if you're watching still right"
"13497270","13504310"," now if you're staying with me on stream right now one thing that I have not seen on IWM is"
"13504310","13514270"," a nice building support and you're seeing that right now form on IWM down"
"13514270","13520050"," here at 224 a lot of you guys have been following me and you know that it was it was"
"13520050","13527230"," at 205 at one point then 212 and so it looks like some hedging is coming in on the call"
"13527230","13536150"," side and some support is building on IWM this is positive for IWM because it was ugly"
"13536150","13546110"," yeah this is real nice I like seeing this here yeah that's a nice I mean 215 to 13 this"
"13546110","13551470"," is where it really started to we really started building the nice base here but you know what I"
"13551470","13561390"," wonder if IWM rips in the clothes you know it makes me wonder too like Rob was talking"
"13561390","13567410"," about and mayhem knows about the you know 10 billion coming into the market it wouldn't shock me to"
"13567410","13577330"," see IWM be the play for the clothes of Friday that would be an interesting play"
"13577330","13587270"," instead of playing the spy you play IWM into the clothes of Friday I got to"
"13587270","13597630"," look at the structure on that what"
"13597630","13607470"," am I looking for is there like anything that we're not seeing on"
"13607470","13617470"," IWM right now hmm and like 228 calls on IWM are like $0 "
"13617470","13627290",".16 $0.15 nobody would be watching that right now where's the"
"13627290","13639120"," wall up there supposedly it's at $2.28 right now it's saying it's at $2.26 my"
"13639120","13647810"," dog is barking at something so a $2.26 there's claiming is the wall so the by the dip is"
"13647810","13657810"," $2.24 and the solid rip is $2.26 supposedly on IWM so by"
"13657810","13665710"," the dip just so you know by the dip right now is at $2.44 there's some liquidity coming in"
"13665710","13675530"," here at $2.24.66 and there are some buyers stepping in here but in reality so this is"
"13675530","13679710"," what's considered the smart money down here this is where this is where you want to be buying the"
"13679710","13687070"," dip if you're patient enough out there the price I want to explain so I should explain this more"
"13687070","13696250"," frequently so Mark write this down in your in your notes if you are trading using book map"
"13696250","13703790"," or if you're watching for entries in book map when let's say you have this chart up right here and"
"13703790","13709870"," you kind of look in hey we're on a daily trade right a day trade you might not catch every"
"13709870","13716570"," one of these but if there was a place where if where price will tend to gravitate to to move"
"13716570","13723850"," up it'll be where you see this what's going to be considered smart money so we're not at $2.24 "
"13723850","13731110",".39 right now but there is a high probability that we will get there at some point today so if"
"13731110","13736370"," we do dip down to $2.24 let's say we miss it but if you follow a rule like this"
"13736370","13742050"," every day of the week trading an IWM or a spy whatever ticker you're doing you'll catch more of"
"13742050","13749690"," these then you'll make more money than lose if you wait for the price to tag the smart money below"
"13749690","13753930"," so keep that in mind when you trade using book map."
"13756810","13769140"," I'm going to check next hold on guys I"
"13769140","13775420"," haven't closed my position yet I'm still considering if I'm going to cut losses I've lost you guys"
"13775420","13780680"," want to know which I've lost so far yeah so there's a lot of RCL calls coming in 3 18"
"13780680","13790180"," March 22nd 100c interest is building there but I always recommend is that you take a you take a"
"13792440","13804150"," closer to in the money call don't take the 100s from March you always take like you know"
"13804150","13815020"," I'm not waiting to see on Tesla here might just hold okay so let's look at RCL real quick so"
"13815020","13823320"," here's a prime example if you see flow coming in on your favorite flow software and your so right"
"13823320","13830320"," now is a prime example it's good to see long dated calls coming in on Royal Caribbean cruise lines"
"13830320","13839680"," right when you see that those calls coming in at a much higher number we have 100 that means that"
"13839680","13847620"," someone not you they're not telling you that they that are usually a hedge funder or or a bank now"
"13847620","13855680"," are taking shorts off RCL have some thought that RCL is going to go much higher you're talking at"
"13855680","13863440"," this 78 so that means they're going to go up 20% between now and March that's a significant rise"
"13863440","13874110"," for RCL now will RCL hit a hundred bucks on"
"13874110","13881310"," in the end of March and the answer is more than likely not or it won't hit a hundred bucks"
"13881310","13890690"," until the expiration date of those calls that are put out there so you've got calls you've got"
"13890690","13899010"," calls for March 18th right for 100 so then you should think to yourself okay well then I will take"
"13899010","13908170"," call it April or May calls at a hundred bucks right or you take"
"13908170","13914390"," two week let's say you take a calls that are two weeks later right and that doesn't mean you hold"
"13914390","13919430"," those calls into May it means that you hold them until until we get to that pin of 100 and"
"13919430","13926510"," then sell them the other thing you can do is take calls that are less than a hundred bucks right"
"13926510","13932510"," you take them for like 80 bucks or 90 bucks because they'll tend to gravitate there but not touch"
"13932510","13939890"," the hundred bucks 85, 90 bucks you could take those calls into late March maybe the 31st or after a"
"13939890","13945190"," couple weeks left on them and they'll probably tag up there a couple weeks before the 18th probably"
"13945190","13951030"," like March 1st or something you'll probably get in the money on 85 or 80 calls and then the other"
"13951030","13956790"," thing you could do if you want to be real conservative you just start a ledger or a diary"
"13957770","13962770"," especially around these OPEC states and you just write yeah a bunch of calls came in for RCL and"
"13962770","13970190"," March 18th for 100 bucks then you go into your charting software and you're going to wait for a"
"13970190","13977190"," moment in the market when we're weak right so you already know that that it wants to go there and"
"13977190","13982770"," you're going to wait for a day that we sell off and if you can grab some of those hundred"
"13982770","13990650"," hundred March 1800 calls on the dirt cheap someone else has already paid let's say five bucks for"
"13990650","13996090"," them and now you're just paying a two dollars form or whatever you have better chance of those"
"13996090","14005070"," printing than the guy that bought them for five bucks does that make sense so use the flow that you"
"14005070","14014870"," see in the programs that you're paying for to you want to ride their money but at the same"
"14014870","14019410"," time now that you know that their play you can get sometimes get better positioning."
"14021700","14028400"," If you follow those rules and you're able to enter some of that stuff you'll see a high win rate"
"14028400","14029300"," on those calls. "
"14038370","14048350"," That was a good one I liked looking at I liked looking at IWM Palantir,"
"14048350","14057850"," Palantir, Palantir, Palantir okay so we'll do Palantir next and now you're going to take another"
"14057850","14067850"," look at the candlestick charts on candlestick charts on Tesla I"
"14067850","14068850"," like that RCL call."
"14069910","14070350"," I like that a lot."
"14070850","14077330"," RCL is on the move right now just so you all know if you are listening out there the RCL"
"14077330","14087270"," flow that's coming in is March 18th 100c and they bought a bunch of them"
"14087270","14098180"," for $1.32 $1.37 and"
"14098180","14103120"," a benefit pulled I've got some software that shows hedge walls I'm going to bet that there's a"
"14103120","14113060"," hedge wall on RCL somewhere if I had to guess that it's right at the hedge wall right now if"
"14113060","14118640"," I had to guess matter of fact it would not shock me it would not shock me to see RCL"
"14118640","14123400"," start squeezing because I bet the hedge wall is down very low on it right now. "
"14127760","14128780"," Can you guys hear me out there?"
"14132870","14133610"," You guys hear me right?"
"14133830","14134170"," Yeah you can."
"14134830","14144130"," You can hear me okay so let's look at Palantir Palantir, Palantir."
"14145510","14154310"," I'm always making fun of this clear skies to 35 on Palantir clear skies to 35. "
"14155270","14156830"," You've got more buyers and sellers."
"14157450","14163190"," Of course there's like a bazillion shares out there in this world they need to start doing some F"
"14163190","14173130"," in buybacks no offense nothing negative to say about them but it pisses me off they got so many"
"14173130","14173890"," shares out there."
"14174530","14181130"," Okay so with R18 you are at firm support if any of you want a great stock to buy this"
"14181130","14186710"," is the place to buy it you can see that you've got a put or excuse me a put wall"
"14186710","14194790"," down here in Palantir they're at the bottom I mean $17 is basically bottom it can go slightly lower"
"14194790","14201850"," times but generally speaking you know you can do you know what the best plan for Palantir is is"
"14201850","14208970"," that you buy it somewhere down here and then you just sell OTM puts on it and you just collect"
"14208970","14218690"," money on outside the money puts your first wall is at 25 we kind of already knew that the walls"
"14218690","14226170"," are kind of similar here 25 or call it 2483 and then 30 bucks but in reality this is a"
"14226170","14232050"," great accumulate this is a great great place to accumulate Palantir mostly because you can sell"
"14232050","14232710"," puts on it. "
"14233690","14242990"," The expectation that my thought would be does it go deeper or sell off deeper I don't know 18 bucks"
"14242990","14252280"," 17 bucks maybe so what do you sell you sell like sell $15 puts or something maybe not coming out"

"14281240","14286720"," going to say that you're at rock bottom I'm going to say it's probably a buy for 2022 at this"
"14286720","14293160"," price and even if it just goes sideways for three months you just keep selling puts until it goes"
"14293160","14301760"," up it's a good place I like Palantir here it's a great stock good job good job calling that one"

"14339700","14346160"," that mean they send it to 100 and then tell people okay now buy RCL right do they drive it"
"14346160","14359830"," up from 70 to 100 dollars and then all of a sudden it's okay now they just"

"14367450","14374590"," dollars how many times five six times what news is coming out that there would be a sell lower than"
"14374590","14384510"," right around there your risk versus reward to sell puts on Palantir I take that bet all"
"14384510","14396650"," day long I don't"
"14396650","14402930"," think anything's changed on on Tesla I think Tesla's I think everybody's just in wait mode on Tesla"
"14402930","14407910"," for the because you I guarantee I'm not even on social media right now and I guarantee that people"
"14407910","14414610"," are like a bunch of bulls are just pacing around saying what are they gonna lift the shorts they're"
"14414610","14420130"," gonna do it today they're gonna do it tomorrow that's what I'm thinking if I'm thinking it I'm not"

"14438630","14445050"," you don't think Tesla's going up you can't think that the rest of the market is going up into the"
"14445050","14455350"," new year it doesn't fit the narrative of the market going up and I don't think Tesla like"
"14455350","14461350"," it used to be that you could drop Tesla heavily and the market would still go up it's not as"
"14461350","14470910"," true anymore Tesla does somewhat ride with the index is better than it did in the past"
"14472810","14483220"," somewhat okay"
"14483220","14493030"," so that's a great point Hutch is making it doesn't matter what the CDC says it matters who's"
"14494410","14504010"," saying it right so if you listen to like Fauci it's the same news every day it"
"14504010","14510350"," matters when who's saying it and why they're saying it and how it got into your ear does that make"
"14510350","14518230"," sense so if you listen to it's way it's like so here's a prime example I got a prime example"
"14518230","14525870"," for it just to be clear to everybody out there I wear a mask I socially distance I'm triple"
"14525870","14536650"," vaccinated so I do what I'm told but let me explain something to you okay last weekend"
"14536650","14546570"," on Thanksgiving the news came out that 700 flights were canceled because of Omicron"
"14546570","14555470"," so I went and looked to find out on average every day how many flights are canceled"
"14555470","14565190"," and it was right around 700 now you know that we have more flights during the holidays than we do"
"14565190","14572150"," at a lot of times of the year so on average we would more than likely have more than 700"
"14572150","14580820"," flights canceled during Thanksgiving right and they did it to get or excuse me not Thanksgiving"
"14580820","14590670"," Christmas so the news was that we canceled all these flights then we had more"
"14590670","14602400"," cancel over the weekend and the blame was put on the coronavirus or COVID when the"
"14602400","14611040"," numbers still matched up to daily averages for us having flights canceled so it's not that the CDC"
"14611040","14620160"," didn't make these recommendations it's that the news is used specifically and you have to figure"
"14620160","14629780"," out why are they specifically making this news important at this moment right so I don't believe"
"14629780","14636320"," anything in the news everything that I believe in the news is that it's a narrative and why are we"
"14636320","14645910"," getting that narrative what is the intent or the implication behind it oh really"
"14645910","14656550"," awesome thanks Walter Bloomberg good job hodge"
"14656550","14668550"," so that's what that's my point is the news is used so like"
"14668550","14675350"," who paid to have that news story released who who stood to make the most money off that news story"
"14675350","14683950"," to be released if that's most news stories in my mind are they're geared towards either something"
"14683950","14690710"," that has to do with power or something that has to do with money but has nothing to do with"
"14690710","14700410"," them caring about you or I or anybody else I view most news like that and"
"14700410","14709790"," further story I was in the army so you know you'd be you'd come back to a base right they"
"14709790","14714550"," would have like they would have these like containers and shit and they have it's an arm forces"
"14714550","14723700"," network I think it was called AFRN or something it was called and you'd be sitting there and it's"
"14723700","14733190"," bizarre too it's so bizarre because you have like a they'd have like CNN on and or Fox News on"
"14733190","14737710"," I figure out what they have they have the arm forces network but then they would have like CNN or"
"14737710","14744530"," some shit on but not the military news but like the civilian news and they'd be reporting on shit"
"14744530","14752290"," you were doing and none of it was what you were actually doing so even then in the military I"
"14752290","14757490"," knew that you know everything that you're hearing even from like we got a war or some shit like"
"14757490","14766590"," that it's not anything with what's happening you know one time I remember this one time I get a"
"14766590","14772730"," prime exam for you I shouldn't be talking about this but so one time I was I was on a"
"14772730","14781490"," I was in a station in Korea and I remember that like an AWAC or something was was nudged or"
"14781490","14785290"," shot or if it was a spy plane or if it was an AWAC or something it was like an"
"14785290","14790650"," accident over China or like one of our spy planes was either shot that something happened with like"
"14790650","14797230"," a spy plane or something or an AWAC or something can't remember what plane it was but I remember"
"14797230","14804330"," watching the news and they were like the US has suspended any spy flights over China or some shit"
"14804330","14809330"," like that I don't think it was North Korea it was like China they were like we suspended flights"
"14809330","14819050"," and I'm sitting on a range looking down on a base, an air base and they're launching these things"
"14819050","14823730"," that look like you too I swear they're you too like this big black plane with big wide wide wings"
"14823730","14832610"," and they're actively sending these spy birds up in the air you know blaze in North and I'd just"
"14832610","14838830"," come back from some chow and you know we're saying something but we're doing something completely"
"14838830","14844370"," different so I don't believe the news I think the news is manufactured on both sides to sell"
"14844370","14854320"," something or or for some form of power right it's"
"14854320","14862080"," out of power of money okay so I don't know Tesla's not too much at this point right you see"

"15521040","15531040"," 2009 to 2015 we had moderate growth and then we had a couple"
"15531040","15540810"," years of sideways down 2015-2016 and then we had a pretty good ramp right so it was"
"15540810","15551370"," like 17-18-19 and then year 4 which"

"15567890","15575360"," was massive and then if you look at the indexes we've had a stealth correction going on for an"
"15575360","15585360"," entire year so what if the index is trade sideways in 2022 but"
"15585360","15593120"," targeting individual stocks that are bottom you know you're shifting from targeting indexes to"
"15593120","15602040"," targeting just stocks trading in individual tickers rather than the indexes and even then the"

"15613360","15622200"," starting in September but mostly in November and December the trading has been outstanding"
"15622200","15632090"," there's no like the trading has been well first the"
"15632090","15638430"," whole year has been great because you're like every 24 every every OPEX knew it was going down and"

"15651990","15660180"," year or two you'd still make great money and if we had a stealth correction then you're what you're"
"15660180","15667200"," saying is we could target individual tickers that could move up without the indexes going up so if"

"22636970","22646150"," the risk to reward for it paying is there so if we do pin 480 tomorrow if we pin 480"

"22698070","22707350"," or anything there's no intrinsic value on that call so what happens is all that all that all that"
