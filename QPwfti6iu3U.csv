"6730","11450"," Let's see if this is working this time, if the internet is better."
"21520","27850"," Let's see if I'm back on or not."
"29890","30630"," Hi Kitty. "
"32250","33070"," All right."
"34870","36070"," Let's try this again."
"37450","38290"," All right. "
"38590","38910"," Hey everybody."
"43880","44940"," Sorry about that."
"44940","48380"," I was having some issues with the internet. "
"48840","50280"," They were persisting all morning."
"51260","55140"," So we loaded this back up to take a reloaded everything reset internet."
"56020","59400"," I think it has something to do with the snow in my neighborhood. "
"60660","61840"," You guys hear me out there?"
"63560","64120"," All right."
"64220","64319"," Great."
"65600","66260"," All right. "
"66480","66900"," Good afternoon."
"67120","70860"," It's 12.04. Just a quick heads up."
"71000","73940"," We have some XBI calls coming in. "
"73960","74680"," I know some of you guys."
"76200","79840"," Are addicted to biotech."
"81020","85040"," Million dollars in calls March 18th, 97 C."
"86720","87900"," Good to see you guys. "
"93440","94520"," Hey, Jim James."
"94780","95960"," I just tell me to hold these putts."
"102090","102850"," No, no, it's fine. "
"106430","107170"," Were you here?"
"107350","109470"," Carvel cowboy when we bought those calls yesterday?"
"111550","112350"," This is W."
"112890","112930"," E."
"113470","113470"," B."
"113870","114090"," R."
"114550","115750"," Our pirate captain radio."
"118490","120950"," Did you buy those calls yesterday with me cowboy starfish?"
"127720","129580"," Did you make bank on those on those calls?"
"130160","131040"," Yeah, he's joking."
"131460","132020"," Oh, he knows. "
"135880","137180"," You are short though."
"137380","138600"," Yeah, I think it's OK to be shorter."
"139460","142740"," I mean, well, yeah, in the overall sense of things. "
"145780","149360"," Technically, there's still a good chance that we trade back down to retest."
"149900","151880"," In past history, we have."
"153560","155220"," So I have to keep that. "
"155540","157120"," That's still in the back of my mind, right?"
"157200","160080"," I still have the layered outlook on the market."
"163660","167960"," You know, you do have to have the layered outlook on the market."
"172070","175390"," But you also have to respect the bulls and what they're doing today. "
"177550","185970"," And you have to think about the skirt being raised by the banks yesterday."
"186790","188790"," You know, those banks, they just, they're relentless."
"191090","195410"," You know, banks hire the smartest people out there, or they think they do. "
"196090","201310"," And they've got computers running and they've got algoes running."
"204670","206290"," We know that the market has changed."
"206470","211470"," Anyone that's traded this market, anything before I want to call it. "
"214650","218610"," Really, it started to ramp up and like, well, no, the ramp ups taken place the past couple of"
"218610","218770"," years."
"220110","221470"," There was an article done recently."
"223910","228290"," And I think I can remember was Wall Street general the New York Times, but they discussed in depth. "
"230990","235710"," That the hedge funds in the banks learned from the GME fiasco."
"237590","239510"," And how to relentlessly trade this market."
"239890","243490"," They were very insulted and very upset that they were taken for a ride. "
"243850","245330"," That was not lost upon banks."
"246190","248790"," So the ramp up probably took place in 2020."
"249370","253010"," But the HFT is like the high frequency traders. "
"254530","257490"," The algorithms have just become relentless over the years."
"259269","261430"," And it's got, it's like peak right now, right?"
"261610","264350"," We've got peak connectivity amongst retail traders."
"267050","270250"," And so there's a war going on right now in the market. "
"270730","272130"," So yeah, you can change your position."
"272770","275790"," You can change your bullish to bearishness on the fly right now."
"276610","279610"," Anyone's been trading longer than like five years or so. "
"279970","280890"," Ten years it was there."
"281010","281710"," It was there in 87."
"282310","284490"," They started to make or use computers more frequently. "
"284990","289050"," Actually, they tried to fix them because that's who crashed the market, in my view."
"290190","297470"," But over time, we're working towards that moment, another moment to the market where you have to be"
"297470","297670"," fast."
"297990","299610"," And you have to change your viewpoints on the market. "
"301110","303450"," Watching some AMC calls."
"304150","311190"," BB MU grab watching spy puts January 31st for 30 P."
"311570","316330"," And watching BB calls again."
"317130","325950"," QQQ puts $1.2 million January 31st 340 P PayPal half million dollars puts for June 17th 22. "
"326170","327950"," That looks more like a hedge against PayPal."
"327950","331690"," Not an actively I think PayPal is going to burn."
"333630","338730"," You are going to expect to see bears put up a fight here. "
"339230","340610"," It should be expected."
"343610","345950"," I'm watching a split come out right now."
"347270","349710"," INTC May 20th, 2022, right?"
"350350","355590"," They bought $2.2 million in calls and $2.2 million in puts. "
"356470","357250"," $2.3 million."
"358050","360510"," It looks like they got a split of some kind going on on INTC."
"362170","364790"," But you're going to expect bears to step up here. "
"365710","368010"," It's to be expected if the bulls are going to put up a fight."
"369710","372570"," We're going to do this BTC thing real quick, this Bitcoin thing."
"372570","376690"," I just want to take a real look at Bitcoin because I'm bearish on Bitcoin overall. "
"377770","383550"," I think it all it takes is a country to say we're going to switch to the digital dollar."
"383630","385710"," You've got six months to get out of your cryptocurrency."
"386790","387710"," And that would be the end of it. "
"388470","389270"," It could be that fast."
"389530","392370"," You'd see a crash in crypto overnight."
"393390","394490"," Do I think they're going to do that?"
"394730","394790"," No. "
"395610","397110"," But do I think they're going to try to control it?"
"397310","397430"," Yes."
"397830","399630"," I know the arguments against controlling it."
"400570","406570"," But our government is ruthless and our banks are ruthless and they will protect it all costs"
"406570","407210"," wealth. "
"409250","411210"," So I think Quinn has some of this right."
"411450","413190"," I agree with Quinn to a lot of extent."
"413570","418750"," A lot of the minutia that people argue about when it comes to this kind of stuff. "
"420550","424470"," I always come back to that old white guy, that creepy old white rich guy."
"424910","426470"," And he doesn't care about any of that stuff."
"427730","429290"," That creepy old banker. "
"430370","432350"," He could care less about the minutia."
"432530","435790"," All he cares about is keeping control of power and money."
"436650","438230"," And so they don't want to hear it, right?"
"438450","440090"," So that's my point on that. "
"440690","444770"," Now we've got, so we're going to look at what real support is on Bitcoin."
"445170","447470"," And I'm thinking that a lot of Bitcoin holders know this."
"449290","450590"," This argument, right?"
"450730","453750"," The danger that that's there, even if they can't say it to you. "
"454370","457310"," Publicly, that is the concern behind the scenes."
"458470","462170"," Release people that don't have an insider take on what the government is going to do."
"462730","466170"," The fear is that there will be regulation at some point that's more fierce. "
"467070","473270"," So if you're looking for a support level on Bitcoin, this is unusual to see just so you know in"
"473270","475810"," Bitcoin, usually you see more information."
"476830","479070"," So I want you to know that this is unusual to see, right?"
"479270","483290"," You don't normally see, you usually see more support levels in Bitcoin."
"484190","486050"," And you're not seeing that right now in Bitcoin. "
"486690","487750"," They are at a major support."
"491010","498130"," You are looking to trade down next to the 37, light support at 37, major support at 35."
"500410","501410"," Is next stop. "
"504490","510390"," The support levels are firming up on Bitcoin in terms of, you know, people are setting specific buy"
"510390","510890"," areas."
"514860","518100"," Seeing some Apple puts come in January 28."
"518860","520020"," Bets against Apple. "
"520880","524780"," 900,000 out nine or $1 million, basically two sets."
"526040","527900"," January 28, 160 P."
"529320","530120"," Fair bet."
"532820","534300"," I can't argue that bad, right?"
"535680","538140"," I don't know if I would have dated it for the 28th. "
"539000","540880"," Probably would have dated it a little farther out."
"540880","549170"," I wouldn't have dated those puts that close."
"552490","553970"," Maybe they know something we don't know. "
"554350","555830"," We've got spy calls coming in 445."
"557850","560490"," See, expiring February 4."
"562490","563910"," These are new calls, right?"
"564210","564890"," That's another thing too."
"565130","569190"," Another thing to look at is the volume of calls inputs that are new. "
"570030","573270"," Not just the old ones, right?"
"573270","577590"," There's already been hedging done for the puts, the massive put flow that came in."
"577870","579290"," There's two kinds of put flow, right?"
"579450","580250"," There's put flow."
"580890","582170"," That comes from a prop desk. "
"583710","584730"," You got a big banker."
"585410","588450"," He's going to tell you, a big banker's going to, an old man's going to say, tell a young guy's"
"588450","590570"," going to say, hey, look, I want you to put a hedge on the market."
"591470","592870"," I'm going to give you a date, right?"
"593690","595530"," A date might be short dated or long dated. "
"596790","598250"," And they both have different implications."
"599110","604430"," And then they'll even tell a prop trader will say, hey, I want you to throw some puts on there"
"604430","604810"," as well."
"605150","606390"," Like some short dated just puts. "
"607850","611810"," And if they don't put those puts on, that's different still."
"611990","615270"," It's still a different paradigm as to how bearish they are."
"615970","616850"," Sometimes they won't. "
"616910","617770"," They'll just put the hedge on."
"618230","619690"," Sometimes they put the hedge on in the money."
"620250","621450"," Sometimes they have a price target. "
"622610","623390"," And the dates are important."
"624010","625710"," And the amount that's coming in is important."
"626530","631790"," Sometimes when you just see just put flow but no hedging, it's just to impact the price of the"
"631790","632490"," stock today. "
"634830","636950"," Now, sometimes these trades are very, very complicated."
"637170","640470"," Sometimes they are selling to bears."
"640810","642990"," Sometimes they are selling to bulls. "
"643710","646190"," Sometimes they're trying to expand the trading range."
"647590","647630"," Right?"
"647790","648490"," There's an intent, right?"
"648870","653950"," Sometimes there's so many different complications behind why these stuff is placed."
"654350","656910"," And then the context of them is important. "
"658650","659890"," When did they come out?"
"660230","661250"," Have they already printed?"
"663630","667830"," Are they long and they're just placing at this point hedges against us going long?"
"668450","671170"," Have they switched from a hedge to a year ago in there?"
"672170","675450"," So even some of these puts that I'm seeing are in the money."
"675650","677390"," They're not outside of the money."
"677470","679670"," They were outside of the money earlier last week. "
"680070","683010"," They were overwhelming past month."
"684230","687670"," We're seeing more calls that we've ever seen in a month today."
"689370","691290"," Seeing calls on..."
"693130","695250"," Let's see some stuff and see some calls on. "
"695370","696510"," Or see some puts."
"697170","697650"," IMAB."
"699030","699510"," IMAB. "
"700150","701090"," Don't know anything about this company."
"701890","704270"," February 18th, 25p for $1 million."
"704930","705550"," I like that bet. "
"706610","708270"," Someone must know something we don't know."
"708970","713430"," The DKNG calls $177,000."
"713950","715950"," February 18th, 23c. "
"716470","717290"," Spy calls."
"718350","721550"," February 4th, 445c for $300,000."
"721870","722510"," Upstart calls. "
"723250","726430"," January 28th, 110c, $237,000."
"727530","728630"," Lots of call flow on BB."
"729770","731810"," See some bear stepping in again, right?"
"732250","735130"," QQQ's February 2nd, 345p. "
"735130","738850"," I like that a little bit more time on some QQ's."
"738950","742390"," Whoever that was, placed $315,000 in puts."
"742830","743950"," Because it gives a few days, right?"
"745530","747650"," Gives a few days for a shakeout on tech. "
"749570","752030"," We have HAL, 617."
"753490","756250"," June 17th, 40c, $52,000."
"757150","757630"," Respectable bet. "
"758910","759770"," Give it six months."
"761150","763010"," Give volatility a moment to calm down the market."
"764210","767170"," Has an overall bullish view on that ticker. "
"769590","771270"," Right, we've got IWM puts."
"773150","777110"," January 28th, 198p for $157,000."
"777490","778010"," It's localized. "
"778530","779370"," It's two days from now."
"780330","786090"," But at the same time, we've got bulls setting up for the next round of ER."
"786570","791370"," You've got bulls stepping in today saying there's a lot of bottoms out there in the market on small"
"791370","792410"," caps, mid caps. "
"793450","799990"," And I'm going to take that trade on, I'm assuming that the trade today in small mid caps has more"
"799990","800570"," to do with premium."
"801490","806670"," You buy now and you're going to see bulls jump in at some point the next week or two."
"807090","812970"," The moment that the focus is off of big tech, you are going to see retail. "
"813190","815550"," That's 20 to 30% of the market that's traded."
"816250","821590"," We'll step in and take bets on small caps and mid caps, even if they're not going to have a"
"821590","821950"," great ER."
"821950","824070"," It didn't get a matter if they have a great ER. "
"824530","828250"," The only thing that's going to matter is that people are going to trade it."
"829430","835830"," And so if they're taking trades on IWM, they're taking trades on RK."
"836930","843730"," And they're taking the risk based upon people getting interested in the next round of ER. "
"843730","845290"," That makes sense to me."
"845610","852190"," The AMC calls coming out January 25th, 18C for $138,000."
"853410","859830"," Someone just followed up on that INTC trade, probably trying to play the bump off of the hedging. "
"860450","863850"," So we have INTC or the straddle that they've got on INTC."
"864410","868430"," February 11th, 52, February 11th, 52.5C for $100,000."
"870850","873050"," And you have to be able to adjust in this market. "
"873550","877610"," If you hear me on here 24 hours a day, not 24 hours, I'm taking the time out of my"
"877610","881010"," day and trading this market live with you guys every day, right?"
"881110","882470"," I'm here every single day with you guys."
"883270","887450"," And if you're not here for an hour or for a half an hour and you don't see that we're"
"887450","890630"," shifting or moving with the markets, I don't want to say to you."
"890690","891690"," I'm a trader, right?"
"891850","892310"," That's what I am. "
"893850","894150"," Thank you, Kevin."
"895890","901890"," If you guys want to buy a stock and if you guys want to buy a stock and hold it"
"901890","905750"," for the next six months or a year, you should go see him."
"906990","914010"," If you want to be told sweet nothings as a bear, there's a bunch of guys out there that that's"
"914010","914410"," all they do. "
"915170","917510"," I tell you what you want to hear every single day."
"918750","922310"," They play Kate, the right, they give you the bottle."
"922310","924150"," They do it for bulls too, right?"
"924410","929370"," There's channels out there that all they are is bullish and they'll play Kate and they'll go there"
"929370","929950"," every single day. "
"931250","935710"," And no matter if the market's falling, they'll give you the sad face, it's falling, don't worry,"
"935810","936530"," it's going back up."
"937390","942910"," You go to channels that are bear channels and they'll tell you that we've got a bunch of fraud"
"942910","943990"," candles today, right?"
"944290","945310"," Green fraud candles today."
"946030","950510"," I'll tell you that every single day when it's up, they'll be happy when it's down, right?"
"950510","951950"," So you can get your fill from that. "
"952590","953330"," I'm a day trader."
"954230","959770"," I swing trade, I take long positions, I take short positions, so you're going to hear me change my"
"959770","959990"," views."
"960330","963550"," You'll hear me change them at the moment of a day, right?"
"964330","969330"," You'll hear me change my view from hour to hour at times, sometimes from minutes to minutes. "
"969450","974110"," Sometimes I make the wrong decision, I make a bag trade, and I need to adjust to it, right?"
"976170","977830"," You're not going to see me win every trade."
"977830","986030"," I know I win enough that I'm living and I've got family, phone houses, feel good about myself,"
"986270","986310"," right?"
"986470","987730"," Get to go skiing, get to go traveling."
"988690","989610"," I don't have to work a job. "
"991250","992370"," I know it works for me."
"992690","997530"," If you don't like my trading, if you're like, hey, I think that you're wrong."
"998050","999890"," That's fine, you can discuss it, that's fine. "
"1000750","1001990"," If you don't like it, right?"
"1002450","1005170"," You can tune in somewhere else, you can trade against me."
"1005170","1007130"," I don't require that anyone trades with me."
"1007590","1012650"," In the description of my videos down below, I say if you're losing money, just paper trade against"
"1012650","1012890"," me. "
"1013010","1018430"," You can paper trade like with me against me until you're making money on either side of that trade."
"1019150","1021150"," You can say, hey, I like listening to Kevin Newsymm James."
"1021770","1022350"," I don't agree with him. "
"1023210","1024250"," So I'll just trade against him."
"1026410","1028329"," Or, ah, now I'm starting to make some money."
"1028569","1029790"," So now I know what to listen to. "
"1030390","1031730"," Now I know how long to take trades."
"1032050","1033430"," Now I know how to balance my trade."
"1034349","1039250"," If you're out there trading with no protection, generally speaking, most of my trades are"
"1039250","1039510"," protected. "
"1040670","1041950"," My risk is low."
"1042930","1046310"," Not only is my risk low, but oftentimes they print well."
"1047349","1049750"," I can dump a position in a moment if I need to. "
"1050570","1052870"," I'm not trading 100% of my accounts ever."
"1053710","1056250"," Sometimes I have, but it's rare."
"1058590","1058790"," Right?"
"1059070","1062470"," So if you have to trade with like 20 bucks or 100 bucks or 1,000 bucks or 5 grand"
"1062470","1067270"," or 10 grand or 100 grand, it shouldn't be 100% of your account. "
"1067510","1071770"," I've got videos going back talking about this from the beginning when I started making just videos."
"1073050","1073230"," Right?"
"1073370","1074030"," How much are you risking?"
"1074870","1076050"," What's your time horizon?"
"1077510","1080710"," What are market conditions, all that kind of stuff, right?"
"1082050","1083710"," So I love you guys tuning in."
"1084030","1088610"," I love all of you out there, especially the people that are constructive helping each other along. "
"1088610","1091390"," I don't mind even constructive like I don't agree with him."
"1091450","1091930"," That's all fine."
"1092150","1099570"," But if you start to overtake and try to shift my viewpoint in the market or where I can't focus"
"1099570","1103130"," on running live stream and trading myself, that becomes an issue. "
"1103450","1104510"," And I can't be an issue."
"1105870","1106710"," Can't be an issue."
"1106910","1112410"," And ultimately, if you read down the description of my videos, I talk about the responsibility of"
"1112410","1113770"," every investor and trader out there. "
"1114170","1117950"," You are responsible for everything that you do."
"1119050","1120670"," You are responsible for your money."
"1121110","1125150"," You're responsible at the end of the day for being able to lose the entire trade and not getting"
"1125150","1125350"," mad. "
"1126070","1134790"," You'll never see me go on Twitter and say to people, hey, Mike, I followed you in a trade and"
"1134790","1135210"," it lost."
"1136410","1137250"," And I blame you."
"1139450","1140470"," You just don't hear it. "
"1142250","1143050"," You don't hear it."
"1143110","1145910"," I don't come to you and say, you know, it was a bad trade."
"1146790","1147290"," It's your fault. "
"1147290","1149410"," Every time I make a bad trade, you know what I say?"
"1150210","1151790"," What mistake did I make?"
"1153510","1154410"," What did I miss?"
"1155210","1157090"," Did I forget to check Spock gamma today?"
"1157430","1161850"," Did I forget to check my charts today?"
"1161870","1164910"," Did I forget to check the news today?"
"1165770","1168270"," Was I not listening to the test levels today?"
"1169410","1170770"," Anywhere that I missed something?"
"1173250","1173650"," Right?"
"1173850","1174490"," I'm not going on."
"1174690","1176190"," I'm not saying, hey, you know what I did?"
"1176890","1179870"," I listened to this one guy and it's his fault."
"1180930","1181910"," You just can't. "
"1182030","1182510"," You can."
"1182810","1184090"," I can tell you exactly what's going to happen."
"1186050","1187470"," Is that you're going to blow up your account?"
"1189770","1191190"," So you have to take in. "
"1191430","1192750"," You have to use all your tools you have."
"1192950","1196810"," If I'm one of your tools, you have a complete set of tools, a big box."
"1197310","1198510"," You have your tools in that box. "
"1198510","1200730"," You put together what everyone else is saying."
"1201150","1201510"," You look."
"1201670","1202310"," You do your research. "
"1202350","1203910"," You do everything you need to do in a company."
"1204970","1206170"," You're checking book map."
"1206350","1207930"," You're checking your flow software. "
"1208650","1209850"," You're doing your charts."
"1211070","1212490"," And if something doesn't match up."
"1214570","1215050"," Right?"
"1215210","1217690"," You have to still make your decision as to where you're taking something. "
"1217950","1218510"," Where you're going."
"1219850","1221170"," Why you're taking trades."
"1224960","1229020"," You know, my trades this morning, I made money yesterday. "
"1229020","1229740"," A lot of money."
"1229940","1230680"," So I need."
"1231260","1231720"," All right. "
"1231880","1233800"," So I'm like, Hey, I'm going to blow some money today."
"1233820","1235540"," I want to enjoy my trading day today."
"1236640","1238140"," So I need you to know that too, right?"
"1248940","1250340"," It wouldn't be the same way. "
"1250380","1250860"," It wouldn't be the same way."
"1250860","1250880"," It wouldn't be the same way."
"1250880","1253720"," It was a late morning jump to run up IV and GME. "
"1253760","1254760"," So they can burn both sides."
"1254960","1255340"," Go to Friday."
"1255600","1255860"," Good point. "
"1258920","1259980"," People actually do that."
"1264840","1265560"," Thank you."
"1265560","1269180"," You have aOTS to go to Friday, released this policy statement at 2pm eastern time, Powell takes the"
"1269180","1277350"," meeting questions at 2.30. Yeah, you got to understand that. "
"1277950","1279150"," It's down in the description."
"1279970","1284650"," I have a further one that I have to give the Joe donut so he can post it."
"1285090","1287630"," It's in depth, but you know, honestly. "
"1288710","1290630"," You got to take responsibility for your training."
"1290630","1294290"," you have to know the risk associated if you lose that trade."
"1295090","1301170"," Every trade that I take, every single trade that I take, I go into it saying, you know, what does"
"1301170","1302310"," it mean if I lose this trade?"
"1306720","1309600"," You know, we trade, we talk about trading to levels here. "
"1310680","1315240"," You know, we say we're taking this to this level, taking profit, we're going to let the banks do"
"1315240","1316020"," the work for us."
"1316780","1319240"," It is a rule for me."
"1320620","1324060"," A rule, right?"
"1326790","1328330"," I try out the banks do the work. "
"1329590","1333850"," For me, at each resistance level, I try to make the banks do the work for me at every support"
"1333850","1334270"," level."
"1342300","1348880"," If I'm trading a zero-day option and you're trading, you know, like a three-month call or"
"1348880","1351780"," something, we have different goals, right?"
"1355500","1360300"," We have different if you're in a three-month call on Apple or Tesla, let's say, you just want to"
"1360300","1362380"," check in and check sentiment, that sounds great."
"1364400","1369280"," You can't like, you know, base your three-month call on my zero-day call on the market. "
"1370800","1371840"," Does that make sense?"
"1377630","1380290"," Those arcade calls are gaining some premium, nice to see."
"1381590","1383050"," Spy, just kicking around."
"1383530","1384430"," It's a long-dated call. "
"1386330","1387470"," I'm going to be staring at it."
"1387630","1389190"," Peton could care less."
"1390470","1395870"," All I want to see on Peton is ER, and I'm in early on those puts. "
"1396730","1400470"," So I want to see the slow bleed on Peton."
"1401250","1403730"," I want to see the CEO have to be honest."
"1406210","1407370"," So I'm willing to pay for that. "
"1407650","1412470"," Because I've been through these before with other companies, and I don't like when companies act"
"1412470","1412930"," like that."
"1413650","1415850"," I've got a moral obligation to the market."
"1418490","1424950"," Keeping these companies honest, at least in their ERs, there's a legal reason for them to be honest"
"1424950","1425810"," in their ERs. "
"1426510","1431090"," Because they don't have to be honest at any of the time other than their ERs."
"1431330","1435750"," They can go on to like CNBC and talk all kinds of whatever, and they're not legally bound to it."
"1435950","1440570"," But on their ERs, when they get into the ERs, they have to be honest about it because you as"
"1440570","1443670"," an investor need to know what's really going on inside of that company. "
"1445810","1449770"," I got some bones to pick with specifically with Peton at this point."
"1451830","1457510"," Maybe it'll serve as a second lesson to some of these other companies that are coming up for their"
"1457510","1457970"," ERs."
"1458070","1465730"," I mean, in reality, Peton got picked out of the roast stocks to say, don't fuck around in this"
"1465730","1466570"," earnings season. "
"1467790","1473110"," Because people are relying upon these companies when they come into this earnings season, if the"
"1473110","1476530"," money supply is going to be cut off, and you're an investor, and if we're an investor, we're going"
"1476530","1479670"," to buy any kind of stocks this year."
"1480390","1484470"," I don't want to come into this earnings season, and I got a list of companies I'm looking at."
"1484570","1486470"," I'm like, I'm looking at PayPal, I'm looking at Square. "
"1487850","1490690"," I'm looking at at four, right?"
"1491010","1491670"," F-O-U-R?"
"1491990","1492930"," I want four, to be honest."
"1494030","1499190"," I want four in their ER to be like, hey, this is what's happening for us in the next three"
"1499190","1499390"," months."
"1499650","1505270"," It's critical for me as an investor and as a trader to know the truth of these companies that have"
"1505270","1505970"," been knocked down. "
"1507470","1512890"," So I can make an informed decision as to whether I want to buy a bottom on these tickers in"
"1512890","1513950"," the next coming month, right?"
"1513950","1520530"," Between now and March, I want to know if I can take a leap of faith with my hard-earned"
"1520530","1521230"," money in these companies."
"1522030","1526610"," I know that investors are thinking that right now, and it's critical that these companies are"
"1526610","1527690"," honest in their ERs."
"1528590","1537290"," How can PTON mess around in public with public knowledge and then expect people to show up at their"
"1537290","1543870"," ER this year and take them seriously if they're goofing around, right?"
"1543990","1551090"," How do you participate in a market that's changed if you get a clown show going on with PTON?"
"1551850","1556410"," If PTON gets away with it, does that mean that other speculative growth companies get to get away"
"1556410","1556690"," with it?"
"1559410","1560750"," See, I'm watching PTON. "
"1560850","1561910"," I'm not happy with PTON."
"1563670","1571970"," PTON is the bad example for an investor, and then some investors out there have lost their shirts,"
"1572730","1572950"," right?"
"1573330","1579330"," Some investors held on Harkay, some investors held on the underlying companies, and we can create"
"1579330","1584530"," and crack jokes out there in public and on Twitter and on Wall Street Bets or whatever, but some"
"1584530","1588430"," people put a lot of serious time and effort into researching these companies."
"1588890","1592350"," I see people all year long, they're like, I'm diming-handing this company. "
"1592470","1593650"," I'm diming-handing that company."
"1595770","1603950"," You get a clown show going on one to three months before PTON's ER, and it's not funny."
"1604310","1606870"," There's a background to that. "
"1607210","1616970"," It's not funny for a serious investor that wants to buy this market, and"
"1616970","1620230"," so all these companies, all these small speculative growth companies are going to be under the"
"1620230","1623810"," microscope heading into the next couple of weeks, right?"
"1623930","1625050"," So we're looking forward right now."
"1626030","1630370"," We know that there's going to be interest from long-term investors in these small caps."
"1633550","1638890"," We know that there's people out there that are waiting for me, Kevin, to say, this is the next"
"1638890","1639930"," stock that I bought. "
"1639930","1649590"," And you know that there's a whole class of investor that is going to be looking and under the"
"1649590","1653190"," microscope at these small caps, these mid caps, these speculative growth stocks."
"1653950","1655290"," They want hard answers."
"1656330","1658390"," They want to hear that they've made progress. "
"1659410","1661550"," They want to hear that they're going to start making profit."
"1662330","1663970"," They want to hear that they're cash-rich."
"1666950","1670630"," They want to hear moving forward. "
"1671910","1675450"," And this could be a big upset for bears."
"1678530","1685190"," Microsoft yesterday having that forecast saying, no, we're still going to be growing because we've"
"1685190","1686710"," done our work, right?"
"1687330","1688570"," We've done our work in the cloud."
"1689910","1693190"," During this growth period, we've taken the time to invest in our future. "
"1694010","1694750"," We're looking."
"1695210","1699310"," They're going to reward a company like Microsoft, and they're going to buy Microsoft."
"1699450","1704990"," Even if it sells down today, which is absolutely normal, you're going to see a lot of people buying"
"1704990","1708390"," it that they can trust Microsoft heading into the future. "
"1709230","1714710"," And there's going to be a lot of investors looking at small mid caps heading into this ER season"
"1714710","1717150"," and checking off these."
"1717570","1718730"," Everybody's got a small list, right?"
"1718830","1723490"," You got your own hundred companies, 50 companies, 20 companies, and you're going to pay attention"
"1723490","1730930"," to their ERs and their making the list, but they're not making the list, right?"
"1731150","1735130"," We had a bunch of companies that didn't make the list last year, and that list is going to get"
"1735130","1738730"," smaller this year, right?"
"1742230","1747910"," So you don't want to see a clown show from Peton because they're going to get burned to the ground."
"1748470","1752350"," And you don't want to see a clown show from the SQs out there. "
"1752350","1756750"," You don't want to see a clown show from any companies that are speculative growth."
"1756890","1758410"," You want to see we did our work."
"1759350","1760810"," We have cars in production. "
"1762550","1764070"," We're selling our software."
"1764890","1765530"," You name it, right?"
"1765770","1766810"," We've invested in the cloud."
"1767610","1772730"," We've done whatever it is that we promised that we were going to do. "
"1773910","1778810"," We're making tons of money now to cut the fat and rate a rock and roll."
"1781330","1782510"," And Microsoft proved that yesterday."
"1783570","1789450"," That's an important thing about that Microsoft ER yesterday was that they are ready for the next"
"1789450","1789750"," step. "
"1791430","1793710"," So we're going to be looking for that from this week."
"1793910","1796010"," The next couple days we're looking there for that from Tesla."
"1796810","1798430"," We're looking for that from Apple. "
"1799670","1801110"," These companies that we hold up high."
"1803210","1804450"," We're looking at that from Amazon."
"1804810","1805290"," We're looking for that. "
"1805410","1807910"," Even if they're overpriced, we are looking for that."
"1809790","1811430"," As investors, they're looking for that."
"1812070","1816290"," We're still looking for the best price to enter these companies, but it's a very serious earnings"
"1816290","1816710"," season. "
"1819330","1822350"," We saw Disney come out and they got serious in their last earnings."
"1823350","1826590"," We saw Netflix come out this time and get real serious in their earnings."
"1827990","1830650"," And so it's that it's that comes to daddy moment, right?"
"1830890","1833630"," We have to be like, okay, dad, I messed up. "
"1835290","1837270"," Or okay, dad, I did the right thing."
"1839450","1840710"," Here's my SAT scores."
"1841650","1841910"," They're good. "
"1843210","1845010"," I did all the work I was supposed to do."
"1846230","1847550"," To get where I am today."
"1850070","1850550"," Right?"
"1850750","1853410"," So we're looking for that from companies heading into ER season. "
"1854270","1855770"," It's 12.34 in the afternoon."
"1856170","1865890"," We are awaiting the Fed at 2 p.m. and 2.30. I want to also, if you're just listening"
"1865890","1873030"," for the first time this today, I do want to let you know that if you haven't traded a Fed"
"1873030","1880570"," meeting, not the minutes, but the meeting that there's often a stakeout is often a reaction."
"1880930","1882790"," There's often a reaction before the meeting. "
"1883210","1884970"," It was like one 30."
"1885350","1886410"," It's been happening earlier."
"1888010","1891630"," It's been happening at like one could happen today at any moments. "
"1891630","1892910"," It's 12.35, right?"
"1893170","1894690"," So the next half an hour, we could see a move."
"1895570","1897530"," We're going to look for the flow as it comes in."
"1897870","1899210"," We're going to move down in a rip higher. "
"1900350","1903430"," It gets wild in volatile during these meetings."
"1904230","1907730"," You can see a move up at 2 p.m. You can I've seen moves up at 2 p.m."
"1907870","1909190"," I wonder what I'm going to clock that say."
"1909670","1911450"," Then it rips super high. "
"1912410","1913550"," We hit a price target."
"1914050","1918610"," We hit resistance right before our 40 to the 42 100."
"1918790","1921710"," We hit 4400 to 4600 something like that. "
"1921810","1923130"," And then it's a straight reversal down."
"1924310","1925590"," So the banks can buy it."
"1926490","1928050"," But they want a better price than you have. "
"1929330","1930150"," But they wait."
"1930290","1931130"," They dump the market."
"1931150","1931950"," They take it long. "
"1935590","1938390"," Or the news is bad and we rip it higher so they can get out of their lungs."
"1938710","1940290"," And then they print all their putside."
"1940530","1941450"," All this can happen. "
"1942870","1944770"," No one can tell you what's going to happen."
"1947250","1951690"," And the crazy part about FMCs is you'll get the first part of the meeting, right?"
"1951870","1956490"," You'll get the 2 p.m. And then 230 rolls around."
"1957490","1959370"," And you start getting the talking going, right?"
"1959630","1960710"," J-Pau sucks at talking. "
"1961330","1962950"," He's done a better job here and there."
"1963590","1967650"," But when he starts getting asked questions, it's an issue."
"1968470","1970330"," And you'll get grand standing by people. "
"1970330","1971930"," You get grand standing across the board."
"1972330","1974530"," You'll get the Fed little Fed chairs come out."
"1974650","1975850"," Little Fed presidents still come out. "
"1976270","1978370"," And they'll counter his arguments."
"1987050","1989110"," Yesterday I had a bearish stance on the Fed."
"1990210","1997430"," And when I saw that look from the banks into the close where they were buying that dip, I think"
"1997430","1999470"," that they know better than I do. "
"1999470","2003390"," I think that the banks think that there's a bottomless market."
"2005910","2009610"," And that he'll be neutral to dovish to an extent."
"2011390","2013130"," I don't think he wants to disrupt the market. "
"2016450","2020310"," At this moment, I think that's the bank showed yesterday at the close."
"2022050","2027800"," I think the banks showed their cards yesterday."
"2029600","2033000"," Yesterday, at the end of the day, we were watching it happen, end of the close. "
"2033340","2035640"," I was scared death taking calls after the bell."
"2036740","2041820"," Literally, every big tech company was selling off on the Microsoft news."
"2042040","2043540"," We had limited information available. "
"2051460","2052679"," But it struck me as that."
"2052760","2053980"," It wasn't a usual move."
"2054199","2054739"," It was unusual. "
"2057440","2060239"," After the bell, it looked like my money was gone."
"2063570","2065530"," You know, it's kind of cute, right?"
"2066889","2073030"," All of a sudden you see in the media a story that gets pushed out of all that information."
"2073110","2077770"," It's oh, but the forecast says we're going to continue to grow in 2022. "
"2078909","2080889"," So they already know they pre know."
"2082650","2085630"," I wouldn't shock me to see that they trigger now go to panic everyone."
"2085630","2085730"," one. "
"2086510","2088090"," That's my take at this point."
"2088409","2090810"," They're able to buy that bottom across the board and all big tech."
"2091730","2096830"," Even if we trade down into next week or so, profit taking, they're still already in. "
"2097530","2103050"," If there's something they don't know from the Fed coming into this OPEX, not OPEX, into this FMC,"
"2103650","2106810"," they could get out before before, right?"
"2107730","2110090"," If the market moves up today, they're in below all of us."
"2110730","2112110"," They've got all their bases covered."
"2113170","2117070"," The banks are in better position than any of us right now. "
"2119170","2120490"," They've got their protection on."
"2121250","2122290"," They've bought big tech."
"2122670","2125770"," It wasn't us to bought big tech last night in the after hours. "
"2125770","2126310"," That was banks."
"2128610","2130130"," So their hedge is all a way around."
"2130850","2132350"," They win no matter what today. "
"2140030","2141790"," So how do you put a trade on into this?"
"2143370","2144790"," Into this FMC?"
"2145830","2147130"," So that's what I'm going to do right now."
"2147170","2148410"," I've got some other trades out there."
"2148830","2152530"," That's just money for me to gamble, right?"
"2152850","2153510"," I'm happy today. "
"2153830","2154210"," I made it."
"2154290","2155250"," I made it."
"2155370","2159250"," I had a very good day yesterday or at the opening bell today. "
"2161530","2162770"," So I've got a trade on."
"2164130","2166850"," But I'm going to look for something into today's FMC."
"2167670","2170210"," You guys take the trades that you want to take into this FMC. "
"2172170","2174230"," We've all known that we're building up to this moment."
"2176650","2178030"," Markets traded wildly."
"2179610","2184910"," No matter where we head right now, it doesn't matter if we get a VIX spike up to 50 right"
"2184910","2185170"," now. "
"2186030","2187350"," We know that it's a note event."
"2187510","2192310"," We know that once it's done, we've got nothing like this planned for the next two months."
"2194950","2197570"," We have OPEC's every month. "
"2197570","2199590"," We've got inflation stuff that'll come out."
"2200550","2202470"," But we've got no major events like this."
"2208370","2215650"," Watching Uber calls coming right now by the stacked up Uber calls, stacked up QQQ calls, Microsoft"
"2215650","2216270"," calls. "
"2221300","2223860"," I'm going to take a look inside of how I do this."
"2224160","2225140"," You guys want to know how I do this?"
"2225480","2226720"," Because I haven't really..."
"2226720","2230880"," A lot of people know about this now, so I see it all over the internet now."
"2231740","2234700"," But a lot of people didn't catch up to this in the beginning. "
"2234880","2235900"," It was like a free trade."
"2241780","2245820"," Something like a company of people that would trade one way against the market."
"2246460","2248220"," It was always going the opposite direction. "
"2248340","2249560"," People were just getting smoked."
"2252960","2258380"," It's printed for me in the past three, four, five, six, seven thousand percent like monster trades."
"2259800","2261800"," I don't know if this trade works today. "
"2262120","2267480"," I think too many people out there know about this trade that I might not work today."
"2270200","2271540"," I'm wary of this trade."
"2271680","2275720"," As a matter of fact, if I had to guess, there might be a violent move first. "
"2281220","2284380"," They might shake out this early trade today."
"2284660","2289780"," As a matter of fact, I'm looking on the spy options chain for the 26th."
"2293200","2294840"," Surprise, surprise. "
"2295320","2298840"," Today, it's not loaded to the tits."
"2300680","2305280"," It's not loaded to the man tits on an opposite side of the trade."
"2306620","2308860"," It's pretty well even Steven at this point. "
"2310200","2311940"," This is unusual to see."
"2315100","2322000"," Usually at this point in the day, there's like, I'm not joking, there's like millions of calls on"
"2322000","2325520"," one side or millions of puts on the other side."
"2327540","2328820"," I keep it very simple. "
"2329880","2330860"," I keep it very, very simple."
"2330960","2337880"," What I do is I think about it from a dealer or market maker's position."
"2338280","2339700"," I think about it from a greed position. "
"2340720","2343480"," I'm like, do they really want to pay all these puts out?"
"2345120","2347220"," Or do they really want to pay all these calls out?"
"2351160","2356160"," You got one side of just, if they get a print, sometimes they do like one out of 10 times"
"2356160","2361040"," they will if it's a wall of sentiment that comes into the market."
"2362260","2363600"," The wall of money comes in."
"2368440","2376300"," But usually what they'll do is they'll burn whatever side has the most to gain. "
"2378000","2381900"," Then they print whatever side has the least to gain."
"2383820","2385080"," I'm looking at them right now."
"2385160","2386960"," I'm looking at the chain right now and I'm just not seeing. "
"2387840","2388700"," Oh, wait a minute."
"2388980","2390000"," Wait a minute here."
"2390440","2391300"," They're starting to come in. "
"2392400","2398960"," I see a lot of 430 P's expiring today."
"2399200","2400140"," They're 39 cents."
"2401360","2404420"," But I see it weighted to the call side. "
"2406060","2411140"," 450 C, 105,000 contracts just popped up."
"2412240","2419720"," 41 cents loaded to the call side."
"2424870","2426690"," A lot of bullish flow today. "
"2431250","2437730"," I do wonder if the fed, if the fed were to say that they weren't cutting off the money supply,"
"2438310","2441690"," maybe IWM would have the biggest reaction."
"2444910","2447870"," Looking at second biggest reaction is probably tech."
"2449910","2454050"," Got Microsoft calls coming in ready for this January 28th. "
"2455490","2456530"," That's two days from now."
"2457510","2463110"," January 28th, 302.5 C, 2.6 million dollars."
"2463770","2464630"," Excuse me. "
"2500960","2506880"," Looks like the call side is heavy heading into the CFOMC."
"2511250","2514750"," We know that the bears have been in for a month."
"2517350","2518730"," Bears are loaded. "
"2520150","2521330"," Diamond handing."
"2522310","2525210"," We've argued all the reasons to be bearish here."
"2527250","2535090"," We've argued them nonstop every day, pounded him and pounded into our heads, right?"
"2535610","2538230"," We brought markets and mayhem on. "
"2539570","2542070"," Talked about technically why we should be bearish."
"2550910","2552730"," You've seen the cacophony, right?"
"2553430","2561230"," We've seen that the bear calls to the market to drop has just consumed everybody."
"2563830","2567390"," There's been huge money made off being bearish on this market. "
"2570330","2570970"," Huge."
"2570990","2574770"," We've knocked it down from 480 right down to 420."
"2576010","2581550"," Slapped the market down a few times in a larger time frame. "
"2581830","2584010"," We've knocked this market down since."
"2584970","2587830"," Well, we've knocked down the market since when?"
"2588110","2592150"," Well, at least the spy we've knocked down since end of year, right?"
"2592390","2594910"," Or September, actually, if you really look at it since September."
"2598290","2599970"," The role started happening, right?"
"2600090","2601650"," You started to see that role happen in September. "
"2605290","2614370"," We've beaten up any speculative growth gone over the course of a year that started in December"
"2614370","2615390"," right of 2021."
"2620000","2622760"," He just parks and puts on these tickers that are speculative growth."
"2623320","2625740"," He is watching him just drop over an entire year. "
"2628060","2630920"," We know that we've got just a few tickers holding the market up."
"2633980","2636600"," We also know we've got a bunch of growth stocks have been knocked down."
"2636600","2640440"," We know that a bunch of underlying parts of the of the market have been knocked down a ton. "
"2641180","2643380"," And they're pretty close, like not all of them."
"2643640","2646580"," But some of them are pretty close where they're getting viable again."
"2647940","2651560"," You can't lie and say there aren't tickers out there that aren't ready to be bought again because"
"2651560","2651840"," there are. "
"2655100","2656680"," Right, that gray area, right?"
"2657320","2662100"," There is that gray area right down the market where you look at the market and you say, Hey, you"
"2662100","2662300"," know what?"
"2662440","2663080"," We're pretty close."
"2664520","2664920"," Right?"
"2665080","2669480"," If we were at tops on a lot of these speculative growth companies, speculative growth stocks, and"
"2669480","2673280"," we let's say we've knocked down some of them right to down to some of some of their June levels,"
"2673680","2679040"," a few are at their September or their January levels of 2021 that only recently got knocked down."
"2679140","2684000"," But a lot of them have been knocked down right down to close to the trade that took place in"
"2684000","2686000"," March in May of 2020. "
"2686540","2688200"," So it's not like we're far away."
"2689580","2693760"," The conversation is not Hey, we're at peak FOMO in the market."
"2694100","2695060"," I've heard that too. "
"2695380","2701520"," Red Peak FOMO like now peak FOMO was it was 2020 December specifically of 2020."
"2703000","2705180"," We're peak FOMO across this entire market."
"2706460","2708320"," Apple didn't participate in that. "
"2710140","2712220"," To an extent Apple hasn't participated."
"2715640","2718460"," This OPEX is serious, right?"
"2719460","2720780"," We've had the market knocked down."
"2722320","2724420"," I agree with the book with the bears. "
"2726360","2728240"," I can't say they don't agree with the bears."
"2728240","2728640"," I do."
"2729880","2731480"," But then I look at the greed of the banks. "
"2733220","2734860"," Look at the greed of the politicians."
"2734940","2738940"," I look at the greed of, you know, the banks break stuff."
"2740300","2744880"," Even if we trade down, let's say we trade down to 400, I still think we trade to 500 or"
"2744880","2745080"," 600. "
"2745880","2748120"," I'm telling you, they're going to break it."
"2750740","2754680"," Our market knows no bounds in greed."
"2755840","2760520"," The United States, a good portion of the United States is based upon greed. "
"2762980","2765520"," I was watching a video late late the night last night."
"2765900","2775660"," There's a guy that made a video about how these all these suburbs, they don't"
"2775660","2777580"," allow grocery stores in them."
"2778100","2778980"," He's making up. "
"2779420","2780700"," This guy's like respected, right?"
"2781520","2785260"," And he's like, well, we need to change zoning of these neighborhoods because there's just a strip"
"2785260","2790420"," mall up the road with your local grocery store, but you'd like to have a local grocery store in"
"2790420","2790800"," your neighborhood."
"2791960","2795340"," And on the surface, it makes sense."
"2798280","2803440"," You can change the zoning of a neighborhood that wants to keep up small businesses and everything's"
"2803440","2803860"," cookie cutter. "
"2804280","2805340"," And no, I don't like those neighborhoods."
"2806220","2814440"," But, you know, let's say you bought one of those neighborhoods 10 years ago, right?"
"2814640","2819540"," And now real estate developers can't make any money left in that neighborhood."
"2820500","2821960"," So they've gone on to do new tracks elsewhere. "
"2823280","2826800"," Well, you've got all these reets that are buying up houses right now."
"2826920","2827860"," They want to turn them into rentals."
"2828840","2835040"," And so now you've owned your home in this community with covenants with zoning, right?"
"2835240","2839580"," Well, the reality is it sounds great that you want to put a cute little local shop in your"
"2839580","2839820"," neighborhood. "
"2840040","2845020"," But the truth is in the background, because I flip houses, the reality is what they really want to"
"2845020","2851540"," do is these reets want to turn your neighborhood that you live in into a rental community."
"2851540","2854740"," And they don't want to put a grocery store in your community."
"2855480","2861360"," They want to change the zoning so that they can renovate that house to put rentals in, put"
"2861360","2862080"," apartment in the garage. "
"2862140","2862500"," I'm kidding."
"2862500","2866180"," You know, put an apartment in the garage, put an apartment in the basement, right?"
"2867320","2870980"," These big companies, they buy these houses, and they're thinking rent them out to three different"
"2870980","2871340"," parties."
"2872180","2876220"," They can rip out the backyard grass and pave a driveway in there. "
"2876620","2881960"," Now you've got neighbors, you've got 10 people living next door, or they can knock the house down"
"2881960","2883560"," and put a condo in, right?"
"2883760","2887640"," Three apartments, three condos, whatever, duplex."
"2889200","2890880"," And they can double and triple their money."
"2891600","2892460"," The builders are happy. "
"2893600","2895840"," The real estate investors are happy."
"2896520","2901860"," Everybody's happy, except for you in your community that you bought into 10 years ago."
"2902080","2903780"," So on the surface, yeah, I want that little grocery store. "
"2904280","2908940"," But the reality is that's a behind the scenes in that guy's video."
"2909340","2915120"," It's probably getting paid by a real estate development interest that wants that push."
"2915380","2917920"," We can't have nice things in the United States. "
"2918520","2923100"," And the reason I'm saying that is because there's greed behind most of what you see in this"
"2923100","2923480"," country."
"2925620","2931000"," And see, even though I get bearish in the back of my mind, there's always that thought that no,"
"2931000","2932440"," they're not going to do the right thing."
"2933180","2937180"," They'll knock them down, but they're not going to knock them down to where you want to see them. "
"2938060","2939920"," At some point, they get greedy."
"2940860","2945020"," At some point, they look at an arcade and they go, hmm, you know what?"
"2945440","2947080"," Trade is on the other side at this point."
"2949560","2951020"," I'm going to be aware of that too. "
"2951160","2955300"," I don't know how many of you have done business before or have been in business when I've been in"
"2955300","2955660"," business."
"2956080","2960240"," And you've got the surf, you've got the surface, you've got the employees, let's see what the"
"2960240","2961060"," conversations are."
"2961180","2966920"," And then there's that back back room where the angel investors there or the backers there or your"
"2966920","2967680"," partners are there. "
"2967820","2970640"," And you have a conversation that is different than anyone else hears."
"2972960","2977020"," And they're not always evil, but usually the money behind you is evil."
"2979560","2982400"," You know, the guy gives you $5 million to run a business. "

"2996290","2998850"," So I was looking at the hood as to what's really going on. "
"2999510","3005050"," And yesterday, seeing that kind of blew me away because it showed that the banks were willing to"
"3005050","3008210"," buy yesterday is the point I'm trying to make."
"3009290","3013230"," But they can be making the turn while we're not making the, while we are not making the turn."
"3016940","3019040"," Watching some apple calls come in right now. "

"3049260","3057830"," January 28th, 15.5c. You know, so that's the stuff that I think about"
"3057830","3063660"," looking at that macro view in the market."
"3064580","3066220"," I'm looking at all the technicals."
"3066320","3068320"," I'm looking at everything that everybody's putting out there, right?"
"3068760","3070140"," Some great content out on Twitter. "
"3071160","3074100"," There are some great follows on Twitter for technical information."
"3076440","3080200"," Some people put out crazy stuff where you got spot gambling, putting out banging information."
"3081260","3084820"," There's all kinds of, you got Flow Algo putting out great information, you got our community"
"3084820","3085880"," talking to each other. "
"3091140","3097800"," At the end of the day, I got to think about everything about what is, what are the banks doing?"
"3098140","3099080"," That's what always comes back to."
"3099520","3100800"," How greedy are the banks today?"
"3114000","3119260"," When you hear people say, well, there's the big fraud candle, you'll hear that, you'll hear people"
"3119260","3119960"," talk about that right?"
"3120140","3120640"," Here comes the fraud."
"3122540","3124660"," He was famous for this is Eric Hagar. "
"3124860","3128920"," I like that guy a lot because he is frustrated as we are."
"3129040","3130280"," I'm frustrated the way the market is."
"3130420","3133460"," I don't want to see the market this high, but you'll see him talk about it. "
"3134340","3138120"," And his point is, you know, the fraud continues."
"3139260","3140840"," And so let's say we do trade up today."
"3142100","3144220"," I'm not saying that we are, but I'm saying, what if we do today?"
"3145160","3146740"," What happens to that argument, right?"
"3148360","3149360"," Over going down. "
"3151760","3158740"," So if you are short this market, heavily, I have to impress upon you that I hope that you have"
"3159350","3160560"," some kind of call hedging."
"3164280","3173960"," If you're long this market that you have some kind of put hedging because this"

"3234840","3235040"," trade. "
"3236340","3237180"," A lot."
"3237380","3240340"," I don't like it specifically like the way I think space is going to print."
"3240560","3245480"," No, I think that traders are interested in trading the ERs for these companies. "
"3250380","3251660"," EFA, another good one."
"3251960","3256940"," EFA, April 14th, 78C, $90,000."

"3261500","3261880"," they're doing."
"3262940","3263760"," So find out why."
"3263960","3266400"," Find out why somebody's placing a trade on $90,000 trade. "
"3266880","3267800"," It's all the way out of April."
"3267900","3268480"," Plenty of time."
"3268940","3269540"," Take that trade. "
"3272580","3277220"," Apple, May 20th, 185C, $400,000."
"3279710","3280840"," More bearish trades."
"3281740","3286700"," January 31st, Spy, $500,000. "
"3287020","3293580"," QQs, January 31st, 340P, $307,000."
"3293940","3295700"," Apple, another big trade in the positive."
"3296740","3301500"," May 20th, just starting to see people stack up watching bulls and bears right now, placing their"
"3301500","3301680"," bets. "
"3302780","3307260"," So what I'm seeing right now is a lot of retails, a lot of retail people placing their bets right"
"3307260","3307480"," now."
"3308280","3309920"," It is weighted towards the bulls."
"3310720","3311680"," Not going to lie about it. "
"3312060","3313460"," It's weighted towards the bulls right now."
"3315420","3316600"," It's all fresh, right?"
"3316760","3318480"," This isn't stuff that we've had on for a long time."
"3319240","3324940"," It does matter that new new new trades are coming in that are counter to the argument. "
"3330790","3332830"," And then there's another trade coming in right now."
"3332950","3341890"," There's an under under the surface trade betting on interest, moving and shifting over to small and"
"3341890","3344290"," mid caps in the next two weeks."
"3345150","3349870"," I don't think that everyone there cares yet about the actual ER. "
"3350350","3355790"," I think they care more about the interest that will grow in those positions."
"3356330","3359290"," These people probably sell out before the ER dates of these companies."
"3359950","3365010"," And then there's another undercurrent under all of that, where there's some smart positioning being"
"3365010","3365970"," taken right now. "
"3366610","3368770"," Here's another one that just came out, okay?"
"3369370","3369670"," Smart position."
"3370070","3372030"," These are people that do their due diligence."
"3372870","3374290"," You got MN TV. "
"3375950","3377230"," Is that Mountain TV?"
"3377390","3377650"," I don't know."
"3377930","3378650"," MN TV."
"3379230","3380890"," Mike November Tango Victor. "
"3384590","3385550"," July 15th."
"3385550","3392290"," A strike on it is 12.5. And someone bought $1.2 million in calls."
"3392770","3395910"," Do I think that that is for them to buy stock possibly?"
"3396770","3398810"," I think it's maybe meant to hold it up possibly. "
"3399390","3401250"," But I would least go down the rabbit hole on it."
"3402070","3408130"," At a least within it today, look up MN TV and listen into their last three guidances."
"3409490","3410850"," TV and piece something together. "
"3410990","3412950"," Maybe they've got something they're supposed to launch this year."
"3415710","3419890"," You know, you try to piece together some kind of a puzzle over the past year on them."
"3425560","3426980"," It's the one o'clock hour now. "
"3431490","3436850"," Markets should begin to slow down in anticipation of some news."
"3437150","3444730"," You might see some news break that we don't know about beforehand at some point."
"3445870","3447470"," I would expect more violent moves. "
"3448130","3458570"," This FOMC in"
"3458570","3465480"," particular, mostly to shake traders and investors out."
"3466680","3470080"," Because I'm looking at the, let me take a look at this real quick."
"3478590","3488750"," I'm going to go back to looking at"
"3488750","3491430"," the options chain on Friday's expiry. "
"3493910","3497390"," Two against the end Friday, the 28th."
"3499330","3500650"," That gives any guidance."
"3501810","3502330"," So on Friday,"
"3502370","3513110"," you've"
"3515380","3517720"," got the bears just disappeared on the put side. "
"3517980","3518800"," They were here a minute ago."
"3518920","3519880"," They're here like 10 minutes ago."
"3520460","3521140"," They're gone now. "
"3521340","3523140"," Looks like just retail is on 440p."
"3524260","3529760"," Looks like the agos removed their short side on Friday."
"3530140","3531680"," Unless there's something deeper that I don't see. "
"3541080","3543440"," I just saw some spoofing of some kind on Friday."
"3544440","3545440"," Those bears are all gone."
"3548200","3552640"," Foles are loaded up today at 450c for the 26th for Wednesday. "
"3553720","3554680"," Today expiry."
"3558840","3560340"," That'd be a huge move, right?"
"3561040","3561460"," 450."
"3566310","3569070"," I'm not seeing as many puts on the put side as I did earlier. "
"3569510","3571050"," There's still some bears on there at 430."
"3577620","3580400"," It'd be hilarious if we traded flat into the close today."
"3581160","3583360"," And then we traded it too. "
"3583520","3584940"," We actually picked it up for Friday."
"3584940","3586100"," It would be kind of hilarious."
"3586580","3590900"," I doubt that happens, but it'd be a funny trade. "
"3595840","3597320"," A little bit of capitulation is."
"3597420","3598660"," Looks like short covering of some kind."
"3599840","3601600"," Or day traders getting out of their trades. "
"3606320","3607440"," 440-36."
"3607860","3608420"," I think that's right."
"3608560","3609160"," We're open today. "
"3611520","3612860"," You can see right down here."
"3612920","3614260"," See the support level down below here."
"3615060","3615580"," 440-11. "
"3616960","3617640"," Wait a minute."
"3619080","3620060"," We'll look a little bit lower."
"3620540","3624200"," I'll bring up the Hero Indicator before you started and see that the Hero Indicator wasn't on. "
"3624700","3626900"," I'm trying to watch this as I'm talking to you guys out there."
"3627440","3628420"," I'll try to set this up."
"3629140","3631240"," I apologize for not having all the cool stuff on. "
"3636580","3638680"," Trying to watch it myself to see what happens."
"3640860","3641260"," Load."
"3642740","3644760"," The Hero Indicator on. "
"3646280","3646840"," Close it."

"3656660","3657100"," a look there."
"3659180","3678700"," It's like everybody's up here at 440 floating around right where"
"3678700","3679380"," we started the day. "
"3679800","3681760"," I'm going to try to come and take up just a few moments here."
"3682400","3689760"," I'm going to try to bring up the FOMC, the Fed website or the YouTube channel and play in the"
"3689760","3690880"," background so that I can hear it."
"3691520","3692520"," Whether I'm ready for it. "
"3693460","3700300"," Maybe I'll put some CNBC on first and listen to the garbage that comes out of their mouth."
"3701260","3702100"," Trade against it."
"3713550","3716050"," Whatever shit lies, CNBC is given today. "
"3718070","3722430"," It really sucks about CNBC because they could be really great."
"3750960","3755040"," Imagine if you had a real TV show that was a real thing."
"3755160","3757680"," I know that Fox Business News is not so bad. "
"3763910","3771210"," But if there was a really good real traders on there, real investors on there not trying to sell"
"3771210","3784130"," something constantly with motivation, if you knew you could get some pretty serious conversation"
"3784130","3787150"," that is good for down the road."
"3806030","3806930"," VIX is falling."
"3847580","3851860"," Should I think that Twitter and YouTube does a better job?"
"3852820","3856720"," I think Twitter, YouTube, even Wall Street bets to an extent does a better job. "
"3859220","3862280"," I think our investing does a better job than CNBC."
"3863240","3866520"," Like on Reddit, they have an investing, there's even a stock market subreddit."
"3867300","3868580"," I think you put combined all those. "
"3869040","3871000"," You get better information than you do from CNBC."
"3873320","3875280"," There's some good information in CNBC."
"3875720","3880260"," I've made trades off, some good trades off CNBC, but it's like a minefield. "
"3889850","3902920"," I'm going to get"
"3902920","3904060"," into the chat here in just a minute."

"4113590","4120970"," You will see the buyers move up here and you'll see this line disappear if you're getting bearish."
"4122450","4126050"," But if you see the stock moving up right here, you can see that the buyers are now stepping up. "
"4126649","4128930"," You'll see this nice thicker red line right here."
"4129250","4131930"," That's a little bit thicker than this thin red line above here."
"4133970","4138830"," If you see the stock start to fall, or if you see the ETF of the derivative of the spider,"
"4139490","4142950"," start to fall, you'll see this line disappear and we'll start trading down. "

"4163689","4165750"," Yep, and the VIX is showing this too right."
"4165890","4169290"," We're in some firm support right now on UVXY. "
"4170510","4177770"," Buyers are down below at $15.58, $14.50. Let's look above to see where the sellers are."
"4179649","4180770"," And here they go."
"4182109","4190170"," If you are a bear and you think we're going down, this is your price target on the UVXY, $22 "

"4200550","4211210"," If we start ripping higher, be careful below $14.35. Be careful below $15.30. You"
"4211210","4216450"," start to see the UVXY start to trade below this number and it becomes resistance."
"4216910","4219070"," You'll be expecting the VIX to sell off at that point."

"4347320","4348340"," They want your money."
"4350420","4353140"," They want you to invest, leave your money, and go home. "
"4354140","4358880"," Then they want you to call and let them have your money so they can trade it and skim off"
"4358880","4359240"," the top."
"4360180","4365200"," If you're still here, if you manage your own investments, if you manage your own future, and you've"
"4365200","4370680"," still made the cut at this point, and I feel many of you guys have ever been competitive in your"
"4370680","4370900"," life."
"4371680","4374400"," No matter what, it could be athletics, it could be education. "
"4376820","4378900"," It could be just something you're interested in."
"4378980","4384780"," If you're a bird watcher, you've gone down the bird watcher rabbit hole, and you've become very"
"4384780","4387320"," satisfied from something you've taken on in life."
"4390680","4394920"," If you're here doing this and you're successful right now at this point, or if you're least haven't"
"4394920","4399340"," had to take a job at Wendy's, or if you did take a job at Wendy's to fund your next"
"4399340","4401820"," adventure, then you're still going at it. "
"4403020","4404140"," Congratulations to you."
"4412680","4416940"," In my view, this is the best way to make a difference in your life."
"4421020","4426700"," If you want to make it the change, if you want to make more money than you've ever made in"
"4426700","4429860"," your profession, I think, I mean, this is one of the best things you could be. "
"4430840","4434600"," I'm forever grateful to have become an investor in a trader."
"4435380","4436680"," It's changed my entire life."
"4445320","4456280"," I had the bird watching rabbit hole still flat. "
"4456480","4459240"," It's been a harrowing experience for everybody out there."
"4461040","4463600"," Thanks to all of you guys for showing up here every day."
"4465340","4467260"," I know it's been tiring for all of us. "
"4467360","4473840"," You guys are tired trading, tired investing, tired doing your research, the market stress."
"4474580","4475860"," I've been running haggard."
"4478360","4482000"," On top of all this stuff that we're doing here in stream with you guys here and me, with you"
"4482000","4485740"," guys all day long, then I got to do all my own due diligence, then I got to deal with"
"4485740","4490400"," my family, my friends, and then all my normal stuff that I have to do, and then with the deal"
"4490400","4491460"," with this market the way it is. "
"4491880","4494680"," I've been left by Thursday and Friday, I'm destroyed."
"4496060","4496620"," I'm not going to lie."
"4496920","4500800"," Even when I'm making money, it's been tiring. "
"4505920","4512960"," Like weeks like this week, I think about the summer weeks when the market doesn't move, and we're"
"4512960","4514160"," nodding off in front of our computers."
"4515300","4518860"," Like Twitter, some guy will be talking on Twitter, and then he'll just disappear."
"4519980","4520920"," And I'm like, where did he go?"
"4521540","4523560"," And then he comes back and he goes, I'm sorry, I took a nap. "
"4524080","4529060"," I took the dogs for a walk and then passed out, ate a nice fat lunch, just chilling now."
"4530200","4531440"," Anything changed in the market?"
"4531560","4532400"," I'm just checking back in."
"4534060","4536180"," This past month has not been that for anybody. "
"4538320","4540740"," Bears have gotten a great win."
"4543340","4545520"," It's not easy being a bear, right?"
"4545680","4551540"," A bear has had two years of not too many wins."
"4552900","4554820"," To see the bears get a win is great. "
"4556760","4558120"," That doesn't mean they don't win today."
"4558400","4563260"," It just means you got to listen to them, but no one's listened to them for two straight years."
"4564680","4570700"," And so you want to start paying attention to them, and you start to find out what they've been"
"4570700","4572080"," talking about for two straight years. "
"4572820","4575980"," So I got to get some mad props to bears without a doubt."
"4585880","4588000"," Support's still down here at this 440 level."
"4588580","4590260"," It's basically where we open the day, right?"
"4590920","4590980"," 440. "
"4591720","4593000"," Shocker right back at it."
"4593740","4594940"," 440 for the decision."
"4596600","4598220"," Coming up in 40 minutes. "
"4598220","4600320"," So I'm going to leave this up here."
"4602500","4603880"," You guys are all awesome out there."
"4604340","4608700"," I love all of you guys out there. "
"4609520","4612980"," Every single one of you is all of you."
"4613540","4615700"," I love all of you out there."
"4615780","4616560"," I know that it gets stressful. "
"4617860","4619480"," I know that we lose our cool and our temper."
"4620200","4621200"," We are trading this."
"4622920","4623940"," Our money's on the line. "
"4624480","4625800"," I know that it's important to you."
"4626240","4627220"," So this is what I'm going to do."
"4627220","4628360"," I'm going to go upstairs. "
"4628500","4631080"," I haven't had a cocktail in a couple days."
"4631660","4633260"," So I'm going to make myself a whiskey."
"4633840","4637040"," I'm going to pour myself a fat bourbon. "
"4639300","4646620"," I feel like I deserve it at this point because this fucking market has rung me through a ringer."
"4647740","4648680"," It's past month."
"4649300","4656660"," This month has been nothing but feeling like I'm going to job right now. "
"4657180","4658820"," Now you guys, it's the market."
"4662160","4669620"," You know, panic in the nighttime, have dreams, night sweats, get dreams of them live streaming."
"4670540","4671140"," It's wild. "
"4671760","4676300"," Like this whole market this past month has been one for the books."
"4676980","4679620"," I think that will be one that we'll talk about in the summer time."
"4680180","4685040"," We'll come back to this moment and be like, do you remember March or January of 2022?"
"4686400","4691200"," Regardless of where we go today, I think we'll be like, do you remember how wild that ride was that"
"4691200","4691480"," month?"
"4694060","4695100"," Because it is. "
"4695640","4696680"," It's been a wild month."
"4700160","4701340"," No, you don't love me more."
"4701420","4701900"," I love you more. "
"4706700","4708820"," Look how my phone rings during market hours."
"4710720","4712800"," Yeah, it doesn't feel like it."
"4713060","4714480"," Yeah, I'm taking a cocktail today. "
"4718380","4719280"," It's not you guys."
"4719340","4719860"," It's the market."
"4720760","4725780"," The market has been, you know, like, what are you doing this market?"
"4726160","4732480"," I mean, this morning, I was looking at, I was talking to Joe Donut this morning and I'm looking at"
"4732480","4734080"," the moves this past month. "
"4735560","4742340"," And I'm like, I remember when we thought, I remember when bears were like, we're going to 450."
"4743640","4746380"," And that sounded so dangerous."
"4747100","4751900"," I remember going initially, I'm like, damn, that's deep 450. "
"4755280","4756940"," You know, we trade down to 420."
"4759720","4761720"," You know, insane, right?"
"4763060","4767420"," So, you know, just that stress is wild."
"4768260","4769820"," So we're looking at a test right here. "
"4770700","4771360"," It's 123."
"4772500","4773820"," Nice little test right here."
"4773880","4775240"," I'll take a little bit closer here. "
"4777500","4778540"," Nice little test."
"4781580","4785020"," My dad's I might add some some calls right here."
"4785020","4785720"," So hang tight. "
"4789140","4794920"," This is where I'm going to start to put on my look to be putting on me looking to put"
"4794920","4797980"," on some some calls in this area."
"4798360","4799540"," This is what I'm looking for right here."
"4800680","4802320"," I want to see this test down below. "
"4802800","4804960"," See if we get a nice little dip down below this 440."
"4806060","4809320"," And grab this call side with some zero dates."
"4831570","4835770"," Now I got to wait to get a whiskey because I want to grab, I want to grab some calls"
"4835770","4837090"," and grab both sides right here. "
"4837510","4839630"," I want to grab like a nice fat dip for some calls."
"4840490","4845470"," I'm looking for a quick rip to grab some puts and then I can ride a straddle here and see"
"4845470","4845870"," what happens."
"4846530","4848110"," Got some bears stepping in here. "
"4849170","4853350"," I'll retail small money to be expected."
"4854210","4859590"," I'm looking at this funny because I'm looking at bears buying 30,000 dollars, 80,000 dollars and"
"4859590","4863510"," puts right here, 60,000 dollars and puts right here."
"4863910","4868210"," And I'm looking to buy the call side while they're buying the put side down here. "
"4868210","4870930"," And I'm going to be looking to buy puts higher."
"4872870","4874490"," I always find this hilarious."
"4876030","4878130"," I'm always taking the opposite freaking trade. "
"4878630","4884230"," I got bears trying to buy puts on a decent level of support when they should be buying them higher."
"4885010","4887670"," And you know, you know, the bulls don't buy down here."
"4888230","4889510"," The bulls buy when we're higher. "
"4890210","4892810"," And the bears end up retail, at least generally not everybody."
"4893430","4896490"," But there's, you know, this isn't where I buy puts."
"4897350","4899650"," I look for puts above and I look for calls below. "
"4902210","4904350"," Never, never ceases to amaze me."
"4911510","4914370"," Never ceases, especially when the retail flow is coming in."
"4915090","4918710"," I'm like, okay, so I'm buying calls while you're buying puts right now specifically. "
"4921250","4926470"," And if we trade any higher, I'll buy some puts into the two o'clock hour."
"4927270","4928590"," Get a nice little range in there."
"4930430","4932130"," We can trade below this. "
"4932290","4935270"," I don't really care if I can get a nice position on calls down here anywhere."
"4935550","4940570"," If we trade down lower, if we swing finally, I'll cut both sides and then look for a direction"
"4940570","4942830"," after the meeting or during the meeting."
"4944590","4946250"," It's just hilarious to watch this. "
"4954300","4956040"," Yeah, this is how you straddle."
"4960100","4962660"," Yeah, I'm looking for calls down here like 440."
"4964660","4967160"," And I'll buy the 450 Cs. "
"4968680","4970260"," They were just really cheap for a minute."
"4970380","4971120"," They're like 30 cents."
"4972220","4973240"," Now up to 36 cents. "
"4974420","4982460"," And then I'm looking for if we trade back up to, let's say do a quick snap-ups like 443"
"4982460","4983240"," or so."
"4983240","4988840"," If we even get that high, maybe even for just 442, 17, I'll grab the put side."
"4989900","4991660"," We go back up there again at any point. "
"4993960","4996520"," Have a nice little fat range, a little bit of buffer on each side."
"4999400","5004180"," And if we, if we do swing violently up and down before we pick a direction, I'll cut one side"
"5004180","5006060"," loose on one side, one side loose on the other."
"5006800","5012240"," Or if it looks like, you know, if it looks like we're definitely going in one direction, I'll cut"
"5012240","5014000"," it one side loose and let the rest ride. "
"5014680","5019540"," You can also, if you do pick the right side, if you don't want to miss the ride, you cut"
"5019540","5022420"," one side loose, then you just roll more into your position."
"5024040","5027540"," Sometimes in that time frame, you'll also see the algos step in."
"5028220","5031340"," And the algos will decide where the interest will be. "
"5031860","5035400"," So let's say, let's say I'm on 450s and the algos buy 440."
"5035400","5038080"," And they don't buy 450s."
"5038140","5042580"," Then I can sell my 450s even if we're going up and just jump on the 440s, take the ride"
"5042580","5046160"," where the premium is, where the interest is, where I know they're going to pay. "
"5046900","5048280"," So I get all that stuff going on."
"5048960","5052900"," Lots of little things, lots of little things while you're day trading."
"5053220","5061120"," Very important details on timing, placement, following the money. "
"5065010","5071530"," That's one thing about traders, is that traders can change their position, their viewpoint, and the"
"5071530","5072610"," split second, right?"
"5073770","5079330"," If a trader sees something different, they can turn bullish in a dime."
"5079730","5081030"," I can turn bearish in a dime."
"5085800","5087260"," Otherwise, I'm going to get blown out. "
"5088120","5095520"," Like a bear that wants to trade against the market over three months has a different viewpoint than"
"5095520","5095820"," me."
"5096280","5099280"," If I don't change my viewpoint, I can get blown out today."
"5115540","5116500"," I'm going to go get a whiskey. "
"5116580","5117060"," I'll be right back."
"5117580","5118820"," I'm going to grab a glass of bourbon."
"5119440","5120780"," We need to toast this month. "
"5121320","5122580"," I don't care where we trade today."
"5123680","5127100"," I just want all of you to know that I've had wonderful time trading with all of you out there."
"5127940","5130240"," I look forward to investing with you this year. "
"5131620","5134720"," If we're going to take this market down, I look forward to taking it down with you."
"5135900","5137020"," But I'm going to have it bourbon."
"5137240","5141480"," I'm going to have a toast here to this whole entire month, because it wasn't easy. "
"5343670","5345590"," So, John asked to spin one up."
"5348390","5350270"," Your wife's boyfriend is going to be toasting a bowl."
"5353510","5363730"," Yeah, so back in the, when I was a young intern, inside"
"5363730","5369610"," of our building, there was an executive office bathroom in an area of the building that was under"
"5369610","5370070"," construction. "
"5372730","5378530"," Unused and it was an unused bathroom."
"5379710","5380630"," It was beautiful."
"5381670","5382310"," It had everything. "
"5383250","5384530"," And it wasn't being used."
"5384750","5386190"," It was like you had to walk down some hallways."
"5386570","5387890"," There was construction stuff up. "
"5389990","5397210"," And it was one of the highlights of my internship out of university, outside of college."
"5400670","5405930"," Yeah, I like the idea of put debit spreads for the old reach around."
"5409920","5411440"," I think we come back down here. "
"5411840","5414500"," One of the safest to put debit spread is probably in a march."
"5415780","5419800"," It'd be hilarious to see us trade all the way up and then trade all the way back down in"
"5419800","5419980"," March."
"5421260","5424140"," Have a put spread print like three months or two months from now. "
"5426900","5428500"," Get in the muddy put spread."
"5432240","5436280"," Joel's running oldfashioned.exe. Oh, yeah, baby."
"5436900","5437760"," I love old fashions. "
"5438440","5439820"," I should have made it an old fashioned."
"5440620","5441620"," I love old fashions."
"5442120","5443500"," I like old fashions with rye though. "
"5444200","5444920"," Sazerac rye."
"5445340","5447700"," I like the rye from high west too."
"5451720","5453380"," Everybody's placing their bets at this point. "
"5454120","5456340"," I'm going to stop with the with the flow right now."
"5456480","5457780"," GME's got some flow coming in."
"5458020","5459220"," I'll highlight that one. "
"5460220","5462600"," I'll give it I'll give it shares to the GME crowd."
"5463440","5464460"," We took that trade."
"5466840","5470120"," I was in that trade from the beginning. "
"5478890","5488230"," Back when Roaring Kitty was unknown, I remember I remember when nobody knew who Roaring Kitty was."
"5490190","5490670"," Nobody."
"5491050","5492990"," It was like only Wall Street better as knew who he was. "
"5494390","5496470"," And then I remember when he when he became famous."
"5497690","5498810"," It was freakin hilarious."
"5500710","5503850"," It's like there's this guy that nobody nobody knew who knew who he was. "
"5503850","5507210"," It was just bizarre to watch him become famous."
"5511260","5520160"," It was bizarre to watch it was bizarre to watch the trade in GME on Twitter because there's a few"
"5520160","5522700"," success suspected saboteur was in that trade."
"5522860","5524060"," He's a Twitter guy that I know. "
"5524520","5527640"," I don't know if any guys know that guy."
"5527840","5529640"," His name is suspected saboteur."
"5531040","5532080"," He's a Twitter handle. "
"5533580","5541320"," And it was bizarre to watch the growth of GME in social media."
"5545180","5553480"," It went from like just just ignorance, just normal ignorance to lots of negativity on social media."
"5553960","5555020"," This is before it got big. "
"5556340","5560160"," But as it started to become big, this before it was out even to like 25, 30 bucks."
"5562080","5563720"," There's lots of negativity came in."
"5564420","5565480"," Lots of snark. "
"5565780","5566900"," The snark was out of control."
"5568000","5571380"," Then like famous Twitter handles had huge snark."
"5572080","5577900"," And then over the course of a week, all of a sudden it was the biggest rage, ragingest thing. "
"5578380","5582060"," Then you're like the news organizations didn't know what the fuck was going on."
"5595880","5597000"," I used to watch him."
"5601830","5603010"," What are you guys reading here?"
"5604770","5608730"," Yes, I was there when Martin was there. "
"5609510","5612790"," Martin would stop in late night at 3, 4 o'clock in the morning."
"5615530","5618010"," I really do believe Elon posted there."
"5618890","5623470"," I remember believing the few posters were Elon back in the day. "
"5623990","5626570"," Believe it or not, Elon was in that sub back in the day."
"5626830","5627870"," That's not just a myth."
"5632700","5634560"," You'll hear myths about Wall Street bets. "
"5635820","5637800"," Or like you'll hear like rumors or whatever."
"5638140","5639700"," Or hey, is that Elon in late night chat?"
"5640120","5645000"," I did notice last night that Captain Tony Stark was back in Wall Street bets."
"5645100","5645920"," That was nice to see. "
"5646300","5649680"," I haven't seen him in a while and he was there last night I saw him."
"5652840","5659840"," Martin has been, there was a time two years ago, I think Martin was in jail and was in Wall"
"5659840","5660760"," Street bets one night."
"5661040","5662240"," This is like maybe two years ago. "
"5663020","5666100"," He was in jail and he was posting in Wall Street bets recently."
"5666660","5667620"," Well, that's kind of recent."
"5667820","5669120"," I don't know if he's been in there recent reasons. "
"5669360","5670940"," I haven't been in Wall Street bets active."
"5671680","5673660"," Like an active member in a couple of years now."
"5677160","5678660"," But yeah, Martin was in there. "
"5678660","5680660"," Martin was in there just two years ago when he was in jail."
"5681620","5682560"," He was posting."
"5684420","5687660"," Yeah, I know a suspected saboteur is Tesla Q."
"5688860","5690660"," But we've run across each other sometimes. "
"5697270","5698330"," Hey, big toddy."
"5700970","5702210"," I talked to Tesla Q."
"5702970","5703790"," I talked to everybody."
"5704510","5705390"," I talked to Bo's Bears. "
"5707250","5711760"," I talked to reasonable Tesla Q people."
"5721280","5722120"," Ooh, a gimlet."
"5724600","5728600"," One of my favorite gins. "
"5728800","5730540"," I can't remember the name of it, but it comes in this small bottle."
"5731100","5731880"," I'll have to find out what it is."
"5733700","5735300"," I'll send you a bottle of it, Chaz. "
"5739100","5741160"," Who else was in Wall Street bets?"
"5745420","5747400"," If Jamie goes full and he'll ask today."
"5748000","5748420"," Yeah."
"5750480","5753200"," Jameson and Ginger, orange bidders, and dirty cherries. "
"5753780","5755880"," Lucio is saying, yeah, I love those."
"5757480","5759000"," Not the martial arts cherries."
"5759060","5759400"," What do they call it?"
"5759500","5764060"," The ones that are inside of like the deep dark red cherries. "
"5764140","5767200"," They're inside of the the liqueur."
"5768140","5768780"," They're expensive."
"5769280","5770020"," There's two types. "
"5770200","5771800"," There's one that's kind of big and one that's really small."
"5772360","5773640"," The French ones I like a lot."
"5776020","5777040"," Jill's having a cosmo. "
"5777700","5778620"," Cheers to you, Jill."
"5779860","5781380"," Jill's saying, burn side, Ryeth."
"5781520","5782080"," Look that one up. "
"5782820","5783560"," Write that one down."
"5784760","5785520"," Cause I love a good Ry."
"5788620","5790660"," Hell yeah, I'm staying on for Tesla ER. "
"5791000","5791880"," I'll livestream that one."
"5792540","5796100"," I'm going to turn off the book map and we'll just livestream Tesla ER."
"5798840","5799580"," We'll do that. "
"5799820","5800640"," I'll do a special one."
"5800860","5803940"," Matter of fact, yeah, I'll get off at some point and we'll put on."
"5804220","5805360"," Yeah, rendezvous rye, baby. "
"5805660","5805940"," Love it."
"5806660","5807720"," Love rendezvous rye."
"5817830","5818950"," Been rocking a couple months. "
"5819130","5819690"," I agree, Matthew."
"5821150","5822530"," Basil, hey, nice to drink that."
"5829880","5831580"," Best trade ever was GME?"
"5836680","5837560"," Luxardo cherries. "
"5837560","5839120"," Vescuent knows what they are."
"5840620","5842460"," Luxardo's whiskey acres rye."
"5851000","5852500"," That soaked an ethical air. "
"5855620","5857980"," Yeah, I think Mila was in Wall Street Bets."
"5858960","5861140"," There were some real characters in Wall Street Bets."
"5861540","5867660"," There's some, uh, there are some, uh, I'm not going to name some names. "
"5868280","5870540"," There were some real wild shit in Wall Street Bets too."
"5870660","5875580"," Like some of the history of Wall Street Bets, there were like people like, there was one guy from"
"5875580","5880240"," South America that was running a scam out of Wall Street Bets."
"5880680","5882000"," Like, there's some wild shit. "
"5882160","5883820"," I used to be in Vegas Bets."
"5885280","5887280"," You guys probably know who Seder is."
"5887640","5891000"," He doesn't keep a huge Twitter presence anymore here and there. "
"5891820","5892940"," That guy's like legend."
"5898540","5899360"," Guys, legend."
"5904880","5906500"," Yeah, you guys want to do a Tesla livestream?"
"5906500","5907380"," We can do that. "
"5909180","5910120"," Ooh, Ginjina."
"5913140","5913580"," Ginjina."
"5917670","5919550"," That was like adding bottles to the collection. "
"5922190","5923450"," Yeah, I love a good old fashioned."
"5925570","5928490"," Yeah, there were insiders on there and there were scammers on there."
"5928630","5934210"," There was some straight up, there was some straight up scamming going on in Wall Street Bets back"
"5934210","5934670"," in the day. "
"5935410","5937310"," Uh, I knew who Wall Street Bets is."
"5938490","5946630"," I have actually used a handle based on Wall Street Bets God and I used to have the Reddit handle,"
"5948990","5949430"," WSBGAWD."
"5950810","5953050"," That was one of my handles, but that was mocking him. "
"5954010","5955810"," He can go fuck a stick, by the way."
"5959780","5961480"," That guy could eat a bag of dicks."
"5964460","5968860"," I think Wall Street Bets God, some people said he was, I'm not going to name who they thought he"
"5968860","5969040"," was. "
"5969380","5972400"," Because it's kind of a slight, because I don't think that they were that person."
"5972820","5977000"," I think it was that guy from South America, but I think he was Wall Street Bets God."
"5987410","5989010"," Yeah, I don't think it was the scammer mod. "
"5989210","5990370"," Yeah, no, he was the scammer mod."
"5990470","5992570"," He wasn't the owner though, or the fake owner."
"5994770","5999090"," There's a lot of, is it one of the founders of the sub?"
"6000110","6004670"," Or is it one of the mods that he was running a scam on the side?"
"6004670","6015980"," Oh, yeah, you got to, you got to drink it all fast and while you're watching, while"
"6015980","6017160"," you're watching what's going on. "
"6017600","6020460"," So I'm going to get ready to turn on the Fed channel here."
"6032140","6033900"," Do one of you guys have a direct?"
"6036140","6037960"," I think it's just the Federal Reserve, right?"
"6038360","6039260"," We're going to have to go to the Fed calendar."
"6041000","6043400"," I always forget if I have to go to the Fed calendar first. "
"6044220","6045020"," Oh, no, it's right here."
"6045140","6045800"," It's on right now."
"6048480","6051920"," So I'm on the direct Fed link that's on their YouTube channel. "
"6052400","6057700"," Let's see if I can get it faster than anywhere else."
"6058080","6060400"," There's only 1500 people watching it."
"6063760","6068560"," Do you guys want me to play the Fed and turn book map off, or do you guys want to"
"6068560","6072260"," see book map and just think a new play-by-play what they're talking about?"
"6075320","6076160"," Oh, that sucks. "
"6076340","6077440"," You got to pick up the boys from school."
"6079220","6080320"," And you're on meds."
"6080500","6084340"," Man, 16 minutes. "
"6087600","6092100"," If I had to choose a call, I put a gun to your head, which type of trade, which one"
"6092100","6092420"," would it be?"
"6094400","6095080"," You want to know the truth?"
"6099170","6100170"," You want to know the real truth?"
"6104320","6105380"," Who's asking that question?"
"6105900","6106520"," Put a gun to my head."
"6106640","6107300"," What's my trade today?"
"6109740","6111300"," I'll keep book map up, book map up."
"6115720","6117200"," You want to know my gun to the head trade?"
"6119620","6120400"," I'll tell you. "
"6121180","6121780"," You ready?"
"6127270","6127710"," Calls."
"6129150","6132550"," Load up on 450 calls expiring on the 26th."
"6133730","6140790"," And then what you do is you keep your finger on the button to buy more in case there's a"
"6140790","6141710"," quick dip below. "
"6142790","6144470"," So see, buy calls now, right?"
"6144910","6145990"," Then you set up."
"6146210","6147090"," Let's say you buy 100."
"6148130","6149390"," Calls on 450C. "
"6151130","6152870"," They cost 40 cents right now."
"6154830","6160630"," And then you load up another 100 calls with a finger ready to buy them."
"6161090","6162090"," In case we get a dip. "
"6163070","6165670"," Let's say they go from 40 cents to 10 cents."
"6166230","6167670"," Buy another rack at 10 cents."
"6171270","6172850"," You want to know where I think I'm going?"
"6173230","6173810"," I think we're going up. "
"6181210","6182210"," I think we're going up."
"6182530","6185070"," I don't think we hit 450 necessarily."
"6185950","6189130"," We could slam into like 444 and then come back down. "
"6190670","6191850"," You want to know my truth?"
"6192890","6193630"," I think we're going up."
"6195070","6196130"," So you know what you should do?"
"6196690","6197970"," You don't like Captain Jim James."
"6198310","6199150"," Take the inverse trade. "
"6203130","6203650"," That's right."
"6203690","6204610"," That's where I think we're going."
"6208250","6209990"," At this moment in time. "
"6213410","6214910"," I think we're rolling much higher."
"6218600","6220600"," I think we've shaken out all the ugly news."
"6222720","6224340"," I think we've had a cathartic moment. "
"6224760","6226560"," I do think we revisit the lows."
"6227020","6227960"," I don't know that it's today."
"6230280","6232100"," I think all the volatility rolls off. "
"6232800","6240080"," It's kind of like, you know, you come clean with a girlfriend and you say, well, I wasn't, I wasn't"
"6240080","6241060"," mowing the lawn yesterday."
"6241200","6243960"," I was out the boys playing golf or I was out playing frisbee."
"6244040","6247100"," You got a disc golf or, you know, whatever I was doing with my friends. "
"6247200","6247960"," That's what I think."
"6251880","6255620"," I think that, you know, the dirty laundry is going to be here today to a point, but I also"
"6255620","6257780"," think that they're not going to drop the market at this point."
"6265360","6269180"," Yeah, sell some calls. "
"6270240","6272000"," Just start selling for 60s."
"6272560","6273900"," I wouldn't sell for 50s."
"6277740","6281480"," My contrarian, no, the others would be the first time that I'm not contrarian. "
"6281960","6283620"," It's a good fair point, T-Crown."
"6285460","6291120"," I'm going against my own typical trade."
"6294160","6295320"," I love disc golf. "
"6298980","6300420"," I love disc golf."
"6300940","6307380"," If you've never tried disc golf, or if you think it's a nerd sport, I've had some very enjoyable"
"6307380","6308060"," experiences."
"6309500","6313940"," I have some friends that do it all the time and I never would have picked it up normally. "
"6314440","6318900"," But whenever my friends are out there doing it on a lazy Saturday or Sunday, or like a Wednesday"
"6318900","6324440"," morning, I can cut loose to go play some disc golf with people that play it all the time."
"6324580","6324840"," It's awesome."
"6325800","6326340"," Have a blast. "
"6337730","6339290"," Yeah, let us know how you guys are all positioned."
"6348580","6349760"," I want to know how you're all positioned."
"6355140","6362500"," I'm loaded up on Tesla, RK, so I got my feet in some IWM stuff, right?"
"6369520","6372280"," Got a pretty sizable position right now in Spy. "
"6388260","6389080"," Got your flat."
"6389780","6390620"," Test the call spreads."
"6391000","6391780"," Short puts like it. "
"6392740","6393680"," Holding my ankles."
"6394160","6394360"," Love it."
"6394620","6395060"," T-Q-Q. "
"6395300","6395940"," Please, right on."
"6396520","6398640"," I love listening to you guys what your positions are, too."
"6398720","6399260"," It's awesome sauce. "
"6399880","6401240"," Love you guys all have your own positions."
"6401740","6403480"," I love that they're not my positions."
"6404720","6405720"," You guys are awesome. "
"6407200","6408080"," Long and strong."
"6408520","6410240"," Popcorn wash and straddle to the yod."
"6410360","6411340"," Love that straddle, baby. "
"6411780","6412140"," I do."
"6415360","6419100"," Huddled in a corner with a bottle of rum wash and CNBC right on."
"6421320","6422820"," Like it calls with a put hedge. "
"6430840","6432040"," I am afraid of that."
"6432660","6436120"," I am afraid he's done a better job of not saying stupid shit."
"6444010","6446170"," I'm not always right, so don't follow me. "
"6449090","6452350"," 95% Tesla calls, 5% Tesla and Spy puts right on."
"6452750","6453210"," Nice little hedge."
"6453750","6454450"," Good job, Dimitri. "
"6462160","6463080"," Ooh, I like that."
"6463620","6464040"," Shipping calls."
"6465240","6466460"," I like that IWM to do that. "
"6466600","6467660"," IWM demonstrate, right?"
"6469080","6469580"," That I don't know."
"6469720","6470260"," I'm an M-trade."
"6470560","6472780"," Could be the crafty trade today. "
"6474000","6475100"," It really could."
"6475940","6484240"," And I'm telling you, if you like, I didn't think too much on it, but some IWM calls or some"
"6484240","6486360"," directed individual ticker calls."
"6488760","6497120"," If a small cab company has been beaten down since last March, let's say you get like last January. "
"6498860","6503260"," I'll tell you what, if a company comes out last year and from last year, let's say a company just"
"6503260","6509340"," got beaten down for a whole entire two years or one year, one full year, and they just come out"
"6509340","6516860"," smelling like roses, like we're making money, we've got our software out there, and we expect this"
"6516860","6520580"," and that next year, they're going to squeeze to the moon."
"6521820","6522760"," Any of these companies."
"6523340","6523980"," Here's another big one. "
"6524700","6531140"," If Snaps says something like, if Snaps says something like we have, oh, by the way, we've got a new"
"6531140","6534640"," revenue source, we're not relying upon Apple anymore, dude, that moon."
"6536320","6537040"," Snapple moon."
"6537980","6546080"," I like that trade, short UVXY. "
"6548940","6550620"," I love Angel Zenvy Brad."
"6553620","6556140"," I love that IV crush trade."
"6556400","6556980"," That's a great trade. "
"6558600","6560220"," That's another excellent one."
"6565410","6569470"," Does the initial market spike come from the agos reading the documents for keywords?"
"6571130","6572690"," No, I think it's more positioning."
"6577510","6579630"," Personally, so the yellow line is moving up. "
"6580570","6581910"," It's not going down."
"6582730","6587290"," I want you all to know that the support has moved up on the spy at this point."
"6587890","6590470"," There is a bid coming into the market on the spy currently. "
"6590970","6596110"," We are trading at 44.0.97, breaking above to 4,100."
"6596110","6605980"," 44.1.0. We are seeing buyers step in here"

"6607140","6608900"," We've got seven minutes left until 2 PM. "
"6610060","6612360"," You do see a large move coming up."
"6612500","6614140"," I am looking at my positions right now."
"6614420","6618400"," Everything is turning very green on my end over here. "
"6624680","6628700"," You are seeing the buyers make a move higher at this point."
"6629590","6634200"," They began at 1.51 PM."
"6648440","6651600"," This is an aggressive move up move higher at this moment. "
"6671900","6674050"," Light squeezing going on right now."

"6697750","6699610"," Watching a bid coming to ArcG."
"6710760","6713240"," Feeling all this stress coming off right now."
"6713600","6714880"," Someone was just talking about..."
"6716560","6717720"," Hold on, I look to see. "
"6717840","6719620"," I read something about crypto just a minute ago."
"6725930","6732550"," I saw a comment on the YouTube channel, but I also saw someone commenting on a small..."
"6732550","6734170"," Let me see what we are reading over here."
"6746160","6750480"," I'm reading some kind of talk or chatter over the web about crypto. "
"6755900","6763750"," Now up to 44.1. A little bit of panic as we move into this two o'clock hour."
"6764890","6766510"," A little bit of squeezing going on."
"6774100","6779220"," The moment the white sheets drop at 2 PM, we should know more. "
"6780740","6786360"," Call is coming in on NVIDIA January 28, 225C, $450,000."
"6791720","6795860"," There is a premium kick right now on the call side."
"6796360","6800720"," Is anybody out there experiencing a premium kick on the put side?"
"6801320","6803100"," Anybody can tell me out there that it's taking puts. "

"6886220","6889180"," A little bit of IWM flow for put side, but it's small."
"6889380","6890500"," It's like 70,000 bucks. "

"6907270","6909830"," Someone's buying the other side when we trade up like that."
"6910230","6913310"," So this looks, this does look like lots of straddles in the market. "
"6918680","6923180"," Let's see if we see more support firming up."
"6923380","6925100"," I want you to see this above here."
"6925560","6927880"," There's a lot of resistance above here. "
"6928460","6930740"," You can see it between here and 446."
"6932640","6933820"," There's a lot of pressure."
"6934500","6936740"," Bears do not want to lose this position here. "
"6936740","6941380"," If they do, it's going to squeeze to some very high."
"6942200","6948700"," If we don't squeeze above and we are rejected, if the Fed is super hawkish, something that we"
"6948700","6952020"," haven't priced in, you are going to be looking below to 422."
"6953040","6956460"," We've got some other marks at 434, 430. "
"6957680","6964580"," Some volatility down below here between 430, 425, but big support down below at 421."

"7046360","7048260"," And it does look like these sellers currently. "
"7048960","7050640"," That wall of us here is now gone."
"7052000","7057760"," You can see the break above here just wrecking sellers currently in the market."
"7058200","7060720"," We'll see if the buyers can break through at this moment. "
"7064480","7067040"," There are blue skies ahead here."

"7452040","7459500"," I am watching some put buyers step in."
"7459640","7459980"," Very small."
"7460300","7462080"," I saw some spy puts being bought. "
"7462640","7469180"," January 28, 440 P, my expectation is that that's a day trader trying to trade another swing down"
"7469180","7470560"," before a huge swing higher."
"7471340","7473640"," So be careful of the day traders out there."
"7475460","7479580"," Watching calls, puts them in cues as well. "
"7480120","7482840"," 126, 350 P, 80 grand."
"7483100","7484460"," This looks like day trader activity."
"7485100","7486540"," They might get blasted out here. "
"7486540","7493480"," Watching calls coming in hood February 4, 13.5 C for $84,000."
"7501480","7503200"," Remember where VWAP is?"
"7503300","7508940"," Remember there are some sellers hiding above between 444, 21, all the way above to 446."
"7509760","7515260"," Remember we talk about taking the trade up to resistance and then if it jumps above you grab it"
"7515260","7516380"," once more and ride it up. "
"7524320","7527140"," Wouldn't be shocked to see some day traders step in here."
"7527140","7530460"," Try to trade it down, grab a hedge position at this point."
"7535750","7540810"," Staying some UVXY puts come in January 28, 14.5 P."
"7544550","7546190"," This is very fast trading. "
"7546490","7554010"," So if you are a trader out there, if you don't normally day trade, sometimes it's better to just"
"7554010","7561030"," hold or it's better to hedge your position to account for a move higher at this point or even"
"7561030","7561390"," lower."
"7562310","7565970"," So the initial move up if you want to grab some puts to protect yourself."
"7570980","7573080"," Yeah, there's nothing unknown right now. "
"7574940","7577780"," Nothing about that statement so far is unknown."
"7579740","7584480"," And we are looking for something that's unknown from that fed statement."
"7616300","7617300"," Look at that. "
"7617780","7619620"," Look at that wall right here."
"7634540","7639800"," We're touching right now the simple moving average on a daily chart on the one minute."
"7640220","7641940"," We just broke through it slightly. "
"7644600","7649720"," Watching IWM puts walls coming through for April 14th, 190."
"7649940","7650980"," That's actually kind of bullish."
"7651840","7657740"," When you start to see our put hedges come out and they're not dated one week away, you're seeing"
"7657740","7658480"," them in April. "
"7659240","7663360"," Not in the next two weeks, the next month."
"7663860","7669220"," So you're seeing 414, 190 P for 4.4 million dollars."
"7669380","7671760"," It could for a moment impact the market. "
"7672260","7677020"," When you're seeing something like that that's placed three months out at this point, that is more"
"7677020","7677940"," of a bullish move."
"7678620","7683480"," That is not indicative of the IWM selling down from now into April."
"7688060","7690440"," So I'm going to be looking for another dip buy down here. "
"7702040","7705540"," I just loaded the boat a second time at 26 cents."
"7734380","7735420"," So I'm going to get it."
"7735540","7738880"," That was into the 80 cents got out back in at 26 cents. "
"7739120","7741380"," Now up to 30 cents on those calls."
"7745440","7746900"," Clear skies above here."
"7747060","7749300"," It looks like this doesn't look like what it looked like earlier. "
"7752180","7757840"," Remember again, you're looking at this resistance above at 4.46. If you are a bull, you can wait to"
"7757840","7762340"," take this long until you're above 4.46, 28."
"7764320","7770860"," If you're on the, you know, if you're, if you're, if you're fearful of this market trading down, if"
"7770860","7773600"," you can't blow up your account, you can always wait, right?"
"7773820","7776580"," If we break above 4.46, it should squeeze."
"7777280","7780320"," If we trade down from here, you're not for any kind of a loss out there. "
"7784180","7785360"," I'm going to add some more here."
"7787860","7788820"," Give me another buy."
"7789000","7790100"," Give me a 24 cents. "
"7790660","7791700"," Be 10 cent calls."
"7793420","7794480"," Give them to me."
"7831940","7832500"," Right. "
"7835460","7836920"," What a better price."
"7843230","7843790"," There."
"7848960","7850220"," Give me a fill, baby. "

"7903430","7904650"," time before they print. "
"7905150","7912210"," Just watch the bear step in and say, hell no, January 21, or excuse me, scratch that, January 31,"

"7973840","7990220"," 3, 2, 4, 38 on the market, 5, 10"

"8512850","8513470"," Show me that money."
"8514310","8515110"," Look at that green. "
"8515410","8516210"," I got lots of green."
"8517010","8518370"," All kinds of green."
"8519370","8520430"," Green, green. "
"8521530","8522410"," All kinds of green."
"8535010","8538230"," Moving on up to the top."
"8539050","8539650"," Moving on up. "
"8547760","8568160"," Moving on up all this"
"8568160","8569020"," ice here, right?"
"8569160","8576120"," As buyers and sellers battling right now, stay focused on these red lines, how thick and thin they"
"8576120","8576380"," are."
"8576800","8581120"," We are now sitting also on the VWAP here, flat on the VWAP."
"8581740","8584380"," You do have some sellers above at 443. "
"8585120","8590300"," If you are bullish at this moment because they've traded to the VWAP, your next price target above"
"8590300","8598100"," is going to be again that same spot, 444.65. If you are wanting to be a bull, but you"
"8598100","8603780"," don't want to take on the risk, you are going to wait for us to break above that 445.40."
"8604280","8606360"," Mess around a little bit and then rock it north."
"8632270","8635030"," We are breaking some heavy resistance here."
"8643830","8644810"," Oh yeah, baby. "
"8645010","8645770"," Make that shit print."
"8646790","8649390"," Somebody will hit that printer for me, that burr."
"8650070","8651590"," Someone want to give me some of that burr?"
"8654950","8658890"," Give me some of that burr right now. "
"8675970","8677450"," Someone give me some of that burr."
"8695490","8698630"," All I'm doing is scalping in here, making lots of money."
"8700290","8701970"," Buying low and selling high. "
"8707220","8708640"," Just scalping away."
"8711200","8715240"," Like a vampire coming in and just sucking all that money out of the market."
"8725560","8727440"," Give me some of that burr. "
"8731400","8732760"," Just scalping it."
"8735280","8737420"," I sold out of my calls just here."
"8737520","8738520"," I'm going to try to grab some more. "
"8739020","8741360"," I might miss this trade if we go up straight here."
"8742620","8747000"," We'll look for those calls to get down back down to that 13 cents marker, so I might not get"
"8747000","8748940"," that good of a deal this time."
"8749440","8756280"," Looks like we might bounce off of 440.36. This time we can grab one more grab on this trade. "
"8758060","8760480"," I'm going to load them up and be ready to buy them."
"8761080","8762440"," Just sitting here waiting."
"8763440","8764400"," Premium kick in. "
"8764480","8766120"," They're still sitting around 26 cents."
"8767040","8770300"," Just buying them at like 15 cents, so we can get a pullback a little bit."
"8774800","8776380"," Let's see if anyone's heavy. "
"8783990","8785410"," Give me 21 cents."
"8794290","8795930"," Come on, give me 21 cent calls."
"8823390","8825110"," Jay Powell is live right now. "

"8922960","8932320"," Thank you for selling me your calls at $0.18. Capitulate."
"8955790","8957470"," Give me your calls, sheep. "
"8958410","8960990"," Capitulate bulls, I'll buy them from you."
"8964770","8965730"," Capitulate bulls."
"8974230","8979130"," Give me your cheap calls, sell me them at $0.17. Oh, here we go. "
"8979490","8980550"," Almost, here we go."
"8981790","8983730"," Give me some capitulation calls."
"8990970","8992170"," Yes, yes. "
"8993950","8996170"," Yes, give me capitulation calls."
"9013390","9015430"," Yes, yes, sell me your cheap calls."
"9018120","9021240"," My Tesla calls are printing very heavy right now, just so"
"9021240","9029720"," you"
"9029720","9032000"," all know. "
"9042300","9045260"," Thank you, Tesla FOMO for paying for my calls today."
"9054460","9057460"," Yes, pulling a buy a whole bunch of 10 cents."
"9057460","9057520"," Yes. "
"9096300","9103480"," Yes."
"9111140","9140520"," Yes."
"9181340","9181880"," Yes. "
"9196600","9198100"," So the money flow keeps going until."
"9203700","9206520"," I missed some of that."
"9223600","9224640"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"9230980","9232100"," Show me that green."
"9235700","9236900"," Show me that green."
"9253710","9254670"," Yes, yes. "
"9254670","9254890"," Yes."
"9263430","9266630"," All right, this is where things get really good or really ugly."
"9274230","9278250"," He does well at this sometimes and then other times he doesn't do so well. "
"9278910","9281290"," But all the bad news is out right now, right?"
"9281950","9284890"," So basically the laundry is done."
"9285930","9289770"," Any bad news that you could have is done markets turning green."
"9289770","9291930"," Everything that I have is hella green. "
"9292430","9294810"," My Tesla calls are through the roof right now."
"9295650","9296770"," Absolutely through the roof."
"9298510","9300130"," I'm green across the board here. "
"9329220","9330980"," Calls are ripping right now."
"9331380","9332580"," Cross the board for me."
"9332740","9334940"," All my calls are super hella green. "
"9339990","9344970"," Tesla's blasting off in my I don't know what you guys own here, but I'm super green."
"9377500","9381940"," So for all that hard bluster about being bearish."
"9381940","9384920"," Jay Pao saying that he hasn't made any decisions yet. "
"9385520","9393800"," They still have not fucking turned the money off mind blowing mind blowing to hear that statement"
"9393800","9394820"," from a reporter."
"9396280","9399340"," Literally have not cut the flow off yet."
"9399920","9401680"," I don't care where we trade today. "
"9402680","9405940"," I took that as we haven't done shit."
"9406040","9410160"," Well, they have done shit, but they have not cut it off yet."
"9410860","9413080"," The cocaine is not turned off. "
"9413340","9416780"," We could trade down from here, but I do want you to be quite aware of that."
"9417200","9419980"," I'm taking when he's saying he hasn't made any decisions yet."
"9420280","9426460"," You are still looking for them to make a hard decision publicly and they did not do that today. "
"9439770","9441970"," Again, we're talking about talking about."
"9442070","9443510"," We have plans for March."
"9457940","9459860"," See, this is where the fraud comes in. "
"9460460","9461820"," Listen to him talk right now."
"9461920","9463040"," This is where the fraud comes in."
"9466860","9468880"," You want to see where the fraud comes in?"
"9483820","9513800"," That's"
"9513800","9513800"," where it is. "
"9543120","9543160"," Okay."
"9572900","9573020"," All right."
"9573020","9573040"," All right. "
"9573060","9573120"," All right."
"9573320","9573440"," All right."
"9573440","9573460"," All right. "
"9573460","9573520"," All right."
"9577640","9580420"," I'm about to buy another rack of calls here in just a moment."
"9598310","9599930"," I do want to be clear with you. "
"9600110","9600290"," Hold on."
"9600470","9602190"," It looks like all these puts are gone again too."
"9603930","9604630"," Let's see. "
"9610500","9613480"," This is where the fraud comes in."
"9623280","9623760"," Okay."
"9624020","9628460"," So, uh, traders or algos are moving to 450 C."
"9629520","9632360"," Expiring on January 28th. "
"9633460","9635120"," You can look a little bit farther out."
"9637440","9639440"," There are some puts down at four."
"9639860","9640100"," Oh, nope. "
"9640240","9640940"," They're gone now too."
"9641900","9643100"," Oh, let's put some gone."
"9651230","9653570"," Well, the spoofing is real right now. "
"9654930","9660350"," Keep your eye on 450 C on January 28th on Friday."
"9661610","9668770"," There is one point to make that there's usually a if we rip higher or lower."
"9668770","9675010"," There's usually a wash of value in options at some point. "
"9675330","9678250"," There's the thank you for playing moments that the dealers do."
"9678630","9682770"," They will wash out one side at some point, even if we move higher."
"9685170","9688750"," So if you're day trading this and you're thinking, yeah, I'm going to hold this through to the next"
"9688750","9690210"," week or so. "
"9690810","9695110"," Uh, there can be a wash for both sides at some point in the market."
"9705910","9710950"," Four thirty five oh five looks like a area of support on the spy."
"9713050","9715870"," I still have not reloaded Bob calls that here. "
"9740390","9746190"," I am watching Tesla closely because it is sitting on a support."
"9746730","9749010"," Tesla ZR is a little bit different than the spy."
"9749430","9753270"," You want to see if Tesla breaks below this trading area here. "
"9753850","9758470"," They're sitting on their daily SMA, which is right at."
"9761380","9762780"," Nine fifty nine."
"9763060","9765780"," There can be a quick capitulation moment and a ride higher. "
"9766740","9769020"," But pay attention to this on Tesla here."
"9771440","9774820"," This is the support for Tesla heading into ER."
"9807700","9816360"," I did pick up some calls at this point for Friday down at sixty five cents on the spy four"
"9816360","9817200"," fifty C."
"9818900","9820500"," Very dangerous trade. "
"9820500","9829160"," The implication right now is that everyone's getting quite bearish on how Jay power is speaking."
"9831780","9835420"," So I would warn you that it's a trade that you'll probably lose some money on."
"9838420","9840120"," It's kind of a diamond handed trade. "
"9843400","9848820"," This is a typical action that takes place in the FOMC meeting."
"9849020","9854020"," You'll see the first statement be quite neutral and then you see the questions come out."
"9854800","9858880"," And these questions are sometimes stabbing. "
"9859480","9860220"," They should be."
"9860640","9864160"," But oftentimes they are intended to drop the market."
"9864400","9865380"," So just be careful here. "
"9865380","9868360"," If you are bearish in the market right now."
"9868680","9870460"," There are a lot of spy puts coming in."
"9870700","9877000"," We've got spy one twenty eight four forty P for six hundred and seventy seven thousand dollars spy"
"9877000","9879320"," one twenty six four thirty seven P."
"9880240","9886160"," Spy one twenty eight two seventy seven or excuse me spy one twenty eight four thirty eight P."
"9886800","9890100"," Spy January thirty first four thirty six P."
"9890100","9894360"," Again spy four thirty three P for January twenty six. "
"9894580","9898660"," All this is small money all retail traders except for one."
"9899180","9901360"," There's a January twenty eight that I talked about earlier."
"9901720","9905260"," It's four forty P for six hundred seventy seven thousand dollars. "
"9910990","9913110"," Now just be careful here watching the flow."
"9913490","9915290"," It can be misleading to a point."
"9916550","9919190"," Some of it can be directional just for the moment. "
"9919790","9921450"," People trying to protect themselves."
"9924070","9927210"," Keep an eye on the VIX Tesla specifically."
"9927890","9934210"," Because if Tesla does break real support then that could be negative for the market right. "
"9934970","9937870"," That that ER does not matter at this point how they report."
"9953870","9954950"," Be nimble."
"9968090","9971890"," If you are looking for a target below if you are bearish on this. "
"9972510","9977910"," You ought to be looking concerned about this area down below this yellow at four thirty three."
"9980650","9982910"," If you think there is a sell the market."
"9984370","9988850"," Anything below four thirty I'll take it a four twenty five four twenty six four twenty seven. "
"9988850","9993810"," You start to encounter turbulence and then down below it's data four twenty."
"9996110","9997910"," Four twenty one four twenty."
"10003900","10007680"," This is not a regular trading day do you want to warn you of that. "
"10024270","10028650"," When you see drops like this you'll see that first bit of we're holding on."
"10029210","10031690"," And there's one more bit of capitulation down."
"10032290","10037350"," This is a FOMC so you can't rely upon this typical trading in the spy. "
"10037590","10038910"," So just be conscience of that."
"10047410","10049710"," You can see Jay Powell is all sweaty about it."
"10055720","10059320"," Like if you're if you're looking at a one minute chart in the spy just be conscience. "
"10060400","10064140"," That's an a normal trading day if I saw this right here I would say it's going down."
"10064620","10066580"," I'm not saying we're not going down I'm just saying that."
"10067580","10071840"," On FOMC it'll reverse immediately sometimes in both directions. "
"10071840","10076340"," We trade higher let's say four forty six looks like it's going to go higher trades down."
"10077200","10079240"," Same things happening right now in the spy."
"10080880","10088160"," You guys got my calls right I bought the four fifty C's for the twenty eighth January twenty"
"10088160","10088480"," eighth. "
"10088860","10090620"," There is some recovery right now."
"10103020","10106760"," I'm still holding anything that's dated far out all my Tesla shit."
"10107260","10110080"," But the day trading F these on spy are doing very well. "
"10137160","10141400"," You know the bears are really looking for a hard stance from the FOMC."
"10141620","10142920"," Why don't you guys know that that."
"10146740","10150060"," I want you guys to take a moment here to talk to you guys even if we trade down. "
"10150140","10156340"," I want you to realize that the what you're looking for out of the FOMC is a foot being put"
"10156340","10156700"," down."
"10157120","10162660"," So he did drop some negative news to start off the con for the presser."
"10162660","10167340"," But in reality he's saying he's open to letting the money still flow. "
"10167740","10169000"," So it's still waffling."
"10170350","10175240"," It's still not the definitive answer that you're looking for."
"10177380","10184380"," If you're bearish like uber bearish sell the market like sell down to three ninety. "
"10184380","10189900"," You really do need more oomph from him."
"10190540","10193700"," So I would take what he said today as neutral so far."
"10195520","10198540"," And I don't like that he hasn't put his foot down. "
"10199600","10201220"," That opens the doors."
"10203020","10207920"," To not see to not see a foot be put down because you heard him say originally we're going to"
"10207920","10208580"," cut QT."
"10208920","10212960"," And then they ask him if he's going to cut QT as well we haven't done it yet. "
"10215200","10217760"," Right we haven't really cut the money flow yet."
"10218060","10219420"," We've opened the drain plug."
"10220580","10224120"," And he's like well we're going to cut the cute though we're going to cut the money flow though. "
"10224480","10226160"," Well when we haven't yet."
"10226740","10227960"," Well do you have a date?"
"10228300","10232040"," No you know we might need to keep it running still."
"10232920","10233960"," We'll know more in March. "
"10234880","10236020"," When you hear stuff like that."
"10236920","10238480"," It's not definitive."
"10239140","10243100"," It's it's not thinking about thinking about but it's still talking about talking about. "
"10243320","10245600"," No matter what anybody tells you out there that's what it is."
"10246080","10249660"," You need to hear or read read between the lines that they're speaking."
"10250600","10252260"," And he's left a lot open. "
"10253660","10256600"," So if you have a sell the world mentality."
"10257960","10260880"," Unless someone pumps a different story on media."
"10261480","10264440"," Unless you're reading something maybe from the Wall Street Journal or on Twitter. "
"10265240","10268860"," This conversation from him is not to me."
"10269680","10272180"," The sell the market conversation."
"10274060","10280060"," And I mean like sell it down like we're going to see lower lows then you know we're going to"
"10280060","10280500"," sell everything. "
"10284280","10285540"," Yeah he's evading."
"10286340","10292080"," Any of you guys disagree with that I welcome that conversation right now because are you guys"
"10292080","10293560"," hearing something different than I'm hearing."
"10298050","10303270"," I mean I'm going to be honest with you 100% honest even if we sell down. "
"10304510","10307270"," Do you guys hear anything that sounds like sell the market."
"10314110","10315850"," They did this crap and took down discord."
"10318130","10318770"," What's that. "
"10318770","10324110"," I can't I'm not seeing everything you guys are talking about."
"10324470","10328430"," But it's wild right now to see this conversation he's having right now."
"10335740","10338160"," Yeah it shows gross and competent competence. "
"10338960","10340860"," He always gets nervous these conversations."
"10342460","10350220"," The shit that's wild to me is that you know if you're looking for some fucking responsibility right"
"10350220","10351100"," now there's none."
"10351100","10356800"," I think they do. "
"10359420","10360300"," Let's be honest."
"10360580","10361340"," Vicks can pump."
"10361720","10363160"," We can sell this market down. "
"10365580","10366940"," The discord is down."
"10367120","10367900"," Why is the discord down."
"10377780","10378980"," It's really fucked up. "
"10379080","10380080"," I mean I'm going to be honest with you."
"10380440","10383340"," Okay well just so Captain Ron saying bearish bearish bearish right."
"10383340","10384520"," So let's be honest. "
"10385940","10386780"," Let's be honest."
"10387440","10388480"," Let's be honest here."
"10388900","10391200"," We have to trade with what we're really hearing. "
"10391680","10394500"," There's two things we need to know okay I want you guys to know two things."
"10395380","10401260"," The media can twist what he's saying in any way and he's shaping it anyway they want."
"10402120","10402280"," Right. "
"10402520","10406440"," It's just like JB Diamond saying we want seven rates right."
"10407340","10410600"," Did Jay power nine seven rates no."
"10416550","10421270"," That's probably just discord across the board but like my key point to is this. "
"10422170","10427890"," Did we get seven rates no did we get anything that we don't know no did he get more uber"
"10427890","10429570"," bearish fuck no."
"10430310","10435130"," He's leaving the door open across the board now even if we get weak let's say this opens up bus"
"10435130","10436130"," retesting down below."
"10436130","10439650"," It's not it's still not three it's still not selling the market. "
"10440950","10446830"," Unless the media changes their viewpoint on this it's not I'm sorry unless you got because I can"
"10446830","10447790"," get bearish in a minute."
"10448690","10453190"," And I'm not saying we are bearish but you definitely fucking not selling the market on that"
"10453190","10453530"," statement."
"10453890","10459210"," That sounded like some bullshit waffling to me if there ever was some same shit as before. "
"10474920","10478220"," Yeah you see that shit chaz I mean that's just fucking ridiculous."
"10481020","10484760"," Looks like we're having a maybe a DDOS across the country right now right."
"10485180","10488040"," I was having some real problems with the internet this morning. "
"10497490","10501850"," Yeah Robert makes a good point right now this is the most bullish he can be unless he fucks up"
"10501850","10502230"," somewhere."
"10502230","10511950"," I can't I don't know I do what you guys to see this okay be conscious of this."
"10512450","10522170"," We've got VXX calls coming in February 4th 24 C 1.4 million dollars. "
"10525230","10530250"," So I want you guys to be conscious right now I think it's all of discord I don't think it's"
"10530250","10531070"," just our discord."
"10533650","10539650"," There's probably attacks across discords right now for financials what are we doing."
"10549910","10553330"," The statements are great for today bad for structure of the market. "
"10553730","10558530"," Yeah I don't know about this statement you know what I'm going to tell you is this is that you're"
"10558530","10560010"," going to have to see."
"10560470","10563230"," You're going to have to see how it's spun by the media."
"10565170","10566890"," Because they're going to get paid by the banks. "
"10567570","10573830"," The only thing I can tell you is that he came out neutral with slight leave hawkish."
"10574930","10578830"," But then once they started asking the hard questions he folded and was like fuck that."
"10579390","10580790"," We can spend money whatever we want. "
"10581810","10583430"," And no the money supply is not off."
"10584010","10585210"," You know we don't really care about the plug."
"10586190","10587970"," They can drain money from the market all they want. "
"10588810","10592790"," They can pull the plug out of the drain all they want but until that faucet is turned off."
"10594270","10598150"," Until they say we turned the faucet off the money the money's still flowing."
"10599010","10602550"," So I might have missed something in that speech so far. "
"10607010","10610490"," Yeah it looks though it looks like we're having disruptions that are just brief."
"10611230","10617550"," I had two disruptions earlier today that were very brief like milliseconds on the internet and then"
"10617550","10618970"," it finally dropped the signal here."
"10619350","10622130"," I actually had a Comcast come out to the house earlier. "
"10624790","10626150"," So this isn't bullish."
"10626610","10627270"," I'll give them that."
"10627830","10634270"," But at the same time it's not to sell the market's bearishness that you're looking for. "
"10634710","10636450"," It's not the droids that you're looking for."
"10637290","10639490"," You know it's more fucking scam and fraud."
"10640670","10641550"," That's what it is. "
"10641950","10643110"," It's more fucking scam and fraud."
"10643870","10648250"," I did like originally he said we'll use our tools to fight inflation."
"10649450","10655450"," That implies that they're going to stop buying corporate back bonds implies they're going to raise"
"10655450","10656550"," rates and that kind of stuff. "
"10657590","10662150"," But then under questioning he says you know we haven't done any of this shit yet and we're open to"
"10662150","10662610"," continue."
"10663310","10664330"," So do I see."
"10665810","10669190"," Four oh nine right now maybe I don't know. "
"10672670","10675270"," I'm going to say no I'm going to say we have a bottom of the market."
"10676230","10677950"," And then we trade it up into March."
"10681790","10687010"," So I see spy one thirty one four thirty C excuse me four thirty P."
"10688110","10689990"," The bearish bet two twenty five. "
"10691750","10692890"," See a light."
"10693290","10697250"," A light bull calls coming in but not enough to say anything."
"10698730","10700910"," Seeing bears get more aggressive here. "
"10701510","10706650"," I will warn you I'm not going to warn you if you are a bear and you're listening into this"
"10706650","10706990"," broadcast."
"10710110","10715470"," I would for me personally you don't have to take my advice but this is what I'm going to tell"
"10715470","10715670"," you."
"10716990","10722810"," I'm probably going to scale back my four oh nine four eighteen target I'll go I'll go here with"
"10722810","10722990"," you. "
"10723110","10725270"," I'll go to four twenty two another retest."
"10725790","10729850"," If there was no retest a retest or lower than the retest."
"10730450","10731350"," I'm going to go neutral. "
"10732390","10733510"," I'm going to go neutral."
"10735430","10740370"," I'm going to go like four twenty possible you'll be lucky if you get four twenty maybe four thirty."
"10740370","10749250"," But I don't think that you get the let's sell the entire market down below to three ninety at this"
"10749250","10749610"," point. "
"10757730","10764950"," I don't think that that's the I don't think that the trade is down to anything less than a retest"
"10764950","10767150"," of the low to see if we're heading higher or lower."
"10778020","10780060"," I am a little disappointed in Jay Pough."
"10780540","10783560"," I will say like as outside of the trader hat. "
"10784040","10789200"," When I'm looking for are you going to correct the market am I going to get tested out of seven"
"10789200","10789640"," fifty."
"10790120","10795000"," I'm going to get Apple data like one thirty one fifty that's off the table for me today."
"10795580","10797000"," No I don't think we're getting that today. "
"10797700","10801980"," Maybe we have to wait until March and it'd be crazy to because they could they could they could"
"10801980","10803900"," pull this shit out into June July."
"10804440","10806660"," And if they drag this shit out into June July."
"10808160","10810480"," It's going to suck it's going to suck as a bull. "
"10811160","10812700"," It's going to suck as a bear."
"10813980","10817400"," Because you want the market to correct properly both sides."
"10817620","10821040"," I think there are lots of bulls out there that want to see Tesla seven fifty. "
"10821740","10822940"," So they can buy with confidence."
"10823440","10825040"," I think you want to see bears get paid."
"10826140","10829000"," And this lines up more with sideways trading. "
"10829000","10834780"," For me at least into March and maybe even June July."
"10835600","10840520"," I have to think about this and see what how it's portrayed by the media because the media can have"
"10840520","10841020"," influence."
"10842320","10844240"," Over where they want the market to go. "
"10847400","10848100"," I'm not."
"10854520","10856260"," Yeah I wanted to be more firm."
"10864900","10867140"," So we'll look closely here and see if this breaks. "
"10877080","10879460"," I'm trying to listen to the same time I'm talking to you."
"10884000","10889720"," Watching Shopify puts come in March 18th seven fifty P."
"10894080","10900120"," There's that number we were talking about right Shopify direct attack at one of the."
"10901680","10909120"," Companies that holds up our economy Shopify March 18th seven fifty P."
"10909660","10911680"," Two hundred thousand dollars small bet. "
"10912160","10917740"," But again that would be where the weakness is in the market if you see a Shopify fall."
"10918140","10919280"," See an Amazon fall."
"10919780","10920940"," See an Apple fall. "
"10925170","10929350"," So four thirty right we see support down here for thirty."
"10929650","10936610"," You don't want to be specific traders that get super bearish and say oh well I took it down to"
"10936610","10937150"," four thirty."
"10937150","10942270"," And I held and I watched my puts get ground to ship and then I didn't pick it back up"
"10942270","10943410"," below four thirty. "
"10943730","10946350"," So just keep that in mind as we keep talking right now."
"10946950","10948850"," Watching some more spy puts come in."
"10949150","10951890"," The one thing I got to tell you about these spy puts is it's not hedging. "
"10952410","10954650"," I'm not seeing any hedging on the market."
"10955310","10957810"," I'm not seeing any hey we're going down to four away again."
"10958610","10959990"," Let's double down on those puts. "
"10961150","10962830"," Not seeing any of that right now."
"10964850","10969070"," And I think that talks to the fraud and the scam that Jay Pao and the Fed is."
"10973140","10975860"," And he's saying that right now we haven't made these decisions. "
"10997970","10999210"," I'm listening to him right now."
"11006490","11008990"," It's getting a little bit more bearish right now it's good to hear him say this."
"11021760","11026300"," He sounds a lot like the bank estimates for this year. "
"11028640","11031680"," A lot of what he's saying right now sounds a lot like what the banks are saying."
"11032460","11033300"," Let's knock it down."
"11033520","11035880"," Let's write it back up for like nine percent in the year. "
"11037100","11039120"," Almost like he's got to play a textbook play."
"11092630","11093290"," All right."
"11093650","11095070"," So as we end this conversation. "
"11095390","11095910"," I want you to realize."
"11096170","11098730"," That the pressure on the market may come off."
"11099510","11102170"," Notice how we're down at support at four thirty. "
"11102450","11104070"," Notice that the questions."
"11106910","11108350"," Still have more questions my bad."
"11110990","11115650"," So pay attention to when the question and answering session ends. "
"11116370","11119090"," And where we are on support levels."
"11122670","11126010"," If there's a certain trader out there."
"11127690","11129750"," I'm not going to name names. "
"11136830","11140330"," You must take profit and reenter."
"11163410","11164690"," I'm not going to do that."
"11165390","11167470"," Watching more puts come in. "
"11169270","11169950"," Apple."
"11171210","11172790"," Apple might be a nice trade."
"11173530","11174870"," He did mention earlier. "
"11174870","11180230"," I do want to mention that he did say that they would stop buying corporate debt."
"11181530","11183750"," And then start buying securities."
"11184690","11185530"," I am watching. "
"11185950","11188750"," This is a big one worth taking note of."
"11189210","11192330"," Now we're starting to see some big trades against the market."
"11192850","11196770"," IWM February 18th 193 P."
"11197850","11202170"," IWM 218 P 1.3 million dollars. "
"11202940","11205350"," The rest of it's still small except for Apple."
"11206010","11207150"," There are some active traders."
"11207430","11209310"," They probably trading against Apple. "
"11209730","11213350"," There was a comment that he made earlier that he was going to stop buying corporate debt."
"11213930","11216550"," And that they would start buying treasury securities."
"11217510","11219090"," That is important to note. "
"11245090","11247700"," It was a rate hike higher than 25 BPS."
"11275100","11279960"," Jay Pao is saying that he expects the supply chain to issues to extend further."
"11300390","11303650"," We have semi persistent issues with shortages on semis. "
"11315690","11318170"," Lots of puts coming in an IWM."
"11319270","11323310"," We now have 1.2.2 million dollars."
"11323710","11330390"," The implication would be that small companies, mid-sized companies cannot get supplies. "
"11330390","11332890"," He did talk about car companies."
"11333250","11335870"," Ford just took a million dollar hit."
"11337170","11341750"," February 25th 18.5 based on what the Fed Chair just said. "
"11342550","11344570"," To expect more shortages."
"11348450","11351450"," Should see some fear in Ford at this point."
"11352490","11359710"," They targeted that the journalist targeted specifically car companies. "
"11360390","11367390"," It was a great deal."
"11383770","11387370"," This next journalist is like, can I weave some of this shit together and get a definitive answer?"
"11388490","11390150"," Can I pin you down for a minute?"
"11422840","11425770"," The VIX is cruising up towards that 3298 level."
"11435080","11436160"," I'm going to turn this down. "
"11436260","11437300"," I'm going to talk to you guys about something."
"11442120","11443880"," Be conscious here as we go."
"11443940","11447020"," We're going to go closer to on the VIX 3154. "
"11449600","11452700"," It just popped up to 3154."
"11461620","11465840"," Pay attention to the journalists when they're asking questions."
"11466900","11468760"," If the VIX continues higher here. "
"11469140","11471180"," Or if the VIX starts to recede."
"11490000","11490980"," What's going on?"
"11495340","11497220"," I'm having some weird shit happen."
"11502720","11513100"," Star bounced on Shopify at 8.50. 3.07. One, two,"
"11513560","11513980"," and three. "
"11514860","11518340"," If you look at Shopify, we did see some huge bets against Shopify."
"11518780","11520620"," Huge bets against IWM."
"11522740","11524760"," I don't know if these are day trades. "
"11525060","11528100"," If you do look at a five day chart on Shopify, it is interesting to see."
"11528100","11530020"," One, two yesterday."
"11530920","11535760"," Nice deep bounce here this afternoon on Shopify. "
"11536220","11539820"," If you are bullish, this would be an indication that we trade higher here."
"11540400","11546080"," But if there is a capitulation moment, there are bears saying, nope, we're selling this down to 7 "
"11546080","11555700",".50. The implication on Shopify would be that you've got parts and goods and supply chain"
"11555700","11560280"," shortages to small and mid-sized merchants that use Shopify possibly."
"11560820","11566860"," You would see some companies fold during this time period due to shortages being expected to carry"
"11566860","11568580"," on past 2022. "
"11568960","11570120"," Excuse me, 2022."
"11575840","11579120"," I would be paying attention right now on the news."
"11579760","11587200"," If they're highlighting the negativity of the Fed right now, or if they're highlighting the"
"11587200","11588300"," positivity of the Fed. "
"11592500","11595340"," As the Chair is being very evasive right now."
"11612750","11616650"," I don't know if you M looks like it's about to fall off a cliff."
"11617470","11621870"," Now we're watching junk bond puts, this is not healthy for the market. "
"11621870","11624590"," You don't want to see junk bond puts."
"11625110","11629410"," Very small bet though, February 18th, J and K."
"11631390","11634430"," 105 P, $52,000."

"12159310","12159310"," from that."
"12159310","12166610"," from flip-flop flip floppy to more bearish or hawkish with just a little bit of hey we're gonna try"
"12166610","12174110"," to save the market but he was firm in saying that they are switching right that they are going to"
"12174110","12180270"," apply these things so maybe or for a minute there I was saying yeah we're fine I still don't think"
"12180270","12186190"," it's all the market but it is more bearish than I anticipated halfway through the presentation"
"12186190","12192370"," today I was taking his neutral then when he was first questioned I was like hey he's flip-flop and"
"12192370","12199170"," then right towards the end he did get kind of hawkish and that was good to hear from Jay Pouts"
"12199170","12206050"," more hawkish than he's been the only issue that I still have with this the only thing is that it"
"12206050","12213030"," still says it signifies a bottom still I really want him to just say fuck it we're done you know"
"12213030","12219010"," we're done with money that's all I want to hear it be a breath of fresh air from the Fed"
"12219010","12227790"," and we're still not getting that so I think I'm gonna run up some more calls on Tesla into the"
"12227790","12235350"," close and see if we can get these to print it's 327 we've got half an hour maybe we can"
"12235350","12243220"," make this trade work at least to recover to 964 950 I'm gonna call it at 950 not even look"
"12243220","12249420"," at the chart I can if we can get this tag here at 950 on Tesla it's giving it a"
"12249420","12256540"," little bit of a recovery here you notice that as the FOMC question and answers ends the market is"
"12256540","12266080"," lifted away from the volatility of the news conference I think the key here is going to be to look"
"12266080","12273120"," towards media but I'm not talking like business insider you want to see what their take on this is"
"12273120","12280040"," because he's still flip-floppy I mean if he's flip-floppy slightly negative that's my take at this"
"12280040","12286000"," point and I'm grateful for the reporters putting him to the iron because he did come out today and"
"12286000","12294580"," try to be not hawkish he wasn't trying to be dovish or hawkish and they did hold him to the"
"12294580","12301920"," iron which I'm appreciative and to be honest what I really want is not hawkish or or or dovish just"
"12301920","12307080"," want to be honest I'm gonna say look this is what we're doing and of course he's not doing that"
"12307080","12313520"," he's just slightly leaning towards hawkish I don't know how to explain that"
"12313520","12323420"," yeah the buyers are buying here there's a bottom here for sure I gave a note to I gave"
"12323420","12332960"," a note to some traders out there that though I'm giving blush flow that there should be a"
"12332960","12341160"," rejection or a bounce on some kind of support so be aware of that it must be time and market"
"12341160","12349960"," that you don't realize that so we'll just give that I think I also said take profit at some point"
"12350600","12354940"," so you can't blame me at that point I just call it be a new the new to the market"
"12354940","12363340"," I don't think I think we might get that test of 422 maybe I don't think that we see a"
"12363340","12369420"," sell the markets event I have to digest this for a day I don't think that it's I don't think"
"12369420","12374520"," that it's what you wanted to hear if you were a bear you wanted to hear more definitive did you"
"12374520","12382060"," guys hear about any kind of rate hikes did you guys hear like the JB diamond ship I didn't hear"
"12382060","12389360"," that I heard flip floppy I heard that we're on the same track that we were going to be on"
"12389360","12396260"," we priced in three to five rate hikes so it's not like he said we're going to become more"
"12396260","12401880"," aggressive he's reaffirming the aggressiveness that he's had so this is what I'm gonna my takeaway"
"12401880","12411800"," is we can see a retest this 428 could have been the retest hold on here looking"
"12420860","12430550"," to buy some more here there's a shit ton of bears on 430"
"12430550","12440530"," p at 60 cents literally no bulls are buying anything on the"
"12440530","12449350"," call side it's kind of funny everyone's super duper bearish right now just heads up"
"12449350","12461420"," super duper bearish everyone is ultra bear right now might buy"
"12461420","12470080"," some of these four ultra bearish just a warning to you if you're saying that we're getting this"
"12470080","12477920"," bounce right now I want you to know in the clothes that everybody in their sister has turned bear"
"12477920","12485960"," suit so even though we're climbing back right here we're at 432.99 that every single player in the"
"12485960","12495340"," market is uber bearish what I play over all of retail right now is like sell it all"
"12495340","12505020"," get it sold I don't know about that I can't give an answer currently definitively what that means"
"12505020","12510900"," I'm really looking for is this just a momentarily where we're bearish right now you've got some"
"12510900","12515860"," maybe like a business insider comes out and tells you they're hella bearish we trade down we retest"
"12515860","12520000"," the lows and then all of a sudden GPM comes out and says oh yeah by the way we're gonna"
"12520000","12524660"," take this market higher so you have to real this is when I do trade the news you want to"
"12524660","12534300"," see what narrative they're trying to sell to you be conscious of that into the close I would"
"12534300","12543120"," say that it has most certainly dashed the hopes of bulls that we're going to trade all-time highs I"
"12543120","12547960"," don't think you can give the bulls hey we're trading all time highs I don't think you can give the"
"12547960","12555360"," bears we're trading we're gonna go to the depths of hell I don't see 360 with that statement I"
"12555360","12561760"," think bears are lucky if they get a retest of 420 and this should be grateful that they get a"
"12561760","12568940"," retest if we get a retest of 420 I think we're grateful I think the news will probably be probably"
"12568940","12577220"," be bearish until we hit 420 and then you'll see a move higher that's my take"
"12577220","12586570"," see move down retest 420 and if the news all of a sudden turns if you get like a JPM"
"12586570","12594290"," Morgan comes out and tells you it's not that bad a change or tune then you'll see people saying"
"12594290","12598810"," well they were so bearish to the day and now they're so bullish why is that that'll be the"
"12598810","12606050"," confirmation that you need that we go north again I would expect that we also trade sideways to"
"12606050","12615870"," down overall from now into March hopefully it could possibly take into June if the Fed fucks"
"12615870","12622110"," around with their statements if they fuck around their statements you can see a sideways market all"
"12622110","12635310"," the way into the year which is kind of fucked up if you're"
"12635310","12642970"," uber super-duper bearish your price target to retest lows is 421 85 there is support here at 430"
"12642970","12652770"," although I think the bulls hopes are dashed I think you'll see you know you like you go to the"
"12652770","12658370"," party the party doesn't happen and then you see bulls say well fuck it then I got to reposition"
"12658370","12664410"," myself and I'm gonna wait for 420 I think you do see that at some point some form of capitulation"
"12664410","12673470"," by bulls I do not think though it's ultra bearish I'm not I'm not as bearish as I was looking"
"12673470","12678930"," for lower like 390 a tough call for me to say that it's gonna go to 390 at this point"
"12678930","12688710"," tough call because I'm looking for Jerome to be ultra bear not ultra bear but to be"
"12688710","12696610"," definitive and he was very evasive still again more fraud from the Fed no matter how you cut it"
"12696610","12700970"," slice and dice it if a bear is gonna go out there and tell you that that was uber bearish"
"12700970","12708910"," fuck no it wasn't it wasn't bullish but it wasn't bear it wasn't ultra bear the only the only ultra"
"12708910","12717490"," bearish thing I would give it was the shortage part because there is the anticipation that it's not"
"12717490","12723410"," good the rates are going up for speculative growth companies but it's really damaging to small and"
"12723410","12730830"," mid-cap companies that rely upon parts and goods it's bearish for Ford you know that Apple or not"
"12730830","12737830"," Apple you know that Tesla was able to work around shortages but for a company like Ford a Ford"
"12737830","12746090"," can't work around shortages Ford's got lots lots full of trucks that aren't moving because they"
"12746090","12752370"," don't chips they've got trucks are putting out right now with no chips in them right you then"
"12752370","12758310"," you've got if there's a trade maybe it's in the used car market maybe you'll you're longing use"
"12758310","12764350"," cars if you were selling a used car at home they basically just told you fuck you you're not"
"12764350","12770690"," getting any new cars for more than a year well that was from Jay Pausmouth at least right at the"
"12770690","12776270"," moment so that would be an interesting trade to take a look at the used car right I don't know"
"12776270","12781730"," what cars is doing right now but I would assume that it's ripping if it's not it'd be worth looking"
"12781730","12793100"," at to rip once the implication is made I think it's cars right cars calm yeah I"
"12793100","12797260"," would tell you know you look at take a look at cars I think it's car there's a couple of"
"12797260","12801740"," them maybe not just cars but I would take I would most certainly take a look at any used car"
"12801740","12808600"," come use car dealers out there because there was the implication that shortages will persist and"
"12808600","12815140"," the that is a change from previously that shortages would not persist so if you're a bull I'd be"
"12815140","12822480"," looking towards a trade in companies that will thrive from shortages I'm gonna throat loss and"
"12822480","12827340"," share we're looking towards a trade and you might have to wait for the banks to pick it up first"
"12827340","12833820"," they're kind of fucking slowing these things but if you do see shortages as a bull helping some"
"12833820","12841340"," company especially like anything used in the used market I mean that just says car prices are going"
"12841340","12846840"," up right there right only anything says car prices are going more than Jerome Powell you know the"
"12846840","12852840"," leader of the free system saying yeah fuck you you're not getting your truck this year from Ford"
"12852840","12861500"," with it with a chip in it expect more shortages and vehicles next year even if Tesla's working"
"12861500","12869220"," through it that's gonna make used cars go through the fucking roof they're already through the roof"
"12869220","12877220"," I would identify used car companies out there publicly traded used car companies and that's a new"
"12877220","12887180"," trade they just traded down cars too really a car has been traded down because at $19 you"
"12887180","12893260"," might see a move down briefly in cars again down to like $12 or $13 so the banks can get"

"13020910","13028070"," volume kick on cars if that trade comes around because that wasn't our good news that was very bad"
"13028070","13034130"," that was one of the keys that I keyed into was shortages are critical they're critical to our"
"13034130","13043490"," economy moving forward it's one of the pieces to inflation people could ask for higher pricing"
"13043490","13047870"," you are seeing a bit on cars right now to into the clothes so we're gonna tell us some stuff"
"13047870","13053170"," what does this mean right the general overall thing first of all they're gonna they're gonna wipe"
