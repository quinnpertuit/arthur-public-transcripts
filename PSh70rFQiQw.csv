"240440","242460"," Now we get some stuff to go over today as well."
"244180","249800"," In a second here, I'll get this a little pissy."
"249820","253140"," I have to call my broker today. "
"254100","255540"," I was having problems."
"255860","258220"," This isn't the first time I've had problems with brokers in the past."
"258800","260740"," I had some problems with my broker yesterday. "
"261960","263000"," We can see down here."
"264280","266800"," So selling right off the bell this morning."
"269900","271740"," We'll start with that right there. "
"275230","277550"," And a pretty big gap down here."
"278090","279590"," A whole lot of space."
"280150","280870"," There's another. "
"281290","284950"," One percent after reporting a decline deposit last week."
"286090","287450"," That one right there."
"287890","289010"," Another H line right there. "
"290710","293710"," Doing the creepy crawly down the wall here."
"293850","297450"," There should be a confirmation trade here."
"298190","301930"," At some point, whether we tag this one right here, then come back up. "
"302650","304750"," Or even onto this one right here to make our way lower."
"305710","306610"," At some point."
"306830","310210"," So if you weren't able to jump on that right off the bell, I did make a post on Twitter"
"310210","312530"," to sell the open STO. "
"314490","316690"," So if you're able to jump on that train."
"318450","318970"," Congratulations."
"321110","324490"," It was pretty clear as day that we'd be selling this open. "
"330970","334330"," Bring a little bit more up in here and see what else was down there."
"336590","338110"," This looks like the."
"342950","349350"," This looks like that previous low earlier in the day yesterday is this yellow line. "
"351190","352330"," Take a look at that one there."
"353150","357740"," A little pissed off of my broker."
"357980","359060"," This isn't the first time it's happened. "
"359380","361200"," It was out on vacation a couple times."
"361420","362800"," Normally it happens when I'm on vacation."
"365160","366520"," I'll place trades. "
"367340","371140"," Some go through some don't usually it's not in my favor."
"372220","373380"," When they go through."
"376400","379340"," Almost always or I try to like close the trade. "
"379400","380740"," Typically it's what I'm trying to close the trade."
"380780","384080"," I'll have issues never on the opening trade never had an issue."
"384260","390280"," Well, I've had an issue in opening trades trying to chase, but never like mechanical issues. "
"390280","392240"," So I just I didn't notice it till this morning."
"392900","397020"," So I'm a little pissed off right now like open the day already angry as fuck."
"397260","401480"," I'm trading pools after sinking 29% of the open here. "
"403280","403800"," So."
"406080","411240"," Just on this open right here if you were here yesterday when I was charting."
"412080","413100"," With the day. "
"413100","419060"," I found it very rare I find it very rare when we chart so."
"420040","424920"," When I'm setting the levels every day that they're that close we made a note of it multiple times"
"424920","425260"," yesterday."
"427520","432820"," That we had that the that the that the pivot points were a super tight range right. "
"433340","435060"," We're going to talk about that today."
"435260","437580"," It's implication down the road."
"441100","444300"," And what that can mean and specifically to today. "
"444340","445600"," I just want you to see this here."
"446240","450100"," So today we have some pretty decent range expansion."
"451840","454980"," S3 is down at 403 72. "
"455640","458060"," And our three is 420."
"459360","461520"," 99 dish somewhere up there."
"461580","463280"," So that's a pretty big spread for today. "
"463380","465760"," Whereas yesterday we were super compressed right."
"466620","469800"," And then today you're seeing that the expansion in range."
"470440","472640"," I almost titled this range expansion. "
"473940","477420"," This video today range expand or range compression and expansion."
"478580","483260"," Yesterday we had compression range and say we have compression or expansion in range."
"483900","485780"," And what does it mean for us. "
"487820","493820"," We know that the market's been coiling as well and the other thing and price does matter like"
"493820","494500"," people want to know."
"494500","496080"," Even yesterday's moves."
"496080","497600"," We didn't get the price moves right. "
"497820","498540"," We're looking for."
"507100","507960"," So if so."
"508120","508540"," Theta gang. "
"509000","512700"," If I was theta gang I'd be like yeah we're out when closing out amount of here."
"513960","519460"," If we start to get range expansion theta gang does not rule in that kind of a market right."
"519620","522900"," The price matters to theta gang. "
"523840","525580"," Your daily trigger is down here."
"525580","527060"," I want you to see where that is."
"527240","530140"," It was this morning at four oh nine thirty six. "
"531300","534840"," We opened on a three trigger clear bearish cluster."
"535720","536480"," Right here."
"537220","539500"," We have a crossover happening in the five. "
"539560","540500"," This is the five minute chart."
"540600","541600"," We had a crossover happening."
"542800","545500"," On the twenty seven and one thirteen EMA. "
"546420","551280"," And it before before I mean after I posted this we broke right through that early and we're heading"
"551280","551640"," lower."
"552280","554420"," So we do have some targets down below."
"554640","557340"," The first target is this four ten eight nineteen. "
"557740","558900"," In the two east tensions."
"559240","559740"," Just repeat that."
"559860","563540"," That's hop button eight meets with Chinese counterparts in the two east tensions. "
"564660","569660"," Then we have four oh nine thirty six on the daily trigger here and I'm going to bring up another"
"569660","570940"," trigger for you below."
"572180","577600"," Because I do think this daily trigger has the potential to I do think this daily trigger has the"
"577600","578680"," potential to break."
"580480","583000"," Now depending on where we are and we come into it. "
"583120","586780"," We'll talk about that right now so you guys are aware of it as we come if we come into"
"586780","587020"," it."
"587420","589800"," What does it mean what to expect that kind of stuff."
"591580","596900"," How you can predict if if a if a if a level will hold or not is important right. "
"597020","600480"," It's not an easy thing to divine when you're a trader out there."
"601720","605620"," When you're a trader out there you like well I know this is S1 and S2."
"605660","607240"," I know where the triggers are. "
"608400","610300"," So that's like a second second."
"611620","614360"," You like I know where the I know where the levels are every day."
"614400","615540"," I know where the pivots are right. "
"615620","619360"," I know where the pre market highs and lows are."
"619500","623920"," I know where previous lows are that aren't a part of the calculation for pivots."
"624240","626200"," I know where the gaps are and all the stuff. "
"627460","629500"," We're also trying to divine."
"630600","632100"," You know we could bounce somewhere."
"639380","649120"," You know come up slightly and then continue lower right. "
"649320","652000"," That's velocity to the downside is velocity waning."
"652900","655680"," Are you bouncing and trading sideways then make the drop."
"656120","659100"," Do we just blast right through a level and you're like why did we do that. "
"659940","661560"," Do we do we just tipper."
"661920","662080"," Do we do we just keep relations from getting worse."
"662080","665120"," Dipper head through it and then rip face up again. "
"666720","668160"," It was important yesterday."
"668260","669920"," We're getting down there yesterday."
"670420","672940"," It's important there are people in chat and stream yesterday. "
"673580","678060"," They were like we're going to crash and you know I get that I get that sentiment."
"678060","685400"," I understand that sentiment and in truth it was a it was a time to close your shorts and close"
"685400","686020"," your puts."
"687460","689940"," For a move and a leg higher right. "
"690820","697340"," So you could have gotten torched yesterday if you weren't thinking about wrapping it up for a move"
"697340","698120"," higher right."
"700880","704100"," And so we're looking at that again today down here right."
"704300","707480"," So down here you kind of like well does the same thing happen. "
"707720","709620"," If we get down here does the same thing happen."
"710000","713080"," Does this just bounce or consolidate then leg down."
"713700","715080"," Does it blast straight through. "
"715080","717460"," Does it sit here come directly through."
"717860","722240"," Does it blast higher because of all compression right."
"727260","733160"," These are all not easy things to to well people will tell you they and people publicly will tell"
"733160","733420"," you. "
"733680","737780"," I'm really I was I was long here and I was short there right it was like perfection."
"738820","742800"," And it's always after the fact it's never before right when we're in the thick of it."
"744100","749860"," We're we're in the thick of something you the the easiest way to figure out that most people don't"
"749860","750480"," know this shit. "
"750780","752260"," Is in a chat stream."
"753100","755800"," Because you can see people in a chat stream that are like."
"756640","758600"," We're gonna fucking settle the depths of hell. "
"758640","759500"," You're like."
"760440","761220"," You're like."
"762300","766000"," That's why most people post on fin to it after. "
"766820","769500"," Never before because you look like a rock star."
"769500","772580"," You can come out and be like I close my I close my shorts."
"772680","773520"," I look great. "
"774500","777140"," But in the in real time it's not that easy."
"777620","780900"," That's why ninety seven percent of traders blow up their accounts."
"781600","783280"," That's why seventy percent of traders. "
"783620","786160"," But not blow up but you like not ninety seven percent of people."
"787180","792120"," Well and you like fifty and sixty percent never become winning traders even when they blow up"
"792120","793180"," accounts like a lot of traders."
"793460","795240"," Well I blew up accounts for years. "
"795940","796960"," I was very common."
"796960","798000"," Now I separate accounts."
"798100","800280"," We talk about that all the time right separating accounts. "
"801020","804640"," You have to have at least one plan that makes consistent money no matter what."
"806720","808800"," They have to be easy not complicated."
"809780","811140"," Then you have your day trading account. "
"811420","812400"," You got your stock buying account."
"812600","813980"," You got your whatever account you got."
"814360","818880"," You got money in a savings account a money market account retirement account 401k account. "
"819400","820140"," Spread it all out."
"820240","821140"," You put some money into houses."
"821860","823080"," Put some money in some commercial property. "
"823080","823880"," Whatever it is you do."
"825120","826480"," So that you don't lose it right."
"827180","828720"," Low risk make money. "
"830900","834780"," So you can come around and fuck around on a day trade with me right."
"835640","837520"," Or hang out with me and stream that kind of stuff."
"837800","842420"," So you know if we get down here this daily trigger. "
"844700","847620"," You want to know you want to know is it going to break."
"848140","849220"," Is it not going to break."
"853130","854010"," That's cash car. "
"854150","856450"," He says I'm not convinced we are at the max employment."
"857730","858990"," So his inflation is too high."
"860730","863630"," So we're only going to what I think about this area down here right now. "
"863710","864470"," We're going to talk about it."
"870320","872540"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"873080","878740"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick. "
"879100","883820"," So we already know right."
"883820","886560"," That we have algorithmic trading."
"887140","892000"," We already know that these aren't humans that are trading this market. "
"892220","894000"," We know that you and I trade it as humans."
"895680","901180"," But we know that the market that moves is moved from computers."
"902500","906160"," We know that they're trained to do certain things. "
"906980","909260"," Disney was a prime example yesterday."
"911240","916140"," Disney after hours went up and tagged that one oh three one oh four perfectly."
"917520","918820"," It was so fast. "
"919660","921020"," It went straight up right."
"921840","925360"," And these these algorithms are able to sell that number as well."
"925640","926360"," That was the target. "
"926840","928500"," Disney doesn't typically go up."
"929140","930900"," Twenty percent on an ER."
"931620","933380"," It hit its upper target briefly. "
"933820","936580"," And then it was just the moment to grab liquidity to sell Disney."
"937580","941100"," And as a human you can't go you're not going to you're going to be left behind."
"941100","942520"," They're not going to fill your orders. "
"943660","946700"," You're going to get trapped in that that Disney play if you're long."
"946700","951360"," You're not going to be able to trigger that sell and be like I got out of dollar three or"
"951360","953780"," whatever it was and then I shorted it."
"953980","956120"," Those are those are hedge funds in computers. "
"957000","957860"," They're doing that."
"957980","960460"," But there's some things we can't gleam from these algorithms."
"961440","963600"," And typically when we're on this show. "
"963600","966500"," It's more embedded rates will need to stay higher for longer."
"967240","970360"," When we were on the show who just said we have to stay high."
"972540","973800"," Cass Curry goes. "
"974660","977220"," I'm not convinced we are at max employment."
"978120","979200"," Cass Curry."
"979960","983000"," We're going to talk about this stuff in a minute. "
"984260","990100"," We can glean is that these algorithms will trade to pivot points right."
"990800","991920"," They'll tag a pivot point."
"991920","993060"," They'll tag a pivot point. "
"993260","994260"," They'll tag a pivot point."
"994960","996140"," Tag a pivot point."
"996660","996920"," Right. "
"997080","1000420"," Come back to a point of control and that kind of stuff."
"1000780","1001940"," Every day we put this pivot."
"1002140","1003720"," Every day we put this pivot here. "
"1006480","1006960"," Right."
"1008520","1013100"," And then we know that it seeks out these algorithms will seek out buyers or excuse me."
"1013360","1015680"," Sellers and buyers up and down. "
"1016740","1022340"," We know that if one level is weaker on the downside will go down to seek out more buyers."
"1022340","1022800"," Right."
"1023119","1027359"," We'll go higher if we can break through the number of sellers supply on the upside. "
"1027660","1029280"," That sometimes will break through it."
"1029359","1029420"," Right."
"1029560","1031940"," And then keep going higher until we can fill all of those orders. "
"1032920","1034200"," So we look towards."
"1036450","1037670"," We look towards."
"1037670","1038710"," I got to hear my. "
"1040930","1041950"," We look towards."
"1043530","1046250"," We look towards these pivots."
"1047369","1049430"," These h lines that we talk about. "
"1049470","1051750"," These gaps that we talk about all the time."
"1052650","1054450"," As a places of interest right."
"1056150","1057730"," It's been kind of gleaned that. "
"1060790","1061650"," Think tighter."
"1062250","1066170"," I'm now on the more hawkish end of the fed policy spectrum."
"1066590","1067990"," Yes, Kerry, dude. "
"1073090","1075150"," This shit throwing shit on the wall."
"1077940","1082660"," So this here is a swing trader chart, basically."
"1085300","1089860"," Is this swing trader chart is a 30 minute chart on the spy. "
"1092120","1095620"," And we briefly discussed this chart yesterday."
"1103670","1105950"," And kind of what I'm looking for here, right?"
"1106110","1106650"," You can see."
"1113170","1113730"," Right. "
"1113890","1115030"," Here's a good example, right?"
"1119520","1123200"," You can see this daily velocity is getting toppy in here, right?"
"1125100","1127700"," Start rolling it over, start coming down."
"1128160","1131140"," And we start to break this zero line right here."
"1131980","1133180"," And we break through. "
"1134780","1136480"," It's kind of an important thing, right?"
"1139020","1142520"," We had a small squeeze up and started going down again, right?"
"1144420","1145880"," Failed breakout, right?"
"1146440","1148260"," And then we start blasting down some more."
"1149360","1152640"," And we're in this, like, max bearishness down here."
"1154920","1157540"," It starts to signal start buying a dip. "
"1158400","1159680"," Check mark by a dip."
"1161560","1164600"," And we started getting some max bullishness over here."
"1165280","1166280"," Start to see it, right?"
"1166600","1167780"," Max bullishness over here. "
"1169380","1171840"," And I'm looking for, we bounced here, right?"
"1172060","1172280"," Bounced."
"1172740","1173100"," Bounced."
"1173480","1173980"," Why are we bouncing?"
"1174240","1174760"," Why are we bouncing?"
"1175020","1176580"," Why are we breaking through and getting new lows?"
"1176580","1178400"," Price matters, all that stuff. "
"1178980","1184080"," And we're going back down right now to check that daily again, that daily trigger."
"1184540","1186840"," The daily trigger's coming back up one more time."
"1187700","1189500"," You know, we're back at this daily trigger. "
"1190380","1191600"," And the bears want blood."
"1192140","1193400"," They don't want to."
"1195820","1196780"," Hold on here. "
"1200640","1203620"," They don't want to bounce through here and bounce back up."
"1204400","1206820"," These bears, dude, they want blood."
"1207140","1207940"," They want 407. "
"1208560","1209920"," They want 398, 396."
"1210780","1211340"," It was 395."
"1213980","1215940"," Now it's going up there, right?"
"1216620","1217360"," Time matters. "
"1220660","1223640"," So the question becomes, can we get underneath there?"
"1225740","1227140"," And we're kind of getting there."
"1228600","1234860"," This daily velocity is kind of getting down to bearishness now."
"1235580","1244020"," If this was Max bullishness, and the zero line is neutral, and the zero line is neutral, will kind"
"1244020","1246880"," of get to that point where we could roll the market over. "
"1251270","1258410"," And there's a second thing that I'm looking for here too, is not just the daily breakdown here,"
"1258470","1258930"," right?"
"1259050","1259650"," This is daily velocity."
"1260230","1262450"," I'm also looking at the hourly velocity down here."
"1263730","1265350"," And I want to know where it is. "
"1267130","1269450"," Is it like right here where it can break through?"
"1269710","1271970"," Or is it way down here, right?"
"1272130","1281920"," Like this green number down here, I'd really like to see when we're going"
"1281920","1286980"," down to test the daily trigger."
"1287680","1293320"," I'd really like to see this over here in the upside, and kind of coming down."
"1298440","1305360"," So that we start to slip underneath so that the hourly is helping to break through the daily"
"1305360","1306980"," velocity on the trigger at least. "
"1307900","1317320"," I don't want to be down on the testing the daily velocity when we're already down here, like Max"
"1317320","1318680"," bearishness on the hourly."
"1319920","1321500"," To make sense, I want to be on the upside."
"1322980","1324900"," To break through that daily trigger. "
"1328340","1330600"," We're going down there right now to test it, right?"
"1330780","1331440"," We're going down there."
"1331540","1334580"," We're not on Max bearishness on the hourly right now, are we?"
"1334640","1335120"," Wow."
"1335400","1341340"," So when you discussed Russia's war against Ukraine, the cross straight and other issues. "
"1341900","1345120"," So right now we're heading down here to test it, right?"
"1345900","1348420"," Coming down here to test this daily trigger."
"1349940","1352180"," And I want to see if we're going to break through it."
"1354480","1362820"," So as long as the hourly velocity is not at the bottom Max bearishness, as long as the daily"
"1362820","1369280"," trigger is not at Max bearishness, if it was at Max bearishness on both, I'd be like fuck yeah man,"
"1369280","1370680"," we're going to buy the fuck out of that dip. "
"1374100","1375820"," If not, we're going to be looking lower."
"1376260","1380740"," So in 10 minutes time now, the FDIC board of directors is scheduled to meet."
"1380920","1385140"," We did hear earlier that they were to make an announcement on deposit insurance fund today. "
"1385480","1389060"," So whether this meeting is correlated with that, we're unsure, but we will get the video out just"
"1389060","1389460"," in case."
"1393240","1396200"," So there is this daily trigger right here."
"1398060","1399820"," The next target below. "
"1400220","1406620"," Once this period of high inflation ends, that will be back in low inflation and the low rate"
"1406620","1407080"," environment."
"1408540","1410640"," Right down here where this green box is."
"1411980","1414700"," See if I can get rid of it and tag it for the. "
"1417300","1419660"," This next box is right down here."
"1419800","1421260"," It's 40256."
"1427750","1429190"," Actually, there it is right there. "
"1429230","1429530"," Hang tight."
"1431350","1432490"," Same weekly trigger."
"1434510","1435810"," Been sitting here. "
"1439480","1441380"," Just waiting for us."
"1444880","1446340"," Wait down there."
"1446460","1447600"," Does it mean this happens today?"
"1448820","1449700"," I doubt it. "
"1449940","1452600"," Does it mean that we get down there all the way down there today?"
"1452860","1453300"," I doubt it."
"1453420","1454400"," Can we get close to it?"
"1454580","1454900"," Possibly."
"1455180","1456020"," We break through it?"
"1456240","1456800"," Hell yeah. "
"1462520","1467880"," Of all the chances we've had to break through the daily trigger with conviction, this is probably"
"1467880","1468640"," the best one."
"1469820","1472240"," So far, we'll know more as we get into it."
"1472240","1474340"," As we get closer to it, we'll find out. "
"1474340","1481640"," But of the two previous, or we have one, two, three, four, this would be the fifth attempt to break"
"1481640","1481860"," it."
"1483140","1485600"," We've broken through it, but it's bounced right back, right?"
"1485820","1487080"," We've done this kind of shit."
"1487260","1490780"," We've done this kind of stuff like slam through it, rip face over it. "
"1491640","1494500"," Slam through it, blast higher off of it."
"1496140","1498660"," We've done the, uh, tap it and go straight up."
"1498780","1500500"," We haven't broken this right here. "
"1501260","1506660"," Uh, one, two, three, four, five times."
"1507100","1508360"," Oh, you could count six possibly."
"1510580","1516180"," This right here has been by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip,"
"1516500","1517320"," like clockwork. "
"1519460","1524220"," So we're going to monitor this today to see if this is the last by the dip."
"1526480","1528080"," I think, I think it's possible."
"1528760","1529920"," We have some range expansion. "
"1534320","1536100"," I got to keep an eye on it."
"1536380","1539900"," Now, the last thing that I do is I'm also looking at the VIX."
"1540400","1541560"," It's like the last thing I'm looking at. "
"1541600","1542640"," I'm watching the VIX in the background."
"1546190","1549830"," We start to come into some resistance to the upside on the VIX."
"1549910","1554010"," I'm like, yeah, you know, I got velocity already, already bottoming out. "
"1554010","1555150"," Max bearishness."
"1555150","1562150"," I got VIX coming into some resistance and I'm like, yeah, like one plus two plus four plus ten plus"
"1562150","1564250"," thirty plus one hundred doesn't equal."
"1564430","1565270"," We're going to blast through here. "
"1565330","1565830"," Does that make sense?"
"1566590","1569370"," So I'm like, yeah, we're not, we're not, we're going to buy the fuck out of this right now."
"1571170","1575930"," I kind of need it to be like, yeah, there's a whole bunch of shit we can do to go"
"1575930","1576510"," lower, right?"
"1577410","1579510"," There's no resistance on top of the VIX."
"1581570","1585330"," We're at the zero line on the hourly and the daily velocity. "
"1586130","1587050"," We're on the top."
"1587810","1590030"," Max bullishness on those two things."
"1590650","1593430"," Or you like zero, but not, not, not max bearishness. "
"1594170","1595430"," We got room to go down."
"1596770","1601490"," The expected move has expansion in it."
"1603530","1606790"," We can start stacking up some numbers, right?"
"1606790","1609430"," We can start doing like 70 hundred point moves, that kind of stuff. "
"1610170","1613950"," Not 50 this way, 50 that way and ping-pong back and forth."
"1620720","1623020"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"1623520","1627880"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flame futures, forex and stock instruments. "
"1628740","1629900"," First target on the VIX."
"1630180","1632180"," VIX right now coming into its hourly trigger."
"1633460","1642340"," It's looking to trade $20.33. You want to see price on the VIX get above $18 "
"1642340","1651960",".09. $18.09. Right now it's trading $18.10."
"1654620","1658260"," Translation, you're looking for a blast down on spy. "
"1659820","1660460"," Pullback."
"1661660","1667680"," So the price on VIX comes back down to that $18.09. It checks it and then we start heading"
"1667680","1668280"," lower here."
"1669460","1671560"," So we'll keep an eye on that this morning. "
"1675790","1680090"," So five minutes away now to get the FDIC board of directors meeting again."
"1680370","1682930"," So they announced that announcement was made earlier on."
"1683050","1686150"," They were going to talk about the deposit insurance fund today. "
"1686530","1690350"," Whether this meeting is correlated to that is unclear, but we have got the video out on the news"
"1690350","1690550"," feed."
"1690670","1691570"," Those of you that are interested."
"1695370","1707900"," That was the pin strike right there on this low right here. "
"1708180","1709740"," And this is this one right here."
"1709920","1711180"," This is right down there."
"1712520","1720100"," 408.64, 408.86. This one really isn't a major one right here, but this is a major one down"
"1720100","1720360"," below. "
"1731600","1733740"," We're going to talk about unemployment today."
"1737180","1738380"," Unemployment is important."
"1738660","1739740"," Claims is important. "
"1741160","1746680"," For all the bare shit that I hear out there from bears like the collapsed bears and the bears, just"
"1746680","1747480"," bears in general."
"1749800","1751740"," I try to tell them all the time."
"1751880","1752760"," They never listen to me. "
"1752860","1757540"," I'm like the one thing that matters is always unemployment."
"1759760","1761620"," I don't care about the twos and tens."
"1762160","1763760"," I don't care about the threes and tens. "
"1764240","1765920"," I don't care about bed funds rate."
"1765920","1766800"," I think I do."
"1767400","1769600"," I do care about that stuff. "
"1772620","1773680"," Do I care about inflation?"
"1774220","1774860"," Yeah, I care about it."
"1774980","1777620"," I think all those things together kind of paint a picture."
"1780100","1784220"," But the only thing that completes a picture is always unemployment. "
"1791430","1793890"," Unemployment is the magic key for a bear."
"1795630","1796650"," Always has been, always will."
"1797330","1799990"," It's the most consistent period. "
"1801190","1807550"," If you speak to people out there, if you follow people out there that say anything else matters,"
"1807930","1808950"," they are wrong."
"1809390","1812690"," The inflation impact is unclear."
"1814250","1822350"," The only thing that matters, like even this is even more than monetary policy, is unemployment. "
"1823190","1833170"," The only consistent way in terms of the market to know if the market is going to"
"1833170","1834450"," go down is unemployment."
"1835310","1836490"," Always has been, always will be."
"1838130","1840130"," You can smear shit all over the walls. "
"1840430","1847730"," You can get your tubes of colored shit and paint a picture, whatever you want to do."
"1849430","1852130"," And I give you zero credit for doing that out there."
"1852710","1858550"," If you want to those like high-follow people or you're on like market watch or CNBC, I give a"
"1858550","1859270"," fine fuck. "
"1861490","1867830"," But anything you're putting out there, unless you say unemployment is the key."
"1868670","1873790"," Now you can paint all that shit, but you'll be painting it like it matters, because what really"
"1873790","1875010"," matters is unemployment."
"1875010","1878430"," Unemployment, unemployment, unemployment, unemployment. "
"1878950","1881250"," You can go back in history, we'll look at it again today."
"1881810","1884470"," I feel like I'm just like non-stop talking about this stuff."
"1885090","1888090"," We revisit it every few weeks to a month, and that is unemployment. "
"1888570","1889890"," It's the only consistent way."
"1890610","1893890"," You can, you can, you can, you can divine."
"1895010","1899630"," That's cash prices, that means we'll have to keep at its extended period. "
"1900390","1902910"," You can divine some shit from the two's and tens."
"1902910","1906070"," You can divine some shit from the unemployment rate."
"1906390","1907770"," And that's real pressure on banks. "
"1908470","1913830"," Fed funds rate and monetary policy, pumping money in the system, printing money, all that kind of"
"1913830","1913990"," stuff."
"1914330","1915650"," But, oh, printing money matters."
"1916350","1920130"," Surely expecting a comment from the FDIC at board of directors meeting again. "
"1920270","1922130"," The video is out on the news feed for those of you that are interested."
"1922810","1925130"," If they're printing money, right, that matters."
"1925450","1926790"," We're going up in a big way. "
"1927330","1932890"," But dude, like last year in 2022, I heard like the mantra last year."
"1933870","1936250"," And you guys are the ones that followed them."
"1938010","1939930"," You guys, I watched it happen. "
"1940130","1944110"," I watched last year, they were selling you so much bullshit on, on Fintuit."
"1946430","1951990"," They were like, and these people had like no followers, and they have like a hundred thousand"
"1951990","1952850"," million followers."
"1953750","1955690"," These weren't even like the classic bears. "
"1957610","1962840"," And they sold you all kinds of horse shit."
"1964560","1969140"," They were like, oh, yeah, as long as the Fed's raising rates, the market can't go up."
"1969140","1970320"," That was my favorite one. "
"1971840","1974280"," The market can't go up with the raising rates."
"1974940","1977100"," Well, we know now that's a fucking lie, right?"
"1977480","1978640"," Big banks face billions."
"1978940","1981680"," The GIC fees to cover SBB failure. "
"1981960","1985960"," The GIF after the uninsured deposits made whole."
"1986680","1988540"," They should have changed their fucking tune too."
"1988640","1992240"," You're probably going to get a bunch of buyable dips and make a ton of money. "
"1992240","1994160"," Until they stop raising rates."
"1995300","1999960"," And when they start doing the cutting and the unemployment rate is going up."
"2003280","2004980"," They don't want to tell you that though. "
"2005560","2007220"," They want to sell you shit."
"2012420","2015240"," You know, and I find it comical."
"2015400","2017320"," It used to make me really angry, but whatever. "
"2017680","2018840"," You guys lose your money."
"2020100","2022400"," You guys lose your money in the collapse trade."
"2022940","2023380"," Now. "
"2025080","2027080"," You got jobless claims come out."
"2029680","2031020"," That was good to see."
"2031400","2032360"," That was progress. "
"2033200","2034880"," If you're a bear, you want to see that."
"2035000","2037300"," If you're a bull that wants an actual bottom of this market."
"2038220","2040220"," The thing that you're looking for. "
"2041900","2044120"," Like your main thing that you're looking for."
"2044300","2046780"," I mean, you know, not rate cuts will signal it."
"2046780","2050480"," But you're looking for the unemployment rate to go up. "
"2052080","2053100"," Not once."
"2053940","2055620"," Not like here and there."
"2057360","2060560"," You want to start to see that like you don't want to see like. "
"2060940","2062980"," We're at a bottom like Max Max employment."
"2063659","2067159"," We bounce and then come back down or we keep doing this nonsense."
"2068300","2069719"," Or this and then this nonsense. "
"2070280","2072159"," You want to see a nice curve."
"2074380","2076620"," Of unemployment over time."
"2079540","2080580"," On unemployment. "
"2080940","2081620"," Nobody cares."
"2082639","2085219"," If no guarantees by May 18th."
"2085540","2087460"," Just to repeat that their rush will end the crane deal. "
"2088100","2090020"," If no guarantees by May 18th."
"2093380","2097200"," Nobody cares about your super chart going back 100 years."
"2101930","2105150"," Either that shows that that turn on unemployment. "
"2105770","2107730"," Like if this was the turn on unemployment."
"2108710","2112710"," And you're looking at 100 year chart or 20 year chart."
"2112950","2115370"," A lot of these guys like showing 20, 30, 40 year charts. "
"2116390","2119850"," And they're like, look, unemployment's going up and the market crashed."
"2120530","2123730"," And I'm like, yeah, but this was like nine months in here."
"2124650","2127710"," Like that was nine months of the market going up. "
"2132510","2135410"," Or that was 12 months of the market going up."
"2135670","2137870"," According to Russia remain."
"2138010","2138370"," Makes sense. "
"2138850","2140290"," And the UN on the grain do."
"2140950","2144910"," So you'll also get people out there pointing and saying, Hey, the unemployment rate's going up."
"2145050","2145550"," We're going to crash. "
"2146550","2148250"," And they'll say, look at this chart over here."
"2148570","2151870"," The chart they're showing you is like a 30 year chart or 20 year chart."
"2152170","2154070"," Normally it's like 20, 30, 40, 50 years. "
"2154710","2156430"," And they're like right here, here and here and here."
"2156770","2158710"," What they're not pointing out to you is that."
"2159330","2164550"," In that timeframe, if you were to widen that timeframe, you're like, shit, the market. "
"2165410","2166790"," Traded sideways end up."
"2168850","2170950"," Until they also cut rates."
"2173470","2175410"," So this is good progress this morning. "
"2175570","2177270"," You want to see these claims go up."
"2177410","2177830"," You want to see."
"2178350","2179990"," You want to see the employment rate go up. "
"2180650","2182330"," But does that mean we get crashed tomorrow?"
"2182770","2183010"," No."
"2184170","2185210"," It doesn't."
"2185210","2192090"," And as long as they pause and continue to raise rates, you're not going to get that crash still,"
"2192330","2194650"," but it's a, it's progress in the right. "
"2195210","2196530"," Uh, direction."
"2198170","2199170"," Does that make sense?"
"2199970","2205050"," According to real, so I think diplomat Moscow opposes the indefinite extension of a black sea grain"
"2205050","2205310"," deal."
"2206150","2210330"," Now the twos and tens threes and tens, they can predict a crash, but they don't predict them"
"2210330","2211430"," consistently enough. "
"2212750","2216530"," They predict them like 60% of the time, 70% of the time."
"2218650","2223510"," The one validator is unemployment and cutting of rates."
"2223850","2226110"," You'll sometimes see some of this stuff front run. "
"2226610","2230070"," We actually saw the market decline get front run."
"2232590","2236050"," The Fed telegraph to us, hey, we're going to start raising rates."
"2236170","2237370"," They've never done that in the past. "
"2238190","2239950"," So we front ran the market going down."
"2242550","2247010"," And they will if they know something like, hey, they're going to cut rates, they will front run"
"2247010","2248810"," this market blasting to the depths of hell."
"2254250","2261330"," That's why it's important to listen to these rate decision meetings and be honest with yourself"
"2261330","2262690"," what they're saying to you. "
"2263690","2267050"," Like when we're listening to a rate decision meeting, right?"
"2267490","2271650"," And he comes and Jerome comes out and says, this is not a rate pause."
"2272870","2277630"," But he removed it from the press or press release, the actual paper."
"2279590","2285130"," And he was kind of wishy washy later on when he was asked more pointed questions. "
"2285430","2289010"," A conference in Madrid text is expected as well as Q&A with the moderator."
"2289790","2296990"," It sounded more like we're going to pause and relook back next in the fall."
"2306550","2308630"," We're going to reassess over the summertime. "
"2309250","2314810"," Jerome Powell's last rate, not this rate decision, but the last one, he said, in the press or the"
"2314810","2320390"," actual press, he said, I think the tightening credit market is going to do the rest of the job."
"2320590","2324310"," He's already telling you that he thinks the job is done."
"2328040","2329820"," So they're going to do a wait and see. "
"2333790","2336090"," This rate decision, they're pausing."
"2336230","2337370"," They're going to pause and wait and see."
"2337730","2344150"," Now, my view is they're going to come back in the fall and we're going to have tons of inflation. "
"2345510","2349130"," You're seeing it right now in this spring's housing market."
"2350330","2351270"," People don't care."
"2351450","2352150"," They're just spending money. "
"2353970","2357870"," The unemployment rate is rising, but it's not to the level that you're looking for."
"2360450","2361810"," It's not at that place."
"2362730","2363470"," You'll know it. "
"2363490","2365230"," If you're older, you know what I'm talking about."
"2367170","2369990"," You'll start hearing all of your friends, not some of your friends."
"2370190","2372170"," All of your friends will start losing their jobs. "
"2375150","2375910"," No hiring."
"2376210","2379490"," They're friends trying to get a new job and they'll say, oh, yeah, I was commanding whatever I"
"2379490","2379750"," wanted."
"2379970","2380970"," Now I can't even find anything. "
"2386230","2391150"," You'll have peers out there that look like they're wealthier than you."
"2391330","2392470"," They will start going bankrupt."
"2395390","2398410"," They'll be driving really nice F-350s. "
"2398510","2399470"," They'll have the perfect house."
"2399770","2400970"," They'll have perfect kids and wife."
"2401630","2403750"," And they'll start seeing their relationships fall apart. "
"2405510","2406490"," Every time."
"2408110","2409930"," Every cycle you see it happen."
"2410670","2416470"," If you're a bartender, you'll start seeing people stop ordering a Christal. "
"2417550","2420790"," If you're, I don't know, a lawn mower dealer."
"2421770","2424410"," You'll start seeing people looking for used lawn mowers."
"2430810","2432750"," You'll see people stop going to Disneyland. "
"2433390","2438210"," Maybe they go to what's that place, Dolly Land or whatever it's called, or the place that's in"
"2438210","2439070"," Kentucky or whatever."
"2442960","2446280"," Your friends will stay at a third-tier hotel outside of Disneyland."
"2446600","2447560"," That kind of stuff, you know. "
"2448780","2451060"," You'll hear your friends say, I'm not going to Vale this year."
"2451180","2452120"," I'm going to Winter Park."
"2457620","2459260"," Because these people piss their money away. "
"2459520","2459840"," They do it."
"2459980","2460620"," That's how they live their lives."
"2460880","2461460"," Not a bad way to live. "
"2461620","2461920"," I like it."
"2462420","2462940"," Good way to live."
"2464580","2465300"," Enjoying their life. "
"2465540","2465800"," I get it."
"2466660","2467280"," It's American Way."
"2469060","2473580"," But when you start seeing people that normally spend their vacation in Disney and they start"
"2473580","2476100"," spending it outside of Disney, it's all those little hints. "
"2476500","2480580"," When you're buying stock companies, right, that your kids like, that are publicly traded companies,"
"2481220","2483660"," you're like, wow, I didn't see that happening."
"2483840","2485140"," But my kids all love that stuff."
"2485540","2486040"," Same thing. "
"2486160","2487580"," Same thing applies with unemployment."
"2491040","2493640"," I don't care that people are working two jobs."
"2494320","2496360"," I don't care that they have to work 80 hours a week. "
"2497080","2499760"," If they're working their butts off, I don't care if they're not getting paid enough."
"2499760","2502600"," I don't care that they're not making ends meet."
"2502800","2504100"," That doesn't matter to the stock market. "
"2504420","2508840"," What matters to the stock market is when these people don't work, when they don't have a job, when"
"2508840","2513040"," their relationships blow up, when they lose their houses, their cars, they can't lose, you'll see"
"2513040","2514200"," these people who live out of their cars."
"2517540","2519160"," There are people working their butts off."
"2519340","2520740"," That's not good for the unemployment rate. "
"2520900","2522680"," I want to see the unemployment rate go up."
"2524380","2527380"," Where someone loses their job, they're unemployable."
"2527380","2529680"," They have to take something shitty unless. "
"2530180","2534300"," I want to see realtors waiting tables once again."
"2534400","2539660"," When you guys are out there and you go to a restaurant, and you say, wow, the service is great."
"2540880","2543780"," That's because professionals are out of work. "
"2544860","2549700"," You normally get your best service anywhere, anything."
"2550080","2554640"," I don't care if it's a restaurant, a grocery store, anywhere you go."
"2554640","2560020"," Like service, your best service normally is in the worst economic times. "
"2560780","2564440"," Because people are taking these kind of jobs that wouldn't normally take them."
"2569460","2571920"," They actually squeeze out the poor."
"2573860","2577020"," They take the poor's jobs away from them. "
"2578960","2583380"," So that's part of sources saying five minutes when I was to expect to hear comments from Feds"
"2583380","2586540"," Waller, but as per the Fed website saying 10, 30 ames and so on."
"2586620","2588660"," Just keep your heads up and comments as text released."
"2589060","2590720"," I know this is a disgusting conversation. "
"2592480","2596400"," I don't want to be the one to tell it to you because people don't want to talk about that"
"2596400","2596680"," stuff."
"2596880","2598120"," They don't want to say that to you."
"2599180","2600280"," I don't agree with it. "
"2600620","2601620"," That's what it is though."
"2602060","2604480"," And you have to be aware of it as an investor and as a trader."
"2606700","2611180"," You have to be one cold-hearted person to at least be able to identify when it matters. "
"2622900","2623680"," Yeah, it sucks."
"2623900","2625460"," I don't want to say it's gross."
"2625860","2626280"," Stephen, discuss. "
"2628180","2635340"," Just seeing the S&P 500 bank index extends losses after the U.S. FDIC targets around 113 largest U "
"2635340","2640720",".S. lenders to bear costs to reimburse the insurance fund to last down one spot 2%."
"2642640","2645560"," You know, people on their lives over that stuff."
"2646100","2650780"," You saw it in 2008 and 2000 people on their lives over that stuff. "
"2652340","2654340"," People's lives don't come back over that stuff."
"2656440","2657480"," It's soul-crushing."
"2662540","2664220"," It's soul-crushing for a lot of people. "
"2664480","2665480"," It's very destructive."
"2667380","2668720"," And not just poor people."
"2668940","2670280"," Like, even people with like, hey, I got a career. "
"2671360","2674220"," I got the wife and the kids or I got the husband and the kids and all the stuff."
"2674320","2676480"," I got the two dogs and I got, you know, whatever it is."
"2676480","2677340"," A couple of cars. "
"2678300","2679580"," You go on vacation, do this stuff."
"2679660","2681560"," You have a time-share somewhere, whatever it is that you do."
"2683240","2685480"," I work my butt off in the system all these years. "
"2686400","2688380"," Look at that person over there where it was."
"2688500","2691700"," I fuck up their whole lives and I worked hard all my life and here I am."
"2692760","2694220"," That's not fun for those people either. "
"2694300","2695240"," It's not fun for poor people."
"2695380","2698480"," It's not fun for people that actually did hard work all their lives."
"2700880","2704040"," Can you be surprised who thinks they're not part of that poor class?"
"2706520","2711560"," Politics will tell you that, politics will tell you that you're middle class or you're upper middle"
"2711560","2711900"," class. "
"2713420","2715520"," And they point down on the poor people."
"2717300","2720040"," But a lot of, every generation you see it."
"2720260","2722080"," Like, as you get older, you see it when you get older. "
"2724040","2725460"," But when you're young, you don't see it."
"2725620","2728460"," When you're coming up when you're like 20s, 30s into your 40s."
"2729340","2731460"," Like, coming into your 40s, you start to see it. "
"2731460","2734500"," When you're like young, you're like, yeah, those are the pours over there and those are the middle"
"2734500","2734780"," class."
"2735060","2736720"," I grew up middle class."
"2737260","2738760"," I grew up upper middle class. "
"2738980","2744900"," But you really don't have a, if you look at the actual data, most of you are either poor."
"2745140","2747860"," I have to out the Zoom link to fetch all that again."
"2748140","2752300"," The middle class that thinks their middle class is likely poor. "
"2752580","2757860"," In the upper middle class, I think their upper middle class are like maybe middle class at best."
"2757860","2761320"," Heads up for a text release in either two minutes or 15 minutes."
"2761760","2763400"," Involve all of those people. "
"2766500","2769080"," 70% of them are financially illiterate."
"2770020","2773200"," And have no idea how close they actually are to losing all of it."
"2774800","2781040"," As long as you fit within the capitalist system where you keep working hard, you go to school, you"
"2781040","2785420"," get it, you go to tech school or college, you get advanced degrees. "
"2786260","2786860"," You're fine."
"2787060","2787820"," You're going to get a great job."
"2788060","2790120"," You're going to be able to do whatever you want to do. "
"2791820","2795300"," You don't want to get married and have a nice apartment somewhere or condo in the beach."
"2795560","2796000"," You can do that."
"2796180","2797640"," You can travel the world, whatever you want to do. "
"2798220","2805240"," But the moment most of these people, even the ones that do the right thing, get hurt, get sick."
"2807340","2809520"," Make a financial decision that's bad."
"2811180","2813500"," Hey, I bought this company over here. "
"2813800","2817100"," I bought this, I don't know, spray and wash."
"2819140","2820540"," And they lied to me."
"2821200","2822960"," They showed me cooked books. "
"2826680","2827200"," Right?"
"2827480","2827860"," It folded."
"2828280","2833280"," Or I was a bad manager of this money that I invested in a commercial company or something, right?"
"2833740","2835640"," People get taken for fraud all the time."
"2836540","2842380"," But in the moment that happens to you, because of the way a lot of people live, they're out. "
"2843500","2849200"," And as soon as you're not a part of that capitalist system, you're swept away."
"2850440","2852740"," You don't hear those people's stories out there."
"2854000","2855960"," No one cares about those people's. "
"2855960","2859020"," I see these CNBC articles on Fintuit."
"2860800","2864140"," And they're like, this is what so-and-so is doing for a gig."
"2864500","2866320"," And they're making $100,000 a year. "
"2867980","2870660"," Or a side hustle, like when they call them side hustles."
"2870880","2874980"," And this person is like doing ear B and Bs."
"2875080","2876140"," Or whatever it is they do, right?"
"2876980","2882060"," But they never showcase is the other like seven or five people that get hurt. "
"2882060","2883620"," I know comments from Feds Waller there."
"2883760","2887620"," So again, Feds website saying, supposed to be speaking at 10 30 a.m. Eastern sign."
"2888240","2889120"," Ruin their credit. "
"2889320","2891040"," Get a, I don't know, get into a car crash."
"2895460","2896480"," Get a divorce."
"2896700","2897960"," All kinds of stuff out there. "
"2898220","2900480"," So they don't highlight those stories."
"2901800","2906840"," So you have this warped view of if I work hard, success is coming to me."
"2909200","2910360"," That's like fed to you. "
"2910440","2911200"," It's spoon fed to you."
"2911260","2911960"," It's supposed to be food."
"2911960","2913260"," We need people like you. "
"2913400","2914580"," We need people like you to produce."
"2915660","2916260"," We need doctors."
"2916520","2916940"," We need attorneys. "
"2917380","2919080"," We need architects and engineers."
"2920860","2922300"," We need someone to sweep the floor."
"2922460","2923640"," We need someone to build a car. "
"2925220","2926700"," We need someone to change tires."
"2926700","2928260"," We need someone to mow the lawns."
"2929240","2933120"," And we need the promise that if you work hard, you're going to do well. "
"2935220","2939100"," And there's always a generation underneath you ready to go to replace you."
"2941080","2942000"," That's time passes."
"2942380","2943500"," Now, we're not going to talk about that. "
"2943640","2951340"," Because Diane Feinstein, man, she needs to replace, but she looks like the guy from Dr. Hu, man."
"2956820","2959880"," But this is important to the stock market as my points."
"2960620","2962000"," A little bit of squeeze here. "
"2962740","2963860"," Nice little tag down here."
"2964180","2966620"," We'll see if we can get some continuation to the downside here."
"2974030","2974990"," VIX consolidating. "
"2975070","2976130"," That's hourly trigger right now."
"2976390","2977590"," We'll find out what this means."
"2978230","2980610"," Find out the hourly come up and help the VIX out here in a minute. "
"2984580","2987680"," Right now we are trading on the 6 EMA to the downside."
"2989280","2990480"," Price gets above that."
"2990680","2999840"," Next target above is 411.51. So pay attention to this stuff in the coming year is my point here. "
"3000900","3002660"," Pay attention to the unemployment rate."
"3003200","3004240"," Pay attention to the jobs."
"3004660","3005780"," Those are the two key drivers. "
"3007640","3013120"," Pay attention with an honest open mind to what the Fed is telling you."
"3013920","3015060"," Don't drink the Kool-Aid."
"3016280","3021260"," You're going to get little Fed President Smearn Schinn on the wall telling you, like, I hear him"
"3021260","3023080"," every day they're like, we're going to pause. "
"3023480","3023880"," We're going to cut."
"3025420","3027240"," We're going to increase rates."
"3028460","3031180"," They do that to protect themselves down the road. "
"3031840","3038500"," They don't want to be remembered and quoted as being pinned to some idea that they're not fully"
"3038500","3040160"," aware of what they're going to do."
"3040980","3044500"," They don't mean they don't be remembered as, hey, look, that guy said we're going to keep"
"3044500","3045240"," increasing rates."
"3045300","3046560"," He said it like six times. "
"3046560","3047760"," He never said we're going to pause."
"3051730","3052670"," He's a dumbass."
"3053770","3058150"," So that guy's going to get quoted when they're Smearn Schinn on the walls, right?"
"3058150","3058910"," Let's ship. "
"3058930","3060690"," This isn't like the people on social media."
"3060810","3062190"," This is the Fed President's."
"3064230","3066990"," When they're consistent in their statement, they know what they're doing. "
"3067630","3072090"," When they're not consistent in their statements, it means that they don't know what they're doing"
"3072090","3072370"," next."
"3083380","3085040"," So that was good today."
"3085220","3086160"," I like seeing that today. "
"3086320","3088300"," I like seeing those jobs numbers today."
"3088880","3089780"," That made me happy."
"3090440","3094240"," I want to see job destruction. "
"3095860","3098060"," I want to see the market get a bottom."
"3100760","3102860"," I don't think it happens today, though."
"3103340","3107840"," I don't think you're getting your bloodbath today. "
"3107980","3111280"," I think your bloodbath comes when we have unemployment rates."
"3112080","3114320"," Jobless claims increasing over time."
"3114320","3120270"," And we get a little bit of pausing going on. "
"3120770","3123450"," I think I'm coming from Germany's economy minister, Habek."
"3124650","3134510"," I'd be trying to front run that maybe next year at"
"3134510","3135890"," some point, maybe the year after."
"3137210","3145890"," I don't like that they're still talking about supporting failures. "
"3148830","3151990"," Like all this information this morning looks like, yeah, we're going to crash the market."
"3152150","3157550"," But the truth is, in like two weeks, I'm serious, like four weeks, six weeks."
"3158690","3164630"," I would never be shocked to see commercial real estate CEOs. "
"3164630","3166750"," They want to dip their hand in the potty pot, man."
"3167410","3168750"," They want that free-fed money."
"3169950","3171570"," Like the news changes all of a sudden. "
"3172770","3175810"," You see the balance sheet starts spiking like crazy."
"3177190","3183650"," So when asked, we give the EIA natural gas change forecast, MCA, BCF, only prior to 54 BCF."
"3184810","3186710"," Yeah, it's like dick teas in or something. "
"3188150","3189530"," You're like, oh, yeah, we're going down."
"3189670","3190070"," It's happening."
"3190550","3192270"," You know, unemployment's going up, man. "
"3194070","3195950"," We all thought it was going up, right?"
"3196070","3197170"," Well, we all thought it was going to happen."
"3197170","3200390"," And then all of a sudden they're like, here's some cocaine for the regional banks."
"3203950","3205750"," They broke the agreement with you. "
"3206710","3207950"," So it's going to take some time."
"3214680","3216420"," Be patient if you're a bear."
"3222240","3223380"," Wait on the VIX here. "
"3223460","3224300"," VIX is almost there."
"3224420","3226120"," It's almost going to start getting explosive here."
"3226300","3232080"," VIX is trading $18.08. $18 or it's, I gave you that number, that magic number earlier. "
"3232420","3234480"," $18.09 was the magic number."
"3234740","3237480"," It's just waiting for the one minute and the five minute to get up there."
"3238080","3239500"," Got the hourly underneath it. "
"3239560","3241100"," We should have a nice down day today."
"3249250","3251710"," Should get a big old red bar up here in a minute."
"3251910","3254290"," You guys want to see it on the one minute chart so it looks sexy?"
"3259250","3260130"," Oh, yeah. "
"3262390","3263270"," That's the one minute."
"3263770","3265430"," I know you bears like seeing this."
"3275200","3280700"," Cue the music, daddy. "
"3281320","3287940"," Yeah, I think it takes time."
"3288160","3292280"," I think like, I think it's going to take, that could take anywhere from another couple of years."
"3293020","3296400"," Like two, three, I think it's possible we could extend this like three years. "
"3299140","3302980"," Which kind of sucks, but you know, it's what it is."
"3305980","3308240"," Could be a year, could be three years, could be five."
"3308500","3310560"," It depends on the support that the Fed gives. "
"3317470","3319690"," Depends on how much the fraud carries on."
"3320270","3325170"," And I'm not talking about going to 360, 3600."
"3325630","3326850"," You know what I'm talking about. "
"3338600","3341760"," Oh, yeah, 409, 97, baby."
"3345090","3346830"," Vic's pumping right now."
"3349090","3350220"," Vic's getting bullish. "
"3353560","3356820"," Vic's trading $18.13 right now."
"3360280","3371730"," Ooh, ooh,"
"3371830","3374230"," ooh, which dad down there, daddy?"
"3376230","3377690"," What's that down there?"
"3383790","3384510"," Rippy."
"3392960","3394720"," I'm watching the Vix here, man. "
"3394720","3398340"," This Vix man is watching this Vix right now."
"3401000","3405120"," And daily right now is like, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope."
"3406060","3408400"," We're going to get that five minute gnarly up here. "
"3409980","3411040"," We'll show it to you guys."
"3426300","3427760"," What a bear wants here."
"3428100","3429080"," What does a bear want to see here?"
"3429820","3430320"," Anybody know?"
"3432820","3434420"," This is a Vix, one minute chart. "
"3449360","3451120"," This is where you get your big down move."
"3464430","3466550"," So you're going to get a snapback real quick."
"3466970","3468110"," But what you want to see is this. "
"3468310","3472770"," You want to see Vix price come down, bounce back up."
"3473610","3475330"," It's more than a one week higher."
"3475890","3477610"," Lost up zero spot to six, seven percent. "
"3477950","3482110"," And then you're going to take your next leg down and spy once we break above this, okay?"
"3482510","3484350"," Only prior to 54 BCF."
"3484590","3486970"," You need the hourly, the five minutes."
"3487630","3491570"," All these things to come up and need price to get above for the next leg down. "
"3493430","3495370"," So there's that magic number right there."
"3496470","3514650"," 18.07. Hourly"
"3514650","3517950"," is turning bullish right now in the one minute, not in the 30."
"3519550","3525770"," Target above 20.30. There goes the squeeze and the spy right now. "
"3553130","3556610"," Just watching the Vix in the background and waiting for it to break above."
"3558410","3597340"," 18.07. I was"
"3597340","3597940"," a one minute chart."
"3598180","3599620"," Here's the five minute chart right here. "
"3610680","3612360"," We are bears are right here."
"3614880","3620440"," So as per the Fed website, we are expecting to comments from a Fed's Waller at 10.30 a.m."
"3620660","3620880"," Eastern time."
"3621080","3625660"," So the link he should be on the link in a couple minutes time now. "
"3652200","3670240"," Vix trade in 17.24. The"
"3670240","3681880"," five minutes on the Vix is 17.72. The hourly on the Vix is 17.41. The"
"3681880","3699350"," one minute on the Vix is 17.94. So 17.94. 17.71. And 17.39. I"
"3699350","3700870"," want to say something out there too."
"3701950","3704490"," Let me see if I can give you a comment."
"3706630","3707590"," I think right here. "
"3712510","3713670"," I got this right."
"3715190","3717670"," First, if grubster, if you're out there, I've got your phone number."
"3717790","3719070"," I'm going to give you a call and a little bit here. "
"3719150","3720130"," I'm going to take a break and call you."
"3724630","3726070"," I have your phone number now."
"3728590","3730310"," It was given to me this morning. "
"3733330","3736010"," And then there's someone else out there."
"3736850","3737790"," Who was it?"
"3749590","3752390"," If Steve is out there."
"3754530","3756270"," I'm going to give you a call as well. "
"3757510","3760110"," So if you're in the stream right now, don't make yourself known or anything."
"3760110","3763110"," If Steve is out there, I'll give you a call this afternoon or this morning as well."
"3763770","3764470"," 10 seconds. "
"3774280","3775120"," 78 BC."
"3775380","3778760"," Sorry, I'm just going to take a shower and my hair wasn't dry."
"3779300","3783700"," Saying risks are risks and any from climate change are not sufficiently unique. "
"3784140","3787560"," It says it's still important to research climate impact on economic outcomes."
"3788160","3794180"," It says climate change is real, but does not pose a serious risk to large banks or the US financial"
"3794180","3794680"," stability."
"3794680","3800540"," It says views solely focused on the financial risks and scientific community has rigorously"
"3800540","3805960"," established climate is changing and says it is not the Fed's job to be worried to be a climate"
"3805960","3809260"," policy maker financial stability at the core of the Fed's mission. "
"3809700","3814740"," It says the Fed's focus is on the general resiliency of the system, not protection against every"
"3814740","3819760"," shock that could occur and risks that a financial stability must involve near term effects and"
"3819760","3823700"," involve potential losses large enough to affect macro economy."
"3859890","3861130"," This stream is spot."

"3889000","3891280"," Book map back to a little wonky here."
"3896940","3900340"," See that liquidity break right there or that liquidity break in the market?"
"3927820","3930320"," Well, you shouldn't be getting all bush out there."
"3933320","3934280"," I'm warning you. "
"3934360","3935200"," We're blasting down."

"3940740","3941720"," Don't fade the captain. "
"3942920","3945360"," And financial stability on the feed for those interested."
"3947560","3951500"," It's just going to be a minute or two until we start ripping some faces off here in the VIX."
"3952120","3959640"," It takes time for the VIX to consolidate for a move to break through the daily trigger. "
"3960200","3960740"," It takes a minute."
"3962060","3967520"," I'm sitting here watching about but to fucking rip some faces off to the downside, so just give it"
"3967520","3967760"," a minute."
"3969820","3975500"," First, natural gas features extend gains up on spot one percent of the EIA report slightly bigger"
"3975500","3976500"," than expected storage. "
"3976540","3977180"," Bloodbath coming."
"3995220","3999740"," That VIX is about to fucking explode to the upside."
"4002700","4007140"," It gets about to rip some faces off big old red bars to the downside. "
"4009980","4011860"," About five minutes here."
"4012320","4013820"," Just taking a minute here."
"4030680","4033420"," I'm sitting and putting the numbers on here for you. "
"4033680","4034100"," Get them closer."
"4034480","4034840"," There's one."
"4038290","4040110"," There's the pivot so you can see it. "
"4052050","4056270"," VIX is just like, are you watching the VIX in the background, Winky?"
"4073800","4077930"," You never really time it."
"4077990","4079810"," You really need someone's asking what I think about tomorrow."
"4080550","4081610"," You can't price matters. "
"4083230","4089410"," If we can get down, if we can roll this market down enough, we should be up tomorrow."
"4091170","4092370"," VIX Friday's baby."
"4094450","4096410"," But it's going to matter what price is at. "
"4096569","4098229"," We're VIX's at by close today."
"4099430","4102490"," Sometimes it'll bleed into Friday and then we'll have the update on Monday or Tuesday."
"4104710","4109990"," If we go to a capitulation, not capitulation, but a liquidation phase. "
"4112109","4120609"," On breadth, if we get down to like 30% bullishness, or the market is on 30%, 21%."
"4121170","4122710"," We start bringing below 21%."
"4122710","4124649"," We'll look for further continuation of the downside. "
"4126109","4132069"," Whenever we have a capitulation or a liquidation event, then it can take three to five days to make"
"4132069","4132770"," the turn higher."
"4135170","4136970"," It's hard to say right now."
"4137250","4138450"," It's like, if this, then that. "
"4138450","4140529"," So we'll know today."
"4140609","4143970"," We'll know today or tomorrow if you expect an update on Friday or not."
"4153160","4161080"," Whenever we do a liquidation, like a market liquidation, it takes three to five sessions, usually"
"4161080","4162060"," to make a big turn. "
"4162279","4169439"," You'll get a spike, but then it consolidates for like days for sessions usually."
"4175370","4176970"," Yeah, Wink, are you watching it right now?"
"4197250","4199910"," I have it on the one minute chart right here because it's going to be fun to watch."
"4214970","4218470"," So just on the time of this time now, we are expecting to comment from ECBs to calls. "
"4243370","4244090"," 13, 467."
"4268760","4270880"," NQ sitting on its hourly trigger right now."
"4275300","4278760"," Bull's saying we're going to bounce off the hourly trigger on NQ here. "
"4282240","4285960"," Price looks positive on NQ where Spy is telling you a different story."
"4293760","4295100"," Or at least the VIX is."
"4295400","4297000"," VIX trying to hold itself up here. "
"4301480","4305760"," There's 178,000 puts on 410 P for 83 cents."
"4307060","4308460"," That could add for some fuel to the upside."
"4315310","4316210"," What do you think, Winkie?"
"4317370","4320430"," I think we go down here and start ripping faces to the upside. "
"4330310","4335310"," Not a lot of put premium to go that far up."
"4337390","4341770"," Like there's 176,000 puts, they're 84 cents."
"4341970","4347850"," I want to see them at like $3 so we can get a big old ride up. "
"4350130","4356190"," The point that I'm making here is even if we did rip face, it probably wouldn't, you know, be"
"4356190","4356790"," anything major."
"4357890","4361410"," Stirling falls to a 1 week low versus the dollar down, spot 8%."
"4361410","4363410"," There is some gaps up here. "
"4363570","4364410"," There's a gap right here."
"4368440","4371100"," There's a gap right here and there's another gap above it."
"4374700","4376020"," That was the scene of the crime. "
"4376260","4380440"," So this yesterday was the close the gap trade scene of the crime."
"4381080","4382080"," They sold it."
"4383700","4387180"," It appears to be the same link to Fed's wallet, which is on the news feed. "
"4387280","4388860"," We'll repost it out for you if you want."
"4388920","4389580"," There's the one minute chart."
"4389780","4390380"," There's gaps there. "
"4390440","4398110"," And then there's another gap above it somewhere up in here."
"4412730","4414350"," I'll show you it on the five minute chart."
"4418210","4419130"," Let's see right here. "
"4424350","4425590"," There's gaps right there."
"4425830","4426990"," There's gaps right there."
"4444890","4446730"," It's hidden on the one minute, but it's there. "
"4448410","4450150"," Somewhere up in here is a bunch of gaps made filled."
"4458050","4460170"," There's not a lot of fuel to get up there though."
"4460830","4467370"," There's not like a lot of like, there's only most of, there's some puts on 411 P there to $1 "
"4467370","4476370",".38. There's 178,000 puts on 410, but the rest of them are like 50 cents, 25 cents. "
"4476370","4479870"," Like it's not the rock of fuel you need to actually get up there and clean them out."
"4484030","4487530"," So I'm not seeing like the fuel that we need to get up there as of yet."
"4498070","4503970"," Could be a trade for bulls that zigzags, but truth be said, like the puts need to pay down here. "
"4505570","4507330"," So you can get some fuel to go to the upside."
"4509790","4513730"," This is saying the Euro full to the lowest since April 11 versus the dollar."
"4513730","4515210"," I'll get the Euro close too. "
"4535380","4537260"," I'm looking at 411 C's."
"4537400","4538560"," They're 61 cents."
"4546360","4551480"," I'd really like to see like this happen again. "
"4552820","4554480"," And then something like that."
"4555080","4556380"," I want to see like the fuel."
"4563690","4565150"," We are trading sideways. "
"4565590","4567970"," The more time we spend here, we're flattening out a little bit."
"4570230","4572570"," The white line is flattening out right here."
"4575470","4579430"," It's 10.43. I want to see a new low here. "
"4579570","4583310"," If we can't get a new low on 10.45, it's going to be good for the bulls."
"4585230","4587510"," We've got two minutes to get a new low right now."
"4588350","4597930"," This is 10.22. So 10.43. They've had a half an hour to get a new low. "
"4598190","4601130"," So in the next two minutes, I'll give them five minutes."
"4602350","4604090"," They can't get a new low down here."
"4605090","4606650"," In the half an hour. "
"4608270","4609450"," We'll start talking about the upside."
"4617040","4618360"," This is what you're looking at here."
"4618500","4620700"," This 409.97 is important. "
"4624850","4627390"," Just a few more minutes from the forbears to get it."
"4642240","4644180"," I'll hand it over to the bulls here in a second."
"4670800","4676260"," Dude, what is going on with my fucking brokerage is not making me happy here. "
"4724120","4727680"," Come along with some calls here, but I don't know how long I'm going to hold them."
"4760610","4766510"," They didn't get it at 10.45. 15 minutes of bullish freedom here."
"4767810","4785190"," Yeah, that's a nice 81 cents down up"
"4785190","4785650"," there, baby. "
"4790130","4790670"," Nice."

"4831650","4851520"," They just"
"4851520","4853760"," went to $1.04 from 64 cents. "
"4854220","4854700"," Fuck."
"4857060","4858060"," That was a nice trade."
"4858220","4859000"," I wish I had stayed in it. "
"4864180","4867140"," That was almost 100% trade right there in three minutes."
"4875310","4879370"," I was like 100% trade right here on 411 C's right here."

"4949420","4952040"," Or 11 minutes, excuse me."
"4979630","4984830"," So in terms of time now, we expect to comment from a bank of England's Governor Bailey, who did"
"4984830","4987570"," prior interviews with a variety of new sources."
"4987910","4991130"," So the text for that will be released, be released in terms of time. "
"5016380","5017300"," Vicks are the bounce off."
"5017300","5018140"," It's hourly just then."
"5042050","5043450"," I'm getting text messages here. "
"5114810","5116310"," I can't take a look here and see this."
"5117150","5118710"," I'm getting asked to look at something in the background."
"5142000","5145440"," I'm going to copper looks like it's about to rip some faces off here in the background, Binky. "
"5147160","5147660"," Just a heads up."
"5148420","5149480"," You want to know what you think."
"5153150","5158210"," Copper looks like it's going to trade to 38, 0, 4, 5."
"5164170","5165110"," Price is above. "
"5165290","5166470"," It's one in five minute right now."

"5188950","5194610"," 3.7148. If it stays above that number, it should bounce here."
"5196170","5206220"," The next cell on it is 3.7940."
"5208340","5209800"," And Dr. Copper brother. "
"5224630","5225710"," Oh, no, John."

"5279480","5282880"," So five minutes away now, so we are expecting comments from Bank of England's Bailey."
"5283240","5287300"," So the text from the interviews he's done earlier today. "
"5287300","5288340"," Okay, never mind."
"5288840","5291300"," All right, I'm not looking."

"5348450","5349330"," Here, here."
"5350610","5352670"," That's all the faith that I have in it right up there."
"5354790","5358070"," I don't see a bunch of fuel, so I don't want to get tied into. "
"5358970","5363010"," I'm afraid of getting tied into like a ping pong bullshit over here."
"5364890","5366410"," Get a year more bullish than I am."
"5366470","5367370"," I'm not that bullish here. "
"5378510","5379650"," I don't see the fuel."
"5379890","5383730"," There's like 300,000 for 10Ps and now worth 46 cents."
"5384350","5385770"," They just torched all these puts. "
"5388200","5389580"," There's not a bunch of rocket fuel."
"5407670","5411230"," And that's the two small gaps right here."
"5411330","5412790"," Two, four, eleven, seventy seven. "
"5412950","5413590"," I didn't see these earlier."
"5415470","5417250"," There's another gap up here at four, thirteen."
"5417550","5418570"," I'll put those in for you. "
"5419870","5420890"," There's one right there."
"5429530","5431360"," There's another one right there."
"5436310","5438870"," This right here is the pre-market low. "
"5440650","5442690"," Pre-market low gap gap."
"5443490","5444950"," But the big gaps are way up."
"5445070","5446950"," There's another gap right where we already know about these. "
"5447890","5448590"," There's a gap."
"5448790","5450250"," We'll just put them up here so you can see them."
"5452410","5454250"," There's like all kinds of gaps up here. "
"5454290","5456330"," I just don't see the fuel to get up there."
"5458190","5462560"," There's some hidden gaps down here."
"5464360","5469050"," The sell side getting run over right now. "
"5475920","5481380"," Bears had it at 10.30, I think, and then they lost there."
"5481480","5482960"," They had it at 10.20 this morning."
"5485980","5489440"," Then they lost it at 10.30 and then 10.45 down here. "
"5489600","5490180"," They gave it up."
"5490740","5491800"," 10.20, they made the new low."
"5492200","5492860"," 10.30, they failed. "
"5492860","5494880"," 10.45, they failed again."
"5495620","5497240"," Bulls in charge at the moment."
"5505970","5507910"," I'm going to read some news to you right now. "
"5513070","5514870"," Should I read you the cash carry statements?"
"5514950","5515690"," It was a disaster."
"5515990","5516810"," It's the same bullshit."
"5517110","5517430"," Thank you. "
"5517610","5518190"," It's Governor Bailey."
"5519670","5521770"," You've got Bailey talking here in a moment."
"5521910","5523350"," I don't know if I want to read you the cash carry stuff. "
"5523410","5524050"," It was pure diarrhea."
"5530370","5533450"," China's top envoy, Wang Yi."

"5641190","5642170"," There is some. "
"5643270","5644710"," So you can find this for you."
"5648600","5650340"," We need a couple of things to you."
"5656530","5657650"," Let me read this. "
"5658250","5663590"," Bank of England's Governor Bailey signals the Bank of England may pause rate hikes if UK inflation"
"5663590","5664410"," slows."
"5665090","5670870"," So Bailey said the most aggressive interest interest rate rises in four decades could be near an"
"5670870","5673650"," end so long as inflation weakens."
"5686370","5688310"," We'll talk about this right now. "
"5688330","5690550"," This is important to talk about about the debt ceiling."
"5690710","5692290"," I know you guys want to know stuff."
"5704500","5705260"," Okay, so. "
"5707460","5708440"," The debt ceiling."
"5712550","5717970"," Debt ceiling, you're going to get a you are going to get like Jamie Diamond is right to an extent."
"5717970","5722310"," And market profile levels by signing up to the tick. "
"5722530","5724830"," Now the though Jamie Diamond is kind of right."
"5726870","5729710"," Normally when that panic begins."
"5730970","5732110"," It will be. "
"5733210","5735090"," After price melts up."
"5735290","5739030"," That's something that so there's like an ex date, right?"
"5739810","5741850"," Like Wall Street has their own ex date."
"5744130","5746910"," The Fed has their own ex date. "
"5750070","5751630"," Everybody has their own secret."
"5752630","5753430"," Ex date."
"5755170","5756230"," For when it matters. "
"5757970","5763650"," If everybody's loading up on puts, they're going to make this market go to the moon over it."
"5764250","5765390"," Then they'll roll it over."
"5766830","5771230"," Often times you'll see people be like, well, they're going to front run it and we're going to crash"
"5771230","5771950"," to the depths of hell. "
"5772290","5774010"," We're going to 3600."
"5774010","5777410"," 52 week bills on May 16th to settle in May 18th."
"5777510","5779550"," Probably not until we go up first, right?"
"5779950","5781450"," It for 20 or even higher. "
"5783370","5785990"," Now when does that ex date matter?"
"5786170","5786930"," I mean that matters too."
"5788190","5789310"," You can be like right."
"5790930","5791730"," Oh, look. "
"5793130","5794770"," The market did roll over."
"5795930","5797270"," Because of the debt ceiling."
"5798170","5801010"," Fear, but you know, where did it roll over from, right?"
"5801190","5801550"," That matters. "
"5806470","5811670"," You know, if you're like pointing at it when we're at like 396 or 400 and you're like, it's going"
"5811670","5814630"," to roll over, but it first goes to 420 or 430."
"5815990","5818050"," That doesn't fucking help, right?"
"5819750","5821290"," You're not going to make any money."
"5822490","5827350"," Probably going to get a phone call from your broker saying, sorry, Mr. James. "
"5829250","5830390"," You're not Mike Bar."
"5830470","5833810"," You can't short for 30 years, lock us out and keep all our money."
"5836470","5841310"," So, you know, for you as a retail trader, the question becomes, when is that ex date?"
"5845180","5846860"," I do believe that. "
"5848700","5851980"," Traders trading that trade will get that event."
"5852160","5854260"," I think that they will as a high probability of it."
"5854760","5859680"," Even if we don't have even if the debt ceiling is signed, you're going to get that weakness, that"
"5859680","5860080"," volatility. "
"5873030","5873550"," Sweet."
"5874150","5876790"," I'm going to get a fill here in just a second and get out of this."
"5880870","5881750"," Doing good today. "
"5881850","5885130"," It's two good trades about to get a fill right now."
"5886870","5888610"," It's a good day today making money."
"5899220","5902500"," Had some four 12s went up about 10% or so. "
"5902500","5904520"," So I'm happy 20, maybe even 20%."
"5904520","5906840"," I'm not sure about to fill right now."
"5911020","5912200"," I'm going to sell this. "
"5912200","5916000"," I should hold higher, but I think we're going to hit this 70 cents or something here."
"5918740","5920800"," Nice bullish cross right here coming up."
"5921080","5922160"," Watch out if you're a bull. "
"5922640","5923600"," Watch out of our bear."
"5923800","5924740"," Watch out if you're a bear."
"5925020","5928360"," If you're a bull, be careful of a quick reverse. "
"5928660","5931880"," We go up, come back down, then the test is to the upside."
"5932920","5933740"," Be careful in here."
"5933780","5934860"," There's a lot of volatility in here. "
"5936040","5937900"," Not a lot of fuel to get up there."
"5944280","5949240"," So on the debt ceiling limit, even if they pass a bill, there's likely going to get some."
"5949320","5950900"," There's going to be some print off of it. "
"5951500","5953080"," Some volatility print off of it."
"5955360","5956640"," So positioning matters."
"5959580","5961920"," When you take that trade, how long you hold it for. "
"5962680","5967340"," I always recommend on that trade specifically, I've been recommending for the past week a ratio"
"5967340","5967860"," spread."
"5969300","5973740"," So that blows up in your face and we go higher and that ball trade doesn't print."
"5974000","5975880"," You're at least going to not lose money. "
"5977820","5978860"," Pay attention to that."
"5982000","5984760"," Well, I might have to enter this again, man."
"5984920","5990360"," If this thing, we can get this check here. "
"5990560","5991860"," Right here."
"5993140","5996540"," We can get this check right here and we start green borrowing it up."
"5996540","5997480"," I'm going to jump in again. "
"5997720","6001380"," Evidence that allows us to be sure rates can stay on hold."
"6011360","6012660"," We're watching this right here."
"6014740","6017480"," We're getting a bounce right now on the hourly VIX trigger. "
"6029830","6031030"," It'll take that trade again."
"6032130","6036190"," I'm watching to see if we can get a liquidation break here and if it starts to fight its way"
"6036190","6039870"," back up, it like blasts down and then comes back up here."
"6043850","6045370"," So that volatility trade. "
"6045750","6046750"," I think it works."
"6047150","6050710"," I think you're going to get the volatility trade on the debt ceiling regardless of what happens."
"6051590","6053410"," A price is going to matter for you on it. "
"6058530","6063010"," If you took that trade last week and we talked about putting it on, if you guys closed those trades"
"6063010","6063870"," yesterday, I don't know."
"6065290","6067110"," If you're still diamond-handing that stuff."
"6067110","6076210"," I like the idea though of the X date being anytime from now until late July. "
"6076790","6082190"," So if you're going to put on that kind of a trade like a volatility trade up around $4.18"
"6082190","6091010"," or $4.20 or $4.23. If you already did it last week, it should be dated into late July"
"6091010","6095790"," at the earliest, maybe dated in August and closed them in July."
"6097270","6101170"," That X date could be this week or it could be that far out."
"6101290","6101870"," Believe it or not. "
"6104030","6107670"," I don't know that it is that far away, but just for safety's sake."
"6116250","6125570"," There is one more risk to the market."
"6128610","6130090"," We'll talk about that right now. "
"6130230","6139010"," This is kind of like complicated, not complicated, but it ties into, it depends on papers out."
"6155930","6157550"," It depends on papers out."
"6166590","6169330"," Let me just see if I can get this for you. "
"6185010","6185810"," There it is."
"6186910","6189350"," Just so you don't think I'm just talking shit out of my ass."
"6191170","6198850"," I don't always show you guys everything, but I'm going to post it here. "
"6200330","6206510"," This is an article from the WhiteHouse.gov. It's official."
"6207590","6210770"," It's not just some guy on Fintuit blasting you up with a bunch of bullshit."
"6213430","6219930"," Open this link into a tab and read it tonight or something like that so you can consume it. "
"6220030","6221910"," Some of you probably already read this, but some of you probably didn't."
"6222270","6223530"," I'm going to give you an idea of this."
"6229880","6234180"," If you're going to expect that vol at some point, you're going to place a trade for that"
"6234180","6234680"," volatility. "
"6235280","6237700"," Usually, even if it doesn't happen, we'll do it anyways."
"6239120","6242940"," If a bank is, if Jamie Diamond's position for it, he's at least going to get his money back."
"6249310","6251350"," They don't actually care if it happens or not. "
"6251510","6252690"," They care more about making the money."
"6253010","6253650"," It's always about the money."
"6261200","6262560"," I'm still flat right now. "
"6262640","6263120"," I'm watching this."
"6263120","6266200"," I want to see this white line across the red line."
"6266940","6268440"," Green bars start heading up. "
"6268600","6274980"," Out of 100 equaling greed and the crypto-faring greed index 52 out of 100 equaling neutral."
"6279480","6282640"," Keep my eyes on the one minute chart here and just keep an eye on this."
"6285400","6295000"," Target above here is 4.12.05. If"
"6295000","6302390"," price can stay above this, that's a bull playing alert. "
"6303690","6307890"," If price can stay above right now where we are, it has to stay above."
"6308870","6309350"," It's the rule."
"6310710","6314550"," The price target to the upside is 4.12.02 or so. "
"6314770","6318470"," Right roughly that basically just call it 4.12. Not that high, right?"
"6320430","6321430"," It's like right here."
"6326750","6329330"," If it breaks above 4.12, we're going to squeeze."
"6330170","6337790"," Your target right now is, believe it or not, just 4.12. If at any point we break above 4 "
"6337790","6340070",".12, we're going to go and close those gaps up there. "
"6341470","6346370"," If we're able to break up here and then hold this, 4.12, the next move up is right there."
"6347210","6351230"," If we can't hold this, we will roll back down and see that hourly trigger down there."
"6358230","6359730"," Let's go back to the conversation. "
"6360350","6363310"," You've got the volatility for that event."
"6363610","6364770"," One way or another, they're going to see it."

"6428160","6429700"," I'm like, I got to wait a minute here, bro."
"6431860","6432600"," Hold on."
"6435480","6439420"," It's like the alerts telling me it's like just go long right now by zero dates. "

"6487850","6490550"," 2011, the standard pour is downgraded."
"6493610","6495470"," US is credit rating. "
"6496690","6499450"," That's when we saw the big rollover in the market."
"6503790","6505430"," Yeah, we got close, right?"
"6506370","6506990"," In 2011."
"6507690","6511610"," I can't believe this part I'm going to talk to you about. "
"6511610","6514290"," Was I know there's people out there that are like, yeah, there's militant."
"6516030","6519430"," Senators out there that would like nothing more than."
"6524550","6527170"," To see all this doom and gloom take place, right?"
"6527790","6530130"," That's sailing not an agreement not to be reached and. "
"6536450","6542790"," You know, that post they or that link I just shared with you gave gives projections on what would"
"6542790","6543150"," happen."
"6546960","6551380"," And in those projections, you know, if the government were to default for even a week."
"6552880","6555440"," 500,000 Americans would lose their jobs. "
"6558660","6561240"," If we defaulted for three months."
"6562440","6565180"," They could tip the country into a full recession, you know."
"6569520","6574120"," We're millions will lose their jobs millions of people so that unemployment rate stuff that I was"
"6574120","6576060"," talking about earlier this morning would come into play. "
"6577240","6579400"," You'd see a rampant unemployment in this country."
"6579960","6583140"," I'm sure there's some people out there that would like nothing less than to see that happen."
"6584160","6586500"," I don't entertain that personally. "
"6586500","6596440"," I feel like that's a fever dream by people that just want pure anarchy."
"6598100","6599440"," I don't personally see it."
"6599540","6603680"," I see I think it's a it's a death nail for politically. "
"6604020","6604580"," It's a death now."
"6606580","6610320"," I think people like the cons are I think that there's people out there."
"6611120","6613880"," Like that like the fantasy idea of that. "
"6616600","6622160"," But I but so many people are financially iterate illiterate that they don't realize the implication"
"6622160","6622760"," of that."
"6627230","6631720"," Even just three months forget forget like the Mad Max scenario."
"6635090","6638150"," You're talking like 1930s kind of shit. "
"6639500","6640590"," You know what I mean?"
"6641310","6642290"," Just three months."
"6644830","6647390"," So I put that chance at."
"6648690","6652510"," I'll give it five percent like tail risk five percent. "
"6657210","6661750"," I think the political fallout from it would be game changing."
"6664730","6670170"," You're talking about an entire and it's weird too because like Jamie Diamond doesn't want to see"
"6670170","6670370"," this."
"6671050","6673870"," He wants to see the volatility but he doesn't want to see it. "
"6674110","6675890"," You guys might may or may not know this."
"6676950","6680870"," Like Jamie Diamond and none of these guys want to see that actually take place."
"6682510","6685270"," I don't know if you know that or not but they don't want to see that. "
"6686210","6690490"," They like a market believe it or not that goes sideways and up and has a little bit of volatility"
"6690490","6691250"," to the downside."
"6692310","6694810"," They like the idea of rolling the market over slowly too."
"6695890","6699890"," They don't like seeing like no one no one including Jamie not none of these banks want to see like"
"6699890","6700930"," straight to depths of hell. "
"6701550","6705330"," I know contrary to popular belief they don't like seeing that."
"6708550","6716670"," So just be aware that that you know like the fallout from from that situation would be political"
"6716670","6717250"," suicide."
"6719450","6721330"," And the markets don't like it. "
"6722170","6723250"," Markets don't like it."
"6723410","6724250"," People don't like it."
"6726530","6728710"," It's just not like it's not on the radar. "
"6729350","6734650"," It's more like it's more like a talk for people like like people like reporters need something to"
"6734650","6735110"," talk about."
"6736590","6739150"," Politicians need something to rile up their base about."
"6741230","6742330"," No one wants that. "
"6742450","6745530"," If they wanted that they would just fucking remove all the money from the stock market and we"
"6745530","6746330"," crashed to zero."
"6747370","6749230"," You'd have panic selling in the market."
"6753750","6760050"," If Jamie Diamond thought that was real we would cascade to the depths of hell like last week. "
"6762850","6768910"," I mean that's the kind of panic not the kind of panic that Jamie Diamonds talking to you about kind"
"6768910","6772590"," of he's talking to you about is just the event volatility."
"6773290","6775030"," But they want to get paid for it no matter what."
"6780040","6782540"," And I'm sure behind closed doors everybody knows. "
"6783120","6788660"," With their full week bill auction selling at $35 billion for the prior."
"6789040","6798960"," It's cover of two to 51 and a prior average yield of five, but a 4% that they're not"
"6798960","6799720"," going to default."
"6800100","6802840"," But for any of you out there that want to read that stuff just in case it ever happens. "
"6802920","6805840"," If there's a 0.5 or 0.05% chance of it happening."
"6807580","6810640"," I just gave you the paper so you can read it and you can read."
"6810640","6811340"," It's big doom. "
"6811720","6814420"," Like it's pretty do me."
"6816460","6819540"," But you at least have the data in case it ever happened."
"6819640","6822500"," If there was that 0.05% chance that it happened and it actually happened. "
"6822740","6823600"," Then there it is."
"6823720","6824300"," I gave it to you."
"6824880","6825860"," You didn't already have it. "
"6825900","6826480"," You have it now."
"6830510","6833230"," I mean that's like some that's like worse than covid."
"6834750","6835150"," Basically. "
"6836990","6840590"," It's like you're like it's like you're like yeah you know what if covid wasn't enough."
"6842230","6844730"," We're going to we're going to introduce something worse."
"6847650","6850150"," That's the logic behind that actually happening. "
"6861240","6862560"," Yeah it's fever dreaming."
"6865640","6867440"," Yeah there will be panic selling."
"6867660","6868380"," I agree with you move. "
"6868760","6872080"," Like I agree that there will be panic selling and that like they're going to get paid on that."
"6872840","6874860"," Price matters though where that is."
"6875820","6877240"," How you structure that trade matters. "
"6879340","6881120"," What that x state is matters."
"6883380","6884960"," What the x state is for everybody."
"6885220","6887720"," I was thinking like a couple months ago I was talking to guys about this. "
"6887880","6890780"," And I was they were like oh it's going to happen in early June mid-June."
"6892480","6897240"," And my my positive was well then that means everybody knows to sell June right."
"6898640","6899920"," 2011 that's what it happened. "
"6900120","6901280"," I think too so."
"6902080","6905600"," Do they do they wait an extra week or do they or they front run it."
"6908640","6911320"," I doubt they do it right at the same time this time. "
"6913080","6915040"," It's never at the same time right."
"6915820","6917020"," It can't be that obvious."
"6920000","6920600"," Oh. "
"6922600","6924320"," Time is right now 11 22."
"6925680","6930460"," We just got a new low here at 11 21."
"6931560","6934200"," Bulls must get a new high. "
"6934200","6936360"," By 11 30."
"6943620","6945260"," Bulls ain't got a lot of time here."
"6946520","6949540"," Time's not on a bull's side next eight minutes need a new high. "
"6955470","6957470"," You know if the feds already doing their job."
"6957730","6962230"," If the feds do in there like you've got these systems in place to do their job and then you're"
"6962230","6962810"," going to be like hey."
"6963430","6966630"," Like you're going to have like someone in the back room somewhere going. "
"6969690","6973810"," Hello Mr. Powell we're about to did you do your job."
"6974030","6975430"," No we're going to do it for you."
"6978830","6981110"," You know we have that saying about the fed. "
"6982850","6986770"," Going overboard right whether whether they're putting money in the market or taking money out of"
"6986770","6986990"," the market."
"6986990","6987990"," This isn't even overboard."
"6988290","6989630"," This would be like nuking. "
"6991470","6993850"," What was the point of even tightening."
"6994570","6995990"," It could have just waited for the debt ceiling."
"6996650","7000630"," It wouldn't have mattered where we were if we if we default in the debt. "
"7000950","7004090"," We could we should have just ran this shit up another 5,000 points."
"7005870","7008130"," And waited to default in the debt."
"7008470","7009390"," That was the plan. "
"7015420","7017000"," That's how crazy it is."
"7030240","7032820"," Yeah the shutdowns can have an impact as well."
"7034860","7036340"," I should address that too. "
"7072790","7074710"," Just grinding sideways right now."
"7078490","7082790"," I don't want to see where we have the bulls have five more minutes."
"7082790","7084310"," They have to get a new high here. "
"7087930","7088450"," 1115."
"7089950","7093470"," No new high for the bulls starting to turn bears right now."
"7095890","7097250"," Five more minutes for the bulls. "
"7112950","7115470"," Yes by options trader making a very good point."
"7115850","7119410"," June is a non earnings month and can be a pivot low month for the year."
"7120290","7122790"," Pivot lows are around third to fourth week of the month. "
"7123090","7124430"," If you look back in time on the spy."
"7126370","7130390"," So if you're to place that trade you want to leave if you want to leave enough time on it"
"7130390","7131650"," right depending on how it's structured."
"7133830","7135530"," So you can capture that June low. "
"7139310","7146290"," Fish racing some spreads do very well timing it right to the end of its life some spreads do better"
"7146290","7148430"," with more time on them."
"7156350","7162530"," Yeah I agree Damien like I'm not on that train like I just I can't be on that train."
"7163510","7165550"," I agree with you Damien like it's. "

"7173590","7176070"," not sponsored by to the tick."
"7178870","7185360"," Their stream is but not my stream."
"7189380","7190740"," I don't get paid by them. "
"7201250","7205850"," It's like a moving target right now it's June first is the likely target."
"7207110","7209030"," It's a moving up move it's a moving target."
"7209470","7213130"," Not only that though they can they can extend it they can extend it into September. "
"7214290","7219210"," So we get the four week bill auction with a party could be as cover of two to fifty one"
"7219210","7222390"," and a prior high rate of five but eight four percent."
"7249430","7253770"," They're chatting the most us days are still on track to meet or exceed year in budget forecasts."
"7270460","7273240"," We've got the euro close coming up right now baby. "

"7455850","7460430"," Four twelve C's now traded seventy three cents they were fifty two just a moment ago now trading"
"7460430","7461230"," seventy four cents. "
"7462870","7473890"," If you"
"7473890","7477010"," can't get bills you're probably using the wrong broker I'll be honest with you."
"7484470","7488870"," If you if you're if you can't call your broker don't use them."
"7489530","7492090"," You should be able to pick up the phone and have someone on the phone and say. "
"7493150","7495510"," I got a problem not only that."
"7496390","7500670"," If you have any problems like with trades executing not executing any kind of technical"
"7500670","7501230"," difficulties."

"7507890","7509630"," If you have any technical difficulties."
"7510590","7516270"," You should be able to call your broker and say hey this fucked up on this need my money back"
"7516270","7517790"," believe it or not."
"7517790","7520670"," And they'll give it back to you not you know I can't abuse that shit but. "
"7521310","7524770"," Like once a year once every three years you're like hey man this shit wasn't working."
"7525910","7528990"," Now the interface on my on my platform wasn't working."
"7529550","7532970"," I'm hitting the fucking sell button and it's not working or the buy button or whatever it's not the"
"7532970","7533470"," buy button. "

"7536470","7541570"," You can be like hey I bought something at 50 cents and I went up to 75 and trying to"
"7541570","7542150"," fucking sell."
"7543710","7545090"," Or it went down to 25. "
"7546710","7551550"," I'm trying to hit the cell and it's not registering like it's not like it'll sometimes you'll see"

"7559370","7559810"," money here."
"7561410","7562710"," They'll accommodate you. "
"7564910","7567970"," So if you're broke if you can't call your broker and get some on the phone immediately."
"7569070","7570190"," That's a bad sign."
"7571630","7572390"," Number two. "

"7579150","7586430"," In direct bid 43.3% of the direct bid or 5.2%. Don't tell people this do not repeat"

"7592610","7593550"," Do not repeat this."
"7597390","7598150"," Huddle around. "
"7599830","7604370"," If you're looking for a trade right with like multi leg trade you can probably call your broker and"
"7604370","7605110"," get a better price."
"7609080","7612720"," You'll be like hey I'm putting some size on right here and there's any way for you to fill me"
"7612720","7613400"," at this price."
"7616440","7619960"," That's like placing a trade once a week or once a month or something like that. "
"7621420","7625800"," Sometimes they won't but the good broker will especially doing business over time with them."
"7643190","7647650"," Don't tell anybody don't go fucking tell on your friends like keep that shit in your pocket."

"7681690","7688210"," I mean this is what frustrates me is that you do a really good job of introducing someone."
"7691030","7694210"," To the market and I got no problem with that like."
"7698770","7703130"," You're not going to make I'll be honest with you there's not much the outside of buying a home. "
"7703790","7707490"," Maybe I was talking to a guy after the close yesterday and."
"7709330","7711550"," Like your biggest investment is likely a home."
"7713230","7718930"," Your second biggest investment is probably going to be not a 401k believe it or not. "
"7720070","7722750"," It would probably be you."
"7724210","7726710"," Instead of moving up in quality of house."
"7727170","7728970"," So here's a here's an insight for you. "
"7731590","7733630"," To it we're talking yesterday buddy of mine."
"7736350","7738270"," And when I listen to a young person."
"7739590","7740670"," They have valid points. "
"7741950","7746490"," They're like look my dollar doesn't go like as far as it did for you when you were younger."
"7746730","7748750"," Nor your father nor your father's father."
"7749590","7750850"," I'm like I agree with that. "
"7753930","7757470"," My education costs more than it did for you I agree with that."
"7760710","7763890"," Competition is worse than it was for you I agree with that."
"7766690","7772370"," Insurance medical all the costs all the bullshit that they're all the like scheming to get every"
"7772370","7773070"," dollar out of you. "
"7773310","7780630"," This from the government down to companies all like I was thinking about like I could probably pay."
"7781550","7785030"," Two or three hundred bucks a month alone in just subscriptions for newspapers."
"7785030","7787470"," I mean everybody's got their fucking hand out like. "
"7789050","7790610"," No that then you've got Google."
"7792010","7798150"," Like just pushes like here here you want to read Google news well fuck you too every single link is"
"7798150","7799050"," to a paid subscription."
"7802410","7807610"," So like there's a grift everything's a fucking grift out there everything you do is a grift right"
"7807610","7811550"," so when a young person tells me like I'm getting fucked sideways I'm like yeah I agree. "
"7814630","7816190"," You are getting fucked sideways."
"7821250","7825690"," It's fine the bitch about it but I know you don't vote."
"7827310","7831590"," I know you don't vote I know you don't run I know you don't take over political parties. "
"7832570","7835690"," I don't care if you're public or Democrat and you don't care you just don't."
"7837650","7843050"," So you know that's not doing it for you you could spend your entire young adulthood bitching."
"7843050","7851850"," And you in the the bitches valid but you could spend your entire like 20s 30s just bitching about"
"7851850","7852050"," it. "
"7853070","7856430"," You can even go bitch about it and vote and nothing changes for you."
"7857490","7862290"," Now you can do all that but if you do all that and don't do something about it for yourself"
"7862290","7864630"," nobody else is going to do it for you."
"7865510","7870130"," So you can still do that shit you can vote you can try to make a change you can cry"
"7870130","7871350"," on Reddit whatever you want to do. "
"7871350","7876530"," But the truth is that you will wake up two decades later and you'll have nothing."
"7879030","7883430"," Or you're going to pay too much for a house you're going to be a slave to a wage."
"7886090","7888710"," And if you get hurt and sick you're going to lose everything eventually. "
"7888950","7892550"," So you're fucked anyways right so my point here to you is."
"7895890","7902370"," Instead of watching TikTok or or Reddit or whatever because I'll then ask people like a young"
"7902370","7905190"," person I'll say to a person okay I agree with your bitches and your complaints."
"7906310","7910830"," I'll say what do you want and they're like well I want a good job to pay as well and"
"7910830","7912290"," I want a great man I want a nice car. "
"7912790","7916990"," I want to be able to drive a Toyota or a Honda Ford a Honda Toyota I want to be"
"7916990","7920410"," able to have kids or you know live in a nice area."
"7920410","7926090"," I want to be living live in like Manhattan or Beverly Hills or the beach or a ski town or"
"7926090","7926370"," wherever."
"7927250","7932170"," Well Mike that's all asking a lot I want to have insurance I want to live in a community that"
"7932170","7937890"," you know like these I can't afford a $350,000 house or a $500,000 house I can never get"
"7937890","7938170"," in there. "
"7938830","7943610"," I'm like yeah I agree with all that the truth is even even though you're getting fucked everywhere"
"7943610","7946330"," it's kind of out of the realm."
"7948490","7952810"," Your expectation so even though you're getting fucked you're also your expectations are really"
"7952810","7954710"," weird in bizarre."
"7957370","7965090"," When you're young sometimes you have to accept that you're you can only afford $250,000 or $150,000"
"7965090","7967850"," or $100,000 or maybe 50 grand. "
"7967850","7974150"," And you can bitch and wine right all you want but you're not going to be able to get by"
"7974150","7976110"," in life if you don't do something on your own."
"7976350","7980910"," So if you go to some community it might not be a beach town but if you go to some"
"7980910","7986410"," other place and you buy a house that's 50 grand or 100 grand you live within your means what you"
"7986410","7987030"," can afford."
"7988950","7993430"," Maybe this place has the potential to grow maybe you can tell your buddies and friends in college"
"7993430","7995970"," or tech school hey you should move up the road for me. "
"7996810","8002470"," And you can make actual change in your community now these expensive communities are overpriced"
"8002470","8009430"," they did build build infrastructure they built schools they built highways and good water systems"
"8009430","8016030"," and made sure that there's proper funding for infrastructure."
"8017310","8018470"," That shit costs money."
"8020930","8024790"," So if you find someplace where you're a part of building that somewhere in the US. "
"8025910","8027930"," You're not going to want to give that up one day either."
"8028170","8030050"," You can be like hey man I spent all these years."
"8031030","8035290"," I was a part of the community I made a change at the school board I made a change in"
"8035290","8035750"," my neighborhood. "
"8036690","8037650"," I picked up the trash."
"8040090","8045710"," Like I'm not religious kids are like I'm not like yeah but you did you form a community center for"
"8045710","8051070"," this or for that doesn't be religious in the past people people made churches and stuff like that"
"8051070","8052550"," but you can have your own communities."
"8053490","8058790"," You know center of community stuff like that so like the bitches fine I get it but there's an"
"8058790","8064230"," opportunity here for you to live within your means the key point behind this reason I'm saying this"
"8064230","8064570"," because. "
"8066290","8069050"," You're no matter what your financial situation is."
"8070070","8074870"," No matter what your background is like I went to high school I sucked at it."
"8075910","8078870"," Or I wanted to be a plumber I wanted to be this or that. "
"8079450","8080430"," Oh yeah baby give me a squeeze."
"8082410","8083690"," Key point here is that."
"8085090","8087950"," Do they tag that for 12 almost to the pin look at that. "
"8087950","8093790"," Four eleven ninety six tagged it four cents off do we get four twelve flat."
"8099950","8101650"," Missed it by four pennies."
"8106750","8110750"," Next target above four twelve point ten. "
"8111830","8112930"," Right up here."
"8118690","8120230"," Right there next target."
"8122390","8123370"," Right there. "
"8128150","8132630"," My point here though is it doesn't matter what your background is you can afford a house somewhere."
"8133950","8136790"," I bet you could look all over the country like my credit sucks cap."
"8137490","8138550"," I bet you can get. "
"8139350","8143510"," I used to buy these and flip these actually land contracts on houses."
"8144010","8147110"," I used to let them assume the risk and I would flip them."
"8147630","8151090"," But you can buy a house on a land contract if you need to probably not the best place you"
"8151090","8152950"," want to live but it's available to you. "
"8154630","8156010"," There is options for you."
"8156510","8160970"," Now the key point here is that if you want that leg up in life you can bitch moan you"
"8160970","8161330"," can vote."
"8162030","8166430"," You can cry and write it whatever you want to do but you have to still still like get a"
"8166430","8167870"," leg up for yourself at the same time. "
"8168370","8174550"," And it might not be Santa Monica California or I don't know some some really nice place right you"
"8174550","8175030"," name it."
"8175710","8182810"," Whatever you live right it might not be a tidy island or I don't know the Cape in Massachusetts."
"8186970","8188330"," But you have a chance. "
"8190350","8193770"," And that first investment that you have that first house right."
"8195469","8197889"," Some people think yeah it's my retirement fund in my house."
"8198610","8203510"," The second best investment that you can do is you take that house and instead of moving up into a"
"8203510","8209889"," nicer house instead of like Hey I'm moving on up into my starter home for $100,000 now a $250 "
"8209889","8210670",",000 home. "
"8211530","8219370"," You can actually mortgage that house up that you bought and roll it into a second home that you"
"8219370","8220230"," could turn into a rental."
"8221950","8227990"," An Airbnb if you like I'm against landlords okay buy a commercial property."
"8230190","8235850"," Mortgage mortgage that house instead of getting a brand spanking new kitchen that someone else is"
"8235850","8236389"," going to rip out. "
"8237590","8239930"," Or or trying to up move on up."
"8240389","8244549"," You live in that house that started home you take that money and you put it into a commercial"
"8244549","8245010"," property."
"8245750","8249570"," I don't know laundromat a car wash a storage facility. "
"8250270","8254770"," If you get like 10 friends you can probably buy one of those bigger ones right."
"8255330","8257650"," Like hey we're going to pull all our money and we're going to buy one of these things."
"8260840","8263240"," That's probably your second biggest investment you can make in mind. "
"8266590","8274209"," You know all that hard work will eventually help you to pay down bad debt take on good debt that"
"8274209","8274850"," pays you back."
"8276510","8282150"," If you have a job and you're paying off your mortgage if you lose your job your mortgage can't pay"
"8282150","8282950"," for your mortgage right."
"8283770","8287350"," If you can if you've got a mortgage and you're paying it down with your job and then you can"
"8287350","8294150"," take the equity in your home and roll it into a commercial building someone else is now paying your"
"8294150","8295650"," your mortgage does that make sense. "
"8298750","8304309"," In building you equity and you're not doing all the hard work for you already broke your ass."
"8307389","8308770"," To get the benefit of that."
"8311490","8313650"," And the shocker about this too is. "
"8315290","8317410"," You can be living it up in a nice community."
"8318590","8323290"," But if you go buy a house that's 150,000 or 250,000 or 50,000 or 100,000 whatever"
"8323290","8323590"," it is."
"8323590","8328910"," You actually have more disposable income to do nice things. "
"8331049","8336610"," You can now fly around and spend a week in New York with a bunch of cash."
"8337969","8338990"," You can go to Mexico."
"8339889","8340610"," You can go to Europe. "
"8341389","8342010"," You can go wherever you want."
"8343770","8347290"," Instead of paying that high price to live there you can go piss away a bunch of money."
"8348750","8351070"," You can fly back to your sleepy bedroom community somewhere. "
"8357209","8360090"," You can get fights now or on the country for what a hundred bucks around trip."
"8361389","8362790"," You can go skiing anywhere you want."
"8375790","8377010"," Yeah I know I get it Joe. "
"8378290","8382750"," You know what the thing is too is you have to have empathy and identify with these kids."
"8382969","8384370"," They have the right point."
"8384850","8385410"," They make sense. "
"8386670","8388090"," I mean I'm not just disagreeing with them."
"8388190","8388810"," I agree with these kids."
"8389130","8390510"," I agree with them all day long and I do. "
"8390930","8392510"," Like truly believe that what they're saying."
"8395820","8400960"," I promise you a lot of these communities that these children are young people not children but"
"8400960","8401460"," young adults."
"8401940","8403900"," Like I want to be able to afford that nice community. "
"8404120","8406220"," I'm like dude there was a time when that community was a shit hole."
"8407060","8407860"," Or it was undeveloped."
"8410550","8411790"," We don't tell kids that. "
"8412230","8417930"," We don't tell kids that Manhattan is bad but it was really bad at one time."
"8419910","8422510"," We don't tell them that Boston used to have a combat zone."
"8422670","8425550"," People would run around machine guns and rocket launchers and hand grenades and shit. "
"8426410","8432410"," Pussycat faders and people are like look at Philadelphia and all the drug users right."
"8433110","8434470"," I walk in the streets of Philly."
"8434630","8435550"," I'm like that ain't shit. "
"8436070","8439490"," If you look back in the 70s US was a shit hole."
"8441090","8441910"," There's a shit hole."
"8442290","8443210"," I'd say it's a shit hole. "
"8447870","8449530"," I figure shit hole that it is now."
"8456350","8457670"," We don't tuck kids that either."
"8457870","8459990"," Like just pull up your bootstraps. "
"8460290","8462530"," You shouldn't do that as an adult to a young adult."
"8463250","8465430"," You have to be like get the empathizer and be like I know I get it."
"8465650","8465930"," You're fucked. "
"8466370","8471810"," Make some change but at the same time don't get left behind either."
"8472390","8478850"," Because that's the scary part is if you get left behind you're not going to have a good time."
"8480230","8483750"," And your parent might tell you that they're going to help you when they get older. "
"8485170","8489470"," But a lot of our system is structured to take all of their money."
"8490050","8492110"," You're like hey my parents did well."
"8492630","8494110"," I'm going to inherit their money someday. "
"8494970","8496270"," You think you're the smart kid."
"8496470","8499010"," You're like my parents are going to leave me something."
"8499010","8500070"," I'm going to get a leg up one day. "
"8500230","8500930"," I'll tell you the truth."
"8502250","8503910"," There are adults out there."
"8505350","8506330"," Older than you. "
"8507890","8509650"," In politics and in companies."
"8511010","8513010"," That want your parents money as well."
"8514590","8516930"," And they'll do whatever they can do to get it from you. "
"8520160","8520820"," They'll do it."
"8520980","8522340"," I want to talk to you guys about something here."
"8522520","8523320"," So just a heads up here. "
"8523420","8525100"," We have a I want to show you guys something here."
"8527740","8529620"," So there's a five minute chart here okay."
"8531160","8533040"," I don't think personally this happens. "
"8533280","8534140"," I'm going to warn you or something."
"8535120","8536220"," Now if it does it does."
"8537860","8539940"," But this five minute right here on the spy. "
"8541000","8542280"," I need to see proof of this."
"8545170","8547110"," This will be an explosive move up."
"8547370","8549350"," If this is a three trigger cluster. "
"8552040","8552880"," Full cluster."
"8556570","8557370"," That's forming."
"8564740","8565540"," To the upside. "
"8567780","8573060"," And I assure you that there is a hedge fund out there probably watching this program right now."
"8573620","8576740"," As we know had some hedge funders watch this program we actually know that."
"8578060","8579680"," But they don't want to see this here. "
"8585600","8588660"," Because this will rip some faces up."
"8588800","8589880"," This is very powerful in here."
"8589880","8592480"," You have the hourly the one minute and the five minute. "
"8592920","8594040"," If this happens."
"8594960","8597720"," This could also be a bull trap that rolls right down."
"8598480","8601100"," I know south side knows if we get above right here. "
"8602020","8603940"," It's going to be a it's going to get nasty."
"8604160","8605620"," It's going to go violent to the to the upside."
"8606280","8607980"," We will close these gaps up here. "
"8609760","8610860"," I don't see the fuel."
"8613560","8615460"," There's a trade in here from here to here."
"8615880","8617020"," It's on a one minute chart. "
"8617020","8619960"," There is a trade here right now it's very bullish."
"8622280","8625900"," Like this here is very bullish to get up here into this."
"8627060","8628260"," Like blast up here. "
"8630280","8633460"," But does it hold as the question or does it you know we start to make that."
"8636760","8639620"," So I'm not in anything right now I want to I want to buy some right now but."
"8641640","8643200"," Series of higher lows right here. "
"8643960","8645980"," Don't get trapped in here if it rolls down on you."
"8648360","8651480"," This could last for days like two three days to the upside."
"8651520","8653380"," So we'll see how it plays out. "
"8656060","8660360"," So I point to you is like if you if you know a young person out there."
"8661060","8662940"," You should empathize with them agree with them."
"8663020","8664180"," I agree with them. "
"8664180","8667740"," Give them the tools to make things better for themselves."
"8668020","8670860"," But at the same time don't let them get left behind either because you know."
"8672160","8676500"," And you know a decade or two past and they get left behind they have nothing to. "
"8677540","8678780"," To have when they get older."
"8680360","8683460"," And there's you know evil people out there that are going to take your parents money."
"8684000","8685740"," The government is one of them. "
"8686800","8688760"," The reverse mortgage people are another one."
"8690400","8693900"," If your parents ever get sick like let's say they live in the people live older."
"8694060","8696820"," So like you get an old person they live to like 80 90. "
"8698600","8702060"," And people today they're alive today are expected to live into their 80s and 90s."
"8704280","8707320"," If they ever get to a point where they need to be taken care of by the state."
"8707600","8711820"," The state's going to force a lot of them to get rid of any wealth they have. "
"8713100","8716320"," They'll actually take their money away from give me all your money and we'll take care of you the"

"8934630","8935330"," We're going to blast higher. "
"8938650","8941590"," At 11.30, we got some new high it looks like."
"8943170","8950370"," Got another new high at 11.44. Bulls have another five minutes to get a new high here."
"8950750","8953770"," This is the exact same thing that happened down here way to see something. "
"8955370","8957550"," When I was counting off new new lows."
"8958710","8961970"," Right here, I'm counting off new highs up here for bulls."
"8963730","8965110"," Every 15 minutes. "
"8966430","8971750"," We know that a stock market hour goes from 9.30 to 10.30 to 11.30 to 12.30"
"8971750","8973610"," all the way up to 4.30 in the afternoon."
"8974410","8976810"," We know the quarter hour quarter hours matter."

"8981490","8983390"," Now we're coming into the hour 12 o'clock. "
"8983630","8985450"," Bulls must get a new high here."
"8995100","8996140"," Come on bulls."
"8998580","9000100"," Saying that right now. "
"9002480","9004760"," This is a one minute day trader chart."
"9006640","9008480"," Just like the VIX earlier, right?"
"9009300","9011060"," This looks like the VIX earlier, doesn't it?"
"9013500","9018610"," You need this to come up."
"9020610","9021630"," This to come up. "
"9022870","9028450"," You need price to break out above."
"9029570","9030590"," Come back and check it."
"9030670","9031630"," We go up from here. "
"9033190","9037470"," That's $12.12. Can't reverse here any of that kind of nonsense."
"9038110","9041990"," If price gets above this hourly trigger, we go up in a big way."
"9043710","9046970"," We're going to look at it in a 30 minute chart and see if the way is up here. "
"9052450","9052890"," Hmm."
"9053970","9054930"," Indecisive right now."
"9055050","9056310"," The five minute says yes. "
"9056910","9058230"," Five minutes as we're going up here."
"9062770","9064090"," I just don't know how long it lasts."
"9065090","9066570"," VIX rolling over right now. "
"9066710","9067590"," This is good for bulls."
"9068670","9070490"," VIX beginning to roll over right now."
"9071910","9074770"," We should get a squeeze here for at least five minutes. "
"9079050","9081390"," The hourly is like, yeah, it looks okay."
"9081530","9082210"," It doesn't look great."
"9083210","9088610"," I want to see some proof in the pudding that bulls can get above here and hold this. "
"9093040","9095260"," I think the sellers are hiding up here."
"9101670","9103530"," There's a one minute chart right now we're on."
"9107010","9108970"," Maybe I can catch a liquidation break here. "
"9116780","9120280"," Four 12 C's are 66 cents, 65 cents."
"9120400","9121040"," I'm looking at them again."
"9131250","9132270"," You know, I want to see. "
"9133790","9136390"," I want to see a bloodbath in the VIX to the downside."
"9145250","9151210"," So I guess the conversation I was having after market hours was if you're older."
"9152570","9155830"," Do a solid for a young person like listen to them. "
"9158870","9162770"," Empathize with them, identify with their concerns, validate their concerns."
"9163070","9163630"," I think they're right."
"9163810","9165970"," I don't I think the data suggests that they're correct. "
"9167730","9170150"," But try to try to guide them to."
"9172810","9174470"," You know, two fold."
"9174830","9175630"," This is how you fight it. "
"9175630","9177710"," And also this is how you get ahead of it."
"9177910","9181330"," For second straight week and drop to six four three five percent."
"9182230","9185690"," You know, just dismissing a young person is counter. "
"9187250","9188730"," Productive for our society."
"9189150","9190710"," Six four three five percent."
"9191610","9194910"," Compared to six four three nine percent of the prior week according to Freddie Mac. "
"9195930","9199790"," You're trying to be or you know, if you want to be a lot of people like you like."
"9200130","9202510"," Like pick up your bootstrap shit like that does."
"9202510","9203350"," That's not good enough. "
"9203350","9205250"," Like, especially if you're that person, if you like."
"9205470","9208130"," Kids are just lazy or kids just expect things."
"9208510","9210210"," I get that feeling from an adult. "
"9211210","9217750"," But the truth is if you want to see those kids pick up their bootstraps, you don't just like"
"9217750","9218450"," dismiss them."
"9218570","9220050"," You say, Hey, man, let me give you a hand."
"9220130","9220330"," Oh, me. "
"9221870","9226650"," You know, I try to help you to do that or show you the way that you can get those"
"9226650","9226910"," things."
"9228650","9229790"," They really do need it."
"9229910","9231210"," Like young people need that support. "
"9232550","9236010"," Even if it's just your your wisdom that you have as an older person."
"9239570","9242890"," And maybe they'll have to pass that along to some other kid when they're young."
"9243050","9246630"," You know, you want your kids or kids or young people that you see. "
"9246850","9250710"," You want them to have, you don't want those kids tell on their next generation."
"9251790","9257190"," Pull up your bootstraps because my this older person in my life told me, you know, fuck you, pull"
"9257190","9258210"," up bootstraps."
"9259270","9265850"," You want productive, you want younger adults to get a productive answer from an older person with"
"9265850","9266170"," wisdom. "
"9267170","9270370"," So that they continues on two or three generations down the road."
"9274350","9276970"," And we think about someone that's 20 right now."
"9277230","9281870"," What about the next generation of 20 year olds and the next generation of the that of 20 year olds. "
"9286630","9293970"," And you make a generation or two of very dissatisfied young people and that never leads to good,"
"9294150","9294270"," right?"
"9294550","9295210"," You know what I mean?"
"9295410","9297610"," Like I can have some real lasting consequences."
"9298890","9303870"," Rolling over right now, liquidation break, cell side saying, hell no."
"9306610","9308610"," I'm so glad I didn't buy any calls there. "
"9310530","9312750"," Cell sides like get out of here."
"9312750","9313630"," We ain't going up there."
"9313710","9314210"," Enough puts. "
"9314950","9320070"," A lot here."
"9322290","9324550"," Look at that dog shit right there."
"9325790","9328150"," It's like dog shit wrapped in cat shit right there. "
"9338770","9343530"," Ooh, I feel sad for anyone long calls right there."
"9348690","9350430"," Ooh, just trapping bulls."
"9354110","9355330"," Zigging and zagging. "
"9363330","9366130"," I always hate seeing these traps, man."
"9371370","9371750"," Ooh."
"9375150","9376870"," Bears are all fired up right now. "
"9376990","9378430"," They're like, Oh, yeah, baby."
"9385780","9387060"," Good trucking them bulls."
"9401610","9403410"," All right, so it's 1203. "
"9405650","9408950"," Failure to make a new high right there at 12 o'clock to see up here."
"9408970","9411610"," We had a failure to make a new high here to see you can see it."
"9412310","9413810"," That's where the high was right there. "
"9413810","9415610"," No high right here."
"9416570","9418410"," Bears are going to take over here."
"9418910","9420470"," They have 15 minutes here. "
"9425210","9426250"," The bears."
"9437450","9438490"," Chopfest, baby."
"9444630","9447850"," One good thing is we've got no volatility tomorrow, do we?"
"9448050","9450010"," Do we have anything lined up for volatility tomorrow?"
"9457590","9461410"," Does anybody out there, can anybody tell me if we have any volatility lined up for tomorrow, any"
"9461410","9462810"," real real volatility?"
"9464050","9466210"," You get a long weekend coming up here?"
"9467130","9467870"," That's volatility. "
"9470110","9474130"," You see like McCarthy and who's the Democrat?"
"9474490","9479670"," We'll pick like a Schumer will dig his hand out his buttons, smear poop all over the wall and"
"9479670","9481430"," McCarthy will do the same thing."
"9481610","9482790"," They'll paint pictures all weekend."
"9483970","9486890"," Like caveman drones with doom. "
"9490890","9491530"," I'll say this."
"9493330","9497210"," I would really, really would have liked to have seen."
"9497890","9504350"," I'll be honest, I would really like to have seen the stock or the VIX be at like 20. "
"9507530","9508010"," Into tomorrow."
"9512540","9516600"," It'd be calling up Joe Donut and Winky and being like dude VIX is at 20, dude."
"9516720","9518960"," We're going to rip some faces off into clothes tomorrow. "
"9534460","9536160"," Like kill the VIX on a Friday."
"9536400","9540360"," I always love killing the VIX on a Friday if we're like we've been bleeding out all week long."
"9544840","9545880"," Maybe we can go up today. "
"9546700","9548740"," That way we can sell the market on Friday."
"9550080","9555820"," I find it hard to believe that anybody's going to want to hold this shit over the weekend for the"
"9555820","9557840"," shit smearing on the debt ceiling over the weekend."
"9558400","9559300"," I mean they're going to have it out. "
"9559560","9560260"," I promise you."
"9562460","9564180"," Because we have OPEC's next week."
"9564540","9572880"," So you got like the collapsed subsellers and fee sellers are like I got all my paperwork here. "
"9574060","9576620"," Weekends coming up with a self-air all weekend."
"9576880","9578240"," We got OPEC's coming up next week."
"9579800","9581640"," I get it all lined up. "
"9582880","9585820"," We know that every day that passes is X day."
"9588200","9592240"," I'm going to make a video on Sunday about market crash on Monday."
"9592500","9594800"," And if that doesn't work, I'm going to make one next Sunday. "
"9601060","9602600"," Sunday, Sunday, Sunday."
"9611240","9613540"," I'm going to go with we go up today."
"9614820","9615800"," And then we sell Friday. "
"9623510","9624670"," That's my best guess."
"9624670","9628150"," Because we haven't been able to sell the freaking market."
"9628670","9629890"," We're going to go up today. "
"9630430","9631130"," We'll sell Friday."
"9634430","9638450"," We'll sell doom all Friday Monday in the next week."
"9647670","9651150"," Yeah, I think we usually like I always feel like we're not feel. "
"9651990","9654170"," If we're up all week, we usually sell Friday."
"9654390","9656090"," If we're down all week, we usually go up on Friday."
"9656250","9657670"," It's pretty pretty pretty consistent. "
"9658230","9659550"," Next week, we got some cool stuff."
"9659550","9660030"," Oh, shoot."
"9660210","9661190"," I got to go over some of you guys. "
"9662330","9663090"," I almost forgot."
"9668280","9668900"," Hold on here."
"9669020","9669500"," Hold on one second. "
"9669640","9670960"," I got to go potty real quick."
"9671040","9671520"," Hold on a second."
"9674860","9678360"," I want to take us some calls right now, but it's so bad. "
"9678540","9679600"," I want to take calls real bad."
"9689950","9691130"," I'll be right back in a second."
"9691410","9808660"," All right, I'm"
"9808660","9808880"," back. "
"9813950","9815630"," I got some money making for you."
"9824840","9827320"," Pull my hair off my ears here to put these headphones on."
"9830660","9832120"," Okay, I got some cool stuff for you. "
"9832960","9834400"," This is money making stuff."
"9852510","9853690"," This is a second here."
"9854070","9958360"," I don't know"
"9958360","9959600"," if you guys know this or not. "
"9964780","9969660"," I was talking to guys earlier about like where price matters today, like where we closed today."
"9969660","9972260"," I was talking about Vicks earlier and I was saying."
"9977480","9983380"," I would really like to see us like sell into Thursday, get the Vicks up to 20 so that Friday"
"9983380","9984280"," is an update, right?"
"9989200","9993580"," And normally Thursday is are an update, generally speaking they are. "
"9997330","10003270"," If Thursday is not an update, generally speaking Friday is."
"10007660","10009400"," So if we don't see it today."
"10009400","10011180"," I'm going to give you guys a gift today, okay?"
"10013820","10015480"," Pay attention closely. "
"10018120","10027290"," So price right now is that $4.1157. Let's look on May"
"10027290","10028430"," 12th."
"10033570","10035550"," 413s are 86 cents right now."
"10038150","10039230"," Right up here. "
"10041530","10043170"," Let's look at a five day chart."
"10055050","10056410"," Why is that not showing?"
"10059910","10061290"," I don't know why it's not showing."
"10062310","10065190"," I drew this in on another chart already or this morning. "
"10066790","10067550"," Or even open."
"10068910","10069210"," That's odd."
"10073250","10074450"," Whatever, we'll just draw this here. "
"10088610","10090350"," It was just a book map."
"10093070","10094710"," Keep your eyes right here."
"10106600","10108680"," That first one right here, we already had that one there. "
"10108760","10114780"," I drew this one in this morning on another instance of book map, not book map, but weevil, but I"
"10114780","10115060"," didn't."
"10115940","10116720"," I drew it up here."
"10118900","10121220"," I actually had it more symmetrical with this one here. "
"10121700","10122960"," This wasn't here when I drew it."
"10126240","10128280"," If we don't get an update on Thursday."
"10130280","10130980"," Okay, is it ready?"
"10131740","10133460"," Thursdays are normally up days. "
"10135100","10138080"," If Thursday is not an update, Friday usually is."
"10138280","10144520"," If you don't get an update on Thursday, so we can sell Friday, we get it down Thursday."
"10146140","10147380"," We'll typically get an update on Friday. "
"10149300","10152360"," Just keep your eyes on price today."
"10156590","10161990"," If you go down here at any point, there's probably a kick-ass trade in a Friday close over here"
"10161990","10162230"," somewhere."
"10165860","10168000"," Just like keep this on your radar here. "
"10169660","10171420"," They kind of down move here."
"10172140","10174180"," There's a possibility of having a kick-ass Friday."
"10181460","10183340"," Bears they told you are taking over here. "
"10186470","10190850"," If we get like this down on the drag's close down here, something like this."
"10194430","10200250"," I'd be interested in buying this either the open on Friday or even this close, depending on how"
"10200250","10200850"," deep it goes."
"10206690","10209250"," Now, if price holds here, right?"
"10210810","10212010"," And it doesn't go down. "
"10212150","10213210"," Let's say that's it invalid."
"10229240","10239170"," If price does hold here though, there'd be another sweet trade in a Friday to the"
"10239170","10239370"," upside."
"10244310","10245950"," Tag that for 18 or whatever. "
"10246910","10247450"," You know what I'm saying?"
"10249190","10250870"," To a monitor this Thursday here."
"10251570","10253570"," I'm going to expect today to be up, but it's not up."
"10253570","10255910"," So, we're not going to kill the Vicks. "
"10256610","10260970"," And if we're going to make the Vicks go down over here, then we can get the Vicks up there"
"10260970","10261710"," by close today."
"10273340","10275260"," And there's one other thing to say about this."
"10278080","10280500"," Tech zero dates are on Fridays, right?"
"10281200","10286420"," You get like weeklies on tech underlying tickers during the week and they're, you know, grinding"
"10286420","10290520"," them out, grinding them out, but then in Fridays, man, zero dates are where it's at. "
"10290520","10300200"," So, it's probably some kind of an upside move in here into Friday."
"10331640","10333300"," Thursday is usually an update."
"10346420","10348700"," Four 12s there, 55 cents again. "
"10349780","10351220"," Maybe they went down while I was taking a leak."
"10353660","10355840"," Maybe I'll start a small position to the upside."
"10366650","10369490"," I'm going to bet that we either close green today. "
"10391220","10393540"," Place a small bet that we're going to close green today."
"10396760","10406600"," But if it rolls down, probably going to buy this close that open tomorrow as"
"10406600","10407220"," well."
"10408120","10410340"," And then what they can do is they can worry about it all weekend. "
"10411420","10416520"," They can write their doom all like Saturday, Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, OPEC's week,"
"10416720","10417040"," next week."
"10417920","10419640"," We're going to talk about OPEC's as well right now."
"10442800","10444560"," Oh, I'm printing money right now. "
"10445120","10445960"," I'm printing some money."
"10447660","10448840"," I smell it."
"10449140","10451880"," I smell it. "
"10451960","10452420"," I smell it."
"10452420","10452540"," I smell it."
"10455800","10464330"," I'm going to put a money there. "
"10464430","10465390"," I'm making some money right there."
"10489130","10489570"," Whoa."
"10499810","10500250"," Ooh. "
"10534520","10536560"," I'm going to read to you a piece from a friend of mine."
"10543100","10547660"," I'm not going to give it to you because he charges for this and he doesn't charge a lot."
"10549640","10551140"," I want to say something out there. "
"10551260","10559040"," There are people out there that produce content that's worth paying for."
"10559400","10561180"," They put their time, effort, and energy into it."
"10561260","10562640"," I know this guy pursed him, friends with him. "
"10564000","10565600"," And he spends days on this."
"10565800","10567080"," He gets this prepared every week."
"10569420","10571180"," And he does a lot of work for it. "
"10571180","10572020"," He's a great trader."
"10572100","10573400"," He makes a ton of money."
"10576020","10577620"," So I'm going to steer you towards him. "
"10580300","10585240"," I think he charges like $5 or $20 or something a month or something or $5 a week or something."
"10585360","10585800"," I don't know what it is."
"10585960","10586480"," It's dirt cheap. "
"10587260","10588540"," $5 a month or something like that."
"10591020","10593140"," I want you to tell him that I sent you to him."
"10594200","10596940"," When there and be like, Hey, Kevin, Jim, James sent me. "
"10599540","10603140"," I like this guy a lot."
"10606840","10610040"," I'm going to post his handle on Fintuit."
"10615760","10617620"," Oh, I'm making money, baby. "
"10618180","10618720"," Hold on here."
"10618860","10619720"," Oh, I'm making money."
"10620580","10622660"," I'm going to dive in and hand these into the bell. "
"10630980","10633800"," Show me the money, baby."
"10641090","10642390"," Show me the money."
"10646790","10648170"," Slam it for me. "
"10654000","10655980"," His name is at Volatility Whiz."
"10656420","10657460"," His first name is Scott."
"10660640","10662220"," We've had him on the show in the past. "
"10663800","10665440"," He has a newsletter every week."
"10665860","10668140"," I'm not going to read the entire newsletter for you."
"10670520","10672480"," He puts a lot of time and effort into it. "
"10673360","10674260"," And it did."
"10674400","10675120"," He does a great job."
"10675140","10676580"," Like I can't kick playing, dude. "
"10676880","10679420"," You're looking for like a forecast for like a week, a month out."
"10679640","10681160"," He updates it as he goes along."
"10683460","10687540"," I bet you that he probably sent you the most recent issue just so you can read it. "
"10688580","10689480"," He's an easy guy."
"10689780","10691460"," You know, maybe I came in and check out my newsletter."
"10691700","10692720"," I'll send you a couple of previous copies. "
"10695640","10696360"," Volatility Whiz."
"10700810","10702010"," Can I read his newsletter?"
"10705220","10706560"," I read his newsletter."
"10706780","10709140"," I have no affiliation with him. "
"10709180","10710620"," He doesn't pay me any money."
"10710720","10711260"," You know, that shit."
"10713040","10713440"," Nothing. "
"10713780","10714060"," Zero."
"10715160","10718840"," So it's not like he's paid me to talk to about him or anything like that."
"10722760","10724200"," He should check out his newsletter. "
"10724400","10725960"," He doesn't advertise and talk about it."
"10726060","10727180"," Not many people know about it."
"10728640","10730980"," But talk to him and be like, Hey, Captain James sent me. "
"10731060","10731900"," He said he have a newsletter."
"10732280","10732860"," That's some serious."
"10734760","10737920"," Three trigger cluster right now on this by. "
"10743750","10746490"," Now he has a piece out from a week or two ago."
"10748950","10754970"," He says a realized vol purgatory continues as OPEC's earnings season dominates."
"10755970","10757490"," Preparing for the unclench. "
"10786760","10788800"," He makes a good point right here."
"10789680","10790500"," Oh, shit."
"10790640","10791700"," I didn't get a fill in my calls. "
"10792720","10793340"," Damn it."
"10796780","10798440"," I'm still sitting in these calls."
"10803140","10804360"," They didn't fill them. "
"10805120","10806200"," They left me hanging."
"10806600","10808260"," I missed it by two pennies or something."
"10810840","10812280"," I'm still sitting in them. "
"10813000","10814020"," God damn it."
"10818060","10821720"," I had a sell order on those bad boys up at like 83 cents."
"10821780","10822320"," They didn't fill. "
"10822940","10824240"," I tried to tag."
"10824380","10825380"," See that tag right there?"
"10825500","10826660"," See that yellow line right there?"
"10826720","10827460"," He tagged the pin."
"10830140","10832320"," I tried to make that money right there. "
"10833840","10835060"," I'm kind of flatish."
"10835140","10836180"," I'm down a couple pennies."
"10838660","10840360"," So I missed that trade right there. "
"10840480","10841120"," Pretty big time."
"10842540","10843600"," I'm kind of pissed at myself."
"10844040","10845180"," I'm reading something in the background. "
"10847240","10848760"," So that whole trade I lost."
"10853040","10855000"," Not paying attention to my trades."
"10863160","10865840"," That perfect pin strike didn't take the money. "
"10866640","10867680"," Wouldn't give me a fill."
"10868440","10870480"," I was just saying you'll get fills on better brokers."
"10872220","10873620"," They were like, sorry, buddy. "
"10884140","10885700"," They were like, not so fast."
"10897460","10899820"," I did get rid of the sell order, though."
"10900140","10901740"," It was an 83 cents or something. "
"10901740","10905620"," And they were like, eat a bag of dicks."
"10908740","10910460"," I think I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna."
"10911500","10912900"," Okay, so this is a good point. "
"10914120","10916320"," So I just took profit, okay?"
"10918000","10919500"," This is a good educational moment."
"10921720","10923040"," Let me see what I bought those for."
"10923360","10923740"," Hold on a second. "
"10925620","10928560"," I'm gonna interject with the topic I was on and go to this topic."
"10928740","10930020"," Let me see what I bought them for."
"10932080","10937180"," You should see my fucking, you should see my, uh, my drunk-a-log of trades. "
"10939900","10945900"," I bought them for a 57 cents and I sold them for 60 and 61 cents."
"10948860","10954370"," But, uh, they're 83 cents."
"10955050","10956750"," Some days when I'm tired, man, I'll miss this. "
"10958110","10959690"," So I was trying to get a fill up here."
"10960470","10961630"," I thought I was filling at 55."
"10962150","10962950"," I guess I filled them higher. "
"10962950","10966110"," But I was trying to get capped to that 83 cents and I missed it."
"10967830","10968810"," That was too greedy."
"10972130","10973930"," And then I didn't watch the rollover down here. "
"10975110","10977950"," Now, you might say like, hey, so just a couple of things here."
"10978830","10984090"," If you missed the trade or the fill, I didn't panic here, right?"
"10986510","10989450"," At least hope that we come back up so that I can unfuck myself."
"10990710","10996730"," The second lesson here is, uh, I planned my trade out. "
"10996870","10997470"," I took the trade."
"10999490","11002450"," I failed, failed the execution of it."
"11004730","11010850"," And once I failed the execution of closing for profit, I didn't stay in it. "
"11011650","11012930"," Now, we could go up right here."
"11013050","11013530"," No problem."
"11015110","11019050"," But I didn't execute my trade properly from start to finish. "
"11019050","11019830"," Does that make sense?"
"11021190","11022690"," So the trade is dead to me."
"11022890","11025050"," So the trade for me was right from here to here."
"11025150","11026030"," That was the trade that I wanted. "
"11026230","11030750"," I think continue up here, whatever."
"11031210","11033470"," But the trade for me is dead."
"11033650","11034690"," This is the trade for me. "
"11035670","11040210"," I wanted to take profit, come back in and grab another one here or grab another one here."
"11040330","11040790"," Does that make sense?"
"11041790","11043050"," So my thesis is zero dates."
"11047090","11052310"," He also adds that these would translate to a four spot, six percent year of year increase the same"
"11052310","11052850"," as March. "
"11053350","11056250"," So now I'm trying to reposition myself for the next trade."
"11057710","11064130"," So I've missed out on, well, what, uh, 30% gain on that trade right there."
"11064210","11068270"," Strike allows you to actually hear water flame features, forex and stock instruments. "
"11069190","11071470"," Get a free trial at tickstrike.com."
"11072050","11073210"," It's a nice 30%."
"11073210","11076350"," It should have been higher, but I didn't catch the bottom of it."
"11076450","11077170"," I caught some of it. "
"11079830","11080950"," So I'm now flat again."
"11083390","11089070"," If I, if I fuck up the execution from the entry to the exit and the path that I wanted."
"11091950","11094710"," I usually don't stay in the trade, like the length of the trade. "
"11094910","11097790"," If I expect this to run for five minutes, I'm in and I'm out."
"11098130","11101930"," If I expect this to run for 15 minutes, you know, I try to see it through unless it goes"
"11101930","11102550"," against me."
"11107280","11108280"," Sorry, interject. "
"11108800","11115800"," I feel a five minute chart here."
"11118620","11119940"," There's a bigger trade though."
"11120080","11123260"," There's a bigger trade and tomorrow price gets up here. "
"11124240","11126960"," Comes back down here and then continues higher right here."
"11128080","11129140"," There goes your white line."
"11129320","11130120"," There goes your red line. "
"11131200","11131960"," Another trade in here."
"11134000","11135120"," There's a second trade up here."
"11139990","11141950"," There's a second bad boy in here right now. "
"11142050","11142770"," There's another one brewing."
"11163700","11166620"," Maybe I can get one more liquidation break down here."
"11167700","11169440"," We like one more liquidation break. "
"11185010","11187710"," And that fix is looking so fucking bullish, isn't it?"
"11187890","11188090"," Winky?"
"11215110","11216250"," Wait, it's on flat right now."
"11231670","11234950"," The volatility was, it was talking about something fascinating here."
"11235150","11236270"," Something we haven't talked about in the program. "
"11248770","11250750"," I'm going to read you a note from his newsletter."
"11250750","11253070"," It says, here's interesting news for this week."
"11253470","11255630"," For the donkeys in charge of the debt ceiling debacle. "
"11256430","11260030"," I love Scott."
"11261310","11263830"," They don't appear to be getting the summer off."
"11264730","11270110"," Things are suddenly speeding to require some sort of imminent need to act. "
"11270770","11272970"," Much earlier than previously expected."
"11273290","11277110"," So now that trading in positive territory lost up is about 1%."
"11278030","11282390"," He's showing a chart from the treasury general account, TGA. "
"11285590","11290330"," And he's showing the debt ceiling be the debt ceiling debacle being imminent."
"11291490","11292910"," Tax day receipts."
"11294970","11299170"," And he says why for the treasury to listen close to this. "
"11299770","11304650"," For the treasury to collect more money under their quote extraordinary measures."
"11306830","11311110"," They need to get to mid June, mid June."
"11313830","11316570"," When corporate tax payments come in. "
"11317470","11320390"," So you want to know that x day for the for the stock market."
"11322850","11328570"," I read it again for the treasury to collect more money under their extraordinary measures."
"11329650","11331670"," They need to get to mid June. "
"11333250","11335650"," When corporate tax payments come in."
"11336650","11341990"," They can't raise new money via treasuries because debt ceiling."
"11343330","11350090"," In receipts this year at the buzzer tax day came in below last year by a significant amount. "
"11350830","11358070"," Mostly due to the fact that stocks were down last year and folks didn't have capital gains taxes to"
"11358070","11358930"," fork over."
"11372370","11376050"," I'm going to post a link that he that he put into this newsletter."
"11387100","11389920"," This is in reference to what I'm discussing with you right now. "
"11399220","11402140"," So markets are having quite the month long siesta."
"11402540","11406940"," There hasn't been a minus 1% day in the S&P 500 since March 22nd."
"11407620","11411060"," And the VIX is plumbing levels from the days of QE, ZERP and stimulus checks. "
"11413180","11416900"," Someone is putting it all together making a sizable trade on volatility returning."
"11418500","11423980"," No it wasn't 50 cent the infamous trader known for buying 50 cent VIX options out of the money when"
"11423980","11425220"," vol is low like it is today."
"11425520","11428160"," This trader bought again the 26 C's. "
"11429620","11431260"," I believe it's for June 26."
"11432280","11436740"," Took down a hundred thousand contracts of June 26 VIX calls for about 17 million."
"11436740","11445200"," This trader's simple equation is a treasury account equals zero plus a current 16 sleepy VIX equals"
"11445200","11445700"," by vol. "
"11446480","11450420"," So as you've seen in recent notes, I'll continue with two types of vol trades."
"11451060","11455040"," Low to zero cost put diagonals that will benefit from an increase in volatility."
"11455960","11459400"," And other spreads like flies and calendars are extremely cheap and have events looming. "
"11466230","11467650"," The other big question coming."
"11467990","11469190"," This is the debt ceiling that we have."
"11469370","11470670"," This is the last debt that we have. "
"11470750","11472670"," This is the last volatility that we've got coming up, right?"
"11473510","11476330"," The expected future path of the three month average fed funds rate."
"11477910","11480610"," There's another big question that's coming whether markets like it or not."
"11483610","11489950"," The markets expect only one more hike cut by September 2 to 3 by December and 100 BPS by March"
"11489950","11491050"," 2024. "
"11492850","11495270"," As they say on fin to it, good luck with that."
"11496510","11502290"," So if markets want to levitate even higher into the May meeting, Jay might have a surprise in"
"11502290","11502530"," store."
"11502630","11506390"," I don't expect markets to waltz into that meeting with a VIX 9 day at 14 and VIX 16. "
"11506850","11508750"," I'll be very ridiculous in terms of complacency."
"11509090","11510110"," We know that worked out, right?"
"11537450","11539330"," Let me read the last part here."
"11555820","11561640"," He posits it's possible that we'll get a kick the can down the road type of events with volatility. "
"11576590","11581430"," Just like January's earnings season topped out as February began, it appears the SP 500 may have"
"11581430","11581990"," done the same."
"11582350","11586730"," But as you can see in the February, in the February OPEC season, a couple sharper temps of selling"
"11586730","11589930"," off quickly mean reverted, frustrating the bearish crowd."
"11590730","11593810"," For the end time being bullish or bearish is a waste of mental energy. "
"11594690","11595810"," I'm marking a political."
"11596150","11600250"," It's much easier to trade, earn without a bias built on how things should be."
"11600870","11603750"," All I really care about is cycles and patterns and volatility. "
"11608690","11613050"," But like February, it's reasonable to speculate in more consolidation, absent surprising news."
"11613430","11617070"," The outlook clearly has and continues to be bad, ominous omens are out there."
"11618570","11621630"," Ad nauseam before and people are tired of hearing about them. "
"11621790","11622630"," The list is very long."
"11623950","11628910"," But what has worked for most of the year is still working and probably going to continue to work."
"11632070","11636490"," Anticipating some volatility when it gets overly quiet, buying it excessively cheap, installing it"
"11636490","11638250"," when people think things are finally going to break. "
"11638530","11643890"," Of course, doing it in a tightly risk managed way in case the ship does actually hit the fan."
"11644770","11651370"," But like the chart above, once OPEC's week dawns, he point here, best to be on guard for a"
"11651370","11653550"," potential unclench once again."
"11657960","11660360"," How about OPEC's week?"
"11662460","11663660"," OPEC's week is next week. "
"11669370","11672590"," He goes on to say one fascinating and profitable pattern to cement."
"11672990","11673990"," The point above is this."
"11676110","11677510"," I'm not going to show you the chart. "
"11679810","11684270"," But he's showing the cycle back from January into earning season."
"11685510","11689710"," And then into the into the 20th and the beginning of March."
"11692790","11697830"," And what we did was we sold off into the first week of I believe March. "
"11711210","11713490"," So let's take a look at that on a larger time frame."
"11735360","11737160"," This is February, right?"
"11738560","11741300"," Earning season peaked out."
"11742720","11743000"," Right?"
"11743120","11745560"," Started trade down into the 21st right here. "
"11748140","11748800"," Right?"
"11749080","11755680"," So he's peeking out the 15th, 16th, 17th, and then boom."
"11758480","11760000"," 21st starts selling it down."
"11761820","11764260"," This is the ninth, this is the 13th. "
"11766580","11767560"," Selling it down."
"11767760","11768740"," So his positive here."
"11772430","11775090"," You can see that up move into next week. "
"11776090","11777250"," And that's slow decline."
"11778930","11779890"," Does that make sense?"
"11784270","11788570"," So he's next couple days today, tomorrow, maybe into Monday."
"11788570","11793470"," You kind of see that same pattern emerging right here, right?"
"11801720","11805140"," We ziggin, we zaggin, we ziggin, we zaggin. "
"11807620","11809440"," We ziggin in a Friday."
"11810960","11812100"," That's your last zig."
"11812880","11814360"," And we zaggin, zaggin, baby. "
"11825500","11828500"," So does that positive mean we didn't have a green Monday yet, right?"
"11828620","11829160"," Our green Thursday."
"11832720","11834360"," Does that mean we murder the vix?"
"11836880","11838440"," One more time in a Friday."
"11841080","11845260"," And then to next week, we start that topping rolling process into the end of the week. "
"11849650","11851490"," Hingrades and, hingrades and horseshoes."
"11857580","11859460"," So far, it's working itself out."
"11865230","11868070"," So check out at volatility with us on Fintuit. "

"11901390","11902150"," we are right now. "
"11902150","11905490"," It's maybe a call spread for Friday clothes and the money."
"11906670","11909190"," 410, 411, 412 for Friday."
"11910250","11914830"," If we get a liquidation break, get a call spread for Friday to the upside. "
"11919070","11924050"," Maybe Monday case Friday is a down day and they swing it back up on Monday."
"11924930","11933110"," Uh, I'm not timing this conversation with you for this moment either."
"11938220","11942140"," One minute hourly starting to break for the bulls. "
"11949880","11951860"," And the bulls do it this time."
"11952840","11954940"," Spied a three trigger cluster to the upside."
"11956960","11958360"," Getting bullish air in the market. "

"12028850","12029890"," It's pretty high, man. "
"12031410","12032110"," I don't know."
"12032110","12032590"," Maybe I'm wrong."
"12032790","12035050"," I think 85 cents is kind of pricey for 425. "
"12035730","12038290"," 425 is a zero date to 25th."
"12041550","12044390"," I was talking to someone about that, uh, as well."

"13345610","13347370"," So unless price gets up here."
"13348150","13349170"," There's no trade for me. "
"13351170","13355390"," There's a trade here for me if price gets up and rejects and then we get the rocket ship into"
"13355390","13355650"," Friday."
"13356090","13357650"," Otherwise I'm looking for a."
"13358850","13360830"," Depitulation trade for Friday down here."
"13361050","13365550"," The US first year treasury yield dips to three spots seven four three percent after the auction"

"13411740","13416180"," To talk to you guys about something so good question someone made a comment in YouTube."
"13418260","13423860"," Just now I think it was a robin made a comment so what you guys understand that."
"13424240","13428580"," So I build a pivot tables and models for gamma in the morning. "
"13430900","13438720"," And that data is it's cleanest like you know per fill per fill or whatever his name is smart guy."
"13438720","13443860"," He's on fin to it right he he shows you how to make your own tables and stuff like that."
"13445480","13447800"," The data gets pulled for. "
"13449600","13450520"," Options data."
"13452220","13457120"," It gets updated multiple times in a day or twenty fire period."
"13457940","13463580"," The data is really dirty at some part of some parts of the day and a twenty fire period and"
"13463580","13467560"," it's very noisy and then other parts of the day it's clean and really good. "
"13468720","13472920"," Usually the best data you can get is right I think my view is like nine thirty in the morning."
"13473420","13479620"," Nine a.m. nine thirty some of the best data you can get because you haven't had the poisoning of"
"13479620","13484080"," zero dates into the market you know the best data from CDO."
"13485280","13486400"," CME all these different. "
"13489680","13494060"," Places you can pull data from right and then you get the lit markets not lit markets you get"
"13494060","13496940"," foreign markets daily you need to pull on all that kind of stuff."
"13498820","13503520"," Anyways cleanest data in the morning what's happening right now is we have the rise of the zero"
"13503520","13510100"," date market day trader market and we have the rise of dealers participating in the rise of"
"13510100","13516000"," institutions participating hedging the market on risk to the up and down side."
"13516800","13521400"," So what it's doing so you've got so first first thought right away you have to get the data that's"
"13521400","13521640"," clean. "
"13521640","13528380"," And then you want to then separate the data from that day as the market progresses through that day"
"13528380","13536400"," as people that know that they can take cheap hedging both sides to make the market move where they"
"13536400","13536980"," want it to move."
"13537120","13540380"," We're not talking about real money buying and real money selling that's when you're like if"
"13540380","13546860"," percentage of the time you can move the market on low low volume days we can move the market the"
"13546860","13548800"," options market have a saying where the market goes."
"13550060","13556080"," The options market doesn't mean shit on a high volume day that's a real money buying real money"
"13556080","13556420"," selling. "
"13557080","13567070"," The point I'm trying to make here is it's hard to get the zero"
"13567070","13569590"," date data in real time."
"13571810","13577550"," So if you get a model I'm not going to name companies but if you get models from companies their"
"13577550","13579350"," data may be right and it may be wrong."
"13579350","13584130"," It may not be updated properly and it doesn't account for the zero date market. "
"13585390","13589730"," Now some of those companies are trying to come out with tools for you to see trying to see that"
"13589730","13591070"," that data."
"13592990","13595970"," One of the best ways that I've found to see that data."
"13598880","13603000"," I'll show it to you right now hold on a second here give me a second see we can show"
"13603000","13603460"," you that data. "

"15221110","15223690"," Like, you know, it really is true. "
"15223890","15225390"," Like calories in, calories out."
"15225670","15230490"," And I think, I don't know if I'm like eating too many calories without knowing it."

"15239610","15241710"," So I'm like, oh man, I'm like peanuts, man."
"15241970","15243430"," I need to start eating popcorn."

"15262050","15263210"," I eat a lot of nuts and shit. "
"15263490","15264950"," I eat balls all day long."

"15292010","15293850"," So like normally, here's the deal, normally."
"15296230","15298530"," So this winter, snow sucked here."
"15298610","15299210"," It's great out west. "
"15299450","15300030"," It sucked here."
"15300910","15303630"," This winter, I worked a lot in the background."

"15307130","15314030"," It was like, dreary cold, snow wind, like 40 degrees and snow and wind."
"15316170","15320990"," So normally, I'd be very active in the springtime coupled with this stuff."
"15320990","15322070"," And I'd be doing great. "
"15322490","15325990"," This year specifically, I've had to..."
"15328710","15330930"," I'm not getting as much activity as I normally get."
"15331490","15333790"," I'm doing something fucked up, but I don't know what it is."

"15540570","15544890"," Bears at 145 slam down to new lows down there. "
"15550950","15552810"," I thought about a stand up desk."
"15553370","15555670"," I think like stand up desks are great."
"15556970","15559630"," If you're not on stream for seven hours. "
"15561350","15563110"," Like when you say that's a great."

"15586130","15586990"," Down here at 410."
"15586990","15589710"," I think it was 410 43 or something like that. "
"15589870","15590470"," Do they get it?"
"15594930","15597770"," Do you see your stand up desk?"
"15598070","15598370"," Are you?"
"15599530","15602590"," Do you stand at it and like not moving?"
"15602590","15604810"," Just stand facing it for eight hours or no?"
"15607570","15611350"," Like I think that's one of the keys here is like I think of us up moving around or like"
"15611350","15613070"," walking around or going there here and there."
"15613170","15613970"," The stamp does be great."
"15619880","15621160"," No, I do believe that. "
"15621320","15624040"," I do believe that as I get older, I lose my testosterone."

"15907670","15908110"," Like, let's look. "
"15909590","15911650"," You can see how dark it is down there."
"15911790","15913690"," There's a little bit more down that we can go."
"15913950","15916010"," It's very, see how black this is down here. "
"15917730","15919910"," A temporary expectations is my point."
"15920110","15921130"," We can get down there, but."
"15922190","15924290"," Now, is this what I want to buy for Friday here?"
"15924290","15924470"," Not yet. "
"15925430","15925890"," I want to see."
"15926130","15926470"," It's not me."
"15926530","15927770"," It's a first leg down, so. "
"15928850","15931030"," I'd like to see if the bears can get one more."
"15932030","15933170"," Tag down here."
"15934030","15935710"," One more go of it again. "
"15936550","15938490"," Do they try to twice today, right?"
"15939570","15943730"," This could be considered a double bottom for bull or for bulls at least to take this up higher."
"15944110","15945490"," There's a nice price down here."
"15946010","15947070"," 41028 for Friday. "
"15947430","15947970"," I like that."
"15948150","15948690"," I like 410."
"15948690","15951550"," Oh, for Friday. "
"15951710","15955770"," So, if you're able to grab some call spreads down here, I understand it's not going to make a"
"15955770","15960530"," difference if we trade down to this zone down here for call spreads."
"15961950","15965370"," So, there was a good opportunity to buy some calls for Friday down there."
"15966430","15969950"," I want to see if this usually takes more than just five minutes to play out. "
"15970150","15970770"," So, it's 153."
"15972910","15974670"," Bears are in charge on the hour."
"15974670","15978550"," So, the hour lasts from 130 until 230 right now. "
"15978670","15979710"," So, I don't think bears are done."
"15980510","15981870"," We're going to check until 230."
"15982690","15985370"," Let this play itself out here for the next half an hour. "
"15988170","15993230"," And see if the bears can stay in charge down here or not for the next next half hour or"
"15993230","15994010"," so like that."
"15999460","16000340"," Bears, dude."
"16001620","16002400"," You bears. "
"16007140","16008700"," I know you're a market merchant."
"16008860","16009640"," I got your humor, brother."
"16009980","16010740"," Definitely, man. "
"16019610","16020810"," Yeah, it's only two o'clock."
"16020870","16021170"," It's early."
"16021390","16021830"," It's 154. "
"16023310","16025190"," I think the bears are still in charge."
"16025430","16026950"," I want you to know bears are in charge right here."
"16027750","16030190"," Now, this trend is going up to tomorrow. "
"16030510","16033430"," This yellow line is, you know, heading up and tomorrow over."
"16034050","16035310"," And you got to dip by down here."
"16036070","16037750"," Likely have a dip by right there. "
"16038610","16044570"," But, you know, just right now, if we can get one more down and just get that hourly trigger down"
"16044570","16045430"," there, something like that."
"16045750","16047150"," That might have been it right there."
"16047230","16048410"," That might have been the trade in the day. "
"16049250","16051610"," Your last dip by for an up Friday."
"16051890","16053450"," I think we're going up on Friday right now."
"16053610","16056010"," So, we have a red Thursday. "
"16056210","16058370"," It's very rare to not have a green Thursday."
"16058850","16063550"," If we get a red Thursday, though, your probability of a green Friday goes up a ton."
"16066690","16068050"," Now, I'm just going to let this play out. "
"16068210","16074870"," Give it a minute to breathe and see if we can get one more new low down here for the"
"16074870","16075270"," bears."
"16076670","16079470"," 155 in the afternoon coming into the two o'clock hour."
"16083490","16085530"," For the half hour, I should say at two o'clock. "
"16086170","16088490"," See if the bears can do it one more time into 230."
"16092390","16094990"," And hopefully I can get a dip at like 230 this afternoon."
"16096850","16116730"," If you're"
"16116730","16117990"," in that trade short, congratulations. "
"16118710","16119250"," You made some money."
"16125150","16126810"," Here's your yellow box right here."
"16126890","16128190"," Here are your sellers right here. "
"16137790","16140030"," Or I should say your sellers are right here."
"16147160","16149420"," And your swellers are up here."
"16152770","16154150"," You know, you could Jim Bros. "
"16155090","16156890"," Jim Bros are down here."
"16158490","16162110"," And they only work on arms or legs."
"16162110","16162950"," They don't do both. "
"16163110","16164750"," These are your old guys up here."
"16165370","16167410"," These are the old sellers just sitting right here."
"16172070","16173590"," That's where they're looking at T off. "
"16179330","16181390"," I should have bought these calls down here."
"16181470","16181890"," I didn't."
"16182070","16187190"," For me, I'm like, didn't that hit my next thing where I'm like, it's kind of a deep push. "
"16190250","16193810"," If this took a half an hour or an hour, I'd be like, yeah, I'm buying that dip."
"16198590","16201890"," Spy with another bounce down there in the daily trigger like it's like it's nothing."
"16208450","16209750"," VIX consolidating still. "
"16214610","16217690"," VIX training lower again, but it's right on that trigger, man."
"16217850","16219050"," It's right on that three trigger cluster."
"16219490","16223170"," So we have a three trigger cluster on VIX for VIX to go higher. "
"16224710","16230930"," Right now, now if it checks back and confirms that we're going higher and VIX we'll find out here"
"16230930","16231530"," in just a moment."
"16234790","16236930"," Still no trade for me at this moment."
"16237170","16239090"," Long side long calls or something like that. "
"16240290","16242010"," No bull trade for me at this point."
"16260440","16265860"," He speaks to Condos says that incomplete banking in main vulnerability of your banks."

"16283740","16289180"," You know what?"
"16289180","16290020"," Monday or Tuesday?"
"16292640","16297680"," On Monday and Tuesday when we had those big rips down on the end of day, like 1.32.30"
"16297680","16298140"," in the afternoon."
"16299000","16302520"," I was like, dude, these hedge funds know that there's no liquidity."
"16303480","16306980"," So it's like a hit and run like you just come in and just start like you own a bunch"
"16306980","16309200"," of Spy or you own a bunch of SPX or yes. "
"16309700","16313160"," You just dump it as fast as you possibly can while you're short."
"16314160","16319600"," And in a low low volume day like like we had that I think it was the lowest volume of"
"16319600","16320580"," the year I think was Monday."
"16322240","16327060"," It's like totally easy to manipulate the the spy comp or S&P 500 complex. "
"16328340","16330760"," Make a quick hit and run and then you're out of here."
"16340360","16344540"," Yeah, David, I should have I should have bought this one right here."
"16344540","16344980"," I didn't. "
"16345120","16346080"," I was going to buy it."
"16346380","16347640"," I was talking about buying it earlier."
"16348720","16351160"," I should have bought some calls for Friday down here. "
"16357950","16361570"," I hope I can get one more one more one more one more whack out of here in the next"
"16361570","16362070"," half hour."
"16362930","16364290"," That might have been it for me, man."
"16364790","16365690"," I might have been the bottom. "
"16371050","16372430"," I'm not disagreeing with that."
"16372990","16374010"," I'm with you on that one."
"16387340","16391419"," I planned on buying this, but I was like, yeah, I was like, I'm going to give the bears a"
"16391419","16392680"," little bit more time here. "
"16396080","16397380"," But David, I got you, man."
"16397439","16399599"," If you bought that bottom down here, it's a sweet by down there."

"16453210","16454630"," There's no market down there."
"16462669","16464369"," 201 right now into the new hour. "
"16464490","16465770"," We'll see if the bears can do it."
"16465810","16469390"," If they can't get it done here, bulls are going to take over."
"16477650","16479570"," Yes, David's saying take your money and run to. "
"16480070","16482509"," I wish I had bought some calls for Friday down here."
"16483910","16485970"," That was a juicy buy down here either way."

"17560110","17561050"," And then there was a couple other places."
"17564330","17565790"," And a Glastonbury baby."
"17566670","17570050"," I want to go to Tomorrowland, but Glastonbury, I'm too old for Glastonbury now. "
"17571450","17575190"," I'd have to be like really old to go to Glastonbury, like 80 years old or something."
"17575370","17576530"," They'd be like, come on in, man, you're cool."
"17584230","17589110"," I used to hang out with a bunch of DJs from out there too, from over in Ibiza. "
"17589870","17590690"," Back in the day."
"17594150","17595330"," The tunnel, dude."
"17595810","17596830"," I used to party at the tunnel. "
"17597110","17599950"," Isn't that like a, is it like a mall now or something?"
"17600990","17601750"," It takes right."

"17615590","17616910"," I wanted to go to Glastonbury."
"17617550","17618390"," That's what I missed. "
"17618590","17619450"," I'm kind of pissed about."
"17622030","17624310"," So that kind of submitted everyone to Glastonbury."
"17624850","17627910"," I wanted to go there when I was like 1920 or something. "
"17630770","17632570"," Yeah, I'm making notes that B's are still badass."
"17632810","17634070"," Amsterdam's a great badass too."
"17634610","17636010"," Hey, I know Junior Vazquez. "
"17636550","17636890"," I know him."
"17637590","17638150"," I met him before."
"17639270","17640130"," Junior's a nice guy. "
"17642490","17643750"," I know Junior Vazquez."
"17644670","17645350"," I actually know him."
"17646270","17649290"," If you guys listen out, so during his time I met most of those guys. "
"17651850","17654070"," Adding inflation is most stable and persistent."
"17661250","17663170"," So you drank the Kool-Aid."
"17663690","17667530"," My take here hasn't changed. "
"17668530","17670290"," Nothing has changed for me all day long."
"17673670","17677090"," So my take on today is specifically ready."
"17677650","17678470"," Make it real simple here. "
"17681590","17682830"," Thursdays are usually green."
"17683190","17684050"," And so I'm going to go to Glastonbury."
"17687090","17691290"," And if today is not green, we're likely to have a green Friday. "
"17692110","17692850"," It's that simple."
"17695270","17697950"," Now if we were green today, we'd be selling Friday."
"17698370","17698850"," Does that make sense?"
"17700610","17703090"," So I'm looking for a dip to buy for Friday. "
"17705330","17707550"," Now into next week into OPEC's."
"17709950","17712070"," Sellers are looking to sell OPEC's."
"17712070","17716050"," Like into the end of next week for the market to begin to roll over into the beginning of the"
"17716050","17716670"," month of June. "
"17717470","17724150"," You're going to see some hits on the market hedging flows for the volatility to be expected from"
"17724150","17726210"," the debt ceiling agreement."
"17727310","17728190"," Not being reached."
"17729070","17730970"," You're going to see those hedging flows go to the market. "
"17731170","17733230"," So we're going to get hit at least a little bit."
"17733770","17735710"," My take though is that we don't go down."
"17735910","17737510"," The dealers are going to hedge against that trade. "
"17738250","17740230"," We're going to blast off up into the beginning of the month."
"17740970","17742890"," Now the fly in the ointment here for tomorrow."
"17742890","17745950"," If you had a fly in the ointment, it's like we're going down cap on Friday. "
"17746530","17747170"," You're wrong."
"17749210","17750410"," You're wrong, captain."
"17753350","17757850"," Well, you have some kind of a set. "
"17758030","17763530"," You have some kind of a point because VIX is low still."
"17764470","17765770"," It's not high enough, right?"
"17765910","17767630"," They want to get the VIX up into the close on Friday."
"17769950","17771090"," Let's look at the week here. "
"17782910","17784070"," It came into the week."
"17785470","17789190"," Tag the low, tag the high, tag the low, tag the high, tag the low."
"17790350","17792830"," So where we are right now, I'm looking to buy. "
"17793450","17793990"," Does that make sense?"
"17794190","17795410"," I'm looking to buy into Friday."
"17796550","17799550"," And I'm looking for the bears to step in and sell this down here."
"17799890","17800810"," I'm going to slow down. "
"17800950","17801970"," We'll cut corporate profits."
"17802570","17804650"," Think about this from this perspective right now."
"17804830","17806270"," If you're like, I'm bearish. "
"17808410","17810230"," I'm like, you're like, I'm bearish cap."
"17811130","17812450"," You want to sell this."
"17813010","17814090"," You want to sell this. "
"17814790","17816370"," If you're a bear, you want to sell that."
"17817410","17819190"," If you're a bull, you want to buy this."
"17819730","17820270"," Buy this. "
"17821490","17822150"," And buy this."
"17822590","17822930"," Makes sense?"
"17826090","17827510"," Until something changes."
"17831500","17838040"," If you're a bull and you buy this and you put stops right here, you didn't lose shit, did you?"
"17839080","17841000"," If this fails, you have a stop. "
"17841000","17844320"," But otherwise, until it breaks, you buy it for the top up here."
"17846080","17849460"," If you're a bear, you're not getting short right here, right?"
"17852100","17853960"," If you're a bear, where do you get in the short?"
"17856180","17858020"," Here and below."
"17860660","17863200"," That's where you get short right here and right here. "
"17864620","17866440"," So are you short right here?"
"17866860","17867160"," Not really."
"17867160","17872020"," I mean, intraday, you could have taken that short down here, but this is just another dip buy for"
"17872020","17873860"," bulls to get up here into Friday."
"17874460","17874900"," Does that make sense?"
"17877320","17887040"," If you ran this trade 20 times, you'd win more by shorting up here and shorting below here. "
"17889540","17892560"," Then trying to say, yeah, we're going to crash into the close tomorrow."
"17892700","17893340"," Does that make sense?"
"17895840","17898340"," Like this isn't worth the trade, so..."
"17901100","17902540"," Until it doesn't work anymore."
"17904040","17906860"," So tomorrow, we're having a down Thursday. "
"17909120","17914500"," If we were up on the Friday like this, I'd be like, hell yeah, let's go into Friday and sell"
"17914500","17915900"," this down and get the VIX up."
"17919630","17925170"," If we traded this up into the close and held this up here, I'd be like, hell yeah, if it"
"17925170","17928030"," opens here, we can take this up even higher, sweet them in."
"17932690","17935030"," But with a stop right here, does that make sense?"
"17936550","17938710"," So right now, like what's my take?"
"17940050","17941510"," The take is up on Friday. "
"17944790","17947450"," And the lower, I can get it before we get there the better."
"17947710","17949430"," I mean, if I can get this for Friday, I'm all in."
"17951030","17952910"," But the way it looks like it's up here. "
"17955310","17956970"," Now, what does that mean, right?"
"17957550","17960150"," So let's look at the farther out in time."
"17960450","17966670"," So this is the first right here."
"17970170","17971670"," That's the first right there. "
"17972070","17978230"," Everybody and their sister knows our only volatility."
"17982770","17986750"," The window says there can be more rate hikes than how many will depend on data."
"17987210","17993510"," Our only volatility is like that X date. "
"18002560","18005060"," We also have that treasury funkiness, right?"
"18008360","18012260"," 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th."
"18013200","18013920"," What is this second?"
"18014680","18015480"," Right there."
"18015480","18016480"," There's your OPEX, right?"
"18020470","18022690"," You know you're going to get some hedging flows, right?"
"18022930","18026410"," You know you're going to get hedging flows and you're going to see people trying to take the money"
"18026410","18031850"," and run monthly spreads they want to pay. "
"18033590","18035650"," We know the JPM callers higher."
"18037990","18041790"," We know we've got volatility coming into play this down here."
"18044670","18048330"," So I mean you're kind of like trying to front run it like, yeah, we're just going to go down. "
"18049370","18059150"," I am not anti this, but we need to get underneath this for you to have a valid thesis."
"18061230","18062830"," Right now this dips being bought."
"18063910","18065550"," Right now this top's being sold. "
"18065550","18074730"," So you know the expectation is we're probably going to get another rip up and then trade doubt"
"18074730","18080830"," probably trade down into or at least into or after the Thursday."
"18081490","18085090"," Start selling down into the first from hedging flows and a month."
"18086250","18091550"," And then we start trading down and they're going to get this market up so you don't get paid for"
"18091550","18093490"," your for everybody being bearish. "
"18096270","18099010"," You're going to get like counter flows to the hedging, right?"
"18099210","18104410"," The dealers will take your money for you to buy more for you to buy more than they rule it"
"18104410","18104650"," down."
"18104990","18109990"," You got to where you want it to get just not before they they they countered your trade."
"18110010","18111410"," They got neutral against you. "
"18118810","18121970"," You know and even saying that until it doesn't work anymore."
"18122830","18128230"," Until it doesn't work anymore."
"18128430","18129630"," This has been working so far. "
"18135800","18137140"," You know we're already down here."
"18137240","18139520"," We already hit it already hit it already hit it."
"18142080","18144940"," You know you kind of need it to squeeze up and go back down again. "
"18145080","18148660"," So I don't know it's just just for me the way the spies trading."
"18150840","18154100"," Now the move is up into tomorrow in a Friday."
"18167480","18170320"," Squeeze it up, park it back down here into next week. "
"18170580","18171440"," They fill their spreads."
"18174380","18180480"," And a month window dressing bearishness coming into the market for the or volatility coming to the"
"18180480","18182360"," market for the you know the X day."
"18184900","18189020"," You know you got all these monthly spreads that the banks have they want to close out make money. "
