"56990","61090"," position in the U.S., Q4, 2023, Sportbook 2, 51% share."
"61610","65250"," They have a, today, they have a company imported fourth core revenue of a 15%. "
"65250","68410"," This year with 13.5 million average monthly players globally."
"69190","70810"," This is a powerhouse company."
"71370","73050"," Quarterly revenues in piece 26%. "
"73050","73970"," Powerhouse."
"74410","75350"," I like this field."
"75590","76850"," We can't wait to talk to Rob in a minute. "
"77270","81190"," Jim, Dow is being led by IBM, again, and salespeople."
"81190","81790"," What's right behind?"
"82210","83590"," IBM's quarter was really monster."
"84090","87490"," And IBM really does have a great role that they can play in AI. "
"88150","91210"," You know, look, if you're obviously connected with AI in any way, it's moving things up."
"92290","93450"," Salesforce has terrific AI."
"93910","98550"," That's a, that's a, you know, they've got the science time product, he has trillions of questions. "
"99230","104330"," I know AI seems to hype, hype, hype, but there are a few companies, like look, we in service now"
"104330","104610"," on this."
"104850","105450"," I think that's a good story."
"105450","110630"," I think between IBM now, SAP, we're moving beyond the picks and shovels, are we not?"
"110630","115950"," Oh my, I think that you're now in a world, I got super micro, and I did, they're tremendous AI. "
"116310","120230"," You're now in a world where I think that you're starting to see real benefits if you use it."
"120890","124410"," I think that there's so many use cases where it just makes a lot of sense."
"125190","129270"," And I think that they're, we still not, I know the chance that we'll say, look, it makes people"
"129270","131030"," more potential ones, CEO of NVIDIA. "
"131030","134470"," Well, it makes a lot of sense, and you'll make people more productive."
"134830","137390"," He is not in the belief that there's going to be a lot of layoffs."
"137570","138190"," So far that hasn't. "
"138410","139470"," It's made people more productive."
"139970","141570"," I wish the banks would talk more about AI."
"141910","142390"," They did not. "
"142930","145230"," The consumer products companies did not talk about it."
"145870","147690"," But other tech companies really do talk about it."
"147810","147890"," Yeah. "
"148410","152850"," As for layoffs, they're anecdotally, again, Lockheed's a good example today."
"153370","153950"," One percent."
"154610","156530"," We, we try to track them as closely as we can. "
"156530","161950"," And, Jim, over the weekend, Goldman, Jan Hotzius, sticking by their call for a March cut."
"162110","166810"," And one of the lines in the report was that the labor market may start to issue clues as to"
"166810","169190"," why you would want to cut sooner rather than later."
"169330","174110"," Well, the untold story, I was trying to figure out all the different websites, how many immigrants"
"174110","178370"," there are, and whether people are going to look the other way on the Korean part, I'm sure. "
"179090","181610"," This is a bright trick issue for employers, just to be sure."
"182190","183550"," But I think they're going to put a little wages."
"183550","186870"," I think immigrants are going to put a little wages. "
"187130","190330"," Now, we can ask the labor sector, and they will just, it's way too third-rail."
"190730","195530"," But we have had a lot of immigrants come in, and I think that, unfortunately, I hope they get them"
"195530","195970"," in their own wage."
"196190","202410"," But I think, unfortunately, there's a lot of companies that pay less than you think, and jobs are"
"202410","202610"," full. "
"202770","209150"," Well, how about this piece about banker pay, bonuses, down again, and it stings this time, says the"
"209150","209370"," journal."
"209750","210490"," Flat is the new one."
"210490","215310"," You've got to be really careful when you say things, because they make so much more of everybody"
"215310","215430"," else. "
"215550","216770"," But yeah, I read the piece, I understand."
"217470","219470"," And rents have been down now for six straight months."
"219810","223910"," There's a lot of things that, like Timur has said from the journal, a lot of these go in the"
"223910","225250"," Fed's way, but not enough yet. "
"225430","228550"," We still have disinflation, no genuine deflation other than Acosta."
"229010","232130"," Yeah, core goods, there's sharp deflation and core goods."
"232250","232610"," Yes, again. "
"233230","238510"," Then you wake up, and these three troops, troops in Jordan, Jim, worries about the Red Sea."
"238510","241830"," Everybody asks about what it's doing in terms of traffic."
"241830","245290"," Girlfriend Southern had bad numbers last week, and some people felt that they're not getting the"
"245290","246150"," business they used to. "
"246710","247370"," I don't know."
"247850","249930"," I got three downgrades of Norfolk, by the way."
"249930","250370"," No, my. "
"250830","252390"," She's the long knives route for Norfolk."
"252650","254490"," I thought that that was way, way too negative."
"254950","258250"," I just don't think that they're nearly as dangerous as people think. "
"258390","259430"," I like the transports too."
"259990","263130"," A Lockheed Martin Supreme Court, all the defend Northrop Grumman cut, price target cut."
"263470","266090"," I think people don't realize, there's a lot of people just betting that the Republicans are going"
"266090","268290"," to come in, and that's the end you can spend. "
"268730","270350"," And so you want to get away from your stocks."
"271630","272470"," Look, I don't know."
"272530","275730"," And I don't know if we're political advice. "
"275950","276750"," It's hard to read."
"277530","279510"," Another policy question, Jim, is the border."
"280030","284270"," The President's comment on Friday night that if he had emergency authority that he doesn't have, he"
"284270","286350"," would use it on the day he signed the bill. "
"287130","288930"," Are you watching the rails through that lens?"
"289650","291450"," I'm looking at everything that lens."
"291950","292610"," I think you have to."
"292750","294150"," I think it's an untold story. "
"295710","298130"," We were paying above minimum wage in New York."
"298770","299350"," Forget that."
"299650","300330"," Forget that. "
"300530","304510"," I mean, you have to hope that there are people who are not, who are willing to play by the"
"304510","306950"," rules and not offer 12 instead of 18."
"307550","308210"," It's around the country."
"308510","309290"," Minimum wage is back. "
"309650","310490"," It means a lot."
"310830","314070"," Because the immigrants want jobs, and I think that's an untold story, too."
"314590","318150"," You know, all the things, every time you mention the immigrants, I wish it weren't hot button,"
"318190","319790"," because something has to be done. "
"319790","324050"," But right now, we have 1.3 million people, and I believe, came in in the last year, and at"
"324050","325410"," 1.3 a year before I went over there."
"325750","330590"," More people came in in the last year than in four years of Trump, and they're going to work."
"331070","333210"," And that's what I think it's going to keep wages down. "
"334030","335110"," Jim, a lot of news on Boeing."
"335510","337230"," We got some Max Nines back in service."
"337630","344410"," This report that United's chief went to Toulouse to talk to Airbus about maybe if we don't get the"
"344410","344670"," tens. "
"345430","346390"," Could we work something out?"
"347010","348230"," You know, there's no planes."
"348670","349770"," I mean, that's a nice thought."
"350070","351370"," Maybe they want a discount. "
"352250","357590"," I mean, if Airbus had planes, believe me, you wouldn't have a war between these two characters."
"358370","359210"," Damn it, they don't have planes."
"359730","361270"," I know United wants to know. "
"361510","361790"," Forget it."
"361850","362550"," I mean, it's a nice thought."
"364370","366050"," Boeing is still in the driver's seat. "
"366350","367930"," Why is that stock not at 1.70?"
"368330","370330"," Because they have the planes."
"372270","375310"," And you got Ryan Air saying, hey, anybody doesn't want their tents?"
"375710","376750"," Well, listen to that."
"376850","378050"," That was a great interview, by the way. "
"378090","380330"," I love you coming early to get some really cool stuff."
"380750","384250"," I know you were tweeting early this morning about Phillips and sleep apnea."
"384450","385090"," Oh, my. "
"385390","387250"," I mean, look, you have to understand."
"387630","391970"," This is sleep apnea, it's a duopoly between Phillips and Resmen."
"392590","394850"," And Mick Farrell is got great numbers to begin with. "
"395010","396750"," The stock was down, RMD."
"396750","401870"," Because the GOP, even though he said the people said GOP, that's one, are using it in conjunction"
"401870","402890"," to Resmen."
"403050","403750"," So go by Resmen. "
"403910","405150"," Numbers are way too low."
"405310","408270"," And you got this decision on buyer 2.2 billion."
"408510","409490"," This Philadelphia court. "
"410030","411190"," It's the biggest penalty yet."
"411810","414090"," Buyer bought a company that could sink fire."
"414390","419970"," Monsanto was just, it's the gift that never stops giving you downside surprises. "
"420290","422850"," Terrible, terrible, terrible buy."
"423430","428410"," As for some cell-side research, Jim, got an upgrade of American over at City."
"428550","430530"," They go to buy the 20 from 14. "
"431010","437190"," They had the best upside, and the stock had been down basically where it was during the pandemic."
"437670","438930"," I think that deal makes sense."
"439950","441670"," My favorite, how much is America's best up?"
"441770","444610"," That was the one that was just so much better than expected. "
"444610","446050"," Ooh, opportunity."
"446490","447130"," The stock was down."
"447890","449790"," They had, they're multiples going hard. "
"450010","451650"," March, March, March had the best quarters apart of the ship."
"452010","452450"," Best guy."
"452830","453030"," I'm sorry. "
"453310","453610"," Best guy."
"453970","453970"," Yes."
"454890","456210"," Steve Screary came in. "
"456450","457390"," I mean, I was listening to Colin."
"457810","459390"," It was, it was, it didn't really."
"459690","463790"," Kind of got over, Capital One's comments kind of got over shadow because they had some pretty"
"463790","466230"," positive things to say about real wage growth, Jim. "
"466990","468710"," Capital One is such a great lender."
"469370","472830"," I know people say that they charge too much, but obviously they make it so a lot of people can"
"472830","473910"," get credit."
"474530","478090"," And then people say, well, listen, people default on it, but if you take a look at that chart from"
"478090","483130"," 2000 to now, other than it had been a big dip in 2008, and they came right back. "
"483530","489130"," And then they got overused during the, right during COVID, but that's a, that's a great, a 20 year"
"489130","492330"," chart on this thing shows you that Fairbank has been able to figure this out."
"492810","493630"," Very smart guy."
"493990","494690"," Really smart. "
"494870","495470"," Don't mess with it."
"495970","497010"," He'll find a phone number."
"497190","498930"," We'll tell you what an idiot you are, but he won't use that word. "
"499570","502670"," A big piece in business week over the weekend about Lilly Jim."
"503210","508470"," They quote an analyst saying that the saying among analysts is JBL, just by Lilly."
"508970","512010"," I'm not going to disagree with the used position of my travel trust. "
"512570","518830"," One day, there'll be enough, the GLP One, Unjaro in New York City, but right now it's so in short"
"518830","519110"," supply."
"519510","520990"," It's short supply everywhere, you kidding me?"
"521350","523830"," And North Carolina plants, they can't get them open fast enough."
"523830","526830"," Now, I know that you look, there's an issue here. "
"527010","527790"," There's always going to be an issue."
"528090","528610"," Are there problems?"
"528890","529890"," Who will pay for it?"
"530270","534690"," All I can tell you is, is that you, when you have a product that you can't make enough of,"
"535030","536990"," you're going to be able to make a lot of money."
"537170","537170"," Yeah. "
"537430","540750"," They do say Zepbound's likely to be the best selling drug of all time."
"540910","542670"," Zepbound will be the best selling drug of all time."
"542750","544210"," Maybe you put all the clusters on together. "
"544450","544970"," Maybe it doesn't."
"545130","547250"," No, Zepbound is going to be number one drug of all time."
"547530","549450"," And I've been saying that saying blood pressure is unbelievable. "
"550410","554070"," Too much drinking, you take that, they'll never get that pestle, never do a study on that."
"554350","559850"," But this thing is just, it is, it's not a fountain of youth, but it's a fountain of hypertension"
"559850","560510"," and heart."
"561230","564990"," And that's why everyone's going to pay for it, because hypertension goes down dramatically, and"
"564990","566930"," your heart risk goes down dramatically. "
"567470","569710"," And that's what Medicare wants, and that's what the system wants."
"570090","570670"," They'll pay for it."
"570670","573890"," Finally, Jim, Tesla holding 185. "
"574850","576670"," We've got CapEx guidance above $10 billion."
"576990","578270"," We'll treat you slightly below that."
"578470","582090"," Well, look, it's at a level where we've got some people saying, you know what, let's take a stab at"
"582090","582230"," it. "
"582490","585410"," Well, I can tell you, I was, I drove a ribbon on Friday."
"585670","586050"," Well, that's right."
"586630","587770"," Holy cow, the ribbon's cool. "
"589050","589570"," It's cool."
"589950","590630"," It's really cool."
"590670","591570"," You know it's cool. "
"591970","592650"," Super cool."
"592810","593770"," Yeah, it is super cool."
"593830","594910"," But you're not endorsing it. "
"595090","596070"," I found something you're not endorsing."
"597070","597930"," That's a first, brother."
"598310","598870"," That's a first. "
"600410","601930"," Oh, my God, it's the best."
"602270","602910"," You're the best."
"603230","603830"," Rob, welcome. "
"604090","604810"," It's great to have you."
"604950","605350"," It's been a while."
"605630","606190"," Good to have you back. "
"606230","606770"," Yes, it's been a while."
"606910","608350"," Thank you guys for having me on."
"608510","610070"," It's a pleasure to be here once again. "
"610630","612250"," The atmosphere here is just fantastic."
"612370","614130"," It feels like game day right now."
"614150","615950"," Have you slept since I saw you yesterday?"
"616250","616710"," Yes, I was actually. "
"617210","621450"," Last night I was at the game in San Francisco doing the pre-show, the first show."
"622150","622690"," Yes, it was great."
"623030","627590"," And we just ended, you know, that was the last one of the year, because we don't have the Super"
"627590","628210"," Bowl this year. "
"628210","631850"," And that was my rookie year, so I completed a rookie year and I went very well."
"632250","636230"," And I'm just proud to be on that panel with those guys doing the pre-game show."
"636430","639590"," And then I took a plane right after the game landed and came right here. "
"639790","641870"," So I'm on about three hours of sleep."
"642030","645230"," I got about two more hours left in the tank of fuel."
"645630","646990"," And then I'm going right back to back. "
"648090","649910"," By the way, you were crushing it on television."
"650330","650730"," Congratulations."
"651350","651390"," Yes. "
"651950","652530"," It's going amazing."
"653050","653630"," Talk about this."
"653630","658670"," Because we've had John many times to talk about the phenomenon, but this is sort of a moment, isn't"
"658670","658770"," it?"
"658930","661930"," This is definitely one of the coolest moments of my life. "
"662030","668530"," I am actually an ambassador and I represent FanDuel, which is Flutters, one of their biggest brands"
"668530","670690"," here in the United States of America."
"670690","672790"," And today, it's Flutters Big Day."
"672990","680110"," The New York Stock Exchange is finally welcoming Flutters from London here to the U.S. And today is"
"680110","682770"," the first day it's opening here on the Stock Exchange Flutters. "
"683050","684650"," So I'm just glad to be a part of it."
"684710","686690"," I'm glad to be the number one ambassador."
"687230","688630"," We do a lot of cool campaigns. "
"688950","690070"," I'm sure you've seen our commercials."
"690490","693270"," I'm doing the kick of Destiny 2 before the Super Bowl this year."
"693610","697130"," Last year I missed, but I missed on purpose so I can have redemption kick. "
"697490","701370"," So everyone pick that I'm going to make it because if you pick that I'm going to make the kick"
"701370","705610"," this year for Kick of Destiny 2, you get a piece of the pie and the pie is $10 million"
"705610","707470"," in bonus pass, baby."
"708270","708670"," Wow."
"709230","711050"," You've seen him on the motorcycle in the desert?"
"711230","715990"," I watched his career ever since he came on my show when we went to San Francisco and you were"
"715990","717070"," so kind to come on. "
"717350","720010"," Which means I have to ask him, which one do you take?"
"720210","722330"," Because the line is very tight, San Francisco, Casey."
"722750","723750"," So what is the line?"
"723910","724450"," I haven't seen it yet."
"724450","725350"," Casey getting one?"
"726330","727110"," Casey's getting one?"
"727330","727370"," Yeah. "
"727650","728610"," I think that's appropriate."
"729090","730270"," I mean, it's going to be a great game."
"730270","732130"," It's a Super Bowl rematch, what?"
"732270","733330"," They played four years ago?"
"733450","733650"," Yes. "
"733750","736710"," Four or five years ago it was, if I'm correct."
"736810","737210"," 2020?"
"737350","741910"," Yeah, 2020 and San Francisco was supposed to win the game, but Kansas City came through."
"742430","743450"," So it's a Super Bowl rematch. "
"743930","745290"," It's one for the ages, once again."
"745410","751050"," Because San Francisco, they've been to the championship, NFC championships plenty of times."
"751590","753970"," Also too Super Bowl, but they haven't won it at all yet. "
"754290","757930"," In Kansas City, there's a lot of talk about them that they couldn't do it again."
"757930","759990"," You can't repeat two times in a row."
"760110","760730"," It's really tough. "
"761030","762370"," They almost have a dynasty going."
"762550","765310"," If they win, I'm sure they're going to start claiming that they have a dynasty."
"765410","769450"," So those big implications around the U.S. It's going to be a great game once again. "
"769770","773150"," Now, you've got so much happening in the past on any different work."
"773250","774070"," We can't wait for you."
"774070","776110"," How successful can you play against any of these?"
"776170","780410"," Don't afraid it will be just as successful in the booth as he was on the field. "
"780910","784190"," The guy knows the game of football like no other."
"784370","790270"," He can break down a defense at any given time, at any given moment, even during his sleep."
"790770","795610"," And then on the often side of the ball, he knows what player is going to do, what guy is"
"795610","798290"," going to be open at, what given time, where to throw the ball. "
"798710","800770"," He knows all the good stuff about the game of football."
"801010","804190"," It's going to be great that he's going to give that insight on TV for Fox."
"804430","810810"," And he's joining his X teammates, myself and Julian Edelman as well, once in a while, as an"
"810810","811070"," analyst. "
"811290","811990"," So we can't wait."
"812250","813230"," It's going to be so much fun."
"813410","815250"," It's great to always get the band back together. "
"815250","817590"," And the TV stuff is just practice, right?"
"817710","820010"," The mechanics, the timing, that kind of stuff?"
"820270","824050"," Yes, you know, you got to get used to when it's in the TV stuff is live, you know?"
"824370","825950"," So we stride when it's live."
"826290","828510"," Fourth and goal, you only get one opportunity as well."
"828730","830470"," We love to be under pressure as athletes. "
"830970","832570"," That's when it brings the best out of us."
"832690","835410"," So you got to also practice as well, practice as key."
"835630","837990"," You got to prep and order to be ready for those situations. "
"838890","842050"," Talk about how active are you when you bet."
"842050","844910"," And how do you tell newcomers how to do it?"
"845350","850250"," Yeah, so what I love about Fandoor and Flutter as well is that they're all about gaming."
"850530","854470"," They're the number one online sports betting company in the whole entire world. "
"854650","857550"," And they love to do it responsibly as well."
"857790","858810"," So you want to bet responsibly."
"859230","860250"," There's no doubt about that. "
"860690","864270"," You don't want to be putting your whole check on the line, even though some people do."
"864490","868110"," And then it gets really intense, but that's not the way that you're supposed to do it."
"868110","872490"," You want to do it responsibly and it intensifies the game that much more. "
"872670","875250"," I remember I bet it on an NBA game last year."
"875430","879810"," And I'm literally yelling at the screen every second for everyone to shoot a three and make it."
"879950","883950"," So it just intensifies that game and you just so much more into it. "
"883950","886890"," So that's what I love about the aspect of it as well."
"887250","889030"," And Fandoor, just number one."
"889410","891330"," So if you're going to make a bet, do it Fandoor. "
"891610","893410"," Now I have the love daily fantasy."
"893930","895810"," I think it's one of the most exciting things in the world."
"895810","900530"," So I got to ask you, do I take Kittle or do I take Kelsey?"
"901050","903290"," Man, so how does it work?"
"903470","904370"," So what do you mean?"
"904590","906890"," The draft already happened in fantasy. "
"906970","907950"," Are you talking about next year?"
"908310","908550"," Daily fantasy."
"908910","909570"," Daily fantasy."
"909950","910690"," It's so much fun. "
"911370","912170"," It's so much fun."
"912170","914730"," You know, I'm going to go with Travis Kelsey in that situation."
"915370","917050"," George Kittle is an unbelievable tie-in. "
"917270","919350"," He's the best complete tie-in in the game."
"919850","923170"," And last night, if you saw George Kittle, pancake, Aaron Hutchinson."
"923170","926990"," And that's absolutely beastly to do as a tie-in. "
"927210","928950"," The pancake, a defensive end."
"929330","930950"," And that's why that team is in the Super Bowl."
"931350","934270"," And tight ends are transitioning, transcending the position. "
"934910","937610"," I mean, you got to have a good tie-in now to reach the Super Bowl."
"937970","939810"," George Kittle, myself over the years."
"940290","944770"," Travis Kelsey, it's just known that you have to pay these tie-ins if you want to get to the"
"944770","945190"," Super Bowl. "
"945270","949010"," But Travis Kelsey on their hand, he's the best receiving tie-in of all time."
"949250","950790"," He showed up the last two weeks."
"950790","951690"," He's putting up numbers. "
"952150","953170"," And he's going to be ready to go."
"953330","953930"," He's already proved."
"954270","956790"," But he's already shown it that he can play in big moments. "
"956790","959810"," He's going to probably be the best guy to take four fantasy months."
"959810","963650"," Do you ever think that Mahomes could challenge Brady's goat status?"
"964190","965770"," I would say he definitely could challenge."
"965950","970930"," If anyone could challenge Brady's goat status, it's definitely Mahomes. "
"971190","973170"," I mean, he went to four Super Bowls now."
"973310","976670"," This is his fourth, and he's the quickest to ever do it in this band of time."
"976910","980610"," And he's the youngest to ever do it as well to get the four Super Bowls. "
"980610","981130"," That quick."
"981430","983190"," So, Mahomes got a long way to go."
"983610","984670"," There's no doubt about it. "
"984850","985970"," He's an unbelievable player."
"986050","987330"," He's an unbelievable player."
"987890","991310"," But to reach Tom's status, I mean, a lot of things have to go right. "
"991710","996870"," I'm not going to say he's going to reach it, but if it's going to be anyone, it's Patrick Mahomes."
"997810","1001670"," Finally, a question about you and your brand ambassadorships."
"1002090","1002790"," A-R-P-E. "
"1002950","1003230"," I'm sorry."
"1003810","1004490"," USA A."
"1004710","1004870"," Yes."
"1005130","1005650"," USA A."
"1006610","1008490"," How do you choose what to be associated with?"
"1008490","1013810"," You know, I love to choose things that I truly believe in, and what's fun as well. "
"1014130","1015550"," And being here with FanDuel, they're fun."
"1015830","1019010"," Like, we're doing the kick-up to kick-up decimal number two."
"1019450","1020050"," I love training. "
"1020310","1022650"," I love, you know, activities, and they got me kicking."
"1023030","1023390"," That's fun."
"1023670","1024609"," Also, USA A."
"1024869","1029390"," It's fun doing the commercials, shooting them, and me trying to get in so I can get the insurance. "
"1029970","1032990"," Even though I never served, or my parents didn't serve either."
"1033170","1035410"," So, I just love the fun aspect to it."
"1035569","1036790"," I love the troops as well. "
"1036790","1037589"," USA A."
"1037869","1041790"," All has to do about, you know, with our troops and our military."
"1042470","1043930"," I'm always giving back to the military."
"1043990","1046930"," Without them, there are true heroes of our world. "
"1047210","1048150"," You know, of the United States."
"1048330","1050970"," And without them, we wouldn't have this freedom to be here right now."
"1051030","1053850"," I wouldn't have the freedom to go out there and just play the game of football. "
"1054150","1058770"," So, those two just align with my brand so much, and I love being a part of them."
"1058930","1060370"," And Belichick, no coaching, huh?"
"1060850","1064890"," Belichick, you know, not coaching, which, you know something, I think that's happening for a"
"1064890","1065150"," reason."
"1065150","1067750"," I think coach Belichick needs a year off. "
"1068030","1069430"," He can go back into it next year."
"1069530","1072710"," The guy's been coaching for 50 years straight and coaching stressful."
"1073290","1075010"," 15 basically hours a day. "
"1075390","1078230"," It's great to see him take a break, you know, if he's going to take a break."
"1078550","1082330"," Take a year off, enjoy your time, go find some things that you love to do."
"1082710","1084070"," And then come back next year, coach. "
"1084230","1085830"," I mean, everyone wants to see him coach again."
"1086410","1088930"," But some time off is probably good for him."
"1089510","1090850"," Robert, it's great to see you again, man. "
"1090970","1091290"," Congrats."
"1091410","1092230"," Get some rest."
"1092230","1093210"," Thank you guys. "
"1093350","1097530"," I'm going to check out about, and now I'm going to have to my tank and then I've got to"
"1097530","1099550"," fill it back up with a little power now."
"1100210","1100570"," Yes."
"1100790","1102110"," You guys are the best, man. "
"1102210","1102990"," It's good to see you."
"1103330","1104030"," Come back soon."
"1104210","1105290"," That kick too, by the way. "
"1105510","1106950"," It's going right through the uprights."
"1108010","1108850"," I'm Greg Kowski."
"1109030","1109370"," Take care. "
"1109810","1111110"," As we go to break, check out bonds."
"1111770","1114930"," The data today is going to be a little bit like compared to the rest of the week."
"1115030","1120830"," But we'll get some numbers mostly shaping up on Wednesday with ADP, some productivity, jobs number"
"1120830","1122670"," on Friday, 10-year, 4-11. "
"1122890","1123270"," Be right back."
"1124430","1135620"," Oil prices"
"1135620","1138300"," rise amidst stronger rents and softer freight."
"1141830","1152780"," So the"
"1152780","1160120"," Bank of England sells 799 spot 9 million pounds of bonds in auction and receives one spot 9-8"
"1160120","1161000"," billion pounds. "
"1161180","1165000"," Do you want to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for"
"1165000","1166140"," non-farm payrolls?"
"1166140","1171600"," Then sign up today and get our special offer or financial use pro for years' worth of our service"
"1171600","1175440"," for the price of one month and save 92%."
"1315950","1320170"," Market definitely on the hunt for more examples to add to the AI trade, Jim."
"1320430","1322010"," Adobe is going to lead to the S&P. "
"1322110","1323270"," Or the NASDAQ at least this morning."
"1324050","1325970"," They're a fire-fired product."
"1326330","1327350"," My daughter saw all the time. "
"1327510","1328330"," I cannot believe the AI."
"1328530","1329670"," I cannot believe how great it is."
"1329810","1330470"," That's another good example. "
"1331090","1332290"," It's incredibly powerful."
"1332870","1335250"," Anytime Dow's up, 41 to start a very busy week."
"1335390","1335690"," Don't go anywhere. "
"1512040","1513020"," Jim, what's on mat tonight?"
"1513260","1513480"," Grog?"
"1513800","1513980"," No."
"1515040","1515240"," Super micro."
"1515480","1516140"," I love it. "
"1516380","1517280"," Super micro in NASCAR."
"1517860","1518960"," And I can't wait in NASCAR to be good."
"1519300","1519880"," By the way, Super micro. "
"1520120","1521660"," But, you know, I'm a close one."
"1522400","1522940"," They really do."
"1523040","1523600"," And you can see why. "
"1523880","1524500"," Yeah, exactly."
"1525400","1526140"," We'll see you tonight."
"1526560","1527960"," We'll see you at 6 p.m. Eastern time. "
"1528100","1530340"," When we come back so far, one of the big gainers of the morning."
"1530720","1531640"," We'll talk to Anthony Nodo."
"1531800","1532120"," Don't go anywhere. "
"1723880","1724620"," I'm a member."
"1731530","1732330"," Good Monday morning."
"1732550","1734010"," Welcome to their hour at Squawk in the street. "
"1734170","1735530"," I'm Colonel Keaton here with Leslie Picker."
"1735650","1736090"," Mike Santoli."
"1736310","1737730"," Live at post night of the New York Stock Exchange. "
"1738370","1739670"," Sarah and David have the morning off."
"1739850","1741670"," Busy week taking shape."
"1742090","1745370"," Obviously, a lot of it's going to involve macro prints with a jobs number, fed decision. "
"1746090","1748490"," A lot of earnings, mega cap tech is going to roll in."
"1748990","1751650"," Also keep it an eye on some geopolitical tensions with oil."
"1752430","1753390"," Touching 79 overnight. "
"1755350","1767490"," We'll"
"1767490","1769550"," see"
"1769550","1784170"," you"
"1784170","1784170"," tonight."
"1784170","1784330"," We'll see you tonight."
"1784350","1787230"," The next week, we'll see you at $100 in each of the following two fiscal years. "
"1787410","1789290"," So shares up a little bit as well."
"1789550","1793170"," And shares of sofa rallying after swinging to a profit in the fourth quarter."
"1793510","1798270"," Revenue jumped by more than a third as the company added to over half a million new members. "
"1798470","1803510"," And so Fies CEO Anthony Nodo joins us this hour to break down the numbers and give his outlook for"
"1803510","1806990"," the company, the macro environment, the state of the consumer as well."
"1807490","1809730"," As we said, investors getting ready for the big week ahead."
"1810250","1815510"," Santoli's been looking at the dominance of quality names and this recent rally, the premium being"
"1815510","1816290"," placed on the mic. "
"1816530","1818130"," It explains a lot of why we're here."
"1818350","1820610"," Why are the S&P 500s at 4900?"
"1820770","1822190"," Why we're at 20 times forward earnings?"
"1822770","1827210"," And it really gets one layer below the clustering of attention on the MAG-7."
"1827670","1828530"," It's part of that. "
"1828690","1829390"," It's adjacent to that."
"1829530","1834010"," But quality stocks, you know, this would be defined as strong balance sheets, high returns on"
"1834010","1838650"," equity, wide profit margins, predictable earnings growth, all the stuff you think you want out of"
"1838650","1839010"," blue chips."
"1839630","1841830"," They have vastly outperformed and it's beyond just tech. "
"1842390","1844050"," Berkshire Hathaway is at an all time high."
"1844310","1847110"," That qualifies in almost every respect as quality."
"1847350","1851530"," It's also at the upper end of its price to book value range over the last 15 years. "
"1851670","1856970"," So it shows you people are paying a premium for the perception of not just quality, but"
"1856970","1857570"," predictability."
"1858250","1864450"," And the question I think now is exactly, are we, you know, is that a defensive tactic or is it"
"1864450","1869170"," something that says we, you know, we actually think this can persist in a good economy."
"1869170","1872930"," I think it also reflects mistrust of the macro to some degree. "
"1873530","1879310"," And it's also fascinating because you see here the premium of the quality ETF, relative to the S&P"
"1879310","1883190"," 500 at a high, is that it's something that bulls and bears are both on board with."
"1883490","1887010"," And I get a little bit nervous when everybody agrees that this is the way out."
"1887250","1891750"," At this point, how much of the S&P 500 is considered quality given just the recent outperformance"
"1891750","1892690"," of some of those that move out?"
"1892690","1897610"," You see some estimates that it's more like, it's almost like 70% of the market cap is essentially"
"1897610","1897970"," quality. "
"1897970","1901310"," And that's why some people say, well, that's why we can have a higher valuation on the index."
"1901690","1903610"," And that's why it's less cyclical, et cetera."
"1903850","1904130"," We'll see. "
"1904290","1908830"," I mean, anything can be taken too far, but I think it's related to this, do we broaden out or"
"1908830","1913050"," do we not trying to forget more comfort with how the economy is going to persist in here?"
"1913270","1915370"," Meantime, we're going to wrap up January in a few days."
"1915870","1919050"," And there's been some thoughts about the January effect over the weekend."
"1919450","1919810"," Yes. "
"1920090","1924770"," So that whole January indicator, I saw some work that says, yep, we didn't get the Santa Claus"
"1924770","1924970"," rally."
"1925230","1926630"," The first five days weren't positive."
"1926630","1931390"," But if January is OK, then maybe you kind of offset some of that. "
"1931610","1936250"," Not too caught up in that, but I do think the market's pretty well situated in terms of reacting"
"1936250","1937390"," well on good news."
"1938050","1939870"," It's taking credit for a lot, I think."
"1940010","1943130"," It's taking credit for soft land, and it's taking credit for an easier Fed. "
"1943470","1944290"," We'll see if we get it all."
"1945490","1948450"," All right, as we said, it's shaping up to be the busiest week of earnings season."
"1949110","1950590"," We'll talk more about that in a little bit. "
"1950890","1952830"," Results so far, about a third of the S&P is in."
"1953150","1956450"," Almost 20% is reported so far, including five megacaps."
"1956450","1959430"," This week, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet. "
"1959790","1962830"," Let's get to set up for the week ahead with Piper Sandledge, Chief of Investment Strategist,"
"1962910","1966790"," Michael Cantrowitz has an S&P rating of 49.50 joins us this morning."
"1967230","1970570"," Michael, how do you gauge the results we've gotten so far?"
"1972730","1974130"," From earnings or just from the market?"
"1974130","1974590"," More from earnings."
"1975570","1975750"," From earnings. "
"1976110","1977970"," Well, you know, there's a couple ways to look at that."
"1978090","1978890"," We look at earnings surprises."
"1979590","1980690"," We also look at guidance. "
"1981550","1984850"," And I think guidance typically is where you want to focus."
"1986090","1991570"," At the beginning of every quarter, we put at an earnings risk screener, and the companies that we"
"1991570","1996390"," believe that we're most likely to miss, thus far, I think we've seen 75% of the miss with about"
"1996390","1999530"," a median earnings miss of about 20%."
"1999530","2001390"," So, you know, I think it's bifurcated. "
"2001570","2005510"," There's obviously some companies with great reports that have beaten some of that's being coming"
"2005510","2007910"," from pricing, which is still a lagging story."
"2008430","2009510"," So, you know, I think it's been mixed."
"2010150","2017850"," But expectations for the S&P 500, as we sit here today, are for 2024, are at about $242, which"
"2017850","2020790"," is the lowest they've been over the last year and a half. "
"2021730","2026010"," Do you believe that any hopes for a bond rally have started to flatten out?"
"2028590","2030450"," You know, I think that's going to be data-dependent."
"2030930","2036150"," I think the markets in the show me mode, you know, two and a half months ago, when everyone was"
"2036150","2040450"," tripping over themselves, talking about how high yields were going to go, we got some soft macro"
"2040450","2046030"," data in November, and then again in December in payrolls and PMIs, then we got some good inflation"
"2046030","2049610"," data, and then we had the Powell presumably pivot."
"2050330","2055010"," So, we had all of the stars aligning for a bond rally at a time where people were really worried"
"2055010","2055590"," about yields. "
"2056389","2060949"," I don't think we have that same sentiment today, and I think it's going to be a show me with"
"2060949","2062650"," the data that's going to drive yields higher."
"2063030","2067790"," So, we think yields will end the year lower than where they are now, but it's going to be on"
"2067790","2070790"," the back of softer data from inflation and macro."
"2072310","2077969"," Michael, we were just talking in the prior segment with Mike Santoli here about kind of the"
"2077969","2083610"," interplay between quality and uncertainty, and the fact that there was so much uncertainty in 2023,"
"2083770","2086030"," it drove up some of the high-quality names. "
"2086630","2088790"," I'm curious your thoughts in terms of 2024."
"2089090","2093870"," Do you feel like we're in a more uncertain environment currently just given what's going on abroad"
"2093870","2101030"," in China, in the Middle East, geopolitical tensions and the like, or because it seems to be now"
"2101030","2108870"," common, the market is pricing in that we've essentially gotten to this soft landing place that"
"2108870","2114910"," there is more certainty, and therefore quality won't be as big of a part of people's portfolio in"
"2114910","2115450"," 2024."
"2116610","2122290"," Yeah, when I speak to clients, there's certainly a lot of things to be uncertain about, but none of"
"2122290","2127470"," those issues are really front and center and currently creating a lot of fear in the equity market"
"2127470","2133750"," and the two variables that did do that over the last two years, inflation and the Fed, the market"
"2133750","2137010"," has largely priced out that risk or that uncertainty. "
"2138190","2144890"," And so that's what gave us that big rally in November and December last year that the Fed's done,"
"2145070","2147710"," and they're going to cut rates several times this year."
"2148750","2154290"," But what has not changed going back to earnings is the earnings estimates and the earnings outlook."
"2154290","2160010"," We've not seen a sharp improvement in earnings estimates from the bottom in the equity market in"
"2160010","2165750"," October of last year, and that's going to continue, I think, to weigh on some of the more riskier,"
"2166170","2171690"," lower quality names in the equity market, particularly if you don't have bond yields falling lower"
"2171690","2172210"," at your back. "
"2172990","2179030"," I guess the question is, Michael, can the market live with somewhat of a downward revision to"
"2179030","2183010"," forward earnings estimates, let's say, with the second half of this year into next year, because"
"2183010","2188450"," that's the normal course of things, typically they start high and then go lower, or do you actually"
"2188450","2193790"," think that it's going to manifest in, you know, weaker prices across the board, or how's the market"
"2193790","2197390"," going to be able to try and metabolize all that?"
"2197730","2198150"," Sure."
"2198330","2198390"," Yeah."
"2198550","2204650"," On an average year, estimates fall by about six percent from where they start the year, and can the"
"2204650","2205470"," market hold in there?"
"2205550","2206890"," I mean, that's exactly what it's been doing. "
"2207430","2214530"," Tech is the only sector that, you know, and that's true with respect to earnings as well."
"2214830","2220570"," So given how big the weight is in the MAG-7 or in the growthier areas of the equity market,"
"2220750","2224810"," S&P 500 specifically, yeah, the market can hang in there."
"2225390","2230390"," Where we're focused more with clients is, okay, that's fine for the market call, but you all have"
"2230390","2232870"," to buy stocks and position and try to beat the market. "
"2233450","2235490"," Where do you want to be and where do you not want to be?"
"2235610","2241450"," And that's why we still like quality coming into 2024 after it being our top pick for positioning"
"2241450","2241890"," in 23."
"2242770","2249390"," And finally, Michael, within the MAG-7, is it fair to characterize the latter now with Tesla at the"
"2249390","2251350"," bottom and Google meta at the top?"
"2252270","2258890"," Yeah, we did a report a couple or a week ago, and to us last year, you know, when we"
"2258890","2264610"," came into 2023, the market was trading in a very macro way."
"2265030","2270050"," So, you know, we saw all of these stocks take off after getting punished in 2022. "
"2270670","2275510"," I think we're going to continue to see much more differentiation within the MAG-7, i.e."
"2275650","2279370"," fundamentals are going to start to matter a lot more than just the macro backdrop for these stocks."
"2280270","2285350"," And so we like Google and meta, those rank most attractively on our long, fundamentally driven"
"2285350","2285770"," models."
"2286350","2294250"," Don't really show up as any concerns in our short models, whereas Tesla has ranked both poorly in"
"2294250","2298930"," our long model, which looks for quality profitability, lower risk. "
"2298930","2301790"," And high-free cash flow yields."
"2302390","2306770"," And it also ranks poorly in our cell model, which looks for accounting irregularities."
"2308270","2313010"," Yeah, it's been on some lists of earnings quality toward the bottom in recent months. "
"2313670","2314850"," Michael, appreciate that very much."
"2315150","2315530"," Good stuff."
"2315750","2317750"," Michael Cantor, it's over at Piper. "
"2318610","2323430"," All right, the Fed also front and center this week with a rate decision in Powell's news conference"
"2323430","2324010"," on Wednesday."
"2324610","2330230"," Policymakers expect it to hold on rates, but open the door to cuts by removing the tightening bias"
"2330230","2331010"," in its statement."
"2331350","2334830"," Let's bring in .72 asset management chief economist Dean Mackey. "
"2335170","2337250"," He joins us on the CNBC news line."
"2337390","2342750"," And Dean, if you lay it out there, it feels like the eat whatever you want and never gain weight"
"2342750","2343590"," economy, right?"
"2343750","2344630"," Growth better than anticipated."
"2345510","2348670"," Inflation coming down faster than the Fed had projected. "
"2349010","2354230"," And now the market position for the Fed to essentially formalize an easing bias."
"2354630","2356410"," Can we have all that come Wednesday?"
"2356910","2362930"," Yeah, I think it's sort of the best the Fed could really have hoped for at this point."
"2363390","2365610"," You know, they've wanted inflation to come down. "
"2365830","2367910"," They thought it might take a lot of pain to do so."
"2368330","2373290"," But in fact, actually, growth has stepped up rather than slowing down that accompanying that lower"
"2373290","2373670"," inflation."
"2374050","2376790"," So I do think this has been a very nice place right now. "
"2377190","2384630"," And so how do you think in practical terms on Wednesday, the Fed will try to convey the message of"
"2384630","2385330"," its current stance?"
"2385330","2391630"," I mean, you know, a lot of Fed officials, of course, don't want to be too proactive in saying we"
"2391630","2391990"," did it."
"2392130","2393510"," Inflation is taken care of."
"2393630","2395310"," Yet they still have a tightening bias. "
"2395870","2400190"," And the markets are somewhere around 50-50 for rate cuts beginning in March."
"2400470","2401830"," So what's Powell's job on Wednesday?"
"2402750","2408030"," So really, I think Powell's job is to keep the market roughly where it is."
"2408430","2411890"," He doesn't want the market to fully price in a March cut. "
"2412030","2414190"," He doesn't want to fully price it out either."
"2414190","2417470"," So I think what the Fed will do is take away that tightening bias."
"2418670","2421470"," They won't have a particular bias at this meeting. "
"2422170","2424150"," I think he will just speak cautiously."
"2424430","2427630"," He'll talk about how they're going to respond to the totality of the data."
"2427950","2429630"," They're going to be data dependent going forward. "
"2430170","2432370"," And he really wants to just keep all their options open."
"2433210","2438870"," And I suppose in this instance, the data that matter really is just inflation at this point."
"2439010","2444370"," I mean, it seems as if we're past the time when they were targeting other secondary influential"
"2444370","2448030"," factors that would get inflation, they thought where it needed to go, correct?"
"2448210","2453650"," I mean, can we have, you know, 3.1% real GDP economy in the fourth quarter?"
"2453750","2459050"," If that's what we really had and still have inflation go the right way and the Fed say, you know,"
"2459050","2459770"," we might back off. "
"2461050","2463390"," I think it's an open question at this point."
"2463770","2468810"," You know, the Fed's models tell it that policy is quite restrictive right now."
"2468830","2472030"," And that's why they're thinking about cutting rates this year. "
"2472030","2476230"," On the other hand, the economy is not acting like the Fed's really restrictive right now."
"2476350","2479010"," The economic growth has been speeding up, not slowing down."
"2479470","2484190"," And in fact, if you look at the past, when inflation comes down, that tends to be accompanied by"
"2484190","2486830"," strong economic growth, not weak growth. "
"2487470","2493870"," And so the risk for the Fed is if they do what the market's saying and cut multiple times this"
"2493870","2498710"," year, you know, 5 or 6 times like the market has priced in, and the economy is speeding up, you"
"2498710","2503130"," know, that could tighten the labor market, cause wage growth to pick up, and cause an inflation"
"2503130","2506210"," problem down the line that they really wouldn't have had to create."
"2506790","2511010"," So I think they're going to be a little bit cautious about cutting aggressively this year."
"2511210","2515230"," They want to see some evidence that policy is actually slowing the economy down. "
"2515630","2518810"," And we haven't really seen that in any significant way so far."
"2519530","2520930"," No, certainly not."
"2521150","2522150"," Dean, thanks so much. "
"2522150","2523150"," Appreciate the time this morning."
"2523830","2524110"," Great."
"2524310","2524530"," Thank you. "
"2525110","2527610"," As we had to break, here's a roadmap for the rest of the hour."
"2527610","2531610"," The big bet on America's gambling room, family owner Flutter."
"2531890","2533710"," I don't think it's nice to debut today. "
"2533970","2535050"," Flutter CEO joins us next."
"2535450","2538270"," Plus, Tesla kicking off its cyber truck tour in China."
"2539010","2539810"," What's riding on it?"
"2539910","2540670"," We'll head live to Beijing. "
"2541470","2543590"," And shares a so-fi soaring on the back of its earnings."
"2544390","2546430"," Anthony Nodo's going to join us with his outlook for the company."
"2546730","2547430"," Big show still ahead. "
"2548010","2549730"," Squawk in the street is back after the short break."
"2708120","2712600"," What I love about FanDuo and Flutter as well is that they're all about gaming."
"2712900","2716900"," They're the number one online sports betting company in the whole entire world. "
"2717300","2719900"," And they love to do it responsibly as well."
"2720180","2721180"," So you want to bet responsibly."
"2721580","2722620"," There's no doubt about that. "
"2723120","2725180"," You don't want to be putting your whole check on the line."
"2725560","2729700"," Even though some people do, and then it gets really intense, but that's not the way that you're"
"2729700","2730480"," supposed to do it."
"2730560","2734860"," You want to do it responsibly and it intensifies the game that much more. "
"2736060","2740600"," Super Bowl champ Rob Gronkowski with us in the last hour talking about his partnership with FanDuo"
"2740600","2741600"," and the growth of sports betting."
"2741600","2743640"," So we're looking down to the fair and greed index."
"2744080","2748020"," Counting it sitting at 75,100, which indicates extreme greed. "
"2748120","2750060"," On the test of roads, we're here to take zero and greed and sex."
"2750460","2751300"," 55,100."
"2752380","2753180"," You can get rid of greed. "
"2753280","2757080"," Peter Jackson, the CEO of Flutter, you're just standing there at the top, bringing in about what an"
"2757080","2757900"," exciting morning."
"2758220","2759120"," Here's my question."
"2759720","2765660"," If you're number one in market share, if your revenues are growing so substantially and you came"
"2765660","2768680"," out with the trading update that showed that, why does it matter?"
"2769380","2772600"," We're very excited to be launching on the New York Stock Exchange. "
"2773060","2774480"," I mean, yes, business."
"2774780","2777580"," The FanDuo business has been growing enormously in the last few years."
"2778180","2785060"," So it's about to bring the opportunity for US investors to buy FanDuo and also buy our"
"2785060","2785680"," international business. "
"2785920","2786840"," There's something we wanted to do."
"2787020","2788460"," We were delighted to ring."
"2788520","2789840"," I was delighted to ring the bell this morning. "
"2789840","2790400"," It's very cool."
"2790540","2797300"," Just before I came up on a set, I checked where the stock under the ticker symbol FLUT is trading."
"2797840","2798820"," Looks like it was about 2008. "
"2799740","2807220"," What are your expectations for the way that this excites US investors, institutional investors, but"
"2807220","2813000"," also I know you've been missing out on a big share of earned media that DraftKings gets because"
"2813000","2813880"," it's publicly traded?"
"2814120","2817040"," Well, that's exactly why we wanted to have our stock listed here."
"2817040","2820640"," And so to make sure we could take advantage of some of that media coverage."
"2821100","2827300"," I think from our perspective, I've met a lot of domestic US investors who've been wanting to invest"
"2827300","2827860"," in Flutter. "
"2828400","2832320"," The higher levels of liquidity you see on the New York Stock Exchange in comparison with the"
"2832320","2837800"," European exchanges is something which they said will be very attractive and we hope to benefit from"
"2837800","2837960"," that."
"2839160","2844880"," Right now, this is your most important market, the US, for revenue, for growth."
"2844880","2851060"," When does it also overtake the rest of Flutter's international business, the European business and"
"2851060","2852460"," elsewhere in profits?"
"2853540","2858020"," Our international businesses have grown revenues between five and ten percent historically. "
"2858380","2860080"," So it's been a very solid performance."
"2860860","2863420"," We've added to that with M&A that we've made in time."
"2863920","2866280"," Here in the States, it's all been about growth. "
"2866500","2871860"," Clearly we were the first business to become profitable last year with a number one operator here."
"2876960","2880000"," I'm curious about seasonality."
"2880240","2885000"," I assume football is far and away the biggest revenue generator, but there's more frequency in"
"2885000","2885980"," basketball and baseball. "
"2886580","2889380"," I wonder if you see any, that smooths out over time."
"2890000","2893320"," Q4 and Q1 are the most important courses for us."
"2893960","2898640"," Everyone knows that the financial business is synonymous with the Parlay product, and that's"
"2898640","2901580"," particularly relevant for the football. "
"2902660","2909860"," When people can play those same game parlays, that means that our Q4 and Q1 quarters are much"
"2909860","2911760"," bigger for us than the other quarters in the year."
"2912340","2915860"," Outside of the States, this is where you get the benefits of our diversification."
"2916640","2922640"," Of course, you'll see horse racing, soccer, all the other sports that come to fall in the rest of"
"2922640","2923040"," our markets. "
"2923660","2929260"," Peter, I wonder what you think the ultimate size of this market is domestic sports betting and"
"2929260","2933700"," whether in fact the largest first movers have an ongoing advantage."
"2933700","2936480"," I mean, I try to think of other sort of network effects type businesses."
"2936600","2941180"," It doesn't necessarily mean that you need more users to have a better experience as you would for"
"2941180","2942200"," social media, for example. "
"2943320","2946480"," I think for our business, data does help us, right?"
"2946620","2953340"," When I think about the amount of bets we'll have seen during our systems in that line, it means"
"2953340","2957760"," that we can get shopping at our pricing, which means we can offer even better value to our"
"2957760","2958100"," customers."
"2958700","2962340"," It allows us to offer a broader range of markets as well that we can be more accurate with our"
"2962340","2962940"," pricing on."
"2963280","2968680"," So data definitely helps us there, and we're like other digital businesses that the economics flow"
"2968680","2972760"," disproportionately to the scale player because of the operating leverage we get into our business. "
"2973380","2979040"," Look, we are a long way in front in comparison with a lot of other operators in the market."
"2979400","2985140"," Our technology, we get a lot of advantages because we leverage our European teams and their"
"2985140","2986880"," expertise to help us here in the States."
"2987480","2989200"," And I'm sure that we can stay ahead of the competition. "
"2990160","2995300"," When Flutter came out with the trading update, it was clear luck went in the way of the customers"
"2995300","2998760"," in the fourth quarter to the tune of some $300 million, I think."
"2998960","3001120"," DraftKings also reported a similar hit."
"3001680","3002880"," I'm just wondering about the Super Bowl. "
"3003380","3006060"," Now the Chiefs go back in it, you've got the Taylor Swift effect."
"3006600","3012560"," What are you expecting in terms of the game itself and what that means for the overall performance"
"3012560","3013520"," of the Sportsbook?"
"3014180","3019580"," We gave $343 million to our customers in Q4, so we definitely helped the U.S. economy out."
"3020820","3023400"," We know that the Super Bowl is going to be a big event. "
"3023620","3029520"," It was our biggest event last year, but the game last night was the second biggest game we've seen."

"3033320","3034420"," We have no doubt about that. "
"3035300","3040040"," It's a fantastic opportunity for people to try and beat the book."
"3040460","3045460"," They can figure out who's going to score the touchdowns, think about all the different markets we"
"3045460","3046900"," have available and try and beat us."

"3048920","3051380"," There's always things that are happening in Flutter. "

"3064140","3067840"," excited about March Madness and, you know, financials going from strength to strength. "
"3068100","3071900"," I can't get to March Madness yet, because I'm heading to Vegas for Super Bowl."
"3072080","3074100"," Everything in my head is about Super Bowl."
"3074200","3077500"," And whether I'm going to run into Taylor Swift somewhere like Strolling. "
"3077780","3078300"," It could happen."
"3078560","3079600"," That's two Taylor mentions."
"3079960","3083320"," I think we're going to make or miss, right?"
"3083520","3084160"," That's the other question. "
"3084660","3088700"," Well, my bet is on me, because you can't miss two years in a row."
"3088860","3089680"," That would just be too much."
"3089860","3093320"," And Leslie, I know, is betting on the Chiefs, because that's her hometown team. "
"3093320","3096460"," Yeah, my dad was like, I put $100 on the Chiefs last night and made 90."
"3096740","3098080"," So he is fantastic."
"3098680","3099760"," That's the way to do it. "
"3099860","3100860"," We were talking about that."
"3100860","3101600"," I think it was with Fanju."
"3102380","3104220"," He didn't tell me. "
"3104320","3104600"," He didn't tell me."
"3104600","3105420"," He didn't say where he made the bet."
"3105540","3106360"," He just said he made the bet. "
"3106840","3108080"," Thank you for being here today, Peter."
"3108160","3108760"," It was a lot of fun."
"3109020","3109340"," Thank you. "

"3111680","3111940"," Oh, yeah. "
"3112280","3113980"," Not a Taylor Swift band, but a different one."
"3114060","3114300"," Whatever."

"3312180","3312420"," Hi, Eunice."
"3314040","3314800"," Hey, Michael."
"3315160","3319440"," The cyber truck is on display at the Tesla store behind me this weekend. "
"3319860","3326460"," The company started showcasing the futuristic new vehicle in eight Chinese cities, including here"
"3326460","3326920"," in Beijing."
"3327580","3334480"," Now, Tesla continues to be a fan favorite among EV drivers here despite the fierce competition by"
"3334480","3335540"," local brands."
"3335900","3341180"," One of the criticisms though of Tesla is that it doesn't refresh its models quickly enough,"
"3341360","3344240"," especially when compared to some of its Chinese rivals. "
"3344620","3349720"," Now, for this cyber truck, Tesla has not officially announced that the cyber truck would come here"
"3349720","3350040"," to China."
"3350320","3353440"," In fact, Elon Musk has gone on recorders to say that it's going to be difficult."
"3353780","3359300"," And one of the issues has been the regulatory environment, especially around trucks. "
"3359620","3365780"," But one point that was really interesting and picked up upon by a lot of the fans is that the"
"3365780","3371020"," name of the cyber truck in Chinese avoids the word truck."
"3371640","3377840"," So that's seen as a way for Tesla perhaps to eventually launch the cyber truck here."
"3378120","3378300"," Guys?"
"3380180","3384200"," I wonder aside from just sort of the names and what the implications are. "
"3384460","3388100"," I mean, in the U.S., of course, pickup trucks are the most popular type of vehicle."
"3388380","3394200"," What's the case in China in terms of that ready kind of appetite for something that, you know, even"
"3394200","3395400"," vaguely looks like a pickup truck?"
"3397060","3397540"," Right."
"3397800","3403400"," Well, it's interesting because here you really can't get a pickup truck or if you do, you're not"
"3403400","3408300"," able to drive into the city, like into some of that kind of more packed areas. "
"3408980","3410920"," So there are a lot of regulations around it."
"3411400","3417220"," And that's why it's interesting that in the name people, you know, people love to see these big"
"3417220","3417600"," cars."
"3417660","3418800"," They love driving them. "
"3418920","3419780"," That's what they're talking about."
"3420100","3421320"," Everyone's impressed by the size."
"3421520","3422140"," They love the look. "
"3422340","3424760"," They're talking about how it looks like an armored vehicle."
"3424800","3425700"," People loved it."
"3425880","3432100"," But the regulations are such that they don't allow what would be considered a pickup truck into the"
"3432100","3433980"," kind of more packed parts of the city. "
"3433980","3443320"," So the fact that it was called an urban traveling wagon, maybe not so catchy, but maybe it could"
"3443320","3444720"," get you around some of the regulations."
"3445260","3446580"," Urban traveling wagon."
"3447040","3450720"," We've got some country singers that may want to alter their songs out here. "
"3451340","3456520"," You know, I just wanted to pivot quickly to another story, of course, that's big news in China."
"3456780","3462080"," That's, of course, the liquidation order from the Hong Kong court of Evergrande."
"3462400","3468300"," What is the sentiment currently right now on the ground in Beijing as it relates to this and how is"
"3468300","3471780"," it kind of the seminal moment for the property sector there?"
"3473380","3473900"," Right. "
"3474020","3480580"," Well, in terms of home buyers, it's just seen as another big weight that's been put on the property"
"3480580","3481080"," sector."
"3481180","3483500"," People are wondering, what does all this mean?"
"3483960","3488840"," You know, I don't know whether or not I should continue to go ahead with the purchase of"
"3488840","3489460"," Evergrande."
"3489500","3494600"," If people have even worked, there are a lot of questions about what this means for its ability to"
"3494600","3496640"," finance its projects. "
"3497280","3504440"," The company's CEO has been trying to calm people down by saying that for sure they are going to"
"3504440","3510160"," deliver on these homes, that they are going to be business as normal as much as they can."
"3510780","3518980"," But from a, you know, just from an investor perspective, for some of these creditors, I was talking"
"3518980","3524780"," to one earlier today and they said, you know, one of the main issues at this point is whether or"
"3524780","3531240"," not the court decision in Hong Kong is going to be recognized by the Chinese courts."
"3531780","3537060"," And will they cooperate with the Hong Kong decision because there are so many political reasons why"
"3537060","3546220"," the Chinese government, which controls the courts, would not want to have what would be the"
"3546220","3552960"," decision being kind of forced upon the Chinese system, especially when it could potentially create"
"3552960","3557940"," so much instability in the property sector at a time when there's just so much instability among"
"3557940","3559960"," investors and in what's going on in this economy. "
"3560660","3565820"," Hey, finally, Eunice, you know, we had Tesla earnings last week, and as part of the call, Elon Musk"
"3565820","3571820"," did say that China EV makers would, quote, demolish American EV companies without trade barriers."
"3571940","3577700"," I wonder how that resonated in the country or whether or not his calculus in China is giving"
"3577700","3577900"," tougher."
"3578200","3578640"," It was actually championed. "
"3579220","3581000"," I was reading that a lot in state media."
"3581000","3588580"," People were quoting Elon Musk saying that China was going to demolish the US EV makers or car"
"3588580","3588940"," makers."
"3589580","3595060"," And one of the ways in which China feels proud is that they are pushing out a lot of these"
"3595060","3600420"," cars, but I think at the same time, several car analysts who I speak to say that this is something"
"3600420","3606860"," that US automakers should be concerned about as well as European automakers should be concerned"
"3606860","3614800"," about because there is so much overcapacity over here when it comes to EVs as well as other types"
"3614800","3619060"," of cars, and a lot of that is getting pushed out overseas. "
"3620720","3622380"," Fascinating, Eunice, appreciate it."

"3900000","3904380"," Our next guest has a new op-ed in the FT today discussing why political leaders are so unpopular"
"3904380","3905020"," right now."
"3905420","3908200"," Rockefeller International Chairman Rashir Sharma joins us this morning."
"3908340","3909380"," It's great to have you back. "
"3909920","3910640"," Fascinating piece."
"3911000","3917020"," You look at 20 democracies all around the world and try to explain why their overall approval"
"3917020","3918140"," ratings are so low."
"3918880","3919660"," Yeah, Carl. "
"3920140","3926800"," Joe Biden's approval ratings get so much attention here and rightly so because they're close to"
"3926800","3927460"," record lows."
"3928100","3932800"," But what if I'm remarkable is that if you look at the approval ratings of leaders across the"
"3932800","3935660"," developed world, there's rarely been this low."
"3935860","3938640"," In fact, they are lower than even Joe Biden's approval ratings. "
"3939460","3945800"," There's not a single leader across the developed world where the approval rating is more than 50%."
"3945800","3949600"," And most of the approval ratings are trending down."
"3949980","3957440"," So there's something deep going on here as to why leaders are so unpopular around the world and why"
"3957440","3963180"," so many of them are probably bound to use their re-election bid as a point out of the piece"
"3963180","3967020"," that normally being the incumbent gave you the advantage. "
"3967760","3973820"," 70% of incumbents would typically end up winning elections with this stood as the head of"
"3973820","3974100"," government."
"3974780","3981460"," In the last few years, only 30% of people standing for re-election have been coming back to office."
"3981900","3987900"," So that's what's really going on out here, which is very unpopular leaders and most voters are"
"3987900","3990580"," deeply unsatisfied with what their choices are. "
"3991020","3995820"," It's easy to look at social media and sort of the Yelp effect where being negative kind of sells"
"3995820","3997000"," and engages."
"3997000","4001860"," But are you on the lookout as a result for policy volatility around the world?"
"4002560","4008380"," Yeah, I think that the big market implication and the economic implication of what's going on given"
"4008380","4015440"," this is that the temptation on the part of leaders is just to spend more to spend their way out"
"4015440","4015900"," of trouble."
"4016300","4020020"," Typically in an election year, leaders tend to spend anyway. "
"4020460","4026300"," And I think in a year like this, they are going to be even more inclined to spend because that's"
"4026300","4028900"," the easiest way they think for buying votes."
"4029140","4034660"," The problem is, as you know, in many countries, the budget deficit levels are very high today, much"
"4034660","4036320"," higher than they've ever been."
"4036540","4042980"," So I think that we are setting up for this tussle here where the politicians need or think they"
"4042980","4043860"," need to spend more. "
"4044500","4047400"," And yet you have the bond markets."
"4047860","4051280"," I think we'll start worrying about the budget deficits."
"4051580","4057220"," Again, those bodies were there last fall and they faded as the rate cut euphoria set in. "
"4057500","4062640"," I suspect sometime this year concerns about the white budget deficits and what unpopular"
"4062640","4065920"," politicians are going to do to try and win their way back."
"4066440","4068320"," I think it's going to be an important clash."
"4068660","4069200"," That's going to happen. "
"4069780","4070300"," Interesting."
"4070460","4076180"," So there's a direct correlation then you believe between incumbents with low approval ratings and"
"4076180","4080360"," the deficit spending that they tend to run up potentially in their final year in office."
"4080860","4087460"," So given kind of the overall mantra around the world, what do you think that means, just to kind of"
"4087460","4093300"," follow up on Carl's question, particularly as it pertains to volatility as we get closer and closer"
"4093300","4095140"," to some of these key elections?"
"4096000","4096479"," Yeah. "
"4096720","4103140"," I think that the bond market is going to demand a higher term premium for sure because in terms of"
"4103140","4110180"," the fact that, you know, once this disinflation feeds and people factor in the two percent rate"
"4110180","4116460"," that they have, you know, as the Fed's target, I think that rates just don't go back down like they"
"4116460","4119500"," did in the past in disinflation cycles."
"4119500","4124779"," You know, it's possible that even in a recession this time that 10 year in the U.S. doesn't fall"
"4124779","4126460"," much below 3% or something."
"4126460","4132920"," So I think a much higher term premium is what the bond market is going to demand and politicians, I"
"4132920","4138500"," think, are going to learn the hard way that if they're going to try and spend too much, the bond"
"4138500","4142380"," market is going to revolve against it because the levels are so high. "
"4142520","4148180"," The deficit levels everywhere are so much higher and the U.S. is obviously an exhibit A in that."
"4149300","4154760"," Richard, if that's the cost, though, of this level of deficit spending around the world, that in a"
"4154760","4159160"," recession maybe we don't have inflation and yields go as low as they did in the past."
"4159380","4161680"," Is that an acceptable one, do you think, for the markets?"
"4162240","4167260"," Even it seems as if we've tried to find a new equilibrium here with, you know, let's say U.S."
"4167260","4170279"," 10 year round four and around the world a little lower than that. "
"4171080","4176420"," Yeah, but as you say that we are finding a new equilibrium because of a given where inflation is"
"4176420","4183420"," headed now in terms of, you know, back to 2% for now, I'd say that people are getting very"
"4183420","4185819"," excited about how much more yields can fall from here."
"4186100","4191880"," And my point is I'm just not sure that yields can fall that much more that the sensitivity has"
"4191880","4192260"," changed."
"4192260","4196160"," So much higher term premium is what I expect. "
"4196540","4200540"," But of course, there are many factors which determine what's happening in the bond market."
"4200800","4205620"," But the U.S. I think is really, you know, this is where I think that even the fiscal impulse"
"4205620","4209220"," which has been helping growth in the U.S. is possibly underappreciated."
"4209900","4216200"," But I think that the really problematic case is this for Biden and other political leaders, that"
"4216200","4221380"," the connection between good economic data and their political support has broken down. "
"4221380","4226920"," Given where inflation currently is, given where unemployment currently is, you would expect there"
"4226920","4228700"," are approval ratings to get a huge lift."
"4229080","4229960"," It's just not happening."
"4230120","4231980"," And it's not the U.S. anywhere in the world. "
"4232400","4234940"," In the developed world, it's not happening."
"4235120","4240700"," The very interestingly, a nice side story here is that in emerging markets, leaders in many"
"4240700","4242780"," countries are still relatively popular."
"4243240","4245100"," They're still faith in the system. "
"4245620","4250480"," But I think that the problem here is that given the problems of income inequality, lack of social"
"4250480","4257580"," and economic mobility, a feeling of an unfairness in the system, this connection that the"
"4257580","4264840"," historically had between economic data, near economic data, and political support has broken down."
"4265160","4268180"," Yeah, sentiment indicators are broken in many ways."
"4268180","4270100"," We're sure it's a fascinating piece in the FT. "
"4270380","4271200"," Everybody should take a look."
"4271660","4272220"," Thanks for the time."

"4470020","4474800"," SoFi reporting its first profitable quarter surpassing analyst expectations that the company would"
"4474800","4475360"," break even. "
"4475700","4478280"," Shares popping double digits on those strong results."
"4478720","4480320"," Almost up 23% right now."
"4480800","4482960"," CEO Anthony Nodo joins us. "
"4483400","4484780"," Anthony, thanks for being here."
"4485000","4485880"," Big quarter for you all."
"4486540","4489240"," Profitable one, record revenue across the three businesses. "
"4489960","4492700"," Solid profitable outlook as well."
"4493200","4495700"," What are some of the key drivers that you think led to these results?"
"4496820","4498320"," Well, Leslie, thank you for having me on."
"4498680","4504780"," You know, I'd say the strategy overalls really come into play and delivered exceptional results for"
"4504780","4505100"," the quarter. "
"4505580","4510220"," Six years ago, we embarked on this very ambitious strategy to be a one-stop shop for all your"
"4510220","4511280"," financial services needs."
"4511280","4516340"," When I joined the company in February of 2018, we're primarily just a lender and two products."
"4516920","4522100"," Today, we offer not just four types of loans, including home loans, but we also offer SoFi money,"
"4522340","4524000"," which is a modern checking and savings account. "
"4524000","4531380"," SoFi invest, SoFi credit card, insurance products, and we also power 140 million accounts across"
"4531380","4535780"," the FinTech industry through our technology platform that we outsource to our partners."
"4536580","4541260"," This quarter really reflects the fact that the financial services segment is now profitable and"
"4541260","4542380"," growing quite meaningfully."
"4542740","4545620"," The tech platform business is also profitable with accelerating growth. "
"4546200","4550760"," And that's really the drivers of growth going in 2024 and less of the lending pieces."
"4551000","4555980"," So it was a combination of that strategy over the last six years being invested in and then coming"
"4555980","4562480"," to fruition in 2023 with record revenue of over $2 billion in record EBITDA and actually hitting"
"4562480","4564860"," our long-term EBITDA margins at 30%."
"4564860","4568960"," And as you mentioned, gap profitability for the first time, which will sustain in 2024. "
"4568960","4575340"," Yeah, and of course, this all comes against a macroeconomic backdrop that for a lot of lenders"
"4575340","4576180"," remains uncertain."
"4576860","4582880"," And you have a pretty conservative outlook for 2024, baking in a 5% unemployment rate, four rate"
"4582880","4585560"," cuts, which is, of course, fewer than the market is pricing in."
"4585820","4591640"," So what are you seeing in terms of customer spending trends, portfolio quality that is helping to"
"4591640","4593120"," inform your outlook for 2024?"
"4593860","4597780"," Yeah, you know, as you mentioned, we did take a very conservative view in the lending part of the"
"4597780","4598580"," business for 24. "
"4599260","4605180"," We are expecting 75% year-of-year revenue growth in our financial services segment and 20% year-of "
"4605180","4606720","-year revenue growth in a tech platform."
"4607260","4610200"," And really no growth in lending because of that conservative view that we're taking."
"4610600","4612340"," We do expect credit to normalize. "
"4612340","4617060"," We're seeing those trends across the industry as well as at SOFI, and so we're taking a very"
"4617060","4617980"," cautious view there."
"4618280","4624660"," In terms of underlying spending trends within SOFI money, we had $1.6 billion of point-of-sale"
"4624660","4626160"," debit spending in the quarter."
"4626360","4628740"," That's annual, annualized at about $6 billion. "
"4629340","4630780"," It's up three eggs from a year ago."
"4631380","4634940"," We're seeing strength within existing accounts, but we're also adding new counts."
"4635080","4636140"," So it could be a little bit misleading. "
"4637120","4641400"," In addition to that, we have been observers of the broader market dynamics."
"4641880","4645280"," We've seen some levels of liquidity dry up in certain markets."
"4645900","4652000"," In addition to that, the largest banks have seen an increase relative to seven to 10-year highs in"
"4652000","4653300"," write-offs, delinquencies. "
"4653920","4658060"," And then the provisions for losses of one of the largest banks were up 50% sequentially."
"4658340","4663220"," So we're really bullish about our financial services segment, which is growing quite well, 75% for"
"4663220","4666620"," next year and tech platform, but conservative on the lending side."
"4667280","4667880"," Hey, Anthony. "
"4668160","4672560"," Some of the macro stuff that got commentary in the earnings last week was about real wage growth"
"4672560","4676040"," rising again after two years of shrinking."
"4676040","4679280"," Is that starting to make itself felt within the metrics?"
"4680480","4683240"," We're not actually seeing an impact on spending."
"4683620","4687380"," We are obviously seeing a normalization of credit back to pre-COVID levels. "
"4688100","4690340"," So that's where it's showing up on the spending side."
"4690480","4691340"," That is still strong."
"4691600","4696340"," But the credit side across the industry, as well as at SOFI, is definitely normalizing, which is"
"4696340","4697600"," why we're taking a conservative view. "
"4698320","4703820"," The unique thing for SOFI is that in 24, 50% of our revenue will be from technology platform"
"4703820","4707020"," revenue and financial services, and 50% from lending."
"4707420","4709520"," In previous years, it was as high as 80%."
"4709520","4714860"," So we gained scale and profitability in those two segments just in the right time as we entered"
"4714860","4717660"," 2024 and the concerns on the credit side. "
"4717980","4723340"," Yeah, with the technology business in particular, we're nearly a year out from the Select Regional"
"4723340","4726160"," Bank failures that we saw last spring."
"4726520","4733020"," What's been the impact on your business as we kind of think about the overall impact from those"
"4733020","4736840"," failures and the reshaping of the way that the banking system operates?"
"4737800","4743720"," Through our technology platform, services enable not just FinTech companies to provide services"
"4743720","4748720"," through payment processing, poor technology, but we're also enabling large brands that want to be"
"4748720","4749880"," in the financial services sector."
"4750420","4754440"," But the thing that we've seen the biggest surge in is the demand from traditional financial banks,"
"4754520","4755720"," the largest banks in our company. "
"4755720","4761100"," It's clearly a trend of them having to upgrade their technology to upgrade their core technology"
"4761100","4765240"," and their processing technology, so they have better real-time asset and liability management."
"4765840","4770200"," Having the real-time asset and liability management we have through our technology platform is an"
"4770200","4770640"," advantage."
"4771240","4775400"," And I think some of the liquidity issues that we saw in the spring of our largest banks were a"
"4775400","4777720"," direct result of not having that technology capability. "
"4778600","4782980"," And so we're seeing robust demand and RFPs from the top banks in the country in addition to the"
"4782980","4784520"," other pockets of strength that I mentioned."
"4785040","4790160"," These things take quarters not months to get through, but we're in the RFP process with a number of"
"4790160","4790660"," large banks."
"4791160","4795840"," We're fortunate early in the year to win one small regional bank deal, but it's going to be an"
"4795840","4797520"," added growth vehicle for the tech platform. "
"4797960","4799500"," Interesting, definitely a space to watch."
"4800140","4804740"," Anthony Noto, thank you very much for being here, CEO of SOFI on today's earnings results."
"4805400","4806100"," Thank you, Leslie. "

"4999600","5001540"," He's tracking today's biggest analyst calls. "
"5001660","5002180"," Good morning, Dom."
"5002280","5004380"," All right, so Mike, let's focus on mega-cap technology."
"5004740","5006600"," We'll get through as many of these analyst calls as we can. "
"5007140","5010560"," Starting with meta-platforms, it's getting a little help from the team at Jeffries."
"5010780","5016060"," They raised their target price for the social media parent of Facebook and Instagram to 455 bucks."
"5016200","5016700"," It was 425. "
"5017720","5018400"," They keep the buy rating."
"5018840","5022800"," They decided things like expectations for revenues to come at the higher end of previous guidance"
"5022800","5025280"," for both last quarter and the current one as well."
"5025440","5026660"," So watch those shares up 1%. "
"5026660","5031000"," Jeffries is also, by the way, reiterating its buy rating on Microsoft, the business software"
"5031000","5035680"," solutions cloud computing AI giant is also getting its target price raised to 465 bucks."
"5035680","5036820"," It was 450."
"5037620","5042160"," They cited things like being the beneficiary of improving cloud computing trends, also those in"
"5042160","5043080"," artificial intelligence. "
"5043920","5047540"," That's one member of the trillion dollar market cap club up one and a half percent right now."
"5047920","5052840"," And of course, the other one is Apple, but this morning, analysts at Barclays have reiterated their"
"5052840","5055580"," underweight or sell rating on the iPhone and app services giant."
"5055900","5061940"," They cited things like what they view as lackluster iPhone 15 sales with expectations that won't"
"5061940","5066700"," change with the iPhone 16 alongside overhangs from regulatory risk. "
"5067100","5069700"," Also an elevated valuation compared to the S&P 500."
"5070000","5072080"," So those shares down fractionally three quarters of one percent."
"5072540","5074480"," Leslie, I will send things back over to you. "
"5074660","5075540"," Dom, thank you."

"5322600","5325560"," But for the time being, Nasdaq is the sole index in the green."
"5325780","5330240"," A lot of narratives for investors to focus on this week, including that highly anticipated Fed"
"5330240","5330520"," meeting."
"5330940","5335300"," While no one expects a cut this week, the market is expecting more than four cuts for the rest of"

"5346780","5347320"," It's always a pleasure."
"5348280","5349020"," Thank you, Carl."
"5349240","5349760"," Great to be here. "
"5349760","5353500"," We've been sort of taking in commentary from former Fed officials."
"5354220","5355760"," I think Evans and Bullard."
"5356320","5359880"," Give us your take on where you see market expectations right now. "
"5361000","5366240"," I think there's an excessive optimism that's spread in the market."
"5366940","5370160"," And I think some of that may have spilled over to the committee itself."
"5370560","5375560"," I think that the Fed was very fortunate last year to have inflation come down as rapidly in as far"
"5375560","5376120"," as it did. "
"5376120","5378680"," But there by no means done yet."
"5379080","5383360"," You've got strong real spending growth as shown in the third quarter."
"5383560","5387980"," And now the fourth quarter GDP report continuing no signs of recession. "
"5388940","5393280"," Wage growth is still not consistent with a 2% inflation rate."
"5393780","5397560"," You'll see average early earnings numbers in the employment report on Friday."
"5398000","5403280"," But those are contaminated by very serious composition effects composition shifting over a time"
"5403280","5405540"," over time in a way that distorts the number. "
"5405540","5412140"," The more the indicators that back that out like the E.C.I. and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta"
"5412140","5417080"," wage tracker show a wage inflation still not consistent 2% inflation."
"5417540","5423840"," And it's still not obvious that inflation expectations have come down all the way to being"
"5423840","5425100"," consistent with 2%."
"5425100","5426740"," And they're certainly not anchored. "
"5427020","5429160"," So I think standing patch should be the watchword."
"5429320","5432860"," That should be the default scenario at least through the middle of the year."
"5432860","5437640"," Barring any sudden big surprise shot to the economy. "
"5438000","5443400"," The equity bulls are entranced by this six month annualized figure where it shows we've essentially"
"5443400","5447940"," been a target for whatever it is six or seven of the past few of the past seven months."
"5448760","5453880"," I'm looking at a note this morning warning is that sometimes those figures can be revised higher as"
"5453880","5454720"," they were back in 03."
"5455080","5455780"," Is that something to watch?"
"5456560","5463120"," Oh yeah I mean there's a big CPI revision coming and that data is the groundwork for the PCE"
"5463120","5464160"," inflation number. "
"5464800","5471140"," In addition you have residual seasonality you have to worry about the process of backing out"
"5471140","5477040"," seasonal factors is imperfect and sometimes gets a little polluted from time to time and a set of"
"5477040","5480060"," months in the year can be stronger or weaker than average."
"5480060","5488460"," So yeah and besides it's going to take a year or two for them to feel confident about inflation"
"5488460","5490120"," having returned to 2%."
"5490120","5494380"," So yeah again I think the markets are getting a little heavy themselves here. "
"5494680","5498240"," Jeff what do you think in terms of a recession this year?"
"5498940","5504160"," Do you believe that we have averted some sort of hard landing at this point and if so is it"
"5504160","5508820"," still likely that we get so many rate cuts as the market is anticipating?"
"5509820","5514900"," So I don't see any signs of a recession on the horizon."
"5515500","5520640"," I'm wary of aeronautical metaphors all metaphors really for monetary policy."
"5521220","5528700"," To paraphrase I don't think about the price of freedom I think that the eternal vigilance is the"
"5528700","5532740"," price for a central bank of maintaining price stability. "
"5533660","5537940"," So I think that's especially true given the episode the fence come true."
"5538400","5545060"," This was a significant failure of monetary policy for to have inflation deviate so far and for so"
"5545060","5546000"," long from target."
"5546540","5552360"," I think the fence credibility is damaged I think that they should avoid declaring victory or"
"5552360","5557960"," declaring that they've landed and are texting to the gate or any of that stuff. "
"5557960","5565280"," I think the watchword for them is going to have to be reestablishing their credibility and re"
"5565280","5567140"," anchoring inflation expectations."
"5567680","5575280"," And still for the foreseeable future their credibility and that the anchoring of inflation is going"
"5575280","5576520"," to be a tentative matter."
"5576700","5581300"," They're going to have to be on their game and they don't want to reverse course so I think they're"
"5581300","5584860"," going to be averse to cutting rates too soon. "
"5584860","5591520"," Not to continue the metaphor that I know you despise but if you kind of think about the the"
"5591520","5596480"," different bolts on the doors and the key indicators that you think they should be watching that"
"5596480","5597950"," you're watching what would they be?"
"5616350","5622030"," I think if they come in around 3% and that seems plausible and consistent with the current outlook"
"5622030","5627390"," you know if they come in around 3% for a year they're going to need to think about whether"
"5627390","5627930"," they need to think about the inflation numbers and then come in on a sustainable basis very close"
"5627930","5627930"," to 2%."
"5628690","5636170"," And so I think they're wary of things getting entrenched a bit above 2% maybe not 5% but"
"5636170","5642510"," 3% inflation for a while and I think that would be a hard case for them towards the end"
"5642510","5642890"," of the year."
"5643390","5647750"," Hey finally Jeff over the weekend the Journal quotes Esther George just talking about the labor"
"5647750","5651810"," market how it's often tricky and when it does stumble it tends to stumble hard. "
"5651810","5656450"," Goldman which by the way is in the March camp wrote over the weekend the labor market could still"
"5656450","5659490"," provide additional reasons to cut sooner rather than later."
"5659970","5662210"," I mean how how vigilant do we have to be on labor weakness?"
"5662930","5671210"," Oh you know always but you look at initial claims you look at vacancies relative to unemployed and"
"5671210","5678170"," there isn't any sign of a break you know of a of a dip coming in labor market conditions."
"5678170","5681710"," So yeah I think things look fine on the labor market. "
"5681890","5685250"," Yeah hard to argue when claims roll in every Thursday."
"5685970","5689250"," Jeff appreciate it very much as we await the decision this week."
"5689590","5690250"," Jeffrey Lacker. "
"5690350","5690490"," Thanks."
"5692390","5695190"," Let's turn to the airlines Ryan air backing Boeing."
"5695450","5698190"," This morning meanwhile the jet blue spirit merger remains in limbo. "
"5698530","5701230"," Philippo has more on both of those stories."
"5701230","5703390"," Phil never a dull day on your beat."
"5704630","5706970"," No and it's been busy particularly lately. "
"5706970","5712870"," Let's start first off with Ryan air which reported its results early this morning and while the"
"5712870","5716550"," results were shy of expectations with regard to the last quarter."
"5717010","5721170"," The company also gave some guidance narrowed the profit guidance but didn't lower it."

"8986680","8992360"," the charts microsoft's up eight percent Amazons up four and a half percent alphabet up nine percent"
"8992960","8997120"," Metas 12 and a half in video doesn't report this week, but it's up 24 So the gains have been"
"8997120","9002680"," substantial over the first three and a half weeks of this year Yeah, I do think there is a big"
"9002680","9006720"," deal in the fact that we've seen a lot of the expectations being built into the price action That"
"9006720","9009960"," we've had and that was you know one of the reasons why I look at it with a little bit"
"9009960","9014820"," of caution Mission less we've been in video at AMD But I'm looking at I think microsoft to your"
"9014820","9020980"," point is the biggest one They are the leader bringing AI to the marketplace first and they're"
"9020980","9026400"," monetizing it and by monetizing it The revenues are flowing to Nvidia and AMD So I think a lot is"
"9026400","9027400"," going to be tied onto that. "
"9027400","9031620"," Are they are they monetizing it properly then eat alphabet number two Then you know, where's the"
"9031620","9032060"," cloud direction?"
"9032300","9036040"," So there's a lot out there right now I mean if they miss a little bit like you mentioned I"
"9036040","9040440"," don't think it's going to be market over But if there is a if there's a big whiff somewhere there's"
"9040440","9044880"," a lot of fear that it could show up somewhere else Why why is it is it all about microsoft?"
"9045260","9050680"," You know tomorrow after the bell because look Dan Ives thinks it is Said it's the most important"
"9050680","9057080"," earnings report and conference call of this season Barons says okay microsoft's now the most"
"9057080","9058060"," valuable company now."
"9058220","9065480"," It has to prove it can stay there From a valuation standpoint It has expanded greater over its 10"
"9065480","9077510"," year historical average than any of the others 23.9 10 year average 33 0.1 today assess that So"
"9077510","9084930"," here's why I'd say I'd say it is the most important Report of the week until Wednesday So you have"
"9084930","9090730"," so much news coming after Wednesday that microsoft's going to be in the rear view window window So"
"9090730","9095250"," with Wednesday, we've got the Fed and then we've got three more important tech companies Actually,"
"9095510","9101150"," you take take one of those out of take apple because apple is Has very low expectations despite"
"9101150","9106670"," stock holding up fairly well and I believe those expectations will be met But you've got other"
"9106670","9112170"," important companies So yes most important of the year the most important of the decade for that"
"9112170","9117710"," afternoon and for Wednesday morning And then it's on to other things look you can take a look at a"
"9117710","9123970"," company like tesla That really disappointed that really missed that's much more elevated maybe not"
"9123970","9129830"," historically But much more elevated to their growth and everything else than microsoft is and that"
"9129830","9133610"," stocks bouncing back Since the disastrous report last week."
"9133790","9138950"," So the market to joe's point is pretty forgiving I do think there's going to be a constant bit for"
"9138950","9144790"," tech and microsoft should have an elevated valuation to what it had because you're entirely on the"
"9144790","9152150"," Cost of an entirely new product cycle that's driven by AI And the company's also changed over the"
"9152150","9155270"," last 10 years with this massive Recurring red view stream. "
"9155650","9160650"," So we can parse where the valuation is much too high whether it's too low or if you take a"
"9160650","9166430"," view Longer than tuesday afternoon I think you'll do quite well with the stock over time as with"
"9166430","9172430"," the others and that doesn't speak to what I continue to believe Is a new population that's come"
"9172430","9178770"," into the market That's less driven by individual data points for more than a nanosecond and"
"9178770","9183370"," continues to like what they know What's familiar with them and that's microsoft."
"9183690","9184110"," That's google."
"9184670","9189690"," That's meta, which I think is really doing quite well So yeah, so I I think the mark is okay"
"9189690","9193970"," That's some point though joe You know you got to decide what you're willing to pay for all the"
"9193970","9199070"," attributes that wice was talking about for You know these companies that are betting big on this"
"9199070","9205850"," transformational technology second agi over Bernstein Says he struggles to recommend an overweight"
"9205850","9211050"," for tech because they're expensive on an absolute or historical basis We gave you what the 10 year"
"9211050","9218010"," averages are versus what they're trading at today, you know apple is 10 10 times higher or 10"
"9218010","9225470"," points higher is 18.9 10 10 year 28 today Told you what microsoft is as well jonathan krinsky btig"

"9231370","9239910"," I'm not sure I see the signs of exhaustion just just yet I think that there still is as steve"

"9253610","9258290"," something that that i'm sure is going to be greeted with a lot of skepticism And probably a degree"
"9258290","9265010"," of criticism, but we keep looking at these megacap companies and we keep Referring back to the"
"9265010","9267450"," historical valuation of these companies. "
"9267890","9272850"," Maybe that's the wrong exercise Maybe it's the wrong exercise to think about these companies in the"
"9272850","9279430"," past And not realize that maybe there's a valuation reset going on given the advancement of the"
"9279430","9284090"," innovation Well, not maybe I think there's points well taken and fair I mean there obviously has"
"9284090","9290910"," been a valuation reset for some of these companies The question is are we putting the cart before"
"9290910","9291330"," the horse?"
"9291830","9297690"," Are we assuming that they're going to reap the rewards and benefits that the market has already"
"9297690","9304370"," priced in For for many of these names now, but the earnings have supported that to do Microsoft and"
"9304370","9311350"," Nvidia Are proving to be able to monetize AI in a way that some of these others aren't Those rising"
"9311350","9316270"," tides have lifted a lot of boats Now the proofs in the pudding as to whether the boats deserve to"
"9316270","9322990"," be at the same level with those yachts Yeah, but specific to alphabet specific to Nvidia specific"
"9322990","9330310"," to Microsoft There's there's enough clear evidence there to suggest that We might see valuations"
"9330310","9337470"," grow even richer than where they are now and it is warranted So I just think be careful relying on"
"9337470","9344970"," historical valuation exercise to determine Your positioning in a particular mega cap mega cap Not"
"9344970","9348870"," the derivatives off the mega I got you you want to weigh in on that on that bill I mean"

"9358250","9362250"," You better hope they go well Yeah, I mean I really do hope they go well I think they can"
"9362250","9366730"," and why don't we have a mission is Amazon and Amazon is the highest multiple the entire group I"
"9366730","9372650"," really think here if They've been seeing some really great tailwinds with margins in retail as well"
"9372650","9378610"," the juggernaut of AWS I mean if we continue to see revenue growth at that pace and better I think"
"9378610","9383490"," the what we're seeing is is the multiples will continue to come down as we look out And those are"
"9383490","9387930"," going to be as many continue tailwind for the market and that's huge for these big names right now"
"9387930","9390350"," Well, AWS is really wise."
"9390690","9397250"," I think It's it's changed the game in terms of how you read where Amazon is trading Amazon has"
"9397250","9403090"," always been at a historically expensive valuation and in the past you're like Wow, you know, I'm"
"9403090","9408350"," going to pay a hundred times for a marketplace business I mean how much can that really continue to"
"9408350","9416890"," grow but AWS has changed the game Enough that the forward PE on Amazon today is 42 It's not the"
"9416890","9425730"," triple digit one that it's lived with for most most of its history Yep Exactly and think about it"
"9425730","9428070"," now The vanity projects are gone. "
"9428250","9433990"," They've gotten religion like all the other tech companies coming out of the pandemic on spending So"
"9433990","9441350"," jassy has done a very good job of allocating capital to each business And when you look at AWS"

"9447290","9452930"," year But now it starts to re-accelerate as we saw the last quarter What what's what's lost in this"
"9452930","9459530"," conversation though is AWS signed a 10 billion dollar contract With Microsoft to use their tools in"
"9459530","9464630"," their cloud business So when you take a look at cloud we've been talking about it for more than a"
"9464630","9471710"," decade But still it's less than corporate corporations around the world are still Less than 30"
"9471710","9476930"," percent of the cloud right now So you've got that massive transition is going to continue and"
"9476930","9484410"," accelerate as more computing power requires more cloud usage So that's a big big tailwind But you"
"9484410","9490230"," know just go back to my prior comments You know I would say to krinsky that that when when you"

"9495190","9501550"," anything But but I do think at some point it's only natural to see a pause in the acceleration in"
"9501550","9507410"," the market Will the core will this quarter's earnings give it reason if that pause maybe but we"
"9507410","9511650"," can't keep going like we are right now Now what can make me wrong?"
"9512150","9518050"," What can make me wrong is the Fed really changes their language What can make me wrong Also on the"
"9518050","9524530"," other side is if the US goes into Iran and that'll be a knee jerk reaction because then think what"

"9609270","9613770"," more than normal for us to be in a consolidation range for us to get earnings from megacap"
"9613770","9619150"," technology Whether they're disappointing or whether they exceed expectations and for the market to"
"9619150","9624570"," retreat in somewhat of a consolidation phase Above forty eight ten below forty nine hundred and"

"9633850","9639490"," get back in when the prevailing bull trend starts up again I had a conversation with uh the worton"
"9639490","9644230"," professor jeremy segal on friday about where his expectations are for where the market can go Over"
"9644230","9648790"," the remainder of the year whether it's too expensive now I want you to listen to what he told me"
"9648790","9657430"," sure he's bullish but listen I'm still positive on the market We are selling for 20 times earnings"
"9657430","9662470"," Although I mean if you're a growth stock you're telling at 25 to 30 if you're a value stock you're"
"9662470","9670370"," selling at 1514 So there is a difference Overall 20 It's okay. "
"9670570","9678750"," It's not cheap And I still think we can get 8 to 10 for the year I said the economy"
"9678750","9688150"," is still very strong I think we're actually going to beat 242 earnings on the s&p 500 and As"
"9688150","9691650"," a result, I think stocks could advance 8 to 10 percent."
"9691650","9692310"," That's the professor."
"9693050","9693710"," What do we think?"
"9694010","9698230"," Yeah, well, I think the I think the market to joe's point in a consolidation here would be really"
"9698230","9703050"," healthy Um, but we could still grind higher if a rotation happens some of the some of the steam"
"9703050","9708590"," that really drove this Megat megacab tech maybe earnings pre-pricing themselves in and then to the"
"9708590","9714170"," Goldman Sachs note tony's note there Um, in order to have such a vicious move to the upside There"
"9714170","9717630"," needs to be money on the sidelines to feel that and why was the money on the on the sidelines?"
"9717950","9721390"," Because powell said he was going to bring pain Over a year ago. "
"9721490","9725190"," He said he was going to bring pain and guess what happened inflation has come down So now that"
"9725190","9730550"," we've seen this continual evolution of moving away from needing to bring pain Now that we can have"
"9730550","9735610"," a little bit of a sort of open space If they make a transition this week and they remove that"
"9735610","9741550"," restrictive note around it And they really sort of paid way to A cut in March."
"9741910","9743910"," I mean, what's going to stop this market from continuing to go?"
"9743950","9747870"," I've already, you know, look the markets moved a lot because of the perceived pivot that the Fed"
"9747870","9754350"," has already made Jan Hotzius by the way doubling down on his call for a cut in March Five cuts"
"9754350","9760930"," in total march probability is now less than 50 49 but nonetheless the probabilities have been"
"9760930","9766570"," coming down Steadily as the economic data has remained strong and and going in the opposite"
"9766570","9766950"," direction."
"9767350","9769010"," What do you think about this this March idea?"
"9769830","9772610"," I think We are to that. "
"9772930","9776890"," I think you have to watch the treasury market and I think that's what's important right now Okay,"
"9777070","9782150"," the treasury market tenure yield peaked at 419 We're beginning to see treasuries once again 10"
"9782150","9788250"," years beginning to retreat We've got a 410 on a 10 year right now watch for the disinversion That"
"9788250","9791790"," to me is the absolute critical indicator in the market."
"9791790","9796950"," Tell me this trade you made you you're buying really short-dated Calls in the IWM."
"9797210","9804130"," Yes small caps as a play of sorts on what the Fed may do this week Literally insurance. "
"9804450","9808830"," I think bill bill you could relate to it's literally insurance on the portfolio Think back to the"
"9808830","9814010"," december meeting How after that you began to see the broadening out of the rally you saw the rustle"
"9814010","9820870"," 2000 get some some wind behind it significant tailwinds Potentially you could have the same thing"
"9820870","9822470"," occur this week."
"9822850","9830090"," These are short dated options These are options that I will hold through the FOMC meeting Just in"
"9830090","9834750"," case just in case you get that broadening out on something that the federal reserve might indicate"
"9835210","9840930"," Or if you get the disinversion of the yield curve you've got to watch that two to ten spread So"
"9840930","9847090"," these are IWM calls the 198 strike like I said, listen, they're not significant in size They're"
"9847090","9852790"," nothing more than a little portfolio of insurance Guarding against what happened in December and by"
"9852790","9858930"," the way the probability of what I think this will actually occur I am not incredibly confident on"
"9858930","9859050"," it."
"9859150","9863010"," That's why I'm using the option market I agree with you I think the Fed wants to normalize the"
"9863010","9867690"," yield curve and then here's the reality with the 10 year real rates hanging around 2% It was the"
"9867690","9873510"," highest level since 2007 if they want to cause a recession, they will keep real rates up here"
"9873510","9877090"," That's that is the reason why they're going to be cutting rates Well, it only adds to the intrigue"
"9877090","9881050"," of what's going to happen this week Don't forget the jobs report too at the end of the week There's"
"9881050","9885570"," another Goldman story by the way making news today that we're following it's Jim Esposito He's the"
"9885570","9891250"," co-head of investment banking and global markets Is going to be leaving the firm our Leslie Picker"
"9891250","9896410"," is with us today following the money You know, I don't know how much of a surprise this is 56"

"9905930","9910110"," I was just talking to someone about that But yeah, you bring up a good point 56 years in banking"
"9910110","9916330"," is like I don't know 80 years in another profession So it's time My understanding and speaking with"
"9916330","9921950"," people close to him is that it's time to try something new He ran that group Goldman's bread and"
"9921950","9926830"," butter butter with two other co-heads who will continue to manage the unit Which houses investment"

"9940110","9944990"," in leaving It's a signal that he saw the odds of attaining a promotion to be a long shot from"
"9944990","9949790"," here The journal added citing people familiar with the matter that Solomon has indicated to top"
"9949790","9955590"," executives that he's not stepping down Anytime soon so it's bench warming season with the recent"
"9955590","9962710"," moves at JP wargan Morgan Stanley succession very top of mind on Wall Street, but this is I think"
"9962710","9967830"," that's somewhat newsworthy that Solomon has indicated Hey, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon They"
"9967830","9973250"," had a very good fourth quarter, especially relative to the prior quarters You know second and third"
"9973250","9978530"," quarter of last year where there were some special items Pretty significant pivot at that firm."
"9978530","9983570"," There were some negative press Some publicity some concern that maybe he didn't have the full"
"9983570","9989250"," support of the board Ultimately, it appears that that has all kind of at least simmer down for now"
"9989250","9992030"," and he's indicating He's not yeah, not stepping down. "
"9992190","9998250"," No leaving at a time of relative calm right after what was a you know fairly sizable storm around"
"9998250","10003170"," What was happening not only around Solomon, but with the transition away from from some businesses"
"10003170","10009890"," So I think there's the the obvious idea of that's now passed But the inescapable part is looking"

"10028110","10033710"," based on the bench that goldman does have that there are significant talented people should that"

"12678690","12685190"," with growth above potential and the unemployment rate barely budging So why not cut rates right"
"12685190","12685410"," now?"
"12685550","12689750"," We'll stay in the feds and judge by what they've been saying From that immediate cut is concerned"

"12695390","12701070"," with particularly Concern about Wage growth and risk from of course the middle east conflict which"

"12723390","12729070"," around 80 percent at the last meeting You can see that certainly rises to all the way to 99 percent"

"12751830","12758950"," Absolutely true Let's talk a little bit about the global tensions that you mentioned there How does"
"12758950","12764910"," the fed weigh such things as disruptions of shipping in the red sea that could affect oil prices"
"12765750","12773850"," And certainly the price of goods coming to market You know, there's a little bit of just concern"

"12802210","12807370"," talked about this, but the story again is the amount of Domestic production we have in the us that"
"12807370","12812690"," seems to keep a lid on just how far up oil prices can go But the fed's going to watch"
"12812690","12818310"," it and there will be concern about Some of these higher oil prices again feeding into certainly the"

"12971180","12977560"," rate As we see a situation when nominal growth is falling It's clear that interest rates are way"
"12977560","12978200"," too high now. "
"12978380","12983440"," They won't cut obviously this week We've said that already But they have everything in the arsenal"
"12983440","12990260"," to argue why they should cut in a pre-enter fashion because History clearly shows that when you"
"12990260","12995640"," wait too long The impact of monetary policy changes takes time and you get caught behind the curve"
"12996120","13000480"," And I think if the fed doesn't wait too long They they will get the same situation again."
"13000740","13005800"," So what I sense you're saying here is that higher for longer that phrase is sort of the new"
"13006680","13013820"," Transitory that inflation will be brief and and unsustained And the risk here just as it was as it"
"13013820","13019400"," was I think you would probably argue On in the in the period of the transitory phase is that they"
"13019400","13025560"," is that they wait too long to take the appropriate action And in that case They allowed inflation"
"13025560","13030320"," to take hold at a greater level than it otherwise would and in this case It could be to slow"
"13030320","13037320"," the economy past the stall speed I think that's 100 right dollar and and they said that themselves,"
"13037760","13045260"," you know when they we visited monetary policy in 2019 They realized that being preemptive was very"
"13045260","13053120"," important in making sure that the least amount of damage was taking place but We know they don't"
"13053120","13059280"," want to make the same mistake twice the mistake they made in 2021 Was not getting inflation under"

"13060280","13063940"," So it's not a level playing field And they've said that themselves. "
"13064320","13068960"," So I don't think I'm saying anything new They've said that at the margin they would prefer to be"
"13068960","13074840"," too late rather than too early Which I think almost guarantees unfortunately that they will be too"
"13074840","13075060"," late."
"13075340","13082640"," Yeah, let's talk about If they listen to you and they start to cut let's say in march How how"
"13082640","13087260"," many rate cuts would you anticipate this year or do you think they'll be very?"
"13088320","13090880"," Patient and surgical and wait and see what happens."
"13091340","13094080"," How far down do you think rates could fall this year?"

"13103020","13107000"," possibly allow them To be more cautious in terms of cutting rates. "
"13107000","13111920"," Obviously the market has been pushing for rate cuts Well in excess of what the Fed itself would"
"13111920","13117640"," would feel would be wanted And when we look at some of the charts we look at it does suggest"
"13117640","13124380"," levels of yields That are more consistent with an economic downturn Then they are with a soft"
"13124380","13131820"," landing I think the danger is that because we took rates probably a little bit too high and because"
"13131820","13137520"," we have held them up there And if you look at the feedback loop inflation is low But high rates"
"13137520","13143440"," have a lot of negative impacts on the Fed on its balance sheet on regional banks on the treasury in"

"13156640","13162580"," they start in march, let's go back to 2001 the first five cuts were 50 basis points each And we"
"13162580","13168000"," didn't even have a really deep recession then So I think the danger is that already we should be"
"13168000","13173400"," cutting and it will actually force them to do more But it's going to be very much on the basis"
"13173400","13179540"," of whether or not this idea of a soft landing is true I personally think that we're in danger of"
"13179540","13185100"," having something a little bit less optimistic than a soft landing In which case let's not forget as"
"13185100","13185760"," on the way up."
"13185920","13191180"," We shouldn't look at a number of rate cuts always presuming they will be 25 Yeah, if things do"
"13191180","13197480"," deteriorate, we can get there a lot quicker With 50 basis point cards without having to see the six"

"16249710","16251370"," Well, Tyler, it's nice to see you."
"16251490","16256370"," I think eventually you are going to see earnings growth But I think for the time being People have"

"16276670","16282550"," we don't have visibility too much visibility beyond Two quarters out or so, but for the time being"
"16282550","16287690"," we think people should be positioning for this ongoing earnings acceleration And the companies that"

"16292670","16298530"," in companies that are least priced to benefit from that acceleration in other words The market"

"16301610","16302590"," Where do you find them?"
"16303230","16307630"," That's right, tyler I mean, I think there's two areas of the market where you're really not being"

"16313110","16317210"," know corporate spreads within corporate the corporate bond market And then within the equity"

"16344510","16349430"," things that a lot of investors and traders are looking towards is this Idea that there might be a"
"16349430","16349750"," recession. "
"16350050","16351370"," We've been looking for one for a while."
"16351590","16361290"," It just hasn't come Are you looking at things like bond spreads credit"
"16361290","16361710"," quality?"
"16362270","16365610"," Are there any warning signs there or is it all clear for the time being?"
"16366730","16368770"," Yeah, i think it's a really good question."
"16368890","16372750"," I think it depends on your time rising clearly, you know economists have been calling for a"
"16372750","16378610"," recession for Over a year down the recession that never came And so all the signals that they were"
"16378610","16382450"," seeing back then that would put us into a recession Some of those are still with us right?"
"16382630","16388029"," We have the inverted yield curve that now looks like it might Uh move back into positive territory. "
"16388730","16394369"," We have uh, you know areas of delinquencies picking up You know, you have some of these signals you"
"16394369","16398930"," have the ISM which has been quite weak But I think that the reality is if you look at the"
"16398930","16405270"," levels of the data Most of those areas of data are showing improvement and resiliency So not to say"
"16405270","16409790"," that you're not going to get a recession and again if we're talking back half the next this year or"
"16409790","16414430"," into next year I think that visibility is a bit murky But everything that we look at suggests that"
"16414430","16420730"," there's no recession imminent anytime soon Mike Santoli, you know, Dan makes a very interesting"
"16420730","16425950"," point here is and that is that there are sectors of the market Uh that are going to have good"
"16425950","16430770"," earnings growth, but have not been rewarded for that That that their valuations are not are not the"
"16430770","16436230"," same as the mega gap text But but those but momentum is sometimes mike a hard thing to break and"
"16436230","16441930"," the momentum seems to be with Frankly a lot of those big cap textdocs and not with emerging markets"
"16441930","16445029"," for example, something that dan mentioned No, that's exactly true."
"16445330","16450990"," Uh, Tyler and also you have this situation where those big cap textdocs are also providing a huge"
"16450990","16455450"," percentage of the expected earnings growth So it isn't such a case where they're purely defensive"
"16455450","16459529"," and meaning that they're they're slow growth and they're not going to hurt you on the downside They"
"16459529","16463490"," have both going for them right now, but to dan's point There are other parts of the market that"
"16463490","16468290"," aren't really giving given a lot of credit for any cyclical Up turn, maybe we're going to remain"
"16468290","16473050"," kind of in this late cycle mode of just waiting and waiting and waiting for the economy To soften"
"16473050","16477710"," up enough for us to say that a recession might be imminent I always think takes multiple things to"
"16477710","16481810"," go wrong to actually get an outright recession You have to keep watching private sector payrolls"
"16481810","16486290"," They're kind of decelerating pretty quickly and all the rest of it But in the meantime the market"
"16486290","16491310"," seems like um, it's not really willing to make that leap to say that we're out of the woods So"
"16491310","16496730"," if you think we are then those cyclical stocks look like they might be cheaper What about this idea"
"16496730","16504050"," that inflation is still front of mind and that much of the run up that we saw Late last year"
"16504050","16508550"," was tied to this idea that interest rates could be headed lower and that central bank policy could"
"16508550","16514930"," change How much of that then is the driving force behind anything else we see in the market rally"
"16514930","16520029"," that is hypothetically to come Or is it all going to be fundamentally driven and earning season is"
"16520029","16520529"," going to be key?"
"16521070","16523110"," Oh, no, I'm that's part of the backdrop down."
"16523230","16528349"," No doubt about it The idea that financial conditions have loosened and may loosen further still"
"16528349","16532630"," Whether that means the fed's going to cut as much as the fed funds futures imply right now I don't"
"16532630","16537630"," think that's the point the point is yields are off their highs significantly The fed is probably"
"16537630","16544669"," going to make its next move lower at whatever pace makes sense and inflation is at this point Has"
"16544669","16549310"," some downward momentum that I think the market has feasted off of so, you know In the last two"
"16549310","16553770"," months of last year that meant in everything rally all stocks went up this year It's been much more"
"16553770","16555869"," about that narrow group of acknowledge leaders. "

"16608029","16612930"," at a two here two your yields have dropped down The notion of fed easy to look at a 10"
"16612930","16620050"," year much stubborn more stubborn being a little less Res more resistant to the notion of what rates"

"16673910","16678250"," Inflation, do you think they need to wait till it actually gets to a 2 percent level?"
"16678590","16683430"," Well, I think the market is anticipating, you know five to seven cuts while the fed has said We're"
"16683430","16688529"," only going to have three so it is this push and pull and Overall, I think they're going to wait"

"18079890","18083970"," at the moment We feel comfortable buying shares here because we see a lot of upside to numbers"
"18083970","18091550"," ahead And it's really driven by traffic And so the company's traffic growth has been up 7% in the"
"18091550","18097110"," last month or so And if you look at across retail Many retailers are seeing traffic up."
"18097410","18102230"," Maybe it's low single digits Some are up mid single digits and some are even negative And so I"
"18102230","18108330"," think this is really a function of Member growth and the membership is now at 72 million with"
"18108330","18115410"," strong renewal rates That are at now at all time highs 93% And so the one liner here is"
"18115410","18120810"," really simple More people are going to casca more often and they're continually renewing at higher"
"18120810","18123250"," rates Which should drive upside to numbers ahead."
"18123510","18124250"," Hey Cori. "
"18124610","18127970"," What exactly is driving the upside in membership?"
"18128710","18133370"," What are they doing differently either from a marketing perspective or from a product offering"
"18133370","18139890"," perspective that is getting more people to want to sign on For casca memberships So let's say it's"
"18139890","18146270"," two things The first is the ongoing focus on value that casca always tends to drive so their prices"
"18146270","18155150"," are Among the best they have about 3100 units Or different items in their store And often for those"
"18155150","18159970"," items people know that they can get the best value for the price that they're paying And so that"
"18159970","18168410"," value offering that casca has tends to Drive a lot of continued visits and stickiness among a lot"
"18168410","18173590"," of the what the consumers want and having Food which is about 60 percent of the business and"
"18173590","18179410"," general merchandise another 40 percent of the business Um, it is very key to driving that balance"
"18179410","18184110"," So people go there for things they need and then they also have the other side of the box Which"
"18184110","18189250"," is the things that they want at very good values The second component to this is auto renewals and"
"18189250","18195270"," auto renewals as people sign up for a membership It can automatically renews Your every year so you"
"18195270","18200190"," get a natural accretion as more new and new members sign up Yeah, I think I think that's a big"
"18200190","18207450"," thing I was going to mention that because I'm I belong there, but once you're in Inertia takes over"
"18207450","18212430"," and you're likely to stay in Particularly if they automatically renew and the in the charge hits"
"18212430","18217110"," your credit card or whatever it is But but it's very big how big are they because I honestly don't"
"18217110","18222550"," know Cory How big is Costco overseas outside of the US and is that an opportunity for them?"
"18223930","18226010"," It's a very significant opportunity over time."
"18226250","18231410"," So the business has about 800 clubs 600 of those are domestically focused and we spent a lot of"
"18231410","18236610"," time in my meeting with the CFO talking about the domestic opportunity because Frankly most of the"
"18236610","18241690"," new openings of the 30 or so openings that they're going to be doing this year Are going to be"
"18241690","18247010"," focused on domestic infill opportunities Because the demand at some of these units that it has is"
"18247010","18253070"," just so strong and they need to build new units To be able to alleviate some of the pressure on"
"18253070","18258390"," the existing units that are High level on the international side of the business."
"18258690","18263910"," That's the other 200 units that they have are performing more broadly very well And we've seen some"
"18263910","18274510"," promising Data points out of geographies like China Mexico and the UK as well as Spain so And"
"18274510","18279810"," there's also Benefit edge stops like the higher margin as in some of these regions do because from"
"18279810","18285370"," five make a cap lower this week or cost A more like like Tyler I to a mela's Costco just"
"18285370","18292650"," our customer The one thing that they've done Notice over the last several months is well, they'd no"
"18292650","18299550"," longer just check my ID at the door They also check it when I'm checking out as well and that's"
"18299550","18307830"," my picture It's the password sharing And they do all of these things Is this going to move the"
"18307830","18312290"," needle for Costco this idea that they want everybody to get their own independent membership And"
"18312290","18318940"," they can't just share it with other people So it's interesting that you bring that up dom because"
"18319420","18325920"," When I visited the warehouse that is nearby the corporate campus I actually got a first look at one"
"18325920","18333420"," of the new pilots that the company is running and this is a Member scanning technology that as as"
"18333420","18341120"," the where you at that the door where you walk in It's basically like signing into a concert using a"
"18341120","18347540"," key at a concert or ticket at a concert to sign in and Basically get checked at the door. "
"18347860","18352560"," So it'll hopefully alleviate Some of that potential friction at checkout bringing that out front"

"19927040","19932640"," to be somewhere around I think it was 225 Then for the next year which is now this year We're"

"19936720","19940740"," and obviously the market headed terrific year last year largely on the back evaluation expansion"

"20580400","20588760"," respect to the the narrowness of the rally you've got names as diverse as sigma chipotle uber Eaton"

"20708560","20711420"," let's take the valuation because you you made the argument. "
"20711660","20717260"," I think I heard you correctly suggest that they're not expensive Microsoft let's just say it's 10"
"20717260","20719120"," year historical average is something like 23."
"20719440","20728460"," It's at 33 so How do you justify that even with the Excitement around AI right excitement can get"
"20728460","20734120"," out of hand as well from evaluations standpoint We've learned throughout history the hard way when"
"20734120","20740260"," that happens Unfortunately, it's hard to see the signs as it's building Yeah, and and Scott it's"
"20740260","20742900"," not to say that they're inexpensive or cheap."
"20743300","20748340"," They are crowded and expensive i'll go back to what I said before and they are in momentum to the"

"20754700","20762560"," In AI there's so much buzz around it add in the cap weighted passive flows And then go deeper. "
"20762760","20762900"," Okay."
"20763100","20765600"," Can I substantiate being a buyer of Microsoft?"

"20771400","20775580"," and can create some justification behind Yes is expensive."
"20775940","20781800"," Yes, it's a little bit crowded And what they are bringing to the marketplace today Has the highest"
"20781800","20788260"," likelihoods to continue growth at least looking forward to 2020 So you think earnings are going to"
"20788260","20794680"," ultimately justify this move that you do believe in the january the so-called january effect As"
"20794680","20801080"," goes january often so goes Yeah, I mean listen when you dig in the day today, it certainly works"
"20801080","20805120"," There's no down about that Well, it's the first five days and then there's january's a whole"

"20813760","20819580"," anything similar to that in terms of its corner court seasonality So yeah, I think Up january is"
"20819580","20823920"," better than a down january for sure, but to the point about Microsoft and the valuation i'm making"
"20823920","20830100"," no Argument one way or the other for the stock, but like they are what is the open AI investment"

"20871900","20876080"," some Respect entirely fair and we're gonna probably hear about that on a bunch of the calls But I"
"20876080","20881160"," will say it's historically with a lot of these names When you're trading at 20 or now 30 35 times"
"20881160","20885580"," or the assumption is that earnings are not correct and that ultimately over the next three years"
