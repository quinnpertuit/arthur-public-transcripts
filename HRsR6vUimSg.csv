"HRsR6vUimSg","109000","118000"," We have a full plane forming above here on spy so upside expectations today with the confirmation down here in the five minute trigger."
"HRsR6vUimSg","119000","128000"," We are now looking for upside target number two, which is 437 51."
"HRsR6vUimSg","128000","134000"," 435 93."
"HRsR6vUimSg","134000","137000"," Right there."
"HRsR6vUimSg","137000","141000"," That's PT one already hit it."
"HRsR6vUimSg","141000","145000"," That's PT one right there PT two."
"HRsR6vUimSg","145000","151000"," For today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","151000","168000"," 437 44."
"HRsR6vUimSg","168000","178000"," Or hit PT one."
"HRsR6vUimSg","178000","185000"," Or 45 16."
"HRsR6vUimSg","185000","191000"," Move this over next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","191000","195000"," PT three."
"HRsR6vUimSg","195000","201000"," 45.16."
"HRsR6vUimSg","201000","209000"," Right there. This is for today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","209000","212000"," Get rid of that stuff right there."
"HRsR6vUimSg","212000","216000"," I'm going to draw this in for you PT one."
"HRsR6vUimSg","216000","219000"," Come on now."
"HRsR6vUimSg","219000","223000"," That's PT one right there PT one PT two."
"HRsR6vUimSg","223000","231000"," Right there."
"HRsR6vUimSg","231000","234000"," That'd be my expectation for today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","234000","240000"," It changes to like some smaller."
"HRsR6vUimSg","240000","255000"," Make this smaller here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","255000","276000"," Okay, so two minutes, two minute preview into the close today expecting an upper range target of 445 16 of the bell."
"HRsR6vUimSg","276000","281000"," Look out for rejection today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","281000","289000"," Above at 437 44."
"HRsR6vUimSg","289000","292000"," Keep that target in mind above here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","292000","297000"," If we begin to squeeze above 437 44, you're going to want to see it hold."
"HRsR6vUimSg","297000","301000"," So the initial target here for today is going to be 437 44."
"HRsR6vUimSg","301000","304000"," You want to break above it to 438 60."
"HRsR6vUimSg","304000","309000"," Hold 437 44 and then begin to try to trade 439 83."
"HRsR6vUimSg","310000","315000"," And then ultimately a squeeze higher than a 445 16 do I think you get the 445 16."
"HRsR6vUimSg","315000","316000"," I doubt it."
"HRsR6vUimSg","316000","318000"," I really do. I think that it's down here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","318000","323000"," I think your ultimate end of the goal is 439 83 into next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","323000","327000"," Expectation is that we trade higher into next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","327000","331000"," We're going to trade 445 50."
"HRsR6vUimSg","331000","336000"," Into next week and then the I'm going to look for the bears to take over."
"HRsR6vUimSg","336000","338000"," So whether it's something like this."
"HRsR6vUimSg","338000","347000"," Roll back down settle on the early trigger and then begin to trade this 445 98 443 somewhere in here next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","347000","357000"," I'm going to look for the bears to take over once again next week into end of the month and begin to trade this down into Friday."
"HRsR6vUimSg","357000","362000"," To that 428 price target for next Friday."
"HRsR6vUimSg","362000","367000"," One thing I would say is if you're theta gang right where we are right now for next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","367000","370000"," So for theta gang right where we are next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","370000","372000"," This is kind of your place in here right."
"HRsR6vUimSg","372000","375000"," So you set up your flies for next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","375000","378000"," If you think, hey, we're going to consolidate and trade sideways in the next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","378000","389000"," I do a big fat fly with 459 451 somewhere up in there probably 450 452 to 459 on the upside."
"HRsR6vUimSg","389000","395000"," And then the downside legs would be 428 below 428 426 something like that."
"HRsR6vUimSg","395000","400000"," For that sideways consolidation trade in the S&P 500."
"HRsR6vUimSg","400000","406000"," You're kind of in the perfect sweet spot right now right for this sideways trade for theta gang into next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","406000","412000"," Not going to expect too much of a move higher and I'm not going to expect too much of a move lower into next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","412000","414000"," Then this 428 down below."
"HRsR6vUimSg","414000","417000"," What's my thesis here for bears in the next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","417000","419000"," If you want to bear thesis."
"HRsR6vUimSg","419000","423000"," You need to get underneath for 28 today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","423000","426000"," You need to get underneath 425 426."
"HRsR6vUimSg","426000","430000"," But next week you want to begin to trade underneath."
"HRsR6vUimSg","430000","433000"," Let's see you get up there to that 445 sell this down."
"HRsR6vUimSg","433000","439000"," Get underneath that 428 and that's your next leg down to 420."
"HRsR6vUimSg","439000","449000"," Ultimate price target into end of quarter for bears is going to be that 420 420 is the target for bears for the end of quarter."
"HRsR6vUimSg","449000","453000"," So we've got almost that we got what another week to left and you got another month."
"HRsR6vUimSg","453000","458000"," So six weeks from now 420 would be the target for bears."
"HRsR6vUimSg","458000","467000"," Bulls must get above this 443 445 next week."
"HRsR6vUimSg","467000","470000"," You must get the hourly trigger to come up and meet you."
"HRsR6vUimSg","470000","473000"," It's not good enough that you squeeze up here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","473000","483000"," You need this hourly trigger to come up and give you some support here to go back and go to the scene of the crime to the upside."
"HRsR6vUimSg","483000","485000"," So no bullishness here for me."
"HRsR6vUimSg","485000","493000"," Until we hold above 443 445 on spy no bullishness none."
"HRsR6vUimSg","493000","495000"," I don't care if we trade up here and squeeze up here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","495000","498000"," You got to like hold it and then begin to make your way up."
"HRsR6vUimSg","498000","500000"," I'll get bullish right there."
"HRsR6vUimSg","500000","501000"," Right."
"HRsR6vUimSg","501000","504000"," So you get the initial squeeze above hourly comes up to meet."
"HRsR6vUimSg","504000","510000"," And then I will if you want to resume that trade higher try to close the gap up on high at 459."
"HRsR6vUimSg","510000","513000"," We can do that but not until this happens."
"HRsR6vUimSg","513000","517000"," Bonus not on the bulls right now."
"HRsR6vUimSg","517000","521000"," So in here consolidation you got your consolidation numbers Binky."
"HRsR6vUimSg","521000","524000"," You've got what you need to be under to start to trade 420."
"HRsR6vUimSg","524000","528000"," And what my expectations are for next week for the rest of today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","528000","536000"," Rest of today and the beginning of Monday would be into like Tuesday or something to try to trade that 445 and try to hold it."
"HRsR6vUimSg","536000","539000"," Bulls have to do that the next three sessions."
"HRsR6vUimSg","539000","542000"," Friday Monday and Tuesday."
"HRsR6vUimSg","542000","548000"," If you're a seller you know right now where that number is 443 by Monday."
"HRsR6vUimSg","548000","558000"," Right in here by Monday it's going to be this is likely going to come down a little bit and meet up with the meet up with bulls at like 442 443 by Monday afternoon."
"HRsR6vUimSg","558000","560000"," So I might even drop this down right now."
"HRsR6vUimSg","560000","562000"," So right down here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","562000","565000"," This is going to actually be right here on Monday."
"HRsR6vUimSg","565000","568000"," Rejection trade just waiting."
"HRsR6vUimSg","568000","571000"," Just waiting for bulls come Monday up here."
"HRsR6vUimSg","571000","574000"," They're going to be waiting up here for it."
"HRsR6vUimSg","574000","576000"," So let's see where this goes for us today."
"HRsR6vUimSg","576000","578000"," You guys got any other questions for me."
"HRsR6vUimSg","578000","580000"," I think that's pretty pretty good."
