"34430","35590"," My check 1T."
"82460","84300"," Alright, good morning out there."
"88340","90280"," Got a couple of things I got to do here. "
"90280","94560"," A few things for you to be watching though this morning on the open here."
"94780","104560"," Of course, take a look at that red bar on book map here in the center of your screen."
"104740","111020"," And then another key love will be looking at below here is the gamma flip on SPX. "
"111020","120940"," You can see this down here where my cursor is just right here where this yellow arrow is down here."
"121040","121840"," This is the gamma flip."
"122100","125120"," We did SPX open below the gamma flip this morning. "
"128039","131900"," So we are in negative gamma territory."
"132580","134460"," We've got S3 down below it."
"135280","136180"," 46968. "
"136640","139540"," The daily trigger on the top"
"139540","155060"," of"
"155060","155080"," the air."
"174050","175510"," You can get all that for you here."
"180150","182530"," You can get all this up on the screen for you here. "
"183770","185530"," Your hourly trigger is up high."
"185770","186610"," There you can see that."
"192480","195100"," Also down below in your screen here you see the cues. "
"195560","197480"," You'll see your daily trigger down below in the cues."
"197680","199360"," It's 39841."
"200600","204820"," You do know a couple notes here you may or may not know would be. "
"206220","215180"," We stay on trend as long as price remains above the daily trigger on SKUs and"
"215180","216640"," SPY."
"217460","226320"," So this down that we have today, if we stay on trend you should see price stay above the daily"
"226320","226620"," trigger."
"226620","231880"," You should see even if we break through a bounce and recovery on the daily trigger. "
"232720","237300"," If we begin to reject underneath the daily trigger we would be breaking trend."
"237740","241320"," That's important for you to an awareness for you to have this morning."
"242300","252160"," Now the expectation for the start to this year would be sideways and slightly up"
"252160","256000"," for cues and SPY, SPX. "
"256000","263160"," But not major trend to the upside and then an eventual roll down into mid March."
"263960","272120"," IWM in small caps should get bought an out-piece perform from now into March."
"272420","276940"," Now I think I heard I was watching CNBC yesterday or something. "
"276940","283400"," And they were talking about the doom gloom for small caps but the reality is with that out"
"283400","290480"," performance from small caps you should see big huge squeezes up and then giant pullbacks as that"
"290480","291440"," happens."
"291760","298780"," So if you're a small cap person or if you're wondering how will small caps continue to outperform"
"298780","301740"," even though it was down into the end of the year it should."
"302520","304260"," So keep an eye on that. "
"304740","311560"," The last note for you this morning would be the last note for you this morning would be about the"
"311560","314040"," expectations for this year."
"314640","316980"," I did write an extensive report."
"317640","319120"," It's almost done. "
"319440","320680"," I had a few more things."
"320900","325800"," They got some small technical things I want to clean up just so it's a nice clean report for you."
"325800","332640"," That report will be released today in the Discord today. "
"332820","341780"," So you'll be on the website with a link back from the Discord so that you can have access to"
"341780","342080"," that report."
"342080","345100"," I went in depth into what to expect this year."
"345100","353340"," I know that a lot of you out there are investors and wants to know when to invest when to"
"353340","356560"," look to invest if you can't invest this year or not. "
"356780","362860"," I know that some of you are not just day traders and you're looking for those key moments in the"
"362860","366880"," market so that you can you can come out on top for the year."
"367120","371240"," So that will be available at some point I believe this afternoon or this morning it should be out"
"371240","374300"," and available for you this morning."
"374300","376840"," I just got a few more things want to make sure it's absolutely right. "
"378280","382500"," And then I got some had some how about like a bunch of dates and stuff that I had to"
"382500","382920"," look at."
"383420","390900"," I did post a preliminary year chart on Twitter over the weekend."
"391240","397680"," That should have been a nice tease for you and want to what to expect for this upcoming year. "
"397680","399300"," Happy New Year to all of you out there by the way."
"399880","405200"," I'm still on some form of vacation until Friday my children are off from school."
"406580","411780"," Until the sixth or something whatever this Friday is is they're done with their schooling so you'll"
"411780","413420"," see me back at an action again. "
"413960","418120"," The moment they're back from the moment they're back into their schooling and I got a bunch of"
"418120","419740"," other crap I'm doing for this end of year."
"419740","426760"," Like dogs, end of year shots, kids with dentist appointments, kids with medical appointments you"
"426760","428060"," name it it's all just rolling in."
"428280","433280"," So you'll get the report later today the streams will be up all week long at least for you to"
"433280","435440"," be here and talk amongst each other. "
"436060","441160"," What else is going on you guys?"
"441160","445000"," We had our final meeting with our general counsel."
"445880","452460"," We have offers being sent out currently to anyone that's been involved in this project so that we"
"452460","453400"," can launch the website."
"453920","460560"," I heard some talk about the membership levels on the website some complaints. "
"461200","465740"," They shouldn't have been public I don't know why they were listed public but that is not the final"
"465740","467000"," form of what we're doing."
"468180","471820"," On public on our website is not the final form of what we're doing."
"471820","478040"," I had a few hours here if you're wondering or questioning that kind of stuff you have any what's"
"478040","480320"," going on with what the house going on background kind of stuff. "
"480680","488180"," I would just be patient here and we will be launching we did who were successful in doing an embed"
"488180","488940"," for the website."
"488940","494140"," So it's just a matter of getting the final final details done on that stuff."
"494640","499180"," Those guys seem to be coming across as saying yes we are going to get it done. "
"499600","504360"," We had a meeting where we looked at that stuff over the week or last week while I was not"
"504360","505200"," streaming last week."
"505580","512299"," I was in meetings all day long I was down in offices with teleconferences all day long that kind of"
"512299","514860"," stuff just trying to prove that everything that we're doing is correct."
"515380","517260"," So we're making good progress there. "
"518740","523640"," What else I might have some I've got some other cool stuff you'll get some cool stuff coming for"
"523640","523980"," the new year."
"524200","529680"," So just stick with us be patient and again keep your eyes down below here."
"529860","535260"," This is the cues 398 41 is the expected target on cues. "
"535660","543120"," If you're wondering if we're rolling over the truth here is you should see a slow gentle role and"
"543120","546980"," acceleration down into mid March of the market."
"547860","553880"," You should also see good we should have some good days right trade sideways and that kind of stuff"
"553880","555260"," big rotation going on."
"555980","559840"," And you're going to be looking for a dip by in that mid March area. "
"562180","564740"," But I would go doom and gloom at this point."
"565620","567760"," You're still on trend right now."
"567820","571340"," Remember spy cues are still on trend. "
"572480","576380"," So as long as price stays above you're going to be chasing that price."
"576600","579540"," You get if you catch a bounce down here at 390 41 on cues."
"580760","583200"," Nothing has changed for the bulls. "
"583400","593080"," The bears must get the hourly trigger and price with a rejection underneath the daily trigger"
"593080","596960"," on both spoons and on cues for all that doom and gloom."
"596960","601240"," Now if you're going to ask me what I think about that kind of stuff like how high we can"
"601240","602200"," go all that kind of stuff."
"602760","604220"," Bull's still in charge here. "
"604600","609640"," There's no reason not to think that the market's not going to continue to trade sideways and up."
"609880","616240"," And that you don't get that put that roll down until we get closer to that mid March time period."
"616240","617900"," Today is January 2nd. "
"618160","620900"," It's not March 15th anything like that."
"620900","626360"," So be cool and take a what do I want you to remember one other thing."
"626800","629120"," Most people are still off on vacation. "
"629920","637160"," I realize that some of you that are new retail traders think that this is you know January 2nd."
"637280","640300"," Let's get it on the the years started."
"640920","648380"," But the truth is that most of Wall Street, most market participants are still on vacation until the"
"648380","650320"," after the 6th until after this. "
"650320","651140"," Upcoming Friday."
"651600","653740"," This holiday is stretched out."
"654720","659560"," Most holidays too you'll see the payment when the dates of the year are this year. "
"659700","665580"," The way this year worked itself out with holiday dates and then the calendar dates."
"666300","672180"," The stock market itself is not in normal operating until next Monday."
"672180","673320"," Just be aware of that. "
"676840","678960"," All right now I'll be back with you here shortly."
"679720","681360"," Hey welcome back everybody."
"681360","682620"," Happy New Year everybody. "
"682880","684500"," How are y'all doing y'all have a good year."
"684920","685580"," Hope y'all did."
"686660","689640"," And the other thing too here would be we're starting Q1. "
"690780","692320"," Remember something else right."
"692540","693460"," So we're in Q1."
"694220","698160"," You're going to get you're going to get positioning for this quarter. "
"698660","700480"," That normally takes about a week."
"700700","700860"," Okay."
"701080","704380"," So normally the first week in the quarter is a quarter that you sit on your hands. "
"704480","705000"," You don't do shit."
"705580","708340"," And you wait and see what the where the markets going ahead."
"708340","711880"," We'll talk about all that stuff as as the week progresses. "
"718850","731530"," Ten seconds zero spot"
"731530","735910"," four percent zero spot four percent lower than forecast zero spot five percent."
"746540","749840"," Gorgeous little bounce down there right on that on that."
"750620","752300"," Hold on saying I'm losing my microphone. "
"753220","754860"," Nice little bounce down there."
"755240","759100"," Gorgeous on that little gorgeous orange bar there."
"766330","768870"," Keep your eyes on that gamma flip down here. "
"769010","770190"," So this red line right here."
"770290","774730"," This is the gamma flip for SPX right on this bounce here."
"774850","776770"," You don't want to see rejection to head back down. "
"776870","780090"," You want to see the recovery on the gamma line."
"780930","785310"," That gamma line is a four two or seven five zero."
"785650","787870"," So on SPX at home. "
"788570","795550"," Keep your eyes on that four seven five or seven five zero and SPX."
"796150","799150"," Keep your eyes on that one right there."
"799350","804050"," You want to see that recovery right there or trend to continue for the bowl. "
"804050","807450"," The construction spending reports on the fade for anybody interested."
"808210","815990"," Of one percent but in the rear view mirror a significant revision from up six tens to up one point"
"815990","816430"," two."
"816770","822830"," We see that interest rates are up for the first session and we want to pay particularly close"
"822830","823870"," attention to the notion. "
"824530","826490"," Let's also talk about one more thing."
"826650","827930"," Okay, we're going to have a little chat here."
"830890","832650"," If you are a bull. "
"833670","837410"," You do not want to see rates cuts."
"837950","839470"," I assure you that's number one."
"840070","841650"," You do not want to see them. "
"842550","848250"," Number two, there is so we are in a soft landing in my in my estimation."
"848250","849850"," We are in a soft landing."
"850510","853670"," You may you've been you've been in this report. "
"853670","855850"," You're going to get from me on this this report."
"855850","856730"," You're going to get from me."
"856730","857950"," I want you to know a few things. "
"858670","859950"," We are in a soft landing."
"860230","862350"," It began on July 26th."
"862810","864990"," We're about five months into that. "
"865190","868870"," I think it's five months something like that right into that soft landing."
"869270","874410"," Those soft landings last anywhere from one year to five years."
"876350","881110"," There's some other key points here that I have not seen discussed publicly. "
"881110","888770"," And that is that one you're in the soft landing for one to five years."
"889550","896870"," Two inside of that soft between between the soft landing and the next period."
"897710","903690"," There's always a recessionary period that follows historically any soft landing. "
"903890","907210"," So we have three on record right three soft landings."
"907210","912350"," They're always followed by a recessionary period this morning."
"912570","915970"," I saw CNBC talking about we're going to get a recession this year. "
"916110","916710"," That kind of stuff."
"917290","921470"," There is something else that no one is addressing and this that's in this report."
"923230","924910"," So inside of that. "
"925170","926930"," So if we have a soft landing."
"927150","927370"," Okay."
"927770","931610"," Actually the actual soft landing lasts about a year. "
"932590","938630"," Now there's a window between soft landings and that forced recessionary period."
"939090","943970"," That's the actual time frame where that can last one to five years."
"944730","950390"," And it is all predicated upon whether the fed cuts rates or not. "
"951250","957750"," And the true soft landing should last about a year anyway or about a year and it's in and of"
"957750","958110"," itself."
"958890","967010"," So you should expect that this soft landing should last for at least the rest of the first six"
"967010","968750"," months of 2024."
"970830","978370"," What happens here is that the fed becomes even more in control of where the market goes. "
"979410","984110"," In that in between period I call it the window and I'm going to show you."
"984110","986230"," Exact from date to date."
"987390","991570"," That's window where the fed is in super control. "
"991810","993870"," It's like a super control of the market period."
"994230","999630"," Unless we have an in an unknown event outside of an unknown event."
"1000050","1005670"," If the fed holds rates and could even possibly continue to raise rates. "
"1006210","1011530"," They could create a super bull run that last five six seven years."
"1012350","1016830"," We could last one year does not matter it matters when they cut rates."
"1018050","1023450"," The unemployment rate will matter as well of course the inflation will tie into that jobs"
"1023450","1024990"," unemployment that kind of stuff. "
"1025650","1029650"," But they can fudge those numbers as well while they're holding rates higher."
"1030410","1034010"," So I'm going to show you guys all the interplay in that and how that works out."
"1035010","1041030"," And how long this period should last but you likely have no less than. "
"1041569","1046950"," A year period sometime into the end of 2024."
"1048190","1051810"," Or at least historically based on historical examples."
"1052430","1057110"," It should last at least in 10 of year if not March of next year. "
"1057910","1061070"," You're going to want to pay very close attention to."
"1061070","1064930"," Three specific things or three or four specific things."
"1064930","1066850"," The first one would be of course rates. "
"1067590","1070610"," Unemployment rates in the rate of inflation."
"1071950","1074410"," And some jobs numbers and stuff like that."
"1074950","1076090"," The yield curve. "
"1076570","1079430"," We're going to talk about that inside of that report as well."
"1079810","1085030"," It is one of the least reliable indicators for."
"1085370","1088090"," Hey, we're going to start a recession like this spring this summer. "
"1088090","1094170"," The fed can invert and uninvert that and that yield curve inversion as many times as they want."
"1095010","1097310"," They can manipulate that yield curve."
"1097510","1101050"," They can pause that yield curve believe it or not through not cutting rates. "
"1101870","1103350"," And then fudging numbers."
"1103970","1106310"," And matter of fact last week."
"1107050","1110410"," I was listening to a famous hedge fund. "
"1110930","1115150"," A person that said that she is a very close friend of hers."
"1116000","1119310"," That their job at the fed was to fudge those numbers."
"1119410","1121710"," You saw the fudging of those numbers last quarter. "
"1122390","1123550"," And that can continue."
"1124210","1126570"," And then I was asked over the weekend about."
"1127230","1131690"," All the bets on rates being cut next year. "
"1131910","1133450"," There's another key point here for you."
"1133810","1134270"," That."
"1136090","1137690"," It does not matter. "
"1138370","1141930"," If banks are lowering their mortgage rates."
"1143070","1146770"," They can do what they want regardless of what the fed is doing."
"1147410","1151150"," Okay, so that's not an indicator of the fed cutting rates number two. "
"1152070","1156970"," Market participants like the bond market betting that we're going to have four rate cuts in 2024."
"1157810","1159330"," It's it's garbage science."
"1159670","1160710"," It's all it is is gambling. "
"1161070","1162010"," That's all it is."
"1162230","1163230"," That's all it ever was."
"1163410","1164370"," All it'll ever be. "
"1164890","1168570"," So be wary of that as well when you're making your predictions."
"1169250","1172670"," As to what's going to come or happen in 2024."
"1173510","1177950"," With rake that matter of fact this morning you saw that rates higher was. "
"1178770","1181330"," The mantra for CNBC this morning."
"1181490","1184110"," So you should put all that stuff on the."
"1184390","1187370"," Or put your blinders on when it comes to all that. "
"1187990","1194750"," I don't know Dick swinging that goes on the bond market or in CNBC or in public."
"1194750","1199690"," Or even what mortgage companies are saying is going to happen so and trust in."
"1200690","1202170"," Seasonality trust in. "
"1204510","1207470"," Prior examples that kind of stuff to guide you."
"1207910","1209350"," In what to expect."
"1210630","1214470"," And traditionally what happens right if we have a presidential election year. "
"1215010","1217030"," That kind of stuff those things really do."
"1218250","1221630"," Repeat and play themselves out repetitively."
"1222470","1226430"," Over time even if we have large outside swings one way or another they tend to we tend to come"
"1226430","1227050"," back to the. "
"1227310","1229210"," To the norm at some point so."
"1229710","1235150"," Those those things have really worked well for most investors and traders out there."
"1235810","1240370"," Over over time as time smooths out those things you'll see that. "
"1240770","1243750"," Market still operates in a pretty predictive way."
"1246210","1249530"," So I'll be back with you and I got some other stuff I got to do here."
"1250030","1251490"," And I will talk to you guys soon. "
"1251690","1253110"," Happy New Year to all the guys out there."
"1259130","1262910"," We could come into every year for the past I don't know how many 10 and say."
"1263590","1267390"," It's going to be value stocks this year and then as the year ends we're all like up should own"
"1267390","1267750"," the growth. "
"1268910","1276890"," Well I mean 2022 was fantastic for a value and then it just totally got reversed in 2023 and you"
"1276890","1277050"," know."
"1277930","1280250"," Everything was you know was zero so."
"1281130","1286470"," You know we're in that alternating fashion but I think you know the ratios here. "
"1286890","1288870"," I saw you career low I know man."
"1296170","1297090"," Thousand nothing crazy."
"1301200","1305420"," I don't think a lot long term certainly not to the levels that we had. "
"1305980","1310620"," You know pre pandemic that's so boosted those those stocks during that period."
"1310620","1316960"," Yeah of course a recession as well as what happens with monetary policy a big indicator."
"1316960","1319320"," I read that writing in a note this morning. "
"1319520","1325320"," Every princess cake as convinced about a soft landing today as it was convinced of a recession in"
"1325320","1325760"," 2022."
"1326760","1332480"," Where are you on that camp and you think that that conviction is more accurate this year than"
"1332480","1334780"," perhaps it was a year ago."
"1334780","1337960"," Yeah I mean it's more likely I mean I give it. "
"1338200","1343960"," I give a soft landing you know probably two to one probability but look at."
"1344020","1348520"," You know I want to make a comment here you see these people on CNBC right now they're talking"
"1348520","1348920"," about."
"1349400","1351780"," Still talking about soft landings. "
"1352180","1357740"," These people are out of their fucking minds out of their fucking minds your soft landing already"
"1357740","1358200"," began."
"1358200","1364700"," Your soft landing began way back in the late July of 2023."
"1365640","1370200"," And it was confirmed on our last great decision. "
"1371180","1376600"," So these people are out of their fuck that what these people do right is they're telling they tell"
"1376600","1377700"," you stuff right."
"1378260","1380100"," It's a very important point here okay."
"1381140","1387860"," You'll you'll see like a mantra be said to you like if this happens if that happens if this happens"
"1387860","1388820"," if that happens. "
"1389100","1394940"," And what actually is going on is this it's it's already happened or is already happening."
"1395680","1401940"," And then by the time that they declare something as happening it's all been priced in and you're"
"1401940","1404060"," like behind the gun already."
"1404060","1409240"," So you already got your soft landing it should last for another five or six months. "
"1412760","1417920"," Couple of months ago from Lebanon and that really is the crossroads there that is where we're"
"1417920","1420940"," seeing Hezbollah which like Hamas is backed by Iran."
"1421260","1425780"," Remember the Houthis which have been seizing ships and attacking commercial vessels in the Red Sea"
"1425780","1430640"," they are also a militant group a rebel group in Yemen that are backed by Iran."
"1430640","1434800"," So what we're starting to see now is an expansion of the war to include the entire with the"
"1434800","1437780"," Iranians and their supporters would call the axis of resistance. "
"1437980","1443900"," Those nations and militant groups that are very opposed not just to Israel but also to the United"
"1443900","1447540"," States and Sunni backed moneyed monarchies in the Gulf."
"1447960","1452020"," And so we're starting to see them all acting in concert and that's why this is becoming so much"
"1452020","1452560"," more threatening."
"1452560","1458740"," The United States has now been pushed almost to the point of a direct confrontation with Iran and"
"1458740","1463040"," now that Iran has deployed what looks like a worship into the Red Sea. "
"1463460","1469220"," It looks as though there's we're now closer than ever to a region wide war involving possibly not"
"1469220","1471980"," just Israel and militant groups like Hamas."
"1471980","1479540"," I mean listen to this clown right now this fucking clown out there is talking about a larger scale"
"1479540","1484920"," war right in the Middle East due to Iran deploying a warship."
"1485040","1492780"," Do any of you remember the last time that Iran deployed a warship we literally sunk their entire"
"1492780","1495400"," Navy in about 55 minutes. "
"1496320","1498560"," There's no expansion of war here."
"1499920","1509040"," Iran would be I would be wary if I was Iran deploying any warships to any sea right now."
"1509140","1516420"," If you guys don't know that story there's a famous story of Iran fucking around once years ago and"
"1516420","1523300"," the US basically begged these guys to stop firing missiles stop shooting. "
"1524800","1530060"," Stop sending their gunboats out in the US literally had a I think it was I think the war lot"
"1530060","1534920"," the war with Iran and the naval war we had with Iran lasted I think 55 minutes."
"1535540","1537560"," It was absolutely brutal."
"1538940","1540860"," Let me see if you can find that war for you. "
"1542640","1546660"," Security and political that it's ever seen since it's founding guys."
"1547580","1552900"," Matt thank you for that for that rundown of all of those concerning issues appreciate it."
"1553080","1553920"," Matt Bradley and Tel Aviv. "
"1554940","1558660"," Let's take a quick break here and give you a road map as well for the rest of the hour."
"1558880","1560620"," Tesla is out with this laser delivery numbers."
"1561040","1564580"," It was called Operation Praying Mantis on your own. "
"1564660","1565060"," Look it up."
"1565200","1566100"," It's it's hilarious."
"1568380","1569660"," Yeah, I know. "
"1570400","1571460"," I know burnt out."
"1571600","1572880"," I'm like really."
"1573820","1578720"," Spanding war with Iran like look up a thing called Operation Praying Mantis. "
"1579400","1583920"," These guys those guys couldn't couldn't brew a pot of coffee before that war was over."
"1587460","1590640"," Fighters are predicting we got a lot more squawk in the street straight ahead."
"1747320","1747800"," Five. "
"1749940","1753520"," Welcome back shares of Tesla on the move after fresh delivery numbers there."
"1753700","1755540"," Let's get to fill the bow with the latest table."
"1756880","1759760"," Good morning Leslie and we look at the fourth quarter results for Tesla. "
"1760140","1764080"," These are better than expected in the fourth quarter in terms of production and deliveries."
"1764080","1767180"," Here's what Tesla reported just within the last couple of hours."
"1767800","1772660"," Production of coming in at four hundred and ninety five thousand vehicles essentially and"
"1772660","1772940"," deliveries. "
"1772940","1776760"," This is the one that's getting the most attention four hundred and eighty four thousand five"
"1776760","1777920"," hundred and seven vehicles."
"1778280","1780740"," The street was expecting four hundred and seventy three thousand."
"1780860","1782480"," That was the latest fact set consensus. "
"1783020","1785860"," Most were saying look as long as they hit four hundred and seventy five thousand."
"1786160","1789940"," That's the key number here because if they hit four hundred and seventy five thousand which they"
"1789940","1791200"," did take a look at this."
"1791200","1795980"," Full year deliveries would exceed the company's guidance of one point eight million vehicles. "
"1796000","1801680"," So for the year they come in at just basically just a little shy of one point eight one million"
"1801680","1802100"," vehicles."
"1802520","1805240"," Deliveries increasing thirty percent thirty eight percent."
"1805240","1808460"," I say in twenty twenty twenty two. "
"1808880","1812400"," The question now is at what cost in terms of merchants."
"1812440","1818100"," How much did merchants have to suffer as they dealt with pricing issues both in China and in the US"
"1818100","1819560"," for the fourth quarter."
"1820000","1824960"," As well as all the twenty twenty three will get the financial results from Tesla after the bell"
"1824960","1826180"," three weeks from now. "
"1826400","1831120"," January twenty fourth Wednesday the twenty fourth and that's also when we will hear the company's"
"1831120","1831320"," guidance."
"1831800","1837320"," We expect to hear the company's guidance before your deliveries in twenty twenty four."
"1837720","1841360"," The estimate among analysts right now two point one million though. "
"1841640","1845100"," If you talk with bulls they'll say look we think we can get they can get up to two point"
"1845100","1846620"," two two point three million."
"1846860","1850480"," We'll hear from Elon Musk after the bell on the twenty fourth about that."
"1850760","1851580"," Guys back to you. "
"1851760","1852960"," All right Phil thank you."
"1853060","1855180"," Yeah we've got one of those bulls right right here in fact."
"1855380","1857680"," Let's talk tech stocks for a second of course as our viewers know. "
"1857680","1861640"," Just wrapping up what was one of the best years we've seen over the last two decades."
"1862280","1864200"," And our next guest he was right about the big rally."
"1864600","1866320"," Dan Ives, Weddber Securities Analyst. "
"1867220","1871380"," You're going to I would guess by the end of this year you'll look you'll be atop the leaderboard of"
"1871380","1872740"," CNBC appearances Dan."
"1873860","1876100"," Although I'm willing to take an over under on that."
"1876780","1878360"," And you know what I'm going to love every one of them. "
"1878520","1880700"," So and it's great to be here."
"1880700","1881400"," Good to see you."
"1881680","1886740"," You had a good call on tech overall you continue to be quite bullish. "
"1886740","1887780"," Let's start with Tesla though."
"1887980","1889220"," Just give me your take on those numbers."
"1889380","1891560"," You know Phil just mentioned two point three million. "
"1891960","1895140"," Are you going to be towards the high end in terms of what you expect them to deliver this year?"
"1895240","1897200"," Yeah I think whisper expectations could be higher."
"1897460","1900220"," Look this was this was a strong strong result."
"1900580","1901840"," Look what's happened in China. "
"1902400","1904760"," There were fears there and it was actually a source of strength."
"1904980","1906600"," We think a record quarter in China."
"1906900","1912720"," So I do think this is an important I think sign that demands actually strengthening for Tesla. "
"1912720","1918140"," It continues to be maybe EV demand soft and but not Tesla demand."
"1918380","1919940"," And that's the important thing going to 24."
"1920380","1922400"," Yeah how do you but how where is that line?"
"1922680","1923960"," Why is that the case then?"
"1924080","1927440"," And in particular in China where BYD is such a strong competitor. "
"1927840","1930120"," Are they going to be able to maintain their market share?"
"1930260","1932020"," BYD has done a phenomenal job."
"1932240","1937100"," But I do think if you look in the driver's seat it's Tesla and BYD gained some net share from"
"1937100","1937920"," NIO and others."
"1937920","1943420"," And in China especially the view of the last few quarters there were fears that this price was"
"1943420","1944180"," going to continue. "
"1944320","1945120"," It actually hasn't."
"1945220","1946720"," See now it's a fills point."
"1947120","1948180"," You're seeing price stabilization. "
"1949080","1955240"," That's very important because now the Goldilocks scenario margins up ticking, demand up ticking."
"1955480","1960080"," That's where in our opinion you see a trillion dollar mark out for Tesla over the next year."
"1960560","1962400"," Despite many of the haters continuing to hate. "
"1962600","1967760"," Dan I have to get your take on Apple this morning with Barclays revealing it's downgraded."
"1967760","1969220"," Over cooling iPhone demand."
"1969580","1973780"," Do you agree with the assessment there your channel checks showing the same thing about the demand"
"1973780","1974480"," picture for iPhones?"
"1974760","1978740"," I mean the last 48 hours it hasn't changed from what we've seen over the last month. "
"1979020","1983400"," I mean look I get some of these calls from a valuation perspective and many that have been"
"1983400","1984800"," naysayers over the last year."
"1985340","1989820"," But if I look at iPhone 15 we have not seen number cuts from our checks in Asia."
"1989860","1995360"," And that's important because I think it shows that this upgrade opportunity is actually manifesting"
"1995360","1996180"," for Apple. "
"1996180","1999240"," I actually think the mix is much more pro."
"1999860","2001100"," Specifically pro max in China."
"2001660","2006100"," I think what that ultimately means is that this is going to be an iPhone number that comes in above"
"2006100","2006560"," expectations. "
"2006760","2009880"," But the most important thing in David's talk about a lot services."
"2010520","2014940"," I still think this is going to be teenager type of growth not single digits."
"2014940","2019820"," If that's true and we believe it is based on our checks and this is ultimately a stock that could"
"2019820","2021880"," go 30, 40 percent higher this year. "
"2021880","2027600"," Well you get potentially even a higher multiple again as services becomes an even larger part of"
"2027600","2028300"," overall profit."
"2028980","2034620"," Let's talk broader tech here again our viewers see you often so we know where you stood towards the"
"2034620","2035360"," end of last year."
"2035700","2041500"," This is going to be a big AI moment and it's going to create a bull market overall for how"
"2041500","2043300"," many companies in technology this year. "
"2043300","2049040"," Well yeah and talk about it here is that our new AI checks and me and you've talked on the"
"2049040","2050520"," program a lot about use cases."
"2050620","2052080"," Use cases are exploding."
"2052500","2057639"," I mean the average enterprise right now that we're talking to is seeing 15 to 20 potential use"
"2057639","2058900"," cases within their companies. "
"2059500","2062699"," That's why right now we think it's going to be 8 to 10 percent of budgets."
"2062940","2064199"," And I think that's the important thing."
"2064360","2068139"," You look it's not just the Godfather of AI and Nvidia and Jensen. "
"2068639","2069920"," It's not just what's happened in Redmond."
"2069920","2074100"," I think you're going to see the spread across the board and software and chips which is why we"
"2074100","2077420"," believe tech stocks will be up 25 percent this year."
"2077840","2082239"," And we can have some ebbs and flows but I believe it's get out the popcorn moment the new tech"
"2082239","2083940"," bull market has begun. "
"2084159","2088580"," It has and so we shouldn't be scared off by what may be very high multiples as a result of"
"2088580","2091820"," enthusiasm around generative AI and what it's going to add in terms of enterprise."
"2091820","2095679"," Yeah because to that I think the maybe the multiple expansion was 23."
"2096520","2097900"," 24 it's going to mount monetization. "
"2098640","2101940"," I think we first see that in late January from the Dell and Microsoft."
"2101940","2103580"," I think we also see it from Google."
"2104100","2107200"," Then you look you got MongoDB, you got Palantir and others. "
"2107720","2109740"," Monization is akin when you talk about expensive."
"2110540","2113640"," I look at as we go into 24 25."
"2114360","2117260"," This is in my opinion it's a 1995 moment. "
"2117460","2120100"," It's the biggest tech transformation we've seen 30 years."
"2120100","2125480"," And I think this is really just the start of a revolution that's happened in AI monetization."
"2125640","2127120"," NASDAQ 20,000?"
"2127580","2128000"," Really?"
"2128320","2133820"," Well I think our bull case for this year is that tech stocks could be up 30-35 percent. "
"2134200","2140160"," And I think we could be sitting here as the ball drops on 24 with a 20k NASDAQ and we"
"2140160","2141480"," can have some sell-offs."
"2141660","2145000"," I mean if by the way if you're you know wrong on this I'm going to be able to hold"
"2145000","2149140"," you accountable because you always come in and if you're right on this you're going to cement the"
"2149140","2149780"," eyes reputation."
"2149780","2152300"," For years to come you don't even have to you can retire. "
"2152640","2154460"," Look I need K NASDAQ."
"2154580","2157040"," If we sit here next year this time with a 20k NASDAQ really?"
"2157500","2158460"," I'll be here."
"2158760","2164500"," And ultimately in my opinion it's really about the monetization that we're seeing here. "
"2164900","2168600"," It went from a narrow perspective tech to much broader."
"2169180","2171660"," And that's why I think this is really going to start M&A."
"2172100","2174100"," And you can see software and chips participate. "
"2174740","2178280"," I think a year from now 20k NASDAQ is our bull case."
"2178280","2182140"," And I think it's led by big tech software and chips."
"2182460","2182660"," Alright. "
"2182980","2185100"," Dan, way to start the year."
"2185320","2185620"," Good job."
"2185840","2188380"," That's one appearance so I'm going to keep track of it. "
"2188880","2192240"," I'm going to have an over-under maybe FanDuel is going to want to get in on this."
"2192740","2192860"," Yeah whatever."
"2193480","2193540"," Sure. "
"2193960","2194460"," Betting markets."

"2741430","2742410"," I want to show that to you in a minute."
"2742410","2747270"," But for the moment, I just want to point out that this is what a mean reversion trade looks like"
"2747270","2748770"," exactly what's happening today."
"2748850","2751110"," And we don't have to have an Apple downgrade to have this happen. "
"2751350","2752990"," Let's show you the sectors that are moving today."
"2753390","2757690"," What were the biggest sectors that underperformed last year in the S&P 500?"
"2758170","2760730"," They were healthcare, energy, utilities, and consumer staples."
"2761190","2761690"," What was the biggest?"
"2762310","2763450"," Outperformers included technology. "
"2764010","2765530"," What today is outperforming?"
"2766410","2768230"," Healthcare, energy, utilities, and consumer staples."
"2768570","2769750"," Exactly what underperformed."
"2769750","2771650"," This is what mean reversion trades look like. "
"2771810","2773370"," Technology, of course, big out performer."
"2773610","2774570"," It's underperforming today."
"2775090","2776230"," What underperformed?"
"2776390","2777890"," What big names underperformed?"
"2778090","2779950"," Don was talking about healthcare just a minute ago. "
"2780370","2785810"," Last year, well, Moderna Pfizer, Bristol Myers, Johnson & Johnson, big underperformers."
"2785970","2787730"," What are the top performers today?"
"2788610","2791470"," Moderna Pfizer, Bristol Myers, and Johnson & Johnson."
"2791770","2794070"," This is what mean reversion looks like. "
"2794550","2795310"," What's going on?"
"2795530","2798170"," What was another big underperformer last year?"
"2798170","2799310"," How about energy?"
"2799730","2801330"," Exxon, Chevron, big underperformers."
"2802230","2803190"," How about conical?"
"2803410","2805930"," How about some consumer staple names like Kroger & Altria?"
"2806310","2808210"," What are the top leaders today?"
"2808970","2812190"," Again, Exxon, Chicago, Kroger & Altria."
"2812450","2814510"," This is mean reversion in the classic way here. "
"2814930","2816850"," And what was finally on this theme?"
"2817310","2819050"," What was big, big movers?"
"2819230","2820830"," The big, big winners of last year."
"2820990","2826270"," What gained the most advanced micro, Nvidia, Apple, and we even had some strange names like Sherwin"
"2826270","2830170"," Williams and Norwegian Cruise Line, which was a 50% last year, Norwegian Cruise Line."
"2830350","2831730"," What are the big laggards today?"
"2832350","2833350"," Okay, you're following along?"
"2833650","2833930"," Paying attention?"
"2834370","2834630"," Very good. "
"2834990","2838910"," Advanced micro, Nvidia, Apple, Sherwin Williams and Norwegian Cruise Lines are the laggards."
"2839090","2840670"," So, folks, this is the mean reversion trade."
"2841190","2843450"," For this to keep working, a lot of things have to go right. "
"2843670","2849510"," Obviously, we're rotating into small cap and value for all of this to work other than today and"
"2849510","2850450"," play around with this stuff."
"2851010","2852650"," Interest rates have to keep coming down."
"2852850","2854110"," You've got to keep having the soft landing. "
"2854110","2855090"," So, we'll see."
"2855510","2856110"," We'll see."
"2856290","2857810"," But as of today, this is textbook. "
"2858330","2861710"," Let's talk about what happens after 20% up gains in the year."
"2861810","2863630"," First of all, believe it or not, it's not that unusual."
"2864370","2869530"," The S&P is up 20% or more about one third of the time since 1928. "
"2869870","2871290"," I know that sounds crazy, but look at this."
"2871610","2876350"," 36% of the time, it's up 20% of the more, 21% up 10% to 20%"
"2876350","2877150"," and 15%."
"2877690","2878630"," Add these numbers up. "
"2878810","2882550"," The S&P is up three out of four years in the last 95 years."
"2882550","2884410"," That's why indexing works."
"2884610","2887430"," You just stay with the market over time and it tends to go up. "
"2887810","2889090"," Declines of 10% or more."
"2889190","2889530"," Look at that."
"2889650","2891090"," It only happened 12% of the time. "
"2891230","2893550"," And like 2022, we were down 19%."
"2894110","2896630"," It's going to be a great way to stay the downside here."
"2897050","2899950"," January is a little bit of a point of view. "
"2899950","2900130"," It's going to be a point of view."
"2900430","2902790"," It's going to be around 20%."
"2902790","2904210"," So, don't expect so much. "
"2904310","2905230"," It's going to be a point of view."
"2905290","2908410"," It's going to be a point of view."
"2908410","2912530"," It's going to be a point of view. "
"2913210","2915350"," It hasn't happened very often."
"2915910","2923510"," It happened 65% of the time in the S&P 500 has 20% back-to-back gains."
"2924230","2929010"," Excuse me, 65% of the time it's up in 2024 in the following year here. "
"2929610","2931390"," It's down 35% of the time."
"2931530","2933530"," The dispersion is very, very large though."
"2933970","2939550"," So, I wouldn't put too much into the idea that there's a clear pattern here that the S&P once"
"2939550","2943470"," it's up 20% is inevitably up the following year, 20% or more. "
"2943750","2945330"," Now, let me just go on to the 20%."
"2945330","2948890"," People were asking me about, can you get two back-to-back 20% gains?"
"2949350","2950910"," That is extremely rare."
"2951090","2954250"," It's only happened nine times since 1928. "
"2954530","2955910"," So, nine times out of 95, do the math."
"2956070","2957650"," That's like 9% of the time here."
"2958110","2958670"," And here's what's interesting. "
"2959010","2960170"," Here's all the years it's ever happened."
"2960370","2962230"," We got back into two years in a row."
"2962330","2965350"," The last time it happened was 1999. "
"2966550","2970850"," And David, remember that in Epic Run, we were here from 1995 to 1998."
"2971870","2971930"," Right."
"2972290","2973610"," One percent back-to-back. "
"2973850","2974750"," You're not going to see that again."
"2974890","2980730"," And the last time it happened, up 20%, 1999 to two back-to-back 20% years."
"2981030","2986010"," So, for whatever reason, this is now a fairly rare event in market history. "
"2986170","2990370"," And nobody really has much memory other than you and me about this happening then."
"2990490","2990950"," So, we'll see."
"2991070","2993450"," But again, a lot has to go right for that to happen. "
"2993450","2995150"," Obviously, it's the interest rate scenario."
"2995430","2999090"," It was a seismic change in so much given the advent of the internet."
"2999510","3001750"," Maybe, generative AI will be similar to that. "
"3001950","3003850"," Dan, I certainly was sitting at a few minutes ago."
"3004070","3005210"," You know, cats off the Dan eyes."
"3005410","3006230"," He was directionally right. "
"3006510","3011070"," Much ridiculed on the year for his endless bullishness and those incredible outfits he wears."
"3011410","3012570"," But he was right on both counts."
"3012910","3015770"," The outfits are, he's iconic of the outfits and he was right directionally. "
"3015950","3016610"," So, we'll see."
"3016710","3017090"," But I agree."
"3017330","3024930"," There is an interesting question about whether the internet is the same, the paradigm shift as the"
"3024930","3026170"," internet proved to be. "
"3026290","3027450"," That's a very interesting question."
"3027730","3028190"," I think it's out."
"3028350","3029910"," And I think it's worth debating. "
"3030190","3030350"," Yeah."
"3030750","3031530"," You're saying there's a chance."
"3031770","3032090"," Oh, yeah. "
"3033390","3037590"," Well, we will be asking this question to our next guest then because the Nasdaq just hitting"
"3037590","3038370"," session lows."
"3038950","3044050"," Joining us now with his outlook for 2024 is Barry Baster, Stiefel Chief Equity Strategist."
"3044470","3045990"," Barry, thanks for being here. "
"3046130","3050990"," So, your prediction for the S&P this year is 4650 into mid-2024."
"3050990","3054130"," That actually indicates a 3% decline from today's level."
"3054290","3061130"," So, what Bob was just laying out in terms of, you know, the historical chances of, you know,"
"3061170","3067090"," repeating that 20% gain again this year, you actually think it will be declining, at least into mid "
"3067090","3067870","-2024. "
"3069050","3069530"," Yeah."
"3069630","3072710"," We're using 4650 as fair value in the first half."
"3072990","3076530"," I really don't have the vanity to try to look out to the end of the year. "
"3076690","3077730"," That's just too far out."
"3078430","3082330"," But we think that the first half will feature a 4650 S&P."
"3082610","3088410"," The market is simply expensive versus the financial conditions index and the tenure yield. "
"3088910","3094410"," And we don't really see outside of a recession much chance of the tenure remaining below 4%."
"3095090","3100890"," And in terms of that tenure, you say there's little downside catalyst other than a recession for"
"3100890","3102490"," the tenure yield to fall further."
"3102990","3106650"," Do you think the equity markets agree with that because there's been so much interplay this year in"
"3106650","3109890"," terms of where the tenure yield goes and where the equity market goes?"
"3111270","3115130"," Well, I heard you earlier reminiscing a little bit about back in the 90s. "
"3115210","3120030"," But if you think back to the early 80s, the first half of the 80s, we have just come off"
"3120030","3121370"," of the 70s inflation."
"3122690","3129270"," We had in the first five years of the 80s, a above 10% tenure yield and a 5%"
"3129270","3130890"," real yield on the 10."
"3132350","3133630"," There was muscle memory. "
"3133630","3139210"," There was a collective belief that we were going to go back to inflation, which we were not."
"3139410","3140750"," It peaked in April of 1980."
"3141570","3142730"," The same thing is happening now. "
"3142730","3148370"," The U.S. dollar U.S. dollar jobs was remembering the 2010s, the border line deflationary."
"3148790","3153690"," A more normal environment than 10 years should be closer to nominal GDP, potential of the United"
"3153690","3154170"," States."
"3154470","3156170"," And that's four in the above. "
"3157350","3161850"," How important is you look ahead to Friday this week with the jobs number?"
"3161850","3167370"," How important is that in just kind of helping everybody level set for how the market is set up?"
"3168370","3176330"," If you look at what constitutes the definition of recession, it's income, production, employment,"
"3176670","3178530"," fixed investments and sales."
"3179210","3183390"," The only thing that was not negative last year was employment."
"3183890","3185930"," In other words, everything else went negative. "
"3185930","3192590"," From the first quarter of 22 to the first quarter of 23, we had a pseudo or de facto recession."
"3193730","3198010"," The only thing that held out as I say is employment because the job market has just been incredibly"
"3198010","3200750"," strong due to post-COVID effects and other things."
"3202090","3205310"," If employment starts to weaken, that would be the last lag. "
"3205690","3207090"," I think that would take down everything."
"3207670","3212870"," So many of the leading indicators of what is normally a late cycle indicator employment or the"
"3212870","3217630"," things that we're watching to know if there is going to be economic trouble in 2024."
"3218410","3222350"," And until employment shows signs of weakening, I just don't see a recession. "
"3223250","3223870"," All right."
"3224050","3228370"," Well, we will certainly be keeping an eye on that and then earnings starting shortly thereafter."
"3229150","3230910"," So lots of catalysts to look for. "
"3231070","3232010"," Barry, thank you."
"3232710","3233130"," Thank you."
"3234450","3237190"," Bitcoin topping $45,000 a coin. "
"3237410","3239990"," That's the first time it's seen that level since April of 2022."
"3239990","3243450"," As that rally, well, it seems to be continuing in the new year."
"3243630","3244270"," Let's get to Kate Rooney. "
"3244430","3247370"," She has more on perhaps where this thing could go from here."
"3247630","3247790"," Kate."
"3249270","3249890"," Hey, David. "
"3249890","3250330"," Good morning."
"3250510","3252070"," So Bitcoin's new bull run."
"3252170","3254230"," It's being driven by two upcoming events. "
"3254230","3256250"," First, there's this hope for an ETF approval."
"3256530","3259710"," And then something called the halving that's coming up in April."
"3259930","3263150"," It's up 65% or so in the past three months ETF. "
"3263470","3265850"," That is the big driver guys of this price action."
"3265850","3271510"," The SEC has a January 10 deadline to approve or reject the ARK 21 shares ETF."
"3271890","3273550"," That's Kathy Woods proposal. "
"3273550","3278990"," They're Reuters reporting that the SEC could notify issuers as soon as this week, if they've been"
"3278990","3280970"," cleared to launch those ETFs."
"3281110","3284830"," If approved guys, this would be a publicly traded fund, tracking the price of Bitcoin."
"3285090","3289690"," So investors theoretically wouldn't need to go to a crypto exchange or hold Bitcoin directly"
"3289690","3290110"," themselves. "
"3290470","3292410"," So it may lower the barrier to entry here."
"3292410","3296510"," Because of that, some are arguing it's going to bring in a wider range of investors and then"
"3296510","3298330"," potentially more institutional interest."
"3298650","3301790"," Then you've got something called the Bitcoin halving. "
"3302010","3302670"," That's coming up in April."
"3302830","3306250"," The key thing to know about that Bitcoin's new issuance gets cut in half."
"3306470","3308710"," So it's a way to keep a cap on supply there. "
"3308830","3309510"," The code is written."
"3309710","3312670"," So there's only ever 21 million coins in circulation."
"3312730","3318050"," This dynamic makes it less profitable though to earn new Bitcoin and more competitive for what are"
"3318050","3319070"," known as the miners. "
"3319070","3324830"," So these are the companies using those massive high powered computers to create new Bitcoin, those"
"3324830","3330030"," mining stocks, think of marathon digital, riot blockchain, those guys have about double digits"
"3330030","3333990"," today or some micro strategy in Coinbase also higher this morning."
"3334390","3336590"," Actually, Coinbase turning lower down 6% or so."
"3336690","3342250"," The other driver for Bitcoin though, same thing, driving tech, small cap tech, especially some of"
"3342250","3347370"," the lower interest rates heading into this year, potentially, and return of risk appetite on the"
"3347370","3347990"," retail investors. "
"3347990","3348890"," Guys, back to you."
"3349270","3350730"," That was going to be my question, Kate."
"3351010","3356970"," How much of this is kind of a risk on sentiment versus just what we're seeing with overall approval"
"3356970","3363610"," expectations and, you know, basically how much of this sentiment versus the risk of a potential"
"3363610","3366590"," selling on the news once we ultimately get that news?"
"3367950","3369690"," That is a big dynamic here. "
"3369730","3372710"," Leslie, the idea that this is a buy the rumor, sell the news event."
"3372710","3376790"," So much of the price action has already been priced in at this point and an ETF."
"3376790","3381330"," Yes, it's an incremental positive, but it may not be as big of a deal. "
"3381570","3383010"," So it's one of those things, especially in crypto."
"3383210","3386030"," It tends to be a very frothy, FOMO-driven market."
"3386290","3388410"," So that's one thing of buyer beware at this point. "
"3388690","3393470"," Although Bitcoin, in terms of these idiosyncratic events, I mentioned the halving and things like"
"3393470","3396930"," that, it really has historically traded more on tech fundamentals."
"3397290","3402330"," It's seen as sort of this high beta tech play and it has traded like that historically too soon to"
"3402330","3405010"," tell if it's going to break out of that and sort of trade on its own fundamentals."
"3405170","3411950"," Right now, it's really tech, FOMO-driven rally and we see that time and time again, although that's"
"3411950","3416630"," a good thing right now for Bitcoin investors as tech and the NASDAQ had a pretty good year. "
"3417250","3419130"," It seems to be continuing so far in 2024."
"3419730","3422110"," Definitely trading more like tech than it is currency."
"3422830","3423610"," Kate, thank you. "
"3425210","3426050"," It's still to come."
"3426050","3431770"," Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest laggards among the big banks in 2023 and now they've got a new"
"3431770","3432190"," CEO."
"3432570","3434530"," We'll discuss the road ahead after the break. "
"3434790","3435350"," Don't go away."
"3625800","3626620"," My member."
"3628940","3629780"," Welcome back. "
"3630060","3637000"," Turning the calendar on to 2024 means a new leadership change in the C-suite at Morgan Stanley,"
"3637000","3639440"," taking over as CEO is Ted Pick."
"3639440","3644900"," He is taking over from James Gorman who had that role for about 14 years."
"3645260","3650820"," Gorman moving up to become executive chairman at least for about a year or so. "
"3650960","3654400"," But take a look at the performance of the big six banks."
"3654960","3660500"," You can see there, Morgan Stanley, the second biggest laggard among the group, up about 10% for the"
"3660500","3665700"," year, Bank of America, the biggest laggard, up about 1.7% in 2023."
"3665940","3667460"," So Pick has his hands full. "
"3668220","3673360"," We spoke with him back in October when his position was announced that he would be filling that"
"3673360","3674040"," role as CEO."
"3674660","3679440"," And I asked him kind of what the change in strategy might be, what he wants to put his stamp"
"3679440","3679800"," on."
"3680100","3680600"," Take a listen. "
"3683840","3685520"," The business strategy is sound."
"3685820","3687120"," There will be no change in strategy."
"3687660","3692640"," We know what we are after 15 years of transformation under James' extraordinary guidance. "
"3693440","3696580"," We've got a strategy where we have a world-class wealth and asset management business."
"3696580","3699140"," We've got a world-class and a great investment bank."
"3699380","3702060"," And there are so many opportunities to grow both of them globally. "
"3703580","3706040"," It's a strategy that's in place and we're going to keep with it."
"3706580","3710840"," So, change in leadership at the top, but no change in strategy."
"3711280","3713580"," Now, that doesn't mean he doesn't have his hands full. "
"3713760","3718660"," As he takes on this role, of course, you've got a slump in deal making, which I know David, you"
"3718660","3719860"," follow very, very closely."
"3720420","3723340"," They've also had slower inflows into wealth management."
"3723340","3727680"," Part of that has to do with rates and customers seeking out money market funds. "
"3727860","3731800"," We've got about 6 trillion in those given just the rate environment this year."
"3732700","3735880"," So, overall, strategy remains the same."
"3736240","3736280"," Right. "
"3736980","3742180"," But, you know, not transformation as was the case for the 14 years under Gorman, where you took"
"3742180","3747320"," what was an investment bank and really made it as much, if not more, an asset manager, more a"
"3747320","3753480"," wealth manager with a series of acquisitions, Sal and Smith Barney, Vance, he trade on from there,"
"3753660","3753920"," I guess."
"3754260","3758840"," So, is that, you know, but events can change your strategy."
"3759280","3764940"," And some might wonder, is it easier to be almost in a Gorman position where you are, as he"
"3764940","3768860"," described it in the interview with you a couple of weeks ago, you're taking a firm that's on the"
"3768860","3769160"," brink. "
"3769420","3773160"," I mean, he said it was basically a near-death experience for Morgan Stanley coming out of the"
"3773160","3773400"," crisis."
"3774300","3777640"," You basically, I mean, you get to kind of rewrite history."
"3778380","3784440"," You know, taking care of the baby that is being handed to you and, you know, preserving it, making"
"3784440","3785400"," sure it stays. "
"3785400","3786280"," Yeah, I think you're right."
"3786420","3788060"," I mean, Pick has a tougher time in a way."
"3788380","3788720"," It can be harder. "
"3789140","3791000"," Because, Morgan can always say, hey, listen, I came in."
"3791160","3792960"," We were on the brink, which, of course, they were."
"3793080","3794220"," It was right after the financial crisis. "
"3794960","3796860"," And he made his approach clear."
"3797320","3798520"," And he can claim real success."
"3798800","3799780"," It makes it more difficult for things. "
"3800000","3800820"," You just got to keep it going."
"3801120","3801440"," Exactly."
"3802540","3803900"," But the world changes around you. "
"3804200","3804500"," You've got AI."
"3804820","3805300"," You've got regulation."
"3805300","3809620"," You've got all these different things that are happening even in the near term to contend with. "
"3809820","3813060"," So it'll be interesting to follow his trajectory as CEO."
"3813440","3814820"," And we will do that with your help."
"3815000","3815280"," Of course. "
"3815440","3816720"," Largest firm by market cap."
"3816920","3817280"," There you go."
"3817640","3818440"," All right, still ahead. "
"3818940","3822940"," A good 2023 for the markets, of course, in the world's top tech billionaires."
"3823660","3825840"," We're going to break down their numbers."
"3825880","3826560"," That'll be nasty. "
"3995280","3996280"," 50% off."
"3997880","4000820"," All right, Nasdaq, you can see that in your session lows."
"4000820","4004160"," It is being dragged down by the mega cap tech names. "
"4004400","4005540"," We call them MAG7 stocks."
"4005800","4011560"," Apple, for example, is more than 3.5%. And any number of the other names are also down rather"
"4011560","4012060"," significantly."
"4012320","4015460"," You heard earlier in the program, of course, Jim Kramer did say, time to trim. "
"4016020","4018640"," As for 2023, it was a different story."
"4018840","4023460"," It proved a great year as well for some of the world's top tech billionaires."
"4025160","4029480"," We always get out of a tiny violin for them when Robert Frank joins us with those impressive"
"4029480","4029920"," numbers. "
"4029920","4032060"," It was kind of a wild ride for these folks."
"4032200","4034240"," You call it the great round trip of the rich."
"4034420","4040140"," The world's richest 500 billionaires, adding $1.5 trillion to their wealth last year after losing"
"4040140","4042580"," $1.4 trillion in 2022. "
"4042940","4046900"," Tech billionaires led the charge with the top 10 adding nearly a half billion to their wealth."
"4047540","4051660"," Elon Musk added the most in dollar terms with a gain of $96 billion."
"4052380","4057520"," He's back on top as the world's richest with $232 billion today. "
"4057520","4060260"," He lost $200 billion in 2022."
"4060780","4063500"," So he's still about $100 billion shy of his peak."
"4064080","4068120"," Mark Zuckerberg, close behind with a gain of $84 billion on meta stock increase. "
"4068420","4070080"," He's now worth $130 billion."
"4070700","4074740"," And that Microsoft stock run will that added $31 billion to Bill Gates?"
"4075400","4077480"," $45 billion to Steve Baumer."
"4077700","4082960"," And the Google guys, Larry Allison, all of them gaining over $30 billion. "
"4082960","4085740"," The biggest percentage gain are no surprise here."
"4086120","4091140"," Jensen Dwang at Nvidia, his fortune more than tripled to $44 billion."
"4091660","4093840"," He's now in the top 30 ranked 28. "
"4094460","4099020"," Warren Buffett, he had a good year adding $13 billion, but he could not keep up with all that tech"
"4099020","4099380"," stocks."
"4099960","4102300"," He fell from fifth place to 10th place."
"4102859","4107180"," Meanwhile, luxury King Bernard Arnault is still in second place after losing the top spot back"
"4107180","4112939"," in July. "
"4112939","4118700"," And for the year, he and Buffett are now the only two non-tech names in the top 10."
"4118960","4122359"," You could see a future where pretty soon it's all tech in the top 10."
"4122760","4124520"," The wealth is just extraordinary. "
"4124920","4127479"," You obviously covered very closely and so well for us."
"4127680","4128960"," But I mean, the numbers are truly extraordinary."
"4129340","4134620"," By the way, on Musk, does that include what we estimate his ownership of SpaceX's worth?"
"4135160","4135899"," Yes, it does. "
"4135939","4136740"," It includes all of it."
"4136920","4141819"," John Oliver said that his gain this year was like winning a marathon after running 200 miles in the"
"4141819","4142560"," wrong direction."
"4142560","4145040"," He lost $200 billion. "
"4145640","4147359"," And now he's ahead $100 billion."
"4147680","4151240"," Has that accounted for that huge loss of overall value in Twitter as well?"
"4151620","4157520"," That loss of Twitter, let's say it's down 71% according to that fidelity markdown today, it's like"
"4157520","4163840"," a rounding error on his $2.30. He's lost more than we'll ever have and he's still up there."
"4164060","4164899"," Oh, by a multiple of them. "
"4165140","4167020"," Every day, if I lose more than we'll ever have."
"4167500","4168140"," That's all right."
"4168640","4169279"," It's not that bad. "
"4170220","4170760"," It's just not."
"4170760","4172540"," It's a storm going on here."
"4173080","4173779"," Robert, thank you. "
"4173920","4174200"," Thank you."
"4174359","4176540"," Our live market coverage continues rather than this."
"4334490","4340910"," The U.S. to sell $80 billion in four-week bills on January 4th to settle on January 9th. "
"4352870","4353850"," Good Tuesday morning."
"4354110","4354870"," Welcome to Money Movers."
"4355070","4356570"," I'm David Shable with Leslie Picker. "
"4356670","4358590"," We're live in post-line of the New York Stock Exchange."
"4358590","4364250"," Today, cities global economists Rob Socken on a slowdown in global growth, and why he still sees a"
"4364250","4364730"," U.S. recession."
"4365330","4369070"," Then conflict grows in the Red Sea with the arrival of an Iranian warship. "
"4369230","4371250"," We'll look at the impact for the energy markets."
"4371750","4377890"," And finally, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo on why cities stock that city group can double over the next"
"4377890","4378490"," three years."
"4379030","4380610"," But first, a look at the markets. "
"4381270","4384830"," You've got the Dow turning positive barely hanging in there."
"4384830","4388210"," The Nasdaq down 1.8 percent currently."
"4388870","4391370"," Just a little bit off of session, Lowe's. "
"4391630","4397630"," Topping the tape for us today flows in 2023 global equity saw $172 billion worth of inflows."
"4397830","4402630"," While that sounds like a huge number, it's actually the least amount in the past four years,"
"4402630","4403750"," despite the massive rally."
"4404170","4408130"," Even in a down tape 2022 saw larger inflows. "
"4408230","4414490"," Let's bring in CNBC senior markets commentator Mike Santoli, who can help explain this dynamic and"
"4414490","4418750"," why flows may not necessarily indicate performance in these broader markets."
"4419110","4423070"," Yeah, to some degree, Leslie, flows do chase performance rather than leading it."
"4423230","4428770"," These numbers from Goldman Sachs do show on an annual basis, really investors are not overexcited"
"4428770","4429270"," about stocks. "
"4429610","4434350"," Now, we'll say because the index is up a lot there for the value of people's equity portfolios, or"
"4434350","4439910"," higher, you know, the market kind of did its work for you in terms of getting you further exposed"
"4439910","4440950"," to equities."
"4440950","4446470"," On a shorter term basis, too, I mean, in the latest performance week, net inflows were the highest"
"4446470","4447950"," that they've been in six months."
"4448230","4452670"," And then on about a three-month rolling basis, I saw some data this morning suggesting we are at"
"4452670","4457490"," some extremes in terms of the volume of money rushing in to things like S&P 500 ETF. "
"4457850","4460990"," So it all fits in with this idea of short term."
"4461130","4463650"," The market seems like it's a little bit stretched and running kind of hot."
"4464030","4464890"," Maybe you should cool off. "
"4465110","4466470"," Maybe we get a little bit of a sentiment reset."
"4466470","4472610"," But longer term, it doesn't seem as if people are fully all in or fully in greed mode."
"4472610","4478090"," And the final point on that is if you look at the Wall Street strategist's array of targets for the"
"4478090","4482710"," S&P 500 for the end of 2024, the upper end of it is 5200. "
"4483350","4487270"," Now, that would be nice, of course, for a lot of investors, but that's only a 9% gain from"
"4487270","4488430"," where we finished last year."
"4488430","4495390"," And in general, in aggregate, the strategist see very little net progress happening in stock prices"
"4495390","4495950"," this year."
"4496210","4500950"," You have some forecasting downside, you know, to 4200 or something like that at JPMorgan. "
"4501330","4505910"," So I do think that it's a little bit of a, you know, people are getting more interested, but not"
"4505910","4506650"," yet over their schemes."
"4506890","4508490"," Yeah, quite the dispersion in those forecasts."
"4508990","4514550"," I know in your column over the weekend, you mentioned the $6 trillion in money market assets and"
"4514550","4518350"," this kind of notion that they could be fuel for the next leg of a bull market. "
"4518410","4520310"," But you say that that's actually ill-considered."
"4520950","4521690"," Why is that?"
"4521950","4526750"," For a couple of reasons, Luzzi, first of all, retail money market assets are more like 2.5 trillion"
"4526750","4529990"," of that as opposed to the $6 trillion that you hear mentioned all the time."
"4530370","4534910"," A lot of the 2.5 trillion, as you know, is really just replacing bank deposits. "
"4535190","4539770"," It was sort of a cash substitute as opposed to money that's poised to enter the equity market."
"4539770","4545470"," And in general, it's just in aggregate, not a huge number relative to the size of U.S. equities."
"4545790","4552290"," Back in 2009 at the bottom, money market assets were half of equity market caps, S&P 500 market cap"
"4552290","4552710"," now. "
"4553370","4556730"," I mean, equity market cap is like $45 trillion or something like that."
"4556890","4558950"," You have $6 trillion in aggregate in money market."
"4559130","4562570"," So to me, it's just not the place to look if you want to build a bullish case. "
"4562910","4564450"," Sure, people could put more money in the market."
"4564830","4567630"," People could let their equity allocations go higher if stocks do well."
"4567630","4572790"," But I don't think that you want to necessarily hinge a positive view on the fact that people are"
"4572790","4574450"," going to be running out of money market. "
"4574870","4579070"," Yeah, it sounds a little bit like what Kate Rooney was just telling us about people's bull case for"
"4579070","4579910"," Bitcoin this year."
"4580170","4583650"," Just kind of a whole risk on mentality there."
"4584070","4584950"," Mike, thank you. "
"4585830","4591190"," Our next guest expects a global growth slowdown and U.S. recession this year, but notes the soft"
"4591190","4595670"," landing possibility has risen and is keeping a close eye on consumer spending, supply chains and"
"4595670","4598970"," Fed commentary, joining us now city global economist Rob Socken."
"4599310","4605030"," So you are in the slowdown camp, but soft landing, you think, is becoming more likely."
"4605870","4613210"," Do you think that those Fed lag effects from the historic hiking of interest rates that they"
"4613210","4618570"," supersede the Fed pivot that has largely been kind of working its way through the various markets?"
"4619310","4620410"," That's a great question. "
"4620410","4626230"," I think we're still seeing signs that those interest rate hikes that we had earlier in the cycle"
"4626230","4627490"," are playing through the system."
"4627910","4634810"," I would point to still tightening credit conditions that typically you only see around recessionary"
"4634810","4635090"," periods."
"4635610","4641890"," We're seeing growing strains among lower income consumers in the U.S. And that is another sign that"
"4641890","4643750"," those interest rates are really starting to play through. "
"4644050","4646410"," On the other hand, as you said, the Fed has started to pivot already."
"4646990","4650470"," They just saw our other direction against other strains."
"4650830","4654990"," I saw Chase as the morning trader podcast. "
"4655230","4655730"," How are you, brother?"
"4657770","4658550"," Who asked?"
"4659090","4659610"," What did I see?"
"4660370","4662910"," I thought I saw Chase ask, are we going up?"
"4663150","4670190"," So if you want to know if we're going up, I don't think so."
"4670190","4675790"," I think we roll still, whether that's right now or we retest above here."
"4676830","4680010"," And come straight back down on this half hour trigger. "
"4680950","4684510"," We do have some flattening here, which is a productive for bulls."
"4685230","4688790"," This is good to see here for bulls, right?"
"4689290","4691790"," This is all good sideways, a little bit more sideways action."
"4692710","4696030"," But we are still underneath the half hour and hour trigger. "
"4696770","4701290"," So I'm going to expect any kind of move up to be rejected, even though this is constructive."
"4702530","4709250"," You also have a cross that just happened down below over here on SPX."
"4709910","4712650"," So draw your attention to this cross right here. "
"4712710","4715310"," You got the half hour trigger cross in the hourly trigger just now."
"4715930","4719970"," That can lead at times to a recheck above for that move down."
"4721070","4727350"," And we are also still trading below the gamma flip on gamma. "
"4727350","4737150"," So still on, or I should say bears still kind of in"
"4737150","4743210"," control here to an extent, trying to trade and retest the daily trigger."
"4744230","4745750"," We can recover here."
"4745890","4751430"," If you want to get bullish and buy a dip, you are going to be looking for one of two"
"4751430","4755310"," things, either a test of the daily trigger that's across the board. "
"4755310","4758890"," That's on IWM, queues, spy, SPX, whatever."
"4759850","4766810"," Or if you're trying to get long here as a bull for continued upside movement over the rest of the"
"4766810","4770850"," week, you are going to wait, right?"
"4771450","4775750"," You're going to wait for price action to get above the hourly trigger."
"4776230","4779350"," Remember that we don't care how high that goes. "
"4779610","4783370"," If it's screaming high or if it just breaks above, it doesn't really matter."
"4783370","4790450"," What we're really looking for is that back test on the hourly trigger to go higher and be in safety"
"4790450","4791250"," once again."
"4791610","4801340"," So if you're a bull, you are looking for something to play out like this, right?"
"4802140","4803620"," Here's your hourly trigger, right?"
"4803800","4807720"," You'd be looking for price to come higher here, squeeze up. "
"4809920","4811940"," Some form of back test."
"4813120","4819600"," I always talk to you guys about a three-hour look back with that back test as well."
"4819940","4827080"," So if you see improved conditions, looking three hours in the past, that would probably be most of"
"4827080","4827520"," this morning. "
"4828440","4834080"," And then some kind of a pullback retest of the hourly trigger here and then a resumption to the"
"4834080","4834240"," upside."
"4835080","4836280"," Price goes higher."
"4836760","4843580"," The moment you break that previous high after regaining the hourly trigger, you should see another"
"4843580","4846500"," pullback right here, and I would be jumping on long there. "
"4847340","4849760"," So bulls have some work to do, right?"
"4849940","4854500"," Is the point here is that bulls would want to see if there's the five-minute trigger right there."
"4855060","4857980"," Here's the one-minute trigger would be coming back up again, right?"
"4858840","4861260"," And you've got everything on your side at that point, right?"
"4861420","4863940"," You've got price above the hourly trigger."
"4863940","4870500"," You've got the back check of the one-in-five-minute trigger, three-figure bull cluster over here. "
"4871100","4877280"," And this is where you would actually make an entry for a long position on spy in relative safety."
"4878340","4880840"," You know, trying to time these bottoms and dips down here."
"4881680","4890200"," I'm going to tell you right now that there's an easy open door currently for any kind of a"
"4890200","4896800"," rejection or just a test of that half-hour trigger to trade this daily trigger right down here,"
"4896860","4897460"," believe it or not. "
"4897660","4900740"," So you're like, hey, everything's awesome sauce up here."
"4900740","4901840"," You get the rejection."
"4902760","4910800"," Before you know it, on just that rejection, you are straight up just blasting down in your real V"
"4910800","4913720"," shape recovery or buy was down below here. "
"4915000","4923300"," Now, if we do roll down to this daily trigger, you're then going to expect one of two things to"
"4923300","4923740"," happen."
"4924120","4929800"," There's a range of consolidation in here, V shape recovery, range consolidation."
"4930660","4932620"," You can just day trade, intraday trade this stuff. "
"4933840","4937000"," And then again, wait until we get above the hourly trigger."
"4937420","4941000"," Or this consolidation will turn into some distribution."
"4942280","4944260"," And the hourly trigger will come on down here. "
"4944260","4948940"," The half-hour trigger one down here will start selling and breaking the bull trend."
"4950000","4954260"," So right now, if you're a bull, always better."
"4954600","4956500"," Let me give you a better example of this too. "
"4956740","4966640"," So I can switch over to a trigger map for, you know, so here's Spy right"
"4966640","4967120"," here, right?"
"4967700","4969260"," This is a full map on Spy."
"4969260","4972700"," All right."
"4973920","4975240"," Let's look back here. "
"4975440","4978340"," This is November 22nd, okay?"
"4979020","4982840"," Price gets above the hourly trigger or the daily trigger, right?"
"4984760","4987260"," Has a successful back test of the hourly."
"4987660","4990520"," Successful back test of the hourly loses the hourly."
"4991060","4993280"," Comes back above again and successfully retests. "
"4993500","4994320"," You make that money there."
"4994320","4999240"," And to further that point, you're still above trend in this daily trigger, right?"
"4999400","5000640"," So everything is bullish still."
"5001040","5004800"," Price is currently still above that daily trigger right now. "
"5004880","5009180"," So we are in a bullish context right now, but truth be told."
"5010980","5016220"," You're kind of right now at this moment, if you're trying to buy a dip, you're trying to be this"
"5016220","5017080"," guy right here."
"5018540","5019420"," All right. "
"5019600","5023940"," And here's like a failure, a failure, a failure, you know, a failure."
"5024580","5026060"," It was like kind of, kind of, kind of."
"5026280","5034860"," And the reality is you want to see the squeeze up and then the successful to actually take that"
"5034860","5035180"," long. "
"5035640","5035660"," Okay."
"5035980","5037920"," So this is where you start making real money in here."
"5038600","5040040"," You can see it right there, right?"
"5040220","5042960"," The successful back test, not the failure back test. "
"5042960","5048880"," The other thing to be looking at here too would be if we are going to maintain trend to the"
"5048880","5055880"," upside to be checking to be checking the hourly velocity."
"5056340","5061120"," Always like to see this at minimum hourly velocity and the negative."
"5061500","5065840"," We try to buy dips on that negative downside and we're getting there, right?"
"5066060","5066600"," See it right here. "
"5066740","5071520"," We're almost there, but still no higher lows on that hourly."
"5071520","5076840"," So if we're looking for more continuation of the upside and the daily velocity, that's possible"
"5076840","5077240"," still."
"5077680","5081200"," And of course, just waiting for that last little bit, just a little tiny bit. "
"5081540","5083140"," Right now we're at minus 37."
"5084000","5090620"," Because we're below minus 25, I would like to see the minus 50 on daily velocity at this point."
"5091200","5093840"," Not no guarantees we get it, but there's a high probability we do. "
"5094740","5097240"," So for where we are right now in the market."
"5098120","5105360"," The expectation here is going to be that we trade this up and test this S1 in this 30 minute"
"5105360","5105620"," trigger."
"5106000","5111620"," And we're going to roll down here and likely get underneath this S3 and possibly even open on"
"5111620","5115160"," Tuesday down here at this 464 33. "
"5116400","5119280"," Okay, so this is the expectation at this point."
"5119700","5125500"," If that expectation will change, if at any point price comes above the hourly trigger successfully"
"5125500","5130440"," retests and begins to make its way higher from this previous high right here."
"5130920","5134340"," And in all honesty, this one right here, I'd really like to see that one as well. "
"5135120","5138520"," Otherwise it can become range bound to some consolidating or even some distribution."
"5139740","5149260"," So if you're a bull, no real trade here for you right now."
"5159730","5164610"," In Yemen, just like they do Hezbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. "
"5164970","5170090"," So this really is a ratcheting up of tensions and one that could drag the United States into a"
"5170090","5172690"," broader regional war against the Iranians."
"5173170","5175390"," Now that could really be bad for just about everybody."
"5175390","5180410"," And we've been seeing a lot of continued fighting, not just in the Red Sea, but also over the"
"5180410","5184930"," border between Lebanon and Israel, north of where I'm standing now, between the Israeli Defense"
"5184930","5192850"," Forces, the Israeli military, and Palestinian or Arab militant groups, namely Hezbollah, which is"
"5192850","5196590"," the most powerful anti-Israel militant group in southern Lebanon. "
"5197030","5200870"," So we're seeing this expanding, but there's also some domestic news here in Israel."
"5201490","5207810"," Benjamin Netanyahu took a major blow just today when the Supreme Court decided to reject his"
"5207810","5212970"," legislation that would have essentially kneecapped the judiciary and kept them from making"
"5212970","5215250"," decisions based on a reasonableness doctrine."
"5215310","5220330"," This was something that allowed the judiciary judges to essentially say that if a law that was"
"5220330","5224330"," passed by parliament or some sort of measure that was put in place by the cabinet, that they called"
"5224330","5227090"," it unreasonable, they would be allowed to block it. "
"5227370","5233210"," Now Benjamin Netanyahu and his unprecedentedly right-wing cabinet have bucked against that for the"
"5233210","5234090"," past several years."
"5234090","5238170"," They had legislation that would have basically kept the judiciary from doing that, the judiciary"
"5238170","5240850"," again, today, blocked it somehow."
"5241090","5246250"," Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing partners are going to either have to drop this legislation or"
"5246250","5252150"," come up with some new method to get past the Supreme Court, some new way of writing this law, but"
"5252150","5257650"," the fact is that this is dividing Israel more than it already has been at a time when it really"
"5257650","5258750"," doesn't need to be divided. "
"5259330","5259690"," Guys?"
"5260110","5265250"," Yeah, Matt, and of course may have also distracted the IDF to a large extent as well."
"5266610","5267170"," Thank you."
"5267510","5271410"," Let's talk a bit more about where all this goes from here and what it's going to mean for energy"
"5271410","5275350"," joining us now is RBC's head of Global Commodity Strategy, Helene Macroft. "
"5275430","5276050"," It's good to see you."
"5276070","5276810"," Thank you for having me on."
"5276950","5278290"," There's a lot to keep track of. "
"5278430","5283110"," I'm curious, Helene, given your long experience, both in geopolitics as well, you know, what are"
"5283110","5286130"," you focused on sort of as key moments here or key events?"
"5286130","5288770"," I mean, there are really three fronts to pay close attention to."
"5288890","5292670"," Obviously, what's happening in the Red Sea with the Iranian warship entering the Red Sea, the"
"5292670","5297610"," sinking of the three Houthi ships over the weekend, but the situation in Lebanon is also a really"
"5297610","5300090"," important pathway to potential escalation in the region."
"5300310","5304510"," And we just had reports that there have been, you know, some type of explosion that happened, you"
"5304510","5305370"," know, in southern Beirut. "
"5305970","5311230"," The question is, are the Israelis now backing wars with action in terms of taking more decisive"
"5311230","5312410"," action against Hezbollah?"
"5312410","5318870"," They have said that Hezbollah needs to leave the border area, comply with UN Resolution 1701, and"
"5318870","5322170"," if they do not leave the border area, they will confront Hezbollah directly."
"5322630","5327230"," That would be something I'd say to be very concerned about, but obviously that is a situation where"
"5327230","5328230"," it's close watching."
"5328710","5330850"," Yeah, and what does it all mean in terms of the price of oil?"
"5331010","5332870"," You know, we've seen some volatility this morning. "
"5333250","5334670"," Obviously, we know the Red Sea."
"5335270","5336890"," Iran is a huge provider as well."
"5338150","5342250"," Where, you know, and what are you focused on in terms of trying to determine what it means in your"
"5342250","5342790"," term for oil?"
"5342950","5346910"," All market participants are essentially saying, I will believe a disruption when I see it. "
"5346990","5352170"," So, yes, you have to run up in places, but given the importance of this region in terms of shipping"
"5352170","5356670"," of crude, production of crude, it's not really reflecting the ratcheting up of tensions."
"5356950","5359230"," I think so many traders got burned on Russia."
"5359650","5364230"," So many people, when that war began, said, we're going to see significant Russian supply"
"5364230","5366450"," disruptions that did not materialize. "
"5367030","5370770"," And so now they're saying, look, we've had problems in the Middle East before."
"5371050","5372290"," Tell me why this is different."
"5372510","5377110"," I think it's materially different, but right now we've had no major disruption of oil supplies. "
"5377570","5377650"," Yeah."
"5378030","5380690"," Well, we're doing a pretty good job of keeping things supplied, aren't we?"
"5380770","5382990"," 13.2 million going up from there."
"5383170","5383530"," Exactly. "
"5383770","5387470"," I mean, this is the backdrop in terms of a well-supplied oil market."
"5387470","5390670"," The U.S. production story was gangbusters last year."
"5391270","5392450"," That has weighed on prices. "
"5393150","5398930"," But, again, if we were to see something material involving Iran, I mean, the really important"
"5398930","5401490"," waterway to pay attention to is the straits of our moves."
"5401690","5404490"," And the Iranians have targeted tankers in the straits before."
"5404790","5405530"," They did in 2019. "
"5406290","5410930"," If you saw any action in the straits, that would be material for oil prices."
"5411430","5416110"," Why do you think this is so much different than what we saw in Russia and Ukraine two years ago?"
"5416110","5419330"," What is it that the market isn't really discounting at this point in time?"
"5419410","5422850"," Well, I think the market is basically saying, tell me how this gets worse."
"5423350","5429570"," And we look at the situation and say, we have three active theaters right now, which could"
"5429570","5431370"," basically lead to a broader conflict. "
"5431750","5432950"," We've talked about the Red Sea."
"5433090","5434050"," We've talked about Lebanon."
"5434490","5440770"," But we also have a situation in Iraq with Iranian-backed militias firing on bases housing U.S."
"5441010","5441470"," troops in Iraq. "
"5441470","5445070"," You have these same militias firing into the Golan Heights over the weekend."
"5445710","5448870"," And so, again, Iraq is a major oil producer as well."
"5449110","5453650"," And so I think the market is basically saying, we will wait and see if something happens. "
"5454150","5457110"," But it's really getting much more serious every day."
"5457390","5461410"," What do you think is the red line for the U.S. to have more of a direct involvement?"
"5461750","5467530"," Because so far, it feels like there's a lot of, you know, theaters, as you mentioned, and a lot of"
"5467530","5467870"," activity."
"5467870","5473070"," But what is that line where it will be forced to act more directly?"
"5473090","5474110"," That is a million-dollar question. "
"5474350","5478710"," I mean, certainly with President Trump, he drew that lead line as the loss of American life."
"5478710","5482930"," Remember, that's why we killed Qasem Soleimani, the head of the coup's force, the Revolutionary"
"5482930","5483390"," Guard."
"5484030","5488210"," We don't know yet really what is the red line for President Biden. "
"5488290","5493350"," Now, if you have one of these attacks, lead to a significant loss of U.S. servicemen in Iraq, would"
"5493350","5494830"," that be a significant red line?"
"5494830","5498190"," But the question is, is the U.S. even really in control of events?"
"5498390","5503510"," Like, that's why we say watch the situation in Lebanon, because the Israelis have said that they"
"5503510","5506770"," are not going to stand for Hezbollah staying on that border."
"5506970","5511390"," They want to encourage their own internally displaced people to move back to northern Israel."
"5511390","5515270"," So that is a flashpoint that I think bears very close watching. "
"5515490","5519270"," Yeah, they've had hundreds of thousands of people who've moved out of that northern border area."
"5519790","5523710"," Of course, Iran backs Hezbollah, which is far more sophisticated."
"5524570","5525770"," 150,000 rockets. "
"5526350","5528050"," And it's soldiers as well."
"5528210","5530950"," They are at the center of all three of these stories."
"5531250","5534710"," And at a minimum, I think the question of Biden administration is going to face as we bring it back"
"5534710","5538610"," to oil is, are we going to continue to allow so much Iranian oil on the market?"
"5538610","5542450"," You talked about U.S. production, gangbusters in 2023. "
"5542570","5546010"," We also saw rising Iranian exports as well."
"5546390","5548290"," Does the Iranian economy doing that?"
"5548290","5550330"," And the U.S. has 68 billion dollars."
"5551150","5553830"," They've suffered with inflation, they've suffered with protests. "
"5554490","5556150"," But again, it's the same story with Russia."
"5556730","5563030"," If you retain access to your most vital source of revenue, you can keep your activities going."
"5563270","5566290"," When it comes to funding your war machine and funding your proxies. "
"5566890","5567690"," Alima, thank you."
"5567790","5568470"," Thank you for having me."
"5568790","5569430"," Alima Croft. "
"5569810","5574530"," Later on this hour in New York in California, consider wealth taxes as revenues are drying."
"5574830","5576850"," We're going to look at what those proposals include."
"5576850","5581450"," Whilst we're keeping an eye on the cyber security names underperforming the broader market, the"
"5581450","5586310"," cyber ETF is down to the fourth straight day and on pace for its worst day since August. "

"5593130","5593990"," We'll back in a moment."
"5602320","5728060"," I'm also"
"5728060","5731900"," going to stop in real quick and give you one other thing. "
"5731900","5733160"," Let's take a look at this here."
"5734360","5737990"," One quick second here."
"5765780","5767140"," Switch over here. "
"5769280","5776760"," Here's an updated JPM caller for SPX for Q1 of 2024."
"5777560","5781480"," We did wind up popping the caller on Q3."
"5781920","5783840"," This is a very rare thing to do. "
"5783840","5788380"," Last time we did this, I think, was in spring of 2020."
"5789600","5795420"," Even so, whether we pop a call or blast through the bottom of a caller, it's rare."
"5795700","5799460"," It's like 99.95% of the time. "
"5799900","5801520"," You don't see the caller get popped."
"5801860","5802800"," This one did get popped."
"5803820","5806000"," Keep an eye on this in Q1. "
"5806820","5812000"," The expectation here would be that we'd come back down here into some form of support."
"5812720","5816360"," Fail to hit the magnet at 5015."
"5816360","5819480"," This is the current magnet, by the way, whether you know that or not. "
"5820120","5821540"," But I think we fail this."
"5821880","5828040"," This should line up somewhat with getting that all time high that we failed to get on SPX into the"
"5828040","5830800"," end of Q4 of 2023."
"5830800","5860780"," That's"
"5860780","5860780"," 11. "
"5860780","5863480"," So, I think that's one of the things that you expect in the year that you'd be looking for."
"5864860","5868840"," As a matter of fact, this would come back up there and then appear into the first quarter and then"
"5868840","5871300"," come back up and call that whole entire trend all the way up."
"5872080","5881120"," But just keep an eye out on this on this on this SPX caller for JQ for Q1"
"5881120","5883300"," of 2024. "
"5884680","5886860"," You can take a snapshot of that if you like right now."
"5886860","5890760"," So you have it for your records into this quarter."
"5909400","5915580"," Service now was up 75% huge at new highs all the time that you see down 3% today. "
"5916140","5922460"," Other sort of sub sectors of tech did a little bit better even Shopify rallied rather nicely and"
"5922460","5923360"," that was up notably."
"5923780","5926100"," That's down about 5% today here."
"5926100","5926840"," Congrats on that. "
"5926840","5927400"," I'll be your friend."
"5927420","5927700"," I'll be your friend."

"5961520","5962540"," to be down today. "
"5962840","5968680"," Then I wanted to show you some other names that are out there, consumer staples, names tough times"
"5968680","5969440"," last year."
"5969600","5971120"," We talked about Campbells hitting new lows."
"5971420","5974520"," Almost every day in the final quarter of the year here. "
"5974920","5977080"," And there's Campbells Troop up about 2%."
"5977700","5978860"," Craft is up."
"5979200","5979900"," Altry is up. "
"5981000","5981760"," You got the idea here."
"5981760","5984900"," These are mean-reversion traits, play the opposite side of what happened."
"5985480","5988560"," A biggest example is just looking at the pharmaceutical names. "
"5988820","5991440"," Tom's got a pivot right here, but take a look at Pfizer."
"5991820","5995220"," These, all of these names, Pfizer was down 40 percent last year."
"5995840","5997640"," Rally, modestly today, same thing. "
"5998260","6000260"," Bristol Myers down 25 percent."
"6000440","6000900"," It's rallying."
"6001600","6002300"," Merck down big. "
"6003060","6003520"," It's rallying."
"6003960","6004420"," You get the idea."
"6004760","6006320"," Now, the problem, you guys know this. "
"6006440","6007140"," David, you know this."
"6007300","6013040"," These mean-reversion traits don't really work for any long periods of time, unless conditions are"
"6013040","6013360"," perfect."
"6013740","6015060"," You've got to keep the interest rates low. "
"6015400","6017460"," You've got to keep the soft landing going, and we'll see."
"6018020","6020200"," Other than that, this is a fairly typical start."
"6020200","6020980"," You asked crude oil for you, too. "
"6021180","6021940"," That's what I wanted to do."
"6022300","6023040"," Yeah, I guess."
"6023240","6025920"," If they lasted forever, they would just come back at neutral. "
"6026840","6028640"," So, we are thankful for that."
"6028920","6030060"," Bob, appreciate it."
"6030520","6031840"," Time now for a news update. "
"6032120","6033260"," Bertha Coombs has that for us."

"6080060","6082720"," Davis had pleaded not guilty to the murder charge."
"6083180","6087260"," He's been in jail without bail since his September 29th arrest. "
"6088200","6094600"," And a set of twins in South Jersey were born minutes apart, but in different years."

"6120280","6120860"," then take it."
"6122100","6126520"," Most importantly, they also get their own birthdays, which is good too."
"6126660","6127100"," That's true. "
"6127180","6129860"," Holiday baby myself, I can appreciate that."
"6130380","6131300"," Bertha, thank you."
"6132120","6135940"," Up next, Mike Mayo says city stock can double over the next three years. "
"6136060","6138960"," He joins us right here at post nine to break down the bold case."
"6139580","6143120"," What's his outlook for Morgan Stanley as the new CEO takes over?"

"6349980","6353680"," We're keeping an eye on the chip stocks ASML amongst the biggest declineers."
"6353760","6358400"," This after was barred by the Dutch government from exporting some of its products to China. "
"6358980","6363720"," That move comes after the U.S. government tightened export controls on some semiconductor and chip"
"6363720","6365440"," making tools to China."
"6366000","6368160"," The move taking the rest of the complex down as well."
"6368300","6370180"," You can see that wasn't over. "
"6370560","6372740"," Actually it was not well."
"6373040","6373800"," The rest are."
"6374600","6375840"," Yeah, absolutely. "
"6376460","6381380"," A bold case from the desk of Wells Fargo's desk grabbing our attention this morning."
"6381420","6387160"," The firm hikes their 12 month price target on Citigroup to 70 and expects the stock to double to"
"6387160","6389760"," over $100 per share in the next three years."
"6389980","6394940"," They expect EPS to jump due to efficiencies, buybacks, revenue gains. "
"6395320","6396840"," The analyst behind that call joins us now."
"6397040","6399440"," Wells Fargo's head of U.S. large cap bank research."
"6399900","6400240"," Mike Mayo. "
"6400620","6404020"," Mike kicking off the year with a bang here."
"6404560","6409700"," So the market for the most part has really discounted city stock due to execution risk surrounding"
"6409700","6413120"," turn around some of the divestitures that they're working on."
"6413620","6419900"," You think that execution risk that the market's concerned about is misplace absolutely to the"
"6419900","6427080"," investors that say that Citigroup is unmanageable unquantifiable and uninvestable. "
"6427260","6429780"," I say you're absolutely wrong."
"6430480","6433340"," And I and we have a new 50 paid."
"6435740","6439740"," Just to note here, we've got a nice gap to close above on HYG. "
"6440020","6443220"," Have a bear cross coming up on VIX on the one minute chart."
"6444060","6449520"," Apple coming back to test a bull cross in the one minute trigger for an upside move."
"6449800","6453040"," Dixie looking weak here with a bear cross on it. "
"6453780","6460080"," And NASDAQ trying to or NDX at least trying to form a bull cross to the upside."
"6460480","6463680"," T and X looking like it's forming a bear cross as well."
"6464200","6472800"," So the secondary sector indicators are all lining up for a bullish move to the upside. "
"6472940","6473840"," We'll see if it'll play out."
"6477230","6481230"," So they are becoming a much more simple and profitable firm."
"6481490","6485290"," And I think that their earnings will double over the next three years. "
"6485290","6489190"," And as investors catch wind of that, I think this stock will catch a better bit."
"6489350","6491210"," So you're a Jane Fraser fan."
"6491430","6491810"," Why?"
"6492730","6494250"," I think fan is in context. "
"6494610","6494870"," Okay."
"6495350","6499750"," So I've heard you be pretty critical, unlike many other analysts with the years of many CEOs"
"6499750","6501810"," outspoken sometimes."
"6502290","6503890"," And in this case, you seem to be supportive. "
"6504370","6504510"," Why?"
"6504830","6511550"," Well, I'd say Jane Fraser is finally addressing the decades old issues that have played Citigroup."
"6511910","6515430"," It goes back to Sandy Wile and the acquisitions that he made."
"6515530","6518870"," It did great for a while, but they weren't fully integrated. "
"6519410","6521690"," So now they're getting integrated two decades later."
"6522010","6525910"," They pursued a global strategy of consumer banking."
"6526850","6527290"," That was flawed. "
"6527290","6530390"," That goes back two, three, four, five decades."
"6530950","6532210"," So they're retreating from that."
"6532690","6536970"," They're finally attacking their technical debt or their legacy infrastructure. "
"6537750","6543510"," And the matrix management structure that they've had for decades is finally going way to those five"
"6543510","6544330"," lines of business."
"6544690","6548550"," So we can now talk about Citigroup like a normal company."
"6548770","6550610"," So am I a Jane Fraser fan?"
"6551170","6553350"," I think she's moving the right direction. "
"6553470","6558290"," It still waits to be seen whether she'll execute, but she can get a lot wrong and the stock can"
"6558290","6559070"," still go a lot higher."
"6559310","6563250"," But also the macro can go wrong as well because they're doing this."
"6563390","6565170"," They're doing this turnaround against a backdrop. "
"6565230","6569990"," That's been at least in the last few months, pretty favorable for the banking environment."
"6570550","6574550"," But if there is some sort of recession, not a soft landing, but a real recession."
"6574750","6579590"," I mean, they have a lot of exposure to cards, a lot of exposure to consumer, and they're becoming"
"6579590","6583610"," more focused on the U.S., which limits the diversification of other markets as well. "
"6583610","6584790"," Well, I agree."
"6585010","6587610"," So we have several scenarios in our 50-page report."
"6588150","6592290"," The bear scenario or recession scenario, and this stock goes lower. "
"6592630","6594910"," There's no ifs or buts about that."
"6595190","6597970"," But what kind of percentage probability you're putting on that?"
"6598110","6602730"," So we say one-fourth of the time the stock, you know, it could go down significantly."
"6603450","6608130"," But the other three-fourth of the time, we think the stock does very well, a double in three years,"
"6608510","6615090"," and in fact, in our bull case scenario, you know, triple over the next three to four years. "
"6615590","6620710"," So the upside, when you're trading at 60 percent, a tangible book value, and you're moving the"
"6620710","6624870"," right direction with better efficiency and returns, could be phenomenal."
"6624870","6626990"," So we're looking at it from a reward to risk ratio."
"6627330","6628190"," That looks very attractive. "
"6628650","6630470"," What is their core competency?"
"6630730","6633590"," I mean, you talked about all these businesses they're getting out of and things that they've been"
"6633590","6634350"," doing through the years."
"6634510","6635470"," What are they good at?"
"6636130","6639310"," You know, so many investors ask us, why does Citigroup exist?"
"6640030","6644550"," And by the way, I was there during the global financial crisis saying, yeah, break up, not all the"
"6644550","6645510"," banks, break up Citigroup."
"6645910","6651390"," And the way they've broken up themselves, but look, take three lines of business, services, banking"
"6651390","6658450"," and markets, that's 60 percent of core Citigroup, 95 countries around the world, 5,000"
"6658450","6664190"," multinational customers, where they're looking to deepen payments, banking and markets' market"
"6664190","6664490"," share. "
"6665010","6666370"," That's very easy to understand."
"6666670","6669190"," So the glass is at least 60 percent full."
"6669190","6673430"," The other 40 percent would be that U.S. personal banking credit cards. "
"6673690","6674250"," They're top three."
"6674870","6676970"," I'm not going to that, defending that or not."
"6677270","6679170"," But if we don't go in recession, that should be okay. "
"6679750","6681750"," And then global wealth is about 10 percent."
"6682490","6683650"," That waste be seen."
"6684070","6686090"," I think Asia is stronger than the rest of the world. "
"6686530","6691090"," But I'll take the glass, 60 percent full for a company that's trading at 60 percent of tandem of"
"6691090","6692270"," book value any day of the week."
"6692690","6693930"," Notable from you, especially."
"6694330","6699610"," Before you go, I want to ask about Morgan Stanley, a different C-suite, because Ted Pick took the"
"6699610","6704030"," helm there technically, I guess, as of yesterday, but today, first day, everybody's kind of back in"
"6704030","6704390"," the office. "
"6704950","6707850"," What are your expectations for his tenure at the top?"
"6708170","6711510"," What do you think his first priorities should be now that he's in that job?"
"6712030","6716130"," Well, I loved reading John Mac's book, you know, when he's all in."
"6716490","6719930"," And he talked about the first days of James Gorman taking over."
"6720130","6725470"," And James Gorman coming from the wealth management side really had to convince the investment"
"6725470","6727470"," bankers that he had their back. "
"6728230","6732890"," Ted Pick coming from the investment banking side really had to convince the global wealth advisors"
"6732890","6734030"," that he has their back."
"6734830","6735210"," Interesting."
"6735790","6737210"," Mike, thank you so much. "
"6737410","6737930"," Really appreciate it."
"6738090","6739030"," Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo."
"6740270","6741210"," Thanks for having me. "
"6741390","6743690"," We're going to have a look at Park, who's down great at Apple."
"6743830","6744270"," That'll be next."
"6744510","6747230"," iPhone demand, of course, as you might expect to keep focusing that report. "
"6747930","6748570"," We will break it down."
"6748670","6751510"," The stock, as you see, is down over, what is it down?"
"6751650","6752410"," Yeah, almost 3 percent."
"6752410","6757790"," Plus, New York and California, considering wealth tax, as they've had a hard time with revenues in"
"6757790","6759210"," those states, we're back at it. "
"6790180","6796220"," Brent crude oil futures down by $1 to a session low of $75.88 a barrel."
"6952280","6953560"," Barclays downgrading Apple."
"6953880","6955720"," It's now an underweight at that firm. "
"6955960","6958400"," It is the focus of today's tech check with Steve Kovac, Steve."
"6958400","6959400"," Hey there, David."
"6959520","6962260"," Yeah, Apple starting the new year with that downgrade from Barclays. "
"6962460","6963020"," Not a good start."
"6963020","6965220"," Sure, it's following about 3 percent or so."
"6965400","6967620"," And Barclays really laying out the headwinds. "
"6967720","6971420"," It's going to expect that's going to result in a tough March quarter."
"6971700","6973960"," So here's the case they lay out in the note today."
"6974540","6978100"," Calling the iPhone 15 sales, quote, lacklustre, especially in China. "
"6978160","6982920"," We know all the problems going on there and says that weakness will continue with the launch of the"
"6982920","6985040"," next iPhone, likely this fall."
"6985040","6991080"," And a UBS note also backing that up with November iPhone sales data, basically showing the same"
"6991080","6993340"," thing, a lot of weakness in the US and China."
"6993720","6998000"," Also saying no rebound in Mac and iPad demand post pandemic. "
"6998000","7002080"," The needs to fall back to those pre-COVID levels before there's recovery."
"7002420","7007700"," And then on services, we've seen growth accelerate in the last quarter or so, likely going to be up"
"7007700","7009900"," 10 percent year on year for the December quarter."
"7010160","7013720"," But that's because comps are a lot easier from a year ago. "
"7013720","7021380"," And Barclays expecting deceleration in growth in services throughout 2024 and even into 2025."
"7021440","7024580"," Now, some reasons behind that, regulatory risks."
"7024760","7028140"," DOJ is going to have a verdict pretty soon here against Google. "
"7028480","7031020"," And that puts the payments it makes to Apple at risk."
"7031480","7036380"," We all know, of course, Apple pays billions, maybe as much as 19 billion a year, to be the default"
"7036380","7038140"," search engine on Apple devices."
"7038860","7042580"," Plus, there's the Digital Markets Act going into full effect over in Europe. "
"7042580","7045000"," And that is a threat to App Store revenue."
"7045560","7049400"," That said, Barclays expecting December quarter to be in line with expectations."
"7050260","7055480"," Still though, Apple's guidance for that quarter said sales going to be flat year over year after"
"7055480","7057760"," four quarters in a row of declining sales. "
"7058100","7060180"," And as for that March quarter, the quarter are now."
"7060500","7067820"," Barclays now estimating below the consensus, hence the new price target, $160, or about 14 or so"
"7067820","7070080"," percent downside from shares are now, guys."
"7070600","7075060"," Yeah, Steve, they lead the note sort of talking about iPhone demand and saying their checks in"
"7075060","7078000"," particular are picking up weakness of iPhone volumes and mix. "
"7078220","7083220"," I'm curious, given you cover this company closely, what you're hearing in terms of demand."
"7083580","7085340"," Yeah, this is the really tough one."
"7085440","7086720"," It's all about China and the US. "
"7087000","7088600"," I mean, I asked Tim Cook about this directly."
"7089120","7091660"," I believe last earnings so about a quarter ago."
"7092000","7097120"," And he basically said, you know, smartphone demand is really tough right now in these most"
"7097120","7097980"," profitable markets. "
"7097980","7101940"," And we're not going to see enough of makeup in those emerging markets."
"7102020","7106240"," We've been hearing Apple talk more and more about Indonesia, India, and so forth."
"7106360","7110940"," It's just not enough to make up for the weakness, especially in China as things are open up there. "
"7111280","7112640"," I also forgot to mention Huawei."
"7112940","7118060"," There's a lot more competition coming online over in China because this new homegrown brand is"
"7118060","7121540"," making phones again after being out of the game for a couple of years there, David."
"7121540","7125900"," And we're seeing evidence that people are in fact switching, who had switched from Huawei to"
"7125900","7127960"," iPhone, going from iPhone back to Huawei. "
"7128540","7130440"," And that could continue throughout the years, David."
"7130880","7136720"," Yeah, you've got more competition, inflation creeping into the savings of Americans."
"7137540","7138300"," Steve Kavak, thank you. "
"7138400","7138620"," Thanks, guys."
"7138840","7139020"," The Dow."
"7139520","7143660"," Hong Kong's Hang Seng index finishing lower for the fourth straight year of the outlook for Chinese"
"7143660","7144500"," stocks is next. "
"7144840","7145460"," We're back into it."
"7360560","7362900"," Welcome back, keeping an eye on Tesla this morning."
"7362900","7369260"," The company reporting 2023 delivery numbers that came in above estimates, rising 38% year over"
"7369260","7371440"," year, bringing the total to 1.8 million. "
"7371940","7374620"," Wall Street saying the attention now turns to margins."
"7375100","7379320"," Oppenheimer predicting we'll see moderate margin improvement, considering supply chain"
"7379320","7381980"," rationalization, lower lithium costs and improved efficiency."
"7382660","7387680"," UBS saying that pricing action helped drive volume, which was margin negative. "
"7388320","7391860"," And going forward, they'll expect the Cybertruck will likely be a headwind."
"7392660","7399020"," Bernstein's Tony Secondoggy adds they believe Tesla will see lower margins and disappoint on"
"7399020","7400360"," volumes going forward."
"7402080","7404120"," China, obviously very important for them as well. "
"7404360","7405000"," China very important."
"7405120","7407880"," And BYD, the largest manufacturer now in the world."
"7408960","7412880"," Dan Ives, earlier with us, talking about 2.3 million, because Phil LeBeau had thrown it out there"
"7412880","7414040"," as a possible number for Tesla. "
"7414940","7417180"," For deliveries for 2024, we'll see."
"7417460","7420020"," You've got the, but to your point, you've got the BYD competition."
"7420500","7426160"," Also the loss of that tax credit for some of their vehicles goes into effect, Gen 1, yesterday. "
"7426580","7430140"," So we'll see what kind of an impact that has $7,500 per car."
"7430700","7433160"," It's not insignificant at all."
"7433320","7436200"," Speaking of China, by the way, let's talk a bit more about it. "
"7436280","7439080"," It's after a down year for Chinese markets in 2023."
"7439600","7445060"," President Xi Jinping warned that, quote, on the path ahead, winds and rains are the norm, pledging"
"7445060","7447140"," measures to boost growth moving forward."
"7447140","7450960"," That's after new factory activity data showed a third straight month of contraction. "
"7451200","7454980"," That was for December and the latest sign of weakness in the Chinese economy."
"7455360","7460740"," So what can we expect in the new year joining us now from Beijing, his MSA capital and core values"
"7460740","7462140"," alpha founder Ben Harberg."
"7462520","7466020"," Ben is also the portfolio manager of the Greater China Growth ETF. "
"7466260","7469800"," Ben, always good to get your take on things on the ground in Beijing."
"7470260","7472880"," And so first off, what did you make as Xi's comments over the weekend?"
"7474260","7475800"," They always try to manage expectations."
"7476700","7481020"," So they're going to always under promise and try to hit it or over deliver. "
"7481300","7486300"," And so I think that they will manage expectations going into the year because they were perhaps"
"7486300","7488100"," over exuberant last time around."
"7488820","7493460"," But I think that they'll probably end up with about a 5% growth target and they'll hit it overall."
"7494000","7495640"," They want to make sure everyone does. "
"7495880","7496740"," This is not going to be easy."
"7497300","7504360"," Yeah, I mean, you would know far better than I, that I'm not talking about companies."
"7504540","7507260"," I'm talking about individuals and the like who might invest with you. "
"7507800","7509980"," I mean, Alibaba is below its IPO price."
"7509980","7510940"," We looked at that earlier."
"7511300","7512200"," What is going on here?"
"7513440","7519320"," It's a simple example of where fundamentals are being overwhelmed by narrative, right?"
"7519660","7525460"," And we really believe there's a re-rating of historic blue chip tech companies going on right now. "
"7525480","7527560"," The likes of Baidu Alibaba Tencent."
"7527920","7530560"," These were historically proxies for the Chinese economy."
"7530560","7535840"," And so a negative China narrative will weigh them down all fundamentals aside. "
"7536180","7540700"," For instance, some like Baidu has done more hours of autonomous driving than any global competitor"
"7540700","7543400"," and that part of their business isn't even valued."
"7543620","7547960"," And so it's going to be part of the course for those big China blue chip names."
"7548460","7553520"," It's interesting, Ben, because a lot of the companies that are, you know, rumored to be looking to"
"7553520","7558960"," go public that are based in China have kind of a global bend to them. "
"7558960","7564640"," You've got Xi'an and ByteDance, just to name a few possible contenders."
"7564900","7569640"," When we look back to some of the previous Chinese companies that went public like a JD.com or an"
"7569640","7572620"," Alibaba, those were more kind of China domestic names."
"7573100","7578880"," What do you think the likelihood is that, you know, there's broad investor interest in that these"
"7578880","7583660"," names can be successful in going public given just the overall backdrop of what's going on in"
"7583660","7583840"," China?"
"7584860","7589400"," Well, ironically, the Chinese have tried to mask the fact that many of these companies are Chinese,"
"7589920","7590060"," right?"
"7590440","7593920"," So many Americans today are buying products from an application called Temer. "
"7594020","7596220"," They don't realize that that's owned by Pindul duo."
"7596820","7599840"," Many global consumers didn't know that Xi'an was a Chinese business."
"7600760","7606180"," You know, even TikTok kind of cloaked itself musically when it first launched in the U.S. And so a"
"7606180","7610900"," lot of these are kind of seeping their way into the value chain, seeping their way into the hearts"
"7610900","7611940"," and wallets of consumers. "
"7612840","7616300"," And it's become a major narrative, something we've invested in for a long time."
"7616300","7622060"," I believe Chinese, not just consumer facing electronic companies, but now that hardware realm, the"
"7622060","7628160"," likes of BYD, even the Huawei, Techno, and emerging markets, and the hardware space, Xiaomi, all of"
"7628160","7632240"," these are now huge global payers battling against their American incumbents."
"7632620","7633880"," And they've been doing very well. "
"7634220","7638200"," And they're taking on, in the case of Temer, and Xi'an, the likes of Dollar General, on Amazon, on"
"7638200","7639480"," Uniqlo, and Zara."
"7639900","7642060"," And so I think this is a major theme for 2020."
"7642520","7645080"," Yeah, Ben, you know, I'm just curious always about your business. "
"7645080","7648940"," I mean, you're making the case here that perhaps things are not nearly as bad as they would appear."
"7649520","7650840"," What are you seeing in terms of flows?"
"7651700","7654420"," You know, how many investors do you have at this point?"
"7655420","7656580"," How do you approach that?"
"7657680","7661720"," We also have the data in terms of the outflows from China over the course of last year."
"7662460","7664180"," For us, we think that's an opportunity. "
"7664480","7668800"," We think that, you know, everyone is ranked in the market and what I think are non-fundamental"
"7668800","7669140"," reasons."
"7670000","7672920"," The actual financials in these businesses are sound."
"7673120","7675200"," We've seen really kind of banded numbers. "
"7675220","7678300"," Our fund only launched at the tail end of last year."
"7678520","7680940"," We're up, you know, 3% since that point."
"7681540","7688580"," And we expect that 2024 should be a more robust growth year, given, again, how seriously the"
"7688580","7694180"," Chinese government achieved, and in his statements kind of around the impact of later, nothing that"
"7694180","7695640"," they must improve the economy. "
"7695640","7698980"," And finally, Ben, you know, I appreciate the fact that you are there in Beijing."
"7698980","7703360"," Unlike a number of managers of Chinese funds who frankly are over here, more often than not."
"7704000","7706540"," But what is it like in terms of your day-to-day there?"
"7706700","7708300"," Do you feel like you can ask tough questions?"
"7708740","7712140"," Do you have access that you need to do the fundamental research you need to do?"
"7712980","7714440"," It's freezing cold here to start. "
"7715020","7717920"," Beyond that, we feel like we do get that level of access."
"7718200","7722100"," Obviously, we have a team of a large Chinese national team of boots on the ground."
"7722100","7728660"," We're able to talk directly to managers, to the other kind of senior executives within businesses. "
"7729280","7735120"," We find that they're bad at communication, but if you dig properly, they're very happy to divulge"
"7735120","7735320"," information."
"7735800","7739780"," So we feel like we get a very clear picture, both from the companies themselves, the squares,"
"7739900","7742160"," regulators, and we've been able to navigate that effectively."
"7742380","7744940"," But as you said, it has to be done in the ground here in Beijing. "
"7746380","7747200"," Ben, always appreciated."
"7747540","7747840"," Thank you."
"7750180","7756080"," Back here at home, New York and California are considering low taxes as revenues dry up in those"
"7756080","7756440"," states. "
"7756920","7759640"," Robert Frank is back with us here on the floor."
"7760620","7761520"," What are they discussing?"
"7761920","7764840"," And why are revenue tax revenues?"
"7765080","7767020"," So the markets were strong last year."
"7767300","7768120"," Equity markets were strong. "
"7768240","7768760"," We've been talking about that."
"7768940","7773660"," But the IPO market deals, buyouts, private equity, all that stuff, just cratered."
"7773660","7779600"," So capital gains income where California and New York derive a lot of their revenue just crashed. "
"7779920","7783700"," And so California is now looking at a budget deficit of $68 billion."
"7784240","7786600"," That is by far the largest deficit they've ever had."
"7786880","7791440"," New York looking at $4 billion for this coming fiscal year with the migrant crisis probably adding"
"7791440","7793320"," another $12 billion over the next three years. "
"7793780","7797380"," So the question that they have, which they didn't think they would have so quickly after the"
"7797380","7800560"," pandemic, is do we cut spending or do we raise revenue?"
"7800560","7805060"," They've tried to cut spending, but these are both progressive states with progressive legislatures."
"7805760","7809540"," So the legislatures of both states are saying we want to raise taxes on the wealthy."
"7809880","7813960"," California and New York both starting this time, which is unusual, with wealth taxes. "
"7814360","7818120"," So not taxing income, but taxing in New York's case unrealized gains."
"7818600","7822260"," So that's if you had a stock run up last year, but you didn't sell any stock, and you have"
"7822260","7827200"," income of let's say more than $450,000, New York will look to maybe tax that."
"7827200","7832780"," California looking at a billionaire's tax, taxing about 1% and 1.5% of total wealth. "
"7833220","7834080"," Who's looking at this?"
"7834240","7835720"," I mean, is Kathy Hocha looking at this?"
"7835860","7840640"," She seems to be a little more pro-business, the governor of New York, perhaps than others, or is"
"7840640","7841160"," the legislature."
"7841600","7843800"," I'm just trying to understand how likely this has to actually happen."
"7844280","7849060"," Not likely both governors, Governor Hocha and New York and Governor Newsom in California, have said"
"7849060","7853620"," we can't lose more wealthy taxpayers to Texas and Florida, which we have been doing. "
"7853620","7857280"," And the fact that there is even debate about whether the wealthy are leaving, just shows these"
"7857280","7859980"," legislatures are gung-ho on doing this."
"7860160","7865400"," Now, remember, Andrew Cuomo said we will never tax the wealthy, the legislature kept pushing, and"
"7865400","7870720"," finally he conceded in 2021 to raise that top rate in New York State to 10.9%, which means the"
"7870720","7873440"," combined for New York City is over 14%."
"7873440","7878740"," So again, the governors can push back, but they may be in a position, again, with deficits that"
"7878740","7882240"," large to eventually cave on some kind of tax increase. "
"7882240","7887920"," Yeah, the unrealized gains, that seems like a slippery slope in terms of getting pushed back."
"7888460","7888900"," Absolutely."
"7888900","7890260"," It almost seems illegal, right?"
"7890400","7891420"," Wasn't there a potential for it?"
"7891680","7895780"," Well, there is a Supreme Court case more versus the United States, which will determine in some"
"7895780","7899840"," respects whether the 16th Amendment allows for a wealth tax. "
"7900140","7905000"," If the Supreme Court shuts that down, it will be harder, not impossible for the states to do it."
"7905300","7909060"," The bigger issue for the states is, you know, if you have a wealth tax in one state, it's very"
"7909060","7910480"," easy to move to another state."
"7910480","7913140"," If you're going to do a wealth tax, it has to be federal. "
"7913380","7916680"," And so it's going to be hard when that Supreme Court ruling comes this year."
"7916780","7921540"," That's going to be the most important tax case in a century when we get that ruling."
"7922080","7924980"," And Elizabeth Warren and all the tax wealth people will be watching that close. "
"7925200","7926000"," All right, I'm going to watch it close."
"7926100","7926580"," Yeah, me too."
"7926940","7930240"," A hundred billion dollar New York City budget, over 200 billion for New York State. "
"7930940","7934220"," Just New York City is bigger than Florida or around the same size of the budget."
"7934780","7935360"," Robert, thank you."
"7935480","7935720"," Thank you. "
"7935820","7937340"," That's it for us right here on Money Movers."
"7937600","7938520"," Let's go over to the Halftime Report."
"7940960","7941620"," Hi, David. "
"7941760","7941860"," Thanks."
"7941980","7942840"," Welcome to the Halftime Report."
"7942960","7946340"," I'm Scott Lopner, front and center this hour of the year ahead for stocks, whether the best trade"
"7946340","7948140"," of 2023 might be at risk. "
"7948640","7951140"," We will ask the investment committee, making some moves today too."
"7951260","7952920"," You need to hear about joining me for the hour."
"7953320","7956300"," Josh Brown, Liz Young, Joe Chernova, and Steve Weiss. "
"7956600","7956980"," Check the markets."
"7957260","7958520"," We are mostly lower."
"7958860","7960460"," Dow has turned green though. "
"7961000","7964120"," Vicks up, yields up, oil up."
"7965080","7967940"," Some of last year's biggest winners are today's biggest losers."
"7967940","7973500"," Guys, I'm talking about the likes of NVIDIA up better than 200 percent last year down today. "
"7973960","7974940"," Meta up huge."
"7975500","7981060"," Royal Caribbean, Uber, Carnival, AMD, Polti, Palo Alto, for example, all lower."
"7982240","7984400"," I feel like Weiss, we come into this year. "
"7984800","7987720"," The big question is whether it's time to trim across the board."
"7988480","7993500"," After this massive run that we had from November, Kramer this morning said trim across the board."
"7993920","7995120"," I don't care how great it is. "
"7995120","7997960"," There has to be some discipline on the mega caps."
"7998140","7999600"," Maybe it's time for them to cool off."
"7999740","8000260"," They're up so much. "
"8000280","8001660"," Multiple are out of whack."
"8001820","8004880"," I look at you today and I see that you've trimmed both Meta and Microsoft."
"8005700","8006240"," I have. "
"8006600","8011040"," And look, my views on those particular equities have not changed at all."
"8011680","8014260"," The positions got almost irresponsibly large."
"8015000","8019240"," I mean, candidly, they were over 40 percent of portfolio because of the growth we've seen them. "
"8019740","8024980"," And while I would never get that large in names that don't have the underlying fundamentals and"
"8024980","8030200"," don't have the core values, the intrinsic values companies, I just didn't believe we're going to"
"8030200","8030900"," have the same experience."
"8030900","8032680"," I still think they'll outperform this year."
"8033200","8038260"," But the degree that they did, you know, I don't think they'll do it this year. "
"8038500","8042900"," Now, I actually sold them on Friday and a couple others which we'll go through because I think"
"8042900","8044420"," everybody had the same idea as me."
"8044660","8046260"," Joe and I were talking about it last week."
"8046620","8048820"," And I said, you know what, in January, I'm going to pay her back. "
"8049240","8051960"," But that's what everybody wanted to do."
"8051960","8056880"," So I took a look at, basically, you put enough taxes for investors for a year."
"8057220","8061080"," Then you've got the value of money as, you know, like, what's that worth?"
"8061220","8062100"," What's the trade-off worth?"
"8062640","8064560"," So I just thought, look, let me trim them. "
"8064780","8066980"," They're now positions that I'm comfortable holding."
"8067620","8070040"," And I don't see myself selling anymore."
"8070460","8075060"," I don't view them as overvalued, particularly with the fundamentals that they still have and what's"
"8075060","8075700"," in front of them. "
"8076020","8077600"," So I wouldn't sell for the sake of selling."
"8077860","8079600"," I wouldn't sell them down from core positions."
"8080140","8082200"," But I just thought it was prudent to take some off the table. "
"8082380","8086960"," But do we, Josh, do we agree with Kramer that in terms of, you know, the mega caps, they were"
"8086960","8087640"," up so much."
"8088440","8089640"," And you can love all the names."
"8089900","8093780"," I mean, they're, they're not like you're throwing shade on any of the names or the fundamentals"
"8093780","8094640"," behind it. "
"8094860","8100880"," But when an apple's up near 50% and Microsoft, you're 60, alphabet, same, Amazon, 80, NVIDIA and"
"8100880","8106600"," Meta, as you know, up just astronomical gains of last year, are the multiples now in his words out"
"8106600","8107020"," of whack."
"8107020","8110060"," Do you agree with that and is it time to trim across the board?"
"8110520","8114020"," You can't argue that apple is cheap based on its own history."
"8114500","8114840"," You can't. "
"8115060","8118340"," That's not the, I don't hear any apple bull saying the stock's cheap here."
"8118700","8120160"," That's not the argument for owning it."
"8120280","8122960"," The argument for owning it is you've got a ton of stability. "
"8123600","8127240"," You've got just insane in dollar terms amounts of cash flow."
"8127620","8129360"," You've got the ability to buy back stock."
"8129680","8135240"," And you have this wild card where when they launched the wearable, if it turns out that that's the"
"8135240","8139780"," dawn of a new era of, of hardware, maybe a lot of people who have been out of the name"
"8139780","8141220"," will have to take a second look at it. "
"8141480","8142740"," That's the bull case for apple."
"8142940","8143780"," The bear case is simple."
"8144200","8149240"," It's a 32 L.E.P.E. a 27 forward P.E. Look back over the last 10 years at"
"8149240","8149720"," average is 18. "
"8150300","8152160"," So it is almost double."
"8152720","8154480"," It's long term average, multiple."
"8155000","8158140"," And it's really easy to make the case to watch this point. "
"8158500","8162020"," Hey, I don't know the taxes anymore for last fiscal year."
"8162020","8163460"," Calendar rolls over."
"8163840","8165100"," Maybe I'll take some off today. "
"8165620","8168320"," And the downgrade, I think, was perfectly timed to coincide with that."
"8168600","8171380"," And I would also argue, you know, welcome to the new world."
"8172120","8177540"," And in the new world, the activity of retail buying and selling almost doesn't matter in terms of"
"8177540","8178920"," day-to-day moves in the market. "
"8179260","8182180"," What moves the market is basically three categories of things."
"8182760","8185660"," Number one, RIA's, the Wealth Management Channel."
"8186060","8192780"," It's 15,000 firms now managing a record, 114 trillion with a T dollars. "
"8192820","8195660"," And what do they do at the start of every year?"
"8196180","8201240"," The centralized CIOs who control that amount of money, they do a rebalance."
"8201559","8202860"," And what do you think they're going to do?"
"8203379","8206080"," The NASDAQ went up twice as much as the S&P last year."
"8206440","8210620"," That's an obvious trim of NASDAQ, maybe add of Dow. "
"8210980","8212559"," And I think you're seeing that play out."
"8212840","8216600"," Look at lifecycle funds, another $3 trillion bucket of assets."
"8216600","8218320"," What do you think they're doing?"
"8218500","8222320"," They're doing these same kinds of year-end rebalancing going into the new year. "
"8222879","8226000"," The other category, I think, is worth pointing out, 401k assets."
"8226559","8232180"," You'll see a lot of the large 401ks automatically do these types of rebalancing trade."
"8232520","8236160"," So it's not a shock after one of the best years ever for NASDAQ. "
"8236680","8239340"," We see NASDAQ names a week on the first day of the year."
"8239760","8244020"," People put off paying the taxes and rebalancing is happening system-wide."
"8245340","8248500"," The CNBC's MAG-7 index was up 107%. "
"8248500","8252020"," The tech sector, 56%, best year since 09%."
"8252879","8257459"," You did have the Apple downgrade, which we'll get to in a second, but the broad view of trimming"
"8257459","8262559"," winners and maybe looking at laggards, which is how this day seems to be setting up as we start 24."
"8264120","8267540"," I think there's a couple of things going on today in particular and maybe that will play out"
"8267540","8268040"," through the week. "
"8268520","8273940"," The narrative at the end of 2023, almost for the entire fourth quarter, was year-end rally, year "
"8273940","8278580","-end rally has legs, will continue, and then in January and February, maybe it conks out."
"8279020","8280680"," And that narrative drives people's behavior."
"8280959","8285120"," Steve sort of made this point before, if everybody else is going to start selling in January, well,"
"8285200","8288379"," I might sell too, just so that I don't end up on the wrong side of that. "
"8288780","8294980"," And then think about all of these names, just to make it general, if a name is up 130%, let's"
"8294980","8301700"," say somewhere between 100 and 130%, is that stock, is that company 100% better than it was a year"
"8301700","8301940"," ago?"
"8302280","8307700"," Or was that driven largely by a rate move, by inflation falling, by the environment that we're in,"
"8307780","8313360"," by the macro forces, in which case the fundamentals might be okay, the company is still healthy,"
"8314040","8319860"," maybe has growth potential, but it's prudent, as an investor, to take some profits and just do,"
"8319920","8324540"," even if you're doing a manual rebalance, rotate into the stuff, if you're bullish, that you think"
"8324540","8329540"," hasn't kept up and make sure that you're deploying into things that still could win for 2024?"
"8329900","8334299"," In terms of multiple expansion, not all megacaps are created equal either."
"8334860","8335959"," Joe, let's be clear."
"8336700","8344660"," Yes, a year ago, Apple's forward PE was 20, today it's 28, Microsoft was 23, today it's a little"
"8344660","8350879"," over 30, Alphabet's was 17, it's a little over 20, and Metas was 15, it's a little over 19, because"
"8350879","8355820"," it came from the worst year ever in 22 to its best year ever in 23. "
"8356459","8361860"," However, Amazon for example a year ago was at 46 times today, it's 41, NVIDIA people look at and"
"8361860","8368020"," say, oh my gosh, look at what the stock did, multiples actually come in, it was 34 times a year"
"8368020","8369660"," ago, and today it's 24 times."
"8370180","8371260"," So what do you do with those?"
"8371740","8378920"," I think what you do with those is you analyze how you own these names, and you say to yourself,"
"8379299","8386240"," can I expose myself from a risk standpoint to what happened this morning between six o'clock and"
"8386240","8393240"," six 35, and that's the Apple note drops, the S&P futures from six o'clock to six 35 declined"
"8393240","8397140"," 36 handles, because Apple's 6.9 of the S&P 500."
"8397600","8400600"," Since we mentioned it down great twice, hold your thought just for two seconds, let's just make"
"8400600","8404320"," sure everybody knows what we're talking about, it's Barclays today downgrades it to underweight. "
"8404320","8408760"," They say it's time for a breather, it's the crux of the kind of conversation that we're having"
"8408760","8411880"," right now, the target goes down a dollar to 160 from 161."
"8413320","8417700"," Yes, they've had these consecutive quarters of declining revenue growth, so people are questioning"
"8417700","8421560"," where the fundamentals are relative to where the multiple has grown to."
"8421760","8424760"," To Josh's point, you're well above the 10 year historical average. "
"8425240","8425420"," Absolutely."
"8425520","8429020"," So just to get that on the table, everybody knows what we're specifically talking about what is"
"8429020","8429020"," downgrades."
"8429020","8434600"," And it's absolutely fair to look at the valuation, which Josh and everyone on the show has already"
"8434600","8440080"," cited and understand the valuation is certainly richer today than it was one year ago. "
"8440260","8441540"," And what do you have to your benefit?"
"8441820","8449060"," You have to your benefit that fundamental conditions at the end of 2023 lined up in a way where you"
"8449060","8456360"," could talk about broadening out and rotating away from the magnificent seven, not rotating away in"
"8456360","8461200"," terms of ownership, but rotating away in the degree in which you own these names."
"8461200","8466760"," And I think what's very clear at the end of the year and coming into today is that it's a"
"8466760","8467360"," crowded trade."
"8467780","8469760"," We know it's a crowded trade, the magnificent seven. "
"8470040","8473120"," You're not going to capture 107% again in 2024."
"8473840","8478600"," So you study a portfolio and you say to yourself, okay, how do I want, I want to continue to"
"8478600","8482840"," own these names, but to what degree do I want to own these names?"
"8483100","8487700"," And I think it's without question, it's fair to say to yourself they're richly valued and it's a"
"8487700","8488660"," right time to trim them."
"8488660","8489020"," So what are you saying?"
"8489340","8492680"," Trim just a couple of percent across the board. "
"8493000","8498820"," I don't want to say that's the point that Kramer was making today when David asked him, you know,"
"8498840","8500280"," so what do you mean Trim across the board?"
"8500380","8501300"," How much are we talking about?"
"8501480","8501720"," Ten percent?"
"8501980","8502640"," No, no, no, no."
"8502800","8504280"," Not ten percent, maybe a few percent."
"8504660","8505760"," That's a great question. "
"8506060","8513700"," And the response I have to that, as someone that is managing a fund, is do not be afraid, do"
"8513700","8516960"," not be afraid about what happened last year."
"8516960","8524980"," See, because last year, if you did not have the 6.9% exposure to Apple, you underperformed in 2023."
"8525320","8526600"," All right, 2024 is here. "
"8527020","8527500"," I don't care."
"8527780","8532660"," I'm not increasing my exposure to 6.9% and Apple."
"8533160","8536380"," And I'm not going to try and mirror the S&P 500. "
"8537060","8542840"," I'm going to try and deploy capital in a way that identifies where's my risk exposure first."
"8543380","8548480"," And to me, the risk exists in the Magnificent Seven having an extreme value."
"8548480","8549640"," I don't can't accord today. "
"8549920","8554100"," Liz comes out and says that select mega caps have room for multiple expansions."
"8554480","8560240"," So, you know, they're not looking at the list that we said and saying, wow, these are well above"
"8560240","8563580"," five of the seven or whatever are well above their historical average."
"8564320","8566120"," Maybe it's time to peel those back. "
"8566260","8566680"," They're saying no."
"8566680","8573660"," Now, we think that Metagool and Amazon can, um, their multiples are reasonable and they could"
"8573660","8574200"," expand further."
"8574880","8575340"," Sure. "
"8575600","8581740"," And stock picking will probably continue to be the technique of choice in 2024."
"8582220","8586380"," When you talk about it, though, as a broad group and think about just multiples, we know this."
"8586500","8586920"," I've said this. "
"8587140","8588740"," I'm sure on this program multiple times."
"8589780","8591400"," Pe's are a terrible timing mechanism."
"8591680","8594160"," You don't use them to decide whether or not you're going to buy yourself today. "
"8594160","8599160"," What they are good at is looking out over a ten year time horizon and saying that if the PE"
"8599160","8603840"," is really high relative to its own history, relative to its industry group, it suggests that"
"8603840","8607260"," returns in the next five to ten years are going to be muted."
"8607520","8609720"," Doesn't mean they're going to be negative, but they'll be muted."
"8610180","8614600"," So if you're looking for something that's going to outperform the broader group, you do want to be"
"8614600","8619960"," careful about the ones that are very obviously stretched, very obviously crowded, or very obviously"
"8619960","8622340"," dominating a broader market move. "
"8622340","8626620"," I mean, why Stan Ives today says NASDAQ 20,000 is his bull case."
"8627140","8630580"," He thinks the tech could be up 25% in 2024."
"8631240","8633760"," Now, that sounds tremendous. "
"8635120","8638880"," If only compared to this past year where they were up 50%."
"8638880","8645360"," But what about that optimism is for a back to back out."
"8645520","8648200"," I mean, I think 25% would end up being outperforming. "
"8648200","8655480"," Look, let's put a respect of right now, you know, yes, the stocks had a phenomenal year in 23."
"8656100","8658320"," But they had an horrendous year in 22."
"8659100","8663060"," So a lot of that move was a reversion to the means of the normal PE's. "
"8663300","8668420"," Now, if you look at the historical PE's of both Meta and Microsoft, there's slightly elevated, no"
"8668420","8668780"," question."
"8669100","8671820"," It's not unprecedented territory, particularly from Microsoft."
"8672500","8676220"," But I don't see the market being up 25%. "
"8676220","8679840"," And that's basically what you'd have to see for tech to be up 25%."
"8679840","8681640"," I think it's going to be kind of a muted year."
"8681960","8686180"," I don't think the debate personally is settled about whether we're going to recession or not. "
"8686420","8688600"," I don't believe there are going to be six cuts."
"8689240","8693480"," I still think inflation should be somewhat stubborn unless we have a recession."
"8693960","8700480"," So bottom line is I think we're in, you know, maybe, you know, an eight to 12% return the"
"8700480","8706120"," market, which means that given the waiting and Josh looks at this all the time, so it'd be great to"
"8706120","8712500"," get his view, the waiting of those making caps stocks is still going to dwarf with the rest of the"
"8712500","8712700"," market. "
"8712760","8716020"," That's why, look, the Dow's at the highs of the day."
"8716260","8718620"," Russell's gone marginally positive."
"8719120","8721560"," S&P waited down because the Nasdaq's getting. "
"8721840","8722580"," No, absolutely."
"8723100","8723320"," Absolutely."
"8723880","8724400"," Which is my point. "
"8725020","8729860"," So I still think that group, you know, will get to this, but I still think that group will"
"8729860","8730720"," outperform."
"8731060","8734240"," I just don't see the big forms because I don't see the aversion to the means."
"8734240","8734800"," I'm wondering. "
"8735160","8740140"," I think it's important to point out why these stocks have gotten the premium that they've gotten."
"8740620","8742480"," And Apple is a really great case in point."
"8742920","8745040"," Apple was not always an expensive stock. "
"8745660","8750460"," In fact, if you look at the period from the great financial crisis up until COVID, if you stripped"
"8750460","8752100"," out the cash, it was like, what?"
"8752340","8753080"," It's eleven, nine."
"8753320","8754360"," I think I kind of was blind."
"8754640","8755280"," It was 12 times earlier. "
"8755880","8757200"," It was low double digits."
"8757520","8758380"," So you have this period."
"8758720","8759620"," So you have this period. "
"8759900","8760760"," You have post GFC."
"8760760","8764360"," Let's start that in like 2009, heading into the pandemic."
"8764400","8766760"," It's about eleven years stock average, sixteen times earnings. "
"8767380","8770820"," There were people making the case that it was expensive, by the way, during that period of time."
"8771280","8775820"," Obviously, in hindsight, you know, it wasn't because they delivered far in excess of anything that"
"8775820","8776380"," we ever thought."
"8776900","8779880"," Any quote unquote hardware company could actually do. "
"8780300","8785640"," Especially when they started to de-emphasize hardware sales in their quarterly reporting and tell"
"8785640","8786420"," you about services."
"8787080","8787720"," Okay, that was then."
"8787720","8790420"," Here's now the post COVID period. "
"8790900","8793140"," Apple is averaging twenty nine times earnings."
"8793720","8794640"," You look at every quarter."
"8795040","8800220"," It all of a sudden got re-rated after COVID and has never reverted back. "
"8800260","8804900"," In fact, there was one quarter traded at forty one times earnings December of 2020."
"8805620","8812140"," So all of a sudden we've decided that Apple's average PE is should be, I'm saying we, the market"
"8812140","8815380"," should be double what it was in the previous period."
"8815600","8816420"," Why is that?"
"8816420","8819780"," I think the answer is consistency of profits. "
"8820280","8826740"," Apple's profit margins have been remarkably consistent in this last four year period, almost no"
"8826740","8827980"," matter what you threw at the company."
"8828280","8835640"," Problems with China, problems with supply chains, problems with competitive, it almost did not"
"8835640","8836140"," matter."
"8836540","8842940"," And that's why we value those services at higher levels than we would just value ordinary mobile"
"8842940","8843580"," phone sales. "
"8843580","8847240"," Margins grew at a five percent keger over that period of time."
"8847940","8851360"," Twelve quarters, you only saw two of those with contraction."
"8851900","8855100"," That means margins were rising almost every time they reported. "
"8855820","8860940"," If you think that that materially changes this year, then you could argue for Apple to be re-rated"
"8860940","8861300"," downward."
"8861860","8866020"," If you don't think that changes this year, I think there will be stability in the stock."
"8866700","8869180"," It's not going to do performance wise what it did last year. "
"8869460","8872660"," I think that's the most reasonable take to have."
"8872660","8877720"," But there's no reason to think all of a sudden it's going to take a nosedive just because the"
"8877720","8878440"," calendar rolled over."
"8878600","8882860"," So Joe, if we think that there's going to be a reversion and some of these lagging sectors are"
"8882860","8887060"," going to be where the money's going to go, at least initially as we sort of put the wheels to"
"8887060","8892400"," the ground in the new year, eight of 11 S&P sectors underperformed the market. "
"8892780","8894460"," Eight in 2023."
"8894840","8897600"," The only ones that outperformed tech, comm services and discretionary."
"8898140","8901080"," You have industrial materials, financials, real estate. "
"8901080","8903260"," Now they were all positive, they still underperformed."
"8903860","8908120"," Real estate, healthcare was flat, staples, energy, utilities down."
"8908760","8912380"," Do we see big pickups in those lagging areas?"
"8913020","8915900"," I see a catch up more than anything else. "
"8916100","8921780"," Look, if we're talking about another year in which all I needed to do was own seven stocks to"
"8921780","8926180"," outperform the S&P and to look like an NVP superstar."
"8926180","8931660"," Okay, I'm going to have to live with that environment because that's just not the way I believe"
"8931660","8935500"," that you address a portfolio and you assume the risk."
"8936000","8939980"," I think owning seven stocks and concentrating in that direction is something that Warren Buffett"
"8939980","8940440"," could do. "
"8940540","8943500"," And he could do it really well because he's got the financial firepower."
"8944200","8949760"," But I think the most important thing did happen in the fourth quarter with what we heard from the"
"8949760","8956240"," Federal Reserve and the relief that's being indicated towards areas of the market that were reliant"
"8956240","8962740"," on the cost of capital and that cost of capital continuing to be a moving target was restrictive to"
"8962740","8963180"," those companies."
"8963480","8967880"," So I think you embraced the broadening out that we saw at the end of the fourth quarter. "
"8968260","8973500"," I don't think you have exuberance towards it and say to yourself, okay, to Josh's point and to"
"8973500","8975640"," Steve and Liz's point, you forget about Apple."
"8975980","8976720"," I'm going to own Apple."
"8977160","8978520"," I'm going to own Alphabet. "
"8978880","8979760"," I'm going to own my business."
"8979760","8982060"," This is not a conversation about sell out."
"8982340","8982440"," Right. "
"8982560","8983700"," It's about trim power."
"8984020","8984120"," Correct."
"8984560","8990640"," And I've said, I believe that you can and should be trimming here because I think from a technical"
"8990640","8992720"," perspective, more than anything else. "
"8993380","8995540"," Okay, forget the valuation argument."
"8995840","8996480"," I agree with Liz."
"8996640","9000800"," I don't think valuation is a good indication of where something might or might not be going. "
"9001260","9003120"," But technically, you're talking about stocks."
"9003420","9004500"," Look at these semiconductor stocks."
"9004500","9009180"," The semicocks are 20 to 30% above their 200 day moving average. "
"9009640","9012500"," Historically, the sweet spot is 11 to 15%."
"9012500","9012860"," Right."
"9013060","9016420"," And the space itself, the SMH had its best year in 20 years. "
"9016780","9017060"," Correct."
"9017340","9017820"," In 2023."
"9018340","9018980"," 20 years. "
"9019280","9026000"," And I have no issue with someone looking at that and saying, okay, let's reduce the size of our"
"9026000","9026280"," holding."
"9026700","9027940"," I did exactly that."
"9028300","9032720"," I sold out of some of my Broadcom several weeks ago along with Uber and JP Morgan. "
"9032720","9037760"," I'm comfortable that a lot of people do that and what's so funny and what's frustrating for the"
"9037760","9037960"," bears."
"9038540","9042840"," Once they do that, they might sit in cash for a couple of days and then they say, all right,"
"9042960","9043520"," what else do I buy?"
"9044100","9046720"," And yeah, they could go buy a small cap value stock."
"9047180","9052500"," They could go buy an $800 million publicly traded thrift bank. "
"9052900","9054900"," How am I going to sit in that stock when it doesn't do anything?"
"9055500","9062260"," So these names get revisited later on when people say, all right, I tried the broadening out trade."
"9062260","9063580"," I bought some other stuff."
"9064020","9065480"," I picked up some biotechs. "
"9065640","9067680"," They don't have a phase three thing for nine months."
"9068020","9068640"," What am I doing?"
"9069000","9072900"," They go right back into the same 50 names that we've been talking about for the last year."
"9073000","9075240"," But there's a I think that that's what the first quarter is going to look like. "
"9075360","9078840"," But there's a simple exercise to to alleviate that concern."
"9078840","9079520"," And it's simple."
"9079580","9081040"," You say to yourself, I'm selling out of something. "
"9081420","9082660"," Okay, what am I doing with the cash?"
"9082920","9083720"," Where am I moving into?"
"9083980","9085300"," What exactly am I buying?"
"9085520","9087600"," I know what I bought that when I sold out of those."
"9087600","9092720"," That's exactly what I wanted to discuss with Weiss because if we mentioned lagging sectors like"
"9092720","9095960"," health care, which did nothing, you sold out of Humana."
"9096640","9097560"," Yeah, I sold it. "
"9097680","9100940"," So part of my question, I want to know why, but what are you going to do with the cash?"
"9101540","9102920"," Yeah, I mean, look, I sold."
"9103860","9106320"," I want to take some losses against the gains."
"9106860","9107180"," Humana. "
"9107400","9111900"," I went into his trade, as you recall, and as part of your profitable health care trade, which you"
"9111900","9113740"," were trying to ride for much of us here."
"9113740","9116800"," So I sold Humana on Friday as well, so I missed the move today."
"9117140","9119320"," So, you know, you can't can't catch them all. "
"9119720","9121640"," But I haven't sold any United Health Care."
"9122300","9125240"," And, you know, my intention is to come back to Humana."
"9125600","9130640"," But first, I want to see what happens with we're in a very highly charged political environment. "
"9130940","9134320"," It typically is a discussion during presidential campaigns."
"9134520","9138120"," Health care typically underperforms in a general election year for that very reason."
"9138440","9143520"," Both sides are just teeing off on the drug companies and about prices that set in the other. "
"9143520","9148220"," And that's why those companies traditionally don't do well from a stock standpoint in two years."
"9148220","9148220"," Exactly."
"9148220","9150940"," But I think some of that underperformance, frankly, was pulled forward. "
"9151460","9152640"," The marks move a lot quicker."
"9152920","9154160"," They discount a lot sooner."
"9154860","9157520"," And it's been no secret they underperformed the election years. "
"9157960","9159500"," But there are no positive catalysts either."
"9159760","9162480"," And then you've got to see a mess which, who knows what to do with rates."
"9162720","9163360"," So I thought it was prudent. "
"9164100","9166740"," Bottom line is that it was a loser in the portfolio."
"9167680","9168160"," I had gains."
"9168700","9170260"," So how am I going to manage that?"
"9170580","9171880"," So that's why I sold it. "
"9171880","9173560"," I also sold deer."
"9173920","9175160"," Deer was a profitable trade."
"9175580","9176820"," But that was just a trade. "
"9177020","9178200"," I was very clear when I went in."
"9178480","9179160"," It did very well."
"9179320","9182900"," Deer has been trading between like 370 and 400. "
"9183640","9184920"," So I caught it."
"9184980","9185960"," I've caught it each time."
"9186440","9187900"," And I want to get out of it. "
"9188140","9192800"," I don't believe that's because I don't believe the economy is as strong as it is in the market."
"9193180","9195240"," And so I want to take that profit off."
"9195420","9197220"," So I just thought I want to miss that. "
"9197360","9198060"," It's up a little bit today."
"9198060","9200580"," So I just want to rebalance the portfolio a little bit."
"9200880","9203020"," I didn't want to wait until everybody else is doing it. "
"9203580","9205340"," Okay, so that just gives me the option now."
"9205440","9206960"," So I'm simply with a lot of cash right now."
"9207180","9208180"," I do intend to play. "
"9208320","9212300"," But if you take a look where I put some money to work, I did buy Taiwan semi."
"9212720","9214000"," That informed the other semis."
"9214440","9216340"," I'm sure I'm nervous about what Chinese are going to do. "
"9216440","9218220"," I don't think they're going to do anything this year or next year."
"9218500","9219800"," They keep the dialogue going."
"9219800","9221560"," I also bought Transdyne. "
"9221800","9225220"," I bought Textron about a week in change ago."
"9225740","9229900"," So, you know, those to me, the fundamentals are strong and they've been strong."
"9230360","9236000"," And they don't depend on the economy really accelerating and they don't depend on rates, right?"
"9236140","9237220"," Those are fundamental buys. "
"9237560","9240700"," Textron private jet market still going very strong."
"9240860","9242840"," It's not going to weaken Transdyne."
"9242900","9246120"," As I mentioned the other day, it's 48 separate companies. "
"9246120","9249000"," It's a private equity firm that trades in the public markets."
"9249300","9253480"," You said, you know, moments ago when we were talking about the market outlook for this year, you"
"9253480","9254720"," expected it to be muted."
"9254980","9259080"," I think that's the word that you use last year, but still historically, basically in line. "
"9259360","9262580"," Well, I mean Oppenheimer goes 5400."
"9263020","9267520"," They think this is now we're starting year two of this new bull market cycle."
"9268020","9271480"," And they call that target, quote, probable and even conservative. "
"9273780","9275100"," That's aggressive to me."
"9276140","9280480"," I think, you know, it probably assumes, I don't want to put words in their mouth, I would imagine"
"9280480","9285160"," it assumes that a lot of the strength that we see right now, both in economic fundamentals and a"
"9285160","9290300"," lot of the price strength that we see in these bigger sectors can continue and will continue."
"9290820","9294600"," And there are a lot of contradictions going on, not only in the market, but in a lot of the"
"9294600","9296100"," economic projections that are happening. "
"9296100","9301740"," If we're expecting six cuts starting in March, that is supposed to happen at a time when the Fed"
"9301740","9304560"," doesn't even expect inflation to be at target by the end of the year."
"9304900","9306540"," It's hard to understand the math of that."
"9306900","9312360"," And then the math of earnings growth being 11% when GDP growth is supposed to be below trend for"
"9312360","9313200"," a period of time. "
"9313220","9318920"," The Fed is surprised on both ends of the economic and inflation spectrum as it is now, right?"
"9319080","9321640"," They didn't expect it to be down to where it is."
"9321640","9324980"," And they didn't expect the economy to be up where it is."
"9325540","9330700"," So what their own projections are, sort of, you could take a little bit with a grain of salt. "
"9331120","9336640"," Trend would suggest that inflation is coming down fast enough for them to cut multiple times this"
"9336640","9339800"," year, whether it's four or five, six or what have you."
"9340020","9344320"," And then you also, if you think we're going to get the 5400, think that the soft landing trade is"
"9344320","9345440"," definitely happening."
"9345440","9346360"," But here's the thing. "
"9346800","9348500"," If inflation comes down, that's great."
"9348820","9351880"," If we get inflation lower than the Fed even thinks that's great."
"9352960","9358660"," The idea of stocks getting up to 5400 or even beyond would suggest that the economy is still pretty"
"9358660","9359020"," strong. "
"9359280","9362260"," If the economy is still pretty strong, labor market stays tight."
"9362660","9363960"," GDP growth is stronger than expected."
"9364400","9365360"," They're not going to cut six times. "
"9365840","9369880"," And right now the market is trading on the idea that cuts start in March and continue at a steady"
"9369880","9370180"," pace."
"9370180","9375000"," If inflation comes down close to target, they will, because I think they've made it clear at this"
"9375000","9378760"," point that they care more about inflation than they do the strong economy."
"9379020","9383220"," They stop talking about the economy being too strong. "
"9383480","9388600"," It's more like, well, we left you with the idea, Chair Powell, at the last meeting that's solely"
"9388600","9389900"," focused on inflation now."
"9390100","9392920"," They don't want to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory."
"9393600","9394020"," Right. "
"9394560","9398360"," And if it does come down to target, they have more room to start talking about cutting."
"9398560","9402780"," I still don't think six is going to happen in that case, because in that case, GDP growth is"
"9402780","9403020"," stronger."
"9403660","9408220"," And the point that he made in the last meeting was, all it does is if the economy stays stronger"
"9408220","9410880"," than we expected, just lengthens this process out. "
"9411120","9413660"," It makes it more difficult for us to declare victory."
"9414020","9414680"," It takes longer."
"9414960","9417000"," It doesn't necessarily cause a problem, but it takes longer. "
"9417000","9419360"," In which case, I think you see cuts get pushed back."
"9419500","9419800"," Real quick."
"9419860","9423940"," And if you take a look, the market conditions have eased, right?"
"9424100","9425860"," So it's eased from the Fred number one. "
"9426220","9427520"," Number two, just to give you the..."
"9427520","9428540"," In a good way, though, right?"
"9429020","9433140"," No credit issues in the market that credit spreads are really, really tight."
"9433740","9433800"," Right."
"9434140","9435900"," But I just want to put my portfolio perspective. "
"9436280","9440260"," I'm still going to participate, given my holdings in Meta Microsoft."
"9440260","9440420"," off."
"9440540","9441280"," I haven't shaved Amazon. "
"9441740","9444820"," I haven't shaved alphabet because they're big positions."
"9445380","9447320"," So they're not in as big positions as the others."
"9447660","9450580"," So I'm still going to participate, but I do have cash in the blood. "
"9450780","9452360"," So let's squeeze in a quick break."
"9452680","9454640"," We've got some new ideas for your portfolio as well."
"9454960","9456080"," Got a number of calls today. "
"9456360","9459020"," Committee positions are at play and we'll do those next."
"9611300","9612360"," Store or Android."
"9612720","9615300"," A bunch of calls today on committee stock. "
"9615460","9616240"," So let's start with Uber."
"9616800","9618260"," Price target raised at Wells Fargo."
"9618260","9619900"," Top pick 2024 Josh. "
"9620080","9625160"," They go to 74 from 64 stocks at a huge run as you know and talked about our numerous occasions."
"9625960","9630120"," Yeah, look, I think this is one of the last great TAM stories."
"9630580","9635320"," If the viewers remember three three to five years ago, we were obsessed with Tams. "
"9635600","9641020"," We would talk about these companies with huge valuations and huge growth and we would wonder, well,"
"9641020","9642120"," how big could this get?"
"9642420","9648460"," Like maybe this is in some way justified and we found out for most companies, it was not justified."
"9649100","9650280"," But for some, it really was."
"9650800","9657140"," I, my bet this is one of those companies where the TAM opportunity justifies the stock trading"
"9657140","9659960"," significantly higher in the next year or two. "
"9660420","9667220"," I genuinely think mobility, whether we're talking about freight or people or moving food, delivery,"
"9668140","9670380"," whatever you know, whatever category within mobility."
"9671460","9673800"," Uber is number one in most markets."
"9673980","9675700"," In some markets, it's number two. "
"9676100","9676920"," It already dominates."
"9677000","9682180"," It has no real competition and you're talking about like the last trillion dollar TAM."
"9682540","9687260"," You also happen to have one of the best chief executives of any tech firm anywhere in the world. "
"9687960","9692260"," Dara deserves a lot more credit than he's getting for the turn rounds here."
"9692600","9694660"," This is maybe one of the best turn rounds of the decade."
"9695180","9701320"," I think we'll look back and say, wow, that thing maybe could have looked like lift if not for some"
"9701320","9703200"," of the incredible moves that management made. "
"9703660","9704680"," And it was not the founder."
"9705040","9707660"," He came in and cleaned up a mess before turning it."
"9707800","9709500"," So I think the stock goes higher. "
"9709920","9710540"," I'm not selling."
"9710840","9712880"," I'm holding and let's hope I'm right."
"9713080","9718260"," Weiss, I know you, I know you don't you don't disagree with the total address will market idea that"
"9718260","9719340"," Josh puts forth. "
"9719460","9724440"," You just look at plus 138.5% gain in the stock last year."
"9724500","9725040"," You trimmed it."
"9725240","9726020"," I did trim it. "
"9726100","9726860"," So it's still a position."
"9727340","9728780"," It was never a core position."
"9729960","9731560"," I just don't think it's compelling. "
"9731760","9734160"," Now that you look at over a couple of years, it gets cheap."
"9734380","9734420"," Right."
"9734720","9739700"," It's going to be trading on a forward multiple two years out in the 20s, which is not expensive. "
"9740000","9741820"," Dari is one of the best CEOs out there."
"9742100","9742600"," I agree."
"9742800","9743840"," And I've said that multiple times. "
"9743840","9747140"," Make up the capital return story that the analyst is putting out there."
"9748300","9749580"," It makes sense."
"9749700","9753760"," I mean, if I'm back, so I'll buy back a lot more stuff by that is 20% of this"
"9753760","9755980"," market cap in by 2026. "
"9756040","9756520"," Right."
"9757260","9759420"," That's become the base case for analysts now."
"9759720","9759780"," Yeah. "
"9759960","9762940"," So it's something Dara's whisper to them told them that's what we're going to do."
"9763200","9764120"," And that'll support it."
"9764400","9766880"," But it's also a question of the bait in my portfolio. "
"9767180","9769620"," So again, this is a portfolio management decision."
"9770160","9771880"," I'm going to perform just as well."
"9772240","9776280"," If I believe what goes on with meta with Microsoft, maybe not today. "
"9776460","9778240"," But that's not doing so great either."
"9778420","9779260"," So I like it."
"9779380","9783340"," It's also got more consumer exposure than I'm really interested in. "
"9783500","9784840"," I don't believe in the freight story."
"9785420","9790600"," You know, we've done a lot of work on freight and freight that has to be extremely reliable."
"9791080","9793020"," And the Uber drivers are not the most reliable. "
"9793080","9798400"," Number one, number two, you want to know your partners on a day to day basis, not get a new"
"9798400","9798760"," partner."
"9799140","9803060"," So I actually think they'll probably exit freight rather than build a business there."
"9803340","9805200"," I took a little bit of profit in this name. "
"9805360","9806560"," But I disagree with you."
"9806600","9811220"," I think first of all, as it relates to the consumer, the consumer, this is almost essential to the"
"9811220","9814080"," consumer, both professionally and personally now."
"9814360","9820620"," This is a company that has absolutely reversed an awful culture with the founder. "
"9821000","9825760"," This is a company that now has established itself in a position where you're talking about free"
"9825760","9826400"," cash flow generation."
"9827220","9832920"," And I think the last thing that a lot of people sometimes forget is if if you are a portfolio"
"9832920","9839420"," manager and you're dedicating capital to particular sectors, where else in the industrial sector,"
"9839600","9841960"," can you find three year revenue growth at 40%?"
"9842320","9845520"," The industrial sector over the last three years, revenue growth is 8%."
"9845520","9847520"," This is an industrial name. "
"9847660","9848900"," It's in the industrial sector."
"9849400","9851320"," And it's giving you 40% revenue growth."
"9851720","9857860"," That alone is a magnet for portfolio managers to look inside the industrial sector and say, I want"
"9857860","9858280"," to be there. "
"9858440","9858980"," That's a growth name."
"9859040","9860860"," Do you see, but I don't look at things like that."
"9861020","9861900"," You look at things like that. "
"9862080","9864200"," You might not look at what's a sector."
"9864440","9866020"," What's my weighting the sector going to be?"
"9866800","9867200"," I understand that."
"9867200","9868160"," I'm not criticizing it. "
"9868220","9869240"," It's a legitimate way of doing it."
"9869340","9870220"," It's just not how I run."
"9870400","9871200"," I look, but I'm so fundamental. "
"9871840","9872460"," I look at it."
"9872460","9877000"," But I acknowledge there is a tremendous amount of capital that does identify those types of assets"
"9877000","9877880"," without a doubt."
"9878100","9878660"," I think it's misplaced. "
"9879000","9880260"," It's really a technology company."
"9880860","9881800"," It's an industrial company."
"9881940","9883700"," I think it's consumer discretionary. "
"9884800","9887220"," It is a transport."
"9887860","9888680"," That's why it's an industrial."
"9889080","9889940"," Obviously, it's transportation. "
"9890640","9892490"," It also obviously is a tech company."
"9893030","9895750"," But I think, look at the actual usage."
"9896410","9898550"," That is consumer discretionary writ large. "
"9898850","9900810"," That is a consumer saying, hey, you know what?"
"9900910","9901850"," I feel like having a few drinks."
"9901850","9902650"," Let's Uber home."
"9902990","9904290"," Which is one of the reasons why I sold it. "
"9904410","9906070"," Because I think travel comes down."
"9906250","9908250"," I don't think we're going to be a big travel like we've been."
"9908770","9911290"," So the consumer, look, their prices have gone up. "
"9911810","9913930"," And I just think the consumers could be more cautious."
"9914550","9919650"," Speaking of travel, then, booking an Expedia Joe, you own both, upgraded at Wells."
"9920850","9922150"," These are stocks again. "
"9924030","9926430"," Booking is up 73% last year."
"9926930","9928490"," Expedia 69%."
"9928490","9929830"," Technically overextended. "
"9930010","9930930"," I will acknowledge that."
"9931350","9935490"," benefited from a summer travel season that defied expectations."
"9936590","9939910"," 2024 bookings growth of somewhere around 4% to 5%. "
"9939910","9944070"," If that is achievable, the fundamental story remains in place."
"9944630","9948110"," Does the market work off some of those technically overbought conditions?"
"9948250","9951450"," Wouldn't be surprised in the least bit as well as with Airbnb."
"9952570","9952850"," All right. "
"9953070","9954510"," Let's get the headlines now with Bertha Coombs."
"9954690","9955010"," Hey, Bertha."
"9955190","9955650"," Hi, Scott. "
"9956050","9961870"," South Korea's opposition leader was stabbed in the neck today, but by an unidentified attacker."
"9962430","9967170"," He was torn the side of a proposed airport when a man lunked forward with a knife."
"9967710","9969570"," The attacker was arrested at the scene. "
"9969570","9975210"," And the opposition leaders said to be recovering in the hospital with injuries to his jugular"
"9975210","9981990"," police are reporting no evidence of terrorism in the fatal New Year's day crash in Rochester, New"
"9981990","9982330"," York."
"9982870","9989570"," The driver sped toward pedestrians in an SUV full of gas canisters and collided with another car."
"9990070","9992470"," Two people were killed and several more injured. "
"9993110","9997730"," Officials said the suspect died Monday night from injury sustained in the crash."
"9998690","10003150"," And Wanka ended the year in the top spot at the box office."
"10003490","10009690"," The musical starring Timothy Chalamet collected an estimated $24 million over the New Year's"
"10009690","10014530"," weekend, bringing its total domestic earnings to more than $142 million. "
"10015190","10022370"," Box office sales in 2023 reached $9 billion, which is a post pandemic best."
"10022770","10025070"," No doubt helped by Taylor Swift."
"10025070","10027310"," That was everything an entertainment last year. "
"10027390","10027590"," Scott."
"10027890","10028250"," Yeah."
"10028470","10028970"," All right, Bertha. "
"10029090","10029350"," Thank you."
"10029650","10030790"," Bertha Coombs up next Bitcoin."
"10031190","10036530"," Breaking out to start the new year will one of 2023's best performing actually be best performing"
"10036530","10037290"," asset class. "
"10037890","10039390"," Have an encore in 2024."
"10039710","10040790"," We'll debate it next."
"10187870","10194930"," Opec out Kurt Rose, 48,000 pounds per day last month to 26.53 million pounds per day. "
"10204960","10208560"," Protect your trades from macro headline risk with the M."
"10208560","10208700"," E."
"10209460","10209460"," C."
"10209460","10213640"," I were back on the half Bitcoin breaking out to start the new year."
"10213980","10218080"," So with the best performing asset class of 2023, see even more gains in 2024."
"10218700","10220400"," Let's get to Kate Rooney now for our report. "
"10220500","10220760"," Hey, Kate."
"10221160","10221780"," Hey, Scott."
"10221960","10222500"," Yeah, that's a big question. "
"10222800","10223840"," So Bitcoin's new bull run."
"10223960","10226460"," It's being driven by two potential catalysts."
"10226580","10227700"," So hope for an ETF approval. "
"10227840","10231200"," And then something called the having coming up this spring."
"10231360","10237980"," So for that long-awaited ETF, the SEC now has a January 10 deadline to approve or reject the Cathie"
"10237980","10239820"," Woods arc and 21 shares application."
"10240320","10244480"," Reuters though reporting that the SEC could notify issuers as soon as this week on that. "
"10244600","10248940"," Then there are dozens of applications out there, including from heavy hitters like Fidelity and"
"10248940","10249440"," BlackRock."
"10249660","10253060"," If approved an ETF could lower the barrier to entry to buy Bitcoin."
"10253340","10257720"," So some are arguing that that would bring in a wider range of investors and then potentially more"
"10257720","10258680"," institutional interest. "
"10258880","10263040"," Others now say that the upside may have already been priced in at this point."
"10263180","10266480"," Then you've got something called the Bitcoin having in April."
"10266500","10269440"," That's where the new issuance of coin gets cut in half. "
"10269740","10270660"," Hence the name having."
"10270840","10273320"," It's a way to keep a cap on Bitcoin's supply."
"10273680","10278040"," And the other driver for Bitcoin, Scott, is the same thing driving tech, falling interest rates,"
"10278300","10281140"," and then some of the return of risk appetite among retail investors. "
"10281540","10281940"," Back over to you."
"10282120","10283460"," Yeah, let's talk to some retail investors."
"10283800","10285280"," Hey, Rooney, thank you very much for that report. "
"10285340","10286980"," Weiss, you've been long Bitcoin?"
"10287420","10287620"," Yep."
"10287840","10288960"," So what about now?"
"10289320","10294080"," Well, this one I trimmed also on Friday, you know, a day too early."
"10294080","10296460"," Look, I don't believe in Bitcoin. "
"10297120","10300100"," I still see no use case, no end market for it."
"10300320","10301460"," It's just a speculative market."
"10301640","10302120"," But that's fine. "
"10302560","10303420"," I'm just not a believer."
"10303760","10306300"," If I were a believer in Bitcoin, I wouldn't have shaved it."
"10306680","10308500"," So I basically cut it almost in half. "
"10308800","10311400"," And the reason I did was I think the news is priced in."
"10311780","10316260"," So you get the approval for the ETF and then it may be selling the news because I'm not the"
"10316260","10319400"," only one that bought an expectation of ETF approval."
"10319800","10323600"," And that's been the move from 28,000, which is roughly where I bought it. "
"10323640","10326880"," I bought it almost all of it under 30 to where it is now."
"10327260","10331340"," Now, the other issue that I had with it is that what if it doesn't get approved?"
"10331420","10332640"," Well, I was thinking that what if it doesn't?"
"10332860","10334140"," What if it doesn't get a surprise?"
"10334140","10336560"," And then then it's toast for a while."
"10336900","10339420"," So it'll recover because they're just true, believe it's driving. "
"10339860","10342180"," And the third thing is you don't need an ETF."
"10342460","10348920"," An ETF is great from multiple positions, but you can buy this, you know, Bitcoin now be a crypto"
"10348920","10349240"," ETF."
"10349560","10352740"," But as far as Bitcoin goes, it's very easy to buy. "
"10352960","10354560"," You buy with no commissions on fidelity."
"10355240","10356060"," You buy a raw move."
"10356220","10357080"," You can buy it everywhere. "
"10357700","10360640"," So I don't know what an ETF does for Bitcoin itself."
"10360900","10362820"," Now, doesn't it theoretically open it up?"
"10363120","10363400"," It does."
"10363760","10366840"," It does because people so used to buy ETFs at this point. "
"10367100","10370080"," It brings in more demand for without a doubt."
"10370380","10375260"," But my point is that I just thought it was prudent for a non-believer to take a lot off"
"10375260","10376020"," the table and book."
"10376200","10384760"," The last big approval quote unquote that everyone was waiting for was futures. "
"10385400","10387260"," And that ended up being a negative catalyst."
"10387480","10389560"," That actually was the top in 2017."
"10389980","10393680"," December of 2017 in Chicago, they started trading futures on Bitcoin. "
"10394360","10397060"," A lot of people in the lead-up were saying, Oh, this is so bullish."
"10397560","10400120"," Actually, that enabled a new level of price discovery."
"10400680","10403580"," They shorted it to hell and it collapsed to 11,000. "
"10403860","10409400"," So just because we have this catalyst in front of us, doesn't guarantee all of a sudden there's"
"10409400","10411500"," going to be this buying bonanza and there won't be sellers."
"10411980","10415600"," There'll be plenty of people utilizing the ETFs to express bearish bets."
"10416100","10418580"," I think those will be overwhelmed in the opening weeks. "
"10419320","10420140"," But I agree."
"10420340","10421320"," A lot of this is price then."
"10421420","10423760"," And by the way, this ain't even going to be that great of a business. "
"10424360","10426060"," BlackRock Infidelity will carve it up."
"10426420","10429380"," It'll probably be 25 basis point business inside of 18 months."
"10429840","10435240"," This is not going to be 1% ETF internal expense ratios as far as the eye can see. "
"10435500","10436880"," And there aren't going to be 10 winners."
"10437480","10441880"," And the only evidence I have of that is 30 years of publicly traded ETFs."
"10442100","10443240"," There are not 10 spies. "
"10443880","10446440"," There are not 10 oil ETFs."
"10446680","10449800"," There are not 50 different versions of the gold ETFs."
"10449800","10450220"," They're not 10. "
"10450220","10457640"," But just in full disclosure, I may sell the rest of it before that January 10 deadline."
"10458240","10458780"," I just don't know."
"10458900","10459400"," I'm still thinking. "
"10459660","10464520"," One of the reasons why the futures failed the way they did is because the extreme volatility didn't"
"10464520","10468660"," marry itself with what the clearinghouses were going to do on margin requirements."
"10469080","10474760"," So the margin requirements on the Bitcoin futures were so extremely high, you had people that"
"10474760","10480120"," weren't able to utilize the futures market in a way in which they could leverage positions like"
"10480120","10483140"," they do with bonds or agriculture or oil."
"10484020","10490260"," The clearinghouses really did a good job in managing the risk and the volatility and placing a"
"10490260","10492640"," strong barrier to entry using margin. "
"10492980","10494300"," Let's let's squeeze another break in."
"10494480","10496240"," We do have bank earnings to look ahead to."
"10497000","10498540"," A lot of love for Sydney today. "
"10498860","10503320"," We're going to talk about that as we look ahead to earnings and what the street is saying about the"
"10503320","10505460"," stocks they like the best back after this."
"10672090","10673030"," B dot com."
"10674770","10675270"," All right. "
"10675390","10677350"," Let's talk some banks because we are looking ahead to earnings."
"10678150","10681970"," I said Liz a lot of love for city today, which we can do specifically separately."
"10682350","10686810"," But what about this group which we said was up 10% last year. "
"10686930","10687430"," It's green today."
"10687990","10689070"," It's green today as well."
"10689390","10692470"," So it's part of that is money going to go into other areas trade. "
"10692950","10694370"," I think it is part of that."
"10694450","10695830"," I like financials as a whole."
"10696230","10700050"," And when you look at some of the things that obviously happened last year, they lagged the broader"
"10700050","10702250"," market positive year but lagged the broader market. "
"10702270","10704990"," So the rotation trade is a bit of a tailwind."
"10705430","10710530"," But then thinking through even the first half of 2024, if things go as we expect or as the market"
"10710530","10716310"," expects, front end of the yield curve comes down as rates start to fall and as the Fed cuts rates."
"10716550","10720390"," But if the economy doesn't falter terribly, you've still got a cyclical trade that's intact. "
"10721010","10724330"," You've got the front end of the curve coming down, maybe a resteepening of the yield curve."
"10724330","10726170"," So net interest margin does better."
"10726650","10726930"," That's right. "
"10727130","10727730"," For the banks of that."
"10727750","10728970"," City is kind of its own story."
"10729490","10730330"," They've done a lot. "
"10730430","10731190"," Let me just read these two."
"10731250","10732610"," I'll let you riff on that."
"10733430","10734530"," Mayo over at Wells. "
"10735330","10739290"," We expect City to double to 100 plus over three years."
"10740270","10743410"," Raises the price target to 70 bucks from 60 reiterates overweight."
"10744050","10746310"," Bank of America names a top pick for Q1. "
"10746930","10747330"," Yeah."
"10747690","10751750"," If you know people that work at City, you know, they have five bosses and they are the boss to"
"10751750","10753750"," five wrongs below them."
"10753910","10755090"," They just had this bloat. "
"10755590","10759030"," All banks do, but really a legendary amount of bloat."
"10759490","10760490"," And they're cleaning it all up."
"10760630","10763990"," And it took a few generations of new CEO, new CEO, new CEO. "
"10764310","10768910"," But now finally, it looks like they're actually cutting into what they should have been cutting"
"10768910","10770010"," into all this time."
"10770350","10772230"," And it's probably not popular internally."
"10772670","10776850"," And if you were a shareholder, you're not necessarily like rooting for people to get laid off, of"
"10776850","10777090"," course. "
"10777550","10780070"," However, there was overhiring."
"10780430","10784210"," They were in too many businesses where they were number three or number four in that business."
"10784570","10785890"," You just can't afford to do that anymore. "
"10786230","10788690"," It's a very competitive world, very competitive sector."
"10789190","10792590"," So they're doubling down on things they're good at getting out of the things they're not good at."
"10792770","10794490"," They're reducing head count. "
"10794930","10800490"," And I think ultimately, they have a chance to distinguish themselves from the other big five or six"
"10800490","10808050"," banks for the first time in years because of how extreme this overhaul has become an extreme in a"
"10808050","10808450"," good way."
"10808450","10810810"," So I haven't really followed the stock closely."
"10811390","10816230"," But now I'm starting to because I'm liking how the fundamental news is matching up with the"
"10816230","10816470"," technical. "
"10816670","10822490"," Unless Weiss, you know, this ends up being the catch up year, let's just say for a Goldman and a"
"10822490","10828650"," city, which were outperformed by, at least from a stock standpoint, things like JP Morgan, which"
"10828650","10834610"," was up 27 and a half percent, you have Goldman and there's optimism as certainly from you and"
"10834610","10837010"," others about that stock going forward."
"10837010","10838430"," And then city is in that group too."
"10838750","10838990"," Yeah. "
"10839370","10848070"," So Goldman, I mean, it's had a nice, you know, last quarter as the calendar opened up and I do"
"10848070","10848530"," think it will."
"10848670","10851870"," Still, most bankers I talked to believe it'll be the second half of the year."
"10851910","10853350"," Like capital markets, Cal, you're talking about. "
"10853470","10854630"," So IPO, secondaries."
"10855270","10857590"," And of course, M&A will pick up as rates come down."
"10857990","10860210"," In terms of city, think about what Jane Fraser did. "
"10860590","10865290"," The easiest thing for her to have done would have been to come in there, right, as soon as she"
"10865290","10867590"," started and saying, we're going to cut this."
"10867930","10871690"," Efficiency stories are not just about meta and big cap tech."
"10872070","10873330"," It's also about every business. "
"10873650","10876670"," But what she did was, she said, I'm going to take a very measured approach."
"10877270","10879890"," I'm going to really learn about these business strategically."
"10880550","10884430"," I'm going to decide which are important to us and which are important to us. "
"10884570","10885350"," We're too bloated."
"10885790","10886970"," I'm going to cut back on that."
"10887470","10888770"," So that's what she did. "
"10888950","10894920"," So she's to be she's to be commended for taking a very, very critical eye to the business over a"
"10894920","10896900"," long term, rather than knee-jerk reaction."
"10897480","10898360"," So he's seen it."
"10898520","10899700"," That's why Farmer Jim loves that stock. "
"10899940","10901080"," That's why it's the one."
"10901400","10901500"," So I do too."
"10901780","10902500"," And I made that. "
"10902660","10907640"," And one of her key lieutenants is a guy I know very well, Tyler Dixon, who runs banking, all of"
"10907640","10908240"," them got some banking."
"10908660","10909320"," And he's phenomenal."
"10909940","10914660"," He's one of the best from the street and also is himself a very good strategic thinker. "
"10915220","10916640"," So I think it's a good story."
"10916640","10919940"," I'm sorry it's moved up because my intention is to buy it."
"10920360","10922600"," And you know, I still will. "
"10922920","10924100"," I'd like to sell back a little."
"10924240","10924400"," All right."
"10924600","10928480"," So up next Mike Santoli, he joins us with his first Midday Word of the New Year. "
"10928860","10929420"," We'll do it next."
"11086100","11086840"," To learn more."
"11088420","11092320"," Senior Markets commentator Mike Santoli with his first Midday Word of the New Year, Happy New Year"
"11092320","11093420"," to you. "
"11093660","11098880"," And today really tees up the question of this early part of the New Year, whether you're going to"
"11098880","11103780"," see continued selling and mega caps and the big winners in some of the buying of the perceived"
"11103780","11104080"," losers."
"11104520","11109680"," Yeah, it seems almost a little bit too tidy that we see it's so stark continuing like it is today."
"11109880","11113280"," It seems like a little bit of a of a first day of the tax year shake out. "
"11113280","11114500"," So I'd like to see how it develops."
"11114700","11119860"," My main working premise is I doubt this year is going to be quite as stark about either it's the"
"11119860","11123220"," seven or it's the 493 either it's the mega caps or it's the small caps."
"11123480","11124580"," But we'll see how that goes. "
"11124580","11126080"," The other thing is pretty encouraging."
"11126080","11130720"," You've gotten some internal bid in the market over as over the course of the morning."
"11130940","11136120"," So clearly people didn't take the weakness in the biggest stocks to say that somehow the tone has"
"11136120","11136800"," changed overall. "
"11136800","11140940"," Yeah, I mean just seeing the the VIX, which was up I don't know 13 14%."
"11140940","11144540"," That's the fever's come off a tiny bit there."
"11144840","11146720"," Russell had some buying there. "
"11146900","11150620"," It's up a quarter of a percent or so and you have some money moving to the Dow."
"11150880","11152600"," So about half the sectors in the S&P are up."
"11152840","11158060"," Yeah, so it was a little bit moving the VIX there. "
"11158180","11161060"," But that stuff sounds like static in my ears."
"11161300","11166320"," But yes, you have you did have that kind of after a big long holiday weekend effect a little bit"
"11166320","11166560"," of a bit."
"11166720","11167600"," So it's wait and see. "
"11167760","11168080"," I'm just interested."
"11168320","11171500"," I'll see yields really do have any lift to them."
"11171640","11172860"," We're so far it's a modest move. "
"11173040","11176000"," You were confused that you thought I said percentage move in interest rates."
"11176220","11177400"," Yeah, exactly."
"11177400","11178500"," Your other pet beef. "
"11178960","11181560"," I'll see how closing bell like Santoli finals are next."
"11498700","11502360"," We're going to kick this market around on closing bell three o'clock each and I hope you'll join me"
"11502360","11508880"," then Dan Greenhouse Lauren Goodwood and then one of the biggest bulls of 20 23 John Mary is back"
"11508880","11509960"," with his look ahead for stocks."
"11510800","11512180"," I'll see all that in a couple hours. "
"11512200","11513080"," All right final dates."
"11513320","11513820"," Mr. Weiss."
"11514600","11518240"," Transtime for the reasons that I said is just a steady form should do well in this market. "
"11518540","11519100"," Okay, Joey Keith."
"11519320","11521040"," Goldman Sachs looking very attractive to me."
"11521640","11522660"," Really interesting. "
"11523140","11523300"," All right."
"11523320","11524800"," Looks like the veal palm on Christmas Eve."
"11524980","11525260"," Liz Young. "
"11525560","11529940"," Yeah, financials for the same reasons I already mentioned plus some M&A activity pickup."
"11530180","11530620"," All right, Josh."
"11530880","11532640"," Joe destroyed to me by saying veal palm. "
"11533820","11533880"," Paypal."
"11535620","11536220"," Look at it."
"11536380","11536580"," It's green. "
"11536980","11537680"," All right, what's that for love?"
"11537760","11538300"," All right, good stuff."
"11539000","11539480"," I've done it."
"11539700","11543280"," Keith says the Fed is definitely keeping the top landing. "
"11544740","11545680"," Thank you, Scott."
"11545960","11546860"," And welcome to the exchange."
"11546900","11547820"," Happy New Year. "
"11547960","11549500"," I'm Kelly Evans and here's what's ahead."
"11549960","11553740"," Rising rates are pressuring stocks again and putting that historic wind streak in jeopardy."
"11554120","11559300"," The 10-year yield briefly back about 4% this morning and our strategist says higher for longer is"
"11559300","11560460"," still very much in play. "
"11560980","11563100"," Will rates spoil the party in 2024?"
"11563100","11566100"," And if so, why is crypto shrugging it off today?"
"11566540","11566920"," Will debate?"
"11566920","11570920"," Meanwhile, rising tensions in the Red Sea pushing oil prices higher overnight."
"11571280","11573960"," Shipping giant mares says they'll continue to avoid the area."
"11574400","11576680"," Are we on the brink of a multi-front war in the Middle East?"
"11577020","11582280"," Atlanta Council CEO Fred Kemp weighs in plus Barclays downgrading Apple to sell. "
"11582640","11584560"," It's now the fourth firm with a bearish rating."
"11584920","11587900"," We'll tell you why is the stock drives on the whole tech sector today."
"11588100","11591420"," But first, let's start with the market action and Dom Q has the numbers. "
"11591740","11592020"," Hi, Dom."
"11592200","11592460"," Hi."
"11592600","11593080"," Happy New Year. "
"11593220","11596340"," Kelly decidedly more negative for certain parts of the market than others."
"11596580","11602100"," But the down parts of the market to the real downside are the leaders from 2023."
"11602320","11606120"," So specifically the NASDAQ composite, which was the outperformer among the major three indices. "
"11606760","11613280"," The composite index at 14,000, 70 down 240 points, 1.6% to the downside there."
"11613380","11616540"," So again, tech comm services really the laggard so far today."
"11616940","11620600"," Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is down about 25 points, one half of 1%. "
"11620600","11622940"," Those technology stocks weigh there as well."
"11623120","11626620"," But it's generally a little bit less severe here for the S&P 500."
"11626840","11629700"," And by the way, we're right in the middle of the trading range so far today. "
"11629840","11636120"," And the down industrials outperforming up about one quarter of 1%, 65 points to the upside, 37,755."
"11636980","11642680"," The key mover in the S&P 500 today has been one of the biggest underperformers over the course of"
"11642680","11643320"," the past year."
"11643720","11648300"," We're talking about biotechnology from Moderna, most known for their COVID vaccines, mRNA"
"11648300","11648860"," technology. "
"11648860","11655820"," Well, it's up 14% today, making it by a factor of almost three, the best performing stock in the"
"11655820","11656500"," S&P 500."
"11657060","11661280"," After analysts at Oppenheimer upgraded that stock, put another price target upgrade on that thing"
"11661280","11666200"," saying that basically COVID vaccine sales are showing more visibility down the line and more"
"11666200","11668900"," products coming out in the next few years will help Moderna's bottom line."
"11669100","11671100"," So Moderna shares up 14%. "
"11671100","11674480"," But remember, on a one year basis, still down about 37%."
"11674480","11676560"," And then the interest rates that Kelly mentioned."
"11677100","11681240"," It's important to kind of show you some context on where we've been, where we are right now, the 10 "
"11681240","11688660","-year note yield currently at 3.95%. As Kelly mentioned, we briefly ticked above 3.4% at some point. "
"11689040","11691140"," But remember, the cycle highs up here, 5%."
"11691140","11693500"," We've been under pretty decent downtrend ever since."
"11693740","11700680"," So even with this move, though, it's still a rates-driven story for 2024, just like it was in 2023. "
"11700960","11705080"," We'll see if the Fed and when it cuts becomes a huge ratio down the line, Kelly, I'll send things"
"11705080","11705720"," back over to you."
"11705860","11707140"," All right, Dom, thank you very much."
"11707200","11712040"," Dominic Q, stocks are sitting on huge gains on expectations of deep rate cuts this year. "
"11712480","11715720"," But my next guest, say the Fed, may not be as aggressive as investors think."
"11716060","11718660"," Joining me now, Greg Daco is Chief Economist at UI."
"11719280","11723180"," And Jordi Vissar is President and Chief Investment Officer at Weiss Multi Strategy Advisors. "
"11723340","11724100"," Welcome to both of you."
"11724400","11725320"," Jordi, welcome to the program."
"11726480","11731280"," I don't want to jump too far ahead here, but I know that you're a big fan of Bitcoin and"
"11731280","11732660"," crypto in some of those asset classes. "
"11732900","11734980"," And this is definitely the day to talk about it."
"11735220","11738940"," Before that, though, maybe just explain why you don't think the fact that the tenure went back"
"11738940","11744020"," above 4% today has, I mean, why is that happening at the same time that crypto is taking off?"
"11744160","11746680"," Or are these just kind of January 1 positioning quirks?"
"11747580","11750000"," Yeah, I'd like to see it go down there too."
"11750160","11754640"," I really want to see it go down there mostly to clear the boards. "
"11754980","11756900"," You know, I'm not really completely bearish here."
"11757620","11764200"," I am into March, but I'd really like to see just a reset here."
"11766520","11776420"," Now, if you look over here, if it happens, if it does happen, here's your it has four o "
"11776420","11777020","'clock right here. "
"11777020","11780820"," So you got to get underneath this previous low."
"11787260","11790540"," I can see this little bottoming action right here, right?"
"11790780","11794020"," Now you might get your V shape, but it'd be nice to get underneath here."
"11794960","11800820"," You get underneath here for the close, slam it down into 4 p.m. at that at that S3. "
"11801940","11805820"," And then, you know, like maybe on the open on Tuesday, you don't turn around."
"11805940","11808020"," Don't forget that turn around Tuesday, right?"
"11808260","11811500"," You get that bloodbath down to the daily trigger."
"11812000","11815340"," You wake up Tuesday morning, and it's a fresh start for the week. "
"11816140","11819560"," And you can buy though, buy the dip for the for this week."
"11820460","11823480"," Not really like ultimately bearish like doom and gloom."
"11823800","11825700"," It's going to take the quarter. "
"11825700","11830160"," If you are doom and gloom, it's likely going to take some time to get down there."
"11830260","11832480"," You're talking, you know, three months here, got another, you"
"11832480","11855070"," know, two and"
"11855070","11855630"," a half Yeah, I know."
"11855790","11857130"," I know stocks only go up. "
"11857910","11860550"," You know, I want only, I do want stocks to go up."
"11860690","11861450"," I want us to go up there."
"11861570","11863910"," I really want to see us to truth is here. "
"11864270","11867830"," I really want to see SPX nail that all time high."
"11868070","11868750"," We got it on ES."
"11869030","11869750"," We got it on spy. "
"11870750","11871590"," So it's there."
"11872270","11876290"," A little bit of the idea here too is if you're a bull, right?"
"11877150","11879430"," Think about this from the sense of logic."
"11879670","11884930"," If we get the all time high on SPX, we likely sell, right?"
"11885270","11890290"," So a little bit of cooling off, give some room to make it worth going up there to get that"
"11890290","11891630"," all time high on SPX. "
"11892430","11897550"," So if we do get a roll down, you know, you guys know what I'm talking about here."
"11898370","11903990"," You got some people out there that'll push you telling you, we get the all time high, but SPX"
"11903990","11907710"," number going to 6000 by March 1st, right?"
"11908210","11911390"," The reality is there'll be some kind of exiting at that point."
"11913130","11915030"," So or exiting the market at that point. "
"11915210","11922330"," So just be like, if you're a bull out there, just have some spatial awareness as to when does that"
"11922330","11922850"," cell come?"
"11922990","11923570"," Does it come today?"
"11923690","11926150"," Does it come in a few weeks or whatever?"
"11934770","11935410"," Yeah, yeah."
"11935550","11939130"," Today's Tuesday technically, but it really is tomorrow."
"11939150","11941650"," You have a shortened week of training. "
"11941670","11946250"," So you've got turn around to Tuesday, what the fuck Wednesday, it all gets compressed into a four"
"11946250","11946730"," day period."
"11947390","11953350"," So that would be the idea behind waking up tomorrow and seeing more down in the morning."
"11963080","11964260"," What's that you're saying there?"
"11964500","11966740"," I want to see all time highs and proper fake out. "
"11967260","11969480"," Ideally, to suck all the SPX 500."
"11970760","11973680"," Yeah, I don't think you're getting the 3500 this year."
"11975220","11980600"," You it's possible, but you the mechanics are not on your side for that to happen. "
"11981320","11987920"," You're more than like what which you see this report, but the history is not on your side to see"
"11987920","11989080"," that 3500."
"11989740","11998780"," And not only the 3500, but a lot of the chance of that even coming is if you are bearish,"
"11998780","12001460"," 38 is a very high probability."
"12002540","12008240"," If you want like the law of probabilities, you lost 3500 recently. "
"12009260","12010580"," So you're higher now."
"12010720","12017120"," You're likely more around that 38 to 3900 for if you even get that low."
"12018520","12024040"," But even when you do, you need the mechanics of you need the bounce off 2% inflation. "
"12025100","12028140"," You need the unemployment rate running up to four to six percent."
"12028740","12031800"," You need cuts for even that action to take place."
"12033620","12037400"," So you really do need that mechanic to take in. "
"12038100","12042480"," It's possible, but you need some stuff on your side or something unknown to the marketplace."
"12043440","12047960"," But as far as the bulls, you know, like the bulls, the thing that makes me scratch my head here"
"12047960","12053100"," with the bulls is, you know, they want up today and the first day of trade and day of the"
"12053100","12053340"," year."
"12054340","12057520"," And they want to tag that all time high in SPX. "
"12058000","12063160"," But you're going to get an auto, an algorithmic auto sell the moment you do."
"12063320","12070560"," So if you're a bull, you are looking for that all time high in SPX with for where we are"
"12070560","12077100"," at this moment, it would not surprise me to see some kind of a pullback to get that all time"
"12077100","12084800"," high or a failure of a brief like tick below the all time high to get up there and do"
"12084800","12084920"," it."
"12085060","12091360"," And usually you want for that run, it's like 150 point pump pullback, 150 point pump pullback,"
"12091580","12093020"," something more like that. "
"12094160","12094980"," We didn't get it done, right?"
"12095120","12096220"," We didn't get it done in December."
"12096780","12103000"," So I would expect another, another need for a pullback to get up there and get it done."
"12124440","12130580"," Now if you are feeling frisky, if you are feeling bearish out there, you do want to see that break"
"12130580","12133360"," of the daily trigger and then you want to see the rejection. "
"12134000","12135900"," You want to see that blood and that doom gloom."
"12137040","12139800"," You want to see price break that daily trigger, right?"
"12140040","12141240"," You see that but daily trigger break."
"12141260","12147440"," And then if you see, you know, two failures by bulls to recover and then our starts to cross below"
"12147440","12152720"," that daily trigger, we'll start a correction and we'll really put some some gas on there. "
"12152860","12154460"," Let's take a look at both really quick."
"12156260","12163160"," So the idea here would be get price down here, right?"
"12163640","12164340"," Blast down."
"12164880","12166420"," Here's that daily trigger, right?"
"12167500","12174420"," You want the rejection, one, two rejections, get that hourly coming down, pick up the cluster and"
"12174420","12185650"," then you can really start talking about some significant downside to 440, 445"
"12185650","12187050"," would be your next target. "
"12187690","12189810"," Next target after that is 418."
"12190430","12192250"," That's for 1853."
"12193330","12201310"," We don't, the market doesn't technically become very bearish until we get underneath that for 18,"
"12201470","12201710"," 419. "
"12203490","12205990"," Just heads up, that's where you are and that kind of stuff."
"12206810","12213970"," And you might actually see, one other note here too would be in this time of year, see that, look"
"12213970","12217770"," at this right now, watch a book map, we're gonna get a little bit of a break going on."
"12218210","12224770"," But I want you to also be aware of something else here, which is, and this is very usual, very"
"12224770","12226530"," common for the time of year we were in. "
"12227270","12236930"," See how much room there is for for spied to fall and how little room there is"
"12236930","12240410"," for cues to fall."
"12241570","12248030"," This is a 30 minute chart on spoos, but spoos doesn't have too much room left to go down here."
"12248610","12253110"," You look at this bottom chart down here, you would actually, it's very common around this time of"
"12253110","12261270"," year to see cues nail that daily trigger and immediately move and spy will be left behind kind of"
"12261270","12266150"," consolidating and maybe even going a little bit lower, right?"
"12266670","12272110"," So if you do see that happen, let's say you see at any point, this capitulation take place. "
"12272870","12281190"," You'd probably, if you were a bull, want to long cues and would not shock me to see spy SPX"
"12281190","12287110"," kind of spend some more time lower rather than bouncing higher."
"12287370","12292930"," You'd see the risk on come back into effect quicker on cues than SPX."
"12335790","12338390"," Yeah, there's some open interest down there Chase. "
"12339210","12345050"," Is that why already on bot puts or is it on is it on calls?"
"12345830","12351750"," I think overall they think that's the only way that one returns to a path that both counters Iran"
"12351750","12355390"," supports Israel and builds upon normalization in the region."
"12355390","12359730"," Do you think that these sanctions on Iran previously were effective in current?"
"12360270","12361150"," I saw that fork."
"12362010","12363310"," I gotta get back to work. "
"12363310","12364070"," I gotta get back to work."
"12371460","12374600"," Good job, Bork, on the on the half bar."
"12374880","12376280"," Yeah, this is a thing too. "
"12376420","12383200"," You guys, so the reason I don't, so the reason I keep the 30 minute trigger on here is because"
"12383740","12390420"," if we like to start, what I've noticed is that if we start a roll on the hourly trigger, fucking"
"12390420","12397500"," bears well selling on that 30 minute trigger man that first roll down to like first downside to"
"12397500","12398840"," Russia supporting Russia."
"12399220","12405180"," So I leave that 30 trigger up the 30 minute trigger up there because whenever we sell, let's say"
"12405180","12408700"," we're on, let's say we're riding trend on the upside on the hourly trigger, right?"
"12408880","12410560"," Yeah, we're going up or going up or going up."
"12411140","12418480"," Every time we break down below that hourly trigger fucking bears man, they will hit that half hour"
"12418480","12425240"," trigger sell like three, four, five times in a row real hard and heavy over the course of two or"
"12425240","12425660"," three days. "
"12425920","12430760"," So Bork, if you took those calls off on that half hour trigger touch, congratulations brother."
"12431400","12435160"," If you are a seller, my effect is going to write that down because we're doing training videos."
"12435480","12441420"," If you're in the sell side, whenever we do start selling that half hour love bar that we call it"
"12441420","12445160"," the half hour love bar or something like that. "
"12445460","12452680"," If you're a seller, man, the sellers fucking love that trigger on the down front on the first leg"
"12452680","12454820"," of the down where we have a downside trend change."
"12455380","12459700"," They fucking love hitting it like it's it's like repetitive like two, three, four times."
"12464740","12465540"," Now I gotta go. "
"12478200","12481780"," That's what it is the gray bar of love the gray love bar."
"12485880","12489640"," And as we head to break, here's the glance at the markets, which are hanging on to green territory"
"12489640","12491400"," for the Dow by 47 points."
"12491980","12497060"," The S&P is down half a percent though and the NASDAQ's down 1.6% will explain what's going"
"12497060","12499200"," on with some of those tech names shortly. "
"12499920","12503520"," 10 year yields back down to 394 still up considerably from last week."
"12503880","12505380"," The exchange is back after this."
"12508040","12511060"," This is the exchange on CNBC. "
"12590380","12596880"," 78 counterparties take 704 spot 864 billion dollars at the Fed's repo operation."
"12670380","12671500"," Welcome back to the exchange."
"12672040","12674940"," 2023 was the first positive year and three for gold. "
"12675380","12678340"," Prices are still sitting near their record high set in early December."
"12678820","12682240"," And my next guest says the street can continue, but he really likes the miners here as well."
"12682660","12684320"," Joining us to check the charts is Carter worth. "
"12684380","12685800"," He's the CEO of worth charting."
"12686020","12686620"," Carter, it's good."
"12686780","12690140"," I would expect someone like you to be poo pooing the the miners trade. "
"12690300","12691460"," I'm surprised you're into it."
"12692120","12698760"," Well, you know, I sometimes there's something that's so out of favor, so under owned you can use"
"12698760","12703540"," any sort of expression one once that it's right to, I think, take the road less traveled."
"12704080","12706260"," Miners are perennial underperformers. "
"12706360","12711220"," In fact, just a statistic that's interesting, since the launch of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange"
"12711220","12720760"," Gold and Silver Index in 1979, exactly 45 years ago, January 19th, 1979, gold miners have basically"
"12720760","12721140"," unchanged."
"12721480","12723760"," I mean, which is shocking, obviously, a tough business."
"12723880","12724620"," But this is my point. "
"12725340","12729580"," You know, it just sounds like it's a bad business that only fools would want to get involved with"
"12729580","12729580"," it."
"12729580","12731140"," You dig the deep hole."
"12732980","12735620"," Guys get trapped in the hole, sometimes a lot of bad stuff. "
"12735960","12742680"," But but the point is the spread right now with gold itself is pretty extreme."
"12742820","12747580"," So we have gold making and we think gold's going a lot higher, at least from our point of view."
"12747780","12753120"," And so at some point, again, you're talking about a fairly small asset class. "
"12753300","12759660"," Now, if you think of this, all stocks in the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Mining Index add up to"
"12759660","12761460"," about $296 billion."
"12761680","12762720"," That's the same as one Costco."
"12763940","12767180"," And so they're largely a smit cap phenomenon. "
"12767880","12772340"," And if you see here on the screen right on a 10-year basis, gold miners and gold bullion are"
"12772340","12772860"," dead even."
"12773200","12778140"," But that first chart that was up, that shows going back on a 40-year basis that gold miners are"
"12778140","12779480"," basically unchanged."
"12780000","12785340"," So the situation I think is that not only the miners have a lack general equity market to a"
"12785340","12790080"," substantially, they've lagged and shown here, they've lagged the underlying metal. "
"12790400","12794740"," And so at some point, you do get these sort of pops or catch-up trades."
"12794900","12799100"," And I think that's what we're looking at as an opportunity here in 2024."
"12799440","12802620"," And having laid it out that way, I can't imagine this is anything. "
"12802920","12805800"," So do you have a price target in mind for getting out of this?"
"12806220","12810360"," Trade, because it sounds like this is one of those maybe three, six, nine-month opportunities and"
"12810360","12813160"," nothing that you'd be really interested for the long, long run."
"12814260","12814620"," Right."
"12814760","12815220"," And hard to know. "
"12815380","12819360"," But any long-run thing, you got to start with three months, six months, and then you kind of stick"
"12819360","12820740"," with it if it's working and so forth."
"12821560","12823160"," But GDX is the vehicle to use."
"12823180","12828660"," Of course, that's the most liquid of all sort of mining ETFs and there are several. "
"12828860","12832660"," This is an interesting chart, not because I made it, but it's because it tells a story."
"12833160","12833180"," Right."
"12833300","12834500"," This is a ratio chart. "
"12834680","12839280"," It's gold miners divided by the market, SPY, two ETFs."
"12839320","12846220"," And so what we know is that the relative performance is poor, but we keep holding this level for"
"12846220","12848420"," about almost 10 years."
"12848420","12852620"," And I think that the word developmental is appropriate. "
"12852620","12854420"," This is curative healing."
"12855120","12856500"," The arrow speaks for itself."
"12856800","12859060"," Of course, that's a judgment mind, but that's what I'm thinking. "
"12859260","12867320"," So quickly on gold itself, being bullish on the miners, does that take in as a fact that gold"
"12867320","12869360"," itself has to also do pretty well this year?"
"12870360","12874640"," Yes, but also let's say gold just hangs where it is, gold at all time highs."
"12874880","12879440"," I mean, now, well, it's not always a direct relationship or an inverse relationship."
"12879800","12882800"," They do make their money from gold boy. "
"12882960","12886420"," And so the underlying commodity being as strong as it is that flows through."
"12886800","12892560"," And for those who obviously, this is getting into the fundamentals gold, but I mean, fuel costs are"
"12892560","12894840"," a big part of this and fuel costs are down substantially."
"12895360","12895900"," For the miners. "
"12896440","12897160"," For the miners."
"12897260","12897420"," Yes."
"12897700","12901880"," So finally on Bitcoin, and this all, you are full of surprises today and maybe I should have been"
"12901880","12906020"," paying more close attention, but having known some of the bearish or cautious discussions we've had"
"12906020","12908420"," about stocks, you're bullish on Bitcoin. "
"12908700","12911140"," Has that been true for some time or is this a new development?"
"12912060","12916300"," Yeah, I don't, you know, I don't spend a lot of time on Bitcoin to be a fair, but I"
"12916300","12922660"," mean, if asked and we're talking about it now, the chart, it's okay."
"12922860","12923600"," It's not so extended."
"12923760","12926280"," Let me put maybe in context, people say, well, it's come so far. "
"12926860","12931300"," If you were to, and we went all agreed that the low for the equity market on this intermediate, it"
"12931300","12932840"," was October 27th."
"12933400","12935520"," And we've had this huge rally into year end."
"12935620","12942540"," And now here we are now home builders up 45% since the October 27th low, regional banks up 45,"
"12942960","12946100"," Bitcoin's up only 50%. "
"12946100","12950060"," So, you know, for something that's high beta like this, yes, it's moved a lot."
"12950240","12954820"," But since the October low on a three month basis, it's, it's, it's not that much."
"12955160","12958540"," And this is going to be real wonky, but I was just looking at it over the weekend and it"
"12958540","12962260"," really feels like real rates reversed then in late October. "
"12962260","12964100"," I was looking at the 10 year tip sealed, for instance."
"12964900","12968260"," And I don't know, maybe the whole world hangs on what direction that goes next."
"12968360","12969400"," And maybe it keeps going down. "
"12969560","12971440"," I don't know what happens if it rebounds a little bit."
"12973280","12973720"," Right."
"12973860","12974780"," I mean, so much is tied. "
"12974980","12982000"," At least it's so much of the activity in the sort of back half of the year was related to,"
"12982000","12982860"," to rates."
"12983280","12988260"," But again, relationships like this are not always inverse, for instance, with rates bumping up"
"12988260","12995300"," here, you and the dollar bumping up was gold hanging in, you know, these relationships are intact"
"12995300","12998960"," until they're not right and same with Bitcoin, you know, all of that's the case this morning."
"12998960","13000700"," And then here it is off to the races. "
"13001300","13002960"," I will leave it to the chart master Carter."
"13003220","13004420"," Thanks so much for joining us today."
"13004560","13005080"," Appreciate it. "
"13005180","13005700"," Happy New Year."
"13005800","13006540"," Carter worth you too."
"13006800","13010780"," Coming up a rare downgrade to underweight for the world's most valuable company. "
"13010820","13015360"," Why one analyst sees as much as 17% downside in Apple shares over the next year."
"13015700","13018360"," That's ahead with the stock having its worst day since August."
"13019020","13023880"," But first, Rivian shares plunging 10% to start the year after their 40% rally in December. "
"13024300","13028820"," We'll tell you what's behind the move and what led analysts to say that year-end search happened in"
"13028820","13029460"," the first place."
"13029840","13030660"," We're back after this."
"13174480","13177840"," Welcome back to the exchange 62 point game for the Dow at the lows. "
"13178040","13178780"," We were down almost 200."
"13179240","13180180"," So that's quite a turnaround."
"13180720","13184520"," Although the S&P is still negative by half a percent, the NASDAQ's down one and a half percent"
"13184520","13184820"," today. "
"13185300","13188340"," And big tech, as you might guess, is underperforming the broader market."
"13188700","13192860"," The XLK Tech ETF having its worst day in over a year down two and a half percent."
"13192980","13196780"," It's not just Apple, which is down 3.6%. We'll talk more about that in a bit. "
"13196960","13201440"," We have meta and Microsoft in the red as well and semiconductors having their worst days since"
"13201440","13205820"," October with every component of the SMH trading and negative territory today."
"13206120","13212860"," All of them with AMD and Intel, the worst performers, Intel is down 4%, AMD 5.5, even Nvidia giving"
"13212860","13214280"," up about 3% today."
"13214280","13219800"," Meanwhile, Tesla's numbers for the year are in and the company managed to beat expectations on"
"13219800","13220060"," deliveries. "
"13220880","13224680"," Even as fewer of its models will qualify for government incentives going forward, the shares are"
"13224680","13225680"," slightly lower."
"13226100","13230700"," Shares of Rivian, though, are plunging 10% after fourth-quarter deliveries fell from the prior"
"13230700","13231060"," period."
"13231720","13233660"," Let's get out to fill the vote and break it all down for us. "
"13233780","13235780"," Phil, some consequential developments here."
"13237240","13241920"," They are consequential, Kelly, but given the fact that you saw the run-up that we did, both with"
"13241920","13246700"," Rivian, as well as the other EV makers in the last six weeks, I'm not surprised we see a little"
"13246700","13247560"," bit of a sell-off today."
"13247740","13249040"," Let's start first off with Tesla. "
"13249360","13253600"," These were better than expected numbers for the fourth quarter, both in terms of production as well"
"13253600","13259420"," as delivery of the company, producing 495,000 vehicles in the fourth quarter, delivering basically"
"13259420","13262060"," 484,000 vehicles, a little over that."
"13262540","13267680"," The full year deliveries, by the way, coming in better than the company's guidance that they set at"
"13267680","13269200"," 1.8 million vehicles."
"13269520","13271380"," For the year, they deliver 1.81 million. "
"13271880","13275140"," That's an increase of 38% compared to all of 2022."
"13275960","13283140"," We will get more sense of what happened in terms of the all-important profit margin for these"
"13283140","13284060"," vehicle deliveries."
"13284600","13288320"," That will come on January 24th, basically three weeks from today. "
"13288640","13291820"," After the bell, that's when we will get the fourth quarter results from Tesla."
"13292080","13293820"," We'll hear from Elon Musk at that time."
"13294020","13295900"," Now, let's shift gears to Rivian. "
"13296160","13299920"," And for Rivian, the numbers in terms of production, much better than expected."
"13299980","13303680"," The company's guidance was to produce at least 54,000 vehicles this year."
"13303920","13305620"," They produce more than 57,000. "
"13305800","13309280"," Deliveries roughly in line with expectations, just under 14,000."
"13309360","13311360"," The street was expecting 14,000."
"13311760","13315440"," And as you take a look at the increase in deliveries year over year over year, you might say to"
"13315440","13316880"," yourself, look, this is steady. "
"13317140","13319580"," Why are people selling this stock the way they are today?"
"13319960","13324340"," Well, part of it is because you're going to see some lumpier results from Rivian in the second and"
"13324340","13328560"," third quarters as the company adjusts production, which they've already talked about, we'll get the"
"13328560","13334400"," full year results as well as their guidance for 2024 deliveries."
"13335000","13337340"," That will be coming up February 21st."
"13337680","13343020"," And Kelly, also keep in mind that with the change in the EV tax incentives from the federal"
"13343020","13348240"," government, not all vehicles that did qualify in 23 now qualify in 24. "
"13348720","13350740"," Some do, but not all of them."
"13351040","13356060"," And as a result, the concern on the street is how much of the demand was pulled forward and how"
"13356060","13359560"," many people might be sitting there saying, you know what, I'm going to hold off on buying an EV"
"13359560","13366100"," until I think that that credit will be put back on for a particular vehicle once they have the"
"13366100","13367180"," battery sourcing down."
"13367580","13371320"," That's going to make it interesting to see what we get in terms of results in the first quarter. "
"13371640","13372700"," Yeah, and I'm looking through it here."
"13372780","13376920"," It looks like Rivian might qualify, you know, the SUV and the truck for some incentives."
"13377760","13379100"," A lot of Tesla still do. "
"13379440","13382440"," Although, why doesn't it, am I correct that the cyber truck does not qualify?"
"13382500","13383200"," Why is that?"
"13385020","13390280"," Well, I think mainly it's the sourcing on the on the battery cells and a few other things, but that"
"13390280","13392900"," they expect those things to change over the course of the year."
"13393120","13396540"," And that's how it's going to be not just with Tesla, but with all of the EV companies."
"13397240","13401840"," There's a little bit of uncertainty about how quickly they can make sure the sourcing is in place"
"13401840","13403460"," for all of their vehicles. "
"13403460","13405320"," And that's going to take some time."
"13405620","13410120"," And same thing for Tesla, if they're losing some qualifications for the long range of Model 3"
"13410120","13412360"," things like that, do you think that's a sourcing issue or a three?"
"13412780","13414040"," Is that also sourcing?"
"13414280","13414920"," That's a sourcing issue."
"13414920","13417780"," All of these are sourcing issues. "
"13418300","13423680"," All of these in terms of battery components, the manufacturing, what percentage are manufactured in"
"13423680","13427720"," North America or in countries where we have friendly free trade agreements."
"13428460","13433540"," What we're seeing is the federal government saying we want you to break away from the supply chain"
"13433540","13434980"," being reliant on China."
"13435580","13441020"," And while a lot of companies have made moose, Tesla's made moose to do that, you can't break the"
"13441020","13442920"," entire supply chain overnight. "
"13443300","13444300"," And it's taking some time."
"13444460","13447340"," And that's what we're going to see here, especially in the first half of this year."
"13447420","13451480"," But they might re-qualify at some point this year or in the near future?"
"13453340","13454100"," Yep, absolutely. "
"13454820","13459420"," And we will see that with all of the right."
"13459680","13461160"," I know it's a big $7,500."
"13461560","13462360"," It's a biggie for all of them. "
"13462640","13463440"," Phil, thank you very much."
"13463540","13464100"," We appreciate it."
"13464180","13464880"," Our Phil and Bo reporting. "
"13465440","13467740"," Let's get to Tyler Matheson now for the CNBC News Update."
"13467780","13468220"," Tyler?"
"13468480","13469380"," Kelly, thank you very much."
"13469380","13475420"," A Hamas official told NBC News that a senior leader was killed today in a drone strike outside of"
"13475420","13476160"," Beirut, Lebanon. "
"13476660","13481280"," Lebanese state media reported that the Israeli military was responsible for the attack targeting a"
"13481280","13484480"," Hamas office, killing six and injuring others."
"13484480","13489080"," The IDF has not yet commented on the strike, as is often their practice."
"13489560","13494220"," Police reported an armed man broke into the building, housing the Colorado Supreme Court, an open"
"13494220","13496360"," fire before surrendering to authorities. "
"13497000","13500220"," Officials said the building suffered significant and extensive damage."
"13500700","13505560"," Authorities say they don't believe, don't believe the incident is linked to previous threats made"
"13505560","13508180"," to the state's Supreme Court justices."
"13508920","13514520"," And the president of Harvard University is resigning, Claudine Gay's resignation comes six months"
"13514520","13518720"," and two days into her presidency marking the shortest tenure in the university's history. "
"13519220","13524400"," The move follows allegations of plagiarism and her December testimony before Congress, which raised"
"13524400","13530140"," doubts about her ability to respond to anti-Semitism in the campus area of Harvard."
"13531020","13531660"," Kelly, back to you."
"13531760","13532420"," Kelly, thank you. "
"13532840","13534100"," Tyler Matheson, I'll see you shortly."
"13534680","13538680"," Coming up, don't hold your breath for any Fed rate cuts until after June, according to my next"
"13538680","13543480"," guest, we'll ask him why and talk about the challenges facing smaller banks that could force some"
"13543480","13547620"," of them into M&A, former Wells Fargo CEO Dick Kavasovic after the break."
"13549500","13716930"," You can change"
"13716930","13717430"," your life. "
"13721190","13722430"," Welcome back to the exchange."
"13722970","13727710"," The yield on the 10-year briefly above 4 percent today, that's a big job from being under 3.8"
"13727710","13728790"," percent just last week."
"13729230","13733730"," That said, the banks are a relative bright spot, the KBW Bank index up about a percent. "
"13734230","13739250"," And the big banks start reporting next week with B of A, JP Morgan, City and Wells Fargo, Fargo,"
"13739430","13740410"," all out with earnings on Friday."
"13740930","13741530"," What should we expect?"
"13741850","13742890"," Let's ask Dick Kavasovic."
"13743110","13744990"," He's the former chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo. "
"13745610","13746270"," It's good to have you here."
"13746370","13746550"," Welcome."
"13747310","13748030"," Thank you, Kelly. "
"13748370","13751850"," It seems as though the big guys for the most part are holding in there."
"13751910","13753230"," But what about the smaller banks?"
"13754030","13758590"," Well, there are some smaller banks that are having difficulties, and I think that will continue."
"13759170","13767170"," The reason is, is that they used to have quite a few depositors that were over $250,000 that"
"13767170","13769230"," insured, and they felt comfortable. "
"13769610","13771990"," The customers felt comfortable with that."
"13772550","13773970"," That's not the case anymore."
"13775150","13779930"," No one wants to put more than $250,000 in their small bank, particularly. "
"13781030","13788350"," They're also suffering from the fact that their securities portfolio is underwater because of the"
"13788350","13789330"," increase in interest rates."
"13790190","13797570"," So they may have to raise more capital in order to offset these issues."
"13798270","13801550"," And quite frankly, some of them may have to sell their bank as a result of this. "
"13801830","13806450"," Well, in sell their bank, we've kind of been waiting for a lot more of this activity over the past"
"13806450","13809670"," year, and I've been struck in a number of discussions we've had here about commercial real estate"
"13809670","13811770"," with players who are on the front lines."
"13811770","13815310"," They keep referencing the fact that the small banks have disappeared from the scene."
"13815770","13818330"," And you just wonder what that means in terms of their earnings power. "
"13819530","13821410"," Well, it's going to affect them."
"13821710","13826770"," I think in the smaller banks area, you do have commercial real estate issues."
"13827370","13837270"," But in general, these are, their loans are to local companies who have not suffered as a result"
"13837270","13839610"," of stay at home working. "
"13840070","13847130"," So I think we may not see the same level of commercial real estate issues that larger banks have,"
"13847170","13852710"," where you are in larger areas where people are working more at home."
"13853030","13855230"," Yeah, I want to ask you about the big call."
"13855390","13858930"," I don't know if you saw him this morning, but Mike Mayo was talking about how he shares a city"
"13858930","13861550"," group can triple in the next three years if I'm not mistaken. "
"13862390","13867810"," Do you want to, I'm not, listen, I don't know if you want to comment about city directly, but I'm"
"13867810","13871210"," going to ask you to make about a call like that."
"13872430","13874190"," That's a little more than I would expect."
"13874510","13884030"," But I do think not only city, but all big banks are in good position and have very good"
"13884030","13885970"," dividend yields. "
"13886950","13888210"," And I think they have more to run."
"13888780","13897290"," I think the biggest risk that the big banks have is that the Fed causes them to need much more"
"13897290","13898490"," capital than they need."
"13898930","13905870"," I don't think the big banks need anymore capital than they already have relative to their risk. "
"13906850","13910010"," And so we will see how all this plays out."
"13910550","13916290"," But that's, I think the greatest risk is not the business risk as such."
"13916290","13918330"," It's the regulatory risk. "
"13919070","13924650"," And I think it's very unfortunate because I think what's happening is that the Fed is trying to"
"13924650","13933350"," hide the fact that they did not see the risk that almost everybody else saw in spring from the"
"13933350","13935850"," Silicon Valley Bank and signature and so on."
"13936170","13940830"," And they're trying to blame that issue on not having enough capital."
"13940830","13947830"," In fact, it was a mistake by the regulators, a huge mistake that they didn't do their job right. "
"13948110","13949990"," So, you know, I've heard other people make that plays out."
"13950470","13951330"," That's echoes."
"13951570","13956190"," I've heard exactly the same critique from a few others as well who have been banking executives for"
"13956190","13956750"," a long time. "
"13956890","13959410"," And they are a little bit frustrated that that's what's going on."
"13959550","13960490"," And I don't need to miss speak."
"13960630","13963190"," By the way, Mike Mayo said he thought the shares could double, not triple. "
"13963450","13967850"," But in any case, it's a huge increase in the kind of environment that we're talking about."
"13968230","13972990"," And I guess just to kind of step back for a second, is this the outcome that you think is"
"13972990","13973710"," good for the country?"
"13973870","13975670"," If I can ask it this way, and maybe it is, right?"
"13975830","13982050"," Maybe to have five or six or whatever the number is mega banks that nobody has to question the"
"13982050","13983170"," security of their money."
"13983510","13984770"," And that's the whole game. "
"13985150","13988450"," I mean, but here we are, whatever people intended 15 years ago, here we are."
"13990590","13992870"," Well, you do need large banks."
"13993170","14003150"," Large banks are international in their business or many of them are as their customers are. "
"14003730","14013370"," So you can't provide the loans that these companies need and the places they need them without"
"14013370","14013970"," being large."
"14014250","14014850"," That's just the facts."
"14015650","14017250"," Let's just take Canada, for example. "
"14017810","14023810"," Canada basically has seven large banks that I don't know what percentage it is, but it's like 90%"
"14023810","14027850"," of the entire country for similar reasons."
"14028230","14031210"," So, you know, I don't see any reason."
"14031210","14036390"," I don't see any negatives to large banks other than if they don't behave appropriately. "
"14037010","14041710"," Or I think it's ironic as well that even as they've gotten bigger now, some of them have been good"
"14041710","14046390"," performers, obviously good stewards of capital, JP Morgan comes to mind, but others like city have"
"14046390","14046630"," not."
"14046870","14051510"," And so it's ironic that they have, I guess, almost become utility like, you know, capped up sides,"
"14051510","14052810"," capped downsides."
"14053170","14056950"," I don't know if we call them value traps because some are not, but others, many others are. "
"14058130","14060690"," Well, I think a lot of people thought they were value traps."
"14061130","14062210"," I was not one of them."
"14062870","14068150"," I've been thinking that they've been undervalued for a long period of time. "
"14069650","14078970"," Their PE ratios are 40% lower than the industry or the market."
"14079890","14086810"," And yet their yields, dividend yields are 200% 300% higher than the market."
"14087090","14088370"," So I think they've been undervalued. "
"14088550","14089590"," I don't think it's a trap."
"14090530","14095590"," Some of them had work to do to be better."
"14096410","14099990"," And it took them perhaps longer than someone expected. "
"14100510","14105870"," But several of them, you know, we can talk about JP Morgan and others have done very, very well."
"14106150","14108790"," And they're still, in my opinion, undervalued."
"14109190","14109370"," Interesting. "
"14109650","14111430"," And I think they're still room to run."
"14111790","14117690"," So quick final comment in that regard then for those at home who, you know, they'd love to be in"
"14117690","14118290"," the right ones."
"14118710","14120530"," What would your advice be on that front?"
"14121870","14126010"," Well, you know, I have my own favors, but I don't think that's important. "
"14126530","14135530"," I really think that that all the large, even the large regional banks are in good shape."
"14136490","14138210"," They they have the capital."
"14138970","14140550"," They're not. "
"14141110","14141970"," Excuse me."
"14144990","14147050"," They're they're not at risk."
"14147510","14152690"," You can have a particular bank that may need more capital, but the industry itself doesn't. "
"14153170","14162010"," And I think the market has been wrong until about the last two months that that they were somehow"
"14162010","14165110"," not going to grow and not do well."
"14165810","14166770"," And that happens."
"14167230","14169650"," And you can understand some of the reasons for that. "
"14169750","14170630"," But it's been a mistake."
"14170950","14179350"," And those of us who have been investing in it saw that opportunity and you're seeing it now in the"
"14179350","14180070"," marketplace."
"14180070","14183570"," And as you say, still more opportunity given where they go. "
"14184270","14184410"," Absolutely."
"14184850","14185870"," Dick, thanks so much for joining us."
"14185910","14186990"," We appreciate your perspective today. "
"14187610","14187990"," Okay."
"14188170","14188430"," Thanks, Kelly."
"14188770","14189310"," Dick Kavosovich. "
"14189550","14191090"," And we'll hear from banks starting next week."
"14191510","14195190"," Coming up, it's not just iPhone sales slowing at Apple, according to Barclays."
"14195710","14200110"," They downgraded the shares to underway today and see as much as 20% downside ahead. "
"14200570","14204410"," Apple's 3% drops today alone, shaving 55 points or so off the Nasdaq 100."
"14205050","14206630"," We'll dig into the headwinds next on the exchange."
"14396670","14400930"," A rare downgrade of Apple today with the shares down nearly 4% now. "
"14401230","14403350"," Barclays concerned about iPhone demand."
"14403890","14404890"," And that's not their only worry."
"14405030","14408050"," Steve Kovakis here to dig into that report in today's edition of Tech Check. "
"14408270","14409950"," It's kind of ruined the whole market."
"14410090","14410650"," Yeah, that's right."
"14410790","14411850"," It's down nearly 4%. "
"14411850","14415350"," And even when this report first came out, it's only down like 1.8% or so."
"14415550","14420130"," But look, it's the same themes that we've been talking about for the last several months now around"
"14420130","14422710"," Apple as they struggle to return to that top line growth."
"14422710","14426850"," iPhone demand, just not there, especially in those most important markets. "
"14426870","14430130"," They point to China, especially new competition from Huawei."
"14430570","14434070"," All those reports we get about government agencies, potentially blocking the iPhone."
"14434750","14438330"," And then also on the services side, which is supposed to be this kind of shining beacon that can"
"14438330","14443690"," help them return to growth, Barclays really pointing out some negative headwinds ahead, including"
"14443690","14447050"," these regulatory concerns, the DOJ case against Google. "
"14447390","14449590"," You might be wondering, what does Google have to do with Apple?"
"14449590","14455330"," Well, Google pays Apple billions every year to be that default search engine, that's at risk,"
"14455650","14457610"," regulations in Europe, another risk point."
"14457750","14459190"," So they point to all this as a downside."
"14459550","14463770"," Do they give the granularity around how much the iPhone is selling in China?"
"14464110","14468930"," Or most of the things we've been talking about should already have been priced into the shares. "
"14469150","14470490"," Like we said, it's been going on for months."
"14470710","14472630"," What do you think was the newest information here?"
"14472770","14475110"," There was another thing they talked about the mix of iPhones."
"14475390","14478890"," So it's not just about the unit sales, it's which iPhone models people are buying. "
"14479310","14483150"," The pro versions, more expensive, better margins, and so forth."
"14483650","14487870"," This report is also saying people are kind of trading down to the cheaper models, the regular"
"14487870","14489290"," iPhone 15 models."
"14489530","14490530"," That's part of it as well. "
"14490690","14492990"," It's not just going out there and buying a phone."
"14493150","14494430"," It's which phone are you buying?"
"14494810","14497570"," And the more expensive ones seem to be, don't have enough juice."
"14497770","14503150"," And even worse than that, or even more troubling in this report is the iPhone 16, which isn't even"
"14503150","14503510"," out yet. "
"14503730","14508190"," They're saying kind of going against what our friend Dan Ives always says at Webbush that there's"
"14508190","14509690"," were due for a big upgrade cycle."
"14510230","14511070"," Barclay's in the opposite."
"14511450","14515110"," That this could be another lackluster year for the iPhone following the 15. "
"14515350","14519610"," And I remember when we just had to get one last fall, the incentives were so much bigger than I"
"14519610","14520010"," expected."
"14520230","14522150"," I didn't know of that pointed to a weakness in demand."
"14522350","14525410"," And maybe it tells you all that remind me the name of the headset again. "
"14525570","14525970"," Vision Pro."
"14526130","14526490"," Vision Pro."
"14526490","14527710"," I can never remember Vision Pro. "
"14527990","14529650"," It's all you're going to be talking about in a few months."
"14529650","14530930"," Vision Pro, Vision Pro."
"14531190","14535030"," Maybe again, this becomes kind of their saving grace. "
"14535030","14537190"," To your point about the deals, there still exists."
"14537470","14541710"," But those are more about the carriers trying to get you to switch over from T-Mobile to Verizon or"
"14541710","14542430"," what have you."
"14542690","14546050"," That's less about phone demand versus..."
"14546050","14546870"," We weren't switching. "
"14547190","14547650"," That was the thing."
"14548110","14551330"," Yeah, but they don't want you to switch to the other guy."
"14551730","14554570"," I mean, every commercial, get a free phone, trade in your old one. "
"14554890","14556010"," That's all part of the game."
"14556190","14556330"," You're right."
"14556590","14558730"," Well, it's still interesting to see the markets reaction to this. "
"14558730","14560170"," And it's taking everyone down with them."
"14560230","14562770"," Only the fourth analyst on the street, I believe, with the sell rating."
"14562770","14563010"," Right. "
"14563250","14567450"," And it's down to $160, so I mean, I think it's trading at $185 or so now."
"14567630","14568390"," That's pretty tough."
"14568410","14571850"," And if it goes to that level, then we could see Microsoft surpass it in market. "
"14572070","14573790"," They are very close."
"14573990","14575890"," I just checked before we came on air."
"14576090","14580470"," $2.75 trillion for Microsoft, $2.8 or so for Apple. "
"14580470","14580590"," Wow."
"14581050","14582490"," We could see a flip-fought pretty soon."
"14582670","14584090"," That would be a big way to kick off the year. "
"14584330","14584810"," Steve, thank you."
"14585410","14585830"," Steve Kovac."
"14586090","14590510"," Coming up, today's moves are threatening to wipe out gains made in the last five trading days of"
"14590510","14591310"," 2023. "
"14591310","14594630"," And Wolf's Christenik says, don't believe the recent melt-up."
"14594890","14597890"," The number one fake signal he's watching, and it's not the dots."
"14598290","14599030"," He joins us next. "
"14775330","14781350"," Today, welcome back to the exchange."
"14781870","14784610"," Stocks closed out 2023 on an eight-week wind streak."
"14785010","14787730"," That momentum not fully carrying into the first day of this year. "
"14788190","14790550"," Wolf researchers Christenik doesn't believe in the melt-up."
"14790710","14793670"," He's laid out numerous warning signs for equities in his latest note."
"14793670","14799150"," Topping the watch list is what he calls a huge and underappreciated catalyst, Fed liquidity, which"
"14799150","14800250"," he expects to decline. "
"14800730","14806230"," Next up, performance chasing for 2023's top stocks, the likes of Coinbase, NVIDIA, Meta, Royal"
"14806230","14807150"," Caribbean, Uber."
"14807790","14812050"," He also flags all major U.S. equity markets still look overbought in the near term."
"14812470","14813630"," And finally, the lack of fear. "
"14813890","14818190"," The vix well below its average, currently just over 13 and nine-month futures are also at multi "
"14818190","14818770","-year lows."
"14819350","14822490"," Joining me now to discuss is Wolf's Chief Investment Strategist, Christenik."
"14822490","14823910"," Christenik, it's good to see you. "
"14824170","14828130"," And, you know, we're all on one side of the boat here."
"14828890","14831610"," And you're saying, don't go over there."
"14831710","14832630"," It's going to tip over there. "
"14833450","14834330"," Yeah, hi, Kelly."
"14834550","14835050"," Happy new year."
"14835170","14836330"," And thanks for having me on. "
"14836610","14840150"," So we obviously had a very epic melt-up into your end."
"14840150","14843550"," And we kind of told investors at that point in time to play the seasonal trade."
"14843850","14849470"," As we enter the new year, the market is overbought on many signals, whether you look at relative"
"14849470","14856010"," strength or MACD, or some other technical indicators, investors over own technology stocks as a"
"14856010","14856410"," sector. "
"14857290","14867130"," And some of the key variables that drove stocks higher in 23, namely fed liquidity to us, don't"
"14867130","14868530"," seem to be present."
"14868830","14871770"," In fact, maybe going in the other direction in 2024."
"14872030","14875050"," So we're not believers in the sustainability of the rally. "
"14875770","14881210"," And actually today's performance in sectors and themes and styles, I think has been much more"
"14881210","14884850"," indicative of at least what we're going to see in the first half of this year."
"14885050","14887970"," And you think the key, you know, your number one here is fed liquidity."
"14888530","14891870"," And some have pointed out Dan greenhouse and others, it's pretty ironic. "
"14892390","14896710"," They did all those rate hikes, you know, soaked all, you know, did all that QT and the market did"
"14896710","14897570"," what it did last year."
"14898290","14903270"," Yeah, so the Fed balance sheet quantitative tightening has been falling on the asset side."
"14903610","14907350"," But what's happened is a lot of money market funds park money at the Fed. "
"14907350","14912410"," And it gets a little wonky parking money at the Fed overnight, but they did that."
"14912690","14917910"," And then they started to pull their money out of the Fed overnight facility to invest in T bills"
"14917910","14920310"," and longer duration fixed income securities."
"14920670","14924430"," And the effect of that actually adds liquidity to the system. "
"14924650","14926850"," So there's an old saying you kind of follow the money."
"14927110","14934210"," Well, following the money in 2023, it led to higher stock prices because the equity measured by"
"14934210","14937590"," bank reserves at the Fed increased $450 billion."
"14938390","14944950"," That to us is unsustainable in 2024 because of some of those very forces that help liquidity are"
"14944950","14945810"," going to go in the other direction. "
"14946010","14949330"," And would you say that's the most important thing to watch then kind of those weekly levels for"
"14949330","14950630"," reverse repos, that kind of thing?"
"14951010","14956750"," I far because when reverse repo levels get to a level that no one knows what the magical number or"
"14956750","14959650"," thing will be reach more precarious level."
"14959650","14960950"," It's lower than we are today."
"14961150","14965110"," The running kind of normalizes about $830 billion today. "
"14965430","14971110"," But when they get below $500 billion or $400 billion, there could be some tightness in the system."
"14971870","14976750"," And I guess in a worst case scenario, if you will, if that's a word for it, the Fed might"
"14976750","14982970"," have to and quantitative tightening in the second half of the year, which could actually be weirdly"
"14982970","14987070"," a bolder signal for the markets because the balance sheet won't be shrinking at that point in time."
"14987070","14988030"," One thousand percent. "
"14988230","14991870"," But I appreciate how you laid out kind of this is at the heart of and then many other things"
"14991870","14995250"," could follow everything from the VIX and so forth if we see a reversal there."
"14995690","14996710"," That's the top of the dashboard."
"14996850","14997930"," Chris, that will leave it there. "
"14998090","14998790"," Thanks for your time today."
"14998850","14999390"," I appreciate it."
"14999830","15000570"," Thanks for having me. "
"15000610","15003330"," Chris Sennick, as the market gives up its gains, by the way."
"15003670","15007710"," That does it for the exchange on power lunch, new year, new leadership for lots of corporate"
"15007710","15008150"," America."
"15008730","15012610"," The companies with regime changes and the big risks that could be ahead in an election year. "
"15013110","15013590"," Tyler is back."
"15013810","15014310"," He's getting ready."
"15014470","15015790"," I'll join him on the other side of the spring. "
"15147130","15149070"," Happy new year and welcome to power lunch, everybody."
"15149410","15150770"," Alongside Kelly Evans, I'm Tyler."
"15151030","15152970"," Max, I'm glad you could join us for 2024. "
"15153770","15160390"," Coming up, seeing red, we are watching oil prices after Iran, the special warship to the Red Sea."
"15160770","15165970"," This is the latest sign that tension in the region will not be easing anytime soon."
"15166190","15168130"," We'll see what that means for oil prices this year. "
"15168290","15170350"," Plus, it's not only the first trading day of the year."
"15170730","15174910"," It's also the first day on the job for a number of corporate CEOs, including the likes of Morgan"
"15174910","15177770"," Stanley, Kraft Heinz, Krispy Kreme, and others."
"15178090","15181950"," And they have their work cut out for them to break down the key risks based on the C-suite"
"15181950","15182570"," in 2024. "
"15183090","15185430"," But first, let's give a check on the markets off to a mixed start."
"15185870","15190490"," The Dow had been higher by nearly triple digits, giving up those gains now, clinging on to an 11"
"15190490","15193790"," point increase, while the S&P is now down two thirds of one percent."
"15194330","15198290"," And the NASDAQ is down one and three quarters of a percent back below 15,000. "
"15198590","15205090"," The crypto market, on the other hand, starting the year quite strong, Bitcoin back above $45,000"
"15205090","15206870"," for the first time since 2022."
"15206910","15208570"," More on that ahead."
"15208910","15212730"," And lots of headlines in the EV market Tesla beating delivery estimates. "
"15213170","15215870"," Rivian missing those shares down more than 10%."
"15215870","15217490"," We'll trade it in three stock lunch."
"15217850","15219150"," And a big downgrade for Apple. "
"15219770","15224970"," Barclays lowering to Underweight, saying it's time for a breather with Apple."
"15225570","15228690"," Microsoft close to surpassing Apple's market cap."
"15228690","15234310"," Interesting, given the Magnificent Seven and its dominance last year, it begs the question, what"
"15234310","15237590"," names and themes will matter most to markets this year?"
"15237770","15241810"," Let's start right there with Mike Santoli at the NYSE. "
"15242010","15245230"," What do you say, Mike, themes and names that will dominate the year?"
"15245610","15250650"," Well, Tyler, in terms of themes, I think you have to acknowledge, given the progress made in the"
"15250650","15254810"," equity index is coming into this year, that the market's pleasure threshold is higher."
"15255030","15259370"," In other words, it's going to take more good news as opposed to just the absence of scary bad news"
"15259370","15262890"," to keep things moving in a positive direction for stocks."
"15263150","15267710"," But I do still think we're in a moment where good news for the economy can be good news for"
"15267710","15268250"," the market. "
"15268430","15273290"," I think the October CPI report back in November really was encouraging along this front."
"15273430","15278290"," It kind of gave leeway to the Fed to basically say good economic news is not something that they're"
"15278290","15281810"," going to have to fight outright, as long as inflation moves in the right direction."
"15282110","15287930"," To that point, I don't really believe the stock market, just because we're at $47.50 on the S&P"
"15287930","15293970"," and the Fed Fund's futures market sees 150 basis points of cuts maybe later this year that we need"
"15293970","15296630"," those cuts to justify where the stock market is. "
"15296770","15302010"," One year ago, the market said the Fed was going to be cutting through the second half of 2023."
"15302330","15303050"," It didn't happen."
"15303270","15304170"," The market went higher. "
"15304430","15306530"," So I think that those are two separate things."
"15307070","15311010"," And then finally, I wouldn't really focus too much on the supposed cash on the sidelines argument."
"15311350","15315450"," Yeah, a lot of money went into money market bond funds last year, but that doesn't necessarily mean"
"15315450","15319350"," it's a zero-sum game where you have to watch for those assets to kind of make their way into"
"15319350","15319530"," stocks. "
"15319730","15322370"," People have decent, healthy equity allocations already."
"15322770","15324110"," I don't think the stock market's hated."
"15324450","15326810"," Doesn't mean you can't make further progress though. "
"15327090","15328650"," All right, Michael, thank you very much."
"15328950","15333970"," Stay there as we bring in our next guest who held onto his growth tech stocks last year and had"
"15333970","15335590"," a net return of some 60%."
"15335590","15339830"," Let's bring in Peter Anderson, Chief Investment Officer with Anderson Capital Management. "
"15340330","15341510"," Peter, happy new year."
"15341510","15342170"," Welcome, Blake."
"15342330","15343950"," Great to kick off the new year with you. "
"15344290","15345390"," You held onto tech."
"15345850","15348210"," You said no recession last year."
"15348310","15348970"," You were right. "
"15349290","15350350"," You were right on technology."
"15351170","15352250"," What do you say for this year?"
"15352750","15354810"," Recession or not, hold tech or not?"
"15356350","15359130"," I don't think there's going to be a recession this year."
"15359710","15363390"," I also don't think that the Fed is going to cut rates. "
"15363770","15372290"," I must be on a different planet, Tyler, because I just cannot rationalize the thoughts of why we"
"15372290","15377910"," would have a rate cut as opposed to actually even several rate cuts."
"15378690","15383830"," And I do think tech, some of the themes that you were talking about earlier, let me just add on"
"15383830","15384250"," to that."
"15384570","15392910"," I think one of the more alarming themes is when AI gets introduced to hackers, that will probably"
"15392910","15401910"," accelerate their capabilities of hacking and will cause far more necessary diligence on protecting"
"15401910","15402610"," data. "
"15403330","15406770"," So data security companies, I think, are going to do well again this year."
"15407150","15408930"," So that would be a Palo Alto network."
"15409330","15410530"," It could be a cyber arc software. "
"15411010","15413570"," It could be others in that neighborhood."
"15414670","15421910"," Are you implying a little bit, Peter, that some of the bloom is going to come off of the AI"
"15421910","15431790"," rows to use the cliche because of the reasons you cite, the ability of bad actors to use it for"
"15431790","15432390"," bad purposes?"
"15433270","15435970"," It's an interesting approach you're using, Tyler."
"15436270","15441390"," I would agree with half of that, meaning that I do think some of the bloom will come off the"
"15441390","15443530"," AI rows, but not for the reasons you've stated. "
"15444010","15450890"," Instead, I think what could happen is people will have to refine their expectations of what"
"15450890","15452630"," artificial intelligence can do."
"15452630","15458430"," So far, we have been drunken sailors thinking that this is going to solve every problem in"
"15458430","15459050"," humanity."
"15459390","15465250"," But when you do a deeper dive and you look at the actual academic research, they disagree with us. "
"15465250","15469930"," They think that we are far, far from emulating human thought."
"15470390","15476730"," And until we emulate human thought, we are confusing artificial intelligence with just advanced"
"15476730","15477550"," data production."
"15478030","15483030"," So to summarize that, I do think that the AI, we need to refine our expectations. "
"15483770","15490350"," AI is not anywhere where we think it is, ironically, and that there's a lot more work in research"
"15490350","15495710"," to be done before we actually have to be afraid that AI is going to take our jobs, for instance."
"15496250","15497750"," Well, you're sticking with NVIDIA, Peter."
"15497950","15502230"," You're sticking with the market and you stuck with it last year in spite of all the negativity out"
"15502230","15502450"," there. "
"15502930","15506210"," And you're sticking with it, even though you're not even sure we're going to get a lot of Fed rate"
"15506210","15506950"," cuts this year."
"15507910","15508490"," That's right."
"15508490","15514710"," And I don't think that we will be dependent that performance of these stocks, I don't think will be"
"15514710","15516790"," dependent upon rate cuts. "
"15517330","15523550"," And Kelly, if we look beyond, say, 20 years, which for some of us, I guess is a lifetime, but"
"15523550","15530330"," when you look past that 20-year horizon, rates were much higher than the prevailing rates now."
"15530750","15533370"," So the question comes, how long is a cycle?"
"15533770","15535570"," What is a normal rate environment?"
"15535570","15541870"," And I guess I tend to disagree with the general narrative that rates are unnaturally high right"
"15541870","15542130"," now."
"15542310","15548730"," If anything, I think they're approaching a vertex where we would think that rates are normalized"
"15549230","15555510"," and that the Fed will not have to cut rates this year and perhaps even into the next year. "
"15556030","15560530"," So, Michael, let me turn back to you and get your joint sort of general reactions to what Peter is"
"15560530","15561210"," saying here."
"15561590","15564090"," 2023 was clearly the year of AI."
"15564090","15566530"," It was clearly the year of NVIDIA. "
"15567010","15572530"," And more broadly to those big cap tech stocks, like Meta, which had a fantastic year."
"15573210","15575750"," What do you see on the horizon for 2024?"
"15576310","15581550"," Is AI going to be another dominant theme again this year?"
"15582550","15586830"," Will big tech continue to dominate as it did last year or not?"
"15587270","15592390"," I'm not sure that it's going to move modelistically as it was perceived to have done last year."
"15592390","15597930"," First of all, NVIDIA in particular is responsible for a tremendous amount of what we think of as"
"15597930","15600110"," the Magnificent Seven Dominants last year. "
"15600570","15606230"," If every other stock did what it actually did in 2023 and NVIDIA was flat, the S&P would have"
"15606230","15610270"," been up, I believe, 18% or 16% instead of 24."
"15611210","15613150"," And the equal weighted S&P would have been up 12%."
"15613150","15615310"," We wouldn't be talking about this crazy narrow market. "
"15615510","15619690"," So, I do think NVIDIA in particular stole a tremendous amount of the auction."
"15619690","15624950"," My guess is, investors are going to kind of look to have that theme splinter out and look for other"
"15624950","15626450"," ways to play it."
"15626610","15630790"," I'm more interested, though, Tyler, in the fact that cyclical stocks continue to outperform pure"
"15630790","15631630"," defensive stocks. "
"15631970","15637530"," And until that really changes, I'm not sure we have to think of it as a pure secular growth "
"15637530","15639090","-dominated type market."
"15639310","15644370"," It seems like, you know, if we can argue about whether the Fed should cut rates at all, I don't"
"15644370","15647390"," think it's going to be a lot of rate cuts unless the economy buckles."
"15647390","15650570"," But they think neutral rates are two and a half or three percent. "
"15650810","15655070"," They're not going to keep them at five and three days if inflation's coming down continually from"
"15655070","15655290"," here."
"15655430","15659630"," So that's why I think the idea of peacetime rate cuts has gotten a lot of adoption."
"15659770","15663070"," That's where I'd like to end with you, Peter, and pin you down a little bit. "
"15663470","15669090"," Are you saying that a year from today, when we're back together, and I hope you'll be with us on"
"15669090","15675630"," January 2nd next year, that a year from today, the Fed funds rate will still be at that five and"
"15675630","15678670"," a half to five and a quarter to five and a half level."
"15678990","15681030"," Or will it come down at all?"
"15683070","15689630"," I am hoping, I guess, general narrative out there, that it will stay about the same."
"15690290","15697190"," Because I think even at that level, you can have a normally operating economy, in fact, probably an"
"15697190","15702850"," even healthier economy, flying in the face of what some are calling unnecessarily high rates now. "
"15702850","15708850"," So yes, I do not think that the Fed is going to cut rates, and I look forward to seeing"
"15708850","15710010"," you this time next year."
"15710010","15710670"," I do too."
"15710890","15711530"," Thank you, Peter. "
"15711710","15712290"," Appreciate it."
"15712290","15713610"," Good to see you again."
"15714030","15715310"," And may you have a happy and healthy. "
"15715550","15716470"," Michael, the same to you."
"15716630","15717150"," Mike's in total."
"15717810","15720690"," Now to oil, which is kicking off the year on a volatile note. "
"15721290","15726470"," Rising after Iran dispatched a warship to the Red Sea, before reversing course lower, it comes as"
"15726470","15730950"," naval clashes in the critical waterway escalated with the U.S. Navy destroying three boats of Iran "
"15730950","15735630","-backed rebels, and as tensions rise, how should we expect that to impact oil prices going forward?"
"15736050","15739190"," John Kildoff is founding partner of Again Capital and the CNBC contributor."
"15739770","15742530"," I don't want to skip right to the good stuff right away, John."
"15742730","15746190"," But I mean, I think your point about watch the Saudis here is really, really interesting. "
"15746490","15748350"," Can you tell us why that's your first thought?"
"15749870","15750710"," Sure, Kelly."
"15750950","15751430"," Good to see you."
"15752050","15758310"," So I'm choked here, producer, that while everybody's focused on the Fed put this year for the"
"15758310","15762310"," equity market, I'm actually focused as an oil guy on the Saudi House. "
"15762890","15768250"," I'm calling it because I'm waiting for them to run out of patience, basically, with their other"
"15768250","15774870"," participants in OPEC+, we've already seen OPEC+, free a bit on the edges with Angola pulling out of"
"15774870","15775430"," the cartel."
"15776410","15783130"," And once the Saudis get tired of soldering the burden of supporting prices, what happens is what"
"15783130","15788950"," has happened in the past is that prices will fall because the Saudis will unleash supply to the"
"15788950","15795670"," market that will overwhelm and then look to hurt the higher cost producers out there, some of which"
"15795670","15797250"," are right in our own shale backyard."
"15797770","15798810"," They've done this in the past. "
"15799050","15803410"," Maybe you can refresh our memories a little bit as to those key and critical moments they did so"
"15803410","15804090"," and why."
"15804750","15806130"," Can they afford to this time around?"
"15807630","15812910"," They are constrained to a degree because of their aspirations that they're building their economy,"
"15812990","15816910"," building you've probably heard of me on some of these other projects they have gone."
"15817350","15822490"," But look, I can take you all the way back to 1993 when they got into it with Venezuela, similarly"
"15822490","15824010"," in 1999-2000. "
"15824870","15829470"," Most other folks are referencing the 2018-2019 time period."
"15829830","15837890"," I'll also point you to the pandemic 2020, when they had the most mistimed throwdown ever when they"
"15837890","15843630"," unleashed their supply on the market, just as we headed into the pandemic shutdown, which sent to"
"15843630","15844410"," all prices negative."
"15844670","15846110"," So they've done it before. "
"15846550","15850810"," I don't think it's that preferred methodology, but if it comes time to take everybody out to the"
"15850810","15853950"," woodshed and teach them a lesson, the Saudis do have the power to do that."
"15854070","15859790"," Is the Saudi pout the reason you see oil potentially at $50 a share this time next year?"
"15861130","15866070"," I do, Tyler, for a couple of other reasons, besides obviously the Saudi pout if it comes to pass"
"15866070","15870890"," will push those prices considerably lower for any time until the wagons get circled again."
"15870890","15877710"," But look, with the global central banks on the path to cut rates, they're not just doing that"
"15877710","15880530"," because they beat the inflation scareback. "
"15881050","15886550"," They're doing that because they say economic weakness, not only here, but in Europe, but also a big"
"15886550","15890850"," problem for the oil market continues to be China, where the economy there continues to be"
"15890850","15891130"," lackluster."
"15891770","15892910"," They just haven't come back."
"15893110","15893930"," They're not coming back. "
"15894710","15899470"," And the problems may indeed even be somewhat insurmountable to the extent they can't get that"
"15899470","15902890"," economy or they're aspiring on at least six of the eight cylinders."
"15903550","15910830"," So why this time, John, in past occasions where there has been tensions in the Red Sea and the"
"15910830","15919830"," Straits of Hormuz and the areas there, oil has generally responded by rising in price, not this"
"15919830","15923810"," time or not much this time, why do you think that is true?"
"15923810","15927650"," I think this isn't our first rodeo child."
"15928510","15930950"," We've had so many scares in the past. "
"15931110","15936350"," Look, when Iraq first got, when Iraq first invaded Kuwait way back in the day again, the first"
"15936350","15941270"," time, oil prices spiked to $35, $40 a barrel, quickly fell back."
"15942030","15944030"," And that's been the scenario every time since."
"15944490","15950390"," The second Iraq war, the bombing of abcaked by the Houthis, that's the Saudi, major Saudi oil"
"15950390","15951170"," export facility. "
"15951170","15957210"," The killing of Iran's general solemnly, you would have thought would have been a trigger point for"
"15957210","15958670"," a broader regional conflict."
"15959490","15965850"," The folks out there, you know, just have a patience or they buy their time or take these affronts"
"15965850","15967990"," in an almost unimaginable extent."
"15968570","15973250"," And so to the extent that we're not going to have actual lost barrels, like we didn't with the"
"15973250","15975850"," invasion of Ukraine, like we're not seeing now. "
"15976270","15979510"," And if you don't think for a minute that the U.S. 5th lead isn't going to be able to"
"15979510","15983590"," keep the Red Sea and the Strait of Hormuz open, I'll take the other side of that bet in a"
"15983590","15983790"," minute."
"15984010","15986790"," So that's why, Tyler, you've got to have perspective here."
"15987130","15990390"," The headlines and the possibilities, yes, are scary. "
"15991190","15993730"," But it's sort of like telling ghost stories around a campfire."
"15994370","15999550"," You know, the boogeyman comes out and then it turns out, everybody's OK."
"16000330","16001090"," John killed off. "
"16001270","16002030"," We'll leave it on that note."
"16002270","16002550"," Thank you."
"16003170","16003570"," Appreciate it. "
"16003590","16003830"," Thank you."
"16003830","16004350"," Have a good new year."
"16004470","16004670"," Thank you. "
"16004870","16006990"," And speaking of energy, quick programming."
"16006990","16011210"," No, Brian Sullivan will be live in Miami from the Goldman Energy and Clean Tech Conference on"
"16011210","16011510"," Thursday."
"16012010","16016610"," He'll have exclusive interviews with some key guests like the Sun Run CEO here on PowerLunch and"
"16016610","16020910"," continuing with Chevron and Goldman, as Chevron CEO, I should say, and Goldman's head of oil"
"16020910","16022270"," research on last call. "
"16022490","16025310"," Looking forward to that on Thursday, January 4th."
"16025850","16031130"," And coming off, is this the year of crypto with an ETF on the way?"
"16031490","16036470"," Probably we are seeing some expectations for the Bitcoin price to hit anywhere from 62."
"16037430","16038870"," You know, am I reading this right?"
"16039590","16040470"," $500,000. "
"16041590","16046270"," We'll discuss that one next, but before we head to break a quick power check on the positive side,"
"16046490","16051190"," Moderna, Oppenheimer, upgrading the biotech name, citing optimism in its drug pipeline."
"16051310","16053450"," On the negative side, Norwegian cruise line."
"16054210","16057610"," I would for the my people, the Norwegians here, the cruise line. "
"16058050","16062130"," Continuing to decline from last week along with the other cruise stops in the space, that's your"
"16062130","16062710"," power check."
"16063130","16063690"," We'll be right back."
"16226110","16227890"," Welcome back to PowerLunch. "
"16228250","16233330"," Bitcoin soaring above $45,000 today for the first time since April 2022."
"16233630","16237370"," And hanging on to its gains, by the way, as we move through the session, as the rally in crypto"
"16237370","16242310"," rolls over into the new year, the entire space reaping the benefits of this bull run mining stocks."
"16242590","16246490"," Bitcoin mining crypto mining stocks saw huge gains last year, as you can see. "
"16246490","16251990"," And it all comes as traders grow excited about both the possible approval of the Bitcoin ETF in the"
"16251990","16257050"," U.S., as well as the potential of Bitcoin having this spring, that people say could catalyze a"
"16257050","16261690"," price rally here to discuss the embassy.com crypto report is Mackenzie Segalos and Tanea McKill."
"16261990","16263010"," Welcome to both of you."
"16263710","16264970"," Mackenzie, I'll just start with you. "
"16265210","16267670"," And is it just the first year?"
"16267870","16270430"," Why so many fun flows and all of a sudden we're off to the races today?"
"16270570","16270970"," What are you hearing?"
"16271470","16274990"," Yeah, a lot of it has to do with the fact that there's optimism that we could actually hear as"
"16274990","16279530"," soon as this week, whether or not some of these spot Bitcoin ETF applications will be approved."
"16279750","16285330"," The SEC has a deadline of January 10th to give ARC and 21 shares a decision on whether to approve"
"16285330","16287310"," or disapprove their spot application."
"16287550","16290350"," And there's optimism that it will be a green light this time. "
"16290350","16294410"," You've got some of the biggest names throwing their hat in the ring, BlackRock June 15th."
"16294510","16298950"," Since June 15th when BlackRock put an application in, we've seen an 80% spike in the price of"
"16298950","16299190"," Bitcoin."
"16299650","16303490"," And a lot of that has to do with the fact that they think that institutional money will flood into"
"16303490","16304990"," the space once we see some approvals. "
"16305410","16305710"," That's incredible."
"16305970","16309430"," So they really do face near term deadlines here for us to know one way or the other."
"16309530","16310250"," Tanae, what would you add?"
"16310910","16313830"," I would add the geopolitical tension in the Red Sea, I think. "
"16313970","16319170"," Remember Bitcoin has been in kind of a downtrend for the last three weeks and did December on kind"
"16319170","16322110"," of a low note, but that up trend is still kind of intact."
"16322550","16327610"," And remember, so to Mack's point, a lot of this rally is about the potential Bitcoin ETF."
"16327890","16334050"," But remember that before that ETF narrative came into play in June of last year, it was the US"
"16334050","16337610"," regional banking crisis here in the US. "
"16337870","16338770"," That was the big catalyst."
"16339390","16345410"," From March 5th to April 30th, we were really seeing Bitcoin rise from the ashes at the beginning of"
"16345410","16345930"," last year."
"16346130","16348730"," And that was its first sort of 30% spike of two questions. "
"16348910","16354430"," Mackenzie, one is, are there Bitcoin ETFs in other countries around the world?"
"16355090","16361690"," What do they own, do they actually own Bitcoin, do they own some futures, what do they own, and how"
"16361690","16362090"," have they worked?"
"16362550","16364670"," In Canada, we have a spot Bitcoin ETF."
"16365290","16369470"," One of the reasons why people think that this is going to be sell the news event is because the"
"16369470","16372910"," flows with that ETF haven't been as anticipated."
"16372990","16377570"," And I think that that's one of the biggest narratives that we've seen this huge price run up going"
"16377570","16378250"," into this event. "
"16378410","16384090"," But think back to December 2017, there was a lot of optimism around a futures Bitcoin ETF."
"16384390","16386790"," And that ended up being a negative catalyst for the space."
"16386790","16392610"," Even Bernstein that deems a spot Bitcoin ETF is being the greatest financial pipeline ever built"
"16392610","16396390"," between traditional financial markets and the crypto ecosystem. "
"16396849","16402230"," Things that there will be, you know, that the market will take a pause once these spot ETFs are"
"16402230","16404550"," approved while people wait to see if the flows build momentum."
"16404570","16409710"," When you say spot ETF, you mean they are actually going to own Bitcoin, not futures."
"16410169","16413869"," And that's what's so different about this because it would mean that people don't have to go to an"
"16413869","16415349"," exchange to custody Bitcoin. "
"16415689","16420369"," Instead, you know, BlackRock Fidelity would work with Coinbase to custody the Bitcoin."
"16420689","16424210"," And then you have a very, you know, familiar product that you can buy into the space with."
"16424330","16427930"," And that's what it's just keeping an eye out right here. "
"16428810","16431150"," You got this low right in here."
"16433500","16436480"," You had a low and then a new low right here."
"16437820","16439740"," You have a higher low right here. "
"16440000","16442640"," So no kind of indecision right now."
"16442640","16447020"," I can't really tell anything from these previous lows here."
"16448320","16449520"," I can't see anything back here. "
"16450800","16452119"," I'm kind of cleaned up this."
"16452279","16454060"," Let me just go to the trigger screen really quick."
"16455419","16461040"," So what I'm looking for here is you can see the time that we're spending back here. "
"16462500","16465060"," You got these little two little ticks back here."
"16465119","16466580"," We can snap some lines on."
"16467640","16471480"," You got one right there. "
"16473460","16476540"," Got a one dash, a yellow."
"16478880","16481360"," A little bit of, let's take a look at this closer."
"16484490","16485890"," Got a little gap right there. "
"16486009","16487910"," There's a little tiny gap right in here."
"16488029","16488369"," You see it?"
"16489090","16490090"," There's a gap right here too."
"16490310","16491490"," A little big little gap right there. "
"16491610","16492470"," A little gap right there."
"16493669","16497230"," And then I don't see any gaps down here, but we'll mark it."
"16502810","16505050"," There's a little bit of gapage right here too. "
"16505470","16508770"," A little bit of some prior marks back there."
"16510550","16514270"," So these little yellow lines that I have here, this is your S3."
"16515189","16516130"," Take a look at that. "
"16520720","16521900"," It's right in here."
"16522080","16523660"," All this stuff could be cleaned up."
"16524460","16526020"," A little bit more down there to clean up. "
"16548250","16553669"," Yeah, those little yellow lines, they're just just little tiny gaps."
"16553669","16555849"," A little teensy-weensy gaps back there."
"16556009","16556689"," There's one more. "
"16556910","16557790"," I guess I put that."
"16558009","16560050"," Maybe this should be a little bit lower somewhere down in there."
"16568180","16569400"," Clean those up a little bit. "
"16569520","16570619"," Just ping ponging down there."
"16570759","16571360"," The little L goes."
"16572160","16573520"," Well, Gremlins doing their work. "
"16585930","16588550"," That white line should have been on the four o'clock hour."
"16588770","16590009"," I just put it in the wrong place."
"16590849","16598470"," My point was that, well, it doesn't matter if it's short week or not, but you've got turnaround"
"16598470","16600570"," Tuesday and then what the fuck Wednesday, right?"
"16600910","16605509"," So yeah, today is Tuesday, but we have a short week. "
"16605830","16607570"," So it should last into the morning."
"16607570","16612669"," The turnaround Tuesday would last into tomorrow morning, at least."
"16613029","16614450"," I just placed it at the wrong place. "
"16614450","16617169"," So we should be at the 1600 hour."
"16617430","16620950"," It's right here."
"16621910","16629710"," So just that four p.m. The only point behind this was you'd hit the three o'clock hour, right?"
"16629970","16633490"," And this would be your three o'clock to four o'clock hour down here. "
"16633669","16638470"," So you'd get maybe a little bit of this fake out blast down here and then wake up in the"
"16638470","16639650"," morning down, right?"
"16639849","16641950"," And that would be your actual dip buy for Friday."
"16642750","16644090"," Not guaranteed or anything."
"16644410","16646490"," It matters where we go. "
"16647009","16648689"," Also notice today, too, right?"
"16649869","16652550"," There's some other things you can take away from this."
"16652550","16654450"," So we were not in a trend day, right?"
"16655130","16656810"," We had a failed breakout here."
"16657029","16663890"," No, that's kind of bearish, but the more time we spend down here, you know, the slower we go, it's"
"16663890","16665150"," organized, you know what I mean?"
"16665349","16672430"," We're not seeing like any kind of trend to the upside, willingness from buyers here stepping in. "
"16672790","16680830"," So I would expect that weakness into, I'm going to expect that weakness into the close."
"16682669","16688430"," And not necessarily extend past the close or much past the open."
"16689650","16695390"," I would expect like, let's say like 7am, 6am, the market gets bought tomorrow if we are weak into"
"16695390","16695830"," the close. "
"16696770","16698590"," So you can pick your poison here, right?"
"16698730","16703290"," You could get a call spread at four o'clock or you could wait for the open."
"16704330","16712310"," If you want to be more secure in that trade, if you're looking for a weekly call spread or"
"16712310","16717430"," something like that, personally, I would wait and I am waiting."
"16717430","16722349"," I will end up, I'm looking to buy the problem from here where we are just looking at this. "
"16723130","16725890"," I'm not necessarily bearish, but I am."
"16726950","16733009"," I always like to see that, you know, you get that just that weekly capitulation, weekly low"
"16733009","16734349"," expected move kind of stuff."
"16734730","16739509"," And though, you know, if you bought a weekly call spread of the money right now, you'd probably be"
"16739509","16742990"," fined by Friday close at 350, 55 or something. "
"16743650","16744750"," But you know how this goes, right?"
"16745009","16753070"," You wash the manipulation that comes into the market here is is this bottom, right?"
"16753790","16754970"," Or we bearish on the week."
"16755310","16759689"," It looks like we're going to be bullish in the week, but positioning matters."
"16760650","16764830"," So if we get, if we do get that weakness into the bell, it would be a nice dip buy,"
"16765009","16765130"," right?"
"16765130","16771230"," Some call spreads for Friday or even PJ traders come out, slam it down. "
"16772009","16775950"," And then that's the actual dip buy for a nice Friday run."
"16776330","16777710"," So just patience."
"16778410","16785290"," If you are a bull here, just as we said before, if you are looking for that dip buy, the"
"16785290","16791450"," best thing for you to be is above this hourly trigger with a successful back test of it to take"
"16791450","16793710"," that weekly trade to the upside. "
"16794090","16801590"," But otherwise, I'm going to err on the side of, I'm going to err on the side of just having"
"16801590","16809430"," some patience, hanging tight here, let the bears get all worked up and all fired up and look for"
"16809430","16811690"," that perfect buy here for the week."
"16813710","16815150"," See what you guys are saying out there."
"16818090","16818790"," Yeah, Chase. "
"16818790","16822470"," So Chase just bought, I don't know if he just did it, but he said, day trade and rent chop"
"16822470","16823130"," is too costly."
"16824030","16832390"," If you're a bull here, if you're looking for a weekly buy, you know, there's like a 65% chance"
"16832390","16836090"," that that weekly buy is either at the close or at the open tomorrow."
"16839410","16843950"," So if you're, if you're like, well, I think we're going up here cap at the three o'clock hour"
"16843950","16846210"," in the next 20 minutes, I can get down with that. "
"16846950","16848010"," Make it a call spread."
"16848150","16850250"," If you're going to do that, make it a little bit more closer in the money."
"16851470","16858270"," If you are risk adverse, you're waiting until you're either above the hourly trigger for a weekly"
"16858270","16859010"," call spread. "
"16860810","16864970"," Or you're looking for that nice, but you're looking for that nice capitulation on a weekly basis."
"16870290","16871350"," Happy new day to everybody."
"16871610","16872870"," Happy new day to all you guys out there. "
"16872950","16873150"," Absolutely."
"16873410","16874410"," It's not too late to have been here."
"16874490","16875170"," We're still the new year. "
"16875410","16880050"," The market, I said this early this morning, I don't know if you guys know this, but the market is"
"16880050","16882110"," not back yet."
"16882110","16886030"," The market won't restart until after this Friday."
"16886430","16890090"," So the way that the holidays ran this year, we get it on the back end. "
"16891050","16897550"," So a lot of people are still a lot of Wall Street is still on vacation until next month, or"
"16897550","16898590"," this upcoming Monday."
"16899470","16900870"," So this is a nice short week."
"16902390","16903450"," Just hang tight. "
"16903490","16908250"," You can actually see where, you know, low, low, low, low volume."
"16908250","16916030"," So this is still, you're still trading end of the year to some extent right now."
"16916470","16920470"," Yeah, happy new year to see something different. "
"16924510","16925530"," Yeah, just be patient."
"16925670","16931670"," If you're, if you're a bull, if you're a bull, just wait until you're above this hourly trigger and"
"16931670","16934370"," make sure you back test it, stick with your tools."
"16934370","16942610"," If not, the one fear for me here, the one fear for me here is, you know, they close it"
"16942610","16943270"," up here, right?"
"16944270","16946190"," So let's say they close it up here in the close. "
"16947630","16950850"," And you're seeing this as bullish, right?"
"16952790","16956010"," So what happens in a nice bull trap is this."
"16960400","16961800"," You'll get all bold up in here."
"16961820","16962820"," It's just 4 p.m., right?"
"16963020","16964160"," You'll get all bold up in here. "
"16964800","16966020"," You'll take it up here, right?"
"16967060","16969220"," But not close above the hourly trigger."
"16970640","16974820"," And they get up here like this and you're all bold up and you're, this is where the manipulation"
"16974820","16975840"," comes in, right?"
"16976560","16979780"," And you're all bold up and you're like, fuck yeah, this is awesome."
"16980160","16982600"," But you never beat those prior highs back there. "
"16983500","16988620"," These sellers come in over the night, overnight, and they sell it right back down on you."
"16988620","16993440"," So let's look at where the dealers are right now."
"16993440","16995260"," So it's 56 cents. "
"16995920","16999920"," Nine makes gasoline February futures, settle at $2.9 a gallon."
"17000000","17001260"," Here's Friday right here, right?"
"17001560","17002540"," So here's Friday, right?"
"17004160","17006940"," So just let me explain this in a better way here for you."
"17007080","17009980"," So there's, there's a bull trap in here. "
"17010260","17015380"," So it makes WTI crude February futures, settle at $70.38 a barrel."
"17015700","17019420"," That's down $1.27 or 1 spot, 77%."
"17020220","17021680"," So you figure, right?"
"17021840","17022620"," We sold Friday. "
"17022980","17024320"," We wake up this morning, right?"
"17024720","17025920"," We've got a failure right here."
"17026960","17028740"," And let's say we get the race up."
"17028860","17031480"," Let's say we do get the race up into the close up here, right?"
"17031480","17034420"," Boom, somewhere in here, the dealers are pretty neutral. "
"17034980","17040800"," And then what happens is after 4 p.m., you're thinking everything is great into Friday."
"17041500","17048220"," And what really happens is these sellers come right back in on you for Tuesday and you wake up"
"17048220","17053700"," Tuesday and we're actually down, down where the actual buy is in the week."
"17054060","17057200"," So be cautious in here. "
"17057400","17060580"," This is if we squeeze up bull traps waiting for you."
"17061140","17062840"," And what you really want is a bull."
"17062960","17064920"," I'm telling you, what you really want is a bull right now. "
"17064920","17074800"," It's either today, today or tomorrow to be buying either this gap closure down here or something"
"17074800","17076160"," right off that daily trigger."
"17076500","17081500"," It's your best trade."
"17083200","17090880"," Now, whether that comes tomorrow or it comes on Monday or Friday, Friday or Monday, that this is"
"17090880","17092700"," kind of like the no man's land down here. "
"17092740","17094200"," Don't be fucking around down here, okay?"
"17094820","17096680"," That's not the place we fucking around, if you're a bull."
"17099740","17104000"," I'd rather be buying something that's, I'd rather be buying this."
"17105300","17107720"," Something like this, I'd rather be buying, right?"
"17108180","17110980"," So it's like that I'm a buyer right there. "
"17111280","17112800"," The one in the five are coming up."
"17112800","17113900"," You're above the hourly trigger."
"17113900","17116060"," You back test it and we're off and running again, right?"
"17116400","17116920"," Situation normal. "
"17117400","17117840"," Looks great."
"17118900","17129020"," If not, I'd really like to be a buyer that's like sell"
"17129020","17130540"," all this down right here, right?"
"17131220","17132440"," You catch a bounce."
"17133420","17137000"," Your hourly trigger comes down, gets underneath, right?"
"17137360","17140820"," You get the squeeze, you come back down, you get the one in five minute trigger down here. "
"17141580","17143520"," I'd rather be a buyer right there as well."
"17143800","17148300"," So I'd rather be a buyer right there or I'd rather be a buyer up here with all that stuff."
"17148300","17149540"," There's stuff in here. "
"17149920","17152960"," This is where you get, if you're a bull, right?"
"17153140","17157420"," This is where you lose, I'm always telling you guys you want to win nine trades."
"17158140","17159340"," You want to win seven trades."
"17160640","17165780"," This is, this right buying this right here is your three out of 10 trade winner, five out of 10"
"17165780","17168840"," trade winner, two out of 10 trade winner. "
"17170240","17171040"," Not the place for you."
"17171620","17175520"," If I was a bear, they're doing what they're supposed to do, right?"
"17175620","17177560"," Look at this one from a seller's perspective, right?"
"17178300","17179840"," They sold the hourly trigger here."
"17180120","17181900"," They sold the hourly trigger here, right?"
"17182760","17185400"," And they just sold the half hour trigger right here. "
"17185600","17189720"," So if anyone's in control right now, who is it?"
"17190380","17190980"," It's the bears."
"17191440","17192440"," Sellers are in control."
"17193500","17195360"," They're teeing off right where they should. "
"17195920","17196820"," Sold this, sold this."
"17197040","17199760"," This morning we talked about that half hour trigger, right?"
"17199940","17204300"," We talked about it again in the middle of the day, but even Bork McGork I think said that he"
"17204300","17205420"," sold that half hour trigger."
"17205980","17207960"," If you're sell side, you're doing it. "
"17208140","17211160"," We're staircaseing it down just like the should be done."
"17211400","17213300"," So just be patient."
"17213520","17215740"," If you're a bull be patient, if you're a bear, stay short. "
"17216680","17222180"," As a matter of fact, if you're a bear and you get short and they squeeze this close, you are"
"17222180","17226940"," still in control of this to sell down into the open on Wednesday tomorrow."
"17229000","17230660"," Just be patient here if you're a bull."
"17234380","17236020"," I know you don't want to hear that. "
"17236080","17241320"," I know I bet you're all like, I'm going to guess here that a bunch of you were day traders"
"17241320","17241720"," alike."
"17242240","17244260"," Come back and come back to New Year's."
"17244340","17245060"," We're going to smack this. "
"17245360","17246880"," We're going to get that SPX new high."
"17247340","17248000"," Wrap it up for the week."
"17248820","17249420"," Party in the weekend. "
"17252040","17253980"," Let it cool off a little bit."
"17262740","17263880"," Get some of that demand."
"17264280","17265560"," Fill some of that demand down here. "
"17269090","17269870"," Thanks, legend."
"17270130","17270810"," I appreciate it, brother."
"17272840","17274560"," Do I put any weights on a one-hour chart?"
"17274860","17274980"," No. "
"17275760","17276940"," Well, yes and no."
"17277160","17278260"," So I had a good question."
"17278480","17279120"," I'll answer that question. "
"17279780","17280520"," So here's the deal."
"17281480","17291340"," The stock market trades, in my view, on a one-minute chart, 30-minute chart, and a one-day chart."
"17291580","17294440"," Those three charts are what the market trades on, okay?"
"17295620","17300220"," The stock market day is on the half-hour of every regular hour. "
"17300480","17306320"," So 9.30, 10.30, 10.30, 11.30, 11.30 to 12.30, so on, so forth."
"17307340","17309000"," Now, saying all of that, okay?"
"17310700","17318400"," I do as a whole in a mathematical equation, weight."
"17319600","17326900"," I give weightings to a five-minute chart, a 15-minute chart, a one-hour chart, a four-hour chart. "
"17327900","17337780"," I do use a mathematical equation to weight those time frames for length of"
"17337780","17340620"," time of upper downside moves."
"17341140","17343060"," So we'll look at that right now, hang tight."
"17345600","17347400"," Give me one quick second here. "
"17350760","17352100"," That's a good one to look at."
"17352100","17354400"," So outside of that stuff, right?"
"17356760","17362120"," Here is a chart of SPX, okay?"
"17362700","17365120"," And on this chart, I have right now what?"
"17365320","17366160"," What do I got sitting on there?"
"17367000","17371620"," I got an EMA, 27 an EMA, 50, but that should be different."
"17374120","17377820"," 50, this should be, let's call this 129, okay?"
"17382420","17386120"," See, we got, I got the 129, the 27, the 6."
"17386560","17390120"," Here's a little New Year's gift for you, okay?"
"17391560","17393060"," So this is SPX, right?"
"17393820","17394560"," It's a one-minute chart. "
"17396220","17398080"," As a matter of fact, we'll just get rid of that little red."
"17398240","17404200"," This one right here is meant for me for the power and trend on the time frame that I'm on,"
"17404520","17405700"," but this is really what you want."
"17406420","17412900"," So you see how you've got the white lines below the red line and the prices below, right?"
"17413780","17415660"," This is on a one-minute time frame right here. "
"17416460","17422880"," You can design your own mathematical equation for this, but if you wanted to trade, say, a five "
"17422880","17424780","-minute chart, you can do the same stuff here."
"17425140","17430480"," And you can actually wait on a one-minute basis, how bearish are we?"
"17430620","17432400"," And a five-minute basis, how bearish are we?"
"17432700","17435100"," So let's look at this right now with a trend, okay?"
"17435600","17438100"," So on a one-minute basis, we are bearish, right?"
"17438100","17445320"," We've got a bear cross above, we have a confirmation here and prices below the 27 EMA and the 120 "
"17445320","17445940","-90 EMA."
"17446540","17450080"," So we are bearish on a one-minute basis, on a five-minute basis. "
"17451060","17454300"," We had the cross above here, confirmation of five-minute basis."
"17454700","17458620"," We're bearish, double, double bottom here so far on SPX."
"17459420","17466160"," Let's look at a 15-minute basis next and we are, we just got a 15-minute bear cross and"
"17466160","17468800"," a confirmation of 15-minute basis, right?"
"17469040","17475700"," So on each basis, we can project or you can project how bearish we are. "
"17475900","17478400"," So right now, we're pretty bearish on a 15-minute basis."
"17479060","17483680"," The expectation would be that we're going to go and test these prior lows back here, where my"
"17483680","17485760"," cursor is right down here, okay?"
"17486140","17488440"," We're likely going to trade this on a 15-minute basis."
"17489200","17490800"," Now, we know that, right?"
"17491120","17491940"," We know that right now. "
"17491940","17495900"," Let's now look at a 30-minute basis and we are not bearish."
"17496180","17497840"," We do not have a bear cross."
"17498420","17500680"," We do not have a cross here, do we?"
"17500840","17506860"," We do not have, it's forming, but it hasn't confirmed yet, has it, right?"
"17507100","17508240"," We haven't confirmed it. "
"17508420","17510220"," So we haven't had that cross."
"17511100","17514880"," We haven't back-checked it for more downside to come, right?"
"17515060","17517360"," So remember, we just talked about a 15-minute basis here."
"17517820","17520840"," We're likely going to trade that on a 15-minute basis, right?"
"17520840","17524000"," We have not confirmed this here, right?"
"17524340","17526100"," Trade that 15-minute bear. "
"17526520","17532820"," Come back up here and then you still need the confirmation on a 30-minute basis to trade what?"
"17533640","17535280"," That one right there, makes sense."
"17536200","17539520"," So we're not fully bearish here in a half hour yet, are we?"
"17539960","17542240"," And then let's look at a one-mile time frame here."
"17542580","17543400"," And what do we have here?"
"17544000","17545420"," Not bearish at all. "
"17545840","17554280"," We have no hourly bear cross, but if we did, let's say we had let's say we had a, let's"
"17554280","17558760"," say price action looks like this at some point, right?"
"17559580","17563860"," Let's say price action, we go down, we break below, one here."
"17564700","17567760"," Say price action shows us we break below here, right?"
"17569240","17573020"," And then we come back up over here, whoop, whoop, whoop, right?"
"17573780","17578400"," And then we begin to consolidate, right?"
"17579120","17582960"," On an hourly basis, we're not able to get above, the bulls are weak in here."
"17584340","17594000"," At this point right here, if the bulls have no will here, I would then come out to you and"
"17594000","17599720"," say, well, we're about to confirm a bear cross on a one-hour basis. "
"17600120","17609200"," You're going to expect on an hourly basis one to three days, possibly a week to the downside, and"
"17609200","17616800"," we're going to be then targeting 45, 55, and more than likely, 45, 50 down here, makes sense."
"17618000","17621880"," So the hour chart does help with that, right?"
"17622700","17627520"," Now, you'll see guys out there say, I'm super fucking bearish, we're going to crash."
"17628520","17635760"," You can't confirm that until we go to a four-hour basis to look at these lows down here at"
"17635760","17639000"," 4300, 4400 to close that gap. "
"17639540","17642300"," And then again, even on a one-minute on a one-day basis."
"17642660","17645160"," $25.89 a pound, that's down."
"17645160","17651000"," Now saying that, let's say you're a swing trader, right?"
"17651680","17657680"," If you're going to close this up here, if you're a swing trader, and you like to trade these higher"
"17657680","17659120"," timeframes, right?"
"17659120","17664940"," Let's say you're a bull and you want to swing a trade, a one-to-three-month trade. "
"17665600","17666440"," What are you looking to buy?"
"17666800","17670740"," You're looking to buy down here, 46, 57 is what you're trying to buy."
"17671300","17673320"," You're actually trying to buy this right here, right?"
"17674200","17681500"," And you're looking back in time on the hourly and four-hour basis to see if we break above that"
"17681500","17690080"," one-hour trigger and that whatever to show bullishness, so if you end up seeing"
"17690080","17698960"," this blood down here and you're looking to buy a one-to-three-month call, you're not just going to"
"17698960","17701140"," automatically buy that white line, right?"
"17701320","17709400"," You want to make sure that we trade back above on a one-hour for our basis, showing proof, right?"
"17710060","17713980"," We can break above this here, come back down here, and then you're off and running with your one "
"17713980","17715620","-hour bull trade."
"17716720","17722720"," So that's when I would use that time frame, that one minute, that five minute, that 15, that's half "
"17722720","17725100","-hour, the one-hour, the four-hour, and the daily. "
"17726820","17732340"," If you know how to do this, right, and if you set an alarm on your phone, let's say once"
"17732340","17740680"," a week, and you are aware of higher timeframes and you know how bullish or bearish we are on every"
"17740680","17747400"," time frame, you can make informed and educated decisions on your bullishness or bearishness."
"17748100","17754040"," So even where price is today, if someone today was going to tell you, hey, we're going to crash,"
"17755060","17755820"," right?"
"17756060","17756820"," I would say no."
"17758020","17761000"," And as a matter of fact, I'll show you some examples here. "
"17761780","17764580"," You know how people call for crashes and shit like that?"
"17764720","17766580"," They're like the stock market's going to crash, right?"
"17766800","17768780"," Crash, not correct, crash."
"17769460","17771900"," So let's look at a weekly basis here, right?"
"17773200","17774560"," This is a weekly basis."
"17775000","17776980"," This is corrective behavior back here, right?"
"17777120","17779980"," Did we get a cross of this white and red line?"
"17780440","17781240"," We did not. "
"17781580","17784340"," We had price cross but not the white and red line, right?"
"17784960","17788640"," When was the last time we did get a weekly cross?"
"17789120","17789580"," Take a guess."
"17791100","17793460"," January, March of 22."
"17794600","17798760"," So you can actually see right in here, right?"
"17798760","17805440"," We confirm on a weekly basis, they have a major downturn coming. "
"17806220","17814520"," So you could predict back here in May of 2022 that we're going to crash and it's going to be"
"17814520","17817920"," sustained for a long period of time."
"17818400","17821560"," And let's look at some other prior examples in past history here."
"17821940","17823960"," You don't see us crossing here, right?"
"17824320","17829380"," No crosses here, no crosses here, in a weekly basis, no crosses here, in a weekly basis. "
"17830320","17834280"," So when you're looking for some like real major downside moves, last one was in here, right?"
"17834660","17834660"," 82."
"17835640","17839000"," So major, major, major moves down, even down here."
"17839780","17841200"," 88, we pulled back up, right?"
"17841420","17842060"," Pulled back up. "
"17842500","17843860"," Pulled back up over here."
"17844980","17846500"," This is SPX, by the way."
"17847320","17848660"," And right here we have one, right?"
"17848820","17849260"," This is 2001. "
"17850360","17852560"," You can actually see it, right?"
"17852720","17857520"," You could have called a crash here and the same thing goes for 2007, right?"
"17858200","17863440"," You could have called a crash right there for sustained downside to come."
"17863640","17869660"," One of the greatest gifts that Jerome gave you guys was one of the greatest gifts Jerome Powell"
"17869660","17875080"," gave you guys was time so that we did not cross and smash lower."
"17875580","17885560"," So be careful when you're out there as a, you can tell"
"17885560","17887380"," who knows what they're talking about. "
"17887520","17892320"," If we're going to have a crash or not, you can tell who is talking out of their ass without"
"17892320","17902000"," price action proving, price action proving that we've confirmed sustained downward move"
"17902000","17912860"," for two, three, four months or major lows, right?"
"17928390","17930830"," No, it's not a rejection of all-time highs."
"17931210","17939870"," I'm looking, so these algorithms, from these algorithms, I am looking for that the ATH on SPX."
"17940590","17944710"," And for me, it's more, Busowitz is asking, is it was that a rejection of all-time highs?"
"17945530","17946470"," Fuck no, it's not. "
"17947490","17952230"," It's more, it's more of like how the market runs, right?"
"17952410","17956030"," We're, you rip higher, let's say we go up 100 points, right?"
"17956450","17957810"," Or 300 points, right?"
"17958870","17961190"," People get excited, right?"
"17961350","17964190"," They get excited, like let's load into the market, let's get up there, right?"
"17965390","17973950"," You feel that high and you end up feeling that high and you need some more skin, excuse me, skin"
"17973950","17978790"," in the game and you're not going to get skin for another five or 10 points."
"17979090","17986690"," So you pull back down and then you get the demand that you need to get you over the edge."
"17987150","17989730"," I also want to remember, I want you guys to remember something, okay?"
"17990450","17992450"," I want you guys to remember something. "
"17992850","17998150"," There are timeframes for a lot of stuff out there like there's like time."
"17998330","18000230"," Time is a big thing no one likes to talk about."
"18000910","18002470"," This stock market goes up. "
"18002470","18007750"," It's gone up since 1897, you know, it's always gone up."
"18007890","18011630"," Even in depression, COVID doesn't matter, it goes up."
"18012070","18020330"," If we trade up to that SPX prior high from early 2022 and we're already up here, the chances of"
"18020330","18022490"," us not tagging it are very low. "
"18023370","18027950"," If you look on a, if you look on a, let me see if I can bring this up again."
"18036160","18042160"," Everyone wants like a trick, you know, like how fuck the bulls, fuck this, fuck that."
"18042480","18056800"," You can be a great winner as a, as a, here's"
"18056800","18058440"," the top tick right now, right?"
"18059740","18060260"," SPX. "
"18060980","18062520"," Here's the top tick on SPX."
"18063400","18068320"," You see how close we are to, this is the high right here, right?"
"18068560","18069200"," You can't see that."
"18071060","18071780"," Hold on here. "
"18075800","18078800"," So here's the, here's the high right here, okay?"
"18080000","18082360"," From January 2022, okay?"
"18083200","18085180"," Look at how close we are to it right now."
"18088180","18090440"," This is on a weekly basis right here, right?"
"18090760","18092020"," It's way, way back here."
"18092380","18095100"," Now, let's, let's take a look back in history, right?"
"18097280","18103120"," And you know, like, you kind of go up there and tag it. "
"18103200","18106580"," This one you didn't, but a year or two later you did, right?"
"18107360","18113260"," So if you just look historically back in time, and sometimes you do, sometimes you don't, right?"
"18113620","18114860"," But it's still rare."
"18115260","18121220"," It's, it's so rare that, let's see, we go to one year here, 12 months, I think I was looking"
"18121220","18122380"," at a six month the other day."
"18122620","18122720"," Hold on. "
"18128850","18133490"," You see all, I'm not going to delete all this stuff, but you see how there's a six month basis"
"18133490","18134110"," right here."
"18134530","18136610"," No, you get this giant push up, right?"
"18136970","18140530"," And if you want to say, yeah, for this six months we're going lower, I can agree with you."
"18141090","18144970"," But that next swing high, we tend to at least take it out. "
"18145410","18149470"," We may not, but you know, you got a lot of buyers here, man."
"18149610","18151550"," This is a six month basis right here, right?"
"18152270","18153770"," Look at these bars here."
"18154110","18155170"," This is not weakness. "
"18155690","18156110"," You see that?"
"18156510","18160650"," Give indecision candle on a six month basis, but then you got a buyers and buyers."
"18161270","18166650"," Typically, we'll go up there and smash it and then do the role at, at worst case scenario."
"18167410","18172550"," We can even go higher, but you know, like worst case scenario, tend to go up there and smash it. "
"18173410","18179150"," So this weakness on a one day basis, look at just look at this, this one candle here."
"18179710","18185870"," This is a six month candle weakness on a on January 2nd or a failure to attain it last month."
"18186710","18190050"," I would be very wary of us not getting up there. "
"18190310","18195690"," And we have the magnet still believe it or not to go up there for that collar and tag it."
"18195830","18199550"," So just be careful here with careful drinking the Kool-Aid out there just yet."
"18201770","18209150"," On the market on one day performance or even a week or two performance of the stock market here, so"
"18209150","18210590"," hold on here. "
"18216450","18225770"," When you're zooming out, when you're zooming out on, when you zoom out a little bit, right now it"
"18225770","18231250"," looks more like we're just looking for some, a good buy-in."
"18232210","18233010"," Buyers are there."
"18233350","18234410"," I want you guys to know that. "
"18234450","18241210"," I want you guys to know fully that no one's scared, no one doesn't want to buy."
"18242790","18246890"," Everyone's either, everybody's either swimming in the pool or they want to be swimming in the pool."
"18248090","18253390"," So though I think we do have a significant low in March. "
"18254470","18263170"," I would not blink if we turned around a week or two and we're trading the SPX all time high,"
"18263270","18264750"," I wouldn't be shocked is my point."
"18265670","18270430"," I wouldn't be shocked if that happened this week, next week, something like that."
"18271830","18278590"," So if you're a bear and you think we had a failure, a doom and gloom, you just keep being"
"18278590","18280470"," tactful here. "
"18281210","18287990"," You trade down your daily trigger, you wait for the hourly to cross below the daily, you then trade"
"18287990","18295350"," the daily trigger down to the weekly trigger and you are an efficient market operator."
"18296250","18304150"," And then only after we get underneath the monthly trigger, do we begin to talk about a big bear"
"18304150","18308270"," township, like we're going to 3500, 3800, all that kind of stuff."
"18309290","18310690"," And I'll give it to you at that point. "
"18310770","18314310"," I'll be like, yeah, you're right, we are fucking in full bear mode and all that kind of stuff."
"18323820","18325280"," Yeah, Jim can call for a crash."
"18326060","18330360"," I don't think you technically can have, I'm going to show you guys some stuff here. "
"18330580","18333560"," Hold on a second tight arrow."
"18333820","18334640"," I'll show you guys something here."
"18335200","18344380"," So if you want anything of, if you want, in my view here, okay, if you want, here we see"
"18344380","18345160"," we're going to bring this up here. "
"18349540","18352980"," I'm going to show you guys something here that's in the report for this year, right?"
"18356620","18363180"," So we're going to look at what matters here, okay, what matters, truly what matters."
"18366580","18379570"," We're going"
"18379570","18381050"," to show you guys two things here."
"18381270","18383290"," So this is actually in my report. "
"18384210","18389030"," And I want to show you guys this, okay, this is so fucking important."
"18397330","18398750"," So, so important."
"18405350","18408830"," I'm just going to add this funds rate. "
"18411450","18414930"," This is really the big, these are the two, these are the two biggest you need to know."
"18415030","18419650"," If you wanted to dumb down your trading, you need to know two things, your fed funds rates and your"
"18419650","18426590"," rate of unemployment and your, you want to know your rate of inflation, okay."
"18428590","18432170"," So this is your rate of inflation down here, all right. "
"18432910","18435630"," And these matter to you."
"18436690","18438450"," Normally how they matter is this."
"18438630","18439890"," Normally what happens is this. "
"18441470","18447390"," You want to, I want to see this here, okay, gather around your computers right now, okay."
"18448730","18458370"," So historically what you are looking for is you are looking for fed funds rate to flatten"
"18458370","18468350"," and to cuts to begin, okay, right around there like within a month of the first cuts, you will see"
"18468350","18469850"," the market begin to sell."
"18470850","18474590"," This is even if we raise rates in the future, okay. "
"18474670","18476890"," So it could be just one rate cut doesn't matter."
"18477650","18481750"," Even if they raise rates in a month or six months or a year, it doesn't matter."
"18482090","18483770"," You're looking for a rate cut. "
"18484470","18493070"," The next thing that you're looking for is for the unemployment rate to begin to trade between four"
"18493070","18493930"," and six percent."
"18495310","18504370"," You're also looking for a touch and go of inflation at that two percent, touch two percent and go,"
"18504710","18505950"," okay."
"18506610","18513630"," This is like a trifecta right here for a market crash, not a correction, not a pullback, not"
"18513630","18514590"," trading 4100. "
"18515350","18520570"," Now gems, I don't know what gems calling for, maybe his, I don't know if he means 4100."
"18521730","18524830"," I don't know if he means 3,800, 3,900."
"18525750","18527430"," I don't know if he means 20%. "
"18527430","18532430"," I don't know what, what Gem is saying to you guys out there, but I can assure you of, I"
"18532430","18533490"," can assure you of something."
"18534870","18536970"," Fuck the inverted yield curve."
"18537630","18540830"," What really matters to you is this kind of an action in here. "
"18541450","18543350"," You'll start to see the rate cuts come in."
"18543470","18545150"," You can actually see the bloodbath down here."
"18545290","18547210"," You can actually see the unemployment rate down here. "
"18547930","18550690"," And you can see the same action back in here."
"18550830","18556250"," You can actually see this topping action here, this last crash right here."
"18556750","18558490"," You see rates start to get cut. "
"18558830","18566250"," You see a ramp of unemployment and you start to see the tag of two percent on inflation, then"
"18566250","18568190"," inflation rising, okay."
"18568650","18570010"," Same thing happened back here."
"18570170","18573010"," This is back in 2002 or 2007, 2008. "
"18574030","18575530"," Here's another one back here."
"18576810","18578570"," Same situation back here."
"18578630","18579630"," You got this topping here. "
"18579870","18580850"," Rates begin to get cut."
"18581250","18587950"," You start to see the unemployment ramp and you start to see inflation dropping down to that 2%."
"18587950","18591270"," We actually went even lower than 2% in 2001, 2002. "
"18592530","18595390"," You can check this at home on your own, okay."
"18596030","18597770"," And you're going to look up the Fed funds rate."
"18598130","18600570"," You're going to set it up in a separate window. "
"18601110","18604570"," You set it up with the unemployment rates and the rate of inflation."
"18605470","18609370"," And you can track this going back to the beginning of the stock market."
"18609690","18614150"," Now, this is why you can't trust the inverted yield curve. "
"18614950","18619970"," Because the inverted yield curve, the Fed can manipulate that whenever they like."
"18620190","18623750"," What they can't, what they can't fuck with is this trifecta right here."
"18624610","18632190"," The only other thing that would come your way as a bear, if it wasn't these three macro things,"
"18632710","18641230"," right, as a cash market trader or as an overnight trader, as a stock market trader, what matters to"
"18641230","18643750"," you is these three right here, generally speaking, okay. "
"18644270","18651070"," Now, you'll get weakness and stuff from the yield curve, but not the crash you're looking for."
"18651070","18657670"," The or for that crash you're looking for would be something like an unknown event, i.e. COVID,"
"18658230","18658310"," right?"
"18658970","18663090"," i.e. fraud becomes public in the market, right?"
"18663370","18667550"," Like, I don't know, a big bank goes on CNBC and says we need cash."
"18668730","18674890"," Regional banks start to implode or a war breaks out that we don't already price in. "
"18675110","18677010"," And I mean like a war we don't know about."
"18677890","18687830"," Something that even if JPM had an office could not predict World Trade Center, stuff like that."
"18688090","18697450"," Outside of that, you should not see that crash that you're talking about the meaningful crash that"
"18697450","18698410"," you're talking about. "
"18698690","18706090"," So let's look at this JEM is calling for a crash, right?"
"18707390","18710510"," That's 14% to 4100."
"18711210","18714050"," That's not a crash, so no, I don't see it."
"18714590","18723830"," Crash right here from where we are, JEM would have to be calling for 3,800, a trade to 3 "
"18723830","18724190",",800. "
"18725330","18730950"," I think you get 4,100, 4,200 by March 17th."
"18731770","18736130"," I'm calling for that, so maybe he wants that extra two or three hundred points."
"18737510","18745570"," I do see the 4,100 by end of quarter for SPX, but that's still to me not a crash. "
"18746630","18748430"," It's only a corrective environment."
"18749670","18757150"," For JEM to get that crash in my view, he would need the Fed to start cutting rates and you"
"18757150","18763250"," need to see a rampant unemployment and you need to see a touch and go on the rate of inflation."
"18764230","18767150"," So I'm not on that trade just yet. "
"18767730","18771390"," It can't be on that trade unless I see those other things happen."
"18772050","18776550"," A history is on my side that you need those things to take place."
"18778450","18783390"," You need those for those things to take place for to make that call. "
"18784830","18789610"," And I know that I know the bond market's betting on that taking place that we're going to get rate"
"18789610","18790570"," cuts and all that stuff."
"18791210","18792210"," I don't see it."
"18792370","18792890"," I don't see it. "
"18793050","18793970"," I don't see them doing it."
"18794130","18800550"," So I think that they, they, I don't think they cut rates until after the election."
"18801250","18804830"," And I think you're also going to see, we have another problem too. "
"18806030","18810730"," If because of the presidential election, we're screaming higher."
"18811090","18813230"," Let's say into the first or into March."
"18814270","18821610"," The general public is going to be calling for more rate increases, which would be counter counter"
"18821610","18824430"," to what the market price would say. "
"18825890","18827590"," There's a guy in our group here."
"18827750","18828670"," His name is Jimmy Berry."
"18830390","18833330"," Jimmy Berry talks about this every few months. "
"18833990","18838190"," Kim and I will have conversations about are we actually going to get rate cuts."
"18839150","18842450"," And there is a mechanic of the market right now."
"18842850","18849470"," Like when you see, when you see people like Fundstrat call for 6,000, I see why they're calling for"
"18849470","18849650"," it. "
"18849870","18851910"," I see why Fundstrat's calling for that."
"18852590","18862530"," It's because whatever this this pullback is into March, if we're not cutting rates, it should only"
"18862530","18863230"," be corrective."
"18863950","18871950"," So if it is only corrective and we begin to trade up in the 5,200 into the election, and"
"18871950","18875910"," we have this exuberance into March because of the election. "
"18877490","18882250"," If we get that right, you get that exuberance and all that, it would be hard for the Fed to"
"18882250","18887610"," not raise rates in March, January, March in a significant way."
"18889190","18894270"," Now that would lead, of course, to downside to the market, but corrective, not the crash."
"18896270","18906150"," In this report, I'm going to show you examples of the Fed raising for multiple years and the market"
"18906150","18908510"," just fucking grinding higher. "
"18909490","18916770"," We had an episode of it that took place in the 90s that actually led to the dot com crash."
"18917630","18922350"," And it's all this is going to come into the Fed's power here."
"18923750","18930230"," We really are handing the market over to the Fed at some point, unless we have one of those unknown"
"18930230","18937310"," events to the market, in my view, or at least historically, we the bears really need the Fed to cut"
"18937310","18937570"," rates. "
"18937570","18943470"," They really need something unknown and not priced into hit the market in the tape."
"18943690","18944590"," They really do they need it."
"18948220","18950060"," Yeah, you know, Jimmy Barry's got a point. "
"18950600","18954300"," I was able to work out where Jimmy Barry would be right."
"18954500","18955960"," I'm like, shit, he has a chance."
"18956600","18965900"," And what's really fucking crazy here too is whenever they do make those rate cuts, it's going to"
"18965900","18967020"," get fucking ugly. "
"18967720","18969540"," It's going to get really fucking ugly."
"18969820","18974280"," It's going to we're going to have a likely a major crash like 0708 like 01."
"18974940","18977200"," You're likely going to see it last. "
"18977680","18979080"," So there's some other shit at play here."
"18979100","18983580"," You got an 18 year housing cycle that ends in 2026."
"18984520","18986640"," The last one was in 0708. "
"18987340","18989460"," They have 18 year housing market cycles."
"18989900","18991460"," They kind of line up with that."
"18992520","19000040"," If you're a bull out there, you might only have one more dip by this year. "
"19000780","19010700"," And if the Fed ever did cut rates in late 2024 or in 25 or 26 or"
"19010700","19015060"," anything of that time period, you could see a reset for kids."
"19015500","19020080"," If you're a kid out there too, by the way, if you're young listening to this program right now,"
"19020480","19030000"," however that plays out, however that plays out, the mechanics of this plays out, you are likely"
"19030000","19039180"," getting a great reset in the next one to, I don't think now you're getting it, but I think you're"
"19039180","19043420"," going to get a great reset whenever they cut those rates."
"19043940","19049860"," You're going to whenever that I think those rate cuts come, you are getting a great reset, which is"
"19049860","19050560"," good for you. "
"19051060","19059100"," If you're a young person, the Fed is likely going to trigger one big wash where you're going to get"
"19059100","19060700"," that great buy in."
"19061280","19067780"," Now in that report that I wrote, there are consequences for older people."
"19069020","19076100"," You're going to have to decide when you downsize your homes, if you can live through a full,"
"19076340","19082360"," another full cycle, that could be another 10 or 15 year period that you're going to have to keep"
"19082360","19082660"," working. "
"19082660","19087220"," So depending on how old you are, do you want to, you know, do you want out between now and"
"19087220","19094260"," then, or are you going to downsize before, or can you weather that 10 or 15 year period where"
"19094260","19095800"," you'll be back on the top again."
"19096220","19102700"," So there's a lot of mechanics at play for young people and old people coming up in the next couple"
"19102700","19103020"," of years."
"19105820","19107140"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. "
"19107320","19111560"," There's a grand, I don't know if I'd call it a grand super cycle that's going to be as bad"
"19111560","19117160"," as the 1930s, or 1940s, that kind of stuff."
"19117500","19122200"," But without a doubt, there is a big super cycle starting."
"19122820","19127680"," Well, I don't know if that's a shorter long term debt cycle, but there is a short or long term"
"19127680","19129480"," debt cycle setting up for the youth. "
"19131660","19134560"," And it's all going to matter on when those rates get cut."
"19134900","19135580"," It really is."
"19136260","19141740"," I think it's after the election, but that's, that's what I think it is. "
"19141940","19151540"," And it would also line up with a Republican winning office to start that next greed cycle, that"
"19151540","19152040"," kind of stuff."
"19152380","19160450"," So, yeah, there's, I want you guys to know something here."
"19160550","19168770"," So I own property, I own vehicles, and I'm making decisions the past"
"19168770","19178670"," two or three weeks I've been have a conferencing with my attorneys, conferencing with my"
"19178670","19189410"," bank, conferencing with my wife on some major life decisions, and when to, when"
"19189410","19196790"," to trigger those major life decisions, and you know how that plays out. "
"19196990","19205870"," So, and we're doing, like we're doing the math, you know, do I just leave rentals on or is it"
"19205870","19211410"," more profitable to exit the ownership of those rentals and look for cheaper rentals?"
"19212450","19216970"," But I don't have one problem with this is I need the fed, right now I need the fed to"
"19216970","19218510"," cut so that I can exit."
"19219710","19228550"," If the fed doesn't cut and keeps pausing and slowly increasing rates over five years, I could be"
"19228550","19229530"," too early too."
"19229970","19234150"," So, just be like, just be patient. "
"19235170","19244810"," I think the the key thing here would be be patient and watch the fed closely, not who's betting,"
"19245030","19245770"," not the bond market."
"19245970","19247570"," Don't be watching all these other fucks out there."
"19247830","19256550"," I'm not, this isn't a gem either, but I mean like be really careful with people telling you that"
"19256550","19257310"," have no skin. "
"19258090","19258890"," Be really careful."
"19259350","19263150"," I want you guys to know, man, if you have wealth, it's different."
"19263550","19265910"," A lot of what I read on bent to it. "
"19266470","19272870"," A lot of what I see in the chat sometimes, like it's either different."
"19273990","19283990"," Sometimes I tell you that people have different motivations or different goals, right?"
"19285370","19293850"," In terms of a crash or a reset, people with money are waiting for specific things to take place in"
"19293850","19294350"," the background."
"19294690","19299730"," Like if I want to sell these fucking houses, dude, I'm scared. "
"19300710","19305370"," And I can't because I need that cut to come."
"19305530","19310650"," I need to know that we're we're putting in motion the reset."
"19311270","19319070"," And until we do historically, uh, the bond market can cry, whine, bet, do whatever they want to do. "
"19319950","19322610"," Uh, then it can say do whatever they want to do."
"19322670","19331550"," But, um, we can try to, we, the bond market can attempt to uh, uh, front run it, right?"
"19331890","19334470"," They can like front run rate cuts for 2024."
"19335090","19337510"," But if those rate cuts don't come, the market goes higher. "
"19337830","19339850"," It literally turns around and starts straight and higher."
"19340430","19345690"," So, uh, you know, it's like a, it's like a game of cat and mouse."
"19346510","19354170"," And right now, uh, I, I'm unwilling to like stand back there and see the market just fucking grind"
"19354170","19356070"," for another five years. "
"19356070","19360690"," If that's the fucking fed decides they're going to do try to find Jimmy Barry at some point."
"19360790","19365430"," If you guys are out there right now, whenever you see Jimmy Barry in here in a chat, try to"
"19365430","19370070"," get him on the side somewhere and talk to him about it because he'll explain it to you as well."
"19372350","19373090"," Oh, he's here. "
"19373290","19374150"," He's here right now."
"19375050","19376350"," He just said the fed cuts rates."
"19376350","19377430"," It'll be to save the banks. "
"19377470","19381590"," And that will be because the broke system, when they took the rates to zero, when the fed, uh,"
"19381710","19383990"," fed's not cutting until inflation is at its lows."
"19384290","19384810"," I'm with you, Jimmy."
"19385670","19388670"," Um, you'll see like, it'll be like a touch and go. "
"19389150","19393590"," So you'll see what you guys are going to see is like a bunch of scam."
"19393970","19394150"," Okay."
"19394230","19395530"," It's, it's a, it's fraud. "
"19396750","19400750"," The fed will touch two percent when they want to touch two percent."
"19401330","19404930"," It'd be like a plane making a touchdown and then go higher."
"19405730","19406630"," I'm with Jimmy on this. "
"19406870","19408410"," I think then you'll see the rate cuts."
"19408970","19412570"," You'll see unemployment ramping up to four, six percent at the same time."
"19413370","19418670"," And then what you're going to see is, uh, I wrote this in the report, no Joe Donut seen it"
"19418670","19420290"," quincey in the report at this point. "
"19420630","19430590"," I said that it would be a regional sized banks that collapse"
"19430590","19432130"," over commercial real estate."
"19432530","19438370"," In my view, my personal opinion is later down the road, you'll see that everybody out looking for"
"19438370","19440130"," money, these banks will be out there looking for money."
"19440650","19443510"," And, uh, that's when you'll be like, that's why they were cutting rates. "
"19444510","19444950"," Right."
"19445250","19446150"," Something was broken."
"19446870","19447290"," Right. "
"19447510","19449390"," That's how we, that's how we get back to that."
"19449750","19452750"," Something was broken statement that you hear about the past."
"19453910","19458450"," Uh, they can, I'm telling you guys, man, the fucking fed in the treasury department can fucking,"
"19458830","19461670"," they can, they can take the inverted yield curve, right?"
"19461890","19463510"," And just fucking manipulate it. "
"19463850","19467870"," They can take unemployment, manipulate it, jobs, manipulate it."
"19467950","19472110"," They can scan this whole fucking thing inflation, manipulate it."
"19472890","19473530"," I'll try. "
"19473670","19477990"," I got, I got a, I'm a video, I'm going to post for you guys of a hedge fund, this"
"19477990","19479490"," woman from a hedge fund in New Mexico."
"19479610","19487710"," And she point blank says, she goes, I am friends with a guy that is hired to fudge those numbers."
"19488010","19494650"," So they will manipulate this fucking market, uh, as long as they can, unless, uh, something, uh,"
"19494930","19496630"," unless something unknown to it happens. "
"19496910","19503530"," So if you're a bear, you are looking for one of two things for that reset that you're talking"
"19503530","19504210"," about, right?"
"19504430","19506190"," You're looking for one of two things at this point."
"19506370","19513470"," We're looking for, um, the mechanics of unemployment inflation and fed rate cuts, right?"
"19513670","19514190"," That's your one."
"19514690","19516470"," That's the one thing you're looking for. "
"19516750","19524730"," If you don't see that, you're basing everything on a hope and a prayer on non-priced in events to"
"19524730","19525150"," the market."
"19525370","19533510"," Volmageddon, uh, war, terrorism, you name it, uh, and it can't be known about like, that's the"
"19533510","19536390"," other thing here is like banks know about a lot of shit out there."
"19536910","19539970"," It has to be unknown to the market, truly unknown. "
"19541270","19544810"," I think of, uh, think of Goldman Sachs and JPM, like the CIA."
"19545850","19551030"," Uh, yeah, I don't know how many books you've read about the, uh, these operators, these bankers,"
"19551030","19554650"," but these bankers have biographies and autobiographies that they write."
"19554890","19559430"," And if you read enough of them, right, they're like the fucking CIA, man, they keep offices"
"19559430","19560430"," everywhere. "
"19560430","19562150"," They have friends in low prices."
"19562750","19572410"," They, they, they literally, um, um, practice, uh, bribery in other countries, okay?"
"19572690","19573190"," Now it's legal."
"19573530","19576530"," You can't get in trouble in the U.S. for shit you do in other countries. "
"19577110","19582730"," So a lot of stuff, we have people and banks that have office offices in Russia, have offices,"
"19582870","19590330"," believe it or not, in places like Iraq or Iran, or at least contacts there that they pay off to"
"19590330","19591710"," know before something happens."
"19592210","19595410"," So you need something unknown to the market is my point."
"19600390","19604450"," Yeah, I, I think the only one you're gonna, I think the one that, I think if you had a,"
"19604510","19609730"," if you had like a, when they do begin the cut rates, why with the reason it'll be, uh, it'll"
"19609730","19611750"," likely be as Jimmy says, right?"
"19611930","19616490"," You're saving a bank and a bank is, uh, tied into something that's fraudulent. "
"19617650","19625890"," And the only fraudulence that I could see, uh, would be, um, the mid and, and regional banks."
"19626430","19631070"," Now the other way it happens is the Fed doesn't cut rates."
"19631570","19635710"," And you have what took place in, uh, the, the dot com crash, right?"
"19636330","19642450"," So the dot com crash had more to do with, uh, raising rates and, and over in a bubble of"
"19642450","19645770"," the stock market, creating a bubble in the stock market. "
"19645910","19649630"," So if the Fed doesn't cut rates, they could create a bubble in the stock market."
"19650210","19652230"," Uh, and that would be the other way, right?"
"19652450","19657290"," But then they begin to cut rates, then we get the, the, the, um, the crash of a tech."
"19664560","19669610"," Yeah, hedging, uh, real estate with, uh, puts, you know, well, so in this report, I'm going to show"
"19669610","19672490"," you guys the real estate cycles. "
"19673650","19679870"," And, uh, we just had our, our false, uh, breakdown normally in these cycles at the end of the"
"19679870","19681090"," cycle, you get a false breakdown."
"19681390","19685070"," And then you get an extreme upside move in price."
"19685770","19690370"," We just had our false breakdown just like before the dot com bubble. "
"19691150","19696010"," And, uh, housing prices are still cranking right now."
"19696010","19701870"," So, um, uh, I think I need to stay in right now."
"19706030","19706550"," Yep. "
"19706730","19706730"," Yep."
"19707050","19707050"," Yep."
"19707190","19707190"," Yep. "
"19707970","19713190"," Uh, what about where they lend money to banks?"
"19713450","19715170"," Doesn't that stop in the next few months?"
"19715710","19724910"," Um, no, they actually lend that since 1978, uh, it's been, they, they lend the same amount"
"19725630","19726690"," regardless now."
"19727490","19737070"," Uh, they actually use, uh, prime banks as a hushed up liquidity provider to the markets"
"19737070","19744490"," and, uh, companies and banks actually, they used to not do this before seven, 1978, but they do"
"19744490","19744850"," now."
"19745430","19749110"," Um, they do liquidity cash infusion still into banks today. "
"19749710","19752730"," And company corporations used to have cycles of taking loans."
"19753750","19754390"," They stopped."
"19754790","19757350"," If you look, it's like one straight fucking line, even through crashes. "
"19758330","19761590"," Um, the money is the fucking month of the, they, what do they call it?"
"19761670","19763750"," The dune, the spice still flows."
"19768330","19769810"," Here, I'm assuming I'll show you guys something cool."
"19769990","19770510"," Hold on a second here. "
"19771930","19772830"," Uh, hold on."
"19772950","19773990"," I'll show you guys something here alone."
"19776030","19776890"," Do you want a quick second?"
"19781110","19782150"," Well, you can take here guys. "
"19784830","19785510"," That's a good one."
"19785610","19786150"," I think they're here."
"19786330","19788490"," The first return right here, uh, property geek. "
"19790210","19791990"," Oh, let me see if this guy shows it."
"19797090","19800790"," Has, uh, property geek has something on it, but what I really want to show you is something"
"19800790","19801050"," different."
"19801250","19802530"," Let me show you guys a chart. "
"19804010","19811240"," Do you want a quick sign here?"
"19824690","19830770"," There's usually a pullback and then a, like a, like this, like last exuberant phase, really weird"
"19830770","19832070"," how it plays itself out."
"19832870","19837830"," Anyone quick second here?"
"19842840","19845120"," I don't know if these guys talk about it."
"19847420","19849540"," Yeah, there's like a mid cycle dip. "
"19850060","19850960"," And we just had one."
"19851360","19856880"," Um, I have a better chart for this, but let's see if I can bring this up here."
"19858100","19868060"," There's a, um, I have a better chart than this, but, uh, we just had a"
"19868060","19869940"," pullback in our market right here. "
"19870600","19871900"," Our housing markets."
"19872440","19876880"," Uh, you guys remember if I could show this in a fed, on a fed plot, but we had a"
"19876880","19877780"," pullback in here."
"19878140","19881160"," And there's this, there's, this is called a window right here. "
"19881480","19888920"," And what we'll have is, so this window phase is where our stock market likely rips until they cut"
"19888920","19889260"," rates."
"19890540","19892280"," Um, and then you'll get your crash."
"19893040","19893640"," That's right. "
"19893900","19894800"," I got a report."
"19894940","19898900"," I'm going to show you guys really cool, but we're likely right here, mid cycle dip."
"19899300","19901500"," And you're going to see one more rip higher. "
"19901840","19907680"," If you guys look at the, if you guys look at a fed report on housing, median housing prices, it"
"19907680","19910120"," actually shows this mid cycle dip right now."
"19910720","19919800"," And then this here, this moment in here, um, this moment in here matters in terms of, uh, when they"
"19919800","19920380"," cut rates."
"19921000","19922460"," Let me see if I can show you something here. "
"19922580","19924340"," We should have us, you guys, show you guys some cool here."
"19924500","19924680"," Hold on."
"19926780","19928000"," Hang tight here. "
"19932000","19938740"," Government shutdowns, all the macro you need, go, go, go, go, face is on the side chart here,"
"19938880","19939180"," unnamed."
"19940900","19941800"," Hang tight here."
"19946840","19948400"," Did I show it on this one?"
"19948640","19949220"," Maybe let me take a look. "
"19950540","19951480"," Take a quick second here."
"19954330","19961150"," I don't think I read it here, but did I show it on the weekly?"
"19961770","19962430"," Come on quick second here."
"19962570","19963730"," I don't know if I did it on this one. "
"19966530","19966910"," Nope."
"19967410","19968250"," Let me one quick second."
"19968250","19983110"," And well, it's"
"19983110","19984030"," 3.20 in the afternoon. "
"19984410","19988010"," Let's look at a, um, one week here."
"19988950","19993030"," I don't think I did it here when the wrong chart here."
"19998370","19999310"," Don't want a quick second. "
"20011090","20012250"," Where is this?"
"20021120","20022300"," Um, one week."
"20022780","20023380"," Here we go."
"20023980","20025700"," You guys want to see some coolness?"
"20027860","20029440"," You guys want to see some coolness?"
"20031840","20032320"," Okay. "
"20033960","20034840"," Here you go."
"20034920","20036420"," I got some fun times for you here."
"20041510","20041950"," 19. "
"20042550","20043250"," That's 1983."
"20046130","20047050"," Hang tight here."
"20047150","20048570"," Where's the 1950s?"
"20048630","20050050"," We have one more to back here, don't we?"
"20051170","20052450"," Let's see if I can show this. "
"20053250","20054170"," Nope, right here."
"20054550","20054770"," Okay."
"20055450","20056450"," Here's one quick second here. "
"20058250","20068050"," So I want to talk to you guys about being careful out there of So this is August of"
"20068050","20073870"," 1966 was the end of a soft landing, right?"
"20074410","20077190"," Big roll down, but then you have this window of recovery here."
"20077850","20080330"," This is the window in here that I talk about, right?"
"20080530","20084130"," So you have that nice, beautiful pullback and the end of a soft landing."
"20085330","20086090"," Then we have a window. "
"20086390","20089910"," This window here lasts from 1966 to 1967."
"20090150","20095090"," That was a four year window where the market actually went higher."
"20096190","20096270"," Okay. "
"20097010","20100010"," This is a recessionary period thereafter."
"20100770","20104910"," You can actually see the real big low comes in in that recessionary period."
"20105190","20107350"," Soft landing always followed by a recession. "
"20107750","20110130"," This is the big one that you're looking for right here."
"20110270","20110430"," Okay."
"20111330","20113430"," And then your next one right here. "
"20114590","20120090"," You have your end of your soft landing on this one, right?"
"20120310","20121310"," See that pullback, right?"
"20121490","20124670"," Pullback in March, February, March, April or something like that."
"20125350","20130770"," But your window here is from 84 to 87, about a three year window right here."
"20131770","20135810"," Then you have your recessionary period that actually takes place later on. "
"20136990","20141290"," And you have a nice big crash right here, but we don't even go back and visit these lows down"
"20141290","20141890"," here, right?"
"20143010","20145070"," And here's your next one right here."
"20145690","20149750"," You have a soft landing, pullback, but then a run."
"20150070","20153470"," Look at this window in between the last soft landing and the last recession. "
"20154610","20156890"," And this is the, this is the bad boy right here."
"20156890","20164210"," This is where the Fed just let the market run hot all the way up in this last window."
"20164210","20170010"," And then you get your great recessionary period where you see some significant downside moves. "
"20170970","20176730"," So what we talk about this in the report, this window no one likes to talk about."
"20176930","20183030"," No one likes to talk about the window, but before the defined recession and defined soft landing,"
"20183810","20187610"," there's actually a window in there in what takes place in the market."
"20188350","20190330"," And it has to do with rate cuts. "
"20192070","20192970"," And the Fed knows this."
"20193390","20196750"," So I'll leave you with that."
"20197010","20197790"," I go into more detail. "
"20199730","20201410"," No, no, sorry, let me leave that here."
"20201850","20203250"," I go to more detail that in person."
"20203770","20214090"," So my point to you here is my point to you is that if you are a bear, if"
"20214090","20218470"," you are a bear, if you're, I know what you're looking for. "
"20218550","20219610"," I know what a seller is looking for."
"20219710","20221050"," Sellers looking for the reset, right?"
"20221810","20226570"," If you're looking for the reset, you need, you need break cuts."
"20226930","20228370"," You fucking need them so bad. "
"20229050","20235870"," Whether they're in three weeks, four weeks, or if they're end of year or in two years, five years,"
"20235870","20237810"," whatever, you need those rate cuts."
"20238450","20242390"," They've just bought themselves a window where they can do whatever the fuck that they want."
"20245330","20247670"," We have a soft landing that began in late July. "
"20248250","20250170"," The soft window dates."
"20250710","20252190"," I've got those for you as well."
"20252730","20254530"," They usually run no less than a year. "
"20254890","20259190"," Sometimes they run up to three to four years, and then they actually have a window after that"
"20259190","20260470"," defined soft landing period."
"20262990","20265830"," And that's where you get your actual crash."
"20269150","20278970"," So, anyways, I'm signing super bearish over the next year or"
"20278970","20279290"," two. "
"20279450","20279810"," Yes."
"20280410","20285770"," I want you to know that someone said I'm signing super bearish."
"20285970","20286290"," I am. "
"20288810","20292630"," I am very bearish the moment they cut rates."
"20293290","20293590"," I am."
"20295810","20297850"," Now, they have a choice. "
"20298590","20308590"," If Jerome runs this, Jerome can run this market up for Harvard long, he wants as long as he"
"20308590","20309150"," holds rates."
"20310910","20320890"," If he does cut rates or when he cuts rates, I am extremely fucking bearish, extremely bearish."
"20320890","20328010"," And I'm extremely bearish for multiple years, not like down for multiple years, but a major roll"
"20328010","20334110"," down and stagnation for three to five years at least. "
"20339400","20343080"," So, there is a technical definition of a soft landing."
"20344220","20344900"," Okay."
"20345500","20349180"," There is a technical definition of a soft landing. "
"20349700","20354440"," The start of the soft landing is the last rate increase."
"20355680","20360660"," That was July 26th of 2023."
"20363880","20367680"," Historically, we never raise rates. "
"20367880","20368960"," Oh, excuse me."
"20368960","20374300"," Historically, we never raise rates again after five months of no rate increases."
"20375080","20383760"," But if he holds rates or does increase, if he does though, he can prolong"
"20383760","20394040"," the window before the official start of the recession, at the next recessionary period, he"
"20394040","20402660"," can retard the beginning of the next recession by not cutting rates or increasing slowly over time. "
"20408900","20410880"," Or at least that's what the data says."
"20411400","20421180"," So, I'm basing this on data, not on unknown facts, prior facts, and known data as the market has"
"20421180","20421800"," acted."
"20424220","20425240"," We're going to go into this. "
"20425340","20427980"," We're going to do a big long thing."
"20427980","20431660"," This right up, I think, is like five to ten pages long."
"20432540","20441700"," It cites every prior example how the market acted and what you really need for specific things to"
"20441700","20442020"," happen. "
"20442240","20446720"," You really do need certain things to happen."
"20451410","20455510"," So, if you're a bull, if you're a bear, if you're a young person or a bear, you want rate"
"20455510","20457770"," cuts bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad."
"20458350","20459870"," You want them really, really bad. "
"20462530","20463570"," Okay, what do we got here?"
"20463810","20464590"," We got 20 minutes left."
"20465510","20471470"," No, we got half an hour, 3.30 in the afternoon now coming into the next hour of trading."
"20480100","20482180"," Price didn't rate cut same way out of whack with reality. "
"20482660","20487460"," I don't think, if you guys want my own personal, if you guys want my own personal, take care."
"20493220","20501200"," You know, outside of a correction this year, I'm fascinated to see"
"20501200","20506320"," what the Fed does in March of 25."
"20507800","20514900"," I think you're going to see like the whole focus is going to shift towards the election, right?"
"20516460","20521260"," You're going to see everybody get bearish and everybody's going to fucking hedge the goddamn"
"20521260","20521680"," election. "
"20523100","20526100"," All that hedging action is going to drive the market higher."
"20526740","20533280"," You're going to see the vol roll off that election and you're going to see the market typically"
"20533280","20537580"," blast off into March of 2025."
"20542160","20548940"," You know, you're going to see a cry from Bob on Main Street for higher rates. "
"20550200","20557120"," You know, if you see that, if you see that cry from Main Street for higher rates, that does not"
"20557120","20558680"," translate to a market crash."
"20559500","20567420"," You would want the Fed in the face of everything being fucking awesome to actually cut rates and"
"20567420","20574700"," that would be the implication of structural defects in our economy under the surface."
"20575420","20578180"," That would be with the banks and all that and the failures and that kind of stuff. "
"20582930","20586470"," So yeah, 6000 is easily on board."
"20592130","20600290"," I want you to please on your own, please on your own download yourself trading view."
"20601590","20610990"," I want you to then bring up on the chart rate cuts or the Fed unemployment rates or see the"
"20610990","20619830"," Fed funds rate, the unemployment rate rate of inflation and then I want you know, if you want, you"
"20619830","20627390"," can do the yield curve too and you'll notice that the yield curve can stay fucked longer than you"
"20627390","20629170"," can make calls in the market. "
"20630070","20639130"," This is mechanically on a large like how you and I act or how a small group of people act"
"20639130","20645550"," is completely different than the machining of our economy and the machining of our stock market."
"20645690","20655630"," There are these big cogs in our market that need to move for a significant price action to happen."
"20656290","20662090"," It's never as simple as you know, this should happen or that should happen or whatever. "
"20662750","20672550"," It's like a big fat ass elephant and because it's a big fat ass elephant, you can see when"
"20672550","20673830"," these things are going to take place."
"20677170","20683870"," I want you to go back there and start to snap lines where the Fed starts to cut rates every"
"20683870","20693090"," instance in history and if you see what you see is the most consistent, I have this in the report,"
"20693310","20702010"," I have it all blocked off for you so that you can actually see how many times we have a"
"20702010","20709770"," significant downside move in the market versus what's going on with the economy and the ones that"
"20709770","20714530"," matter about 80 to 90 percent of the time are those three that I just told you."
"20715190","20720890"," About eight to nine out of ten times unless there's something some fundamental fraud would be the"
"20720890","20723970"," other trigger and something like war or something like that. "
"20725230","20734710"," We can't trade to that stuff either, so that's the worst part of this is you can't trade or"
"20734710","20739750"," invest in the stock markets saying to yourself, we're getting another COVID."
"20740570","20742870"," If you were to do that, you'd never be in the market."
"20743250","20746710"," You just go to work, you just exit the market and go to work every day for the next 30"
"20746710","20746990"," years. "
"20748250","20757630"," If you're predicting a crash based on, I don't know, World War III, you're out of your fucking"
"20757630","20758270"," mind, right?"
"20758590","20764750"," If you're going to divest yourself out of this market based on the hope that there's a terrorism"
"20764750","20767050"," event, you're out of your fucking mind."
"20767790","20769830"," The market doesn't trade to that stuff, never will."
"20771390","20774450"," So you can hedge yourself appropriately for those moments. "
"20775030","20777310"," You can even buy insurance for those markets."
"20777550","20783930"," You guys know that you can buy insurance, brokerages, hedge funds, buy insurance for those type of"
"20783930","20784250"," events."
"20785330","20793070"," Ever since 1987, I think those guys are all insured for those unknown events to the marketplace. "
"20793570","20800670"," But outside of that, the rest of the time, you need to trade based on what the Fed is fucking"
"20800670","20801070"," doing."
"20801070","20802510"," Do not fight the Fed."
"20803470","20805770"," I'm going to leave you with one last thing on this. "
"20805930","20806090"," Okay."
"20807350","20810530"," You know that I want the Fed to cut rates already."
"20810570","20814810"," You guys have heard me say that being painted into a corner painted into a corner. "
"20815070","20820750"," Remember how angry I got two or three rate decisions ago when he broke out the fucking, the fucking"
"20820750","20822990"," 20 year charts and the 10 year charts."
"20822990","20825230"," And I was flipping out and all is all mad."
"20826570","20832250"," You know, if, if, if Jerome is telling us right, higher for longer, higher for longer, higher for"
"20832250","20838310"," longer, I'm going to hold into 2024 minimum, forget the little Fed presidents out there. "
"20838690","20840210"," Jerome is telling you that."
"20841370","20848490"," If he's telling you that, he is trying to not crash this market for 2024."
"20849010","20862230"," Yeah, you"
"20862230","20863150"," guys remember that, right?"
"20863810","20869960"," Oh, we are in inflationary environments. "
"20870240","20874480"," He needs, well, we are and we all know that we're in inflationary environments."
"20875060","20876100"," I wouldn't be shocked."
"20876340","20877000"," I'll be honest with you. "
"20877640","20886480"," I wouldn't be shocked for us to keep going up in inflation and feel it, personally, feel it and see"
"20886480","20890260"," us touch that 2% year every year."
"20890520","20891880"," That wouldn't, I wouldn't even fucking blink."
"20893140","20894660"," They have, they fucking commit fraud. "
"20895140","20896540"," It's known that they commit fraud."
"20897260","20899520"," It's known that they commit fraud."
"20900000","20901420"," Here, let me set something up for you. "
"20902160","20903040"," Let me show you guys something."
"20903220","20904680"," You guys want to see something, hold on here."
"20905460","20907820"," I'm not going to, I'm just going to cut it and paste it and show it later. "
"20908500","20911380"," It's going to, it's going to take me 15 minutes to show you this."
"20911860","20913940"," I got people on camera admitting to it."
"20914540","20916880"," So they will, they will, they will do that. "
"20917300","20918940"," We're out there mercy, basically."
"20919340","20920560"," The fucking fraud is real."
"20930270","20936430"," You need, you're going to see what you will normally see, typically, traditionally what you will"
"20936430","20944570"," see is you will see a touchdown of 2% inflation, which is probably bullshit. "
"20945390","20950310"," It's when they want that report to say we hit 2% year over year."
"20950470","20950670"," Do you understand?"
"20951570","20957770"," And even unemployment right now is ramping and they fudged the last quarters numbers, right?"
"20958470","20960350"," They fudged them last quarter."
"20961170","20964770"," We know that unemployment is ramping, but they will fucking fake them. "
"20964870","20967330"," I'm telling you, they fucking fake this shit."
"20967430","20968130"," I promise you."
"20968910","20972230"," They will fake it as long as they want to fake it. "
"20973050","20979030"," So then the rate cuts, whenever they want to cut rates, whenever you see the fed chair come out and"
"20979030","20986050"," cut rates and you see those three mechanics all lining up, I would get fearful at that point."
"20986250","20991250"," That's when they want their crash or their meaningful downside crash movement that you're looking"
"20991250","20991810"," for."
"20992530","20994930"," That's second leg down, that great reset. "
"20995750","20999650"," That short term or long term cycle reset."
"21009610","21013550"," Willie Lohm saying, I'm not sure if Pat would agree with me, but the interpretation is that we are"
"21013550","21014370"," inflationary environment."
"21014870","21015930"," Fed starts cutting early. "
"21016230","21019310"," They're going to have their hands tied if when inflation ramps up again."
"21019970","21024050"," So it's not that cutting rates lead to unemployment higher, but that higher employment caused the"
"21024050","21025130"," fed to blink and lower rates."
"21025490","21027150"," I'm going to tell you guys something right now. "
"21028450","21037330"," Right now our numbers for unemployment inflation are probably the most manipulated they have been."
"21037510","21041130"," There's a it's glaring right now how manipulated they are."
"21041530","21046890"," It's glaring and the inverted yield curve. "
"21048950","21058710"," I heard a guy say last week that he for the first time in his career is open"
"21058710","21066970"," to the Fed in the Treasury Department, even manipulating the yield curve, an actual fraudulent"
"21066970","21071250"," manipulation of the yield curve to get to their ends."
"21072010","21080210"," So, yeah, yes, and no, I agree with you, Willie, but at the same time, it's I"
"21080210","21083370"," don't think they're reacting at this point."
"21083370","21085090"," I think they're fucking fudge and abrasive. "
"21087370","21094810"," And I don't think it matters if they cut or let's say they cut and then jump back on the"
"21094810","21096230"," rate increases, they ain't going to matter."
"21096370","21101090"," The moment they fucking cut, uh, abandoned ship fucking run."
"21101730","21103030"," There was one other thing in that too. "
"21103390","21109190"," If they do cut rates, you could see, uh, in a big squeeze for a couple weeks, you might see"
"21109190","21113010"," like a two week or a three day or, uh, but just a time period of a squeeze."
"21113610","21118290"," If we are on a low, uh, to grab liquidity for that major roll down."
"21118530","21124770"," So you might hear me saying this stuff to you right now and you might like come back when it"
"21124770","21127630"," happens and say, fuck you, cap, you're wrong. "
"21127690","21130810"," Look at the market squeezing, crate like squeezing like crazy cap."
"21131290","21134810"," Uh, I would be your most cautious at that moment."
"21135650","21142690"," Uh, extreme caution as a bull, even if it's cranking, you might be like, Hey, some guy named Jim"
"21142690","21144350"," James told me we should roll and look at this. "
"21144430","21146590"," We're going up and going all in on this."
"21147330","21150930"," Uh, I would, I would warn you to sit in your hands for at least a month."
"21151730","21158150"," Uh, I'd be my most cautious would be at that moment regardless of price action in the marketplace. "
"21159190","21163230"," Um, very, very afraid of rate cuts right now."
"21163230","21170350"," I am, it is, it is my, uh, it is my fear, my only fear in this market right now"
"21170350","21172170"," is rate cuts as a bull."
"21172650","21174570"," My only fear right now is rate cuts. "
"21178510","21185310"," And it does not shock me that the bond market is betting on those rate cuts either if they want"
"21185310","21186570"," to see that crash as well."
"21187310","21193030"," Uh, like the om, like who's got om, uh, who's om we're talking about, what people want to see"
"21193030","21194690"," happen does not shock me."
"21194970","21201930"," Uh, that there are people bond, bond vigilantes betting on that rate cut. "
"21202150","21205050"," Like there's, there's a, there's a group of people out there."
"21206070","21212510"," Well, very smart people that want to see those rate cuts and they're not your friend if you're a"
"21212510","21212670"," bull."
"21213590","21223700"," Oh boy, you know what, you know what, you can argue that against, I"
"21223700","21230100"," will show you the video of the people saying, uh, that they, that absolutely 100% the numbers are"
"21230100","21230760"," being manipulated. "
"21231800","21232160"," 100%."
"21232160","21237420"," These are from, uh, the heads, these are, these are heads of our, of what we do."
"21237520","21240500"," These are professionals, uh, known professionals. "
"21242440","21244060"," Yeah, yeah, you got to watch the video, man."
"21244980","21249680"," Um, it's got, you know, as a matter of fact, you knew what it was, was it was an interview,"
"21249680","21250820"," here I'm going to show it here."
"21251020","21251160"," Hold on. "
"21251720","21252680"," You don't even need to watch."
"21253020","21255240"," You don't even need to, I don't even need to cut it for you."
"21255800","21257140"," Um, hold on, let me find it here. "
"21257820","21259280"," I'll post the link for you right now."
"21259400","21259860"," Hink tight here."
"21262140","21266340"," Watch this entire video and start to finish. "
"21266340","21267620"," Watch this entire thing."
"21272310","21274550"," And, uh, watch this just the other night."
"21274570","21284330"," And I was like, so I was talking to, um, I was talking to, um, I wrote a report, I"
"21284330","21285130"," showed it to Joe. "
"21286290","21291010"," And these, uh, people said the same thing as my report was saying."
"21291290","21301290"," So, uh, here, I want you to watch this entire report because what was fascinating"
"21301290","21305150"," about this report was you have beers, right?"
"21305890","21309030"," Market sellers, short selling hedge funds."
"21310550","21314930"," And they have a thesis on what should happen in 2024. "
"21316650","21321790"," And yet they are all in agreement with everything I just said to you today."
"21322590","21327570"," Uh, and they, they go into detail on that, on that scam bullshit."
"21327930","21329310"," So I'm going to post this for you right now. "
"21329490","21330330"," Watch the entire video."
"21330890","21332510"," It's from a stock charts.com."
"21333390","21336690"," Uh, watch the entire, definitely watch the entire video."
"21341600","21344460"," Uh, at the end of today, when you guys are done, right?"
"21345460","21351580"," At the end of today, uh, watch this video, start to finish. "
"21352740","21357420"," And it's pretty, these guys was fascinating because I wrote my report, right?"
"21358200","21359800"," And I started to watch the video."
"21360620","21364060"," And the first third of it, I was like, these guys are all wrong."
"21364280","21366280"," They don't know what the fuck they're, well, after they don't know what they're talking about. "
"21366700","21372840"," I'm like, these guys are saying stuff and don't understand all the mechanics or they're not looking"
"21372840","21373400"," at all the mechanics."
"21374000","21378400"," And then like one or two people or they all eventually came around together as a group."
"21379260","21381960"," And said, Oh, shit. "
"21382160","21382940"," What about this stuff?"
"21383340","21383920"," Or you know what?"
"21384060","21387240"," I, this guy that's in this interview right now, I'm going to go with him on this."
"21387640","21389560"," It was kind of like putting free, really."
"21389880","21391640"," Three or four really smart people together. "
"21392360","21396240"," And they all had their view in the market for the year, but but getting those three people together"
"21396240","21402680"," in one room or one interview, they were all like, yeah, we do need some shit to happen, don't we,"
"21402920","21404320"," for our outlooks?"
"21404740","21406880"," And so they were kind of getting, they were getting it."
"21407020","21408980"," They were like, ah, we get it now as a group."
"21409420","21410020"," It was really cool. "
"21410220","21415660"," It was a fascinating interview to watch because, um, you have some very well respected, uh, very"
"21415660","21421080"," well respected people in the same room having a round table ish discussion."
"21422120","21429660"," And you know that these people might disagree in their outlooks, but they respect the intelligence"
"21429660","21438820"," and wisdom and prior experience of each other enough that they were hyper aware of what can happen"
"21438820","21442800"," against them this upcoming year."
"21443040","21444920"," So, take a watch that video if you could. "
"21446100","21446540"," Yeah."
"21446620","21446700"," Yeah."
"21446820","21447400"," Will you check it out?"
"21447480","21448080"," I mean, definitely brother. "
"21449160","21451980"," And she's I figured her name, but she's from New Mexico."
"21452300","21456540"," I think I figured her name right now, Tom had and she's she point blank states it."
"21457680","21465480"," That right now specific to time this year, this year that we're coming into right now is probably"
"21465480","21470100"," the most fraudulent, the fed and the treasury departments can become. "
"21473980","21475820"," Oh, no, I didn't know there was this timestamp."
"21476140","21477260"," Just start it right at the beginning."
"21477820","21482100"," If that thing, if that's on a timestamp, just go right to the start of the of the video, start"
"21482100","21482620"," from the beginning. "
"21483200","21484040"," I don't know why."
"21484140","21489020"," Maybe I might have clicked it on a timestamp or something, but, uh, I might have fucked that up."
"21491280","21492820"," Carol on for years and years. "
"21492920","21493820"," Where is it on right now?"
"21493820","21497200"," The 39 minute mark just started right at the beginning."
"21497860","21499440"," I don't even think I finished the video."
"21499580","21500020"," I just stopped. "
"21500120","21505180"," I was like, I know the, I know already know saying I watched this video, like I've already done my"
"21505180","21505400"," work."
"21505400","21507800"," I already know what's going to happen this year."
"21508020","21512440"," So I'm very confident, very confident in what I think is going to happen this year. "
"21512580","21516600"," So, um, I have a high degree of confidence here."
"21516640","21521080"," So these guys that I was like, I don't agree with any of these guys are saying and then somewhere"
"21521080","21525520"," through the video I go, they're figuring it out as they get interviewed."
"21525620","21533760"," It's like, as they were as they were being interviewed, you could see they all were like, fuck. "
"21536280","21545600"," Like done a bad way just, uh, you know, put three three smart people in a room and they start"
"21545600","21552960"," to come to like a, I don't know, a higher level conclusion as to what could happen in the air"
"21552960","21554260"," and why that would happen."
"21558340","21560800"," No, we do not have a confirmation of ray cuts."
"21561220","21562140"," We do not. "
"21563120","21563980"," We do not."
"21565560","21572040"," In the bond market betting against our betting on dot plot, the little Fed president's talking,"
"21572680","21573620"," doesn't mean anything."
"21574180","21576400"," The bond market doesn't mean anything. "
"21577680","21581460"," Mortgage brokers or setting rates lower."
"21581940","21583440"," All that is just speculation."
"21584080","21584720"," It's all it is. "
"21586140","21587160"," All it is."
"21592350","21594210"," Thanks for asking about the times."
"21594390","21598010"," If you guys are opening that video to a time stamp, go back to the beginning. "
"21598150","21599930"," Watch that video from the beginning, please."
"21603210","21604570"," So the report is done."
"21605150","21607850"," I've been working on it to finalize it. "
"21607970","21613530"," I just have to, it's more how it looks and then like how it's structured, the color of things."
"21614890","21616790"," Just want to clean it up a little bit."
"21617110","21620130"," So it should be done today, tonight, somewhere tonight or tomorrow. "
"21620970","21623430"," It'll be a post, a link will be posted."
"21625050","21626390"," It'll be on our website."
"21627290","21632810"," So if you sign up for the free membership, you'll have access to it or the link to the website"
"21632810","21634110"," will be inside of the discord. "
"21635470","21637570"," So I will, you'll know about it when it's there."
"21637690","21639570"," When I, when you guys get it, you'll know about it."
"21640630","21642070"," And I just have to clean it up. "
"21642190","21643250"," It's pretty extensive."
"21643550","21644570"," I had to back test everything."
"21645650","21649830"," I had to read it over and over and over. "
"21651210","21657210"," And now I just have to plot out the year, already plotted out the year, I just have to clean"
"21657210","21662230"," it up so that it's one cute looking set of lines going up for the year and stuff like that."
"21664830","21672110"," I posted the rough draft of just this SPX chart, I think, on Twitter, just an SPX chart for"
"21672110","21673230"," expectations on the year."
"21673710","21681510"," And then we have to talk about a conclusion at the end about, you know, what you're looking for. "
"21682310","21684750"," So like, you're looking, you want to be paying attention."
"21685190","21693170"," Dude, you guys, there's like some, there's some data man on presidential elections where we fucking"
"21693170","21698090"," moon 100% of the time, like 100%."
"21698090","21707850"," It's going to be fascinating seeing what the Fed does in December to March of 2025,"
"21708310","21718970"," December of 2024 to March of 2025, if"
"21718970","21728270"," we ramp up, because there's going to be fucking calls, man, for rate increases. "
"21729610","21737650"," And he knows, Jerome fucking knows if he does rate increases that we will continue higher."
"21738050","21740490"," The fun strat will be correct."
"21741230","21744250"," He'll get his 6000, if that happens. "
"21745430","21754650"," And you will see the 5200 this year, and you'll likely see a mad dash to 6000 into"
"21754650","21755850"," 2026."
"21757810","21762810"," And then you would see a major roll down in the market, a major market crash."
"21763570","21764570"," It should begin. "
"21764930","21770130"," And now if he, if Jerome does the right thing, he'll cut rates in 2025 and start it early."
"21770930","21778470"," If he does not do the right thing and he continues to pause and raise into 2026, he would all"
"21778470","21784010"," magically align with a housing crash, an 18 year at the end of an 18 year housing cycle."
"21786210","21788810"," It'll all magically align together at the same time. "
"21794380","21795260"," I got you guys, man."
"21797900","21799060"," I'll talk to you guys soon."
"21799700","21806580"," And you know, if you're a bull, even though I sound as bearish as I do, Jerome can definitely save"
"21806580","21807020"," your ass. "
"21807460","21810060"," He has the ability to save your ass."
"21810200","21814480"," He has the ability with rates to extend this market for years."
"21815220","21820720"," He can extend this market for five fucking years, if he wanted to. "
"21821800","21828160"," If he continues to raise rates, see rates at like 15, 20, something like that."
"21828500","21831980"," Yeah, you can see that you can see the market fucking just keep fucking ripping, dude."
"21833060","21834980"," I just don't know if he's gonna do it or not. "
"21836100","21837360"," If he wants to do it."
"21837700","21837740"," I"
"21840070","21850450"," don't"
"21852370","21852810"," know."
"21852810","21853970"," Let's see what happens in this close. "
"21854250","21856310"," I want to know if you guys are bullish on this close."
"21857430","21867690"," I'm thinking I'm buying some puts for tomorrow, but on the bell, fucking"
"21867690","21869610"," bears can't get it done again, baby."
"21869770","21871390"," Can't get it done again, bears. "
"21875000","21876360"," You guys have a great afternoon."
"21876920","21878140"," I'll be back with you again tomorrow."
"21878280","21882580"," Remember a few other things we went over this morning, even though the stock market is back"
"21882580","21887700"," operating, those stock market really doesn't start back up until after this Friday. "
"21888400","21889480"," People are still traveling."
"21890100","21897100"," The way that the holidays worked out this year, kids are off until Friday or until Monday across"
"21897100","21897760"," the country."
"21898720","21900280"," So the real market should reopen. "
"21901080","21902960"," And then you've got positioning and all that kind of shit."
"21904060","21908640"," So we're still in a holiday trade until at least Monday."
"21915150","21915750"," All right. "
"21915870","21918290"," I'm going to turn this off the next seven minutes or so."
"21922790","21925150"," And I'll see all of you guys tomorrow, baby."
"21926150","21928370"," Expect that report today or tomorrow. "
"21928810","21929230"," It should be tonight."
"21929430","21930750"," I should be able to get it done."
"21931310","21936210"," I want Joe to review it one more time and make sure what else we got for you. "
"21936770","21937390"," I got some cool stuff."
"21937790","21938730"," I got some cool stuff coming."
"21943500","21945560"," Nice little pump coming into this close here. "
"21945860","21946440"," What's the us?"
"21946620","21947780"," What's the imbalance right now?"
"21952450","21953590"," Not seeing the imbalance."
"21953610","21955490"," Anybody know what the MOCM balances here?"
"21955670","21961690"," I'm not seeing anything public from financial juice."
"21962750","21963470"," Thanks, Duke. "
"21963910","21967090"," Three million MOC by side, 7.4 billion."
"21967090","21967710"," Thank you, brother."
"21978230","21982770"," The IMF chief is saying the Fed is definitely achieving a soft landing. "
"21983470","21985610"," I said that this morning to you."
"21985770","21991430"," I'm telling you guys, dude, we started a soft landing, brothers and sisters in July."
"21993170","21998050"," When they finally announced the soft landing, it'll be the end of the soft landing. "
"21998230","22001210"," And then we're going to go into what I call and have coined."
"22001750","22003250"," Nobody else has coined this but me."
"22004390","22006170"," A window. "
"22006590","22009790"," You're going to have an official soft landing period."
"22010770","22012910"," Then you're going to have a window period."
"22014030","22017310"," And then you're going to have the next recessionary period. "
"22017850","22022350"," And that is the window period is what nobody is talking about."
"22022350","22024790"," So we're going to talk about that in that report."
"22025710","22030830"," We're going to talk about the definition of a soft landing, how long they last. "
"22030830","22040770"," And then that window between the defined soft landing and the defined recession that"
"22040770","22043330"," historically we're guaranteed to follow after."
"22043670","22044330"," And that is what."
"22044850","22047610"," So that video I gave to you guys earlier, right?"
"22047850","22049150"," So this is the thing, okay?"
"22050030","22054790"," You got bears out there that are like, well, even if we have a soft landing, we guarantee that we"
"22054790","22055610"," go into a recession. "
"22056410","22062530"," But what they don't, what they're missing, key point or key part of this is that there's a window"
"22062530","22064390"," period too in between those two."
"22065090","22068030"," And they're defined by specific dates."
"22069450","22072670"," And we have not left the soft landing period yet. "
"22072970","22075250"," And we have not entered the window period yet."
"22076090","22078290"," And we have not entered the recession period."
"22078510","22081730"," So when you're listening to a bear out there telling you, and you hear people out there telling"
"22081730","22091690"," you, even if we're passing the middle, this, this middle pausing periods"
"22091690","22093670"," window in between the two. "
"22094970","22097390"," And you guys are going to get access to that shit from me."
"22097530","22098890"," So talk to you guys soon."
"22099450","22100250"," Love you all. "
"22100610","22101110"," See you soon."
"22112830","22114810"," Yeah, you may do that bear town sheriff."
"22114990","22115670"," Switch it to manipulation. "
"22116390","22117070"," I could do that, man."
"22117950","22120690"," That's a good, that's a good name to manipulation."
"22121450","22122430"," I like that brother. "
"22123250","22124750"," There's a manipulation window."
"22124910","22126110"," It really is a bear town."
"22126410","22127470"," It's a manipulation window. "
"22128290","22133730"," Like we're, we're basically giving, we're handing over control of the market at that point to a"
"22133730","22134570"," fraud period."
"22135050","22141270"," It's like a fucking fraud period where the, as long as the fed holds rates, market does not, does"
"22141270","22146470"," not trigger the end of the short term or long term debt cycle."
"22147890","22149150"," It's kind of fucked up. "
"22150070","22151550"," It's kind of fucked up."
"22153890","22159290"," You guys don't really think that, so the last quarter inflation came down and unemployment came"
"22159290","22159550"," down."
"22159670","22160130"," You know that, right?"
"22160730","22161930"," You guys believe that?"
"22162350","22167410"," You guys really believe that inflation was coming down the last quarter?"
"22168870","22170630"," You guys are out of your fucking minds, right?"
"22171390","22173570"," Like I get my tax bills in right now. "
"22173730","22179770"," I'm get, well, I know inflation doesn't count everything, but you got to be out of your fucking"
"22179770","22180070"," mind."
"22180290","22185350"," Like, if you don't think that I'm paying more, like my end of year stuff is coming in right now."
"22185850","22190130"," And I am getting fucking bent over right now. "
"22190550","22198950"," And I see none of it stopping from taxes to cost of goods and services."
"22200070","22202150"," And you know, gas, fuck gas."
"22202370","22204130"," I don't give a fuck about gas coming down. "
"22204870","22206190"," Gas ain't got shit."
"22206410","22212350"," So I just went through a period of, I just went through a period of, of three major increases on"
"22212350","22215130"," my, on my utilities."
"22216010","22217770"," I own three pro, I don't know. "
"22217890","22220790"," I just bought another one at auction, right?"
"22221130","22226070"," So, but the utilities, I pay utilities on three properties right now, right?"
"22227010","22235250"," And I went through a three rate increase cycle and I just got my winter bill in form, but we"
"22235250","22237050"," have warm winter across the country, right?"
"22237750","22242090"," I just got my like my bills in for my real true winter bills for utilities."
"22246630","22253950"," I got houses that have electric bills at 700 a month right now, a fucking building."
"22254770","22256450"," Like, I'm not goddamn joking. "
"22256730","22258170"," I'm fucking raging here."
"22258170","22265170"," I don't even know like my taxes this year."
"22265750","22271190"," And when I'm looking at my expenses for this year, they're fucking lying. "
"22271850","22273330"," They're fucking lying, man."
"22273330","22274630"," I'm telling you, they're fucking lying."
"22277170","22277950"," Oh, yeah. "
"22278430","22279370"," Oh, yeah."
"22280110","22280490"," Oh, yeah."
"22281330","22282850"," And we've had meaningful increases. "
"22283230","22289830"," And the worst part of it was, the last meaningful increase was at the ass end of last winter."
"22290570","22292890"," So you didn't, I didn't really see the impact."
"22292950","22295330"," It was like a slow raise over a few years. "
"22295950","22302970"," But then this winter is when it all cumulatively was like a kick to the, and then they did a"
"22302970","22304470"," bunch of other stupid shit too."
"22304590","22313190"," Like we, they gave us three increases and then they introduced this like window during the day"
"22313190","22314710"," where you get at a higher rate."
"22315030","22315950"," That's new for us too. "
"22316930","22322970"," It's like it like between the hours of four p.m. and seven p.m. You get another 30%"
"22322970","22324110"," increase."
"22324250","22326290"," And so it's just this big fucking scam."
"22326770","22336730"," And it's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, according"
"22336730","22344350"," to a US treasury statement, US total public debt outstanding reached $34 trillion for the first"
"22344350","22346170"," time on Friday, December 20. "
"22346710","22347070"," I don't know."
"22348370","22351990"," I'm telling you guys out there, inflation's not coming down."
"22353050","22354390"," It ain't coming down. "
"22362530","22366050"," Do you want to stay up to date with the late, you know, bleeding edge of."
"22366070","22371130"," So I looked at then sign up today and get our special offer or financial use."
"22371330","22380770"," You know, I considered solar just like truly considered solar two or three"
"22380770","22385710"," times I'm a solar proponent. "
"22386470","22389290"," This is this is the first year."
"22389790","22395490"," So that's remember I was telling you about these conversations with my partners and wife and stuff."
"22398050","22404430"," I'm having a I really want to I think I'm committed to making all my homes solar in this next"
"22404430","22405130"," roll down. "
"22405430","22410030"," So I think I'm no longer on the fence."
"22410830","22415170"," I am actively making a decision to go solar at some point."
"22424610","22430210"," I lost where you sign up for membership levels, which you might you can just go to in the top"
"22430210","22431370"," right hand side, Adrian. "
"22432010","22436030"," Adrian, if you go to the top right hand side of the website, if you go to memberships and just"
"22436030","22437350"," click on it, there's a free tear."
"22437490","22439150"," You just sign up for the free tear right there."
"22439890","22443390"," And then you'll get the report. "
"22444750","22449850"," And if you guys all put a link in here in the chat, you guys will get a link to"
"22449850","22450250"," it in the chat."
"22450990","22451530"," Hey, Will, man."
"22451710","22452290"," Happy New Year, brother. "
"22453330","22454310"," Take these, my man."
"22454690","22455830"," And what else?"
"22458810","22460050"," Oh, Sunday never ends."
"22460290","22463350"," Just said can confirm I'm hip, deep in TLT and want rate cuts. "
"22466250","22468250"," I know I know Sunday never ends."
"22468250","22468670"," I know."
"22470150","22471090"," I know the bet. "
"22475390","22476390"," I get to dog."
"22482040","22485600"," Oh, no kidding Jay pasture pigeons are the birds."
"22486380","22492220"," You know, I was going to do the I got a I got a yeah, it's true to go mother. "
"22496240","22499760"," The 2% year over years, you know, we're never going to beat that, are we?"
"22500000","22500800"," Well, we could."
"22502660","22505460"," We can, but they're not trying for that."
"22505560","22505740"," Are they?"
"22505840","22508880"," They've already admitted they're just trying to get us down to 2% year over year. "
"22510000","22513320"," You know, I really wanted to do the power wall, but I'm not going to."
"22514300","22515280"," It's not."
"22515900","22523360"," I would really like to do the I'd also really like to do the the the tiles on the roof,"
"22523580","22525480"," but I don't think it's cost effective for me. "
"22526400","22531960"," So I think I'm going to do the panels on the on the roof like the like panels across the"
"22531960","22535460"," entire roofs or like one side of the roof or whatever."
"22537040","22537800"," Stack them."
"22539600","22542120"," But I I'm on solar at this point. "
"22542540","22543300"," I really am."
"22543820","22545320"," That was the nail in the cough this year."
"22545520","22549500"," This year is the nail in the coffin for me with power companies. "
"22549740","22550820"," I'm I'm fucking done with it."
"22551020","22552980"," I'm so fucking pissed off these power companies."
"22554000","22555940"," And I know what I know what's happening. "
"22555940","22556700"," It's a new cycle."
"22556980","22557960"," We're heading into it."
"22558720","22568180"," We're in this cycle where we're in this new cycle, right where we're going to get gouged"
"22568180","22569380"," by the government. "
"22569380","22570940"," We're going to get gouged by corporations."
"22572400","22574340"," And they're it's like the whole egg thing, right?"
"22574480","22577420"," We had these remember two years ago, we talked about how they're going to raise the price of eggs"
"22577420","22581660"," and not bring them back down because they know they can't raise them again."
"22582560","22585820"," And for a 10 year cycle, 20 year cycle. "
"22586420","22591660"," So you're going to get if you're a young person, you're going to get fucked and only over time we"
"22591660","22598180"," are ready to pay give you that sweet spots where you're kind of like kind of like making strides,"
"22598180","22601820"," but that's going to take 10, 20 years for you to get there."
"22602200","22607380"," If you're a low income worker and stuff like that, so if I'm at the start of that cycle right"
"22607380","22614880"," now of getting fucking bent over, this is probably the time to invest in solar, not on the back end"
"22614880","22615700"," of one of those cycles."
"22620500","22621900"," Yeah, I've heard that too, goat mother. "
"22622300","22622760"," I've heard that."
"22623100","22623780"," I don't have the space."
