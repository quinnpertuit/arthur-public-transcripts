"_zb0kga97sQ","443800","446700"," You got to watch Max 7 versus everything else."
"_zb0kga97sQ","446700","450840"," Watch a Zion's Bank, but watch a bank like Comarico,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","450840","452040"," which everybody's really worried about."
"_zb0kga97sQ","452040","454580"," Watch Schwab, which at one time people worry about."
"_zb0kga97sQ","454580","457120"," Those are the ones that I think can really have it move."
"_zb0kga97sQ","457120","458780"," And then even though they're big,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","458780","461080"," the home goalers will do better."
"_zb0kga97sQ","461080","464520"," But I just think that this is also a Home Depot market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","464520","466920"," Like, if you start feeling better,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","466920","469020"," you're going to remodel and renovate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","469020","471920"," And a lot of people were not remodeling and renovating."
"_zb0kga97sQ","471920","474720"," That stock may be another stock that you want to be."
"_zb0kga97sQ","474720","476060"," What did Land Gun say yesterday?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","476060","478400"," Of course, he's, you know, one of the old founders of,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","486640","488100"," Well, you know, look, you're late."
"_zb0kga97sQ","488160","490060"," Yes, they are amazing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","490060","493960"," And if you think that Shrink is, has peaked,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","493960","495600"," they have a terrible Shrink problem."
"_zb0kga97sQ","495600","497700"," You know, what you have to do is you look at their private label"
"_zb0kga97sQ","497700","501400"," brands that are for sale right now on Amazon."
"_zb0kga97sQ","501400","502080"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","502080","503140"," They don't sell on Amazon."
"_zb0kga97sQ","506180","508280"," Oh, so people are stealing on the side."
"_zb0kga97sQ","508280","510080"," And then they have website, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","510080","514560"," You know, it's not a really good thing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","514560","515520"," No, it's a bad thing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","515520","516020"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","516020","518020"," But you can get some great deals."
"_zb0kga97sQ","518020","520420"," And I think everyone belongs to Jeff."
"_zb0kga97sQ","520420","521420"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","521420","522620"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","522620","525060"," We got to figure out something."
"_zb0kga97sQ","525060","525960"," Yeah, look at the return."
"_zb0kga97sQ","525960","526620"," Look at the return."
"_zb0kga97sQ","526620","527420"," There it is."
"_zb0kga97sQ","527420","528020"," Thank you guys."
"_zb0kga97sQ","528020","531060"," Look at when you look at that, look at that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","531060","532060"," And it's fun."
"_zb0kga97sQ","532060","533860"," And the stores are packed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","533860","538300"," There's almost a million percent return."
"_zb0kga97sQ","538300","541940"," The stores are jammed, like my wife has said more than she's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","541940","542700"," ever seen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","542700","543540"," It's been gorgeous."
"_zb0kga97sQ","543540","545340"," That is 42 years."
"_zb0kga97sQ","545340","550300"," But, well, David, it's a fantastic place to shop."
"_zb0kga97sQ","550300","552420"," Jim, that's wealth creation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","552420","556460"," Yes, it's wealth, but this is discovering Home Depot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","556460","558380"," It's where you go, you know, I think, come on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","558380","561540"," Did you know it was a million percent, a million?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","561540","562220"," A million percent?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","562220","562780"," No."
"_zb0kga97sQ","562780","565060"," I do know that this is what the market does."
"_zb0kga97sQ","565060","566980"," But maybe we should just sit here and talk about wealth"
"_zb0kga97sQ","566980","570660"," distribution, and the rich, and the poor, and Congress,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","570660","573820"," and how we look at the two-year and the 10-year,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","573820","575780"," and forget that million percent, David,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","575780","578060"," because that's only available for people who do other homework."
"_zb0kga97sQ","578060","580620"," You could have come with a mad dash in 1981 and said,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","580620","582180"," hey, put away Home Depot, and then you"
"_zb0kga97sQ","582180","583580"," wouldn't remember how to say anything again."
"_zb0kga97sQ","583580","585420"," You could just shut up for the next 42 years."
"_zb0kga97sQ","585420","588180"," I do think I'd be here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","588180","590740"," I love this company, Home Depot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","590740","594140"," My wife was sending me pictures two days ago from Home Depot,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","594140","596420"," just this sheer number of people."
"_zb0kga97sQ","596420","597580"," Incredible."
"_zb0kga97sQ","597580","599540"," Jim, your point about the regionals"
"_zb0kga97sQ","599540","601260"," is a good one, because Schwab, citizens,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","601260","604580"," true as key region, Zion's all helping to lead the market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","604580","605620"," here up four more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","605620","606820"," That's a percentage gain."
"_zb0kga97sQ","606820","608020"," That's what you want."
"_zb0kga97sQ","608020","611020"," Play for percentage gains."
"_zb0kga97sQ","611020","614900"," We don't want four more points than Microsoft."
"_zb0kga97sQ","614900","617900"," We want to get to 5% in region's financial,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","617900","619620"," which we thought was left for dead."
"_zb0kga97sQ","619620","622100"," Eight times earnings, 5% yield."
"_zb0kga97sQ","622100","623700"," I now feel much better about the yield,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","623700","625980"," and that's what you're looking for."
"_zb0kga97sQ","625980","628420"," And now people say, well, where's region's financial?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","629300","630460"," It's in the south."
"_zb0kga97sQ","630460","632300"," Nothing matter that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","632300","636460"," Adobe, you had Sean Newon met money last night."
"_zb0kga97sQ","636460","640060"," Adobe stock is down over 6% after reporting earnings"
"_zb0kga97sQ","640060","641780"," after the bell yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","641780","644380"," It seems to be, despite what was a strong fourth quarter,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","644380","647380"," Jim, that they did lower their fiscal year 24 expectations"
"_zb0kga97sQ","647380","648300"," in terms of guidance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","648300","649700"," Not the first time you've done that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","649700","651180"," No."
"_zb0kga97sQ","651180","652540"," What do you think?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","652540","655620"," I think you wait for another day, maybe tomorrow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","655620","658100"," But then you buy it, because even though he lowered"
"_zb0kga97sQ","658180","661180"," guidance, every division is on fire."
"_zb0kga97sQ","661180","662460"," And he's done this before."
"_zb0kga97sQ","662460","664820"," He usually waited a day or two, and you get back in."
"_zb0kga97sQ","664820","666940"," Now, of course, in a fed rate cut,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","666940","669340"," it may not be the ideal stock to buy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","669340","672620"," But David, I'm going to go back to your world."
"_zb0kga97sQ","672620","673940"," OK?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","673940","674740"," Does Figma deal?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","674740","675260"," Adobe shares?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","675260","677260"," This Figma deal is very important for them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","677260","677820"," Still right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","677820","679420"," They're still waiting on approvals on the Figma deal."
"_zb0kga97sQ","679420","680740"," Private company, by the way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","680740","681460"," Private company."
"_zb0kga97sQ","681460","683300"," But I think they paid a huge number for it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","683300","684380"," 20 bill."
"_zb0kga97sQ","684380","687380"," But I think the Justice Department doesn't want it to happen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","687380","689700"," And Shout and I were batting back and forth"
"_zb0kga97sQ","689700","692140"," that there are now so many new companies in the area"
"_zb0kga97sQ","692140","694020"," that since the Justice Department got angry,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","694020","696260"," this is very typical."
"_zb0kga97sQ","696260","697660"," When Justice Department went after Google,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","697660","699740"," that was before TikTok."
"_zb0kga97sQ","699740","701700"," I mean, TikTok is killing Google."
"_zb0kga97sQ","701700","704220"," So why should we worry about Google?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","704220","705500"," TikTok's killing everybody."
"_zb0kga97sQ","705500","708860"," Well, that is the old criticism of antitrust policy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","708860","713100"," in general to never keep up with the dynamism of the market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","713100","714300"," Wow, that's good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","714300","716020"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","716060","719060"," Every so often, you're so good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","719060","720700"," Dynamism of the market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","720700","722140"," Wow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","722140","724540"," Look, this is just one of those moments"
"_zb0kga97sQ","724540","726860"," where you look at what's worse."
"_zb0kga97sQ","726860","729100"," Decide if that's a good balance sheet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","729100","730500"," And if it has a good balance sheet,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","730500","736180"," you can get in, which brings me to Foot Locker."
"_zb0kga97sQ","736180","738300"," Foot Locker upgraded, OK?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","738300","740780"," It does not have a good balance sheet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","740780","742340"," My trust owns it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","742340","744980"," It's been disappointing, but not anymore."
"_zb0kga97sQ","744980","748220"," Because they're talking about full price merchandise."
"_zb0kga97sQ","748220","752580"," What's bedeviled them is discounting $1 billion"
"_zb0kga97sQ","752580","756340"," in inventory that wasn't going to close in 70 champs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","756340","757420"," This is Mary Dylan."
"_zb0kga97sQ","757420","759580"," It's never paid the bet against Mary Dylan."
"_zb0kga97sQ","759580","761300"," She turned around Ulta."
"_zb0kga97sQ","761300","764700"," She's going to do it again with Foot Locker."
"_zb0kga97sQ","764700","768340"," Even as everybody feels that she doesn't have the horses."
"_zb0kga97sQ","768340","769060"," She's got Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","769060","771980"," She's got new balances doing incredibly well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","771980","773940"," People don't talk about a new balance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","773940","775980"," Don't forget, Hulk is doing well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","775980","778700"," We're going to get, well, we've got Foot Locker upgrade."
"_zb0kga97sQ","778700","779580"," Piper goes to overweight."
"_zb0kga97sQ","779580","780900"," We'll get Costco tonight."
"_zb0kga97sQ","780900","782860"," Costco is going to be one where I think we're going to say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","782860","785300"," well, that's an A student."
"_zb0kga97sQ","785300","788420"," I'm looking for a C student that's going to be common A student."
"_zb0kga97sQ","788420","789580"," I don't need an A student."
"_zb0kga97sQ","789580","790380"," It's been the best time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","790380","791620"," That was an all-time high yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","791620","795420"," And again, today, I would think maybe."
"_zb0kga97sQ","795420","798220"," Etsy, these layoffs, Bernstein today"
"_zb0kga97sQ","798220","799660"," calls it the new eBay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","799660","800900"," And a good short."
"_zb0kga97sQ","800900","802660"," That is so aggressive."
"_zb0kga97sQ","802660","803860"," I think that's wrong."
"_zb0kga97sQ","803860","806900"," I think that Josh, someone was overstaffed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","806900","808980"," I think that there's a lot to like."
"_zb0kga97sQ","808980","812340"," But it was one of those companies that are like O'Hanna,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","812340","816780"," like Salesforce had, when the O'Hanna before LA got involved."
"_zb0kga97sQ","816780","819220"," And it was not as interested in the O'Hanna."
"_zb0kga97sQ","819220","821420"," We're Hawaiian family."
"_zb0kga97sQ","821420","823900"," The Hawaiian word for family is O'Hanna, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","823900","826180"," And Salesforce had a more O'Hanna approach."
"_zb0kga97sQ","826180","827660"," Yeah, but that went out the window."
"_zb0kga97sQ","827660","829340"," And then when they got a bunch of activists,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","829340","831100"," they started to focus more on margins."
"_zb0kga97sQ","832020","834300"," But just not hiring as many."
"_zb0kga97sQ","834300","836260"," And even firing some people."
"_zb0kga97sQ","836260","837100"," Yes."
"_zb0kga97sQ","837100","839100"," Yes, they actually down 10,000."
"_zb0kga97sQ","839100","840780"," So your point is on Etsy, what?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","840780","842740"," That they were overstaffed?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","842740","846500"," I just think that Etsy could be a remarkable stock again."
"_zb0kga97sQ","846500","849980"," But obviously, they had two big of table employment."
"_zb0kga97sQ","849980","850820"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","850820","851820"," Right here in Brooklyn."
"_zb0kga97sQ","851820","853180"," Right here in Brooklyn."
"_zb0kga97sQ","853180","856180"," Look, I happen to think that obviously,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","856180","858860"," they're worried about Christmas and probably not that good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","858860","860500"," But I also think it's a franchise."
"_zb0kga97sQ","860500","861380"," It's a good franchise."
"_zb0kga97sQ","861380","862180"," You do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","862180","863660"," Yeah, I do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","863660","866300"," Let's talk a little Moderna because that stock is up sharply."
"_zb0kga97sQ","866300","869580"," It does typically trade in big increments"
"_zb0kga97sQ","869580","872660"," percentage-wise on news, sometimes not even on any."
"_zb0kga97sQ","872660","875180"," But this morning, the news is potentially"
"_zb0kga97sQ","875180","879300"," a real positive for people with resected high-risk melanoma."
"_zb0kga97sQ","879300","882220"," They've been testing their cancer vaccine, essentially,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","882220","884740"," for lack of the better term, with Petruda."
"_zb0kga97sQ","884740","887820"," Of course, one of the great cancer fighting drugs from Merck."
"_zb0kga97sQ","887820","890220"," And they got some decent results, Jim."
"_zb0kga97sQ","890220","892460"," Yeah, I think I'm so glad you call it the vaccine."
"_zb0kga97sQ","892460","896700"," Wait, when I first interviewed seven bandsale,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","896700","898780"," it was at the Jake P. Morgan Conference."
"_zb0kga97sQ","898780","899820"," The stock was 11."
"_zb0kga97sQ","899820","901500"," Members thought it went up big."
"_zb0kga97sQ","901500","904260"," And he said, we're going to develop vaccines for cancer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","904260","905580"," And I said, I believe it when I see it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","905580","906100"," I know."
"_zb0kga97sQ","906100","906820"," And then he did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","906820","908020"," And then he did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","908020","910340"," Staphon bandsale was a guest on Squawk Box this morning,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","910340","912340"," talking about this latest trial."
"_zb0kga97sQ","912340","914700"," As you can see, sort of the headlines on it right there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","914700","917820"," Take a listen to what he thought."
"_zb0kga97sQ","917820","920540"," Now, at a three-year mark in the same study,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","920540","922140"," we're showing almost 50%,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","922140","925500"," meaning the two curves are differentiating further"
"_zb0kga97sQ","925500","927060"," as time goes by."
"_zb0kga97sQ","927060","930020"," And that's really exciting because not only"
"_zb0kga97sQ","930020","932020"," we think to have a huge impact on melanoma,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","932020","934020"," it's one in two people."
"_zb0kga97sQ","934020","936580"," Think about the number of lives that can be impacted,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","936580","937940"," the number of people that can be saved"
"_zb0kga97sQ","937940","939380"," and live a normal life,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","939380","941420"," despite the diagnostic of cancer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","943260","944980"," Very exciting, yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","945020","947100"," Now, we know cancers, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","947100","950580"," people think that cancer's all one disease and it's not."
"_zb0kga97sQ","950580","953580"," But I just think that this is something that tells me"
"_zb0kga97sQ","953580","957100"," that the original franchise is finally here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","957100","959580"," And that's something that's worth more than just"
"_zb0kga97sQ","959580","960620"," where the stock is."
"_zb0kga97sQ","960620","962140"," But David, as great as this one is,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","962140","965100"," the stock that people keep talking about is vertex."
"_zb0kga97sQ","965100","967740"," Because if you do have a pain drug"
"_zb0kga97sQ","967740","972900"," and it does not cause habit forming behavior,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","972900","974420"," then you have to buy the stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","974420","976380"," And it's coming down, so it's an opportunity."
"_zb0kga97sQ","976380","979420"," Yeah, it was up yesterday, of course, we discussed it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","979420","980260"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","980260","982620"," The positive of his face to trial, I believe."
"_zb0kga97sQ","982620","985140"," Yeah, but that's the, they publicized that,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","985140","986860"," which was meaning their confidence levels."
"_zb0kga97sQ","986860","987700"," Very hard."
"_zb0kga97sQ","987700","989380"," Conceivably would replace opioids"
"_zb0kga97sQ","989380","990500"," in terms of pain management,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","990500","993060"," which obviously would be a very big deal."
"_zb0kga97sQ","993060","993900"," Yes."
"_zb0kga97sQ","994780","996980"," We still are in the midst of an absolute crisis"
"_zb0kga97sQ","996980","997860"," in this country."
"_zb0kga97sQ","997860","999340"," Oh my, it's just hard."
"_zb0kga97sQ","999340","1001100"," We don't talk about that often."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1001100","1003060"," Why don't we, because you know it's at the core"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1003060","1007420"," of a lot of the problems with employment, health care."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1007420","1008420"," And we don't talk about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1008420","1009820"," We're hearing people a day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1009820","1012580"," People dying of opioid or opioid related."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1012580","1014980"," So if you had something, you could change,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1014980","1016740"," you could change whole towns."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1018420","1022380"," Got a record high on Apple Gym, 199.62."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1022380","1025180"," City today names it a top pick for 24."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1025180","1026900"," They say the bears are missing,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1026900","1028460"," iPhone, premiumization,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1028460","1031740"," silicon, insourcing, acceleration and services."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1031780","1035100"," They think Vision Pro and AI is just a upside catalyst."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1035100","1037580"," Yeah, look, I have to tell you,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1037580","1041620"," I think that, I thought that that report was very good"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1041620","1043940"," in terms of talking about the service revenue."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1043940","1044980"," They're using 16%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1044980","1046660"," I think they're actually low-balling."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1046660","1049020"," But Mike Seaver at T-Mobile,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1049020","1052500"," when I interviewed him last week in Seattle,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1052500","1054780"," these guys are an amazing partner."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1054780","1056660"," And it wouldn't be, would not surprise me"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1056660","1058340"," if they partner on some bigger stuff"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1058340","1060180"," than they're just doing right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1060180","1064100"," But Mike said that just opening an account"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1064100","1066420"," with an iPhone is the easiest thing on the boat."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1066420","1068500"," And their numbers are the best."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1068500","1071660"," Speaking of chips, Intel's gonna announce some processors"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1071660","1074060"," today that might improve the AI story."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1074060","1076260"," That's the second best down name of the year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1076260","1077100"," I know."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1077100","1079500"," And I got a hand to them, they are making a turn."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1079500","1081500"," But AMD is ahead of them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1081500","1083660"," And Nvidia is the king."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1085860","1086860"," Nvidia is the king."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1086860","1087700"," It's the king."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1087700","1090580"," Did you bring the piece in the journal"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1090580","1093860"," or the piece in New York?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1093860","1095060"," I did read the New York piece."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1095060","1096420"," Yeah, on Jensen, absolutely."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1096420","1098500"," I think the Denny's great piece of great story."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1098500","1100420"," Well, remember what he said about Intel."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1100420","1102660"," I flee Intel every chance I get."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1102660","1104140"," That was fantastic."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1105780","1107020"," I urge people to read it because she"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1107020","1108500"," need to know who this man is."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1108500","1110820"," In our never-ending sort of discussion"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1110820","1113420"," about advances in AI and generative AI"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1113420","1115500"," and where we are guys, I don't know"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1115580","1118580"," if you saw the latest entry from Tesla"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1118580","1121820"," in terms of its optimist robot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1121820","1124460"," You see what this thing can do?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1126460","1128500"," It can pick up an egg now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1130860","1131780"," That's a robot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1134500","1135340"," There we go."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1135340","1136180"," There's an egg."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1136180","1138340"," That is, by the way, that's huge right there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1138340","1139740"," I see you an egg."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1139740","1141740"," Because that was really,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1141740","1144220"," hand me in a manipulation is a key here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1144220","1147140"," I mean, of course, it can walk, it can dance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1147140","1149180"," But now it's got brand new hands."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1149180","1152380"," I see you with the super-generative AI in that thing,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1152380","1153940"," and what's what we got?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1153940","1155900"," Okay, I see you with the hint in the egg."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1155900","1158940"," But how about a dog that can pick up Jell-O?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1158940","1161300"," Jensen, dogs picking up Jell-O?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1163140","1163980"," Bingo!"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1165900","1167060"," No?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1167060","1170220"," We all need Jell-O picking up dogs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1170220","1171820"," Jell-harders pick up Jell-O?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1172460","1174820"," This thing can walk all over your house."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1174820","1177220"," It could probably make you breakfast pretty soon."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1177220","1178940"," I, you know, I talked."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1178940","1179940"," I did not talk about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1179940","1180780"," I went to a luncheon."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1180780","1181820"," By the way, they say they were a year away"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1181820","1183780"," from this thing being able to thread a needle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1185220","1186060"," Really?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1186060","1186900"," Yes."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1186900","1188580"," Well, okay, I can do that now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1188580","1190180"," And do you remember when Musk said"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1190180","1192980"," we're gonna have a robot for every person?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1192980","1195180"," One-on-one, one-on-one ratio?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1195180","1196700"," I know, well, it's just, I just want to worry"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1196700","1199580"," about the sand wall being much more, you know."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1199580","1200500"," And it dances."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1200500","1201620"," So if you want to have a dance party,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1201620","1203100"," you can take a listen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1203100","1203940"," It dances."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1217660","1218500"," Hey."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1218500","1219340"," I've seen you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1219340","1220180"," In question nothing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1220180","1221020"," In question nothing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1221020","1222020"," Those were nice moves."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1222020","1223060"," Now, David."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1223060","1224060"," Yes, Jim."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1224060","1227220"," This just makes you even more fearful, I presume."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1227220","1228060"," Of course."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1228060","1230340"," Because Chantenu last night, Chantenu Ryan,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1230340","1233220"," Adobe said, look, don't have to worry about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1233220","1234060"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1234060","1235580"," Because it's gonna have an off-on switch."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1235580","1236420"," Sure."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1236420","1237260"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1237260","1239580"," Come on, you remember that Will Smith movie?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1239580","1240420"," It's a good movie."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1240420","1241260"," A robot?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1241260","1242100"," Oh, yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1242100","1243740"," Yeah, I thought it was a device."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1243740","1246900"," I just think that the fear I have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1246900","1250100"," is the fear of they have 100 people,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1250100","1252300"," 100 this brain that's in any brain."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1252300","1253140"," Oh, it's gonna be brain."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1253140","1255020"," When it's got higher intelligence than we have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1255020","1256420"," and it's fully mobile."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1256420","1258340"," Well, oh, yeah, they're gonna have to know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1258340","1259580"," they're gonna just be our slaves."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1259580","1263060"," Well, no, I think maybe it could be the other way around."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1263060","1266460"," Well, Chantenu does, he will give this and say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1266460","1268980"," I want a summary of this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1268980","1271020"," And he gets the summary of it and he does this,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1271020","1272020"," actually, in real life."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1272020","1272860"," That's the best."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1272860","1273700"," It gets the summary of a minute."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1273700","1274860"," No, I'm sitting there reading."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1274860","1277820"," You know, I'm sitting there reading about WK Kellogg."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1277820","1279700"," And he's like, got the summary."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1279700","1281100"," And he knows he doesn't need to read it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1281100","1284340"," Here's the edge on me, Chantenu."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1284340","1287860"," So he's thinking about humanity and the war with machines"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1287900","1290180"," and you're like my seller, whole WK Kellogg."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1290180","1291580"," Yeah, I'm trying to find out about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1291580","1292380"," I'm out of history."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1292380","1293220"," I'm out of history."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1293220","1296380"," It started as a sanitarium in Michigan there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1296380","1297460"," Wasn't that what it started with?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1297460","1298660"," And then he fed everybody, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1298660","1300460"," he gave everybody sort of a nice breakfast."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1300460","1302500"," Well, all I know is just that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1302500","1303340"," Battle Creek, then?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1303340","1305260"," He said, yes, they have to kill him."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1305260","1307580"," That all I know is just that I read the things"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1307580","1308540"," that are superfluous."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1308540","1310820"," I don't know this superfluous."

"_zb0kga97sQ","1326100","1327340"," Be careful."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1327340","1332660"," But Rivian, Lucid, in other words, if you have a huge need"

"_zb0kga97sQ","1342620","1343740"," Which were up over 9%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1343740","1345700"," Rivian did sign some due to AT&T."

"_zb0kga97sQ","1433140","1435820"," Well, what's amazing is, is that in-phase energy,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1435820","1438660"," which has been the consummate dog, because it turned out"

"_zb0kga97sQ","1464740","1466460"," Yeah, he was wrong on that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1466460","1468940"," Although his geopolitical worries,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1468940","1471220"," there's no reason to think those are less relevant."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1471220","1475820"," No, but I do know that this is a rally about finance,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","1953060","1955060"," And this company is summa cum laude."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1955060","1958060"," So no worries about lack of pricing power."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1958060","1961060"," No, because they're intellectual properties to be really good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1961060","1964060"," They've been able to take price pretty much consistently."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1964060","1966060"," It's not the kind of stock people went now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1966060","1968060"," But I just don't want, I'm mindful of what David was saying,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","1968060","1973060"," which is that they're buying stocks that if they're trying to buy something,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","1980060","1984060"," And it is the biggest beneficiary of the big cap stocks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","1984060","1985060"," That's good."

"_zb0kga97sQ","2009060","2014060"," Yeah, there's someone on Frank's show that talked about that's really where the action is."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2014060","2019060"," I prefer to buy a Wells Fargo, or Morgan Stanley, which my travel trust owns,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","2042060","2046060"," Well, David, that's probably what we're going to have to take off because we certainly won't be needed here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2046060","2047060"," How about a split screen here?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2047060","2048060"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2048060","2049060"," Really great."

"_zb0kga97sQ","2289060","2291060"," So more buying of treasuries"

"_zb0kga97sQ","2396060","2398060"," they'd be at a six and a half month"

"_zb0kga97sQ","2401060","2403060"," It'd be nearly five months, but"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2403060","2404060"," more importantly, look at the"

"_zb0kga97sQ","2405060","2407060"," Two-year note yields are now down"

"_zb0kga97sQ","2419060","2421060"," They're currently trading at three"

"_zb0kga97sQ","2422060","2423060"," Sarah, back to you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2423060","2424060"," It's amazing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2424060","2426060"," So we just wiped out a year of high"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2426060","2427060"," yields, basically."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2427060","2428060"," A whole year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2428060","2429060"," Unbelievable."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2429060","2430060"," Thank you, Rick."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2430060","2432060"," It speaks to how ferocious this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2432060","2434060"," treasury rally has been post-fed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2434060","2436060"," Guys, and we also just got in the last"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2436060","2438060"," hour the news conference from"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2438060","2440060"," the president, Christine Lagarde,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2440060","2442060"," who also paused on rate hikes,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2442060","2444060"," but had a very different message"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2444060","2446060"," for the market surrounding rate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2446060","2447060"," cuts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2447060","2448060"," Listen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2448060","2450060"," We did not."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2450060","2455060"," We did not discuss rate cuts at all."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2455060","2459060"," No discussion, no debate on this issue."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2459060","2460060"," And I think everybody in the room"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2460060","2462060"," takes the view that between hike"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2462060","2465060"," and cut, there's a whole plateau,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2465060","2468060"," whole beach of hold."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2468060","2470060"," That was very different than the message"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2470060","2472060"," we heard from Fed Chair Powell yesterday"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2472060","2474060"," on the subject of rate cuts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2474060","2476060"," Listen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2476060","2479060"," A question of when will it become"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2479060","2481060"," appropriate to begin dialing back the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2481060","2483060"," amount of policy restraint in place?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2483060","2486060"," That begins to come into view and is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2486060","2488060"," clearly a topic of discussion now in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2488060","2491060"," the world and also a discussion for us"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2491060","2494060"," at our meeting today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2495060","2497060"," They discussed it at the meeting today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2497060","2499060"," So very different message."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2499060","2501060"," David, I think underscores why"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2501060","2504060"," Powell was remarkably and surprisingly"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2504060","2505060"," dovish."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2505060","2507060"," It started with the three rate cuts"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2507060","2508060"," that were penciled into their"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2508060","2510060"," summary of economic projections."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2510060","2511060"," I think I and a lot of people were"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2511060","2513060"," surprised by that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2513060","2514060"," And then it continued with the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2514060","2516060"," statement where we knew they were"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2516060","2517060"," going to maybe make some tweaks"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2517060","2518060"," around the language about the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2518060","2519060"," tightening bias."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2519060","2521060"," They added the word any policy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2521060","2523060"," firming instead of additional policy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2523060","2524060"," firming."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2524060","2526060"," So that was a pretty well telegraphed"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2526060","2527060"," signal that they're in a different"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2527060","2528060"," mode."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2528060","2529060"," And then the biggest came in the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2529060","2531060"," news conference when he said that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2531060","2532060"," they're talking about cuts, when he said"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2532060","2534060"," that they're probably at peak rates."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2534060","2535060"," I mean there are a number of different"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2535060","2538060"," ways you can point to it, but he did not"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2538060","2540060"," talk down the market from the rate cuts"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2540060","2542060"," and in fact added fuel to that fire."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2542060","2544060"," And a lot of the economists this morning"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2544060","2546060"," are out revising their cut schedule next"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2546060","2549060"," year, adding in faster and more of them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2549060","2550060"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2550060","2553060"," And as you pointed out, not what was expected."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2553060","2554060"," Look at this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2554060","2555060"," Look at this pivot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2555060","2556060"," December 1st."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2556060","2557060"," That was the last time we heard from"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2557060","2558060"," it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2558060","2559060"," It came in less than two weeks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2559060","2560060"," It would be premature to speculate on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2560060","2562060"," when policy might ease."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2562060","2564060"," Yesterday, rate cuts are something that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2564060","2566060"," begins to come into view."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2566060","2569060"," Well, we did get some inflation reports,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2569060","2572060"," PCE and CPI, and they show that they"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2572060","2573060"," continue to be benign."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2573060","2574060"," I don't know."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2574060","2575060"," I don't have a reporting on whether"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2575060","2577060"," he's been speaking to Treasury Secretary"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2578060","2580060"," Yellen, but after my conversation with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2580060","2582060"," her yesterday, he very much is coming"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2582060","2583060"," around to her view."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2583060","2585060"," Remember, this is what she said about the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2585060","2586060"," potential for rate cuts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2586060","2588060"," I mean, she wouldn't go that far because"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2588060","2589060"," she doesn't want to interfere with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2589060","2591060"," Fed policy now at Treasury, but listen to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2591060","2593060"," what she said."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2593060","2596060"," As inflation moves down, it's in a way"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2596060","2598060"," natural that interest rate should come"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2598060","2602060"," down somewhat because real interest rates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2602060","2605060"," would otherwise increase, which can tend to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2606060","2608060"," tighten financial conditions."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2608060","2611060"," But, you know, they have two risks to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2611060","2614060"," manage one that inflation doesn't come"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2614060","2617060"," down back toward their target as they"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2617060","2620060"," envision, and the other is that the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2620060","2624060"," economy becomes too weak, and I'm going"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2624060","2627060"," to leave that call to them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2627060","2629060"," Leave the call to them, but set it's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2629060","2631060"," natural to think of bringing interest rates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2631060","2633060"," down as inflation comes lower."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2634060","2636060"," And she also made some news by saying"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2636060","2638060"," she expects inflation to have a two"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2638060","2640060"," percent in front of it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2640060","2642060"," In other words, to get to the Fed target"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2642060","2645060"," by the end of next year, it feels like"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2645060","2647060"," Powell and Yellen, again, are very"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2647060","2650060"," simpatico here on their view, and he's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2650060","2652060"," really come around to this idea of not"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2652060","2654060"," worrying too much about 70-style inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2654060","2656060"," And worth reminding people, I know most"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2656060","2658060"," of our viewers know, but she was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2658060","2659060"," chair of the Fed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2659060","2660060"," She was chair of the Fed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2660060","2662060"," And in fact, right before he was."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2662060","2663060"," Which is why I always ask her about the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2663060","2664060"," Fed, even though she doesn't want to talk"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2664060","2666060"," about the Fed as Treasury Secretary, but"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2666060","2668060"," also why, you know, her economic views have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2668060","2670060"," been very important and have been spot"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2670060","2671060"," on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2671060","2673060"," I'm sort of sick of the term soft landing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2673060","2674060"," because that's what it's all, especially"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2674060","2675060"," after talking to her."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2675060","2676060"," It's all soft landing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2676060","2677060"," And she's right, it has been, and she"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2677060","2679060"," expects that to continue into next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2679060","2681060"," But we got two data points this morning,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2681060","2683060"," guys, that confirm the soft landing, or"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2683060","2685060"," maybe we can call it immaculate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2685060","2687060"," disinflation, or maybe we can call it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2687060","2689060"," growth without threatening inflation, but"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2689060","2691060"," it's all the same point, which the market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2691060","2694060"," loves, which is we're still getting growth"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2694060","2697060"," and inflation rates are coming down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2697060","2700060"," Jobless claims continue to defy expectations."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2700060","2701060"," They're super low."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2701060","2703060"," They fell again last week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2703060","2705060"," And then retail sales came in better"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2705060","2706060"," than expected."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2706060","2708060"," On the month of 0.3%, gain eight out of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2708060","2710060"," I think the 13 categories rose."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2710060","2711060"," Restaurants led the way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2711060","2713060"," And that's the only services category in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2713060","2714060"," the report."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2714060","2715060"," But online sales were good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2715060","2716060"," Electronic sales were good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2716060","2717060"," Sarah, real quick."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2717060","2719060"," Just coming back to the top of your"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2719060","2721060"," report, what accounts for the differential"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2721060","2724060"," in language between the ECB and our Fed?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2724060","2726060"," Well, one factor could be that the ECB has"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2726060","2728060"," a single mandate on inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2728060","2730060"," And so if it's not at their target, they"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2730060","2732060"," have to be squarely focused on fighting it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2732060","2733060"," and can't let their guard down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2733060","2735060"," I think that was the exact language she used."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2735060","2738060"," The Fed also has a mandate to keep employment,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2738060","2740060"," you know, strong, and they look at growth."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2740060","2742060"," So because they're weighing both of those,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2742060","2744060"," the Fed doesn't want to wreck the good economy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2744060","2746060"," that it has in the face of falling inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2746060","2747060"," That's a big part of it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2747060","2749060"," Because Bank of England was also out this morning"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2749060","2753060"," and much more in the ECB camp of, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2753060","2755060"," we still may have some work to do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2755060","2757060"," I think they use that term on inflation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2757060","2759060"," and not signaling cuts because they're much"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2759060","2761060"," more focused on the inflationary story."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2761060","2764060"," David, but I think we will continue to debate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2764060","2767060"," on this network and in the market about whether"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2767060","2770060"," the Fed is premature here when it comes to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2770060","2772060"," talking about rate cuts with core inflation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2772060","2775060"," still at 4% double the target and the unemployment"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2775060","2779060"," rate at 3.7%, which is not really threatening"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2779060","2781060"," with a big decline in the economy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2781060","2782060"," There's no doubt about that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2782060","2784060"," We're definitely going to debate it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2784060","2786060"," Yields of falling stocks off the highs here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2786060","2788060"," Dow's up 43 now on the heels of Powell."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2788060","2790060"," Our senior economics reporter Steve Leisman"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2790060","2792060"," joins us with more on what comes next."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2792060","2795060"," Speaking of which, Steve, I see Breen now"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2795060","2798060"," referring to claims and retail sales."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2798060","2802060"," These, they say no signs of a pickup in layoff activity"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2802060","2805060"," but they do not think these provide fundamental"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2805060","2808060"," support to the outlook on the Fed funds."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2808060","2812060"," Yeah, I mean, we might be back into this zone now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2812060","2815060"," Carl, where good news is bad news if you really"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2815060","2818060"," want those cuts to come early and there"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2818060","2820060"," will be many of them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2820060","2823060"," I think also the retail sales report today is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2823060","2825060"," going to flatter the GDP numbers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2825060","2828060"," I haven't seen upward adjustments yet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2828060","2831060"," They were waiting for the inventory numbers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2831060","2832060"," To come through."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2832060","2835060"," But later this afternoon or just in a few hours,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2835060","2836060"," we'll get a few."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2836060","2838060"," My guess is that people will upgrade that outlook"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2838060","2840060"," for the fourth quarter, which you remember."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2840060","2842060"," The third quarter was a surprise."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2842060","2843060"," Why?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2843060","2844060"," Because the consumer was spending."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2844060","2846060"," The fourth quarter might be a surprise, too,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2846060","2849060"," because the consumer continues to spend our CNBC"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2849060","2852060"," NRF retail monitor data was actually spot on with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2852060","2854060"," where the government came in and pointing out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2854060","2856060"," this unexpected strength we've had in the consumer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2856060","2860060"," Let me go back a second and add to Sarah's answer"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2860060","2863060"," about the difference in the ECB and the Fed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2863060","2866060"," I would also add to her, I agree with all of her points,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2866060","2869060"," but I would add that the Fed was earlier in terms of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2869060","2872060"," raising interest rates and it also went further"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2872060","2873060"," than the ECB went."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2873060","2876060"," So the idea that they would pivot earlier also makes"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2876060","2877060"," sense here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2877060","2879060"," The guard clearly not ready."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2879060","2881060"," I liked her comment also where she said it's not"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2881060","2884060"," time to let our guard down when it comes to inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2884060","2886060"," She's not ready yet to make that call."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2886060","2889060"," And of course, I would underscore Sarah's answer"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2889060","2891060"," about them having the single mandate,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2891060","2894060"," whereas Powell's trying to really balance both mandates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2894060","2896060"," and you heard a lot yesterday from Powell,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2896060","2899060"," in my opinion, anyway, about how much concern there is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2899060","2901060"," about the other side of the mandate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2901060","2903060"," I don't know if the Fed is looking at something scarier."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2903060","2905060"," I think you're asking the right question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2905060","2908060"," What happened between December 1st and today?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2908060","2911060"," I went back and reread the whole interview at Spellman"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2911060","2914060"," and it's very hard to get from Powell's last interview"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2914060","2915060"," to where he is today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2915060","2917060"," I've got a couple of suspicions."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2917060","2919060"," One is that the inflation numbers,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2919060","2921060"," he had a more dovish read than the market did on it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2921060","2922060"," That was one."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2922060","2924060"," And two is, I think maybe his committee started to get"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2924060","2927060"," a little more dovish than either he was or he was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2927060","2929060"," ready to go and the downside of all this,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2929060","2931060"," which you guys are already toying with,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2931060","2935060"," is have financial conditions loosened too much now"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2935060","2938060"," that's going to make the job of fighting inflation harder."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2938060","2940060"," Although on that point, you mentioned GDP."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2940060","2943060"," Goldman goes to two, which is almost double consensus."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2943060","2946060"," And Jan's point last night was that some of these"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2946060","2949060"," conditions from October on, they think are durable"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2949060","2951060"," because of what inflation has done."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2951060","2953060"," I think that's right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2953060","2955060"," And remember you had Rick point out that the two years"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2955060","2958060"," now down on the year, which is quite remarkable."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2958060","2960060"," Now we did have Michael Gaping on Squatbox this morning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2960060","2963060"," He thinks financial conditions are still relatively tight"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2963060","2966060"," or I guess tight enough for the Federal Reserve."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2966060","2968060"," But we'll just have to play it by ear."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2968060","2972060"," I don't think, if money's not free again, just to be clear,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2973060","2977060"," when you look at what the average Fed official is planning"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2977060","2980060"," and you think about it in terms of real interest rates,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2980060","2982060"," which is how many of them thinking about it,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2982060","2986060"," the Fed is not seeing itself loosening up very much at all."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2986060","2989060"," Do the math and take the Fed funds rate minus their core PCE rate,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","2989060","2993060"," which is imperfect according to a lot of the wonks out there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2993060","2995060"," But it's just a benchmark way of thinking about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2995060","2998060"," They're still looking at 2.2% real."
"_zb0kga97sQ","2998060","3002060"," So the only reason they come down, according to their own forecast,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3002060","3004060"," is because inflation comes down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3004060","3008060"," They are not reducing interest rates to ease financial conditions,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3008060","3010060"," so to speak."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3010060","3014060"," Steve, thank you and continue the conversation, of course."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3014060","3017060"," Let's get more on the market implications of this move."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3017060","3020060"," We want to bring in senior markets commentator Mike Santoli."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3020060","3022060"," Mike, we've remarked on, obviously, any of those companies"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3022060","3025060"," that are either highly leveraged or reliant on the financing markets"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3025060","3029060"," for future growth and or just keeping their business going"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3029060","3030060"," are benefiting today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3030060","3031060"," But what else are you seeing?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3031060","3034060"," Yeah, I mean, David, it pushes off the day of reckoning"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3034060","3037060"," if there was going to be one for highly leveraged companies."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3037060","3040060"," It probably puts a little bit of a refinancing refresh cycle out there,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3040060","3043060"," going to stoke a push of housing demand as well,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3043060","3044060"," mortgage rates crashing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3044060","3046060"," So all those things underway."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3046060","3051060"," I think what the market reaction did is it basically set the,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3051060","3055060"," don't fight the Fed and don't fight the tape rules in sync to say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3055060","3059060"," you know, that we have this really pretty impressive bullish uptrend,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3059060","3062060"," a breakout in the indexes and mostly,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3062060","3066060"," and not just because, you know, the market is craving and pushing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3066060","3068060"," for lower Fed funds rate down the road,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3068060","3073060"," but because Powell explicitly tried to further delink Fed policy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3073060","3077060"," in the short term from what the economy has to do to get us there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3077060","3078060"," Right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3078060","3082060"," The Fed doesn't anymore feel like it needs to really kneecap the economy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3082060","3083060"," to get the job done."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3083060","3086060"," And I think in answer to the question you guys have been talking about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3086060","3089060"," what changed recently, I really do think it's the preponderance"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3089060","3092060"," of benign inflation numbers that have built up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3092060","3096060"," You've got this run of data that have not just been pretty much"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3096060","3100060"," right center in line with the soft landing thesis,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3100060","3103060"," but also coming in really close to forecast."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3103060","3107060"," So I think no surprises and numbers that are exactly as you might want"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3107060","3110060"," to draw them up have combined to create this confidence"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3110060","3114060"," that the disinflationary trend is reliable at the moment,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3114060","3118060"," and there's time to figure out how that develops without having to do"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3118060","3120060"," anything on rates for a little while."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3120060","3124060"," So now, in the very short term, the stock market's quite extended."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3124060","3125060"," You know, we did have this breakout."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3125060","3127060"," It's really brought all to the good,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3127060","3130060"," but you definitely are getting a little bit stretched out there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3130060","3132060"," And so many things have been working together."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3132060","3136060"," You had the short squeeze low quality rally and stocks that have been left for dead."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3136060","3140060"," You had the rate relief rally, pressure off the bank's balance sheets,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3140060","3143060"," the soft landing celebration, and then you had the repositioning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3143060","3145060"," People just were not prepared for a strong stock market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3145060","3146060"," They need to raise exposure."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3146060","3148060"," A lot of that stuff has probably played out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3148060","3151060"," Maybe it's the first quarter's business to try and reconcile some of that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3151060","3154060"," and have a bit of a gut check, and maybe we're going to have to,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3154060","3156060"," you know, kind of reset a little bit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3156060","3160060"," But for now, it really did kind of check off all the market's boxes."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3160060","3164060"," I know it's fed first when it comes to the market these days"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3164060","3167060"," and the equity rally, but now that we're getting to these levels,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3167060","3172060"," I do wonder, Mike, with the GDP picture subdued, even if it ticks higher"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3172060","3175060"," for fourth quarter after retail sales, earnings expectations."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3175060","3178060"," How realistic are they into next year?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3178060","3179060"," Yeah, I mean, that's the question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3179060","3183060"," First of all, the fourth quarter earnings forecast have been cut pretty significantly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3183060","3187060"," I mean, it probably sets off a pretty easy beat cycle once we get the reports,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3187060","3193060"," but I think the test of whether 2024 earnings are plausible"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3193060","3196060"," it's out there, probably a couple of quarters."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3196060","3200060"," It's a back-end loaded forecast at this point, as you wouldn't be surprised to hear."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3200060","3203060"," It is typically the stronger growth coming in the latter half of the year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3203060","3208060"," But I think what the Fed's message and the sturdy current economic data do"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3208060","3213060"," is it gives a longer leash for companies to prove that those numbers are plausible."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3213060","3216060"," So the market might be able to look through a little more weakness than you might expect."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3216060","3221060"," Look, we got, you know, warnings from Adobe and Oracle and Pfizer and Etsy,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3221060","3226060"," and they don't really seem to be causing that many ripple effects in other companies"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3226060","3229060"," because they think we're willing to give the benefit of the doubt."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3229060","3233060"," They're also coming from companies that had been weaker and struggling,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3233060","3236060"," whether it's Etsy or Hasbro before."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3236060","3238060"," Thank you very much, Mike Santoli."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3238060","3241060"," As we had to break, here's our roadmap for the rest of the hour."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3251060","3255060"," Good for auto stocks in 2024. We have some top picks for you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3255060","3257060"," The down top being 37K for the first time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3257060","3260060"," We'll do a look at the stocks that are fueling those gains."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3260060","3262060"," And a number of home builders are also hitting new highs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3262060","3266060"," We're going to discuss what is ahead for these companies and their stocks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3266060","3267060"," This, of course, is the Fed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3267060","3270060"," Here's to be focused now on potentially cutting rates next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3270060","3272060"," A lot more squat on the street for you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3272060","3273060"," Don't go anywhere."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3281060","3283060"," Don't go anywhere."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3311060","3313060"," Don't go anywhere."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3341060","3343060"," You"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3371060","3373060"," Don't go anywhere."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3401060","3403060"," Don't go anywhere."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3431060","3437300"," Welcome back to Squawk on the street. Earlier this week Ford announced plans to cut production"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3437300","3443380"," for the F-150 Lightning EV pickup truck. Our next guest is Barris on the auto industry overall."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3443380","3449300"," He does like Borg Warner headed into 2024. Joining us here at Post 9, Colin Langen, he's the senior"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3449300","3455860"," analyst at Wells Fargo for autos, has a buy rating on that particular stock, BWA, Price Target 47."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3455860","3459700"," It's that time of year, your best picks. I guess were you hard pressed to find one in autos,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3459700","3464340"," so you had to go to Borg Warner? I mean, I've liked Borg for a while. I mean, I am very bearish"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3464340","3469220"," on the auto sector in general. Why, why, why, why Borg? No, why are you bearish on the auto sector?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3469220","3472820"," I mean, I think there's really probably four key reasons. One, I think we're probably at peak"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3472820","3476500"," profits for the industry. And I think a lot of that's driven by pricing. I mean, we're at record"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3476500","3480180"," pricing. I think that's going to come down. If you look at the Detroit 3, they've all collectively"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3480180","3484980"," gotten $10 billion of pricing help over the since COVID. You know, two, I think people haven't paid"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3485060","3491220"," any attention to capacity. The industry has probably going to see close to a 20% increase in capacity."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3491220","3496340"," We know historically that's terrible for profitability. What happens is automakers feel pressure to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3496340","3501460"," utilize that capacity and pricing starts coming down. So it really feeds into the pricing concern."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3501460","3506660"," Three, you know, electric vehicles, right? So I think people are very excited by the fact"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3506660","3510740"," there's moderation and EV demand because these are unprofitable. But I think they're missing is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3510740","3516260"," the regulations that are behind all of this. And so for 2026, you're going to need maybe nine"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3516260","3521780"," or 10% EVs. For the Detroit 3, they're at zero to 4% right now. So they're going to need more of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3521780","3525380"," these unprofitable vehicles on the way to get there. And the last thing I don't think people are paying"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3525380","3530580"," attention to is pickups. So if you look at pickups, which are historically the vast majority of profits"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3530580","3535700"," for the Detroit 3, their inventory has been creeping up and the sales are fairly flat."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3535700","3539620"," And it's been very distracting market with the strikes and the supply chain volatility."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3539700","3544980"," But the end of the day, historically, there's a good correlation between housing starts and pickup"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3544980","3548980"," sales. And it makes sense because contractors are a big customer base. So I think you have,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3548980","3553300"," you know, a lot of negative reasons for the industry. And next year, it's very little that's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3553300","3556820"," actually good news into next year. All right. Now we'll go to board one. I appreciate your sort"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3556820","3561380"," of rounding that up for us. Why is that something within the industry that you do feel is perhaps"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3561380","3566660"," something to buy? Well, I think if you look at it, the suppliers historically can perform well,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3566660","3570500"," especially high quality suppliers, even when their customers are struggling. This is a globally"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3570500","3575620"," diversified company. They're cheap. I mean, there if you look at, you strip out some of the pricing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3575620","3579540"," help this year suppliers have been getting from cost recoveries. They are one of the fastest"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3579540","3582980"," growers this year. And yet they're not trading at a premium to the group. They're trading in line"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3582980","3587700"," with the group. There's also a company that has executed really well since COVID when there's been"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3587700","3590820"," so much volatility. And I think we're going to see more volatility for the suppliers next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3590820","3594820"," We're going to have labor costs inflation. There's going to be some FX issues. So, you know, I'd"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3594900","3598100"," rather stick with a name that is executed through all the volatility recently."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3598100","3600980"," Just on the demand question, I'm looking at the retail sales report today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3600980","3605780"," auto motor parts and parts dealers, 6.1 percent growth from this time last year,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3606420","3611060"," November number. I mean, it continues to show strong demand."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3611700","3615540"," Doesn't it? Well, I mean, we're still seeing SAR up year over year, but SAR has been fairly"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3615540","3620900"," flat. So new auto sales have been sort of flatlining in the low 15s. They're creeping up a little bit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3620900","3624580"," And there's probably upside to auto sales. But I think what we're seeing is inventories"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3624580","3629940"," up all around. And if demand was so high at current price levels, we'd actually be at a 17"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3629940","3634420"," million SAR, which is where we were before COVID. So normal demand is probably 16, 17. So there's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3634420","3638260"," actually a problem that we're only at 15 and we have plenty of inventory out there, which means"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3638260","3641300"," that we're going to need to cut prices if we want to get that volume, which goes back to the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3641300","3645460"," capacity issue. Because if we have all this unused capacity, then there's pressure to cut prices"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3645460","3649300"," because you're sitting on all these fixed costs. Colin, we're going to leave it there for today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3649300","3652900"," but thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks. Still to come this morning, as we said,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3652980","3657700"," the Dow tops 37K for the first time. We'll get a closer look at some of the stocks leading that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3657700","3663700"," charge. Plus it's an annual tradition, our cash in with some market predictions for the coming year"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3663700","3670180"," when Squawk on the street comes back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3832900","3848100"," The Dow closing at a record high yesterday, crossing above the 37,000 mark for the first time"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3848100","3853380"," ever. Let's get to Bob Bassani with a closer look at some of the stocks, Bob, leading the charge."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3853380","3858820"," I don't even know where to start with 350 new highs here at the NYSE, over 300 on the NAS."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3858820","3863220"," They just take a look. Apple, of course, obviously all-time high, visas at an all-time high. We're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3863220","3869860"," talking about that all week. IBM, six-year high, Boeing's up 23%. JP Morgan, Home Depot,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3869860","3875540"," Goldman Intel, all new highs. So the market's very overboard. How overboard is this is the big"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3875540","3880740"," conversation. What should we do in January here? 89% of the stocks in the S&P are above their 50-day"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3880740","3885700"," moving average. That is very unusual. That's a really, really broad rally here. Relative strength"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3885700","3891220"," indicator, RSI is at 78 for the S&P. Anything over 70 is considered overboard. It's hard to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3891220","3896420"," keep the market advancing every day when the market keeps going up by that much that quickly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3896420","3902100"," And it's very expensive. When you get towards 20 times forward earnings, 19.2 now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3902100","3907060"," the market gets very picky. They don't like paying that much. Normally the historic average is about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3907060","3911060"," 17 here. So there's a game that everybody's going to play now when you have a big up year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3911140","3916100"," That's the January mean reversion trade. That is, let's pick at the edges of stuff that didn't do"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3916100","3923140"," any very well in 2023. So small cap value, value doing well, small cap underperforming still."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3923140","3927860"," They'll be better recently. But you got to believe interest rates are going to come down really big."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3927860","3933300"," Consumer staples. Yeah, we saw Smuckers and Hersey down here. But that's not a big play if the market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3933300","3938260"," is going to be stabilizing around the soft landing. Energy down, but you got to believe here that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3938260","3942980"," oil is going to rally. Probably not going to happen in China. Big geopolitical plays."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3942980","3945940"," Finally, want to note here, we got the trip of witching tomorrow. It's going to be the last"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3945940","3951860"," liquidity event. A lot of volume here rebalancing on the S&P. Some NASDAQ index is rebalancing. So"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3951860","3957460"," Uber is going into the S&P 500 along with J-Bill, Builders First Source. Seal there is going out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3957460","3962820"," You want to see the effect of the S&P 500 going in? Look at this. This is Uber in the last month."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3962900","3969300"," It was $40 a month ago. Earnings came out. Everybody realized they were suddenly a candidate for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3969300","3975380"," inclusion in the S&P. Look at that. S&P, they're up 50% in one month. This is called the S&P"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3975380","3980740"," Inclusion Effect. Stock tends to rise going into the S&P 500. And then, of course, after that,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3980740","3986980"," it tends to move sideways to down. You get all the value going in as it's going into the S&P 500."
"_zb0kga97sQ","3986980","3989780"," All right. Tomorrow is going to be big. You want to talk some more cash in?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3989860","3994580"," Yeah. You know what's really great here. We just caught up with art. This is the annual"
"_zb0kga97sQ","3994580","4001780"," predictions here. So despite the 20% run up of the S&P 500 this year, I met with art over at Harry's."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4001780","4006420"," Art's very enthusiastic about the setup for 2024. I was surprised about this. He's telling me"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4006420","4013220"," election years when the sitting president tend to be very strong ones. It's an election year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4014020","4022020"," And that tends to be good for the market as people are making projections and promises and programs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4023220","4031460"," And even the upward bias on an election year when a sitting president is running for re-election,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4032180","4040100"," that compounds it even more. The best of all those historical patterns is when an incumbent"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4040100","4047140"," president is deciding to go for re-election. And he needs a decent economy to back him up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4048180","4053780"," Now, that decent economy, Art says, requires a lot more spending. And that goes to the first"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4053780","4059780"," issue that worries him in 2024, that the flood of new treasuries and less demand for art that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4059780","4063300"," particularly overseas may keep rates a bit higher than people think."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4063940","4072580"," The Chinese were big buyers of U.S. treasuries to protect their currency,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4073460","4079140"," not to put them at a trade disadvantage. For years before that, the Japanese too"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4079940","4089460"," were enormous buyers of U.S. treasuries. So we had that demand which allowed us to run deficits"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4090100","4099220"," and never start to choke up for the end. But the Chinese are having their own economic problems."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4099860","4106900"," So I don't know that they will have the latitude to buy U.S. treasuries in the scope that they have."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4108180","4113300"," A second worry is what we were just talking about, stock valuations. The broad market is very"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4113300","4117700"," pricey. Valuations are nearing extreme levels in some, but not all sectors. I asked if that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4117700","4122980"," would be an issue in January when some people who had poured cash into money market funds in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4122980","4127460"," 2023 might be tempted to come back into stocks at very high prices."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4129140","4136660"," Oh, of course it is. And that's the problem. The fear of missing out, the idea that train"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4136660","4143940"," is leaving the station, the idea of got to get on board. And so you begin to ignore multiples"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4144020","4148420"," and you pay up and that's where bubbles come from. People go in and say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4149940","4157700"," yeah, but the train is leaving the station. Am I paying a high premium? Yeah. But I've got to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4157700","4162260"," get on board before that train is gone. And that is a risk."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4164020","4169540"," My full interview with Art is going to be up on CMPC Pro later today. Art also talks about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4169540","4173300"," another worry. The looming commercial real estate problems he thinks are still going to be there"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4173300","4179620"," for banks in 2024. And he offers a surprisingly strong endorsement of the benefits of artificial"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4179620","4185540"," intelligence for the economy in 2024. This from a guy who still uses a flip phone who still"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4185540","4191860"," writes his morning newsletter by hand and calls into a secretary very interesting observations"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4191860","4195620"," on artificial intelligence and what it's going to do for the economy. So glad you got to that part"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4195620","4201380"," because the the hyper bowl thesis is a golden age of productivity and hence corporate earnings."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4201380","4205060"," He talks about that on the influence on some of the retailers and where it's going to go."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4205060","4209300"," It's just great to see art and just great to be back. We didn't do it last year and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4209300","4215540"," it's a 20 year tradition. So glad to see him. Again, the full interview on CMPC Pro later on today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4216580","4222180"," Love it. And in the holiday bow tie, of course. And he dressed up and he looked. He looked great."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4222180","4227700"," It's it's I can't describe how important that man was to me in the 1990s at how influential"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4227700","4231940"," and what a great mentor he's been to me over the last 25 years. And it's always"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4231940","4236020"," cheers me to see him. No, it's nice to see it. We miss seeing him here every single day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4236580","4241140"," Thank you, Bob. Bob is on. He's still ahead. Former Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan with his"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4241140","4246100"," take on where rates could be headed in the New Year. And when he's expecting the first rate cut,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4246100","4251300"," as we had to break, check out the biggest gainers on the S&P 500 this morning. No shortage of them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4251380","4258740"," But Moderna was some good news on the melanoma vaccine along with Merck. It's at the top 12"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4258740","4263300"," and a half percent higher. There's some others as well. Most sectors, as I mentioned, are higher."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4263300","4267940"," The banks are having a really good session. Real estate, energy materials, all leading the S&P."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4267940","4275860"," Don't go anywhere."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4281300","4283300"," You"

"_zb0kga97sQ","4515300","4526340"," is as inflation comes down the real Fed funds rate actually goes up unless you begin to cut rates."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4526340","4533140"," So the FOMC was going to have to start discussing the conditions for cutting rates. What I mean by"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4533220","4538260"," that if the nominal Fed funds rate is five and a quarter and let's say inflation depending on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4538260","4543780"," your measures running at three and a half means you have a real Fed funds rate at one and three"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4543780","4550740"," quarters if inflation continues to go down they don't want the real rate to go up they want it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4550740","4557140"," either to stay the same or even go down and so they've got room to start considering cuts"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4557220","4563140"," if they see sustained improvement and there'll be a point at which over the next year or so"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4563140","4567620"," where they're going to also think that the real Fed funds rate doesn't need to be as high."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4567620","4574020"," So this was a conversation destined to happen he had to preview at some time and he chose yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4575380","4579220"," Agree and I think actually that was it's a great explanation for it and a lot of people"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4579220","4583780"," think that obviously worry about that happening the tightening going on beyond them stopping"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4583860","4587620"," to raise interest rates I guess it's just the financial conditions on the other side that are"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4587620","4592260"," loosening pretty significantly here they were into the Fed meeting and they're doing even more"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4592260","4596340"," so out of the Fed meeting and whether that risks some of the progress that he's made on inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","4596340","4602580"," Yeah yeah so that's why people people should not overreact either to what he said he left his"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4602580","4609300"," options open he thinks they're done it's likely the next move will be down not up but but he's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4609300","4615140"," keeping the option open and and the things that they're going to and if I were there I'd be watching"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4615140","4622100"," very closely what does what does service sector inflation do good good's inflation's been"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4622100","4627860"," been very weak but the service sector is still over five percent and they want to see some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4627860","4634580"," improvement there you've got you've had a big oil rally we've got the benefit of it in the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4634660","4639780"," inflation numbers you could easily have that reverse you see that today oil is up"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4640500","4646180"," and and then the other thing is we are spending at historic levels you've heard me say this before"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4646180","4652740"," on the fiscal side that he probably won't talk about but but I think that's a big factor we're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4652740","4658100"," on our way to running a very large deficit this year and you've got unspent ARPA money inflation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4658180","4665940"," reduction act projects infrastructure act projects so they're going to want to see into 2024"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4665940","4673780"," at least two or three months of sustained improvement and there's some reasons why it might be bumpy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4673780","4678180"," but if they do see the sustained improvement they're going to be prepared to take action"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4679700","4683460"," Robert on the fiscal side though how much you know again they won't address it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4683460","4687060"," but those have said listen they've got to be aware of the interest costs and the budget and what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4687060","4694340"," that's ultimately going to mean I'm just curious like you know is is is pal looking at that as well"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4694340","4700500"," running regressions on what that's going to look like over time no it turns out listen this rate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4700500","4707460"," rally is good news for the fiscal side and that the issue for this coming year let's say we have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4707460","4714260"," 27 trillion of debt in this country held by the public okay the the treasury is going to have to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4714260","4721860"," issue nine trillion of new debt this year seven refinance and another two to finance the deficit"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4721860","4730020"," we just ran and the debt rolling off is probably in the low twos and it's going to get refinance"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4730020","4736900"," even in a positive case probably in the low fours that's 200 basis points or you know 180 billion"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4736900","4743940"," dollars more plus of interest expense before we've even started the year so I don't think the Fed"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4744260","4750420"," explicitly going to focus on it but I'll tell you I'm focused on it I think the markets will be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4750420","4755940"," focused on it we've got a substantial amount of treasury volume that we've got an issue in the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4755940","4761940"," years ahead debt the GDP is over a hundred percent and I'm more focused right now on what the 10"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4761940","4768740"," year does over the next three to six months I'm as focused on that as I am on on what decisions"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4768740","4773860"," the Fed makes and the timing of those decisions you think the 10 year stays below four percent"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4774500","4780500"," through next year I mean I don't know the reason you've got estimates all over the map"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4780980","4785140"," for those who think it's going to come down a lot more I think they're expecting a more severe"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4785140","4789460"," slowing in the economy they're expecting even a recession for those who think it's going to be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4789460","4796660"," sticky here I think they're thinking the economy will be resilient I personally think if we continue"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4796660","4803780"," to run two trillion dollar deficits into 2024 and we keep spending on these projects I think the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4803780","4808900"," economy is probably going to be more resilient than people think and the treasury is trying to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4808900","4816340"," respond to this very quietly by front end loading issuance i.e. in bills not testing the markets"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4816340","4822260"," capacity for the 10 year and the 30 year and I think this will be the one of the things I'll be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4822260","4828900"," watching very closely is how deep is the bid for duration in the treasury market and I think the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4828900","4834340"," treasury is going to be very careful about going overboard in testing that agree thank you Robert"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4834340","4838900"," Kaplan really good to get your insight especially as someone who's in the room recently former"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4838900","4846500"," Dallas Fed president or we got so we got news on that pending proxy fight from Nelson Peltz that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4846580","4852420"," we've been talking about for some time it's now official just a few moments ago Peltz's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4852420","4857300"," try-in putting out a press release confirming what our own Jim Kramer actually reported a few weeks"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4857300","4865060"," ago namely that they would nominate two not three two board members for Disney's board of course if"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4865060","4870900"," you recall Peltz a year ago is in the midst of a potential proxy fight to seat himself on Disney's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4870900","4876660"," board and then he gave up that proxy fight right after an interview that I did in early last year"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4876660","4885060"," early this year with with Bob Iger they're back and this time it is not just Peltz but also"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4885620","4892260"," another nominee Jay Rasulo which is an interesting name to note here because Mr Rasulo had been"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4892900","4901700"," the CFO at Disney from 2010 to 2015 and also had run the parks and resorts from 05 to 09"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4902580","4908020"," the Disney I know and love has lost its way uh Rasulo's quoted is saying as independent"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4908020","4912660"," voices in the boardroom he says Nelson and I are confident the combination of his decades of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4912660","4917780"," experience at Disney and Nelson's significant boardroom skills and history of driving positive"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4917780","4922900"," strategic change will get things back on track those are my words not theirs what I also would"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4922900","4928580"," share with you from their letter is the following they say the root cause of Disney's underperformance"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4929300","4936020"," in our view is a board that is too closely connected to a long tenured CEO and too disconnected"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4936020","4942100"," from shareholders interests the board we believe lacks objectivity as well as focus alignment"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4942100","4946660"," and accountability although the recent appointment of two new directors to the board is a step toward"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4946660","4952580"," greater objectivity they go on to say this reactive board self-refreshment on the eve of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4952580","4958100"," a proxy contest is insufficient in their opinion both because the new directors were chosen without"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4958100","4964100"," shareholder input and they don't seemingly own any amount of stock they do talk about Sarah"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4964100","4968900"," the fact that non-management directors collectively own less than 15 million of Disney stock"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4969540","4974740"," and then Iger has sold the vast majority of his ownership stake as well I would make a point though"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4974740","4980980"," that I believe 26 of the 33 million shares of try-in lists are actually like pearl mutters"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4980980","4985700"," not try-ins which has been a Disney argument yes against him without a doubt I mean if you"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4985700","4991700"," just look at the stock price so Peltz called off the last fight in February with you the stock was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4991700","4998420"," at over a hundred ten dollars a share it's at 93 right now so two questions what's wrong with Disney"
"_zb0kga97sQ","4998980","5003780"," and is Peltz gonna get what he wants very much unclear whether Peltz will get what he wants"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5003780","5008420"," at this point you know I would have said it's somewhat of an uphill battle for him potentially"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5008420","5014180"," to see himself Jay Rizoula is a very interesting nominee no doubt especially given his experience"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5014180","5020260"," at the company for quite a period of time both in parks although parks is not the issue here again"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5020260","5023380"," you're chance it's other part of your question I mean it really isn't about getting streaming"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5023380","5028100"," to profitability dealing of course with the collapse of the linear cable ecosystem that of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5028100","5032820"," which we've all been apart for so many years iger talks about these challenges very much"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5034420","5040660"," upfront and he has cut costs significantly far beyond in fact what they originally had targeted"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5040660","5046740"," and so while you certainly can make an argument Sarah that there needs to be more accountability"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5046740","5053300"," and that the board is too closely connected to iger so to speak i'm still seeing or not seeing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5053300","5058500"," specifics here at this point in terms of what they would recommend that they do from an execution"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5058500","5063540"," standpoint that isn't already perhaps underway at Disney my expectation would be that would be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5063540","5068500"," Disney's argument particularly with that recent board refreshment adding gorman for example from"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5068500","5073380"," Morgan Stanley to the board expectation is that try and we'll do so as we get into the pro proxy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5073380","5077220"," that would be well they usually release white papers and have all sorts of recommendations"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5077220","5081060"," exactly meantime getting some news out of dc let's get to emily wilkins with that"

"_zb0kga97sQ","5119540","5124660"," that includes trying to see if they can hold a competition to get someone who can identify"

"_zb0kga97sQ","5415620","5419620"," think is definitely going to be turbocharged by what happened yesterday i think the playbook"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5419620","5423940"," and the outlook for next year looks pretty summer so this year actually for the industry"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5423940","5429220"," still limited existing inventory out there but don't really see that changing so there's a market"

"_zb0kga97sQ","5466500","5473460"," are some fundamental tailwinds here and i think an outlook that's really quite positive for the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5473460","5479060"," industry and for the sector overall is there an argument that if rates come down enough that it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5479060","5485620"," unleashes a supply of existing homes and the new builders do face more competition yeah it's kind"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5485700","5490500"," of odd to think more interest rates might not be a good thing for home builders for certain this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5490500","5495780"," tailwind in terms of limited existing inventory the reason why there's not much existing inventory"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5495780","5502100"," out there is because 40 percent of those homeowners with the mortgage have a relief below 4 percent so"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5502100","5507380"," if you have a mortgage rate that's at 3 percent 3 and a half percent trading that for a 7 percent"

"_zb0kga97sQ","5526900","5531540"," the home builders if rates are lower likely means they don't have to offer as much in terms of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5531540","5536980"," incenses that's a tailwind for their gross margin too so from our perspective with rates potentially"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5536980","5542020"," moving lower next year mortgage rates moving lower as well we think that's a tailwind still for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5542020","5548900"," the industry i mean it was a funny environment for home builders because the stocks actually did fine"

"_zb0kga97sQ","5560500","5566900"," worried again yeah it's definitely a potential risk and this supply demand imbalance that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5566980","5572100"," in the market i think does give builders pricing power you look at what homes are going to be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","5572100","5576100"," running through their P&L this year you're going to see the impact from some of the higher incentives"

"_zb0kga97sQ","6040820","6046660"," Yeah, they're totally undervalued. These mega cap tech stocks just drove this market performance."

"_zb0kga97sQ","6211700","6217380"," think the job market is going to soften. But in that environment, we still see opportunities"

"_zb0kga97sQ","6266100","6271380"," about 100 million units in the market by year Zen. That's actually quote five times according to them,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6271380","6276180"," five times more of their competition. Qualcomm, though, speaking of competition, AMD Intel,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6276180","6281620"," they've all been pushing the AI PC, right? That means running AI applications directly"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6281620","6286580"," locally on a PC so that you don't necessarily have to use the cloud. It's better for battery"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6286580","6294980"," and it should help boost the PC market, especially as this refresh cycle begins next year in 2024."
"_zb0kga97sQ","6294980","6301140"," But recently, Dell did warn of near term softness in PC. So I asked Pat about this this morning."

"_zb0kga97sQ","6310100","6314900"," far. Intel also launching their next generation CPU. That's the new thing here today. Think of it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6314900","6319860"," like a system on a chip, the Xion that you're seeing right now, Intel has been losing market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6319860","6324980"," share to AMD in this category. So it's important for this CPU to launch and for next iterations"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6324980","6331140"," in the years to come. Lastly, Gelsinger on stage just revealed the Gaudi3 chip, which is a custom AI"

"_zb0kga97sQ","6335300","6340180"," billion dollar pipeline next year. Gelsinger, much like AMD CEO Lisa Sue, told me just last week,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6340180","6346180"," this market is big enough to offer a market for all of them. Even if Intel is offering a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6346180","6350900"," maybe a lower performance, cheaper chip, they have the supply for it. That was a key point"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6350900","6355460"," that he mentioned. But what we're seeing here that take away from this giant event here too is that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6355460","6361620"," the theme is volume. Being the first to ship Intel is claiming that right now for the the PC"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6361620","6366020"," chips that you're seeing behind me and for many of the other products. And it's getting it out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6366020","6370260"," to market as soon as possible before the competition. And that's what they're claiming right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","6371220","6376020"," All right, Christina, well, it stalks up. By the way, the whole by the losers of last year"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6376020","6381700"," turned out to be true for Intel up 73% this year after sliding sharply in 2022."

"_zb0kga97sQ","6819220","6825780"," it's just in cost centers, compliance, various ways you can process claims and insurance companies"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6825780","6831700"," and the like but it's also being used in those robo advising apps and brokerage apps that you"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6831700","6838020"," might know of. So what we've done is we did put out a proposal to with the simple concept that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6838020","6844820"," you need to keep the investors interest ahead of that of the investment advisor or broker or dealer"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6844820","6851460"," and you can't have the algorithm putting the investment advisor or the broker dealer ahead"

"_zb0kga97sQ","6935460","6942660"," ah it was that base model that got it wrong and we all kind of invariably went off a cliff based on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6942660","6949460"," that model. Are you seeing symmetry between our policy efforts in this country and Europe and Asia?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","6951060","6956180"," It's a great question each jurisdiction is taking it a little differently. In Europe they're actually"

"_zb0kga97sQ","7202100","7209620"," and what we've found is this is really the wild west and it's around the globe I would say again"
"_zb0kga97sQ","7209620","7216980"," this is a small part of our US capital markets but it can undermine confidence when so many"

"_zb0kga97sQ","8186380","8193300"," We mentioned airlines before the break when it comes to what to expect from demand this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8193300","8194300"," holiday season."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8194300","8198900"," Our next guest thinks we're in for one of the biggest travel cycles in history with leisure"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8198900","8203260"," travel remaining strong and business travel showing some signs of normalizing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8203260","8206340"," Joining us this morning is Frontier airline CEO Barry Biffle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8206340","8207340"," Very welcome back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8207340","8208900"," Good to have you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8208900","8210740"," Thanks for having us on it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8210740","8215300"," What is the bigger surprise that leisure can accelerate or that corporate can join?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8216300","8220060"," I think the bigger surprise is corporate's finally coming back, but I think it's really"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8220060","8224380"," not a surprise when you think about what's happened with kind of return to the office."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8224380","8229060"," And I think, you know, we all we often just get people prefer to stay in a hotel that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8229060","8230620"," versus their pube in their office."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8230620","8234700"," So we're not surprising to see people back traveling them, but leisure is strong and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8234700","8237620"," we're going to see one of the best holiday seasons that we've ever had."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8237620","8242780"," As far as you can tell from both your vantage point in the industries, are these capacity"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8242780","8245620"," additions for 24 going to be enough?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8245620","8246620"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8246620","8251100"," So I think, you know, look, we've had challenges, we ourselves have had challenges with kind"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8251100","8258020"," of uneven capacity growth that kind of favored the leisure markets and left a lot of kind"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8258020","8262180"," of, you know, city to city, you know, visiting friends or family markets kind of left behind."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8262180","8264140"," So that capacity is going to shift."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8264140","8265580"," And I think you're going to see it normalizing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8265580","8269340"," We're pivoting away from the over-served areas and pivoting to the underserved areas."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8269340","8272660"," And I think that normalization will be good for the airlines as well as consumers because"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8272780","8275580"," it's going to put more capacity where it's needed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8275580","8276580"," And prices."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8276580","8278420"," I mean, we've already seen a little bit of pressure on prices."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8278420","8281820"," They've, airfarers have started to come down in the CPI report."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8281820","8284700"," What's happening with pricing as these demand dynamic shifts?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8284700","8285700"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8285700","8291340"," So pricing has come down as you've seen some of the oversupply in Florida as an example."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8291340","8292340"," But we're finally seeing that stabilize."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8292340","8296220"," And I think, you know, the action that we're taking and the industry's taking, you should"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8296220","8299980"," see a bottoming in fares that we've already seen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8299980","8303540"," You know, I'm an old airline reporter when I was in my print days and I used to cover"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8303540","8307620"," Northwest and they had a saying in Minneapolis and that was about their root structure."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8307620","8311580"," They said it's cold, it's dark, but it's ours, meaning those underserved areas where"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8311580","8313300"," you could get big yield."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8313300","8314820"," Are there still markets like that?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8314820","8315820"," Oh, yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8315820","8321540"," In the United States, we've got places like Orlando and Las Vegas where I'm standing today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8321540","8326780"," which are actually up 15 to 20 percent in some cases versus 2019, but you've got other"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8326780","8330820"," areas that you mentioned, you're cold and dark areas and a lot of that, you know, your"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8330820","8335700"," Minneapolis is your Chicago's, those are many of those markets are actually flat to down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8335700","8336700"," over to 2019."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8336700","8342340"," So again, you've seen kind of an uneven return of capacity and we were part of that in some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8342340","8345820"," of the places that were too oversupplied, but we're going to shift back capacity and so"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8345820","8350220"," it'll be good for consumers because we'll bring, you know, kind of low fare relief to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8350220","8353740"," them, but it'll be good for us because it enables us to actually raise our fairs on average."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8354740","8359500"," What about the labor environment, Barry, how hard is it to find, you know, we reported"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8359500","8362700"," a lot over the year over pilot shortages."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8362700","8368500"," We've also seen some pretty significant pay rises at other airlines and unions this cycle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8368500","8372820"," I think your contract's open in 2024, so what are you, what are you bracing for on that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8372820","8373820"," front?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8373820","8380780"," Yeah, so look, we're going to have new contracts at some point, but we finally seen the labor"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8380780","8385660"," supply finally start to catch the demand and so we don't have the shortages that we"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8385660","8388980"," had fortunately in the industry, you know, if you go back a year or two."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8388980","8393460"," So it's much better place and everyone's, you know, almost overstaffed, I think, depending"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8393460","8397580"," upon the airline and the category, but everybody's got plenty of staff now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8397580","8403580"," Finally, you know, industries made some attempts at consolidation, the market's on a watch"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8403580","8405940"," for regulatory friction on that front."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8405940","8410740"," I just wonder how amiable you think regulation is right now to carriers getting together."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8411740","8417540"," Well, we're within weeks to find out the final answer in the jet blue spirit trials."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8417540","8422620"," So I think we will all know a lot more once that's done just in the next, probably the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8422620","8424700"," next few weeks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8424700","8425700"," Very appreciated."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8425700","8429860"," Obviously timely as we're getting closer to the peak holiday season, we'll talk, if"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8429860","8431700"," not before then, then early next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8431700","8432700"," Thanks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8432700","8434260"," Hey, thanks for having us on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8434260","8435260"," Very bit full of frontier."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8435260","8439420"," We're Adobe's results, the canary in the coal mine for tech in 2024."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8439420","8446420"," We're going to dig into that after the break with the stock down more than 5%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8446420","8458100"," Insight, analysis, opportunity, a look behind the curtain of what's really driving the market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8458100","8460020"," Money Movers is now online."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8460020","8463180"," Follow us on X at Money Movers CNBC."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8619420","8648460"," I'm a member."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8648460","8651980"," Look at shares of Adobe's sinking after issuing lower than expected guidance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8651980","8657180"," Deirdre Bosa on what that could tell us about 2024 and today's tech check, do you think"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8657180","8658540"," there's a broader message here?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8658540","8659540"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8659540","8664220"," And Sarah, I'm not trying to spoil the party here, but it's worth noting that not everything"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8664220","8669180"," is risk on and there could be some signs of stress building in certain areas of tech."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8669180","8673820"," You mentioned exhibit A that the Adobe shares are down last time I looked more than 6% on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8673820","8677480"," the back of its earnings, which raised some key issues for the year ahead, disappointing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8677480","8681680"," out looks slower than expected AI ramp, regulatory scrutiny."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8681680","8686220"," Its Figma acquisition announced more than a year ago, that's still making its way through"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8686220","8687220"," the DOJ."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8687220","8688720"," It's getting scrutiny abroad as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8688720","8694460"," And now there is a separate investigation from the other antitrust agency, the FTC into"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8694460","8699160"," its disclosure and subscription cancellation practices, which Adobe said could result in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8699160","8701280"," significant costs or penalties."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8701280","8704760"," This is part of a broader story that we've been telling over the past few months, that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8704760","8709600"," of more aggressive, more nimble regulators that are only ramping up scrutiny of tech,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8709600","8713520"," the rate environment in the macro backdrop, that may be getting more favorable for M&A"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8713520","8718120"," activity, but getting deals through may be another thing, and that's another point."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8718120","8720480"," Adobe is another point for that argument."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8720480","8723800"," Exhibit B, that's Oracle shares are down more than 10% this week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8723800","8728920"," Its earnings pointed, again, to slowing sequential growth in its cloud business, raising questions"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8728920","8733560"," about a software comeback that some analysts and VCs have started talking about."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8733560","8737640"," It was also a reality check coming after beaten raises from other smaller names and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8737640","8741960"," a reminder that the cloud story, it's not yet in the clear."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8741960","8745120"," Remember back to Google, which missed estimates on its cloud business, and then there was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8745120","8751040"," Amazon, which provided some hope of a bottoming of AWS growth, but management couldn't explicitly"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8751040","8752600"," say that it was the bottom."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8752600","8757360"," So if cloud growth is indeed weak, we'll get more signals in a month ahead, that could,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8757360","8761600"," in turn, signal weaker enterprise spending and economic uncertainty."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8761600","8764840"," That said, Sarah and Carl, these moves, they are constrained, they're not impacting"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8764840","8767640"," the broader software and cloud universe, yet at least."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8767640","8772040"," The story for now for Tech at Large is rates and those lower yields helping the rotation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8772040","8776680"," into high growth speculative names, while those mega caps, they take a breather today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8776680","8780760"," I'm just saying Adobe and Oracle, that could be something to keep an eye on and couldn't"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8780760","8784560"," be indicative of perhaps a broader trend as we head into 24."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8785560","8791920"," Yeah, and also just how it matches with expectations, which have been so high for this group in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8791920","8795000"," particular, and Adobe and Oracle have been beneficiaries, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8795000","8797600"," Yeah, and they report later on in the earnings season, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8797600","8802600"," So there's this tendency to think that once we get through the mega caps or the magnificent"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8802600","8807680"," seven, we're in the clear, but Oracle and Adobe are two names that are not small."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8807680","8811800"," These are big cap important names that say something about the economy at large and enterprise"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8811800","8813320"," spending in the cloud."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8813320","8818680"," So they're important to keep an eye on and they have more data to go on as well, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8818680","8822360"," What they say is really important because they're further on in the current quarter,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8822360","8826040"," so they may be seeing trends that we didn't hear from some of the larger names earlier"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8826040","8827200"," on in the earnings season."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8827200","8831800"," Yeah, two important dynamics that you mentioned, D1, of course, is the idea that these mega"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8831800","8836720"," caps were a source of funds to buy so much else in the market now that the rate environment"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8836720","8841800"," has arguably changed, but we did talk to one of the analysts who upped Microsoft yesterday"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8841880","8849360"," about IT spending intent and at least it remains pretty strong, at least in within co-pilot"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8849360","8853040"," and Microsoft and they argued it would be broader than that as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8853040","8857000"," Right, and one of the biggest questions here is we know that everyone's going to be spending"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8857000","8861800"," more on artificial intelligence, but does that replace some of their current spend, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8861800","8865880"," Is it additional or does it just replace some of the other stuff they've been spending on?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8865880","8871000"," So, you know, as Sarah said, these expectations are rising going into next year, but is that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8871000","8872680"," actually going to come through an enterprise spend?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8872680","8875240"," So, it's a key question that I don't think we have the answer to yet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8875240","8878320"," Yeah, Adobe, as you can see, down about five after that guidance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8878320","8880080"," Thanks, D1, dear to Bosa."
"_zb0kga97sQ","8880080","8884440"," Still to come this morning, the Fed's impact for energy investors, the CEO of Schenair"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8884440","8890040"," is with us, the largest producer of LNG and biggest buyer of net gas in this country when"
"_zb0kga97sQ","8890040","8891200"," Money Movers is back in two."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9081000","9104880"," Well, close out the hour with the energy sector."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9104880","9109600"," Our next guest runs one of the largest natural gas producers in the world and joins us with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9109600","9113760"," his outlook for prices during what some are expecting to be a warmer than average winter"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9113760","9115160"," across the United States."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9115160","9116760"," Schenair CEO Jack Fusco is with us."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9116760","9117760"," Jack, welcome back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9117760","9118760"," Thanks for the time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9118760","9119760"," Great to see you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9119760","9121760"," Oh, Carl, thank you for having me today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9121760","9123800"," It's good to see you also."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9123800","9128480"," It's been hard not to watch prices, I guess, of the commodity itself."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9128480","9133840"," I just ask you, what do you think, what accounts for these low levels and is the path of least"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9133840","9135440"," resistance still lower?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9136440","9139720"," Well, as you know, Carl, it's all about supply and demand."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9139720","9143360"," So the U.S. has hit an all-time production high."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9143360","9150440"," We've been producing around 105, 106 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9150440","9154800"," As you said earlier, it's a little warmer on the weather, so there's not as much demand"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9154800","9155800"," here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9155800","9160960"," It's driving prices down, but that is actually really good news to Schenair."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9160960","9167920"," So as you know, we're the largest processor of liquefied natural gas in America, but"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9167920","9174440"," our customers pay us an index price to gas, so we don't have any price exposure to natural"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9174440","9175440"," gas."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9175440","9182600"," In fact, the cheaper it is here in the United States, the better it is for demand worldwide."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9182600","9187040"," What does demand look like worldwide right now for U.S. LNG?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9187040","9189600"," It's off the charts, Sarah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9189600","9194520"," We signed another 6.5 million tons of long-term contracts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9194520","9198200"," Those are 20-year contracts with utilities around the world."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9198200","9207040"," There's Norwegian utilities, German utilities, and industrial users, Korean, Chinese, and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9207040","9208440"," those are 20-year contracts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9208440","9213600"," They start in 2028, run through 2053."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9213600","9218680"," I know it's hard to predict the trajectory of geopolitics, but is there any scenario"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9218680","9225480"," or resolution politically regarding, say, Ukraine that would interrupt the current"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9225480","9229720"," movement of these prices or demand in Europe?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9229720","9232120"," I don't see it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9232120","9237800"," So what we're doing, Carl and Sarah, is we're exporting American innovation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9237800","9245600"," So America dropped greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent over the last decade."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9245600","9251480"," We did it by switching from coal-fired power generation to natural gas-combined cycle"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9251480","9255840"," power generation, and that's what the rest of the world needs, and that's what they want"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9255840","9256920"," from us."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9256920","9265240"," They value our energy security, they value our reliability, and they value our affordability."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9265240","9269240"," And that's why the utilities are willing to sign such long-term contracts with us."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9269240","9274120"," Really quickly, Jack, what's your sense of the regulatory environment into next year as"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9274120","9278160"," you look toward expansion?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9278160","9281160"," Personally, I'm a little worried."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9281160","9286000"," We're down to three FERC commissioners."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9286000","9288240"," That's Federal Energy Regulatory Commission."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9288240","9294000"," That's the federal governing agency that oversees our operations."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9294000","9300080"," We have another commissioner that her time is up in the middle of next year, and if that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9300080","9307520"," position doesn't get filled, then we won't have a quorum, and things will come to a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9307520","9312600"," screeching halt as far as new approvals."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9312600","9316600"," We have a lot of expansions going on at our sites."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9316600","9321400"," We're currently in a $10 billion expansion down at Corpus Christi, and our customers"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9321400","9324800"," are depending on us, and our allies are depending on us."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9324800","9329720"," So we just need to keep things moving, even though I know it's an election year and things"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9329720","9331720"," get a little silly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9331720","9335360"," Jack, some important issues there, way beyond just the state of the business."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9335360","9336360"," It's good to talk to you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9336360","9337360"," Thanks for the time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9337360","9339360"," Jack Fusco, over at Chineer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9339360","9340360"," Thank you all."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9340360","9341360"," Yeah, sounding that alarm there on the regulatory environment."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9341360","9345640"," We've got a news alert to close out here on Disney who is now responding to Trian's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9345640","9347960"," nomination for the board that we brought you last hour."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9347960","9351000"," Those two names, Julia, has the response, Julia."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9351000","9354640"," Yes, Disney responding, saying the governance and nominating committee, which evaluates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9354640","9359000"," director nominations, will review the proposed Trian nominees and provide a recommendation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9359000","9361640"," to the board as part of its governance process."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9361640","9367080"," Now, just a reminder here, the Trian nominated Nelson Pels, as well as Jay Rosulo, the former"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9367080","9370840"," CFO of Disney, Longtime Parks Executive at Disney."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9370840","9375600"," Disney also saying here in this comment that it, quote, has an experienced, diverse, and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9375600","9380360"," highly qualified board that is focused on the long-term performance of the company,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9380360","9384200"," strategic growth initiatives, including the ongoing transformation of its business, the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9384200","9387760"," succession planning process, and increasing shareholder value."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9387760","9391800"," They also note that they expect to file preliminary materials for their shareholder"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9391800","9395840"," meeting, and that shareholders right now do not need to take any action."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9395840","9397840"," You see Disney shares are up 2%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9397840","9400400"," Yeah, proxy, proxy fight here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9400400","9401400"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9401400","9402400"," Julia Borsten."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9402400","9406960"," Just as we look to this rally, Carl, I would note the winners' REITs, office REITs,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9406960","9410960"," the home improvement stores and home builders."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9410960","9414720"," These are regional banks, the groups that got hit the hardest this year on the back of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9414720","9416800"," higher rates go in the other way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9416800","9419760"," And the message from Powell, that soothing message on cuts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9419760","9427080"," That 10-year got below $3.9 a while back, average 30-year fix now, Sarah, $6.62 going back"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9427080","9432800"," to May, and even though the indices aren't moving a lot on a numbers basis, breadth is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9432800","9433800"," very good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9433800","9435720"," Volume, almost $8 to $1 positive."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9435720","9438760"," Yeah, people are excited about the activity this could spur, whether it's in the housing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9438760","9443760"," market or refinancing in the corporate bond market, it has a lot of impact."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9443760","9444760"," And big op-ex tomorrow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9444760","9445760"," Let's get to the judge."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9446760","9448360"," Carl, thanks so much."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9448360","9449360"," Welcome to the Halftime Report."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9449360","9450360"," I'm Scott Wopner."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9450360","9451360"," Front and center this hour."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9451360","9454440"," The next leg of the rally, as stocks continue their post-fed pop."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9454440","9458640"," Now we ask the investment committee which sectors are now in play, given Chair Powell's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9458640","9459640"," pivot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9459640","9462960"," Joining me for the hour, Josh Brown, Rob Siege and Jim Labanthall, everybody's here at"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9462960","9464560"," Post 9 today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9464560","9467760"," Markets, we are trading at record highs on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, still above"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9467760","9468760"," $37,000."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9468760","9473840"," The 10-year lowest level since July, small caps with a 52-week high."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9473840","9476920"," The market, Josh, is raising now the probability of cuts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9476920","9481800"," March, 85%, May and June, 100%, Hotseus over at Goldman."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9481800","9485840"," We expect earlier and faster cuts from the Fed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9485840","9490960"," Our question to you first, does this pivot clear the way for the next leg of the rally?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9490960","9493920"," I think the next leg of the rally didn't wait for this pivot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9493920","9495120"," I think it front ran it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9495120","9497360"," Let's put up a chart of I-W-N."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9497360","9499560"," This is small cap value."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9499560","9501320"," This is the place to be."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9501320","9503960"," We talked about this around Thanksgiving time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9503960","9508880"," If you're betting on a year-end where everyone's chasing and people who weren't in Nvidia"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9508880","9512680"," and Apple, what are they going to do, we said this is what they're going to do, this is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9512680","9513680"," what they did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9513680","9521240"," I-W-N, small cap value ETF, is up, get ready for this, 18% over the last 30 days, which"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9521240","9527720"," of course is ridiculous until you realize how much catch-up it has to play, just to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9527720","9532240"," get anywhere close to what large cap S&P 500 names did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9532240","9538840"," That compare, that 18% is versus 7% total return for both the Triple Qs and the SPX."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9538840","9541160"," So that catch-up trade has worked."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9541160","9542200"," We knew it would come."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9542200","9543200"," It did come."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9543200","9545040"," It comes every year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9545040","9547880"," You get this much outperformance from the large caps."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9547880","9549160"," I think there's still room."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9549160","9552680"," Look at the 52-week high list today, away from small caps."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9552680","9557680"," It's anything but large cap tech, I guess Intel, with the exception of Intel, but it's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9558680","9565360"," Blackstone, BX, Lenore, Paul T. Holmes, Home Depot, Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, 52-week"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9565360","9570480"," highs, none of those companies do AI, no AI, okay?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9570480","9571480"," That's the message."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9571480","9572960"," The catch-up trade is working."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9572960","9574920"," I think it's got room and can continue to work."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9574920","9575920"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9575920","9580360"," So Rob Seachin, Goldman's head of hedge fund client coverage, Tony Pascarello, normally"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9580360","9582560"," puts a note out into the weekend."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9582560","9586600"," He put one out today, just before we came on the air in which he says, quote, I suspect"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9586600","9589040"," there's still a little bit of gas left in the tank."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9589040","9593000"," To Josh's point on small caps, he says, this was the exposure that most everyone in the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9593000","9596040"," community was short at some point in 2023."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9596040","9598200"," Well, those shorts are being covered."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9598200","9600400"," We've entered a seasonally strong period."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9600400","9604560"," Furthermore, a backdrop of easier financial conditions alongside a totally decent growth"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9604560","9608960"," trajectory fundamentally argues for strength in small caps."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9608960","9610440"," Do you agree?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9610440","9611440"," Do you agree?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9611440","9617360"," That for longer has been taken off the table, refinancing risk has come down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9617360","9619880"," I think there's going to be a broadening out of markets."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9619880","9623120"," When you look at this from a macro level, Scott, there's a number of ways that it can"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9623120","9624120"," play out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9624120","9625120"," It can play out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9625120","9626120"," Awesome."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9626120","9627120"," Too awesome."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9627120","9628200"," Or there's a problem."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9628200","9632480"," And we're in kind of the awesome camp for equities broadly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9632480","9635200"," Because of the broadening out that Josh talked about yesterday-"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9635200","9636200"," But you haven't been, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9636200","9637200"," You've been a little more-"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9637200","9639360"," Not the second half of the year we've been invested."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9639360","9644080"," Yeah, but you haven't been using words like awesome to describe what might lie ahead."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9644080","9645880"," We were in a higher for longer camp, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9645880","9647360"," We were in a higher for longer camp."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9647360","9650400"," We thought inflation was not going to break the way it broke."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9650400","9652280"," And obviously there's a lot of issues out there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9652280","9653840"," It's not like we weren't invested though."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9653840","9654840"," We were invested."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9654840","9655840"," I hear you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9655840","9661440"," And I do think when you think about the awesome side of this, you're going to see benefits"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9661440","9663040"," from animal spirits."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9663040","9665560"," IPO activity picking up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9665560","9667200"," M&A activity picking up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9667200","9672840"," How the labor market continues to remain strong as economic growth may accelerate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9672840","9677640"," Where it becomes too awesome is kind of like 1998."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9677640","9682840"," After long-term capital, when Greenspan fed the fuel on the fire, and it kind of lit"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9682840","9683840"," too high."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9683840","9686840"," But that can also be positive because we can stay positive for longer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9686840","9691600"," The problem, and this is what I want to get to, which I don't think is going to happen,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9691600","9700240"," is if the Fed starts to cause this re-acceleration in inflation, because energy prices have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9700240","9701480"," been key to this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9701480","9706440"," As you pick up an economic activity, you get a weaker dollar, you're going to start to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9706440","9711440"," probably see some re-acceleration in energy prices, which may change the inflation narrative."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9711440","9712440"," Maybe."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9712440","9718480"," I mean, so I'm still hearing Jimmy, Jimmy the Bull, about the lagging impact of what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9718480","9719960"," the Fed's already done from Wolf."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9719960","9723960"," No change in their bearish outlook for the market for 24."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9723960","9730320"," Some are pointing to 89% of stocks above their 50-day as a reason to sort of take a pause."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9730320","9735320"," And then, you know, I spoke with Gunlock yesterday right after Powell finished on closing bell"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9735320","9741640"," about the idea that is money going to come out of money markets because rates are continuing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9741640","9747160"," to drop and then push into the stock market, and that's going to fuel the next leg of the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9747160","9748160"," equity rally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9748160","9752800"," This is what he told me because he thinks that might not be the case."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9752800","9758000"," I think the logic that people have that money market bloat is going to go into the stock"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9758000","9759320"," market is wrong."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9759320","9765280"," I think it's unlikely for investors to go from risk-free six-month T-bills to the Magnificent"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9765280","9769760"," Seven at massive P.E.'s and all-time highs on the Dow Jones Industrial."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9769760","9777280"," I think they're much more likely to go from their mountain of cash in T-bills into bonds."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9777280","9780800"," I don't agree, big surprise there, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9780800","9783080"," By the way, Rob doesn't agree."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9783080","9787640"," Josh said yesterday right after Gunlock finished it, with all due respect, he didn't agree."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9787640","9788920"," So give me your reasons why you don't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9788920","9793160"," I mean, look, I can understand his point that T-bills at 5% are attractive, but they're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9793160","9797440"," not as attractive as stocks that, depending on what sector you look at, might get 5% in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9797440","9798440"," a month."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9798440","9800200"," Now, look, I am a risk taker."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9800200","9803520"," I appreciate Jimmy the bull as the moniker."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9803520","9804520"," But here's how I look at it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9804520","9805760"," And here's how I rationalize it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9805760","9808040"," I'm not just a guy with a nickname."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9808040","9812480"," If you look at, say, non-tech stocks, right, a lot of these companies have had fabulous"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9812480","9813480"," operational results."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9813480","9817640"," I'm talking about, and you guys know these stocks with me, General Motors, Alaska Airlines,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9817640","9818640"," Delta Airlines, Wind Resorts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9818640","9822880"," I can go down a long list of stocks whose operational results have been nothing short"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9822880","9826640"," of awesome, okay, but their share prices have stunk."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9826640","9831080"," And what you're seeing right now is the market realize that that recession is less and less"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9831080","9837960"," likely as the Fed pivots, and that the durability of those awesome operational results is intact"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9837960","9840640"," and is a giant mismatch from where the share prices are."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9840640","9844520"," So that 5% in a month, I mean, look, yesterday, look at those stocks, I'm just naming, we're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9844520","9847120"," up 5%, a lot of them are up 5% today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9847120","9850520"," I mean, look, if you want to play it safe, God bless you, take the T-bills."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9850520","9852880"," If you want to make some money, get in the stock market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9852880","9859960"," So the problem with the T-bills, too, so you hear people screaming 5%, 5%, dude, it's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9859960","9862440"," an annualized 5%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9862440","9868600"," If you don't own it for a year, and definitionally, you buy a six-month T-billed today, you will"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9868600","9869800"," not own it for a year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9869800","9870800"," And you're rolling it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9870800","9871800"," Six months, you will roll it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9871800","9876440"," You will not be rolling it at 5, unless the Fed stays where it is right now, which they're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9876440","9879840"," already telling you, is it likely that they won't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9879840","9885560"," So let's be careful when we say, oh, it's just 5% risk-free, annualized."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9885560","9887320"," That's not 5% in your account."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9887320","9889720"," So everyone needs to, like, chill out with that also."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9889720","9894120"," I feel like there are a couple of debate points to have around this whole issue of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9894120","9899680"," next leg of market rally and where it comes from, whether it's a rotation out of mega"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9899680","9905280"," cap winners, or if it simply is money from money markets, which Pascarello at Goldman"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9905280","9910240"," addresses as well, where he says, quote, there's nearly 6 trillion sitting in money market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9910240","9916080"," funds, household net worth around 150 trillion, wage gains continue to outrun the rest of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9916080","9917800"," the inflation basket."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9917800","9923000"," So if households want to add some value to their, some value stocks to their portfolio,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9923000","9926720"," there are plenty of ways to do so that don't involve selling the winners."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9926720","9931680"," So he's making the case for money coming out of cash from money markets and going into"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9931680","9937640"," stocks that you don't necessarily, Rob, have to have a bleed from mega cap tech to make"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9937640","9940600"," anything happen in these other lagging areas."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9940600","9941840"," You don't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9941840","9946320"," You could see it happen in financials, and we're seeing that last couple of days, last"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9946320","9949520"," few weeks, frankly, you could see it happen in industrials."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9949520","9953840"," You're going to see it happen in other capitalizations, like small cap, which is ripping."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9953840","9955440"," And I think that continues."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9955440","9956440"," I really do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9956440","9961840"," I don't know that there's a bell that's going to ring to say to everybody, hey, now's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9961840","9963960"," the time to get out of these large caps."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9963960","9967880"," They're very fundamentally sound businesses, but you are definitely going to see you're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","9967880","9968880"," running out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9968880","9969880"," I put a little mustard on that for you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9969880","9970880"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9970880","9971880"," Because I like what you're saying."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9971880","9972880"," I did this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9972880","9974680"," So we were on with Gunlock last night."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9974680","9980040"," You made the comment stocks are more overvalued than they were a few months ago."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9980040","9984840"," I think it's important to point out some stocks are, and Jeff is right about that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9984840","9986680"," But I made the comment on the whole."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9986680","9987920"," It's just not true."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9987920","9989800"," This is what I want to share."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9989800","9996760"," On a forward basis, we know the S&P 500 is selling at 19.3 times forward earnings."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9996760","9997800"," That's not cheap historically."
"_zb0kga97sQ","9997800","10000760"," It's obviously not cheap in absolute terms."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10000760","10003800"," Wide caps and small caps are both 14 times forward."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10003800","10011640"," But even more interestingly, even in the large cap universe, X tech, the S&P 500, 26 times"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10011640","10014120"," pull out tech, it's 17."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10014120","10022800"," So if I tell you, you can buy the average non tech S&P 500 name at a 17 forward PE."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10022800","10026360"," And the next move for rates is more likely to be down than up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10026360","10029160"," You probably would look at that and say, okay, great."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10029160","10031560"," I already bought a lot of cash this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10031560","10036000"," I'm part of that group that added to $6 trillion in money market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10036000","10041240"," My next move should probably be to add a stock, even if it's a large cap, if it's non tech,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10041240","10044600"," and you're buying something at 12, 13, 14 times earnings."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10044600","10048760"," It's probably a more productive move if you could think about it from a three to five"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10048760","10050220"," month standpoint."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10050220","10052760"," Not is this the right decision for the next 30 days?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10052760","10057400"," In equal weight, Josh, equal weight trades at a discount to where it typically does."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10057400","10058400"," The equal S&P."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10058400","10061000"," The equal weight is, what, 15 times, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10061000","10062000"," 14, 15."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10062000","10064080"," And I think history is somewhere north of 16."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10064080","10068880"," Maybe growing as we're watching the market sort of go down the tracks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10068880","10074160"," Speaking of buying names, not small caps, Jimmy bought United Health."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10074160","10075160"," What?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10075160","10076160"," United Health."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10076160","10077160"," There's a little bit of a story here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10077160","10081040"," I'm going to do this out of order with where you started, which is to say, I sold Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10081040","10082040"," Let's start there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10082040","10083040"," Well, you sold Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10083040","10084040"," You sold Bristol."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10084040","10086640"," You use some of the Bristol proceeds to buy United Health."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10086720","10087720"," Tell me the buy first."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10087720","10088720"," Then we get to the sell part."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10088720","10089720"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10089720","10092160"," So United Health is because I want health care exposure, all right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10092160","10093280"," This sector has been a dog."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10093280","10094280"," We know that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10094280","10095280"," It's lagged all year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10095280","10097360"," I do think that the value is there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10097360","10098360"," The dividends are there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10098360","10103640"," And I want to have healthy health care exposure, no pun intended, going into 2024 for what is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10103640","10105960"," likely to be a mean reversion trade."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10105960","10109640"," But I had to buy United Health more or less because I sold Bristol Myers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10109640","10113280"," Bristol Myers is typical of the health care sector this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10113280","10114760"," It's just done awfully."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10114760","10118400"," And I needed that tax loss, Scott, because I sold Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10118400","10122400"," Nike, you know, I'd held it for two and a half months after the last earnings report."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10122400","10124200"," That's short for you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10124200","10125200"," And you know what?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10125200","10126800"," It's up 27% in two and a half months."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10126800","10127720"," You're exactly right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10127720","10129020"," It is short for me."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10129020","10130120"," The market gave me this gift."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10130120","10131480"," I had to take it, Scott."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10131480","10132480"," Think about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10132480","10135240"," Just from a psychological point of view, do I really want to go into next week's earnings"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10135240","10137960"," report and risk that gain in two and a half months?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10137960","10139680"," The answer is, you know, it's a rhetorical question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10139680","10140680"," Of course I don't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10140680","10142680"," And I hope that holders do well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10142680","10144320"," I hope the earnings are great."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10144320","10145520"," The stock blows it out of the water."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10145520","10147680"," I got 27% in two and a half months."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10147680","10149840"," That will be good for a 12 month return for me."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10149840","10150840"," I'm going to take that money."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10150840","10152400"," I'm going to find other things to do with it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10152400","10155200"," What do you guys make of these moves, Rob?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10155200","10156200"," You first."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10156200","10157360"," I mean, you own UNH."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10157360","10158360"," You own Bristol Myers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10158360","10159360"," You don't know Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10159360","10163920"," But it is an interesting strategy to sort of take the money and run in a short period"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10163920","10169280"," of time from a name like Nike where Jim surveyed it for an awfully long period of time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10169280","10172760"," Wasn't ready to get in for an awfully long period of time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10172760","10173760"," And did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10173760","10174760"," Now he's out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10174760","10178080"," Totally get what Jim did and appreciate what he did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10178080","10181120"," We did the opposite moves of Jim though in health care."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10181120","10186200"," We've been trimming UNH, have owned it for a very long time and have been a steady trimmer"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10186200","10190120"," on declining profitability growth and free cash flow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10190120","10193920"," We did by two weeks ago on the show, B.M.Y."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10193920","10198080"," So stock's underperformed the S&P by 50% year to date."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10198080","10199640"," It's down 37%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10199640","10201760"," I'm sure there was some tax loss selling related to that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10201760","10202760"," So offset Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10202760","10203760"," Right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10203760","10204760"," It was the offset the gain in Nike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10204760","10205760"," Got it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10205760","10206760"," It's portfolio management."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10206760","10207760"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10207760","10208760"," It's portfolio management."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10208760","10209760"," Stock's cheap trades at seven times."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10209760","10212840"," I think health care is going to be a beneficiary of this broadening out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10212840","10214160"," And that's why we took it slightly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10214160","10219960"," Why is Bristol Myers so terrible this year and what what do you look what's the catalyst"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10219960","10222320"," that you think will turn the trend around."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10222320","10223760"," I don't follow it closely."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10223760","10228880"," It's it's the business has been quietly performing well and our thesis on that is that earnings"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10228880","10230400"," are bottoming here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10230400","10232560"," So really simple."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10232560","10235800"," We're trying to find ways to add value."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10235800","10240560"," Value stocks in portfolios and that was one that two weeks ago we talked about on the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10240560","10241560"," show."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10241560","10242560"," Almost a 5% dividend yield."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10242560","10243560"," Is it like solid?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10243560","10245480"," Are they debating doing anything with it?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10245480","10246960"," I don't think so."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10246960","10252480"," Why don't you think that the gains which by the way Nike called top pick today at Barclays"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10252480","10259040"," and there's been a lot more positive commentary on Nike lately than almost any other footwear"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10259040","10261840"," or apparel related stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10261840","10266200"," Remember there's been a multitude of notes in the last two to three weeks where they've"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10266200","10273280"," taken Lulu for example, not necessarily in a downgrade but down a notch in favor of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10273280","10277600"," a Nike on multiple lists that that stock has gone up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10277600","10278600"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10278600","10282640"," Look, if the stock goes to 140 from here, I'm happy for everybody who owns it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10282640","10286720"," I will try to take those proceeds, which again, look, I bought the stock at 24 times"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10286720","10290480"," forward earnings, which I was saying all along, was my line in the sand, maybe some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10290480","10294480"," people felt it's arbitrary, but I've had great success over the years buying Nike at"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10294480","10295480"," that level."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10295480","10296640"," It's now 30 times, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10296640","10299440"," That's what happens when it goes up 25%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10299440","10303960"," I will, Scott, try to find a stock with those proceeds to buy that will have the same or"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10303960","10308760"," better return as Nike going from 120 to 140, but psychologically, and there is psychology"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10308760","10309760"," involved here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10309760","10312360"," I just don't want to go into that earnings report next week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10312360","10317080"," I think they'll do fine, but if they do badly and all of a sudden, my 27% gain evaporates,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10317080","10318080"," I don't want that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10318080","10323840"," How do we feel today about financials, which have hit a 52-week high, Josh?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10323840","10331680"," Since November 1st, the real heart of this market burst, if you want to call it such,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10331680","10337680"," these stocks are up, most of them, more than 20% in some cases greater than 25."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10337680","10340240"," The only one that's not is JPM, but it's up 17."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10340240","10342600"," So it's not exactly a slouch."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10342600","10347320"," Well, I think the steepening of the yield curve is the story here, and I think the anticipation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10347320","10350800"," of that happening, because of course it hasn't happened yet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10350800","10355080"," But there were some serious questions about the balance sheets, Bank of America, most"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10355080","10360040"," notably, a lot of mortgage debt that they were upside down in, and a lot of debates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10360040","10365280"," about the health maturity portfolio versus health for sale, and whether or not that was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10365280","10370200"," a legitimate way to even think about how much liability the bank had, et cetera."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10370200","10375800"," All of those debates kind of go away if we think the forward course of rates is that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10375800","10381320"," overnight rates are going lower, and intermediate to long-term rates probably have peaked for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10381320","10382320"," the cycle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10382320","10386480"," We can stop worrying so much about some of the things that have held those stocks down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10386480","10388440"," and look at Bank of America."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10388440","10391360"," It's almost like trying to hold a beach ball underwater."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10391360","10393960"," That's a parabolic move to the upside."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10393960","10396880"," You very rarely see in a company like that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10396880","10399040"," So it's a pretty notable 180."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10399040","10400400"," I'm not in that stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10400400","10401800"," I'm in JP Morgan though."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10401800","10404520"," It's at a 52-week high today, very happily."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10404520","10408320"," A lot of the financials have gotten that benefit of what's happening in rates."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10408320","10410840"," I don't really think there's much more to it than that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10410840","10417840"," Jimmy, Mayo over at Wells Fargo today names your city, his top 2024 pick, his number one"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10417840","10419600"," large cap pick."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10419600","10423560"," Stocks up near 30 percent since November 1st."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10423560","10426760"," What do we think about financials here, specifically that stock which you own?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10426760","10430400"," I like the financials a lot here for a lot of the reasons that Josh just mentioned."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10430400","10432560"," I like Citigroup in particular."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10432560","10434440"," People have to understand this is not JP Morgan."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10434440","10436800"," It's not the same company they shouldn't be compared to one another."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10436800","10438920"," It's just in that investment banking company."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10438920","10442440"," This is a security services and cash management company."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10442440","10446280"," And what Jane Frazier, who's been CEO for two and a half years, has done is the right"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10446280","10447280"," thing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10447280","10450440"," First, she started out by rationalizing the international businesses, getting rid of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10450440","10452000"," things that were non-core."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10452000","10453000"," That's done."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10453080","10455280"," So, the next thing that's happening is the nationalizing the domestic business, getting"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10455280","10458120"," rid of expenses, cutting layers of management."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10458120","10459240"," The street is applauding."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10459240","10463520"," This is what Mike Mayo and others have wanted all along is to get the return on tangible"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10463520","10465200"," equity for Citigroup up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10465200","10467280"," You do that by cutting expenses."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10467280","10471160"," Stocks being bought back by the company below book value and out to something that Josh mentioned"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10471160","10476000"," about, you know, as the Fed takes its foot off the neck of the economy, this helps, helps"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10476000","10478640"," on the margins credit delinquencies."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10478640","10481000"," Citigroup has a very large credit card business."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10481000","10482000"," What is the growth store?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10482000","10487720"," The stock is down to 6% since she took over versus an S&P that's up about 35%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10487720","10489480"," What is the growth story?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10489480","10490480"," So we get it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10490480","10491480"," She's restructuring."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10491480","10493560"," It sounds like you agree with those moves."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10493560","10494560"," Then what?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10494560","10500600"," How does this stop not be eight times earnings, you know, still sitting at the same price"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10500600","10502400"," roughly where it's been for 15 years?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10502400","10503400"," Couple of things."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10503400","10504400"," I mean, first off, keep it simple."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10504400","10507280"," And this is why I said the comparison to JP Morgan is not right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10507280","10509560"," JP Morgan has a lot of awesome things going on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10509560","10510560"," We know that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10510640","10511640"," They've been quoted."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10511640","10512640"," Take them out of the conversation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10512640","10513640"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10513640","10514640"," No, no, no."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10514640","10515640"," Got it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10515640","10516640"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10516640","10517640"," But Citigroup is just basic banking, Josh."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10517640","10518640"," Is that a good business?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10518640","10519640"," Yeah, well, it is."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10519640","10522680"," If the economy does what we've been talking about, what I've been talking about, what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10522680","10523680"," I've been talking about."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10523680","10524680"," It's good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10524680","10525680"," We like it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10525680","10526680"," No wealth."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10526680","10527680"," That's been really lovely."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10527680","10528680"," You lend it this rate, you borrow it this rate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10528680","10529680"," It's really good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10529680","10530680"," And at the same time, you're cutting costs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10530680","10534280"," At the same time, you're credit delinquencies are getting under control."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10534280","10535480"," Stock has a lot of cash flow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10535480","10536480"," They're buying back those shares."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10536480","10540520"," And I know I talk about this a lot, but buying back shares below tangible book value"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10540520","10545000"," like at a 40% discount of tangible book value, it's a creative on the balance sheet"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10545000","10546300"," right away."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10546300","10548440"," So we're overweight financials."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10548440","10554560"," We started to add to our position in JP Morgan in June, November, we doubled our position"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10554560","10556720"," in Wells and added Co-America."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10556720","10561240"," It's up 25% since we added it on the show two weeks ago."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10561240","10563640"," I think you have to be overweight financials."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10563640","10567000"," There's going to be this broadening out of the value trade."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10567000","10569760"," Financials are one of the largest beneficiaries of that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10569760","10575480"," In addition, these companies are very, very cheap, especially the regional banks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10575480","10579320"," Would you add exposure here?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10579320","10581720"," Might be my final trade."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10581720","10583600"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10583600","10584600"," Nice tease."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10584600","10586080"," Thank you very little."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10586080","10587080"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10587080","10588080"," Let's address."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10588080","10594000"," I don't know if it's the elephant in the room or whatever, but let's address megacap."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10594000","10599480"," But the game in any way, Josh, changed for megacap stock performance yesterday with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10599480","10602080"," this apparent pivot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10602080","10604160"," That's what people are calling it by Powell."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10604160","10606720"," This rate trajectory is now lower."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10606720","10607720"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10607720","10608720"," Did the game change yesterday?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10608720","10609760"," The gold post move it all for that trade?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10609760","10613880"," I think one of the things we've learned in the post financial crisis period, we now have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10613880","10616040"," like a decade and a half of history."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10616040","10620600"," One of the things we've learned is that in periods of time where there is doubt about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10620600","10623960"," overall economic growth, these are the stocks that catch up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10624040","10628920"," They catch a bid and tend to lead the markets both on the way up and they go down less than"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10628920","10630160"," the overall market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10630160","10631600"," And there's a good reason for that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10631600","10636760"," They have secular growth or maybe they used to more so than they will now, given how big"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10636760","10637760"," they are."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10637760","10642560"," But there were market environments where there were serious concerns about global growth"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10642560","10647120"," or US growth or why can't the Fed stoke any inflation whatsoever?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10647120","10648560"," Why are we fighting this inflation?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10648560","10654400"," We had inverted yield curve in 2019, way before COVID and these stocks were leading."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10654400","10659400"," Because when you have growth and growth is scarce, you're worth more to the investing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10659400","10661960"," public and they will bid your stock up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10661960","10668080"," If the game is now going to change and we're not hung up on the recession starts next week,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10668080","10670120"," no, the week after, no, the week after that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10670120","10674800"," And we think there's a path for overall economic growth."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10674800","10680680"," That makes less sense to bid up the Mag 7 because they won't be the only growth in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10680680","10681680"," town."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10681680","10684040"," So that's the way that I think about these stocks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10684040","10687800"," They get more coveted when no one else can grow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10687800","10693080"," If other stocks, other sectors have their own growth story, they're less coveted and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10693080","10696520"," therefore should shrink in proportion to the overall market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10696520","10700480"," That's kind of Rob Gundlach's point too."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10700480","10703480"," It's not like he doesn't think stocks can do well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10703480","10708120"," It's just a quote, I think you want equal weight rather than market cap weighted at"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10708120","10709120"," this juncture."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10709120","10714880"," He's speaking directly of Mag 7, the multiple expansion that we've seen there, Apple, new"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10714880","10715880"," record high today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10715880","10717120"," But you saw the others on the list."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10717120","10721280"," There are several that are selling off just a little bit, reiterated sector weight, key"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10721280","10722280"," bank is Apple."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10722280","10725360"," A lot of the other names talked about almost on a daily basis."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10725360","10727520"," The stocks have just done incredibly well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10727520","10728880"," I asked you the same question though."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10728880","10730960"," Did the game change in any way yesterday?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10731040","10733800"," I think if it hasn't, it's going to."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10733800","10735840"," We've been overweight tech all year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10735840","10737160"," We're evaluating that right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10737160","10741000"," It's tough to evaluate it in December as you're approaching your end."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10741000","10745080"," You've got a lot of clients that have huge embedded gains in these names and even just"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10745080","10746720"," resizing the positioning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10746720","10748240"," I'll give you an example."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10748240","10751080"," We bought Broadcom in April."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10751080","10754440"," Broadcom has been such an unbelievable performer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10754440","10756480"," Record high today by the way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10756480","10759720"," And it's also iterated over weight, $1,200 bucks to target a key bank."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10759760","10764680"," And it's also become our second largest position in very short order because of that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10764680","10765680"," performance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10765680","10770240"," I think people have to pay attention as they go into next year about exactly what Josh"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10770240","10774640"," talked about, which is where am I going to get the funds if they're not coming from cash."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10774640","10776120"," And I don't want to increase equities."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10776120","10777800"," You're going to reallocate within equities."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10777800","10780200"," And so I do think there's this catch up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10780200","10784800"," I think there's going to be beneficiaries beyond the magnificent seven and you should"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10784800","10785800"," be prudent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10785800","10787280"," It doesn't mean you have to run from them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10787280","10789200"," I think that would be foolish as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10789200","10792000"," These are companies that are some of the best businesses in the world, but you have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10792000","10793000"," to right size them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10793000","10798520"," Speaking of non mag seven tech Qualcomm overweight 145 key bank, that's a 52 week high today"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10798520","10799520"," for that stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10799520","10800520"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10800520","10803280"," I mean, this stuff tails exactly with what Josh and Rob were just saying and let me point"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10803280","10807240"," out a data point that may seem arcane, but it actually matters South Korean exports are"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10807240","10808240"," up heavily."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10808240","10809240"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10809240","10810240"," What does that mean?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10810240","10811240"," Do you think South Korea is exporting?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10811240","10812240"," Let us know."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10812240","10813240"," They're exporting semiconductor chips."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10813240","10815280"," And this is semiconductor outside of AI."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10816280","10819040"," I was going to guess pretty good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10819040","10820040"," Go ahead."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10820040","10821040"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10821040","10823840"," But you know, these are semiconductor chips outside of AI."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10823840","10825520"," These are mobile phone."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10825520","10826520"," These are these are automotive."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10826520","10828440"," This is the Internet of Things is even laptops."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10828440","10829440"," Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10829440","10832800"," It's clear that the cycle has turned for mobile, which is helping Qualcomm."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10832800","10838640"," It's also never turned down for automotive, which is why NXP and Qualcomm are doing AMD"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10838640","10839640"," Josh yours."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10839640","10843400"," Top pick for the first half of next year at Rosenblatt, 52 week high, again, price target"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10843400","10844960"," 200 bucks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10844960","10847320"," I mean, this is one that I don't own enough of."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10847320","10851000"," I typically buy a stock and my assumption is I'll be wrong."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10851000","10852720"," It'll get cheaper."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10852720","10857720"," I consider that a form of shock insurance just the way I carry myself generally in life."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10857720","10859160"," I shouldn't have done that here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10859160","10860160"," I should have owned more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10860160","10864920"," So now I got a stock that's up like 45% a month and I barely own enough to even get"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10864920","10865920"," excited."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10865920","10868320"," So I don't really know how to answer your question or whether or not that does."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10868320","10872400"," I just wanted to share that because I think if I bottle it up, it doesn't do me any favors"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10872400","10873400"," later in the day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10873400","10874400"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10874400","10875400"," I'll get it out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10875400","10876400"," You feel better?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10876400","10877400"," No."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10877400","10880920"," Maybe you will after the break because we're going to take one and we come back calls in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10880920","10881920"," the day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10881920","10883200"," We've got a ton of analyst activity today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10883200","10885400"," I've got some stuff on Palo Alto."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10885400","10890400"," We're talking live nation when GM Honeywell Delta and on and on will do next."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10934400","10936800"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10936800","10938080"," Thanks so much."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10938080","10940840"," We'll see you guys next week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","10940840","10941840"," Bye."

"_zb0kga97sQ","10963880","10965880"," You"
"_zb0kga97sQ","10993880","10995880"," You"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11023880","11025880"," You"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11053880","11070880"," All right here we go calls of the day got a number to get through at h all time high for Palo Alto today the price target to 350 we do have ownership of cyber stocks not that specific but Josh you got crowd strike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11070880","11071880"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11071880","11072880"," What do you think."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11072880","11077880"," I mean this is for my perspective this is going to be a growing pie."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11077880","11089880"," I don't think it matters that much which slice you own but I think be careful because eventually they're going to be some very clear winners and not as many players as there are they are there are today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11089880","11092880"," My personal opinion crowd strikes going to be in the winter circle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11092880","11096880"," I've been saying that for years stocks up like a hundred and fifty percent this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11096880","11097880"," I'm sticking with it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11097880","11098880"," I think it goes higher."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11098880","11101880"," Rob Fortnett is your play here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11101880","11111880"," Yeah I mean the metrics on this company 40% free cash flow margins growing at 30% year on year to Josh's point these businesses are phenomenal."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11111880","11117880"," Anytime there's a concern though with any slowing top line you're going to get pullbacks because they're fully valued."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11117880","11118880"," Nails right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11118880","11119880"," So you're in a."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11119880","11120880"," No never cheap."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11120880","11121880"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11121880","11122880"," Let's do live nation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11122880","11124880"," That's yours Josh upgraded today to overweight."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11124880","11128880"," That's at Morgan Stanley price target about 25% higher than where it is now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11129880","11131880"," You're giving me all my Hanukkah gifts in one night."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11131880","11132880"," I don't know what we're doing here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11132880","11134880"," It's too it's almost too it's almost too many."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11134880","11136880"," Live nation looks great."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11136880","11139880"," Look at the stock basically sat out most of this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11139880","11143880"," It's been back and forth between the 70s and where it is right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11143880","11145880"," I do think there will be a breakout though at some point."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11145880","11147880"," I'm keeping this hold them as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11147880","11150880"," The concert business is absolutely on fire."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11150880","11154880"," What Taylor Swift did this year is absolutely historic."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11154880","11158880"," She won't be the only one I think next year you'll have massive tours."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11158880","11161880"," I could reel off a list of five or ten names."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11161880","11164880"," A very big one Drake and Jake Hall."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11164880","11166880"," These are all live nation venues."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11348880","11353880"," The durability of these operational results is intact, and with that, the share prices should go higher."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11353880","11356880"," What about Boeing, which was called a top pick today at Goldman?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11356880","11360880"," A lot of momentum, a lot of positive sentiment at Boeing, and I think it's deserved."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11372880","11375880"," It's going to allow them to pay down the debt that's on the balance sheet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11375880","11376880"," Things are looking great."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11376880","11377880"," Order book is fabulous."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11381880","11383880"," That's a catalyst that is not in the stock area."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11383880","11385880"," Last but not least, Depot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11385880","11387880"," Rob, you guys have Depot and Lowe's."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11401880","11410880"," I think, you know, as interest rates come in, economic activity is going to pick up again, specifically in the housing area."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11410880","11412880"," And there are going to be beneficiaries of that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11412880","11414880"," The stock's been on a tear."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11414880","11415880"," I'm glad we held onto it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11415880","11419880"," I was tempted to let it go earlier this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11419880","11420880"," It did nothing for a very long time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11420880","11425880"," It was so great about Home Depot, and I don't own it, and I feel terrible every time I look at it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11425880","11431880"," What's so great is, in a terrible housing market, like the one we're in now, which is basically frozen, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11431880","11433880"," So people have to stay put."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11433880","11434880"," What do they do?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11434880","11435880"," Spend money to renovate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11435880","11437880"," In a great housing market, guess what?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11437880","11439880"," They go to Home Depot anyway, and now they're building."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11439880","11443880"," And it's almost like you win either way, because they're so good at that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11443880","11446880"," You do have to be patient a lot of times with this stock, though."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11446880","11450880"," It stalls for periods of time, and like I said, patience has been rewarded."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11450880","11451880"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11451880","11453880"," Let's get the headlines now with Julia Borsten."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11461880","11468880"," The court ruled the impact of the gag order was limited and narrow, and that the gravity of potential harm from it was small."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11469880","11476880"," Closing arguments are underway now in the trial of Jonathan Majors, the actor and Marvel star accused of assaulting his former girlfriend."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11478880","11481880"," The jury is expected to begin deliberations today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11481880","11485880"," He faces up to a year in prison, if convicted, on all charges."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11485880","11487880"," And you don't see this very often."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11487880","11494880"," A bull on the loose in Northern New Jersey was spotted this morning on tracks near New York's Penn Station."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11495880","11498880"," Police eventually corralled him behind the fence and tranquilized him."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11498880","11504880"," He was taken to a nearby animal sanctuary, no word yet on how he got there in the first place."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11504880","11508880"," Scott, that's a pretty unusual reason to have delays for New Jersey Transit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11508880","11510880"," It's like a metaphor for something."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11510880","11513880"," They don't name that bull, Tom Lee."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11513880","11515880"," Those are my peeps."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11515880","11517880"," Julia, thanks on the tracks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11517880","11519880"," It's Julia Borsten."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11519880","11520880"," Somebody sent that around earlier."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11520880","11522880"," I thought it was fake."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11522880","11523880"," It's too good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11523880","11525880"," It's too on the nose."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11525880","11528880"," It's like a meme, but it actually happened."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11528880","11531880"," The bull is running today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11531880","11532880"," Not in every stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11532880","11533880"," Not in every stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11533880","11537880"," We're going to show you one that's down pretty substantially today on its guidance."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11537880","11539880"," It's from the software space."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11539880","11541880"," We do have ownership up here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11541880","11542880"," We'll do it next."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11553880","11560880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11583880","11590880"," Thanks for watching."

"_zb0kga97sQ","11673880","11680880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11703880","11726880"," It's not all fun and games today, is it, Robbie?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11726880","11729880"," Adobe's down six and a half percent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11730880","11732880"," It's about five and a half now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11732880","11733880"," Guidance was weak."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11733880","11736880"," It's one of the worst stocks in the S&P today, and you own it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11736880","11740880"," We do own it, but let's not neglect to say that it's up 88 percent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11740880","11741880"," That's fine."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11741880","11743880"," You're giving some back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11743880","11746880"," You know, listen, the guidance wasn't good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11746880","11748880"," The earnings didn't beat as much as expected."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11748880","11753880"," This is the danger of owning a stock that's kind of priced for perfection,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11753880","11757880"," because if you end up having not a perfect outcome,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11757880","11761880"," your stock's going to take a hit, and it doesn't invalidate the company."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11761880","11768880"," But I think the setup for this entire AI ecosystem is one where,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11768880","11773880"," you know, the expectations are so high that a lot of these stocks,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11773880","11776880"," if they disappoint, you're going to see stock price reactions like this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11776880","11778880"," It's no surprise."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11778880","11783880"," In the break, Josh, you were flagging snap shares, which are up four percent today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11783880","11786880"," I'm trying to count how many days in a row this stock is up,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11786880","11788880"," and I lost track at like 13."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11788880","11792880"," It conceivably could be up 15 straight days or something like that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11792880","11797880"," There's something interesting going on here where their snap plus users"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11797880","11799880"," have surprise to the upside."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11799880","11804880"," They had five million users of snap plus, which people pay $3.99 a month for."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11804880","11807880"," That jumped to above seven unexpectedly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11807880","11811880"," And one of the main reasons is the AI tools they're giving to those users."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11811880","11813880"," Imagine you're a user of snap."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11813880","11815880"," Imagine you're 14 years old again."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11815880","11818880"," Your friend sends you one of these AI generated images,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11818880","11819880"," and you're like, how'd you get that?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11819880","11821880"," And they're like, oh, snap plus."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11821880","11823880"," Oh, I want snap plus."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11823880","11828880"," So the AI story at snap is really interesting in that it could be generating"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11828880","11830880"," more paid subs than Wall Street expects."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11830880","11834880"," They got an upgrade on Monday from Wells Fargo, $22 price target."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11834880","11835880"," I am not in this name."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11835880","11837880"," It's been on my radar for a long time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11837880","11840880"," It's down huge over the last three years, and now I'm watching it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11840880","11842880"," It was a $7 stock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11842880","11848880"," I mean, it's a 52 week range is from seven and change to the 17 you're seeing here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11848880","11851880"," They're actually selling something that's not an advertisement."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11851880","11857880"," So the main revenue source for snap is ads, hence why the stock's so terrible."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11857880","11861880"," But this is another business that they're in that actually might have legs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11861880","11863880"," So I'm going to start paying attention now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11863880","11866880"," Let's kick Berkshire around for a second because they're buying more oxy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11866880","11869880"," It's like a broken record because they've been buying so much for so long at this point."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11869880","11870880"," Yeah, they love it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11870880","11871880"," 27% is the stake."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11871880","11875880"," Why don't you hit that quick and then I'll hit Jimmy too because you guys both own Berkshire."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11875880","11880880"," The thing to keep in mind about Berkshire is that they are not a dilettante when it comes to energy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11880880","11883880"," I think they own the second largest utility in the United States."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11883880","11888880"," So they understand not only the output side, but the input side as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11888880","11894880"," And so seeing them continue to accumulate the stock, I think should get people's attention."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11894880","11896880"," Energy has been a tough sector this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11896880","11898880"," It's lagged pretty much everything."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11898880","11901880"," But these are companies with tons of cash flow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11901880","11903880"," A lot of them are paying big dividends."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11903880","11907880"," And I think if Berkshire is this committed, we should probably give this space a second look as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11907880","11908880"," Jimmy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11908880","11909880"," Exactly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11909880","11910880"," Tons of cash flow from the space."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11910880","11915880"," And I think it's easy when oil comes down from $90 to $70 a barrel for people to say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11915880","11918880"," oh, see, this is why we never own fossil fuel companies."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11918880","11919880"," That's the wrong way to look at this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11919880","11922880"," We need fossil fuels for the next several years."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11922880","11927880"," It's highly likely that the economy recovers not only here but globally in the next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11927880","11928880"," This is oil demand up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11928880","11931880"," This stock trades at a 10% free cash flow yield."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11931880","11933880"," That's what's attracting Warren Buffett to it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11933880","11935880"," And those free cash flows are likely to grow as energy recovers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11935880","11936880"," Nice."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11936880","11938880"," Well, we have more stock stuff ahead."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11938880","11941880"," Steve Weiss alerted us to a stock that he's buying."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11941880","11942880"," We're going to take a break."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11942880","11943880"," We'll come back to you here from Weiss."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11943880","11953880"," Mike Santoli is on the other side of the break as well with his midday work."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11953880","11956880"," Are you following the Halftime Report podcast?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11956880","11958880"," What are you waiting for?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","11958880","11960880"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11960880","11962880"," Follow the Halftime Podcast now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","11986880","11993880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12016880","12023880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12046880","12053880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12076880","12083880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12106880","12113880"," Thanks for watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12136880","12144880"," We're back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12144880","12148880"," Our senior markets commentator Mike Santoli joining us with his midday word."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12148880","12151880"," I can't wait to hear what it is today, Michael."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12151880","12155880"," You know, we have the no pain big gain trade on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12155880","12160880"," It seems like everyone has decided that there isn't going to be really dangerous trade off"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12160880","12165880"," between what we can expect in terms of easier financial conditions and economic growth."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12165880","12167880"," So that's the view from today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12167880","12170880"," You know, on one hand, you kick it in really short bites."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12170880","12175880"," Yep, the big indexes are looking pretty extended on a very short-term basis."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12175880","12179880"," Seems like we've had this culmination moment where all the things you've been asking for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12179880","12181880"," has more or less been delivered."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12181880","12183880"," On the other hand, you know, market's ups."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12183880","12186880"," SAP is up less than 3% from the high on December 1."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12186880","12188880"," Obviously, it's flat over a two-year basis."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12188880","12193880"," And as you guys have been discussing, so many things below the very top of the index"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12193880","12196880"," have just done nothing or worse for a long period of time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12196880","12201880"," So today's a Bank of America, Home Depot, you know, type of upside leadership day"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12201880","12203880"," as opposed to a Microsoft and Lily."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12203880","12207880"," So that can probably work its way through for a little while right here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12207880","12209880"," And, you know, the dollar is in free fall."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12209880","12211880"," Everything is kind of falling into line."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12211880","12216880"," So something always comes along, you know, to kind of disturb that happy picture."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12216880","12218880"," But for now, people are acting on it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12218880","12222880"," I don't really also think that people are super over their skis with exposure"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12222880","12225880"," as looking at the National Association of Active Investment Managers,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12225880","12228880"," the fresh weekly numbers, just midday today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12228880","12233880"," And they're below the equity exposures of July, even though they've chased this rally"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12233880","12234880"," to some degree."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12234880","12238880"," Hey, Mike, 91% of the S&P 500 above the 50 day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12238880","12242880"," That's the highest since November of 2022."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12242880","12246880"," 78% of S&P 500 names above the 200 day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12246880","12249880"," That's the highest since January of this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12249880","12254880"," Historically, not the best place to be adding new positions."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12254880","12255880"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12255880","12258880"," Maybe not a cell signal, but usually not optimal."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12258880","12259880"," You'd agree with that, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12259880","12260880"," I would."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12260880","12263880"," So you have all these signals like that, which say, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12263880","12265880"," we've come a long way in a short period of time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12265880","12268880"," It's been a pretty indiscriminate rally in the short term."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12268880","12271880"," On the other hand, usually the forward implications of that,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12271880","12273880"," if you go out a few months, are positive."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12273880","12278880"," So when you have one of these big rushes higher with almost every stock running,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12278880","12280880"," it is usually time to cool off a little bit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12280880","12284880"," I don't know if that happens, you know, in this sort of seasonal air pocket here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12284880","12285880"," but you're absolutely right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12285880","12289880"," That's what I mean by saying it's kind of extended, but the message of what the market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12289880","12293880"," is trying to price in here is still relatively encouraging."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12293880","12294880"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12294880","12298880"," I mean, you got 700 points nearly on the Dow since yesterday afternoon."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12298880","12299880"," So your points well taken."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12299880","12300880"," Mike, I'll see you in a little bit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12300880","12301880"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12301880","12302880"," In closing, Bill, thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12302880","12304880"," Mike, essentially, our senior markets commentator up next."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12304880","12305880"," We're tracking the trades."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12305880","12309880"," As always, I told you, Steve Weiss just added a new name to his portfolio."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12309880","12311880"," We've got Farmer Jim's attention as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12311880","12313880"," I'll tell you about it next."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12335880","12342880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12365880","12372880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12395880","12402880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12425880","12432880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12455880","12482880"," All right, welcome back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12482880","12484880"," I told you, Steve Weiss was making a move, joins us now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12484880","12486880"," I think he's on the phone."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12486880","12491880"," Weiss, so you bought back deer, which is sold in the summer."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12491880","12492880"," Why did you do that?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12492880","12493880"," I did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12493880","12494880"," I did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12494880","12499880"," And when I sold in the summer, I said the stock trades is about 370 to 410,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12499880","12504880"," while we're trying to figure out the economy and trying to figure out the farmers construction,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12504880","12506880"," all of which they're involved in."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12506880","12510880"," So I actually did buy a little at 470, very, very little."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12510880","12513880"," And it didn't hold trade down to about 462."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12513880","12519880"," But as Powell was talking yesterday, I said, how do I get exposure in the sickles?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12519880","12524880"," Because the only exposure I truly have is in free port, which is really quite well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12524880","12528880"," And deer was the easiest for me to go to because it's a company I know well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12528880","12530880"," So I bought some yesterday as you were talking."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12530880","12534880"," I bought a little bit more this morning than the stock just ran too much."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12534880","12536880"," So I can't tell you it's going to be a long-term hold."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12536880","12538880"," I'm telling you what I do like about the company."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12538880","12543880"," And the reason why it may not be a long-term hold is I think again, I'll be able to get it cheaper."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12543880","12546880"," They cut their production schedule a little bit earlier in the year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12546880","12550880"," So management is pretty as serious to what's going on in the market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12550880","12554880"," While prices are coming down, so it's kind of ironic in a way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12554880","12560880"," Because inflation's come down, allowing Powell to say what he said yesterday in the dot flag,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12560880","12566880"," which was really focused on to add another height for this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12566880","12572880"," Prices coming down in commodities, as we've seen with corn, as we've seen with beans, sorry beans, et cetera,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12572880","12575880"," isn't great for the farmers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12575880","12581880"," So you've got that little juxtaposition of a place to come down, but not come down where you want to come down here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12581880","12586880"," Nonetheless, there's going to be a continue broadening of the market in my view."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12586880","12589880"," And this is the best way for me to get into it because I know it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12589880","12593880"," The others I'm looking at, frankly, and this will make Jim happy as well, hopefully."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12593880","12598880"," Our General Motors, I'm also looking at BMW because it's got a much larger dividend."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12598880","12602880"," So hopefully some of these fall back where I can get the exposure."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12602880","12607880"," And then the only calculation I have to go through is even if there are weaker earnings,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12607880","12613880"," which I still believe will be the case in the January quarterly announcements for the fourth quarter,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12613880","12616880"," will the market continue to look through it?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12616880","12621880"," And right now, the sort of leaning at the market will look through those announcements."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12621880","12627880"," But you want to keep that a try to buy on the initial hit, like we're seeing with Adobe today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12627880","12630880"," where it can be kind of brutal on itself."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12630880","12634880"," I was waiting for you to finish your commentary with."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12634880","12638880"," And I just want to end with a note that Jim's been right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12638880","12645880"," And I'm sorry for trying to beat him up for all these months on the market because he's looking pretty good right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12645880","12650880"," If you bought deer and even managed to utter the words,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12650880","12654880"," I'm looking at General Motors to him, we could show his face."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12654880","12663880"," I mean, that is a rule of approval of him and his view, like I've never seen before."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12663880","12665880"," Listen, I've got to hand it to Steve."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12665880","12667880"," Actually, it's not, Scott. It's not. You're all serious."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12667880","12669880"," Stop while you're ahead, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12669880","12670880"," No, no, you're not."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12670880","12671880"," No, listen."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12671880","12673880"," Hey, not ahead."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12673880","12677880"," Let me just finish the thought. It's actually not a steal of approval because Jim's position"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12677880","12680880"," and everybody has a different value player, value position."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12680880","12682880"," It really has a work the whole year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12682880","12685880"," The only things that's worked on what stocks I've involved in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12685880","12687880"," met at Microsoft and others."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12687880","12692880"," So while Jim's been bullish, it's all where you put your dollars."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12692880","12693880"," It's about positioning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12693880","12696880"," All right. I'm still going to be gracious, even though he's being a snot there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12696880","12699880"," Steve, I do applaud you. Here's why."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12699880","12701880"," When the facts change, you've got to change with it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12701880","12702880"," That's what you've done."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12702880","12703880"," You've been bearish."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12703880","12706880"," And now you're clearly pivoting with the facts on the ground."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12706880","12709880"," I'm going to let the snottishness go. I got to applaud you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12709880","12710880"," God bless us."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12710880","12712880"," I wish I could be a better man."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12712880","12714880"," I do too. I do too, Steve."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12714880","12716880"," You're coming."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12716880","12721880"," You know, I thought this conversation was going to just have a much,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12721880","12723880"," much lovelier tone to it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12723880","12724880"," I'm sorry that it didn't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12724880","12725880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12725880","12726880"," We'll see you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12726880","12728880"," You know, I actually did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12728880","12729880"," Are you here?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12729880","12730880"," He did."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12731880","12733880"," Apparently, I'm naive."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12733880","12735880"," We're back with finals next."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12760880","12762880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12790880","12792880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12820880","12822880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12850880","12852880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12880880","12881880"," Thank you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12910880","12912400"," of course, at three o'clock Eastern time,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12912400","12914520"," we'll run you right into the close,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12914520","12917360"," see if we maintain these record highs, the Dow again,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12917360","12919880"," 37,000, almost 250."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12919880","12923520"," So 500 plus yesterday, you've got another 160 today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12923520","12924560"," we'll see what we do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12924560","12926960"," We've got Anastasia Emeroso joining the conversation,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12926960","12930080"," Mark Ocada, Stacey Raskan, Joe Ternova as well,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12930080","12931920"," so we'll have some fun, a couple hours time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12931920","12932760"," Good girl."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12932760","12935240"," Do you want to talk about just what's happened in this market?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12935240","12938040"," Yeah, we actually have a breakout in progress"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12938040","12940600"," in shares of Empire State Realty Trust,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12940600","12942240"," which we've talked about on the show."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12942240","12944080"," Not for a while, last time we talked about it,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12944080","12947520"," it was seven bucks this fall, now it's almost 10."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12947520","12948800"," I think you can get above 10,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12948800","12951600"," it's been part of this huge rally in real estate,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12951600","12953480"," especially office real estate,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12953480","12956000"," company is profitable, paying a big yield."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12956000","12958440"," I think just too cheap under 10,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12958440","12960600"," I'm staying with it for those who are curious."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12960600","12963280"," How do we think about Rob, yield plays,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12963280","12966880"," whether it's reach, utilities, yields continuing to come down,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12966880","12970520"," broke below 4% on the 10 year, did that game change?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12970560","12971600"," Yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12971600","12972880"," 100%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12972880","12975440"," I think a lot of the risk has been taken off the table"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12975440","12977080"," and a lot of those names."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12977080","12979880"," They've lagged so much that price performance"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12979880","12982160"," has been devastating for some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12982160","12984480"," and you're seeing a major catch up there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12984480","12986000"," I mean, utilities are down today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","12986000","12988320"," Jimmy, how would you think about that question?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12988320","12992360"," About, you know, we spent, what do we spend a week straight,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12992360","12993880"," mentioning utilities every day,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12993880","12997120"," because they were down for nine or the offensive componentry,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","12997120","13000000"," not the defensive component, so more like the reach."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13000040","13002440"," I think the important part is the defensive element of these."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13002440","13003960"," I mean, these stocks, a lot of the utilities"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13003960","13006440"," just got hammered in the middle of this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13006440","13008240"," So now they're not as expensive as they were"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13008240","13010040"," at the end of last year, maybe they're attractive,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13010040","13011360"," not just on the yield basis,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13011360","13013960"," but having them come down and having attractive valuation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13013960","13016360"," It's dollar, you know, obviously dropping yesterday,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13016360","13018840"," energy, the leading sector today near 3%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13018840","13021040"," What do we think about energy stocks here?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13021040","13023840"," I mean, if you're somebody that believes in mean reversion"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13023840","13026240"," and you want to go into the new year with an underperformer,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13026240","13027560"," that's probably the best place."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13027560","13028560"," Oh, I forgot we're doing finals."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13028560","13029720"," Just give me a name."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13030080","13030920"," What do you got?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13030920","13032080"," America."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13032080","13033400"," Paramount."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13033400","13034240"," Oh."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13034240","13035240"," Yeah, yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13035240","13036240"," Good old Paramount."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13036240","13037160"," Yep, making my bed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13037160","13038240"," Let's see if I sleep."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13038240","13039840"," All right, let's see a closing bell."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13039840","13041760"," The exchange begins right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13046040","13048600"," Thank you very much, Scott, and welcome to The Exchange."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13048600","13049400"," I'm Kelly Evans."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13049400","13050840"," Here's what's ahead this hour."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13050840","13051880"," The Dow is at a record."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13051880","13054840"," The S&P and NASDAQ are touching 52-week highs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13054840","13057360"," Yields are down to levels we haven't seen since the summer,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13057400","13060720"," but did the Fed actually give Wall Street the all clear?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13060720","13062680"," Our economists isn't convinced."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13062680","13064880"," Plus, the most heavily shorted S&P stocks"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13064880","13067880"," are the same ones of double digits so far this month."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13067880","13070240"," That's a warning sign to one equity strategist."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13070240","13071960"," They'll tell us what it means for the staying power"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13071960","13072920"," of this rally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13072920","13075200"," And mortgage rates have a six handle for the first time"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13075200","13077440"," since May, while rents in one key market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13077440","13079680"," are falling for the first time in two years,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13079680","13081720"," whether we're on the brink of a major turning point"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13081720","13082800"," in real estate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13082800","13084880"," Before that though, let's get the very latest on today's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13084880","13087840"," market action, a really extraordinary two days here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13087840","13091080"," Bob Bassani on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Bob?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13091080","13093160"," Yes, and the rally continues."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13093160","13095480"," And the breadth of the rally is what's kind of, well,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13095480","13097040"," breathtaking in a sense."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13097040","13099120"," Let me just show you the major averages."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13099120","13100520"," The S&P is having a nice day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13100520","13101920"," It's up about a half a percent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13101920","13105600"," But the equal weight, S&P 500, is doing even better."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13105600","13107600"," And this has been what's going on all week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13107600","13109320"," There's that RSP there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13109320","13111720"," That's a good way of indicating how broad the rally is."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13111720","13113840"," A lot of stocks are participating because everything"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13113840","13116160"," is equal weight in the S&P 500."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13116160","13117840"," We do have a new high on the Dow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13117840","13119600"," Industrial is historic high, NASDAQ,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13119600","13123400"," Dow fractionally, but also essentially a new high yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13123400","13127600"," 350 or so new highs at the NYC, more than 300 at the NASDAQ,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13127600","13131000"," just all over the place, JP Morgan, Boeing, Apple,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13131000","13135360"," historic high yesterday, Home Depot, Goldman Sachs,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13135360","13139600"," also doing really well recently, Intel, all doing really well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13139600","13141640"," I just want to show you another example"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13141640","13144680"," of how the market breadth is wide here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13144680","13147240"," High beta stocks have been very hot this week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13147240","13150800"," So there's the SPHP that's a high beta index."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13150800","13153600"," These are stocks that move more than the market moves."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13153600","13155320"," So when the market starts moving quickly,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13155320","13157640"," momentum traders go into these stocks"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13157640","13159560"," because if the S&P is up 1%,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13159560","13162120"," they typically would be up, say, 2% on a day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13162120","13164480"," And in an up market, that's a lot of money all of a sudden."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13164480","13167800"," Let me show you examples of some typical high beta names."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13167800","13169480"," Carnival, look at these moves up here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13169480","13171000"," And they were up big yesterday too."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13171040","13173840"," Generac, Blackstone, Broadcom."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13173840","13175520"," These stocks all tend to move."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13175520","13176400"," They have high betas."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13176400","13177800"," They tend to move more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13177800","13180280"," When the S&P is up, they're up even more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13180280","13181760"," And so you see the market,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13181760","13184560"," momentum people coming in in a very, very big way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13184560","13186280"," Finally, I just want to mention the regional banks,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13186280","13188160"," just on fire this week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13188160","13190280"," Almost every one of the big regional banks"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13190280","13192440"," are up in the mid teens right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13192440","13194320"," And this is just today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13194320","13195720"," Yesterday, they were up the same thing here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13195720","13198600"," Regions, sinovis, citizens, it doesn't matter."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13198600","13200760"," Kelly, it's just been a remarkable week."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13200760","13203120"," And Bob, I was struck that when you checked in with Art"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13203120","13205840"," Cash, and he was still pretty bullish."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13205840","13206340"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13211360","13212160"," Look at his mic back."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13212160","13213400"," We'll play you the Art Cash and clip."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13213400","13214880"," It's very, very interesting."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13214880","13218320"," But my next guest is also one of the most, if not the most"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13218320","13220960"," bullish market strategists coming into this year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13220960","13224040"," The S&P 500 is still going to finish about 200 points"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13224040","13225640"," above his initial target."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13225640","13227960"," And he thinks the rally will continue into next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13227960","13230400"," His base case is 5100 by year end."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13230400","13233640"," Bullish case takes us to 5500 next year for the S&P."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13233640","13235560"," Joining me here on set now is Binky Chata,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13235560","13237560"," Chief Global Strategist at Deutsche Bank."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13237560","13239160"," Welcome to you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13239160","13242400"," Let's rewind the clock for a minute, shall we?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13242400","13245320"," Now, do you often find yourself towards the top of the pack"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13245320","13248480"," or was a year ago kind of an aberration?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13248480","13252240"," So I would say a year ago, we were at the top of the pack"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13252240","13253160"," by the middle of the year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13253160","13254160"," We were in the middle of the pack."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13254160","13255000"," You're in the middle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13255000","13256560"," They looked it over you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13256560","13258640"," Right, right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13258640","13262880"," I would say, you know, so far, I mean, years now over,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13262880","13264240"," there's still a couple of weeks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13264240","13267560"," Tends to get a little slower as you go in."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13267560","13271000"," And what we've seen, of course, is a very, very steep rally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13271000","13274200"," So the counterpart of that is positioning has been rising."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13274200","13278840"," I would say almost vertically, which is not, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13278840","13280400"," the healthiest sign."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13280400","13283760"," And so, yeah, we'd be just a little bit careful here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13283760","13285720"," but I don't think it's a big deal."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13285720","13289760"," I think, you know, we had, I would call it a game changer"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13289760","13295200"," yesterday because I think you have to keep the macro backdrop"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13295200","13299280"," in mind for about five, six quarters now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13299280","13302280"," The macroeconomic consensus has been off the strong,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13302280","13306200"," I would say, almost unanimous view that growth was going"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13306200","13307880"," to fall off a cliff."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13307880","13310080"," That obviously hasn't happened."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13310080","13313080"," And so that's the reason for why we got the rally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13313080","13315680"," For the cloud of, you know, are we still going to go"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13315680","13319880"," into a recession, I would say remains as thick"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13319880","13321760"," and loud as ever."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13321760","13325520"," And so I think what yesterday does is it definitely reduces"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13325520","13327520"," the probabilities that we, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13327520","13330720"," that downside scenario materializes."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13330720","13336040"," And so we should, you know, basically look for, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13336040","13340160"," first, it may be some upgrades to the macro consensus,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13340160","13343480"," maybe some taking off of the downside."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13343480","13347120"," And I would not really underestimate the power"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13347120","13349480"," of that consensus, how strong it's been"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13349480","13351080"," for how long it's been."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13351080","13354680"," I would argue it's permeated through everything."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13354680","13358280"," Investor perceptions, I would say growth's been pretty good,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13358280","13361880"," but perceptions have been very, very poor."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13361880","13365320"," I would say companies are, you know, concerned about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13365320","13370120"," getting in front of this huge unanimous strong view."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13370120","13371840"," And so guidance is poor."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13371840","13375160"," I think so this, you know, does, you know, lift some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13375160","13376320"," of those clouds."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13376320","13378360"," I think it would be a gradual process."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13378360","13379200"," And so..."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13379200","13380720"," It was interesting to note your tone of caution a little bit"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13380720","13384120"," about maybe the snapback has gotten a little extended."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13384120","13386400"," I did check the CNN, the fear and greed index,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13386400","13389040"," one of my favorites and we're at 71,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13389040","13391320"," so we're almost in extreme greed territory."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13391320","13395680"," But rarely, I mean, this is now widespread euphoria."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13395680","13397640"," You know, you could wait for some course correction,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13397640","13399640"," but I do think it's important to just pause and say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13399640","13403240"," this year so far has played out contrary to how almost"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13403240","13405400"," anyone had predicted, are you bottoms up or top down?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13405400","13408280"," How did you get to that 4,500 number a year ago?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13408280","13410000"," We are top down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13410000","13414840"," And what I would say is the very early part of the rally"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13414840","13419120"," was really, you know, a call for a positioning squeeze."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13419120","13423120"," And the positioning squeeze was really not about investors"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13423120","13425920"," who were focused on the fundamentals of the market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13425920","13429560"," It was really a call for a positioning squeeze"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13429800","13434000"," on systematic strategies because wall wall was very,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13434000","13435480"," very elevated last year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13435480","13437400"," That was courtesy of, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13437400","13440160"," same people that gave us the wall yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13440160","13442440"," It's really the, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13442440","13444920"," very volatile fed hiking cycle that we had."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13444920","13446640"," And so, you know, very simple take would be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13446640","13449280"," if you looked at systematic strategies, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13449280","13453360"," on a Z score plus minus one, they were at minus two"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13453360","13456040"," and it was all really coming from elevated wall."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13456040","13460120"," So, the call was really that rates of all would come down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13460120","13463880"," because, unless they, yeah, so, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13463880","13467760"," to maintain the wall, you need to sort of keep providing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13467760","13470280"," more and more shocks to the system."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13470280","13472920"," So, you know, we're gonna do 25, maybe we're gonna do 50,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13472920","13475400"," 75, at some point you run a runway"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13475400","13477960"," and at some point you've already raised rates quite a lot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13477960","13479280"," And that's exactly what happened."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13479280","13481840"," But I would say after that comes really,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13481840","13485480"," so the first part was the squeeze as we had, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13486040","13488760"," taking stock of the year that just went by."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13488760","13492760"," I would say then it's really about the fundamentals"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13492760","13494720"," taking over and I would say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13494720","13497360"," yes, we have this recession narrative on the macro."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13497360","13500240"," Yes, it has not played out yet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13500240","13503680"," But if you look basically at earnings,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13503680","13506080"," earnings peaked in the second quarter of last year,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13506080","13507800"," fell in the third and the fourth,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13507800","13509840"," but that was very, very clear bottom."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13509840","13513560"," And earnings are up basically pretty strongly this year,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13513600","13516160"," I would say in the first nine months,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13516160","13519480"," you know, we've got 11 and a half percent earnings growth."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13519480","13521440"," That's pretty good in nine months."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13521440","13523880"," Let me ask you a business cycle question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13523880","13526200"," And, you know, I'm very sympathetic to the arguments"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13526200","13528360"," for the slowdown, so I know them very well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13528360","13530640"," And you do look at the leading indicators"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13530640","13533680"," and things like that and we're on historic levels."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13533680","13535280"," I mean, the index of leading indicators is down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13535280","13536640"," for how many months in a row."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13536640","13538760"," Continuing jobless claims are up year on year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13538760","13540080"," The unemployment rate, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13540080","13542560"," we almost hit that half a percent mark."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13542560","13545600"," There's signs that can't get much better than this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13545600","13547320"," In other words, the business cycle is peaking."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13547320","13548840"," And I'm just curious, how long,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13548840","13550120"," I know this might not exactly"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13550120","13551320"," be the way you evaluate the market,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13551320","13554800"," but how long can we stay in a place like this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13554800","13556960"," as we start to talk about how much further"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13556960","13558320"," the rally can extend next year?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13558320","13561800"," So, you know, I mean, if you would allow me,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13561800","13565240"," I would just change the question around a little bit"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13565240","13568520"," and ask, you know, a rhetorical question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13568520","13573120"," I mean, are we in 1905 or are we in 99?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13573120","13576600"," I would say there's many more parallels with 94.95,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13576600","13579920"," so it is very possible for the cycle"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13579920","13582200"," to go a very long ways from here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13582200","13583680"," The interesting thing about that cycle"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13583680","13585320"," and the soft landing that we got back then"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13585320","13587760"," is we never saw a real tightening of,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13587760","13589520"," for instance, in the senior loan officer survey,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13589520","13591720"," those kinds of things, that never happened"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13591720","13593080"," and that's happening now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13593080","13594880"," So, it feels like those kinds of things"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13594880","13596920"," point you towards a different outcome."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13596920","13598720"," I'd say it is and it isn't,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13598720","13601640"," because if you look at the senior loan officer survey"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13601640","13604120"," for the last quarter, it actually eased."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13604120","13605600"," Got a little bit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13605600","13610600"," And if you look back, basically, at the sluice,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13611280","13614040"," you know, generally tends to peak in a recession,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13614040","13616880"," has very, very few false turns."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13616880","13618520"," So, the question is whether you want to believe"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13618520","13620280"," the turn down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13620280","13623040"," And I would, in the 2001 recession, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13623040","13625360"," we went down, then we tightened again a little bit,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13625360","13628240"," but it did mark the turning point in the end."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13628240","13630360"," So, I'm saying it may not be straight down,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13630360","13631760"," but it has improved."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13631760","13634720"," Number one, number two, what I would say is that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13634720","13638040"," I actually don't pay, I mean, I pay attention to the sluice"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13638040","13640120"," because everybody else pays attention to the sluice,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13640120","13642040"," but, you know, do simple exercise"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13642040","13644240"," and then just overlay the sluice of the ISM."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13644240","13647200"," It's not hard to do and you'll see that, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13647200","13649200"," well, the sluice wide got a little better"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13649200","13651600"," is because the ISM spicked up a little bit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13651600","13654560"," They're pretty strongly, positively correlated"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13654560","13658120"," and so, you know, if growth does pick up from here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13658120","13660040"," and this goes back to my very first point,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13660040","13663880"," if, you know, the Fed is not going to be hiking aggressively,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13663880","13668280"," it does reduce it and maybe even easing, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13668280","13671320"," I'm a little cautious there because we are talking"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13671320","13672920"," about six months from now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13672920","13676720"," And then we just had two rather large changes,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13676720","13678680"," one in two weeks and one in three months."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13678680","13682160"," So, it'd be a little hesitant to discuss six months out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13682160","13684040"," We can talk about it, of course, but..."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13684040","13685040"," One quick final question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13685040","13686600"," I think there's like 10 more things I'd love to ask you,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13686600","13688560"," but I'll stick with this one."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13688560","13691040"," So, this was the year that the Magnificent Seven"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13691040","13693240"," got their name, literally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13693240","13696120"," Do you make a call so specific as to say"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13696120","13698720"," whether that market leadership can continue"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13698720","13702480"," or do you talk about kind of different leadership areas"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13702480","13704120"," and curious what you would make of people"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13704120","13705960"," who are trying to get a little bit more tactical?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13705960","13708560"," Yeah, so I would say two things, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13708560","13711520"," obviously a lot of people pointed at Magnificent Seven"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13711520","13715400"," and say the rally's been, you know, very thin and narrow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13715400","13717120"," I think it's very important to keep in mind"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13717120","13720800"," that basically, you know, whenever you have a change,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13720800","13723320"," it's very important to evaluate where you're coming from"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13723320","13724800"," and was that, you know, sort of, I mean,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13724800","13726280"," if we were in a happy equilibrium"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13726280","13728320"," and always well with the world"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13728320","13731280"," and then only Seven Stocks rally,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13731280","13732320"," then I would worry about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13732320","13734520"," But, I mean, if you look at last year, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13734520","13736480"," that's where the sell-off was."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13736480","13739720"," So, why would one expect everybody else to rally"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13739720","13742360"," when they didn't really fall that much?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13742360","13743920"," So, that's the first point."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13743920","13747960"," The second point I would make is that we are, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13747960","13751480"," so we caught the big move up in January."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13751480","13755920"," We then, you know, it moved into sort of the fundamental"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13755920","13759240"," turnaround in their earnings, which was taking place."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13759240","13763960"," By June, we went neutral megacap and growth,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13763960","13766880"," megacap growth in tech because while we're very, very"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13766880","13769840"," constructive on their earnings and their fundamentals,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13769840","13772680"," on a relative basis, we think there's just too much"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13772680","13773920"," priced in, basically."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13773920","13775720"," And that's where you still are now?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13775720","13777000"," Exactly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13777000","13780440"," And so, we're really looking for the rally to broaden."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13780440","13783800"," I wouldn't be short them because they do grow their earnings"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13783800","13785520"," a lot faster than everybody else does,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13785520","13787360"," but we are looking for the rally to broaden."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13787360","13789320"," So, I would look elsewhere for now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13789320","13791040"," but in neutral and megacap growth in tech."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13791040","13794640"," Fascinating, 5,100 base case, 5,500 in the bullish case."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13794640","13796760"," And, real quickly, what gets us to the bullish case?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13796760","13799600"," It's just a very, it's the macro consensus"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13799600","13802120"," giving up on the recession, basically,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13802120","13804280"," at a better macro growth outlook."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13804280","13806880"," The bullish case is actually, if we have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13806880","13810000"," 2.5% GDP growth in the US,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13810000","13812840"," we've had more than that for the last five quarters."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13812840","13816160"," So, I would argue it's a very reasonable alternative"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13816160","13817320"," to consider."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13817320","13818800"," Incredible turn of events."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13818800","13821280"," One of the few people who kind of had the right position"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13821280","13823160"," in coming into it, Binky, thanks for joining us today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13823160","13824000"," Pleasure."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13824000","13826640"," Good to check in with you, Binky Chata from Deutsche Bank."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13826680","13828560"," Well, let's go from the glass half full view"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13828560","13831040"," to the more pessimistic take on the economy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13831040","13832800"," We did get strong data this morning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13832800","13835160"," Retail sales unexpectedly rose in November."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13835160","13837720"," New jobless claims were down by 19,000."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13837720","13839680"," But Double Line's Jeff Gunlock did warn"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13839680","13841440"," the good news won't keep up forever."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13841440","13843440"," Here's what he said on CNBC yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13844880","13847200"," We've broken down below the trend line"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13847200","13848400"," on the 10-year treasury yield"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13848400","13850320"," that goes back a couple of years."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13850320","13852200"," And there's a lot of room below it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13852200","13856120"," I would guess that we will see the 10-year treasury yield"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13856120","13858640"," in the low threes sometime next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13858640","13861600"," And that would be consistent in my view only"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13861600","13864320"," with the Fed cutting more like, I don't know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13864320","13867960"," 200 basis points or even more next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13867960","13870640"," So, I think we're looking for a recession next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13870640","13872200"," We've been talking about this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13872200","13874280"," The market seems to be picking up on that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13875280","13877840"," Well, on that note, let's pick up with David Rosenberg."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13877840","13880080"," He's the founder and president at Rosenberg Research"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13880080","13882240"," joining us on the phone line today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13882240","13883080"," David, it's good to see."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13883080","13884280"," I don't know if you caught our discussion"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13884280","13885640"," just now with Binky Chata,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13885640","13887400"," but he makes a pretty compelling case"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13887400","13890080"," for why we're gonna dodge the downturn this time around,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13890080","13891680"," at least for the time being."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13893360","13895720"," Well, Kelly, thanks for having me on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13896600","13899040"," I don't know why anybody would think"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13899040","13904120"," that we've necessarily dodged the downturn."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13904120","13909120"," The last thing I would do is extrapolate 2023 to 2024"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13910480","13912600"," and that is people like him"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13912760","13916560"," that were extrapolating 2007 and 2008"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13916560","13918800"," and got their heads sliced off"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13918800","13922160"," or extrapolating 2000 and 2001,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13922160","13923440"," getting their heads sliced off,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13923440","13928200"," extrapolating 1989 into 1990, getting their heads sliced off."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13928200","13930560"," We've been on a soft landing for at least a year,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13930560","13933720"," but the soft landing is just that transition phase"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13933720","13936000"," of the business cycle that the bridge"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13936000","13939720"," from the expansion phase to the contraction phase,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13939720","13942000"," which will be next to your story."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13942000","13947000"," And I believe that is why all the said talked about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13947280","13949040"," at the two day meeting."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13949040","13951680"," And the only thing we talked about was how far"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13951680","13954440"," and how fast will we be cutting rates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13955800","13957840"," in the next two years?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13957840","13960480"," The stock market is only looking at,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13960480","13962480"," wow, weight's gonna come down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13962480","13966440"," Without thinking about why it is at that rate,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13966440","13968320"," they're gonna be coming down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13968320","13970800"," And what struck me in the fed,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13970800","13973080"," the stock box on the economy,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13973080","13978080"," is that they're calling for 3.8% nominal GDP growth next year,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13978720","13981160"," 3.8 nominal."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13981160","13984240"," I actually think it's gonna be posted at two to 3%,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13984240","13986080"," but that's their forecast."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13986080","13988120"," And so the stock market's priced"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13988120","13990680"," for a double-disciplinary growth next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13990680","13992320"," And that's not gonna happen if the fed's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13992320","13993720"," right on nominal GDP."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13994720","13996240"," So they both can't be right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","13997200","13999120"," So I think that we have to ask yourself,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","13999120","14004120"," why is the fed at least verbally pivoting so dramatically?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14004880","14006240"," They're seeing something right now"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14006240","14009000"," that I think a lot of folks in the marketplace are saying."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14009000","14010400"," Or maybe they're seeing what we're all seeing,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14010400","14011840"," which is receding inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14011840","14014080"," And that's the best thing to react to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14014080","14017040"," because you don't have to worry about the worsening data."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14017040","14019680"," You can just react to that breathing room, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14019680","14021240"," I mean, Dave, what would you say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14021240","14022080"," quick last question here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14022080","14025640"," is the lesson, the takeaway from 2023,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14025640","14027560"," a year in which it looked like we were going to tip"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14027560","14029000"," into recession at any moment."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14029000","14032480"," And we continued to be surprised by the fact"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14032480","14033920"," that it didn't show up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14034960","14035800"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14035800","14038440"," And what I'm trying to say is that 2023,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14038440","14040000"," when you were asking your previous guest,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14040000","14044040"," what does it look like 2023, looks like 2007?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14044040","14045840"," So all it was was the bridge."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14045840","14048960"," I think the people that were coming to fist on the table,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14048960","14052960"," the recession starting this year, were just too early."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14052960","14053920"," But let me just say this,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14053920","14056680"," because then all you have to do is retail sales,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14056680","14058440"," there'll be, we're visiting with that number,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14058440","14060640"," as you saw it up in the October."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14060640","14063400"," And it's a very small sample size in the first go-around."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14063400","14064920"," Here's what we know, Kelly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14064920","14067640"," We know that the Fed is listening more right now"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14067640","14070200"," to their business contacts around the country"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14070200","14073960"," than they are to the spurious and authorized"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14073960","14076560"," economic data that's coming out of the BLF"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14076560","14078280"," and other government forces."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14078280","14079640"," And when you go to the base book"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14079640","14082600"," that came out November 29th, what did they say?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14082600","14083440"," Right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14083440","14086280"," They said, two-thirds of the country"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14086280","14089800"," is either stagnating or contracting right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14089800","14092640"," So for all we know, the recession is already starting."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14092640","14094240"," It's not been the data,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14094240","14096560"," but it's in the anecdotal information"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14096560","14099920"," that business contacts, not government statisticians,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14099920","14101320"," they're telling the Fed right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14101320","14102640"," Well, I agree with that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14102640","14104920"," When we do this interview, I say two, three months from now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14104920","14107240"," I get a sense that the conversation's gonna be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14107240","14109040"," a little bit different than we're having today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14109040","14112800"," All right, I'm putting it down for Feb 14, Valentine's Day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14112800","14116080"," We will check back in as a status update day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14116760","14118280"," It's the economy, Cupid."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14119640","14121280"," Thank you very, very much for joining us."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14121280","14122840"," We really appreciate it."

"_zb0kga97sQ","14129400","14133240"," We're down a full point from that multi-year high of 8.03%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14133240","14135520"," The president of the National Association of Realtors"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14135520","14138000"," weighs in on that and will join us in her first interview"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14138000","14140120"," since a federal jury found the NAR liable"

"_zb0kga97sQ","14142680","14143520"," And as we had to break,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14143520","14145080"," here's a look at markets down hanging on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14145080","14147360"," to an 87-point gain after yesterday's surge,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14147360","14150160"," the S&P's up six to 47-13."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14150160","14152480"," The Nasdaq has turned negative."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14152480","14153840"," We didn't get to talk to Bob Bassani"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14153840","14155240"," about it due to technical issues,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14155240","14157080"," but let's see what UBS floor director"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14157080","14159080"," and Wall Street veteran, Art Cashin,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14159080","14161040"," expects from markets next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14163560","14165480"," It's an election year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14165480","14169160"," And that tends to be good for the market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14169160","14173640"," as people making projections and promises and programs."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14174640","14179000"," And even the upward bias on an election year"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14179000","14183680"," when a sitting president is running for re-election,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14183680","14186120"," that compounds it even more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14186120","14190120"," The best of all those historical patterns"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14190120","14192720"," is when an incumbent president"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14192720","14194920"," is deciding to go for re-election"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14194920","14198720"," and he needs a decent economy to back him up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14198720","14203720"," This is the exchange on CNBC."

"_zb0kga97sQ","14295760","14297120"," I'm in the office for the moment here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14297120","14299600"," I just wanted to show you guys this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14299600","14303240"," Coming into that half hour trigger on the 30-minute chart."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14308680","14313560"," Just be aware that I'm always looking at the velocity"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14313560","14315520"," in the 30-minute time frame."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14316520","14320520"," It's going to be easy on this half hour trigger going negative,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14320520","14324520"," and then maybe a breakthrough, this hourly trigger as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14333520","14335520"," Man, I'm losing my voice."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14335520","14336520"," Whoo!"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14337520","14340520"," Hang tight, I got to close it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14340520","14342520"," Just be aware, it was a couple of things."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14343520","14347520"," We've got some unclenching coming up into Friday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14347520","14348520"," We've got some stuff coming up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14348520","14352520"," So be careful on this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14352520","14354520"," Let's see here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14354520","14356520"," Let's peek down here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14359520","14361520"," Let me just see the CNBC."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14366520","14369520"," Keep your eye on this hourly trigger down here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14369520","14371520"," and then also trend."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14371520","14373520"," Okay, so we're just watching trend over here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14373520","14376520"," this big blue line right here, this big byline."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14393520","14395520"," Right down there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14402520","14404520"," There's that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14404520","14406520"," No one seconder goes."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14408520","14409520"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14411520","14415520"," So, uh, excuse me."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14415520","14416520"," Sorry, I'm losing my voice here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14416520","14419520"," I've been in a meeting all morning and just like talking,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14419520","14421520"," talking, talking, nonstop."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14431520","14436520"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14453520","14456520"," I've got a, I've got puts on for today and tomorrow, but,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14456520","14463520"," tomorrow, but I don't know, man, I don't know if this thing's going to print a little"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14463520","14471240"," second there, right there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14471240","14474600"," This is that trend that yellow, this yellow line that you see here in the 1 minute chart"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14474600","14479080"," is that, that 30 minute trend coming all the way up, but you don't want to see happen"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14479080","14482880"," here is, or if you're a bear, what you want to do is this, you want to be, you know, if"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14482880","14486880"," you're, if you're short here, right, you want this, you want to be tactful here, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14486880","14491560"," Take that trade all the way down to the hourly trigger, exit the trade, even if we break"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14491560","14499080"," through briefly, you want to, you don't want to get caught in a squeeze higher, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14499080","14503600"," Even if we're going to break down below, you want to take the second part of this trade,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14503600","14507760"," it's like, you got one trade right here, right as the point, and then you've got another"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14507760","14514200"," trade below the hourly trigger on a rejection to blast through and go even lower, okay?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14514200","14518640"," So just be aware of, you got like a two part trade here, you've got the first, first side"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14518640","14524640"," down, right, wherever that lands or blast through, and then you've got the second part"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14524640","14530920"," of the trade here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14530920","14534200"," So it'd be where you get, you know, you get your first leg down here, then you get your"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14534200","14538720"," second, then one more leg down here, and down, let me see if I can find the second,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14538720","14544120"," or S1 down here, 6610, right there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14564200","14573280"," And there's your downside target, right there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","14573280","14583400"," I'm just going to show you this on a, the full screen so you can see, here's your first"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14583400","14587560"," one right here, here's your second one right here, so just keep an eye on that right there"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14587560","14604200"," as it's some downside targets, all right, back at it baby, dude where's the chat box,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14604200","14617520"," why isn't the chat box showing, let's back up again, do you guys can't hear me?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14617520","14626480"," Back one too, you guys can't hear me out there, why are put so expensive, I'll tell"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14626480","14639120"," you this, yesterday I was buying puts at, oh boy I was buying puts, I was buying some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14639120","14652160"," like cheap puts here, like somewhere in here I was buying puts for today and for tomorrow,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14652160","14659000"," and then I bought more up in here into the clothes, I lost almost no value, like none,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14659000","14663240"," they were expensive, but I didn't lose any value, at one point on this, when I was buying"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14663240","14673760"," puts here, I lost 25% of the value of my puts that were only dated one to two days out,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14673760","14679680"," that shouldn't be the case, I should have been down like 75% or something, so they're just"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14679680","14685040"," loading up puts as we head it up in here for the rest of the week, now, some of you out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14685040","14690600"," there are going to think that this unclenching into the end of the week could be a pretty"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14690600","14698240"," big downside move, I would limit your expectations on whatever that downside move is, anyone expecting"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14698240","14706480"," like some retrace down to 440 or something like that, highly improbable, highly improbable,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14706480","14712440"," there's gamma in the market that should prevent it, so just be aware of that, we can break"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14712440","14716560"," down here, we can slam down to the hourly trigger right, have a quick bloodbath down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14716560","14722880"," that a V shape recovery, if you are a bear, pay attention to what I just drew right here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14722880","14727680"," right, so even if you have this bloodbath down here, whether this is today or tomorrow, right,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14727680","14736240"," even if this is today, just be aware of something here that you really do need price to break down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14736240","14745040"," below this hourly trigger, and in cash markets, if you're trading options only, if you're trading"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14745040","14750160"," futures, you'd be fine, but in cash markets specifically, you want to see price breakdown,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14750160","14756720"," right, let's say, let's say it's breakdown over here, right, you come back down here, you bloodbath,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14757680","14763920"," if you get the rejection here underneath the hourly trigger, I would be very wary of like"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14763920","14770800"," carrying that bearish thesis into a close if you're a cash market trader, if you're a futures"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14771280","14775760"," trader, you should be fine because you can get out from the trade, but if you're cash market"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14775760","14779760"," trader, be careful because they could slip it right back up and ram it up your ass tomorrow,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14779760","14784400"," is my point, now in cash market, you get underneath here, right, let's say you get down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14784400","14789920"," blast down to the hourly, and then you have this bloodbath, right, swing back up here, if you start"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14789920","14795440"," to see a rejection underneath, heck yeah, you can put a short on or you can buy some puts and have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14795440","14801120"," your stops above, if you want to start taking it downtown, if you want to know where downtown"

"_zb0kga97sQ","14856240","14861760"," that erases the entire move going back to December 11th,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","14871760","14878960"," like you need to get underneath this stuff, right, and then you need to break this previous"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14878960","14886640"," blow here, set up a short for some puts to blast down, okay, like you can take it here if you want,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14886640","14890320"," but if you get trapped and we start swinging high, you're going to get in trouble, so this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14890320","14895440"," initial bloodbath down, you break down here, you wait for that previous high to jump in short for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14895440","14907040"," that next leg down to s2, remember that yellow line is the trend right here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14909600","14913760"," let me look at one more thing for you here, one more second guys"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14923680","14927600"," what am I looking for here"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14938960","14947280"," I'm going to read some stuff to power, power triggered an epic market melt up today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14948560","14953520"," which triggered a massive, sorry for my nose too, which triggered a massive short squeeze,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14953520","14959920"," a short basket up 6.6% and propelled the gamma imbalance to a new record high, on the other hand"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14959920","14965520"," realized the ball continues to be in free fall mode due to said gamma imbalance, which is a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14965600","14971280"," vol suppressor and forces of all control strategies back into the market, we model that this community"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14971280","14978960"," has increased its exposure by 50 billion since mid-November, could add another 10 billion"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14978960","14986000"," until OPEX leads to a gamma unclenching that could potentially increase ball again"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14989120","14994000"," we estimate that all else equal a record gamma amount of 7, 718 million will expire on Friday"
"_zb0kga97sQ","14994640","15000800"," which will pump some volatility back into the markets, yep this will likely bear a lot,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15000800","15008160"," yeah yeah okay so I guess this is maybe some expectation to Friday I guess what I'm reading"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15008160","15013600"," here for some volatility, there's some true volatility to come inside the market, let me find out where the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15014960","15016960"," where the gamma flip is here give me a second"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15016960","15023280"," gamma flip is 4590"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15032400","15038960"," so yeah right in here so your gamma flip is right below here so right where that hourly trigger is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15038960","15049280"," shocker right so your gamma flip is roughly right here"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15051440","15056960"," so this is going to be like a pivotal you know pivotal pivotal place down here if we can get"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15056960","15063040"," underneath this if you're a bear that's really where you want to be otherwise dealers are still kind of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15063360","15071200"," uh weekends as we end of friday but kind of forced into buying these dips here so just be aware of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15071200","15079760"," that down here I think that's the basic gist"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15080320","15084960"," that right there for you"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15090960","15096640"," and remember too so if you're like a if you're a seller here right and you do see you know rejection"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15096640","15101200"," up here check the five minute comeback down here and we blast through this and get all excited and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15101200","15105280"," be like yeah we're doing a gloom you need to get the rejection to get what I'm saying you need to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15105360","15110240"," see this or even see a squeeze higher than half hour and then it rejects straight down you need"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15110240","15117760"," to be watching the demand from buyers here and the aggressiveness of sellers underneath this gamma"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15117760","15126640"," flip zone right here now if you get underneath this stuff here right we will trade 4650 and most"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15126640","15136560"," definitely 4600 could be back on board again as true support that is the largest gamma that we have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15136560","15156720"," here you go all right I gotta go right back with you guys"

"_zb0kga97sQ","15445080","15450120"," more extreme, which may be a warning sign for markets. Joining me now is Tavis McCourt,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15450120","15454160"," Raymond James, institutional equity strategist. Tavis, it's good to see you, so just kind"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15454160","15460440"," of run us through the historical record here and how much this episode sticks out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15460440","15463440"," to you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15463440","15470720"," This year is most notable. There's been three significant periods where equity returns have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15470720","15476880"," been highly correlated to high levels of short interest. One of those was late January, which"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15476880","15483440"," was followed by a pullback in equities for the next two months. Another one was May and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15483440","15488240"," June on really the AI-related rally. We hung in there for about a month, and inequities"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15488240","15493520"," kind of start to weaken again. And the third one really has been November and early December."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15493520","15497360"," So there's a lot of reasons for the rally, but on top of that, we've had a lot of short"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15497360","15502720"," covering. And it doesn't mean that we're going to roll over completely, but it does"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15502720","15508120"," mean some of the fuel for the rally has probably neared its end."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15508120","15511640"," Does it make you more bearish right now?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15511640","15517880"," Posh, I would say. I think at some point that the inflation story is effectively over."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15521320","15525480"," But at some point, you're going to need better economic data to keep the rally going at these"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15525480","15531000"," multiples. And we've had two to three turns of multiple expansion just in the last six weeks,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15531000","15537880"," which is really just a substantial amount. You've now got mid-caps that had"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15537880","15544520"," been trading 20% to 30% below historical norms are now only 5% below historical norms."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15545240","15551240"," Small caps that were 35%, 40% below historical norms are now only about 20% below historical norms."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15552760","15559240"," And large caps outside the big seven, which were trading kind of 5% to 10% below historical norms"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15559240","15563560"," are now 5% or 10% above. So at some point, you've got to have some better earnings"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15564440","15571400"," to keep the fire going. So I think we're OK, but if the kind of rally from just a realization"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15571400","15576760"," that the inflation risk is likely behind us, I think that part of this is coming to an end."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15576760","15579800"," I'd like to say we're a long way from sticking this landing because a lot of people think"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15579800","15582840"," we're sticking it right now. I wanted to ask you what you said there in passing about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15582840","15587480"," valuations. Is that also what's been driving this rally that valuations are up a couple of points?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15588200","15595400"," Yeah, for sure. I mean, you can think of every equity index is basically pricing in a percentage"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15595400","15602440"," chance of a soft landing versus a recession. And right now, the percentage chance of soft landing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15602440","15609560"," is just skyrocketing in the eyes of the market. And so that's leading to equity values going up."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15609560","15614680"," But if you look historically, most of the time, after a rate cycle, we don't get a soft landing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15615640","15620920"," Most of the time, after a rate cycle, it takes actually an average of 15 months after the last"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15620920","15626840"," rate hike to start seeing labor market weakness. We're only five months after the last rate hike."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15626840","15634520"," So I look like a soft landing in 06, too. It looked like a soft landing in 1989, too."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15634520","15638280"," You just don't know for sure. It's going to be a full year. So before we know for sure,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15638280","15643880"," this soft landing really is stuck. All right, takes some courage to issue the warning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15644440","15647800"," In a week like this, Tavis, thanks for joining us. We appreciate it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15647800","15652360"," We'll find out, as you say, in a couple more weeks, if this short squeeze runs out of steam."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15652360","15658040"," Coming up, rent inflation in November jumped about 7% from last year. But one very expensive"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15658040","15663640"," area of the market is seeing costs come down. Why Manhattan rentals could be at a turning point"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15663640","15667640"," next on the exchange."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15823880","15852840"," Welcome back to the exchange."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15852840","15857880"," It's not just mortgage rates falling. Manhattan rents are dropping for the first time in two years."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15857880","15861800"," Robert Frank is here with a look at why we could be at a turning point in that key market, Robert."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15863480","15868520"," Well, Kelly, median rents in Manhattan declining by 2% in November. That may not sound like much,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15868520","15875160"," but it is the first time in 27 months that rents actually fell in the nation's largest rental market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15875160","15881160"," Median rents now at $4,000 a month. Average rents are still above $5,000 a month and apartments are"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15881160","15886600"," still 11% more expensive than they were pre-pandemic. But rising supply,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15886600","15892040"," falling employment in New York's financial and tech industries, and basic affordability issues"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15892040","15898200"," are finally bringing prices down. Brokers say landlords don't want to officially cut list prices,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15898200","15904520"," so many are quietly offering a lot of concessions like a month of free rent or even free parking."
"_zb0kga97sQ","15904520","15909000"," Better deals are leading to more rentals. The total number of leases signed in November"
"_zb0kga97sQ","15909000","15914680"," increased by 10% rising supply. Suggest prices could fall further in 2024."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16089000","16109720"," Oh, baby, I'm making some money!"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16119000","16139160"," Hey, just keep your eyes, just heads up here. Keep your eyes on that gamut out here, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16139160","16144120"," We're coming into this bar here of gamut, so there should be a bounce as we come in here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16144120","16147320"," Just be very careful here. Watch, we're probing it right now. Do you see it?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16148120","16152680"," That's that 4,700 gamma bar right here. That's that base cap we're talking about."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16153720","16157720"," So you could see a bounce here, and then if you want to break through it, like you squeeze through"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16157720","16169320"," blast into 4,700, tip your wick, and then we come back down for some more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16171480","16173320"," Oh, I'm sorry about that. I gotta go have a train here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16173320","16180200"," Hang in dog right now, baby. S&P 500."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16192440","16197800"," How do you like them fucking apples, boys and girls sitting right here with you exactly what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16197800","16202600"," it's happening, baby?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16227800","16244520"," Watch it!"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16257800","16259080"," Close them out."

"_zb0kga97sQ","16276080","16276800"," And look above."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16276800","16280680"," There's a little bit of rejection right above here on book map."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16280680","16283800"," I do not want to be trained with this thing every fucking day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16283800","16286800"," Look at that right up here."

"_zb0kga97sQ","16709740","16713180"," And I guess we have to wonder is the optimism going to continue into the new year and what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16713180","16717380"," it could mean for the Fed going forward Jason private chief investment officer private"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16717380","16722020"," clients and Glenn mead and bill Lee's chief economist at the milk Institute."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16722020","16725340"," Let me start off with bill bill thanks for joining us this morning."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16725340","16730540"," What do you think about the Fed was it the pivot that we all think it was and was it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16730540","16732620"," too soon and too much."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16732620","16736540"," Well, Steve as you know, this is quite a pivot and surprise a lot of us who were thinking"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16736540","16739620"," that the Fed was going to be focusing still on inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16739620","16743540"," And I think the message from chair Powell is that he's pretty convinced that inflation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16743540","16745180"," is on a downward path."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16745180","16749420"," It's not quite there yet, but there's enough there that they can now shift from an inflation"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16749420","16754660"," bias to a more balanced dual objective of bias and worry about the real economy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16754660","16758620"," And I think one reason for that is because the Fed is always laser focused on what's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16758620","16761900"," happening to real interest rate and religious rates have really gotten quite high."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16761900","16765940"," If you look at the five year maturity, which is where most loans and business borrowing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16765940","16768580"," is occurring, it's well over two percent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16768580","16773340"," And as you know, in normal times, that real interest rate for that maturity is somewhere"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16773340","16776340"," between three quarters and maybe one percent and one and a half percent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16776340","16780500"," So I think well, well above that, an effect I think is very concerned that they may be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16780500","16784860"," maintaining too long downward spin on the economy and then chair Powell said as much."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16784860","16789540"," He said, we're now putting rate cuts on the table and by announcing it, look what's happened"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16789540","16790540"," to the tenure rate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16790540","16791540"," It's dropped dramatically."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16791540","16793300"," And that's exactly what he's hoping to do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16793300","16797700"," Let the market do the work of lowering that real rate back to more normalized levels and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16797700","16800300"," then he can wait for when he can actually move the policy rate."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16800300","16805060"," Jason, what's the probability or the concern that you may have that the market's gone too"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16805060","16806540"," far with this?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16806540","16812900"," Powell did not promise a rose garden or a rate cut in March, but the market seems to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16812900","16813900"," be acting that way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16813900","16821100"," If you look at the probabilities, it's up darn near 80 percent or 90 percent for a rate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16821100","16823460"," cut in March, but he didn't say March."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16823460","16824460"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16824620","16828420"," Look, I have to admit, I feel a little bit like the Grinch sitting outside of Whoville"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16828420","16829420"," right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16829420","16833900"," I tend to agree with what Bill said and that the Fed knows they've taken rates really"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16833900","16838420"," high to a point where it's damaging to the economy and they need to pull it back in."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16838420","16844580"," But there's just such a distance to come in at this point in time and I suspect they're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16844580","16849140"," going to be looking over their shoulders all along the way saying, wait a second, if we"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16849140","16853100"," take it too far here in terms of cuts, do we make another Arthur Burns-like moment?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16853340","16856900"," So that's going to be sitting in the back of their head and our suspicion is that it's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16856900","16861420"," just a lot of pressure on the economy from higher rates and from tighter monetary policy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16861420","16866260"," conditions that still have yet to find the way all the way in and they just can't unwind"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16866260","16870220"," it fast enough truthfully in order to get to where they want to get."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16870220","16873620"," This is, they're trying to throw in a needle here and this is difficult and the markets"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16873620","16875820"," are basically saying, you know, it's done."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16875820","16876820"," We're good."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16876820","16877820"," We're going to move on from here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16877820","16878820"," That doesn't seem about right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16878820","16881260"," And Jason, there's something in what you're saying that I've been pondering."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16881500","16885820"," I feel like this is a very Steve Leisman kind of thing to ponder, but we've seen rates"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16885820","16886820"," fall substantially."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16886820","16890740"," Yes, that's supporting equities, all of this kind of Hopium into next year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16890740","16895020"," But to have a 10-year still call it 4%, you call it 3.5 if you want."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16895020","16898660"," Is that still a cost of capital that you think companies will be comfortable with or choke"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16898660","16899660"," on?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16899660","16904420"," They're going to feel a lot more comfortable about 4 than they are about 5."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16904420","16909020"," But by our estimation, you know, look, we started basically near zero at one point in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16909020","16911540"," time, we're at a half percent on the 10-year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16911540","16915580"," We're now adjusting to an environment of 3.5% plus."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16915580","16919380"," We think kind of fair value on short term is somewhere in the 3, 3.5 range."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16919380","16922860"," Fair value on longer term like 10 years is somewhere around four."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16922860","16927180"," This is a big difference and economies haven't really, the economy hasn't really made a way"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16927180","16928940"," to filter it through."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16928940","16933100"," We're still sitting on a lot of debt at lower rates that's going to be rolling off over"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16933100","16935700"," the next couple of years and need to be refinanced."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16935700","16940740"," I worry a little bit, Kelly, that the market's acting like money's free again."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16940740","16944400"," It's not free again and it's not going to be free again."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16944400","16949180"," But Bill, I guess there was a lot of pent up demand or that the idea that the Fed could"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16949180","16954500"," hike again, which now looks to be off the table, was something that held back investment"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16954500","16956020"," in the equity market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16956020","16959220"," There were a lot of people, Bill, who were pretty happy for a few minutes there that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16959220","16964700"," were clipping treasury coupons and collecting 4 or 5% in money market funds."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16964700","16966060"," They're not so happy today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16966060","16967220"," What do you think they ought to be doing?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16967220","16969020"," Are they still investing in treasuries?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16969020","16974660"," I mean, I guess as a risk asset, if you were trying to make quick money, it was a good"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16974660","16975660"," thing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16975660","16977460"," But maybe for the long term, it's a different story."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16977460","16981420"," Well, as you see what's happening in the market today, there's a lot of portfolio readjustments,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16981420","16982420"," right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16982420","16985020"," And people are saying, wow, I got to do something with my money rather than sitting back and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","16985020","16986260"," clipping coupons."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16986260","16988820"," And I think that was fed a lot of that market rally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16988820","16991260"," But now you see the market itself is rotating."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16991260","16993300"," It's rotating from one side to another."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16993300","16999300"," All that magnificent surge that we had has now been brought into other cyclical companies."
"_zb0kga97sQ","16999300","17002340"," And I think that is something that really is less concerned with."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17002340","17005500"," As you know, the Fed is really concerned with what's happened through the big picture."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17005500","17011140"," And the big picture right now is that the companies that we were just talking about were worried"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17011140","17014220"," about financing, they get a choke on this high cost of capital."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17014220","17019000"," Well, if the expecting inflation rate is still slightly above 2% and the pricing in the bond"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17019000","17025440"," market shows that it's around 2% and a quarter percent, then at 3.5% to 4% long-term"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17025440","17030560"," interest rates, that's a good number for them to do financing with."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17030560","17034640"," One of the things that the place that we will choke on these high rates would be the government,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17034640","17038040"," because the government has to pay a very high interest tab."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17038040","17041640"," And that is where the burden is going to be and crowding out is going to occur."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17041640","17044520"," Government is going to suck in money that really should be going to the private sector."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17044520","17048960"," Jason, I think most days are not days to do make any changes in your portfolio."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17049800","17053320"," I think very few news things come along that really matter that much."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17053320","17056320"," I think yesterday might have been one of those days."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17056320","17061360"," And I'm just wondering how you're thinking about portfolios differently today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17061360","17065280"," My take was that Powell did what I thought he was going to do in January."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17065280","17067880"," He did it yesterday, so I thought there was time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17067880","17069960"," That time has gone away."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17069960","17075280"," And I'm wondering if you think there are things in adjustments people ought to be making because of those events yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17076280","17079200"," Look, I intend to agree with you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17079200","17083840"," We quite often try to keep our bat on the shoulder in terms of portfolios quite often."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17083840","17090480"," It doesn't make sense to make big shifts, but then sometimes the markets present you with opportunities to do a little bit more."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17090480","17094880"," And this is one of those where it just feels like the market's gone a little bit ahead of itself."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17094880","17098720"," And even if you're looking at your portfolio back in time here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17098720","17103280"," if you're positioned well about, say, three months ago and you look to your portfolio today,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17103360","17108720"," the likelihood is it is not positioned the way you want it to be today because of the magnitude of movement."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17108720","17111280"," So that provides opportunity to bring it back in line."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17111280","17115200"," And that, from our perspective, is getting a little bit more concern in the portfolios"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17115200","17120400"," and recognition that the market seems to be just a hair ahead of itself at the minimum."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17120400","17124720"," Quick question. I don't know just strategy, Jason, involved bonds, but what do you do after this move?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17126160","17130720"," Look, bonds, 5% I think bonds were a fairly good deal at that point in time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17130720","17134720"," We're actually saying that unlike the equity market, there was overvalued bonds were actually"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17134720","17141760"," undervalued at 4%. We think they're actually reasonably fairly valued. We've been pushing out a little bit on the yield curve."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17141760","17146400"," We've kind of paused that a little bit and are sitting with a pretty neutral duration exposure right now"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17146400","17151840"," because we think bonds properly reflect the expectations for interest rates that are sitting out there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17151840","17157440"," Now, when those expectations change, that math will change. But for right now, they're basically in line with fair value."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17157920","17162080"," Bill, real quick, we have to go, when does the Fed cut and by how much next year?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17163120","17168160"," If the market continues to lower long-term rates, the Fed can delay. And I'm guessing they'll delay until"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17168160","17172960"," somewhere around the year when they can actually do a large cut and be done with it before the elections."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17172960","17178480"," And how much next year? I'm guessing they have the lower rates by about a percentage point."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17178480","17181600"," Wow. Thanks, guys. Jason, pride and Billy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17181600","17185200"," That's how you get to trading sessions. We've had the last couple of days."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17185200","17189680"," The 10-year yield below 4%, below 390 earlier for the first time since August."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17189680","17195440"," Rick Santelli in Chicago with more. Tell us, what's the buzz, Rick? What does everyone make of this?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17197040","17205040"," You know, I think the buzz is that the Fed being done is where the party began. And then"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17205760","17212880"," the Fed pushing yesterday the notion that maybe they're not done, but by the end of the press"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17212880","17218160"," conference, it certainly seemed as though all of my sources had a major change of heart,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17218160","17224480"," and we're definitely in that FOMO camp. It's all about FOMO. So if you look at a two-day chart"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17224480","17230640"," of 2s and 10s, you can see that right as the meeting was being announced, the statement was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17230640","17237840"," being announced at two Eastern. What we saw was a drop of significantly larger proportions on the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17237920","17244080"," short maturity to two-year versus the 10-year. So you dropped about 30 basis points on a two."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17244080","17250080"," You dropped about 23 basis points on a 10. Why is that important? Because if the short"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17250080","17254880"," maturities are leading the way, the blast guest said he believes that the 10-year yield to be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17254880","17260240"," closer to four or four and a quarter percent, that would make sense if you interpolate where"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17260240","17264640"," the two-year is going to go with a Fed that's going to ease nearly 100 basis points at the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17264640","17268400"," time of cross coming up right now, the five get it over the half-barre. You want to see"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17268400","17274880"," if you get a reversal at the end of December right now, but these are under that 443 close."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17274880","17282240"," Ten years are just a bit over it. It closed at 388 in the dollar index. It closed at 103.52"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17282240","17290160"," on the 30th of December, which means on the year it's down a smidge less than 2%. But get this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17290240","17297680"," on the wheat thus far it's down over 2%. So what's going on? There's a lot of FOMO and a lot of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17297680","17303680"," things have to work out picture-perfect with regard to the Fed, but doves rule so maybe the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17303680","17308880"," FOMO is on the right course. Rick, I want to follow up on this because you and I talk to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17308880","17313680"," different people. I talk more to the managers and you talk to the traders and we can debate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17313680","17317440"," and duke it out who's smarter. I have a lot of respect, obviously, for the guys you talk to."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17318240","17325360"," Everybody I talk to over the course of this year has been short duration relative to the index."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17326160","17331760"," And that's part of the whole FOMO thing. And I think even today there's short duration relative"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17331760","17335200"," to the index, which if you want to translate that into English, it means they didn't own"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17335200","17340160"," enough 10-year, 20-year, 30-year paper. Is that still the case, Rick? And does it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17348320","17353280"," create potentially more gains to come on the long end of the curve?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17354720","17359840"," You know, I think you're right on it. I think an easier way to look at it is the yield curve"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17359840","17366960"," 2s to 10s. And many, of course, we're looking at selling the 2s and buying the 10s. That trade"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17366960","17374400"," is reversing. And I think a good chunk of the phenomenally quick drop from a one touch of 5%"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17375040","17380240"," to under 4%. Just watch out here. You will see this right here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17380960","17384480"," So you'll always want to be looking behind you, right? This pivot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17385680","17390720"," And if we get this new high right here, it's pretty bullish. So you likely see a squeeze even"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17390720","17395280"," higher at this point. And we'll try to take out this previous high right here. You're likely"
"_zb0kga97sQ","17395280","17400640"," going to see a squeeze right up here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17404400","17423280"," You've got like one more tick here. And then you'll see an explosive move to the upside."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17423280","17443120"," It's kind of it for bears here. This is the place right here and move this over."
"_zb0kga97sQ","17445120","17453040"," Big battle going on here between buyers and sellers."

"_zb0kga97sQ","18077600","18083360"," This right here is the, um, uh, what, what is the goat call this right here?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18084320","18090240"," This is the diddling in the middle in here. Okay. So what you, what can happen here is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18090240","18094240"," you're super bullish. You buy this. You're like, fuck yeah, right? We're going up. You're,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18094240","18099680"," you're all awesome. We're going up right. We squeeze up here. We don't get a new high."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18100880","18105760"," All right. And what happens, what ends up happening is you get bounced back down"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18105760","18112400"," and this becomes a grind zone into the clothes and they just wreck you. Like all this,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18112400","18116240"," kiss all that shit. Goodbye. And they just, they just take all your money and they grind you to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18116240","18121600"," dust in here. This is the, you know, the finger, I call it the finger trap. Uh, you call this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18121600","18125920"," diddle in the middle. Any of this in here. So I never take, well, I mean, I'll take calls in"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18126000","18132080"," here, but it's risky is my point. So, uh, you can be tactful if you want in here. Um,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18133040","18139040"," my preference for the best payout here is to watch for this squeeze."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18141120","18147040"," I want to see a new high. So I want to see a new high from right here. Right. So we'll draw that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18147040","18152640"," in right now. Okay. So what you're looking for here, if you're bullish is just a tick higher."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18153600","18160480"," Right there. You want to see, you want to see like a whale. You want to see, you know, like a whale."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18160480","18169440"," Ooh, right. Comes up here and breaks back down. That high, excuse me, that high tick from back"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18169440","18177840"," here is giving you notice that we're going higher later in time. Okay. Uh, if there's a failure to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18178800","18186480"," get the high tick, it shows you that we're just squeezing that the buyers aren't actually there."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18186480","18193360"," They're weak. So we'll bounce back down and we'll, we'll consolidate this and you really can't take"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18193360","18199360"," calls, like, like an upside call unless you break above that high right there. So you're still"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18199360","18204960"," waiting for that break above to then take the calls that actually print big money. Um, so you"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18205040","18209360"," get trapped in here. They burn all your shit. That's bad news. And then if they, if they roll"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18209360","18215920"," it back down on you, you know, you're, you're all fucked up again is my point. So, uh, statistically"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18215920","18222080"," speaking, if you're a bull, you want to see that break above, come back in for that, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18222080","18226240"," back check on the one minute trigger and the five minute coming down here and you're looking to go"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18226240","18230880"," along somewhere in there, uh, for an up for a bigger upside move. And this, this usually prints"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18230880","18236560"," big money. Some people will jump in above here too. Once the run starts and this one's even"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18236560","18244160"," like this one's like a 98% of the time prints for you. So just, just keep watching the structure"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18244160","18248720"," here. Don't get trapped in here. Don't get trapped right here as a bull. If we, if they roll this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18248720","18254240"," down, don't get trapped in the finger trap over here. Just be watching be patient. You've got time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18261520","18263520"," So you're either looking for this one to breach."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18266160","18271680"," Hi, cat. Or you're looking for it to fail. Okay. One or the other."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18273120","18276800"," Which one will tell you which direction we're going to take?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18291680","18295920"," All right. So I'm going to read some of this stuff to you. Uh, the Dow Jones, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18297440","18300800"," now blew through the upper Bollinger band. And now it's our size at the highest level"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18300800","18309440"," scene since right before Volmageddon in 2018. So just be aware of that. Okay. Uh, so the Dow"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18311440","18317200"," blew through its upper Bollinger band. And now it's RSI is at the exact level right before"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18318160","18320320"," Volmageddon in 2018."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18340960","18345360"," While Bloomberg and GS were wondering if they were a remaining bear. If they, if there were any"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18345360","18348960"," remaining bears or capitulating buyers left to be found out there somewhere,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18348960","18354800"," uh, markets hunted them down swiftly. Uh, modern markets have BPS bear positioning"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18368560","18373360"," to purchase them to close in a massive squeeze causing hedge fund carnage."

"_zb0kga97sQ","18389200","18390080"," What else I got here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18397680","18404240"," And the letter goes on to explain if we're going to go to the upside pricing that in"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18614800","18624800"," you know, there are some famous, uh, well known, uh, shorts operations out there. You guys might"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18624800","18630960"," know some of these, uh, shorter operations that are on like been to it, right? And they'll say that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18630960","18636800"," they, um, not yet what's happened right now. We've had this been leaks in the past. So what ends"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18636800","18642080"," up happening is they sound really smart. The name of the company sounds smart. Uh, they, they claim"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18642080","18650240"," they do an investigation and you know, they, they do a hit piece on, uh, company XYZ. It makes the"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18657760","18662960"," of course, the stock suffers, uh, a hemorrhage, right? They go, they blast down with big red bars"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18662960","18668240"," down to fucking depth, depths of hell. And on the surface, everything looks great. Like, hey,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18668240","18672480"," they did all this research. Hey, they, they're very intelligent, smart, all this stuff. And then,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18672480","18677440"," of course, every once in a while, emails or texts will leak and float around. And you find out that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18677520","18684080"," these guys are just slamming the zero date puts button, you know, that, that's their strategy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18684080","18689200"," right before they leak this, this information or data or whatever. You'd be surprised. Um, my"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18689200","18694080"," main point here is that, uh, for a lot of the people out there that you and I look up to and say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18694080","18698400"," well, they sound really smart. If you ever see in the background what they're actually doing,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18698400","18703600"," it's, it's literally like slam the fucking put button, like zero date putter, zero date collar,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18703600","18710480"," whatever. Uh, if they have that insider information, it's kind of gross and disgusting. You know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18710480","18714400"," meanwhile, you think you're not as smart as them. They just happen to have more information than"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18714400","18724640"," you do. Does that make sense? So it's kind of, it's kind of pathetic, right? And you know, you,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18724640","18729440"," people say the hedge funds don't blow up. They blow up all the time, uh, all the time. And if"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18733600","18737920"," had to solve this respect for how they blow up is usually an insane insider story."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18746880","18751920"," Not looking good here for the bull or for the bears, but also if you were our bull,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18798240","18805840"," of weakness tomorrow. Now that could result in upside movements. Uh, but there's a window."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18805840","18812720"," There's a small window tomorrow for some weakness. Now, so this could be a chance to grab some"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18812720","18820080"," liquidity for that downside move into tomorrow. If that does happen, you're looking to target, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18820080","18829920"," 460 as a firm floor, uh, for, yeah, 460 on Friday. If that does happen, you can see some like,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18834320","18839840"," into tomorrow. They run VIX up all across the board, uh, to provide some breathing room."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18842880","18852320"," Yeah. You know, I don't like calling it the window of weakness. I call JBJ because I know"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18852320","18859520"," who uses that terminology. And I usually make fun of that terminology. Um, the tough part about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18859520","18865600"," using that term to that window of weakness does not mean it will happen, right? It's just that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18865600","18870400"," there's an ability. Uh, so it's kind of a shitty term, isn't it? Well, it's not a shitty term."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18870400","18877200"," I think two things. I think saying window of weakness, uh, means one thing, right? There's the,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18877200","18881920"," there's a window for this to happen, but I think a lot of people jump on it and say,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18881920","18889040"," hey, we're going to crash because of the window of weakness or they don't, um, they pin or associate"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18889040","18894560"," a window of weakness with confirmed definite downside. Kind of, I don't, you know, it's a good"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18894560","18900720"," word. It's, or it's a good use of words, but it gets, it gets manipulated, right? No, there's a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18900720","18920160"," manipulation going on or a manipulation of that word. Yeah. We, so Dilobar said it already has to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18920160","18924160"," happen exactly in that timeframe. I agree with that one too. Uh, Dilobar does matter of fact,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18924160","18931520"," the, uh, dates for the dates for the past three or four weeks now, uh, have been front run,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18931520","18935200"," right? We're like front running everything by a day. Everybody knows. So it's like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18935200","18940000"," front run this a day in advance, front run that a day before it's where like the roll,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18940000","18945040"," every roll down is like a day before every roll up is like a day before as well. So,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18946240","18951920"," there's some fomoing all across the board here. That's impacting the trading days."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18954320","18956960"," Hey, thanks, uh, donut shopper. Appreciate that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18963600","18964480"," I see you, John H."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18967360","18971440"," It's kind of it though for the bears, man, or we're not it, but for any more downside for today,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","18987840","18994560"," spy right now at this moment. Now there's another issue here too. If funds are buying all of these"
"_zb0kga97sQ","18994560","18998720"," stocks, right? Uh, one other heads up here in that note that I read to you a few minutes ago."
"_zb0kga97sQ","18999360","19005040"," If funds are forced into buying those, uh, you know, that underlying, they will dump them the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19005040","19007520"," first chance they get. So just be aware of that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19012240","19017120"," No, not, you're not bugging me in IWM. I made a post on fin twit three, four weeks ago."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19017840","19026320"," Uh, I laid out the entire IWM plan, IWM plan. Uh, the thesis here is in and around December 15th"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19027520","19033040"," is your next opportunity in that post. Well, three, four weeks ago, I highlighted all of this. Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19033600","19039920"," Um, right around, I shouldn't say right. So base or not right around basically on December 15th,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19040480","19047040"," uh, in terms of trading days, you're supposed to be looking for a low on IWM and you long it's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19047040","19054000"," into March, not January. Um, and that now if you're longing into March, you'd probably,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19054000","19060320"," even some of you probably want to be taking, uh, calls that are dated, let's say for, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19060320","19067040"," April, May, June, July, but closing them in March or put spreads that are dated a week or two out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19067600","19074400"," into April, uh, for IWM. Now there's a caveat to this statement here. Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19075040","19080160"," That needs to be addressed. Uh, you've got, you also have a couple of things that I want you to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19080160","19086480"," be thinking about. I don't care what anybody says out there. Okay. There is a tractor beam"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19086480","19093920"," on the end of month for 45 one five on spy. Okay. That doesn't necessarily impact IWM"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19094800","19100000"," where you buy IWM and just be aware of it. Now I don't care if we're above the magnets at 45 one"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19100000","19106800"," five or for trading below the magnet at 45 one five, but the closer we get to the 31st,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19106800","19112320"," Spous is going to want to go there. Another thing to note here too is because of what happened with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19112320","19121120"," Jerome Powell, um, IWM should outperform the greater markets. Okay. Because of what happened"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19121120","19129200"," yesterday, basically, uh, uh, IWM should outperform. Now you will see out performance by small and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19129200","19136960"," mid cap tech stocks. Um, you might even see, uh, big tech do well, but the key point or driver"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19136960","19147200"," here is S a P 500 and the cues should under perform IWM, uh, coming into March at least like you'll"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19147200","19153440"," still see good performance, but not, not even near what IWM should do. And IWM exposes you to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19154320","19164640"," those small cap, mid cap, small cap, risk on, uh, risk on, uh, spec growth tickers that you're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19164640","19170240"," looking for. Now you can find other indexes to trade this, uh, but IWM seems it's got great"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19170240","19175760"," liquidity. You're not, uh, you've got, or you should have, or I don't, I just got shitty liquidity,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19175840","19181200"," but they'll have better liquidity than some of the smaller, um, indexes that are out there,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19181200","19184320"," and you might only be able to buy those indexes, not even trade options on them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19186160","19191600"," So in around the, uh, 15th, okay, on the, on the IWM trade for March."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19196480","19203360"," Am I saying that the Moass on Jimmy starts soon? That's a tough one. Um, I'm watching GME for that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19204000","19210480"," I'm on the fence on it right now because I know they will trade anything up as long as there"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19210480","19217200"," isn't any fraud. Uh, and there's a bunch of companies in here that are open to an M and A"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19218320","19222800"," into February that could drive that January February. You also have that you get the January"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19222800","19226960"," effect. And then you've got, if you guys don't know what, I'm going to tell you guys a couple of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19226960","19231200"," things. I'm going to interject here and go off and attend it. If you don't know what ball"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19231280","19238320"," McGeddon is, Google search that go down the rabbit hole. If you don't know what the January"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19238320","19244000"," effect is, uh, tax loss harvesting, start Googling all that stuff. I'm not going to go on a diet"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19244000","19248080"," tribe here today on it, but you need to know what that stuff is. You need to understand about"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19248080","19254640"," cutting your losses for tax loss harvesting, uh, a grand rotation that takes place. And then, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19254640","19259360"," and also a bunch of tickers that have the potential to boom up into the end of the year."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19259440","19262080"," You can actually, you've seen that happening the past few weeks. A bunch of tickers have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19262080","19266560"," been talking about all year long that have been moving just like marching up there. They're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19266560","19271600"," blasting them to new highs right now and the end of the year. Um, and then a rotation into"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19271600","19277280"," some of this stuff into the beginning of the year, uh, with the ad or the implication of tax cuts"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19277280","19283840"," or excuse me, of rate cuts coming in 2024. Now, there's a caveat to all of this. Uh, and this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19283840","19291280"," March projection is where are we, uh, in the, in the timing of all of this? Like are we timing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19291280","19300160"," this back into end of July? Right. For timing when we actually get rate cuts or is it from this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19300160","19306640"," point forward? Uh, and when do you expect those rate cuts? No, no one's going to want to tell"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19306640","19310160"," you this. Okay, but I'm going to tell you the truth. I'm just going to piss off a lot of bulls."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19311120","19317520"," Okay. Now price will matter on this, but there should be a front running. No matter where"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19317520","19323760"," price is, I don't care if price is at 5000 or prices at 4500. I don't care where price is,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19324320","19332240"," but I want you to know that regardless of where price is, banks are going to attempt a front"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19332320","19340640"," running of rate cuts. So you should be keeping your eyes on, uh, the rate of inflation."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19342240","19347680"," You should be keeping your eyes on the unemployment rate and be thinking about when the Fed will"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19347680","19354480"," actually cut roughly one to three months before that, you will see banks attempt to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19355440","19363360"," front run that eventual cuts and begin to dump the market. So let's say we're at 5000, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19363360","19371600"," They would dump at 5000. We might blast down to 4800 or 4600, right? If we're at 4500,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19371600","19380240"," we could blast down to say 3800 or even 3600 when that eventuality comes to bear fruit. Okay."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19380240","19384320"," So it is going to matter of prices, but you have to think about that as well."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19385120","19391280"," When you're trading this IWM trade or this possibility of IWM outperforming,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19391280","19395840"," do they cut it? Do they cut it short? Is it January and not March? That's the big question, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19396400","19403520"," You actually get that effect on IWM of eventual rate cuts all the way into March or do we end up"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19403520","19410720"," getting a subdued version of that into March."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19413600","19421760"," Isn't rate cuts bullish? That's a complicated, that's a loaded question."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19424800","19430960"," Historically, no, they are not or no, they are not for where we are. So"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19431840","19438320"," here, let me draw this out pretty really quick. So our rate cuts bullish. Ready?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19439760","19444480"," Pause of rates right here. Market, this is the market pause of rates, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19446640","19450720"," Let's say this is the market right here, right? We're pausing, we're pausing, normal pullbacks,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19450720","19456000"," pausing, pausing, pausing, right? This is, let me bring this, let me, shit, hold on a second here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19456000","19459040"," let me bring this over so you can actually see it. Give us a second here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19461360","19470400"," So this right here is the rates, okay? They're steady. This is the market over here, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19470400","19475440"," And it's just grinding like higher, higher pullback, higher, higher pullback, right? Let's say this is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19475440","19483680"," in the future and you have rates cuts, right? About one to three months before those rate cuts,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19483760","19491040"," you'll see the market usually bloodbath, okay? And it will chase this and you'll be like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19491040","19497520"," why is this happening? Oh, God, why is this happening? And you'll see the eventual rate cut"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19497520","19506400"," somewhere in here, right? And the rate cuts will chase price down. Does that make sense?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19507280","19511920"," And you won't get the bounce up until afterwards. So you're like, we're like right here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19512880","19516560"," This is where we are right now, okay? So you're like, yeah, fuck you, everything's awesome,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19516560","19521840"," everything's awesome. You're looking for this one to three month range for this roll down. Now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19521840","19527840"," this pricing could be 5000, could be 450, 4500. It doesn't matter where it is,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19529440","19533440"," but you want to be aware of this, okay? So when someone says rate cuts are bullish,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19534240","19540960"," fuck, yeah, they're bullish, but they're bullish, but they're bullish, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19540960","19545680"," as the yes, they're bullish, but that's because we're trying to buy a fucking dip down here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19545680","19550640"," Does that make sense? Not back up here. I think there's a there's a people misconstrued what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19550640","19558640"," that statement means. This always happens always every time, every single time. Now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19559360","19569760"," what you think is pain on that trade, what you think is pain on that trade is or matter or"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19569760","19574560"," price will matter what the pain on that trade is, I should say. Does that make sense to you guys or"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19574560","19580880"," no? Let me know if that makes sense or not."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19581040","19589600"," Now, and you have to think about that into next year. That's not really a today thing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19592080","19596560"," That's not really a today issue that like, but you have to think about it. Think about it when"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19596560","19605680"," you're planning out your 2024 low to buy the market. And as a matter of fact, where I was"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19605680","19614960"," talking with a friend yesterday, and he was expressing to me that this is a bear, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19614960","19622960"," But he owns the market as well. And what he did was back in November, so we can show this down here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19622960","19630720"," right? Right back here. So back here. Let's show all this right here. Where's the low? Let me"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19630800","19644400"," put on a 30 minute."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19646880","19653440"," It's a whole bunch of people sold in here, the underlying, not trading, okay? I'm not talking"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19653440","19660320"," about day trading, swing trading, none of that stuff. Talking about underlying assets in market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19661680","19668640"," Whole lot of retailers got out here. Guess who else got out in here? I did. As I as we went into"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19668640","19676320"," earnings, I was selling any, any green, anything, any green I got. So like I said, I went to an"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19676320","19682800"," earnings on like Budweiser and a whole bunch of fucking tickers, right? Tyson foods, you name it,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19682800","19688240"," PayPal fucking you name it, any earnings that were good, anything that I saw green in my account"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19688320","19693280"," personally, I took the money and ran. So I took my money out of the market, okay?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19693840","19699040"," I traded it, traded everything great, made a bunch of money. Had I left this underlying tickers"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19699040","19704720"," in the market, I would have been, I would have exceeded my target on the year for returns."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19705840","19712880"," So I missed a ton of gains for this year. Personally, I did. I missed a ton of gains. Now this,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19712880","19720720"," my friend of mine had the same experience. Now he's a bear, right? So he's been trying to short"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19721680","19731600"," this entire run as well. He's not down heavy, but he's sore, right? He's upset. The reason that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19731600","19736640"," he's upset is because he could have, even if he was shorting, he could have made money with his"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19736720","19743120"," underlying, right? He missed out on all of those underlying gains. And he was on the wrong side"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19743120","19749760"," of the trade going up, right? So he was risk off on the underlying, but he was also risk off on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19751040","19755920"," risk off on his thesis for the market. So he's shorting, shorting, shorting, shorting,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19755920","19761920"," getting run over, getting run over. And then what his regular paying stuff is not making him any"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19761920","19768960"," money. So he's got cash on the sidelines is my point. And I have cash on the sidelines. We both do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19768960","19773200"," So we were discussing this last night, I think, and then we tried to catch up with him late"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19773200","19777200"," night, but I was in a birthday party and also stuff, family and friends and all this kind of stuff. But"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19779280","19786560"," the point is here is that he asked, well, when do I reenter the market or when are you reentering"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19786560","19795200"," the market? And my answer to him was, you know, I feel like right now, so I've got my trader hat"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19795200","19801200"," off and or I've got my trader hat on my investor hat on and I've got my main street hat on. And"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19801200","19807360"," that's a big question, right? So I missed out on a bunch of gains. I mean, big gains, six figures,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19808000","19814000"," six figure gains I probably missed out on in total for just underlying money in the stock market,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19814000","19820800"," right? But when am I, when am I willing to put that money back to work? And that's the question. And"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19822640","19828160"," I don't want to put that money back to work right now. I'll be honest with you out there. I feel like"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19828160","19835360"," with my main street hat that CNBC Bloomberg, I mean, literally New York, I've read it everywhere,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19835360","19841280"," New York Times, Washington Post, you name the publication. And they're out there trying to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19842160","19851920"," tell people, hey, rate cuts are in sight, you can come out from your hidey hole. And it's time to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19851920","19859680"," put some risk into your portfolio. Now, for me, and then the second thing they're telling,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19859680","19864720"," you know that realtors are out there right now, they're probably had a fucking, I'm sorry, I'll"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19864720","19869040"," stop swearing. I'm not going to express it this way, because probably kids out there listening."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19869680","19874560"," But that realtors probably shut up to their offices this morning, and literally had a,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19875520","19883520"," you know, an adult party with each other. And like rephrasing their pitches, recalling everybody"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19883520","19888640"," that that they've been begging to sell their homes for the past three years, right? And you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19888640","19894080"," they're just going to spiel them with rate cuts are coming. We don't care what kind of low we get"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19894080","19898560"," you in, right? We'll get you a loan where when rates come down, they're going to go back to zero"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19898560","19903920"," and you're going to be fine, right? And let's start selling your house. And furthermore, man,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19903920","19909120"," you should do it now because everybody is going to be doing it, right? And you want to be the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19909120","19913680"," first one out before everyone's selling their houses on the same block. I'm sure there's that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19913680","19919760"," that I would be selling, I'd be saying that to potential home sellers and buyers, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19919760","19925600"," Myself, I'd be saying that this morning. So I'm sure, and matter of fact, I own three properties,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19925600","19929120"," and I guarantee this week I get flyers on my front door. I used to get them all the time,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19929120","19935200"," I get flowers, candy, door hangers, you name it from people trying to get me to sell. So I'm"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19935200","19939920"," assuming that's going to restart again at this point. So I've got my main street hat on. I'm being"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19939920","19945360"," told as a as a regular investor, where I just buy the stock market, I own properties, maybe I"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19945360","19952880"," want to buy or sell some properties, I'm going to get bombarded from from like this main or from"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19952960","19958080"," mainstream media telling me everything is fine. Come get out from underneath your rock."
"_zb0kga97sQ","19959440","19967360"," To me, that is to me, from my experience, to me, that's a dangerous thing. It's exit liquidity"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19967360","19973920"," for banks. It's exit liquidity all around the board. So as it relates to the stock market, like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19973920","19978880"," so I buy all this shit, they in the bank sell into me, I'm the bag holder, right? That makes"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19978960","19984880"," me the bag holder, so they can unload on to me. So from at least for my not the real estate side"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19984880","19990880"," of things, but at least for the stock market side of things, our discussion last night was with me"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19990880","19996000"," saying, Hey, I'll enter this market. If we've got a one to three or five year bull run coming,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","19997200","20008800"," right? We got that coming. What I can do is look for a low in 2024. Rate cuts in 2025."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20009360","20015440"," I'll keep an, I'll keep an eyeball out for a bunch of things. I want to see unemployment at 68%."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20016400","20024160"," I want to see the rate of inflation near or even if it's fake bouncing off that 2%. I want to see"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20024160","20030880"," the rates being cut actually being cut. Wherever that low is, I don't care if it's at, I'll be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20030880","20034800"," honest with you. I don't care if it's at 3800. I don't care if it's at 5,500. I don't care if it's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20034880","20042960"," at 5100. I don't care if it's at 5,000. Remember that low is I will then re risk my cash in the stock"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20042960","20048320"," market. I'll trade it. I'll trade it up. I'll trade it down. I'll trade it to 6,000. But until that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20048320","20056160"," happens, I'm unwilling personally to risk my cash in the market. I have real fear there. I don't"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20056160","20061760"," want to wake up. I'll be honest with you. I don't want to wake up this summer, right? And I don't"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20061840","20068080"," want to wake up this summer and you've got everyone trying to sell their homes at the same time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20069040","20075840"," You have buyers out there that are willing to or not willing to pay high prices. You've got sellers"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20075840","20084320"," undercutting each other. If you see the housing market crash, you know, that's bad, right? That's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20084320","20088800"," bad. That's pain, right? If unemployment rates going up, people losing their jobs and you start"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20088800","20093760"," to see the market roll down hard and heavy. I want to buy that bottom. That's the bottom that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20093760","20102960"," I want to buy personally. Yeah, I'm not going. I'm not buying this. I'm not, I'm not putting"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20102960","20107680"," all the buy. I'll trade it, but I'm not going to like come back in and buy Apple here at 200."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20107680","20114240"," I'm not doing it. I'm not for where we are in the in the stock market cycle and the business cycle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20115200","20119280"," Just be careful out there. I know saying this is going to piss off a lot of bulls and we're like"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20130720","20135840"," going to get people. This is pretty crass to say, but I got to say it. Okay, I'm going to get it out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20135840","20140560"," there, at least in public at least once. This is pretty crass. You're going to get bulls that"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20150800","20157280"," could be anybody. You know, like if I have a half a million dollars that I want to put into"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20196720","20202400"," Okay, and I'm going to assure you guys right now that I got people in the stream, man, you can"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20202400","20206400"," look at Binky Joe Donut. There's I'm not there's a few people I talked to yesterday, I'm not going"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20211280","20217440"," high high net worth people in real life. You can come see us. These guys pictures of me, I got"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20217440","20222000"," pictures of them, they put stuff sometimes on the internet. Let's feel over high wealth. And"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20222000","20226720"," we're having these discussions. And most of us are sitting on our hands. I want you to know that,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20226720","20230880"," okay? Like if you want to, if I want to go with a thousand bucks, right, by the market, sure,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20230880","20235120"," I'd do that. But that's not my net, that's not my net worth. It's like what? 000, 000, 000,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20235120","20242400"," five net worth. Just be careful out there who you're talking to, where they're coming from,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20264960","20270480"," million dollars in wealth. And he just bought the market with 10% of that, right? Whereas you're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20270560","20276400"," going to slam down 20 grand in its every, every last dollar that you have, right? Does that make sense?"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20337840","20345440"," private video for members, even the lowest member. So just not public. What you'll get from me is"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20345440","20352480"," you're going to get an outlook for 2024, right? You're going to get some data from me from JP,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20365520","20373200"," saying for managed money. I have money that's managed from them. So what I'll do is every"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20373200","20378800"," year I do a write up and I'm going to point out sectors to be watching for the year to be like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20378960","20386000"," hey, these are the sectors to be buying for 2024. I'm also going to give you an outlook for a macro"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20386000","20394480"," outlook on the S&P 500 for 2024. If this then that if that then this that kind of stuff and for 2024"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20394480","20399040"," and what else do you get that? Basically, that's what you get from me for the year. Now that stuff"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20399040","20404960"," won't come out until we're in January. Sometimes I'll do it in December, but it's sometime in like"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20404960","20409920"," from now into middle of January, I'll get the information that I need. And then I'll do a big"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20409920","20413840"," write up for you. But somewhere between the 15th of this month and the 15th of next month,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20414640","20419440"," where I start getting all the all these fucking letters from JP, I'm telling them what to do for 2024."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20427120","20430960"," Yeah, Mr. Fibs is saying talking about the psychology of money in chapter 11, everything"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20430960","20435840"," is the same for everyone. Why best bulls combat narratives. I I'm going to tell you, if you're a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20435840","20442080"," bull, I'm going to, I need to reemphasize this. If you are a bull, right, it is a very dangerous"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20442080","20450000"," time for what you're consuming. It's very similar to when we're at bottoms and bears are consuming"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20450000","20456320"," the wrong con there. So you got bears on bottoms that are listening to the cacophony of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20457200","20462480"," we're going to bla we're going to take a second leg down here, right? And it's exit liquidity"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20462480","20470640"," for those bears that do not have the blinders on they're not focused on what's in front of them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20471280","20478080"," And as a bull, I assure you into this year, it's fine for the market to go up and find for it to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20478080","20485760"," go to 6000. Stick with your tools be you need to be vigilant in this environment as a bull."

"_zb0kga97sQ","20567040","20593520"," Yeah, you know what I would be recommending? It was me. I'd be watching the chain over the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20593520","20600160"," weekend. I'd be watching IWM over the weekend. There's some large concentrations between 240"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20600160","20607840"," and 200. I would think that something closer to in the money would be better. And you ride that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20607840","20614160"," all the way like you get. I'm actually looking at the March 28th. I'd probably be looking at April"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20614160","20620880"," or May or even June and going a little bit deeper in the money and just ride it the entire way."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20624320","20630320"," Uh, when you're talking about what's launching for members tomorrow, what defines a member?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20630320","20632240"," Okay, I'll write that out for you right now. Um,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20634560","20640800"," So we've got a we've got a free member. We've got a $10 member level. We've got a believe a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20640800","20649760"," $59 member level and a $150 member level launching tomorrow. So you're going to get all of that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20649840","20656880"," one, two, three, four levels. And you're also going to get, um, uh, some kind of a Joe Donut's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20656880","20664240"," doing some kind of a like, um, hype, uh, launch on this where we are going to give big discounts"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20664240","20669200"," out. So whatever prices I just said to you, uh, those prices will actually be lower. There's a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20669200","20674080"," bunch of like, um, stuff for people have been following for a long time that we're going to be"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20674080","20675600"," launching here today or tomorrow."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20679920","20684640"," Yes, you choose what membership you want. If you are, uh, heads up on this. If you are a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20684640","20690160"," free member, right? Right now, which is what everybody should be, right? Free. Uh, your"

"_zb0kga97sQ","20695680","20701440"," stay free, I do want you to know that you're going to going to actually get more, um, from what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20701440","20712160"," your experience that you have right now. Yeah, it's going to be cool as fuck. Um,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20712160","20716080"," it's going to be really cool. I'd be stoked. If I was a free, if I was like you and you're like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20716080","20719520"," this is what I get from captain for free, you're going to get a better experience."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20722880","20729200"," Uh, my linking Twitch sub tears to correlate with, uh, my member access of your site."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20729280","20735200"," Bork, I'm going to, uh, DMG yesterday. I'm going to DM you about that today. Uh, the idea here would"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20735200","20740560"," be this. Let me see. I can say it publicly at least. So there are people that believe it or not,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20740560","20745200"," there are people out there that only want to watch the show. That's all they want to do. Watch the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20745200","20753520"," show. Um, either on Twitch and on YouTube, right? So if that's all you want to do, you have two"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20753520","20761920"," options. You can, uh, sign up for Amazon prime gaming and chat for free on Twitch. Okay. So that's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20761920","20766000"," your free basic free, free, free, free, free, free, like super free. I don't want anything to do with"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20766000","20770240"," you. Right? Fuck you cap. I want to watch the show. That's all I want to do. And I want to be able"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20770240","20774800"," to chat. That's how you get your free option to chat. If you're like, uh, cap, that's all I want"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20774800","20780240"," to do. But I want to watch it on YouTube. Uh, your option is to pay $5 for that access."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20780960","20788000"," The that's all you get. If you are a classic free, if you're, if you've been here free since the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20788000","20797840"," beginning and you chat, right? We have a $10 level that $10 level will be tied to Twitch and YouTube."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20797840","20803040"," So we want to be able, we want you to, uh, not be paying that $5 shit on Twitch and YouTube. We're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20803040","20808480"," having to sign up for Amazon prime gaming. Uh, and we're trying to give you the ability, give the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20808480","20813520"," ability so that if you pay 10 bucks, this is what you get. And this is the, this is our classic"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20813520","20818960"," old school, free membership level. Now you'll be able to chat on YouTube or Twitch. You'll get"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20818960","20825840"," the discord access. Uh, and you'll get your levels on our website and a cool, pretty cool format."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20825840","20829920"," And I actually expanded those levels. I don't know if that, I hope that launches tomorrow,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20829920","20834960"," but you're going to get expanded levels as well. Uh, and then the reason we're charging the extra"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20835040","20842240"," money is because of discord. I have to, I have to do something in the background to kick out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20842960","20848400"," all the scammers, the bots and a bunch of shit. So I got a job I have to do that costs money."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20848400","20851920"," Uh, so for the security and safety of our free membership, because we attract"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20851920","20858800"," financial discords in general attract, uh, scammers. So now that's that free level. Now the next level"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20858800","20863520"," up is the $59 level that I think that goes down. I think, I think there's a deal on that too"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20863600","20870160"," to make it even cheaper, but that level right there, you're going to get, uh, the tool embedded"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20870160","20877280"," on our website, uh, for a list of tickers. It's all the indexes, all of the, um, so you'll get like"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20877280","20885040"," spy and you'll get es, uh, you'll get, uh, cues and you'll get nq, you'll get, I think, uh, included"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20885040","20889440"," in that is don't hold me to this ship. And I think included in that is apple tesla,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20889440","20895360"," Nvidia, AMD, AMC, GME, uh, the most traded stocks in the stock market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20896000","20900560"," The next, uh, and in that, in that level, you're going to get some other shit. I think you get, um,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20901600","20907040"," stock levels for the entire stock market. You get, uh, more access in the discord,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20907600","20911680"," uh, and some other stuff. Then the level above it, the 150 level, you get just the tool. You can"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20911680","20915840"," do it anywhere, wherever you are. You just, we run around, take using the tool, however you want."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20916400","20922400"," And then you get some, um, some unique support in our discord as well. We have like a ticketing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20922400","20927040"," system or something in our discord for the pro level so that we can answer your questions,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20927040","20932160"," whatever you need, those questions answered. Also, there'll be a training program, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20932160","20936480"," included for those levels as well for anyone that gets the tool either on the site or in the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20936480","20943440"," discord. We have been diligently working on a training program, uh, for people at any level."
"_zb0kga97sQ","20943440","20948800"," If you're, if you're an absolute beginner, I started the videos and how to set up your"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20948800","20952800"," trading view like here, this is how you buy the trading view. This is how you don't buy the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20952800","20958000"," trading view. This is how you set your trading view for use of the tool. Um, so, or if you're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20958000","20962560"," just using the tool on the website, no matter where you are in your trading journey, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20962560","20967920"," there should be an answer for you in an educational program. Some other things included in this will"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20967920","20972560"," also be, uh, that I haven't talked about. We're rolling out a bunch of other stuff, but I don't"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20972560","20976880"," think that happens Friday. Uh, you're going to get market briefs. You're going to get, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20976880","20981520"," briefs for myself, briefs from, uh, somewhat another, another trainer here is going to help us out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20981520","20985360"," with some briefs. Not going to name names. You're going to get some a Sunday stock show. We're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20985360","20989200"," actually going to try to launch a nighttime, uh, video as well. Like Bob Kendall was doing that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20989200","20993360"," stuff. We're going to do something like Bob Kendall did. I heard that he wasn't doing it anymore, so"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20994000","20999120"," we'll try to fill that space. Uh, but we've got a bunch of crap coming like stock scanners and"
"_zb0kga97sQ","20999200","21004960"," we've got, um, paper trading and, uh, uh, we've got a options profit calculator. That shit's all"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21004960","21009120"," for other. I think the options profit calculator is free for everybody. We got a bunch of shit"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21009120","21014400"," rolling out in the coming weeks too is my point. Just take, it's just taking some time. Uh, so"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21014400","21020400"," you should see a baseline product and then you'll see additions to that. Whatever level you're on,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21020400","21026880"," you're going to see, um, uh, bonus, uh, tools and bonus content. I got a whole gamut thing coming"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21026880","21035200"," out. Uh, gamma, gax models, um, historical, uh, charts, really cool shit. Um, super cool stuff"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21035200","21040000"," coming your way. So it's going to be cool. It's gonna be fucking cool. No, you know what the cool"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21040000","21045040"," part about this is, uh, I got to say, I want to say this again, our heart back on this again. So"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21045040","21053040"," we're at a place right now where, um, we've accomplished what we set up to do and we're out of maturity"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21053040","21058800"," and that, like, so we've like matured into, hey, did we do what we set out to do? And we did. And"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21058800","21065760"," we're at a place here where the question becomes, do we want to make this sustainable and grow? Uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21065760","21074160"," and if that is the case, we have to offer some type of mona, some type of a monetized, um, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21074160","21079280"," greater benefit to our members and we have a demand for that or people are saying that they"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21079280","21084720"," want that. So if we can provide that to people that want to pay, uh, and if that helps us to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21084720","21089920"," keep doing what we're doing, that's what we'll do. Uh, and if it doesn't work, we'll just close it"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21089920","21098400"," down. It's very simple. Um, so this next step, the, my, the grand vision for myself, um, for this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21098400","21106560"," next step is that it becomes a self, uh, like it takes care of itself. I can keep the people that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21106560","21112080"," we've attracted over the years, uh, invested in what we're doing. Like, I want to keep a David"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21112080","21118400"," AMS around. I want to keep a John L here. I want to keep, um, uh, blind nest owl here. I want to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21118400","21126480"," keep, uh, Joe Donut here in Quinn here and, uh, Binky is breaks his dick day in, day out. Uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21126480","21130160"," I want him to do a Sunday stock show, right? I've got other, we've got other people, great"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21130160","21134720"," trainers out there that want to get involved with what we're doing. Um, we got ball, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21134800","21139360"," ball control of all signals. I want to talk to that guy. When you try to, and this, some other"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21139360","21144800"," stuff here too that I haven't discussed with you, but we're trying to do a network as well for, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21145840","21151600"," uh, traders that want an outlet for an easy street outlet for them to get their stuff out to other"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21151600","21156720"," people. There's like a trade the track, trigger network, but, uh, they were trying to work on right"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21156720","21162080"," now. But the idea of being here or the idea with this is that, uh, if we can take care of those"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21162080","21166000"," people and keep them focused and staying with us and not just disappearing, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21166000","21171280"," this will continue to, uh, become a, uh, more sustained community. You know, one of the things"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21171280","21177120"," that's set that, that I'm scared of, if I have like a fear right now, uh, it's that, you know,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21177120","21181280"," there's, um, you know, like people that want everything free, I'm fine with people that want"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21181280","21185600"," everything free. Uh, I got no like ill will towards somebody that wants something for free,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21185600","21190240"," but I got to say this, um, you know, there's people that want everything for free, no matter"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21190240","21198640"," what. And if where they're getting that free stuff, it, uh, remains, um, unsustainable,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21199760","21206800"," there's a, there's a finite timeframe where you can't do that anymore. And so we shut it down,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21206800","21211680"," right? Well, that person that only wants free, they disappear and they go find the next free thing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21211680","21216240"," Okay. So it's not like a much better like tuck down or bad about someone that wants something for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21216240","21221840"," free. So the only concludes solution that I can find to that, um, and people that want to keep"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21221840","21225680"," continuously, uh, keep going are going to be like, what the fuck, man? Like why just shut it all down."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21226240","21231680"," So the only sustainable solution I find here is that, uh, people that want a more enriched"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21231680","21236880"," experience that are willing to support that, uh, if they pay for that to happen, it only benefits"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21236880","21241440"," the person that's looking for free. So if you're someone that wants this free, um, you know, look"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21241440","21246240"," towards people that want to see this grow and, uh, and they will, and they're going to actually"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21246240","21250400"," provide you with the still with that free experience. Um, so that's what, that's where we're at right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21254000","21258080"," You know, I don't know how to explain it. So, uh, this holds some other mechanics too. This"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21258080","21263920"," mechanics behind is their value and what we do when it's free. This of a human psychology is to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21263920","21268480"," discount its value. There's a bunch of other crap, um, behind this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21272080","21283360"," Yeah. Uh, so I gave beta, I, are we released beta testing for people and I had to move."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21284320","21290400"," I had to do some shit to the tool and move it. And so I had it, I ended up deleting everybody's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21290400","21296000"," access unknowingly, even my own and Joe Donuts. So I came back on Monday morning. I'm like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21296000","21300080"," do do weekends done. We're going to shut this down, flip it all over there and then launch"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21300080","21303600"," and I come back on Monday morning. I'm like, fuck, I even, I don't have access to the tool."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21303600","21310320"," I felt naked. I got emails from people that were beta testers and they were fucking pissed."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21311600","21316960"," And I mean, that's bad. But on the other side of things, it does mean that people are"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21318240","21323200"," using this stuff, uh, in their day-to-day trading. Uh, they want, they want, they want, uh, they,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21323200","21326480"," it's like, hey, I want this and I don't want, I feel naked without trading with it. Uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21326480","21330880"," Joe Donuts said it to me. Uh, Binky said it to me. Some other people said it to me. Uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21330880","21335440"," and I feel the same way myself. I wouldn't trade without it. I wouldn't, I wouldn't personally"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21335440","21338240"," trade. I wouldn't even buy this market without it. So, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21343360","21348080"," yeah, the, the, the pricing is, is justified where we roam. I think that it is. If it's not,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21348080","21352800"," uh, you just call me up and say, fuck you, cap. This thing sucks or everything you're doing sucks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21353280","21358160"," Uh, here's another side too that like, let me explain, let me talk about some of that free,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21358160","21363680"," enhanced free stuff. Um, you know, like right now it's a one man show. Uh, well, it's a one man"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21363680","21366720"," show by me, but there's a bunch of people working in the background. Let's, let's look at that for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21366720","21373040"," a minute. You know, if I, I found out the ability to stream, uh, you know, hey, cap's not here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21373040","21376640"," The tool's not here. What do we do? You kind of fucked right as a free user."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21376640","21382720"," Kind of fucked, right? If cap's not, uh, posting on Fintuit, uh, you're kind of left holding your"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21382720","21390000"," dick, right? Inveritably, when we monetize this, you're going to have other people with access,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21390000","21394960"," showing it, you're going to have to be able to ask other people. Uh, I have the ability then to pay"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21394960","21401760"," for people to stream, right? To post content, to be available for you on a more consistent basis."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21402240","21407760"," Uh, so you know, like that, that seamlessness and that more consistent basis and more consistent"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21407760","21413600"," stream schedule, more consistent market updates, more consistent, like just consistency all along,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21414240","21418880"," more consistent user experience. Like what do they say for like Apple and all these tech companies is,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21419360","21423520"," um, you make, you make something and you make it what? You make it user friendly."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21424320","21430320"," You make it, uh, ease of use and you make it, um, you make it, uh, something that's, um,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","21435360","21439680"," right? Cause it's a free model. We're kind of like in this beta all around right now as to what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21439680","21446240"," we're doing. Um, and I want to smooth that out, that experience out for people. And it's hopefully"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21446240","21448720"," this provides that. That's the, that's the, uh, gist here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21448720","21465440"," What else here? When does a captain's alpha ETF fun start trading? Um, we are talking right"

"_zb0kga97sQ","21502800","21509360"," Um, but you'd be, it'd be like a combine or a bootcamp from us. So we'd teach you as a day trader,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","21780240","21783920"," attracting all these guys? Because there aren't a lot of rules. There aren't a lot of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21783920","21787360"," fin run SEC rules and what a lot of the trading that's done like that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21788720","21793440"," Uh, so they're like skirting around, uh, the rules of the regular stock market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21793440","21797120"," It's been like a fucking boon for these guys, but like the biggest unicorn for these"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21797120","21803840"," scammers in years."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21809760","21817840"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21817840","21826720"," All right, that's all I've got. I got to get back to work."

"_zb0kga97sQ","21836000","21841120"," requires a lot of computing power and, um, it shouldn't, but it does. I got, I need like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21841120","21845200"," I need like six screens open second reference, not computing, I guess display power. I need"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21845200","21851200"," or I need to have like six displays up so I can bounce around and sit in a Google meet"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21852000","21855600"," meeting. So right exactly at four p.m. the stream will be shut down today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21858640","21862240"," Yeah, see that grind going on right here? This is the fucking, I mean, this is like,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21863600","21867520"," like even when they break up here, right? Coming into the end of the day. What are they doing now,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21867520","21871280"," right? You're like, fuck yeah, I'm on zero dates. They take you up here. What do they do? Just start"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21871280","21875920"," fucking grinding them, right? Start grinding your fucking calls for that. That what you're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21875920","21883040"," expecting is a squeeze. Just fucking dust right now. Thank you for playing, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21886480","21891200"," Hey, you're welcome. Thanks all of you guys for showing up. Uh, Bork, I'm going to be reaching"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21891200","21898960"," out to you today. Uh, Bork McGork is going, if you guys don't know, Bork McGork is going to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21898960","21903280"," possibly, if he says, yes, this guy's really smart. I don't know if you guys know this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21903920","21908880"," Uh, so I was looking at Bork. I checked out Bork in the background. Uh, he's a very smart guy."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21909680","21916400"," Uh, very intelligent. We don't already follow Bork McGork. Uh, he's on Fintuit. He's been on"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21916400","21924880"," Fintuit for a long time. Uh, very long time. I think 2009. And, uh, he's very smart. I didn't"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21924880","21928640"," just like do a cursory look. I wanted to see what kind of a person he was. Very intelligent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21929280","21934720"," Uh, very insightful, uh, poignant. And it looks like he has a cool life, whatever he's doing out"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21934720","21940720"," there in the real world. So, uh, we're going to try to bring, uh, Bork McGork on and see if he,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21941200","21946160"," um, is a fit. Uh, I don't know if he's a fit or not. He might be, might not be if he isn't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21946160","21952160"," Uh, we'll still be friendly with him like everybody else. Um, uh, but Bork McGork, uh, we're going to,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21952160","21958640"," we're going to possibly bring him on as a Twitch administrator. Uh, and I'm hoping that he has"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21958640","21964160"," some YouTube experience so that we can have, um, uh, more of a cultivated experience like when"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21964160","21969920"," Winky was helping us out because Winky did a great fucking job, right? Um, Winky was like"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21969920","21976640"," right hand man still to his day. Love, uh, Winky, but as an administrator, we need someone to fill"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21976640","21981760"," that role and it looks like Bork can do that. Like he has experience doing that too."
"_zb0kga97sQ","21981760","21988720"," So if you don't, if you don't follow him already, uh, if you want to follow him, find him on Twitter"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21989440","21995440"," and, um, I hope that he's the right fit. And everything I saw, I think he is the right fit. So,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","21995440","22001520"," I think we'll get along great. So, I think he's got a positivity about him that, uh, members need to,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22002160","22006640"," um, we don't want like, of course you, Bork probably already knows this, but some of you have"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22006720","22011920"," been around since the beginning. We don't want the, um, dictator fight him, fight them inside of our,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22012880","22018880"," discord or the website or the screen. We want happy, right? Who I'm able to have a good time"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22018880","22024080"," want to be here. And Bork seems like he facilitates that, at least from his online presence that I"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22024080","22036560"," could see. Uh, so yeah, Bork McGark, check him out on Twitter and, uh, I'm going to try to, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22037200","22041680"," find out if we can, we can get him to, uh, join, uh, join our group. I'm looking forward to it, man."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22042400","22045520"," If you're, if you're, I don't know if you're still here or not right now, but if you're out there,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22045520","22048080"," Bork, uh, I'm looking forward to it, man."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22058960","22061200"," Yeah, he's, he's here. I can see. I just saw our post from,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22061200","22066640"," um, it says, uh, day job deals with making free textbooks, free textbooks, I'm all about it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22066640","22072080"," Thanks, Bork. Yeah, man. Dude, I saw, I was really impressed. I saw you, I actually checked out a"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22072080","22077760"," lot of your replies across the internet going back a few years and, um, I really liked it, man."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22077760","22079040"," Your content was fucking great."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22085440","22088880"," Cool. All right. Well, so we got here. Anything else? Any other big questions? Anything that's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22088880","22094400"," not charting a stock for you? What do you guys got for me? You guys have any questions for me"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22094400","22098240"," out there? Anything you want to answer before tomorrow? Be aware. I already told you earlier,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22098240","22105200"," be aware that, uh, there is a quote, unquote window of weakness tomorrow. It's not, doesn't mean"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22105200","22110320"," market crash, doesn't mean we even go down. Let's be aware that it's in. So like, here's an example."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22110320","22116800"," So like today, yesterday, we know where the, uh, support levels are. We know where the, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22116800","22122640"," resistance levels are, right? But there are days in a month where those levels, uh,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22122640","22127040"," you might be like, Hey, why didn't that level hold or why did we break through that level?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22127040","22132080"," And there's other mechanics in the background, uh, that are taking place. Okay. It's the same thing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22132080","22138320"," as, um, when we couldn't remember, we couldn't break through 4600. We needed call side development"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22138320","22145520"," to the upside at that point. We needed like 4,700 to open up 40, uh, 4650. We needed a 4750."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22145520","22153680"," And now we're looking for 4800 5,000 levels to open up to go higher, right? So there's like doors,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22153680","22156800"," right? Think of it like a door, right? A door is locked and a door is unlocked."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22157520","22164160"," Just be aware that tomorrow there are some unlocked doors in the market. Doesn't mean we,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22164160","22167520"," it doesn't mean you walk up to the door and it's, you know, you bounce into the door. It's going to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22167520","22171680"," open. It's just that there is a door with the door that's unlocked. So if price, if we were to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22171680","22178000"," have real money selling, real money buying, any of that kind of stuff, we can overpower the"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22178000","22184160"," options market. You guys, some of you guys understand that, right? That's really what a window of"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22184160","22189040"," weakness is basically real money buying, real money selling, overrunning the options market."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22193600","22197520"," Are you guys want to see Tesla really quick? I'll show you Tesla. Let's take a look at Tesla here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22197520","22206240"," I see the Tesla bulls in there. They're all wondering. Let's take a look. It's a Tesla"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22206240","22211680"," one minute chart. We got the green bar up there, right? Go to a 30 minute chart on Tesla. Let's talk"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22211680","22218880"," about it. Whoo. Here's Tesla, a 30 minute chart, right? We kind of did this for you yesterday."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22219920","22224480"," All right, let's take a look and see what happened. I said, yeah, we're probably going to squeeze"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22224560","22228320"," up here, break down and then slam up there. What do we do? We didn't even do that, did we?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22228960","22234080"," We said, fuck you, boom, right? I guess we did it. But then what else did we do?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22234080","22239520"," Rip up and slam into that green bar again, right? So we kind of did it. Not exact, but pretty close"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22240080","22244880"," and see it right there, right? Came, I said, yeah, we're going to go up, right? We did one little"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22244880","22249760"," bloodbath down, slammed up there, right? Came back. Well, we didn't slam up there. I guess we,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22250720","22257360"," let's say we slammed up there, came back down right here. And then we had that nice squeeze up"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22258320","22264240"," and got above, right? Did it sooner than later over here? We already did it. What's next for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22264240","22268480"," Tesla bull? Let's look at it. Let's take a look. Let's go to the main trigger screen here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22270160","22275200"," All right, what are we doing here? Do you guys know what we're doing here? I don't know if you do"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22275200","22280000"," or don't know, but this is what I'm going to tell you is happening. Fucking bulls caught in this."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22281680","22288560"," Blast down, right? So you're a trader. We're going to go ahead. We're going to go back to this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22288560","22296000"," discussion from earlier of listening to other bulls, right? So now we're coming up and I'm going"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22296000","22302640"," to promise you that there are people right there, people right here, people right here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22303440","22312400"," people right here, and they're in your air. They're telling you Tesla is bullish. Why? Because they're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22312400","22319200"," up here and they're way upside down. So they're going to tell you if you're not already long,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22319840","22323520"," they're going to say to you, we're going to the moon. We're going to the moon. We're going up"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22323520","22331200"," here. Why? Because they just want to get out. They just want to exit over here. And what they own,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22331280","22335760"," what these people do is they wind up buying tops all the time. That's what they do. They buy"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22335760","22340240"," tops. They're top buyers. So that what happens is they get caught here, right? They get blood"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22340240","22345680"," bath. I'm going to talk the cycle to you. They're doom and gloomers, but they're still holding."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22345680","22350480"," They're still holding down here. They didn't didn't get squeezed out down below, right? They made"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22350480","22356400"," it through the pain. And now we come up here and they go, Oh, fuck. Yes. You know, I didn't"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22356400","22360800"," thank God I didn't sell, right? So we come up here and say, start telling their friends. They're"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22360800","22367680"," like, Oh, dude, we're going to the moon, bro. But in reality, as we come up here, guess what they do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22368640","22375200"," They fucking sell right there. And then they go, I'm just going to stay out of the market. I learned"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22375200","22381440"," my lesson from over there. I'm going to wait to buy. You don't realize that when you're up here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22381440","22385280"," right? Well, that guy's talking to you. Now that guy that was talking to you before,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22385360","22390320"," guess what he does. Now he's sitting on the sidelines, he's watching all this action. And guess what he"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22390320","22395040"," does? We squeeze up here, or we actually squeeze up here, then up there, he's actually up here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22395040","22400960"," fucking buying again. And then he goes to the entire cycle one more time. So that's what's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22400960","22405760"," happening right now. You've got people selling into you. You've got the, of course, you get funds"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22405760","22410240"," and all that selling into you. Then you also have trap buyers selling into you. So what do you need"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22410240","22415280"," to do? You need to need to need to wear out all of these sellers that were trapped here. These"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22415280","22419920"," aren't actually bears. These are probably bulls, or you have bears, but then you have bulls doing it too,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22419920","22428000"," right? So until we break through these previous sellers here, we should be doing this. But this"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22428000","22434640"," is all positive. This is all very positive. It's all very positive for more upside to come."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22435600","22442400"," So what I would like to see, what I would like to see is, let's take a look back here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22444320","22450800"," right there, right? We're going to draw another one right here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22455840","22458080"," These are more trap buyers up here, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22458080","22468640"," A little yellow bar right there. You got another one right here. Small one right there, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22471040","22475680"," And you got these two bad boys right here. Let's look at these back here. That's a beautiful one"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22475680","22492080"," right there, right? 300. You might be asking, why am I drawing these in? It's because how much"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22492080","22497920"," volatility do we actually have above us, right? Would you have these yellow bars altogether,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22497920","22503360"," or is it just one or two bars? And then this bad, this is this is the squeeze right here, by the way,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22504320","22511280"," it's a big old fat squeeze in here right there. That one's red, okay?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22515280","22522640"," Right there. So this kind of shows you the path, right? For spoons or for Tesla, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22523200","22528560"," You got a lot of sellers in here, and you got a big old squeeze up here to 300, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22529440","22532080"," So I'll tell you this here, okay?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22534080","22540960"," When you see that daily trend, this is this is very bullish here, extremely bullish."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22541520","22546000"," You want to see that trend continue to the upside, so you're going to be looking for"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22547040","22556000"," some kind of trend, right? See some kind of trend, and you want to see price, just keep doing what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22556000","22562800"," it's doing, right? Slam up, where out sellers come back down, slam up, come back down here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22562800","22567280"," slam up, come back down here, slam up, just like that. Sit on here. Yeah,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22567280","22570960"," everything's awesome. We're going to go to 300, right? Just like that. So as long as we stand"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22570960","22579360"," trend the whole way up and you're buying dips down here, you'd put your stops just on this trend,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22579360","22585280"," right? Stops down here, right? See any kind of like rejection, we pull back and we start to"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22585280","22591200"," reject and start heading down, beaten up, previous lows, you're going to cut yourself out of that"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22591200","22597360"," long thesis to the upside. The best place to buy was down here. I want to show you why."
"_zb0kga97sQ","22599680","22610720"," Tesla trades almost perfectly on negative daily velocity. Whenever I see like minus 50,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22610720","22615920"," minus 25, minus 50 on Tesla, it's time to buy it. So if you're, if you're already in down here,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22615920","22620240"," congratulations, you're just, you're just on the ride right now, just heading higher and higher and"

"_zb0kga97sQ","22639200","22646240"," subscribe to that. I think I either want to see this first and buy that back test to get up there"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22646960","22651840"," or I want to see another roll down and just keep hammering away every time I go up there and hammer"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22651840","22656960"," these or buy or you're a buyer. If there's another role you're down here and you're a buyer, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22656960","22661200"," If we sit up here at any point, that'd be a buyer here too. So buyer right there,"

"_zb0kga97sQ","22668960","22674080"," I'd be taking the money and running. That's a trade. Now I want to see Tesla get above"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22674960","22681360"," and sit here and then beat this previous high right here and start to grind all this stuff out"

"_zb0kga97sQ","22781280","22785840"," we don't have a vertical red line and a vertical white line right now. Do a white line red line"
"_zb0kga97sQ","22785840","22790960"," vertical. We don't price above it right now. So we are in some kind of consolidation distribution"

"_zb0kga97sQ","23592400","23597400"," It was really cool. It was a good. It's not a bad feeling. It was a pretty good feeling."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23597400","23602400"," My real friends are on the stream. My real friends are on Twitter. My real friends are on Discord."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23602400","23613400"," My real life friends happen to be online. It's kind of weird. It's kind of weird."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23613400","23619400"," I never had that in my life. I'll be honest, I haven't spent a lot of my life online."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23620400","23625400"," It's never been where I've done eight hours or ten hours online. It's just different."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23625400","23629400"," Something that I noted."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23629400","23638400"," We already know that there are just the same source sales. We're up 3.9% in the quarter, excluding gas prices."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23638400","23644400"," Jeremy Hofstetter says, thanks, Cap. My friends are salespeople that I buy farm equipment from."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23645400","23650400"," I'm with you, Jeremy. I had this realization last night."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23650400","23659400"," People that I care about are mostly online. I got a few really close personal friends in real life."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23659400","23664400"," I could count them on one or two hands."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23664400","23669400"," But I have another real friend in life that's on the internet."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23670400","23674400"," I never knew how much that meant to me, I guess, in that aspect."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23674400","23677400"," Everyone was asleep last night. I'm like, oh, dude, I missed my friends."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23677400","23680400"," I'm like, who are my friends? They're all online."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23680400","23682400"," That was really cool."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23682400","23686400"," It was really cool, not going to lie."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23686400","23692400"," Billy Ray saying, so weird, my baby girl is a mom now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23692400","23697400"," That's awesome, man. That is awesome."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23698400","23703400"," Your wife refers to me as the guy. I've been trying to slow down with the swearing."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23703400","23709400"," I've been trying to clean it up. I have actively been trying to swear less than I used to."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23709400","23713400"," I used to be really bad, but I still swear, and I need to cut that out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23713400","23717400"," I need to make this a little bit more polished and professional."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23717400","23722400"," What I'd really like to do, too, is I don't know how this is going to roll out,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23722400","23727400"," but I'd really like to keep the... You guys know how I have a straight base"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23727400","23732400"," on Captain Zalfa generally, like 99% of the time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23732400","23738400"," I'd like to move all of that stuff public on the Trade the Trigger handle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23738400","23748400"," If you don't like my rants on public, we'll have a Twitter handle called Trade the Trigger."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23749400","23760400"," I'd like to make that a public persona that's the serious, soberish Captain,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23760400","23768400"," and then bring in my Captain Jim James profile and make that just mine."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23768400","23771400"," If you're like, fuck that guy, he's up late drinking."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23771400","23774400"," By the way, you guys think I'm drinking, I'm not."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23774400","23780400"," They're overtired, or I've eaten gummies, I'll be honest with you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23780400","23782400"," I get all goofy and funny."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23782400","23785400"," Late night, wife, kids go to bed, and I'm still awake."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23785400","23786400"," I don't get a lot of sleep."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23786400","23789400"," You guys don't notice, but I don't sleep a lot."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23789400","23796400"," I'm awake and working most hours of the day."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23796400","23802400"," If you ever see me online, to the point where I'm trying to say here is,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23802400","23808400"," if you're like, I can't stand following him on Twitter, because he gets on late night"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23808400","23809400"," and he fucks around."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23809400","23814400"," How ghost finds his friends, all kinds of stupid shit that I do on Twitter at night time."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23814400","23821400"," You can either mute me at night, or what I was thinking was that I would, instead of doing"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23821400","23825400"," the mix of, this is another part to some of the stuff I do, so I've got to tell you guys"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23825400","23826400"," about some shit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23826400","23828400"," So, it's 4 p.m."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23829400","23833400"," Okay, I got to get it going, but I got, well, we'll wrap this up in one last talk."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23833400","23839400"," So, it's a mix of like shit posting and real serious shit that I post on my handle, okay?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23839400","23851400"," Intermixed in that stuff, I try to throw off scrapers like data scrapers, data sellers."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23851400","23857400"," There's a lot of data scraping that goes on, on Twitter, and bots."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23857400","23862400"," Like, I could probably have 100,000 followers if I want it on Twitter."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23862400","23865400"," I don't fucking want 100,000 followers on Twitter."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23865400","23871400"," I'd rather have 1,000 or less, I'll be honest, on my Captain Jim James handle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23871400","23873400"," So, the less followers I have, the better off I am."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23873400","23879400"," When you start getting into like 100,000 followers, what happens is I have to be exacting what"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23879400","23880400"," I post."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23880400","23884400"," It all has to be backed by data that I have to post."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23884400","23887400"," And if I, let's say I see some data and I'm like, yeah, this is what's going to happen,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23887400","23888400"," and I'll post it, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23888400","23891400"," People are like, I want to see it, I want you to do this, that, and everything."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23891400","23897400"," So, the more followers I have, the shittier the experience becomes for me."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23897400","23904400"," So, my thinking here is, I'm not sure I'm going to do this, but my thinking here is after"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23904400","23912400"," this weekend, you'll see all of the serious Captain on the trade the trigger handle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23912400","23917400"," And if you want to just be my friend, like in real life, that Captain Jim James handle"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23917400","23922400"," will likely turn into no more, hey, this is going to happen, that's going to happen,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23922400","23924400"," I'm long, I'm short, or whatever."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23924400","23930400"," So, you'll see more of a, you'll see more of like a, I don't know, a combined at Captain's"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23930400","23939400"," Alpha and the serious Captain Jim James and the serious at Captain's Alpha shift over"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23939400","23945400"," to the trade the trigger handle, and you might see a very toned down, just, this is me,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23945400","23947400"," not anything to do with trading."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23947400","23954400"," I might be, it'll be shit posting about trading, but I'm trying to push like all this stuff"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23954400","23957400"," off into this trade the trigger thing if I can."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23957400","23960400"," What do you, let me think about that, tell me what you think of that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23960400","23966400"," Cause I know some people hate my fucking Twitter profile or personality, it's intentional,"
"_zb0kga97sQ","23966400","23967400"," I want you to know that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23968400","23972400"," Many of you guys don't know that, I have another handle that I keep a very straight face on."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23972400","23974400"," That's very fucking straight face."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23974400","23977400"," So, I don't know what to do here."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23977400","23983400"," I think I'm going to switch to make a public straight face, and then this is actually who I am."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23989400","23992400"," You love the surly cap, happy posts."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23993400","23997400"," Most of the time, not that surly either, just pointing something out."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23997400","23999400"," That's another thing that I can't do either."
"_zb0kga97sQ","23999400","24003400"," I can do less pointing out these days than I used to be able to."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24003400","24007400"," You've got a thousand followers, dude, you can say whatever you want, nobody's watching."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24007400","24012400"," Right now, it's like you get like 10,000 followers or more, everyone's fucking watching you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24012400","24014400"," I'm serious, it sucks."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24015400","24022400"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24022400","24025400"," We're town sheriff's making a point that's real."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24025400","24026400"," This is true."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24026400","24030400"," I want you to know, right, that some of the stuff that I post on Twitter, that is a shitpost."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24030400","24033400"," If that's making you angry, it's intentional."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24033400","24039400"," It's not that I believe it or that I am trying, or I'm even trying to make anger."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24039400","24040400"," I'm not actually trying to make anger."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24040400","24042400"," I'm just trying to make it think, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","24043400","24050400"," It's intentional that it's gating a reaction out of you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24050400","24057400"," Mostly, I'm trying to draw in so that you're not angry, so we can discuss things or see what your perspective is, that kind of stuff."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24057400","24059400"," It's not like, hey, he's a fucking asshole."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24059400","24060400"," I don't hate anybody."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24060400","24061400"," I don't hate anybody."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24061400","24062400"," I don't hate anybody."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24062400","24063400"," I don't hate anybody."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24063400","24064400"," I'm finned to it either."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24064400","24065400"," In reality."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24065400","24069400"," There's nobody out there that I really fucking truly hate on finned to it."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24070400","24074400"," If you're watching right now, listen to me right now and be like, I hate cap or he hates me."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24074400","24075400"," I don't hate you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24075400","24076400"," In any way, shape or form."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24076400","24081400"," I think it's snap proving that that is now focused on managing the business cycle."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24081400","24084400"," Bear town sheriff, you're correct, man."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24084400","24092400"," I'm trying to attract bears and bulls and teach them how to be buyers and sellers that support demand."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24092400","24098400"," There's part of the way I do is about attracting young traders intentionally."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24098400","24102400"," They have a place to go to learn tools and become a better trader."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24102400","24104400"," Some of the stuff that I post."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24104400","24105400"," Yeah."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24105400","24114400"," Yeah, I don't want to be a dickhead or an asshole."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24114400","24116400"," You know, and sometimes I do."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24116400","24117400"," I will say this too."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24117400","24120400"," I have shit posted before and pissed people off."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24120400","24124400"," And when I do, I delete those posts because that is not my intent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24124400","24125400"," And I have done that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24126400","24129400"," I've had a probably the past three years on Twitter."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24129400","24131400"," I've probably had."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24131400","24137400"," And maybe a two or three a year that I'm like, fuck, I got to delete that."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24137400","24140400"," I'm being a cocksucker or dickhead right now."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24140400","24145400"," Or I'm a fucking clown or a asshole or insensitivity."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24145400","24149400"," Sometimes I've said things that's two that are very insensitive."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24149400","24154400"," I use the word regard recently and I had to delete that post."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24154400","24159400"," It's not recently, but a winky was talking to me about it and was like, hey, man, you"
"_zb0kga97sQ","24159400","24161400"," know, when we were young, that was acceptable today."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24161400","24162400"," It isn't."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24162400","24163400"," And he was right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24163400","24166400"," You know, so I went through and tried to delete all that shit because I don't want to piss"
"_zb0kga97sQ","24166400","24167400"," people off."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24167400","24168400"," Some of my intent."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24168400","24172400"," We bring them here to you career low."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24172400","24174400"," That's what we bring to do with them."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24174400","24176400"," I'm trying to get them to."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24176400","24178400"," I'm trying to get them to meet you."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24178400","24179400"," Seriously."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24180400","24186400"," I want them to meet you and John L. and Ray Volley and Blind Nestle, David AMS, Stacey"
"_zb0kga97sQ","24186400","24191400"," and John H. And all these guys are in these comment sections, right?"
"_zb0kga97sQ","24191400","24192400"," All of you guys."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24192400","24193400"," Well, guys are in this court."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24193400","24196400"," The people in the community, the people in the community and Twitter."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24196400","24197400"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24197400","24199400"," Hey, welcome to the community."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24199400","24202400"," Kind of stuff."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24202400","24203400"," All right."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24203400","24204400"," Oh, shit."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24204400","24205400"," I got to go."
"_zb0kga97sQ","24205400","24206400"," I got a fucking go."
