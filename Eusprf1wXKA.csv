"Eusprf1wXKA","291500","295100"," influences in the market right now we might talk a little bit about TLT and"
"Eusprf1wXKA","295100","297660"," that kind of stuff later on if I can get to it but if not"
"Eusprf1wXKA","297660","301500"," right now this market we are we're coming into a seasonal down period you have"
"Eusprf1wXKA","301500","304060"," to understand that that's what's happened that's going to happen"
"Eusprf1wXKA","304060","308940"," it's going to happen now from now until springtime and there's two"
"Eusprf1wXKA","308940","312700"," questions on the table right now right but this comes up"
"Eusprf1wXKA","312700","317100"," every single year and that is you know do we go higher"
"Eusprf1wXKA","317100","321660"," from here or is are we coming into some kind of armageddon"
"Eusprf1wXKA","321660","324460"," that's those are fair questions I guess they are"
"Eusprf1wXKA","324460","329020"," we are high but you know if you have that bare thesis"
"Eusprf1wXKA","329020","336140"," we are going to go so much higher for that bare thesis to actually play out"
"Eusprf1wXKA","336140","341420"," if we come down right now let's say we go down we drop 15 percent"
"Eusprf1wXKA","341420","348300"," then that crushes any bare thesis if we were to if we were to burn 15"
"Eusprf1wXKA","348300","352540"," percent off the market from now until even march"
"Eusprf1wXKA","352540","356540"," that would destroy the bare thesis it would destroy the bubble thesis"
"Eusprf1wXKA","356540","359660"," it might show more of a controlled market still"
"Eusprf1wXKA","359660","365980"," but that that's not the bare thesis but the bare thesis to play out"
"Eusprf1wXKA","365980","369500"," you have if you look I mean you can't really it's hard to find these"
"Eusprf1wXKA","369500","374620"," these things but you can find old tv news stories you know you're going to"

"Eusprf1wXKA","378140","382380"," four percent five percent a day some people argue that"
"Eusprf1wXKA","382380","386140"," bubbles today will roll over i've heard that argument as well"
"Eusprf1wXKA","386380","390060"," as we have rolled over somewhat in the past but"
"Eusprf1wXKA","390060","394780"," they've they'll they'll use the the numbers to sail in 2007 2008 it took"
"Eusprf1wXKA","394780","398300"," until it took a year for to roll over but in reality"
"Eusprf1wXKA","398300","402940"," once we hit that peak way back in 2007 man it was like"
"Eusprf1wXKA","402940","407980"," it was fucking bonkers and you'll see that you'll see that bonkers"
"Eusprf1wXKA","407980","414300"," if we truly are in a bubble you will see this mad rush to the top"
"Eusprf1wXKA","414300","417500"," and if you think this summer was a mad rush to the top"
"Eusprf1wXKA","417500","420860"," you're fucking crazy dude like there ain't no fucking way this was a mad"

"Eusprf1wXKA","432140","436860"," last year that this shit's nothing you just when you think you've seen it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","436860","441340"," all you will see if we're actually in a bubble"
"Eusprf1wXKA","441340","445980"," you will see valuations go bonkers"
"Eusprf1wXKA","445980","451500"," anyways so my my thesis right now until it proves otherwise which it takes"
"Eusprf1wXKA","451500","453820"," other i talked about this in twitter this week"
"Eusprf1wXKA","453820","459900"," it takes quarters takes months and months to see a real bear market"
"Eusprf1wXKA","459900","465820"," it takes months to see that we're in an armageddon type phase"
"Eusprf1wXKA","465820","470620"," no stocks don't just go down even when even if we go to a bear market they"
"Eusprf1wXKA","470620","474380"," just don't go down they they go down but they don't go down"

"Eusprf1wXKA","846220","852060"," information that you need and i i need this in i i i play fd's all day long"
"Eusprf1wXKA","852060","855420"," so if i'm day trading all day long playing fd's i need to know to the"
"Eusprf1wXKA","855420","859740"," millisecond where we're going right so that's why i"
"Eusprf1wXKA","859740","862860"," trade i use that as my battle map heading into the day"
"Eusprf1wXKA","862860","867260"," but the reason i posted this chart with a line underneath it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","867260","872140"," the other day was because i've made videos on this in the past right i've"
"Eusprf1wXKA","872140","875100"," made videos on"
"Eusprf1wXKA","876780","882220"," buying when when should you be a bull buying dips right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","882220","886060"," i talked to you about if you had only made trades on these times"
"Eusprf1wXKA","886060","889260"," i've made these videos in the past where i say if you bought on these lines"
"Eusprf1wXKA","889260","893660"," that uh you could have just bought these and you would be rich"
"Eusprf1wXKA","893660","896940"," that's it you'd be rich if you didn't have a gambling problem betting on this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","896940","900140"," market this is all you had to buy this whole entire year"
"Eusprf1wXKA","900140","904380"," and this works itself out every year whether you believe that or not"
"Eusprf1wXKA","904380","907980"," if the trend is going up or if the trend is going down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","907980","912300"," if you buy these lines they print and the same goes"
"Eusprf1wXKA","912300","916940"," holds true generally for the bearish view right so if you're a bear"
"Eusprf1wXKA","916940","920940"," generally it eventually comes down if you're to buy put spreads up here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","920940","923980"," all you're long they're eventually going to print"
"Eusprf1wXKA","923980","929980"," so i put put this up on friday because now this is basic right here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","929980","933660"," now if you look at the m a's well i'll put the m a's up on this chart so you can"
"Eusprf1wXKA","933660","937820"," see it's a little bit lower over here the m the 50 m a"
"Eusprf1wXKA","937820","941340"," and i use the 50 i use the 50 i use the hundred"
"Eusprf1wXKA","941340","944620"," i use the yeah i use the 150 and the 200"
"Eusprf1wXKA","944620","951740"," and i will also use vwap for day trading"
"Eusprf1wXKA","951740","957420"," when i'm trading but the key here is uh like i think the 50 is somewhere"
"Eusprf1wXKA","957420","962060"," i think the 50 is some or i'll just look at the 50 on the uh"
"Eusprf1wXKA","962140","965740"," that's the 50 right here so let's let's make this the 50"
"Eusprf1wXKA","965740","969340"," i think this is the 50 i would prop the uh"
"Eusprf1wXKA","969340","973100"," moving averages so we have a little bit more that we could come down here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","973100","977740"," but the key is that if you buy here or if you bought here all year long"
"Eusprf1wXKA","977740","981180"," it didn't it wouldn't matter if you it wouldn't matter if this crashed"
"Eusprf1wXKA","981180","986780"," through today or monday because you won nine out of ten times this year"
"Eusprf1wXKA","986780","990780"," that's what's important and let's see if we can get this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","990780","994700"," we can bring this down a little bit and we can add another one"
"Eusprf1wXKA","994700","997340"," down here somewhere for the doom and gloomers"
"Eusprf1wXKA","997340","1001660"," we dip even deeper you know if you look at the 50 m a it's"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1001660","1005500"," it's a little bit lower than here you can do that that's no problem doing that"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1005500","1010540"," make this smaller i guess maybe not you bring this up a little bit more"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1010540","1014940"," so we're not ultra ultra bare doom and gloom"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1015900","1020460"," no but you have to consider these when we come down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1020460","1023500"," let me look maybe i should look back for i don't know if i should look back with"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1023500","1027100"," you let's just look right here this is"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1027100","1032380"," september 20th right of 2020 and even when we came down in this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1032380","1036060"," time period you can see when we came down in this time period"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1036060","1041340"," it wasn't a straight line down and whenever you do these drops like this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1041340","1044620"," right if there's continued downward movement"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1044620","1048620"," it's usually a violent pullback up we didn't get that here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1048620","1052860"," we actually stopped right we came back up for further decline but you see that"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1052860","1057420"," we go up and down while we're on a decline so if you're a bear"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1057420","1060940"," unless you're buying fucking put spreads or some kind"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1060940","1064140"," or some kind of theta put put theta strategy"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1064140","1069740"," you can pull legs off uh you can't just be buying fucking puts and expect"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1069740","1072860"," these things to print all the way down it's just not going to happen"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1072860","1077900"," so you have to consider that from your bull thesis or your bear thesis"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1077900","1081180"," if you hear people let's say let's say this is let's say this was this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1081180","1085900"," weekend right here right so let's say we fell here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1085900","1091020"," and you hear a bear saying oh next day we're going to burn again right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1091020","1095020"," well we didn't right we came back up and we came back down over here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1095020","1099020"," so when you hear a bear screaming that we're going to keep going down it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1099020","1102540"," typically doesn't happen it's typically full mowing it's just like bulls"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1102540","1106300"," buying tops over here and telling you that the next stop is up here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1106300","1109980"," when the roars get louder and louder typically"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1109980","1113500"," there's going to be a pullback in either direction right that's if you're a bull"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1113500","1117420"," if you hear everybody saying buy this if you're a bear hair bear saying"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1117420","1121420"," got by this down here or here or here or here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1121420","1125020"," it's typically going to go the other way and that that's the case that's what I"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1125020","1126940"," heard over the weekend that's a hard Friday you know"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1126940","1130940"," through the weekend was this this drum beat that we're going down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1130940","1136620"," farther over here so we're going to go a little bit closer over here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1136620","1141740"," we're going to we're taking in a little bit"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1141740","1146940"," now if we gap down into Monday I want you to understand that the more we gap"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1146940","1150060"," down the more violent the swing up is going to be"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1150060","1155100"," be aware of that be aware of that so my example would be this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1155100","1162380"," so let's say we continue our downward move right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1163340","1168300"," if you spring down through here you should expect more than 450 if we"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1168300","1171100"," swing down here you better be expecting all time high"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1171100","1175580"," is once again keep that in mind so if you're expecting a gap down on Monday"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1175580","1179820"," morning you see us head down here till let's call it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1179820","1183500"," four forty four forty four twenty five or lower"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1183500","1187260"," I will guarantee you that you will see I'm not going I'll give you like I'll"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1187260","1190380"," tell you that it's about an 80 to 90 percent chance"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1190380","1193420"," that you will see all time all time highs once again"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1193420","1197740"," almost guaranteed if we are green tomorrow morning"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1197740","1200940"," you're going to be looking for"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1201660","1205740"," somewhere between let's put these in"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1206220","1215260"," somewhere between 450 or 4508 75 right that's where things become unsafe"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1218380","1220380"," to wherever this yellow line is right here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1221580","1224860"," it could be anywhere right it could be"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1224860","1230220"," 415 it could come straight up though to four four forty five 24"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1230220","1235180"," so my plan for Monday is to look to see where we open if we open with a gap"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1235180","1239420"," down I'll buy that gap down with a lot of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1239420","1243980"," shit with a lot of shit I'll probably go in like 30 percent"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1243980","1248060"," of my account anything down here I'm in for 10 percent heading up to a"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1248060","1253900"," for a play up here and there is another resistance here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1255820","1261660"," we'll put that one down right there this resistance is possible as well"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1261660","1266060"," you can see that's the 14th see this right here we'll get closer on this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1271500","1274300"," this is a good place to be looking right here right let's look at"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1274300","1282300"," uh opex right figure friday's opex and the 14th wednesday 15th"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1282860","1286140"," we have another small opex that's right here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1288220","1289820"," right then we've got friday opex"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1291740","1293740"," and that is 17"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1297340","1298780"," call that the 17"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1302060","1305020"," 1600 let's make this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1308620","1310620"," nope"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1313580","1314860"," 1600 right there"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1316540","1320940"," so tomorrow right i'm looking to buy anything anything"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1320940","1326860"," from looking to buy anything that's at 44 30 point 25"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1326860","1331340"," to anywhere below 43 61 i i think you're smoking crack if you think you're going"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1331340","1334940"," that low but let's just say you did anything below here i'm buying what"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1334940","1339340"," spreads i'm going to go probably on in with a third of my account"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1339340","1344700"," and i'm going to buy a shit ton of call fd's i have call fd's from monday here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1344700","1348060"," it could be a small but even if we come down here and touch right here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1348140","1351660"," i'm just going to buy more call fd's because one way or another"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1351660","1354620"," they're saying this isn't going to continue down this is"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1354620","1358140"," it's not going any deeper than this right here you can fucking you can"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1358140","1361260"," fucking put that in your bank account and bank on it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1361260","1365740"," so uh that's the deal is to go along here the other thing too was"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1365740","1370780"," on friday right at the close i posted on twitter uh like watch the i try to"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1370780","1374380"," watch the uh high frequency traders what they're doing"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1374380","1378940"," and they fucking came out of all their puts right at the fucking bell"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1378940","1384780"," and they went balls deep on 913 450c i didn't go that crazy i went"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1384780","1390220"," 448 sometimes they'll jump around on monday's"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1390220","1395420"," um they'll use it to hold it and then they'll jump higher to push it higher"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1395420","1400220"," the probably more money in the 450s they were only like 25 or 30 cents or"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1400220","1404060"," something stupid like that those could be like"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1404060","1410060"," 3000 bagger 3000 baggers it could be crazy if we get this low"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1410060","1413900"," but anyways that's another here nor there so tomorrow that's what you're looking"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1413900","1416540"," for you looking for some sort of bottom here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1416540","1421420"," either at this 4453 the sling shot up if we go straight green"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1421420","1427660"," it will hit a ceiling uh faster and maybe continue back down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1427660","1431580"," i don't expect it to continue to go up it might could possibly take until"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1431580","1434220"," wednesday to get this 450 number up here that's"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1434220","1440540"," possibility as well you could put another resistance if you're on fd's"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1440540","1445020"," if we don't go any deeper you probably want to sell at some point around"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1445020","1453660"," 448 or 448.80 if you're an fd holder if there's no further"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1453660","1458620"," decline you'll look for 448 a pullback pullback would be"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1458620","1461340"," somewhere in here right we know it's going to be somewhere in here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1461340","1464380"," so you'd expect something let me see if it can draw this let's say we don't"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1464380","1467100"," go any deeper if you don't go any deeper you're"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1467100","1475500"," going to look for something like this down and then up"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1475500","1479820"," towards this 450 by wednesday at some point"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1479820","1488700"," if we dip lower down here you're going to probably see a spike up to 450"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1488700","1491980"," no oil no later than tuesday if not same day"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1491980","1495660"," that's how that's how vicious and violent it can be"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1495660","1502380"," if you were to see something like like this anywhere down in here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1502380","1507340"," you can expect all-time highs guaranteed you can expect you know you got banks"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1507340","1509820"," they're going to want to go short but then you've got"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1509820","1514460"," some serious players that want i will get greedy"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1514460","1517260"," and they will ring this they will ring a bell"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1517260","1521420"," and they probably take them a week you don't think so but i guarantee it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1521420","1524540"," they'll ring a bell doing something crazy like this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1524540","1528140"," so think about this as the week progresses or as"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1528140","1531820"," monday progresses what you're really looking to do"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1531820","1538220"," is position yourself for a few things right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1538220","1541420"," so on monday"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1545740","1549100"," on monday you're looking to see where we start the day"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1549100","1556060"," and how far it does go up and into from now until wednesday"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1556060","1560620"," my a thought would be that they pin try to pin it somewhere in here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1560620","1566540"," for decline into opex on friday and i'm going to expect further decline"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1566540","1572620"," for the end of september uh into october"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1572620","1577100"," so you're looking to take this long beginning of the week"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1577100","1581100"," and you are looking for where to get positioning for further decline"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1581100","1585500"," where is that further decline now if we go way down here don't expect"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1585500","1589980"," decline just don't even bother okay just don't"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1589980","1594220"," if you see a gap down here tomorrow don't expect further decline we're going"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1594220","1601900"," up but if let's say we start monday green over here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1601900","1608380"," this yellow line right here and i'll put one more in"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1610700","1614220"," call it this line over here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1615100","1620540"," you're going to look for two things to happen"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1620540","1625180"," you're going to look for uh further decline into"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1625180","1628460"," this is let's see where we are right here so this is"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1628460","1633100"," September 24th 25th something like that if you're looking to grab"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1633100","1639180"," some in the money put spreads to be safe in case we continue to go up"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1639180","1643500"," and then if you're confirmed that we're going down right if we start let's say"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1643900","1649420"," we get this thing up here so let's say we come up here somewhere in this area"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1649420","1655020"," here or here right you can buy in the money put spreads up here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1655020","1658940"," and let's say we break through this resistance right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1658940","1663340"," you can always wait for us to come back down to sell out of those"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1663340","1667180"," puts to get better positioning up above right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1667180","1672140"," but if we if we hit resistance here then you can start to take more aggressive"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1672540","1678060"," put spreads into end of September somewhere down around this 440 number"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1678060","1682700"," maybe even possibly down to 436 if you wanted to get real aggressive with it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1682700","1687420"," but you want to be looking for some form of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1687420","1693980"," resistance levels to get your risk on you're looking for these"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1693980","1699020"," levels here to add more and more risk in puts"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1699100","1704220"," but don't wait for this one right here and go okay we're going to 436 from"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1704220","1707500"," this this first resistance levels that makes sense"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1707500","1711580"," you can start adding in the money slightly outside the money more outside"
"Eusprf1wXKA","1711580","1715020"," the money heavy outside the money to to go"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2000860","2004780"," it back up to no less than 15 520 or 15 580"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2056060","2061260"," NASDAQ heading into Monday and be sure that they're going to buy this over here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2061260","2066060"," no they're not gapping down to 15 142 I guess it's possible"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2066060","2071020"," just know though remember again just know if we gap down to this 15 141"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2071020","2074940"," you're going to start seeing like Apple people are going to want to buy it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2074940","2077420"," you're going to see people want to buy Amazon again"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2077420","2081100"," so keep this in mind when you're playing these indexes you start getting down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2081100","2084460"," in here right you're going to see a bull run"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2084460","2087900"," guaranteed okay just keep these keep these numbers in mind"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2087900","2093180"," you can see this here 15 377 15 309 there's a liquidity grab"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2093180","2095500"," possibly down here if there is a gap down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2095500","2100620"," and then for sure if you're a bull all balls to the walls in 15 150"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2100620","2103980"," unless some new you need some sort of news that we don't know yet to be getting"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2103980","2107820"," down here okay um or unless an OPEC's they're"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2107820","2110140"," thinking hey on Wednesday we're going to take it all the way down here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2110140","2113180"," and take this long I guess that would be scenario B"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2113180","2116060"," or C or whatever"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2116540","2120940"," next one's going to be the rut this is from last week"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2120940","2124300"," I think I put you know I'm positive I posted this chart for you last week"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2124300","2129020"," and you can see where we hit right in our trading area right we talked about"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2129020","2132140"," how the rut would go and sure enough it did"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2132140","2136060"," so we're going to look I'm going to clear the rut because I want to show"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2136060","2140540"," you guys something about the rut that interests me I"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2140620","2145020"," this is the rut is kind of my favorite thing man like I do the rut"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2145020","2149500"," often the rut pays very well it is better than a lot of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2149500","2152380"," stocks to be playing this is like I'm playing Amazon this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2152380","2157580"," shit's dope it really is so the I have some concern here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2157580","2161660"," we're we're gonna look at we're gonna look at the rut"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2162140","2167180"," and here's my concern with the rut okay"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2167180","2173660"," let's look at the concern on the rut"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2173660","2176860"," I've got some concern here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2178540","2182300"," so on the rut I looked back on this the rut going back"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2182300","2186060"," as far as I could to see how the rut typically plays out the one issue we"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2186060","2189500"," have right here is that this is again no man's land right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2189500","2193420"," you don't want to be taking positions here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2193500","2197500"," this is a bearish picture as the rut goes right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2197500","2200540"," the one thing that I noticed about the rut is that whenever we're in this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2200540","2203260"," middle area here you can see come up we come"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2203260","2206140"," down right we still tend to come down for a ground"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2206140","2209100"," higher when we come down through the middle"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2209100","2212940"," right we just tend to keep coming down right we came up here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2212940","2216220"," came down right but we didn't hit all time or we didn't hit"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2216220","2221020"," this upper resistance we did eventually try to make another push up here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2221020","2224700"," so over here we did hit resistance right so I'm not expecting us to make"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2224700","2228460"," the second push up right but we'll come back down all the way up"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2228460","2232860"," one more tag above we go coast to coast right come down here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2232860","2236620"," we should have had that tag but we didn't but we did eventually get that"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2236620","2241660"," tag so my take-on IWM is that I'm bearish on it"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2241660","2245020"," and I've been bearish on it for some time now"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2245020","2250620"," and I posted on twitter a bunch of a bunch of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2250620","2255420"," puts big puts that are looking for this 209"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2255420","2261100"," somewhere in this 209 number so I'm bearish on the mini"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2261100","2265340"," but I would not be taking a new position here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2266300","2273100"," until there's some sort of confirmation"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2273660","2276860"," down below"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2276860","2280540"," right there right down below we're going to show you in a smaller time"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2280540","2287660"," frame we're going to put some support levels in here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2287660","2292220"," you can start to see where the push up is"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2296860","2300860"," somewhere right in here believe it or not"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2300940","2305020"," and let's look at this level here this is possible too"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2305020","2311740"," this is minor a minor support in here let's get this down to close for time"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2311740","2314060"," frame"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2314860","2320940"," you can start to see it right let's get rid of this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2323260","2326300"," this is really what you're looking for right this is starting to become"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2326300","2331660"," easier to see what you're playing here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2337100","2341500"," so let's start from the bearish perspective right we're looking to sell"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2341500","2345020"," every time we hit this blue line we're looking to sell this down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2345020","2349740"," time to get up here you're looking to sell this down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2351180","2355180"," if you want to get bullish then maybe we're going up on IWM"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2355180","2360300"," what you're looking for is your look well before I do that"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2362860","2367420"," we're gonna put that one in you are looking for"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2368620","2374620"," somewhere in here this this would be the bull"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2375660","2381100"," the bull thesis up above here call this the bull thesis"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2386140","2389340"," what you're looking for is this so if you're a bull right you want to be like oh"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2389340","2393660"," we're going to get bullish well the thing you're looking for is"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2393660","2400780"," some sort of over arrest and then up right that's what you're looking for"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2400780","2404940"," no you don't want to play this because there's a good chance that it's going to"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2404940","2408940"," go"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2408940","2416620"," there's a good chance that you're going to go up here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2416620","2420860"," and head down there's not really a lot of skin in this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2420860","2425660"," you know you really want to see us get through here"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2425660","2431340"," and then grab this and go because typically you can actually come down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2431340","2435420"," over this and come back down you're looking for a rest on some form of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2435420","2444860"," support for a move higher so right now I'm not buying into a bullish"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2444860","2449340"," I'm bearish on IWM but no way in hell am I opening"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2452300","2457660"," no way in hell am I opening a position any position nothing neutral"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2458380","2462460"," nothing bearish and nothing bullish although this is bearish definitely"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2463180","2468620"," I would be waiting for IWM to see what it's going to do"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2468620","2472460"," is going to come up for a liquidity grab and then take a bearish position"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2472460","2475820"," as I come over here and start to bounce around for a push-up"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2475820","2480380"," then I'd go long and if this just keeps going down"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2480380","2483900"," I will take a bearish position if they come down bounce back up in here and"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2483900","2487020"," then head lower right the time to take a bearish position in the"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2487020","2493580"," IWM was on the 10th at 1 30 in the way at 1 or 2 is at 1"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2493580","2496780"," by 1 30 in the afternoon you should have taken this bearish position"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2496780","2499500"," and you could have actually held this bearish position in my view"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2500540","2505020"," until prove it otherwise heading down to my price target of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2505020","2510860"," 209 and I think I even put that on an earlier video that I was bearish on"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2511820","2516860"," IWM in the middle of September and that I would get more bearish on"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2517260","2521980"," the spy and the cues heading into October and that you would see"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2522940","2528140"," towards the end of September IWM become bullish into October"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2528140","2533180"," you'll see IWM fall before you see spy and the cues fall"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2533180","2538940"," and you'll see IWM recover or you see the spy and the cues of"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2538940","2543500"," the recover and so far this is playing out across all three indexes nothing's changed"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2544300","2547740"," so anyways we're going to look at a couple more things here"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2564540","2570380"," here with Tesla with you being a bull if you're a bull you know where the"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2570460","2576220"," buy zones are you know you know where the we're at take risk you know where"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2579660","2583980"," to start taking on risk I tell this to bulls and bears no matter what we're doing right"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2585100","2592220"," yes you might miss one huge 100 point rip on Tesla but you would have made so much more on"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2592220","2599820"," this run this goes back to March by buying this is these zones it was ridiculous this thing this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2599820","2605020"," is the Tesla's been a printing machine since March and if you're a new bull"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2606460","2611820"," during this time period if you had just played all these rips and then bought stock on the dips"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2611820","2617500"," and more calls you should be at a point at that at this point where you could start selling"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2619020","2627100"," outside the money calls on Tesla another thing to be aware of is that Kathy Woods whether you"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2627100","2630300"," want to hear this or not and more in lots of other people"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2646460","2651340"," longtime Tesla bulls that know or you know that Kathy's selling out of her Tesla position"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2652060","2658140"," that's just gonna buy back in her Tesla position right after OpEx and what's hilarious about this"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2658140","2663180"," is that every time she does this there are all these articles that come out afterwards and they"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2663180","2671500"," say oh look she bought XYZ stock and it's still falling she doesn't care the reason she doesn't"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2671500","2677980"," care is because she's selling out of these lawns here and as as this negative news is coming out"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2678700","2684780"," she's able to buy dirt cheap down here right and ride this up for the next quarter"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2685740","2692940"," she might be taking longs here to ride up not into let's say December but to ride up into"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2693660","2702380"," March or even May of next year so keep that in mind I do see Tesla still getting to 800 and 1,000"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2702380","2707980"," this year and I do see Kathy Woods going long here but she certainly doesn't she's been long"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2723900","2731820"," Woods got long at 552 or at 736 this is a time or 768 I think right so this is a time for her to"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2731820","2737020"," shave some of her position she probably leaves part of her position in and she's looking to get"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2737020","2742700"," some liquidity down here from the next run up so start to keep or consider that as we move forward"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2743820","2747900"," you shouldn't be there shouldn't I've been making these videos I've been on putter long enough"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2748700","2754540"," for any of you any of you that have been following me that you should I should have made you into"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2766860","2773100"," should be in the red at this point okay so if you're a bull you're going to be looking for"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2774540","2783340"," a continued downward movement in Tesla you can day trade it if you'd like but if it was me"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2815340","2822540"," adding risk on as we head down here to this first support major support down here at 704"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2822540","2827580"," you can put some call spreads on right now that expire in December and you really won't"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2827580","2833020"," care if we swing down right you're really not going to care much heading into let's say December"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2833020","2841020"," 31st or 15 or whatever if you're impatient you can but Tesla doesn't trade like it used to trade"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2841180","2847180"," trades like it's a part of like it's a part of the spy like it's part of an index it's growing up"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2847180","2854380"," slightly it's going to even have another period down the road you know to think that Tesla's not"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2854380","2861100"," going to hit a thousand or 1200 or 1500 or 2000 or 3000 and not have another year where it comes"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2861100","2868140"," down is just implied it's insane so when you're a Tesla investor and a Tesla believer there are"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2868140","2872700"," times when you buy Tesla and there are times when you go long in Tesla and there's times where"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2879500","2886460"," and I've said this on Tuesday Monday Tuesday's video I told you I'm not taking any longs in Tesla"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2886460","2896140"," until 704 or 695 and even as low as 655 this is where I start throwing risk on in Tesla"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2896620","2902380"," can you day trade Tesla yes can you take risk on in Tesla at any time in the glep 100 points"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2902380","2909100"," yes and I never short Tesla I'm not that guy I have a philosophical reason I don't do it"

"Eusprf1wXKA","2929580","2933260"," and I think Tesla's wrapped up with the government I don't think I know that they are"
"Eusprf1wXKA","2933260","2939980"," so we're Elon Musk is so and Tesla boring you know it's like the boring company everybody"
