"r_2iH7PoPPI","9280","10280"," apocalypse."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","10280","14400"," I just wanted to make a quick note, I had someone come in my feed and Twitter and get"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","14400","19680"," upset with me for saying suck at bears."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","19680","23440"," I don't want you, if you're a bear, I don't want you to think that I hate bears, that"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","23440","27480"," I'm a bull full time, I do want you to know that I switch back and forth between being"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","27480","36360"," a bull and a bear and the joke was probably out of not tasteful or hurt some feelings."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","36360","41160"," So if I hurt your feelings today, I apologize."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","41160","45000"," I'm not a bull or a bear, I want all of you to know that, that I do switch back and forth"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","45000","46800"," between bull and bear."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","46800","52240"," I hurt bull's feelings just as much as I hurt bears' failings."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","52240","60160"," I'm here not to make friends with bulls or bears, I'm here to trade and I know that's"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","60160","65360"," going to hurt people's failings when they time their trades wrong."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","65360","73400"," So I'm hoping that by posting these daily briefs, the videos that I post on YouTube,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","73400","80240"," that you all become better traders, so I'm not here to fuck over a bear or fuck over"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","80240","82800"," a bull or anything like that."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","82800","88600"," I want you guys to understand that, the reason that I post this stuff is so that you become"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","88600","89600"," a better trader."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","89600","93960"," If you're a bull, that you understand how to time the markets, if you're a bear, that"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","93960","99960"," you know how to understand the markets, I could care less if you're a bull or a bear."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","99960","101960"," So I just need to get that out of the way."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","101960","106720"," I am going to cut the video short this morning as I did spend some time making one earlier"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","106720","114000"," tonight and I had some technical difficulties, so we're going to get right into it, okay?"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","114000","118160"," This is your daily brief for Monday, August 2nd."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","118160","123480"," We have a big economic calendar week coming up, the volatility gang is banking on it,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","123480","128080"," but the real numbers that you're going to be looking for are going to be on Friday."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","128080","132280"," Friday we've got, I believe, farm payroll and unemployment."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","132280","134960"," Those are the two that the banks are going to be looking for."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","134960","138720"," The rest of the numbers this week will probably miss on."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","138720","144040"," Unless they become material, I think it'll add some volatility to the market, but I really"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","144040","147960"," do doubt that it's going to drop the market."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","147960","153000"," What you really want to be looking for is unemployment on Friday and farm payroll."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","153000","159680"," As far as that, our infrastructure deal goes, it is intended to keep the market afloat."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","159680","164240"," It is a part of what I was thinking about Friday or Thursday."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","164240","169520"," When we lost that bid in the market, that to me looked like a manufactured drop in"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","169520","173600"," the market, intended to drop it."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","173600","178800"," It was artificial, and then the bid was put back into the market on Friday and the end"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","178800","181240"," of day Friday for trading today."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","181240","185560"," I think that had to do with the infrastructure deal, whether it was actually dead or not,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","185560","190800"," and it was probably a nod or a push towards the Senate to keep it alive, to keep this"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","190800","192320"," market alive."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","192320","196720"," That really was corporate America telling the Senate to get something done."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","196720","200800"," Keep that in mind as well as the week progresses."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","200800","204760"," As I always say, especially right now, if you are a bull, this is not the time to be long"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","204760","205760"," in this market."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","205760","208320"," This is the time for you to be cash."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","208320","216680"," You can go long day trading, but we are coming into what looks like a correction of some kind."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","216680","217680"," We may not correct."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","217680","222760"," We may jump up to a new trading zone up here, and I'll put my cursor on and you can look"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","222760","223760"," up here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","223760","224760"," We could jump up here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","224760","227480"," We did in 2020."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","227480","234280"," People that I respect have brought up that we didn't in 2019, but we didn't have quantitative"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","234280","239320"," easing in its form today that we did in 2019."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","239320","244560"," That was quantitative easing since 0708."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","244560","248840"," His share in last year specifically, the money is still turned on, whether we want"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","248840","251360"," to admit that or not."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","251360","257680"," Also we had a dip already in July where we did not have one in July in 2019."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","257680","263000"," Now, do I still think we're going to dip this month more than likely, and even if we don't,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","263000","268560"," it only makes it worse when we do finally get that correction, even if it takes until September."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","268560","272960"," As I've been stating all week long, in the past couple of weeks at least, this is not"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","272960","273960"," time to be going long."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","273960","277200"," This is the time to be waiting to go long for a correction."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","277200","282720"," Now, I'm going to show you the spy, which is what we're taking a look at right here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","282720","287520"," If we're going to bring this into the six month and see if we can come in on this maybe"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","287520","296120"," a little bit more, this is the three month."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","296120","303880"," We'll see a shelf forming over here, and there really is a shelf forming to make a"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","303880","308760"," move up."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","308760","313320"," You can see it right here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","313320","322360"," We've been bound by this channel for the better part of what, five, six trading days."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","322360","330240"," As far as date trading is concerned, I'm bearish below this line, this is 437.71."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","330240","336920"," If we settle in around this 433.96, I'll start going long again, I'll scale into it."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","336920","340840"," If we head back down here, I'm going to go all in, or at least three quarters, two thirds"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","340840","344520"," in front of the ride up for the month of August."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","344520","349800"," If we do bounce off this number though, this 437.71 today, I'm going to look for the banks"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","349800","354120"," to take us through this support and launch us up for the rest of the month of August,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","354120","358960"," especially if the infrastructure bill passes."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","358960","363880"," If it doesn't pass, there's a fair chance two week could also trade sideways in the coming"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","363880","367960"," week and wait for earnings reports."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","367960","373680"," We do have something crazy like 1,500 or 1,600 earnings reports this week."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","373680","379080"," I just don't see us dropping the market at this time."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","379080","383920"," I did post some numbers on Twitter to take a look at."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","383920","397560"," I expected daily range today for SPY is 439.80, 440.72, 441.67 and maybe even attempt at all"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","397560","400520"," time highs at 442.50."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","400520","405880"," Into tomorrow, maybe even pushing tomorrow or Wednesday, if we get that small pullback"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","405880","409680"," to get up and trade into a new channel."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","409680","417440"," The threat is there to move up and the threat is below to move down."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","417440","421200"," If it was me, I would wait for the banks to make the decision for you today."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","421200","422840"," That's all I'll say on SPY at this point."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","422840","425800"," I've made two or three videos over the weekend about this."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","425800","431600"," You can go back into my history, check those out and see how I stand on that stuff."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","431600","437440"," The next chart we're going to look at is going to be NDX, which is also the NASDAQ"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","437440","442560"," and Q. You can transfer this into the Qs."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","442560","448360"," Last week, I was getting very bearish with this top here and this rollover."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","448360","452440"," I was looking for more follow through below 1,400, 1,400."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","452440","458320"," I didn't get that on Friday and actually we caught a bid later in the day."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","459320","461960"," They rethought their position, I think."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","461960","466760"," I don't know if that was a fake out or not, but as of right now and where it stands, this"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","466760","472840"," is a battle zone in here, between 14, 841 and 14897."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","472840","478560"," I think if this catches a bid today, that we're going out big and I think this might"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","478560","485440"," be the most dangerous play, but at the same time could print the best this week for a"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","485440","490440"," weekly call option if you're a bull, because I do think if we win this battle here in"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","490440","498960"," this zone, then we're going to take it up to maybe 1509 or 15159 somewhere up in here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","498960","511120"," 15109 would be just above this level of 15, let's see, 15109 or 159 way up here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","511120","512520"," That's a little bit unrealistic."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","513520","518880"," Let's just say it's there, maybe slightly lower, but I definitely think we can find"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","518880","525400"," a chance to get up to 1,500, 1,500 or 1,500, 1,500, 1,500, 1,500, 1,500, you know what"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","525400","533640"," I mean, but 1,500, 1,100 is on the table, 1,500, 1,500 will be low on this one somewhere"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","533640","534640"," in here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","534640","537800"," I think we might make a move up into this area."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","537800","542120"," I have some, we took some real hits and some big tech last week."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","542120","547200"," I saw our bids coming in, released accumulation phases coming in on some of those tech companies"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","547200","551720"," that were getting hit, getting whacked like Netflix and Amazon, Apple looks like it has"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","551720","556760"," a little more room to go up with just a little bit more, and they tend to bleed off after"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","556760","560880"," earning season over the course of a few months."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","560880","566120"," That coupled with other tech companies that we have earnings on this week gives me the"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","566120","569600"," stuff they might pull back up and pin it again somewhere up in here."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","569600","575880"," Now, there is a lot of downside risk if you get underneath 1,800, if we get underneath"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","575880","586800"," there, we're going to start, I'll start calling out some targets on Twitter today."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","586800","593400"," Moving on to the IWM, in previous videos and on Twitter, I already told you guys that expect"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","593400","598280"," a little bit of sideways movement in here, around 218 and 220, if you can grab any dip"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","598280","599720"," down here, you grab it."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","599720","608360"," We did get a dip down in the 220 range on Friday, I posted about going along here around 209,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","608360","609360"," 210."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","609360","615160"," This is a huge resistance or a support zone from the way back in the past, I rode this"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","615160","623120"," all the way up and I'm still bullish here until 226, 227 somewhere in there."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","623120","630080"," I would look today for a low of 218.08 possibly, but then it's going to rock it up to 223 possibly"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","630080","633160"," even 227.07."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","633160","637880"," My bullishness on IWM only extends to somewhere in here around 226."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","637880","642200"," I don't think it continues on, I think it goes into this hold in wait mode, so you don't"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","642200","645720"," want to be losing the money that you're making after calls once you get there."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","645720","651200"," If I am, IWM gets up there, I'm going to pull out from that 226 position and I think it'll"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","651280","656320"," go sideways for the rest of the week, bouncing around at that volatility and waiting on the"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","656320","660560"," infrastructure plan to decide where we go in this market."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","660560","667120"," Moving on to Tesla, there's a lot going on in Tesla right now, but a few things you need"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","667120","671960"," to understand is that banks picked it up down here, drove it all the way up, and they started"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","671960","676320"," to average down over time, okay, just like this."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","676320","680520"," On May 19th and May 21st, I didn't show you this today, I had it on a previous video,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","680600","682040"," I had some technical difficulties."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","682040","688680"," At any rate, banks did step in to start buying in this area here in this demand zone."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","688680","694720"," Tesla's usually good for a 10% run, which we just did, although we had some calls die"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","694720","698240"," off on Friday that were 700s, right?"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","698240","704320"," So we have 700s and 720s sitting out there for the next week, three weeks."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","704320","706080"," Those might print on Monday."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","706080","710400"," We might get this print up on Monday at 720 right at the open and then come back down"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","710400","713040"," and consolidate again for another run up."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","713040","716200"," We might hit around 800 on that second run."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","716200","721960"," If we don't hit 720 right at the open, I expect us to still fall back right around this 649,"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","721960","727080"," 665 somewhere in here, consolidate for a few days, and then that run would switch from"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","727080","729240"," a 720 to an 800."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","729240","733960"," I do without a doubt see Tesla going to 800 this year, if not 1,000."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","733960","736280"," It does depend upon how this plays out."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","736280","739760"," Also market conditions will impact this move."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","739760","746800"," Even IWM surprisingly, everyone wants to know why and when Tesla moves, you can track"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","746800","748280"," it against IWM."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","748280","752480"," It is highly shorted in smaller indexes."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","752480","759240"," I have posted a few videos on that in the past from some think tank meetings about when"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","759240","760240"," this happens."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","760240","766400"," I'm not going to revisit it this morning as I have those technical difficulties and I"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","766400","768760"," need to get this video out so people can get to it."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","768760","773240"," As far as the fang man stocks, I did a video on those as well."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","773240","776360"," I'm going to try to release that at some point today."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","776360","783280"," Hope you all have a great day trading and don't get your asses blown out."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","783280","784680"," That's the one thing I want you to know."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","784680","786360"," I didn't mean to go off in the beginning of this video."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","786360","792280"," I really want you guys to understand that I'm not here to hurt bears or bulls."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","792280","797760"," I know I'm going to ruffle some feathers or piss some of you off from time to time."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","797760","804160"," I'm sure when you see me switch bearish, you're going to say, what am I watching here?"
"r_2iH7PoPPI","804160","806240"," Just follow along."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","806240","811000"," I hope this helps you to learn how to time your trades, whether you're a bear or a bull."
"r_2iH7PoPPI","811000","812120"," Have a great day guys."
