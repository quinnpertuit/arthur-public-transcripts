"260","1040"," Whoopsie."
"3850","4830"," Start there."
"6630","9570"," What are we gonna do?"
"47870","49330"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"55900","57520"," Yes, take the money and run. "
"60040","66020"," Yes, we'll run up some more, but yeah, you always, always, always take the money and run."
"66860","68040"," Hold on a minute here."
"71260","73600"," Okay, take the money and run. "
"75620","77040"," You renegotiate the trade."
"77420","78820"," You always take the money and run."
"79660","81520"," Then you renegotiate. "
"81860","85120"," So you can go to a higher strike, something like that."
"86360","87540"," That's a good question."
"87800","94020"," I got to switch right into the show this morning because directionally speaking, they're going to"
"94020","94860"," reprice options. "
"95720","98680"," So you take that money and run, you renegotiate a lower price."
"98680","100440"," You don't double down."
"102080","103040"," PCB stick windows. "
"103360","107120"," We have found some links between commercial real estate and mutual funds."
"107680","109600"," You literally take the money and run."
"109820","110960"," Take the money and run on the open. "
"111820","113240"," Let them reprice options."
"113860","116000"," Dealers aren't going to give you a free ride these days."
"117080","118560"," HFTs aren't going to give you a free ride. "
"118880","120220"," Algorithms aren't going to give you a free ride."
"120360","123020"," The days of free rides in the market are over."
"124180","132260"," As a matter of fact, it's a good topic too because a lot of swing trades these days, when they're"
"132260","133580"," in the money, you take it and run. "
"135800","137840"," Because of the violent moves in the market."
"137900","139180"," We'll talk about that this morning."
"140660","144480"," A little conversation about how it used to be and how it is right now. "
"145120","146280"," So we'll talk about that."
"148080","149780"," It's a question of frequency."
"151620","153900"," Not that we don't still have the same sine wave. "
"155140","157040"," It's so compact."
"158360","164000"," Now that we're used to end to the bottom of a channel and wait a week for a monthly or"
"164000","166040"," something or two week, three week call."
"166720","168820"," As soon as that shits the money, you take the money and run. "
"169620","171640"," We used to not be like that, but it's gotten worse."
"172740","173940"," A good question this morning."
"175260","182400"," Always, especially if you're like, especially the S&P 500, if you come into the money in a cash"
"182400","186300"," market or something on an overnight gap up, something like that, you take the money and you"
"186300","187240"," renegotiate the trade. "
"189620","193380"," Even if it's like a weekly or a monthly, the moment you're in the money, you just get it."
"193500","196280"," If you're actually actually in the money, take it and run."
"197680","199320"," So we'll talk about that right now. "
"201320","204800"," We're going to buy in and there's some gaps down below to close."
"206460","207380"," Good morning, David."
"207520","207920"," How are you, brother?"
"209380","218100"," Hey, by the way, I think if you're an admin, or a special moderator or anything like that, show a"
"218100","218960"," two and three job. "
"218960","220740"," You're getting access to the tool this morning."
"220740","221900"," You couldn't get them done yesterday."
"222360","223200"," It's more than it's happening. "
"223460","224520"," So be aware of that."
"226120","233560"," If you want access to the tool and you are a moderator or an admin, get with the admins."
"233940","238780"," I haven't spoken to the admins yet, but they're going to ask you for your trading view handle. "
"240060","242140"," We can get access to it this morning."
"243320","244420"," Good morning, by the way."
"245500","250260"," But yeah, if you're an overnight call holder, take that fucking money and run. "
"250620","251000"," Please."
"253300","257720"," If you think we're going to continue to go up from here, renegotiate the lower strike."
"258000","259320"," Put that in your pocket. "
"260120","262120"," And free trial had to take that."
"262160","263740"," That's a big part of like our."
"263980","269280"," That's a big part of a problem around here is that we do a lot of. "
"269280","271080"," I see a lot of people that."
"271380","271860"," That."
"273760","274580"," Cherry pick. "
"274940","276560"," There's a lot of cherry picking around here like."
"278680","282500"," People won't follow shout outs on stock tickers."
"282500","284380"," Then they didn't buy gas, right?"
"284540","285240"," They didn't buy oil. "
"286700","292360"," And then they take one zero to eight day trade and they blow it up or they win two or"
"292360","292960"," three in a row."
"292960","294060"," They're doubling down."
"295180","297420"," On every trade until they blow it up. "
"297420","300140"," So it's a great question, by the way, this morning."
"300780","302060"," Do you take the money on the gap up?"
"302200","302860"," Yes, you do."
"303400","305740"," You take the money, you renegotiate the trade. "
"306660","310860"," We have to do a whole thing on rules and that stuff because I know it happens a lot around"
"310860","311120"," here."
"312800","317280"," There's a lot of cherry picking that goes on around here and I'm always suspect people will blow up"
"317280","322120"," a trade and they'll be like, I'm hurting and I'm like, let's look at your trades as a whole."
"322880","324640"," And it's not pretty, right?"
"324640","326820"," And the size is not pretty. "
"329020","331280"," DCA and pulling off all that kind of stuff."
"331460","335000"," As a matter of fact, this tool should kind of help you."
"335220","342420"," And as a matter of fact, right now, for all the rules that I've taught you, even this long short"
"342420","345960"," thing here, we're going to go over that at some points, what it means. "
"347440","350900"," And specifically right now, this is a 30 minute chart."
"350900","357960"," If we go to a, as a one minute chart, but if we go to a 30 minute chart, you"
"357960","359340"," know, let me ask you a question."
"359720","362100"," So we're in a 30 minute chart right now. "
"364140","367280"," And take a look at me with me right now."
"367340","367500"," Okay."
"367740","368320"," Take one quick look. "
"368620","373680"," So just looking right here, can it continue to go up?"
"373820","374540"," Yeah, sure can."
"376180","381200"," So if it stays above the one minute trigger, I'll stay long."
"381780","383260"," But where are you getting long?"
"383480","387340"," Are you getting long on velocity where we are right now?"
"388220","390600"," No, this is not the entry point, is it?"
"391600","396380"," You're looking for some negative value, right?"
"396580","398480"," We know that this is positive here. "
"399260","399740"," Supportive."
"401180","404420"," But these down here are not, are not optimum, right?"
"404740","406020"," And optimum always matters."
"406720","409960"," So this is a 30 minute chart that we're looking at right now. "
"410960","416600"," But if we were to go to a one minute chart, if we're to go a one minute chart here,"
"418160","420740"," we are at the bottom of this channel heading higher."
"421380","423280"," This if I can go to a trigger screen here."
"425080","427620"," We are still within trend here. "
"428880","430800"," But let's, let's, let's be honest here."
"430800","432240"," So we're still in trend right here."
"432240","435660"," And you see this one pulling back right now, right?"
"435760","438460"," So one minute's getting a little weak, five minutes getting a little bit weak. "
"438920","440460"," 30 minutes still holding up."
"441640","443980"," But where would you want to buy in here?"
"444500","448920"," You know, you don't have to get every single trade, right?"
"449180","450660"," You don't have to always trade spy."
"451700","456160"," But, you know, if you were given the opportunity to buy down here, you probably would, right?"
"457460","460040"," Just like down here, down here, down here. "
"460040","465760"," Now, if, if price gets above the one empty, sure we can trade that."
"467580","469900"," We can trade that if it does stay above."
"470300","471380"," So we'll look at that right now. "
"473480","474800"," Quick second here."
"477240","478880"," So on this we will chart here."
"479000","480000"," We had PT one yesterday. "
"480320","481680"," We've got PT two today."
"482240","486900"," And then we had that PT three for Friday here."
"487660","490740"," We are still, we are still standing on. "
"493440","495380"," This EMA right here, right?"
"495780","499140"," UK interest rate spots show you more than 60% chance."
"499260","502460"," The Bank of England rate cycle will peak at five spot five percent."
"503500","505380"," Let me pause this for a minute here. "
"508820","510760"," So what would I say here?"
"510980","514919"," I guess we'll be the question here would be if we get above our two."
"517220","520200"," And we successfully defend this white line right here."
"520240","522120"," And you want to take, take a ride up. "
"522360","522940"," I'd say, yeah."
"524740","527080"," But I'd let it open up for a minute too, right?"
"527340","530460"," So if someone's, if someone's selling calls into you right now."
"531400","533140"," And you don't quite know it, right?"
"533300","536580"," You come down here and they're just selling calls into you. "
"536580","537460"," You think we're going up."
"538480","540340"," Calls are being sold into you."
"540960","543160"," And then all of a sudden there's that roll down here. "
"543160","544120"," Fill that gap."
"544660","547780"," You know, you kind of got to, you kind of got to be upset, right?"
"548560","551800"," If you didn't close your calls on the open this morning."
"552060","557120"," Now, one of my rules is if we had not gone up and we actually went down. "
"557540","560300"," And my overnight calls were burning."
"561600","564080"," They're probably screwed, but I will hold them."
"564180","566900"," I won't sell them because they've lost so much on them, right?"
"567640","568700"," Maybe I'll DC am. "
"569060","572020"," Sometimes I'll leave them on, even if we are going to catch the bounce."
"572020","575860"," And just buy a higher strike, right?"
"576100","578340"," So that I can at least catch back up on this bad trade."
"580080","583560"," But when we are printing on the open, always take the money and run. "
"584260","587020"," All of those options are typically reprised."
"588600","594900"," If you, if you back, if you back trade this trade, you're going to win more times than lose if"
"594900","595980"," you take the money on the open."
"595980","597560"," If you're, if you're already green. "
"599520","604500"," I've had more losses inside of this little area here to gap up."
"605400","607060"," Even if we continue higher."
"609140","611500"," So I have like, I have held these on, right?"
"611640","613700"," Let's say, let's say I bought down here at 10 cents. "
"615260","617880"," And these are now 30 cents, right?"
"620100","627040"," Oftentimes, if I don't close them immediately, they will still go back down to like 12 cents, boom,"
"627280","627920"," 12 cents."
"635040","635880"," Inside here."
"640220","643180"," And then still rip higher to point 40 cents. "
"643960","644940"," Let's say, okay."
"646020","650580"," But the fact that we came back down to 12 cents, that, that's annoying, right?"
"650740","652920"," You do all that work to make all that money coming up here."
"654080","659180"," And you're going to, you're going to, you're literally a renegotiating and you're, you're literally"
"659180","663580"," putting your 10 to 30 cents back on the line again. "
"663760","665380"," That's like tripling your, your bet."
"666240","672780"," So why wouldn't you take, you know, put the 10 on take the 30 and then renegotiate for 10 cents"
"672780","674260"," pocket the 20."
"675200","677760"," That gives you three or two more trades, right?"
"679260","680980"," It just sounds bizarre. "
"681300","688340"," So if you're in a winning, if you're taking a winning overnight trade and it pays, take the money,"
"688340","692860"," take it off the bell every single time."
"692880","697140"," Even if you miss out on the upside, gains or gains, right?"
"697920","702600"," And if you were to, let's say you take the money here at 30 cents and we begin to gap"
"702600","707260"," up, you could always immediately jump in on point 10s, right?"
"707520","709760"," For that next gap up here, if you're that committed."
"710460","714160"," And if you're wrong, you're still walking away with 20, with 100% trade, right?"
"714700","715860"," There's 10 cents. "
"717120","718100"," You made 30."
"720280","725140"," And, you know, you're at least, you're at the put more risk on if you wanted to walk away with"
"725140","725820"," 100% trade."
"727740","731620"," Not happy, not as happy as you would have been just taking the 30 and waiting. "
"732200","735480"," You know, but at least you're not walking away at zero."
"737380","739480"," And you at least paying 100% on that trade."
"740020","740420"," You know what I'm saying?"
"740780","741340"," I hope you do. "
"742260","743260"," Good morning, everybody."
"743260","749700"," So we got a gap down here, hourly trigger, 446, 97."
"751320","753000"," We have trend line, right?"
"753780","758280"," Yesterday we said, this is the place to buy dips. "
"759540","767340"," We also said, if we have half an hour closing bars down here, I am a seller, right?"
"768180","771640"," Do we get half an hour closing bars down here?"
"772220","775320"," No, right?"
"775600","778740"," And they ran a stop gap up here, right?"
"781080","784440"," So they're chasing all these stops up here, right?"
"784580","785920"," Chased all of these stops."
"786500","790740"," So we want to look for a dip by more than likely right down here."
"791220","792980"," More than likely right down here. "
"792980","802500"," If we don't come down there and we just recover and start trading higher, we get above this PT or"
"802500","805040"," this R2, we'll take another long, right?"
"806100","807100"," Take another long."
"807360","811900"," Even if we continue higher here, I guarantee you there are re-pricing options in there."
"812500","814040"," There's no free rides on this train. "
"814520","824060"," As a matter of fact, we have to talk about this later, but the CME, had a meeting."
"824600","827460"," I don't know how many of you know about this, but they had a meeting."
"829340","831820"," Oh, I want to say three or four weeks ago. "
"835810","838690"," It was like a summit."
"840450","844150"," I'm going to assume that order flow sellers were there."
"844430","849670"," I'm going to assume they were there in the back of the room or something, but there was a big"
"849670","856590"," discussion on the rise of retail traders and the use of zero dates. "
"857490","865870"," So I'm going to doubt right away, especially knowing, I don't know how much you guys know, but JPM,"
"866370","876270"," GS, bunch of banks saying they're using AI now, or at least LLMs. And then you had the Fed come"
"876270","880390"," out maybe six months ago, three months ago or something."
"881210","886590"," And they said they were using AI to their advantage to gauge sentiment on Fintuit. "
"887410","896250"," They actually were scanning for specific archaic terminology from professionals, non archaic"
"896250","903090"," terminology from retailers, and basing policy around the sentiment from Fintuit."
"904150","910410"," So when you get told that from banks are telling you they're using high frequency trading now with"
"910410","920410"," AI, you get the Fed using the same techniques admittedly, and then you get the CMO coming out"
"920410","923370"," and saying, hey, we're having meetings about these these day traders."
"924090","930630"," I'm going to assure you that or what I've noticed recently is I know that some of it's that balls"
"930630","936530"," crushed, but I've noticed recently that it's been becoming harder to trade zero dates, probably the"
"936530","937890"," last three, four weeks. "
"938370","941890"," And that was right after that meeting or the knowledge of that meeting dropped."
"942110","948950"," So if there was a point point at time to take the money on a zero date overnight hold, it's"
"948950","950910"," probably right right now from this point forward."
"952610","955930"," We'll have one more quick, quick note on this topic. "
"956930","958410"," And I've used to discuss this."
"960110","966010"," I used to discuss this about the stock market and the rise of high frequency trading."
"967050","971030"," You used to be able to buy a call or a put doesn't matter. "
"971030","980390"," And the market would follow some kind of a normal track in price."
"982290","986630"," This would be like the price going up or the price going down."
"988170","989870"," It was a little bit more normal. "
"990810","992390"," It had like a flow to things."
"993150","997890"," And this was even maybe seven or eight years ago, ten years ago."
"999470","1004970"," You could, you could like, you could like enter a put and come back. "
"1006830","1011090"," You know, in like a week or two, you'd like buy a monthly put, come back in two weeks and"
"1011090","1012170"," your puts would be in the money."
"1013510","1014950"," And you'd be happy camper."
"1015050","1015690"," You'd close them up. "
"1015950","1016350"," Same calls."
"1017730","1019190"," You know what it's like these days?"
"1020330","1022230"," We've got, they've got these little gremlins."
"1022230","1027290"," And what they're doing is they're coming in and they're just destroying. "
"1028790","1030950"," The entire trip up and down."
"1031270","1034130"," So the what by the time you get to where you want to go."
"1035670","1037569"," You're not getting paid, right?"
"1037770","1043069"," You're like in here and all these options have just been juiced. "
"1043810","1046569"," You know, so this is much harder to trade."
"1047650","1049570"," Then this ever was, right?"
"1049770","1050870"," This, this nice smooth."
"1053050","1053930"," Track, right?"
"1054110","1056290"," That we're juicing every move these days. "
"1056930","1060530"," I noticed now that if I trade, if I ever trade a monthly."
"1061710","1066910"," I can, those things can print in like a day, sometimes two days, three days or whatever I wanted"
"1066910","1067450"," out of them."
"1067690","1073690"," What I thought would take a week or two can sometimes take one, two days and they go right back"
"1073690","1076210"," down to the depths of hell. "
"1076210","1079330"," And then I got to wait for one more of those big giant swings higher."
"1085150","1086810"," So it's still holding right now."
"1087130","1089430"," You know where I want to buy down here, this HT. "
"1090670","1092070"," You know where the pivot is."
"1092150","1093510"," You know where trend is down here."
"1094390","1096950"," We're going to look at the trigger really quick. "
"1098870","1101350"," We're going to go to the 30 minute timeframe here."
"1106130","1108890"," You can see a nice little roll happening up here."
"1110270","1111310"," You got to love it. "
"1111890","1113750"," Let's also look down here, right?"
"1114090","1115890"," We're in an uptrend out of 30 minute."
"1116390","1117970"," I want you to pay attention to two things."
"1118230","1120190"," See how it's written right here, bear plane. "
"1121230","1123910"," See how this one is written right here, bull plane."
"1124830","1126830"," This was the bear trap right here."
"1127170","1128050"," That was the bear trap. "
"1128290","1128910"," If you didn't know it."
"1129530","1132550"," Right there was the bear, right here was the bear trap right there."
"1133230","1139310"," You got the bear plane right down there and they immediately turn it back into a bull plane. "
"1139310","1145530"," And you know what's crazy about this right here is this happens very infrequently."
"1146490","1147690"," Very infrequently."
"1149170","1151370"," And let's talk about this. "
"1152970","1156270"," I'm not going to draw all that out, but let me show you something here."
"1156390","1157750"," Something important that I want you to see."
"1161080","1166400"," So you can see that it's written right here, right, bear plane, bull plane, right?"
"1167340","1168900"," How quickly this happened. "
"1169320","1175600"," So the bear trap actually happened way back here on the ninth."
"1176580","1178060"," That's where the bear trap was."
"1178620","1180500"," You might not know that, but that's where it happened. "
"1180740","1182740"," We're in a bull plane right now going to the upside."
"1183540","1188740"," You guys want to know how long those last usually usually for a pretty decent move."
"1190540","1192780"," Usually a pretty decent move back here. "
"1192780","1194840"," This one was a huge move to the upside, right?"
"1196980","1198020"," Four fifty three."
"1200020","1201720"," We got a bull and a bear plane."
"1201860","1203540"," This was a trap for the bulls right here. "
"1203700","1206160"," This is actually what I came up here."
"1206920","1209740"," But you can see the bull bear plane right there is another one."
"1210900","1215220"," And you can actually see the last one that took place was way down here. "
"1216060","1217060"," Way, way, way."
"1217260","1218380"," There it is right back there."
"1218380","1221680"," Back in May, May 4th to be exact. "
"1222480","1225360"," So we are right now in a bull plane."
"1226080","1227340"," So we are bullish."
"1228240","1229400"," See it right there?"
"1230800","1234540"," We are in a bull plane and we're looking for a place to buy a dip. "
"1235040","1238920"," So if there was a place to buy a dip on this trend up."
"1239900","1242300"," This up trend that we're in."
"1243720","1245500"," We got one right there. "
"1245500","1247380"," We got one right there."
"1247580","1248720"," Where would you want to buy this one?"
"1249520","1251200"," Somewhere down here if you could, right?"
"1251620","1253100"," Right up there and trade that."
"1254620","1261640"," So what are we looking at down there to buy if possible unless we get above the one minute trigger,"
"1261640","1262340"," right?"
"1263080","1265760"," Let's take a closer look there and just take a peek and see. "
"1272020","1279060"," So worst case to not worst case but right around horse shoes and hand grenades we've got four forty"
"1279060","1280140"," six fifty eight."
"1282220","1287500"," So four forty six fifty eight should be the deepest that we go."
"1289500","1291560"," And where does that put us right here?"
"1292960","1297300"," Four forty six fifty eight right here. "
"1298280","1300820"," So they're telling you worst case scenario."
"1301900","1303940"," Try to buy that one right there."
"1303940","1304440"," See that?"
"1304980","1309980"," So here it is right down here four forty six fifty eight right by the pivot. "
"1310600","1313500"," HT would be your first area of interest."
"1314960","1317660"," Right hopefully if you were listening this broadcast."
"1318840","1322560"," When I first came on this morning you took the money and you ran. "
"1323580","1326500"," So right down here you're going to look to fill this gap if you can."
"1327340","1332560"," Right first area of interest I should say is right in here."
"1333160","1337940"," Second area of interest right there third area of interest right in here. "
"1338080","1343300"," So if you're a bull that's what you're trying to buy and you know not to buy that stuff."
"1344080","1346480"," Right you know not to buy that stuff."
"1348680","1350260"," Until what happens. "
"1353080","1358400"," Until that white line comes back down and gets underneath it right."
"1358400","1364140"," And this turns back into a buy zone right."
"1366220","1367320"," You know I'm saying. "
"1368760","1371300"," So just be very conscious of this."
"1372320","1374620"," When this happens whether this happens."
"1376820","1379400"," Here here or here. "
"1380140","1381640"," That's when you get long okay."
"1382320","1385220"," That's when you put risk on into the market so right now."
"1385220","1389400"," Do you have are you trying to buy a dip right now everybody in chat should say. "
"1390020","1391040"," No captain."
"1392320","1392900"," No."
"1393900","1395900"," I'm not trying to buy a dip captain. "
"1397180","1398520"," Not at the moment."
"1402930","1404840"," That's right say that in the chat."
"1405300","1408080"," No captain not right now I'm waiting captain. "
"1410660","1411960"," Bear town sheriff."
"1414020","1416780"," He's like yes yes start buying dips right now."
"1419580","1421160"," Feed my puts. "
"1426980","1430700"," If you're a bear out there I've got the inverted big shape recovery."
"1431780","1437500"," Invert the inverted the upside down V shape recovery right now for bears."
"1442920","1443880"," No man. "
"1448680","1449940"," So right down here."
"1450200","1455400"," So I just got someone said I just got murdered last week buying HT and DT."
"1455720","1456180"," Let's look at that. "
"1456400","1457680"," Let's see if that's true or not."
"1458240","1460920"," Let's find out if that's a real statement or a fake statement."
"1462240","1463400"," Looks fake to me. "
"1464060","1467080"," I mean like this isn't rocket science here is it."
"1467280","1468880"," Let's take a look at rocket science here."
"1470100","1472940"," Nice big negative fellow down here. "
"1473120","1473620"," What do you do?"
"1474340","1475740"," You buy the dip."
"1476920","1479300"," Nice big right here dip."
"1479540","1479980"," What do you do?"
"1480520","1481520"," You buy the dip. "
"1482240","1483800"," What are we looking for over here."
"1484740","1485820"," Same shit right."
"1486460","1488720"," Looking for that same shit over there aren't we. "
"1490100","1492840"," Look at that same shit to buy the dip."
"1493060","1493980"," Are we there right now?"
"1494360","1494500"," No."
"1495920","1497680"," No we're not there right now. "
"1497680","1499440"," We can see when we are there right."
"1499660","1500120"," There's one."
"1500620","1501280"," There's two. "
"1501700","1504120"," And now we're looking for that next one over there right."
"1506060","1506580"," No."
"1510600","1514180"," So let's keep an eye on this this morning and we'll see. "
"1515340","1519360"," We'll see if we can buy a dip in the market."
"1521800","1524740"," We go to a one minute chart here on spy."
"1529400","1531460"," Sitting right now on trend. "
"1532520","1533680"," I'm going to leave it."
"1533880","1535740"," I'm going to leave this up for you this morning."
"1537040","1539960"," Right down here and you're going to see the cross right now. "
"1540440","1542920"," You'll see this positioning switch to short."
"1544460","1545840"," Here in just a moment."
"1546580","1547660"," They're just looking for. "
"1548460","1550000"," For this here to go down."
"1551540","1552920"," There's looking for rejection."
"1555460","1557380"," On four forty eight fifty. "
"1558560","1559820"," To go down."
"1560120","1560800"," So main screen."
"1561700","1564200"," Keep your eyes right here on the bottom. "
"1565080","1565600"," By the way."
"1565820","1569780"," I think our swim is down for me this morning."
"1569780","1571120"," So we've got no think or swim. "
"1571340","1572280"," But right down here."
"1573000","1574260"," Watch right down there."
"1575320","1578500"," We want to see if the bears can get this. "
"1578760","1580100"," Now watch me closely down here."
"1580160","1580820"," Let me get back on this."
"1580820","1581920"," We will start. "
"1582600","1584900"," Let's pay attention to this right here really quick."
"1585240","1586580"," So watch this right now."
"1587360","1589100"," These sellers. "
"1590500","1592260"," Are trying to confirm."
"1593040","1594400"," A move down."
"1594820","1595020"," Right. "
"1596840","1597780"," Hear me."
"1597960","1599220"," Let me make that red."
"1600520","1604400"," These sellers are looking for a reversal candle here. "
"1604840","1606400"," To sell this down."
"1606400","1608080"," Now if."
"1609800","1611640"," They cannot do that. "
"1611640","1613160"," There's a five minute chart by the way."
"1613800","1615220"," If they cannot do that."
"1615720","1618640"," You'll see a five minute bar right here right. "
"1619260","1621900"," You'll see a five minute bar right here."
"1622840","1624560"," You'll see a."
"1625640","1628560"," Rejection candle here more than likely."
"1629340","1630040"," Right. "
"1632830","1635330"," You'll see this reverse to the upside."
"1635330","1641590"," And then you can take that trade to the upside here."
"1644490","1645090"," Okay. "
"1645250","1646250"," And you're going to look for."
"1647230","1648910"," Four forty nine sixty."
"1650090","1650530"," Next. "
"1650830","1651870"," So pay attention to this."
"1652410","1653250"," Right here as well."
"1653410","1654590"," Keep your eyes on this. "
"1655590","1658990"," Notice how the bulls are actually buying this back right now."
"1659470","1660910"," Not what a bear wants to see."
"1661150","1661250"," Right. "
"1666710","1668170"," So pay attention to this right here."
"1669570","1671590"," Throw another target right up here."
"1675550","1678170"," Watch these sellers get overrun right now. "
"1680350","1682090"," Pay attention to this R2."
"1693220","1694380"," That was already hit."
"1699300","1701140"," There goes your candle right now. "
"1701340","1704560"," Just watch confirmation that we're going to go higher and do an explosive move up."
"1726560","1730180"," Just waiting for this confirmation right here on that right here."
"1730300","1732680"," I'm waiting for this one small confirmation right here. "
"1734920","1736260"," That's actually going to hold."
"1739240","1742500"," And if that holds that means the buyers are here."
"1742720","1743860"," So we're going to find out right now. "
"1743960","1745700"," We're going to confirm it right now if they are here."
"1751350","1753930"," You want to see what I'm talking about here."
"1754050","1754490"," I'll show you. "
"1773350","1773850"," Patience."
"1775290","1776470"," No longs yet."
"1780820","1782400"," They still have the chance. "
"1783680","1786020"," Still have the chance to squeeze this down."
"1786220","1786300"," So."
"1788140","1789340"," Or to send it down. "
"1789500","1789940"," I should say."
"1791860","1797160"," I can't believe they got Dixie up over a hundred dollar five right now."
"1799000","1802560"," You know what else is funny is H.Y.G. will take a look at that. "
"1804040","1804600"," Apple."
"1805500","1807800"," Looking extremely bullish right now."
"1807940","1810440"," If you are watching, keep your eyes on Apple. "
"1810640","1812220"," There's some rotation into it right now."
"1815500","1820500"," Apple needs to get over one seventy five thirty target to the upside one seventy eight ninety six."
"1825510","1828950"," Don't forget that one eighty target we talked about into Friday. "
"1829930","1834410"," Apple zero to eight Friday one eighty has been destroyed."
"1834410","1843190"," And the following the following strike on Apple that one eighty for the for next next the expiry."
"1844130","1845970"," Should get some love at some point. "
"1846130","1849030"," They had like they had like a quarter million calls on one eighty."
"1849690","1853090"," For the Apple events and they've been they've been routed."
"1854990","1856490"," They have been routed dealers. "
"1856750","1857010"," Don't care."
"1857130","1857850"," They took all your money."
"1857890","1860610"," So wherever they run that they run that one eighty into Friday. "
"1865870","1867830"," Tessa with a dip by right now too."
"1869130","1871830"," H.Y.G. coming back down to close some gapage."
"1873850","1876010"," Still no trade here still no trade. "
"1882330","1888000"," Let's watch this trigger screen right here."
"1889340","1896780"," I wonder if I can do like a side by side."
"1903870","1906130"," Patience pulls always pays. "
"1908410","1910670"," Always pays bulls just be patient."
"1919660","1922200"," No confirmation bounce right now."
"1925440","1927560"," Still being rolled to the downside. "
"1933430","1936890"," Patience bulls we bring this over so you can see it."
"1937590","1944810"," I wonder if I can just mute this me a second here."
"1945890","1947630"," I just mute this. "
"1950650","1951610"," I mute."
"1953110","1954130"," Book map maybe."
"1955290","1956750"," Oh, do that works for today. "
"1957590","1958550"," Works just fine."
"1960730","1961650"," There we go."
"1962130","1962850"," That over there. "
"1965050","1967950"," That's much better for today as the book map is dead so."
"1969730","1970650"," Oh, that's right."
"1970890","1973090"," You would have been caught in that bad boy right there, right?"
"1973090","1975490"," You didn't check the confirmation bounce to go higher. "
"1977450","1979470"," It would have been in some trouble here, wouldn't you?"
"1980550","1982170"," Let that shit breathe."
"1994520","1997640"," See, this wasn't no confirmation bounce, right?"
"1997960","2000560"," This candle did not get that green bar, did it?"
"2001940","2004720"," Trade it up, right?"
"2005300","2009520"," No bounce off this red candle so you didn't get the green bar right here, right?"
"2010200","2011620"," No green bar right here."
"2011620","2012740"," No trade for you, right?"
"2012940","2013700"," No trade to the upside?"
"2014580","2015880"," Which way are we going right now?"
"2016020","2017020"," We're going short, right?"
"2017780","2019520"," What does it say up here?"
"2021860","2023640"," What does that say right there?"
"2025160","2027040"," Confirmed to be short, right?"
"2028780","2031560"," Do you have a long on when you see that flip to red?"
"2032080","2032480"," Book no. "
"2035420","2036940"," Book no you don't."
"2038320","2041140"," Let's watch how this resolves itself right here."
"2065810","2066469"," Who's Mary?"
"2074800","2076139"," Who's Mary, by the way?"
"2077239","2078400"," Hey Mary, what's going on?"
"2078699","2079380"," What's Mary, are you?"
"2079900","2080719"," I know a few Mary's. "
"2082880","2083900"," Hold on a second here."
"2088900","2090179"," Hi Mary, who are you?"
"2093790","2096970"," Sorry, I know Mary's, I just want to make sure I get the right Mary."
"2101350","2104650"," Let me check my thing here, who's commenting in the chat right now?"
"2105750","2106990"," Let's see who's in the chat. "
"2107150","2108330"," I haven't changed anything."
"2110490","2112350"," Oh, is that Mary the landscaper?"
"2117150","2118830"," It's Mary the landscaper."
"2121770","2122630"," Too funny. "
"2124370","2125370"," Chris the plumber."
"2125630","2126650"," Yeah, we have Chris the plumber."
"2127010","2129050"," We got Bob the stapler guy in the basement. "
"2130010","2132890"," Are those Mary the landscaper, right?"
"2133030","2134090"," We got Mary the landscaper."
"2135770","2137290"," We got Main Street, Bob."
"2137510","2138650"," He works in the basement. "
"2152550","2153430"," Too funny."
"2153430","2153930"," Too funny."
"2154470","2155850"," What up, Basra?"
"2159940","2163860"," Yeah, no, we'll do is we'll leave the, we'll leave the chat open this morning. "
"2165220","2166860"," We'll leave the chat open this morning."
"2167060","2167740"," See how that goes."
"2169380","2169780"," Yeah. "
"2172880","2174080"," And I gotcha."
"2174820","2175680"," Now I gotcha."
"2175780","2176300"," I'm like, who's Mary?"
"2176520","2177120"," I'm like, which Mary?"
"2178060","2179320"," Which Mary are we talking about here?"
"2179840","2181020"," Mary the landscaper though. "
"2181160","2181920"," We know who she is."
"2184700","2190180"," Jerome still, that's why whatever I hear Jerome say, whatever I hear Jerome say, hire for longer."
"2190400","2191220"," I'm like, it's because of Mary. "
"2191540","2192400"," It's because of Mary."
"2193060","2195680"," They might not have to raise rates, but they got to keep behind us and they might not have to"
"2195680","2197820"," let Mary's law a lot more breaks down."
"2199260","2206920"," And she's either taken like a 30% a 30% loan on a credit card. "
"2208140","2209760"," Or she doesn't qualify anymore."
"2209920","2211840"," One of the other with the, with the tightening."
"2216040","2217800"," Is that Mr. Garrison, by the way?"
"2220400","2222560"," That's what that's what I always think about. "
"2222560","2230260"," Any guys out there have any guys out there have an AMX card with Sky Club with Delta?"
"2230600","2231420"," Any guys get that?"
"2231600","2233700"," All that shit about Delta Airlines and AMX?"
"2236480","2241600"," I'm kind of like one of my favorite, like one of the best deals I've ever had."
"2241600","2242060"," Not best."
"2242480","2243120"," Like top 20. "
"2245080","2249580"," Was Delta Sky Lounge or Sky Club or whatever that gets called."
"2250780","2254560"," They don't have them everywhere, but they were such a sweet deal."
"2254860","2259040"," Like get some food, chill out, wash your face, get a drink. "
"2259340","2264200"," They're not the best bar in the world, but at least it's an open free bar included."
"2264820","2270540"," I was, I haven't been to a Sky Club in at least pre-COVID, but I used to go all"
"2270540","2270900"," the time."
"2271100","2271940"," I went pre-COVID. "
"2272100","2279540"," I was like fucking going everywhere and post COVID here and there, but I don't use the the or the"
"2279540","2280600"," Sky Club at all."
"2283380","2287780"," Yeah, San Francisco too, man has a great launch too."
"2289660","2291500"," But they just changed everything. "
"2292560","2296080"," Like yesterday, they're basically telling you to go F yourself."
"2300820","2303980"," Oh, yeah, baby, look at that blood down there."
"2305040","2306120"," What do you think about that?"
"2306280","2307680"," What do you think about this right here?"
"2308600","2311000"," Is that, is that, is that clear enough for you?"
"2311660","2313880"," Is that, is that working for you right there?"
"2314240","2315880"," Let me know in the chat if you like that. "
"2319880","2324580"," It's not like that anymore."
"2324960","2327340"," Like everybody uses it now."
"2328080","2329360"," And you know what really sucks?"
"2330460","2335900"," I shouldn't, I shouldn't say this, but if you live, so I've got a wife and kids. "
"2335900","2336900"," I can't do this."
"2337160","2339300"," I don't, it's just too much of a pain in the ass."
"2339760","2347980"," If you're single, right, if you're a single person and you live near a hub, a big flight hub where"
"2347980","2354880"," there's lots of pilots and flight attendants, all that kind of stuff, like based out of a big hub"
"2354880","2364440"," like Midway, believe it or not, Detroit, you can actually go on like Facebook or Craigslist and"
"2364440","2371000"," request, I don't know if this still works, but it was working up to about a pre-COVID. "
"2371380","2379600"," I can't vouch for it right now, but you can go on to like the internets."
"2380900","2389360"," If I was single, you can go on to the series of tubes and you can post an ad and"
"2389360","2392440"," say, I want a companion ticket."
"2393320","2398320"," And people will charge you anywhere, roughly, it used to be about $13 to $1,500. "
"2399800","2405140"," Then you can fly anywhere you want in the continental United States for free, whenever you want for"
"2405140","2405820"," a full year."
"2406940","2410420"," And it's $25 for international flights."
"2411540","2413880"," But you have to, these people have to trust you. "
"2415180","2417460"," They have like, they have to supposedly, they're supposed to be family members."
"2418600","2421820"," But you pay them and they give you their companion pass for a year."
"2421820","2425360"," Probably shouldn't be talking about that because I think that's probably highly illegal. "
"2426480","2432400"," Squeezing up right now off of the close to the half hour trigger in the channel."
"2434000","2443200"," Bear is looking for a confirmation for more downside off of 448.43. We don't see the one minute."
"2443940","2445220"," This looks pretty good. "
"2445280","2446220"," This looks pretty good."
"2446440","2446740"," Pretty good."
"2446900","2449360"," Let's switch over to the 30 minute and see though if we're ready. "
"2450120","2452000"," And how do we know if we're ready?"
"2453480","2457140"," So this is what I use and this is what I recommend."
"2458720","2462640"," I always like to come back to at least the zero line."
"2464400","2467000"," On Velo, we're not quite there yet. "
"2467120","2469600"," We're at 19, 14, 27."
"2470860","2473840"," I'd at least like to see zero or under."
"2474860","2476720"," So we're not quite there yet. "
"2478440","2479640"," We're not, we're not there."
"2480020","2482380"," So now let's look at this."
"2482620","2483180"," Oh, hold on. "
"2485800","2492930"," If, if this holds."
"2494810","2496570"," And resolves itself."
"2499800","2503260"," We can take along here, but what has to happen?"
"2503560","2506420"," So like, let's like, what has to happen?"
"2506560","2508120"," We need to have that cross, right?"
"2509720","2514120"," If you get that cross and not only do you need the cross, but you need the confirmation. "
"2514480","2516220"," Remember that confirmation."
"2517080","2520020"," So you would need to see price go higher here."
"2521860","2523380"," Come back down, right?"
"2523680","2524560"," Fail right there. "
"2525640","2527020"," Or even right here."
"2527780","2528740"," Or even right here."
"2528880","2529680"," I really don't care. "
"2530340","2532240"," But you still have to have price fail."
"2533180","2535720"," You have to have price come back down and test."
"2537160","2538000"," Right here. "
"2538680","2541900"," And then begin to get bought, right?"
"2542180","2546000"," Needs to start to come up for you to enter."
"2546240","2547340"," So you set the trade up."
"2547700","2549700"," If it presents itself here. "
"2550420","2553760"," If it presents itself, you set the trade."
"2553820","2555240"," And if they start to buy it."
"2555960","2556600"," You're good to go. "
"2556900","2562540"," I usually prefer for us to at least make a new high on this check up here."
"2562540","2564420"," I always like to see the tip."
"2564700","2567580"," Just the tip get up there and come back down. "
"2568040","2570560"," I don't like to see any kind of failure down in here."
"2570640","2571640"," Failure to get the new high."
"2571820","2574700"," Remember I talked to you guys all the time about new high, right?"
"2574980","2577160"," So if you're looking for a dip by here. "
"2578520","2584020"," Not only are you looking for the squeeze up, but you're looking for the tip."
"2585040","2586500"," Get the new high, right?"
"2587520","2591120"," Use your clock and you know that you're ready to go to the upside here."
"2595260","2596580"," So right now still short. "
"2597440","2599080"," There is no long to be had."
"2600140","2601200"," There's your channel."
"2601420","2603360"," I'm going to leave this right here for you. "
"2604060","2605620"," I'm working this morning."
"2605840","2606560"," So I'm still doing."
"2607020","2612420"," I got to get all these admin set up right to rock for the tool and let them have access"
"2612420","2613340"," to it for a couple days. "
"2614260","2615320"," Start chewing on it."
"2615420","2618020"," So I will not be with you this morning."
"2618020","2621960"," If you want my expectations for today, what do I expect?"
"2621960","2624460"," I want to be buying. "
"2625940","2627400"," This hourly trigger."
"2629040","2630840"," And I'd really like to buy."
"2631300","2633060"," Let's check that 30 minute one more time. "
"2633060","2633980"," Make sure we got that right."
"2635680","2638520"," Like that 30 minute trend is your friend, right?"
"2643150","2645930"," That 30 minute trend is your friend."
"2646030","2647810"," So give this just a second to load up. "
"2658520","2663620"," And load this up."
"2663840","2664800"," Oh, cancel."
"2665340","2666020"," There we go. "
"2667780","2671800"," So just right here, I'm looking for 30 minute trend."
"2678880","2680160"," 446 57."
"2680740","2682240"," That's what I would love to buy. "
"2683260","2685580"," Like that's like cheap Captain Jim James."
"2685900","2688900"," That's like going to the used call lot 446 62."
"2691380","2692140"," Right back. "
"2692400","2693940"," Let's just put a little box down there."
"2696160","2697900"," Put a little box down there."
"2703050","2704010"," 446 53. "
"2705750","2707330"," Put a little box down there."
"2707570","2709950"," I don't know if we get there right down there."
"2710030","2711130"," I'd like to buy that if I could. "
"2711750","2717540"," I'd be like my cheapest right down here."
"2729170","2733390"," It's like a perfect world or something like that way down there."
"2734710","2735750"," 446 53. "
"2737190","2739170"," I really like to buy this."
"2739450","2741650"," So let's see if that works out for me."
"2741730","2742890"," Let's see if I can get that. "
"2745270","2749430"," If you're a seller, you have your targets to the downside now."
"2750430","2751350"," 447 70."
"2751870","2752750"," 447 30. "
"2753570","2758450"," And then you've got this 446 53 downside move right there if you're looking for it."
"2762010","2764150"," And pay attention to this this morning."
"2765550","2770450"," And look for what it turns to long pay attention to this here. "
"2770930","2773270"," If you're looking as a bull pay attention to this."
"2775030","2778290"," If you if it signals for you to take along at any point."
"2778290","2778590"," Okay. "
"2780950","2781730"," And what happens."
"2796800","2798800"," Oh, Jared is a Delta family member."
"2801080","2803360"," So Jared's like do not tell them the secrets. "
"2804140","2805120"," Don't give them the sauce."
"2806800","2807400"," That dude."
"2807580","2809440"," It's one of the best programs in the world. "
"2810000","2812260"," So I guess my point on Amex is like."
"2813240","2814820"," The amount you have to spend now."
"2815760","2819580"," There's a bunch of stuff that you can't do and then you've got limitations on how often you can go. "
"2820360","2822940"," So I'm kind of like well if I didn't have a family right now."
"2824040","2827160"," I'd be trying to seek out a Delta a Delta family."
"2827380","2830920"," Well not family person, but pretend that I'm like a long lost cousin or something. "
"2831820","2833940"," Find someone that's trying to make some money off that pass."
"2838530","2840070"," There I've got alerts right here."
"2840370","2841390"," There's alerts right here. "
"2841450","2842250"," You can see the alerts."
"2843350","2843970"," I've got the alerts."
"2844150","2844990"," Oh, you mean in the discord?"
"2845510","2845750"," Yes. "
"2846850","2847830"," You mean in the discord?"
"2848230","2848330"," Fuck."
"2848330","2848870"," Yeah, you can."
"2849130","2850230"," You mean text messages?"
"2850670","2851150"," Yes, we can. "
"2851150","2853530"," Yeah, we got them coming."
"2853970","2855410"," So we have all those four."
"2855570","2856990"," Those were all being worked on right now. "
"2857170","2857290"," So."
"2857690","2859250"," I feel like a cap."
"2859330","2860790"," I want a phone call per ring. "
"2864010","2867010"," We've got trend going for the next five days up or down."
"2867090","2868550"," Yeah, we got those two."
"2869990","2871790"," When you should flip bearish and bullish. "
"2872250","2873290"," Yeah, we got those two."
"2875670","2877170"," I kid, you're not you're going to get them."
"2877270","2877470"," So. "
"2879010","2880130"," We got them for anyone."
"2880350","2881450"," You want to hear the crazy part?"
"2882750","2885090"," If you're a Tesla bull, I got them for that too."
"2886170","2887210"," You're an AMC bull. "
"2887330","2887870"," I got it for that."
"2888070","2888530"," I got it for GME."
"2889650","2891750"," Got them for wherever you want and VDA. "
"2891870","2893690"," Whatever your favorite ticker out there is."
"2895910","2897370"," Like a severe lover, baby."
"2899670","2901170"," Yeah, Delta is really good. "
"2901470","2902950"," I like Delta."
"2904810","2907350"," Target achieved 447 70."
"2909630","2913730"," Next target for bears 447 30. "
"2919040","2919940"," It's pretty cool."
"2920120","2920640"," Pretty cool."
"2920760","2921200"," Shit, ain't it?"
"2923580","2925600"," Oh, yeah, dude, I got you to guard. "
"2928080","2928840"," You know what the cool."
"2929040","2929600"," Dude, I got some."
"2929760","2930500"," I got stuff coming. "
"2930620","2931340"," We get stuff coming."
"2931500","2931820"," That's like."
"2933000","2939180"," If you're an investor, I can go back to the entire history of the stock market and show you. "
"2940860","2944580"," With 100% accuracy along the market, short the market."
"2945800","2947520"," For long periods of time."
"2948820","2950340"," With 100% accuracy going back to the beginning. "
"2950920","2950920"," I'm going to get in trouble."
"2951140","2951300"," I know."
"2951440","2951640"," I'm there. "
"2951740","2952240"," No fucking way."
"2952660","2953520"," Ain't no fuck away."
"2953640","2954240"," I'm not getting trouble. "
"2955700","2956340"," Fucking way."
"2960960","2963800"," Or at least the S&P 500 or Vanguard or something."
"2964280","2965260"," If you're wealthy out there. "
"2965900","2967880"," If you wait to see some of the shit that you're getting."
"2968500","2970660"," If you're a wealthy individual and you're looking for like that."
"2971460","2973080"," Yeah, this is working 100% of the time. "
"2973220","2974160"," I got something coming for you."
"2974160","2975500"," You can't say that, but I can."
"2976640","2978780"," So we'll see how that goes for you guys. "
"2979520","2980940"," It's going to blow your faces off."
"2982920","2988100"," Nice little bounce, almost to the pin on the 30 minute."
"2988560","2989060"," Look at that. "
"2990240","2995060"," Close that and that suspect to you suspect that is right."
"2995240","2997020"," Right to the pin strike."
"2997460","3002260"," You guys are going to be on social media calling out fucking pin strikes and shit. "
"3002880","3005100"," Be calling yourselves like to the tech."
"3030470","3038610"," It's so it's being tested across the board right now by administrators, developers, then some other"
"3038610","3041050"," admins and mods are big getting it released today."
"3041190","3041970"," It should be public. "
"3042890","3048890"," This by weekend or Monday as fast as we keep bottlenecking to get it out and it's ready to go."
"3049050","3049210"," So."
"3049210","3051510"," Oh, there we go. "
"3051650","3052870"," That nice little bounce, right?"
"3053390","3055970"," Let's see if the sellers still have it in them."
"3056810","3060290"," Can they rotate this down here and get this back down?"
"3060510","3061670"," Yes or no, we'll find out."
"3062590","3064630"," Hard, strong by in the 30 minute. "
"3066730","3069270"," Seller is looking for rejection on the five empty."
"3070250","3073770"," If you were a buyer, would you buy this on the half hour trigger?"
"3074190","3074670"," I wouldn't."
"3075910","3077350"," I'm always looking to make money. "
"3077670","3078630"," I always want to see."
"3079630","3084230"," The trade higher and then the bounce on the cross to the upside here."
"3085170","3087150"," And take that trade right there. "
"3087290","3089670"," This part of the trade right here is what I'd be looking for."
"3091150","3092370"," But you can if you want."
"3097550","3099210"," Still in trend right now. "
"3099390","3100550"," This is where the trend line is."
"3101650","3102510"," Right there."
"3109060","3112380"," Did it, did it, did it, did it. "
"3115800","3118280"," Am I planning on capping the number of members?"
"3118900","3119520"," I'm planning."
"3120000","3123020"," So there's a version of the tool that I'm going to cap."
"3123480","3130860"," There's a version that I think only five, maybe 25 people can have. "
"3131560","3133800"," And that version of the tool."
"3134540","3139960"," You have to have an established Internet presence for probably three to five years."
"3141420","3145620"," I got to make sure who I'm giving it to is not the wrong person. "
"3147200","3148980"," So like wrong being like."
"3150040","3151240"," I don't want to give it to."
"3151720","3153340"," I don't want to give it to. "
"3154400","3155200"," What's his face?"
"3156780","3157800"," Who's the guy from."
"3160080","3161460"," No, what's his face there?"
"3161800","3162140"," Who's the."
"3162780","3165280"," I don't want to give it's like a sub seller or something like that. "
"3165780","3168660"," So I got to make sure that the wrong people don't get it."
"3169660","3170860"," It's worth too much money."
"3171100","3176700"," So maybe just a few people will dish out the data from that to you, but you won't see that"
"3176700","3178840"," that tool ever likely in public. "
"3179420","3182360"," We'll dish out to those certain certain conditions."
"3182360","3184920"," It will tell you, hey, this is happening or that's happening."
"3184920","3185880"," If you're a member. "
"3186780","3192440"," If you're an entry level member, like basic member, you'll still get that information from us too."
"3192840","3193800"," It won't be like behind."
"3194100","3195980"," Like pay wall, pay wall and that kind of stuff. "
"3195980","3199060"," It just won't be in your fingers so you can do what you want with it."
"3201840","3203460"," There's a whole other reason for this too."
"3203600","3204340"," Too many people have it. "
"3204460","3204920"," They beat it."
"3205740","3207340"," They slightly alter what they're doing."
"3209020","3211760"," And they being the banks and the funds and the market makers. "
"3220180","3221480"," Yeah, it's pretty fucking awesome."
"3221820","3224640"," So you can back test it quite easily."
"3224640","3225860"," So we'll see how it goes. "
"3228860","3230460"," I think you guys are going to be stoked with it."
"3231260","3232840"," Oh, yeah, no, no, not Zach Morris."
"3233200","3235120"," I mean, like the other guy there. "
"3235500","3240120"," The guy with the G4 or G10 or whatever he is, whatever his name is."
"3240700","3243320"," Got arrested for DWI down in Florida or something like that recently."
"3244080","3246140"," Oh, I remember allegedly, allegedly. "
"3251440","3261330"," Ah, shit."
"3261550","3264290"," We already have the, we already have the fucking."
"3265890","3267730"," We already have the bots coming in, huh?"
"3267730","3270110"," The bots are just leaking into the, into the chat on YouTube. "
"3270430","3270750"," This sucks."
"3271310","3272470"," I hate having to do this."
"3272730","3272950"," Okay. "
"3273770","3278530"," So we're at least going to go with the subscribers now, not members, but subscribers on YouTube."
"3279250","3279930"," There you go."
"3280170","3281050"," Fuck off scammers. "
"3283610","3284210"," Save it."
"3284350","3284890"," So now you got it."
"3284910","3288390"," If you want to comment on YouTube this morning, you have to be at least a subscriber. "
"3288610","3290590"," That's free, but you have to, please subscribe."
"3290930","3291670"," Hit that like button."
"3292590","3295510"," Do me a solid and make a comment if you can this morning. "
"3296230","3301290"," If you're on YouTube, can you make a comment, not in the chat, but make a comment down in the"
"3301290","3306450"," body of the video like you would normally with a recorded video and please hit that like button."
"3306530","3307650"," I'd appreciate it."
"3311270","3312310"," Fucking bots, man. "
"3313070","3317970"," That's like, it's, it's, I have to try to figure out a way to give a discount."
"3317970","3326450"," Um, on that stuff, if you subscribe via prime, not prime, but Twitch or YouTube."
"3327710","3332130"," If you actually paid a chat here, I got to figure out a way or I'm going to, or I"
"3332130","3333830"," need to get some militant moderators. "
"3333830","3337530"," It's going to be one of the other either militant moderators and I just dump."
"3339270","3341830"," The, um, there's two ways to do this."
"3341870","3345770"," I could do where I just cancel all the chat memberships. "
"3347150","3349030"," And we just got militant moderators."
"3349050","3350550"," You just pan hammering people."
"3350990","3359310"," Anyone that sniffs of a bots or a scammer gone or some kind of a discount so that you're only"
"3359310","3360870"," paying that or you're getting a discount. "
"3361230","3367130"," If I can correlate a list of you one way or the other."
"3367710","3369530"," We got to think about that, how that works."
"3376250","3377850"," Yeah, YouTube and Twitch money for the girls. "
"3378150","3378650"," That's what it's for."
"3379510","3380390"," I know that's true."
"3382310","3384010"," Did I show you guys pictures of the kids?"
"3384250","3389850"," Like I took them out to, um, I took them out to a football game this weekend. "
"3391370","3394730"," They told dad jokes in a, in a tailgater."
"3394910","3397870"," It was, was it this weekend or the last, I don't remember was this week or the last weekend."
"3402190","3404330"," Oh, and they're almost finished with your painting too. "
"3405090","3406550"," I meant to tell you guys that too."
"3406710","3409850"," The painting is like, it's like 99% of the way done."
"3410610","3411970"," So they painted Tom Lee. "
"3413450","3414950"," They painted Tom Lee."
"3415490","3416230"," The kids did."
"3416630","3418110"," These kids are like one of them. "
"3418230","3419810"," They're all like, they're under, they're young."
"3420110","3423150"," They're young kids and they painted a portrait of Tom Lee."
"3423850","3424470"," And it looks great. "
"3427960","3429340"," Yeah, arm is."
"3431020","3433260"," All right, you guys want to talk about arm really quick."
"3433660","3433840"," So. "
"3435960","3439260"," You guys should get about five days of."
"3440120","3443300"," Up and well, like rips and dips on arm."
"3444420","3447920"," And then you're going to short that shit into the depths of hell, but. "
"3448480","3451720"," Should be about five sessions should last should last."
"3452800","3453300"," Until."
"3454520","3457240"," Tuesday of next week, something like that Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"3458140","3461340"," But be warned, it's going to get shorter to the depths of hell."
"3462040","3464140"," It is going to get shorter to the depths of hell."
"3465060","3467260"," When they were offering it at what, $51. "
"3469400","3470840"," They were offering it at 51."
"3471040","3471440"," Here we go."
"3472280","3473880"," A little bit of recovery right now. "
"3475840","3477820"," It's a nice little recovery to see here."
"3479320","3481160"," You want to be looking for that."
"3482240","3483360"," New high right now. "
"3484000","3485280"," Four forty nine fifteen."
"3486600","3489880"," That's what I want to see four forty nine fifteen right here."
"3492880","3494180"," And I want to see a reversal. "
"3494580","3496040"," So I'm looking for this right here."
"3497420","3498840"," I'm looking for that."
"3501380","3502860"," Then a reversal here. "
"3503940","3506500"," And then a much larger long here."
"3506640","3508200"," So right up here is what I'm looking for."
"3509220","3510080"," Right there. "
"3512180","3513580"," I don't want to see any week."
"3514140","3517480"," I don't want to see any week pushes up failures."
"3517600","3520120"," I want to see new high right there. "
"3522910","3523810"," It's looking good though."
"3523970","3524330"," Looking bullish."
"3525430","3526770"," Starting to get bullish here. "
"3528590","3531210"," Now if it was me, I'd probably be buying this right now."
"3532230","3533570"," But I can't tell you that."
"3533650","3534670"," I don't want to tell you guys that. "
"3536930","3540070"," I would be buying that right there, but you shouldn't."
"3540070","3541410"," You should not."
"3541910","3542750"," You should wait. "
"3543790","3545410"," Wait until it tells you."
"3547810","3548630"," I know right."
"3548810","3551390"," I bet a bunch of you right now are like buying the fuck out of this. "
"3559730","3561050"," See, we'll keep watching this."
"3561390","3561650"," Okay."
"3561910","3562890"," What else we got going on here?"
"3566440","3567260"," Yeah, they sold. "
"3567560","3570360"," You could buy arm for forty seven dollars."
"3571720","3574160"," What two days ago, three days ago, something like that."
"3574560","3576640"," Forty seven, I think, was the price of the ask. "
"3578760","3582640"," Well, they have twenty percent range up or down."
"3582920","3585020"," It was forty seven to fifty one or something like that."
"3593810","3595250"," No, no, let's be. "
"3595430","3597050"," Let me let's have a quick talk about this."
"3597170","3604250"," So I was just asked if I subscribe to Twitch, do I need to subscribe to YouTube so I don't"
"3604250","3606110"," miss out on the upcoming tools."
"3606110","3608770"," So here's the gist here. "
"3608830","3612810"," Squeeze it up right now looking for a new high at four forty nine, fourteen right up here with this"
"3612810","3613850"," yellow line is."
"3616030","3617210"," Oh, it's time with that real quick."
"3617350","3620350"," So let's start with how this began. "
"3620690","3624190"," So I've been on the internet for years."
"3625850","3628510"," Wall Street pets was the origin, right?"
"3630210","3633470"," And I got really frustrated two or three years ago."
"3633470","3636730"," I think it was almost three years now, three years. "
"3637050","3638050"," I got pretty frustrated."
"3638750","3644230"," I was watching, not felt like I watched all my friends blow up accounts in general."
"3644730","3653910"," And I was flabbergasted as well at the amount of bias"
"3653910","3662310"," out there that was not based in positioning, but in"
"3662310","3667030"," put nasses in seats to read that stuff. "
"3668990","3674270"," And no disclaimer that hey, I'm trying to get 500 likes."
"3675210","3678190"," Or I'm trying to say something or trying to become a reporter."
"3678550","3680010"," So I'm writing a story about this. "
"3680810","3684130"," I'm trying to get a job, whatever it is, right?"
"3684870","3691450"," Trying to get hired by this, you know, this, I don't know, Hindenburg or something like that, you"
"3691450","3691590"," know."
"3692190","3699330"," So I remember when I was making the first videos, it was, I really, I sucked now, but I really"
"3699330","3699950"," sucked then."
"3702630","3706450"," And I think I started with some recorded videos and went to some live streams. "
"3707070","3712190"," It wasn't able to get my point across in recorded videos."
"3712630","3720790"," And there was two things, well, a three or four, but there was like, hey, I've tried every service,"
"3720790","3721110"," right?"
"3722150","3723510"," Most of them don't work."
"3725330","3735110"," There was another part where I noticed that oftentimes investors and traders would feel the"
"3735110","3741690"," FOMO, but not have the tools to say this is where I want to buy. "
"3742590","3744930"," If it goes against me, this is how I manage my trade."
"3745710","3754230"," Like when you ask somebody like, or you see somebody's trade a log, especially when they have a lot"
"3754230","3756730"," of losing trades, you ask them about the mechanics of them, right?"
"3756970","3759030"," Like what is, what was your goal in this trade?"
"3760190","3762670"," And how, what was your plan on managing it?"
"3763690","3765670"," Oftentimes people didn't have a plan."
"3766150","3770510"," Like for entry, a plan for exiting, whether they're winning or losing. "
"3771490","3776430"," And another thing that I noticed was people weren't telling you they're positioning or when they"
"3776430","3780790"," lost alongside their wins or how they manage their trades."
"3781330","3784850"," So there's like this missing part of being a retail trader."
"3786170","3794210"," And then the last part was complex concepts that are never, they're explained to you, but they're"
"3794210","3794550"," archaic. "
"3794550","3803790"," And so there's like that, there's like that, um, that execution part of that is seems like missing,"
"3803790","3806550"," or it's missing from a lot of traders experiences."
"3807130","3811330"," So the, the, the example would be I read a book, I watched a video."
"3813190","3819130"," And I'm scared of placing a, you, you might not be scared, but a new trader would be scared of"
"3819130","3823110"," a simple debit call spread. "
"3823650","3828590"," And might not know how to manage that trade pulling legs off, um, kind of stuff."
"3829230","3833970"," Or the timeline or the theta burn or where they make most of their money or how long at the"
"3833970","3834910"," state of make all their money."
"3835150","3839870"," In that trade or exiting at 30% in real time or when, when it's going on. "
"3839990","3845030"," So, uh, so that mentorship aspect of it of walking you through that stuff."
"3845730","3846430"," Was missing."
"3847510","3848490"," So I was like angry. "
"3849490","3851130"," And I was like, you know what we're going to do?"
"3851130","3852730"," I was like, I'm going to go out on the internet and start pitching."
"3853070","3853870"," And then so I did that."
"3854070","3856810"," Then, uh, it's, we started to grow a community. "
"3858090","3862590"," And, uh, of traders and most of these people in this community have been trading with before"
"3862590","3863350"," streaming."
"3864210","3867170"," Um, and the intent was never to be where we are right now."
"3867750","3870090"," Uh, so it's been many years now, right?"
"3870190","3871270"," It's been two and a half, three years. "
"3871970","3874170"," Uh, we don't, I don't take sponsors."
"3874650","3880510"," I don't, um, I don't take, um, sponsorship money, don't push products on."
"3880510","3884210"," You've tried, uh, like the Amazon thing I did, because it was not intrusive. "
"3884350","3886550"," It didn't pay enough to make it worth it."
"3886890","3888710"," Uh, there, we don't have recorded videos."
"3888710","3891430"," I've never done anything to try to grow an audience. "
"3892130","3898150"," I've never done anything to, um, try to monetize in any, uh, way, shape or form."
"3898470","3901150"," We just ran this for two and a half years, right?"
"3901330","3905930"," So we're coming to this point where, uh, it has to be self sustainable."
"3907090","3911630"," And there's been a lot of people along the way that have helped along the way for long periods of"
"3911630","3911990"," time. "
"3912530","3918950"," Um, and like an honorarium, I need to give those people, uh, keep those people interested because"
"3918950","3919890"," they're really good at what they do."
"3920430","3927870"," And then there's the cost to me and the cost and the equipment and the services and all the fucking"
"3927870","3928950"," internet and all the other shit."
"3928950","3933090"," Should I get a, should I get a pay to keep discord running in the background and then the cost"
"3933090","3934750"," of development for all this stuff?"
"3935530","3938350"," Uh, and then the cost for data and all this other crap we got to do. "
"3938830","3945030"," Uh, and then we're trying to bring on other people that are really good at, um, what they do, like"
"3945030","3949390"," stock picking, um, nighttime videos, all kinds of stuff, right?"
"3949750","3953830"," So for all this stuff to get to where it is and to stay what it's doing, it has to"
"3953830","3955790"," kind of take care of itself at some point."
"3955790","3959010"," Or it's going to die, uh, which is fine."
"3959430","3963310"," So my original goal, I think, I think we're done with that. "
"3963450","3964510"," I think we've completed it."
"3964870","3966590"," So I'm happy at this point."
"3967050","3969590"," I feel like we've done what we want set out to do. "
"3969690","3971230"," We created a great community."
"3972110","3975850"," Um, we like the discord's amazing."
"3976610","3982470"," Uh, it blows my mind that this whole community, uh, even outside of discord conversations, phone"
"3982470","3983890"," calls, friends that we know here. "
"3983890","3985030"," It's been amazing."
"3985550","3988470"," And so it's just, it's run the link of its life at this point."
"3989170","3991390"," So we're, where are they going to disband it?"
"3992070","3994030"," Or see if they can, uh, take care of itself. "
"3994230","3996690"," So, um, some rules in this."
"3997010","4002730"," If we're going to have it take care of itself and continue to be what it is, we have some"
"4002730","4002990"," rules."
"4003570","4007390"," Uh, like number one, there's always going to be a free option for you. "
"4007390","4012730"," So I want you to know that, that they'll always be a way for you to, you know, we even"
"4012730","4013850"," duck your way around."
"4014390","4017570"," They'll always be a room on discord for you to have a place to go."
"4017690","4023110"," There's always going to be a live stream and some, you have access to some other stuff, but, uh,"
"4023110","4027130"," the original idea of this will always be some kind of free version. "
"4027490","4032510"," Now, there are people out there over the years that have asked to support this show in a more"
"4032510","4033310"," meaningful way."
"4033890","4035730"," And I've never accepted that money."
"4035730","4041930"," Um, I've had people contact me in DMS. They're like, just making a small group, 100 people, 10"
"4041930","4042270"," people."
"4042450","4042770"," I'll pay."
"4043030","4044290"," And that guy saved me random. "
"4044570","4046490"," I'll pay you 500 a month."
"4046770","4048390"," And I know 10 other people that will too."
"4049210","4051410"," Uh, we'll just shut it all down, right?"
"4052210","4053210"," Uh, we just, we don't want that. "
"4054910","4063050"," Um, and so I think that you always have the free option and you give the opportunity to the people"
"4063050","4063470"," that wants."
"4063470","4067890"," To pay for something better to pay for it."
"4068330","4071930"," So if someone wants more, they can pay for it. "
"4072070","4077010"," If someone wants more data or more access or more anything, they should have that option."
"4077830","4082070"," And to deny those people that option, uh, for where we are in the time that we put into this,"
"4082070","4087030"," uh, is, you know, it's, it doesn't concern you as a, as a free user."

"4107670","4108510"," I'm good with that."
"4108510","4111930"," Like, uh, we're at a point where I feel like we've done what we wanted to do. "
"4112590","4117229"," And, uh, if this is able to take care of itself and grow over time to take care of more"
"4117229","4120390"," retail traders, then, uh, all the better, right?"

"4141189","4142050"," you can jump on board. "
"4142970","4148790"," Get a nice little cross to the upside, trying to trade right now a new high on 44913."

"4200150","4203090"," Those things cost me thousands every month."
"4203930","4205350"," So, there is demand."
"4205970","4208450"," There is demand from people to pay. "
"4208610","4211070"," I pay for services to eat right now."
"4211070","4212110"," I pay for services."

"4218310","4219030"," I pay those guys."
"4219310","4220190"," Do you know why I pay those guys?"
"4220830","4222950"," They put a shit ton of time and effort in what they do."
"4223830","4224270"," Right?"
"4224590","4228810"," Like you pay these guys because of what they're doing. "
"4229150","4232270"," You know, there's, uh, there's, um, figuring out money."
"4232870","4237410"," You know, that guy does a ton of work that costs money and time."
"4237990","4242870"," Uh, so for that, for people that want to pay for that extra, they do it. "
"4243050","4243810"," And I do it too."

"4252150","4255490"," You're a free user, uh, you know, like I'll never pay for that stuff."
"4255590","4257610"," You don't have to, but there is demand for it. "
"4258070","4262410"," And those people are going to carry the free users along the way."
"4262490","4266650"," So if anything, if someone's going to pay for a service and you get access to the free service,"
"4266650","4272390"," that person that's a paid member is supporting, uh, you to be here, you know, or any other thing"
"4272390","4273770"," that they do or something like that, I guess."

"4365390","4366070"," Something like that."
"4366130","4366670"," It's like 10 bucks. "
"4367470","4368710"," And then it ranges all the way up."
"4369650","4375150"," As a matter of fact, the middle rate of the rain, the price target above that one."
"4376090","4381070"," Uh, looks like you're getting a tool that was supposed to be reserved for. "
"4381490","4385510"," A way higher price or price range."

"5087440","5087880"," have parents."
"5088200","5088660"," Feel like that."
"5088880","5089460"," Just go in and be cool. "
"5091960","5093320"," Walk around for a few days."
"5093640","5094100"," Don't say anything."
"5094480","5095200"," Get the lay of the land. "
"5096180","5098060"," Find out something that you're interested in."
"5098240","5099140"," You're interested in futures."
"5100220","5102160"," You're interested in stock buying or selling. "
"5102480","5103440"," If you're a bear, I don't."
"5103540","5104940"," I don't care what you are."
"5105800","5108160"," You call yourself a bull, a buyer, a salary. "
"5108500","5109420"," You buy and sell."
"5109700","5110600"," You're super smart."
"5111280","5112120"," You like to trade the wheel. "
"5112320","5113000"," Whatever it is you like."
"5113100","5113460"," I don't care."
"5114200","5115240"," You want to sell. "
"5116760","5117480"," Sell options."
"5117940","5118920"," Whatever it is you want to do."
"5119560","5120120"," Swing trader. "
"5121640","5122180"," Day trader."
"5122440","5122720"," I don't care."
"5124220","5125400"," Get the lay of the land in there. "
"5126100","5128440"," You'll find the people that know what they're doing."
"5129020","5129460"," You'll get."
"5129580","5131220"," You'll be like, oh, that guy looks like knows what he's doing. "
"5131320","5133220"," Oh, that girl looks like she knows what she's doing."
"5134220","5136000"," And then just introduce yourself."
"5137120","5138700"," Say, hey, this is who I am. "
"5138820","5139540"," This is what's going on."
"5140740","5142480"," And I always recommend asking questions."
"5143840","5148420"," Like, when you ask questions, instead of like, instead of picking your feet up and grabbing your"
"5148420","5152240"," own bear out of the refrigerator, not taking your shoes off in a new house you haven't been in"
"5152240","5153640"," before, you ask questions. "
"5154840","5158060"," How, what, where, why, and people normally will answer you."
"5158640","5162460"," If you have a lot of experience as a trader or an investor, you will learn something new."
"5162680","5163620"," Same thing applies, right?"
"5163820","5164780"," Hey, I've been trading forever. "
"5165100","5166660"," Great trader, but I want to learn this stuff."
"5167040","5174560"," Or if you're someone that wants to lend your experience, you're welcome in there as well."
"5174760","5176760"," There's nobody in there that's going to be like, oh, you know what you're doing. "
"5176780","5177180"," Make money."
"5178180","5179040"," Go fuck off."
"5179220","5179760"," Do something else. "
"5180120","5181840"," There's none of that going on inside that discord."
"5182600","5184640"," There's no pumping dumps going on that discord."
"5184820","5188540"," That's the only thing I would tell you would be if you're looking for a pump room, we don't have"
"5188540","5188740"," them. "
"5188740","5190360"," If I ever see them, they're gone."
"5190360","5195140"," If I catch a fucking pumper or a dumper or anything like that going on in the admins of the"
"5195140","5199980"," same way, they have zero tolerance for any of that kind of stuff."
"5200820","5207160"," But if you are looking to make, to make 11 or make, make good money, we have mentorships that have"
"5207160","5210880"," turned people straight around from losing traders to winning traders. "
"5212920","5214580"," And that's the place to start."
"5214720","5215400"," Start there."
"5216640","5217560"," Start there. "
"5217560","5218560"," Get an education."
"5219180","5220380"," Talk to a financial advisor."
"5220640","5222500"," Say I did all these classes, I did all this stuff. "
"5223840","5225340"," This is what I'm interested in doing."
"5226420","5228860"," But if you're a new, you're a new trader, man."
"5229920","5231420"," And you're not going to listen to me. "
"5231820","5235440"," You're just going to know already know."
"5236560","5239940"," Like new traders like two, three wins and boom, you're off and running."
"5240160","5240340"," Bye-bye. "
"5240500","5240960"," See you later."
"5241920","5242420"," I get it."
"5246490","5247870"," No, I totally get it. "
"5250650","5252590"," See if you can catch a dipeye right here."
"5254090","5256790"," Look for a dipeye right down here."
"5270870","5272770"," Yeah, we don't want any, we don't want any. "
"5273310","5275290"," I don't ever want to be a part of that stuff."
"5275530","5276990"," I've been caught in those rooms."
"5278190","5281290"," I've been members of Discords that have turned into those things. "
"5281750","5282610"," And I'm not a fan of them."
"5282730","5284370"," I don't want the fucking Pantheon where."
"5284370","5286770"," I don't want anything to do with it. "
"5287110","5288770"," And I've been burned on that stuff, too."
"5288950","5291530"," I've been the bag holder on pump and dumps."
"5293170","5296970"," And it's so crushing when you are. "
"5298490","5299990"," They're not even going to give us the dip here."
"5300110","5301870"," Are they just going to fucking buy this and ram it up?"
"5302790","5303730"," I'm just going to squeeze this."
"5303870","5305030"," Watch this squeeze right now. "
"5305830","5306730"," They don't even care."
"5307570","5308790"," It's going to, oh, dude."
"5308790","5313490"," $4.49, $4.49, $66 right now. "
"5315350","5318370"," The market still says be long right here."
"5318670","5319930"," Look at all these green, baby."
"5320470","5321710"," Look at all that green. "
"5322190","5324470"," Not quite max bullish just yet, right?"
"5325470","5326830"," But we are bullish."
"5327910","5331210"," Not quite max, but we are bullish."
"5332590","5337810"," If you see all of this stuff turn deep, dark green, time to take the money and run, OK?"
"5338830","5342870"," If you see this turn deep, dark green, it's time to start taking money and running. "
"5344930","5348050"," I'm trading $4.49, $68 right now."
"5352100","5353460"," Oh, man."
"5355420","5356380"," Oh, man. "
"5356580","5358580"," Let me take a look back here and see what we're going to."
"5359120","5361820"," What's a probable price target for the day?"
"5364460","5366360"," You got R3 up there."
"5368720","5369520"," Here's my PT2. "
"5370220","5371180"," That's already taken out."
"5372200","5374280"," Then we got PT3 up here."
"5375520","5377140"," Talked about this one for Friday. "
"5378040","5379460"," Do you think we do it today?"
"5382980","5384920"," Let's see how far we can go with this."
"5385120","5386380"," Let's look back a little bit."
"5391340","5393240"," Failure likely right there. "
"5397650","5406650"," So PT3 for today is going to be $450.25. Remember that we're coming into a nice round number up"
"5406650","5406850"," here."
"5408530","5413970"," I want you to realize that as we come up into this round number, look at this $450 up here."
"5414730","5423050"," Squeeze it all the way up, trading $4.49.76. If you don't know this, I want you to be"
"5423050","5432630"," aware that as we trade up into whole round numbers, whole round numbers,"
"5434890","5437270"," we tend to get a rejection. "
"5437590","5439290"," That's right here at $450."
"5441690","5446550"," Just be aware of that whole round numbers."
"5447070","5454130"," If any of you guys have access to BookMap, you already know that there are auto cells and auto buys"
"5454130","5457390"," on the zeros and fives. "
"5457890","5465140"," Be aware of that zeros and fives."
"5469960","5471440"," Do I watch breadth?"
"5472020","5474460"," We have another tool coming up for you shortly."
"5475840","5478340"," That one has market breadth. "
"5479800","5483300"," It also shows the rotations in the market as well."
"5484320","5490580"," We also use PPOs and PPMs alongside market breadth for the three together."
"5490820","5492540"," PPOs, PPMs with market breadth. "
"5493820","5497120"," This tool right here has three auto settings."
"5497640","5502300"," Daytrader, swingtrader, and macrotrader as well."
"5502580","5507340"," That macrotrader will tell you in the right risk of a rollover or a bottom. "
"5508200","5514840"," We also have a gamma tool coming out as well with a market update on gamma every day."
"5515660","5517240"," It's going to be a pretty bad ass."
"5525640","5530860"," That $450 should get the advanced decline line. "
"5531720","5539980"," I use part of advanced decline in the market breadth, or it's calculated into market breadth, but I"
"5539980","5541760"," don't use the AD line on its own."
"5542320","5543320"," I'm not a fan of it."
"5543460","5547240"," I use it to find out where the rotation is coming into the market. "
"5548800","5550400"," It does a good job at that."
"5551300","5558480"," Stockcharts.com has some great four square grids for advances and declineers tracking them."
"5560940","5563340"," I do recommend Stockcharts.com for that too. "
"5564160","5565740"," They do a great job at it."
"5572260","5574360"," They should turn like a dark green."
"5574900","5580600"," Depending on the time frame you're on, right now the time frame you're on, you're looking for the"
"5580600","5584680"," one minute, the five minute, the 30, and the hourly to turn deep dark green. "
"5585120","5588780"," Whenever you see that, it's like wrapping up."
"5588900","5590100"," Even if we go higher, wrap it up."
"5594720","5595820"," Wrap it up. "
"5624780","5628040"," You're trying to type in Tesla on the website."
"5628220","5629860"," That's just a placeholder there."
"5630980","5633800"," All that is a placeholder on the website. "
"5634400","5635420"," It's all that is a placeholder."
"5636380","5637540"," That's not what you're getting."
"5644680","5646760"," This will turn a dark green. "
"5646940","5648120"," I'll show it to you when it happens."
"5648920","5651740"," It'll say max bullish over here on the right hand side."
"5651880","5652800"," It'll say max bullish. "
"5665130","5666110"," Thoughts on coin?"
"5666730","5670310"," Let me take a quick look."
"5671910","5674950"," I've got to put the stream up online."
"5675790","5677430"," Keep forgetting to put the stream up here. "
"5677610","5677790"," Hold on."
"5678670","5680150"," I've got to put the stream out real quick."
"5688060","5689520"," I will do Tesla coin. "
"5690280","5696460"," We'll look at Bitcoin too, because I know a lot of you are panicking on Bitcoin."
"5696460","5698660"," We'll talk about Bitcoin as well."
"5700620","5701760"," Give me one quick second. "
"5701940","5703520"," I've got to do a quick update."
"5710200","5711240"," Spoons, queues."
"5712760","5713740"," We'll look at Tesla today. "
"5715660","5716860"," We'll do BTC."
"5718480","5720600"," That's like cancer putting that out there, isn't it?"
"5722240","5724200"," Play attracts all the bots and shit."
"5733680","5745720"," If I hate fucking putting shit out there about Bitcoin because it attracts"
"5745720","5746840"," bots on Twitter. "
"5751860","5753660"," So I'll post this right here."
"5759260","5760740"," It's fascinating too."
"5760840","5765180"," I saw Andy talking about bonds, longing HYG. "
"5765760","5769560"," I got shit on for that post last week from other people on Fintuit."
"5770280","5779660"," We're talking about talking about, we're talking about, can"
"5779660","5782040"," you guys do me a solid out there?"
"5783480","5787100"," Can you do me a solid and on Fintuit?"
"5787320","5787600"," Do you mind?"
"5788160","5789500"," Because I was late to repost this."
"5790920","5792400"," Can you guys go on Fintuit?"
"5792520","5793640"," I just posted a link to the livestream. "
"5793640","5796000"," Do you guys mind retweeting that tweet for me?"
"5797460","5803900"," As a matter of fact, if you retweet that tweet and make a comment inside of that tweet, I'll follow"
"5803900","5804240"," you."
"5806660","5818340"," Trading $4.49.80. Looking to squeeze up that big yellow line over here trying to trade $4.50. If"
"5818340","5823220"," you retweet my newest tweet where I put the stream out, I will make a comment."
"5823420","5824300"," I'll follow you on Twitter. "
"5826680","5829800"," If you want me to follow you, I just went and cleaned up my follows yesterday."
"5830940","5835120"," So I'm going to delete a bunch of people that aren't following me and then if you follow me, I"
"5835120","5836080"," keep following you."
"5842150","5843130"," I got you Nick. "
"5843690","5844050"," Thanks, brother."
"5844250","5844830"," I followed you, brother."
"5845510","5847250"," You got 14 followers now, my man. "
"5847250","5849690"," And I'm actually going to put you on alerts too."
"5850410","5851050"," So there you go."
"5851110","5853610"," I turned alerts on for you for when you post so I can talk to you. "
"5858810","5860230"," Got you two rogue operator."
"5860770","5861690"," Oh, you're already following you."
"5861770","5863290"," I'm going to make sure I got your alerts on for you. "
"5864030","5865650"," So I put alerts on for you, brother."
"5867530","5872410"," Make sure I see you trading $4.49.88. Relentless moves to the upside right now."
"5873470","5875530"," It's a 15 minute chart down below that squeeze. "
"5875990","5877550"," And I are up there right now."
"5882210","5883850"," Nice big cross back here."
"5883910","5884550"," Didn't even wait. "
"5884830","5884970"," Boom."
"5885310","5885610"," To the upside."
"5894380","5895060"," What do we got?"
"5895260","5906650"," $4.50. Move this one up now to $4.50. What"
"5906650","5907790"," else you guys are doing there?"
"5911750","5913470"," Andre, what's up, brother?"
"5914890","5916190"," I'm going to put alerts on you now. "
"5916350","5917470"," I just set alerts on you."
"5918570","5918910"," What up, no?"
"5920590","5924530"," I got you, Patrick."
"5924810","5925990"," Make sure I got alerts set for you. "
"5926110","5926750"," Nice campfire."
"5927130","5928210"," Dude, nice boats."
"5929290","5930090"," Nice boats. "
"5930530","5930830"," Oh, dude."
"5931110","5931970"," Patrick's got boats."
"5933050","5934230"," I got a boat, brother. "
"5935550","5937290"," Matter of fact, I'm trying to get rid of it right now."
"5939890","5940950"," Johnny, what up?"
"5941610","5942290"," Snowboarder nine."
"5942510","5943330"," He's in front of a beach. "
"5945310","5946110"," Nice, brother."
"5947130","5947350"," Love it."
"5948690","5948750"," California. "
"5949990","5950710"," Hell yeah."
"5951850","5953750"," Where do you live, Johnny, in California?"
"5955030","5955990"," Where do you surf, man?"
"5956230","5956710"," Where's your home?"
"5956870","5957510"," Where's your home beach?"
"5964640","5966360"," Where is your home beach?"
"5969100","5971160"," I love, I love surfing, man."
"5973460","5974280"," Nick, brother. "
"5974500","5976020"," I got you covered following you, Nick."
"5977300","5979420"," But make sure I put on alerts for you too."
"5979740","5982100"," Johnny, make sure I got alerts set for you too. "
"5985600","5986760"," I got everybody here."
"5986860","5987360"," I think I got everybody."
"5987620","5988180"," Okay, good, good. "
"6002890","6007310"," Well, so I was going to do the cell now."
"6007590","6009190"," Like I was going to do max bearish."
"6011750","6019150"," But there are other conditions that you're going to get this in a video from me, but so I want"
"6019150","6028470"," you to also know that like max bullish can be sustained on higher time frames for longer. "
"6028930","6031430"," So let's look at something."
"6031790","6039590"," So on the daily trigger down here, weekly trigger and monthly triggers, we can actually get max"
"6039590","6043310"," bearish and it does not mean sell."
"6048930","6054850"," It actually means that we can be sustained for a long period of time. "
"6055410","6063610"," Now saying that something fascinating is if we begin to get a role in those higher time frame"
"6063610","6070410"," velocities to the downside, we can get to if we have priced divergence to the upside, it'll"
"6070410","6072330"," actually show a major market role."
"6072330","6074510"," But that'll be in a video for you."
"6074710","6076990"," And trust me, I tried. "
"6077570","6079250"," I was like, maybe we should make the max bearish."
"6079630","6080330"," We should not."
"6081890","6083310"," It's max bullish. "
"6083670","6085670"," And because the time frame frames matter."
"6086730","6091930"," Because we can have supportive flows that means that we'll get a dip buy down below."
"6096940","6099960"," You serve ocean side and trestles. "
"6100220","6100280"," Nice."
"6101620","6102520"," Swami is nice too."
"6102520","6105260"," Dude, black is too in the winter. "
"6105480","6106000"," Hell yeah."
"6106260","6107480"," Dude, I got to go down there with you."
"6108160","6110740"," I got, I almost, I shouldn't say I got beaten up. "
"6110820","6112100"," I almost got beaten up down there."
"6112400","6113580"," I tried surfing down there."
"6115180","6118020"," And I got, I got, I got, I got sand kicked in my face. "
"6118400","6119360"," I had my kids with me too."
"6120320","6123080"," I got, I was, I was going to beat my ass with my kids with me."
"6123780","6124940"," I even had my kids there. "
"6125280","6126300"," It was not fucking pretty."
"6127340","6128820"," Those guys do not fuck around."
"6147610","6149030"," We're still finalizing. "
"6149210","6150670"," So we had a version of the tool."
"6151770","6157150"," We had a version of the tool that was the between, it's not just the tool."
"6157210","6158730"," A bunch of other crap to come with it. "
"6159330","6160650"," But there is a version of the tool."
"6160890","6163870"," We were trying to get it between like 39 and 59 a month."
"6164830","6167370"," But then we had a hundred and fifty dollar version of the tool. "
"6168410","6172050"," That's the version you're getting for the 39 or 59 or whatever it is."
"6173250","6175050"," They'll be like discounts and stuff."
"6175250","6177850"," And if you sign up for a year or more, that kind of stuff. "
"6180010","6186570"," The packages that we have normally go out there for other places for like $600 to $600."
"6187670","6188710"," So it's a steal."
"6189370","6190090"," It's a fucking steal. "
"6190350","6191330"," It's basically free."
"6192150","6192830"," It's so stupid."
"6194750","6196490"," So stupid how cheap it is. "
"6205460","6206820"," It's so fucking stupid."
"6207380","6214260"," And you know what you're getting at that cheap is because the I can't for me to get the website"
"6214260","6217400"," for the functionality that I want the website."
"6217460","6220620"," I have to actually build my own charting service. "
"6221440","6222780"," That shit's going to cost money."
"6223320","6227620"," It's going to cost like when I'm done with that, it's probably going to cost."
"6231600","6236300"," 30 to 50,000 and then 15,000 a month for the data. "
"6238580","6239400"," We'll get there."
"6239760","6240360"," We'll get there."
"6240640","6243740"," It's just it's just not fucking cheap and it's time consuming. "
"6253500","6256560"," I think we go back here and check this this five minute down here."
"6258660","6260420"," I think we're going to check all the way down here."
"6263160","6264760"," I think we're going to check that right there. "
"6266600","6268200"," Right there is what I think we're going to check."
"6269680","6272260"," You know the bear is going to want to do that bullshit too, aren't they?"
"6273120","6274220"," The bear is going to want."
"6277380","6279240"," Don't get caught in the finger trap if it happens. "
"6280360","6281880"," You guys know all about the finger trap."
"6282100","6283160"," Do not get caught in here."
"6284480","6287800"," If this dip holds, you can always take that up. "
"6288460","6290980"," Do not get caught below inside of this right here."
"6294100","6295960"," Let's check velocity in the 30 minute."
"6304540","6306580"," Yeah, we're losing a little bit of fellow here. "
"6307060","6308880"," A little bit of fellow in the squeeze."
"6317040","6319100"," Vellow declining as price is rising."
"6319880","6320560"," Never a good sign. "
"6324830","6328770"," Let's see if we can get a pullback down here to at least our two or the five minute."
"6352560","6353380"," Hey, where are you real?"
"6353460","6353940"," How are you doing brother?"
"6356800","6357400"," Hey, did."
"6365690","6366790"," When feet picks. "
"6369990","6370930"," When feet picks."
"6371590","6373450"," Should we go check out arm really quick?"
"6373630","6375610"," Let's go look at arm really quick and see what it's doing."
"6376330","6377090"," Check out arm. "
"6377230","6380770"," If this holds at 449 and 60 holds, we're going to go higher."
"6382070","6383230"," We're going to look at arm."
"6383590","6385350"," Let's see if it's even on here. "
"6385590","6386990"," Oh, yeah, there it is."
"6388010","6388550"," Is that it?"
"6388750","6388830"," Nope."
"6390370","6391510"," Is that not the ticker?"
"6391770","6392770"," Do I get the wrong one?"
"6392890","6393670"," Maybe it's not up yet. "
"6396030","6397170"," It's not real estate."
"6398550","6399750"," I think it's this one right here."
"6400930","6401790"," I'm not seeing it. "
"6401790","6404670"," I'm missing it here, maybe."
"6406030","6407410"," That's Nasdaq right there."
"6407550","6408290"," It's not showing anything. "
"6415240","6419940"," Price holding being bought right now on the 1MT, looking for R3 at 450."
"6421060","6421240"," 43."
"6422860","6425040"," We're going to talk about something here really quick. "
"6425160","6428780"," We're going to switch over to the Webull full chart."
"6429320","6431220"," I'm going to talk to you about a good setup right here."
"6431900","6433460"," I'm going to show you a setup right now. "
"6434560","6436160"," Pay a close attention."
"6437020","6438560"," Pay a close attention."
"6440020","6443000"," We have a recheck right now right here. "
"6443240","6445660"," See how we're checking this white line right here?"
"6445940","6449960"," I want you to look at what time it is."
"6450740","6452580"," It's 11.19 in the morning."
"6454160","6461060"," Right now we need a new high into 11.30. We must get a new high. "
"6461940","6462280"," Okay."
"6463120","6464740"," To stay alive."
"6465660","6466260"," Make sense?"
"6468660","6472880"," To get the new high to stay alive for continued upside. "
"6474460","6481880"," If we fail to get the new high here, if we fail to get the new high, what will happen"
"6481880","6488240"," is we will, if let's say we fail to get a new high here, right?"
"6489140","6497460"," What will happen is they will run this down to check the five minute trigger."
"6498380","6499600"," Okay, right here."
"6503110","6507490"," And we will check this down here and you'll see us cross right into that. "
"6509230","6514750"," This is to check to make sure that we still have demand to go higher."
"6514750","6518550"," That buyers are actually here right now."
"6518710","6518930"," Okay. "
"6519350","6522150"," So there's a check going on right now to see if there's demand."
"6522550","6525510"," So I want to take close attention to this right now."
"6526090","6528630"," We know that buyers just bought, right?"
"6529690","6533970"," So someone stepped in and bought right there. "
"6534830","6540850"," Now, how do we know if these are real buyers or if this is just some like some randos, small"
"6540850","6544570"," hedge fund or something, you would know if we got the new high."
"6545550","6548610"," You would know if we got the new high to the upside."
"6550170","6552430"," That's that's real demand, right?"
"6552930","6553790"," Real demand, right?"
"6554050","6558010"," Real buyers, real demand would show right here. "
"6558510","6560210"," New high, right?"
"6561050","6569250"," If we do not get that, if we begin even after these guys bought right here, right?"
"6569490","6570410"," So someone bought this."
"6571750","6575170"," If we don't push up and get that new high, guess where we're headed."
"6576470","6577410"," We're going to head back down. "
"6577670","6581590"," We're going to check this buyer, right?"
"6581930","6584010"," Find out if this buyer is serious or not."
"6584150","6593650"," If this buyer is not serious, we're going to roll down here and check to see if these buyers"
"6593650","6594990"," are still here."
"6596830","6597310"," Right?"
"6597450","6600190"," We'll check to see if these, if this is real demand or not. "
"6602410","6607910"," If you catch the bounce, if buyers do step in right here, right?"
"6612360","6614460"," This buyer steps in right here."
"6615720","6618740"," This seller is going to try to sell them back down, right?"
"6621540","6626740"," We'll try to sell this people back down, right?"
"6627960","6630780"," And they're going to try to sell this down to the depths of hell on you, right?"
"6632700","6633980"," Just like that, right?"
"6634540","6635200"," Bam, bam, bam."
"6635340","6636120"," There's your new low. "
"6637700","6638780"," You'll then come up."
"6639700","6641680"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, right there."
"6644180","6646440"," And that's your sequence, right?"
"6649420","6651640"," That's a great short, by the way, right there. "
"6651980","6653480"," It's an outstanding short right there."
"6653620","6654560"," Not so much this crap."
"6655200","6656220"," It's like where you get caught. "
"6656720","6659320"," The reason I'm bringing this up to you is for this reason, okay?"
"6660560","6665080"," There is a trap in here, sideways."
"6666460","6668400"," You don't want to get caught in any of this."
"6668540","6670300"," You don't want to get caught in any of this right here. "
"6670380","6670880"," Watch my cursor."
"6671140","6672200"," You don't get caught in any of that."
"6672200","6680640"," So if you're a bull, and we check this down here, you could possibly take that long for one or"
"6680640","6681060"," two minutes. "
"6681300","6690120"," But the reality is that you'd want to see this reversal to the upside, and you want to re-enter"
"6690120","6694360"," long, actually up here, right?"
"6696920","6700500"," So you're not taking this long, you're taking this one right here."
"6701580","6711440"," On the same token, if this turns around and continues higher and holds, you'll be"
"6711440","6717440"," looking for that new high right there, coming back down, and then taking that long up there and"
"6717440","6719800"," entering right there, right?"
"6720140","6724240"," Set up trade, take it up here, take out your PT3 up here."
"6726060","6726860"," Makes sense?"
"6726860","6732580"," And the one thing that you don't want to do is you do not want to get caught down in"
"6732580","6732800"," here. "
"6733460","6735180"," This is like death bill down here."
"6735260","6736260"," This grinds out everybody."
"6736620","6737740"," Don't ever get caught in this. "
"6738180","6740520"," This is the goat, Mr. Yens."
"6741060","6742920"," Do not fuck around in this."
"6743720","6744740"," Diddle in the middle. "
"6745200","6746480"," This is called Diddler in the Middle."
"6749920","6752080"," Do not diddle in the middle."
"6755480","6757260"," It's the fuck around and find out. "
"6757440","6758700"," That's the fuck around and find out."
"6759240","6760220"," Bullbear doesn't matter."
"6760400","6761740"," I don't care if you're a seller or a buyer. "
"6762380","6765580"," Never get caught in between this white and red line."
"6765920","6767620"," Never get caught."
"6767760","6769360"," As a matter of fact, here's a great example of it, right?"
"6771140","6772480"," It's a prime example. "
"6773300","6775820"," Get caught in here, right?"
"6776260","6776700"," Boom, downside."
"6778280","6778320"," Right?"
"6778520","6780480"," Let's say you're like, yeah, I'm buying calls because we're going up."
"6780480","6783240"," That didn't do that before you did it, right?"
"6784300","6785240"," Come back up though. "
"6785440","6786480"," Come back up here."
"6786820","6787660"," Bam, slam down in here."
"6788080","6789420"," And you're off and running, right?"
"6790100","6791660"," Money time, right?"
"6792000","6793260"," All this here, trap. "
"6795460","6798460"," Never get caught in the trap in here."
"6799600","6800040"," Make sense?"
"6800820","6801680"," Never get caught in the trap."
"6806060","6807620"," Let's say you get caught in the trap. "
"6808580","6812600"," Let's say you're long here and you get caught in the trap."
"6812600","6816440"," And you get a classic liquidation break."
"6817160","6818540"," You start bleeding down. "
"6819040","6820520"," You've got calls right here."
"6822060","6824060"," And you're panicking in here, right?"
"6825000","6828960"," What would you, let's say now you've got like 10, let's see, dollar calls."
"6831900","6835020"," And they're now worth 60 cents. "
"6835220","6835840"," They smoke you."
"6837620","6839540"," Do you panic sell this right here?"
"6839960","6840600"," Fuck, no."
"6841400","6842800"," Fuck, no, fuck, no. "
"6843760","6846040"," You wait until we come back up here."
"6846660","6849360"," And then you unfuck yourself, right?"
"6849900","6850600"," I shouldn't be swearing."
"6852860","6857820"," And you might say, well, cap, you might say, well, cap though, we kept going up. "
"6858460","6859200"," Doesn't matter."
"6859640","6864180"," You need to be positioned properly, right?"
"6865220","6870180"," So you need, if your thesis is wrong here, I guess you could double, double up here."
"6870180","6875460"," But truth be told, you'd be looking for this first and then take the long. "
"6876320","6877000"," Makes sense."
"6877440","6882940"," So if you're trapped in here, you wait for the squeeze higher, you get out of your calls, wait for"
"6882940","6885420"," the bounce, and only enter after the bounce."
"6886320","6886700"," Makes sense?"
"6889720","6891620"," There's a prime example right here. "
"6891700","6893140"," Hopefully we'll see this happen right now."
"6895400","6899300"," There's a good prime example right here."
"6900200","6903300"," And I know if you own calls right here, you'd be in some pain. "
"6903740","6905940"," Oh, no, shit, I'm burning right now."
"6906060","6908040"," I'm in some, oh, terrible, terrible, horrible."
"6909040","6910440"," Let's see if you're given an exit. "
"6911440","6913160"," Ten that you had calls right here."
"6914140","6922060"," Let's see if in this painful moment, at any point, you get an out for your poor decision making,"
"6922480","6924660"," rather than capitulating."
"6929440","6932680"," Let's see how this works itself. "
"6932960","6937820"," As a matter of fact, we'll just switch back to the main screen here."
"6938320","6939760"," And we're going to watch it right here."
"6940240","6949380"," So I want to know if you bought zero date calls or weekly calls right here, so you were the"
"6949380","6950540"," guy that bought that right there. "
"6951700","6955460"," Let's see if you're going to capitulate at home."
"6955460","6957900"," If you're watching this right now, pretend you're a bull."
"6959340","6966820"," And in your mind, I want you to tell yourself I would have sold there or watch an options chain"
"6966820","6969160"," or paper trade or whatever you're going to do. "
"6970120","6975800"," And then even by calls right now, buy somebody fucking like a buy one contract ten cents, you tell"
"6975800","6981990"," me where you would have sold if you would have been given an opportunity to get out."
"6984060","6986660"," And then where you would reposition yourself."
"6992590","6993890"," It has an exercise. "
"6996170","7005000"," Would you unfuck yourself right here and then wait or would you take this right here as your unfuck"
"7005000","7010360"," point and then would you wait to get back in until there was a confirmation to the upside."
"7011220","7015740"," Would you reset up that trade and then try to jump back in over here?"
"7015740","7021260"," Because I'll warn you too, there's always the risk of it rolling on you."
"7022420","7026340"," But you're still giving a moment to get out before that happens, right?"
"7028360","7029720"," Still giving a chance. "
"7031020","7037240"," And the management of your trades is more important than being correct."
"7038080","7043840"," So you're going to have moments as a trader where you're going to make a bad trade, bad entry,"
"7044580","7046520"," FOMO, whatever it is that makes you do that."
"7047260","7050900"," If it goes against you, are you managing that loss?"
"7051620","7054320"," So it's okay to make a bad trade. "
"7055740","7064620"," What is not okay is if you bought calls right here and you just said, fuck, right?"
"7064880","7066320"," You're giving a chance to get out."
"7067060","7069500"," And you said, no, I'm staying long just in case this happens."
"7070300","7075120"," But it rolls back down on you and down here and now you're at zero. "
"7076280","7078300"," And this works on any time frame."
"7078480","7083380"," This works on five minute, one minute, hour, half hour daily."
"7083980","7084940"," This works on a day chart. "
"7085800","7088980"," These same patterns emerge on higher time frames."
"7090780","7098620"," And this is actually a point of when you look back on managing your trade logs."
"7101400","7104040"," Let's say you are long, let's pretend this is a one hour chart. "
"7105100","7107480"," As a matter of fact, we don't even have to pretend."
"7112060","7114160"," We don't have to pretend we have an example right here."
"7114900","7116040"," Here's an example right here. "
"7118940","7121200"," Here's your previous example right here."
"7124520","7126340"," So you've got a bear plane."
"7129980","7132160"," You've got a confirmed bear plane right here. "
"7132920","7134160"," And a higher time frame."
"7134600","7136480"," This is a 30 minute chart, right?"
"7136720","7138280"," This is the exact same thing, right?"
"7138940","7142480"," We trade down into the box of death, right?"
"7144560","7145900"," Boom, slam down."
"7146920","7148440"," You caught the bear plane. "
"7149080","7150500"," Fuck yeah, take that short, right?"
"7151420","7151720"," Bam."
"7153660","7154180"," Right?"
"7154740","7156600"," You're short here in the bear plane, right?"
"7157960","7160340"," It reverses to the upside on you."
"7162720","7163240"," Right?"
"7167280","7170140"," Now you were given a chance to get out, weren't you?"
"7171700","7173380"," You were given a chance right here. "
"7174000","7177100"," What do you do right here and here?"
"7178120","7178540"," You get out."
"7179100","7181380"," You close that short position right in there."
"7182100","7186120"," Until you break below the box, right?"
"7186120","7188620"," You should have actually entered right here, right?"
"7189800","7191180"," But here's another cool thing. "
"7191320","7194480"," Let's say you entered right here and it goes against you."
"7195180","7197660"," You still give it a chance to get out right here."
"7197860","7198500"," Get what I'm saying?"
"7199060","7200280"," You're given the opportunity to get out. "
"7200560","7203060"," And furthermore, let's say you didn't do any of that."
"7203440","7205140"," Say you didn't do any of that, right?"
"7206360","7208160"," You're in the box of death in here."
"7209940","7212260"," Did you take, did you get out here?"
"7213620","7220040"," Once you know that this is resolved to the upside, did you get out here?"
"7220440","7221980"," And here's the crazier part. "
"7223500","7230410"," You then got a bull plane confirmation to the upside right here."
"7230630","7231370"," There's bull plane confirmation."
"7232690","7238210"," You got this zone of finger trap here, and they just told you bull plane right there. "
"7239190","7241770"," Get a bull plane, get out of your shorts."
"7242450","7248890"," There goes the squeeze because the right people that know got out of their shorts, right?"
"7249630","7253150"," Come back down here, confirms again and goes to the upside."
"7253770","7255790"," Did you close any of your shorts in here or not?"
"7256270","7256610"," No?"
"7257390","7259370"," Let's look at what happened because you didn't. "
"7261650","7262650"," That's what happened."
"7262650","7267690"," It's trading $4.50.03 due to it."
"7301800","7304640"," Downside targets for the bears. "
"7306740","7312150"," $4.49.05 right down here."
"7313610","7342670"," $4.47.45. Bear,"
"7342810","7345470"," need to get underneath here, right?"
"7356780","7362540"," Remember to take the money off of $4.49.08 if you're selling this."
"7366310","7371290"," You don't want to get the move, lose all your money. "
"7371290","7380030"," And you want to be underneath this five-minute trigger"
"7380030","7383690"," for your next move lower."
"7408640","7410080"," Come on, baby."
"7411020","7413020"," $11.35, new half hour starting. "
"7416260","7421740"," Bull hour start, two from $11.30 to $12.30. Let me know in the chat if you think that"
"7421740","7423960"," this, if we're done here going to the upside."
"7435360","7438060"," What size of count would you recommend to be able to trade?"
"7438560","7441540"," What size of count to be able to trade $100k per year?"
"7442500","7444120"," I need more contacts for that question."
"7449720","7450620"," No trades for me. "
"7450680","7451440"," I'm going back to work."
"7451600","7452460"," I got stuff I got to do."
"7452580","7455020"," So I'm going to leave you guys to your own devices here. "
"7455820","7456720"," One more day."
"7459400","7461340"," One more day of leaving you to your devices."
"7462260","7464320"," I'm going to get this website out and run for you guys. "
"7464900","7467200"," So I'm trying to keep you guys up abreast here."
"7467740","7470480"," You guys got to try to help each other out inside the chat this morning."
"7479620","7484720"," So you mentioned that buyers need to continue to see, to continue seeing new highs for"
"7484720","7485160"," continuation. "
"7486560","7488220"," No, you need to see new lows too."
"7488440","7488740"," Absolutely."
"7489080","7490120"," You need to see new lows as well. "
"7491080","7494400"," New lows and breaks of, I see it on south side all the time."
"7494400","7497780"," New lows too like breaking those bottom pivots."
"7497980","7498440"," Absolutely. "
"7499520","7505260"," And then they comes back and checks the one minute and five minute on the downside as well."
"7505920","7509740"," The same thing that works on the upside works on the inverse as well."
"7510760","7513240"," You'll see them check those same things. "
"7525060","7526380"," See me in five minutes."
"7527000","7527520"," I know I know."
"7530240","7531860"," What return on investments. "
"7531860","7535520"," I don't particularly think a hundred thousand is a lot of money."
"7537060","7540880"," What what are I would expect that a hundred thousand dollars over the course of a year."
"7543160","7544980"," It depends on what you're trying to do. "
"7546300","7549240"," I would be hoping for a minimum after taxes."
"7549980","7552580"," Twenty percent after taxes."
"7553940","7556820"," That's all your L's all your W's all wrapped up. "
"7558600","7560040"," No, that's that's what I want."
"7560240","7560660"," Twenty percent."
"7561940","7562420"," Absolutely. "
"7562700","7564800"," I want to I want to beat six percent."
"7565860","7568440"," But if you can get 20, I'd be happy."
"7568780","7569500"," Very happy at 20. "
"7571960","7573460"," What can you expect though?"
"7575020","7576020"," It's hard to say."
"7576480","7578000"," What I would say to you is this."
"7579400","7582840"," I say this to everybody, but no one listens to this. "
"7583260","7584080"," It's a good question."
"7585340","7589920"," If you were to take ten or less trades a year."
"7591580","7595660"," You could be a millionaire in a year, but none of you do that. "
"7596260","7597280"," You guys are gamblers."
"7597940","7599380"," You guys are addicted to gambling."
"7600480","7603080"," You guys can't turn the fucking computer off. "
"7603760","7605460"," You guys can't stop reading Bloomberg."
"7605920","7607280"," You guys can't stop reading."
"7608040","7609120"," Twitter and Twitch. "
"7609720","7610080"," Not Twitch."
"7612000","7612680"," Twitter."
"7613120","7613900"," Stock Twits. "
"7614140","7615000"," Wall Street Bats."
"7615360","7615480"," Reddit."
"7616340","7617520"," Fucking stupid. "
"7618480","7623260"," Our stocks on Reddit and our real finance and all other stupid shit you read."
"7624220","7625660"," You can't stop reading Bloomberg."
"7625980","7627160"," You can't stop watching CNBC. "
"7628780","7631720"," If you did that, you'd be rich."
"7632940","7634040"," But you can't."
"7635840","7636720"," You can't. "
"7636860","7638500"," You guys have no self-control."
"7639720","7641580"," I don't have any self-control either."
"7641880","7648620"," I'm not in that same boat, but I would make a bet with you that if you limited your trades"
"7648620","7652240"," to like ten times a year, you'd be very well off. "
"7652600","7653280"," But you guys don't."
"7653820","7656220"," You guys make one good trade and then you start."
"7656420","7657080"," I do the same thing. "
"7657240","7659240"," I just made a normal trade that made a ton of money."
"7659420","7659780"," What am I doing?"
"7660000","7662120"," I'm out there fucking blowing thousands on zero dates."
"7663160","7664600"," You guys do that shit too. "
"7664740","7666480"," I know I'm not the only one that does that."
"7666820","7669660"," So I know, I think I have a lot of self-control."
"7670140","7671560"," I used to not have a lot of self-control. "
"7672440","7673640"," I used to do what you guys do."
"7673760","7675820"," I go out there and have a big win that I just burn it all."
"7676120","7676960"," Start all over again. "
"7677200","7678060"," Go through the cycle again."
"7678200","7678740"," All that kind of shit."
"7678920","7681860"," So you should have savings. "
"7682540","7686820"," You should have retirement that you're saving for first before you do anything with that 100k."
"7687360","7688900"," That money should be making you money."
"7688900","7691580"," If you had $100,000 right now, right?"
"7692240","7698940"," Probably the simplest thing you could do is put it in like weebel of all places. "
"7699780","7703260"," I think weebel and Robinhood pay you like five or six percent, right?"
"7704180","7709160"," I would take the five or six percent that you make from that money and start there."
"7710160","7716480"," Use that free money to gamble so that you're protecting your wealth, right?"
"7716480","7720660"," You might not be out running inflation while Jerome says he's going to help you protect your"
"7720660","7725800"," wealth, but that five percent, I wouldn't do shit for a full year and I'd take that money."
"7726480","7730300"," And if you make anything from that, then I would pull all that money out of the stock market. "
"7731260","7732120"," Then I'd buy houses."
"7733440","7742000"," I'd go to like, I don't know, Dayton, Ohio or Minneapolis or some other place that has"
"7742000","7743980"," cheap housing."
"7744520","7745600"," And I'd buy homes. "
"7746860","7751820"," And then if you've got more, if they're paying you money and you're actually making money off"
"7751820","7754460"," someone, someone renting from you, you don't need a ton of homes."
"7754600","7756600"," Two, three, something like that."
"7757200","7758460"," You can take that money from that. "
"7758800","7763700"," If you're like paying all your bills, paying taxes, you got some little bit extra left over."
"7763880","7765800"," That's more money you can use to trade with."
"7766580","7770000"," But there should always be an income flow for you to trade. "
"7770000","7775100"," So, yeah, if you had a K, I wouldn't even be trading the stock market."
"7776040","7777120"," I put it in Webull."
"7777280","7779020"," Take the money from that and trade with that money. "
"7786780","7789920"," Yeah, puts are not paying because of the vol, man."
"7790760","7792600"," Puts aren't paying because we have vol crush."
"7793600","7794860"," You need some volatility, right?"
"7797020","7798360"," I've been trading puts, man. "
"7798500","7799880"," They fucking suck right now."
"7800820","7802740"," Dude, the other day I was trading puts with Binky."
"7803940","7808680"," Binky and I were trading together one day last week and I'm in puts, right?"
"7809000","7811080"," And I'm watching the fucking market go down. "
"7811660","7815120"," And my puts literally did not move in price."
"7815400","7816420"," They just stayed solid."
"7817240","7821480"," We were like blasting down through, blasting down through levels. "
"7822600","7827600"," And I'm like motherfuckers, like, excuse my language, but I was so fucking mad."
"7827600","7832280"," Had the direction right, had the entry right, did not matter."
"7832860","7836720"," They were just like, dealers were just like, there you go, buddy, fuck off. "
"7839360","7842660"," A part of this too is not our people are leaving the market."
"7843500","7847860"," There's also a contraction going on in the market where not, there aren't as many as participants."
"7848900","7851020"," There's like a dual function going on right now. "
"7851720","7852820"," There's reduced vol."
"7853260","7857620"," And then there's the number of market participants matter as well."
"7871040","7872040"," That's a good question. "
"7872300","7873060"," Do you buy this dip?"
"7873360","7874940"," This is a great, great question right now."
"7875040","7876640"," So do you buy this dip right here?"
"7877240","7877700"," No."
"7878800","7881880"," So this right here is the finger trap, right?"
"7882120","7883820"," This is what Mr. Yen teaches you guys. "
"7885240","7886680"," You did not buy that."
"7886920","7888460"," Well, you can buy that."
"7889560","7898760"," You can buy that if velocity is all negative or you can attempt to, but we're not in negative"
"7898760","7899660"," velocity right now. "
"7899800","7900780"," So you can't buy this."
"7902220","7903720"," When can you buy this?"
"7905160","7910380"," So cap when can we buy when that white line comes around and price gets above it again."
"7912040","7913320"," And test it. "
"7913500","7914520"," So you want to see this here?"
"7916700","7919960"," You want to see that right there and you want to see us start running."
"7920720","7923380"," That one right there and that one right there."
"7927900","7930540"," This is like a, there's like no go zone in here. "
"7931840","7938660"," Dude, this zone right here, I wouldn't be a buyer or a seller in here ever."
"7939100","7944740"," Like I do sometimes and I lose a lot, but this is like the no go zone right here."
"7944740","7946060"," No go zone. "
"7947000","7948640"," Buyers, sellers, doesn't matter."
"7948880","7949900"," You don't fuck around in here."
"7951420","7954140"," You fuck around below as a seller. "
"7954620","7959500"," You fuck around above as a buyer, but this is no go zone."
"7959740","7961000"," No, no, no, no."
"7961520","7965800"," There are times you can buy this, but this isn't one of those times. "
"7966880","7969640"," You need to be like capitulation down moves in the market."
"7975570","7977110"," And that's another good question."
"7977110","7980450"," Would you buy this as a bear to the downside right here too?"
"7980650","7981390"," Maybe we're at the top?"
"7982230","7983110"," Probably not. "
"7983290","7984990"," We're probably not at a top."
"7986210","7988230"," Where's likely top for a bear?"
"7988950","7991650"," When we start to see max bullishness, right?"
"7991870","7993450"," We're not quite seeing that yet, are we?"
"7994710","7997910"," Not quite seeing that max bear bearishness here."
"7998230","8000250"," And we know that the target is higher. "
"8001430","8003070"," We know the target is like."
"8007030","8008750"," Yeah, that might have been it."
"8008910","8010250"," That might have been the top for now. "
"8011570","8013270"," That might have been the top for now."
"8013730","8017510"," We came back and failed to switch over and show you that."
"8018610","8020630"," You can kind of see that right there, right?"
"8023730","8026830"," You know these sellers right here don't want you there, right?"
"8027090","8027950"," These guys right here. "
"8030250","8032510"," And that's where we are right now, right?"
"8033190","8037370"," These guys are like go fuck yourself, right?"
"8038750","8039690"," I'm up here."
"8040130","8040490"," Bam."
"8041150","8042690"," And what are they telling you right now?"
"8043030","8044490"," You shall not pass. "
"8045910","8048110"," What do you think it's going to take to get up there?"
"8050730","8052470"," What do you think it's going to take to get up there?"
"8052570","8053970"," Probably after hours."
"8057190","8063570"," Or it's going to take the hourly trigger to get us, our hourly velocity trigger to get us up there,"
"8063750","8063810"," right?"
"8066770","8068090"," Good chance of that."
"8075640","8078800"," I would be really interested right now. "
"8080720","8082560"," And another failure up here."
"8084500","8087320"," So bulls need a new high right here, right?"
"8088960","8091380"," So bulls need a new high right where we are."
"8092560","8094260"," That wouldn't shock me right there. "
"8095480","8097600"," That's that finger trap right there."
"8098420","8103340"," So my guess here is that the bulls are going to fail this right in here."
"8104300","8109480"," Now, if we get up here and this turns around, I'll take that trade right there. "
"8110700","8111980"," We ain't there yet, are we?"
"8112360","8113020"," We're not there yet."
"8113880","8116700"," This is what I'm afraid of is the role right here."
"8118720","8120280"," So no trade yet. "
"8124400","8125840"," No trade yet."
"8128480","8130780"," If we get a trade, I'll let you know."
"8132040","8134680"," If there's a trade, I will say something to you. "
"8141000","8142420"," Yeah, the gray love bar."
"8143880","8146060"," The gray love bar is way."
"8146220","8148240"," We bought the gray love bar earlier, right?"
"8148740","8150440"," The gray love bar was down here. "
"8153140","8154780"," There goes the gray love bar."
"8155760","8156580"," Hold on."
"8157340","8158180"," Main screen. "
"8161500","8163700"," Here's the gray sexy love bar right here."
"8163820","8167280"," They got hammered gray love bar right there."
"8167820","8168380"," Gone. "
"8169040","8171100"," See a cross right there."
"8175890","8178310"," Come back down right now to check it."
"8178770","8179130"," Bam. "
"8179990","8182170"," Check that five minute looking for more upside."
"8182750","8184850"," Target to the upside."
"8186930","8188150"," 450 43. "
"8191809","8193290"," Positioning is still long."
"8194770","8198250"," If you're long from down here, you're still long right now."
"8210410","8211290"," I think that's good. "
"8211410","8213170"," I'm going to leave this up just like closing here."
"8215230","8217070"," I don't know what is going on for me."
"8217809","8219530"," I'm going to leave that on for you. "
"8219930","8222870"," I'm going to leave that on for you for the rest of this morning."
"8224010","8225330"," Try to answer as much as I can."
"8226049","8230590"," Look forward next coming days to checking this thing out. "
"8232570","8234350"," And we have more coming down the road."
"8234450","8236490"," I got a bunch of stuff being developed right now."
"8236490","8238830"," A whole bunch of stuff in the background being developed right now for you. "
"8239090","8240790"," We're also going to look at Tesla really quick."

"8279840","8281100"," Next by point, right?"
"8281860","8282420"," Or Tesla."
"8283219","8287760"," If Tesla rolls, we know where the dips are two by."
"8288240","8295840"," But this is the place to put some put some put some Tesla on Tesla upside down. "
"8297000","8298799"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"8299600","8300760"," Tesla upside target."
"8301559","8305219"," Little bit of a roll right there and then 277 94. "
"8307440","8308920"," So if you're a Tesla trader."

"8319379","8321680"," Matter of fact, let's just go to a full screen and show it. "
"8322280","8324760"," I know you Tesla bulls want to tell your friends out there."
"8326059","8327639"," It's a one minute chart on Tesla."
"8329740","8331700"," Look at that gorgeousness right there. "
"8333620","8336080"," That gorgeous bam, bam, bam, bam bot."
"8337400","8339459"," I'm sitting on a 30 minute chart on Tesla."
"8339660","8340600"," Let's see what Tesla's saying. "
"8343559","8344980"," Tesla knocking on the door."
"8347100","8349340"," Always love the velocity on Tesla."
"8349520","8350120"," I love trading. "
"8352340","8355219"," The bottoms of daily velocity on Tesla."
"8355760","8357639"," Oh, yeah, look at that."
"8360000","8362260"," Look at that down there. "
"8362559","8362639"," Wow."
"8362879","8364059"," Look at that daily velocity."
"8364440","8367940"," Bulls love buying the low daily velocity. "
"8368540","8369520"," They love it."
"8370379","8371520"," They love it."
"8372059","8372780"," And look at that. "
"8372940","8375620"," You got your first indication that we're going higher right here."
"8376299","8379219"," Cranking, cranking, cranking, just now getting positive."
"8379219","8381540"," Some bullish on Tesla here. "
"8382379","8385219"," Looking for that second tag of 290 33."
"8387520","8390320"," Knocking on the door right now on Tesla."
"8391200","8392620"," Slamming on the door. "
"8394120","8397220"," As long as price stays above 271 33."
"8399020","8400520"," Going to expect."
"8402500","8405580"," A squeeze higher on Tesla. "
"8406350","8408340"," Get the new high at that 280."
"8409120","8411060"," And then make your way higher here."
"8414100","8417940"," To your next target above is 290 33. "
"8419160","8421480"," 290 33 on Tesla."
"8423220","8425940"," And you've got some, you've got some bullish just behind you."
"8426800","8427480"," You got some bull. "
"8427660","8430920"," I'm pretty bare, I'm pretty bullish here on Tesla."
"8435480","8437800"," Starting to squeeze higher right now."
"8439040","8439880"," On. "
"8441280","8441860"," Spoons."
"8449680","8453120"," Staying inside day trader trend right here."
"8455060","8457120"," Dips to be bought on triggers. "
"8457900","8458740"," Velocity looks great."
"8464570","8466110"," Not bad, huh?"
"8467270","8468250"," Not bad, huh?"
"8469710","8472010"," Not too shabby."
"8475170","8477330"," R2, lending some support right now. "
"8477410","8478370"," Your daily pivots."
"8481010","8483110"," Lending support to that upside move."
"8483910","8490010"," By the way, you're going to get, you're going to get pivots for every ticker in the stock market. "
"8492190","8493630"," So whatever you're trading."
"8500000","8502500"," So you'll also have access to pivots."
"8507820","8509300"," I think we get the 390. "
"8509900","8513160"," I would exit below on Tesla."
"8513540","8514600"," I would exit below."
"8517280","8521380"," So as long as you stay above that, as long as you stay above the hourly. "
"8522360","8524100"," Trend is still your friend."
"8524900","8526780"," So who asked that about Tesla ready?"
"8528120","8530120"," You're going to get this tool from me."
"8530620","8532480"," You want to hear something super fucking cool. "
"8533760","8537400"," When you get this tool, you can set an alert on your phone."
"8537700","8538280"," So it's a good one."
"8538640","8539640"," So who asked that question?"
"8539700","8540700"," Who asked that question up there?"
"8541200","8542040"," Where we roam?"
"8543420","8549640"," If you have this tool right now, you could set an alert on the hourly trigger to sell the hourly"
"8549640","8551720"," trigger if there's a role under it. "
"8552180","8555820"," That will tell you when trend is over for Tesla."
"8556160","8559500"," So if you're, so where your room just set up 200% of my Tesla calls."
"8560400","8561660"," We break hourly trigger. "
"8562060","8565020"," You sell your calls until then you can run them all the way up."
"8565280","8567620"," Personally, I wouldn't, but you can."
"8568040","8570840"," That will work for you if you're up that much on your, on your calls. "
"8571620","8573340"," Personally, I wouldn't present at some point."
"8573580","8576680"," I like to take money and run on those trades, realize profit."
"8577380","8580420"," And then maybe reenter on a retest of the hourly trigger. "
"8580900","8584140"," You know, like you take the money off the table 200% you just made."
"8584800","8589800"," And then on a test of the hourly trigger, you go back in and, and renegotiate that trade again."
"8591200","8591920"," Does that make sense?"
"8593020","8593800"," Realize your money. "
"8594480","8597800"," If you just may, if you just put in a thousand bucks and you just made a 3000."
"8599780","8604960"," Then you should be taking all that money off the table and renegotiate with a thousand bucks on the"
"8604960","8605460"," hourly trigger."
"8608040","8608800"," Does that make sense?"
"8613530","8614450"," Yeah, we're down brother. "
"8615690","8616590"," Yeah, and take that."
"8616810","8618390"," I mean, here's the beat would be the example."
"8618390","8620410"," So let's go back to the Tesla, right?"
"8621310","8624730"," So right now at, um, right now it's that resistance, right?"
"8625530","8627410"," You take the money on the squeeze higher. "
"8628470","8630590"," When it comes back down to test that level."
"8631350","8632390"," That two 78."
"8632670","8635610"," And if it holds, uh, if it holds, right?"
"8635930","8638070"," You can reenter some more call spreads for 290. "
"8648160","8649060"," Well, that's too nice."
"8649320","8649940"," Keep saying to."
"8650260","8652540"," I wish it's 290. "
"8664310","8665570"," Realize those gains, man."
"8665810","8666470"," Without a doubt."
"8666550","8672070"," Realize those gains because, uh, it matters, man. "
"8672230","8673130"," It totally matters."
"8683680","8684940"," It totally matters."
"8685280","8686220"," Like that, that two 80. "
"8686540","8687320"," Take it on the two 80."
"8687560","8688780"," And then take it again."
"8688940","8690000"," I'm from 280 to 290. "
"8690500","8691720"," And then take it again."
"8693120","8694360"," I get what you say."
"8694500","8695300"," I'm looking at it right now. "
"8695360","8697000"," I'm looking at tests right now."
"8697000","8697920"," I'm like, I see the squeeze."
"8699240","8701440"," I see the squeeze to 290. "
"8703100","8706800"," I see the squeeze to what?"
"8708540","8711300"," My one issue is, uh, my one issue here is."
"8713200","8715600"," Well, you've got volatility here at."
"8716100","8718580"," You have volatility at two 79. "
"8720680","8722620"," You have volatility at two 79."
"8723780","8725500"," You'll likely get a pull back there."
"8726080","8728640"," And then you've got volatility at 290. "
"8730100","8735280"," The idea there would be that they would come in at like two 88 and rule you down."
"8739360","8741580"," It would probably be a big roll down."
"8741760","8745320"," You're going to need the daily trigger and the hourly to break above that price. "
"8746600","8749140"," You're definitely going to need the help of the daily trigger to get up there."
"8750900","8752680"," We're at the daily, but the hourly at least."
"8764840","8766120"," So where are we at trade right now?"
"8766300","8766420"," 275. "
"8768540","8776000"," Yeah, like today's today's expectation, probably to two 78 is where I take the money."
"8776480","8777980"," But you could easily get 282."
"8781840","8784820"," Something like that, 282, but it's so risky up there, man. "
"8784940","8785200"," They come in."
"8785320","8786740"," They just sell the fuck out of that shit."
"8787280","8792000"," It's like Tesla's like one of those tickers where they sell you before you get to your target. "
"8792720","8794460"," Usually like two bucks before your target."
"8794460","8797320"," They just come in and it's like red bar to hell."
"8797580","8798860"," Even if you're going to break above. "
"8799740","8803380"," It's like red bar to hell and then it's like you need a big push to get there."
"8807700","8808560"," Yeah, still talking."
"8808640","8809220"," I got to get out of here. "
"8809280","8809680"," I'm out of here."
"8809720","8810420"," I'm going to go back to work."
"8811000","8811360"," Okay. "
"8811760","8812960"," I got to work on this shit."
"8813120","8815500"," So I'm going to leave you guys and put some."
"8815740","8817820"," I'm going to put on Bloomberg radio. "
"8818700","8822460"," If you don't like Bloomberg radio, just mute the radio."
"8823740","8826140"," Or mute this show."
"8827800","8829940"," And I'll check in at key moments. "
"8829980","8830400"," Okay."
"8834490","8837270"," With Bloomberg, you get the story behind the story."
"8837550","8838410"," The story behind the. "
"8838510","8841090"," And know that the website is launching imminently."
"8841290","8842950"," Imminently website launch."
"8844530","8846970"," You get context and context changes everything. "
"8847410","8849310"," Go to Bloomberg.com to get context."
"8849310","8850870"," Labor Relations Board."
"8851230","8856330"," If successful, the move could be the first division one in college athletics to unionize. "
"8856550","8857230"," What is it?"
"8857430","8858090"," What's up with that?"
"8859190","8864870"," I mean football players in Northwestern previously sought to unionize in 2014 a move that"
"8864870","8870890"," ultimately was dismissed by the National Labor Relations Board due to the then status of athletes"
"8870890","8872770"," not being classified as university employees."
"8872770","8875850"," I mean, so now they're classified as employees."
"8876250","8877830"," They get paid to play basketball. "
"8878370","8880530"," We can get paid through the name, image and likeness."
"8880950","8881050"," Right."
"8881250","8881910"," That's the difference. "
"8882070","8883090"," That's different than getting paid."
"8883310","8886350"," You get like an hourly to get a bonus for a dunk."
"8887570","8888590"," Is that possible?"
"8888830","8890790"," You can't pay the men's basketball team. "
"8890990","8891050"," Right."
"8891230","8895450"," Then you have to pay like the women's underwater basket."
"8895590","8896250"," I don't know. "
"8896470","8897450"," I don't know how this is going to play out."
"8897530","8898830"," That's why this kind of jumped out of me."
"8898990","8900810"," But the good folks up at Dartmouth. "
"8900810","8904510"," They're going to try this thing and maybe get paid for playing hoops."
"8904730","8905450"," Who knew you could do that?"
"8905790","8906410"," A little more coming up."

"8935590","8938030"," There's still some concern out there in the market that there is."
"8938150","8940210"," So far, do you have to hide failure?"
"8940370","8942050"," We've got this new high right now. "
"8942050","8945610"," As small high-sized businesses struggle, they don't present as much competition."
"8946150","8946810"," The supply chain is doing it."

"9148470","9149330"," Let's look at these markets. "
"9149550","9150550"," We got green on the screen here."
"9150550","9151350"," Charlie is just reporting."
"9152250","9153990"," So we want to get some color. "
"9154310","9155410"," Alex Simonova joins us."
"9155470","9157630"," She covers all the equities for Bloomberg News."
"9157910","9159890"," She joins us here on Bloomberg Interactive Broker Studio. "
"9160090","9160810"," Alex, what are you looking at?"
"9160930","9165670"," Yeah, I mean, Paul, Matt, everyone is on the edge of their seat right now waiting for arm holding"
"9165670","9167530"," shares to become available for trading."
"9168150","9170350"," First we were thinking 10, 20 a.m. Then 11."
"9170710","9171610"," Now it's past noon. "
"9171810","9174470"," Everyone's still kind of waiting for that first trade."
"9174710","9179830"," It's indicated to open at about $56 per share in this much anticipated debut."
"9179830","9183330"," That's above the $51 per share is priced by arm. "
"9183650","9187710"," It already sold 95.5 million in depository shares."
"9188250","9191590"," Investors in the IPO included some of arm's biggest customers."
"9191730","9197390"," It said aside more than $700 million of its stock for Intel, apple and video. "
"9198370","9202590"," Samsung, but of course, soft bank still controls 90% of arm shares."
"9202590","9209350"," And this is this IPO is the world's biggest this year surpassing the $4.4 billion listing by"
"9209350","9212910"," Johnson and Johnson's consumer health spinoff can view."
"9213110","9218090"," It could also be a catalyst for IPOs from dozens of startups that have kind of been on the"
"9218090","9222590"," sidelines in what's been the deepest and longest drought since 2009. "
"9222850","9229050"," Some others on deck include Instacart, Birkenstock as everyone kind of waits for the IPO market to"
"9229050","9229590"," reawaken."
"9229590","9232030"," It had been back in the past $63."
"9232670","9232790"," Yeah. "
"9233250","9235850"," Back at 10.20. So the back and down a little."
"9235910","9241050"," And then it was indicated to open at 58 and then 57 and now 56."
"9241910","9245930"," So I guess, you know, sometimes as they take longer. "
"9246210","9248550"," Remember with Facebook, it took them until the afternoon."
"9248650","9252270"," And that was a real problem for the opening price."
"9254170","9258390"," And, but if only, you know, if only I backed up the truck at that point. "
"9258570","9259150"," Yes, exactly."
"9259390","9262290"," So the question and I don't know because I don't want the perspective in front of me who the"
"9262290","9263430"," stabilizing agent in this."
"9263490","9267930"," Who's the underwriter that's in charge for literally physically opening the trading of the stock"
"9267930","9272330"," and will handle most of the orders on the first day, which is a good place to make a lot"
"9272330","9272930"," of money doing that. "
"9273850","9274810"," And that's kind of thing."
"9274890","9276230"," What else are you looking at, Alex?"
"9276410","9277250"," It's not just IPOs."
"9277370","9278590"," There's other stuff going on. "
"9278730","9278950"," Yeah."
"9280490","9286250"," Another stock that I'm watching today is Delta shares are down today about 8% the last time I last"
"9286250","9287150"," last glance."
"9287610","9292770"," That's after the company reduced its expectations for third quarter profit, citing higher fuel"
"9292770","9295630"," prices and larger than expected maintenance costs. "
"9296290","9299750"," Adjusted profit will be 185 to 205 a share."
"9299990","9302990"," That's compared to an earlier outlook for as much as 250 a share."
"9303190","9305610"," These are big misses that we've seen from these airline companies. "
"9305610","9306130"," It is."
"9306250","9311850"," But the reason that this share move isn't lower is because there was some sort of expectation of"
"9311850","9312650"," this among investors."
"9313150","9318910"," First, the company did reaffirm its guidance for a full year profit of $6 to $7 per share. "
"9319290","9325270"," But also other carriers have been cutting profit margin guidance on a 34% increase in jet fuel"
"9325270","9326250"," costs this quarter."
"9326690","9331650"," Yesterday we had American Airlines do that along with some discount carriers warning that their"
"9331650","9334170"," quarterly results would come in below initial expectations."
"9334690","9336750"," Investors kind of saw this coming with Delta. "
"9337050","9339290"," There was a bit of a relief rally at the open."
"9339490","9343470"," And now that share move is lower, but not as not as bad as you would think."
"9344070","9344670"," All right. "
"9344890","9349930"," So airlines getting hit again today and it's I don't think a huge surprise with the rise in crude."
"9350730","9359310"," And I imagine jet fuel is is following along almost all of the oil, gasoline and fuel products are"
"9359310","9360110"," up today."
"9360110","9365110"," In terms of other movers, HP Hewlett Packard is down today. "
"9365330","9365910"," What's going on there?"
"9366210","9371610"," Yeah, that stock is down more than 2% extending losses for a third day."
"9371710","9377990"," That's after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed that it sold $158.5 million worth of"
"9377990","9379490"," shares of the PC maker."
"9380170","9385590"," Bloomberg intelligence analysts say that this reinforces rising concerns about the printer maker's"
"9385590","9388370"," ability to stabilize and grow free cash flow. "
"9388370","9391650"," And there have also been concerns, of course, about its printing business."
"9392090","9393610"," I mean, it's tough time."
"9393630","9395850"," No one is really using printers anymore. "
"9395850","9396890"," I guess outside the office."
"9396890","9399730"," So for Cowell Masser, Cowell Masser is still."
"9399930","9400410"," That's true. "
"9400630","9402370"," She is really a piece of paper."
"9402530","9402610"," Yes."
"9402730","9403650"," And David Weston as well. "
"9403790","9406870"," They are still paper intensive hosts."
"9407170","9408670"," But there are very few."
"9408830","9410970"," You know, I have been here for the 23 years. "
"9410990","9414610"," So I remember when all of our scripts were printed."
"9414610","9417830"," I remember when all of our notes were printed."
"9418630","9421610"," And now it just seems like a waste. "
"9421990","9422090"," Yeah."
"9422250","9425310"," You know, I got to say I'm a little bit of a hypocrite because I actually have."
"9425550","9427030"," So I know it's printed too. "
"9427350","9428990"," But you're logged into the terminal."
"9429250","9430190"," Why do you need to print your notes?"
"9430230","9430590"," I don't know."
"9430790","9433390"," There's something about just physically holding a piece of paper. "
"9433570","9436430"," I will get Cowell Masser in here and just really hear about her."
"9436750","9437790"," We need to find her first."
"9437990","9440170"," Her desk is just covered with books and papers. "
"9440170","9443010"," She sounds, I don't know, sailing the seven seas somewhere."
"9443170","9443750"," I don't know where she is."
"9443750","9443950"," True. "
"9444250","9444370"," Yeah."
"9444570","9445630"," So we'll track her down."
"9445910","9446210"," All right. "
"9446430","9448010"," Alex, thanks so much for joining us."
"9448010","9452410"," Alex Seminova, Bloomberg covering the equity markets for us."
"9452590","9455750"," Again, a nice move in the S&P 500 up to 7.10. So 1%. "
"9456290","9458630"," We had some retail sales come out this morning."
"9458990","9461510"," And I thought they were pretty darn good."
"9461990","9467130"," You look at retail sales better than expected a little bit weaker than last month. "
"9467290","9467970"," But still pretty solid."
"9468130","9469650"," I don't know."
"9469650","9471010"," You use the Ecan function?"
"9471390","9472710"," No, it's just using Eco. "
"9473010","9475650"," E-C-A-N-Go."
"9475950","9476150"," Okay."
"9476390","9478090"," It's a new function on the Bloomberg terminal. "
"9478690","9479110"," You're pitching it."
"9479150","9480950"," It's the world economic analyzer."
"9481190","9482850"," I absolutely love it. "
"9483150","9483390"," Okay."
"9483430","9484390"," So I'm looking at retail sales."
"9484650","9484750"," Okay. "
"9484970","9486370"," You can drop down menu."
"9486550","9487650"," You can look at, you know, CPI."
"9488430","9489770"," You can look at PCE. "
"9490050","9491010"," You can look at retail sales."
"9491370","9491770"," I think we have."
"9491870","9494630"," Hey, we have arm opening opening at 55. "
"9494790","9498530"," Well, we're trading at $55.75 today right now."
"9498530","9500090"," It priced at 51."
"9500830","9502710"," So a nice little lift off of there. "
"9502810","9503450"," So we got that open."
"9503630","9506230"," You know, roughly around 12.09 PM Wall Street time."
"9506430","9507770"," So we'll keep an eye on that arm. "
"9507890","9508290"," All right."
"9508390","9509310"," Here we go, baby."
"9509730","9511150"," Four dollars and 90 cents. "
"9511310","9511690"," Arm."
"9512350","9512450"," Okay."
"9512830","9514030"," So here's what I'm going to do with this. "
"9514230","9515890"," I'm going to stay here on your spot."
"9516090","9516770"," Hold on a second."
"9517030","9517390"," Thread needle. "
"9518070","9519390"," I know you spent a lot."
"9521230","9523410"," Hold on here, boys and girls."
"9524870","9525270"," Yeah. "
"9525470","9526450"," Thanks for having me."
"9526450","9527970"," I think that the July."
"9529290","9530730"," We've got arm. "
"9532990","9535350"," What do we know about arm, right?"
"9536110","9538550"," Let's take a look at what we know about arm."
"9543430","9545170"," Fifty one dollars."
"9545790","9547610"," This is what retailers are at. "
"9557720","9566440"," They're also at $47.51. Here's the opening one minute bar on arm."
"9567300","9568640"," You guys want to do this together?"
"9568720","9570200"," Are you guys interested in this or no?"
"9570960","9571400"," Okay."
"9571460","9571860"," How about this?"
"9572020","9574260"," I'm going to go back to spy for you. "
"9576820","9577680"," Hold on one second."
"9577840","9578560"," I got you guys covered."
"9578780","9579840"," We'll stay on spy for you. "
"9580100","9581140"," You guys are all trade and spy."
"9581980","9585060"," I'm going to do a different window with arm on it."
"9586080","9592100"," Like all the, all the, like all like the Tesla, and NVDA bulls. "
"9593600","9600700"," They're all pissed off at the moment because they're not going to want to compete with arm today."
"9601000","9603000"," All the day traders going to go over and trade arm."
"9603920","9606460"," So be careful of a role here on the marketplace. "
"9609120","9612300"," And seriously be careful of a role here in the marketplace."
"9616020","9617380"," Hold on one second here."
"9619900","9623340"," Be careful because everybody's going to do the new shiny, shiny ring. "
"9624140","9626420"," So what we'll do is we'll switch back and forth."
"9629400","9631780"," Let me see if I can do this twice here."
"9633320","9636200"," I'm going to switch back and forth between arm and spoons. "
"9636460","9636520"," Okay."
"9637940","9639000"," So here's arm."
"9643290","9646230"," So what can we decipher ready?"
"9647830","9651370"," What can we decipher from arm off the opening bell?"
"9653130","9656510"," We got a hot, we got known sellers right there. "
"9656630","9658330"," We got known demand right there."
"9659630","9660270"," Right?"
"9660930","9661670"," Demand right here."
"9662250","9665390"," Buyers or buyer, buyer, buyer, seller, seller. "
"9666230","9668870"," What would be the upside and downside targets?"
"9670450","9672870"," Always big fat round numbers, right?"
"9672870","9675070"," So we're opening here at 56."
"9676250","9678510"," So you're going to be looking for 60 bucks up here."
"9679150","9681550"," And then to the downside, you're going to be looking for 55. "
"9684230","9686470"," I can already have that 55, right?"
"9686970","9693010"," We got the 51 up there, so we're going to go with 65."
"9693630","9694150"," Is there a next one?"
"9694490","9695810"," You guys ever trade this stuff?"
"9695970","9697210"," You guys ever not a trade an IPO?"
"9698330","9700910"," I don't know if you guys know how to trade an IPO or not."
"9700910","9704410"," But we're going to we'll trade it together if you want. "
"9712270","9713990"," Spoons squeezing right now."
"9714350","9718350"," Spoons squeezing trying to get to PT three at 450 43."
"9727720","9729580"," Arm trying to squeeze right now. "
"9729620","9732280"," We've got a three trigger cluster on arm to the upside."
"9733260","9734340"," Hold on one second here."
"9737640","9739060"," One quick second here. "
"9739140","9741380"," We're going to go over to the chart down below."
"9741960","9744880"," So look at the chart down to the bottom left-hand side of your screen."
"9745360","9746960"," This is arm right here. "
"9747480","9749480"," And we're going to do this arm together."
"9749800","9757280"," Okay, as a one minute chart on arm, while these people trade spy, we're going to trade arm"
"9757280","9757860"," together."
"9758380","9762660"," So right down here on arm, we've got a base of 55, 54. "
"9763520","9769420"," We've got a price target to the upside of $58 just below it right here."
"9770360","9775340"," We've got another big target above of $60 right up here."
"9778100","9779780"," Major target to the upside. "
"9780740","9784560"," You're going to call this one right here PT one."
"9787060","9788140"," You guys see this?"
"9788300","9788940"," Yeah, you can see this."
"9793990","9798230"," You have a price target right here PT one of $60. "
"9801970","9806050"," Bias is to the upside right now to break above 58."
"9807530","9815110"," And then smash into 59.98. As long as we trade the six EMA all the way up, your dip"
"9815110","9818130"," by right now is down below on."
"9819390","9826030"," 56.65. If 56.65 gives it up right down there. "
"9826230","9827970"," This is your watch this box down here."
"9828750","9831270"," This box down here is going to be trend over."
"9831430","9831650"," Okay. "
"9832910","9834150"," And we'll readjust this."
"9834510","9835070"," Hold on a second here."
"9838510","9841790"," I also want you to remember the time when we opened. "
"9842190","9843290"," We opened at 12."
"9843290","9843930"," Okay."
"9844550","9847870"," So make sure you're watching the half hour on arm. "
"9848210","9848390"," Okay."
"9849430","9851310"," Make sure you're watching the half an hour."
"9851450","9854350"," Make sure you're using a clock when trading arm. "
"9856930","9859990"," So arm has 14 minutes to make a new high."
"9860250","9861770"," Have not made that high yet."
"9862890","9864270"," First target $60. "
"9864710","9868450"," If you want to know what target I think it's going to hit at least 100 bucks."
"9868450","9874390"," I think when I think it goes to at least 100 about three to five sessions likely of going up."
"9874650","9877610"," And then a major role on that ticker. "
"9877930","9881570"," I am expecting a big role in that ticker, but about a hundred bucks to start."
"9881930","9883490"," Possibly 150 125."
"9886330","9892930"," Look at spy baby spy just smashed into our three right now. "
"9892930","9894270"," Whoa."
"9895210","9900690"," Arm trading 58 27 58 30 trying to trade up and trade $60."
"9903430","9907250"," Spy just smashing and bashing in on our three right now. "
"9907970","9908590"," Whoa."
"9909570","9915990"," Spy needs to get above for 50 43 to make its way to the next level."
"9915990","9925330"," Look for a pullback on spy at some point. "
"9926170","9929020"," For a dip by down below at 448 78."
"9929830","9932570"," Keep your eyes on 448 78 on spoons."
"9932910","9935210"," As we have hit our three. "
"9935970","9940290"," If you are looking for the next target on spoons to the upside."
"9940410","9942770"," If you're looking for an xtx cell."
"9943210","9944550"," If you know what that means. "
"9944550","9948970"," Your next upside target is 452 76."
"9951210","9959370"," Arm trading 58 75 right now looking for 59.98. If you're trading arm right now watch that down the"
"9959370","9960810"," bottom left hand side of your screen."
"9962270","9965610"," We're going to go to a 30 minute chart right now on spoons. "
"9967590","9971030"," We're going to show you guys the next target."
"9971970","9974930"," So keep your eyes on spoons to the upside."
"9975230","9976070"," If that's what you're trading. "
"9976870","9981290"," You've got some minor trouble ahead but still minor."
"9981930","9984170"," Just a thin yellow line right there right."
"9985070","9990070"," The major squeeze though is above 451 17. "
"9990970","9992590"," And you will trade."
"9995170","9999050"," This is your actual s tx cell right here."
"9999650","10002450"," Is going to be 452 72. "
"10002990","10005590"," 452 72 is our four."
"10006150","10006950"," We'll just write it."
"10007030","10008510"," We'll just write s tx cell on that. "
"10018550","10021270"," s tx s tx cell 452."
"10023330","10026330"," That's one standard deviation all the way up right there."
"10027030","10029070"," So 452 72. "
"10029070","10030770"," You've got some stuff over here."
"10031110","10033130"," This is a squeeze zone in here too."
"10034770","10037130"," They don't like this squeeze zone right. "
"10037770","10039330"," First time we attempt to squeeze."
"10039870","10040850"," Normally it fails."
"10045670","10048250"," Squeeze zone right in here okay. "
"10051510","10056250"," Arm going up to trade PT one right now at $60."
"10057550","10060050"," Be careful as we hit these."
"10060710","10061730"," We are going to roll. "
"10061890","10062770"," You're going to see panic."
"10063690","10065010"," You will see panic."
"10065010","10070350"," You're going to look for a dip by down below on 57 94. "

"10081630","10083410"," There's that x tx cell. "
"10085030","10086610"," There's your squeeze zone."
"10093610","10099010"," R3 target hit on spoos a day early."

"10130660","10131560"," one right here."
"10131560","10140100"," Look for a pullback up down and look to hold 58 52 to make the next level. "
"10140720","10142220"," So arm right here."
"10142260","10143320"," I'm going to show you two places."
"10143560","10150180"," There's your first one and there is your second one right here to go up. "
"10151040","10152940"," Two places to buy the dip."

"10171200","10181900"," If you're trading arm, I want you to realize that as we tag high big zeros, there"
"10181900","10183600"," can be violent moves down. "
"10183600","10189740"," Another thing to remember about arm is that as it trades up in the day."
"10190820","10191460"," Waynes."
"10192460","10196840"," You'll get violent moves down doesn't necessarily mean that it's bearish. "
"10197120","10199640"," But people will take their money and go home."
"10200560","10204400"," So you might be trying to trade arm at three thirty in the afternoon two thirty in the afternoon."
"10204960","10207700"," And arm will just sell off. "
"10208300","10209640"," So be careful."
"10209920","10210800"," It's very volatile."
"10210800","10213520"," Your next target to the upside. "
"10213520","10214800"," Sixty five."
"10217420","10218700"," Not relenting."

"10220820","10225320"," I'm going to give it a hundred dollar ninety eight dollars with a major pullback."
"10225840","10230180"," And then you're going to see probably one twenty five as a topish somewhere in there."
"10230880","10233340"," One twenty five, maybe one fifty. "
"10234300","10235140"," But that shit ain't holding."
"10235440","10236800"," So do not believe."
"10236800","10241760"," Don't be buying arm at one twenty five and thinking that you're you're you're the rocket scientist"
"10241760","10242560"," smart guy. "
"10242720","10243960"," They're going to sell that shit on you."
"10246740","10248320"," You are a seller."
"10249500","10250980"," Right this right here. "

"10365260","10367380"," Let me take a look at all those real quick."
"10368780","10373060"," HYG flattening out a little bit right now trying to hold its 27 EMA."
"10373580","10375760"," It's looking it's looking a little long in the tooth. "
"10375760","10376280"," Isn't it?"
"10376780","10377380"," HYG."
"10377520","10379060"," It's not looking so healthy right now."
"10379720","10382080"," Dixie looking bullish right now right?"
"10383000","10385900"," Dixie just muscle it along looking pretty bullish here. "
"10386020","10387320"," Dixie wanting to trade higher."
"10389500","10394140"," Nasdaq coming back down a trade and test its five minute 27 EMA."
"10395000","10395600"," VIX. "
"10396620","10399120"," Somebody get the shovel out for VIX."
"10400300","10401600"," Who wants the VIX apocalypse?"
"10402200","10404100"," Who wants to see VIX trade five bucks?"
"10404100","10407100"," The VIX trade in 1305."
"10408120","10417680"," Known support on VIX is that $12.85. Known support on VIX at"
"10417680","10419100"," 1305. "
"10420000","10425260"," Tesla rolling over right now and it's one minute trigger coming back down right now."
"10425740","10427620"," Be careful on arm here."
"10428220","10429780"," I want to tell you something about arm. "
"10429960","10430900"," Watch this on arm."
"10432720","10436800"," I would not be a buyer below this yellow line."
"10436940","10437540"," See this up?"
"10438300","10439120"," Making these yellow. "
"10439300","10442520"," These shouldn't be yellow, but that should be white."
"10444380","10446060"," Clean this up for you right here."
"10447620","10448500"," Right there. "
"10448740","10449140"," That's better."
"10449260","10449580"," That's better."
"10450700","10451600"," I like that. "
"10451760","10452080"," That's better."

"10456640","10457700"," A seller below there. "
"10458410","10461080"," This is major support right here on arm."
"10461240","10462000"," That's major support."
"10463660","10468160"," We'll just do that right there. "
"10468760","10474160"," Instead of doing PT, we'll do text S1."
"10474640","10479400"," So S1 right now on arm is right here."
"10480140","10487740"," And then we've got S2 right here"
"10487740","10500140"," on arm. "
"10501860","10505220"," And then we've got S3 right here."
"10507500","10512840"," I guess we can make these R."
"10513140","10517380"," I'm saying they're support, but more in reality, they're more like resistance."
"10517780","10518920"," Let's call that R3. "
"10520360","10522720"," Let's call that R3 or R2."
"10526690","10528170"," Save that one up there."
"10530070","10531730"," Make that one right there. "
"10532590","10535270"," Make that one R R1."
"10539360","10540500"," That's R1."
"10541160","10543220"," This is known support, right?"
"10543380","10544760"," So that's S1 down there. "
"10548040","10549120"," We got a plan."
"10550080","10550780"," It's been open."
"10550780","10555080"," We got a plan. "
"10555840","10558200"," Test 2 to the downside on arm."
"10559800","10562500"," Right at 50, make it nice and simple."
"10565400","10566860"," There's S2. "
"10576260","10578800"," Same thing applies here, right?"
"10579660","10582080"," Same thing applies here for arm."
"10583840","10587220"," We want to see this R1 hold."
"10596570","10597690"," I'm going to leave that. "
"10597810","10599630"," Let me see if you guys can all see that right there."
"10599930","10600810"," That's all good right there."
"10605540","10608320"," It's Spy holding its 27 EMA right now. "
"10612920","10614780"," Big old cell on this one."
"10615020","10616640"," Find out if we got buyers here or not."
"10621740","10624000"," Reverse split on VIX. "
"10639620","10641100"," Okay, I'll be back with you."
"10641600","10643480"," You guys should be good right now, right?"
"10643620","10644460"," You got everything you need."
"10645780","10649620"," I don't think there's anything else that you need here, except for this stuff here. "
"10649640","10651060"," You guys got everything you need right here."
"10651200","10651640"," R3."
"10652860","10654500"," We got R2 down here. "
"10655320","10656360"," You guys know where that is."
"10657040","10658220"," All right, we're good."
"10666200","10668100"," There you go, there's arm, baby. "
"10669180","10670460"," You got to start to arm."
"10670660","10670920"," That's good."
"10672380","10674940"," You got some structure, something to work off, right?"
"10675760","10677460"," You got something to work off on arm. "
"10679940","10683060"," Dude, VIX just took a nose dive."
"10685280","10691980"," You know what, VIX is sitting on other known support too."
"10691980","10695620"," I should have mentioned this, so VIX is actually sitting. "
"10696300","10701780"," I'm going to expect some downside here on Spy really quick."
"10714240","10717200"," I'm going to expect Spy some role here in Spy."
"10717360","10717760"," Be careful. "
"10721420","10722700"," Check this here."
"10726540","10731040"," Yeah, next known support after 1303 is 1285."
"10731780","10741680"," And then below 1285 is 1273. "
"10748720","10750340"," Careful of a market role here."
"10752000","10757560"," Give me a super solid and be careful of a market role."
"10758140","10760700"," So it would look like a failure here. "
"10762080","10764120"," You'd get up there and then there'd be a failure."
"10764640","10765620"," We're getting close."
"10765860","10767260"," We're getting a little long in the tooth here. "
"10767340","10767880"," We're getting there."
"10769900","10775220"," Yeah, that 450.89. And there goes that squeeze zone."
"10775800","10778440"," Maybe we catch the squeeze and then it rolls. "
"10781060","10787240"," It's possible we could do like major squeeze here and then a giant sell the news up here."
"10787420","10789920"," So be really cautious."
"10789920","10794020"," If you are long for this, have designated. "
"10794020","10798240"," I'm selling and they're going to try to sell that specifically on you."
"10798320","10798840"," They're not going to lie."
"10798960","10800020"," They don't want you to get the squeeze. "
"10800560","10807700"," So be really careful of a role at 451.17 on any kind of a squeeze."
"10808720","10813820"," So it would look like you'd look like a squeeze up here and then boom."
"10814120","10815360"," Red candle straight down. "
"10815360","10817120"," But they call them tweezers."
"10818100","10822900"," So you'll like see a major green bar up and then a red bar."
"10824300","10825300"," Straight down. "
"10825380","10825640"," Okay."
"10826120","10826840"," Deps of health."
"10827040","10831120"," So have like a defined cell zone if we get up there right now. "
"10839120","10841900"," And leave this up so you can see it."
"10868210","10869570"," You see that on stream."
"10869890","10870390"," Yeah, there you go. "
"10871370","10872130"," That's better."
"10878100","10881780"," Apple now coming into a one hour."
"10882660","10887300"," So just heads up here that apple is now on an hourly basis. "
"10888140","10889540"," Looking to trade 178."
"10891180","10893860"," 67 as long as it stays above."
"10894720","10896580"," 175 and 56. "
"10898480","10901360"," Apple looking to reverse to the upside right now."
"10901420","10903720"," Believe it or not on an hourly basis."
"10905840","10906400"," Apple. "
"10909480","10919360"," Needs to stay above 175.53 to trade 178.97. Any role below that 175.13. Do not buy it."
"10927220","10927940"," Yeah, dude."
"10928120","10929120"," I don't know like on the. "
"10931860","10933120"," Take a look at this."
"10933460","10934660"," I've mixed down here."
"10936960","10946870"," I'm going to"
"10946870","10948850"," make a warning to you guys out there. "
"10948850","10949190"," Okay."
"10949790","10951530"," Listen closely."
"10957030","10958530"," I'm on a two hour chart. "
"10958810","10959710"," I'm watching Vix."
"10960930","10962010"," 1273."
"10964790","10969930"," Is the low from June 22nd. "
"10972090","10975130"," Things get wild down there."
"10975390","10975590"," Okay."
"10976190","10976310"," Wild. "
"10978550","10982290"," Be really, really, really careful."
"10994500","10996840"," So that 1273."
"10997540","11000220"," I mean, that Vix dude is right at a bottom. "
"11003760","11006180"," It is so close."
"11009260","11012980"," Be really careful here of a role in the market."
"11012980","11014520"," Be really careful here. "
"11017600","11018520"," Really, truly."
"11027640","11028360"," Yeah, dude."
"11028560","11029360"," Volmageddon, baby. "
"11030440","11031820"," You know it, Volmageddon."
"11034020","11036480"," Nice tweezer trade to the upside right here."
"11036680","11038320"," Two nice bars on arm. "
"11038560","11039900"," We'll see if it resolves to the upside."
"11041180","11044720"," If you want to buy arm, you're looking for this cross up to the upside."
"11044940","11046540"," You want to get above the screen bar first. "
"11047120","11048880"," You need to get above this right here."
"11057510","11059910"," Oh yeah, be super careful here."
"11060070","11061310"," Super careful. "
"11062330","11063690"," Super, super careful."
"11064170","11065430"," If you're a seller, let me know."
"11065550","11068210"," Are you guys getting all beared up right now?"
"11069410","11070270"," I would be. "
"11071690","11073370"," I'd be getting kind of bearish here."
"11074890","11077430"," If I was a bear, I'd be getting kind of bearish."
"11079950","11081890"," Jimmy Barry, what are you thinking here, man?"
"11083330","11084890"," What's your take right now, Jimmy?"
"11097120","11102720"," Thirty minute triggers that Max Bullish hourly trigger is not, but it's getting close. "
"11103540","11108160"," That thirty minute trigger that we sold on is Max Max Bullish right now."
"11112600","11116920"," Remember on arm, you need to be above this top green box to take along on it."
"11117480","11120420"," This one right here, this top green box right here. "
"11120420","11121620"," You need to be above it."
"11167940","11169100"," What do you think, Jimmy?"
"11170960","11172940"," Yeah, it all depends on Dixie."
"11173260","11175160"," Yeah, I'm watching Dixie too. "
"11175740","11180120"," Dixie is just fucking moving right now, $5.28 currently."
"11180120","11183320"," And we also have got Dixie going up."

"12313810","12316070"," And Bailey, I'm telling you, I'm looking at this arm thing here."
"12316390","12317870"," Price of $51 to share."
"12318330","12319590"," Stock's trading at 60 bucks. "
"12319810","12320770"," It's only 18%."
"12320770","12321590"," That's pretty darn good."
"12321870","12323010"," Yeah, really strong debut. "
"12323430","12327450"," What we reported was a roughly 12 times oversubscribed offering."
"12327790","12331830"," When you're looking at the valuation, Paul, we talked about this in the weeks leading up to this."
"12331830","12337350"," There were a lot of people questioning Softbank's deal to buy back a quarter of the company from"
"12337350","12338970"," itself at a $64 billion valuation. "
"12339710","12341330"," Right now it's a $61.5 billion."
"12341710","12347250"," So, not really maybe that bad of a deal, but it does seem like a lot of excitement."
"12347610","12352550"," We do have this coming ahead of a pair of pretty closely washed and highly anticipated deals next"
"12352550","12352850"," week. "
"12353130","12354310"," Yeah, that's kind of where I wanted to go here."
"12354390","12355950"," I mean, this really sets the tone."
"12355950","12359790"," If I'm the underrated person, those other deals insta card and the other ones that you've been"
"12359790","12361670"," talking about, I got to feel pretty good. "
"12361770","12363990"," They came to market with a good tape today."
"12364210","12365950"," The recipe is up 9.10. So, 1%."
"12365950","12367630"," But this seems trading really well. "
"12367690","12369330"," It's kind of set the tone for the market, I would think."
"12369530","12373530"," Yeah, and I was talking to someone on the deal earlier and he was basically saying, there was a"
"12373530","12377370"," little bit of concern yesterday in the arm boardroom about the inflation data."
"12377790","12381490"," And when they saw that come out, they kind of breathed a sigh of relief and kind of put the"
"12381490","12382130"," pedals of the metal. "
"12382650","12387850"," And that's why you're seeing a really strong reception from investors and going ahead, as you"
"12387850","12389530"," mentioned, into insta card next week."
"12390090","12394090"," Clavio, two VC backed companies shifting towards profitability."
"12394590","12399210"," So, that will really give us a sense of where the IPO market could be going later this year and"
"12399210","12400030"," into next year. "
"12400450","12404930"," And obviously, that also does potentially set the stage likely for either later this month or early"
"12404930","12406630"," next month for Birkenstock to go public."
"12406970","12407430"," So, that's right."
"12407550","12409490"," Seeing a bit of deals, volume pick up finally. "
"12409970","12414270"," Yeah, so we're talking the Bloomberg intelligence analyst, Kun John Sauvani out in San Francisco."
"12414270","12417230"," And he covers the semiconductor chip makers."
"12417590","12421110"," And he kind of points out that they've got some work to do here at ARM. "
"12421250","12425510"," Because they're really successful in providing chip designs for the phone business, the auto"
"12425510","12429010"," business, all good businesses, but they're not AI growth stories."
"12429650","12434870"," And they've begun the pivot to AI in terms of offering their chips design."
"12435290","12437730"," But they've got a long way to go against some of the bigger competitors. "
"12438170","12443150"," But the market today is saying, we kind of have confidence in this strategy."
"12443150","12448370"," Yeah, and when you look at the strategic investors they brought on, the fact that NVIDIA was going"
"12448370","12453410"," to buy them a few years ago, NVIDIA being one of those investors really did seem to be kind of"
"12453410","12455710"," a stamp of approval that this is where we could be going."
"12455890","12459870"," Because you're looking at a company like NVIDIA when you essentially have more than triple this"
"12459870","12465130"," year and added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value, riding that wave of AI enthusiasm"
"12465130","12466790"," is good now. "
"12466970","12473090"," But as you mentioned, the question will be where is this company at three months from now, on"
"12473090","12476110"," delivering on those promises to go into AI and data center?"
"12476490","12481930"," Yeah, as you mentioned earlier, SoftBank retains 90% of ARM after the IPO."
"12482710","12487750"," So they may be interesting to see kind of how they think about unwinding that position or over what"
"12487750","12488370"," time period."
"12488530","12492550"," Well, that's actually the thing is they're planning really the messaging has been to keep that and"
"12492550","12496130"," use it to lever up to take out some loans to maybe make some other investments. "
"12496130","12499730"," And that I think was one of the things when you're talking to the bankers and investors on this"
"12499730","12503610"," deal, that scarcity value could be driving the investments."
"12503850","12507050"," Because if you didn't get in on this IPO and you didn't get your allocation and they're not"
"12507050","12509050"," selling, you have to buy it in the aftermarket."
"12509190","12511730"," Okay, that'll be interesting to see because that'll be out there. "
"12511850","12516190"," And that's called an overhang, quite frankly, if there's that much stock out there, which you don't"
"12516190","12516590"," like to see."
"12516830","12520690"," So the way you counter that is I guess by that rhetoric saying we're holders here."
"12521070","12526470"," Yeah, and you're holding in that at least in this tape right now with 70 million shares trading is"
"12526470","12528050"," drawing in quite a bit of excitement. "
"12528410","12528550"," Sorry."
"12528550","12530630"," Other news, big news for Tom Keene, certainly."
"12531050","12535650"," Boston Red Sox, fire chief baseball officer, high in bloom for almost four seasons. "
"12536190","12539530"," I mean, if you don't win in Boston, like New York, you're out, I guess."
"12539770","12540950"," Yeah, well, that's the thing."
"12541130","12543930"," I mean, both the Yankees and Red Sox who play today. "
"12544350","12544750"," Double header."
"12545290","12548790"," Tight and last in the AL East at 70th at a game over 500."
"12549310","12551210"," I think the main takeaway will be with highness. "
"12551550","12554450"," He's forever going to be remembered as the guy who traded away the bets."
"12554890","12555470"," Yep, absolutely."
"12555750","12556270"," That's a good point. "
"12556270","12560670"," So lots going on in the markets and in Major League Baseball."

"12779030","12781110"," Little Friday with a lot in the news. "
"12781250","12784870"," And it's going to sound familiar to what we talked about yesterday, but we're getting ever closer"
"12784870","12785230"," here."
"12785410","12792410"," So we'll pick our crises chronologically as we spend some time in a moment with Jordan Fabian."
"12792430","12795430"," Thanks for joining us on the radio on the satellite on the podcast. "
"12795490","12800610"," Of course, if you're downloading this and now on YouTube, where we always invite you to join us"
"12800610","12803030"," here with the cameras in the studio."
"12803030","12805470"," It's actually, we're back in the old radio studio with the cameras today."
"12805550","12806010"," It's kind of cool. "
"12806190","12806530"," Come on in."
"12806630","12809670"," Go to YouTube, search Bloomberg Global News and we'll meet you there."
"12810530","12815730"," The headline on the terminal, Biden has few options to avert strike against big three car makers. "
"12816090","12820670"," That's the writing of Jordan Fabian as we just heard from Sean Fane, the head of the UAW."
"12820870","12822190"," It's not sounding good."
"12822330","12827110"," All three companies continue to reject all of our proposals for retirement security. "
"12828150","12833870"," For the first time in our history, we may strike all three of the big three at once."
"12834330","12836670"," All three of the big three at once."
"12837450","12840410"," And the deadline is coming up at 11.59 p.m. here. "
"12840550","12841890"," We're just hours away at this point."
"12842010","12844030"," That's what we wanted to spend some time with Jordan."
"12844650","12849210"," You're writing great to see you, by the way, about the options this president may have. "
"12849370","12850830"," And it appears there aren't many."
"12851270","12853050"," Is there any 11th hour move you can make?"
"12853870","12860190"," Joe, this isn't like the rail strike from last year where the president had a legal option to"
"12860190","12865530"," intervene and keep the workers at work and impose a contract to make sure that it happens."
"12865890","12867610"," The president doesn't have that option here. "
"12867730","12873330"," So all he can do is really beg the sides to stay at the table and reach an agreement."
"12873530","12876390"," And so we've heard that he's been in touch with Sean Fane."
"12876670","12880050"," He's been in touch with auto executives over the past few weeks. "
"12880050","12885290"," He's deputized Jean Spirling, who's one of his chief advisors to stay on top of the situation, but"
"12885290","12886890"," all he can do is hope."
"12887070","12890990"," He doesn't have some kind of magic wand he can wave and prevent a strike from happening."
"12891310","12893510"," So what role is Jean Spirling actually playing?"
"12893730","12895350"," Is he standing by if needed?"
"12895830","12898610"," Is he engaging or acting as kind of an informal mediator?"
"12899250","12901650"," Because they've not asked for anyone to step in here. "
"12901870","12903010"," They haven't asked for anyone."
"12903330","12908090"," And my understanding is that Jean Spirling has not stepped in to play that mediator role."
"12908090","12922990"," All three of the"
"12922990","12923330"," big three. "
"12923710","12925590"," That's got to trigger a presidential address, right?"
"12925950","12927190"," Yeah, you would think so."
"12927390","12933230"," And I want to be clear that what we're expecting, if they do strike, is targeted strikes at first."
"12933610","12938070"," So certain plants being struck, not whole companies all at once. "
"12938490","12946090"," So it seems like they're trying to spread the pain and possibly target plants that are producing"
"12946090","12948610"," vehicles that are the profit centers for these companies."
"12948610","12955130"," So, for example, for, you know, you guys are listening to him talk about these UAW strikes."
"12955750","12962250"," And what's shocking about UAW strikes is that there's, so I live in Michigan. "
"12962770","12966010"," The UAW union in Michigan is strong."
"12967930","12975630"," So I know people in the unions here and the two things that the union has been saying about."
"12976850","12979170"," The strikes are that. "
"12980510","12986430"," The automakers have a ton of cars sitting on lots intentionally."
"12987050","12993170"," And that they had forced seven day work weeks, seven days a week for their workers."
"12994790","12995730"," So that. "
"12996870","12997870"," So that."
"12999850","13003910"," They could increase production in anticipation of a strike."
"13004890","13010930"," So a lot of these workers that I know here in Detroit have been working six, seven, 10, 12 hour"
"13010930","13011310"," shifts. "
"13012310","13015850"," Week in, week out, anticipating a shutdown."
"13015850","13022510"," So just be aware, if you're listening to the news about the big three."
"13023510","13032430"," And any strikes coming that these automakers have already prepared for a strike in terms of"
"13032430","13032910"," production. "
"13036680","13037280"," That's a mention."
"13037500","13041880"," You think just of union friendly states like Pennsylvania, we're going to talk to Chrissy who only"
"13041880","13042400"," had in a moment."
"13042600","13046900"," This could have ripple effects even beyond the auto sector when it comes to perceptions of this"
"13046900","13047220"," president. "
"13048080","13048480"," Absolutely."
"13049240","13052020"," You know, there's been, you know, some people have called it the summer of strikes."
"13052300","13053420"," There's been a lot of union action. "
"13053940","13060100"," You know, I've heard from sources that say they saw how hard the UAW saw how hard of a bargain."
"13060100","13064380"," The team surge drove with UPS and that kind of emboldened them to take more action."
"13064620","13067680"," So, you know, of course, this could be a solidarity moment for the union movement. "
"13068000","13068520"," And that's a mention."
"13068680","13069640"," There's practical effects too."
"13069820","13074680"," I mean, a strike would not only impact the auto workers themselves, but suppliers, you know,"
"13074780","13078820"," restaurants and bars that might be serving auto workers that won't see the foot traffic. "
"13079100","13080720"," So we're talking about widespread effects."
"13081280","13082220"," Incredible stuff here."
"13082320","13083960"," These are wild times that we're living in Jordan. "
"13084140","13087400"," Thank you for helping us make sense of it and find Jordan's story on the terminal."
"13087400","13092040"," If you want to prepare yourself for what may be about to happen here, the story is right there"
"13092040","13095180"," about Biden's few options to avert a strike against a big three."
"13096000","13096960"," Great to see you, Jordan. "
"13097100","13097580"," Don't be a stranger."
"13098240","13098600"," Thanks, always."
"13099020","13101060"," Bloomberg White House reporter Jordan Fabian. "
"13101180","13102200"," I'm Joe Matthew in Washington."
"13102460","13105680"," As we add the voice now of Congresswoman Chrissy Houlihan."
"13105780","13107000"," We've been looking forward to the conversation. "
"13107340","13109300"," It's been a couple of weeks now that everybody's back in town."
"13109780","13110520"," It's really interesting."
"13111080","13113120"," It's a gauge sentiment on a lot of these issues. "
"13113300","13116440"," And of course, nothing is bigger than this potential shutdown at the moment."
"13116440","13119980"," The news has not been getting easier from Pennsylvania's sixth district."
"13120520","13122560"," It's wonderful to have you back, Congresswoman. "
"13122680","13123540"," Thank you for the time."
"13124000","13125980"," I don't know what's going on in the House of Representatives."
"13126080","13127200"," And maybe you don't either. "
"13127320","13129740"," There's talk about a motion to vacate a government shutdown."
"13130120","13135720"," Apparently the military funding bill has bumped into a wall because of objections from some hard"
"13135720","13138340"," line Republicans in this case eyes on the freedom caucus."
"13138980","13143300"," Are you bracing for a shutdown or is this what it feels like last minute negotiations?"
"13143640","13144760"," If we can call it that. "
"13146180","13148220"," I'm not certain with the future holds either."
"13148660","13153160"," I will say that I was sworn in about five years ago now into the longest shutdown."
"13153920","13156400"," As you might recall in 2019, I think it was. "
"13156960","13161700"," So I've seen this before and it's not pretty and it's very, very harmful to people when it happens."
"13161960","13165900"," So, of course, the vast majority of us would like to make sure that we avert that."
"13166040","13170480"," And frankly, avert a continuing resolution, which is basically kicking the can down the road as"
"13170480","13170700"," well. "
"13170700","13174360"," But if I had to guess, we will end up with a continuing resolution."
"13175340","13179860"," And of some, of some length of time, I've heard anywhere from one week to several months."
"13180460","13184520"," And that is preferred over a shutdown, but certainly not an optimal choice. "
"13184780","13187580"," I very much hope that we can calmer heads will prevail."
"13187820","13190940"," And I hope that we can find our way to keeping the government open and funded."
"13191520","13192000"," Yeah. "
"13192300","13197620"," You know, the speaker talked about his frustration with a few members earlier today."
"13197620","13203680"," Do the Matt Gaetz is of the house take up too much oxygen to really understand."
"13204420","13208080"," What the Republican conference or your conference for that matter believes here. "
"13208080","13212420"," Are we are we listening to the right people or is it just the fringe voices that are getting"
"13212420","13212740"," through."
"13213220","13218600"," You know, with all respect to the speaker, I would push back and say there are 435 of us here."
"13218600","13222780"," And as I mentioned, the majority of us would like very much to properly fund the government. "
"13222780","13228880"," And I think he needs to kind of look beyond his own party and beyond those people on the far,"
"13228880","13229580"," far right."
"13230000","13233080"," And understand that we're all here to serve our people and our community."
"13233760","13238500"," And so I hope that he's thinking hard about the next steps and I know it's at his peril at"
"13238500","13239400"," his political peril. "
"13239940","13244680"," But there's just too many lives that are at stake in terms of making sure people are able to go"
"13244680","13248780"," home with paychecks for us to continue to screw around with our parties."
"13249100","13250840"," We really need to find each other in the middle."
"13251820","13254020"," Is this talk of a motion to vacate real?"
"13254180","13258300"," Do you think you could be a house without a speaker in a couple of weeks?"
"13258680","13261860"," I'm confident the talk of motion into vacate is real. "
"13262160","13266660"," And that's the position that the speaker put himself into when he was when he was voted in."
"13266980","13272360"," There are, you know, it only takes one, frankly, and not a whole lot of votes to actually vacate"
"13272360","13272760"," the chair."
"13272760","13277640"," And I don't know, you know, we would certainly be as if we're not already in unprecedented"
"13277640","13279360"," territory and unprecedented times. "
"13279540","13282800"," We would be in really unprecedented times at that point in time."
"13283400","13287460"," So I believe that I believe the Matt Gaetz is at the world when they speak."
"13288480","13291300"," I guess you believe the Tommy Tuberville's of the world as well. "
"13291440","13295520"," We talked to you about this on Bloomberg TV and I know it was something you were very passionate"
"13295520","13297380"," about as someone who's served your country."
"13297380","13302880"," He has not, although I know that he's told us repeatedly he was a military brat growing up, but"
"13302880","13309700"," he's not pulling back on this blockade of military promotions, flag officers, general officers in"
"13309700","13314700"," objection to the Pentagon's abortion travel policy here."
"13314840","13319960"," We actually spoke with him Congresswoman two days ago and he pushed back on the idea that this was"
"13319960","13321380"," impacting military readiness. "
"13321820","13323760"," A brief remark from him here and we'll have you reply."
"13324000","13324460"," Here's what he said."
"13324460","13327620"," They have no clue of what this policy is. "
"13327640","13332100"," They just wanted to change it to let the American people know, hey, we can do what we want to."
"13332460","13333700"," And I'm not going to allow them to do it."
"13333900","13338060"," Now, if they continue to do it, we're going to have the same people in place as admirals and"
"13338060","13338300"," generals. "
"13338640","13340780"," Again, there's no readiness problem."
"13341200","13343220"," We got people in place that are doing their jobs."
"13343580","13348220"," I know that you're concerned about a recruitment deterrent about military families and temporary"
"13348220","13351980"," housing because of this, but speak to that issue of readiness. "
"13351980","13352840"," Is he right?"
"13353100","13353920"," Keep the same people."
"13354060","13354520"," They're doing great."
"13354660","13355380"," Now you keep them there. "
"13355460","13357580"," It's not going to be an interruption in the chain of command."
"13357980","13358480"," What do you think?"
"13358700","13360280"," That's positively asinine."
"13360600","13366300"," I was in Hawaii and Indo pecan calm recently over the August work period. "
"13366480","13372740"," And there are four star generals and admirals who are retiring with no one named and to their as"
"13372740","13373200"," their successor."
"13373520","13375000"," Nobody approved as their successor."
"13375000","13378140"," This is an absolute readiness issue. "
"13378580","13383280"," And of course, it's a deterrent for people who want to work in a functioning organization and"
"13383280","13385500"," they're not necessarily seeing the military is functioning."
"13385980","13389480"," And it's also a deterrent when you're basically going against them."
"13389580","13396300"," The majority of the will of the people, most people support women's right to be in charge of their"
"13396300","13396840"," own body. "
"13396840","13400020"," Most people believe in reproductive freedom."
"13400620","13406580"," And so when you're looking at an all volunteer military, it can't help but affect recruiting and"
"13406580","13406920"," readiness."
"13407440","13412940"," But it's insane for him to say that several hundred positions that now remain unconfirmed or not"
"13412940","13414400"," affecting our readiness right now. "
"13415300","13417020"," So what's the off ramp here?"
"13417180","13418880"," He's showing no signs of backing down."
"13419060","13423680"," We talked to Congressman Michael McCall, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee last"
"13423680","13424020"," evening."
"13424020","13427520"," He's one of the few higher ranking Republicans have called him out. "
"13427580","13429460"," He said, this is paralyzing our military will."
"13430060","13434180"," Is that what it's going to take more Republicans to pressure him to stand down?"
"13434800","13440860"," Yeah, I'm under no illusions that what I'm saying about Senator Tuberville matters that one with to"
"13440860","13441080"," him."
"13441400","13446520"," What will take what it will take is certainly more Republicans in elected office and frankly more"
"13446520","13452980"," constituents of his as well as people around the country to really laid to bear what's happening"
"13452980","13453240"," here. "
"13453620","13457380"," Perhaps more pressure from the military itself if there hasn't already been enough."
"13458080","13465740"," So it is kind of worrisome that this one person can hold several hundred nominations at bay right"
"13465740","13466000"," now."
"13466140","13469320"," And that's something that is really concerning for many of us, I think. "
"13469700","13474900"," What does it mean to have a military without a chairman of the Joint Chiefs because it looks like"
"13474900","13475840"," that's about to happen?"
"13479560","13484660"," You have to be just a person who's watched a movie, you know, to know that we can't have."
"13484860","13490600"," You can't have a military without its brass, you know, or somebody who just has worked at a company"
"13490600","13493720"," to know that if you're rudderless without leadership, it's going to matter."
"13494020","13498480"," We just talked about vacating the chair in the House of Representatives that will impact the"
"13498480","13502280"," ability of us to get our jobs done regardless of what side of the aisle you are on. "
"13502900","13506020"," It's common sense that we can't hold this up like this."
"13507120","13516840"," Just a note market note here that Dixie is trying to squeeze up and trade 105-43."
"13517640","13525800"," There's a little bit of a roll as well in HYG and VIX is near some kind of a bottom,"
"13526060","13527620"," even though it's being ground down. "
"13527620","13535040"," If you start to see VIX rolling up and price is still going higher and HYG is rolling down, it's"
"13535040","13537340"," signifying a topping of the market."
"13537920","13540360"," Tesla is starting to roll a little bit as well."
"13541420","13543680"," It's rolling below, it's a 27 EMA. "
"13544660","13548520"," HYG rolling over right here, so just be conscious of this."
"13549940","13552000"," There's some weakness currently in the market."
"13556560","13558560"," Arms still looking good right now. "
"13558760","13563860"," I would not look towards our, I think generally speaking, these things will do their own thing."
"13564420","13569680"," Any IPO likely won't follow the market, especially if the market's rolling over."
"13570200","13576920"," Oftentimes you'll see IPOs trade, they do just do their own thing, so I wouldn't be using ARM or"
"13576920","13582140"," the greater market as an indicator up or down on it. "
"13582140","13588360"," I would trade ARM completely separately, so if the market's going up and ARM is going down, I"
"13588360","13590660"," wouldn't shock me."
"13591500","13598300"," I would not trade an IPO against the market on its first day or the first week or two that"
"13598300","13598740"," it's open."
"13602490","13608470"," For military hardware, getting into police departments, sometimes these get to be very gray lines. "
"13608990","13609950"," No, I understand."
"13609970","13615530"," I understand the argument and this bill is supported by part is only by a lot of people who want"
"13615530","13619150"," to invest, of course, in our police force, but also want to protect our citizenry."
"13619610","13623410"," And I think this particular piece of legislation does a really good job of making sure that we're"
"13623410","13628910"," educating police, creating databases for police, making sure that we have a good relationship from"
"13628910","13629870"," citizen to police. "
"13630470","13638310"," And I think that there can be both you can have a protected citizenry and also a strength and"
"13638310","13639550"," police force as well."
"13640990","13645110"," Can I just ask before I let you go, Congresswoman, are you glad to be back in Washington?"
"13645730","13647150"," Have you been dreading at all August?"
"13648690","13654030"," I feel as though that this is a really important time to be here in Washington or in my community."
"13654590","13658870"," I'm fortunate that my community is just up the road a few hours, so I can kind of get back"
"13658870","13659790"," and forth pretty easily. "
"13660510","13666130"," I'm not going to lie, I wish Congress in Washington were much more highly functional or functional"
"13666130","13671150"," at all in some cases, but I do think it's really important that I represent our community and that"
"13671150","13672350"," I'm physically here to do that."
"13673350","13676030"," Well, I appreciate that and I hope you'll stay in touch with us."
"13676030","13680670"," The Congresswoman from Pennsylvania, Chrissy Coolian, we thank you, as always, for talking with us"
"13680670","13683750"," today on Bloomberg joining us from Capitol Hill. "
"13683950","13686030"," If you were with us on the YouTube feed, you would have seen that."
"13686170","13690630"," We invite you search Bloomberg Global News on YouTube and join the party here."
"13690810","13694750"," Of course, we always welcome you on the radio on the satellite and on the podcast as well. "
"13695650","13697010"," Here on sound on nation."
"13697910","13699130"," I'm Joe Matthew in Washington."
"13699130","13700130"," We assemble our panel. "
"13700130","13705810"," Jeannie Shansano and Rick Davis are with us Bloomberg politics contributors as we countdown to a"
"13705810","13707270"," couple of potentially ugly headlines."
"13708870","13710690"," Jeannie, where's your head right now?"
"13711210","13716790"," Where's Joe Biden's head sitting in the West Wing watching the potential strike of a lifetime here"
"13716790","13717150"," in Detroit."
"13717150","13721630"," Apparently, all three of the big three is the last thing that Sean fame said and the government"
"13721630","13723090"," shutdown could soon follow. "
"13723650","13725210"," How does he message around this?"
"13725990","13731350"," It is difficult to be president, you know, following on your question to the representative about"
"13731350","13734250"," is she happy or a little bit sad to be back in Washington."
"13734870","13736550"," He's got a lot on his plate."
"13737150","13742170"," And, you know, I think we've seen and Jordan mentioned that the president is already been engaging"
"13742170","13746230"," with the automaker leaders with with Sean fame with the union. "
"13746230","13752090"," I think we've seen in the past when this has come up with the railway strike and MLB and others"
"13752090","13754450"," that he engages sort of at the last minute."
"13754570","13759450"," So I think we may hear about more of that today as we come up to this deadline."
"13760010","13765850"," But at this point, it looks like he is going to be facing this strike and for those reasons that"
"13765850","13767670"," Jordan went through both the push. "
"13767670","13773990"," And then also, of course, because, you know, Joe Biden really does need Michigan and this can"
"13773990","13777330"," really ground those local economies in the Midwest to a halt."
"13777690","13781010"," This could be potentially very, very difficult for him to handle."
"13781370","13785350"," So I do think we're going to hear more about him working the phone trying to get this together. "
"13785670","13789610"," But it looks like we are going to see it targeted strike by midnight tonight."
"13789610","13795710"," And I have to say, Sean fame is one of the most interesting union leaders we have seen in years."
"13796750","13803470"," Mainly, you know, because he is one of the first democratically elected union leaders to the UAW"
"13803470","13807290"," and boy to watch him speak and his activism out there. "
"13807530","13809890"," It is truly he is a force of nature."
"13810210","13814690"," So Biden has a lot on his plate trying to get these two to find some common ground."
"13814690","13817950"," I didn't have to believe him today, Rick. "
"13818230","13821230"," What does Joe Biden think of Sean fame?"
"13821790","13822150"," What do you think?"
"13822710","13827230"," You know, look, I think it's probably a nightmare every night for the last week since he got back"
"13827230","13828810"," from Asia thinking about him."
"13828810","13831150"," I mean, as Jeannie says, he's untethered."
"13831250","13832730"," He's a democratically elected leader. "
"13833310","13841290"," Just a note here, we're looking for a rejection on the five minutes on HYG go to the HYG ticker"
"13841290","13842030"," symbol at home."
"13842030","13846690"," And I'm watching the role right now in the twenty seven EMA."
"13847050","13849930"," Had the first rejection on that twenty seven EMA. "
"13850030","13851950"," It looks like it wants to bloodbath down."
"13852550","13854850"," Close a giant gap to the downside."
"13856170","13859990"," You got Dixie ripping right now the gap down below on HYG. "
"13861030","13867050"," To be filled is at seventy four seventy seven, maybe slightly higher seventy four seventy eight."
"13867050","13869010"," Just be aware of it to the downside there."
"13869390","13871670"," Could see a big role coming up here. "
"13876830","13885330"," And the X coming into some previous resistance at fifteen five zero three eighty right now."
"13886930","13889250"," Tesla trying to roll again to the downside."
"13890190","13891690"," Apple still bullish here. "
"13892970","13893530"," Vicks."
"13895290","13897830"," It's previous low is that it's twelve seventy three."
"13897970","13899950"," It's trying to hold on to itself here. "
"13900450","13904230"," We should see some violent moves up and down or at least that's what it's saying."
"13905950","13915860"," A shift here in which union labor sides with Republicans"
"13915860","13919540"," Donald Trump's asking for the UAW's endorsement in this race."
"13920220","13924860"," Yeah, I mean, he has been working hard for that and rightly so. "
"13925080","13927740"," I mean, that is what our politicians should be doing."
"13928320","13931880"," And if it happens, it would be an enormous shift."
"13932460","13933560"," But let's not forget. "
"13933820","13934860"," And I think this is critical."
"13935620","13940280"," If the union is successful here, if they get even a part of what they're asking for."
"13940400","13945880"," I mean, let's remember on pay alone, they're asking for a forty percent increase to match what the"
"13945880","13947280"," CEOs have made. "
"13947280","13954080"," As they in twenty fifteen and twenty sixteen that this huge boon in terms of these auto worker"
"13954080","13954560"," CEOs."
"13954940","13958540"," He's asking that the workers get matched and a whole bunch of other things."
"13958780","13963940"," If he gets even a portion of that, that may be seen as a big success. "
"13963940","13971200"," And you may see people who have looked at unions and particularly as we see openings of plants and"
"13971200","13972100"," others in the south."
"13972100","13974760"," And have not been particularly friendly to unions."
"13974760","13976520"," They may say, hey, you know what?"
"13976740","13977700"," I want some of that. "
"13978040","13983400"," So if they need is successful, if the union is successful, I don't know if we're going to see that"
"13983400","13984720"," shift, but it is possible."
"13984880","13985920"," We really don't know."
"13986060","13987900"," We are in uncharted territory here. "
"13988100","13992660"," And I think one of the brilliant things, Jane, is done and I think Biden has to have some grudging"
"13992660","13993640"," respect for him."
"13993820","13999340"," Is he have kept he is holding his fire in terms of who he's going to support and he is"
"13999340","14002040"," making the case look at you need to win us over."
"14002040","14005840"," And we want what we want and we're going to push for it and it. "
"14008280","14012860"," Dude, what the this is Bloomberg radio of all things to him kind of shocked here that they're"
"14012860","14015100"," making these stupid fucking conversation."
"14015660","14021740"," But he has become a quickly powerful figure in the labor movement and in manufacturing across the"
"14021740","14030760"," country, if not the"
"14030760","14032000"," world."
"14032000","14038000"," Well, look, there's certainly a strain of the party who's much more populous than the past and"
"14038000","14043920"," appeal to these rank and file quasi Democrats, quasi Republicans in rural districts. "
"14044560","14044660"," Sure."
"14044880","14047960"," I mean, that's what Donald Trump has brought into the Republican Party."
"14048080","14051420"," That's how he's won election in 2016. "
"14052000","14057500"," And that's how people like Glenn Yunken won the governorship of Virginia by appealing to what was"
"14057500","14064700"," historically rank and file Democratic voters in the in the rural areas and said, Hey, what have"
"14064700","14065600"," they done for you lately?"
"14066000","14069940"," And, you know, we we are going to go out there and and work hard for you."
"14070060","14072480"," And so, yeah, that's happening right now."
"14072500","14074580"," It's not the whole party, but it's a big strain of it. "
"14074660","14078920"," And it also shows a decline in the support for the Republican Party for corporate America."
"14079460","14082080"," Corporate America has been thrown on the bus by both parties now."
"14082080","14083860"," And so it'll be interesting to see where they turn. "
"14084680","14085640"," All right."
"14085700","14087740"," So let's go from one countdown clock to another."
"14088280","14092640"," We'll find out about the strike before midnight tonight, although fame again is talking at 10 p.m."
"14093120","14095140"," And it might be a couple of hours before that. "
"14095680","14101120"," On the other side, we have a countdown to a potential government shutdown at the end of this month"
"14101120","14103420"," is the end of the fiscal year, which all the yesterday."
"14104500","14111340"," Republicans in the House blocked a couple of them, at least block debate from even beginning on the"
"14111340","14112540"," military funding bill."
"14112540","14117240"," And there are concerns that we might be a lot closer to a shutdown now than when we're even 24"
"14117240","14117940"," hours ago. "
"14118080","14119900"," The speaker is not happy."
"14120200","14122820"," I showed frustration in here because I am frustrated with the committee."
"14123220","14124840"," I have frustrated with some people in the conference. "
"14125680","14129580"," We had the DoD appropriation bill yesterday."
"14129860","14130920"," I couldn't put it on the floor."
"14131860","14133220"," Someone asked about Tesla. "
"14133840","14136080"," If you're looking for a great dip by on Tesla."
"14137340","14140900"," I am bullish above two seventy one eighty four."
"14141080","14142760"," So two seven one eight four. "
"14143720","14147560"," I'd be trying to buy like two seventy one eighty four two seventy two ninety three on Tesla."
"14150280","14153820"," Any closing half our bars below two seventy one eighty four."
"14154680","14160760"," You should get a half back trade to two fifty six sixteen. "
"14161580","14166420"," So any closing bars below two seventy one eighty four expect a half back trade."
"14167820","14172320"," Well, you have two sixty three and then you've got two fifty six."
"14173300","14175880"," So you need to hold two seventy one. "
"14176020","14180240"," You must hold two seventy one if you're a Tesla bull."
"14188230","14189370"," Does that help you out?"
"14189590","14190650"," Hopefully that helps you out here."
"14195480","14197660"," Compliance is what Matt Gates wants. "
"14198040","14204540"," And you know, can you just imagine Nancy Pelosi or any of our strong speakers in the past putting"
"14204540","14206260"," up with this kind of."
"14206460","14210140"," Dude, I'll tell you that the counter alpha here is Apple."
"14210480","14213440"," Dude, Apple is bullish as fuck. "
"14213700","14213900"," So."
"14215620","14218940"," Dude, like just look at Apple on a one hour chart."
"14219320","14220060"," It is bullish. "
"14221500","14224640"," It wants to trade one seventy eight so bad."
"14225180","14227840"," Regardless of what Dixie H Y G."
"14229020","14230500"," Is saying it's just bullish."
"14231500","14235360"," Apple is like beast mode right now does not care at all. "
"14236200","14238480"," Does not care at all."
"14240020","14245440"," Arm rolling over right now trying to get a confirmed sell."
"14245720","14248020"," Not quite there yet, but it is looking for it. "
"14248480","14250880"," Do you pay attention to the bottom chart right there?"
"14250940","14253140"," It's not quite there yet, but it is looking for it."
"14258500","14263360"," It's looking for that drop straight down to the opening price of fifty five fifty three."
"14264420","14265800"," Keep your eyes on it. "
"14265880","14266900"," Not quite there yet."
"14267100","14268240"," No confirmation yet."
"14268240","14270660"," It's a short arm, but it is there. "
"14270820","14271760"," Just be aware of it."
"14276360","14278300"," All their job is being done for them."
"14278420","14285660"," And it is an incredible failure of the speaker's leadership not to be able to get a vote on the"
"14285660","14286160"," NDAA. "
"14286420","14288600"," I mean, this is a bill that is a must pass."
"14289040","14291000"," They are far behind the Senate on it."
"14291040","14292040"," It needs to happen. "
"14292660","14299020"," And the speaker let a number of these guys in the Freedom Caucus load it up with all these anti"
"14299020","14299720"," woke amendments."
"14299720","14301700"," And now nobody will vote for it."
"14301780","14302840"," Republicans won't vote for it. "
"14302940","14303960"," Democrats won't vote for it."
"14304040","14305040"," I mean, it's dead on arrival."
"14305900","14310820"," And yet they've got to pass one in order to get into a conference with the Senate to get a"
"14310820","14311260"," bill out. "
"14311440","14313140"," I mean, it's the most messed up."
"14313200","14317680"," I mean, we're not even talking about the government shutdown or the Ukraine spending bill or the"
"14317680","14323480"," other supplemental administration asked for or any of the appropriations bills that they're waiting"
"14323480","14323860"," to pass."
"14323860","14328640"," I mean, it is a disaster inside the Republican leadership. "
"14329520","14330000"," Wow."
"14330000","14331560"," That's coming from Rick Davis."
"14332140","14337760"," We've got breaking news and sometimes the breaker is just not a surprise, but the headline just"
"14337760","14343320"," crossed the terminal Hunter Biden indicted on federal firearms charges in Delaware. "
"14343720","14346560"," I didn't think we're going to talk about this today, guys, but we did see it coming."
"14346560","14350580"," Special counsel David Weiss told us, by the way, about a week ago that by the end of the month,"
"14350600","14351380"," he was going to do this."
"14351380","14354240"," So, this could be a bit of a tree falling in the woods. "
"14354480","14359420"," I don't know if this is a huge deal for the White House genie since it was already out there."
"14359860","14363420"," But does this make the case for the impeachment inquiry?"
"14365000","14367400"," No, no, it doesn't."
"14367400","14369320"," I mean, Hunter Biden lied on the forum. "
"14369340","14374380"," He published a book saying he was doing drugs and he lied on the forum saying he wasn't."
"14374380","14376480"," Any of us who did that would be held responsible."
"14376900","14381100"," That has nothing to do with his father beyond the fact he must feel horrible as a parent. "
"14381560","14385220"," And so Hunter Biden is going to have to if the deal is not on the table as it no"
"14385220","14389520"," longer is, he is going to have to face the law on that, but it has nothing to do with"
"14389520","14390100"," Joe Biden."
"14390480","14396160"," If they are able to show a quid pro quo when Joe Biden was vice president, that would be a"
"14396160","14400980"," different story, but the fact that an adult signed a gun for him saying he wasn't doing drugs."
"14400980","14404480"," And he was that is up to him and he's going to have to pay the price. "
"14405480","14406900"," What do you think of this, Rick?"
"14407240","14409840"," Is it the type of headline that lands with a thought here?"
"14409900","14414100"," I suspect it's all we're going to hear about for the rest of the day on Newsmax and the rest"
"14414100","14415160"," of the conservative networks."
"14415400","14420880"," Yeah, every day that Hunter Biden is in the news is a bad day for the president Biden reelection"
"14420880","14421540"," campaign."
"14421640","14425780"," I mean, regardless of what else is happening around the world, there's no upside. "
"14425780","14428560"," There's no positive associated with 100 Biden story."
"14429140","14433220"," And in this case, as Jeannie said, has nothing to do with the president, but it just reminds us of"
"14433220","14439280"," the trials and tribulations of Hunter Biden and the potential indictment that looms in front of the"
"14439280","14440320"," president in the house."
"14441460","14444740"," Does the White House say nothing on this genie?"
"14444840","14447100"," It's all they'll be asked about in the briefing or on Air Force One. "
"14447920","14449840"," Yeah, they're going to be pressured to respond."
"14450060","14451400"," And I think they say the same thing."
"14451400","14453060"," They have the president feels horrible. "
"14453060","14454600"," His adult son has battled."
"14454600","14459680"," With a drug addiction, and he is going to stand up and he is going to have to pay for"
"14459680","14460220"," what he did."
"14460780","14465020"," And that, you know, both Joe Biden and the first lady feel horrible. "
"14465600","14470900"," And they are feeling like he is getting better and that he is going to take this responsibility."
"14471460","14473340"," But there's not much else to say beyond that."
"14473440","14478280"," They have to do what Joe Biden said yesterday in Virginia, which is to say we're working for the"
"14478280","14480820"," American people and we love our son. "
"14480820","14485600"," There you have it from Jeannie Shansano and Rick Davis on a breaking story."
"14485860","14491360"," We've just learned that Hunter Biden indicted on federal firearms charges in Delaware, the headline"
"14491360","14494160"," crossed the terminal just a couple of moments ago."
"14495080","14498700"," Interesting talk from Rhonda Santas by the remembering city was going to do more interviews. "
"14499200","14499940"," He's doing them."
"14500320","14501820"," Not telling CBS news."
"14501960","14504100"," He's prepared to send missiles into Mexico. "
"14504100","14506360"," We'll hit that next as Vivek Ramaswami."
"14506480","14510540"," Meantime prepares to lay off three quarters of the federal workforce."
"14510880","14513700"," That's his plan on the trail next with our panel. "
"14513920","14515100"," First, let's get you up to date now."

"15583280","15584240"," You want to get down there."
"15584980","15587340"," This is a key moment here for bears. "
"15587900","15590520"," To get below four fifty."
"15593400","15596840"," By two p.m. By two p.m. here."
"15597560","15599240"," Sellers if you want to make progress. "
"15600280","15607540"," You need to see that low below this yellow line right here by two p.m. 205 somewhere in there."
"15623290","15625010"," So Rob thank you for following."
"15625190","15625890"," I appreciate it. "
"15625910","15627170"," Thank you for subscribing via Twitch."
"15627170","15635030"," Yeah you want to see a rejection right here like right now off this one minute trigger."
"15635730","15637790"," You want to see this rejection of your seller. "
"15638610","15642790"," Pull still in charge right now so you should still be long here."
"15643290","15644790"," You're just waiting for rejection."
"15645950","15651190"," If you get the rejection it'll tell you at some point to begin to close your lungs. "
"15651830","15656050"," If you do see a cross here of the white line over the red line."
"15656770","15661650"," If you do see a rejection here it is a signal to you to close your lungs."
"15662510","15663550"," So anything like this. "
"15664950","15667990"," You'll see one more one more squeeze higher."
"15668630","15672510"," And you will close your lungs on this rejection right here."
"15674030","15675810"," Close your lungs right here. "
"15677350","15679010"," Right there you'd be closing lungs."
"15680210","15681590"," Just so you can see it."
"15683310","15684910"," We'll just see what happens here. "
"15687130","15691890"," Remember not to get trapped in this garbage in here."
"15692170","15694350"," Remember you don't want to get trapped in this stuff right here."
"15695210","15697170"," In case it breaks up or down. "
"15698670","15701590"," Consolidation range right now on spoons on a one minute chart."
"15702350","15706870"," Let's take a look at the 30 minute really quick and just look in the background under the hood and"
"15706870","15707770"," see what's going on."
"15708650","15714630"," Yeah so right here just on spoons see it see this just holding up right now. "
"15715310","15716830"," Down side targets."
"15717590","15721030"," Forty four fifty eight but I think it would be our two."
"15721470","15724990"," Would be your first downside target so forty four nine thirteen. "
"15726290","15730530"," But be aware we did trade off of this one right here."
"15731090","15734990"," Some expectation would be if we did break this we'd likely squeeze down."
"15735990","15739710"," Trade four forty eight and twenty five somewhere down in there. "
"15740430","15741730"," Something like that would happen."
"15743790","15749850"," We are losing velocity to the upside as well on the fifteen minutes on the half an hour."
"15750410","15756130"," And slightly on the hourly so just be we're kind of there kind of like kind of not the place"
"15756130","15756570"," to be. "
"15757270","15759170"," Putting a ton of risk on the marketplace."
"15761230","15764390"," If you're wondering if we can squeeze from here."
"15765770","15769150"," You also have this target right here and you get the five minute trigger. "
"15769990","15771450"," There's also the."
"15773770","15778790"," There is potential here to still squeeze or squeeze to be sold here."
"15780030","15783810"," Like big big green candle and red candle straight down. "
"15785070","15789570"," There's a lot of lot of mechanics working in the background that could still make that happen."
"15789970","15791650"," Still some upside risk for a squeeze."
"15792590","15795290"," So it's not like all completely bearish at this point. "
"15821380","15827920"," Another note here as well if you took the Disney trade down at eighty dollars."
"15828920","15830460"," I just want to give you an update on Disney."
"15831060","15834780"," If you did buy the eighty dollars that we talked about on Disney. "
"15835960","15843260"," It is that resistance on the daily trigger that daily trigger resistance is eighty four dollars and"
"15843260","15845200"," twenty five cents."
"15846380","15849200"," You need to be above that number."
"15850140","15854500"," And it has to hold above eighty four twenty seven. "
"15855220","15862220"," To get bullish on Disney if you hold above eighty four twenty seven."
"15863640","15870580"," You're going to be targeting ninety dollars and forty five cents ninety dollars and forty five"
"15870580","15870820"," cents."
"15871300","15875720"," Although I think I think you do come back and test. "
"15876340","15878560"," Maybe eighty one twenty six."
"15879360","15881780"," Possibly eighty two twenty six."
"15882360","15884180"," Before you're able to get up there. "
"15884480","15890220"," You might have like a brief panic downside move and then the blast above eighty four twenty seven."
"15890220","15892600"," So if you are a Disney bull."
"15893720","15899660"," It's getting more bullish but there could be a pullback before the launch above eighty four twenty"
"15899660","15900100"," seven. "
"15901000","15902140"," That's Disney."
"15902880","15907020"," We had them on a watch list I believe."
"15908000","15912820"," Two weeks ago and then we said look for eighty bucks to buy it tagged. "
"15914440","15916220"," Seventy nine seventy three."
"15916700","15919300"," And then immediately reversed to the upside."
"15920200","15923000"," It's smashed into the daily trigger twice now. "
"15924060","15929420"," So if there's like a quick capitulation moments in Disney and then is able to break above eighty"
"15929420","15930420"," four twenty seven."
"15930800","15935260"," You'd be targeting ninety dollars and forty five cents."
"15935260","15950720"," And just"
"15950720","15952860"," a note here if we break. "
"15955100","15957420"," Keep your eye on this thirty minute trigger."
"15959120","15964620"," If we do break down here I'm going to expect the thirty minute to break."
"15965140","15966740"," Like straight through it. "
"15966960","15969180"," I'm not going to expect this thirty minute to hold."
"15970040","15974580"," So do not use the thirty minute trigger as support if we do break here."
"15975280","15979060"," So I would expect us if we begin to break. "
"15981860","15985560"," That you would go straight to four forty seven eighty four."
"15985780","15995700"," Look at this nice list"
"15995700","15999200"," watch arm right here to check out arm right here."
"16001840","16006240"," Trying to bloodbath this down right here liquidation break on our panic. "
"16006640","16007980"," On arm right now."
"16029540","16033960"," A mix coming up to its five minute twenty seven EMA."
"16034200","16035760"," It's looking for a break above. "
"16037760","16040880"," Thirteen oh five to begin to roll the market over."
"16042420","16043760"," So thirteen."
"16045440","16049060"," Oh five if they get above that target on a five minute. "
"16050280","16057240"," You will end up seeing the market begin to roll over baby and try to trade."
"16057240","16060320"," The R two to the downside over here."
"16071970","16074210"," I don't take good question I don't expect. "
"16074770","16076430"," So if we're bullish."
"16077810","16080570"," Right where Max bullish on the thirty minute trigger."
"16081530","16084250"," Let's see what happens if this actually holds. "
"16084810","16085610"," So if."
"16086310","16087290"," So oh no."
"16087930","16092610"," Yeah so oh it's not anymore it was not it's not anymore it was for a minute there Max bullish. "
"16092610","16094290"," It no longer is."
"16094650","16097190"," If you ever see like if we're rolling over."
"16097650","16101350"," And you ever see the thirty minute trigger saying Max bullish on it. "
"16102090","16103470"," You expect it to break."
"16103930","16105930"," It's right now it's that bullish so it's improving."
"16106550","16109290"," Time is passing it's now at bullish not as bad. "
"16110350","16116370"," So some time has passed it's cooling off a little bit earlier it was at Max bullish."
"16117470","16119650"," So it's not as bad as it was earlier."
"16120490","16122730"," But if you come down into support. "
"16123630","16126270"," And you see a support that says Max bullish."
"16126990","16127990"," Don't trust it."
"16128550","16130190"," If it says Max bearish. "
"16130930","16132970"," And you're coming down into it."
"16133370","16136010"," So here's an example so this is the one minute trigger."
"16136810","16138210"," It's Max bearish now. "
"16139310","16142850"," But if it was way if price was way up here it was Max bearish."
"16143850","16145930"," Then I would expect to break through it and down."
"16147210","16149530"," So we'll you'll see it. "
"16150970","16154730"," So as long as prices hot so how do I explain this."
"16155750","16158090"," I'm not I miss I miss explaining this."
"16159170","16162910"," So so the example would be this if if you're at. "
"16163270","16165130"," So if we roll here."
"16165730","16167310"," See how it's Max bullish right now."
"16167310","16170470"," See how that trigger just flipped to Max bullish. "
"16170470","16173710"," If we begin to roll here."
"16174430","16176070"," I'm going to expect that to not hold."
"16178810","16181830"," If this 30 minute trigger was Max bearish. "
"16182790","16185910"," I would expect that trigger to hold this 30 minute."
"16186210","16189430"," But we would normally be going down in the market as that happens."
"16190250","16194750"," So we're coming down the market to the half hour triggered it was Max bearish. "
"16195330","16196350"," And not Max bullish."
"16196930","16199170"," I would expect it to then hold."
"16200150","16201770"," I don't know if that makes any sense but. "
"16206110","16208450"," You can see all that now that looks pretty good there."
"16212780","16213760"," Good question."
"16217850","16218890"," Yeah exactly. "
"16221130","16229450"," So so if you've got so if you're coming down into a trigger and it's Max bearish likely can be"
"16229450","16229690"," bought."
"16229690","16235310"," If you're coming down into a trigger and it's Max bullish it likely will not hold."
"16235770","16237810"," It's the inverse of what you think it is. "
"16258620","16259680"," I'm with you Barry."
"16260320","16261880"," We could have a little bit of both of that brother."
"16268280","16272900"," I figured NVDA would get the shaft you'd have like I figured you'd get like. "
"16274800","16281560"," Just money flow leaving NVDA to the new shiny ring right they're going to all run over and try to"
"16281560","16282160"," buy arm."
"16282160","16284420"," And all that kind of stupid shit."
"16285640","16288900"," And it looks right now like they're unloading on buyers. "
"16289760","16291520"," It looks to me on arm."
"16292620","16298360"," Like someone out there has some really cheap shares and they're just fucking unloading on buyers."
"16299720","16301320"," That's what it looks like to me. "
"16304280","16309620"," No well the reason the reason I'm saying the reason it's labeled like this is because."
"16310760","16314220"," On higher time frames like the weekly trigger."
"16315020","16319040"," Can give sustained upside or downside movement. "
"16319740","16322380"," I.E. let's say we're in 2022 right."
"16323120","16325320"," And we were trading below that weekly and."
"16325880","16328460"," And daily triggers on the way down. "
"16329480","16331000"," Those triggers should be."
"16331520","16334560"," If they say extreme bearish in prices below it."
"16335360","16339000"," That should mean that we have down coming for weekdays weeks and months. "
"16339800","16344640"," So that's why it's an inverse relationship on the on the lower time frames."
"16346280","16350080"," Do not set the tone for trend over higher time periods."
"16350420","16352860"," But the higher time frames do. "
"16362320","16363000"," Yeah."
"16363540","16366180"," So you're talking about."
"16367380","16371760"," You're talking about the free available shares that are out there. "
"16392509","16396710"," A little bit of a roll right now and spy baby."
"16406939","16410259"," Almost almost going to get the positioning."
"16411439","16413759"," South signal up here almost there. "
"16414640","16416040"," Almost there."
"16419200","16422200"," Almost there not quite positioning is still long."
"16422820","16424680"," So we'll see what it says next. "
"16434869","16437930"," Bulls buyers holding on by a thread right now."
"16438830","16441630"," Sellers looking for rejection off for 5028."
"16461560","16462460"," Trust me. "
"16463619","16468099"," If we were in the inverse right now, you'd understand the vlogger that you use."
"16468180","16469919"," So when I first started using it."
"16470439","16472840"," With this context, it felt so incongruent. "
"16475099","16478640"," But once you use it for like a week or two, you're like, I get this now."
"16478640","16480800"," You're like, I understand why it's labeled like this."
"16481779","16482540"," You'll understand. "
"16484860","16486480"," It's it's it's a learning curve."
"16486599","16487640"," It's definitely a learning curve."
"16500119","16505000"," What your what your brain ends up doing is so who has so Christine. "
"16505759","16510919"," You wind up your brain tells you to interpret both signals."
"16512520","16515500"," And then it messes with the hard wiring of your brain."
"16515640","16516939"," I don't know why that is, but it does. "
"16516939","16518259"," I have tried it though."
"16518460","16519500"," I have actually tried it."
"16544090","16548150"," Disney trying to squeeze above 84 27 right now. "
"16548189","16552270"," Disney now making a break above right now trading 84 47."
"16552970","16558790"," Currently trying to break up and above that 84 27 to gain a foothold."
"16612529","16613730"," Here we go, man. "
"16613890","16615810"," Watch that bar on spy here."
"16615810","16677520"," Oh, I"
"16677520","16678140"," do like that."
"16678200","16678640"," I like that. "
"16678740","16680340"," I like that max greed."

"16693960","16695140"," I'll make those changes tonight."
"16695140","16696500"," I like that fear and greed. "
"16697540","16698400"," Max greed."
"16698820","16700580"," I like that fear and greed."
"16700919","16701300"," Good job. "
"16705110","16706710"," And seven lead farmer."
"16707330","16710310"," What does N seven lead farmer mean bullet farmer?"
"16711330","16712730"," I'm not going to assume it means."
"16725990","16729490"," That's a looking like it wants to grow that second leg on it, doesn't it?"
"16731090","16734210"," It's got like that that tail back there in the open now. "
"16734310","16735610"," It's looking like it wants one more leg."
"16736950","16738189"," What is going on here?"
"16738349","16739910"," What the fuck is going on here?"
"16740869","16742910"," I'm having some real wonkiness start here."

"16784920","16785500"," You want to see Dixie?"
"16787600","16789600"," I'm getting extremely bearish right now."
"16793400","16795140"," Dude, what the fuck is going on?"
"16795300","16800860"," What's fucking, what the fuck is going on with, um, get some real wonky shit going on right now. "

"16868860","16870120"," That's what I'm assuming is happening."
"16870800","16872820"," Windows is forcing an update on me right now."

"23409850","23411710"," Let's let me do a couple of things here with you."
"23412930","23416190"," So we squeezed up to the squeeze zone up here right. "
"23416450","23421050"," We know that they want to sell this, right?"
"23421210","23422450"," They don't want this to happen."

"23428330","23430910"," squeeze zone typically gets rejected."
"23431090","23433510"," It's very normal happens quite often. "
"23433950","23436050"," That leaves the question mark, right?"
"23436330","23438550"," Do we gap up into tomorrow?"
"23439230","23442650"," Do we pull back for this crush Friday?"
"23443430","23445770"," We're going to take a look at it right now."
"23447170","23449690"," Let's see if we can see right here."
"23450850","23455370"," Now, just stay with me here on this five-minute channel right here. "
"23455430","23456130"," You see this channel?"

"23459990","23462110"," Seems like a good place to short, right?"
"23462330","23463110"," See it right there?"
"23464390","23466190"," Seems like a decent place to short."
"23466590","23468010"," What are you looking for?"
"23468010","23471590"," You're looking for a breakdown right here, right on R2, right?"
"23471770","23477130"," So let's look at that and see what can we deduce tomorrow. "
"23478290","23480150"," Let's take a quick look at that right now."
"23481050","23483490"," We're going to switch over to..."
"23483490","23485050"," Hold on here."
"23485110","23486230"," I got a bunch of stuff I got to do. "

"23497630","23499270"," Bears did not get it."
"23499450","23503030"," Did they just bounce up, blast it up higher?"
"23504070","23508710"," And let's take a look at what the expectation would be into tomorrow."
"23509230","23516910"," So this hourly trigger into tomorrow should be right here, okay, by tomorrow. "
"23518310","23522530"," So it's at 448.35 right now."
"23522610","23526070"," I'm going to expect this to come into play tomorrow."
"23526670","23535770"," And then your daily trigger, your daily trigger I don't like, it is not coming up with the market. "
"23536150","23546110"," So this daily trigger here is still down below at 445.80. Has not moved, has not"
"23546110","23547950"," moved in any way, shape or form."
"23549250","23551290"," That is some cause for concern."
"23553290","23555650"," I'm going to lower this down here. "
"23556950","23561250"," And just keep an eye on that right there for this previous low right here."
"23562090","23565570"," Right, we were up here and now we're down here, seller below."
"23565930","23566930"," Nothing's changed, right?"
"23570230","23572110"," There's getting nothing here, right?"
"23572850","23576390"," We've got the daily, the hourly trigger right here, right?"
"23578570","23579770"," For tomorrow. "
"23580590","23582310"," I'm going to tell you guys something."
"23583570","23589030"," I was just talking to a friend right now and I said to him, I said to him as a"
"23589030","23592970"," friend, I said I would not short that close."
"23593710","23595570"," I would not short that close. "
"23595690","23597050"," I'm going to show you why right now."
"23597250","23597370"," Okay."
"23598630","23600890"," I'm going to put this on a 15 minute right here. "
"23602050","23605190"," I'm going to show you something here."
"23605890","23608110"," Just way back here."
"23609130","23610550"," One hour right there. "
"23610650","23611430"," See that right there?"
"23612230","23613150"," See this right here?"
"23613390","23614690"," Pay attention to this right here."
"23614870","23620350"," You got that, you got that, and we still haven't quite hit this, have we?"
"23621350","23624930"," So let's take a look here, close, uncloser inspection."
"23626250","23627310"," So one hour chart. "
"23627750","23628810"," Look what that looks like."
"23628970","23630610"," I want to tell you guys something here, okay?"
"23631290","23631890"," Into this close."
"23632130","23635170"," If you stuck with me into this close right now, you're still listening broadcast. "
"23635910","23640950"," I'm going to tell you what my expectation is into tomorrow and that is a gap up."
"23641690","23651210"," I'm going to look for a gap up here into tomorrow and an opening price of 451.98 somewhere in"
"23651210","23651370"," here."
"23651650","23653130"," I expect that gap up tomorrow. "
"23653730","23661170"," Now if we don't get that gap up tomorrow because of the rate of the hourly trigger racing up here,"
"23661330","23666710"," I'm going to expect any kind of dip to be bought to put us up here."
"23667130","23676450"," Now saying that if you are expecting after Friday, if you're expecting or in Friday, you're"
"23676450","23685310"," expecting this massive roll down, this massive roll down, I'm also going to tell you that into next"
"23685310","23687250"," week for the 19th."
"23687890","23689870"," Let's look at the 19th right here. "
"23690770","23693470"," This is when we get the Fed speaker, right?"
"23694690","23696150"," So watch me closely."
"23696550","23698390"," Mr. J Palmself right here, right?"
"23698890","23699930"," I believe that's on Tuesday."
"23700710","23702570"," So watch me closely here, okay?"
"23704590","23706250"," Watch me closely here. "
"23706370","23707110"," What's setting up?"
"23708210","23709430"," Oh baby."
"23711550","23712390"," Oh baby."
"23712570","23713430"," What's setting up here?"
"23713570","23714150"," You want to see it?"
"23714570","23715550"," It's right here. "
"23715650","23718570"," You come up here into Friday, right?"
"23718730","23724290"," You come down, wrap it up for the weekend, come back into Tuesday, right?"
"23724710","23731590"," And boom, we get planted and I'm telling you what, telling you what, dude, telling you, telling"
"23731590","23741370"," you, not only that, but that 470, that 46650, I want to tell you, unless, unless J"
"23741370","23746970"," Pal, unless J Pal has his way, let me show it to you a better way here."
"23750380","23753480"," Oh, what's going on?"
"23753660","23754180"," SPX."
"23755520","23756680"," What's going on?"
"23756860","23757540"," Look at SPX. "
"23757980","23759920"," Look at this for me right here, right now."
"23760620","23763040"," If we gap up, right?"
"23763160","23770220"," If we gap up here into tomorrow, come back down here into the 19th, right?"
"23771340","23773560"," And you start doing this shit up here."
"23775520","23785180"," You know, this is, if you're a bear, your only hope here is that J Pal is on your side. "
"23785820","23786660"," Give what I'm saying?"
"23788160","23790080"," Do not want this happening."
"23790560","23799400"," We talked yesterday, we talked yesterday about putting on a put back spread, I think yesterday, day"
"23799400","23807520"," before, and we had said, we had said to you that rather than short the market down here for this"
"23807520","23815780"," blood bath, we told you, if you put a put back spread on, wouldn't be so bad, would it?"
"23817680","23821900"," So watch this for 55, watch this right here."
"23823040","23824920"," See that line right there?"
"23825320","23832660"," You get the gap up overnight, come back down here where the sellers are, wait for the 19th, the old"
"23832660","23838840"," man says, eat my ass or something, and then boom, we literally run and pin that up there. "
"23839920","23842020"," Run and pin that to the upside."
"23842540","23848120"," So be really careful of a gap up overnight tonight is my point, just right here."
"23848200","23849380"," Let me show it to you right now, okay?"
"23851060","23852880"," Be really careful, okay?"
"23854020","23855080"," See that right there?"
"23856220","23864280"," We just gap this up on the overnight, right in a Friday, come back down, monster this bad boy down,"
"23864460","23866920"," and then you get set up for the 19th down here. "
"23867060","23869080"," So just be careful inside here."
"23869400","23871060"," We are there right now."
"23871680","23874500"," I mean, we are for all for all intensive purposes. "
"23875420","23878980"," I got some weirdness going on for all intensive purposes."
"23878980","23884780"," This is the top, you know, not a bad place to short, but if you see that gap up so"
"23884780","23888440"," that we're over that plane of sellers, man, watch out, dude."
"23888620","23889980"," Watch out into tomorrow. "
"23890880","23892840"," Absolutely watch out into tomorrow."
"23893300","23896840"," Let me know in the chat if you are bullish or bearish in tomorrow."
"23897460","23901060"," If you are putting on put spreads tomorrow, I can't blame you. "
"23901900","23906720"," I can't blame you, but oh, we're already going up to 30 gap in this shit right now."
"23907120","23908920"," It's 410 and they're already doing it to you."
"23909300","23909860"," Look at that. "
"23909980","23910720"," They've already got you."
"23910820","23912260"," They trapped you again right here."
"23913000","23914560"," Oh, doggy. "
"23916340","23921100"," Oh, so I told you, I told you to watch out."
"23921520","23923960"," Hopefully some put buyers are getting out right now."
"23923960","23928520"," Some put spread buyers price target for tomorrow. "
"23928520","23929380"," Are you ready for it?"
"23930700","23932760"," Unless the hourly trigger breaks here."
"23933200","23934940"," I'll draw it and we'll check it out tomorrow."
"23935100","23936260"," We'll check it out and see you ready. "
"23937340","23938460"," So right there."
"23938620","23938800"," Okay."
"23940480","23940980"," Right. "
"23941220","23942220"," They're going to place it up there."
"23943340","23944760"," Right there."
"23948130","23950670"," So we'll see if we gap that up into tomorrow. "
"23950690","23954350"," That's the expectation right there into tomorrow."
"23954350","23955790"," You don't want to see that, dude."
"23956310","23957390"," You see that tomorrow. "
"23958050","23963750"," Like when we're doing this, one of the best things to short this shit is when it's confirmed,"
"23963750","23964310"," right?"
"23964930","23968450"," Did we break the five do we break this five minute right here?"
"23968630","23968770"," Fuck."
"23968950","23969670"," No, we didn't."
"23970410","23975230"," So until that happens, we're still hot and running right here. "
"23975670","23978550"," There is no put buying here from my perspective."
"23979170","23985150"," As a matter of fact, the algos are long right now and you've got four minutes left."
"23985790","23988050"," The algo is saying stay long right now. "
"23988210","23990790"," So be careful of this tomorrow."
"23990790","23992290"," Maybe this comes back a little bit."
"23992390","23993350"," We'll put that right there. "
"23994030","23995910"," See if they can push this up or something."
"23996970","23998450"," Something like that right there."
"23998570","24000970"," Maybe a little bit of weakness into the open tomorrow. "
"24000970","24001790"," Panic everybody."
"24002590","24005230"," But I'm telling you what that right there is there."
"24005850","24008130"," You probably should not be shorting this close. "
"24008530","24010030"," Please don't short this close."
"24011950","24013710"," They're looking for you right now, man."
"24013850","24016950"," They're going to put this shit up in the, I think they're going to put it up in the overnight. "
"24018790","24022150"," Now, if you're a bull and you're like, I want to dip to buy cap."
"24022750","24025270"," Your dip is likely down here on Tuesday."
"24026590","24028210"," That's your dip buy right there. "
"24028270","24031370"," If you're going to get a dip buy, it's going to be down there on Tuesday."
"24031730","24031910"," Okay."
"24032270","24033550"," You guys have all this. "
"24033770","24035110"," Are you good until tomorrow morning?"
"24035570","24036330"," Any questions?"
"24037410","24038330"," Oh, yeah, doggy."
"24039290","24040250"," JPM caller."
"24041450","24042510"," JP caller. "
"24043350","24045830"," You want to cut that all out or something like that?"
"24045890","24047350"," You want to see what's up over here?"
"24047350","24049070"," You want to take a snip of this?"
"24049990","24050930"," Oh, yeah."
"24052770","24054710"," This would be the pain, right?"
"24054830","24055530"," You want the real pain?"
"24055970","24056770"," Right up there."
"24057850","24059410"," That's the real pain right there. "
"24060010","24063370"," Double top all the way down or inverse head and shoulders in the daily."
"24065770","24067790"," Right there, right down that way."
"24068850","24070510"," I would not be shorting this. "
"24070510","24071610"," I wouldn't."
"24071730","24072530"," I wouldn't."
"24072650","24074050"," Too strong right now. "
"24074690","24075850"," Too strong."
"24076130","24077570"," And there's that perception."
"24078690","24079350"," Yeah, dude. "
"24080050","24080610"," Bullish."
"24080810","24082670"," I am bullish in the tomorrow of right now."
"24083150","24083470"," Don't know. "
"24083590","24084970"," I would not short this shit."
"24085170","24086530"," Do not short this shit."
"24087710","24090030"," So right in there, something like that. "
"24090270","24090810"," Like be"
"24090810","24100810"," really careful you 88."
"24101530","24102350"," Something like that."
"24102650","24103050"," 452. "
"24103370","24104530"," So 452s."
"24105650","24106050"," 453s."
"24106150","24106810"," Something like that. "
"24113610","24114410"," Arm baby."
"24115190","24118230"," I'm telling you, aren't he arms not done for five days."
"24119190","24119970"," Five sessions. "
"24121190","24121590"," Five."
"24121610","24123270"," You guys never believe me until afterwards."
"24124090","24127410"," And you guys come back and you guys, you guys come back afterwards and ask if you can buy. "
"24127570","24128690"," I'm like, I don't know what to say to these guys."
"24128690","24129390"," I love them."
"24129910","24131550"," But I have no idea what to say to them. "
"24132910","24134630"," I have no idea what to say to you guys sometimes."
"24136370","24137290"," I really don't."
"24137410","24138410"," I'm like, what do I say to these guys?"
"24138790","24139650"," Like, I tell them where to buy. "
"24139810","24140190"," They don't buy."
"24140790","24141670"," We run all the way up."
"24141830","24143490"," They get bullish and then it's time to sell. "
"24143870","24145570"," So I don't want to say to you."
"24146090","24146830"," I love you."
"24147350","24149470"," But you know, arm same thing, right?"
"24149990","24152090"," Let's look at arm really quick and see what they said. "
"24152090","24156270"," So arm, let's look at it."
"24156470","24156610"," Okay."
"24161050","24165330"," Let's look at, I said to you, I have a matter of fact, even posted this chart, right?"
"24166410","24169190"," I said buyer above, right?"
"24170170","24170170"," There. "
"24171090","24172410"," Seller below, right?"
"24173890","24178950"," Came down, bounced, recovered onto this moment right here."
"24179030","24181730"," As soon as you saw that, what would you have been there?"
"24182010","24183010"," Long as fuck, right?"
"24183210","24184130"," Long all the way up."
"24184870","24186090"," Long all the way up. "
"24186310","24187490"," Price targets to the upside."
"24188130","24196150"," R3, next target to the upside, 69.99. And then we've got above that, we're going to, well, I think"
"24197670","24200670"," that 100 bucks is like the mental thing."
"24201290","24203350"," I think you'll get the roll coming into 100 bucks. "
"24203630","24206070"," And then I think you're going to get one more attempt to get over it."
"24206490","24209170"," And you might get to like 125 at max."
"24210250","24211450"," And they're just going to unload. "
"24211510","24213410"," They're following the close of the U.S. cash equity's markets."
"24213410","24216470"," It's going to give you guys a quick market rapid decision today."
"24217030","24221530"," So equity's climbed today was data on U.S. producer prices and retail sales. "
"24221530","24222110"," That's not for you."
"24222110","24222770"," That's not for you."
"24222870","24223210"," That's not for you. "
"24224070","24226850"," That's not why we're gapping up."
"24227190","24229250"," You're just making up bullshit excuses."
"24229930","24231530"," That's why you need to put the news on. "
"24231790","24232830"," It's not why we gapped up."
"24233310","24233770"," Okay."
"24234770","24235790"," Sorry about that. "
"24235910","24238690"," I got to, I got to respectfully disagree with news people."
"24239390","24241970"," And dude, look at these buyers in the five minute right here."
"24242010","24243910"," Look at that big buyers right here. "
"24244390","24250570"," Look at these guys smashing in, smashing in, auto buying, buying, buying, buying end of order."
"24250690","24251690"," Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye."
"24253150","24253590"," Yeah. "
"24258890","24261350"," Where would I own our arm for a long term hold?"
"24262830","24265990"," I would not want to own it right now for a long term hold."
"24267250","24272010"," I think that whatever it hits up there at 100, 150, they're going to sell it down on you."
"24273370","24278310"," I think they're going to sell it down right into when those people are allowed to come out of their"
"24278310","24278630"," holdings. "
"24279270","24282110"," So let's say they got 180 days or something like that to hold."
"24282730","24285330"," They will run it down on those on those bag holders."
"24285950","24291150"," And those bag holders are going to have to sell for profit or for a loss or wait until it"
"24291150","24292110"," comes back up again. "
"24292710","24294470"," I have history on my side on this."
"24295910","24299390"," Outside of MBLY, MBLY."
"24299470","24303910"," You guys know trading MBLY outside of that ticker in the last three years. "
"24304470","24309670"," It's not an easy thing to not like rip face and then sell."
"24310090","24312150"," So it's not that it won't go up there."
"24312170","24314230"," It's that they're going to sell that shit into you. "
"24314590","24316150"," I want you to remember something."
"24316410","24316610"," Okay."
"24316870","24319310"," I talk about this in the show all the time because it's a good question. "
"24320790","24326090"," This market outside of fraud does not give a fuck about your fundamentals."
"24326610","24336330"," When they care to an of every market since the beginning of time."
"24337830","24340590"," You should read a book called hedge fund market wizards. "
"24341630","24343250"," As long as there's no fraud, right?"
"24344010","24347890"," They will run tickers up and run them down regardless of what you think."
"24348650","24355390"," You need to switch as a buyer and seller to who owns it where and where they take in profit."
"24355830","24357910"," It's a very important thing for you to grasp. "
"24358990","24362650"," As an investor, as a trader, I like but good fundamentals."
"24363430","24367530"," But I promise you that the markets are not the markets do not trade."
"24367530","24369770"," They trade to those when it's convenient. "
"24370410","24371150"," That's about it."
"24371710","24372170"," Okay."
"24372770","24374170"," That's a great question, by the way. "
"24374510","24376730"," So where would I own arm?"
"24377150","24378010"," I don't it right now."
"24378250","24380330"," I don't it right now into about a hundred bucks."
"24380970","24385230"," And then I'd look to sell it and get back in at probably you ready for it?"
"24385230","24388830"," Like 20 bucks, more than likely 20, $30. "
"24394430","24396450"," Yeah, I agree with that way overvalued."
"24396830","24400730"," It's going to go right down to the dumpster fire and they're going to force those people to sell."
"24401090","24406110"," Matter of fact, I'm going to give a projection here that the moment they open up that where they"
"24406110","24412430"," can sell, you're then going to see a mass selling and a huge price drop. "
"24412790","24417330"," And then the right people are going to be able to buy in at a very low number, eight, 10"
"24417330","24422550"," bucks, 12 bucks, 20 bucks somewhere in there would not be shocked at that would not blink if that"
"24422550","24422910"," happened."
"24429130","24430630"," How long to go?"
"24430670","24432190"," Probably 180 days."
"24433450","24440890"," If we're looking to short that, if there's a short that presents itself on arm, we will short it. "
"24441050","24450570"," So we'll watch it until it starts you'll see the failure to get a new high"
"24450570","24453510"," and we will begin to sell that down together."
"24454710","24455550"," We'll do it together."
"24456290","24463470"," Don't worry, as I got you guys, we'll track it closely the next week or so, week or so. "
"24463590","24464210"," It shouldn't take long."
"24466010","24470030"," It shouldn't take long to get to a hundred bucks and it shouldn't take long to start selling it."
"24474340","24475520"," Exactly, exactly. "
"24475920","24478060"," You look up for the lock, the lock up expire exactly."
"24479400","24481340"," And then you start selling into those people, right?"
"24481480","24482340"," People panic sell."
"24482900","24487160"," Those people will be stuck in their shares and they're going to be waiting for that price. "
"24487300","24489040"," If they please stay up there, please stay up there."
"24489320","24493140"," It's going to drop below wherever they bought in and then they're going to capitulate panic sell"
"24493140","24495880"," and it'll it'll it'll it'll like a fucking rock."
"24495880","24498880"," It'll drop to zero, not zero, but quite low. "
"24504010","24504450"," Yeah."
"24505050","24506670"," Yeah, we got X div this week too."
"24506890","24507670"," We got X div. "
"24508150","24509110"," We've got OPEX."
"24509130","24510010"," We've got X div."
"24510210","24512990"," We've got VIX expiry coming up next week. "
"24513170","24516070"," We've got J-POW next week."
"24516210","24517730"," We got all kinds of shit going on next week."
"24518310","24519710"," I'm going to tell you guys something, okay?"
"24520570","24522050"," I'm going to tell you guys some secret. "
"24523210","24530370"," I know for a fucking fact that you guys pay for services out there that told you that a market"
"24530370","24531590"," crash was coming on Wednesday."
"24532750","24533670"," I already know."
"24534730","24539710"," And that shit didn't happen and that ain't the first fucking time those services have told you that"
"24539710","24539950"," either. "
"24540690","24542210"," So I want you to be aware of that."
"24542730","24544750"," That that shit did not happen like they claimed."
"24545530","24548390"," These are people that are well respected in the community. "
"24548390","24550650"," They probably fucking sold right into you."
"24551150","24553590"," They were probably fucking paid to sell right into you."
"24553710","24554990"," So just heads up out there. "
"24555650","24558170"," They fucking were wrong again."
"24559350","24562490"," I'll see all of you guys tomorrow at 9.30 in the morning."
"24567450","24568170"," Netflix action. "
"24568610","24572810"," I love you, Nino."
"24573590","24576750"," I don't mean all of you but I know some of you are watching and listening in right now and"
"24576750","24577010"," you did."
"24577270","24581210"," So I know, I know you guys, not all of you but I know some of you know what I'm"
"24581210","24581770"," talking about. "
"24582170","24583530"," You know who I'm talking about too."
"24583930","24587430"," I'll talk to you "
