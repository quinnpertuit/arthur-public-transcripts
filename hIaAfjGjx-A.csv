"hIaAfjGjx-A","0","7080"," Hey Triders, Captain Jim James here. Happy Sunday. Hope you all had a great weekend. I've"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","7080","12240"," been slowing down the videos that I make as I want to see them play out either against"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","12240","18480"," or within video, right? Or whatever I talked about in them. So I just wanted to give an"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","18480","22080"," update video to my last one as to where we are. But before we do that, I want to talk"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","22080","27600"," about current macro view point of our market. In 2020 in March, right? Well, first of all,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","27600","36160"," we have for two years. Two years we've had an established trading channel, right? This"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","36160","40160"," works since March 2020. Now we created this trading channel. It's been working for two"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","40160","48440"," straight years. We had this major dip within this channel way back in March. And we've"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","48440","54240"," been trading within this channel for almost two years. Not quite, not quite, but you know,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","54240","61880"," here in three quarters, something like that, right? And we had one more major dip here"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","61880","70600"," in October. And we've worked our, fought our way back into the old trading channel. Now,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","70600","80360"," I know that there are, well, I should say I trust Elliott Wave, but I do question how"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","80360","89560"," far back you're going, right? Are you starting it way back pre-industrial revolution? Are you"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","89560","95560"," starting it in the industrial revolution? Did you start it 1930s? You know, often people don't"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","95560","106120"," talk about how we skipped a bubble period at the turn of the century due to the industrialization's"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","106120","111240"," effect on our stock markets around the world. And we're kind of in that same situation right now"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","112520","119400"," with tech, right? We have some big changes coming down the line with AI. We've got changes"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","119400","125880"," coming down with computing. We've got changes coming with exploration and space, new currencies."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","125880","133560"," We have major changes to our markets operate, modern monetary theory. We just had an epidemic"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","133640","139400"," that we've never experienced before. Everyone says, right here, oftentimes,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","139400","144120"," yellowed up in changes is always the same. If you want to talk about it's always the same,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","144120","149080"," then you have to look back towards the industrial revolution and how we did skip a bubble during"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","149080","154280"," that time period. I'm going to assume that some of you don't check that history. So anyways,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","154280","159320"," my point though is this, is that for the last two years, we've traded in this channel. And"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","159320","163080"," even if you were to say we're in a fifth wave or something, you know, way back here in March,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","163080","167640"," this, a lot of people were calling this the fifth wave or wave five, right? And we were going"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","167640","172680"," to continue down to the right. And meanwhile, for a year and a half, we didn't fucking do that."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","174280","179160"," So how do you count the waves in Elliott theory or an Elliott wave forecast or whatever? You know,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","179160","187800"," it takes big computing, takes lots of money, it takes software, it takes a lot of tools that most"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","187800","197640"," of us don't have to count properly. So I have a tough time with some with some counts that are"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","197640","203560"," out there. Because I know that right now, this is the thought is that this is the end of a way,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","203560","207640"," a big wave, and we're going to roll over this way. You know, but this this over here looked"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","207640","211400"," like we were going to do it too. We didn't, you know, but what does count is this is that"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","212200","217000"," this training channel has been respected for two years, almost two years. And we fought back to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","217000","222920"," get into this training channel in October. So we've had one major crash back here in March,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","222920","228920"," and we just had a dip to these same similar to these same levels. It's a little bit lower down"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","228920","234280"," here. I believe this was the 200, but this is deep. This is a deep correction that we just had."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","235080","241080"," And we recovered. So when I hear people on social media talking about, well, this is oversold,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","241720","247000"," the RSI is fucked up, the MACD is fucked up. All these things, I'm like, yeah, we just fought back"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","247000","252520"," from this correction back into our old training channel. And all of a sudden, you've got people"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","252520","261160"," wanting to create this new trading channel that's trading below. And to establish that new trading"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","261160","267000"," channel is going to take a lot more than what I'm seeing in the news right now. And if you're a"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","267000","271080"," real bear, what you really want to be seeing for a bubble is something vertical."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","272360","277960"," I got bears out here talking about this bad happening, that bad happening. Market crash is coming."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","279800","287720"," And that's all fine and good. But in reality, our institutions, our banks, our institutions,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","287720","295880"," our politicians, our companies, they will run our markets, whether they be bonds or cash market."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","295880","302120"," They will run them until they break. They'll drive them until they break. If you're a real"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","302120","306920"," bear out there, you should know that. You should know that they're never going to tell you until"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","306920","313240"," it's fucking broken. And they're going to run it up at the end to get all their money out before"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","314360","320360"," they fucking break it or it breaks to the news. That's how it's always happened in the past."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","320440","325480"," So if you're a bear out there, what are you trying to say? You're trying to say that fucking"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","326520","333160"," Goldman fucking sacks cares about running it up. That's insane. You're going to tell me that"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","333160","338200"," our politicians give a fuck about running it up. That's insane as well. If you're a bear,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","338200","343800"," you should be thinking they are going to run it up. They are going to go fucking straight vertical"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","344520","351480"," and they're going to fucking fuck it all up. So get long until we get fucked. That's my point,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","351480","356600"," I guess. Maybe that makes me the biggest bear out there. Is that I don't fucking trust any"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","356600","363720"," of our politicians. I don't trust our banks. I don't trust our companies. I just don't."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","363720","369800"," So I don't believe for a minute that they are going to roll this market over until they have"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","369880","374440"," taken every last drop out of it. I don't think the politicians that are for election this"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","374440","378360"," next cycle want to rock the boat. I think that goes for Democrats and Republicans."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","379240","386040"," So I'm just not seeing this institutional political, oh yeah, we're going to take the"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","386040","393080"," market down right now before the next election, before I exit out side side door left or right"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","393080","399080"," or whatever. I just don't see it. I just don't unless there's something unknown that breaks to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","399160","404520"," the public like it has in the past. You start to see the cracks but we're not seeing the cracks"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","404520","410840"," yet. Evergrande's not really the cracks for us yet either. We really need something that is going"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","410840","416520"," to collapse that we don't know about, that they know about, that they know they've broken the machine"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","417480","422040"," and when they do know that they've broken the machine, they're going to fucking drive it straight"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","422040","427640"," up vertical so that they can exit at full profit and then they're going to ride that"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","427640","430920"," bitch down. I shouldn't be saying bitch but they're going to ride this thing down"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","431720","437400"," to the bottom. That's how it's done. So start understanding that. That's how it's done"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","438600","443400"," right that no one loves you. No one loves me. They don't care about what you want and what I want."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","444040","448200"," They don't care about some guy with half a million dollars. They don't care about a guy with 20"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","448200","455880"," million dollars. These people have billions, trillions on the line before they're going to pull the plug."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","456760","463000"," All right, so that's my only point. That's my only rant today about the market crash talk that's"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","463000","468760"," been going on and the Elliot wave is proving it right now and that kind of shit. Until it gets"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","468760","476600"," disproven right now if you're only using 30% of your money buying any of these pullbacks or corrections"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","477400","486440"," and as we've talked about ad nauseam with risk and time, right, adding more risk as we make these"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","486440","491720"," dips and adding less time and getting more aggressive for the next push up. It has worked for two"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","491720","501800"," straight years and it worked before. It's worked total since 2008 a long time. So I'm not calling"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","501800","505160"," any tops around here. I don't think that you should be calling any tops. I don't think that"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","505240","510680"," you should be following anybody calling any tops right now. I think it's very dangerous and even"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","510680","518040"," if you were to lose 30%, not calling the top, you still saved 70% whether that's in cash"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","519160","527080"," or some sort of asset that doesn't depreciate in a crash. Okay, real estate, you fucking pick them."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","528040","532920"," Even gold dumps off when that happens, right? We know that gold still falls off"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","533560","538920"," during a market crash. We know Bitcoin will fall off during a market crash. So you should be having"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","538920","543400"," some real estate. You should, if you want to have gold or you bought gold and it was all that's fine."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","543400","554760"," But in reality, just like Buffett, I'm cash rich to try to be able to withstand one of those events,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","554760","561800"," right? And I'm only playing with 30% total. Sometimes I go a little bit deeper, I get a little greedy"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","561800","566360"," and that's very risky for me to do. But in reality, if you don't want to lose your shirt,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","566360","573640"," you can easily step into risk in this market and always be making money. And I have video after"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","573640","578680"," video after video on how to accomplish that. And that proved itself down here again. And this was"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","578680","586040"," an ugly one down here. And right now for where we are, I don't, all these indicators, all I'm"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","586040","589640"," seeing is our old same old trading channel. And we're at the bottom of it right now."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","590440","596760"," So let's discuss my last video that I made where I talked about where we were. We were somewhere"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","597960","604120"," right in this area right here. And I told you that my price target is actually way up much higher,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","604120","612520"," 478 or 480, somewhere up in here. And we, and I talked to about, we didn't have a lot of time"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","612520","618920"," before OPEX to get up there. And that as time passed, we could dip below. But even in that dip,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","619800","624520"," I talked about where that dip was. And I told you that the worst that dip would be would be on"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","624520","630520"," this trend line right here. And sure enough, the deepest we went, we tagged it. We tagged it to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","631160","636680"," the exact number where to buy that dip. And then we were given another chance over here"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","636760","645880"," of consolidation for a push up on Friday. So my long thesis stays the same in here. And any"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","645880","652040"," dip buying that you can do has still proved itself. So since my last video, right, was"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","652040","656680"," started somewhere back in the beginning of the month, on the third or the fifth or something,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","657640","663720"," we're talking about, we're talking about still being bullish. Nothing in this context here says"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","663720","669320"," that we are bearish. Nothing. We've been moving up, we've been moving up since October 20th,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","669320","674360"," or even before, if you look at this big move over here, the banks and the institutions are"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","674360","679320"," long this market. That's what they are. They're risk on. That's what they are. They're not risk"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","679320","685160"," off. We wouldn't be up here. We wouldn't have recovered if we were risk off. So that's my"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","685160","691000"," context is that we're risk on no matter what anybody's saying. That's where we did. We came up here."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","691000","696280"," And we have OpEx coming up here. I did take a look at the seasonality charts,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","696280","700600"," or a couple seasonality charts, one that showed presidential years and one that showed non-presidential"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","700600","707240"," years. And I know some people are thinking we're back into 2018, that holiday season,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","707240","712440"," but I'm not viewing it from that view, but I'm viewing it from an off presidential election season."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","713800","720280"," I still believe that we try to make this run up here to 480 before or during OpEx between now"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","720360","726440"," and then we're going to try to make this last push, or at least keep it above for the OpEx date"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","726440","731400"," so that the banks and institutions can get their prints in. Maybe we fall off down here,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","731400","736280"," but even if we do at that point, the 21-day moving average will have curled up."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","738280","742760"," And even if we could come up here, the 21 and the 50 are going to move up into back into this"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","742760","747560"," trading channel. So even if we come back down, we're going to tag them in a more reasonable place."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","748520","755720"," So keep that in mind as time passes for where the price is in ES and SPY and the rest of the market,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","755720","762120"," they're bringing these moving averages up into this trading channel. And then just to go briefly"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","762120","767320"," back, looking back on those non-presidential election years, we have a really good end of"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","767320","773800"," November, and then we have a fair sell-off in the beginning of December, but then we rip"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","773800","778440"," into the end of December. So maybe we get two holiday runs this year. Maybe we make this 480"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","778440","785880"," push, and then we make another push to 500 before the end of December. Now I do have some concerns"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","785880","791240"," because I do follow some Elliott Wave guys that are saying we're going to get that fifth wave"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","791240","798520"," in some point in 2020, or excuse me, 2022. So there are going to be people trying to exit their"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","798520","804120"," lungs early this Christmas. If everyone's saying we're doing Christmas rally, the question becomes,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","804120","810680"," does it grind up into the 23rd or the 31st, or does it start selling off before that 17th? Everybody's"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","810680","818120"," long to the 17th of December, which is concerning. You can't have every time Dick and Harry and Mary"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","818120","823960"," up on the same calls, right, or puts, right? Everybody's long and everybody's short, we know"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","823960","828680"," what happens. So I do have some concern there if it takes all the way to the end of the year,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","828680","835080"," or maybe even into January 15th. But we'll deal with that later. But for right now,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","835080","842200"," this market is long. And if you play properly, you should not be blowing up your accounts."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","842200","846760"," And if you're going to be bearish, we're always talking about going back to that. I'm bearish"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","846760","853480"," 10% of the time 30% of the time. The spy specifically, this index is built by the ES,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","853480","858840"," the S&P 500, the SPX, it is built to go up. The companies that are put into this index"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","859560","865800"," are picked because they perform. They're expected to perform. They take companies out"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","865800","870120"," that are not expected to perform. This is the raw, I mean, you want to, if you want a short"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","870120","874280"," like Tesla or Apple or something else like that, or some company that's got bad news,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","874280","880680"," that's one thing. But when you start trying to short, the spy, it's real hard to do because"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","880680","887320"," it is built to go up. It's built around some old guy named Bob that lives out in Chicago's"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","887320","891480"," pension plan, right? It's built around all these different things. It's built to go up."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","892760","900120"," That's the job of the spy. It's not built to, it is built to signal where the market is,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","900120","906040"," like the Dow is right with the health of the market. But to try to short it for any length time"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","906040","915640"," for me is not just a challenge, but hard to be proclaiming with a million followers on YouTube"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","916360","923880"," with market crashes coming. You're going to lose. You are going to fucking lose. You're going to lose."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","924680","931080"," Mike Barry lost for years. And even when he won, he would have won more being long during that"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","931080","936360"," time period. No one talks about that shit. They say, Oh, look, Mike won. But what they don't talk"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","936360","941800"," about is how much he would have won if he had been long during that period of him being short."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","943080","947240"," If I was liquid enough, I could be short as well until this thing crashes."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","947240","952440"," Or you could be short, but you and I are not. We're retail. We have finite resources and we need"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","952440","957960"," to make money where we can. And if we're only risking a set of our money spread out, right,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","957960","967080"," over the risk of a downturn in the market, we shouldn't have any problems. So we should have"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","967080","971560"," some capital invested somewhere. If it's in real estate, if it's in hard cash, I mean,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","971560","977240"," Buffett is great on this, right? He keeps a ton of cash at hand on end at all times, just in case"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","977240","984920"," this happens. Another point you could do would be to just buy yourself penny puts for a quarter."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","984920","990040"," You buy the dirtest cheapest ones you could find. If you're if you're if you're if you're"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","990040","996360"," if you're doing a trading plan for yourself and saying, I've got $100,000, I expect to make another"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","996360","1004760"," 10,000 this quarter, you're going to spend a thousand bucks on some cheap puts three months out."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1004840","1009560"," That's what you're going to do. If you're really wealthy, you shouldn't even be buying this market."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1009560","1016680"," You should just be selling puts, right? Anyways, I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole right now."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1016680","1020840"," What I'm going to talk about is the importance of where we are. And this is the importance."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1020840","1025160"," In the last video, I talked about going to 480. It is still valid right now. It is more"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1025160","1030600"," valid than it is coming down. Also, I talked in the last video about this line right here."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1030600","1036120"," I said to you, if we do, if in any possible chance that we come down and retest this line"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1036120","1041160"," right here, this is your dip buy opportunity. And we had that dip buy opportunity in the 10th."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1042120","1047800"," And then on Friday, you had another dip buy opportunity. And that was to push up. So you've"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1047800","1054360"," had two dip buys. We're still looking to go to 480 before OPEC's even even gets here."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1055160","1059800"," And we know already know that we can throw 90 handles in the board in a week. We got a week."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1060600","1064760"," We know we can throw 90 on them. We know we can we can take them off to heading into"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1064760","1069080"," OPEC's or even the week after OPEC's for that Monday. We know we can burn them off and even"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1069080","1075160"," this Monday after. So we know we've been here before. We know we can do this. Everything is"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1075160","1079560"," still saying bullish. I want to spring you something even closer. On Friday, I was posting"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1080120","1084520"," about if you were short, not to be short, into the weekend. And then sure enough,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1085400","1090360"," you saw sellers being absorbed in this area here. And we curled over and rested on top."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1090760","1097960"," Of this pen and tear. This was a bad a bad look at what? 1800, right? This was a bad look at 6 p.m."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1098520","1103320"," You knew that we were we were finding some support for futures or not what futures,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1103320","1108120"," but after hours was placing it above to see what we're going to do come Monday. If there was no"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1108120","1113000"," bad news over the weekend, we're probably heading up. All that news that you saw about Evergrande"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1113000","1118280"," defaulting over the weekend came from a source from the Express, the Daily Express. That's a"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1118280","1124360"," bullshit shit rag from from the UK. You can't trust news from those people. You have to be"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1124360","1131000"," trusting news like that from good sources, not business insider. You need to be getting them"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1131000","1136360"," from the horse's mouth. You'll hear that shit on CNBC. You'll hear it on Fox Business. You'll"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1136360","1140520"," hear it on the New York Times. You'll hear it on the Wall Street Journal. That's where you want to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1140520","1146200"," get news like that from. Okay. So we haven't had any of that news break over the weekend."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1146280","1149800"," They put it up above here. What does that mean now for us?"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1151160","1156040"," Where are we at? With my last video, it's the same story. Nothing has changed."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1156040","1160760"," And that's the reason why I haven't made any videos is because I'm sticking to this thesis."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1162280","1168040"," The bears are now looking for a couple things in the bulls too. We're looking for the open"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1168040","1174600"," to get the baton to be picked up at cash market and drive this up to 4712."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1175320","1180600"," If you start seeing low volume tomorrow, you start seeing a push up. I'm going to grab that"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1180600","1189320"," long to 4712 or just below it. I am going to wait for the banks or the institutions"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1190120","1195880"," to come up here, right? I want to see them push it up past. I want to see some sort of a rest,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1195880","1200520"," right? Maybe another bounce, right? Before I start getting long, two or three bounces,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1200520","1207400"," we don't collapse and then that push up that goes up to that 4800 up here, right? So I want"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1207400","1215960"," to see what, wait a minute, get rid of this. Leave that dot there. But you, I want to be seeing,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1220840","1221800"," I want to be seeing,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1222520","1232520"," I want to be seeing this quick consolidation or we break right through and keep moving up"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1233160","1239080"," to tag this 480 between now and end of week. This is where your weekly calls can be worth some"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1239080","1245720"," serious money. You could get maybe zero dates for tomorrow if we get some low volume squeeze up."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1245720","1250360"," If shorts start panicking tomorrow, this is easy and then maybe in this zone right here,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1250360","1256440"," you grab call weeklies to tag out at this 4780 or this 4800. I'd probably get out a little bit"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1256440","1263160"," lower. Right before the 4780, I'd probably pull the parachute and wait to see if we start to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1263160","1267560"," sell down. You're going to hear bears talk about if we, this is going to validate even more"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1268200","1272840"," that we're coming back down to the 21 or the 50 and that the fall is going to be doom and gloom,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1272840","1277800"," right? Well, in reality, at this point, the 21 and the 50 are going to move up into this channel."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1277880","1282760"," And so that pullback is going to be a sweet ride down. We'll grab it and then we'll take the next"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1282760","1289720"," holiday run after Thanksgiving into Christmas. We'll get two nice beautiful pumps. We'll get a couple"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1289720","1295960"," nice, a couple nice up and down movements between now and end of year. And this is where all signs"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1295960","1302680"," are pointing. So I'm sticking with this thesis that I have here. It's been looking good here"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1302680","1310280"," since way back here in October. Is there some grand plan of bull trap way up here?"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1310280","1319240"," Because the fucking bull trap started where? 4400 or something. I'm not seeing that bull trap"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1319240","1325960"," anymore. So what I'm really seeing is we're going to go up to that 4800. We're probably going to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1325960","1332920"," make a run for that for that 5000 end of end of December, early January. I do have some issues"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1332920","1340680"," with everybody being long into December 17. Maybe they set us up to dump it and then"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1341480","1346440"," running up into mid January, that's possible. Or we do have a market sell off panic"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1347720","1355160"," before end of December, December ends, because everybody knows that the market's going to go down"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1355160","1361640"," in 2022. So we did some risk as we get up here. But for where we are right now, down below here,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1362280","1367720"," this is the by the dip. We talked about this last video. This was your opportunity. I don't know"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1367720","1372920"," how much more I have to say on that. I did post a bunch of stuff on Twitter, stocks that I'm long"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1372920","1377720"," in. There was rotation last week. I would be I would be staying away from individual stocks."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1377720","1384280"," Did you have noticed that some of the big big cap names that run our indexes, they'll fire one"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1384280","1388200"," off one day or for three days, then they move on to another one. You don't want to be getting"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1388200","1394760"," caught in any of those stocks. I'd be running the indexes all the way up, right? You saw IWM is"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1394760","1399240"," very bullish right now. Even if we were to trade sideways, if you're a bear or if you're a theta"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1399240","1404840"," guy, I wouldn't surprise me if we traded sideways down into OPEC's and then make a push to 4800."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1405400","1409480"," That's possible as well tomorrow. If we don't find banks picking this up tomorrow,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1410360","1414440"," shorts are still fucked in here. Longs could be fucked in here. They could collect all this"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1414440","1420040"," money. Thank you for playing and then make the push up to 4800. But the bare thesis of us coming"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1420040","1424920"," down is over for me, at least for me it is. I'm going to get aggressive on this and I'm assuming"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1424920","1429640"," everybody else is as well. So I'm going to be getting aggressive in here. If we trade sideways"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1429640","1437240"," down below, I'm still aggressive in no way, shape, or form. Am I in any way, bearish from now into"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1437240","1441640"," December, okay? So I don't know what else to say to you. This is my next video. If you want to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1441640","1445640"," start getting bearish, do you want to see how low you have to get to get bearish over here?"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1445640","1451480"," Like you need a break below like 46. You probably need a break below"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1453720","1460440"," somewhere down here, 462075. Even down here, at this point, all this is still open game."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1461160","1469320"," You're talking about 4632? 4650? What is that? 50 handles? No. Yeah, I think it's 50 handles."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1469320","1475240"," We could drop 50 handles right now and still remain bullish right now, okay? So we are not"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1475240","1484520"," in any way, shape, or form. In my view, bearish. And most certainly, are we not market crash bearish"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1484520","1490120"," right now? And I don't know, when I see bearish, market crash bearish, I want to go back to"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1490840","1496680"," some crash where we lost, I don't know, 1000 points, you know, some stupid like that."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1496680","1499240"," That's what I want to be seeing. I don't want to see this slow roll over shit,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1500280","1507320"," this Elliott wave stuff until this fifth wave five with an extension, all this other nonsense."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1507320","1512520"," We're running hot and we're going to continue to run hot and don't get caught as we run hot"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1513240","1518280"," buying that top. That top is going to be, and there was a big trader that said that, there was this"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1518280","1526200"," trader that talked about, you have to be able to get aggressive and that straight up vertical line"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1526200","1533480"," is coming. You don't want to be buying that top. We're not at that top yet, in my view. So anyways,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1533480","1538280"," good luck this week. I hope if you were a bear and you follow me on Twitter that I did post"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1538280","1543160"," two or three times saying I wouldn't be short into this weekend, that there was no gap down"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1543160","1549000"," coming over the weekend. This doesn't look like a gap down situation to me. I hope you didn't get"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1549000","1553400"," caught in it. Even though even if you're a bear, I do love you guys. I don't want you guys to get"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1553400","1558520"," fucked. I want you guys to make money. I want you guys to take all my money and drink my milkshake"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1558520","1563240"," and all that kind of stuff. But beware that 70% of the time you should be bullish,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1564040","1571160"," bullish in this market until we're proven otherwise. You'll know it. Unless you didn't trade last"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1571160","1579160"," March, I guess that would be the last big one, right? Last March or 2020 March was when things got"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1579160","1585720"," real ugly real fast. And even then most people knew it was coming. So, and even if we do crash,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1585720","1589160"," the rides up are going to be more. I mean, that's the other thing. One last thing before I go."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1590040","1595800"," You know, puts on the spy are one for one. You know, sometimes you can make two, three,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1595800","1602200"," four hundred percent. But as we're going down every, every, every support or spike that comes into"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1602200","1608680"," play prints better and higher on the way back up. So, let's say we do fall off a cliff one day."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1609480","1615480"," You're looking to grab any bounce. Those bounces are where the actual money is at. So, I don't know."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1615480","1619880"," I don't want to say to you guys. I love you all. I hope you had a great weekend. I look forward"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1619880","1625560"," to trading with you guys this week. One last note is over the years, I've tried all kinds of"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1625560","1629640"," different, where I'm always harping and ripping on people that are selling subs and selling this"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1629640","1636840"," and selling that, selling doom, that kind of stuff. I say that because I've tried a lot of these"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1637480","1643400"," subscriptions over the years. I've subscribed to trading classes and I've subscribed to different"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1643480","1652120"," options flow and order flow. I've subscribed to news squawk services. You name it. I think"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1652120","1656440"," every once in a while, a fine one that I liked most. Like I subscribe to FlowAlgo."
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1657560","1662360"," As a tool that I use, I've subscribed to every flow service out there. For me, that's the one"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1662360","1667400"," that works best. I don't have any, I'm not recommending that you choose them or not or whatever, but for"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1667400","1674360"," me, that works. I'm trying to save you guys some money out there. I found one more new discord"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1674360","1680920"," that I'm in. It's very pricey, but if it pans out, if I'm making good money, I will tell you guys"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1680920","1685880"," about it, but I want to make sure it's legit first. There'll be more news to come on that down the"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1685880","1690920"," road. I think that's it. I think that's all I got for you guys this week. Keep your chins up,"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1690920","1696120"," make money. That's what we're here for. If you lost money Friday into tonight, heading into"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1696120","1699800"," tomorrow, if you like how it puts over the weekend or something, there's still chances to make money"
"hIaAfjGjx-A","1699800","1707960"," and money. Don't get too frustrated. Good luck and I'll see you all Monday."
