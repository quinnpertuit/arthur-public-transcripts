"58340","63440"," My 45 seconds, there's so much more for Home Depot now, we had a couple of upgrades last week, now"
"63440","65440"," Piper joins the crowd, hold the buy."
"65620","67400"," I want to tell you, good morning out there."
"67800","68580"," How's everybody doing?"
"68700","69240"," It's a great call. "
"69740","71760"," I've been reversing a lot of things that happened last year."
"72140","72820"," You hold the breath?"
"73300","74060"," Hell yeah, hold it."
"74200","79680"," I've got to put spreads, four 78s to four 70s. "
"80560","83680"," You think this call is a decent call?"
"86340","89240"," I've got to take a look at the chart here."
"90700","91840"," One quick second."
"93980","96240"," Why is that not higher back there?"
"96360","97900"," I don't know why that doesn't go well. "
"97920","102520"," Looking out to the market on open imbalance, 341 million to the south side."
"103840","105920"," All right, let's take a quick look at the chart."
"106140","107040"," Take me one quick second here. "
"107600","108980"," I got to do a couple things."
"109880","111560"," Let me get up really quick here."
"111720","113980"," There's S1, there's the pivot to the upside. "
"117080","121880"," Bring that out for you right there, and I'm going to go over where everything is right now."
"122540","126060"," Do me thoughts on how we open Supreme."
"126500","129800"," Do you want to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of music?"
"130020","132060"," One quick second here. "
"132120","133980"," Dude, what is going on?"
"135740","137940"," All right, I don't know why I'm not signed in there."
"138180","139060"," Give me one quick second guys."
"139180","141480"," I've got to do some work in the background here. "
"147000","148660"," Sort comments by newest."
"149100","151760"," The Supreme Court ruling is Apple must change the app store."
"152020","152880"," Members only. "
"162550","163890"," Save all of that."
"165270","167030"," Then let's reset."
"168490","169970"," Quick, really quick. "
"170950","172230"," Everybody do it out there?"
"172510","178970"," Yeah, I've got some put spreads for farther out in time, but they're doing really well this"
"178970","179190"," morning."
"179330","180870"," They're doing well on the off the bell."
"181330","183290"," I'm not going to close them at this point. "
"183290","187090"," We're going to look at the 30 minute chart and see what your thoughts are on this."
"188270","190530"," This morning, we have a ton to go over."
"190670","194330"," There's so much that has gone on over the weekend. "
"195430","197110"," We've got what we've got Davos."
"197110","197890"," We've got earnings."
"198390","199510"," We've got end of month. "
"200590","208270"," We've got a presidential election with an Iowa caucus and big Tesla news breaking over the weekend"
"208270","208850"," as well."
"208850","210350"," We probably have to go over that."
"210610","211970"," Then of course, the price of Tesla. "
"214430","217410"," Then people saying they were buying Tesla all last week, right?"
"218230","220110"," That was not the call."
"220310","221590"," That wasn't the thing to do, was it?"
"222990","224750"," I'm fascinated too about something."
"224870","226550"," We're going to talk about Tesla briefly this morning. "
"227690","234090"," I don't know what it means, but I always get a fly at my ass when certain things I see"
"234090","234610"," out there."
"235110","235950"," We'll talk about that."
"237610","243650"," It's kind of like calling the earth flat kind of a discussion. "
"245350","250710"," I did notice last week that I post this really quick."
"250970","252210"," We had so much crap to go over."
"252310","252790"," It's not even funny. "
"253710","254910"," Let me get through it after."
"255250","259970"," Get through and I'll put my head up for a breather here."
"262350","264650"," Let me just post this on Twitter. "
"269750","275510"," You know what else too is we got a there was a rain and snow line in Michigan, right?"
"275770","285690"," As of last week, the thesis was that we would the thesis was that Michigan"
"285690","289030"," was going to get hit with a ton of rain, maybe some snow and then a cold front."
"289690","294410"," We end up getting some really great snow, right?"
"294530","301010"," We got tons of snow and we got some of the windstorm, but not all that we didn't get the"
"301010","301870"," 50 mile in our wins."
"302070","304250"," We got like 20s, 30s. "
"304330","305050"," We got hit with some cold."
"305550","307290"," It's super cold here right now."
"307390","311750"," It's like minus wind chills of minus of blowing minus 25. "
"312450","317610"," As a matter of fact, my daughter, one of my daughter's schools was canceled this morning."
"319030","320450"," We have we've got kids at our house."
"321130","327210"," We've got like parents left not knowing how to have their kids babysat. "
"327690","334590"," So we're basically like a I guess we're running school this morning at our house, but you know, I"
"334590","336350"," guess parents were left unprepared with that."
"336350","344650"," So my wife is she's I don't know she's some kind of like angel or something and just said here"
"344650","345450"," come to the bosom."
"345450","350210"," So we're like a school in a school at our house this morning. "
"350730","357770"," Now with that snow and stuff though, I was able to ski all weekend and I've been chomping at the"
"357770","358950"," bit to go skiing."
"359970","366650"," So I'm pretty stoked right now that I was able to get a bunch of skiing in this weekend."
"367090","370290"," Now, how does that leave me feeling?"
"372670","373730"," I'm in a lot of pain. "
"375370","376410"," I'm in a lot of pain."
"378670","379950"," I'm in so much pain."
"380150","382570"," This like I so last you know, it's the last night, right?"
"383130","387950"," I get home yesterday and I'm in some pain. "
"388510","391970"," But I didn't realize how much pain I was then until I got home."
"392390","394070"," I don't know if it's like the adrenaline or whatever."
"395790","400650"," I can barely move like I could be putting I could be putting like a wheelchair or something. "
"401070","410930"," Now, of course, I was doing the I was doing the the the the parks with the kids or with"
"410930","412410"," one kid my oldest daughter."
"412890","418470"," She's like a skier that is she likes the glades and the big wide turns."
"419070","421590"," She likes that easy ski and my youngest though. "
"422230","423570"," She's just like me as a kid."
"423810","425070"," So we got problems."
"425630","429330"," This is the kid that wants to like you saw a kid skiing down the hill and she was on"
"429330","429690"," fire. "
"430150","430490"," That's her."
"430770","435670"," She's on fire and she wants to break legs and break arms and all that kind of stuff."
"435850","442430"," So it was, Hey dad, can you hang out in the in the park with me and I'll tell you"
"442430","444410"," later on this morning how that always goes. "
"444410","447190"," But she wants me there, but she doesn't want me there."
"447270","449270"," Oh, I'm losing a I'm losing a camera here."
"450050","451170"," Going out my camera. "
"452010","453730"," I don't know why I'm losing a camera here."
"454870","456330"," It's not supposed to be happening."
"457910","458890"," Try that again. "
"459150","459410"," Okay."
"462090","468530"," So, of course, I'm with my my youngest daughter and I have to pretend that I'm 20."
"468530","473430"," There's like I said kids later in life and you have kids when you're younger. "
"473670","474950"," There's a lot you can do with the kids."
"475070","476630"," When I get when you get older, you have to be."
"477810","483330"," You want to be somewhat that same parent, but being that parent older, not easy. "
"484390","488450"," Like walking around wanting to put a cane on and whatever to pop that on there."
"491640","492120"," Okay."
"492320","494660"," So there's a there's a discussion. "
"495520","498440"," I'm not going to post about talking about Tesla today."
"500060","501300"," Now we're going to look at."
"501760","502080"," Okay. "
"502100","502960"," So that's out of the way."
"503180","504560"," We're going to go through a bunch of stuff this morning."
"504560","507460"," We got a bunch of crap to go to get pencils and papers out at home. "
"508520","512840"," We got a lot of chatting to do this morning and welcome welcome in."
"512960","513980"," Come on in and have a seat."
"514419","515940"," Hope you all had a great weekend, by the way. "
"516880","517840"," We had a great weekend."
"517960","518500"," It was awesome."
"519440","526520"," Uh, skied, skied, skied went to a Airbnb, uh, stayed in a place with a hot tub, which is really"
"526520","526880"," nice. "
"527380","533980"," Uh, that helped maybe me not, or that maybe that helped me feel fine over the weekend, but this is"
"533980","534380"," another thing."
"534420","539740"," I've been meaning to put a hot tub in my house now for a year and I haven't done it."
"539920","541600"," So I'm all upset about not having one. "
"544000","545240"," I've had one in every house."
"545240","548860"," I've owned this house that I'm living in right now."
"548860","551380"," I own, but it's, uh, not. "
"552540","553320"," Oh, hold on."
"553420","554780"," It's not my home or forever home."
"555100","555780"," It's a house that. "
"556440","561020"," I'm trying to, was trying to turn into an Airbnb, now trying to sell, trying to sell everything to"
"561020","561880"," believe it or not."
"562560","568680"," Um, in the coming year, trying to sell into people moving to Detroit by 2020."
"568960","571600"," If I can get out by 2026, I'll be happy. "
"572740","575360"," Uh, so, okay, so we got a bunch of stuff to go over."
"575500","578380"," We're going to first go to the trigger screen here."
"579640","583340"," And we're going to look at a 30 minute starts really quick. "
"583340","587300"," And just take a peek as to where we are here."
"589260","593240"," Now we have busted out from a so you can see this."
"595880","597520"," This is switches over here. "
"599140","600660"," We got these lows that."
"600900","601520"," Oh, wait a minute here."
"601680","602840"," What the hell was that?"
"603200","606200"," Was that cat in this place messing around here or something?"
"606980","608140"," I don't know what's going on here. "
"609200","610060"," Try that now."
"610120","610640"," Okay, it's better."
"611100","611260"," So. "
"611260","618860"," Got this like traditional wedge thingy going on down here, right?"
"619080","621900"," We got price going down one, two and three."
"622620","623920"," We blast off, right?"
"625240","627640"," And we had a call wall above us here."
"628340","632460"," Uh, we'll take a look at that this morning and see where the call wall is today. "
"632760","634760"," See how impactful it is."
"634760","640660"," And then we had a gamma flip that was creeping up last week."
"641280","643240"," It just kept creeping up and up and up and up. "
"643300","644220"," It was like down here."
"644820","648620"," And it was up here and then it was up here coming into the end of the week."
"649820","653060"," Uh, that in my view is setting up. "
"653880","658880"," Uh, setting up a trap for bulls in some ways."
"659760","662040"," Uh, though I do believe that we escape it."
"662040","664480"," But just a 30 minute basis. "
"666460","669700"," Uh, you can kind of see in this start here."
"671020","674440"," Uh, you know, in my, from my perspective into."
"676000","677980"," Uh, op X monthly op X."
"678540","682320"," I think at a minimum where we're kind of just coasting and gliding down here. "
"682320","682640"," Okay."
"683580","685900"," Uh, and this is the 17th right here."
"686340","689620"," So I guess I'm a little, little more dramatic that I want to be. "
"690240","694620"," Uh, but somewhere in the 17th and then we've got down here the 31st."
"695840","698680"," So you got op X, then you get end of month."
"699660","703440"," And then you're looking for the first week of the next month. "
"704160","707080"," Uh, new flows, new money to come into the marketplace."
"710080","712960"," So, you know, here's the 17th, right?"
"713740","714560"," Right there."
"714700","714880"," Boom. "
"715300","715960"," You hit op X."
"716260","717660"," Maybe we get that nice squeeze higher."
"718520","723880"," You get sold down again, fam, into the end of a month flow type stuff."
"725180","729300"," And just we come down here into the 31st, maybe even catch a new low down here. "
"730140","732740"," And then you're actually off and running somewhere else."
"733000","736660"," Now there's some problems with this, uh, thesis here."
"737340","739820"," And the big one would be the gamma flip. "
"740820","743060"," You know, we don't want to see, or I don't want to see."
"744680","746780"," I don't want to see this over here."
"748580","752780"," And then the actual, uh, this is, I believe this is the, uh, I believe this is a."
"755950","758150"," Be wave for now that wave count, but. "
"759270","760850"," Just be aware of it down here."
"762110","764950"," Uh, you don't want to happen is this over here."
"765410","770590"," You don't want to see the daily get over here and trap bulls into the 30th. "
"770790","772350"," This is about the 30th in here."
"773250","775510"," Uh, then we just have a fucking bloodbath down in here."
"775830","777950"," But this would be bad news for bulls over here. "
"777950","779430"," All of this, so action over here."
"779610","782730"," This isn't so bad for bulls, believe it or not, not so bad."
"782990","788370"," So that's, uh, four 58 for 60 somewhere in there. "
"788810","791510"," I don't care about that so much, believe it or not."
"791670","793250"," I don't find this to be too bad."
"793290","794390"," This whole thing right here. "
"794990","796670"," This is where it gets bad and ugly."
"796890","799350"," This is where things can get really violent to the downside."
"800450","802250"," Uh, I'm not so bad about this. "
"802950","804950"," I'm more bad about this right here, right?"
"804950","808870"," That just reject plain rejection broke trend in the daily trigger."
"809270","812790"," Gamma flip upside down negative and blood to the downside."
"813130","815050"," So we're paying a close attention to this. "
"815790","819450"," I'd really like to see like the grind here."
"820070","821430"," Not so bad with that."
"821850","823850"," Uh, not so bad with that right there too. "
"823950","825450"," I wouldn't mind seeing that either."
"825650","828490"," And then and then get higher and be kind of close to this gamma flip."
"829110","833550"," Uh, but I don't want to see the abject like roll, the big roll, which I'm assuming a bunch of"
"833550","834710"," bears are looking for. "
"834950","837670"," Is a much larger role to the downside."
"838490","841250"," Uh, for myself, not so bad."
"841470","845270"," You can actually see us looking for some liquidity upside right now, selling to the downside. "
"846130","849410"," You guys may or may not know this, but I'm on a trade."
"849630","853250"," It's posted and it's posted and I believe this morning."
"853410","856030"," I haven't checked, but I thought I pinned it to my profile. "
"856510","857970"," And that's the trade that I'm on."
"858230","861670"," I'm not on the trade of burn the entire market."
"862330","863750"," Any of that kind of stuff. "
"863950","868990"," I'm just looking for this roll down and this consolidation kind of a trade."
"869310","877390"," Now that post that I made was in a discussion with ball signals, a guy that I trust, a very"
"877390","883830"," smart trainer, professional, I believe, what I've been told he's a real pro in real life."
"884270","886330"," And this guy has a lot of insight. "
"887230","892610"," Now that was in a discussion with ball signals and my only thing, my only thing that I wanted to"
"892610","899150"," say to him was that there's a setup in here where we're below where we end up being below the"
"899150","903330"," gamma flip into the 17th and the 31st."
"903530","909290"," And that's what always, that's what always gets my ass because when we're down there, I can't buy"
"909290","909710"," the dip."
"910590","916030"," Uh, I can't like whatever that V shape is, even if it's going to recover, there's a trap there for"
"916030","916250"," bulls. "
"916690","920170"," So it's too risky to put any kind of money on that trade."
"921690","923430"," Oh, yeah, baby, give me that blood."
"924850","926750"," So we're going to take a look at a bunch of stuff. "
"926870","931930"," You see, there you go on your 30 minute basis for you to have at home right there."
"932510","933590"," You want to snap that?"
"933810","934070"," You can."
"934850","937670"," This gives you just kind of a basic idea of where we're headed. "
"938390","942510"," You know, there's going to be people out there telling you how fuck you cap this and we ain't going"
"942510","943150"," down here."
"943790","944410"," That ain't possible."
"945110","947690"," Maybe we'll do some of this cap, but it's not going to be so bad. "
"947690","949290"," That kind of stuff."
"950190","953850"," For me, at least for right now, I am on this role trade."
"954470","956070"," How far it goes, I don't know. "
"956710","958550"," My put spreads are only the 470."
"959450","962470"," So if we tag 470, I don't make any fucking money."
"962830","968750"," Well, I guess I could cut one side and continue on our way down to the downside, but this trade"
"968750","974130"," makes me like 150% or something, almost 200% in profit. "
"974150","977550"," So I'm not really interested in holding it open any longer."
"977550","981770"," Then I have to, especially if we end up coming back up over here."
"982850","984330"," I'd rather just reposition. "
"984730","988550"," So for myself, at least, when I'm closing at 470."
"990230","992230"," So we'll take a look at this right now with you."
"993750","995670"," I'm looking like, actually, you know what?"
"995670","1001590"," I might take the money down here at like S3, 471, 70. "
"1002450","1006650"," So if this happens sooner than later, if we get something like this action, like today, tomorrow,"
"1007070","1009590"," fuck yeah, I'll take the money and run on that trade."
"1010470","1012850"," And I've had some pretty heavy losses on Friday."
"1013570","1017170"," So I need this trade to print so that I'm green, right?"
"1017550","1020250"," So I placed it as a pear trade. "
"1021270","1027470"," So I was like, oh, I was like, on the matter of fact, I sold this shit, literally up here"
"1027470","1028250"," in the pin strike."
"1029109","1030589"," I put a put spread on."
"1033190","1036190"," And then any dips to be bought, I bought with zero dates. "
"1036430","1038190"," So I bought zero dates on Friday."
"1039089","1041710"," I should have, okay, you can actually see."
"1043010","1044550"," We'll go to a one minute chart here. "
"1044730","1045650"," Let's go back in time and look."
"1051360","1055460"," So right over here, I threw some put spreads on like right fucking there."
"1055600","1057160"," I mean, right on the goddamn roll. "
"1058320","1059800"," This is the call wall up here."
"1059920","1061220"," So I put some put spreads on, right?"
"1061220","1063060"," We came down here, did a couple of stupid bounces."
"1063420","1067040"," I'm like, fuck yeah, I'm going to do some zero date calls over here. "
"1067180","1068860"," PT one, what do I always say?"
"1069260","1070220"," Take the money and run."
"1070380","1072140"," Then we trade PT two, take the money and run."
"1072520","1074080"," PT three, take the money and run. "
"1074540","1075160"," I didn't do that."
"1075160","1076220"," I left these fuckers on."
"1076380","1076860"," I was like, you know what?"
"1076980","1077520"," Fuck these guys. "
"1077720","1080040"," I'm going to try to run it all the way up into the bell."
"1080320","1084400"," Ended up being a loser, but then on this side, I'm making some serious money."
"1084620","1086360"," This is a pretty big trade for me. "
"1087200","1090220"," So it actually, you can see right now, it's pretty nice and hard and heavy."
"1091080","1092580"," So I'm pretty excited right now."
"1093660","1099320"," So we're going to go back to the main screen right now and watch all this action as it unloads. "
"1099760","1103520"," And we're going to go over what the gamma is this morning."
"1104080","1105220"," And we're going to get into the gamma."
"1105620","1107580"," And we're going to get into the economic calendar for the week. "
"1108240","1110660"," And we're going to go over a bunch of shit from the weekend that came out."
"1110800","1112360"," There was a ton of news where you got the Houthis."
"1112820","1115120"," Who would these remind me of like the sand?"
"1115500","1116320"," What are they called?"
"1116540","1117840"," What's inside of Star Wars?"
"1120040","1125920"," The little short sand people with the big truck or whatever. "
"1126420","1127560"," That's what they remind me of."
"1127740","1129080"," They're just over there fucking with the US."
"1129760","1132860"," I kind of shouldn't find a computer or anything, but I do. "
"1133100","1135340"," I'm like, what are you doing over there?"
"1135920","1137800"," Why are you messing with the United States?"
"1140000","1143000"," It's not really like a hundred guys, but it's in my mind."
"1143000","1147580"," It's like the Houthis are like a hundred guys just hanging out on the corner."
"1147740","1149500"," They're like, watch these motherfuckers coming down the road. "
"1149500","1151020"," I'm going to fucking shoot a rocket at them."
"1151780","1153740"," It's like the guy you don't want to do that to."
"1155980","1157740"," So the Houthis are acting up, right?"
"1157920","1161500"," They're like, we're going to start shooting missiles and all this other stuff. "
"1161900","1163660"," And then, of course, the US does what they do."
"1163700","1166180"," They flew around and blew up a bunch of shit."
"1166180","1167360"," It's like bomb in Canada. "
"1167360","1168200"," Like, what are you doing?"
"1170440","1171880"," The Jawas, exactly."
"1172340","1173360"," I feel like they're the Jawas."
"1175960","1178640"," Those blast points are definitely not Jawas. "
"1178800","1180100"," That's the Empire."
"1183940","1185320"," They're like the Jawas, man."
"1186280","1187520"," They're the Jawas. "
"1188340","1189280"," What are you doing?"
"1196000","1199420"," We'll talk about that as well, implications, that kind of stuff."
"1199640","1204920"," I saw some other stuff in my ran with the Navy SEALs."
"1204960","1206220"," That's how we lost a couple Navy SEALs. "
"1206300","1209700"," They were stopping a shipment of missiles to the Houthis."
"1210020","1216020"," There's some dragging in of the US into expanding the conflict in the Middle East."
"1216020","1218360"," The US, dude, is like, we don't want to be here. "
"1218560","1220800"," The US is like, we just got out of this area."
"1220800","1222260"," Why do you want us back?"
"1223260","1225220"," No, it's like, come on, man."
"1225420","1226180"," It's a party, dude. "
"1226280","1229500"," It's like, why do you want a party with the US?"
"1229940","1232760"," I thought you didn't want a party with the United States."
"1237540","1240800"," Okay, so let's talk."
"1241000","1242580"," Let's take a look at some gamma levels here. "
"1244560","1246040"," It's going to be one quick second here."
"1248820","1254260"," I'm going to check some net gamma in the market really quick."
"1273340","1278440"," So, according to Chevron, CEO Chevron makes ship-by-ship decisions on red sea voyages. "
"1278640","1280120"," Again, according to their CEO at the moment."
"1280240","1281400"," One quick second here."
"1288480","1290520"," Well, when that is hurting. "
"1291380","1295360"," So Chevron sees dynamic and volatile risks in the red sea."
"1295660","1296580"," According to their CEO."
"1303040","1305160"," I'm not getting yet, so I got to wait. "
"1306340","1308640"," Okay, so we'll come back to that one right there."
"1309000","1313420"," Chevron does note, however, that they have not made fundamental changes to shipping routes."
"1314620","1316900"," Here's your gamma flip right down here. "
"1317040","1317760"," If you can see this."
"1321590","1324090"," We'll see if we get underneath it here in just a moment."
"1329390","1330670"," Here's your S1. "
"1333390","1334770"," Here's your S2."

"1471390","1476210"," I know it rained in some of the east coast ended up raining when it wasn't supposed to. "
"1476590","1478890"," Some of you guys missed the snow."
"1479610","1480670"," We got hammered."
"1480950","1481650"," It was awesome. "
"1482270","1484070"," It was it was really, really good."

"1548740","1550080"," That's all I can read here. "
"1550080","1550760"," Everything big."
"1563980","1565120"," See what we got here."
"1566800","1568540"," Yeah, this was another big one. "
"1570860","1574200"," Bostik had said that he warns."
"1574580","1575580"," He's a voter by the way."
"1576140","1579200"," He warns that progress on inflation is likely to slow. "
"1579880","1580940"," I think that's good."
"1581280","1582160"," I'm actually on the camp."
"1582520","1586080"," That's a good that's coming up being portrayed as negative to the market. "
"1586780","1590140"," But it's actually good for bulls, believe it or not."
"1591160","1592860"," Some reading about that right now."
"1592940","1596260"," I read about that over the weekend, but I've got no problems with it personally. "
"1597740","1602880"," The slowing of inflation hitting 2% year over year is bullish."
"1603300","1604340"," I know you don't want to hear that."
"1605060","1608320"," You're going to be like, you're like, want to hit me with a hammer in the head. "
"1608320","1610840"," But we talked about this last week."
"1611640","1618900"," The velocity and inflation hitting its goal of 2% year over year."
"1619980","1621520"," And then it's bounce. "
"1622180","1624180"," So it looks something like this here."
"1625840","1630640"," As inflation comes down, you don't want to see this here."
"1631400","1632840"," Like slam and slam. "
"1633280","1636800"," This is that velocity part of inflation."
"1637720","1644460"," When you see that slamming in of inflation, you should be seeing jobs."
"1645300","1647620"," We're getting horrible jobs reports. "
"1647640","1651720"," And then, of course, a ramp in unemployment at the same time."
"1652240","1654660"," And then an anticipation of rate cuts."
"1655560","1661680"," Now, this is where also the most fraud takes places in this moment in here. "
"1662680","1665740"," And they're trying to slow down."
"1665960","1673340"," The Fed wants to fudge, believe it or not, fudge the numbers, inflation numbers in this period to"
"1673340","1674900"," buy themselves some time."
"1675040","1678160"," They don't want to see that blast down that bounce. "
"1678820","1681120"," Historically, at least they don't want to see that."
"1682760","1690780"," What it ends up doing is turning into the anticipation of rate cuts."
"1690780","1696100"," And so I think that they finagle this as long as they possibly can. "
"1697680","1699700"," We know that the numbers are fake, right?"
"1699800","1702060"," It's the same as the unemployment numbers last quarter."
"1702460","1704300"," They just put out a bunch of bullshit."
"1704540","1711060"," And then, of course, they revised by hundreds of thousands in the revisions of that of that. "
"1713220","1713980"," What am I saying?"
"1714340","1717160"," I want to read an email this morning."
"1720960","1725800"," So you're just going to see mass manipulation until they are ready to cut rates."
"1726960","1731760"," If they even do cut rates this year, I don't think that they're going to. "
"1732480","1737520"," As of right now, it looks to me like unless we get something different from the Fed."
"1738380","1740480"," Jerome wants to keep rates elevated."
"1742060","1744900"," Into at least the end Q4. "
"1744900","1746820"," End of Q4 of 2024."
"1747880","1753580"," And possibly even beyond, depending upon what the election outcome is."
"1754560","1760920"," And the thing that fascinates me the most about that too is if the market is blasting, how do we"
"1760920","1769220"," not raise rates in the face of what will look like Bob on Main Street saying, Hey, the stock"
"1769220","1771180"," market's overpriced, right, overvalued. "
"1771760","1773420"," How do you start cutting rates?"
"1773420","1777520"," And that's how we come up with to be honest with you."
"1777640","1780720"," That's how we come up with the statement."
"1780740","1786920"," If we're cutting rates and the stock market looks fine, something is broken that we don't see,"
"1787200","1787300"," right?"
"1788300","1793740"," Matter of fact, Jim Kramer this morning was talking about tax cuts. "
"1794280","1801960"," Well, not tax cuts, but oh, yeah, tax cuts for the wealthy right now that are going to sunset here."
"1801960","1802800"," So shortly."
"1803940","1809680"," And his point was that you see the unfortunate 500 companies that have been hurt by tightening. "
"1810080","1811100"," Fuck no, we haven't."
"1811260","1812580"," No, we haven't seen any."
"1812720","1817420"," We haven't seen any, but that we know of at this point, like any kind of pain, right?"
"1817760","1821660"," Tightening cycles are so short and long term debt cycles. "
"1821660","1825440"," If you don't understand, let me see if I know some of you do, but a lot of you don't."
"1826440","1831280"," If you don't understand the how capitalism in our country works."
"1840560","1841980"," Which is common. "
"1843020","1845800"," Our society does not teach kids."
"1846820","1852140"," The basic concepts of how our, how our capitalist system works."
"1853500","1860540"," And you need to as a participant in the stock market, learn the basics of it. "
"1860540","1862080"," You have to."
"1862220","1872140"," It's important for you to understand how macro economics work and how they impact the"
"1872140","1873080"," stock market."
"1874160","1876120"," Even if it's only a base level. "
"1876300","1879980"," So what I'm going to do here is get now this guy."
"1880120","1882400"," This video is from Ray Dalio."
"1882540","1886440"," A lot of you have seen this, but there's always getting new people in the stream. "
"1887780","1894520"," Now Ray Dalio is infamously fucking wrong in timing, and I mean a big way."
"1896040","1898120"," Big ways like big time."
"1898480","1900940"," Like if you got business market for 10, 20 years. "
"1901760","1906720"," This fucking guy has been calling for the, the end of a long term debt cycle now for 20 years."
"1906860","1907340"," I'm not joking."
"1908200","1909980"," And it has not come to pass. "
"1909980","1918640"," But he has a gift on explaining complex concepts simply."
"1919260","1923240"," So I'm going to post the link to this video here."
"1924740","1928700"," And I don't know why that's such a garbage link from YouTube, but at any rate. "
"1930040","1935200"," In your free time, as a matter of fact, even this morning, just get off my show and go watch"
"1935200","1935820"," this thing."
"1939160","1944900"," It is a great, now I don't know if it starts midway through at the beginning or whatever."
"1945920","1947640"," Start the start at the beginning. "
"1948080","1951180"," And it explains to you short long term debt cycles."
"1952100","1958460"," Our version of capitalism, how it runs and how right now where we are in this."
"1958980","1960360"," Where we are right now. "
"1960360","1963900"," I don't care if what the end of a short or a long term debt cycle."
"1964580","1970540"," But whatever cycle, for me personally, I think we're in the, we're in the tail end of a short term"
"1970540","1971120"," debt cycle."
"1971620","1976360"," And a second debt cycle economic cycle that includes COVID. "
"1976900","1978180"," They're trying to bring them together."
"1978920","1984500"," And then we are also at the end of a long term debt cycle that comes to fruition in the"
"1984500","1987960"," next two years, roughly around 2026."
"1989400","1992000"," And doesn't finish until 2028. "
"1992320","1995980"," Now somewhere in there, there's going to be a major bloodbath in my view, at least."
"1998240","2001120"," Now, if you can grasp these concepts."
"2002240","2005120"," You can look around right now and see where we are. "
"2005760","2008660"," He talks about civil war."
"2008740","2010720"," He talks about civil unrest."
"2011620","2013340"," He talks about taxation. "
"2013920","2014460"," I think he does."
"2014660","2020360"," I think in this video, he talks also about different forms of taxation, inflation."
"2021040","2025500"," He talks to you about how like your county government, your state government, the federal"
"2025500","2027100"," government will come in and tax. "
"2027760","2031060"," Then they tax corporations and stuff like that at the end of these cycles."
"2031400","2034480"," So you can kind of match this stuff up for where we are."
"2035880","2037480"," But you need to have a grasp on that stuff. "
"2037620","2039860"," It's important for you to at least have that grasp."
"2039860","2044520"," And of course, Jim Kramer this morning was talking about, you know, how many of these Fortune 500"
"2044520","2047040"," companies have been really hurt by this tightening cycle."
"2047620","2057380"," And it's a very valid point saying that because you're part of our capitalism is at the most basic"
"2057380","2059980"," level is here's some money for you. "
"2060639","2061199"," Right?"
"2061580","2067300"," Whether you're some guy on Main Street, some guy or some woman or whatever with that's young."
"2067300","2067639"," Right?"
"2067760","2068500"," Here's some free money."
"2069199","2071219"," Go invest it however you want. "
"2071920","2074020"," And we're going to check back on you."
"2074980","2078420"," And if you've been fucking around, we're going to wash you out."
"2078820","2088260"," That's the basic pieces here on how our system works is that we give them or the system gives free"
"2088260","2088540"," money. "
"2089080","2093920"," Basically, you get a chance to have a piece of it, whether you're a company, an individual."
"2093920","2098400"," And then you're given a period of time for you to go spend that money."
"2098820","2100240"," And you spend it appropriately. "
"2101460","2102380"," You're going to be fine."
"2102640","2106320"," If you did not or you failed or you did something fraudulent."
"2107620","2111260"," Or you just made something great that didn't take doesn't matter what it is. "
"2112260","2115020"," You and there's some real cruelty in this too."
"2115180","2115300"," Right?"
"2115920","2119000"," You get into a car accident and you can't walk ever again."
"2119740","2120980"," And you took some money. "
"2120980","2122360"," They're going to wash you out too."
"2122820","2123680"," You got old."
"2124680","2126380"," They're going to wash you out as well. "
"2126980","2129500"," And we're not seeing that so far, are we?"
"2130120","2133980"," We're not seeing in this, well, Jerome said that he was trying to get the cycles together."
"2134660","2138140"," But in this part of the cycle, we haven't seen a big wash of anybody, have we?"
"2138760","2143800"," Or at least not on the surface, have we seen that happen at this point?"
"2144080","2147460"," So make sure you watch that video at some point this morning."
"2148420","2150700"," Oh no, short term short term debt cycles. "
"2153060","2155780"," Have a nice little bounce down below on S2."
"2161900","2164780"," I think I posted that I post that everywhere for you guys."
"2165000","2165960"," I think I posted that. "
"2166120","2168700"," I posted that on Twitch."
"2169000","2169240"," I did."
"2169820","2170080"," Okay. "
"2170320","2172760"," See you guys have that on short long term debt cycles."
"2173080","2176940"," You don't understand the basics of short long term debt cycles."
"2177340","2179380"," Get off my fucking stream and go watch that. "
"2179380","2182440"," Okay, you have to have a baseline understanding of it."
"2182840","2188240"," And he does a very good job of explaining it to people as dumb down as you possibly can."
"2188380","2191020"," That video is for like a fourth grader. "
"2191200","2194520"," There's no reason why you shouldn't understand those concepts."
"2194780","2199440"," There's no reason why that shouldn't be taught to you in grade school in junior high and high"
"2199440","2199800"," school."
"2200320","2206280"," And it's a travesty in our country that we do not fucking teach kids children. "
"2206280","2212500"," This is a true travesty in our country that basic economics are not taught to you in your school."
"2213260","2220340"," It's offensive that you go out into your life and you do not have a base understanding of how"
"2220340","2226040"," economics work in our country outside of like, yeah, this is what I don't know."
"2226120","2231760"," This is what an apple costs versus your paycheck at McDonald's. "
"2232120","2233880"," You should have an understanding of how our system works."
"2233880","2237140"," Now, it doesn't matter if you agree or disagree with that."
"2237860","2238180"," Right?"
"2238520","2246960"," This matters and how it impacts the stock market, the bond market, the greater economy and how it"
"2246960","2248840"," impacts our stock market, basically. "
"2251390","2253830"," Oh, yeah, Evan, that's the one I posted, man."
"2254710","2259330"," That Ray Dalio video should be taught in every school in America."
"2259330","2260090"," It's not. "
"2260790","2263410"," It's so simple, such a simple concept."
"2264170","2265170"," He simplifies it."
"2265290","2266690"," So he does a great job at that stuff. "
"2268950","2269390"," Yeah."
"2269610","2269710"," Yeah."
"2269830","2270930"," He does a really good job. "
"2271290","2275890"," That's one of the things that I've been grateful to see him do the past decade or so."
"2275970","2276830"," I think he's been doing this."
"2278050","2279970"," Maybe he lost 10 to 15 years. "
"2280850","2284630"," He makes these videos and they're excellent."
"2291600","2292040"," Okay."
"2292040","2292840"," Okay. "
"2294500","2296240"," So watch that video, please."
"2296460","2297580"," I want you to watch that video."
"2298140","2299220"," Now, very important. "
"2299940","2302300"," It's how our system operates."
"2305100","2305580"," Yeah."
"2306340","2308000"," Creature from Jack Lyons, another good book, too. "
"2309440","2310140"," All right."
"2310260","2310380"," All right."
"2310480","2311500"," So we got all that done. "
"2312700","2314260"," That's all done right now."
"2314500","2316080"," I'm going to read to you a couple of other things."
"2322750","2324210"," Let me see what I got here. "
"2324210","2330150"," I got a note that was sent to me this morning implied SPX dealer gammas running at 550 million"
"2330150","2332990"," currently, but we'll get slashed down in the coming days."
"2334020","2336170"," All else equal as options expire."
"2336610","2338610"," Today we've got negative 50 million. "
"2339270","2340990"," Tuesday negative 42 million."
"2341370","2347810"," Wednesday negative 20 million Friday meant negative 180 million for a total of 290 million."
"2349530","2355690"," In basic terms, that means that dealer gamma, the greatest stabilizer, could get in half, which"
"2355690","2360630"," increases the risk of large moves towards the end of the week. "
"2362310","2370510"," So we've got a bunch of gamma rolling off the market as the week progresses from a gamma strike"
"2370510","2377250"," standpoint, 1400 is a big resistance level that will only swell larger as we approach OPEX."
"2377750","2379630"," Listen to me closely right here."
"2380010","2387290"," Well, to the downside, there are no prominent support levels except a rather small gamma strike at"
"2387290","2388750"," 47 75. "
"2389890","2390970"," That's right here."
"2391190","2393030"," See my cursor down here, right?"
"2394030","2397530"," I talked to you about this, I believe on Friday."
"2398590","2400330"," And I harped on it. "
"2400490","2401550"," I made a post about it."
"2401610","2404330"," I talked to vol signals about it."
"2404370","2408990"," And I'm like, yeah, there's a rug pull and it's setting up. "
"2410450","2414930"," There's not much here except for where my circle is right here holding this market up."
"2415190","2423270"," And as the week progresses, we get more weaker and weaker and weaker as the week progresses."
"2423270","2429950"," It doesn't necessarily correlate to a stock market crash or anything, but the setup is there. "
"2430450","2433870"," And you need to be aware of it out there."
"2434070","2438650"," Below 47 50, deal a gamma will turn negative, right?"
"2439010","2443590"," So 47 50 is your gamma flip, right?"
"2444010","2445170"," You can see it right here."
"2445810","2446390"," It's right here. "
"2447050","2451630"," Your gamma flip is right down there is your gamma flip."
"2454850","2457210"," Which means there's not much room for error."
"2457570","2462970"," We would feel a lot more confident if we could achieve a solid pin at 4800 with an upside bias. "
"2463670","2468950"," So IE, we do not want to break below this gamma flip if you're a bull."
"2469650","2473710"," And you'd rather see a pin into Friday at 4800."
"2474610","2476830"," We don't want to be floating down there, right?"
"2476830","2479490"," Let me see if I can bring this up for you really quick here. "
"2482230","2483470"," What else we got here?"
"2483830","2487710"," We model that CTIs are almost 100% long in SPX currently."
"2488410","2491170"," So not much firepower to expect from trend followers."
"2492590","2495670"," Below 47 50 CTAs will offload futures. "
"2497150","2503810"," Which could then escalate in the region of 46 50 and 47 20 in a downside scenario."
"2504390","2506670"," That's pretty much what I'm looking for here, right?"
"2506790","2512230"," I'm looking for that 47 0, 47 0 on SPY at some point."
"2512330","2514230"," It's giving initial support to the create. "
"2514370","2517930"," Looking at credit data, non-dealer future positioning looks rich."
"2518230","2521870"," But long ratio is still running below 2021 levels."
"2523350","2525510"," But that's all I've got for you here. "
"2526770","2530550"," So you don't want to see a breakdown below this gamma flip right here."
"2530550","2532910"," If you're a bull, you should be buying every dip."
"2533530","2537770"," But then turning into a seller if we get below this gamma flip to the downside. "
"2537770","2543890"," What else do I got here for you?"
"2545690","2548830"," Let me read some of this black box stuff out of the way."
"2554350","2558090"," New York Fed Empire State Survey business activity dropped sharply in New York."
"2558090","2562490"," Stand according to firms who are responding to the 2024 Empire State manufacturing survey. "
"2562650","2568370"," The headline general business conditions XFL 21.9%. New orders and shipments also post sharp"
"2568370","2570810"," declines and filled orders continue to shrink significantly."
"2571710","2575770"," And delivery times continue to shorten inventories that slow lower employment."
"2576110","2578350"," The average work week declined modestly. "
"2578970","2585570"," Pace of input price increases picked up somewhat while the pace of selling price increases was a"
"2585570","2586230"," little changed."
"2587710","2593330"," While firms expected conditions to improve over the next six months, optimism remained subdued."
"2594830","2599050"," Yeah, Boeing was down 2.3% in the early session. "
"2600250","2601930"," We'll look at Boeing as well."
"2602190","2603630"," Look at Tesla and Boeing."
"2604090","2608190"," We're going to talk about Tesla and Boeing here in just a moment. "
"2608370","2609270"," You know, we might have to bring on."
"2609370","2611210"," I think I saw Joe Donut in here talking."
"2611210","2616130"," And he has mentioned something to me in the past about this. "
"2618530","2620230"," That about Elon, we're going to talk."
"2620390","2621370"," Should we talk about Elon next?"
"2621930","2623650"," I don't know if we should or shouldn't here, but."
"2624610","2625390"," Give me a second. "
"2625430","2627310"," I'm going to line something up here for you guys."
"2628090","2630730"," You know, there's an Elon conversation here."
"2636150","2638090"," That I want to have with you. "
"2640790","2643390"," I saw him last week."
"2644830","2649670"," There were some conversations I was in last week where Elon popped in."
"2650250","2652750"," Not too long after in the same threads. "
"2654070","2655790"," That I was in last week."
"2656150","2657390"," This was after my rant."
"2658250","2663090"," This was a high debt in risk for global economy. "
"2663950","2665490"," You know, there's like a."
"2667970","2669410"," There's a part of."
"2670470","2671530"," Like, is he watching?"
"2672950","2674030"," Does he have people?"
"2674370","2676490"," I mean, you know, I was in that rant last week."
"2676590","2683670"," I was like, you know, my view on Tesla here, the price Tesla is after we find the low. "
"2685110","2688550"," It's going to run pretty hard and heavy to the upside."
"2690830","2692670"," Some pretty significant highs."
"2693630","2693850"," So. "
"2694910","2697490"," Seeing him floating around in these groups."
"2698290","2700130"," I'm like, is he trying to gauge."
"2702310","2706270"," Is he trying to gauge where price is going in Tesla. "
"2707090","2709010"," So he can drop some bad news."
"2709810","2713770"," And also it was kind of fascinating because this news of him wanting more shares."
"2715210","2719450"," Reminds me of him probably knowing that he can get a sweet deal. "
"2719570","2723750"," He needs some time in front to get a good price on getting shares."
"2724670","2727670"," And he probably knows that down the road, they're going to go to the moon."
"2729390","2738530"," I'm not shocked at him wanting more shares and it has to do with. "
"2739730","2742350"," Has to do with in my view, right?"
"2742530","2744270"," The board is stacked with his people."
"2746810","2751830"," The money that he the money that he had used for Tesla or for Twitter."
"2752510","2758150"," Is the price of Tesla stock goes down could force him. "
"2758550","2760530"," I'm not going to I don't want to say some of this stuff."
"2761490","2768270"," There's probably like a mechanism working in the background where he needs more shares to maintain"
"2768270","2772030"," control of the company."
"2772510","2775690"," And the rest of the board members not to get fired as well. "
"2776270","2778870"," Maybe I can have Joe on later today to discuss some of this."
"2779610","2781650"," But there's likely so my point here is this."
"2781650","2789450"," There's likely likely has someone back there telling him, Hey, man, you're at risk here of losing"
"2789450","2792610"," Tesla and you need more shares. "
"2794190","2800150"," And that function plus the function of getting more shares with the new compensation package at a"
"2800150","2806050"," very cheap price that could help him on the back end with the Twitter deal, X deal, whatever you"
"2806050","2806650"," want to call it."
"2806650","2810150"," There's more than likely I want you to think about this."
"2810350","2816730"," When you see people, when you see someone come public, right, and they say something public to you,"
"2816810","2820670"," think about what the motivation is for that conversation. "
"2821670","2824570"," And it's usually something simpler than you think."
"2825390","2829450"," And more than likely has more to do with control of your company."
"2831170","2834970"," Usually for that kind of a conversation is a big conversation, right?"
"2835310","2841070"," On its topic, on its topical, you're talking about a company that's being valued based upon being"
"2841070","2842590"," more than a car company, right?"
"2843890","2847910"," And then the discussion about, well, maybe I won't do any of this work. "
"2848830","2853170"," If I'm not, if I don't own more of the company, but go back and try to find out what"
"2853170","2854990"," the real reasons are on the back end."
"2854990","2864070"," And it probably has something more to do with the deal with X and his board members on the Tesla"
"2864070","2866270"," board and then himself as well."
"2866950","2875690"," Control of the company and then a possibility or even just panic of what happens if the share price"
"2875690","2876350"," goes down. "
"2876590","2877570"," Let's say it closes the gap."
"2877570","2882150"," I think it's a gap down at 90 bucks or something, then there's a gap down at 60 bucks."
"2882650","2889610"," Does that put him in any kind of any kind of risk in his control of Tesla down there?"
"2890310","2892250"," That's the question that I have. "
"2892650","2895510"," Is that the reason for the discussion?"
"2896190","2902770"," I want to know from you guys too, what you think if he should be compensated more or not, if"
"2902770","2904030"," they should be compensating him."
"2904030","2909290"," I've heard some discussion out there that he should get the shares, but they should be."
"2909510","2910170"," I think they're called. "
"2910530","2912290"," I don't know what they're called right now, but they're like."
"2914270","2916450"," RPU or I went to business school."
"2916510","2921230"," It's been a lot of fucking years, but there's shares you can get that are based upon milestones"
"2921230","2922310"," down the road. "
"2924050","2929350"," He could be given shares like that, where if you if you meet these milestones or if you."
"2930470","2933530"," If you can't shut your fucking mouth in public."
"2934290","2938310"," They'll remove those shares and they've asked they've asked in a certain period of time or"
"2938310","2938930"," something like that. "
"2939530","2942750"," RS use legend X two two X knows they are."
"2942910","2943790"," They're called RS use."
"2944830","2945930"," So he knows what they are. "
"2946190","2951490"," So RS use are basically shares that I believe that they could give to him, but they don't vest"
"2951490","2953630"," until certain things happen."
"2956420","2958340"," That's right restricted stock units."
"2958500","2958880"," Good job. "
"2961000","2966820"," I don't know if I'm for against it or whatever risk it puts them at whatever risk he's looking at."
"2966840","2968020"," He doesn't want you to know publicly."
"2968840","2970260"," He needs those shares. "
"2970960","2972160"," I'm kind of okay with it."
"2973180","2977240"," But I want to put restrictions on them if if they were going to give them to him."
"2977520","2982940"," I want to I would want restrictions for his public persona. "
"2983160","2984260"," I'm not a fan of it."
"2984360","2984880"," I'm sorry."
"2984880","2987320"," I'm not that I've never got to be. "
"2987820","2989620"," Sitting at 69 out of 100."
"2990000","2993880"," That equals agreed crypto fear and greed index 64 out of 100."
"2993960","2995000"," Inquilling greed as well. "
"2995620","2998440"," So seeing the big has paid some of its gains from earlier."
"2998480","3000620"," It's currently trading around 13 spots seven."
"3001500","3004420"," I'm not a fan of this public persona, especially more recently. "
"3004800","3005540"," I'm not a fan of it."
"3005700","3007420"," I don't want I don't care what he says."
"3007440","3008340"," I don't want to say anything. "
"3008900","3013860"," I like my CEOs to say controversial things."
"3014880","3016340"," Not based in politics."
"3017840","3019300"," Stay out of the fucking politics. "
"3019920","3020900"," Just like all of it."
"3021040","3022720"," I don't care if he was a Democrat or Republican."
"3023540","3024540"," I don't care what he is. "
"3025600","3026880"," Stay the fuck out of it."
"3028540","3033420"," Say things that are that piss people off in terms of like EV cars."
"3034300","3035360"," Hold on one second here. "
"3046200","3050480"," So I've got a I've got kids knocking on the door."
"3052340","3055360"," But just like say things that piss people off indirectly."
"3055560","3057460"," I guess would be the thing with Elon. "
"3058440","3064160"," I don't like him getting involved or pissing off everybody across the universe."
"3065060","3067760"," He's like piss off public is nice pissing off Democrats."
"3068040","3073500"," I think and I really don't want my CEO doing that or my CEOs doing that shit publicly. "
"3073780","3075720"," So that's one thing."
"3075900","3078760"," The second thing that would be for Elon would be."
"3079620","3082760"," On those shares being vested would be some deliverables. "
"3083620","3085860"," That's the other thing that's but that's pissed me off."
"3087260","3090600"," Over these years, of course, spend a long time now, right?"
"3090900","3091960"," I want deliverables."
"3092680","3093900"," I'm a salty investor. "
"3094640","3095560"," I want deliverables."
"3095800","3096620"," I want shit delivered."
"3097360","3097940"," I want to see. "
"3098480","3100700"," I want to see Tesla."
"3101740","3109180"," People out there working with the bureaucracy in our interstate travel system, our county level"
"3109180","3111460"," travel system, all that kind of stuff."
"3111700","3112860"," So I'm expecting that as well. "
"3113440","3120520"," So I'm fine with it as long as there's some vestments only based upon deliverables."
"3120780","3123420"," Let me know in the in the chat what you guys think about that."
"3123900","3125000"," What the real reasons are. "
"3125140","3127340"," Nice squeeze right now in spoos."
"3128100","3128860"," Squeezing above."
"3130060","3131900"," The hourly trigger right now. "
"3131900","3135180"," Remember above we have the call wall."
"3135920","3139260"," Bowls want to be breaking above or pinning it into the end of the week."
"3139640","3140660"," We talked about that. "
"3140800","3145060"," We don't want to see a break below the gamma flip down here at any point this week."
"3146080","3147920"," Getting a nice squeeze right now."
"3148320","3149620"," Nice beautiful squeeze. "
"3153480","3156120"," My array to conquer the days waves."
"3157100","3157420"," Yeah."
"3158480","3159080"," Hold on. "
"3159180","3160520"," So I did whatever the Tesla stuff."
"3160780","3165140"," Let me know in the chat what you think about Tesla or have a discussion if you like about Tesla"
"3165140","3166680"," in the chat."
"3167620","3171600"," We'll look at the Tesla chat chart right now that's seen as we went over. "
"3171760","3173100"," Let's take a peek at the Tesla chart."
"3179130","3182030"," Let's take a look at Tesla here."
"3189810","3198130"," Tesla officially negative at this point when prices below the blue line right here. "
"3198130","3199850"," This is your monthly trigger."
"3200170","3205530"," So this line right here and prices below the monthly trigger."
"3205810","3206590"," We are negative. "
"3207670","3210230"," We are actually in a bear market for that stock."
"3210690","3216790"," Now there's a second part to that which would be confirmation would be needed."
"3217510","3224110"," So you want to see a confirmation rejection down below here for that to take place to be confirmed. "
"3224550","3227010"," It's not good enough for price just to be down here."
"3227010","3230530"," So you still want to see the rejection to the downside."
"3231170","3233310"," You can actually see this break below here. "
"3234190","3234530"," Right."
"3234910","3236850"," Seemed to confirm it."
"3236990","3238590"," But no right back up again. "
"3238770","3239250"," We're positive."
"3239610","3239730"," Okay."
"3240450","3244070"," So we want to be able to if you're a bear or anything like that you want to see some"
"3244070","3248170"," kind of rejection and continue to downside move for Tesla. "
"3249250","3255070"," We also have the cross taking place above here of the daily trigger and the weekly trigger."
"3255070","3258370"," So I'm very, very concerned about this right here."
"3258710","3261710"," I don't want to see that rejection up here on that cross. "
"3262170","3263810"," This begins to cross down."
"3263950","3264770"," We begin to reject."
"3265350","3267370"," It'll be very bad for Tesla. "
"3267670","3268770"," It's going to get really ugly."
"3269890","3277450"," So we'll take be paying close attention to this daily trigger and weekly trigger right here."
"3277870","3284590"," If you are a bull, you want to see a price get above 240, 235. "
"3284590","3288470"," And then confirm a reversal."
"3288930","3289950"," So it's not good enough."
"3290370","3291370"," Don't be like, Hey, cap. "
"3291470","3292450"," We went all the way up here."
"3292970","3294070"," Everything is fine."
"3294390","3295430"," That's not fine. "
"3296170","3297790"," The squeeze is not fine."
"3298050","3300690"," Only the confirmation off that daily and weekly."
"3301410","3307690"," And then beating that whatever that squeeze was back here would be the end of the corrective nature"
"3307690","3309170"," of Tesla right now. "
"3309590","3311310"," So be very careful on Tesla."
"3311310","3314190"," You want to see a resumption back to the upside."
"3314670","3316350"," It would look something like this. "
"3321160","3324700"," You would want to see probably go right about there."
"3325940","3328640"," You'd want to see something like this here, right?"
"3330080","3334180"," And then a resumption back to the upside, something like this here at minimum."
"3334860","3338020"," You'd want to see to get bullish on Tesla again. "
"3340800","3345860"," Now, if you're looking at the daily velocity, you want to take a look at the daily velocity."
"3346880","3352920"," On Tesla, I always like to see Tesla get down nasty minus 50 for a dip by."
"3354060","3356540"," Minus 50 down here for a dip by. "
"3356800","3358200"," I haven't seen it quite yet."
"3359080","3367580"," For right now, we are at."
"3367580","3370840"," I still think we have more downside to come. "
"3371620","3374560"," So even on the squeeze right now, we move some of this up here."
"3380300","3382180"," Move some of that up for you right there."
"3384220","3388400"," Even with this squeeze right here, I don't believe that we're done heading down. "
"3388980","3390800"," I'll give you some targets to the upside."
"3391100","3394880"," We've got 227 67 and then 235 50."
"3395620","3398040"," So right in here, you don't want to see a rejection here. "
"3398040","3400260"," You don't want to see the rejection here."
"3400580","3403260"," We're also going to have our continuation to the downside."
"3404180","3411440"," So two key levels for Tesla bulls, 227 67, 235 50. "
"3411960","3415460"," In fact, let's put that one right there."
"3416200","3420160"," Move that one down and then we'll do one more above it right here."
"3422140","3423300"," Right there. "
"3426340","3427840"," That one right there."
"3429740","3430820"," So there's Tesla."
"3431700","3432580"," Tesla update. "
"3432840","3433340"," Watching it closely."
"3441590","3443410"," That's a one minute trigger right there."
"3456090","3457710"," And then for you right there. "
"3460230","3464030"," The main screen here."
"3464950","3466710"," You guys can see all that right there, right?"
"3469870","3472630"," I wonder if any of you guys getting flies today."
"3472690","3475310"," I was wondering if anyone's going to buy some flies today for the rest of the week. "
"3475870","3478690"," Seems like a decent, decent trade for Wednesday."
"3481590","3482190"," All right."
"3482330","3483710"," So we talked about Tesla, right?"
"3494660","3495880"," That's what I like that one. "
"3496040","3496400"," Who did that?"
"3497140","3498780"," Bork, I like that stream labs."
"3499080","3499600"," No, brother."
"3499920","3504500"," US carried out new strikes against Hutu's anti-ship missiles in Yemen today. "
"3505280","3505760"," Yeah."
"3505860","3506440"," That's what I was thinking about."
"3506480","3507580"," Same thing, John Hagerty. "
"3507720","3508680"," You got to give more shares."
"3509520","3511340"," I don't disagree with that."
"3512680","3515560"," My question is, does it get them more shares or not?"
"3516460","3519480"," I think that's a warning to his board members too. "
"3525580","3527120"," Hey, who's that Bork?"
"3527300","3527880"," What's going on, brother?"
"3528720","3529660"," How are you doing, man?"
"3532860","3533680"," John in the spot."
"3533880","3534240"," Good morning."
"3534460","3534860"," How are you?"
"3536000","3536280"," All right. "
"3536360","3538360"," Let's go through some of the chat here and see what everybody's saying here."
"3540700","3541760"," You caucus last."
"3542000","3542220"," Oh, yeah. "
"3542440","3543160"," So let's talk about the election."
"3544920","3547600"," We can tell about that briefly without taking too many sides."
"3549560","3552460"," The caucus was kind of crazy to watch last night, right?"
"3553200","3555080"," It was a name, Vivek or something. "
"3555780","3557920"," I wasn't expecting him to drop out that quickly."
"3559040","3561420"," So that was kind of weird to see that house."
"3561640","3562900"," So he dropped out of the election. "
"3563960","3567460"," There's a little bit of a whip going on inside of the Republican party."
"3568720","3570200"," What else did I see about the?"
"3570380","3576620"," What did you guys think about the caucus last night on its impact on the stock market?"
"3576840","3580200"," You guys have any takes on the Iowa caucus last night?"
"3585290","3586810"," Let me see what you guys are saying here."
"3586870","3591930"," Oh, my phone is off. "
"3592110","3592890"," My phone is dead."
"3593470","3596730"," I lost my fucking charge or Joe said text, text messages."
"3596730","3601490"," The phone is off right now. "
"3601550","3604630"," I couldn't find my phone charger, but I got it."
"3604750","3606010"," I've dug out everything we came."
"3606150","3606770"," We got back home. "
"3606970","3609650"," So I think it's charging."
"3611430","3612510"," It's charging right now."
"3612530","3614110"," It wasn't it was plugged in, but not charging. "
"3618550","3620010"," What did you guys think of the Iowa caucus?"
"3620250","3621010"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"3621590","3624230"," This is more I guess I was question of Democrats out there."
"3624970","3629750"," Do you guys think if you're a Democrat, do you think it's good or bad?"
"3630910","3637110"," If Trump number one, Iowa caucuses don't tend to pick candidates too well historically. "
"3639890","3642270"," I let me ask you if you're a Democrat."
"3642530","3645710"," Do you think you're in danger of losing the general election?"
"3646810","3647990"," If Trump is the candidate."
"3650550","3651390"," I want to know that. "
"3651630","3656150"," I want to answer that question because I think it's personally, I think it's better for Democrats"
"3656150","3658310"," for Trump to win the nomination."
"3659430","3666730"," The other positive for Democrats, I think, is that there is no I was expecting like a Trump."
"3667650","3669790"," Or my view for Republicans. "
"3671070","3676930"," I wanted to see a populist that didn't piss people off."
"3677590","3679850"," Run for office this year."
"3680930","3682890"," And I haven't seen that candidate. "
"3683640","3686890"," I was looking for like a rock or something."
"3687070","3687790"," Somebody like that."
"3688730","3695130"," They seem like they would they would come off as being like an everybody candidate. "
"3696250","3701750"," And then you'd be able to you're in as a Republican so far from my perspective."
"3703130","3708530"," I see Trump as if you're a Democrat, you want Trump to be the Republican candidate."
"3709610","3711330"," I should say that number one. "
"3712150","3716170"," Most models show Biden winning against Trump."
"3716670","3719770"," But then last night I saw a bunch of Democrats going batshit crazy."
"3720790","3723650"," And they were like doom and gloom doom and gloom and gloom. "
"3724110","3725410"," And I was like these people are stupid."
"3725710","3726630"," They don't know what they're talking about."
"3727310","3731610"," They don't want to be running against the scientists that don't want to be running against any of"
"3731610","3732210"," these other candidates. "
"3733370","3737270"," At least in my view, the modeling that's been done says that Trump would lose."
"3737790","3739730"," So I guess you kind of want Trump to be the nominee."
"3740170","3743370"," Oh, my phone is blowing up like crazy right now. "
"3745210","3747890"," I don't know if I was being picked up right now, but."
"3749030","3749970"," You hear all this?"
"3752390","3754130"," That might be all the dings that might have been all."
"3754390","3755490"," Oh, no, there's more of them. "
"3756250","3757010"," Just digging."
"3758450","3760890"," But I'm fascinated to find out for you guys what you think."
"3761630","3762970"," About that Iowa caucus. "
"3762970","3770630"," If you think that it's bad for Democrats, so you'd prefer to run Biden against someone different."
"3771370","3773530"," You guys probably already know that I'm a Democrat."
"3774070","3775990"," Not that that matters what we're doing here. "
"3776750","3779690"," As a matter of fact, funny is I probably won't."
"3779890","3781550"," I'll probably burn my vote."
"3781790","3785930"," I'll probably end up voting for someone other than Biden. "
"3786390","3787590"," I won't be voting for Republican."
"3788310","3793350"," But I'm not a fan of his vice presidents and I'm not a fan of Biden."
"3793790","3795930"," Basically, I think Biden was like a."
"3797110","3800990"," I think Biden was like a like a just the United States is like we're fucking done. "
"3801190","3801630"," We need a break."
"3803210","3804350"," You fucking break."
"3804990","3810630"," He seems like the most innocuous person we can take a break with. "
"3811150","3814150"," I could be wrong in that, but that's how I felt about him."
"3815150","3816210"," Biden being president."
"3817050","3818890"," And I really don't like his VP. "
"3819210","3820090"," I'll be honest with you."
"3822090","3824130"," She came in last place for the Democrats."
"3825410","3827630"," That's that should be all the answer that you need in that. "
"3828110","3831530"," So I'm afraid of who is he going to be able to run out his presidency?"
"3832950","3835190"," Will he be still be the president?"
"3836530","3839530"," He'll be getting up there in age and it's it's real."
"3839830","3842270"," So, you know, how old is Biden right now?"
"3842270","3844130"," 2054 in the week."
"3844270","3845450"," How old are both of those guys?"
"3846010","3847110"," Biden is what?"
"3849150","3850550"," Let's find out how old they are. "
"3850830","3853390"," I looked it up a couple of weeks ago and I was like, yeah, yeah."
"3853890","3855910"," It's like Biden's 81 years old, right?"
"3856270","3858070"," Guys can go at 80 fucking 586."
"3858730","3862510"," Like, I remember, I remember Reagan, dude. "
"3863190","3864330"," The guy was senile."
"3864930","3869190"," You know, the guy was fucking senile towards the end of his presidency."
"3869190","3873770"," If you've already booked any biographies about him, the guy was out of it. "
"3873930","3878710"," The end of his presidency is everybody else was running the presidency for him."
"3879470","3880850"," And how old is Trump?"
"3881110","3881310"," He's not."
"3881530","3883190"," He ain't no spring chicken either, right?"
"3884610","3886810"," That guy is 77 years old. "
"3886990","3890890"," Neither of these guys are like, how are we running these guys?"
"3891850","3891910"," Why?"
"3892190","3896690"," You want, you want some 80 year old, 85 year old, there's a press and I don't fucking get it."
"3897430","3897990"," Okay."
"3904090","3905210"," All right. "
"3906170","3906390"," There."
"3906670","3911710"," I think you're, I think you're, I think you're both out of your minds like, I can't believe that"
"3911710","3915530"," either party would want to run somebody that's 80 fucking years old."
"3916910","3918910"," 78, 77, 82. "
"3919270","3919610"," I don't care."
"3920250","3921110"," Like, that's just ridiculous."
"3921110","3922650"," Another five years. "
"3923590","3925110"," These guys in office."
"3928850","3931910"," Yeah, it's both sides."
"3932150","3940650"," I'm like, what, you don't pay a treasury two to ten yield a curve steepens to minus 17 spot seven"
"3940650","3941210"," basis points. "
"3941510","3943770"," That's the least inverted since November."
"3944650","3946110"," I got my own problems too."
"3946670","3951210"," Like, I voted for Bernie and then like I voted for Bernie again. "
"3951210","3954330"," And then I'm like, it even, I was like, he's too fucking old too."
"3954670","3957290"," The last election, I was like Bernie's too fucking old."
"3957670","3962710"," Like, is there any, you tell me got nobody that's like 50, 60 years old?"
"3962910","3963230"," Ain't nobody. "
"3963490","3963790"," It's viable."
"3968010","3970150"," Is that really asking too much?"
"3970870","3973410"," I'm not even asking for 35 to 55."
"3973850","3974210"," Just 60. "
"3974210","3975650"," I get 60."
"3976930","3978350"," Like, there's just it."
"3983270","3984710"," Now you like to mimic. "
"3985090","3987230"," So I didn't care for him personally."
"3987730","3989930"," He reminded me of like an amway salesman."
"3991550","3994930"," I did listen to him finally and I was like, Oh, fuck no. "
"3995710","3998730"," But, but I'll give you this age wise."
"3999110","4001270"," I mean, the guy is fucking 80 years old, is he?"
"4001810","4005710"," I'd like to see like a bunch of those candidates, maybe not all of them."
"4006130","4007730"," But, you know, like three or four. "
"4008150","4014410"," If you have like a field of like six or seven candidates, I'm sure you can scare up three or"
"4014410","4014630"," four."
"4014770","4016470"," Same for the Democrats, right?"
"4018510","4019610"," 80 years old."
"4020030","4021170"," You guys are fucking out of your minds. "
"4022010","4024170"," My vote is likely going to get burned."
"4024570","4025230"," I'm not voting."
"4025550","4026670"," I find it. "
"4026950","4029610"," I doubt that I'm going to vote for Biden."
"4029610","4032650"," And I doubt that I'm going to vote for a Republican."
"4033810","4035110"," I'm on protest vote. "
"4035310","4037650"," This piss is like, or me being a Democrat."
"4037930","4039410"," This makes Democrats even more angry."
"4039770","4040790"," They hate my vote. "
"4041050","4043390"," I'm the voter that I'm not the voter that's the independent voter."
"4043910","4044970"," But I get a lot of it."
"4045110","4046430"," I see it on the Internet too. "
"4046510","4052650"," They're like this fucking voter right here is why we lose when we lose or at least part inside the"
"4052650","4052970"," party."
"4054450","4056990"," But I probably will throw my vote away."
"4056990","4059130"," Yeah, I'm not fucking doing it. "
"4059550","4060570"," I'm not going to."
"4062450","4063130"," I vote."
"4063490","4065230"," I'm a voter actually voted on my elections. "
"4065450","4066710"," I vote on all my local elections."
"4067630","4070150"," Like if we have a special election, I'm there."
"4070390","4070830"," I vote. "
"4072050","4073310"," You guys seem with the sticker sometimes."
"4074290","4075970"," But I'm an actual voter."
"4076290","4080870"," I've always been a voter since I was first eligible to vote. "
"4081970","4086090"," I still believe in voting as being important."
"4091170","4092570"," Still one of those people that votes."
"4094550","4097430"," Most people are I feel like a lot of people today. "
"4098670","4100149"," A lot of young people."
"4100370","4101450"," I could be wrong in this."
"4101750","4103790"," The numbers seem to agree with me to an extent. "
"4104649","4107609"," They like internet fist pump and then they don't vote."
"4108670","4110050"," That drives me fucking bad."
"4110229","4112470"," So if you're young and watching this program, please vote. "
"4112790","4116069"," I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat, please fucking vote."
"4116850","4118890"," The whole Internet thing."
"4119210","4124149"," You're being like sucked into this vacuum where you feel better or feel good. "
"4124870","4126109"," But bitch it on the Internet."
"4126529","4127490"," You don't actually vote."
"4128250","4133960"," Yeah, I can't do it. "
"4134020","4134800"," I can't do it."
"4134840","4135399"," I can't."
"4135660","4136640"," I'm not going to do it. "
"4136720","4141060"," I personally refuse to just do."
"4141899","4144479"," Good morning out there."
"4144540","4144840"," How's it all?"
"4144920","4145340"," How y'all doing?"
"4147720","4148859"," Yeah, there's some. "
"4149620","4151420"," I think it's going to get worse."
"4151840","4155760"," When I speak sometimes I'll ask people that are young."
"4156160","4158340"," Why are you not fucking voting?"
"4159340","4161160"," And they say they'd feel like their vote doesn't count. "
"4161660","4164399"," Or that it doesn't matter or the candidates not there."
"4167899","4175319"," It's bizarre because it's the only way for their."
"4176380","4182600"," That you still have power in this country and we're giving that up. "
"4184359","4185439"," All of us are."
"4186240","4191300"," You're being told that you're basically being told to cast your vote on the Internet."
"4192939","4200980"," Go on Facebook and be in a small or be in a room in echo chamber and yell at each"
"4200980","4201880"," other there, right?"
"4202180","4202680"," Go on Twitter. "
"4203180","4203820"," Go on Reddit."
"4204700","4209320"," And these are easy places for you to be turned into."
"4211400","4217260"," And influenced into making decisions about your own politics, right?"
"4217520","4218160"," Now you see it. "
"4218360","4219740"," We see everybody fighting with each other."
"4220480","4221020"," Plabs, right?"
"4221180","4222920"," All the poorest fighting with each other in public."
"4223800","4226480"," And not just casting their fucking vote. "
"4227380","4227460"," Right?"
"4227800","4228580"," They don't want you to cut."
"4228820","4229780"," You guys know this, right?"
"4230860","4232360"," Democrats and Republicans."
"4233160","4234980"," Would rather nobody vote. "
"4236140","4239740"," So the more people that don't vote, the better off the party is."
"4240360","4243920"," Doesn't matter if you're Republican or Democrat, the more that you don't vote, the better off you"
"4243920","4245180"," are because what they do."
"4245740","4251320"," Is they get you to not vote and then they get their most ardent supporters only to vote. "
"4253320","4255180"," So that's a that's a feature."
"4255560","4256080"," Right?"
"4256080","4256960"," For both parties."
"4257960","4262520"," For you not to vote, especially if you're in the middle of the road or if you're can be swayed,"
"4262980","4263840"," your vote can be swayed. "
"4264080","4264780"," They don't want you voting."
"4265220","4266060"," The better off."
"4266500","4272140"," They're better off without you voting or being a voter and just not showing up. "
"4272820","4273780"," Believe it or not."
"4274620","4278520"," So they create right now, you got companies too that want to influence your vote."
"4279220","4281540"," It's like social media is a big part of that right now. "
"4282760","4285440"," Here, bitch, in this place over here, but don't vote."
"4286460","4294120"," And the truthfully, our Constitution is built around is basically built around you being able to"
"4294120","4297240"," make changes with your fucking vote."
"4297480","4300200"," So anyways, you can vote to get out there and vote in this election. "
"4300920","4304240"," I don't care if Republican, Democrat, make sure you get in your vote."
"4304660","4305340"," Make sure it counts."
"4306060","4309720"," Even if it's a vote, that's a protest vote. "
"4309720","4310920"," Still vote."
"4311300","4314660"," Make sure they know that you're out there and that you are voting."
"4315460","4318940"," Your vote scares both parties, believe it or not. "
"4320240","4322740"," They don't like seeing voters telling you."
"4323300","4323880"," So vote."
"4324480","4325560"," Please get out there and do that. "
"4325640","4327980"," We talked about the election so far, right?"
"4328580","4329940"," We're down with the election talk."
"4332480","4333040"," Yeah."
"4333500","4333640"," Yeah. "
"4333880","4336780"," Politics is like it's a wild fucking thing."
"4337480","4340060"," Squeeze up now, trying to trade the pivot here."
"4340680","4343580"," Bulls want to get above this pivot and try to trade that 4800. "
"4345160","4347040"," See if we can look at it on the upside here."
"4347160","4350760"," This is the call wall to the upside for bear or on SPX."
"4352700","4354540"," Move this over for you right here. "
"4356440","4358720"," This is that 4800 down below."
"4359060","4359740"," Let me show this."
"4365090","4367990"," I'll write the call wall into the upside up here. "
"4380370","4382930"," There is the call wall for you down there."
"4383230","4384430"," Just ping pong and around."
"4385350","4386530"," Same as last week. "
"4399050","4401190"," Yeah, we have to create the society we want."
"4401330","4403410"," Take care of your family, your neighborhood."
"4403570","4404770"," Hold politicians accountable. "
"4405530","4407090"," Yeah, I'll be honest."
"4407750","4408390"," Who's that?"
"4408690","4409230"," See Tazo?"
"4410130","4411790"," I've become very jaded."
"4412650","4413730"," Very jaded. "
"4414210","4416070"," I don't trust any of them."
"4416290","4417410"," I don't trust the Senate."
"4418450","4422370"," Disgusted that the Senate is making money off the stock market. "
"4422650","4425990"," It's not just Nancy Pelosi either, is it?"
"4426350","4428050"," It's all of them, right?"
"4428270","4429810"," Our Senate has become disgusting."
"4431010","4432790"," Very offended by our Senate."
"4432970","4436750"," I'm offended by our parties. "
"4437430","4439150"," The DNC and the RNC."
"4440630","4441750"," It's all power and money."
"4441950","4444370"," Our system is disgusting to me. "
"4444370","4454490"," Meanwhile, I'm very offended by the pours, man."
"4454630","4459370"," If you make less than $300,000 a year, you're one of the pours."
"4459830","4462090"," You probably don't think that you are, but you are. "
"4463090","4464750"," I tell this story sometimes."
"4465450","4466410"," Was that a jury once?"
"4467830","4470510"," And a lot of GWIs, right?"
"4470510","4477530"," A lot of the people that were in there for GWI were of political persuasion where they voted for"
"4477530","4478570"," them to get into trouble."
"4479270","4482670"," And I'm like, I want reform for these people. "
"4482830","4486750"," I don't want them being gouged for money or being put in jail."
"4487250","4488350"," I want people to change, right?"
"4489090","4491250"," It's not drinking, driving, stuff like that."
"4491470","4493830"," So the whole system is kind of fucking bizarre to me. "
"4495270","4498870"," Our whole system, all of it is just like really bizarre."
"4500150","4504690"," Meanwhile, you guys are out there killing each other in the streets, right?"
"4504890","4508650"," Not killing each other, but I hate you and I hate this and I hate that."
"4508910","4510470"," It's all your fault and all that kind of shit. "
"4510810","4513490"," Around dinner tables, holiday dinner tables."
"4514050","4517610"," You've got people that aren't friends with their parents, the grandparents, grandparents, the kids,"
"4517790","4519870"," kids at the parents, all that other kind of shit."
"4520950","4527890"," It's like a tear in the fabric of our country right now that's really bothering me. "
"4527890","4531350"," More so than even the 60s and 70s and stuff."
"4531550","4536950"," There's an actual tribalism going on that's kind of bizarre to me."
"4537930","4544870"," Although I would want that if I was a large tech company, if I was a nation state, if I"
"4544870","4549790"," was a nation state, I would be happy with where the US is headed right now. "
"4550430","4555650"," If I was a corporation, I would be happy with being able to influence how you vote."
"4556420","4560590"," And I think that's that third players coming in."
"4560730","4565470"," We had some oligarchy stuff going on a couple of decades ago, but now there's this corporation,"
"4566050","4568450"," corporate environment, nation states that are getting involved. "
"4569230","4575710"," Artificial intelligence as well are getting involved in the destruction of the fabric of our"
"4575710","4576030"," country."
"4576970","4578550"," And I'm very afraid of it right now."
"4582590","4583570"," Yeah, they won't. "
"4583630","4584350"," I agree with that too."
"4584470","4585390"," But our vote does matter."
"4585810","4591710"," There are times when voting can matter and we're giving that up. "
"4591870","4593930"," That's the shit that's freaking me out the most."
"4594430","4600550"," If there's like anything in this country that's freaking me out the most, it's the decision of an"
"4600550","4605570"," American literally saying my vote doesn't count."
"4605570","4612310"," That is the most fucked up thing that I could ever hear. "
"4613130","4616150"," It's one of the only things."
"4617370","4618630"," I was reading a story this weekend."
"4620630","4624070"," The military academies in this country, right?"
"4624790","4634750"," The Naval Academy, West Point, they're reinforcing some teaching and training for officers in the"
"4634750","4637190"," United States military right now. "
"4637910","4646850"," And they're trying to reinforce that our own military is loyal to the constitution of the United"
"4646850","4647730"," States of America."
"4648690","4651950"," Not to a president, but to our constitution."
"4654010","4659690"," And for the devaluing of our constitution that goes out on this country, I'll tell you what, man,"
"4659850","4662950"," it's on that same line of thinking as you as a civilian. "
"4663550","4666970"," The most powerful thing that you can do is go to a voting booth."
"4667550","4669670"," Regardless of your party, I want you to know that."
"4670610","4675170"," Your vote is so scary to people in power. "
"4675370","4676030"," It really is."
"4676370","4678010"," It really, really is."
"4678770","4680450"," I can't express that more. "
"4680790","4681690"," Fucking please vote."
"4682550","4685630"," If you're young, please listen to me vote."
"4686750","4687230"," Vote, vote, vote. "
"4687410","4688190"," You can protest."
"4688570","4689190"," You can do whatever you want."
"4690190","4690690"," Fucking vote. "
"4691350","4693190"," It's become easier than it ever has, right?"
"4693990","4697210"," I think through COVID, a lot of you can still do by the mail voting."
"4697390","4698070"," So we probably can't."
"4698150","4701610"," Some of those rules are still there where you can vote through the mail. "
"4702230","4704150"," It's really out there and vote."
"4704630","4706270"," So another more I can say on the subject."
"4708150","4709990"," It's the one last thing you have. "
"4710350","4715130"," It's like if they've taken everything away from you, it's the one fucking thing that you have that"
"4715130","4716150"," you can do to make a difference."
"4722560","4723620"," Yeah, 300,000."
"4723740","4725300"," I shouldn't be saying that either, should I?"
"4725400","4728560"," $300,000 salary is not what it once was. "
"4728780","4729780"," We discussed that here."
"4729880","4730140"," Didn't we?"
"4730280","4732460"," We said we used to say 300,000."
"4732600","4733620"," Above 300,000. "
"4733700","4736260"," You're pretty or you're on the wealthy side of living."
"4736620","4737160"," That is true."
"4737380","4738320"," I'm with you on that. "
"4738620","4741800"," The 300,000 bucks is about 100 K, right?"
"4742100","4743400"," It's the new 100,000."
"4745320","4746580"," You'll have to grow into that, right?"
"4746920","4747820"," You're young right now."
"4747900","4750900"," Come out of college over the next 10 to 20 years. "
"4750900","4753600"," You're going to be looking to make 300,000."
"4753760","4754860"," I agree with that statement too."
"4756800","4759960"," Most like engineers up until COVID. "
"4760180","4763180"," They wanted to make 90 to $120,000."
"4764320","4766920"," That's like that was like, that's what I want for pay."
"4767480","4773200"," My assumption here is like yours that in the next 10 years, if you're a new college grad, you're"
"4773200","4775140"," going to be gunning for 300,000. "
"4775260","4775700"," I would be."
"4777020","4778500"," That's what I'd be like gunning."
"4778640","4783700"," I don't think I'd get it right now, but if I was graduating, I'd be hoping for like 120 in"
"4783700","4787540"," the low end and be working into 300 in the next five years. "
"4788420","4789020"," That's what I'd be."
"4789160","4791920"," My expectations would be there as a young graduate."
"4796360","4797360"," Yeah, I don't care about. "
"4797480","4798540"," I think protesting is fine."
"4798680","4800220"," I got no problems with protesting."
"4801540","4803800"," I got no problems with bitching on the Internet. "
"4804980","4808820"," The one issue like like voting on the Internet's right."
"4808980","4813520"," I mean, in terms of like I placed my vote in our politics or our conservative."
"4813820","4818980"," I mean, my intent here is that your vote matters more than you're bitching on the Internet. "
"4819660","4823340"," And they want nothing more than you to bitch on the Internet, not vote."
"4823760","4824160"," They want you to."
"4824260","4825500"," They don't want you to vote. "
"4826440","4828180"," So fucking please vote."
"4828400","4830300"," Please, please, please vote out there if you can."
"4832360","4834380"," All right, what else are we going to talk about today?"
"4834540","4835980"," Should we talk about Davos at any point?"
"4835980","4837020"," Is it worth talking about?"
"4837620","4840080"," Now, let me know if you want me to discuss Davos for you. "
"4840460","4843080"," A bunch of old fucking guys out there."
"4847440","4849460"," If you want me to talk about it, I can."
"4854600","4858020"," They can't impact the stock market if they say the wrong thing sometimes. "
"4859820","4862160"," I don't know if you want me to discuss Davos."
"4862160","4864440"," I can play some of the live streams if you want."
"4866440","4867320"," Talk OpEx. "
"4867440","4867560"," Sorry."
"4867700","4868240"," Talked about it."
"4868760","4870380"," I can talk about OpEx again if you want. "
"4870900","4873360"," There's a pennant or bulls want to pin it."
"4873460","4875740"," 4,800 into OpEx."
"4876020","4877880"," They don't want to go below 4,750. "
"4879080","4880800"," If we break below 4,750."
"4883200","4884980"," It's bad news for the bulls."
"4885840","4888340"," There's not gammas rolling off as we come into OpEx. "
"4889160","4893900"," I talked to you earlier about the notional value of gamma on the market."
"4894680","4900120"," As we head into OpEx, that gamma that rolls off the top of the hour."
"4900780","4905560"," Fed Governor Waller speaks at the Brookings Institute about the economic outlook and monetary"
"4905560","4906140"," policy. "
"4906680","4911420"," The text is expected as well as a Q&A with the moderator and there is a live stream available"
"4911420","4913360"," to register for this event."
"4913360","4917000"," The link is on Fed's Waller's entry in the financial geese calendar."
"4919200","4922480"," So the pin to 4,800 wears off as the week progresses. "
"4923400","4926660"," Hopefully we park the bus in between 4,750 and 4,800."
"4927720","4929700"," That's what a bull is hoping for at minimum."
"4930480","4937740"," We don't want to start breaking below that 4,750 as that gamma pin comes off throughout the week. "
"4950080","4950740"," Thanks, Bork."
"4951000","4952580"," Yeah, we've got a whole series on it, Bork."
"4956820","4960460"," Yeah, exactly what the young girl menu is at Davos this year. "
"4960900","4961700"," It's so gross."
"4962060","4970760"," There was an article done, I don't know, a few years ago that talked about how there's no women of"
"4970760","4971920"," the night aren't available."
"4972820","4975480"," While these guys are in Davos, it's so gross. "
"4975480","4978420"," Like having to look at the balls of some old 80-year-old man."
"4978940","4981040"," Some big, I won't say anything."
"4988560","4998990"," Yeah, Joe"
"4998990","5003330"," Donut just said six figures now means 250,000, 100% Joe. "
"5005590","5007410"," We got taxis and coming out."
"5007630","5010330"," We got taxis and we should talk about that at some point too."
"5012210","5013470"," What else we got here?"
"5015050","5022070"," I always, I found it funny that, so it's kind of funny they're like Jim Kramer this morning was"
"5022070","5027390"," talking about sunsetting some of these tax breaks for ultra wealthy people. "
"5027870","5030470"," And I was fascinating."
"5030830","5036050"," I found it fascinating because he was like, he was like, I'm fine with sunsetting all these tax"
"5036050","5036710"," breaks."
"5037170","5041490"," I'm like, why don't we sunset some of those tax breaks from 1978 and 1980. "
"5042850","5045750"," 1984, anywhere from 78 to 84, you want to sunset that shit?"
"5046370","5047430"," See what he says to that."
"5047630","5049150"," He's like, fuck you, no, no way."
"5052830","5054070"," We'll give some of this back. "
"5054750","5059250"," I'm like, yeah, you've given it back from like past four years, like what six years ago or"
"5059250","5059510"," something."
"5060770","5061470"," Try out."
"5061730","5063090"," Let's try it from like 1980. "
"5063730","5064650"," Can we do that?"
"5064990","5066170"," No, the answer will be no."
"5069950","5077210"," Let me see what you guys are saying here."
"5081100","5083800"," You liked Vivek and his willingness to bid anyone. "
"5084480","5093460"," You know, Vivek was very popular for what I noticed was in our conservative, a lot of the young"
"5093460","5094680"," people in there liked him."
"5094680","5104660"," And then neo-liberals, so neo-democrats, neo-liberals, they liked"
"5104660","5105140"," them too."
"5105940","5108380"," They had an affinity forum as well. "
"5109920","5112360"," I thought he was an Amway salesman."
"5112620","5112920"," I'll be honest."
"5113940","5114320"," I apologize. "
"5115040","5116720"," He reminded me of an Amway salesman."
"5117680","5120780"," But I know that he made a lot of people happy."
"5120780","5129920"," Yeah, I'm looking for if you guys want to know what I'm looking for. "
"5132420","5137060"," What am I looking for in a president?"
"5137560","5147560"," No, I don't know if he exists or she exists right now."
"5147600","5151480"," I'm trying to think of someone fit that bill right now."
"5151840","5152880"," It's a tough one. "
"5156410","5157650"," I have to think about it."
"5158330","5161290"," I don't see any candidates that fit that bill for me."
"5162070","5163950"," There's a lot of work that needs to be done. "
"5165330","5168850"," I don't know if there's one candidate that could do that work for where we are right now."
"5175890","5178150"," That's why Biden loses to Trump."
"5178790","5182790"," So none of the models that are out there that I've seen, maybe I can be wrong in this, but"
"5182790","5185470"," the models that I've seen says Trump loses to Biden. "
"5188150","5189470"," Not some of the other candidates."
"5190910","5191770"," That's what I've seen."
"5192090","5196710"," I'm getting wrong in that, but that's the modeling that I've seen is you want that match up. "
"5198590","5200110"," In five minutes time now."
"5200270","5200890"," As we got here."
"5201870","5203790"," Governor Waller speaks to the Brookings. "
"5204030","5205390"," When will the tools be ready?"
"5205730","5210070"," So we're working on the tools to be launched on the 31st is expensive as well as a Q&A."
"5210290","5211610"," We're on the 16th right now."
"5211630","5215730"," So hopefully we're still in line to that 31st launch entry in the calendar. "
"5216510","5217490"," What else we got here?"
"5222860","5228860"," Oh, maybe I should get you the, let me get to the hourly trigger on Tesla to you guys have"
"5228860","5229400"," that already."
"5230280","5231640"," Early trigger on Tesla."
"5241880","5244560"," Where is the hourly trigger on Tesla?"
"5245080","5252820"," Early trigger on Tesla is that two twenty seventeen two twenty seventeen is the hourly trigger on"
"5252820","5253080"," Tesla. "
"5275660","5279640"," I think I read through most of your comments what I could get to there."
"5284400","5287040"," No one will bring out the Dems to vote like Trump."
"5287260","5288240"," Yeah, there's like a."
"5291460","5293540"," That's the modeling that I saw. "
"5295560","5299600"," That's the modeling that I saw had other candidates beating to Biden."
"5299600","5304220"," It was Trump was like the I think someone just said it there."
"5304320","5307340"," They said nobody nobody will bring out the Dems to vote like Trump. "
"5307620","5310740"," I think that's what that's the thesis there too is that."
"5313260","5315880"," It's more of the lightning rod aspect to it."
"5316740","5320300"," Then I was surprised to be honest with you. "
"5320460","5322980"," I'm surprised that the Republicans didn't bring out."
"5323240","5325280"," So like Trump was a was a populist."
"5328120","5334860"," But he also as a populist was very divisive for people. "
"5335440","5336840"," He's very much like Reagan."
"5337600","5341480"," But then there was a lot of bad shit that came with that unlike Reagan."
"5342140","5343660"," I thought they would bring out a candidate. "
"5344080","5347040"," I thought Republicans would bring out a candidate very similar to that."
"5347680","5350280"," This election cycle they didn't."
"5350280","5352520"," Be able to like reach both sides. "
"5352860","5355160"," Not piss off everybody while you're doing it."
"5355660","5357020"," That didn't seem to happen."
"5364050","5365050"," Also got here. "
"5365330","5365890"," Chase is here."
"5366070","5368290"," Well, I got to go on to YouTube and see what people are saying here."
"5369150","5370730"," All right, let's read through YouTube comments. "
"5370990","5372530"," Some of that's not in my feed right now."
"5372970","5374290"," Let me reset my feed."
"5375470","5377090"," I'm going to refresh my chats. "
"5377410","5378670"," I'm getting YouTube comments again."
"5379550","5380430"," Andre, how are you?"
"5380550","5380810"," Good morning."
"5380970","5381530"," Tim, how are you?"
"5382230","5382590"," Hiroshi. "
"5383670","5384390"," Arthur Solom."
"5384810","5385330"," Stacey F."
"5385510","5385770"," Good morning."
"5386050","5386570"," How are y'all doing?"
"5386930","5387170"," Tanner. "
"5387310","5387630"," Good morning."
"5387730","5388110"," How are you?"
"5388910","5389890"," What else we got here?"
"5390570","5390830"," Will M."
"5390950","5391230"," Good morning."
"5391230","5391630"," How are you?"
"5391770","5391950"," Good morning. "
"5393710","5394030"," Face."
"5394330","5394710"," Good morning."
"5397450","5400110"," Rocket surgeon said he got some saucer sledding in this weekend. "
"5400810","5401430"," Got banged up."
"5404490","5407570"," Let me see what we got here."
"5409870","5410850"," Good morning, David. "
"5410990","5411530"," How are you, brother?"
"5411730","5412130"," Good to see you."
"5412270","5416250"," Happy vacation, David, AMS. We were trying to get you on the show on Friday. "
"5416250","5417110"," That didn't happen."
"5417930","5419270"," Good to see you, though, as well."
"5420050","5420690"," It's hustle ripping. "
"5422610","5424270"," Never a down day ever again."
"5424770","5425410"," John Hagerty."
"5425650","5425950"," Good morning. "
"5426810","5427170"," Elon shares."
"5427510","5427570"," Yep."
"5427710","5428610"," I read that one earlier. "
"5430330","5430790"," John Hagerty."
"5432870","5433850"," Toss again."
"5434050","5435310"," Nice green boner this morning. "
"5435590","5436290"," Let's close draft."
"5436350","5437350"," Again, the window of weakness."
"5437650","5438310"," Hope so, Chase. "
"5438410","5439230"," One of the remaining tweaks."
"5439450","5441410"," Take the text release for Fence Waller."
"5442410","5443650"," Let me see what we got here. "
"5443830","5444070"," Blissowitz."
"5444290","5444630"," Good morning."
"5444810","5445190"," How are you?"
"5445450","5446210"," Trump got the most votes. "
"5446370","5447210"," Very presidential in history."
"5447590","5447910"," 2020."
"5448350","5451850"," Consider Biden's total legit. "
"5453130","5453610"," Yeah."
"5453850","5454630"," I did notice that."
"5454830","5455090"," Blissowitz. "
"5455370","5460390"," They had some exit polling over in Iowa and they definitely said that."
"5460390","5465770"," I think it was 60% of the caucus voters said that the."
"5466410","5468170"," Biden did not win the election. "
"5468730","5471110"," They didn't feel as though Biden had won the election."
"5471350","5471750"," It was stolen."
"5476420","5479780"," Everyone who says that they want Trump to be the candidate because he'll lose. "
"5480560","5483820"," Is seriously underestimating how much support he actually has."
"5485340","5489580"," Bill Ackman, Elon Musk, host of the space session yesterday during which Ackman endorsed Dean"
"5489580","5490040"," Phillips."
"5493180","5494620"," What else we got here?"
"5495500","5498980"," Will I vote for Newsome when he decides to run with big Mike?"
"5501300","5502820"," As well as as Adrian the last. "
"5502940","5506460"," I don't know to consider cutting the policy rate this year."
"5506860","5511200"," So the Fed will be able to cut the policy rate this year as long as inflation doesn't rebound or"
"5511200","5511920"," stay high."
"5511920","5513740"," I believe the policy is separate. "
"5514180","5514720"," Dean Phillips."
"5514720","5516540"," Use the risks to the Fed."
"5516660","5519140"," Drop the 5% the next couple of weeks. "
"5519140","5521120"," I don't think you get the 5% chase."
"5521380","5523120"," But I will need more information in the coming months."
"5523120","5529540"," I am confident that we are within striking distance of achieving a sustainable 2% inflation target. "
"5529980","5530480"," Good morning."
"5530640","5531620"," Where are you?"
"5531900","5534560"," That must be carefully calibrated and not rush."
"5535120","5540300"," Says this view is consistent with Fed policy making projections for 325 basis point rate cuts this"
"5540300","5540620"," year. "
"5540620","5544040"," That's Wallace as a slowdown in consumer spending appears tentative."
"5544740","5548860"," We'll find out more from Wednesday's retail sales data there."
"5549380","5555400"," Economic activity has moderated and rate cuts should be done methodically and carefully. "
"5556020","5557980"," No reason to cut as quickly as in the past."
"5558680","5562820"," Says the timing and actual number of cuts will depend on incoming data and that financial"
"5562820","5564800"," conditions do remain restrictive."
"5564800","5570120"," So setting of policy again needs to proceed with more caution to avoid over tightening now. "
"5570580","5573680"," Says the December jobs report was largely noise."
"5574340","5578780"," Ongoing moderation in the labor market supports progress towards 2% inflation target."
"5579460","5583800"," So this takes really some feds while it's coinciding with some weakness in the S&P 500 and some"
"5583800","5585400"," strength in the dollar now. "
"5593230","5599210"," Let me go check my spreads here."
"5605260","5610900"," Let's go back to YouTube."
"5612020","5615380"," I'm reading through some of your comments here. "
"5616460","5617080"," Brad A."
"5617620","5618020"," Santa vote."
"5618240","5619920"," Vote for counting the votes accurately."
"5621120","5626320"," There was something some takeaway last night with the Iowa caucus. "
"5626780","5632980"," They asked three or four exit questions and those questions are still."
"5633280","5635360"," I mean, there's some still some touchiness, right?"
"5635460","5639520"," If you're Republican, some of those things are still there for you."
"5639560","5641000"," I can see it in the chat here on YouTube. "
"5641000","5643880"," Two people are still raising those same questions."
"5650820","5652540"," Show that right there for you."
"5655360","5658080"," I have a hard time with this, like, who's running?"
"5658380","5664480"," I feel like some of the people are asking me in the chat who would I vote for. "
"5665380","5666620"," We need an overhaul."
"5670000","5675000"," We need an overhaul of our politics."
"5675760","5677980"," We probably need a third party. "
"5678880","5684500"," And if not more parties, I like the ranked voting concepts out there."
"5686000","5689320"," I think we need to flush almost everyone out of the Senate."
"5693660","5697440"," We need some rules for anyone. "
"5699220","5705480"," We see the US at $85 billion in four-week bills on January 18, settling on January 23."
"5706260","5710780"," That's a $5 billion increase in four-week bill sales for next week's tenure."
"5711300","5712980"," Watch that closer there. "
"5713980","5719800"," There was a congressman saying that their pay wasn't high enough."
"5720760","5723000"," I'm like, that's high enough."
"5724720","5728040"," I want family members banned from specific. "
"5728360","5731900"," I want people banned, like, all of them."
"5733680","5743400"," I want them banned from taking positions as, like, once they leave the Senate, they"
"5743400","5749220"," can't take a job as a, I figure it's called right now."
"5749480","5751920"," This is my dad's job, actually, when he did for his living. "
"5753640","5759060"," When you leave the Senate and you start being, I feel what it's called, but they are anymore."
"5759060","5759540"," But whatever."
"5760180","5763000"," And then their family members shouldn't be able to trade or invest. "
"5763620","5765040"," Like, we need to flush it all."
"5765520","5766820"," The whole thing needs flush."
"5767680","5773280"," I want the incentive taken away from money and power, basically, from all of these fuckers, like"
"5773280","5774600"," every single one of them. "
"5780600","5782160"," Yeah, dude, it's wild."
"5782960","5785520"," I think our whole system is fucked up."
"5787580","5788420"," Yeah, lobbyists. "
"5788740","5792060"," That's my dad was, by the way, who's lobbyists, but like, can't lobby afterwards."
"5793160","5796360"," It's like, it's like, you won the lottery."
"5796700","5799240"," If you become a senator, you won the fucking lottery these days. "
"5799420","5803080"," Even to some extent, the House of Reps, not as bad."
"5804000","5812500"," They kind of expect crazy shit to happen in the House of Reps, but the Senate presidency, the"
"5812500","5822180"," amount of control that the RNC and DNC has over inside of the presidency"
"5822180","5828740"," is bizarre to me as well, like the parties themselves, the power that the parties have is fucking"
"5828740","5829280"," crazy."
"5830140","5832120"," It is absolutely fucking bizarre. "
"5833920","5836000"," You can't even run a candidate anymore, right?"
"5836320","5838020"," Can't run a candidate unless they're rich or picked."
"5838020","5843760"," They pick from one of the parties or if they're rich, you can't run for shit anymore."
"5845440","5846320"," That's a problem. "
"5846580","5850420"," I think that's a problem in our politics right now."
"5855220","5857400"," Yeah, it's like, it's like serious election reform."
"5858260","5859520"," That's a better way to describe it. "
"5859820","5860700"," Serious election reform."
"5861580","5867620"," And then serious, like, if you're, if you are elected reform, like, you do that and I'll probably,"
"5867620","5868980"," I'd probably get more interested."
"5870040","5871180"," I still vote. "
"5871560","5875060"," I just think when you start to ask, like, what kind of reform do we need?"
"5875220","5876860"," It's huge."
"5877760","5884680"," And the only way you get that is from a grassroots movement that's bipartisan, right?"
"5885340","5886820"," You get everybody on board on that."
"5887500","5890080"," I think we're closer to that than it looks to. "
"5890940","5893400"," And that they don't ever want you to be that become that."
"5893560","5896260"," They never want you and I to republic."
"5896260","5901340"," They never want to republic in a democrat to want that kind of reform together. "
"5902220","5902660"," Right."
"5902940","5903200"," They don't."
"5903420","5906020"," And a lot of what we, a lot of us agree on this stuff. "
"5906400","5912240"," I was just having a conversation with some, some MAGA people in person a couple weeks ago."
"5912860","5917080"," And a lot of what we think is not too far off from each other and a lot of these"
"5917080","5917400"," things."
"5917940","5920880"," Not everything, but some things, a reform is a big one. "
"5921540","5925100"," The two year touches session highs of four spot two, four, nine percent."
"5930890","5933350"," No, Obama was, was groomed too, right?"
"5934310","5935550"," Obama was groomed."
"5936330","5941610"," He was, he was not allowed to make important decisions as a senator because if you're a governor,"
"5941770","5944350"," it's a little bit easier to run for office in the Senate. "
"5944730","5946250"," You have a history of voting."
"5947070","5953030"," You can be really banged up for that running for a president for a presidential office."
"5953030","5956890"," And even he was groomed to be president, right?"
"5957210","5965050"," DNC, as a matter of fact, the DNC as a matter of fact has more control over who becomes president"
"5965050","5965990"," than the RNC. "
"5966610","5972730"," I don't know if you know that or not, but it's easier for an outsider to secure a nomination in"
"5972730","5976730"," the Republican party than it is for the Democratic party on Friday."
"5980850","5983670"," Yeah, a lot of you guys are making good points out there right now."
"5983670","5985090"," I'm seeing some of what you guys are posting. "
"5985490","5993250"," I bet they would be easy for Democrats and Republicans to come together on a lot of reform shit."
"5993530","5999090"," I don't think that a lot of Republicans and Democrats are too far off in a lot of this stuff."
"5999670","6001950"," As far off as you think you might be. "
"6008020","6013100"," Well, there's some arguments out there right now too that ranked voting would solve a lot of this."
"6013100","6016500"," I don't know if that's true, but I'm here."
"6016700","6021200"," I'm I'm foreign against ranked voting, but there's some arguments out. "
"6021380","6024940"," If you guys all know about ranked voting, you don't look it up on your own."
"6025700","6035680"," If you had ranked voting with that help, we see what else"
"6035680","6035940"," here."
"6040460","6041940"," Read through some of this here. "
"6044900","6048720"," Yeah, regardless of who it's he Pelosi one."
"6052000","6053440"," That's a fucking hilarious."
"6062750","6070850"," The Dixie briefly rises after comments from feds Waller last up to zero spots 62% at 103 spot to"
"6070850","6071230"," eight. "
"6073310","6074690"," See we got going on here."
"6074830","6075590"," Not too much, right?"
"6076310","6080670"," It's been bouncing around since when since."
"6081050","6085470"," Oh, sorry, since January 8th. "
"6085470","6086710"," And range bound."
"6087710","6093000"," Just ping pong in the long baby."
"6093460","6095960"," I was wondering if the theta gang was going to come out today. "
"6096860","6099240"," I'm assuming theta gang is going to be pumped, right?"
"6109770","6110510"," Yeah, bliss."
"6110670","6115570"," It's the same when people have conversations in terms of practicality and not morality."
"6116030","6116790"," It's much less tense. "
"6116790","6122610"," Many times the conversation isn't impossible because of the emotions associated."
"6123290","6127770"," Yeah, I would really like to see I would really like to see some reflect political reform across"
"6127770","6128330"," the board."
"6128930","6131110"," Just like base like baseline start there. "
"6131770","6134470"," Just like start with just the political reform."
"6135110","6140030"," You know, like when you think about when you think about these these politicians."
"6142550","6149110"," They're selling you basically they sell you basically that we're like in this amplified environment"
"6149110","6150410"," where they're selling you. "
"6151950","6153790"," Hey, this is what it means to be a Democrat."
"6154070","6155570"," Hey, this is what it means to be a Republican."
"6156550","6161430"," None of those fucking people that are selling you that believe in any of it. "
"6161930","6162710"," None of it."
"6164190","6168630"," They don't live in their life is not lived in long those rules."
"6169630","6170990"," I didn't know that. "
"6171750","6178050"," So I didn't learn that stuff until I moved to explain some of this to you."
"6178050","6179430"," So I ended up moving to."
"6180750","6181770"," They'll Colorado. "
"6182950","6183550"," Okay."
"6183830","6190790"," And then from there, I spent a lot of time in very wealthy places with very wealthy people."
"6191570","6198090"," Where I was a minority of not being wealthy, but surrounded by very wealthy people. "
"6198550","6200570"," Not your normal wealthy people."
"6200990","6203270"," Not the not the richest guy in your town."
"6203930","6207450"," But we're talking the rich and powerful from around the world. "
"6207450","6212730"," These are like oil barons from Mexico and down in South America."
"6212730","6220770"," These are politicians from around the United States."
"6220770","6226770"," And they hang out there and they feel safe there to do whatever they want. "
"6227510","6232110"," But you meet these people and also notice that at Burning Man to you."
"6232610","6237810"," You start to notice that these people live on a different a different light."
"6238490","6240730"," They don't live the same life that you and I live. "
"6241130","6243050"," Yet they make all the decisions for us."
"6243890","6248290"," And they're selling you and I a thesis for what we believe in."
"6249110","6254390"," But in fact, those people don't live by any of those restrictions in their own lives. "
"6255370","6256470"," You don't see."
"6257450","6261150"," You don't see police acting a certain way."
"6261450","6264270"," These people can do whatever they fucking want in their lives. "
"6264870","6268730"," And so I just find that disconnect is a fucking bizarre."
"6270350","6271730"," Totally fucking bizarre."
"6272510","6278790"," You know, I'm going to tell you how to vote and because you're poor and I'm going to put you"
"6278790","6280410"," against another poor person basically. "
"6281310","6282670"," And you guys fight with each other."
"6284550","6287310"," And the more you hate each other, the better off we are, right?"
"6288010","6289150"," If I'm rich and powerful."
"6290230","6291190"," That's how I always felt. "
"6291570","6292090"," It was big."
"6292250","6294150"," They came glaring living in those places."
"6294150","6301370"," You start to see how the other 196 lives, you're like, fuck. "
"6302070","6304410"," This isn't based on any kind of reality."
"6310210","6317930"," We have our own like, we have our own form of royalty in the United States now."
"6319290","6321190"," We've like passed up. "
"6322130","6328990"," We didn't want a monarchy or a patriarchy form of government yet."
"6329230","6333030"," We've replaced it with another form of it, right?"
"6333210","6333630"," In some way."
"6341840","6343920"," It is like bum fights. "
"6344520","6346940"," That was the thing you go to."
"6347960","6349560"," It's so fucking bizarre."
"6351300","6352300"," What are you doing?"
"6352440","6356480"," I'm going to vote to fucking hurt myself or not to hurt myself. "
"6356480","6357380"," Either one."
"6372710","6373570"," Yeah, look at that."
"6373710","6376030"," T and X man is just bumping right now. "
"6377730","6378710"," Bumpin' right now."
"6378930","6381590"," Dixie, on the move to the upside right now."
"6381590","6385070"," You're going to buy less than 60% chance of Fed rate cuts in March. "
"6385070","6386110"," Look at the big baby."
"6386170","6389350"," 70% chance seen before Fed's Waller's speech."
"6391510","6394590"," They try G saving its ass down below right now. "
"6396270","6398830"," They've got a gap on the up and down side to close."
"6402080","6403640"," Keep giving me that data, baby."

"6414480","6417440"," I got a feeling that I'm going to be the only winner this week."
"6420300","6421420"," I got the feeling. "
"6421820","6423940"," I got the feeling theta gang is going to be a winner."
"6423940","6425980"," I got a feeling that I'm going to be a winner this week."
"6428420","6430720"," I got this little itch going on going. "
"6430760","6433560"," Yeah, I think I'm going to be the only winner this week in this stream."
"6434040","6435640"," I think you guys are going to get cut up."
"6435880","6440040"," If I had to guess, you guys are going to get cut up this week while they park the fucking"
"6440040","6441980"," bus for Op-X. "
"6442460","6446120"," And I think the risk is to the bulls this week."
"6447740","6452600"," Well, I think Chase was in here earlier and send window of weakness."
"6453660","6456960"," The window of weakness doesn't really mean like blood. "
"6458180","6459060"," It's possible."
"6460220","6461720"," There's possibility of blood."
"6462580","6466960"," I think it's more of like a grind down into the right over the rest of this week. "
"6467300","6471800"," I'm not seeing the doom and gloom that some are seeing."
"6472660","6474500"," The window of weakness is only a window."
"6474500","6477460"," It doesn't mean that we actually go down in a meaningful way. "
"6480700","6482720"," Yeah, that's a better way to describe it, Jay Shady."
"6483200","6484460"," We always talk about that, right?"
"6484640","6486740"," It's more like consolidation-ish."
"6502780","6503660"," So we talked about it. "
"6503780","6504700"," I'll go over it again."
"6504840","6506460"," You guys want to read this to you again."
"6508740","6512360"," Let me go back to some of you guys are just joining us. "
"6512360","6513700"," This is a 30-minute chart right here."
"6519430","6520410"," We'll go over one more time."
"6522370","6528070"," So we've got a nice wave right here, right?"
"6528450","6530790"," One, two, right?"
"6531030","6533330"," One, two, three. "
"6533930","6535010"," Nice little squeeze up higher."
"6537230","6540850"," My thesis here is that we've got OpEx right coming up."
"6541030","6542530"," We've got end of month coming up. "
"6542550","6544330"," We're going to have new monthly flows coming up."
"6544750","6546490"," There's a window of weakness in here."
"6546630","6550210"," This is your, so the top side of this, you got a call wall at 1400, right?"
"6551310","6554170"," This was acting as a pin last week, right?"
"6555350","6556790"," So we pinned to it up. "
"6557550","6559830"," Support of flows, boom, boom."
"6561130","6570590"," Now as the week progresses, we have a gamma that's keeping us pinned to this 1400, okay?"
"6571450","6575850"," Now that gamma is falling off every day into Friday."
"6576850","6578210"," That pin, right?"
"6578450","6583290"," That pin action, the price pin is falling off as the week progresses. "
"6584450","6587670"," Now this is also a moment of weakness in the market, right?"
"6588310","6589990"," So we've got gamma rolling off here."
"6589990","6597790"," And we've got a little bit of a roll here that should be expected into the 17th, and possibly even"
"6597790","6600110"," into the 30th, the 31st."
"6600750","6602630"," The 17th is right here. "
"6603050","6608950"," I guess I'm being a little dramatic in the drawing here, but here's the 17th right here."
"6610210","6610650"," Right?"
"6610890","6616430"," The pin to 1400 is weak as we head into the 17th."
"6617050","6626030"," Then we have single ticker explorations for Q4 of 2023 that roll off"
"6626030","6628090"," on the 17th. "
"6628350","6632230"," And that leads into the end of the month over here."
"6633350","6638830"," Now, if we don't have new flows until the first week of the next month, we start to lose a"
"6638830","6641810"," little bit more of that pin and there's some blood that could be anticipated."
"6642670","6649770"," Some of these bears are looking for a big downside move as time passes, due to all that gamma"
"6649770","6651170"," falling off the marketplace. "
"6651590","6654130"," I think Jim has addressed this as well."
"6655150","6660470"," I think he said something about, I think he said it back in October or September of last year."
"6661030","6668210"," He was saying that we shouldn't see weakness in the stock market of any significance or even a"
"6668210","6674250"," possibility of it until I believe the January 17th op-x. "
"6674530","6676030"," Not does it mean we go down to the depth of hell?"
"6676210","6676390"," No."
"6677390","6683850"," There's no guarantee that does, but there is a moment of weakness in here where it's possible that"
"6683850","6684730"," it can take place."
"6685770","6689750"," And that's where this lies right here is if we get underneath this gamma flip. "
"6689950","6692890"," So if you look at this gamma flip down here, right?"
"6693510","6694350"," It's okay."
"6694570","6697790"," The point here is it's okay if we're a little bit weak in there."
"6698170","6700390"," We just don't want to get underneath this gamma flip. "
"6700390","6701870"," That's 11.38 and the gamma flip."
"6702030","6705150"," We start to reject $3 million in three month bills."
"6705590","6706330"," Private yield. "
"6706550","6706950"," Sell the market."
"6707950","6709630"," CTA is private cover."
"6709790","6712930"," We'll begin to sell their positions below here. "
"6712990","6719070"," The US sells $68 billion in six month bills prior high yield of five spot zero three percent in a"
"6719070","6721290"," private cover of three spot zero six."
"6722570","6724650"," And I'll read this to you this morning."
"6726730","6728310"," This isn't doom and gloom or anything. "
"6728630","6733610"," It's just a matter of understanding the pin that's in the market right now."
"6733730","6734910"," So let me read some of this to you again."
"6735670","6737250"," I'll read this to you one more time here. "
"6741090","6746590"," Feds Wellness says a strong economy gives the Fed flexibility to move methodically with uncuts."
"6751350","6757950"," Implied SPX dealer Gemma is running at $550 million currently, but we'll get slashed down in the"
"6757950","6762970"," coming days and the timing of cuts will be up to deliberations of the Federal Open Market"
"6762970","6763390"," Committee."
"6769590","6771850"," All else equals options expire. "
"6772390","6774150"," Think we need to move rates down faster."
"6774750","6775110"," We can."
"6798110","6799310"," It's a Tuesday. "
"6800630","6805310"," We lose a minus 50 million on a notional."
"6806490","6816430"," We lose a minus 42 on Wednesday minus 20 on Thursday and minus 180 on Friday for a total"
"6816430","6818190"," of 290 million."
"6818770","6824570"," In English, that means dealer Gemma, the great stabilizer could get cut in half, which increases"
"6824570","6825370"," the risk. "
"6825370","6830950"," Of larger moves towards the end of the week, not necessarily down, just larger moves."
"6831910","6836050"," So this to build some adding more volatility to the market into the end of the week."
"6837590","6844910"," From a grandma strike standpoint, 4800 is a big resistance level that will only swell larger as we"
"6844910","6845910"," approach opx. "
"6846590","6852350"," Well, to the downside, there are no prominent support levels except a rather small gamma strike at"
"6852350","6854050"," 4775."
"6856150","6861130"," Below 74750, dealer Gemma will turn negative, which means there is not much room for error."
"6861810","6868490"," It would feel a lot more confident if we could achieve a solid pin at 4800 with an upside bias. "
"6869110","6875310"," So you want to see that pin into the end of the week into opx into the 17th."
"6875830","6881910"," Tomorrow, excuse me, into tomorrow for opx, and then even into the 30th, right, or 31st, I think"
"6881910","6885410"," there's 30, 30 days of this month."
"6885570","6890330"," So you want to see that like 4800, you want to be there or above it as a bull. "
"6890550","6895610"," You don't want to slip underneath the 4775 as the week progresses."
"6897490","6901990"," They are modeling that CTA is almost 100% long in SPX currently."
"6902350","6905570"," So not much firepower to expect from trend followers. "
"6906770","6909210"," So CTA is already long in this market."
"6909530","6910570"," They're not going to buy anymore."
"6911330","6916310"," You're not going to expect heavy buying coming in from them at this point. "
"6917190","6919750"," That seller is below 4775."
"6922850","6932630"," For 4750, below 4750, CTA will offload futures, which could then escalate in the region of 4650"

"6936470","6943930"," So these guys are even saying the same thing that I'm saying, not expecting too much downside here. "
"6944510","6949990"," As a matter of fact, I'm looking for a dip to buy down there at some point."
"6950070","6953730"," If we can get down there at all, looking for a dip to buy down there for a major run"

"7125560","7126440"," Still down."
"7126740","7131940"," Although some of the big tech firms still on the upside in video micron a and D having a great"
"7131940","7132220"," day."
"7132340","7132940"," We're trying to make sense. "
"7133120","7135640"," A lot of these bank earnings and it's been very difficult."
"7135660","7139840"," For example, Morgan Stanley, we have these special assessment to the FDIC."
"7139860","7142200"," That's changing the earnings picture on some of these. "
"7142200","7143620"," So it's a little confusing here."
"7143880","7149140"," But if you look here, Morgan Stanley is sort of one of the declineers on the S&P 500 Ted"
"7149140","7153240"," picks first earnings report as CEO revenues beat wealth management's the key."
"7153240","7156940"," These companies are about wealth management and then a little bit about capital markets and"
"7156940","7157180"," trading. "
"7157360","7158540"," But wealth management was the key."
"7158920","7164060"," But the trading operations underperformed both missed estimates that we tracked there."
"7164360","7167280"," Investment banking was a very, very small beat overall. "
"7167960","7169660"," So that's the story here for them."
"7169920","7173340"," And if you look at the one of the opposite story with Goldman Sachs and they're essentially in the"
"7173340","7173820"," same business."
"7174040","7179060"," Again, the big money center banks are about wealth management and capital markets and trading. "
"7179060","7181360"," Goldman, which poured a big, big beat here."
"7181700","7184840"," Global bank and markets were so a little bit of a dip in the quarter."
"7185340","7187420"," David Solomon was on the conference call this morning. "
"7187600","7191500"," He said he was hopeful that capital markets activity make a lot of money on this debt."
"7191500","7194200"," For example, an IPO business."
"7194600","7195860"," We're going to pick up on 2024. "
"7196120","7197240"," We'll see about that."
"7197420","7200260"," A little bit of a Hopium there on the IPO markets."
"7200300","7202220"," We've been waiting for this for a long, long time. "
"7202320","7202980"," It's still not happening."
"7203340","7206080"," It gets more intelligible when you get into regional banks."
"7206320","7208820"," I like regional banks more. "
"7208820","7212400"," With regional banks, it's a lot simpler overall here."
"7212600","7215040"," You're dealing with loan growth and credit quality."
"7215540","7220020"," And again here, the average loans for PNC were up 1.6%. Eh, that's fair, not great. "
"7220480","7222200"," Credit losses, though, well contained."
"7222560","7225920"," They're not dramatically increasing the provisions for credit losses."
"7226340","7228140"," So the two things that matter are fine. "
"7228460","7229640"," They're just not terribly exciting."
"7229980","7233420"," Loan growth isn't particularly astonishing in that business here."
"7233660","7234360"," They beat on the revenues. "
"7234760","7235300"," That's a good sign."
"7235480","7236560"," We want to keep an eye on these revenues."
"7236560","7238640"," Some of these companies are reporting lower revenues. "
"7239100","7241320"," That income was lower year over year."
"7241680","7243460"," But it was better than some people expected."
"7243860","7247940"," So it's a little hard parsing this in a simple way on the bank so far, Morgan. "
"7248260","7251620"," But I would say that loan growth has been fair, not great."
"7252040","7254160"," There's not a big increase for loan losses."
"7254320","7255140"," And overall, that's good. "
"7255500","7261340"," But trading activity has been flat to down overall for those big money center banks that we talk"
"7261340","7261620"," about."

"11322270","11327350"," If you're a bull that there's that magnet's not as strong as it was."
"11327350","11333490"," And you can also see some some manipulation that goes on leading into op X as well."
"11333790","11338590"," Either a huge upside move and then we come back down or a huge downside move and we come back"
"11338590","11340350"," up into actual op X."
"11341150","11343190"," And these are big banks that are trying to park. "
"11343430","11344310"," These guys are out."

"11352550","11353410"," The demand is fake. "
"11353710","11355090"," The price of everything is fake."
"11355090","11360030"," And that has a lot to do sometimes with the manipulation that goes on to print what these large"
"11360030","11363530"," banks want to print into these end of month scenarios."
"11364270","11368090"," So right now this price action is not shocking to me. "
"11368750","11371410"," This bouncing around is not shocking to me."
"11371490","11373790"," It's not phasing me in any way shape or form."
"11374390","11384330"," If you were a condor or a fly seller or buyer and you're like we're range bound from this point"
"11384330","11386370"," to this point over here to an extent. "
"11386670","11391330"," Even if we get a momentary outside outside move or a momentary downside move."
"11391830","11398190"," There's an idea that there's a range that the market is trying to steer into for op X and then"
"11398190","11402330"," for the to some extent end of month as well."
"11402330","11408130"," So I was coming into this morning thinking to myself it's not going to be a lot to do today. "
"11408930","11418930"," We're going to likely be range bound and drift down into the 17th and possibly even the 30th or"
"11418930","11419750"," 31st."
"11420130","11422470"," So this doesn't really surprise me here."
"11422930","11428590"," And to further that point tomorrow is the 17th right. "
"11428590","11434310"," So what are your expectations if you're a bull out there and you're like we're going to 5000"
"11434310","11435010"," tomorrow."
"11436250","11438890"," Into into op X probably not."
"11439750","11445070"," We're going to 4600 tomorrow in op X probably not for where we are. "
"11445450","11449030"," And just zooming out a little bit right let's zoom out a little bit."
"11449250","11450610"," Let me see if I can bring something up here."
"11452490","11457390"," Can I bring up Webull here this is an easier way to bring stuff up here. "
"11458050","11461650"," So just on let's go over to a Webull really quick."
"11462950","11465390"," And that's just a 30 minute chart right."
"11466270","11467850"," I want you to think about this. "
"11469250","11472530"," In terms of if you're a big bank right."
"11473490","11475990"," And where are you bringing stuff right."
"11476590","11481550"," So what's your expectation right we're coming into the first of the year down here right change the"
"11481550","11482130"," color down here. "
"11482930","11488790"," And let's say you're a commercial trader your commercial trader and you go along the market."
"11489090","11491530"," So we blast up here right."
"11493130","11497970"," And what happens we hit this top right here now we're coming into this monthly op X and what do"
"11497970","11498650"," you see here. "
"11498790","11501710"," You see this like parking action does that make any sense."
"11501710","11506270"," You're like you're like getting your prints over here and you're possibly even getting your prints"
"11506270","11507010"," over here."
"11507890","11509750"," Right for this first month. "
"11510550","11514550"," Now this can go up of course right we can go up there and tag that."
"11515050","11519310"," We can go up there and tag that 40 that the new all time high up here on S P"
"11519310","11522330"," X if you want to say yeah we can possibly do that to cap."
"11522570","11527490"," But there's basically like a pinning action is my point in the market here. "
"11527490","11530490"," And we're kind of like kind of drag and ask down here right."
"11530490","11532550"," So come into the 17th."
"11532950","11538790"," We know that the unclench happens as we get closer to the 17th and then single ticker or single"
"11538790","11539410"," tickers. "
"11539410","11542250"," These guys that bought down here remember these guys right."
"11542870","11546890"," They bought this stuff and they're monetizing that trade right."
"11547550","11547570"," Right. "
"11548630","11549890"," And if you're a bull."
"11551490","11554030"," And you're like well where these guys over here."
"11554970","11557230"," These are real money buyers right. "
"11557430","11558390"," This is real money."
"11558550","11560550"," This is the market moving money."
"11561490","11564130"," When you have real money buying and real money selling. "
"11564910","11569330"," They will overrun retailers dealers you name it."
"11569630","11570010"," Okay."
"11570490","11573190"," They push the market around when they're out of the market. "
"11573270","11574690"," The market is free."
"11575690","11581930"," For retail trainers for dealers to move the market where they want it to move when they're not no"
"11581930","11583750"," longer active right up in here."
"11584370","11584810"," Right. "
"11584850","11587390"," So you can kind of get some manipulation going on in here."
"11587990","11591430"," Now if you were these guys down here that we're buying."
"11592030","11595990"," Where do you think they want to buy if you were to speak to somebody that thousand bucks in their"
"11595990","11596290"," bank. "
"11596770","11600770"," They're going to tell you well they bought here cap and they're going to want to buy it right here."
"11601310","11603810"," They don't want about by forty eight hundred and head higher."
"11603810","11605390"," But that's not really the case. "
"11605990","11610690"," The case is they're going to buy this shit up here get their print and then look for a better"
"11610690","11612830"," price to buy right."
"11612830","11613570"," Buy that."
"11613930","11614350"," Buy that. "
"11615170","11615610"," Right."
"11615750","11616830"," For this next leg up."
"11616990","11618370"," That's actually how the market moves. "
"11618610","11621650"," The market does not move straight up does not move straight down."
"11622270","11622710"," Generally."
"11622990","11623850"," Sometimes it does. "
"11624170","11629650"," But if you get a bank that's like we're going to do leverage ourselves right now and every of the"
"11629650","11630210"," banks in the fall."
"11630290","11632110"," Sure we can go straight to the bottom."
"11632330","11635250"," But look at that from this perspective a bank buys here. "
"11635650","11636850"," They get a print up here."
"11637190","11639690"," Where do they want to buy their next buy up here."
"11640450","11641330"," Likely not. "
"11641330","11644770"," They probably want to buy something down here again."
"11645170","11647650"," If they're still feeling a little frisky and bullish."
"11648390","11649970"," Or more upside to come. "
"11650470","11652070"," Now there is another problem here."
"11652510","11653630"," That's the SPX."
"11656050","11659850"," The SPX pin at five thousand right. "
"11660470","11664230"," Everyone's like well we're going to go to that five thousand now or not right."
"11664450","11666170"," Are we going to do it in the beginning and then roll down."
"11666890","11670390"," Are we going to save up for the end and then roll up into five thousand. "
"11671110","11674270"," At least right now from a historical perspective."
"11674410","11675870"," Let's look at that and see."
"11676270","11677270"," Let's take a look at. "
"11677450","11679290"," Let me see if I can bring that up for you right now."
"11679970","11681690"," It was down earlier I believe."
"11681890","11682190"," Let me see. "
"11684070","11684630"," Hold on."
"11684730","11685990"," Let me see if I can get this up for you."
"11689770","11690610"," This one. "
"11691030","11691250"," No."
"11691710","11692510"," This one maybe."
"11693530","11694170"," This one. "
"11694550","11695030"," This one."
"11695830","11695850"," Here."
"11697190","11699350"," Let me take a look at this really quick. "
"11699650","11703270"," This is my screener here for SPX seasonality right."
"11703790","11704270"," CPC."
"11704790","11707190"," Holds crude loading and mid storm alerts. "
"11707890","11709330"," And you can see the real."
"11709970","11713030"," You can see the green line is actually how we're training versus."
"11714350","11716950"," Price in seasonality of SPX right. "
"11717090","11719690"," You've got this nice little push up right here right."
"11719930","11720910"," We tagged that already."
"11720910","11726450"," And then a consolidation phase down for the actual big move higher. "
"11727090","11727490"," Right."
"11727690","11730230"," So you got the initial buying by CTAs."
"11730390","11730750"," Fuck yeah. "
"11730970","11731630"," Made some money."
"11732170","11732470"," Right."
"11732530","11736270"," Now we're going to come back in here and grab a nice dip to make that next run up. "
"11736430","11737150"," Does that make sense?"
"11737650","11740270"," So you get the initial buy in for the beginning of the quarter."
"11740450","11741330"," They made some money."
"11741450","11741930"," We pull back. "
"11742390","11745090"," Let me come back up here and have a kick ass kick ass."
"11746490","11749430"," Returns by some of these companies that are reporting."
"11749610","11753530"," Then we have a seasonal low that we're looking for down below. "
"11754050","11755990"," Now it doesn't mean we actually trade this."
"11756010","11760330"," We can trade like an outsized down move and outsized up move."
"11760830","11761690"," That kind of stuff. "
"11761930","11763450"," But we still tend to."
"11764410","11767570"," It's tend to follow that over time."
"11767730","11768350"," Does that make sense?"
"11768990","11770350"," Even if this is a bloodbath. "
"11770410","11772330"," Even if this isn't as high as we expected."
"11772330","11776630"," So there is some expectation that we're somewhat going to follow this stuff."
"11777130","11781390"," So right now just looking at the chart for seasonality. "
"11781970","11782830"," We are in line."
"11783090","11784530"," Do we have to follow this exactly?"
"11785230","11785350"," No."
"11786430","11787070"," We don't. "
"11787310","11788650"," And we don't."
"11788650","11792690"," Something like terrible happens to start cutting rates and we're blasting down over there."
"11792830","11793030"," Sure. "
"11793770","11797830"," If sentiment becomes something we just start grinding straight up over the year."
"11798410","11799990"," Everybody knows we're never going to cut rates."
"11800810","11800850"," Right. "
"11800850","11801950"," We're just going to blast off."
"11802070","11802170"," Sure."
"11802310","11802890"," That can happen. "
"11803090","11809410"," But generally speaking right now we're kind of following what the expectation was in here."
"11809630","11809770"," Right."
"11810470","11812770"," You get this down movement right here. "
"11812830","11814610"," This is going to be about the 17th."
"11814630","11815050"," That's tomorrow."
"11815810","11816150"," Right. "
"11816370","11816930"," A low."
"11817310","11818150"," Then another bump up."
"11818170","11821450"," And then one more capitulation move down into the end of the month. "
"11822090","11823270"," Into the 30th."
"11823610","11823790"," Okay."
"11824110","11826470"," So just kind of keep this in mind here. "
"11827210","11831010"," That this is potentially a similar path that we're going to run."
"11831970","11833270"," In these next few days."
"11833510","11835230"," And you're likely going to see. "
"11835650","11837890"," I'm going to show you N.D.X. as well."
"11838470","11839590"," In a moment here."
"11839670","11842870"," I'm going to show you the N.D.X. seasonality because it's a little bit cleaner. "
"11843150","11843810"," It's a little bit more."
"11844970","11845030"," Flat."
"11845590","11847550"," A little bit more flat in here. "
"11847590","11848570"," And then you get your move."
"11849290","11850030"," I made a."
"11850270","11853430"," I made a proclamation to you last week."
"11853430","11853930"," I said. "
"11854310","11858190"," You're likely going to see bulls just pitch and moan for like two weeks."
"11858630","11859490"," Just wine."
"11859890","11860110"," Wine. "
"11860430","11860630"," Wine."
"11860930","11861270"," Wine."
"11861350","11861550"," Wine. "
"11861730","11862470"," Bitch and moan."
"11862930","11863770"," But it's going up."
"11863890","11868550"," They might not see the downside move that the bears are expecting. "
"11868750","11870870"," And then eventually it moves and they go, look, I was right."
"11871030","11871470"," You were wrong."
"11871590","11872470"," The bears were wrong. "
"11873210","11874790"," But we're still in this way."
"11874910","11879010"," We're still in this like sideways and down phase."
"11879010","11884430"," Let me see if they can bring up N.D.X. here and just show you the same thing. "
"11884630","11884710"," Right?"
"11885050","11886470"," So you've got N.D.X. here."
"11887750","11889010"," Not really doubt."
"11889610","11890710"," Not not performing. "
"11891710","11899530"," But then a squeeze towards the 17 or the 19th trading day of the year here for N.D.X."
"11900190","11901490"," So we get the 19th trading day."
"11901670","11901810"," Hold on."
"11901910","11910430"," Take a look at that. "
"11910430","11915070"," N.D.X. is the 29th of January."
"11916350","11918490"," So this is the 29th of January."
"11919350","11925750"," So you'd see NASDAQ outperform before you see SPX outperform. "
"11926750","11930850"," SPX might not be until the 30th where you get that push up higher."
"11932110","11937190"," And you might not see like awesome sauce in NASDAQ."
"11937190","11940910"," More consolidated price action, right?"
"11941350","11943750"," So it's not necessarily super bearish. "
"11944150","11951590"," But it's also not necessarily bullish either for this next couple of weeks."
"11952050","11956990"," So if you are bull out there, right?"
"11957950","11961270"," You're probably waiting to the end of the month to get a nice dip buy."
"11961530","11965450"," Could you buy a dip right now on an index level?"
"11965450","11966030"," Probably. "
"11967290","11971610"," But on an individual ticker level, can you buy a dip right now?"
"11972090","11974430"," More than likely not, right?"
"11974630","11978430"," You're seeing right now specifically Tesla getting whacked, right?"
"11978990","11984050"," So they're cutting some of these stocks for a dip buy down the road."
"11984610","11992790"," So if you're bull and you're trading individual tickers, you might be waiting to enter those closer"
"11992790","11993810"," to the end of the month."
"11994770","11995550"," Makes sense?"
"11996190","12002110"," And then if you are an index buyer, yeah, you could probably find any of these lows. "
"12002450","12009270"," And at some point in the month of February, middle February, you're likely going to get a print on"
"12009270","12009790"," that trade."
"12011330","12017130"," So the index probably not as worried, but like individual tickers, you could see that trimming of"
"12017130","12021190"," the wick on those tickers where it does matter, right?"
"12021190","12026310"," The index you might not see it as glaring, but on the individual ticker side, it might be glaring"
"12026310","12028750"," where that dip buy is."
"12028970","12033210"," For any of you that are trying to top tick and bottom tick, you're not a buyer here. "
"12033450","12034410"," Are you so far?"
"12035130","12039350"," We are following seasonality right now until we're proven wrong."
"12039630","12044930"," Otherwise, we're basically following seasonality for this year."
"12045050","12050430"," The expectations of what's going to happen this year based on rates and based upon the election"
"12050430","12051670"," season that we're in. "
"12054680","12060340"," So even this weakness right now that you're seeing, even in this moment, this weakness, is it"
"12060340","12061600"," really that doom and gloom?"
"12062020","12063300"," In my view, it isn't."
"12064200","12071260"," And even my put spread is not like 460 or 450 or 430 or any kind of insanity like that,"
"12071520","12071860"," 4200."
"12072860","12075300"," Now, I'll say this to to you. "
"12075760","12083240"," If we have that dip buy and we do go up and slam into 48 or 5000, what am I"
"12083240","12083940"," going to do then?"
"12084940","12087940"," I'm going to tell you to sell the fucking market, right?"
"12088060","12094640"," So if we follow that seasonality, right, we have that nice dip buy, we can buy something, we head"
"12094640","12101260"," on up, we trade all-time highs and SPX for even 5000, what am I going to tell you then?"
"12102040","12103560"," You know what I'm going to tell you, right?"
"12104460","12105480"," Sell the fucking market."
"12106180","12109380"," I'm still proving otherwise, sell the fucking market."
"12109880","12112560"," That put spread's not going to beat a 4700. "
"12112920","12120600"," That put spread's probably going to beat a 4300, 42 or 4100 for a seasonal low, for an actual"
"12120600","12123300"," seasonal low in the middle of March."
"12124260","12128560"," Now, if we do something wacky or crazy outside of the norm, sure, I'll do something different."
"12129480","12130700"," I'll chase price anywhere. "
"12131080","12136180"," But at the same time, even this right now, when you're out there, if you're out there, bullbear, I"
"12136180","12143980"," don't care, respect some of this to an extent until we start to do something different than we are"
"12143980","12145820"," acting right now."
"12146040","12150020"," We are following some kind of a seasonal pattern right now."
"12150380","12151640"," Do you guys disagree with this?"
"12152600","12157540"," Because the actual facts are stating that we're following that right now. "
"12160740","12162540"," You guys get what I'm saying at least?"
"12166190","12170370"," I know there's a lot of people out there that are fighting this."
"12172190","12173930"," And it's been happening."
"12174650","12175450"," So I don't know. "
"12175590","12176290"," You all losing?"
"12176850","12182310"," Or are you just like, like I got like bears out there on social media saying one thing, a bull"
"12182310","12183370"," saying another thing."
"12183890","12186150"," And yet we're just following this track pretty closely."
"12186810","12188390"," It's not too far off. "
"12188390","12189070"," Is it?"
"12189390","12191090"," It's not showing here that it is."
"12193430","12194630"," Do you guys get that?"
"12194930","12197270"," So even this week, what are your expectations?"
"12198510","12202910"," Look yourself in a mirror this week and ask yourself, what are your expectations?"
"12204670","12204810"," Okay."
"12204990","12209970"," If you like zoom out a little bit from a one minute chart, a five minute chart, even a 15"
"12209970","12213530"," minute chart, just zoom back a little bit on a daily chart. "
"12214050","12217410"," And we're kind of looking, you know, consolidative."
"12218150","12219850"," That's what we're looking like right now."
"12220350","12224090"," And until we see something different, that's what I'm going to call it as. "
"12226370","12227270"," Yeah, agreed."
"12227910","12228230"," All right."
"12228530","12230010"," So you guys at least see what I'm seeing, right?"
"12236210","12236690"," Yeah. "
"12236870","12238990"," I mean, I'm not saying we can't trade out of that."
"12239090","12241850"," I'm just saying that everything right now looks like."
"12243110","12244750"," It looks consolidative. "
"12245350","12249210"," It looks like we're not blasting through 1400 at the moment."
"12250970","12253730"," It doesn't look like we're crashing either, does it?"
"12253870","12256470"," Just looks like consolidation parking the bus."
"12257690","12262070"," So far at least into the end of the month. "
"12266070","12266650"," Cool, cool."
"12266850","12269230"," I just want to make sure you guys are all same page so far."
"12270290","12272470"," I wouldn't have high expectations for a crash. "
"12272710","12279650"," I wouldn't have expectations for 40 fucking 900 like this week or next week."
"12279650","12280190"," It's possible."
"12280270","12281550"," We get about 4800. "
"12282210","12282990"," I'm with you."
"12283190","12284190"," Well, I'll chase it with you."
"12296720","12297820"," So I don't know. "
"12297960","12298980"," I don't know what to say to you guys."
"12301120","12304420"," I'd expect more of this is my point."
"12304760","12307380"," Expect more of this like grind bullshit sideways. "
"12307380","12310500"," Sell 4800 by 4700."
"12310640","12311780"," Sell 4800."
"12312200","12316120"," Sell 47 or even around there, 4750. "
"12317980","12321580"," They know that they don't want us below this gamma flip, right?"
"12323020","12324640"," So 4750 by a dip."
"12324920","12326360"," 4800 you saw the fucking rip."
"12327300","12332260"," If we get underneath this gamma flip, there's no, then this is another point here to make to you. "
"12333120","12335220"," We've talked about this in the past as well."
"12335220","12336760"," Even we break below it."
"12337040","12339000"," I'm going to show you this instance right here. "
"12339660","12343200"," We actually did break below the gamma flip, but we didn't confirm it."
"12343320","12343620"," Did we?"
"12344060","12346020"," That's like a rejection right here."
"12346080","12347500"," Another rejection right here. "
"12347560","12349340"," Break down below the previous low."
"12349740","12351560"," We always talk about that, right?"
"12352240","12354380"," It's not good enough that you break the gamma flip."
"12354380","12355260"," You have to break it. "
"12356020","12362400"," Reject and then get underneath this prior low below the gamma flip to start to get your bear."
"12364620","12367160"," We're selling every rip until that happens."
"12368620","12371260"," All this action here just looks like consolidation. "
"12374260","12377700"," So if I even myself, I've got put spreads here."
"12378680","12383580"," I'm just looking to if we trade 4700 for a minute, I'm going to monetize it and I'm out."
"12383960","12384940"," I'm not bearish. "
"12385900","12390820"," I get more bearish if we started to reject that 4700."
"12390820","12394640"," But outside of that, not expecting too much here."
"12395340","12397520"," We're kind of following that right now. "
"12398420","12402100"," There's not much to say on that other than that."
"12406850","12409570"," And it does make sense for NVIDIA to be going up."
"12409730","12410470"," I mean, monetizing. "
"12410690","12415090"," You're monetizing individual tickers right into OpEx, right?"
"12415310","12418390"," So individual tickers are monetizing it, looking for a pullback."
"12418390","12422590"," So let's say NVIDIA, they monetizing their calls at NVIDIA."
"12423230","12424230"," You know what happens, right?"
"12424410","12426310"," They have a pullback so they can re-enter again. "
"12427890","12429750"," So that doesn't shock me either."
"12430150","12435530"," The rotation effect that's going on in individual tickers doesn't shock me either."
"12444120","12444640"," Camille. "
"12445800","12446980"," I love you, Camille."
"12447580","12448240"," I want you to know that."
"12449920","12452360"," Camille's always like Johnny on the spot in the comments. "
"12453320","12457020"," Okay, you guys all understand that?"
"12458520","12460400"," So not too much to look at here."
"12461000","12465660"," If you're a bear, you really need to get underneath the, feel like full bear."
"12466120","12467940"," Like full crash bear, unclenching. "
"12468460","12473280"," You got to get underneath that fucking 4750 and then start rejecting it right there."
"12473460","12474500"," Like make it look bearish."
"12478670","12481310"," Yeah, Hagerty knows Hagerty's like ping pong, baby. "
"12483030","12486010"," It's like fucking Paris Hilton with the ping pong balls."
"12495210","12496510"," Okay, that's all I got for you guys."
"12496610","12498830"," I got to get back to a call really quickly back in a few moments. "
"12503660","12509860"," I know, dude, that's what I'm telling you."
"12509860","12510500"," Easy peasy."
"12511120","12512320"," Easy peasy. "
"12544680","12547800"," Camille, give me five minutes as soon as I'm off this call brother."
"12547800","12548960"," I'll address it by man."
"12560420","12564400"," By the way, Camille, yes, I do think it impacts brother. "
"12565600","12568400"," I asked that question on Twitter a week ago, I think."
"12570240","12572900"," Does anybody know what Camille is asking about?"
"12573560","12580500"," Camille wants to know if we're running QE in the background without telling anybody publicly."
"12581300","12586740"," Camille, that could introduce that straight line up brother. "
"12588160","12588880"," That's that."
"12589240","12591600"," We'll talk about it more depth again later."
"12592420","12594180"," Give me like 15 minutes, half an hour. "
"12594700","12596580"," We'll address QRA."
"12596980","12599000"," Many of you guys don't know what Camille is talking about."
"12599100","12603640"," It's basically are we running QE and are they going to make it or is it going to become more"
"12603640","12604000"," public?"
"12605180","12608960"," That would set up that real that would set up like a like a 2020. "
"12610460","12612960"," Straight line fucking straight up."
"12613280","12614520"," We'll talk about that."
"12614660","12617240"," That could impact sentiment as well. "
"13554950","13558210"," Shortly expecting results from the Fed reverse repo facility."
"13606900","13608200"," So 65 counterparties."
"13609280","13614380"," They're taking just 583 spot one zero three billion dollars at the Fed's reverse repo operation. "
"13638000","13642040"," Do you want to say up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news for"
"13642040","13642300"," nine?"
"13643140","13648120"," If you want to say up to date and get our special offer or financial use pro for years worth"
"13648120","13652420"," of our service for the price of one month and say 92%."
"14276980","14283800"," So seeing the EIA's rig productivity reports as they forecast a new well oil production per rig at"
"14283800","14285780"," 1842."
"14285780","14286660"," So we'll take a few bars per day for backing. "
"14289100","14291120"," Which is up from the month they go reports."
"14291680","14292780"," That's 1,346."
"14293340","14299140"," Bows per day for Permian, which is also up from the prior reports and her 1,634. "
"14299560","14303660"," Bows per day for Eagle Ford, which is also up from the month they go reports."
"14304260","14306160"," We'll post the headlines of the forebreak down shortly."
"14398620","14399680"," All right, there. "
"14399980","14401280"," What do we have going on over here?"
"14401520","14404480"," Did I not put the, uh, I muted her?"
"14406080","14409180"," Uh, so I've got some, I've got a note here."
"14411080","14415060"," Now, this is not me, by the way, just in here, I want you to see what this is going"
"14415060","14415060"," on over here."
"14415060","14418140"," This note says right here was emailed to me. "
"14418260","14425980"," It says, uh, Nomura, strategist, Charles, Miguel, or Miguel got, I've always pronounced his name"
"14425980","14431660"," wrong, but Charles Miguel got came up with a, I always want to call him Miguel for some reason."
"14432300","14437260"," Uh, came up with a sort of interesting thesis today that could open the door for a massive bull"
"14437260","14439120"," running goes something like this."
"14439120","14448240"," Uh, number one consensus expects a resumption of coupon issuance increases, potentially sending"
"14448240","14451020"," UST's lower long end yields higher. "
"14452100","14458380"," Yellen disrupts that thinking by issuing less notes, more bills to help the Dems win the election."
"14459380","14466820"," Number three, money market funds by those bills versus keeping cash at RRP, which forces the Fed to"
"14466820","14471580"," end QT sooner than expected, which acts"
"14471580","14488360"," as"
"14488360","14488360"," a second round effect."
"14488360","14497020"," You're going to not cut rates or cut rates, but, um, but end QT first, right?"
"14497160","14498480"," You'd first end QT. "
"14499060","14505320"," Um, then you would be, oh, then you would be allowed to do great cuts, but not before ending QT."
"14505620","14509680"," If you don't end QT and you do great cuts bad for the market."
"14509680","14509960"," Okay. "
"14510720","14516420"," Um, now if you, now you get 7500 BPS rate cuts in a place where you have to risk of"
"14516420","14519880"," a hard landing deficit spending remains in place."
"14520720","14526540"," And the result is that stocks go parabolic to the upside."
"14526740","14528560"," Now, this is, this is like a."
"14530380","14534800"," This is like a very small potential of this happening. "
"14535040","14538700"," We're talking a very small percentage, like 15% chance of this happening, but."
"14538700","14544100"," Uh, it does rest upon the quarterly refunding announcement."
"14545080","14547440"," It's coming up in the end of January. "
"14547760","14549820"," I think it doesn't happen until February."
"14550000","14551080"," I could be wrong on this."
"14551800","14556040"," I thought someone on social said January 29. "
"14556860","14562580"," Gave that as a date, but, um, I think it's the first week of February."
"14563000","14563980"," Now, this is going."
"14564240","14565400"," This is the key point here. "
"14565400","14568160"," This is what Kamel was asking earlier."
"14569660","14570660"," Uh, is he here right now?"
"14571100","14573940"," So Kamel, if you're out there, this is geared towards you."
"14574600","14581320"," Uh, you want to know what that quarterly refunding announcement or he asked about QRA earlier. "
"14581940","14584320"," I'm assuming this is the QRA that he was asking about."
"14584460","14588680"," There's some other QRA's out there, but this is the one that we've discussed here in the show and"
"14588680","14589080"," on Twitter."
"14589820","14593920"," Uh, in the past, and this is the one where you really want to see if this takes place. "
"14593920","14598660"," Uh, I don't have a hard data when that data is released."
"14599180","14600920"," I think it's first week of February."
"14601660","14606600"," Uh, but someone on Twitter last week said the January 29 we should get that data. "
"14607780","14609820"," Keep this in mind right here."
"14610000","14610360"," Now."
"14611200","14614060"," I wouldn't be trading on this, but. "
"14614800","14616440"," It is this like."
"14617120","14621020"," If you were looking for rate cuts to be positive for the market."
"14622520","14624800"," This, this would be a path to that. "
"14625820","14632780"," Um, even if they don't cut rates, just if they take this path, this would be bullish on the market,"
"14632780","14635200"," but the parabolic part."
"14635780","14638160"," Uh, could be the rate cuts as well."
"14638160","14639280"," If you threw that in there. "
"14640480","14641800"," It would be insane."
"14641900","14643580"," So think of it like this."
"14644220","14645780"," If you want a simplified version of this. "
"14647540","14649500"," Whatever they cut rates, you have the usually."
"14651020","14656980"," Markets already blasting down, then they announced rate cuts, then they announced a QE."
"14657300","14661440"," So you're talking about doing this process in reverse, basically. "
"14662260","14664320"," Uh, you, you announced the end of QT."
"14664500","14667540"," You'd introduce QE or admit to it."
"14668140","14670600"," Uh, and then you would cut rates after, right?"
"14670840","14672980"," So you do this in a, in a reverse order. "
"14673800","14676420"," Now, how much weight do I put on this happening?"
"14676980","14677500"," Not too much."
"14678300","14684060"," Uh, but it is that it's this, it's, I probably give it the same, uh, the same."
"14685120","14691180"," Probability that I would give, uh, bears out there telling you the market is going to crash. "
"14691980","14695440"," Uh, for all these economic reasons are macro reasons."
"14695560","14698060"," And I'm just like, you're out of your fucking mind."
"14698100","14699340"," We haven't done two percent yet. "
"14699340","14701200"," We haven't stopped raising rates."
"14701200","14702200"," We haven't cut rates."
"14703180","14704680"," Unemployment's not where it's supposed to be. "
"14704920","14706300"," Jobs isn't where it's supposed to be."
"14706680","14709160"," We don't have any velocity and inflation right now."
"14709380","14714420"," So, uh, all those, like, I need all those things to happen or I need an event. "
"14715340","14716480"," You know, I need an event."
"14716680","14721580"," I need like a, um, I need like something that's not literally not priced into the market."
"14721980","14723820"," Uh, this would be one of those things. "
"14724460","14728880"," So, uh, we'll try to get a, we'll try."
"14728880","14734220"," We'll try to get, uh, I think this QRA though is happening in February."
"14734840","14738860"," So, uh, I'll try to do a Google search and find out when it's going to take place. "
"14739120","14745640"," Now, if that does happen, if this were to set itself up, you're talking about violence to the"
"14745640","14747300"," upside, like straight violence."
"14747500","14752660"," We'll have major pullbacks when they, when things like this, what I'm showing you down here happen."
"14753780","14755900"," Uh, stuff, when stuff like this happens. "
"14755900","14764220"," Uh, you will still get corrective, uh, like corrective moves, but you're talking about, you're"
"14764220","14766820"," talking about something that might look like this."
"14767760","14769640"," You know, something like that."
"14769880","14772040"," Maybe another nice pullback and then something like that. "
"14772620","14775240"," Turning into something like this."
"14776220","14779440"," You know, just like violence and moves to the upside."
"14780080","14785100"," You'll still get those corrections, but in no way shape or form doesn't look like this, right?"
"14785100","14791400"," Over time, it's like straight the fuck up into the end of the year or even into March or something"
"14791400","14791980"," like that. "
"14792720","14796740"," Uh, so that this is basically that right there."
"14797340","14804580"," If they left rates on and didn't cut them into the end of the year, you should expect something"
"14804580","14805840"," like that right there."
"14806080","14810920"," If at any point you see rate cuts, you're going to expect some blood down there or blood down here"
"14810920","14815240"," or blood down there without the QE and all that kind of stuff. "
"14816260","14817860"," Uh, so this is fascinating."
"14818300","14820560"," It's still not proven yet."
"14821000","14824520"," Um, it's still not guaranteed yet. "
"14824600","14825440"," It's still not proven."
"14826340","14829300"," Uh, there's no reason to trade this at this moment."
"14830200","14833380"," Um, in any way, shape or form, but it's there. "
"14833820","14837120"," It's, it's, it's something that not a lot of people."
"14837120","14842660"," Everybody talks about rate cuts and what they think the impact is, but not a lot of people are"
"14842660","14843020"," talking about."
"14843140","14848460"," That's a few guys out there that I saw that were talking about it last week. "
"14849100","14855700"," Uh, but that's, that's that, that's that Q, uh, QRA that, uh, Camille was asking about."
"14856160","14856680"," Yeah."
"14856860","14858260"," So Camille, that's what you're saying now. "
"14858380","14861100"," He's saying January 29th, the 31st."
"14862120","14866760"," Uh, so if I would be a very interested in that as well, Camille."
"14866760","14870600"," I am, I am interested in what that news is as well. "
"14871180","14873140"," Uh, it is a matter of fact, how about this?"
"14873300","14874080"," The next couple of seconds."
"14874240","14875340"," Let me look something up for you guys."
"14875440","14876460"," I want to show you guys something else. "
"14877120","14883420"," I posted a, um, I made a post this weekend where I said QE."
"14884100","14886240"," I titled the post QE, right?"
"14887260","14893820"," And, uh, it was, it was the loaning of money to hedge funds from banks."
"14895600","14898800"," And, uh, I'm going to try to find this for you right now. "
"14898800","14899900"," See if they can find this."
"14901340","14908860"," And it was all along that same, um, it was along that same, the same thinking."
"14909920","14912080"," So you can find this guy really quick here. "
"14912560","14913100"," Oh, my name is."
"14914800","14917220"," He made, now this guy, I don't follow him."
"14917360","14918620"," I don't know a lot about him. "
"14918820","14920760"," I'm going to be fully honest with you."
"14920760","14921800"," I don't know this guy."
"14922380","14925820"," I'm not a long time follower of his or anything like that. "
"14925900","14927100"," I can't bounce for him."
"14927500","14930160"," I'm not, I'm not saying he's a bad guy or whatever."
"14930220","14931120"," I have nothing. "
"14931480","14932580"," No take on this guy."
"14933780","14938480"," Uh, but this guy here, I watched, I was someone said, can you watch this video?"
"14939140","14940060"," And I did."
"14941320","14944360"," And, uh, I'm going to pull it up for you right now. "
"14945480","14950720"," And see, um, I don't know when he made this video."
"14952140","14953640"," I'm just going to find it here."
"14954520","14959740"," Do I have a history of watching this video here or do I hold on?"
"14962380","14963940"," This might be it. "
"14965320","14966420"," I might have found it."
"14967840","14968740"," Let me see."
"14976980","14978100"," Give me a couple seconds. "
"14978340","14982420"," I'm going to watch this in the background here and see if I can check to see if this is"
"14982420","14982760"," right."
"14992900","14997480"," The guy's name is George Gammon."
"14997620","14998480"," I asked about him. "
"14999280","15001800"," I asked about him last week."
"15002800","15003840"," I think he made a video."
"15004320","15006080"," I don't know if this is the video or not. "
"15007360","15008600"," Let me see here."
"15018610","15021350"," Now this guy does a lot of what it looks like."
"15030030","15035250"," The fed stealth QE will trigger a stock market boom factor fish fiction. "
"15035610","15037110"," I think this is it."
"15037550","15038910"," Don't hold me to this."
"15039910","15042070"," But I think this is this guy's video. "
"15042630","15046050"," Now, whether it's happening or not happening, we don't know, of course."
"15046690","15048210"," I'm going to post a link to it."
"15050150","15051430"," Yeah, no worries, Shaq. "
"15051470","15051950"," I got your brother."
"15052410","15053950"," I'm going to post a link to the video though."
"15054890","15062330"," And I think this is where George Gammon at least explains stealth QE. "
"15063110","15065190"," Watch that video on your own time."
"15066130","15068970"," And he talks about, I think it's this video."
"15068970","15071190"," Don't can't hold me to this guy at all. "
"15071390","15073270"," I don't know what this guy is or isn't."
"15074110","15079610"," But I believe that in that video, he describes what happens with stealth QE."
"15079930","15084370"," This is where this is where prime banks, right?"
"15084550","15085490"," These are federal banks. "
"15085930","15088850"," The fed loans money to prime banks."
"15089470","15095350"," And then the prime banks loan this money to hedge funds rather than you and I."
"15097010","15099670"," It's a way to have stealth QE."
"15100570","15106970"," So where like money is running money is like fucking flowing everywhere, right?"
"15107150","15108010"," For everybody. "
"15110170","15115630"," And they they institute some form of this QE in the background that you that they're not going to"
"15115630","15116250"," give to you."
"15116250","15120410"," And they're not going to give to Tesla, let's say, although they do all these companies still get"
"15120410","15120810"," loans."
"15121750","15124330"," They take loans, whether the rates are good or bad. "
"15124490","15125030"," We know that, right?"
"15125170","15129190"," Since 1978, you can check on the Fed funds or the feds own website."
"15130070","15134890"," And you can see that that like loans to corporations stopped."
"15136070","15144870"," And I think believe in 1980 or so, companies continually take loans regardless of the rates"
"15144870","15145570"," involved. "
"15147490","15150870"," On this track that's never gone down since like 1980."
"15151090","15154610"," It's like fucking loans, loans, loans, nobody fucking cares."
"15155410","15156550"," Like on a tightening cycle. "
"15157790","15164510"," Traditionally, the thesis is you cut off the free money supply to corporations and they die."
"15164910","15166930"," But the fact is they just keep taking the fucking loans."
"15167190","15169330"," They don't care if they're going to go bankrupt or not. "
"15169830","15176730"," Now, there's this whole other thing where what they do is they do this stealth QE where they're"
"15176730","15179570"," funneling money to hedge funds to buy the market."
"15180490","15185670"," So basically the Fed is the Treasury Department's loaning cash to a hedge fund and saying, fuck"
"15185670","15186610"," yeah, here's free money."
"15187250","15192350"," We're going to funnel it through our bank to a prime bank from a prime bank airmarked for you. "
"15192810","15195430"," And you can fucking party in the stock market with it."
"15198370","15206610"," So you're enriching rich fat old white guys and not necessarily you late stage in the market."
"15207850","15209430"," So there's a link to it. "
"15210550","15214250"," I think that's the video, although I might be wrong on it."
"15214870","15218290"," And this guy from what I'm looking at it is YouTube channel."
"15218490","15223950"," It looks like he does a lot of stuff that may or may not come true. "
"15223950","15231910"," But he at least does a really good job of explaining the mechanics of these things to you."
"15232090","15235350"," So take a peek at it and maybe you can watch it."
"15235650","15242310"," And it kind of lines up with that article that I posted to you over the weekend about their being"
"15242310","15244870"," like, there's fucking there's money sloshing around. "
"15245650","15252910"," There is some QE going on that is not acknowledged by the general or not acknowledged by most"
"15252910","15253850"," people out there."
"15258520","15259500"," Yeah, yeah."
"15262120","15263680"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. "
"15264020","15265060"," That's going to pull it."
"15265200","15267680"," We always talk about the Fed president about Jerome, right?"
"15268180","15272760"," We don't do a lot of talking about what Yellen is doing in the background, do we?"
"15274280","15279260"," And she's the treasury department is like a hand in hand partner with this stuff."
"15279560","15284340"," As a matter of fact, earlier in the program, someone brought up Bob Kendall. "
"15285580","15288280"," And I'm going to bring up something else here for you guys."
"15288560","15290500"," I want you to watch when you have a chance."
"15292680","15294920"," And this is a fascinating interview. "
"15295780","15304200"," Now, what's fascinating what I find fascinating about this is that Bob Pendle did a."
"15306820","15308380"," Let me see if I find it here."
"15309660","15311860"," Bob Pendle did a interview."
"15313780","15316960"," With a friend of his who used to be a."
"15317840","15322320"," We used to be a president of some big, some big group. "
"15322320","15324700"," Let me see if I find this here right here."
"15325660","15329160"," I want you guys to also definitely without a doubt."
"15329220","15331980"," I want you to watch listen to this in your free time. "
"15332440","15335700"," So if you wanted to try back to here, okay, you want to try back to here?"
"15336480","15339760"," Here's the last link for you that I want you guys to consume."
"15341920","15344220"," And this one here is not a video."
"15344480","15347560"," It's just a it's just a looks like a Twitter spaces. "
"15348400","15353800"," Now looks like it's gotten now it's had 3000 views, but at the time it had no viewers."
"15354580","15357280"," When he did this interview, nobody watched it."
"15358000","15361620"," It was a Twitter spaces conversation with Dr. James Baker. "
"15362620","15368840"," Now, when I tell you guys out there, hey, you should always follow Bob Pendle and the guys like"
"15368840","15370280"," that won't be around anymore."
"15371120","15375240"," You know, these guys were fucking major players back in the day."
"15376020","15379480"," And now that these guys get older, they don't give a fuck anymore. "
"15379900","15383040"," They'll tell you the truth of what happens in the background."
"15383840","15384680"," That's what I talk about."
"15384760","15385320"," Jimmy June. "
"15385600","15393120"," I talk about Jim or Jedi Marcus or even Victor Nederhofer."
"15393380","15393440"," Right?"
"15393600","15399240"," When you see Nederhofer out there talking on Twitter, you want to you want to absorb what these"
"15399240","15402520"," guys are saying because no one's really listening to these guys anymore."
"15403720","15408180"," So these guys, because they're getting older, like, well, fuck it, I'll tell the truth. "
"15408980","15409080"," Right?"
"15409940","15415760"," And they give you real insider insight into how our markets run in the background."
"15417560","15419080"," That is not public."
"15419620","15426480"," The human aspect to what you read sometimes in books like past Fed Chairs will come out and say,"
"15426540","15427420"," you know what, I'll tell you the truth. "
"15428080","15429520"," This is really what's going on."
"15429520","15435380"," Hey, and by the way, I don't actually believe that any of the Fed tools really impacts inflation."
"15435540","15441300"," I think we just time it to coincide with the natural flow of inflation, right?"
"15441540","15444360"," You'll find previous Fed presidents will say that too. "
"15445120","15446740"," So watch that last."
"15446960","15454540"," Listen to that last program because James Baker pretty much says in my view what James Baker says"
"15454540","15458600"," is the fucking fraud is so bad right now."
"15458600","15467440"," That literally the fraud is so bad that the Treasury Department is going to step in with stealth QE"
"15467440","15470800"," and just prop the fucking fraud up 100%. "
"15470800","15472680"," And that they have no choice in this."
"15473220","15479380"," Like they literally do not have a choice but to prop up the fraud as long as possible."
"15480440","15483140"," They will do every single thing in their power to do it. "
"15492420","15494960"," Yeah, without a doubt, I want you guys to do that."
"15495100","15500760"," On your own time tonight, watch that Gammin guy talk about the process of stealth QE."
"15501100","15509240"," Listen to Baker and Bob Kendall talk about their experiences when they were important people in the"
"15509240","15511960"," market when Baker was the guy like Baker was a guy. "
"15512580","15517840"," He's like he was like a fucking like one of the guys like he'd be like I don't know like"
"15517840","15525140"," you guys all look up to like Tom Lee's and you guys look up to Bill Ackman's out there and"
"15525140","15528140"," all these other like fixtures in our trading communities."
"15529280","15534140"," But these guys like especially this Baker guy he was like a president of some big shit back in the"
"15534140","15534500"," day."
"15537860","15543140"," If you I'm telling you if you listen to this Baker guy he was like the guy at one time"
"15543140","15548020"," he goes he goes right through it and he's you're just like fuck me we're all fucked. "
"15549680","15558660"," So there you go there's two things away to watch over."
"15560760","15562780"," I'm still I still own RGF."
"15563540","15569340"," I own RGF on an M&A so I'm not selling RGF in any way shape or form. "
"15569820","15575000"," The owner keep they keep buying it a dollar forty dollar forty and then I keep watching that all"
"15575000","15576960"," the insiders are buying it."
"15577100","15585720"," So I'm looking for a I'm looking for either a merger or a or some kind of a C suite"
"15585720","15588280"," take the company private."
"15588840","15593180"," Type thing and if they do that they're going to rent the price on that on that ticker I do"
"15593180","15594220"," own that ticker by the way. "
"15595100","15599340"," And I'm not selling until after Q1 if I if I'm going to cut losses on that trade it's going"
"15599340","15600300"," to be after Q1."
"15601380","15604180"," I'm looking for some news out of them."
"15605380","15607080"," Let's see here get rid of that there. "
"15609280","15618260"," Oh sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry."
"15618260","15624380"," I'm assuming it's going to take place in Q1 and if it doesn't take place in Q1 the other aspect"
"15624380","15630640"," to this is if you if you got I forget what it's called it right now top my head but"
"15630640","15637540"," what'll happen sometimes is they'll intentionally insiders will intentionally drive the price down"
"15637540","15644380"," as low as they can get it and they start accumulating controlling shares to either take the company"
"15644380","15645540"," profit or private."
"15646560","15654540"," And as a matter of fact one of the major stockholders of our GF came out a couple weeks ago"
"15654540","15664420"," and was super pissed because all of the C suite is buying up stock the stock and he thinks"
"15664420","15666160"," they're going to take a prop take a private. "
"15670000","15670860"," Sorry boy."
"15671800","15672360"," Yeah."
"15674020","15677420"," My fear here is that well I've got another problem too. "
"15678180","15684520"," What I told you guys about our GF I don't want to get busted for insider trading so I'm going"
"15684520","15691340"," to I vow to hold this ticker regardless for Q1 so I'm on that trade for all of Q1 they"
"15691340","15692660"," look primed and ready for me."
"15692660","15697480"," I love that company by the way everything I've seen about that company is well except except for"
"15697480","15701900"," the bad debt that they repackaged but they have a way to pay it off the path now so I'm"
"15701900","15706180"," happy with it and I'm really happy with them all of their 13 F shit."
"15708220","15715970"," So yeah they're in Costco dude if you look at if you look at some of their all their news"
"15715970","15716950"," that's coming out. "
"15716950","15721690"," It looks to me like MMA or looks to me like they're going to take it private."
"15721690","15729590"," I'll go with either either way I should I should do quite well with the payoff on that."
"15731510","15732690"," So it's a matter of holding. "
"15735270","15740650"," Yeah you know what Bork I didn't do today I wanted to get to fully anticipated retaliatory strikes"
"15740650","15741750"," from the Houthis."
"15742750","15749370"," I wanted to I haven't had a chance to roll this segment yet but I wanted to talk to people"
"15749370","15751610"," about earnings season."
"15752250","15761030"," And when we're in earnings season two it's a really good time to be looking for any companies"
"15761030","15762410"," selling off. "
"15763730","15768050"," For possible dip buys as the season ends."
"15769990","15775690"," I'm not there yet running that segment but we need to talk about that."
"15776110","15783090"," So you'll likely see profit taking on tickers that ramp into their ER season. "
"15783750","15789250"," And then you're also looking for companies that are selling off deeply into their earnings season"
"15789250","15789550"," here."
"15789550","15797110"," And specifically for myself I'm trying to put some exposure into the market coming into March if"
"15797110","15797450"," possible."
"15798330","15805330"," And so I'm using this ER season right now as a place to try to buy some dips out there. "
"15806550","15807850"," And Tesla is one of them."
"15808030","15817010"," Tesla is a prime example of a ticker that I'm really interested in buying for the year for this"
"15817010","15817270"," year."
"15817270","15827190"," So yeah I want to see companies that are selling into their earnings hard and"
"15827190","15829490"," heavy the last year if possible. "
"15830350","15835270"," If there's I've got a bunch of tickers I've got a bunch of ETFs that are doing that right now."
"15835750","15845490"," And maybe I can show that at some point but I'm watching a bunch of different sectors to see if"
"15845490","15846990"," there's some good dip buys for the year."
"15854590","15857310"," All right try to see what I can find here. "
"15858110","15859290"," You got a YouTube really quick."
"15868150","15869430"," That half back trade."
"15870810","15875130"," You know you guys I'm positioned pretty heavily to the downside here. "
"15875950","15883170"," I'm just looking for like 471, 470 and then close and then looking to buy a dip down there."
"15883270","15884210"," That's my whole plan here."
"15888340","15889640"," Hey what's going on Shaq. "
"15893820","15899940"," Yeah you guys are just buying the dip and selling the rip right the ping pong."
"15900820","15902580"," I did have a question here."
"15903120","15906200"," I did for a moment I got scared I'll be honest with you guys. "
"15907100","15915060"," For a moment today specifically I was like should I just monetize these puts in case they do some"
"15915060","15916140"," stupid ass ramp."
"15916640","15919820"," Into the 17th that like 4800 or something."
"15921760","15923920"," If that is actually where the pit is. "
"15925580","15930380"," You know you get like that just ramp up and close at 4800 and then I'm going to get fucked"
"15930380","15933300"," on these puts and that's a I get a lot of money in that trade."
"15934880","15937120"," So I'm concerned I'll say that."
"15938340","15939820"," I will say that to you guys. "
"15941800","15945060"," They do have him I do have him until the 31st so."
"15946840","15951560"," I'd left enough time on that we could still get a roll down that I could monetize but."
"15952620","15955600"," I'm assuming that I'd have to hold him right to God damn expiry. "
"15956220","15959740"," Which I fucking hate when that happens on spreads that shit pisses me off."
"15970330","15974690"," Yeah you guys are just well you guys are just watching a ping pong action here for op-x."
"15977430","15981010"," You said that you guys have said something about Mr. Yen up here. "
"15983330","15985550"," So Mr. Bien's been on fire recently."
"15986510","15989590"," He's been dropping bombs and stuff out there."
"15989750","15990270"," I hope that's good. "
"15990850","15992030"," I like Mr. Yen."
"15992550","15997410"," He's he's he's he's or I spent a lot of time watching him for a couple years."
"15998430","15999590"," I used to watch. "
"16000410","16003710"," I used to watch a lot of thinkors swim."
"16004570","16011170"," And then they paired back their coverage and then I went to Mr. Yen for some period of time."
"16011790","16014250"," Then Mr. Yen was getting really sick so. "
"16015350","16019670"," That's part of the reason we started the show is because there wasn't anybody on every day"
"16019670","16020030"," consistently."
"16021410","16025530"," For cash market hours or what I would see on."
"16025990","16029690"," Every day was like bros fist pumping or. "
"16030370","16033850"," I don't know people dropping archaic."
"16034770","16038230"," Non positional information that didn't have anything to do with the price."
"16039070","16041290"," Of trade in the market in that day. "
"16043170","16047750"," Like see I even have I even want to I want to fucking monetize this shit right now."
"16048070","16049710"," I'm not going to leave it on."
"16050590","16052210"," Let's stick with my thesis here. "
"16055270","16059070"," Yeah, my puts are doing really well right now right where we are right here."
"16059830","16062430"," My puts are in really good shape right now."
"16074120","16074840"," Hold on here. "
"16074940","16079200"," I have one of the associate of producers that contact me right now."
"16082290","16083310"," Yeah, thanks, Binky."
"16090240","16091640"," Thanks for the for the. "
"16093000","16093940"," Oh, I'm bored."
"16094140","16095860"," Don't ever hesitate to text me, man."
"16096960","16098700"," Don't ever hesitate to text me brother. "
"16098820","16102020"," If you ever want to do a produce because you are the producers."
"16102020","16107040"," So if you ever like want me to do something and I'm missing something like captain fuck you doing"
"16107040","16109180"," cover this or deal with that or whatever."
"16109680","16110660"," I will brother. "
"16116420","16117660"," Let me see what I'm doing here."
"16121120","16122460"," You see that right there?"
"16122620","16123740"," That's the market right there."
"16123740","16124260"," You see that?"
"16127080","16128580"," That's the market right here, man. "
"16128760","16129720"," This is it right here."
"16130920","16133420"," This is the this is the real market right down here."
"16137850","16138730"," That's the floor. "
"16138890","16139450"," That's the rug."
"16145490","16146450"," Trader TV."
"16146790","16147530"," I don't know those guys. "
"16148210","16151570"," I don't watch a lot of YouTube anymore."

"16179690","16184750"," And the other problem that I had was when I first started streaming. "
"16185350","16192970"," I would allow other takes to pollute my my thesis and stuff."
"16192970","16196450"," So I didn't want to do that to other people and be like I'm going to steal all their shit"
"16196450","16198750"," or they're influencing what I see."

"16299130","16300350"," Yeah, I don't know who they are."
"16300350","16301550"," Never watched them ever."
"16302250","16303070"," Don't know anything about them. "
"16303130","16303590"," I'll watch them."

"16335770","16338830"," Someone said, hey, there's a guy on Twitch that's been doing it for a long time."
"16339170","16340050"," You should check him out."
"16340170","16341090"," So I did check that guy out. "
"16341090","16341870"," He seemed pretty cool too."
"16348380","16349200"," I don't know."
"16349340","16352080"," He's the number one financial streamer on Twitch. "
"16352440","16353400"," I don't know what his name is."
"16353400","16354280"," I can look him up, I guess."
"16356360","16359500"," Who I think Winky recommended that I watch his show. "
"16359660","16360820"," So I did watch him one morning."

"16379280","16380960"," Let me see if I can find who this guy is."
"16387250","16388650"," He stands up. "
"16390550","16393169"," He's standing to the left of his screen or something."
"16397060","16398000"," I don't know who he is."
"16398860","16400520"," I don't see him here in this list. "
"16409590","16411189"," I don't see his picture here."
"16416150","16417630"," I'll have to find out who he is."
"16418849","16420009"," I'll email Winky. "
"16420210","16423270"," I still talk to Winky, so I'll email him and see what he says."
"16427270","16428590"," Is that him, Jay Arlington?"
"16429210","16430169"," He's usually screaming."
"16430930","16433970"," He's usually like, I don't want to say it looks like he's on drugs. "
"16435110","16438590"," I think he said he had kids or something, too, or a wife and kids."
"16438590","16440689"," It looked like he just hasn't slept."
"16442349","16445070"," Like he's being dragged around by his family or something. "
"16447130","16450970"," But I will watch Trader TV and I'll try to find out who that guy is."
"16451250","16452250"," And maybe it is Jay Arlington."
"16452550","16455130"," I'm not sure if that is him. "
"16457509","16458610"," Can I look at a who?"
"16461939","16462520"," Oh, so it's not."
"16462740","16463880"," Okay, so it's not Jay Arlington."
"16464340","16465080"," Okay, it might not be. "
"16465560","16470400"," I don't know if it's him or not."
"16470400","16473900"," This shoveled and he's like, he looks like Jim Kramer or not."
"16474020","16474800"," It doesn't look like Jim Kramer. "
"16475040","16477380"," He's like always like very, very active."
"16477560","16478480"," He's been on CNBC, too."
"16478640","16480840"," I think he's been on CNBC a couple of times. "
"16481560","16483660"," I feel like a retail trader's perspective or something."
"16485140","16486020"," The stock guy."
"16486180","16486500"," I don't know. "
"16487000","16487580"," I'll have to look him up."
"16488439","16489960"," I'll ask Winky and see what Winky says."
"16490060","16491020"," Who Winky says he is. "
"16494619","16495820"," Oh, look at that."
"16497099","16500520"," Doom and gloom going on right now, boys and girls."
"16502840","16504680"," There's the rest three right over there. "
"16508200","16510520"," Don't tease me with a good time, spoos."
"16512480","16514020"," Don't tease me with a good time."
"16517200","16517740"," Hold on. "
"16517820","16518560"," I got to tell Joe."
"16518800","16520279"," I think Joe's in this trade with me."
"16520340","16520800"," Hold on a second. "
"16520960","16524160"," I got to tell him to get ready to monetize."
"16525360","16526460"," Hold on a second here."
"16529860","16531439"," Open your spreads, bro. "
"16535070","16536509"," We might get a print."
"16540050","16541430"," Don't dick tease me."
"16544970","16547290"," I was I went skiing this weekend. "
"16548810","16550450"," What did I notice skiing?"
"16552849","16555869"," The resorts weren't as busy as I expected."
"16557570","16558890"," So I ski regularly."
"16559590","16562050"," They were busy, but they weren't as busy as I expect. "
"16562390","16563169"," They were crazy busy."
"16564430","16566450"," But they weren't busy like they were."
"16566830","16568070"," Not like last winter. "
"16568369","16569290"," Not like the winter before."
"16570570","16572230"," But they weren't dead either."
"16574369","16575090"," What else?"
"16576310","16577250"," Did I notice?"
"16578849","16579930"," What else did I notice?"
"16580029","16581270"," I always try to notice things. "
"16583169","16587210"," The people were spending money in the lodges, which was nice to see."
"16587950","16590110"," So people still have money to blow and spend."
"16596320","16597000"," What else?"
"16600099","16600980"," Hold on. "
"16601060","16602460"," You guys are asking about some stuff here."
"16602599","16602820"," Hold on."
"16603000","16603220"," Hold on. "
"16603439","16603840"," AAP."
"16605800","16606919"," I'll look at AAP."
"16607360","16608800"," What was the other one I said I would look at?"
"16611240","16613000"," Somebody asked for something else. "
"16614919","16616360"," What were they asking for?"
"16617419","16618540"," Joe, you watch him."
"16618660","16620800"," Oh, here comes Joe in the house right now."
"16620800","16621619"," It was Walmart. "
"16621960","16622180"," Okay."
"16622560","16622880"," Walmart."
"16623259","16623740"," WMT. "
"16625619","16626980"," We'll look at two of those really."
"16627220","16628340"," Let me do that on the side here."
"16630380","16630900"," I got you. "
"16631060","16631580"," I got you."
"16631700","16632040"," It's Walmart."
"16632460","16632939"," I got you. "
"16633080","16633599"," I got you."
"16635980","16637140"," Anita, Max, win one."
"16637140","16637860"," What's going on?"
"16637980","16638980"," Anita, Max, win one. "
"16639300","16639880"," First time chatter."
"16641259","16642220"," Welcome to the show."
"16643279","16643939"," Look at it. "
"16644099","16644460"," I know."
"16644800","16645419"," I know Joe."
"16645860","16649840"," Joe, Joe, and I are like fucking make the market burn, right?"
"16650820","16653279"," But then like you're like, well, how much do you want it to burn?"
"16653540","16654020"," Not that low. "
"16654259","16654820"," Just like 470."
"16656960","16660439"," I just want to print 470 so we can go up to whatever you want."
"16667080","16667640"," Right. "
"16668480","16669700"," I want it to burn."
"16670980","16673400"," Like your local bear on fence."
"16673400","16675640"," You're like, do that guy's really bearish right now. "
"16675980","16677040"," Where do you want it to burn to?"
"16677340","16678000"," Just 470."
"16680340","16682160"," Then I'll flatten out and join you."
"16689300","16690419"," Yeah, I know. "
"16692300","16693759"," I don't want actual burning."
"16694419","16695180"," I'm still a bull."
"16695939","16698480"," I just want to just want this fucking thing to print. "
"16707560","16710320"," This is it right is the gamma flip right here."
"16712300","16712779"," 47."
"16712779","16718300"," The low on SPX there was four, seven, five, two, eight, nine. "
"16720320","16722180"," Let me draw a little line in here."
"16723800","16725040"," Can we touch it at least?"
"16727140","16727619"," 4750."
"16727759","16728900"," Just give me 4750. "
"16733939","16736000"," This fucking these fucking Al goes."
"16738320","16740040"," Coming down here to touch the bulls."
"16740980","16742360"," Touch the bulls where it hurts. "
"16744220","16745540"," Does it hurt over here, bull?"
"16748759","16754599"," Does it hurt when I touch you here?"
"16759220","16760540"," Oh, here we go."
"16760720","16762180"," Here comes the anal probe."
"16765040","16766619"," Here comes the bull anal probe. "
"16799440","16801460"," Just down there to touch it."
"16803300","16818820"," Oh, yeah,"
"16818960","16819340"," baby."
"16821820","16828840"," If you could just take a seat over there on the couch and just roll over a little bit there. "
"16829660","16831220"," Pull your pants down gently."
"16832160","16832880"," No, sir."
"16832980","16834000"," I don't need them around your ankles. "
"16834320","16836940"," Just below the butt clap."
"16837680","16838760"," There you go."
"16841380","16843780"," Nurse Bob, can you grab me a pair of gloves?"
"16857260","16859160"," Can you bring me the warm jelly?"
"16865430","16866950"," We need the lube right now. "
"16867130","16868450"," We're going lube right now."
"16869570","16870450"," It's just probing."
"16871290","16874710"," It's making sure we ain't got no cliffhangers or anything up in there. "
"16875850","16877750"," Just breathe in a little bit."
"16882670","16884990"," Yeah, it's not that we don't want to invite them."
"16884990","16886970"," They just never bring their own blow. "
"16894450","16900480"," Would it be too much to ask?"
"16901860","16903820"," Oh, yeah, you guys want to see the..."
"16903820","16905140"," Oh, you guys want to see that?"
"16905900","16906760"," Hold on here."
"16909770","16913750"," So the deal with this will be this, okay?"
"16915010","16923130"," I can't get you the gamma information until 9.30am. It's the cleanest data."
"16923130","16925590"," It's like 9 to 9.30 in the morning. "
"16926070","16929810"," Right before the market opens is when that data is cleanest."
"16931330","16935910"," So the problem is you got all this like zero date shit during the day."
"16936550","16939990"," Then you have a bunch of shit that's coming on and coming off the market at the end of the"
"16939990","16940150"," day. "
"16940370","16945790"," So like the cleanest data is usually about 8.30 in the morning until about 9.30 in the morning."
"16946670","16955410"," So what will happen though is you are going to get that data from me on the website once we"
"16955410","16959150"," launch, truly launch, you're going to get that stuff every morning from me."
"16959970","16961670"," Every single morning you'll get it. "
"16961950","16967760"," So every single morning, you're going to get it every single morning from me."
"16973600","16975060"," That's a good question by the way."
"16984750","16985970"," Do you guys want..."
"16985970","16987030"," Hey, let me delete this right here. "
"16987370","16988750"," Do you guys want to snap this for the day?"
"16989070","16989730"," Hold on a second here."
"16992490","16993370"," Can I..."
"16994590","16995730"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"16996050","16996090"," Yeah. "
"16997950","16998390"," Yeah."
"16999050","16999590"," Oh, yeah."
"17002490","17004450"," So here for..."
"17006010","17008470"," Let me see if I can get this for you guys really quick. "
"17013170","17015190"," So here's the gamma flip right here."
"17015250","17015790"," You want to see it?"
"17016270","17016490"," So dump."
"17017270","17018350"," You see that line right there?"
"17020750","17022430"," This is the gamma flip right here. "
"17028830","17032370"," Joe, if you want to monetize, this is one of those times, brother."
"17033390","17036190"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"17037350","17041930"," Testing the gamma flip right now as we speak on SPX. "
"17043870","17045370"," Oh, yeah."
"17046150","17050570"," Oh, blood in the marketplace right now."
"17050750","17051730"," Blood in the marketplace. "
"17052730","17053610"," Oh."
"17055570","17056070"," Oh."
"17059110","17059610"," Oh. "
"17062570","17063450"," Oh."
"17067640","17068520"," Oh."
"17068520","17069200"," Oh. "
"17069200","17069280"," Oh."
"17076490","17076710"," Oh."
"17076710","17076730"," Oh. "
"17080660","17082300"," Touch the gamma flip."
"17082760","17082860"," Oh."
"17089940","17090820"," Oh. "
"17090820","17091380"," Oh."
"17091720","17095470"," Oh, yeah."
"17098980","17100540"," Not so bad, right?"
"17100880","17101600"," The lube was warm. "
"17102040","17102900"," The lube was warm."
"17102900","17104680"," It wasn't so bad."
"17106140","17106860"," Oof. "
"17108600","17109320"," Oof."
"17110420","17111140"," Oof."
"17115220","17115700"," Oof. "
"17119820","17120280"," Oof."
"17120280","17120400"," Oof."
"17120400","17120620"," Oh, yeah. "
"17121420","17123520"," Oh, that doesn't feel so bad."
"17123680","17124060"," Does it balls?"
"17125760","17126480"," Hahaha."
"17128540","17129260"," Hahaha. "
"17129260","17129620"," Hahaha."
"17130900","17131620"," Oof."
"17133100","17133660"," Oof. "
"17134020","17135120"," Next gamma level."
"17135480","17136400"," Do you want to know where that is?"
"17140960","17141840"," 4720."
"17142760","17145140"," Snap a line on 4720. "
"17146360","17147240"," 4720."
"17148060","17148460"," 4720."
"17148460","17148680"," SPS. "
"17154900","17156380"," Testing gamma flip."
"17171780","17172660"," Oh, yeah."
"17181840","17182720"," 4720. "
"17183560","17183840"," 4720."
"17187420","17188300"," Hahaha."
"17188300","17188520"," Hahaha. "
"17189780","17190020"," Hahaha."
"17198820","17201300"," What am I looking for here, Cap, before I go long?"
"17201560","17202920"," I'm going to close these put spreads."
"17204140","17210140"," I'd really like to close where I want to close them is because I can't make any more money off"
"17210140","17210320"," them. "
"17211000","17214940"," To be honest, not like what I want to do is close."
"17215640","17217140"," There's two places I'm looking at."
"17218720","17220580"," So 30 minute chart here. "
"17225690","17226970"," I'm looking to close."
"17232400","17234240"," I'm looking for a close right here."
"17235540","17235940"," Okay. "
"17236920","17238620"," So right there monetize these puts."
"17239360","17243260"," Now if we continue down and we start to reject this gamma flip."
"17244800","17247560"," So here, so I want to monetize this right here. "
"17247840","17247980"," Okay."
"17250320","17255900"," Now if we do reject and begin to head lower, I'll, you know, that wouldn't be like that."
"17256020","17256780"," It would be more like this. "
"17258300","17259320"," Shit, hold on."
"17262660","17267400"," Now I want to monetize this, this breach of the gamma flip, right?"
"17268080","17271680"," It's 41, 47170 ish somewhere in there."
"17272620","17275040"," I want to monetize those put spreads. "
"17275320","17279580"," But if we do begin to reject and make a line for this down here."
"17280560","17285180"," I'd be interested in that part of the trade right there."
"17285780","17290940"," Taking some more like aggressive downside action down here to 4600. "
"17294670","17297490"," But for right now, we're pretty close to where I want to be."
"17298190","17303470"," I mean, this is, this is where, so we, we bought put spreads right here."
"17305270","17307190"," And this is pretty good down here, right?"
"17307410","17309510"," It's pretty good fucking trade. "
"17309990","17312850"," Now if there's a little extra down here, that'd be kind of nice, right?"
"17312850","17314070"," B-shaped over there."
"17318330","17319630"," So we're getting close."
"17320230","17325290"," Joe, if you're, Joe, if you're looking to take the money and run, this is your first stop, brother. "
"17326230","17327870"," This is the first target here."
"17332160","17334020"," Oh, it does say gamma flip there."
"17334180","17334960"," Okay, we can get rid of that. "
"17341570","17345050"," So Joe, if you want to, if you want to monetize here, man, I don't blame you."
"17346030","17351810"," Or take some off and then hold some down here for this S3 down below."
"17400340","17401020"," Wait a minute. "
"17401120","17406640"," What I missed some here, what you looking for here cap before you go long, what I mean is gamma"
"17406640","17407940"," flip is a great place for reversal."
"17408820","17412020"," What kind of pattern would you want to see here before you started getting bullish?"
"17413020","17422700"," Okay, so before I started getting bullish here, so on this gamma flip, okay, I don't"
"17422700","17423040"," care."
"17425220","17428080"," I don't care if the blood is to here. "
"17428160","17429380"," I don't care if it's to here."
"17429380","17430620"," I don't care if it's down here."
"17431860","17434400"," What I care about is if it rejects. "
"17435180","17441480"," So the initial, the initial move down on the gamma flip, I don't care about, I care about a"
"17441480","17443960"," rejection here."
"17446820","17450780"," So that would be something like we get out and whatever and then we start to reject."
"17451420","17457260"," If that starts to happen, I'm pretty fucking bearish with that action like this. "
"17458100","17463820"," Now to get long here on the initial move down, I'm still bullish here."
"17464580","17465840"," So I'm looking to buy a dip."
"17466720","17471400"," Now right now the one in five that are pretty vertical here, so I'm not trying to buy a dip"
"17471400","17472380"," here right now. "
"17472740","17475020"," Get some flattening going on in the hourly trigger."
"17475760","17479300"," I'd be looking for a reversal of the one in five minute like this."
"17479840","17485620"," Something like that and I'd want to see a bull cross in a one in five minute basis. "
"17485620","17488500"," I want to see this actual action right here."
"17489000","17492900"," And I would like to see price above and back testing to get long again."
"17493380","17494140"," Something like this. "
"17498000","17499080"," Something like this."
"17499960","17500820"," Still not long."
"17501200","17501920"," Still not long. "
"17502580","17503980"," Want to watch this Bing Bing."
"17504920","17505060"," Right."
"17505440","17506260"," Something like that. "
"17506520","17507240"," Something like that."
"17507540","17508020"," Something like that."
"17508800","17512140"," And then something to write about there. "
"17513960","17518440"," If that gets bought somewhere in here, I'd probably take that trade."
"17518600","17519200"," I'm not going to lie to you."
"17519200","17522040"," I'm going to take that trade and I'd probably take that trade. "
"17522800","17527680"," But truthfully, you need to be above the hourly trigger and back test."
"17528000","17529320"," Somewhere up here is the safest trade."
"17530320","17534780"," Somewhere up there is the actual safest trade right there to get long. "
"17536940","17539240"," But there's some stages here if you're going to buy a dip."
"17542490","17543810"," Oh, yeah, that's good, huh?"
"17544050","17544310"," Oh, yeah."
"17546190","17546550"," 473. "
"17547650","17548570"," Oh, seven."
"17549090","17555430"," Oh, yeah, just give me that fucking give me 470 now."
"17556690","17557550"," I'm getting greedy. "
"17560650","17562150"," Oh, my camera's not on, huh?"
"17564310","17565570"," Sorry about that boys and girls."
"17570720","17572520"," Oh, yeah, we're just getting started here."
"17572700","17572900"," Look at that. "
"17573020","17573260"," It's beautiful."
"17573260","17577340"," If you are a bull, you're looking to sell the hourly trigger."
"17577660","17578800"," You already know the half hour trigger. "
"17579440","17582060"," Not seeing that chasing going on just yet."
"17583200","17586620"," Not seeing the half hour of the hour making big moves down."
"17587440","17588680"," We'll see if this holds here. "
"17598280","17599780"," Yeah, Jill, you're exiting here."
"17604490","17608110"," Hourly trigger is important for trend up or down."
"17608410","17610650"," We sell the hourly trigger when we're below it. "
"17611130","17613350"," When we're above it, we buy the hourly trigger."
"17614210","17615370"," Right now we're in negativity."
"17628140","17633620"," So any successful back test of the hourly trigger on the upper downside leads to more upper"
"17633620","17634020"," downside. "
"17634980","17641440"," Any break of the hourly trigger to the downside or the upside does not necessarily correlate to"
"17641440","17644180"," more downside or more upside to come."
"17644820","17649720"," So if we squeeze below the hourly trigger or squeeze above the hourly trigger, I want to see"
"17649720","17654740"," confirmation on a back test first before we begin to make our way lower or higher."
"17655920","17662560"," Also, if we spend a lot of time on the hourly trigger, it can lead to big downside moves and"
"17662560","17665340"," big upside moves, depending upon if we're above it or below it. "
"17666380","17674140"," And right now, we're not right now, but oftentimes if we have aggressive move going higher off the"
"17674140","17676500"," hourly trigger, that always comes back."
"17676860","17678700"," A lot of like 80% of the time it comes back."
"17679180","17680880"," Sometimes it doesn't, but it's very rare. "
"17681620","17687340"," So major squeezes as we encounter the hourly trigger typically come back."
"17688080","17689280"," That's up and down."
"17689640","17696040"," And then I would also have a look back period of about three hours to see if we're bearish on"
"17696040","17698740"," that look back period or bullish on that look back period. "
"17705790","17711050"," That's too violated as people like to say, is that bearish?"
"17711990","17714790"," It's the start of bearishness, but no confirmation yet."
"17716510","17719510"," We do have a cross of the half hour trigger below the hourly trigger."
"17719510","17720950"," That is bearish as well. "
"17722930","17726090"," And right now for the aggressiveness of this of this one minute trigger."
"17726090","17728550"," If this holds, we should see more downside to come."
"17732260","17734200"," So no bullish reversal here yet. "
"17734380","17736060"," If I see a bullish reversal, I'll let you know."
"17736900","17738540"," As of right now, don't see one."
"17744260","17746260"," Yes, the more we back tested, absolutely. "
"17747880","17748280"," Absolutely."
"17748900","17753400"," So as a matter of fact, right here, see you've got that you've got you can already see we're"
"17753400","17754860"," selling off the half hour trigger."
"17756340","17760720"," As of right now, I'd be expecting even if we squeeze up here, we're going to sell back down here"
"17760720","17763000"," again and possibly get an even lower low here. "
"17773020","17776000"," But I'm not seeing it like I'm not seeing aggressive moved out."
"17776000","17780760"," So let's look at the trigger screen really quick."
"17780780","17782120"," Let's move it to a 30 minute basis. "
"17786610","17789630"," You know, you're like, you're seeing right now, right?"
"17789890","17790910"," There's a lot of shit on the screen."
"17790990","17794370"," It shouldn't be like this, but it's because I'm trading it."
"17794510","17798270"," But you see how we're we're above the hourly trigger. "
"17798530","17799350"," We're just testing it."
"17799450","17799530"," Yeah."
"17799530","17799630"," Yeah. "
"17799750","17800730"," Where everything's awesome."
"17801270","17802090"," Fail this one."
"17802930","17806210"," Losing and also the flat like see the aggressiveness of the early trigger. "
"17806210","17807810"," See how it's flattening right here."
"17808510","17811990"," And we're starting to see some downward action in this hourly trigger."
"17812490","17814030"," So it's getting a little bearish here. "
"17814550","17816770"," You know, looking for a little bit of a pull to the downside."
"17817310","17823190"," I really like to see price above and the hourly trigger begin to turn up a little bit to begin"
"17823190","17824110"," to get long again."
"17825070","17826470"," And I've got some targets to the downside. "
"17827290","17827770"," So."
"17829050","17830550"," I'm still a little bearish here."
"17830830","17833610"," Now there's one thing that be said, which is that gamma flip, right?"
"17834070","17835690"," It's probably the bottom ish. "
"17836290","17840050"," We could like I'm just looking for an extension down here, scare the bulls."
"17840110","17841950"," And then we're off and running back to the upside."
"17845790","17846310"," Good job bears. "
"17860040","17862640"," Nice little pull up on this gamma flip here."
"17868540","17871740"," That's our cue still hasn't haven't hit their gamma flip yet."
"17872280","17873860"," Doesn't look like they have yet. "
"17892920","17898400"," Yeah, Chase just said what matters is tomorrow and the rest of the week, whether it's down hard or"
"17898400","17899880"," just chops into the end of the month."
"17900560","17902400"," I'm with you on that chase."
"17903260","17904860"," I'm with you on that, man. "
"17906140","17908820"," My thesis is more on the chop side for now."
"17909400","17910340"," Hey, what's going on?"
"17910340","17910760"," I'm from a block."
"17910920","17911600"," What's up, baby?"
"17912920","17913840"," What's going on, brother?"
"17916060","17918980"," Max Payne would be an absurd pump only to double later this week. "
"17919800","17920540"," In the end of the month."
"17921660","17923620"," Uh, continuation sideways shop."
"17923780","17924300"," I agree with that. "
"17924480","17925820"," Yeah, Quinn, our chase."
"17925920","17928780"," I've got one problem here for myself, which is I'm afraid of that."
"17929460","17931120"," I'm afraid I'm scared of like that. "
"17931260","17934720"," Rip in the 4800 for tomorrow and then the bleed down into the 31st."
"17935440","17936740"," I'm with you and all this chase."
"17936740","17938520"," I'm with you on this brother. "
"17945370","17947030"," How does it feel monetizing?"
"17947290","17948550"," Uh, they're Joe to feel good."
"17949550","17953270"," Taking some money off the table, monetizing, making some cash."
"17958600","17959300"," Front row. "
"17959460","17960440"," I'll pine, baby."
"17961020","17961660"," Front row."
"17961920","17962380"," I'll pine. "
"17962860","17963540"," Say my name."
"17966460","17966780"," Right."
"17968600","17969120"," I'll pine. "
"17971780","17972320"," How do you get velocity?"
"17972940","17973840"," Twenty dollars a month."
"17974020","17974700"," Twenty five bucks a month."
"17978310","17978950"," All right. "
"17979130","17980810"," So I'll be back with you guys in just a minute here."
"17981470","17983650"," Uh, if you are looking for more cell action."
"17985290","17987150"," I'm going to show it to you right now. "
"17987170","17987450"," Okay."
"17987530","17990230"," If you're a bear and you're looking for more downside to come."
"17990510","17991730"," Check that five minute. "
"17993210","17994690"," And look for some more downside."
"17995270","17997650"," Let's look at some previous lows and see what we got here."
"17998930","18000930"," Right down there. "
"18003490","18004870"," So if you are bearish."
"18008620","18010800"," Right down there is what you're looking for."
"18017160","18020880"," I'll make this yellow, I guess, because I got a bunch of shit going on here. "
"18036390","18038310"," I'm going to make one quick phone call here."
"18038890","18040010"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"18042030","18043690"," That easier to see right there. "
"18053760","18055640"," It's not just that either."
"18056400","18057060"," Front row like."
"18058180","18058760"," It's not. "
"18058920","18060000"," It's like gamma, dude."
"18060040","18061600"," You don't have to think about gammas."
"18062400","18064320"," Who do you trust matters more?"
"18064540","18067080"," The new package of liberal market reforms. "
"18067740","18068180"," Right."
"18068400","18070920"," Like this, like you just get a, I think of your gamma tools."
"18070980","18072160"," It doesn't mean shit does it?"
"18072480","18072540"," Yeah. "
"18072760","18074900"," You want to trust the person that you're talking to."
"18075580","18076020"," Right."
"18076260","18076980"," That that matters. "
"18077860","18079560"," Uh, I think that matters and stuff."
"18080240","18081120"," Oh, hold on here."

"18091360","18092800"," Or what's trend here?"
"18093660","18095140"," Let me actually clean this up a little bit."
"18101250","18103630"," They get that last, uh, it's right there. "
"18105550","18106670"," Something like that."
"18113100","18115500"," Something like that right there."
"18118860","18120300"," To help a bear out maybe. "
"18122140","18125200"," Listen, this is the pre prior prior law that we had."
"18125220","18126320"," So somewhere down there."
"18132200","18133280"," If you're a bear. "
"18134040","18136000"," There's your five minute check back right there."

"18152960","18153860"," I got you."

"18160180","18162220"," That's 28 cents or zero spot."
"18162440","18162540"," Three."
"18162640","18162800"," Nine. "
"18163000","18165280"," So Chase is saying what I'm saying."
"18165280","18165980"," Chase is saying what I'm saying."
"18165980","18167360"," And Chase knows this too. "
"18168420","18170680"," Bears need some real blood."
"18171740","18176460"," The slow grind down will eventually lead to a rally in February."
"18177840","18180040"," 1000% chase. "
"18180980","18182000"," I concur."
"18182880","18184380"," 1000% brother."
"18185420","18187140"," If we do the slow grind down. "
"18187580","18189580"," We're going to get a fucking major ramp."
"18190020","18194180"," In the February 100% we were showing them that seasonality chart."
"18194180","18197720"," If we maintain like we go down here but not. "
"18198160","18198580"," Not."
"18199440","18203100"," Not to worry trigger commercials traders to sell."
"18204300","18205100"," We're good. "
"18205880","18206980"," We're good, right?"
"18207240","18207740"," Bulls are good."
"18208340","18210520"," If they can't trigger institutional selling."
"18211180","18215220"," With price, we are going to see them stay long in the market. "
"18215360","18216040"," Go higher, right?"
"18216320","18217300"," I agree with you on that, Chase."
"18217740","18222080"," Chase making some good comments here right now in the YouTube chat here."
"18224180","18225060"," 100% Chase. "
"18225380","18227120"," All of what you just made here, bro."
"18228200","18229520"," 100% agree with you."
"18230460","18231700"," 100% brother. "
"18267570","18269450"," All right, I'll be right back with you guys."
"19252600","19254460"," What's going on right here?"
"19254680","19256660"," Are they going to be able to roll this or not?"
"19258740","19261440"," Is this all the downside to come here?"
"19266580","19273260"," Do we get the role or not?"
"19273260","19276020"," Or do we blast right back up to the hourly trigger?"
"19276820","19279520"," Looks like a nice V shape down here in the intraday."
"19298500","19299860"," Let's see what I can see here. "
"19304720","19306160"," All right, we're going to look at."
"19306880","19308300"," Let me look at AP AP."
"19309160","19312380"," I'm going to play this. "
"19313320","19317380"," I'm going to work on AP and WMT for you."
"19323320","19324360"," What is that?"
"19324480","19325420"," Advanced auto parts."
"19330180","19334030"," How about S now?"
"19334990","19344930"," All right, let's go back to one"
"19344930","19345970"," page layout. "
"19349390","19351410"," Let's look at AP."
"19356690","19358290"," Advanced auto parts."
"19359030","19365110"," Let's see what we can see here. "
"19366190","19367110"," Pretty minute basis."
"19367610","19368510"," Advanced auto parts."
"19371130","19371850"," Juicy. "
"19374250","19376790"," Nvidia shares bucking today's downtrend."
"19377050","19380490"," Thanks to a bullish note from KeyBank, despite looming export control threats."
"19380850","19383250"," Christina Parton has more hypestina. "
"19384230","19384970"," Hi, contestant."
"19385290","19386070"," Let's start with those tests."
"19386870","19392270"," Chinese military and Chinese state researchers have reportedly purchased Nvidia AI chips despite a"
"19392270","19392990"," US ban. "
"19393230","19394010"," This according to Reuters."
"19394570","19398870"," Separately, the Financial Times reporting that because of those same US export bans that have been"
"19398870","19404650"," put in place in 2022, Chinese companies are resorting to stripping Nvidia gaming chips down to"
"19404650","19409130"," their actual core components before being installed on new circuit boards."
"19409910","19414890"," Both of these examples show case that China is using workarounds to tackle their lack of high-end"
"19414890","19418190"," AI chips, and actually highlights a looming risk for Nvidia. "
"19418630","19422230"," Further export controls from the US, especially since 2020."
"19422610","19425190"," All right, we're going to switch over quickly here."
"19425450","19427070"," We're going to look at a ticker. "
"19427070","19428850"," This ticker looks great, by the way."
"19430910","19432490"," So we're going to switch over."
"19432650","19436470"," Whoever requested these two tickers earlier, thanks for getting a shout out on these. "
"19437270","19440130"," So this is advanced auto parts here."
"19441450","19445550"," And I'm on a daily chart right now with advanced auto parts."
"19446490","19451690"," This is way back here in 2013, 2012, 2010. "
"19452710","19457630"," It's trying to take a look back here in time and see what it opened."
"19458010","19460470"," What I do want, what I like to see a lot of times."
"19463370","19468170"," So going back from COVID, right, this COVID run on every ticker out there. "
"19470230","19473830"," This trade here, I always like to see that trade go away."
"19476250","19477770"," This is the COVID trade."
"19478970","19479130"," Okay. "
"19480050","19485430"," And whenever I see a ticker, this is beginning back in December of 2020."
"19486250","19491130"," Did they roll over and did we get rid of the spec growth and all that kind of stuff and"
"19491130","19492430"," then advanced auto parts."
"19492930","19494930"," Kind of the same thing here. "
"19497150","19499870"," Now they had some continuation because of what?"
"19500990","19503410"," People are still doing their own repairs."
"19504490","19508510"," And this trade has now come back and has healed."
"19509350","19514330"," Which I like, but what I also want to show you about this is down below here. "
"19515370","19524310"," And what I really like about this ticker is the series of higher lows on the weekly."
"19525350","19529310"," And then the maxing out here on the monthly negative velocity."
"19530770","19532430"," Kind of peeking out here. "
"19532910","19535190"," And then quarterly velocity coming up a little bit too."
"19536000","19537470"," So all this looks great."
"19537970","19544470"," This is what you want to see for a major buy on a ticker. "
"19545250","19546230"," This is wonderful."
"19546570","19546950"," I like this."
"19547810","19549910"," So this is a good sign here to begin. "
"19551190","19551350"," Okay."
"19552070","19555550"," And then we're going to also look at the 30 minute chart here."
"19556810","19560790"," And another, what I like but don't like is the daily velocity. "
"19561750","19565270"," So a couple of things here would be."
"19566510","19572290"," I do like, I do like all of this work here that's been done."
"19572430","19574890"," I always like seeing this like sideways capitulation. "
"19575610","19576850"," But then more sideways."
"19577270","19579890"," The more time we spend flat, the better off we are."
"19580610","19584590"," Price is below the daily trigger, but it's trying to break above it. "
"19585610","19588690"," The weekly trigger is also flattening right now."
"19588690","19592790"," Do you see it like you have a stiff vertical and then a little bit of movement sideways."
"19593550","19596710"," Now we also now have price above the daily trigger. "
"19597430","19598270"," That's positive."
"19599210","19599350"," Okay."
"19599690","19603010"," Now we're still negative because the monthly trigger is way up here somewhere. "
"19603750","19607550"," But this is all very productive."
"19609430","19615670"," Now saying that the daily velocity right can can actually stay bullish longer."
"19617890","19618950"," Then you'd expect. "
"19620410","19625650"," So this isn't necessarily a cell signal on Velo, though we could get a little bit of a cell here."
"19625650","19627650"," It's at plus 30 right now."
"19629870","19636850"," But regardless, this is a nice ticker to be considering a move higher. "
"19637930","19647290"," And not only a move higher, but a target of 100 and I'd say 100 bucks in the next couple"
"19647290","19654850"," of months somewhere in here as a target, right?"
"19655170","19659050"," So you figure this could take a month or two, like one month right there, another month right"
"19659050","19663090"," there, three months right there, something up in here."
"19663950","19665930"," I think that's kind of conservative and reasonable."
"19665930","19670550"," Now there's a problem here and that is that we're not above the weekly trigger. "
"19672150","19675970"," And Dilly Velo is still a little hot right now."
"19676130","19678690"," We've got a lower high on Dilly Velo as well."
"19679250","19680510"," It looks like it's even Steven. "
"19681250","19686230"," So there could be a back test still here to contend with."
"19687750","19694990"," But being net positive here, just at home, you can probably just tag this here."
"19696190","19698210"," And be looking for an entry. "
"19698590","19700790"," So let's say it does go down here."
"19701770","19705350"," I'll be looking for that entry to fight all of this stuff up here."
"19706410","19714390"," So if you have a chance, snap a line at home, right click this line and add an alert, right?"
"19714530","19717090"," You can right click it, add an alert to trend line. "
"19718610","19724110"," You can do like crossing trend line to the downside of whatever you want to do or getting near or"
"19724110","19726850"," even raise this trend line slightly like right here."
"19727710","19731750"," So it'll give you a forewarning that you're heading down into it."
"19731870","19737010"," But even so, as long as we stay on trend here, I'm pretty fucking bullish on it. "
"19738270","19743110"," And if we break above, let's say we don't come down, we just break above here, right?"
"19746130","19747270"," Let's move this down."
"19747730","19748730"," Still pretty bullish here."
"19748730","19750610"," So let's see what we took out. "
"19750630","19752030"," We took out this one already."
"19753070","19755570"," So your next one is going to be somewhere above."
"19757570","19764760"," So your next upside target is $72 in here. "
"19766320","19768280"," One, two, and three, big push."
"19768980","19774460"," One, two, or one, two, and three, maybe, and that would be your next one right there."
"19783700","19786200"," And I think this one actually comes up. "
"19786440","19789360"," And that's where you're going to start to get your consolidation is in here."
"19792540","19802320"," And you're finally going to get that there like that too right"
"19802320","19802660"," there."
"19805220","19807380"," And that's where the big bad boys come in, right?"
"19810290","19811710"," Something like this here. "
"19812390","19815030"," And this is the juice over here."
"19815350","19815850"," This is gorgeous."
"19817070","19818930"," There ain't shit there, is there?"
"19823660","19825400"," And that's where it is right there. "
"19825760","19834560"," And maybe the cool part would be, the cool part about this is, here's your red right here."
"19834700","19838220"," This is the one where you want to say, we're going to sell there, right?"
"19838520","19840140"," But there's a killer here."
"19840480","19841520"," Not a killer, but a bull. "
"19842120","19843260"," Something here for the bulls."
"19844100","19852790"," You figure if the monthly trigger is coming down,"
"19853170","19870000"," make that"
"19870000","19870280"," blue."
"19873810","19875890"," Make that a line here. "
"19879610","19882750"," If price can jump back above up here, right?"
"19883930","19887030"," And you get that daily trigger up in here, right?"
"19887170","19889870"," So you get this nice, huge squeeze up here."
"19891150","19895050"," Then you come back down to consolidate and you can start to do this stuff."
"19895310","19896230"," It's going to be kind of insane. "
"19899230","19903310"," So I'm kind of looking for this huge squeeze up in here."
"19904970","19914510"," I don't know if that comes back down, but then this consolidation range is going to be huge in"
"19914510","19914690"," here."
"19915570","19919970"," But this one right here, this is some time out in late summer. "
"19920890","19925830"," Now we have probably have a role coming down for September in here, and then a push up higher in"
"19925830","19929210"," the end of the year, which would propel us quite high."
"19929410","19930470"," Let me take a look back here and see."
"19934970","19936470"," 150 end of the year target. "
"19937910","19938570"," Right there."
"19939390","19940330"," Just a move."
"19942830","19944670"," So there you go, if you want to see it. "
"19946090","19947990"," I'm bullish as all hell on AP."
"19948490","19950210"," By the way, we're squeezing up right now."
"19950310","19950970"," No, not quite yet. "
"19951750","19954810"," I'm pretty fucking bullish here on advanced auto parts."
"19956090","19957930"," 150 by end of year, possibly."
"19958310","19959770"," I'm trying to be conservative here. "
"19960550","19964170"," 110 for a summer run, 120 for a target for a summer run."
"19964530","19970510"," A September rollover and then a target of 150 into end of year on a AP."
"19973350","19977170"," Now, I will remember this 66.04 down here. "
"19979650","19982910"," If we get above the 66, this could happen quicker than sooner."
"19983330","19988510"," So let's say you squeeze above the weekly is if you can get that daily to come up, we can"
"19988510","19989790"," go straight up right here too."
"19990690","19991890"," So be looking for that. "
"19992030","19997310"," Any back check successful on a weekly and daily cross only when the cross happens."
"19998710","20000310"," Can be explosive."
"20001230","20002090"," Let me see here. "
"20002170","20003470"," Where's my drawing the shit over here."
"20005750","20008430"," And the initial move can be explosive too, okay?"
"20008650","20010370"," But this cross right here is going to be key."
"20011810","20013570"," So if you get this cross up here. "
"20015230","20017230"," And you get this cross right here."
"20020110","20021110"," And you get price."
"20021570","20023730"," This price will explode like boom. "
"20024830","20025890"," Come back down."
"20026730","20029490"," You could hit like that 80 bucks like it's nobody's business."
"20030070","20036050"," But that back check would be a confirmation of like by the fucking dip and just ride it. "
"20036510","20038890"," Own the underlying and ride it up."
"20039150","20043390"," This squeeze is nice for options, but for owning the stock."
"20043790","20044150"," I like it. "
"20044270","20045510"," I like the stock even right here."
"20046090","20046590"," I like it."
"20046710","20051670"," As long as you break, as long as you don't break trend and start rejecting like something like this"
"20051670","20053550"," and then break this shit back here. "
"20054470","20056270"," I'm a bull here in AAP."
"20056530","20057330"," Good shout out."
"20057430","20058390"," Whoever called the AAP. "
"20058870","20060330"," I like the stock a lot."
"20061150","20063790"," If you want to know, I really do like the stock a lot."
"20067520","20068620"," I love it a lot. "
"20073040","20073980"," It's a good stock."
"20074780","20079920"," A little bit of reversal here, but bears not getting it right now."
"20080060","20082900"," You can see right here that the bulls are taking this over. "
"20084240","20087080"," Bears unable to get back underneath right here."
"20087160","20088460"," This is not a good look for bears."
"20089400","20092120"," I would expect another move up into this half hour trigger. "
"20092400","20094840"," So bulls in charge currently in today."
"20096020","20099080"," Let's see if they can hold on to the bulls can hold on to it here."
"20102410","20106290"," I'll look at WMT next. "
"20110920","20113540"," In the background here, AAP love it."
"20113860","20114580"," Love the stock."
"20114920","20115180"," Love it. "
"20115300","20116360"," Love everything about it."
"20116360","20118960"," Love everything about everything about AAP."
"20119060","20121580"," If there was like a bull set up. "
"20122220","20123160"," I love it."
"20123800","20127100"," I don't know how long it takes for it to break above here, but."
"20127720","20133500"," If you get a deal at 50 bucks, $52 where like the market is bleeding. "
"20135080","20138020"," Take it or not financial advice."
"20140300","20141480"," That's what I would do."
"20143680","20144280"," Walmart. "
"20145780","20147920"," Oh, it looks like garbage."
"20152260","20153240"," It doesn't look like garbage."
"20156500","20159080"," My question would be what are you in for on Wal-Mart. "
"20160540","20161820"," Dividends are in 40."
"20162120","20164480"," Like what do you like Walmart for?"
"20169460","20171020"," He's selling puts against it."
"20172020","20173180"," I like that idea. "
"20175980","20177640"," There's some sellers up here."
"20177760","20178800"," They don't like you do they."
"20179820","20181040"," Do you want to do this with you?"
"20182360","20183740"," Oh, yeah, maybe come on down. "
"20184720","20185400"," Come on down."
"20185480","20186500"," Let's take a Walmart really quick."
"20186640","20187360"," Let's take a look at Walmart. "
"20187620","20189420"," Let's do a team as Walmart."
"20191060","20196100"," Let me show you a ticker that doesn't look like AAP."
"20196600","20197080"," That's Walmart. "
"20204560","20207120"," You can see they're selling into you."
"20208800","20216940"," It reminds me a lot of Amazon now saying that about Amazon."
"20217540","20227440"," Another thing that Amazon does is it'll trade a range and then auto trade a new range. "
"20228320","20232820"," This is a benefit for Walmart."
"20233300","20235840"," This looks like Amazon to me."
"20236640","20242680"," What happens with these tickers is you spend a lot of fucking time on a level. "
"20243180","20245660"," Then they move you up and then they trade that level."
"20246120","20248340"," Even if we come down they come back up and trade it again."
"20248940","20250640"," We have that explosive move here. "
"20252020","20253500"," Explosive move here, right?"
"20253780","20255280"," But then this consolidation phase."
"20255500","20261600"," This is like your local financial advisor office."
"20262200","20263780"," We bought the dip and we sold it. "
"20263780","20264640"," We bought the dip."
"20264820","20265400"," We sold it."
"20265500","20266200"," We bought the dip. "
"20266360","20266760"," We sold it."
"20266820","20267360"," We bought the dip."
"20267460","20274840"," This is like a wet dream for your local office, right?"
"20275000","20276020"," Just works and works and works. "
"20276500","20278340"," Now there is a little bit of a difference here, right?"
"20280020","20283880"," Looks like they're trying to trade a new range, right?"
"20284420","20285780"," They sold you down right here."
"20286700","20287980"," Then they bought it again immediately."
"20288640","20290380"," They bought it again immediately here. "
"20290560","20290960"," That's unusual."
"20290960","20291180"," Unusual."
"20291760","20293480"," All this kind of stuff right here. "
"20294120","20298660"," It looks to me like they're trying to reprice Walmart higher."
"20300600","20302120"," That's a positive for you."
"20302500","20305840"," Now on a daily basis there is something to watch here. "
"20306800","20311440"," What I don't like about Walmart here is this right here."
"20311540","20317120"," I don't like seeing this quarterly velocity maxing out."
"20317120","20326720"," I don't like seeing the, just call on me right now. "
"20329720","20335000"," I don't like seeing, let me get this right here going for you."
"20335620","20343100"," I don't like seeing monthly velocity going down while price really has."
"20343340","20344840"," There is some of this down here. "
"20345220","20346840"," I guess it could be associated with it."
"20347480","20351360"," There is a slight rise over here for this stuff over here."
"20352220","20355500"," I don't like seeing this weekly so high. "
"20355940","20360340"," If we come back down over here, you can see some real fucking blood like this stuff over here."
"20361420","20362380"," You see that?"
"20362660","20364460"," You see in that happen right there?"
"20365020","20367100"," You see in this peeking out right here."
"20368300","20369500"," Then it comes down there. "
"20369880","20371260"," There's a part here."
"20371420","20372460"," This is 2016."
"20372460","20376560"," Let's go back and look and see what happened in 2016. "
"20376720","20378080"," You see that right there?"
"20378300","20379680"," This like capitulate?"
"20380000","20381480"," See how this looks familiar?"
"20382420","20383540"," Looks familiar, right?"
"20385660","20386640"," Doesn't that look familiar?"
"20386980","20388420"," It looks kind of similar, doesn't it?"
"20390220","20393300"," Trying to break up, but then we come straight back down."
"20393460","20394380"," It's a bloodbath, right?"
"20395400","20397400"," Something similar going on over here, right?"
"20397740","20397920"," See it?"
"20397920","20409440"," Yeah, you might have some bullishness, but then the result is this looks"
"20409440","20415200"," like exit liquidity for Walmart and then a bloodbath, straight violent bloodbath to the downside."
"20418580","20420760"," What are my expectations on?"
"20424240","20429860"," Let's make expectations here on 117. "
"20430660","20432040"," They bought the dip on 117."
"20433360","20434400"," Trade in 160."
"20437600","20438540"," What is that?"
"20439160","20440160"," 240 or so?"
"20440960","20442780"," I'm assuming that's your expectation. "
"20443120","20444820"," We're going to trade 240 or something like that."
"20446900","20450820"," Or at least 220, right?"
"20451140","20452600"," What was the put dip by down here?"
"20456080","20456480"," 240?"
"20456960","20457500"," That's what I'm assuming."
"20457880","20463550"," You think we're going to trade that before whatever that role is. "
"20463690","20464070"," That's possible."
"20464930","20466210"," It's possible we can trade that."
"20470620","20472440"," You know, you have 200 up there. "
"20472620","20473400"," That's going to be a problem."
"20474760","20478860"," Not a problem, but that's going to be an auto cell no matter what right there."
"20488090","20489750"," Let's look on the 30 minute chart. "
"20490070","20491650"," It's not as nice as AAP."
"20492890","20493990"," I'll be honest with you."
"20494010","20494530"," It's not as nice. "
"20500790","20501970"," I would say this."
"20505670","20507750"," You can keep trading new highs."
"20507910","20509230"," There's a 30 minute chart right here. "
"20509750","20510790"," That's bullish right now."
"20511550","20512610"," Walmart is bullish right now."
"20512990","20513950"," It's above its hourly trigger. "
"20515290","20517510"," On an intraday basis, I'm not anti."
"20518590","20520230"," You can tell there's sellers here."
"20520510","20521390"," We already know that, right?"
"20522110","20523030"," You already see that, right?"
"20523190","20525270"," They're fucking, they stepped right in like sell here. "
"20525610","20526330"," Sell here."
"20527210","20527890"," Big sell in here."
"20528010","20529910"," They're telling you, fuck, you know, we're not going up there. "
"20531070","20532910"," You're able to get a new high right here."
"20533590","20536390"," And you're kind of grinding, looking to trade that right there."
"20538070","20544870"," If you're trying to target 200 and 240, I would say to you that you have to, you don't have"
"20544870","20545190"," a choice. "
"20547310","20550070"," You have to trade on this trend."
"20550910","20552950"," You have to trade this right here."
"20555580","20559880"," Even if it sells off, you need to trade that to stay alive. "
"20581340","20583200"," I think you actually fail this."
"20597110","20600470"," There is some concern here that you're not going to get it, though."
"20600650","20610560"," Anyway, if you do, yeah, it's right back"
"20610560","20611040"," down there. "
"20617290","20618130"," There's that 200."
"20618610","20627060"," I don't know why it's not showing up on this 30 minute, but it's possible you keep grinding this"
"20627060","20627260"," up."
"20627460","20628880"," You're giving your above the hourly trigger. "
"20628880","20629940"," You're above the weekly trigger."
"20632540","20634180"," This is all positive."
"20638300","20639440"," Twenty twenty five. "
"20639720","20642320"," I'd be really concerned here in twenty twenty six."
"20643920","20645700"," Of a major fucking rule."
"20646980","20648560"," I don't know where this top is. "
"20648560","20649200"," I don't know if that's."
"20649400","20652920"," I don't know if you're going to make that run a 200 to 40."
"20653400","20658100"," Whatever that run is, though, is going to result in a major bloodbath in my view. "
"20659740","20660640"," Walmart's going to have a crash."
"20662400","20663940"," I just don't know when it takes place."
"20665760","20666980"," I don't know if it's now. "
"20667300","20668100"," I don't know if it's later."
"20668420","20674260"," I'm going to give you a warning, though, that in my view, find out what happened in two thousand"
"20674260","20674740"," sixteen."
"20677460","20680400"," Let me unmute my thing here. "
"20682680","20683960"," What I would say to you is this."
"20684560","20686140"," If you're a Walmart trader."
"20688640","20689720"," Find out what happened. "
"20690740","20691840"," I'll even give you a date."
"20698060","20699840"," Find out what happened in two."
"20700040","20701880"," I'm trying to think of what it was that happened, but. "
"20706620","20707400"," We find out."
"20707540","20708580"," Let's look it up right now."
"20708640","20709060"," We'll get up together. "
"20712120","20712760"," January."
"20713500","20715640"," January 13th, 2015."
"20717560","20719520"," January 15th, 2015. "
"20720360","20721320"," Find out what happened."
"20723080","20724800"," To Walmart specifically."
"20727240","20729420"," I see something like that happening again. "
"20730300","20731740"," I don't like this right here."
"20732040","20732540"," I don't like that."
"20732640","20735480"," I don't like that fucking selling on the November 15th. "
"20735480","20737980"," I don't care what it was earnings, some kind of news."
"20738940","20741460"," I probably see something similar happening again."
"20746000","20749760"," Yeah, it's tough here on. "
"20751380","20752700"," Walmart's a weird one."
"20753960","20757320"," You want to target to buy it at on trend."
"20758600","20759680"," One fifty five. "
"20760280","20762640"," The next buy on it is one fifty five."
"20763000","20764640"," Maybe one fifty six."
"20766320","20769260"," Ninety three one fifty five one fifty three ninety six. "
"20769520","20771140"," Clean this up a little bit."
"20781680","20786540"," I'm bullish midterm on on on Walmart, but."
"20787280","20790340"," It looks like exit liquidity, and I don't know the reason for it. "
"20793620","20800460"," Yeah, so I would wait to when we get to one fifty five on Walmart, then decide if you want"
"20800460","20802740"," to take a trade on Walmart."
"20803260","20804660"," I think there's better tickers out there."
"20804720","20805040"," I'll be honest. "
"20805960","20806900"," Just looking at it."
"20807060","20809080"," Like looking at this versus AAP."
"20810100","20812360"," I'd pick AAP all day long and not. "
"20813560","20815580"," I pick AAP all day long over."
"20816680","20817120"," Walmart."
"20818700","20821820"," And I don't know what that news is going to be, but there will be news. "
"20822200","20824520"," There'll be something Walmart has in its future."
"20825660","20828120"," Some bad news coming, and I don't know what it is."
"20830680","20832160"," Downside target on that would be. "
"20836080","20839960"," What I didn't have a downside target on that or when it comes, you could get."
"20840800","20841780"," Hold on a second here."
"20842540","20844560"," It would be like two hundred down to. "
"20846660","20848840"," You'd be you'd be shorting it from like two hundred."
"20850060","20853460"," But what would I be looking for on WMT?"
"20856840","20859420"," Let's say it trades two hundred bucks to forty."
"20867840","20868640"," Eighty six. "
"20870800","20871980"," A hundred bucks."
"20873560","20875600"," I'm going to put out a firm one hundred."
"20876360","20879180"," It's a pretty big drop, but I don't think it's here or there. "
"20879300","20880360"," I don't think we're there right now."
"20883950","20886150"," This looks like actual liquidity for this ticker."
"20887050","20889190"," Oh, that beats time to play out. "
"20892310","20893850"," Nothing actionable that I can see."
"20898570","20900430"," Is there something that I don't know about Walmart?"
"20900710","20902550"," Maybe one of you guys that follows it more closely."
"20903430","20910430"," If you're in Walmart long term and we get that thing that happens in the marketplace, get the fuck"
"20910430","20911070"," on out of Walmart. "
"20914510","20915270"," I'd be selling."
"20915790","20918050"," It'd be a seller in a big way."
"20929340","20933720"," Yeah, I'd like to own Walmart at like hundred bucks, eighty five dollars. "
"20934580","20939220"," I don't know if that pisses off a bull out there, but we have to talk about Tesla too."
"20939720","20942280"," They have a gap that still isn't sold at ninety six."
"20943460","20948280"," And they have a gap at sixty six dollars or something like that. "
"20948280","20953800"," I don't know the exact numbers that we look at them, but there's some pretty big gaps for Tesla to"
"20953800","20955040"," fill to the downside still."
"20956240","20957120"," Still unfilled."
"20967500","20970860"," Yeah, there's a good there's a prime example to Costco. "
"20971960","20978140"," Any guys remember someone said it on Twitter this week and I was like, Oh, I forgot all about that."
"20978580","20980420"," There was like a whole Costco gang."
"20981320","20982900"," They got fucking annihilated. "
"20982900","20984420"," You guys remember that shit?"
"20984660","20987220"," Like there was like a long term year over year."
"20987660","20989580"," Like Costco was the shit."
"20989860","20994720"," Oh, I think it was Jedi Marcus mentioned something and I was like, Yeah, I remember that those days"
"20994720","20997060"," and they got fucking annihilated. "
"20997760","21004180"," I think Walmart's in a similar predicament like that ramp, like one more exit liquidity ramp and"
"21004180","21005900"," then fucking destroyed."
"21006700","21008660"," There's definitely an exit here somewhere for Walmart."
"21009700","21011540"," And I don't know what the reasoning is. "
"21016400","21017920"," If Tesla dropped that much."
"21018200","21018920"," Oh, I think that's easy."
"21019340","21020240"," I think Tesla can easily. "
"21020840","21023120"," You gotta remember stock splits, right?"
"21023660","21027880"," You guys understand that or whenever someone says that too, I realize that they haven't been in"
"21027880","21028840"," Tesla for a long time."
"21031000","21034260"," Tesla going to sixty or ninety bucks is not cheap at all."
"21034840","21036220"," At all, not cheap. "
"21037320","21038900"," Tesla's split so many times."
"21039980","21041740"," Sixty to ninety bucks is easy."
"21042000","21042860"," Not easy. "
"21043440","21043800"," Easy."
"21044700","21048620"," Anyone that tells you that it's not easy to hit sixty or ninety, Tesla's out of their fucking"
"21048620","21048860"," minds."
"21050380","21054220"," So just be aware that there are people in Tesla that split so many fucking times. "
"21054660","21056300"," They're so up on you, maybe."
"21056880","21059180"," You know, you might have only bought Tesla for the first time."
"21059700","21060620"," Let's say at a hundred bucks. "
"21060620","21062420"," You're like, I just got it at a hundred dollars, right?"
"21063100","21064340"," On their last capitulation."
"21065680","21068460"," Tesla going down to like sixty bucks, ninety bucks."
"21068740","21069120"," Easy. "
"21069940","21070420"," Easy."
"21071300","21073120"," Not even a blink of the eye could be done."
"21075780","21076820"," It's all those splits. "
"21077420","21077680"," Oh, yeah."
"21079900","21082300"," It's outsized effect on other EV stocks."
"21083220","21086560"," No, I think Tesla can trade just on its own. "
"21087360","21088380"," Tesla can do its own."
"21088580","21090460"," We've seen Tesla trade on its own."
"21090500","21091020"," How many times?"
"21092240","21094380"," I think that's an easy thing for Tesla to do. "
"21094600","21098080"," I'm on board and I don't think it impacts Rivian and like you think it does."
"21098340","21099640"," Like those kind of moves."
"21099980","21100120"," Tesla. "
"21100740","21103200"," I wouldn't even blink and see Tesla wake up one morning."
"21103200","21105620"," If I saw Tesla at ninety bucks, I wouldn't be shocked."
"21106320","21107660"," I wouldn't be shocked at sixty dollars. "
"21108400","21109400"," I wouldn't even blink."
"21109760","21111580"," I'd be like, oh, that looks normal to me."
"21116240","21117080"," It's looking good here. "
"21117220","21120600"," Looking bullish, you guys getting good action here on this is all looks really beautiful here."
"21120600","21121100"," It's looking good."
"21121720","21122520"," See if you can keep it up. "
"21127720","21128260"," Walmart."
"21128680","21129320"," Excellent liquidity."
"21129580","21129980"," Surely. "
"21130260","21130520"," Tesla."
"21131460","21134940"," It does impact other EV stocks, but not like quite like you think."
"21136280","21142960"," Tesla can make some really nasty nasty fucking violent moves where it does trade outside of"
"21142960","21145300"," everything else or an experience it can. "
"21149840","21153620"," Now, I know they have a fact outside effects other EV companies, but not quite like."
"21154480","21157020"," Not quite like what their impact is in themselves."
"21157600","21162680"," Like there's a moment where Tesla can trade right against everything out there. "
"21162920","21164080"," We've seen it right past few weeks."
"21164140","21164600"," We've seen it."
"21165300","21167380"," Tesla didn't join in the party with anything else. "
"21168600","21169860"," Everyone's angry about it."
"21169900","21172600"," And I'm like, why are you angry?"
"21172860","21175920"," Like we still have got we should we look for the gaps right now?"
"21176200","21176740"," We're gonna go look at it."
"21176820","21177420"," Look for him with me. "
"21179540","21180640"," Let's go look at him."
"21182140","21183840"," I'm interested in looking at him."
"21187400","21189480"," Let's look at Tesla on a daily chart. "
"21190460","21191680"," See if we can find him."
"21194980","21196760"," Like gaps Tesla's not closed yet."
"21203130","21204410"," There we go right there. "
"21205370","21207110"," Here's a giant fucker right here."
"21216220","21217600"," That one is not been closed."
"21218860","21220860"," And here's the last bad boy right here. "
"21220860","21224820"," Oh, there's one left down here."
"21229570","21231030"," You got one right here."
"21236780","21238240"," It even takes years. "
"21238560","21239460"," There's another one down here."
"21241400","21243580"," Little tiny one right there."
"21247820","21250220"," And there's a little itty bitty one right here. "
"21251240","21252420"," Look at how low this is."
"21252540","21256040"," Can you imagine Tesla at 20 bucks?"
"21258630","21260690"," Can you imagine $20 on Tesla?"
"21261270","21263430"," We look at all these gaps here that haven't been filled."
"21270250","21272050"," They're tiny, but they're there. "
"21275950","21279750"," And this is really what I was thinking about Ewan."
"21279910","21283110"," When Ewan's out there talking to you about and let's look."
"21283270","21285090"," Let me go over here for a minute trigger full screen. "
"21285290","21285430"," Okay."
"21286230","21288950"," So let's just take a look at Tesla here right?"
"21290310","21293330"," That's the biggest that's the biggest defender right there."
"21293830","21296270"," And look what it's coming into right now. "
"21296270","21298190"," And look what it's coming into it's quarterly trigger right."
"21300230","21301890"," It's six months trigger down here."
"21303830","21306230"," So let me ask you that question as a bull. "
"21307790","21309530"," Let me ask you that question if you."
"21311350","21313370"," If you had something like this right."
"21314170","21316670"," And all of a sudden the board approves. "
"21317250","21321230"," Elon to take on a hundred thousand shares."
"21322550","21323010"," Right."
"21323170","21325910"," Wouldn't that be by the time that happened you're down there. "
"21327650","21328970"," And there you go."
"21329170","21329190"," Right."
"21329310","21331090"," You close the gap the real true gap down there. "
"21332150","21333150"," You're off and running."
"21335630","21338070"," You know you on gets million shares."
"21339630","21341030"," And he's what?"
"21341270","21342410"," What has he done at that point?"
"21343050","21344250"," He's bought Twitter. "
"21345510","21345830"," Right."
"21346070","21347550"," He's effectively bought Twitter."
"21347550","21351530"," And he's now where he wants to be with with Tesla. "
"21352450","21354250"," So whenever I say things like."
"21354630","21357230"," Like whenever I see like what Elon was doing."
"21358950","21363170"," My biggest thought to Elon is when like when he was coming out and saying this weekend. "
"21363870","21368350"," I was like I was like he fucking thinks the fucking stocks go in a fucking 60 bucks."
"21368650","21369110"," 80 bucks."
"21370730","21373750"," Someone's told him that and he's gauging other. "
"21375450","21377850"," Investors smart people people smarter than me."
"21378610","21380550"," People with more inside information than me."
"21381490","21387110"," And he's probably got somebody out there in inside or telling him hey start this process now. "
"21388350","21390210"," So that by the time we get there."
"21391310","21395010"," You're buying Tesla like here or they're giving you Tesla way down there."
"21399030","21401650"," So yeah I think 80 bucks or 90 bucks. "
"21401910","21403130"," Wouldn't even blink if that happened."
"21403130","21409280"," And you could even say you could even say to yourself."
"21411400","21412820"," He could buy it down there. "
"21413060","21413100"," Right."
"21413880","21415060"," I mean think about it from this perspective."
"21415320","21415440"," Right. "
"21417760","21419060"," Look at this perspective."
"21419400","21421260"," You can you finally say yes to Elon."
"21421800","21424040"," He gets his he gets his stock options. "
"21424040","21424480"," Right."
"21424860","21425340"," For his shares."
"21427580","21429340"," By the time that happens. "
"21429560","21430180"," It's a bloodbath."
"21433810","21434290"," Right."
"21443920","21445380"," By the time that happens. "
"21445560","21446140"," It's a bloodbath."
"21446420","21448040"," Elon scoops up all these shares."
"21449300","21449900"," Right. "
"21450860","21453240"," He gets to enjoy a run and Tesla."
"21453580","21454240"," A major run."
"21454500","21457060"," Like huge huge run and Tesla. "
"21457880","21459240"," He sells into Tesla."
"21459920","21464580"," And then we have a major market crash in 26 and 28."
"21465460","21468780"," And you guys tell me that you're never going to see Tesla at $20. "
"21469360","21475040"," If you look back on the tech bubble in 2000 right."
"21475720","21477380"," What was Amazon going for?"
"21477500","21478660"," What was Apple going for?"
"21478800","21480060"," I think Apple was going for six bucks."
"21481340","21482920"," Back then when it was that it's low. "
"21483060","21484220"," It could be wrong in the exact price."
"21484220","21486720"," But I think I remember correctly it was somewhere down there."
"21487420","21490020"," So when you tell me like you can't see Tesla at. "
"21491100","21491560"," Twenty."
"21493720","21495860"," Yeah, you can definitely."
"21497000","21499940"," Even with him and even with him as the CEO or the. "
"21502680","21504780"," As you can see him as anything does nothing."
"21506260","21507200"," Chairman of the board."
"21507200","21509060"," I guess if he had all those shares, I guess. "
"21511640","21513720"," But even so, it doesn't matter."
"21514560","21518760"," You could still see Tesla trade in twenty twenty nine twenty twenty eight."
"21519020","21519760"," Twenty bucks. "
"21520080","21521120"," You could see it trade 80."
"21521800","21523680"," For a huge massive run."
"21525720","21527920"," In twenty twenty six or twenty twenty four. "
"21528020","21528400"," Excuse me."
"21528720","21531220"," And possibly twenty twenty six twenty twenty five."
"21531220","21531700"," Excuse me. "
"21532440","21533820"," So big Tesla run."
"21534620","21535760"," At a nice cheap price."
"21536400","21537480"," Big old fat run. "
"21537700","21539460"," And then you can see this major roll down."
"21540500","21541800"," For the entire market."
"21542620","21544760"," You know, if we are at the end of a of a dead cycle. "
"21547280","21548760"," I wouldn't blink at all."
"21549060","21550100"," See, I wouldn't blink at all."
"21550100","21552660"," If we go if we have that ramp that if we have that like. "
"21553500","21557160"," That two thousand style ramp where we have obscene prices."
"21557880","21561880"," And then we have obscenely low prices at the end of it."
"21562860","21564640"," With a generational buying opportunity. "
"21566140","21566640"," I wouldn't blink."
"21567120","21572340"," That shit wouldn't shock me in the for the least to watch like a $80 by $100 by."
"21573340","21574760"," Twenty dollar by. "
"21576480","21577980"," He gets approved."
"21578200","21578520"," He buys."
"21579680","21580800"," They give him the shares. "
"21581540","21582440"," Nice fat run."
"21583260","21584180"," Nice fat."
"21584500","21585560"," Crazy bull. "
"21586500","21588240"," Insano run into twenty six."
"21588780","21590220"," Housing market starts to fail."
"21590420","21591780"," Regional banks start to fail. "
"21592180","21592920"," He exits."
"21593880","21596120"," Then he's down at twenty dollars scooping it all up again."
"21597180","21598520"," Would not shock me at all. "
"21605770","21607590"," Yeah, well, I don't even wonder."
"21607770","21608550"," I would look back."
"21608770","21612930"," If you're going to compare Tesla in price, I would look back on Apple. "
"21613450","21617310"," They're probably the closest comparable to that."
"21617650","21620270"," And it kind of is in line with what he's saying too, right?"
"21622190","21625430"," I mean, Steve Jobs, right?"
"21625830","21627350"," You want Steve Jobs to stick around."
"21629090","21632090"," You know, what do we move on to a Tim Apple type situation?"
"21633950","21634990"," We're replacing. "
"21638670","21644010"," So if you're a Tesla bull, the only thing that I can say to you."
"21645250","21647210"," Is you buy the major lows."
"21648590","21649210"," Right?"
"21650330","21650810"," All along. "
"21651650","21653930"," Now you don't buy all the tops and shit."
"21654290","21655390"," Early marks on clothes."
"21655630","21656870"," You buy the major lows. "
"21657250","21657910"," One spot."
"21658230","21659770"," Seven billion to the south side."
"21659770","21660390"," Ooh, here we go. "
"21660550","21661310"," One point seven billion."
"21661930","21663050"," Where's our trader podcast?"
"21664710","21666190"," So you buy those major lows."
"21666350","21667950"," You buy all of them. "
"21668810","21672450"," You know, so if you're like buying the, if you bought the hundred dollars, if you buy the eighty"
"21672450","21672930"," dollars."
"21673870","21674970"," Those are the ones that we buying."
"21675190","21677350"," If you're looking long term, twenty years on Tesla. "
"21679110","21682470"," Whenever I see people out there saying they buy all the tops and shit, I'm like, they're out of"
"21682470","21683010"," their fucking minds."
"21683250","21685950"," If you're, you're twenty year, thirty year investor in Tesla."
"21686610","21688790"," Matter of fact, how old of a company is Tesla?"
"21689790","21691990"," It's almost twenty years old now, right?"
"21692790","21693950"," Now they're not a startup. "
"21695130","21697490"," So if you're looking for that second phase of Tesla."
"21698730","21700450"," Another twenty years or something."
"21702070","21704390"," That wouldn't surprise me at all. "
"21705190","21706330"," I wouldn't, I wouldn't be shocked."
"21714620","21715600"," I like Tim Apple."
"21716400","21717240"," I got no beef with Tim. "
"21717380","21719020"," I don't got no beef with Tim Apple."
"21719440","21721980"," Ask person coming in for Tesla either."
"21721980","21723660"," I'd be fine with that too. "
"21724360","21725120"," It's normal."
"21725520","21730800"," Like normally you start out with, you're normal like, when you have a startup, right?"
"21731640","21733560"," As a matter of fact, even myself."
"21734580","21736160"," Give me any kind of startup, right?"
"21736900","21741900"," You normally run with your original CEO is normally the founder, right?"
"21742120","21744420"," And that founder is the visionary, right?"
"21744560","21745040"," For what you're doing. "
"21745620","21749760"," And then when you get into becoming a, a mature company."
"21750800","21760180"," You look for a CEO or CEO that can take you to that, that stabilized next phase of a company."
"21760860","21762520"," It's not abnormal to do stuff like that. "
"21763060","21766860"," And he's asking you over the weekend that same stuff like, hey, do you want more growth?"
"21767140","21768300"," You want to stay a startup company?"
"21768720","21769380"," You want to stay with AI?"
"21769640","21772800"," Do you want to stay building robots and all that stuff within Tesla?"
"21773140","21775920"," If so, me to renegotiate."
"21776800","21779520"," Now you might be saying out there, no fuck you."
"21779520","21780620"," We renegotiated, right?"
"21780740","21781920"," We were negotiating already with you. "
"21782900","21786320"," So you stick around as that, but he's coming back and."
"21787320","21788730"," Opening the door to a renegotiation."
"21789620","21790660"," You don't have to like that. "
"21791040","21792400"," You don't have to agree with that."
"21792820","21793900"," You can go another direction."
"21795020","21798200"," I'm sure there's other board members right now that are scared death. "
"21799240","21801620"," Of that too, his family and friends."
"21802580","21805720"," But him doing that is something he can do."
"21806000","21807720"," And I can understand that. "
"21809060","21812920"," And what would happen if he did leave or get voted off the island?"
"21814200","21816880"," You'd see the stock price get fucking annihilated."
"21816940","21819060"," We know that right until they brought in at a map."
"21820340","21822180"," You'd see the price get annihilated. "
"21824080","21826380"," The initial reaction would be really bad."
"21827380","21831180"," Now, the long term price of that stock is still going to go to the moon."
"21831180","21836720"," It's still going to go, you know, the actual price of a chair of Tesla should go to 60,000"
"21836720","21839160"," per share and craziness that you're talking about. "
"21839340","21840220"," I'm on board that."
"21840760","21845740"," I know if I, if I bring a chart back and I look 20 years from today."
"21846560","21847840"," It's going to be in the fucking moon. "
"21848500","21849680"," None of this is going to matter."
"21852560","21857260"," But I don't think that's out of the realm of discussion at all."
"21858200","21859920"," Not $10 right now, but. "
"21861620","21863500"," If we saw 80 in March."
"21864720","21865760"," I wouldn't even blink."
"21866340","21867740"," Like, yeah, it looks right right there. "
"21868800","21869920"," And let's buy it."
"21875980","21882560"," Yeah, yeah, if you are, if you if Elon is around, you do want Elon and you want him to"
"21882560","21887880"," stare that like career load just said if you're a testable, then you want Elon free to stare up the"
"21887880","21890460"," creative direction of their next step leap like he always has."
"21890660","21891600"," I agree with that statement. "
"21892620","21893800"," But if you don't."
"21895060","21897020"," Right, if you if you don't want that."
"21898900","21900320"," You want to become that. "
"21901340","21902660"," No more growth company."
"21903080","21904220"," You're looking for a 10 apple."
"21904520","21906060"," Looking for someone that can steer the ship. "
"21906780","21908980"," You are looking for somebody that's not going to make any waves."
"21909220","21911100"," Looking for somebody that's not going to be a problem."
"21911440","21912180"," Any of that kind of stuff. "
"21913840","21916880"," Now that will reprice the company right after not in the growth phase."
"21917700","21919160"," That would reprice Tesla."
"21921740","21923180"," Oh, come on down, daddy. "
"21923400","21923820"," Give me the money."
"21924680","21925520"," Come on down there."
"21925600","21926020"," Give it to me. "
"21926660","21927860"," Come on down there."
"21927920","21928540"," Sell that clothes."
"21930480","21931860"," Sell that clothes for daddy. "
"21940300","21941960"," You know, and I only look at that stuff."
"21942140","21945060"," I'll be honest with you guys as a Tesla bull, right?"
"21946620","21948160"," I just see it as the gift."
"21949160","21950420"," I just see it as the gift. "
"21950620","21951280"," I'll be honest with you."
"21951280","21953580"," I see it as the gift."
"21953880","21955800"," Like if I can buy a Tesla at 80 bucks. "
"21956140","21958240"," I can buy Tesla at 10 bucks or 20 bucks."
"21958840","21962280"," I'm looking at it for my kids like fucking buy and hold for life."
"21964640","21968100"," Whenever I see bulls out, some bulls out there like whoo. "
"21968180","21969380"," I'm like, yeah, it's not a 10 by."
"21971120","21975620"," I want to be wooing from 80, 100, 10, 20."
"21976580","21977920"," That's when I do the wooing, right?"
"21978400","21979220"," This is when we're down there. "
"21979320","21979840"," It feels good."
"21979840","21982900"," No, no feeling like it feels fucking phenomenal."
"21983500","21984360"," No sweat. "
"21984600","21984960"," No rush."
"21985260","21986160"," No care in the world."
"21995290","21996510"," What are you saying there?"
"21996670","21999810"," Tim Appel would replace Appel would please the libs. "
"21999990","22003930"," You know, I don't think Elon's liberal or Republican."
"22003930","22009870"," I think he's just profit driven from the perspective of a corporate."
"22011870","22012050"," Corporate. "
"22012750","22013910"," It's oligarch."
"22015250","22019030"," So my view on Elon is you guys want my view."
"22019550","22021210"," I think I've said this before. "
"22023390","22029370"," Elon, you see things and he's like giving you the opportunity saying you want to get off planet."
"22030530","22031410"," It's not just Elon."
"22031650","22034150"," There's some really smart people out there that are like, look, here's the deal. "
"22034950","22036750"," Once we come into the singularity."
"22038070","22039710"," This is my thesis as well."
"22039710","22047410"," Once we come into the singularity, if if we have not somehow been integrated with AI and robotics,"
"22047410","22050130"," we will get annihilated. "
"22050490","22051550"," We will not survive."
"22052750","22053890"," That singularity."
"22054350","22054830"," We will not. "
"22055110","22060890"," We don't we don't incorporate our bodies into that singularity."
"22060990","22062130"," We will be destroyed."
"22062430","22067350"," We have to we need a reason for them to keep us around basically my thesis. "
"22068110","22069110"," I think that's his too."
"22069710","22076370"," And I think his first thought was, and many others was to try to escape that eventuality."
"22076730","22078230"," We try to escape Earth. "
"22078750","22082330"," And that sounds crazy to you, but you try to give humans another chance."
"22083370","22088510"," To either escape that happening or be able to fight that happening from somewhere else."
"22088890","22089470"," Does that make sense?"
"22090930","22094770"," Now that's like a that's like a hedge against humanity. "
"22095530","22097270"," It's not a hedge against nation states."
"22097650","22101730"," It's a hedge against the singularity that's going to take place or likely will take place."
"22103030","22107510"," Brought on by nation states that allow this out of the box too much. "
"22108230","22109650"," That's actually how it should happen."
"22110150","22116570"," A country or a corporation will let it out or not have the control they thought they had."
"22116750","22117550"," You won't notice it. "
"22117650","22118430"," I won't notice it."
"22118930","22120070"," And you'll see the end of humankind."
"22120890","22123430"," And I think his original thought was, let's try to get off world. "
"22123430","22130730"," His second thought was also, let's try to incorporate ourselves into AI and robotics, right?"
"22131170","22134430"," You've got the miniaturization of a computer in your hand like a phone."
"22134750","22136530"," It gets smaller and smaller and smaller."
"22137070","22142150"," Eventually it sits in glasses or contacts and eventually it gets implanted into you. "
"22143230","22143430"," Okay."
"22144090","22146050"," So you can you can have a fighting chance."
"22146210","22151430"," So when you see when he's doing all this other work with boring, when you see work being done with"
"22151430","22151870"," implants. "
"22152530","22154390"," That's, that's stage two."
"22154890","22155910"," Here's stage three."
"22157010","22158190"," This is the gross part. "
"22158990","22164870"," Someone just commented on Libs would like Tim Apple as the CEO."
"22165710","22166810"," There's another part to this."
"22167810","22169730"," And this is where I think Elon thinks. "
"22170570","22172530"," Elon's got those two, three thoughts, right?"
"22173110","22174590"," Then he's got the whore master thought."
"22175510","22183030"," And this is the thought where, where you might your brain say, we might fail going to Mars."
"22183330","22184630"," We might fail with integration. "
"22185210","22190730"," We might fail with, with, with being able to protect ourselves on earth."
"22190730","22197890"," We might fail with chip implants or robotics, robotic implants, believe it or not, right?"
"22198490","22204050"," Or chip implants where we become symbiotic with, with artificial intelligence, right?"
"22204310","22207890"," And our brains and stuff are working alongside our official intelligence with all that fails."
"22208410","22215410"," You look towards Rome or you look towards Babylon and you say, well, fuck it, let's party. "
"22216490","22223890"," And if that's the case, we're just going to party and become heathens and debauchery and grossness."
"22224750","22225250"," What do you do?"
"22226330","22227590"," You create an everything app."
"22228250","22232270"," You create your own kingdom where you're powerful. "
"22232810","22236170"," You're more powerful than a country or a nation state."
"22237510","22242030"," So, and this is where the dumbness of our government comes into play for all of this tech."
"22242590","22244050"," So what you do is you create an everything app. "
"22244190","22252110"," You create an X and you would have your own Fife them where you have power and control stronger"
"22252110","22255630"," than a nation state as this process takes over."
"22255750","22262970"," And you see other companies doing this at the same time."
"22262970","22266310"," China is doing it right now with their VR worlds and their companies. "
"22266830","22269050"," You see it with Google, you see it with Apple."
"22269690","22271630"," Everyone's creating their own Fife them."
"22271770","22276030"," Their own like virtual worlds. "
"22277510","22283570"," Like a virtual kingdom or a virtual government that they want you to become a part of."
"22284670","22285030"," Right?"
"22285250","22287670"," So they got to pick a side to in the politics for all that stuff, right?"
"22288110","22291050"," I want you to feel good and comfortable like you're a part of it and you're happy with where you"
"22291050","22291330"," are."
"22291330","22296270"," And take your time away from you so they can party these oligarchs, these corporate oligarchs. "
"22296850","22299250"," So I see the reasoning even behind X and all that stuff."
"22299990","22305510"," Why what Google is doing and what Apple is doing to a lesser extent some of these other companies"
"22305510","22306870"," and people around the world."
"22307510","22313830"," They're going to create these worlds, these like second country almost like a virtual country that"
"22313830","22321310"," has nothing to do with country you live in. "
"22321310","22325970"," So this is the plan, even if it never comes to fruition, you can see the steps being put in"
"22325970","22327110"," place right now for it."
"22330940","22331440"," Yeah."
"22333180","22335280"," Now do I know if that's going to all come true?"
"22335800","22336520"," I don't know. "
"22336980","22340940"," It's probably the greatest existential threat to humanity for today."
"22341620","22345480"," Where we had a nuclear war was the greatest existential threat at one time, right?"
"22346140","22349720"," Disease was world war was in World War I, World War II."
"22350180","22352000"," World War I, the greatest war, right?"
"22352280","22353420"," The war to end all wars. "
"22354860","22357640"," Same thing with the industrial revolution, right?"
"22357820","22358780"," Same thing with the Bronze Age."
"22361440","22367800"," We've had this happen in the past, but this one here is probably the worst we've ever encountered."
"22369140","22373380"," Probably the scariest one that we ever encountered. "
"22381500","22386200"," Rocket Surgeon just bought AAP June 21, 100 calls for a buck."
"22386720","22387680"," Dirt cheap, dude."
"22390410","22390770"," Yeah. "
"22391050","22393670"," I mean, let's be honest."
"22394470","22395950"," We've got, let's be truly honest here, right?"
"22396090","22398670"," You've got the lizard King from Meta."
"22399530","22403230"," What is he building right now at his house in Hawaii?"
"22403550","22404230"," You guys know, right?"
"22404350","22409010"," He's building like a fucking massive underground compound, right?"
"22411190","22412770"," Underground compound, why?"
"22414670","22415570"," Right, why?"
"22416590","22418030"," It's not for nuclear war. "
"22418630","22422170"," Like, Hawaii is like a top target for nuclear war."
"22422990","22430030"," It's one of the top targets for like a World War III scenario, but it's because of AI."
"22430590","22431430"," That's what it's for. "
"22434820","22436460"," Yeah, it's a Doomsday Bunker XL."
"22437080","22439360"," It's the real fear, right?"
"22439360","22440380"," This doesn't come from Elon."
"22440540","22445000"," There's some other guys that do a bunch of talks at big universities. "
"22445000","22447600"," You can find these talks on YouTube."
"22448460","22456540"," A lot of these guys are mostly afraid of AI being let out by a sloppy company or sloppy country."
"22458460","22465160"," And the AI will figure out what needs to be done to destroy competitors for their nation, right?"
"22470800","22472340"," You can whip AI's ass. "
"22476620","22485160"," I think from my perspective, AI should be a worldwide ban."
"22485960","22487220"," It's almost like Dune."
"22489020","22496580"," There should be an instantaneous ban on AI, and then you would convene a UN council that would"
"22496580","22497780"," maybe work on AI. "
"22497780","22502760"," I think our only chance is some kind of like a world council that would work on it together."
"22504020","22505260"," Possibly that could work."
"22505680","22510340"," You'd have to have every major country involved in the decision-making process. "
"22511320","22514620"," And then if you catch anyone using it, it's off with your fucking head."
"22515380","22516860"," That's probably our only chance."
"22518400","22521040"," But otherwise, I think the future is dim. "
"22522580","22525460"," Especially when robotics are falling a little bit behind."
"22526500","22527160"," Not behind."
"22527320","22530660"," I shouldn't say falling behind, but they're a little bit farther time frame. "
"22530960","22538360"," They're probably like 100 years, 50 to 100 years out on truly good robotics, like soft robotics."
"22538720","22539240"," That's like a human."
"22539440","22543000"," They're not going to kill you when they swing their arm to the right kind of stuff. "
"22543400","22549600"," They're not going to back up and kill a child or step on a fucking dog and kill it because"
"22549600","22550020"," of the weight."
"22550620","22551800"," That kind of stuff."
"22552120","22554660"," There's a guy at MIT that talks about this stuff. "
"22554940","22560360"," Young kid that talks about the real problems with robotics and how far behind it actually truly is."
"22561300","22565280"," But somewhere in that time frame, there's a real real crisis coming for the world."
"22565720","22566560"," Next 50 to 100 years. "
"22572420","22573860"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Sam."
"22577880","22581320"," Yeah, I realize the difference between written AI and general AI."
"22581700","22583460"," I realize the difference between all these different AIs. "
"22583980","22589640"," I'm not going to sit there and like argue what which AI we're talking about and stuff like that."
"22590120","22593540"," And I don't believe that you and I even know how far general AI has come."
"22593920","22594820"," They don't tell you. "
"22595140","22595920"," They don't tell me."
"22596020","22597460"," They don't tell the governments."
"22597980","22598760"," They don't tell. "
"22599260","22604420"," When I was in the, when I was in US Army Command, nothing we said was what was on the"
"22604420","22604600"," news."
"22606800","22607200"," Zero."
"22611020","22611420"," Zero. "
"22611420","22611600"," Zero."
"22611760","22616280"," What was actually going on versus what you were told on all news sources was not accurate."
"22617500","22618060"," All. "
"22618560","22624580"," So I don't think for a minute that anything we're told publicly in regards to AI is real or true."
"22632540","22634780"," It was 1.4 billion earlier."
"22635900","22637460"," I think 1.4 billion. "
"22637900","22639320"," Looking to see if it becomes 4 billion."
"22645530","22646330"," Oh, yeah."
"22646330","22649010"," I did my daughter had a yard sale the other day. "
"22650850","22652550"," Am I not a true yard sale?"
"22653130","22655270"," Oh, my daughter had one another kid did."
"22656090","22657350"," So this like two kids did."
"22657530","22659310"," I took my stuff off and threw it everywhere. "
"22660750","22666710"," I was teaching my youngest daughter in a snowboard ski park."
"22667430","22673330"," What the fall line was and how to get back on your skis or board proper way to not slide"
"22673330","22674030"," down the mountain."
"22674030","22677730"," And I was like, you guys want to learn about a fall line and all that stuff. "
"22677850","22679610"," What a yard sale is because they both fallen."
"22680570","22681590"," I love yard sailing."
"22685930","22688010"," If you got a yard sale, you better do it right. "
"22689890","22691190"," You're going to fucking fall good."
"22691450","22692870"," Throw everything off like get rid of your hat."
"22693350","22693890"," Take your job. "
"22694050","22696990"," Even if you're done falling, take your jacket off and just throw it down the fucking hill."
"22697790","22706540"," I don't think so someone's matching a."
"22707700","22709140"," I think I'll be honest."
"22710600","22716400"," I think our governments are too fucking stupid to know how dangerous a eye is. "
"22716500","22717120"," I really do."
"22717580","22718340"," It's like greed."
"22719480","22722240"," And then I think that corporations aren't going to tell them either. "
"22722900","22727700"," Because any corporations can take over with that ship to take over."
"22728900","22731800"," I'm so fucking lutely before it's too late."
"22731920","22733240"," I don't think I don't think corporations. "
"22734280","22738060"," I interest a line with governments any governments in the in the world."
"22738580","22741680"," I don't think they align in any way shape or form."
"22741780","22749920"," I think they are probably the biggest enemy that a government of any people could have. "
"22752320","22753800"," Yeah, a hundred foot trail of gear."
"22753960","22754080"," Fuck."
"22754240","22756340"," Yeah, definitely all fucking day long. "
"22756340","22760520"," They parking this shit on the clothes before the eight 350 right now."
"22760980","22764360"," You guys expect a big up move into tomorrow."
"22765640","22770500"," Do you guys you guys expect the manipulation and then this big up move in OPEC tomorrow?"
"22770520","22772460"," Do you expect to be parked sideways in tomorrow?"
"22784780","22786520"," Yeah, I see the chip band stuff. "
"22786780","22788560"," I think that I think there's a real danger."
"22789040","22791500"," I don't know who it is that does it or says it."
"22792080","22796720"," I don't know if it's Bill Gates that says it or behind the closed door in a closed room, but"
"22796720","22800200"," we're fucked royally. "
"22800840","22802080"," We are super fucked."
"22803200","22806080"," If it's not, we're super fucked if it's not controlled."
"22809340","22810160"," Super fucked. "
"22819300","22820460"," Super, super fucked."
"22822100","22823140"," What about you?"

"22825640","22832560"," If you're watching this stream right now and you're under the age of 25, do you have high hopes for"
"22832560","22832820"," AI?"
"22834440","22835220"," Or do you?"
"22836700","22839760"," Do you think they'll just create more work for you to keep you working?"
"22840520","22845260"," Do you think they're actually going to allow you to fuck off the rest of your life and get fat"
"22845260","22846500"," like in the movie?"
"22847500","22848580"," What's the wally movie?"
"22849360","22855420"," Or do you think they'll always find something for you to do to have to be a slave to work?"
"22855420","22857080"," Do you think AI is your savior?"
"22858740","22860300"," Do you not think it's your savior?"
"22861720","22864480"," Do you think it's actually an existential threat or do you not?"
"22870320","22875200"," Yeah, 30 years of arts and culture warning against AI and VDA blew it up in one year. "
"22886620","22889120"," Long haul tracking, none of the other promises."
"22891880","22896480"," I'm thinking about when these kids are like 100 years old or something, and what their experience,"
"22896480","22898160"," what AI will be like, will be positive."
"22898520","22900160"," You know what I was thinking about two of you guys just said?"
"22900820","22904880"," I was thinking about AI art, and I have no appreciation for it. "
"22905180","22906480"," I'll be honest, I got zero."
"22907900","22909660"," There's something about the human touch, of course."
"22911260","22916360"," The best way to describe it would be, for me at least the best way to describe it would be. "
"22917280","22921400"," There's this guy from Chicago, he's dead now."
"22922060","22924060"," He's a famous Chicago chef."
"22924780","22926320"," Let me see what his name is here. "
"22926800","22928360"," Charlie Trotter, that's his name."
"22928760","22929320"," Let me have a look it up."
"22929760","22937440"," Guy named Charlie Trotter tried to teach people how to make a plate of food look natural versus a"
"22937440","22945460"," human hand composing a plate of food, and he would sprinkle stuff on top. "
"22945940","22950580"," And the reason he did it like that was because it was random, so it looked like it was nature."
"22950580","22955400"," If you place things on a plate, it looks like a human touched it."
"22956460","22962660"," Very similar in AI art, but you know what's fascinating about AI art is all my kids love it, all"
"22962660","22968540"," my kids friends love it, and if you introduce one or two generations to that being art, you'll"
"22968540","22973840"," never know what human art was just in a generation or two as really nice art. "
"22974600","22978100"," You become accustomed to this is what art is."
"22982710","22983790"," Huge red bars tomorrow."
"22985590","22988250"," However, I feel they pump it before hard before I sing it down. "
"22989010","22991150"," Yeah, I think as he's still alive, I thought he was dead."
"22992030","22993610"," I don't know, he might be alive still."
"22994190","22999110"," I swear he was dead because I thought I think I tried to buy some of his plates from an"
"22999110","22999310"," auction. "
"22999970","23001090"," Maybe he's still alive."
"23001250","23001830"," Is he still alive?"
"23002090","23003130"," He's a daughter too, doesn't he?"
"23004430","23006790"," Doesn't his daughter, maybe?"
"23007930","23009690"," Oh shit, am I saying he's alive and he's not dead?"
"23009690","23011550"," He did die in 2013."
"23012730","23016890"," Yeah, I tried to buy some, he had an auction, so he wouldn't sell his stuff. "
"23018970","23020710"," Before he died, he wouldn't sell his stuff."
"23021190","23024970"," So he had an auction and I was like fuck it, fuck down buying that for the prices he wanted."
"23025490","23028590"," He's got a bunch of, back in the day, he used to have plates with his signature on it. "
"23029210","23030410"," His initials and stuff."
"23030550","23031530"," And you guys know what this guy is?"
"23031990","23032210"," Famous chef."
"23039120","23040880"," I like AI art for what it's like. "
"23041100","23043860"," Yeah, I don't disagree with anyone you're saying positive about AI art."
"23043860","23045520"," I got nothing bad to say about it."
"23045920","23051020"," I realize it's going to help with a lot of VFX stuff with a storyboard building, all that kind of"
"23051020","23051160"," stuff. "
"23051220","23054520"," I realize that making cartoons is expensive and time consuming."
"23055160","23056480"," It's going to have a big impact there."
"23056700","23058000"," I understand it's impact. "
"23059820","23060800"," I understand it."
"23061120","23067160"," I'm talking about conditioning people to accepting something."
"23068100","23070140"," It's usually, you introduce it to kids. "
"23070820","23077200"," And that generation will never have any other idea of something better from that point forward."
"23079320","23080880"," We're doing that right now with kids."
"23081440","23087020"," We're introducing a young generation to having no concept of privacy. "
"23087780","23090240"," They feel good with no privacy."
"23090860","23091340"," They're good with it."
"23091500","23091780"," They're fine. "
"23096940","23098200"," Do you be watching kids?"
"23099380","23100120"," What they accept?"
"23100980","23102720"," I always ask my kids, do you like this?"
"23102720","23104600"," Do you enjoy this?"
"23105880","23108700"," Are you accepting of this or that or whatever it is?"
"23118920","23121440"," I'm going to repeat this right now, Chase, because they ain't listening."
"23122760","23125220"," With a window of weakness, I told them this morning, Chase."
"23125500","23126760"," I told them this morning, brother. "
"23127240","23128000"," They weren't listening, man."

"23140860","23142120"," 100% agree with you, man."
"23147020","23148020"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"23148240","23148900"," Oh, no. "
"23149140","23150520"," Do they sell that at Johnny H?"
"23150680","23154040"," Do they still sell that ground locks there at a whole paycheck?"
"23154800","23155820"," Do they really still sell it there?"
"23159850","23160670"," Window of weakness."
"23161010","23162330"," We're going to have to squeeze this, baby."
"23163210","23164810"," Look at that buying down there. "
"23165030","23167790"," Look at that buying right now."
"23170260","23172240"," Look at that gorgeous buying right there."
"23172240","23173360"," Look at that pin right there. "
"23178830","23180490"," Yeah, more to go up."
"23181310","23182370"," More going up here."
"23182470","23184150"," We got more and more upside right up here. "
"23196320","23198960"," Yeah, I noticed it with my kids in their clothing."
"23199460","23202740"," I noticed it with what they accept for."
"23206300","23211740"," So when I was a kid, there was no take a video and it's doomed you for life. "
"23212080","23217700"," Then there was a huge period when I was growing up where people were like on fake kids run Facebook"
"23217700","23222540"," after college and they're deleting all these bad pictures and videos."
"23223140","23227460"," Then you had like a whole rash of kids that are putting the wrong things."
"23227780","23230220"," They're what they present as themselves on the internet. "
"23231500","23235000"," Now kids today are what they craft what they look like."
"23236240","23240220"," They've got face filters and they present."
"23242540","23244300"," Fakeness to what they are online. "
"23245560","23247580"," You can like, but they're fine with it."
"23248480","23252120"," They're okay with having an online persona and online presence."

"23264320","23267400"," Maybe not a hundred thousand of them, but how many Twitch streamers are there?"
"23268360","23269580"," At any given time. "
