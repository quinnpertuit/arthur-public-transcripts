"45720","46320"," Good morning."
"46320","46880"," How are you doing there?"
"46960","47560"," Poked juice box."
"48060","48680"," What's going on?"
"56140","58400"," Let's see what is going on, one bitty. "
"62680","63280"," Good morning."
"63379","64060"," How's it right doing out there?"
"64880","67760"," A couple of things you've got to do here in the background."
"68560","70060"," Steps, do investors. "
"71360","72760"," Get right into it here."
"77640","79220"," One quick second here."
"83270","88590"," There's expect the company to take to maybe help the stock in the short to medium term. "
"88870","93810"," I think it's been pretty much set that you're going to be fully over the top of the direct consumer"
"93810","94450"," service."
"95010","96390"," We don't know the pricing of that."
"96390","100350"," I have to roam this morning. "
"102490","110890"," What we'll do is we're going to leave comments open for everyone on YouTube this morning."
"110890","112130"," Look at the landscape right now."
"112150","113590"," It is one of the five days. "
"115470","120570"," So if you subscribe to open for anyone to chat today on YouTube."
"128530","129630"," Turn this down a"
"129630","138790"," little bit."
"139190","140470"," Come on, I was there by doing this one. "
"140650","145030"," So investors are really hinging their backs on moving forward."
"145350","146850"," But in terms of everything else, you're right."
"147270","148890"," It could go a zillion different directions. "
"149330","151430"," So it's one of those companies that's going to have to continue to track."
"152110","154190"," One quick thing you've got to do here is back right now."
"154210","158950"," Thank you so much, Ali, for bringing this one down and freaking this one down for us this morning. "
"159670","160870"," All your markets actually straight ahead."
"160870","162130"," Thank you for watching Auto Finance."
"163570","164530"," There's a random one. "
"164910","166090"," What do you make a VINFAST?"
"166150","169110"," The facts are back."
"170470","171790"," Are they not?"
"173230","174090"," Selectively they are."
"174590","181470"," You know, VINFAST has everything you'd want in a meme-like stock. "
"181690","182810"," I'm not going to call it a meme stock."
"182810","184490"," But it's electric cars."
"184490","185990"," One quick second float. "
"187530","193750"," It's non-US based in some of the new listings."
"194510","200310"," And so you've got all the ingredients."
"200890","203990"," Is this company worth more than Ford and GM at this point?"
"204350","204830"," It seems ridiculous. "
"207050","212370"," But if you're trading VINFAST or if you're investing in VINFAST, you're not thinking in those"
"212370","212570"," terms."
"212730","216490"," You're saying, oh wait, this stock can double in a day or triple in a day."
"216710","219490"," Oh, if it goes down 50%, maybe it'll come back next time. "
"220370","225390"," So you've had everything in its short lifespan."
"225390","225650"," Yeah."
"236570","245010"," It's about 17 minutes until the comments from..."
"261380","263760"," Have some squeezing going on right now. "
"264080","266380"," Have a lot of volume inside the market right now."
"269480","270380"," Just a second here."
"272760","275320"," Just see all this volume in here going on. "
"276600","278500"," Also had a..."
"278500","281440"," we're really close to the JPM collar."
"290200","294660"," Some other notes, HYG bouncing this morning on the opening bell."
"295780","299180"," The VIX cooling off here, trading 1662. "
"300180","303820"," Coming into this morning, we're at 1732 on the VIX."
"304540","306280"," Dixie is still rising."
"306700","316980"," It is near that previous target 104.78, 105.08, 105.43. And"
"316980","318560"," has that nice squeeze. "
"318940","325480"," There's also this potential of a roll down and bounce on Dixie."
"325680","329600"," We'll take a look at that before they get started on Jackson Hole."
"331300","332260"," Jackson Hole. "
"332540","334080"," Tesla with a nice squeeze this morning."
"334860","335980"," Much better than Apple."
"337220","343280"," We're going to take a look at specifically at Dixie I think at this point here. "
"343360","344080"," Give me just a second here."
"344520","351080"," I do also want to show you a few things."
"351760","355600"," The implied move today on the upside is 441-14. "
"360280","365620"," Downside implied move this morning is quite low."
"366160","372900"," And this is of course based upon all of the options that were in the market leading up to today."
"373120","376040"," This doesn't involve any of the zero dates today. "
"378260","384000"," And so you've got the implied move to downside 432-64, 441-14."
"385240","392060"," And it being a Friday regardless of what you think is going to happen today."
"392200","397340"," There's some key points that need to be made on the first of which is a quick second here. "
"401060","408580"," First of which is going to be a prime day on Fridays for all the build up into this event."
"411460","413920"," For dealers to say thank you for playing right."
"414480","415240"," Thanks for playing. "
"417980","420220"," Wrap it up and go home some kind of a failure."
"421840","425600"," Down or up although there is one other neat thing."
"425600","431420"," So oftentimes in these events you'll get the real move after the actual event right. "
"432340","435500"," So you get the thank you for playing from dealers then you get the actual move."
"435740","438780"," There is something else fascinating about today."
"438880","443460"," And that is that the weekly trigger is down here on S3. "
"443740","444800"," That's down here 427."
"445460","448980"," There's no real reason at this point why we wouldn't trade this."
"449360","450580"," We're so low at this point. "
"451240","454080"," We've traded 436 yesterday."
"454480","455100"," We're at 433."
"456340","458380"," Just the other day it's like a magnet down here. "
"458520","461460"," We also have the JPM caller down at 420."
"462560","465720"," Somewhere down in here there's a JPM caller that's a magnet."
"466160","473140"," The acts as a magnet into the second, third quarter, second month, but also acts"
"473140","480560"," as a way to repel. "
"480560","483720"," Like size size but being closed yesterday."
"484120","493820"," Another note for this morning is that the hourly trigger is right on the pivot and then that the"
"493820","497620"," daily trigger is up at 443.65 up here."
"498340","504240"," So as a base case we know that we know that as long as we stay below the early trigger"
"504240","507740"," and the daily trigger prices below we're negative on the day. "
"507740","511120"," That was kind of an exception to the talk that has normally gone on."
"511260","512039"," One quick second."
"512039","514960"," I want to see a few surprises this year, but the market reaction. "
"515380","518080"," We're also going to take a quick look here at..."
"518080","519820"," I'm not expecting that much in stocks."
"520419","521299"," Let's go to the Wi-Fi interactive."
"521299","522640"," I'm going to chart what's been happening. "
"522640","523740"," Be one quick second here."
"523820","527180"," It's instructive to see what is happening with the DAO versus NASDAQ."
"527340","527980"," DAO is down. "
"531160","533220"," I also want to take a look down here."
"533300","534640"," I want to show you how close we are."
"536880","543740"," A key point on this weekly trigger is you can see this bounce right here. "
"546260","549980"," You can also see how weekly came up this week."
"552220","553120"," What do we have here?"
"553600","554180"," One more bounce."
"558580","560360"," You can see that right there as well. "
"561560","569290"," It would be really nice though to tag that weekly trigger."
"569290","571510"," Don't forget that JPM Collar down below."
"573770","575310"," We did tag..."
"575310","576550"," I was looking at..."
"576550","578970"," last line I was looking at SPX and ES. "
"579650","581510"," We basically hit 450 up here."
"582250","589430"," We only tagged 446 in SPY, but we did get 450 on ES."
"589970","597970"," We got pretty close to that 450 target to then head lower and bounce off that weekly trigger. "
"597970","605890"," Our original pause it was that we'd take out 450 in SPY, but SPX ES got close enough for my"
"605890","606170"," blood."
"607090","612390"," Also pay attention to the daily trigger heading lower today."
"612610","614090"," I want you to notice this right here. "
"614210","615630"," SPX saying we're going to go lower."
"619810","623370"," And then we are parked right now in that 439."
"623690","627250"," If you remember yesterday we were sitting here saying that's a big no-go right here. "
"627250","631630"," And we're getting the pin right now and a bounce off the hourly trigger."
"631810","635170"," You can see the pin strike here above on hourly trigger."
"635250","638690"," That was earlier this morning and it was in pre-market as well. "
"639250","643070"," We got the sell sell sell on hourly trigger."
"643510","648990"," Now hourly trigger on a 30 minute chart on SPOOS is beginning to get bullish."
"649770","653150"," Half our trigger beginning to get bullish on SPY. "
"653150","658590"," We'll take a look at ES and we'll take a look at SPX as well on its fellow."
"659250","661670"," And it's starting to round out to the upside."
"662410","664110"," Looking for an upside move on ES. "
"664610","666450"," Looking for an upside move on SPY."
"667270","670510"," And the only thing that would disagree with you on this is SPX."
"670830","673790"," SPX saying we've done what we're going to do. "
"673870","675690"," We're going to head down lower here."
"675870","679190"," So SPX saying look out below."
"680270","683710"," Saying look out for check the downside. "
"684430","686590"," And then maybe that squeeze higher here."
"686850","693950"," So just pay attention to that implied move today on the markets and maybe not an outsized move."
"694750","698390"," So if we go back to, take a mornin' everybody how y'all doin'?"
"699290","701410"," By the way if you're watching on YouTube. "
"703310","707890"," If you're watching on YouTube you can comment today if you are a subscriber."
"708410","711110"," Not a member so if you just subscribe it's free."
"711230","713310"," You get the chat on YouTube. "
"713450","715870"," If you're on Twitch and you want to chat today."
"715870","719350"," They're planning trips much more last minute than they did pre-pandemic."
"719710","721890"," So right in here you've got the implied move to the upside. "
"722250","725370"," We'll leave that one on this side and then the downside implied move."
"725590","728910"," Driven by the higher supply the airlines are operating at the end."
"728970","731250"," Right here might come into play today. "
"731690","736170"," And that's where you get that SPX telling you to get that quick rip down."
"736170","737010"," Early August."
"738110","738670"," Quick rip up. "
"738670","739690"," Quick rip up."
"739690","742210"," We heard too earlier than we have in previous years."
"742710","746470"," All of that is going to drive airfare down for Labor Day weekend in particular. "
"747030","747650"," Comes at the end."
"750690","756510"," And that's really why we're seeing about $2.25 for airfare down about $75 from what we saw earlier"
"756510","758050"," this summer and 4th of July weekend."
"758050","759190"," It's really interesting. "
"759670","764550"," As we think about travelers getting ready to perhaps make those flights catch them."
"764770","766610"," So you make this so you can see it better."
"766970","771690"," At the same time the airlines are going to be equipped now. "
"771930","774470"," They've got all this stuff down below here."
"774930","776890"," Pay attention to this one as well."
"778650","781230"," I would say airlines was the low from yesterday. "
"781230","788410"," The end of 2021 have been increasingly better equipped better trained to handle the volume of"
"788410","789550"," passengers that we're seeing."
"789810","790150"," One quick second."
"790350","793070"," Huge influx of new hiring in 2022. "
"793630","797470"," Those people had to be trained and it's not just the airlines at the airports as well."
"797810","798270"," It's the FA."
"798490","799190"," One quick second. "
"799390","800350"," I got something to do in the background."
"800410","803830"," So we had a relatively successful summer."
"803990","807770"," We did not see the incredibly high disruption rates we did in 2022. "
"808330","813590"," But it is a fact that disruption rates are higher now than they have been pre pandemic."
"813590","818130"," About 25% of flights delayed on departure between 1% and 2% cancelled."
"818470","820950"," That still impacts thousands of passengers a day. "
"821550","824410"," Does it dissuade them from traveling though, Haley?"
"824710","827390"," I mean, and I take that also with the report that recently came out."
"827450","832450"," I believe the New York Times talking about how many near misses there are because of our air"
"832450","833810"," traffic control system."
"833810","838930"," Do we see any kind of hit to traveler sentiment as a result of all of this?"
"840290","842410"," We haven't seen it on the hopper app. "
"842570","845110"," Most of our users are Gen D millennial."
"845710","849570"," So they definitely are more focused on travel than some of the older generation."
"849910","851970"," I think World War II, right?"
"852350","858910"," The last time we were at 100% was where we had this very, very low unemployment. "
"859570","863430"," So in the short run, it's good, right?"
"863430","872870"," We talked about how that fiscal impulse early in the pandemic was really a big part of why the U "
"872870","874350",".S. coasted true."
"874910","876590"," I've been dying to ask you this question."
"877010","879710"," Everyone from the left and the right have talked about it. "
"879970","885230"," Can you make an analogy to the economic carnage after World War II?"
"892270","894750"," Did you"
"894750","905190"," bring"
"905190","910430"," the industrial plan and all that?"
"910430","916210"," Can you do an analogy to the experience mostly because they can turn it on wouldn't worry very much"
"916210","924430"," right and switch over and do a different task and not have it turn off that's some small details"
"924430","931250"," and then also the the way melter would kill me for this a disaggregation of your cutting right now"
"931250","936810"," I'm gonna turn that down for right now feels like this flat on the back what is the public policy"
"936810","942990"," that we can why omen baby well it is like ugly and really really beautiful you don't know that I"
"942990","949270"," agree people inflation makes a lot of a lot of ugly and then some of the most epic so important"
"949270","956970"," that the fed beauty in the United States or the continental United States I should say but there's"
"956970","964110"," also the case if you look at the basic fundamentals for heaven takes the unemployment rate is 3.5"
"964110","972070"," GDP has continued to to grow you know I think yes people are struggling they're certainly"
"972070","976850"," struggling with the cost of living but a lot of the fun getting pretty close here we're almost"
"976850","986850"," there the Sarn's line right here is going to denote when the speech begins here 10.05 people not"

"992850","998870"," else is doing the victory lap for you a little bit of a happy talk around here it just makes"
"998870","1006750"," me uncomfortable no and I agree I think we don't know what's gonna come we have still had a bunch"

"2705390","2713150"," an hour we'll start heading lower trade one year treasury bill yields 5.4 that's right within the"
"2713150","2717810"," current fed funds range so if we go up a quarter and down a quarter by then if the market"
"2717810","2723450"," is saying we're kind of here it doesn't seem as if the market needs to be talked aggressively off"
"2723450","2727670"," the idea that hikes that that cuts are coming you know what i mean this is an argument you know"
"2727670","2732310"," i've had how much is the stock market banking on future cuts or it's just kind of like and we"
"2732310","2738210"," don't know what's going to happen past a few months yeah mica how are you with this white bar right"
"2738210","2744150"," here things with you much so i just want to be clear about that um look a couple things on"
"2744150","2752210"," that the first thing is that if if the interest one of the things to me here was Powell reiterating"
"2752210","2761150"," this idea that if the economy needs to cool in order for inflation to come down that was something"
"2761150","2765890"," he said last year it's something that hasn't happened over the last next year so if you want to be"
"2765890","2771190"," a trader out there or an investor thinking about rate cuts i think Powell's kind of laying down a"
"2771190","2776610"," metric here for you that says we need to be below trend for a while for me as a policy"
"2776610","2784270"," maker to have confidence that inflation is really vanquished here and and before you argue with a"
"2784270","2789270"," little bit too excited about the market reaction today i would take Bob Passani's comments"
"2789870","2797530"," advisedly here uh noting how far the market came in coming up to this level and reacting already to"
"2797530","2803910"," the strong growth and anticipating the fed reaction function here when it came to these higher"
"2803910","2809530"," growth rates he did throw it out there as an issue that growth running too high is an issue for"
"2809530","2813850"," the federal reserve they have to address he didn't by the way mention higher interest rates which"
"2813850","2818210"," kind of suggests to you that at least at this point he's not uncomfortable with what happened to"
"2818210","2824110"," rates so the market anticipated this in a in a good way i think that they correctly assumed how"
"2824110","2829970"," Powell would react to this and so there's no re-pricing necessary at least today either on the cut"
"2829970","2835850"," side in 2024 or in the hike side for 2023 when it comes to being at a 5050 for the"
"2835850","2840530"," November meeting yeah i was uh i was struck uh steve on his comments he's basically saying that"
"2840530","2846010"," pause past hikes kind of reminded me of what harker told you yesterday and kind of what David's"
"2846010","2852330"," saying right now yeah it is a big debate here inside the room i will tell you this in the"
"2852330","2860050"," hallways yesterday uh this issue of drags and it may be that what we're seeing now is the effect of"
"2860050","2865830"," what we were waiting for which is now that rates are higher these are the drags we're going to be"
"2865830","2871790"," getting we haven't seen much in the way of explicit drags from bank credit tightening that may be"
"2871790","2876410"," yet to come and now that these mortgage rates are so high it may really end up cooling the job"
"2876410","2881990"," market but more interesting to me is what's happening in the belly of a three to seven years ago"
"2881990","2887030"," you're trying to be a tenor of the treasury market itself we are this is the place where businesses"
"2887030","2892250"," do business and i think you're in a place where you're going to have a bit more of that monetary"
"2892250","2897310"," policy drag than we've had in the past David he made a comment about inflation being potentially"
"2897310","2902490"," more reactive now to labor market dynamics than it had been previously and we're looking at wage"
"2902490","2906890"," inflation but is that just a catch-up is that actually productivity what do you make of his"
"2906890","2912850"," comments in the labor market and how is absolutely no proven at all because as i say the big"
"2912850","2917550"," decline that we've seen inflation over last year well you know we've had wage growth has come down"
"2917550","2922950"," a bit but it doesn't account for that and even in core services x housing we think the stickiness"
"2922950","2928190"," has got everything to do with auto prices the lag effect of that robin wages uh but i i think"
"2928190","2934470"," we don't you know labor market dynamics we don't actually know it's an important point because the"
"2934470","2938930"," fed says we've got to lose the labor market conditions to fix this but what that means is we've got"
"2938930","2942190"," a three and a half percent unemployment rate right now the fed says that by the end of next year"
"2942190","2947490"," is the four and a half percent that's one point seven million people will have to lose their jobs"
"2947490","2952430"," in the altar of getting to two percent inflation you sound like elizabeth war well but it's but it"
"2952430","2957070"," could well be though that the actual neutral rate of unemployment is three and a half percent not"
"2957070","2962370"," four percent in which case leave it play it out this is why i was mentioning the 90s before because"
"2962370","2966170"," that was the lesson that we had we thought it was like four and a half to five back then"
"2966170","2970890"," that was the floor yeah this is not an inflation prone economy the long-term structure and indeed"
"2970890","2974090"," they're going to talk about long-term structural change the economy if the long-term structural"
"2974090","2979050"," changes the economy tend to push inflation down it's more competitive than it used to be it's very"
"2979050","2984230"," unequal in terms because you can push wages down six percent of the private sector is unionized"
"2984230","2988330"," you're not going to get a huge union movement pushing up wages even though you have occasional"
"2988330","2992450"," strikes so this is not a very inflation prone economy see what three and a half percent"
"2992450","2995810"," unemployment does for you if we can get if we can avoid a recession three and a half percent"
"2995810","2999590"," unemployment to get inflation down to two at the end of next year isn't that a win i mean you"
"2999590","3004970"," know why why snatch defeat from the jaws of victory i like that uh steve what's still to come"
"3004970","3010490"," ghouls be later today yeah we have a lot of mess you're coming up and and and ghouls be and"
"3010490","3014150"," then we're going to get the papers that are out there talking about these structural changes and"
"3014150","3019770"," how things like debt and supply chains uh have have changed over time and what that means i think"
"3019770","3024990"," uh david's point is a really interesting one about whether there's sort of a long-run bent for"
"3024990","3029910"," lower inflation in this country i'm personally interested in the question of whether or not china's"
"3029910","3035470"," going to be exporting deep disinflation to the united states and the impact on that i have this uh"
"3035470","3039830"," crazy idea that i'm going to kind of be reporting among you know in the hallways with some of the"
"3039830","3047390"," folks which is this idea and and don't throw things at me you guys which is i think inflation may"
"3047390","3054130"," end up having been transitory or transitory to a large extent except except that it wasn't on the"
"3054130","3059870"," timetable that the body politics required it to be and i think people got frustrated with it but"
"3059870","3065770"," over time the supply chain issues have been resolving themselves you're into a goods disinflation"
"3065770","3072390"," regime right now you may get more of that coming from china um and and the other issue was that"
"3072390","3077670"," china was on a different schedule china ended its lockdown this year then everybody got covid in"
"3077670","3085150"," china and maybe now china as a supply for the yeah we're gonna turn this off coming back online"
"3085150","3090150"," they obviously have to get their act together economically but i i think that that you there could"
"3090150","3100090"," be some better news to come in inflation now we've discussed we've discussed this ad nauseam at"
"3100090","3105190"," this point right you can see them now discussing it this morning the same things that we brought up"
"3105190","3112350"," this past week uh the big one is the housing right the discussion that we've had about housing and"
"3112350","3122330"," we want a quick second here the u.s. rates are rate futures are now pricing in a higher odds"
"3122330","3129950"," of a fed uh fed hike in november in the december meeting we know that those don't mean anything we"
"3129950","3135110"," had a reversal quick reversal here see if they're going to try to trade this right up this blue"
"3135110","3142150"," just white box right here now do i think you get that rate that rate hike no i don't think"
"3142150","3150210"," that the uh gamblers betting on whether we get a rate hike or not are ever correct it's more just"
"3150210","3157070"," people gambling that's all it is so if you see stuff like that don't put too much weight into it"
"3157070","3162450"," the odds of a rate hike or not you're just going that the plan from the fed and from joron"
"3162450","3169670"," paul here is to take a lap a victory lap which has been doing he's taking that lap right now"
"3169670","3175630"," with people from around the world and then also uh to make you believe that you're going to get"
"3175630","3183750"," continued rate hikes now i personally hope and wish that we get more rate hikes that we get above"
"3183750","3191030"," the rate of inflation but the real the real thing here for joron is to uh is to make you"
"3191030","3198090"," believe uh that we're we're not done we're not going to cut the moment that you believe that we're"
"3198090","3204970"," catching a cut uh that's it's it's game over at that point right the more time that he buys what"
"3204970","3211730"," is going on over here getting some real wonky um not getting any any kind of like reaction on that"
"3211730","3218050"," on that book map book maps i'll jacked up today so well the idea here is that the moment that"
"3218050","3224190"," they think their cuts are coming uh you you'll see a front run and a roll over in the market"
"3224190","3230030"," and the candle is burning for him he's got the candle going into spring and summer and then he has"
"3230030","3235250"," a presidential election coming uh where they're going to make promises they're going to make"
"3235250","3243850"," promises that they can't they can't really keep um so just be aware of that uh with with joron s "
"3243850","3250310","&p 500 up zero spot zero five percent nastare cup zero spot one six percent and the down down zero"
"3250310","3259350"," spot zero three percent the the the conversation from this morning though did address wage and uh"
"3259350","3265290"," wage spiraling out of wages real wages firing out of control and uh the coming destruction of the"
"3265290","3272370"," housing market now one caught destruction but i think that hints to you uh that's same idea that we"
"3272370","3277770"," did discuss earlier earlier this week is you know when he's talking about like he's expecting"
"3277770","3282530"," housing prices to come down well all right there he's claiming that they're already coming down"
"3282530","3292530"," which that's a lie but the truth is is that now you've got realtors out there that are promising"
"3292530","3301750"," buyers that rates are coming down you've got homeowners that are unwilling"
"3301750","3310470"," to sell as a matter of fact Joe donut sent me a a graph yesterday uh that that supports that"
"3310470","3320250"," argument that uh sellers are unwilling to sell their homes then he discussed well he's he's like"
"3320250","3326510"," implying that discussion that we had about this this conundrum that swaps price out first 25 basis"
"3326510","3335970"," point rate cut to july from june and that discussion stems with that discussion stems with uh home"
"3335970","3343610"," owners that are in low rate loans they want to sell they want to move so if i'm a homeowner"
"3343610","3351650"," right i think about this okay i'm kind of like big it not sound like it's me so if i'm"
"3351650","3359490"," a homeowner and i have a great rate on a house it's not good enough having a realtor try to"
"3359490","3384090"," soothe me with an argument that hey you know what uh"
"3384090","3393470"," go start looking for houses and the few uh you they'll hold rates here for the next six months to"
"3393470","3402570"," a year uh some some no offense some crackerjack uh realtor out there telling me that now if i'm a"
"3402570","3408670"," buyer and i don't own a home or i'm forced into buying a home i'm going to drink the cool"
"3408670","3413890"," aid that the realtor's telling me don't worry about it six months nine months uh they're going to"
"3413890","3420790"," cut rates so the buyer is fine right the person that needs to move needs to buy needs to relocate"
"3420790","3427250"," someone young someone's having kids whatever it is right now as someone that already owns a home"
"3427250","3433310"," and i have no requirement that i move no requirement that i uh transition somewhere else i don't"
"3433310","3436830"," have to do that do i and i'm not going to listen to a realtor tell me that am i"
"3436830","3443310"," i'm just going to wait right not only am i going to wait but i'm going to attempt because i"
"3443310","3450670"," think i'm the smartest person in the world right i'm going to i'm going to try to time it right"
"3450670","3456330"," so what what am i trying to do right i look at my home and my home value i have"
"3456330","3461530"," a great rate and what i'm going to do is say you know what i'm just going to hang out"
"3461530","3470110"," here and the moment that we actually cut rates i will attempt to sell now"
"3470110","3479910"," let's say my house is uh four hundred thousand dollars right and i live in a neighborhood and we"
"3479910","3485490"," now we know right now that none of these homeowners are willing to sell we know it right now the"
"3485490","3493010"," numbers say it now the moment that you do get a rate cut right let's say we're at uh we're"
"3493010","3499610"," at seven seven and a half percent eight percent right now right we get we get a rate cut and"
"3499610","3505790"," mortgage rates start to come down and what do i do then i go oh shit here we go right"
"3505790","3513770"," they're going to start cutting rates time for me to have maximized my profit and begin to look to"
"3513770","3518350"," buy home and grab my wife and say you ready to buy then our next big house and she goes"
"3518350","3526090"," yes well i'm not the only one thinking that there's probably another 10 people on my block thinking"
"3526090","3533930"," the same thing and so there's a mad rush by people like me that have held since two thousand"
"3533930","3540210"," fourteen fifteen so i put my house on the market my four hundred thousand dollar house and so"
"3540210","3547130"," doesn't mike and bob and jim or i'm jim i guess and bill and uh mary and sue and um"
"3547130","3555130"," i don't know Joaquin it's just some people hanging out in my neighborhood and we all start putting"
"3555130","3562230"," our houses out there to sell and what happens right now the buyers are still there they come into"
"3562230","3571010"," the neighborhood to buy and they see that there's 10 houses for sale in in my neighborhood so these"
"3571010","3580630"," these realtors like i was a realtor i would tell the buyer yeah i wouldn't be offering above"
"3580630","3586670"," and be offering at at ask or even lower let's throw some stink bids out there and see if anybody"
"3586670","3595010"," bites and so i'm trying to sell and my buddy over here he's been owning his home longer than i"
"3595010","3600730"," have he's selling his at four hundred thousand dollars and all of a sudden he says you know what"
"3600730","3605210"," i'll take that three seventy five and i'll get out of here he's asking for four hundred as well"
"3605210","3613070"," right all of a sudden he caves and he asks for three seventy five and i'm like oh shit right"
"3613070","3617310"," comps for your neighborhood cap are now down to three seventy five and they're you're four hundred"
"3617310","3622190"," as so i panic and i try to get out too and i also know about mike up the road"
"3622190","3629130"," he's trying to sell and that's the idea behind this conversation from jorone right now he's not"
"3629130","3634970"," telling you you're getting right cuts but he's telling you to expect those housing prices come down"
"3634970","3641070"," then some flying rate cuts are coming i know that these peep these talking heads on cnbc"
"3641070","3645910"," specifically the ones that are coming in for interview are going to tell you it's hawkish it is i"
"3645910","3653250"," guess in the long run uh but that wasn't a caucus conversation that was a conversation of rate cuts"
"3653250","3660110"," coming down the line and its impact on the housing market because once once you trigger that"
"3660110","3666930"," because right now you've got this problem with uh more buyers than sellers and the only way you get"
"3666930","3674670"," that the more bought more more uh sellers than buyers is through rate cuts when that does happen"
"3674670","3681730"," now you will see uh not even a cratering if any of you guys know any about real estate uh"
"3681730","3687350"," whenever housing prices truly come down they haven't come down by the way if you think that they"
"3687350","3692750"," have you're out of your fucking mind um they they they feed you that shit that they're coming out"
"3692750","3697090"," that they're coming down but they're it's really bullshit tell people that have bought houses for"
"3697090","3702370"," like a hundred thousand hundred fifty thousand they're worth like four five six hundred thousand"
"3702370","3712170"," dollars right now that's no joke uh no joke but you have to trigger"
"3712170","3718350"," that the only way that you trigger the only way that you trigger these sellers to loosen their grip"
"3718350","3724970"," on their properties in mass is by saying yeah don't worry we're gonna start cutting or the belief"
"3724970","3731950"," that you're gonna start cutting uh and and it's for the seller not the buyer to believe buyer is"
"3731950","3739450"," drinking the Kool-Aid seller has to believe that rates are coming down now you might think of you"
"3739450","3746170"," thinking to yourself well cat that sounds bullish right it really isn't um but it does it it tricks"
"3746170","3753050"," these people into being uh bag holders and also trigger triggers these people into believing uh"
"3753050","3761490"," that the end is near right so you have exuberance you have exuberance by um Bob on Main Street that"
"3761490","3767850"," thinks everything is fine uh they end up holding the bag that's typically what happens or what what"
"3767850","3773590"," has happened in uh historically and that's that usually that when we're coming out of that trough"
"3773590","3778430"," we come back down and retest it typically when you you'll get uh people that will believe"
"3778430","3784930"," everything is fine right hey we it's funny too they tell people like QE is uh bullish then"
"3784930","3793130"," historically it's not uh historically we're at like uh at a really bad place in the stock market uh"
"3793130","3799490"," when when that is happening when those announcements are coming and you hear the fed get that done "
"3799490","3807550","-ish we're usually on our way down right so we're not seeing that just yet from Jerome but like that"
"3807550","3817350"," meter that we talk about talking to you about that meter right you got that meter right and"
"3817350","3820770"," you've got like this tick right here is uh neutral"
"3820770","3830730"," you've got super right and uh you remember"
"3830730","3838610"," that's as we were cranking right heading up to top you got super hawk j-pow right and j-pow"
"3838610","3848590"," has slowly over time become more neutral right started to take a victory lap over here last"
"3848590","3855150"," right decision he's gonna try to hover around here as long as he possibly can and the more that he"
"3855150","3862630"," gets dovish the more you're going to expect this market to roll down right so then when you get"
"3862630","3868790"," that super dove we're way down here does that make sense uh so don't be drinking the kool-aid like"
"3868790","3873370"," you guys think kool-aid on the wrong people out there you guys think the kool-aid on the like"
"3873370","3878790"," i always ask these people always ask people i'm like okay so do you expect uh do you expect super"
"3878790","3884070"," dove uh if we roll over we won't be rolling already expecting super dove fed they're like no no no"
"3884070","3894010"," no no no we'll be at 20 percent then 20 points we'll be mortgages will be at 30 percent"
"3894010","3899770"," you know something crazy like that and you have a presidential election coming so the way this"
"3899770","3907790"," times out there's probably some people in the background that would love to see that market low as"
"3907790","3914030"," we head into a presidential election right kind of hand that on a palate or on a plate to a"
"3914030","3919990"," candidate that can promise to make things good for you right you've got voters that'll come into an"
"3919990","3928090"," election season uh that'll be angry guess who voters are you know who voters are they're homeowners"
"3928090","3935810"," they're people that pay taxes right do you want do you want them happy coming into an election"

"4124109","4129750"," growth and those are the two things that he talked about today so we're gonna go back to that wage"

"4185790","4195770"," want a quick second here we've got labor day coming up on september 4th right"
"4195770","4204230"," or 5th 4th as well."
"4205330","4206730"," So that's the second announcement."
"4207190","4211890"," You've got a week vacation coming up during Labor Day, that's September 5th. "
"4212390","4219290"," So there'll be a moment, a portion of that where I won't be here during Labor Day weekend."
"4221470","4231450"," I'm gonna read to you here, I'm gonna read to you the summary from the symposium"
"4231450","4234430"," in Jackson's hole here in just a moment as well."
"4237230","4243650"," Now the last part of the discussion we've had these past couple weeks is wage spiral, right?"
"4244210","4249170"," Wage growth spiral and it's here. "
"4249930","4254170"," We've been discussing that topic for over a month, right?"
"4254910","4255950"," Maybe even longer."
"4256590","4265250"," You've even seen Binky speak about it and that has to do with the demand from workers to be paid"
"4265250","4269590"," more money and this is on a large scale."
"4270070","4278630"," This is the fly in the ointment that is coming down the road and it's not something to be fucked"
"4278630","4279030"," with. "
"4281110","4282690"," So it's very scary."
"4283070","4286330"," It really is and we're gonna discuss it again right now at this moment."
"4286890","4291570"," So if you paid attention to the stream the past week, this is everything that was discussed today"
"4291570","4295050"," by Jerome Powell and I want to talk to you about that. "
"4295410","4304150"," So when you start to see all of the unions in the United States demand and renegotiate for a"
"4304150","4309190"," package of 150 to $175,000 a year."
"4309550","4311250"," This is not just UPS or FedEx."
"4311970","4314430"," This is all of the unions across the United States. "
"4314970","4322030"," If you start to speak to business owners, workers are demanding more."
"4322350","4326430"," I saw where I live, I saw that I live in one of the cheapest places to live in the"
"4326430","4326950"," United States."
"4327730","4331530"," And I saw cooks being offered $20 an hour. "
"4332690","4336110"," I hire laborers right now for $30 an hour."
"4336710","4342550"," These are people that for whatever reason in their life, these are people that can't work a normal"
"4342550","4349770"," job and they want 30 an hour cash $30 an hour to do work."
"4350210","4356970"," You've got entry level manufacturing and blue collar workers demanding 50 an hour. "
"4358030","4365050"," So I'm assuming that around the these are people where I live that people are going to want around"
"4365050","4370050"," the country, especially in places with the higher cost of living are going to want that minimum."
"4371530","4377150"," So if I can make $30 or $50 an hour living in Michigan, what does it work or asking for"
"4377150","4378070"," in California?"
"4379230","4384250"," And we're seeing a tidal wave of that happen across the country."
"4384810","4393130"," If you're a business owner out there right now, I know that you can't hire, especially a small"
"4393130","4397210"," business owner, I know that you can't hire, not for what's going to be asked. "
"4398570","4404650"," And let me know if you think that you can pay somebody that rate full package."
"4405770","4406930"," Fuck no, you can't."
"4407610","4411710"," So there's mitigation going on right now. "
"4412650","4415050"," And how do you mitigate that right?"
"4415310","4424930"," You lay off people that are that are overqualified and bring on younger people to try to blunt"
"4424930","4433090"," that you try to renegotiate a contract with workers that doesn't kick in for five more years or"
"4433090","4433950"," more years."
"4435770","4438430"," Why is that to buy you time right?"
"4439510","4443770"," Or an adjustment to take place to afford those workers?"
"4445170","4451230"," So even no matter what the Fed is telling you, no matter what CNBC is telling you, no matter what"
"4451230","4457570"," Twitter is telling you, no matter what anything out there is telling you, there are real companies,"
"4458270","4468030"," real companies with real money on the line that are doing something different than"
"4468030","4474050"," what the fucking shit talking cool a porn people are telling you."
"4474950","4476950"," So this is someone that owns the business. "
"4479070","4480890"," And so what are they, what are they doing?"
"4481230","4489570"," Well, we know in a closed room with no listening devices and you're under an NDA"
"4489570","4492490"," there."
"4492670","4495230"," And I'm going to tell you what they're talking about the next five years."
"4497110","4500810"," It's going to cost us a shit ton of money to have employees, right?"
"4501150","4501610"," Pretty simple. "
"4505150","4510110"," And where do you think it's kind of funny to us reading the I was reading the I was reading."
"4510370","4511330"," We'll talk about this later."
"4511790","4514890"," But I was kind of like driving a screwdriver in my head. "
"4516750","4520550"," If you have this wage spiral get out of control in the next five years."
"4525100","4528660"," What do you think happens for these companies?"
"4529140","4533200"," Do you think they're going to pay these people this money and just go bankrupt?"
"4533360","4534140"," Is that what you think?"
"4535340","4538120"," They're going to charge you to pay those employees."
"4539400","4540900"," That's who they're going to charge you. "
"4541240","4544760"," And they don't give a flying fuck what Jerome says."
"4545520","4547300"," They don't care what anybody says."
"4547860","4551840"," If you think you're rolling back those wages, do you think they're going to send a contract to pay"
"4551840","4556320"," somebody $150,000 to $200,000 a year?"
"4558840","4562340"," You think that any of these politicians are going to change that?"
"4562540","4563260"," You're out of your mind. "
"4564520","4566340"," These people already know what's coming."
"4566500","4570000"," If you don't think your phone's going to become more expensive, your car is going to become more"
"4570000","4573680"," expensive or stay expensive, you're out of your mind."
"4577040","4579680"," And so what does that lead to?"
"4580040","4588580"," It leads to knowing it shows you that the next five to ten years, possibly 15 to 20,"
"4588960","4596970"," that we are going to get like at the start of Japan. "
"4597790","4598690"," That's the truth."
"4600450","4607510"," You can't have no offense to a blue-collar worker, but if you can't have blue-collar workers making"
"4607510","4608750"," $200,000 a year."
"4609510","4612370"," And when you do, I'm going to tell you what happens. "
"4613450","4619290"," If I'm a business owner, I am going to do everything that I can to get that money out of"
"4619290","4619750"," your pocket."
"4620410","4621090"," You understand?"
"4622350","4628870"," So if you're renting an Airbnb for me and I know you make $200,000 a year or $150,000"
"4628870","4631630"," a year, I'm going to try to get some of that money."
"4632670","4637810"," And if someone that's not an entry-level worker or a blue-collar worker, I'm talking about the"
"4637810","4642930"," engineers, the doctors, the attorneys, they're going to demand more than you get paid. "
"4644170","4651450"," And if they're demanding to get paid more than you, and I'm asking for you to pay me, there's other"
"4651450","4657590"," companies larger than me that are going to want your money to pay the wages of their workers."
"4660650","4665570"," And so when that cycle kicks in, we're going up."
"4666550","4668130"," And guess what they're going to reprice?"
"4669310","4670030"," The stock market. "
"4672210","4673390"," But dollar is going to be worthless."
"4674730","4679130"," And that means the market goes up way higher, not lower."
"4680650","4682450"," It goes up way higher. "
"4684430","4687590"," So you're likely going to get, I mean, what do they do?"
"4687890","4689050"," There's nothing they can do."
"4689710","4696470"," You're likely going to get an explosion in the stock market to the upside."
"4697650","4699530"," And guess how long that lasts?"
"4701630","4703470"," Five, ten, fifteen years. "
"4706190","4709510"," And then you'll get stagnation."
"4710190","4712650"," If you're an older person out there, right?"
"4713190","4714730"," Right now you're an older person."
"4715350","4721590"," Think back to when $20 was like the high end for an entry-level worker. "
"4722370","4726390"," Think about how that became the low end over 15 or 20 years."
"4728550","4729630"," You get what I'm saying here?"
"4730590","4737990"," So if you're, if you, let's say you look back on the 1990s, early 2000s."
"4738690","4744030"," If you were making, you're making in the early 90s, $20, $30, now you're doing pretty good, right?"
"4745490","4750590"," And a lot of people up in 2015 made about $20 an hour. "
"4751490","4761430"," That whole cycle and now you're looking towards the next cycle for"
"4761430","4764730"," five, 10, 15, 20 years."
"4765370","4767350"," You're at the beginning of a new cycle."
"4768070","4776170"," I assure you out there that in 20 years, you're going to look back on this time, 15 years from"
"4776170","4782350"," now, you're going to be looking back and you're going to say, I never thought that an entry-level"
"4782350","4785670"," worker is making between $30 and $50 an hour. "
"4789550","4790450"," You understand?"
"4791670","4793870"," I mean, is this coming together for you?"
"4794930","4801490"," And there are already companies making these changes and adjustments to that."
"4802950","4809490"," So if you're a low-level blue collar worker and you're making $150k to $100k a year, what do you"
"4809490","4811590"," think rents are going to be?"
"4812770","4815310"," You think they're going back to $700 or $500?"
"4815630","4816390"," You're out of your mind."
"4817730","4819990"," You think they're going to go back down to $1,000?"
"4820290","4821070"," You're out of your mind. "
"4824010","4825850"," You think $1,500 a lot?"
"4826190","4827530"," You're out of your mind."
"4829590","4834710"," If anything, if you're young out there, plan on this happening."
"4838010","4841290"," Plan on this happening over the next five, 10, 15 years. "
"4841430","4847070"," People that tell you this is not the start of the next run, the next bull run for 15 years"
"4847070","4849250"," are out of their mind."
"4852630","4862190"," We're not looking on a one-minute"
"4863510","4868630"," So all the doom and gloom you hear out there, all the feds say and they're going to fight this,"
"4869310","4870250"," they're going to get rolled."
"4871710","4874390"," And you are eventually going to accept it. "
"4875130","4877310"," They're going to shove it down your throat."
"4878030","4882630"," It's going to take five or ten years, but you are eventually going to swallow it and eat it."
"4882730","4883850"," There's nothing they can do. "
"4884590","4888630"," And there are companies out there that are already planning for it."
"4889490","4890750"," They don't care."
"4891730","4897370"," What Jerome says, they don't care what you say on fin twit. "
"4897770","4907290"," They don't care about some some guy trying to make money in Wall Street, begging on Wall Street for"
"4907290","4911470"," TLT to pay him or bonds to pay his fat ass in New York."
"4912050","4913950"," They don't give a fuck about that guy."
"4914370","4916470"," They don't give a fuck about Carl Eichen. "
"4917110","4918510"," They don't care about Mike Barrie."
"4919170","4924370"," They don't care about the, I don't know, Tom Lee or whoever out there."
"4924430","4925370"," It doesn't matter who they are. "
"4926190","4930130"," All the doom and gloom you're selling out there is bullshit."
"4931430","4935470"," They're planning for what for wage spiral."
"4936070","4937270"," That's what they're planning for. "
"4938110","4940630"," They're negotiating contracts for it right now."
"4942530","4943750"," That's what they're doing."
"4947830","4949970"," We're on a one minute chart right now. "
"4957900","4961380"," I'm telling you, I'm gonna, I know you don't, but you're young."
"4961620","4962400"," You don't believe this."
"4962960","4967360"," If you're old, you're probably listening to this going, I know how this goes. "
"4968360","4971420"," I know how this goes."
"4972140","4977720"," And it's hard when you're young to hear this and to believe it because when I was young, I was"
"4977720","4980880"," like, now that'll never happen because I didn't have that experience."
"4982240","4987220"," But you're gonna be old one day and you're gonna remember this conversation that I have with you. "
"4987700","4989120"," You're gonna say that guy was right."
"4993780","4995480"," You understand what I'm saying to you out there?"
"4995660","4999940"," So still be looking for that big role, but we of course we've got seasonal."
"5000460","5005460"," I saw JPM came out yesterday and they're like, we're bearish into the into fall. "
"5005960","5008900"," I was like, I was like, JPM, even you were bearish in October."
"5009240","5010860"," You were bearish in May of last year."
"5011240","5013400"," You were bearish all the way this entire run. "
"5014020","5015680"," And JPM's like, we're still bearish into the fall."
"5016440","5018860"," I think we know that fall is already seasonally weak."
"5019520","5023340"," We already know that we were weak in February. "
"5023800","5024980"," Everybody knows that."
"5029380","5030720"," Sorry, I threw that in there."
"5031920","5035120"," It's gonna fight a bear JPM come out there and say that yesterday. "
"5038160","5041260"," Don't forget your implied move to the downside down here."
"5041260","5042480"," Pretty simple, right?"
"5043520","5045440"," Hit the implied upside move."
"5045900","5047780"," Hit the implied downside move. "
"5049980","5057080"," I was watching, I also read a story last night and I was reading the comments and I'm like, 70 "
"5057080","5062400","% of these fucking people, they were talking about NVDA and I'm like, 70% of these, they can't say"
"5062400","5062660"," the word."
"5063440","5069440"," Don't they realize that there's there's options that they're gonna print both sides."
"5071320","5075940"," And they're like, it's going up because of this and it's going down because of that. "
"5075960","5077200"," And I'm like, no, it's not."
"5077300","5078620"," It's fucking options market, man."
"5079760","5080580"," That's what it is. "
"5085460","5086780"," Let's take a look over here."
"5087760","5088760"," Let's take a look at the five minute."
"5090320","5092020"," I'm going back down now to check. "
"5093000","5096860"," We've got the previous or the midday low right here."
"5096980","5100640"," We got another low right here from."
"5103080","5107420"," This is the low that we're tagging right now from the 21st. "
"5107880","5111260"," And then we have the big boy down here, this implied move that you see."
"5111260","5114980"," This is the opening low from the 18th."
"5118340","5119920"," What is this showing you?"
"5120100","5121360"," Let me show you what this is showing you. "
"5122980","5127420"," So just right here, you've got the short squeeze here, right?"
"5128640","5129780"," Big old short squeeze."
"5130840","5132860"," We got the other short squeeze right here."
"5134140","5135960"," And what is that telling you, right?"
"5136260","5139640"," That short squeeze, they're buying back, selling the market up here. "
"5141020","5145920"," Coming back down now, and we know that they can have the ability to sell the market right where we"
"5145920","5146160"," are."
"5146780","5151160"," And head straight down here to the original buy down here."
"5152600","5156260"," Back on the, I believe that's the 18th right there. "
"5156420","5158220"," So they should give all this move back."
"5159480","5163260"," If you're a bull, you're looking for that nice double bottom down here."
"5165520","5166840"," Into next week. "
"5168460","5170740"," You also have S3."
"5170820","5171920"," This is the weekly trigger."
"5173640","5174700"," Right down there. "
"5174980","5177380"," We also have the JPM magnet down below."
"5178120","5182520"," So you can also see that, that, that you know now that, what do you know, right?"
"5182740","5184080"," What can you extrapolate from this?"
"5185980","5186460"," Right?"
"5186680","5188040"," We already know we're in negative gamma."
"5188460","5190260"," We already know that we're in the market. "
"5191060","5196340"," And we already know that any of this squeeze in here is just squeezing, right?"
"5196500","5202340"," Buying it back just once again, short it down and look to find out if there are real buyers here"
"5202340","5205660"," or real support in the marketplace."
"5206540","5208720"," And we know that this is not the bottom."
"5209160","5211460"," We know where the next level down is. "
"5211940","5213340"," We know that it's at 426."
"5214420","5222960"," And we also have a band down here at 427, 422, 423, 95 down there."
"5223040","5224380"," That's the next real support. "
"5224990","5227360"," We know all this is Fugazi and fake."
"5230000","5234140"," So we're going to find out down here if this actually gets bought."
"5235360","5238420"," Is this real demand or not down here?"
"5238580","5239920"," We know right now this is not. "
"5241100","5244500"," But we know that we know that the employee, we're bringing the implied move over here."
"5245320","5251260"," Applied moves down here at 433.02. This happens to also be where demand was the last time."
"5251880","5253040"," Right down this vicinity. "
"5255120","5258260"," See if he gets some more continuation to the downside here."
"5259600","5262000"," You're going to be wanting to check this right here."
"5262260","5262640"," Right here. "
"5262740","5264400"," You want to check to see if this stays live."
"5264660","5266640"," If not, go squeeze it all the way up here."
"5268760","5270600"," Bring this back down right there. "
"5271080","5275820"," If you're a regular watcher of the show, you already know all this stuff."
"5276260","5278660"," You know how this plays itself out."
"5279520","5282580"," Don't ever get caught inside of the box here. "
"5283180","5285020"," This is the no go zone in here."
"5285040","5285900"," It's where you get cut up."
"5286460","5294660"," If you're looking to become bullish, you know you're looking for price to break above and check"
"5294660","5295680"," right about there. "
"5296820","5298400"," Then you can take along again."
"5300480","5301020"," Right."
"5301240","5302600"," New trade right now for bulls. "
"5306740","5308760"," Well, I guess you could take this trade right here."
"5309800","5314920"," You could take that trade, but you have to sell it."
"5321630","5322750"," Just in here. "
"5333480","5334600"," Oh, wait for me."
"5334740","5335180"," Wait for me."
"5335240","5335560"," Hold on. "
"5335800","5336280"," Hold on."
"5336360","5336760"," Wait for me."
"5340580","5340980"," Goddamn. "
"5341140","5342240"," I just missed 10 cents."
"5344880","5346460"," I just missed the 10 cents."
"5346640","5348860"," I just missed 10 cents on that fucking trade right there. "
"5357850","5359770"," Watch out for the ping pong in here."
"5360990","5362430"," Rejection somewhere in here."
"5372010","5376150"," The one second here, we're in a trade. "
"5444520","5446400"," Keep on squeezing."
"5447320","5448420"," Don't stop now."
"5449160","5450940"," Keep on squeezing. "
"5451800","5457220"," Keep on squeezing."
"5458200","5471160"," Keep on"
"5471160","5471780"," squeezing."
"5471780","5472120"," in. "
"5476780","5478680"," Do one more green bar, baby."
"5479820","5483580"," Do one more green bar right there."
"5495310","5497430"," Go. "
"5512070","5521490"," Whoo hoo."
"5524110","5524910"," I'm out."
"5531230","5535470"," Whoo hoo. "
"5536290","5538390"," Nice little quick two minute trade right there."
"5538650","5549830"," Whoo hoo."
"5551590","5557330"," Whoo hoo. "
"5558490","5559530"," You guys know it."
"5559650","5562710"," If you're watching me right now for the first time, you guys know what this is right here."
"5563190","5564430"," It's a little box in here, okay?"
"5565330","5572530"," If you want to trade this as a bull, you can trade this right in here, right?"
"5572790","5575130"," There should be a pullback. "
"5575770","5578050"," You'll see this white line come up right here."
"5579230","5581210"," You should catch a bounce right here."
"5582610","5586350"," It'll push higher and fail right about there. "
"5587750","5594970"," Come back down right there and then whoo, right up there and then fail."
"5594970","5598270"," As long as you stay on this white line right here, you should be good."
"5601110","5604230"," Keep your eyes on this red line right here inside this box. "
"5609990","5613710"," Keep your eye on the yellow and the white line right here."
"5615790","5617850"," I'm going to give you three places."
"5619730","5620950"," There's one right there. "
"5623030","5624930"," Nope, that one's gone now."
"5628250","5629950"," So you got a target right here."
"5631290","5632450"," Target right there. "
"5633250","5634530"," Target right there."
"5636130","5637310"," Target right there."
"5637470","5638170"," We already did that one. "
"5638570","5639310"," One, two, three, four."
"5644770","5647010"," Don't get trapped in this box right here."
"5648270","5655190"," One of the worst things in this box is getting caught in consolidation here. "
"5656430","5659570"," So if you're going to look to buy, it's always, it's always buy down here."
"5661950","5668410"," And then if we have the break above at any point, come back down, you buy right there too."
"5675090","5676690"," One minute chart we're on right now. "
"5678510","5680950"," Keep your eyes down here if you're looking to buy another dip."
"5688470","5690170"," It's a nice little squeeze right there."
"5690210","5693830"," That should printed 90 fucking six cents right there. "
"5694790","5696090"," From like 70 to 90."
"5700790","5703170"," NVDA down minus three, four, four percent."
"5710610","5715150"," Polish candle on the half hour candle on spoos. "
"5722300","5726340"," Dip by on NVDA and it's daily trigger just now, just heads up."
"5727380","5729320"," NVDA with a dip by and it's daily trigger."
"5738500","5747320"," It's implied move to the downside, but the 25th was 426.39. So wait and see if NVDA can get"
"5747320","5753560"," up to 471.39 and then roll down to its 427 into the close today. "
"5753560","5764870"," So right down"
"5764870","5768910"," here, if you're looking to get in a quick trade, right there is your next buy in."
"5774920","5778020"," We'll take a look at the five minute chart real quick."
"5781340","5790820"," Remember that if as long as price stays above the 27 EMA, this right here as long as price stays"
"5790820","5792060"," under, we're bearish, right?"
"5794940","5796620"," On an intraday basis. "
"5797380","5803160"," So right here, what do you want to see to get bullish?"
"5804440","5810820"," You want to see price get above this red box up here and fail right here."
"5812100","5814000"," Back down, trade that."
"5815620","5821020"," We already actually broke through the hourly, so we should go even higher possibly. "
"5822400","5822880"," Possible."
"5824640","5825960"," Keep your eyes on this."
"5831110","5831850"," It's possible. "
"5840520","5843080"," Keep our eyes right here and just watch this right here."
"5843180","5845660"," We want to see the interaction here in this white."
"5848700","5851100"," We want to see what the interaction is right here. "
"5857040","5859140"," Good fucking Friday, dude, making money."
"5876000","5877900"," USO just the heads up to you."
"5877980","5883400"," If you're looking for a buy in on USO, it's looking extremely bullish again. "
"5886740","5888820"," It's holding on its hourly trigger."
"5889040","5890720"," It's on the bottom of its bar right now."
"5891040","5893400"," So I'm going to give this to me and bring this over to you real quick. "
"5893420","5894260"," I'll switch over to this."
"5897880","5901480"," So yesterday talked about USO."
"5901620","5902500"," CIO would be great. "
"5902780","5903740"," CLF for oil."
"5905040","5906300"," It's a great trade here."
"5907040","5908540"," A couple of things to watch. "
"5908780","5910840"," You've got the double bottom on oil."
"5910840","5913740"," I'm not going to show this to you here because it's not another computer."
"5914760","5921020"," But there's a giant, giant, giant iceberg right here. "
"5921720","5925100"," It's like massive, massive, massive."
"5925900","5930340"," And you're watching that iceberg just crash right in right here."
"5935800","5937140"," So here's oil. "
"5939680","5941940"," Beautiful pullback onto its daily trigger."
"5941940","5945640"," This here is very bullish watching this action right here."
"5946040","5947400"," It's daily as holding. "
"5947760","5948840"," It's daily as coming up."
"5951660","5955440"," Now it got close to where I wanted it to go in just one day."
"5958080","5960780"," You can see these sellers here. "
"5963220","5966920"," You can see this coiling coming down right here."
"5967220","5967680"," Bam, bam."
"5968040","5969620"," We know there's no demand here. "
"5970840","5977340"," You get a nice fat squeeze on this."
"5977540","5978500"," Nice measured move."
"5980680","5986240"," Trade 74.55. It'd be a nice target right up here. "
"5988480","5992640"," Trade is dead below 7184."
"5995580","5997100"," First target's hit."
"5997960","5999240"," Second target right here. "
"5999240","6001520"," Third target above it's 75 flat."
"6003240","6008860"," There's some people claiming that will trade $100 by end of year."
"6009060","6010200"," I don't believe that personally. "
"6011220","6016440"," I think like 74 is plenty for USO."
"6024940","6026140"," No buyers here."
"6026180","6027840"," I'm not a buyer here either, by the way. "
"6028000","6029180"," So I'm not buying this at all."
"6030060","6032940"," Closing bars underneath the white line right here."
"6032940","6038240"," If you're a bear, you might get another trade to the downside here. "
"6038860","6040940"," If you can get some closing bars in here."
"6041560","6043720"," One, two, and then it'll come right down here."
"6044600","6052120"," Price target 434.07. We'll see if they get the rejection candle here. "
"6057770","6060910"," So if you're looking for this, you're looking for this candle to end."
"6062390","6065910"," That's 436.32. Have your finger on the sell button."
"6068230","6073830"," If that candle turns around, you'll have a pretty decent trade to the downside right here. "
"6076530","6077610"," Right there."
"6079090","6082910"," Just keep watching this candle."
"6084110","6085730"," No reversal yet to the downside. "
"6097810","6099670"," No trade for bears yet either."
"6099810","6101450"," No trade for bulls, no trade for bears."
"6106270","6107950"," This is right here, man. "
"6108050","6109950"," This is the no mess around in here."
"6110150","6111630"," No messing around in here."
"6165440","6170820"," There's now 168,000 puts coming on the market on 435 P."
"6193090","6194150"," Still flat here. "
"6195330","6198110"," I've got a 434 P set up."
"6198930","6201450"," They're 58 cents right now, but I haven't bought them."
"6201930","6204150"," They're just set up in case I have to hit that fucking thing. "
"6204210","6205990"," I'm looking to see if we get closing bars down here."
"6222570","6223750"," I'm going to tell you what, man."
"6224330","6230730"," I'm going to tell you what, like Dixie, coming back up into resistance right now, we're known. "
"6231990","6238710"," Known sellers are at 104.78. They didn't even buy in the step, not selling it."
"6238710","6244410"," So might actually be buying the step."
"6245470","6247030"," Might take a minute here. "
"6250630","6256140"," I want to see if we get a rejection on Dixie here."
"6258160","6259840"," What's the upside target here?"
"6260560","6262220"," That target's pretty fucking high, isn't it?"
"6262860","6263440"," 439."
"6267720","6270960"," Oh boy, they're just loading the fucking boat with puts right now. "
"6271060","6277700"," Now there's 168,436s, 168,435s."
"6289210","6291350"," Someone's loading the boat with puts right now."
"6291790","6293570"," Right now as we're talking, zero dates. "
"6294590","6295270"," Hit tons of them."
"6295650","6296310"," Waterfall puts."
"6308800","6317200"," This whole area above here, so they've been tracking this for months now, like this 104.78, 105.08,"
"6317520","6320920"," 105.43 on Dixie. "
"6322760","6328400"," This is going back to March 8th."
"6330440","6337040"," I mean, you start getting those highs on Dixie, man, and it's set to make the market explode to the"
"6337040","6337280"," upside."
"6338520","6339060"," Explode. "
"6342930","6345770"," Like you keep getting this squeezed in here in Dixie."
"6346610","6353810"," Like if Dixie trades like 105, I haven't talked much about this, but I want to tell you something."
"6355270","6361090"," If Dixie trades that 105 and a half or 107 or anything like that, right?"
"6361750","6368650"," The price of the S&P 500 is not at 3500. "
"6371390","6373010"," So in relation."
"6384050","6389130"," In relation to the price of the S&P 500."
"6389850","6399830"," Now I talked to you guys about where price is relevant to trading 43 cents on"
"6399830","6400850"," 439 right now. "
"6400890","6402370"," They were 36 just a moment ago."
"6403370","6405810"," Trading 45 cents, 44 cents."
"6407270","6414830"," So there's something that's unique about the stock market right now, and that is that Dixie was"
"6414830","6415230"," trading. "
"6416310","6422910"," Oh, and our low in March Dixie was trading a dollar 596, right?"
"6424130","6430450"," The major low back in October was 114 dollars."
"6430450","6439040"," And we know that somewhere around that 105, 43."
"6439720","6446840"," Trading 51 cents right now. "
"6449260","6450020"," 49."
"6455500","6457360"," Come on, baby, keep on pushing."
"6458620","6459280"," Give me that squeeze. "
"6460540","6461700"," Give me that squeeze."
"6462700","6464240"," Trade 438."
"6470960","6472720"," Trade that 438, 77. "
"6474780","6476280"," Squeeze up there."
"6482780","6484280"," It's almost 100% trade."
"6491500","6493460"," That's 36 cents now that trading 50. "
"6510220","6512140"," Trading 53 right now, 51."
"6512780","6514320"," Trying to cut some of this off right now."
"6515080","6516300"," I'm going to get a little bit left here. "
"6517420","6520340"," I want to see if we can get up to, I want to see if we can squeeze this right"
"6520340","6520800"," here."
"6522660","6526760"," So you'll see like, dipage, and then that move right there."
"6530160","6534500"," Trading 54 right now in 439, there were 36 just a few moments ago. "
"6538390","6539690"," Come on, baby, push."
"6546840","6548760"," Trading 56 right now."
"6555220","6563160"," So I'm watching this Dixie, like Dixie, right?"
"6563160","6566700"," I've been thinking about the past few days, and I'm like, I'm like, I kind of like that. "
"6566860","6571620"," We're at the 430s, 440s, 450s trading 64 cents right now."
"6572200","6575420"," 25 left on that 66 cents right now."
"6592180","6593140"," All right. "
"6596880","6599220"," A bullish reversal happening right now."
"6599680","6602420"," If you're looking for this trade higher, the price target is right here."
"6605760","6607340"," That's the price target just before. "
"6614410","6615350"," Hold on a second here."
"6627260","6629980"," If you're trying to jump on it, there it is right there."
"6632600","6634740"," Maybe you can jump on that one to get up there. "
"6644410","6645890"," Trading 65."
"6646430","6647570"," I'm not in this trade anymore."
"6647750","6657310"," I'm out trading 65 trading 64 66 on 439 67 69 71"
"6657310","6660870"," 73 72. "
"6662750","6666670"," I should have stayed in that fucking trade."
"6669750","6671190"," 20 20 hindsight."
"6672810","6674450"," 74 cents. "
"6680760","6681840"," Kiss it."
"6682780","6683820"," Get up there and kiss it."
"6684640","6685660"," Slap that PT. "
"6687300","6689040"," Slap it like a bad doggy."
"6695330","6697190"," Trading 81 right now."
"6703970","6705910"," Trading 36 just a few minutes ago. "
"6710160","6711460"," Don't tease me with a good time."
"6712680","6713760"," I'll jump on it again."
"6714100","6715880"," So just don't even tease me with a good time. "
"6716140","6717540"," You want to tease me with a good time?"
"6718840","6721940"," You want to tease me with a good time and you want to come back down here and then hit"
"6721940","6722100"," it?"

"10925090","10927610"," So let's look at it."
"10927890","10930410"," Let's go back to the main screen here."
"10932470","10933630"," And where is that move?"
"10933890","10934530"," Do you know where it is?"
"10935470","10935870"," Whoa. "
"10936750","10940610"," What do we say it was?"

"10941550","10942890"," Hold on, let me check the check the move."
"10944590","10947510"," Let me just check it here and see where the move actually is. "

"10974010","10975890"," If you're like, oh, Cap, I want to get out of this. "
"10975990","10976370"," I'm scared."
"10976410","10977170"," You can do that."
"10977410","10978010"," Sell right here. "
"10979330","10981210"," All right, they're going to come back down and check this stuff."
"10981490","10982830"," It's going to get violent in here."
"10982870","10987310"," You're going to see like violence and trying to stop it and roll it down. "
"10987990","10994390"," So you can take the money here and you can wait until we get above it and take your second"
"10994390","10995290"," trade right here."
"10995310","10997690"," That's the way you should do it in case it fails, right?"
"10998490","10999870"," It's like you don't mess around in here."
"10999870","11001190"," You take your money and run. "
"11001550","11006190"," You wait for the initial squeeze up and then the market should squeeze above this point, right?"
"11007250","11012030"," He'd be waiting for this line to come up."
"11012150","11013530"," He'd be waiting for this box."
"11016650","11018990"," He waiting for this gray one right here to come up. "
"11019850","11021890"," He waiting for this red one to come up."
"11024710","11025490"," Right here."
"11025810","11028270"," And then you'd be looking for the initial squeeze higher. "
"11028390","11035190"," You wait for this to happen and then you wait for the confirmation right here and then you take it"
"11035190","11036050"," for that 442."
"11036730","11037250"," Does that make sense?"
"11037750","11038770"," I'm still long here myself."
"11039010","11039370"," I haven't sold. "
"11040290","11046510"," So and they're going to try to reverse this on you right now, right?"
"11046650","11048610"," They're going to try to tell you know we're not going up there."
"11048790","11049790"," Why are they going to tell you that?"
"11050590","11052270"," Because of that move is so large."
"11052270","11052810"," Look at that. "
"11053530","11055590"," That Valhalla move is right here, right?"
"11056250","11059350"," They don't want to see this giant fucking move up here, do they?"
"11059990","11060770"," That's screaming."
"11061110","11062390"," That's screaming move to 440."
"11062750","11064250"," I said 442 and 20. "
"11064770","11065610"," It was a little bit lower."
"11065790","11066370"," It's like here."
"11067470","11070090"," Maybe I'll maybe I'll let me I'll write it out for you. "

"11074130","11074330"," I got this. "
"11074430","11075530"," I want to make sure I get this exact."
"11076170","11077730"," I got that exact right here."
"11080610","11082530"," Let's just go with 443 44. "
"11085550","11086530"," I'm all right there."

"11118690","11123710"," The target to the upside is going to be 442 44."
"11130430","11133050"," 442 44 to the upside."
"11133510","11136990"," If you break above the hourly trigger right here. "

"11647570","11647970"," Yeah."
"11648130","11648590"," Wrong one. "

"11649750","11650250"," Hold on Sam."
"11651130","11652090"," Let's figure screen."
"11652410","11653510"," We'll go over to this one right here. "
"11655150","11657110"," So just watching this right here, right?"
"11657290","11657410"," Develop."
"11657750","11659270"," I want to pay attention to this right here."
"11661430","11665230"," So if you're like panicking or whatever, just be two things. "
"11665290","11666130"," I want you to see here."
"11666150","11668110"," We're going to switch over to ES two for you."
"11669830","11671230"," So you're going to see this right?"
"11671430","11672630"," I want you to see two things. "
"11673030","11676410"," First one is this trend line, right?"
"11676910","11680910"," Remember we said don't buy this and it broke down below."
"11681170","11682690"," Rejected came all the way down here."
"11683250","11687370"," We're watching this V shaped right now and they're going to try to revenge this. "
"11687970","11690170"," They don't want to see that squeeze higher here."
"11690290","11690550"," Do they?"
"11691050","11693050"," It's not going to be easy to break above."
"11693590","11695370"," Now there's something to be said here, okay?"
"11696670","11697570"," Watch this close. "
"11700110","11702310"," So you see all this garbage going on in here?"
"11704150","11706950"," But you don't want to see trade is dead."
"11707170","11707630"," Listen to me closely."
"11708670","11709750"," Trade is dead. "
"11712110","11714370"," Mark this at home on your charts at home."
"11716990","11718810"," This is what I'm looking for right here."
"11718930","11721210"," See this box right here, this gray box that I drew?"
"11722010","11725990"," What I don't want to see is I don't want to see this half hour bar right here, okay?"
"11726070","11726930"," It's a half an hour bar. "
"11727850","11729070"," Look, don't I want to see?"
"11729830","11732370"," I don't want to see a closing bar."
"11733270","11734150"," I'll rate that red."
"11735870","11741050"," Hold you guys are all like you guys are all in your one minute charts and I'm watching for this. "
"11741430","11744410"," I don't want to see that do I right?"
"11744650","11745970"," Get underneath all the moving averages."
"11746710","11748030"," They roll over."
"11749850","11752170"," So you see kind of stuff like that happen. "
"11752870","11755190"," See kind of stuff like that happen, right?"
"11755410","11755930"," That kind of shit."
"11756670","11759830"," And then what happens is we reverse to the downside over here, okay?"
"11760750","11761670"," And it gets really ugly."
"11761870","11762650"," We go back down here. "
"11762730","11766090"," We end up testing this previous low and they pin the market, right?"
"11766770","11769130"," So that's what I'm watching for is this right here."
"11769910","11771530"," You see how they're trying to do that right now?"
"11771610","11775030"," They're slamming down trying to break below, right?"
"11775190","11776690"," That's what the intent is here."
"11778050","11783410"," So you can see it right now on, oh is it weebel main screen?"
"11784010","11785490"," It's right where we are right now, right?"
"11785670","11791290"," They're trying to slam this down and just break below it, right?"

"17244060","17245320"," You're going to chase this."
"17247600","17252590"," Deal here is this."
"17252830","17253490"," I want to show you this. "
"17253770","17256770"," A big deal here is checking that hourly figure right?"
"17257350","17262070"," You guys already know the rules that has to hold to get up there to Valhalla right?"
"17263470","17264850"," What's the safe play?"
"17265990","17268890"," Safe play is to look for a tip to bite out here."
"17270010","17274550"," If you didn't have the intestinal fortitude I don't blame you it's not easy."
"17275050","17275830"," It's not fucking easy. "
"17276330","17277130"," Let's get serious here."
"17277930","17278770"," It ain't fucking easy."
"17282090","17284530"," So if you're like I'm just going to run this up. "
"17285450","17287710"," It's going to roll down here likely, okay?"
"17292040","17296380"," Now if you're like I want to train it safe then you're just going to be waiting down here."
"17296520","17298420"," You're down here if you're going to take it safe."
"17300840","17307940"," So you're looking for a pullback in confirmation to go up, okay?"
"17309140","17310860"," So we're going to switch over really quick. "
"17313940","17315340"," How am I looking for here?"
"17316940","17318520"," So let's see it right there."
"17318640","17320840"," There's that big giant squeeze right?"
"17322700","17325420"," You got something you got something to worry about up here."
"17325480","17331700"," That red mark right here this one is where the sellers were before right?"
"17331980","17333040"," We know they were right here. "
"17334060","17335500"," We know that's where they are right?"
"17336840","17342240"," So even if we go straight up there you know they're going to try to sell you again right?"
"17342480","17343080"," You know they are."
"17343640","17347860"," You also know that this green right here you need to confirm at some point."
"17349140","17350140"," Is it valid?"
"17354020","17361520"," Let's take a look here right and clean out the rest of those sellers up here right?"
"17362860","17365060"," 443, 444. "
"17367340","17371520"," So you got to you got to think to yourself what am I to do here right?"
"17372240","17374500"," Now this is a half an hour candle here right?"
"17374600","17376420"," We talk about the half hour here all the time right?"
"17377960","17382400"," You got the initial half hour candle and what are they going to try to do?"
"17382600","17387580"," They're going to try to pull it back down for the next half hour candle and then you get another"
"17387580","17388720"," push up right?"
"17389480","17390200"," So do you see that?"
"17390320","17395340"," You get your first half hour candle then your second half hour bullish candle right?"
"17396220","17398040"," So you're going to check the time right now."
"17398200","17399020"," What time is it?"
"17399580","17400220"," It's 4th."
"17400400","17400980"," What time is it?"
"17401480","17401980"," Check your watch. "
"17403220","17406460"," 230 in the afternoon right?"
"17407220","17409480"," So this candle is going to end right?"
"17409940","17411620"," This candle is going to end right here."
"17413800","17416000"," So what are they going to try to do your next candle?"
"17417200","17419440"," What are they going to try to do for this second candle?"
"17420260","17421460"," They're going to try to push it down."
"17421820","17423080"," That's a question mark by the way. "
"17424600","17427860"," They're going to try to push this down here right?"
"17429480","17434300"," So they're going to try to push this down to the half hour and then you get your big push"
"17434300","17435140"," up here right?"
"17435540","17436540"," That's they're going to try to do."
"17438200","17444800"," So let's take a look back on the weebel chart and and they're squeezing up right now to grab this"
"17444800","17445020"," one."
"17445100","17446320"," See them squeezing to grab it?"
"17449000","17452400"," I'm going to grab this right now and they're going to try to grab this one next. "
"17453800","17454280"," Right?"
"17454560","17456200"," So you're going to try to squeeze up, grab this one."
"17457620","17465580"," But you know that you have this next half an hour where's that candle likely going to end here and"
"17465580","17469160"," it's likely going to be here."
"17469320","17471720"," This is your next half an hour training zone right here. "
"17472480","17473020"," You see that?"
"17474040","17476640"," So this whole area is your next half an hour."
"17477080","17477680"," Does that make sense?"
"17479800","17486060"," So you're either going to be waiting for the low and the half an hour to grab this or you"
"17486060","17490060"," just ride this up and then look for a dip on the low of the half an"
"17490060","17501310"," hour to"
"17505510","17509210"," before we just put a big giant half an hour candle right here, don't we?"
"17509430","17510390"," And just go straight up."
"17518020","17520360"," Or we just go balls to the wall. "
"17521000","17530320"," I will warn you if this half hour candle is right here, I'm going to warn you of something."
"17531300","17533820"," All that shit's coming back, okay?"
"17534540","17535080"," All of it."
"17535500","17536400"," All entire thing. "
"17537000","17540820"," If you get that half hour candle it just like rips some faces off up here."
"17541360","17542660"," That shit's all coming back."
"17542860","17543880"," You ain't keeping all that shit. "
"17545120","17547800"," So like extreme bullishness."
"17548460","17550420"," That shit tends to come back every time."
"17560650","17562270"," Free money Friday. "
"17564270","17565870"," Free money Friday."
"17566670","17570510"," Now let's say you're like, I want to go up here, Cap, but I want to wait for a pullback."
"17570750","17571510"," What are you looking at here?"
"17573410","17575230"," 4.42.85, right?"
"17575550","17577110"," 4.43s or 6 cents. "
"17578110","17579870"," They likely don't want to pay those."
"17580790","17582270"," So maybe one strike higher."
"17586490","17588810"," 4.42s or 19 cents. "
"17590250","17591830"," Put a little bit of skin in the game."
"17592370","17594990"," If we begin to roll here."
"17598650","17600530"," You could, if you're like, I want to put some risk on. "
"17600570","17601590"," I made a bunch of money to take with the cap."
"17601890","17603490"," Let's buy some, let's buy some more calls."
"17604110","17604970"," Buy some more calls. "
"17608790","17610150"," Put a stop right here."
"17612930","17614390"," Buy some more calls right now."
"17615250","17618170"," 5.4.42s. Worst case scenario. "
"17619510","17621590"," Worst case scenario going to come back down here."
"17622850","17623930"," Continue higher, right?"
"17624690","17625330"," Raise some stops."
"17625330","17629270"," I should not, not financial advice by the way. "
"17634110","17638050"," 4.40s trading a dollar 11 right now."
"17638290","17640110"," Guess what they were trading a little while ago."
"17640950","17642270"," 16 cents. "

"17761950","17763150"," And I was buying bottoms."
"17764090","17765550"," And I was scared."
"17767210","17770990"," And that guy, that guy, that guy, man, he was the only person I trusted. "
"17772270","17773670"," He trades a system."

"17777790","17778650"," His is simpler. "
"17781130","17782870"," No, wait a minute, wrong, wrong chat."
"17783890","17788210"," Now this is a link to the Piz BG all that he trades."

"17792810","17794110"," The one that I trade."
"17794570","17795930"," Wait a minute, I'm trading all this in the wrong place."
"17796370","17796650"," There you go. "

"17804730","17806730"," So there's three free things right there, right?"
"17807010","17809770"," This stream is free five days a week. "

"17811330","17812850"," It's hard to be here every day."
"17812850","17814690"," I'm trying to be here the entire day. "
"17815070","17816870"," So there's gonna be times when I can't be here."
"17817030","17823750"," Sometimes I have technical issues, that kind of stuff, but the intent is to be here every day year"
"17823750","17826190"," round for you as much as I possibly can."

"17853270","17856670"," I haven't been on Twitter a ton lately, and it's not because I don't want to. "
"17856950","17858330"," It's because I can't."

"17980720","17982140"," So I'm going to look right here. "
"17982220","17983380"," Watch my cursor over here."
"17983840","17985640"," And there's this one here."
"17985760","17992080"," And this is the one, this is the one where you get the test off the hourly trigger. "
"17992980","17993760"," You ready?"
"17994520","18004140"," You can't be bullish intraday after a squeeze on the hourly trigger."
"18005000","18005760"," Can you?"
"18006460","18009160"," You want to show you just a recent example of that?"
"18010380","18011680"," Right there, right?"
"18013740","18016760"," We squeezed off the hourly trigger and what they do?"
"18017560","18018600"," Blast it us down, right?"
"18019840","18022560"," So these are very dangerous here, right?"
"18025740","18027180"," Very dangerous here, right?"
"18028500","18031480"," You don't want to get trapped in the box over here, do you?"
"18032700","18035720"," And you have to think about what's happening into the clothes."
"18036160","18037960"," You have to think about a lot of things here. "
"18040180","18042660"," You've got dealers that don't want to pay you."
"18043200","18044760"," I assure you, they don't want to pay you."
"18046900","18050320"," So are they going to roll you down here, consolidate all this crap?"
"18050540","18052680"," And then they do this up here, at the end of the day. "
"18053080","18054040"," Thank you for playing."
"18054720","18057460"," We went where you wanted us to go, but we're not paying you."
"18059180","18063800"," Do we bounce off this 2070MA and go straight up?"
"18065720","18067400"," Next big question, right?"
"18068460","18075800"," So if you wanted to start a position here and you're like, cap, nope, we're going to just go bur"
"18075800","18076480"," straight up. "
"18077120","18079540"," And it's 2.30, right?"
"18079780","18081260"," So you pretty much have until what?"
"18081460","18081820"," Three?"
"18082400","18085360"," You have like, you could probably bullish from now until like what?"
"18086440","18086920"," 255?"
"18088320","18090560"," And there's a second trade until what time?"
"18091240","18093200"," 2.30, 2.40 in the afternoon, right?"
"18093960","18100660"," Excuse me, 3.20, 3.30 in the afternoon, right?"
"18100960","18103740"," And then you got the dealers, you got all this other crap going on over here."
"18104320","18105400"," What's crap over here, right?"
"18106380","18108400"," You know that the sellers are back here already."
"18110640","18113040"," You know they're going to try to sell you down right here, right?"
"18115020","18116240"," So we know they're here. "
"18116520","18117460"," We know they're here."
"18117560","18119300"," We know that a seller is right there."
"18124430","18126050"," So what would make you more bullish?"
"18126350","18127910"," Let's say you didn't want to take this risk here. "
"18129930","18131830"," Now you could put a little box right here."
"18134670","18136490"," We already hit this target basically."
"18137870","18144250"," So you could say to yourself, well, maybe we trade here and then we trade there, right?"
"18146210","18149490"," And we put stops underneath this gray box right here, right?"
"18150210","18151850"," So you don't get trapped, right?"
"18152770","18153950"," You don't want to get trapped, do you?"
"18154630","18158410"," So how about we look for a trade right here?"
"18163790","18168050"," And you look at yourself on zero dates or one day, it might even be better for you. "
"18169130","18171830"," And you look to see if you catch a bounce here."
"18172430","18178170"," So if you get a red bar here, and then you get a green bar, green bar, green bar, you"
"18178170","18181550"," could look for this part of the trade."
"18183450","18186570"," So you're not going to take the trade until you get right here. "
"18187330","18188730"," You don't enter it here."
"18189570","18190810"," You wait for it right here."
"18191010","18192610"," So watch this right now. "
"18192610","18196330"," So watch this test."
"18196830","18197310"," You're going to wait."
"18198290","18199130"," You're not buying that. "
"18201350","18202850"," Let me get this yellow go in here."
"18207830","18209750"," You're not buying that white bar."
"18210230","18211010"," Trust me. "
"18213050","18216090"," You're going to see if this happens."
"18217230","18219190"," And you're going to watch for green bars."
"18220150","18221170"," They might not happen. "
"18221510","18223230"," You're going to watch them wait for them."
"18224230","18230210"," If you see something like this, you're going to get ready to enter."
"18230370","18232030"," You're going to set up the trade, right?"
"18232170","18234930"," As you say, set up the trade, right?"
"18235150","18235990"," This would actually go lower. "
"18237110","18238130"," You're going to set it up."
"18238370","18242350"," So and you want it as we get closer to the end of the day, you want it to be"
"18242350","18243370"," more in the money, right?"
"18243370","18247310"," It's like a 4.41, 4.42, right?"
"18247630","18250010"," You already know right here, you got 4.41, 20."
"18251730","18253870"," So 4.41s are 38 cents, right?"
"18254670","18256930"," So you want to see this via green bar. "
"18257270","18261970"," You want to see it go up, come back down, and then start going up."
"18263850","18267330"," You want to have some tight stops probably on that too, right?"
"18269290","18270790"," You don't want to get caught in this."
"18274490","18278290"," And let's say you're more conservative as a bull. "
"18279750","18282190"," You're probably waiting for this down here, right?"
"18283470","18285230"," And you already know where support is."
"18285410","18285870"," It's right there."
"18288030","18289410"," You already know where it is. "
"18289770","18290870"," That's where real support is."
"18295660","18296660"," So be patient."
"18297500","18299580"," Then you have something else to think about, right?"
"18299880","18301760"," You've got the half hour bar. "
"18302720","18305080"," And we talked about that a moment ago, didn't we?"
"18307160","18308900"," Talked about this bar right here."
"18308980","18310340"," There's the half hour bar, right?"
"18310460","18311740"," This is the half hour bar right here."
"18312520","18313680"," It's half an hour bar. "
"18315460","18317660"," You know where support is right here, right?"
"18318560","18326400"," So if you get your second bar has a low wear right there and you already know where the high"
"18326400","18327720"," is, right?"
"18327960","18330000"," So where are you trying to buy this bar?"
"18330300","18331460"," Probably down here, right?"
"18332400","18333380"," You don't have to."
"18333920","18336460"," How do you know if we're going higher than half an hour?"
"18336860","18339420"," You break above here, right?"
"18339740","18340200"," See it right there?"
"18341240","18342940"," See what price is right now?"
"18344120","18351000"," If this price starts to go above, like here, and you know there's a good chance that we're going to"
"18351000","18352880"," go up here and tag this next target."
"18353460","18357500"," It's 441.20. And furthermore up here, 442. "
"18358260","18358640"," 40."
"18359060","18362200"," And further up here, right up there, sorry."
"18363120","18367160"," Down, down, well, okay?"
"18368040","18372680"," So if you don't know what I'm talking about right now, if you don't have any understanding of what"
"18372680","18375880"," I'm talking about right now, we're not even talking about Velo right now. "
"18375940","18378520"," We're just talking about, uh, trading."
"18380440","18383120"," No Velo involved in this right now, just trading."
"18383480","18388280"," So right here, you already know where the half hour bar is, right?"
"18388520","18389740"," Right here, you don't really know where it is. "
"18390100","18391140"," Here's a 30 minute bar."
"18397010","18398730"," See that 30 minute bar right there?"
"18399650","18400590"," That's a 30 minute bar."
"18401850","18403690"," Okay, so this is weevil. "
"18404870","18407870"," With 30 minute bar, we're watching the clock at home."
"18408050","18408490"," I'm not joking."
"18409450","18411150"," You're watching the clock at home. "
"18411970","18413690"," Stock market runs on the half an hour."
"18413750","18415890"," It starts at 9 30 and it's at 4 30, okay?"
"18416410","18418250"," Half hour, half hour, half hour, half hour."
"18418690","18424010"," 12 o'clock is a half an hour, 12 30, half an hour, one o'clock, half an hour. "
"18425450","18426910"," So this is your top tick."
"18428230","18431030"," So far, this is your bottom tick on a half an hour."
"18431790","18433790"," This is known support down here. "
"18434390","18437270"," They would love to get that big one down here, wouldn't they?"
"18438330","18440770"," Where's your half hour support right here?"
"18441090","18441530"," Look at it."
"18441910","18444390"," They just tagged it half an hour support right here."
"18446470","18450970"," Probably going to turn green right now and look at it. "
"18450970","18451370"," It is."
"18451590","18455130"," Here's a one minute and they're buying it right on the half hour low right here."
"18456130","18457150"," There goes the turn. "
"18457310","18457730"," You see it?"
"18458710","18460190"," That goes the turn to the upside."
"18461310","18461870"," You see it?"
"18462050","18462850"," One, two, and watch."
"18462850","18464110"," They're going to turn this right up. "
"18466570","18468410"," You're going to turn this right up right now."
"18468790","18471670"," Get the new high in the half an hour."
"18476930","18478670"," You guys understand what I'm talking about here?"
"18478830","18479330"," Hopefully at home. "
"18479810","18484690"," If you don't, stick around in this live stream and you will over time."

"18557270","18558290"," I want to tell you guys something."
"18558890","18560450"," I love the half hour charts. "
"18560810","18561570"," I love the hour charts."
"18561930","18563810"," I love the four hour charts and the daily charts."
"18563810","18570970"," I like the hour chart because it usually shows trend for one to three days. "
"18571990","18573210"," Sometimes five days."
"18573770","18578830"," Four hour chart can show trend for five to 15 days."
"18579290","18579950"," Major trend. "
"18581070","18581850"," Daily charts."
"18582170","18587890"," Once you get above a four hour chart, you can start looking at trend for up to a month, believe"
"18587890","18588770"," it or not."
"18588770","18590830"," Even longer, one month to three months. "
"18591790","18599810"," You can look at a weekly chart as a chart that I'll show you the way for a quarter, half"
"18599810","18600490"," two quarters."
"18601710","18604430"," So, right now, let's take a look."
"18604550","18605430"," We're heading into the end of the day. "
"18605750","18608650"," Don't worry, I'm going to do NVDA for you in just a minute."
"18609710","18611330"," We're going to look at a one hour chart."
"18611870","18614930"," We're going to look at an SPX because this stuff is for day trading. "
"18615410","18618050"," So, don't mind me with that."
"18618830","18620130"," Let's take a look at this here."
"18620330","18621290"," This is SPX. "
"18623960","18628900"," We have a double bottom recovery going on here."
"18629760","18630700"," You see it?"
"18631960","18633220"," Do you see it?"
"18635860","18636760"," Pay attention."
"18637540","18639120"," Get on Twitter and tell your friends. "
"18643380","18645460"," Remember, what time is it right now?"
"18646320","18648480"," It's 2.50 in the afternoon, okay?"
"18648880","18650140"," Come back and watch this on your own."
"18650720","18652060"," Here's your weekend brief."
"18652640","18659260"," Here's the shit that someone's going to have to spend three hours thinking about to make a video"
"18659260","18660840"," for you on Sunday night. "
"18661960","18663460"," I'm going to do it for you right now."
"18663700","18664060"," Off the cuff."
"18664060","18666680"," Off the cuff. "
"18666680","18667460"," You ready for it?"
"18669040","18670180"," What do you got there?"
"18671380","18672620"," You know what that is?"
"18673280","18673980"," Higher low."
"18674720","18675500"," What is that?"
"18678420","18679740"," All right, hold on."
"18681460","18682600"," Okay, I shouldn't do that. "
"18684120","18688180"," That would make like FX evolution with like blush doing something like that."
"18692900","18695780"," We've got, they're going to claim it's window dressing, right?"
"18696100","18697660"," For the second quarter."
"18699440","18701900"," What do bulls need to do here?"
"18702300","18704500"," First of all, I want to tell you two things. "
"18705560","18706880"," Pay close attention here."
"18709220","18714600"," If there's a reversal here, it's going to be violent."
"18715540","18718240"," Okay, if there's a rejection up here, I'm serious. "
"18718240","18719580"," Pay close attention here."
"18721080","18730740"," If there is a failure at 4440, the down move on a double,"
"18731820","18735840"," on a double like this is not pretty."
"18737460","18740780"," You're going to be targeting 4200, okay?"
"18741180","18742020"," 4200. "
"18744660","18748460"," Now this is a reversal on the hourly in the making, isn't it?"
"18750960","18753880"," So if you get, this is a reversal in the making."
"18759750","18762130"," So what do bulls need here?"
"18764630","18774130"," Bulls need, they don't need the new high here from yesterday, but they do need to get above"
"18774130","18778410"," and retest hourly trend to the upside."
"18779930","18781470"," Take a snapshot of that if you want. "
"18782230","18791950"," It would be nice to get the new high, even if there's a pullback on 4460 and then the continuation"
"18791950","18799510"," to the upside to take out the gap at 4560."
"18804510","18807410"," There's the 14th and 19th of quarter."
"18809790","18816630"," 4720 is the top of the key on the JPM caller. "
"18819550","18820990"," Last chance, bulls."
"18823830","18827150"," If you're a bull, here's your last chance."
"18829170","18831670"," If you're a bull, do you see it?"
"18832850","18833390"," Tell me. "
"18834450","18835630"," You see it."
"18838400","18839820"," Tell me in the chat."
"18841800","18842840"," If you see it. "
"18852790","18854990"," Do you see it?"
"18856670","18858690"," JPM caller right there."
"18859850","18863090"," This is your last chance, bulls."
"18865850","18867710"," So draw this at home. "
"18868030","18871050"," A way to get SPX at home on your chart."
"18871050","18880460"," And I want you to think about"
"18880460","18883460"," drawing yourself something like this."
"18884340","18889180"," How does the bull thesis stay alive?"
"18891780","18893060"," Just like that. "
"18896720","18898180"," You get what I'm saying here?"
"18899380","18901480"," You need to trade above it."
"18902080","18903580"," I don't care if it's just by a tick."
"18904780","18912660"," You need to come back down, hold the 129 and have the cross on the 27, even if you consolidate"
"18912660","18913980"," and start heading higher. "
"18914340","18915040"," That's what you need."
"18918480","18920660"," Bulls in charge right now."
"18921560","18922280"," Price target. "
"18923400","18925380"," I can't believe I'm saying this."
"18926020","18927640"," Price target."
"18928780","18931080"," September 29th. "
"18932520","18934100"," 468266."
"18936400","18945860"," If the bulls fail in September, if they fail to make a new high"
"18945860","18950640"," at 445601, we're going to the depths of hell."
"18951380","18959380"," If the bulls fail to get a new high on 457617, we're going to the depths of hell. "
"18960460","18964760"," If you're a seller, you are trying to sell what?"
"18966360","18967660"," You already know right?"
"18968060","18969240"," You're trying to sell that right?"
"18969440","18973580"," That 446, well, excuse me, 440, 440."
"18975040","18976820"," Where's your next place to sell?"
"18977760","18982400"," Mid-September, 4560 you're trying to sell."
"18982720","18983120"," You see it?"
"18983700","18984220"," You're a seller. "
"18984840","18985660"," You're selling that."
"18985980","18986580"," You're a seller."
"18987080","18987960"," You're selling that. "
"18988300","18993600"," If you're a seller, when we get up there, you can, you can, you can suck it, okay?"
"18999720","19002660"," So sellers now know where they need to sell."
"19003580","19005420"," Where's spoons going right now?"
"19005720","19005900"," Up!"
"19010580","19012080"," So we're going to look at SPX."
"19012240","19013580"," We're going to look at SPY right now. "
"19013780","19014960"," Okay, we're going to go back to SPY."
"19017540","19019940"," We're going to go to a one-hour chart here, right?"
"19022380","19024720"," Now I'm going to show you what you need, okay?"
"19026200","19027640"," So here's SPY right here."
"19028220","19030620"," Do you see the bull cross coming here?"
"19034600","19036860"," Isn't a one-hour chart on SPOOS?"
"19038780","19040960"," You see that right there, right?"
"19041760","19044820"," What do you need into tomorrow, Monday?"
"19045120","19045500"," What do you need?"
"19046460","19048800"," What do you get on Monday, you want to know?"
"19053370","19055290"," What do you want if you're a bull?"
"19056190","19065570"," I already told you, gap this shit up into Monday, get a new high, come back down on Tuesday"
"19065570","19068670"," and start running it up. "
"19069990","19071450"," Do you understand me?"
"19072090","19074170"," That's what a bull needs right there."
"19074810","19076290"," I'll even take this."
"19077370","19078990"," I'll even take Monday. "
"19080510","19083970"," I'll take 441, but you better go up there by Tuesday."
"19085250","19088310"," Tuesday price target, 447-70."
"19092280","19095640"," Tuesday price target, 447-70. "
"19096260","19097980"," See this daily trigger right here?"
"19100340","19102340"," I'm going to show you the likely path."
"19112990","19114910"," Yeah, I'm going to show you the likely path."
"19117850","19120090"," Get out to no pads and pencils. "
"19120950","19127590"," Ready, up, up to the daily trigger by Monday."
"19128990","19130050"," That's 443."
"19131430","19132230"," Okay?"
"19133050","19138030"," By Tuesday, we got to hold 442. "
"19138870","19142690"," By Friday, I want, I want, I want asses."
"19144510","19146330"," By Friday, I want 448."
"19148730","19150670"," I want bare ass. "
"19151830","19154050"," I want all the bare ass."
"19156770","19158030"," You need to do that."
"19158210","19161930"," I think you do it before, but I'm just telling you, you need that. "
"19162110","19163030"," Why do you need that?"
"19165430","19173230"," Because if you come back down over here and you watch that white line right there, you come back in"
"19173230","19176450"," the next Monday and you ride even higher."
"19177030","19184030"," Do you see what I'm saying here?"
"19184030","19184410"," This fails."
"19186410","19191610"," If at any point we start going down off the daily trigger, we're going down. "
"19192350","19193290"," We're going to trade 420."
"19194170","19194930"," You fail here."
"19195550","19196990"," We're going down to 420. "
"19198050","19199050"," We fail up here."
"19199530","19200610"," We're going down to 420."
"19202610","19204650"," I still believe, bulls. "
"19206150","19207510"," I still believe."
"19208030","19211750"," I might be one of the last ones out there that still believes with you."
"19214310","19215970"," Grinding higher right now. "
"19218270","19219950"," I still believe with you, bulls."
"19220310","19223150"," I believe because the macro picture is telling me to believe."
"19225190","19231850"," It's telling me to believe in that they're going to sell 480 in the, in December 31st, they're"
"19231850","19232550"," going to sell 480. "
"19234410","19236190"," I still believe with you."
"19236310","19242690"," If you're a bull watching me, I still believe."
"19251270","19251750"," NVDA. "
"19253030","19254370"," We ain't done here."
"19257990","19260210"," I'll be the only one out there telling you."
"19260270","19263310"," I'm the only, I'm probably like one of like out of every 10 people out there. "
"19264150","19264790"," I believe."
"19269970","19273010"," That doesn't mean you put $5 million in that belief though."
"19273190","19273750"," I want to warn you that. "
"19275970","19278370"," Don't be like a full port of the million dollars cap."
"19281350","19286250"," Now we got to talk here about NVDA."
"19289650","19291730"," Oh, this is NVDA, okay. "
"19293430","19295470"," We hit the upside implied move."
"19296390","19297490"," Yahoo, we did it."
"19298470","19301390"," We got pretty close to this downside move. "
"19302470","19312290"," If it was me, if I was a NVDA bull, the dip was bought on the daily"
"19312290","19313370"," trigger here, okay."
"19314870","19318710"," This is saying long, long, long, long."
"19319870","19320550"," Okay. "
"19324730","19330210"," I want you to know that you need to get above 469-32."
"19331370","19336050"," If at any moment, there's a roll down next week on some weakness."
"19338110","19347430"," It's likely to print that the August 25th puts the second week just for the algorithms, then it"
"19347430","19347850"," will rip. "
"19349930","19352710"," Now if you're like, fuck that cap, we're never coming back again."
"19353170","19353910"," I believe you too."
"19354830","19363110"," So trade is still alive to the upside for bulls at NVDA above 464-46-60. "
"19363730","19367130"," I get really bullish above 471-29."
"19367890","19369570"," And what is the price targets?"
"19370290","19371570"," I told you this during their earnings."
"19372950","19376490"," I said they ain't printing that big bad boy up there in the sky, didn't I?"
"19377030","19380530"," I said it was 465, excuse me, 562. "
"19381230","19381950"," It's not on this chart."
"19382050","19382750"," It's not a different one."
"19383730","19385750"," It's on this chart over here. "
"19388330","19391770"," I didn't do it on that chart, but I did do it on this chart."
"19395490","19396270"," Pull on it."
"19396330","19397030"," I'll switch back over. "
"19398990","19401090"," You got your implied move over here?"
"19402230","19403270"," Vohawa, baby."
"19405470","19411530"," As long as that price holds, we are going to 554-81 right there."
"19411690","19412090"," That's your target. "
"19413690","19415050"," 554-81."
"19416870","19418850"," I know you don't want to hear that, bears."
"19420950","19422150"," That's your target. "
"19423410","19426950"," 554-81 right there."
"19429310","19430330"," You got me?"
"19432630","19434030"," None of this bullshit."
"19434390","19435010"," You do any of that?"
"19435670","19436750"," Market starts going down?"
"19437490","19438770"," You need to pull the plug. "
"19449520","19458330"," The target hit to the upside, right?"
"19459110","19460530"," Target, target hit."
"19461230","19462710"," What are we looking for now?"
"19463990","19466290"," We're going to raise up our bar again, aren't we?"
"19476050","19478330"," Just smashing and bashing now, right?"
"19483940","19489080"," Now, if you don't understand what I'm talking about to you right now, the past 15 minutes I spent"
"19489080","19492040"," telling you what's going to happen, you don't have to."
"19492580","19498260"," I want you to go back, get a piece of paper to pen over the weekend, and write down what"
"19498260","19498840"," I was saying. "
"19499700","19501180"," Be like, I know where I can buy dips."
"19501420","19502640"," I know where not to buy dips."
"19503220","19505200"," I know where to sell on the way up over there. "
"19505980","19507060"," I know where to take the money."
"19509000","19515160"," I know if I get closing bars on an hourly bar below to cut myself loose."
"19516520","19522140"," I know that if we break trend that we're going to head down to $4.20 and $4.00, you"
"19522140","19526820"," know, bulls have no time here, no fucking time. "
"19527740","19528960"," They've got to get it done."
"19533060","19535060"," Trading $4.41 right now."
"19537120","19538580"," What happened to market crash?"
"19549420","19550880"," Yes, exactly, Joe. "
"19552660","19554560"," Joe, there's a little bit more into this bell."
"19554900","19560820"," We got a little bit more on a HYG has 7478 in the bell."
"19560900","19561740"," Hopefully it gets it. "
"19562000","19563860"," Apple didn't do the downside yesterday."
"19564460","19567580"," Apple didn't fill that final fucking downside gap."
"19568280","19571540"," So you might be right that we might not do the creepy crawly up the wall today. "
"19575460","19576820"," We watched it over the weekend."
"19577440","19583740"," You can apply all that stuff from SPX on every ticker, not every 99% of the tickers in the"
"19583740","19584380"," stock market."
"19585020","19590480"," That, that, what I tell you in SPX is going to hold true to the entire majority of the stock"
"19590480","19590840"," market. "
"19596960","19599680"," I'm telling you, that's the best, best case for you."
"19600000","19605740"," Now, saying all that, you guys are likely going to hear all over the place."
"19605740","19607260"," This is just a short squeeze. "
"19608920","19609980"," The bull run is done."
"19610980","19614740"," You're going to hear JPM say, we're done."
"19615000","19615540"," We're going down. "
"19616840","19617460"," You're going to hear JP."
"19617740","19619180"," You're going to hear everybody out there say that shit."
"19621100","19622360"," That's all they're going to tell you. "
"19623680","19629180"," My thesis here has a lot to do with what, what Jerome wants, what the Fed wants."
"19630240","19632380"," I think they do sell this market."
"19632820","19635160"," I think they do cut rates next year. "
"19635520","19637360"," I think the damage is done."
"19638380","19643900"," I think that, I think that we're going to roll down hard and heavy, but where we roll down matters,"
"19645960","19654360"," if you think we're rolling from here down, I mean, I'm just, I'm trying to listen to, I'm trying to"
"19654360","19660360"," listen to a seller's thesis and I think they're out of their fucking minds."
"19661800","19663420"," I'm going to tell you why, okay?"
"19664400","19665720"," They're out of their fucking minds. "
"19666060","19666760"," I'm going to tell you why."
"19667540","19674560"," These fucking guys think that you're going to crash down to fucking 3500 and then the Fed is going"
"19674560","19677140"," to, what, what did you tell me?"
"19677240","19679080"," They're going to go to 3500 in the fall."
"19680240","19683060"," What, then the Fed's going to cut rates in the fall?"
"19685140","19686560"," Ask a seller right now. "
"19687320","19688820"," How you tell me, you ask a seller."
"19689600","19690880"," Are they going to cut rates in the fall?"
"19692900","19693740"," You know what they're going to tell you?"
"19694120","19694160"," No."
"19695400","19698920"," So you're telling me the Fed wants our market at 2,600?"
"19699840","19700820"," Get fucked. "
"19706020","19711640"," I think they want the market to go down, but I think they want it to go down from like"
"19711640","19719460"," 4,800, maybe 4,720, but they want it to go down from there so there's a buffer."
"19720500","19729800"," Their intent is not to make the give or take 100 points."
"19730420","19735400"," They still want that fat ass, you know, 1,100, 1,200 buffer. "
"19736460","19740780"," So when we do get the crash, it's going to seem like it's bad."
"19742180","19744660"," They're not intentionally going to crash it."
"19745420","19754520"," Now if it does go below 3500, it goes to 28, 32, or even if it does actually crash down"
"19754520","19755760"," to 16 or 2,600. "
"19756160","19757680"," That was not their intent."
"19760940","19770380"," They think they're the smartest guys in the room, but I assure you that 4,56 is not the spot."
"19771160","19772160"," That's not it. "
"19772840","19774000"," It's a couple hundred points higher."
"19778520","19780120"," It's a couple hundred points higher."
"19783280","19784920"," And you're going to look back. "
"19785580","19787180"," I'm going to give you another warning."
"19791160","19793260"," You're going to look back here in five years."
"19794200","19795800"," You're going to look back here in 10 years. "
"19796080","19797620"," I gave this warning last year."
"19798480","19801500"," I gave this warning on this stream."
"19801740","19803640"," I was the only person telling you this. "
"19804680","19806880"," You buy that 3500."
"19807000","19808640"," You buy that 3600."
"19809180","19815040"," You'll look back in one to three years and have said oh thankfully I bought that bottom. "
"19815820","19822280"," And I'm going to tell you again that when we get into next year, you're going to buy that bottom"
"19822280","19822720"," two."
"19823780","19832170"," Within five years, you're going to look back and you're going to say, thankfully I bought those"
"19832170","19832770"," bottoms."
"19833870","19836670"," You're going to hear a seller tell you in five years. "
"19837210","19842290"," You can hear the sellers right now saying I didn't buy the October lows."
"19842530","19843850"," I didn't buy the main June lows."
"19844110","19846990"," I didn't buy the August lows because we're going back there. "
"19848850","19851350"," I'll have a second chance to buy it."
"19852090","19859570"," And I told you back last year I told you that we may not ever go back there."
"19860770","19867170"," You have a better chance to have bought that bottom and have a second chance to buy it than to"
"19867170","19871930"," take the opposite side and say I'll wait for it to come back. "
"19872110","19874810"," And I'm going to tell you why because historically we don't."
"19875810","19876930"," About 30% of the time we don't."
"19880830","19886750"," And then in 10 years, they're still going to be out there telling you shit like I'm selling this. "
"19887970","19888770"," Claps Bear."
"19889910","19890850"," 15 years."
"19894190","19897790"," And I don't know how you are, but I love making money. "
"19898590","19899510"," And I used to be a bear."
"19900370","19904110"," If you're a seller on intraday and a weeklies, monthlies, I'm fine with that."
"19904750","19911990"," But if you're if"
"19911990","19919530"," you're drinking the I'm not talking about like a seller in today or a seller on Twin Peaks or"
"19919530","19921550"," fucking whatever it is you're doing. "
"19921810","19926930"," I'm talking about those collapsed people out there talking about the shit that you consume on"
"19926930","19931190"," social media and the news CNBC print media."
"19932310","19933390"," That is all bullshit."
"19933710","19938750"," All those people are doing is trying to fucking give you a movie to watch. "
"19940570","19942630"," They're they're out of their fucking minds."
"19947550","19949210"," Is that mean it can't happen?"
"19949690","19952250"," No, but you got to live your life."
"19952870","19954130"," You got to put risk on. "
"19956090","19957450"," That's what we're doing here."
"19957830","19965210"," If you're not here for that, then go back and get a fucking job and work your 40 hour week"
"19965210","19965570"," job."
"19965850","19970650"," Put your money in a money market account or a savings account and get the fuck out of here. "
"19971970","19974110"," As the rest of us are looking to put risk on."
"19976610","19979470"," And so when you see those major lows, you're buying them."
"19981030","19982070"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"19982870","19988790"," When we were back there last October, that morning of 12th, that was the only man in the room. "
"19990090","19991850"," I had some people watching, but not many."
"19992610","19994430"," We're not many people standing around."
"19998010","19999830"," When you go out there, you ask James Roland. "
"20000070","20000910"," He's a friend of mine."
"20001030","20001610"," You ask him."
"20003970","20006390"," It's a very lonely place down there. "
"20007110","20012950"," So when it happens again next year, I'll probably be be there with just a few of you."
"20017030","20018590"," But that's why we're here."
"20025590","20026790"," Yeah, we can crash. "
"20027350","20033450"," I'm not saying we can't go down at 26 or 16 saying to you that when it does happen like"
"20033450","20037230"," that, it's because we broke something, something that they're abusing."
"20038210","20039730"," It's not something that they intended."
"20041310","20047210"," All banks want is to trade sideways because the banks had their way we would trade sideways. "
"20048350","20049570"," We'd have a low they can buy."
"20049730","20052070"," We got a top they can sell like regular."
"20052990","20058050"," They can sell it to their clients every once in a while, they get run over to the upside. "
"20058230","20059790"," Every once in a while, they get run over to the downside."
"20061850","20071630"," But if that's still going on, we're likely going to make that 472, 465, 485 or 480 somewhere in"
"20071630","20071830"," there."
"20071830","20072850"," We're likely going to make it. "
"20073290","20078590"," And they're likely going to send it down so they can buy another dip."
"20080990","20085610"," You know, they're trying to sell and buy within like a ballpark range."
"20086290","20089690"," And meanwhile, you're reading shit out there that's just batshit and crazy. "
"20097130","20098370"," Manage risk, absolutely."
"20098990","20099730"," Don't avoid it."
"20099930","20100450"," Manage it. "
"20105970","20108070"," So you've got my take on next week."
"20109570","20113290"," You have until, and I'm going to warn you this too, if you're a bull, I'm going to warn you"
"20113290","20117950"," something like that 420 is a magnet, but it also repels."
"20122430","20126290"," And I'll tell you, man, what you don't want to do, right?"
"20126490","20132950"," Like the worst thing that could happen is we trade sideways for the for the third month of the"
"20132950","20133750"," third quarter. "
"20134910","20140230"," If we if we sideways trade this shit for the next month, it's going to suck."
"20143270","20145070"," We sideways trade this stuff."
"20145230","20146530"," We're going down big time. "
"20147210","20151970"," If you're a bull out there, that's shit that I showed you earlier, you better stay on that track."
"20153410","20155470"," If we don't stay on that track, right?"
"20156130","20157630"," Get your bear suits out."
"20157750","20161370"," Your real bear suits, not these like fucking intraday weekly bullshit. "
"20161970","20168990"," I mean, bear suits, like unzip that bull suit and we're going to go down big."
"20169250","20171970"," So you'll have that on your plate too."
"20171970","20178650"," If you're a bull, you have to be able to identify when the real role comes. "
"20186390","20189390"," Do you have to be able to identify that and accept it?"
"20190150","20194630"," Because when it does come, I don't want to have you guys in stream telling me cap where we going"
"20194630","20195350"," back up again."
"20196190","20199070"," But when that happens, we go down."
"20211360","20212340"," I love you guys too. "
"20212400","20213220"," I love all of you out there."
"20214260","20216000"," I love I love all you guys more than you know."
"20216240","20217680"," You don't you don't know how much I love you. "
"20217900","20219300"," You really don't really don't know."
"20220520","20221300"," Truly don't know."
"20221800","20226360"," I used to frustrate me like it was the most frustrating thing in my entire life to see that shit"
"20226360","20227220"," all day long every day. "
"20229200","20232560"," So I hope you all the great weekend."
"20236140","20239120"," Hopefully, we'll get to that 423 by Wednesday."
"20239520","20241200"," I think it's Monday for the close today. "
"20244660","20246440"," I'm trying to give you some room to get up there."
"20247140","20247980"," I always like that."
"20248140","20253040"," It's going to happen between now and four p.m. You're on zero dates and it doesn't happen until"
"20253040","20253280"," Wednesday. "
"20256160","20259140"," So please rewatch the rest of that video that I just did for you."
"20259260","20259340"," Okay."
"20260000","20261840"," And stop fucking drinking the coolant. "
"20261840","20263040"," I don't care if you're a bear a bull."
"20263360","20264960"," Don't drink that goddamn Kool-Aid."
"20265040","20266440"," Don't drink that bull in bear Kool-Aid. "
"20266540","20267280"," Just stay away from it."
"20268140","20268900"," We'll run high."
"20269240","20269720"," Stay away from it. "
"20269840","20270080"," We're low."
"20270500","20271100"," Stay away from it."
"20274780","20276780"," I got one more thing for you before you go. "
"20287130","20288210"," Stay with me here."
"20289390","20298730"," I got something for you."
"20299450","20301430"," And I gave you those important levels, right?"
"20305950","20309930"," And I said, you must do this and you must do that, right?"
"20310090","20311510"," I'm not joking around on that stuff. "
"20315950","20318470"," So I'm going to bring you over here for a minute."
"20323050","20326090"," And I want you to bring your attention to two things."
"20326310","20328130"," This is PPO and PMO right here. "
"20328750","20331390"," And I want you to see that there's an attempt here."
"20333790","20337590"," There's an attempt going on to cross over and cross higher, okay?"
"20339370","20341430"," What's going on right now, okay?"
"20341670","20342810"," We're on the zero line right here."
"20342910","20343970"," This is PPO, PMO. "
"20345190","20346810"," Same thing down here."
"20347310","20348570"," We're getting the cross down below."
"20351750","20353690"," Let's see that cross coming in right here. "
"20357920","20359220"," You don't, I'm not joking here."
"20359260","20360080"," You don't have a choice."
"20363640","20367700"," Okay, so I want you to see that this is your time to shine if you're a bull, okay?"
"20368600","20370360"," It's your time to shine right here. "
"20372080","20373120"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"20374040","20378360"," You don't have any more time left if you're a bull."
"20379240","20382400"," And when I said we can't sell those things, do you know why?"
"20383820","20385400"," I'm going to show you right now why."
"20385400","20391520"," Like you don't have a choice if you're a bull because if you come up here and you just reject"
"20391520","20392920"," down, it's going to get ugly. "
"20393200","20395360"," When I said, hey, if we start rejecting, it's going to get ugly."
"20396080","20396660"," I'm serious."
"20397160","20398480"," Just fit like this will happen. "
"20400460","20401960"," Just fit like that'll happen."
"20403740","20407820"," So pretend we're right here right now and you fail that recovery."
"20408400","20410960"," It's going to blast down to four thousand. "
"20411820","20415800"," So if you're trying to recover right here and you fail that, it's going way down."
"20415980","20416580"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"20420860","20424880"," So really, really, really careful in here."
"20425440","20426080"," Here's what I'm saying. "
"20426280","20426880"," See it right there?"
"20427560","20428020"," Same shit."
"20429820","20439920"," Okay, so bulls on notice overbought down or oversold down here too, right?"
"20440180","20441500"," Bulls have this in their favor."
"20442440","20443980"," We're not up here right now. "
"20444740","20447360"," So bulls do have this in their favor to get them going."
"20447560","20450900"," There's some, there's some, you know, some grieve to the upside."
"20452680","20459980"," As this goes up, as market breath indicator goes up, I want you, if you're a bull, I want you"
"20459980","20461300"," to pay attention to price. "
"20463640","20472640"," If you're a bull, I want you to watch this market breath indicator as it goes up and price better"
"20472640","20473540"," be going with it."
"20474180","20474760"," You know what I'm saying?"
"20476000","20477540"," We don't need to go up here."
"20478260","20479840"," We just need to go like right there. "
"20484040","20487000"," Okay, that's December 31st."
"20487740","20489160"," There's 4800."
"20489520","20490220"," You see it?"
"20492160","20499140"," So there's your midfall doom and gloom, even if it comes down and goes up there. "
"20500820","20503420"," Get that big down, that big up right there."
"20503540","20504080"," You get what I'm saying?"
"20507460","20510540"," The blast down in the first of January over here."
"20511400","20512800"," You guys understand what I'm coming from?"
"20514580","20519200"," You want to make sure price is following market breath up and down. "
"20519200","20526330"," Okay, we still got time, bulls."
"20527570","20529110"," You still got time."
"20531730","20533830"," You still got time. "
"20542990","20544030"," Energy sector."
"20544390","20545450"," I'm on it right now, dude."
"20545610","20546770"," I'm still long fucking energy. "
"20547070","20547930"," I'm long USO."
"20548930","20549810"," I'm long USO."
"20549930","20550310"," That's my take. "
"20551650","20552950"," I'm only long to 75."
"20553870","20556030"," I might even have to check it this week."
"20556270","20557170"," I checked it this morning. "
"20557690","20558250"," I didn't sell."
"20558410","20558890"," I stayed in."
"20559110","20565410"," So I don't know if I'm on the 100 bucks a barrel coming into end of year. "
"20565510","20566010"," It's possible."
"20566670","20568310"," There's like there's two things here."
"20568450","20570750"," You already know that energy is going to go wild, right?"
"20573970","20579330"," So if you were going to do like if you're bullish on energy, you've got an opportunity for it to"
"20579330","20582470"," hit highs in fall, like October. "
"20583830","20587410"," And you have another chance likely in November and then February."
"20588070","20591030"," So I'd put some time on those calls."
"20591450","20595270"," If you're going to be going along it, your expectations need to be pushed out. "
"20596070","20602750"," One thing about energy is you see it squeeze up, you buy it, then it goes, squeeze it back down,"

"21354560","21362540"," This is my expectation on A.M.D., okay, you're gonna be trying to buy price"
"21370640","21380830"," target A.M.D. 160.96, that sounds"
"21380830","21390170"," crazy, for December 31st, that's my price target 160, you guys ready"
"21390170","21397790"," 160, 164, I will say this to you, your best bet, well,"
"21398110","21410690"," I'd be trying to buy, believe it or not, 93, 34, but saying that, if"
"21410690","21419230"," price gets above here, you'd be safe above, you'd"
"21419230","21427440"," be safe with that trade and that trade is alive"
"21427440","21437460"," above 110, as long as, as"
"21437460","21445040"," long if, if price begins to go up right now and comes down and tests, so let's try a 102,"
"21445860","21457120"," I'd be, I'd be a buyer at 102, 110, 102, 29, buyer at 91, 96, and"
"21457120","21467100"," definitely bullish above 108, 77, 110, price target for December 31st on A.M.D."
"21467740","21471840"," 168, I don't know what would make it do that, but that's my price target. "
"21474580","21482160"," December 31st, 162, 21, there you go."
"21492040","21492820"," What is it at?"
"21493020","21502300"," It's a 9208, 102, 25, 108, and the last thing I would say would be this, now into"
"21502300","21512160"," September, right here, right here, right"
"21512160","21514780"," here, right here, and right"
"21514780","21529840"," here."
"21529840","21536920"," This is be very careful because if the bulls fail on the market, you're downside target, you're"
"21536920","21537440"," ready for it?"
"21540420","21545620"," Your downside target is $32 into springtime. "
"21548000","21554460"," I shouldn't say that low, your springtime target, if we fail, the market fails, your springtime"
"21554460","21563960"," target is $4,504, so $4,504 springtime target way down there, it'll take like,"
"21564320","21568460"," take till February, right there."
"21574540","21582060"," So there it is right there, springtime target, if you fail this week, next week, September fails,"
"21582660","21592620"," even if we do this bullshit the whole way down, you're looking for 40 bucks in February, 40 bucks"
"21592620","21602260"," in February, so you don't want any big, big giant down days down here underneath like 98, 80 bucks,"
"21603160","21605220"," you'll cut that ticker in half."
"21610620","21612400"," So there's AMD, did it for you. "
"21613920","21620760"," I am bullish on AMD, I'm, the bull pieces is alive, it's not dead yet, they can be dead, but"

"21675040","21687340"," orange line right there, I don't see it going down there, I see trend intact, uh, give"

"21693060","21701060"," four right in there, I see that up there, maybe not that high, like 72, and then I see the"
"21701060","21708740"," 480 up there, and then I see December 31st, blood, and when I see that blood up there, that's what"
"21708740","21715180"," I'm looking for, so just right here, I'm looking for, is that up there, and then I'm looking for"
"21715180","21724760"," something nasty comes this way, see March down here in February, and then maybe April,"
"21725080","21737140"," and right now, where's the dip by, 400, 4200, 410, if"
"21737140","21747140"," you want real death and destruction, uh, it's probably a 360 right here, give a real target"
"21747140","21761240"," for springtime 360 right there, now"
"21761240","21770620"," there's your soft landing, damn right there, we're right up here at that point, off and running,"
"21771080","21781520"," that's what I'm seeing, right above 350, 360, 350, you"
"21781520","21786820"," got to, you got to hire low, get the double bottom, and we're off and running in 2025, 2026, now"
"21786820","21796660"," if we break below that, 3600, your target down below that is going to be 3,000"
"21796660","21805960"," exactly, you got another target down here that'll likely be 2,800, no excuse me 2,300, scratch that"
"21805960","21813100"," 2,300, that's the worst do my see, 23, let me see, 1, 2, 3, 4, I'll give it to"

"21837820","21847020"," actually 2008, so if you had a 2008 crash, if you're a seller, 2,600, worst case scenario, 26,"
