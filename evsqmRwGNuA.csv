"136560","137440"," Good morning."
"142210","143690"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"151020","157760"," Yes, live stream, baby."
"161410","163010"," Are y'all doing out there this morning?"
"175290","176570"," Good morning. "
"177530","185090"," A little bit of resistance here this morning on the opening bell here, but not too much to worry"
"185090","185390"," about."
"187610","188930"," There's some work to do."
"194020","195800"," We have a lot to go over this morning. "
"197880","198860"," Good morning, everybody."
"199140","199800"," How's everybody doing?"
"202560","209520"," Yeah, I was thinking about the yesterday during yesterday's stream revisiting all these regional"
"209520","211820"," bank stocks and some of their snapback numbers."
"211820","217600"," So we kept harping on it all day long, harping on it all day long, harping on it all day"
"217600","217860"," long. "
"218600","221640"," We focused on it all day long."
"222360","224260"," Talk about Schwab all day long."
"224540","227260"," Talk with FRC and WAL all day long. "
"228080","233680"," Even briefly talked about credit Swiss, I believe, all day long."
"234040","239720"," And then, of course, watching the market go nowhere yesterday as well."
"240520","245500"," And then, uh, Wiggy was talking to me all day long about these things, too, right in the"
"245500","246260"," background, getting texts. "
"247120","248080"," And I'm not able to look."
"248180","250140"," And then, of course, after the close yesterday, I'm like, you know what?"
"251040","252180"," He is fucking right."
"252440","253760"," And now I'm not livestreaming. "
"253780","254800"," So with the time to pay attention."
"255600","264400"," Um, uh, I'm quite happy at this point this morning."
"265640","268120"," Um, Now. "
"269780","271720"," Good morning to all of you that are out there right now."
"271760","272600"," Let me go through real quick."
"272860","275180"," Uh, Mr. Majin. "
"275460","276640"," Mad two, four, eight."
"277240","277640"," Lehan."
"278000","278400"," Fisted. "
"279000","279300"," Wiggy."
"279420","279840"," What up."
"280580","280940"," Brother. "
"283100","283900"," DB Sigma."
"284320","284560"," Nido."
"286120","286520"," Manvera. "
"286800","290940"," You guys should have had time to buy all this stuff yesterday either in the morning, afternoon,"
"291400","291840"," after the close."
"292160","293300"," I don't know what else to say at this point."
"294840","297060"," We talked about them all fucking day yesterday. "
"297280","297460"," So."
"298920","302860"," Uh, into the crazy part is the thumbnail for this video."
"304240","306160"," I was reading Reddit last night. "
"307200","310480"," I got on Reddit last night and I was like, you know what?"
"313580","320240"," I was like, I was a part of the occupy Wall Street, uh, movement for the first occupy."
"320640","322060"," There's two two occupied movements."
"322260","322720"," The first one. "
"322720","330100"," And then there was a, um, I think like a bigger one that was like occupy everything or some shit"
"330100","330440"," like that."
"330600","331100"," The real one."
"332060","339540"," Uh, We'll talk about that at some point this morning, but the fascinating thing was reading Reddit"
"339540","342900"," last night and people were like, I was reading like leopards date your face. "
"345500","351760"," And leopards that your face was like, was like, yeah, make the investors whole, but fuck over it."
"351980","352740"," F those banks."
"355040","360020"," And I was looking at the closing bars yesterday on, on regional banks and I was like. "
"363340","366120"," Someone bought 68 million shares."
"369560","372700"," It wasn't a Billy Bob on Main Street."
"374320","383040"," It reminded me of the original occupy Wall Street movement when, uh, Executives were, and I know"
"383040","385800"," that that's like the context of this picture is not accurate. "
"386780","391120"," I know the true history of it or whatever, but the idea that."
"392380","396660"," Well, the banks are taking one of the chin and the reality is."
"398640","403260"," No, they're fucking buying it when it's dirt cheap and they're going to make a market for it. "
"407800","409400"," They'll make a market out of anything."
"410420","412900"," And, uh, you know, that's the fascinating part."
"413040","414980"," I don't know if we're getting, if we're getting dumber. "
"415640","419040"," Or if like social media is making us dumber."
"420440","423200"," Uh, but I hope that we don't get dumber."
"423680","425180"," They're going to keep it that simple. "
"425300","426220"," It's like adiocracy."
"429670","431570"," And there's a part of that."
"431850","435790"," That's like, there's an altruism to that where you're like, yeah, stick it to the man. "
"436190","441350"," But you're, you're being fed on social media that you're sticking it to the man or the man's"
"441350","442310"," getting it stuck to them."
"443090","448410"," And the reality is for you to stick it to the man, you got to take it out of their"
"448410","449290"," pocket from them."
"450830","456290"," Man, I apologize, but dark Brandon and politics and all this other shit. "
"456290","457430"," They don't care about you either."
"459030","460630"," So if you want to stick it to the man."
"464130","469530"," Uh, you go into the, the, the free market system and you take it from the man. "
"470870","472830"," Or at least that's a legal way to do it."
"472950","476550"," I guess there's other illegal ways to do it or, you know, there's shit that people do out there"
"476550","476930"," that's."
"477750","482170"," Um, you know, I'm not going to mention those things, but. "
"482170","485630"," If you want to wait as, if you want to wait a stick it to the man."
"487310","490570"," In your own way that's actually something that benefits you."
"491370","494610"," Just go in there and buy with them and then take a little bit from them. "
"498580","501560"," You know, it's fascinating too, is that that occupy Wall Street movement."
"502860","506540"," There was a lot of anger at a burning man that first year when it happened."
"508340","511400"," And a lot of those guys are now VC bros. "
"511400","517480"," Uh, they're now, um, they're now part of that libertarian until I need a bell out bro."
"517480","519280"," Since February 24."
"520240","521260"," Those guys were. "
"521980","523360"," At burning man then."
"525320","528500"," And you know, they turn into just like what boomers turn into, right?"
"529400","532740"," You talk about that sometime too, like who were actually hippies."
"532940","535120"," The actual percentage of hippies in the 60s. "
"535440","538120"," And then you see like the same kind of a thing happening with a."
"540440","545360"," Burning man, matter of fact, uh, there's now two classes of people at burning men."
"545880","548720"," Uh, people that made money and people that did not."
"549520","551680"," And any longtime burners will know that. "
"551960","554360"," Uh, there's, there's two different types now at burning men, right?"
"555200","557000"," And there's like a split within the community."
"557360","558980"," We'll almost drop my water again."
"559820","562660"," A kid, you know, I almost just, I was just not going to water. "
"562800","564760"," I'm like waving my hands like I'm from Brooklyn or something."
"564760","567760"," I'm from so bro, baby."
"569560","570940"," So, you know, it's kind of weird. "
"571540","575880"," Uh, you don't really have many actual outlets out there."
"578290","581690"," On how to, uh, make money in this world, right?"
"582250","585030"," It was one of the most fascinating things I ever learned was."
"586090","588970"," Uh, one of the most fascinating things I ever learned was. "
"591190","594930"," You think you make a lot of money in your profession and then you find out about."
"596570","599230"," You find out about, uh, the stock market and you're like."
"600690","604790"," You can't believe that I thought, I thought I was asking for a lot and you find out that, you"
"604790","606810"," know, what you're asking for was never that much at all. "
"607630","611150"," Um, you start making money in the stock in the bank market."
"611950","613250"," Uh, you find out that."
"614150","617470"," Any contract you negotiated anything, anything at all. "
"618670","619410"," That, um."
"620770","622270"," They had more money than you'll ever have, right?"
"622850","626430"," Keep with money, the actual money, real money, the F you kind of money."
"628350","632510"," Now we're trading right now above, uh, we're in a cluster right now, right?"
"632770","634670"," We're in three trigger cluster, which is very powerful. "
"634710","635550"," That's a good thing."
"637710","642750"," Um, gonna let this breathe for a minute here."
"643170","647330"," We have the, I'll bring this over for you so you can take a look at it. "
"649250","651070"," We got a bunch to talk about today."
"651170","652450"," We got so much to talk about."
"652470","653190"," It's not even funny. "
"653190","656150"," Uh, any long time listener."
"657230","660250"," We have a ton to talk about, especially if you've been here since the beginning."
"660710","661670"," Now we've got a cluster here. "
"661710","661850"," Okay."
"661930","662610"," It's the three trigger cluster."
"662930","664790"," We broke through and above the hourly trigger. "
"664850","668550"," Finally, uh, the five minute is catching up to the one minute right now."
"669030","671970"," And there's some key places for you to look jump on the train if you can."
"672590","674490"," Uh, we've got, uh, three. "
"676810","678190"," Three, eight, eighty five."
"680150","684630"," We have three, eighty nine, sixteen, and we have three, ninety, fifty eight."
"685310","686950"," Now price targets above. "
"688010","692810"," Uh, we've got some volatility up here at, uh, three, ninety five, sixty."
"694710","695550"," Three ninety six, nineteen."
"696390","699650"," And where the real sellers are at three ninety eight, fifteen. "
"702450","706450"," Uh, we, we, we should get up there at some point today."
"706450","709590"," So whether you want to put on a call spread or you want to wait for a pullback or you"
"709590","710830"," want to throw some zero dates on."
"711750","713690"," Uh, as one of those trend days is today. "
"715990","718710"," So what does that mean for you in this market today?"
"720170","721830"," We're on the one minute chart right now."
"722170","724370"," We're going to take a look at them and draw some boxes for you."
"729160","730600"," So you can see some places. "
"733500","735280"," Three ninety sixty seven."
"735760","738960"," I don't know what, this morning I'm having some."
"740700","741680"," As a by John. "
"741940","743440"," Seven, some problems here."
"744920","746980"," Three ninety sixty seven."
"749740","750220"," Right. "
"751840","752920"," There's the first box."
"753220","754760"," We have some weirdness going on."
"754900","758560"," We're just going to get three ninety sixty seven here. "
"760320","765020"," The next one is, uh, three eighty nine thirty five, three nine thirty five."
"765100","767040"," And I don't think, I don't even think we wait a wait around for this."
"769300","770160"," But we might. "
"775110","776730"," Three eighty nine thirty five."
"779600","781840"," Having some real weird shit going on this morning."
"781840","784320"," So right here, indicators. "
"786120","786840"," Yeah, man."
"787280","787840"," Yeah, there we go."
"787980","788180"," Perfect. "
"793370","794650"," Three eighty eighty."
"799920","801120"," Way down here."
"807110","808110"," Here's our one. "
"813290","814610"," Three nine thirty three."
"815110","816150"," It's actually higher."
"828550","831010"," The EMA's are not three nine thirty three. "
"831150","832150"," Yeah, three nine thirty three."
"835310","837730"," We're going to adjust the EMA's this morning."
"848740","849600"," Ninety six. "
"849820","854180"," We're going to bring that up to, uh, believe where we bring that to today."
"856880","857920"," One twenty nine."
"859480","860800"," Sounds perfect to me. "
"861100","861560"," One twenty nine."
"863400","866300"," And we're going to probably just keep it continue to blast off here."
"866760","867980"," Got some price targets above. "
"868220","871460"," We've got a one, two, three PT's above here."
"872180","879990"," Kind of data just put on some zero dates and let them run."
"885690","886650"," PT two. "
"890490","891330"," Right there."
"892950","893890"," PT three."
"894290","895870"," We'll move these over as the day moves on. "
"904340","904680"," Save."
"907240","909000"," We got our two above right here."
"910160","912580"," Now starting to squeeze three ninety one eighty eight. "
"927870","929050"," Three eighty one ninety nine."
"938260","939740"," Nice beautiful trend day."
"962820","963960"," Here's the second here. "
"973060","976640"," Okay, so we're going to talk about another quick conversation while we're here right now."
"977820","979140"," Okay, so number one."
"981300","982820"," Let me come in here real quick. "
"983420","984920"," Is Jennifer trades in here?"
"985840","986860"," There she is right there."
"987540","988180"," Hey, Jennifer trades."
"988380","989320"," What's your Twitter handle?"
"993260","994160"," Are you here right now?"
"1000670","1002610"," Is Jennifer trades in here right now or no?"
"1004670","1011720"," I don't know if she's in here or not. "
"1014240","1016240"," If she's in here, can you ask her for a Twitter handle?"
"1029790","1030790"," Does she have it or no?"
"1045480","1046700"," Is she in here?"
"1047020","1048320"," Does anybody know her Twitter handle?"
"1048540","1049140"," Do you have a Twitter handle?"
"1063740","1064640"," Let's have a little chat."
"1076910","1077570"," Anyone know?"
"1093500","1097380"," Just seeing the Bank of England is to give evidence to the UK Parliament Committee."
"1097460","1097880"," Nobody knows. "
"1098420","1119730"," Okay, so we'll"
"1119730","1120650"," make this quick and simple."
"1121050","1121830"," Let's start with this."
"1122510","1123990"," Let me be very clear here. "
"1127270","1133270"," If I wanted to sit around in a trade in IWM, let's take a really quick and simple."
"1134810","1138250"," If I wanted to sit around in a call in IWM for a week, I would."
"1140490","1142730"," We don't trade the IWM here, do we?"
"1143130","1144470"," We trade the S&P 500. "
"1147350","1149290"," IWM follows the S&P 500."
"1150650","1153330"," So number one, we don't trade the IWM here."
"1155150","1155870"," That's number one. "
"1156730","1157410"," Number two."
"1159090","1161570"," We trade the S&P 500 here."
"1162390","1162670"," Right?"
"1162890","1163550"," That's what we trade, right?"
"1165350","1165970"," That's number two. "
"1170150","1172470"," We already know, I just trade the IWM."
"1172770","1175450"," It was like a really slow as fuck."
"1177050","1178190"," To pay index. "
"1179470","1180070"," Boring."
"1180890","1184250"," And it has no liquidity in it, but we don't know that either."
"1184250","1189670"," We know the IWM follows generally S&P 500. "
"1190050","1195410"," We also know that IWM took a fucking bloodbath with the S&P again."
"1195890","1196490"," Didn't."
"1197070","1198850"," Because it's the S&P 500. "
"1200110","1202270"," Now, this is the second problem."
"1202430","1202630"," This is the second problem that I got."
"1202710","1206070"," This is the second problem that I got. "
"1208190","1210070"," The S&P 500 went up with IWM."
"1210590","1213030"," IWM means nothing, but I don't trade the IWM."
"1213570","1215730"," And this isn't the IWM show either, is it?"
"1216930","1218610"," That's not my other issue. "
"1220170","1221110"," Yeah, we're not done."
"1221250","1223670"," I want her fucking banned from this fucking stream."
"1224350","1224830"," Number one. "
"1226770","1228490"," So I want her gone from the stream."
"1232150","1233390"," That's like number one."
"1233670","1235150"," You already know what I'm leading up to here. "
"1236210","1236850"," That's number one."
"1238190","1242930"," If you want to trade the IWM and create your own IWM trading channel, that's what you trade."
"1243970","1246690"," Start your own live stream for the IWM. "
"1247390","1250270"," And I don't like your liquid indexes."
"1251090","1255330"," It's like a third or fourth index to trade if there's nothing going on anywhere else."
"1257070","1258870"," That's not something that I'm interested in. "
"1259210","1261730"," Interested in liquidity in an index."
"1262630","1265630"," I want to be able to get in and out the price that I want to get in and out"
"1265630","1265770"," in."
"1266130","1267230"," And that's not small caps. "
"1271750","1273510"," Okay, that's number one."
"1274050","1274570"," Number two."
"1276350","1279450"," The best trade in small caps yesterday. "
"1281630","1283350"," Was buying regional banks."
"1285330","1290890"," Not only buying regional banks but buying options on regional banks and not the IWM specifically."
"1291390","1292210"," You could go in and dice. "
"1292470","1296430"," You could go in with a pair of tweezers yesterday and we spent yesterday."
"1297090","1301330"," Going over all of the snapback prices on those individual tickers."
"1302430","1303490"," All day long yesterday. "
"1303730","1306010"," So rather than focusing on some shit index."
"1307730","1312770"," I read off TV yesterday all of the tickers that were ripping face from the start to the close."
"1313310","1317530"," Now if any of you with Jennifer trades, walk your asses right out of this stream. "
"1317550","1318290"," I don't need you here."
"1319910","1320870"," You get what I'm saying?"
"1324060","1325080"," So yeah, this one's out."
"1325340","1325740"," She's gone. "
"1326120","1327200"," Anyone else want to go with her."
"1328140","1329360"," You don't like making money."
"1330000","1331340"," Get the fuck on out. "
"1338210","1341240"," It's real simple."
"1341840","1343680"," It's not like a woman or man thing."
"1344060","1344560"," I love women. "
"1344700","1345140"," Love women traders."
"1346300","1348320"," I actually embraced them."
"1348400","1350440"," The command actually post on Twitter all the time. "
"1350900","1352960"," Trying to introduce female traders and stuff."
"1353200","1353440"," Love them."
"1354240","1355120"," It's not a man woman thing. "
"1355240","1356080"," Someone saying that yesterday."
"1356220","1357140"," I'm like, it's not a man woman thing."
"1357700","1358700"," Anyways, share a form. "
"1359780","1360900"," Do you want your own stream?"
"1361100","1362140"," Go do your own fucking stream."
"1362840","1367460"," You want to spend your own money on your own services and your own equipment, your own time?"
"1368400","1369020"," That's what you do."
"1369160","1370620"," You want to trade the IWM?"
"1371360","1373040"," Go out there and make your own stream about the IWM. "
"1373800","1374620"," Go out there and do it."
"1375140","1375960"," Don't trade the IWM."
"1377460","1382460"," I'd rather drive a nail in my face and my eyeballs than trade the IWM. "
"1382700","1383860"," Sometimes I have in the past."
"1386000","1387920"," But if I'm trading the IWM, you'll know it."
"1387920","1388560"," I'll tell you. "
"1391020","1395680"," What are the IWM come up today and versus bank stocks that we talked about yesterday?"
"1396260","1397580"," Nowhere fucking there."
"1398800","1402980"," The individual regional bank stocks, mid-sized cap stock, red cap stock, red bank stocks."
"1403360","1404540"," So I don't want to hear it. "
"1404800","1406120"," I just don't want to hear it in my stream."
"1408180","1413700"," If you can find her Twitter so I can block her ass, please let me know who she is."
"1424910","1425710"," That's what it is. "
"1425830","1427570"," If you don't like it, then get on out."
"1429570","1430370"," That's simple."
"1430850","1431570"," I got friends in it. "
"1431750","1433630"," All these people are in this stream right here."
"1434170","1436130"," I've been trading with these people for two years."
"1441240","1441960"," Two years. "
"1442660","1444320"," I don't know who this person is, Jennifer trades."
"1444840","1447260"," I don't know who she is screaming inside my chat or the chat."
"1448220","1448980"," I don't care. "
"1450960","1452200"," I don't care."
"1452400","1453420"," I don't care who she is."
"1453660","1454320"," It's my money. "
"1456260","1458580"," It's my money with my bills that I have to pay."

"1472980","1473480"," Known for it."
"1475800","1476620"," Not that guy. "
"1485790","1487410"," I don't care what she's saying."
"1487970","1490090"," I don't care."
"1490230","1493650"," If you're in chat and you're talking with somebody else in chat and you're like. "
"1494530","1495530"," You're in chat and you're like."
"1496530","1497710"," Hey, we should do this."
"1497830","1498210"," We should do that. "
"1498530","1499170"," I don't give a fine."
"1499470","1499730"," Fuck what?"
"1500430","1502710"," If you're going to scream in the chat and be like."
"1505350","1506510"," Like spamming the chat. "
"1507070","1507490"," I don't care."
"1508910","1509890"," I don't care."
"1510010","1511170"," I don't care about the last Thursday. "
"1511170","1518610"," I mean, three great trades that day that made bank on Thursday in the one where we rolled over."
"1519070","1523370"," I wasn't paying attention to the market trying to deal with more shit in the chat."
"1524150","1527930"," You know, so at this point, we're at a point right now, right?"
"1529850","1533770"," Where, you know, if you're just going to be, if you're going to be inside the chat and making"
"1533770","1534830"," problems, you're just out. "
"1535930","1536830"," It's that simple."
"1538750","1539190"," Yeah."
"1542970","1543190"," Okay. "
"1543350","1543630"," So we're done."
"1543910","1544370"," Let's move on."
"1544490","1544970"," We're out of this. "
"1545330","1545730"," I agree."
"1546350","1546770"," Gone."
"1547870","1549550"," DIP bought here on our one. "
"1552230","1553730"," DIP bought here on our one."
"1555330","1557310"," We tagged PT one right here."
"1557330","1558610"," That one is done again. "
"1559730","1563110"," Now we're looking for above at PT two at three ninety three ten."
"1563550","1566470"," Now we do have some missions with a call wall above at three ninety three."
"1566470","1570690"," So we need call buyers to step into the market to see if we can go higher. "
"1571030","1572630"," Let's look at a five minute chart real quick."
"1573270","1575570"," On the five minute looks really strong as well, right?"
"1576470","1577590"," We're trading above."
"1578390","1579670"," And this is the craziest part. "
"1579830","1581230"," We got some stuff to talk about."
"1581670","1583390"," There is real risk in this market."
"1584210","1586650"," And I don't like that part of like what was going on. "
"1586930","1589830"," There's some real risk in this market right now."
"1590190","1592510"," We're switching to five minute charts for a reason."
"1592510","1596650"," Two, like we're switching to five minute charts as people are getting cut up, right?"
"1597030","1602070"," And we want some confirmation that we're going higher as well in confidence in a trade that you're"
"1602070","1602450"," taking. "
"1602770","1605210"," And you don't need to take the entire trade."
"1605690","1611130"," You know, oftentimes people, there's oftentimes people are like risk here, risk here, risk here."
"1611670","1616850"," When there's actually a longer, larger trade over a five minute chart in a one hour chart in a"
"1616850","1620130"," daily chart that you can take a trade in some kind of confidence. "
"1621530","1625810"," You know, so when you're calling like, buy this, buy this, buy this, and you're just spamming it"
"1625810","1628670"," and spam it and spam it, can't listen to it."
"1629550","1631750"," And not only that, there's a longer trade ahead."
"1632170","1634190"," Even looking at the market this morning. "
"1634310","1635490"," Let's look at the market this morning."
"1635610","1640570"," As a matter of fact, when I bought yesterday's banks, I bought the underlying because I still"
"1640570","1645670"," didn't feel confidence buying options in these underlying banks."
"1645670","1650950"," I felt I felt danger still in the market and I still right now feel danger in the market. "
"1651050","1656110"," Matter of fact, more than feel, the market is as dangerous as it can be right now."
"1657790","1661690"," It says dangerous as it can be even with prices going higher at this moment."
"1662030","1668090"," And so parts of this, I'm just like, it's like all over the place. "
"1668770","1669850"," And here's the worst part."
"1670710","1674830"," I haven't talked about this in the stream, but it doesn't matter where the market goes."
"1674830","1680830"," There's always going to be people saying it's going up or it's going down, right?"
"1681370","1685510"," And the moment it goes the other way, half the people get quiet and the other half cheers. "
"1686290","1688450"," Now, let's say I'm right once."
"1689650","1690570"," I get chairs, right?"
"1691090","1691950"," I'm right a second time."
"1692050","1692490"," I get chairs. "
"1693030","1697310"," And then the one time I'm wrong, I get, oh, no, he was wrong, right?"
"1697490","1699830"," But you see these chairs and chairs go back and forth."
"1699830","1706430"," So you as a listener or a watcher or someone in the chat, there's always going to be a right"
"1706430","1706750"," group."
"1707150","1709090"," It's never going to be the same people. "
"1709830","1711070"," So you have to be aware of that."
"1711150","1712350"," It's like this counter-alpha thing."
"1712690","1714710"," It's really weird, the mechanics of it. "
"1715530","1717830"," And the danger in the market is real right now."
"1717910","1721050"," No matter what anyone tells you out there, we're going to look at that today."
"1721130","1724270"," We're going to look at a bunch of macro stuff, the big wavy lines that we look at. "
"1724830","1728270"," And there's real danger in the market, no matter what anyone's telling you."
"1729450","1735330"," The threes and tens, the twos and tens, the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, the fed funds"
"1735330","1740230"," rate, historic matter of fact, Andy constant was on Twitter this morning."
"1740670","1743710"," And he was given the him and I forget the other guy's name. "
"1743710","1745430"," They were like, Hey, look, there's one other scenario."
"1745830","1747270"," That's the no land scenario."
"1747830","1754590"," Now, outside of that no land scenario, it's the only hole in this market not burning to the ground. "
"1754590","1757990"," And 66 million contracts traded on March 13."
"1758630","1760450"," And right now we're in high risk of that."
"1760710","1766730"," Even right now at this moment, right here, right now, we're one news story away from one more bank"
"1766730","1772630"," failing or something else happening that we don't know from all these rate increases that could"
"1772630","1774150"," reverse this market on a dime. "
"1775010","1777030"," And we're still in negative gamma right now."
"1777630","1784470"," We have a bunch of stuff in this market right now."
"1784470","1787890"," You do what you need to do with the rest that you need to put on the market, but even"
"1787890","1788270"," so. "
"1788850","1790450"," I don't know."
"1790770","1792830"," I'm at a loss of words right now."
"1793610","1794910"," Overall this so. "
"1796850","1798030"," That's that's my point."
"1799290","1800510"," That's my actual point."
"1800770","1802850"," So, so right now, right. "
"1803530","1804670"," Now we're in a five minute chart."
"1804670","1806330"," This looks pretty healthy right here."
"1806690","1811330"," We know that we can trade right now off the off the five minute off 3,972. "
"1812030","1814630"," Right not the yellow line, but this white line right here."
"1814730","1822410"," We teed off it when we teed off it this morning at 840 this morning right right after CPI report."
"1822410","1829370"," We move higher right now as long as we maintain a trade above 3,972. "
"1829370","1830550"," This trade is still valid."
"1831990","1833410"," It's 1003 in the morning."
"1833450","1835650"," We also know that on a one minute chart. "
"1837190","1839110"," That as long as we hold on a second here."
"1842260","1847380"," As long as we get as long as we get every 15 minutes half hour, that kind of stuff."
"1847860","1853180"," We get a new high off of every touch of this one minute chart that trend is still higher. "
"1853220","1853660"," Okay."
"1854340","1857100"," So it's 1003 right now right back here."
"1857140","1858060"," It was 957. "
"1858380","1858820"," Okay."
"1859340","1860500"," So we tagged the one minute."
"1860520","1862580"," We now have 15 minutes to make a new high. "
"1867120","1868400"," And where's that new high?"
"1868600","1869680"," It's above 3,9192."
"1870480","1874300"," If we don't make the new high, we're going to roll back over and retest."
"1875940","1876740"," 3,975. "
"1882450","1883650"," Yeah, I just can't have it man."
"1883750","1885330"," I just can't can't have it at all."
"1886190","1887370"," In any way shape or form. "
"1890480","1892160"," It's just can't."
"1907280","1908600"," It's just nonstop."
"1909060","1912000"," If you have like a hundred, if every person in this stream. "
"1913240","1915760"," Spammed like that, it would be a shit show in here."
"1921570","1923690"," So I want to say something here now at this point."
"1923810","1924550"," We get happy now. "

"3254780","3256540"," So when we're below it we're bearish."
"3256860","3257800"," We're above it we're bullish. "
"3259560","3262040"," Bears are up here waiting to sell."
"3263140","3265400"," This three ninety eight three ninety seven."
"3265540","3266280"," That's what they're waiting for. "
"3266380","3267720"," That's what the real sellers are there."
"3268700","3269720"," A trade above."
"3270840","3273860"," Needs a confirmation for the move higher for bulls. "
"3275460","3278120"," Normally when we get up here we'll reject the first time."
"3279660","3280100"," Usually."
"3283950","3287010"," So let's say we hold on saying let's say we reject this above. "
"3291050","3292850"," Right we have an initial rejection."
"3293950","3296390"," You're going to then wait for the hourly to come up."
"3296430","3297790"," You're going to wait for the. "
"3301860","3304400"," Fair plan or a bull plane up here on price."
"3304920","3308520"," And hopefully this cluster here along with this daily will push us above."
"3308680","3309580"," I don't think that it does. "
"3310040","3312980"," I think I think our first rejection is here and then we get one more."
"3313060","3314400"," Our double top is up here."
"3315160","3318540"," Now with that being said three ninety three is kind of the place. "
"3318560","3322420"," It looks like to me somewhere around three ninety three would be the place."
"3322460","3325360"," So three ninety three and then three ninety five three ninety four."
"3326000","3327100"," Somewhere up in there. "
"3328420","3330500"," So let's go real just real quick here."
"3335520","3338760"," So somewhere in here this will become support PT two."
"3339200","3341880"," Should become kind of support if we make our way above. "
"3342460","3345860"," To this three ninety five okay so we will have something like this."
"3346580","3347420"," Up here."
"3347420","3349760"," Or this is what this is what we're anticipating. "
"3351120","3353300"," Right no one's got a crystal ball out there."
"3353480","3354660"," No matter what anybody tells you."
"3355480","3357220"," We're looking for this trade up here. "
"3358020","3358660"," A rejection."
"3359400","3361660"," And then some kind of support down here."
"3362240","3366500"," In time for the one minute the five minutes come down and scoop it back up. "
"3367060","3370320"," Break through and above and then attack the."
"3371180","3372020"," The daily."
"3373080","3373600"," Trend. "
"3377300","3381980"," So they're great or trying to squeeze this up and over get to that PT two."
"3382220","3385000"," There are some real sellers above here at three ninety three ten."
"3385220","3386620"," This was a cash market. "
"3387120","3388920"," Sell point for sellers."
"3389860","3393400"," In the market we're going to also look at the VIX real quick."
"3397540","3398700"," Take a look at the VIX. "
"3400440","3400920"," And."
"3402380","3406620"," Some targets for you okay so if you're like hey we're going to come into some support of the VIX."
"3406620","3409200"," Two targets for you twenty two twenty seven. "
"3411500","3413400"," And twenty one thirteen."
"3414180","3417780"," You will get a reaction on twenty one thirteen I guarantee to close to it."
"3417940","3419360"," You'll get a reaction down there. "
"3420160","3421840"," All right so just keep an eye on the VIX."
"3424740","3427380"," Right we can ping pong around in here you'll see the."
"3427540","3430800"," You know support resistance on spy work with these things. "
"3431540","3433360"," Twenty one eleven on VIX."
"3434740","3436600"," Twenty two twenty eight on the VIX."
"3437120","3439080"," We'll also look at HYG real quick. "
"3442080","3443480"," HYG is bullish right now."
"3444180","3448760"," We're above the one the five and the hourly on HYG."
"3449540","3450520"," And the target above. "
"3451300","3453700"," This would be where you see like three ninety eight."
"3454180","3455620"," It would be seventy four thirty eight."
"3456100","3458040"," You can still see they're teeing off this. "
"3459160","3463120"," Right over here they teed off it back here and they're going to be looking to tee off it again"
"3463120","3465140"," on HYG above."
"3467560","3470960"," Now squeezing three ninety two thirty eight to go higher."
"3473260","3475100"," Just squeezing right along here. "
"3476140","3480340"," We'll look at the five minute real quick just grinding right off that yellow line."
"3480420","3481300"," We're not even on the white line."
"3481440","3482780"," This is extreme bullishness right. "
"3483320","3485360"," We're just teeing right off on the five minute."
"3487120","3490060"," Just teeing off and just grinding higher to this PT two."
"3490820","3492960"," Close enough for hand grenades and horseshoes probably. "
"3496790","3499830"," Just buy the zero dates and forget about them until we get a pull back."
"3508270","3511710"," Now we're going to talk about now this is the day to talk about put back spreads."
"3514350","3517630"," There's a reason for this now put back spreads. "
"3519550","3521750"," I'll try to give you like the the quick overview."
"3523210","3527050"," So you're selling your selling in in the money put."
"3528710","3529890"," Selling in the money put. "
"3532230","3538730"," The price of the S&P 500 matters where you make this trade."
"3541260","3542940"," And the idea here is that."
"3545040","3548480"," And then you're you're you're selling a put and you're going to buy. "
"3549660","3553620"," Lower to lower strikes you can do this with more though but November 2023."
"3554740","3560700"," ESTR forward rises to three spot five five percent from around three spot three percent on Monday."
"3561240","3565380"," We're just talking about it or a one to two one to two ratios spread so. "
"3566680","3567900"," You're selling a put."
"3568640","3571600"," Okay and a strike and this is where you are in the chart."
"3572180","3575940"," Like so right now now I don't think you should do it right here but if we're at three ninety"
"3575940","3577400"," two you'd do like in the money. "
"3577400","3584700"," And then you do a lower strike to outside the money puts that you buy."
"3586060","3587940"," And you set the time frame on it."
"3588820","3591780"," There is some risk in this trade so. "
"3593580","3598940"," If you hold anyways you make this trade you if they're good trades to put with time on them as"
"3598940","3599280"," my point."
"3600160","3604380"," So if you put six months on them and it takes three months for them to come in the money."
"3606640","3610180"," All the better because you can just take the money and run you're not holding these things into"
"3610180","3610760"," expiry. "
"3610960","3614740"," You've got some time on them for them to hit the target that you want."
"3614900","3619620"," So if you want them for nine months to give yourself six months to in your time frame that you're"
"3619620","3620080"," looking for."
"3621280","3623780"," And you can even cut legs off of this trade. "
"3624720","3631060"," If you know if some material comes in the market and you're like shit we're going to 450."
"3631700","3635420"," Just cut the put side loose and just ride that sold put all the way up."
"3636440","3638800"," And you can actually make some money on this trade. "
"3639940","3642320"," If it goes up even though it's a bearish trade."
"3645700","3653000"," Now going back to the beginning of the conversation you also want to place this trade at a tactical"
"3653000","3654460"," place on a chart."
"3656160","3663620"," And this being an idea of like you don't want to be wearing the bottom of a channel right now"
"3663620","3666860"," you don't want to place it there you want to place it maybe in the middle of a channel. "
"3667360","3669800"," We're in a downward channel in the spy right now right."
"3671220","3674180"," Or even at the top of that channel is even better."
"3677240","3681700"," So I think the midway point is 400 right now for 10 would be beautiful. "
"3682460","3687560"," But at 400 if we go up to 410 you're likely going to start printing that sold put."
"3689620","3691200"," So that's probably close enough."
"3691400","3696020"," Another thing that we know is that sellers are up at 400 we know at 398 we have sellers up"
"3696020","3696900"," there we know they're up there. "
"3699240","3703100"," We know it's like an auto short even if we trade higher we know it's an auto short we know"
"3703100","3704920"," that there's algorithms are going to short 398."
"3705720","3706780"," Garin fucking tea."
"3710260","3714980"," 39256 trading right now looking for PT two or maybe just slightly underneath it. "
"3716900","3719080"," Just grinding away higher right now."
"3720840","3722380"," Good place take some money."
"3723980","3728420"," If you're greedy and you want to see that slap in the ass get 393 I understand if you want"
"3728420","3730480"," to hold all day long to the close I understand. "
"3732920","3736420"," If you got like a weekly call on right now and you just don't care I understand."
"3737140","3741160"," You got a monthly on you got a call spread on you just going to hold it in there I"
"3741160","3741400"," understand."
"3746420","3750580"," We're getting there though I think 393 is like the wall somewhere up in there unless something's"
"3750580","3751900"," changed unless. "
"3754140","3754540"," Unless."
"3756500","3762020"," Chase has some other idea I don't I haven't checked through the call walls I think it's that 393."
"3770040","3774460"," Hey Chase where's the where's the call wall on spy today. "
"3775400","3778580"," Is it 393 sorry brother I was asking for you."
"3782830","3786570"," I was asking for you in stream earlier I didn't know you're in stream and then out of stream I"
"3786570","3787270"," was looking for you."
"3800980","3802620"," The ball triggers that 3960. "
"3809200","3812980"," Yeah 39275 that's what I see I see it right right there two 393."
"3812980","3820580"," Then you got this 393 10 like right in here these are real sellers from earlier in the week the"
"3820580","3821040"," last week."
"3821940","3826680"," This is a cash market sellers here this the sage the sage line pivot. "
"3831220","3833120"," Max 4000 into apex."
"3836550","3839410"," Yeah three ninety eight that's I've got three ninety eight in the spy."
"3841610","3844370"," Or no three ninety eight and now SPX or at ES. "
"3845250","3846650"," I've got I've got it in spy."
"3848150","3852070"," Missy on spy Max on spy what I what do I see Max on spy is."
"3856990","3859710"," Three ninety eight twenty six for spy. "
"3861270","3862150"," For ES."
"3864290","3865790"," Or let's do SPX."
"3869560","3872300"," I've got three nine eight eight point seven zero. "
"3877960","3880660"," I think we sell I think we sell in the OPEC's personally."
"3882560","3883960"," I think what to get up there we sell."
"3884740","3887220"," I figured we'd squeeze up Friday's Friday or Monday. "
"3888260","3890740"," It's Tuesday so maybe we sell out we start selling."
"3891660","3893180"," Maybe we just get the squeeze."
"3893740","3897940"," I figured we'd squeeze up like Friday or Monday and then sell into OPEC's but. "
"3899000","3900480"," Can't fucking time this shit every day."
"3901380","3908740"," Yeah the upper level Troy is four zero six five."
"3912480","3916200"," They're actually meant that that trades paid for right. "
"3916420","3918580"," They'll make a little money for below four zero six five."

"4261730","4262370"," Make sure."
"4262530","4263010"," Hey buddy."
"4263010","4263590"," How are you doing?"
"4265370","4267290"," And I want you to just realize here. "

"4271470","4273190"," It's that same place three ninety seven. "
"4273190","4276690"," I mean I'm just make sure that you can take the hit back down to three ninety seventy nine."
"4277010","4277970"," If we pull back."
"4278170","4278730"," It's a nice place. "
"4278730","4279230"," It's a nice place."
"4279250","4280130"," Just take some off."
"4281210","4282770"," If you're long a little bit more. "
"4283610","4286750"," You leave a little bit on and you can add to a position to take an extra higher."
"4287270","4287950"," Just like this."
"4289190","4291330"," Now if we break above right here. "
"4292230","4296170"," We break above PT to we're going to at least start to consolidate here."
"4296690","4298770"," It's like a couple places in here to take a little bit off."
"4298770","4302330"," Look for some consolidation either above or below. "
"4304450","4305490"," Heading into the hour."
"4305890","4306950"," So it's now ten forty four."
"4307030","4308730"," We've got a fifteen sixty minutes left. "

"4337800","4340060"," I have college coming to one child the next few years. "
"4340060","4341200"," I don't know what I'm going to do."
"4342560","4343940"," I don't know what she's going to do."
"4346340","4352680"," She's very smart too but she's I got to be honest I wouldn't I don't I shouldn't say this but. "
"4354400","4355520"," She's pulling the."
"4357200","4360420"," Oh I blame you guys for those two things they blame you guys for."
"4360880","4362320"," So I got pictures for you too. "

"4369100","4377180"," So we took the kids out to go bowling and then play video games and eat pizza."
"4378760","4383740"," Over the weekend you guys tipped on you guys tipped on Friday I think so."
"4384200","4388280"," Took the kids out with that money and my oldest daughter. "
"4389280","4395060"," This is the this is the child that's a national honor society honors chemistry."
"4395680","4397280"," Just sophomore honors chemistry."
"4398160","4400300"," All this stuff right works their butt off. "
"4402760","4406220"," And she tried pulling the I don't know if I want to go to college thinking I was like oh"
"4406220","4406940"," no no no no."
"4407240","4409160"," I was like I'm not having that conversation."
"4413710","4415390"," It was like we are having that conversation. "
"4415910","4417650"," She's like we're having pizza and having a great time."
"4417790","4418430"," I want to have it now."
"4419010","4419990"," I'm like okay I'll be quiet. "
"4422170","4424010"," I don't know if it's that teenager billion."
"4424010","4427190"," I don't know if it's real."
"4427970","4428750"," I let it die. "
"4428830","4429430"," I didn't say anything."
"4429590","4431110"," I just I just got quiet."
"4433530","4435770"," I have like a she's not preteen anymore. "
"4436130","4438610"," She's but she's getting to that age where they're."
"4439990","4442830"," You know they're like testing out ideas."
"4443690","4444990"," And she's a great kid by the way. "
"4446050","4447210"," Nothing bad to say."
"4447930","4451430"," I don't know if she's like oh I'm just going to go like some kids I meet these kids are"
"4451430","4452370"," like I'm not going to college."
"4452370","4453390"," I'm just going to learn how to code. "
"4454110","4455170"," I'll get an instant job."
"4456030","4457830"," She better not be that kid."
"4460510","4464830"," She'll be reading those stories about how some kids so smart they don't have to go to college. "
"4466930","4468370"," That's an antidote."
"4468370","4470830"," It'll note it's not most kids."
"4475780","4479020"," 39268 right now can we tag 393 here. "
"4485070","4486390"," Well that's my thing too."
"4486390","4488930"," I'm like I don't want to burden her with a bunch of college costs."
"4489290","4493130"," I want to go out there and go to school and like have fun and meet people and network and"
"4493130","4493550"," all that stuff. "
"4494610","4502060"," And but then the cost of schooling of course and then what kind of school and you're going to get"
"4502060","4503640"," is a pay when you're done with it."
"4504080","4504920"," Blah blah blah."
"4505740","4506820"," All that kind of stuff. "
"4507480","4508620"," Then of course it's a teenager."
"4508620","4509740"," You got to remember she's a teenager."
"4513750","4514810"," Yeah, that's a fair point. "
"4514970","4515490"," You know maybe after."
"4515670","4517070"," Yeah, she's never watched that movie."
"4518470","4519950"," She's never watched that movie. "
"4521190","4523630"," So I'll have to have her watch that movie right that shit down."
"4534520","4535340"," Good will hunt."
"4537100","4541120"," That was one of the most fair representations of or legitimate. "
"4542340","4544820"," Like that was what Boston was like at one time."
"4549780","4550460"," I didn't grad."
"4550760","4551240"," See here we go. "

"4568360","4569180"," No problem smart. "
"4575460","4576500"," Yeah, that's true too."
"4576720","4578060"," You're saying I haven't painted the picture."
"4578260","4579240"," I don't think she needs it. "
"4579240","4580180"," I think she needs it for."
"4580440","4582180"," Not needs it, but I want to have the experience."

"4866660","4868700"," Train three ninety three zero."
"4871860","4874380"," Still a little bit more room on on spy. "
"4874680","4875500"," Let me take a look at SPX."
"4875500","4877140"," SPX has more room to go higher."
"4878660","4882840"," Spy just cranking up here trying to tag three ninety five fifty one. "
"4883880","4885920"," Three ninety five fifty one."
"4887200","4887760"," Is."
"4892910","4893850"," Right there. "
"4894490","4896270"," It's actually come down a little bit."
"4901510","4904070"," That's the trade that I want to take if we can get this."
"4906770","4908290"," We can get above here. "
"4914220","4917840"," Being trade above here and hold this I'd like to take that trade right there."
"4919280","4921040"," Even if we were to roll down a little bit."
"4922400","4927080"," And take that trade anything like that I'd like to take that if this five minute can roll up here. "
"4928220","4931120"," Come down in here and nail that trade above."
"4934260","4936820"," The five minutes just screaming higher right now."
"4954420","4957360"," We're going to talk about we're going to talk about. "
"4960300","4964140"," Put back spreads we're going to talk about when we've been talking about put back spreads"
"4964140","4968340"," positioning of put back spreads when do you put them on how do they pay."
"4969000","4970860"," If you put a put back spread on."
"4971760","4976300"," On a larger time frame someone asked earlier about weekly charts. "
"4976760","4980020"," I have looked at weekly charts I see exactly where that short is."
"4980420","4984540"," I see exactly where that failure to make a new high is the failure to get a."
"4985340","4987460"," Higher low right or higher high I should say."
"4988460","4992740"," And how the weekly chart does look very bearish right now we all know some of you may know that"
"4992740","4995560"," or not know that weekly chart looks bearish as fuck. "
"4996260","5000300"," Super bearish even though we're squeezing up right now it looks bearish."
"5001500","5005580"," Now you're positioning on put back spreads you remember we saw we're selling a put we're buying a"
"5005580","5006020"," put right."
"5006700","5007380"," Kind of need. "
"5009900","5015740"," Let's say this was the middle of that downward channel on spy right kind of need to put like sell"
"5015740","5016660"," the put right here."
"5018020","5024020"," And buy the puts down here and so the idea would be is if we go above."
"5024980","5029020"," That put that you sold is going to print to pay for these. "
"5030040","5033700"," Right now let's say we trade higher there you could actually either leave these on."
"5034220","5039580"," Take the money on the put side that you sold to pay for the trade below for free puts six"
"5039580","5040480"," or nine months out."
"5042360","5045540"," So we're going to look at a larger time frame here we are trading below. "
"5046740","5051820"," We got basically you can call that a tag right there pretty close missed by ten pennies."
"5052660","5055640"," We might still get up there and tag that three three ninety three ten."
"5057400","5061220"," If we can't get a new high so it's ten fifty seven right. "
"5062020","5066300"," We've got fifteen minutes now to make a high off of this white line right here."
"5068160","5071300"," As of eleven o'clock but I think we're going to roll over here I think we're going to get"
"5071300","5072060"," some roll over."
"5072360","5074920"," We've got looking looking below we've got three ninety one seventeen. "
"5077040","5081420"," And we're going to see if they can get us back down to this three ninety one seventeen here."
"5082760","5084240"," We'll look in the five minute real quick."
"5087780","5090280"," Right there three ninety one seventeen down below. "
"5093990","5098770"," We might hold this we can still hold this right here too so don't don't take this as uber bearish."
"5111650","5114970"," What I'll do is I'm going to bring I'm going to see if I can bring up a chart to"
"5114970","5118130"," bring a chart up over."
"5119470","5122930"," You want to make sure that you want to watch this down below here okay. "
"5126280","5128560"," Ten fifty eight now two minutes left for bulls."
"5156610","5158410"," Now trading three ninety two twenty three."
"5159870","5161830"," We'll look on the five minutes so you can see it. "
"5177010","5181610"," Now you'll get this retest down below you see this bear playing right here small time frame bear"
"5181610","5181910"," playing."
"5182510","5186650"," I want to get back down here and try to pick up some more calls down here three ninety one"
"5186650","5188390"," twenty if we can hopefully we can get down here."
"5189590","5193930"," We have a little bit of minor support above here in this white on this yellow line right here. "
"5195010","5197870"," Three ninety one eighty one I don't know if we can get all the way down here but I'd like"
"5197870","5198050"," to."
"5198930","5200290"," I'd like to reenter again."
"5216570","5219470"," Three ninety one twenty and three ninety one eighty one here. "
"5220130","5221590"," You can see a pullback here."
"5222250","5225410"," We're trying to we're trying to take this down right here."
"5227210","5241930"," I'm going to push this up and they're going to try to get down into here if they"
"5241930","5242130"," can. "
"5257630","5260990"," I'm going to go back to the five minute chart here and actually let me see a look at the"
"5260990","5261910"," VIX as well."
"5268530","5272570"," VIX finding some port right here and I'm going to show you VIX real quick here okay."
"5273410","5274370"," Bring up the VIX for you. "
"5278010","5279910"," All right I want you to see the VIX here."
"5280910","5284790"," I want you to see this five minute chart I want you to see this right here this five right"
"5284790","5286390"," here coming down."
"5286990","5288990"," I want you to see the VIX bounce that we're getting here. "
"5288990","5294190"," So if you're looking for the next trade on spy long you want to see the VIX here."
"5295290","5296750"," I'm going to go to a one minute here."
"5299870","5305250"," So I know on your own charts at home way to look at twenty three fifty one in a one"
"5305250","5311390"," minute chart somewhere in there right and look for that as a place maybe even slightly lower as a"
"5311390","5314430"," place for the spy to get bullish again okay. "
"5315250","5318490"," You're going to be looking for something like this and then a rejection to lower."
"5319630","5327070"," And somewhere in there to grab I think that's a twenty three forty or so in the VIX."
"5327870","5329390"," Twenty three forty or so. "
"5330070","5332930"," And you look for the VIX to be supportive on the one minute here okay."
"5336790","5338090"," Let's look at the VIX real quick."
"5353460","5358520"," Just seeing the hunt considers limiting UK energy profits tax when price is full. "
"5364420","5368820"," And officials say the wind full tax changes unlikely in budget Wednesday."
"5401970","5404150"," Right in here to get twenty two forty."
"5404970","5410290"," We can start sell down that's good news for bulls but if not be careful of a trade here. "
"5410990","5415950"," And then a resumption the down move here somewhere in here this twenty two thirty twenty two sixty"
"5415950","5420190"," four somewhere in here be careful this trade right here higher on the VIX."
"5429160","5430460"," Yeah you're looking for that."
"5431620","5434620"," It shows up better on the fifteen minute chart on the VIX. "
"5439640","5442820"," See that yellow line that this is where the cluster comes in."
"5443540","5447760"," So the VIX starts selling off here we'll go up but if not if there's anything like that you want"
"5447760","5450380"," to be this is the money trade right here for the spy."
"5475140","5478340"," That's probably the trade for the four hundred for three ninety eight. "

"6831330","6832070"," Built this house. "
"6832950","6837710"," Built up the basement first so that I could move us in there before winter time came."
"6837710","6842920"," And I met all the neighbors all that kind of stuff right."
"6843100","6845660"," That was the first experience for us in Detroit. "
"6845660","6850180"," You're like I love the nice places very nice places very nice homes very nice big homes all this"
"6850180","6850600"," nice stuff."
"6864670","6877470"," Yeah, I"
"6877470","6880430"," still encounter some of that I encounter some and kind of all kind."
"6880710","6883810"," If someone doesn't know me on kind of that sure I'll encounter that. "
"6887210","6889930"," You can kind of all kinds of people and kind of like."
"6890270","6896430"," I don't think the skin color matters the age matters sometimes to an extent."
"6897470","6899110"," And people are salty I get that. "
"6901170","6901890"," Rightfully so."
"6905330","6909750"," But you can go to these plate like so then I'm getting a go to the auction and they just"
"6909750","6910910"," leads up into right now."
"6911470","6912950"," It's kind of a shocking thing with inflation. "
"6915190","6919890"," So you could like up until about five or six years ago you go to go to an auction you"
"6919890","6925390"," can get a house for like 1500 to 7500 bucks for a 3000 square foot house."
"6925990","6928510"," You expect to pay about 50,000 for materials."
"6929890","6932890"," And labor and yourself doing some work. "
"6934150","6936270"," You get that house done for like."
"6937410","6943850"," 65 to 100,000 on how nice you wanted it as a carrying costs that kind of stuff taxes paying"
"6943850","6945910"," forward taxes back taxes all the kind of shit."
"6946490","6950430"," Make sure you don't have any water bills make sure there's no like major issues foundational issues"
"6950430","6951110"," that kind of stuff. "
"6951890","6957590"," But right now man the last they started the auction process again last year back up again and it"
"6957590","6957710"," was."
"6960050","6961730"," Those fifty thousand dollar mansions."
"6964250","6965850"," Million dollars right now. "
"6969940","6974200"," That's only six years right now those houses that were 1500 to like 7500."
"6974920","6980740"," Those are like 30 40,000 dollars that auction burned out house 15,000."
"6982860","6989100"," Then you're talking about construction costs and employment costs or cost some contract costs. "
"6989520","6990580"," Those are now double."
"6990580","6998060"," So now let's say you're buying a decent unoccupied home or something for like 30 40,000."
"6998400","7000040"," Now you're talking about a hundred grand. "
"7001480","7005980"," Minimum to spend in that house and I got like a hundred and fifty and normally in a house like"
"7005980","7008060"," this you want to be able to get back like 100% minimum."
"7009700","7014040"," Now you're talking like you're going to sell a thing it's like two fifty three fifty and for"
"7014040","7016800"," Detroit that's big that's a big move for Detroit."
"7022320","7027800"," And my point here is that Detroit if you come to Detroit you probably being pushed a narrative"
"7027800","7028620"," about Detroit but. "
"7029100","7034860"," A lot of Detroit looks like any other up and coming city in some ways and the bad parts of"
"7034860","7035180"," town."
"7035380","7040600"," I've been in a bad I've been in East L.A. I've been all the battery in New York anymore."
"7040720","7045020"," I've been there when it was the battery where they put the cat theatres and in Midtown Manhattan"
"7045020","7045880"," all kind of places. "
"7045880","7051120"," So I know Florida's got real shit holes."
"7051360","7052800"," I know Atlanta's got real shit holes."
"7053100","7056760"," I know Texas got real I know West Texas got some real dangerous places. "
"7056760","7059880"," I know Salt Lake City."
"7060560","7062780"," I think it's called West West something."
"7063460","7064960"," It's done a bad part of town. "
"7065120","7066600"," So every place has a bad part of town."
"7067460","7069080"," Even though they tell you they don't right."
"7070760","7074880"," Albuquerque, New Mexico has a highest rate of car theft in the country. "
"7074880","7077660"," I think carjackings too."
"7078840","7080500"," Right right down the road for Santa Fe."
"7085700","7087020"," Yeah, salty is right. "
"7097070","7101550"," You all are impatient out there for some money, aren't you?"
"7103370","7104790"," You got to consolidate this."
"7104950","7107270"," You're going to turn this into some kind of support for a trip higher."
"7110720","7115400"," If we can't get this done though it's 1131 if we can't get this new high we're not getting it"
"7115400","7116620"," right now we might roll over here. "
"7118180","7119680"," Might start rolling over here."
"7127190","7128150"," I'm flat again."
"7130990","7132310"," I don't want to get caught in this. "
"7134990","7135870"," It's 1131."
"7136210","7137650"," We failed to get a new high on the hour."
"7138590","7139330"," Well, we got one eleven. "
"7139650","7141330"," We got one eleven twenty seven."
"7141930","7143610"," This might be a reset right here."
"7143650","7144610"," Maybe I should have stayed long. "
"7147790","7149590"," I probably should have stayed long there."
"7150330","7151470"," I wasn't counting correctly."
"7151490","7152090"," I apologize. "
"7152090","7154670"," Because that was a tag right there."
"7162790","7163770"," 1132 now."
"7181780","7186400"," I'm long on 395 again, but I've got some stop limit on it in case you roll over. "
"7189340","7190940"," I missed this tag right here."
"7194810","7196230"," I'll trade in 39331."
"7197630","7203090"," We are looking above right now on spy for close to 39534. "
"7203910","7204710"," Somewhere up in here."
"7206250","7207510"," We got PT three right here."
"7208070","7209170"," R two right here. "
"7220820","7222520"," Yeah, I'm not expecting a lot of this trade."
"7225880","7227360"," But yeah, we can get there."
"7229700","7230940"," Unless we roll over. "
"7230980","7232140"," If we roll over back down here."
"7232360","7233780"," If we have a stop down right here."
"7233860","7236060"," I'm going to try to jump back in down below over here. "
"7237160","7238940"," It's a little soft right here."
"7239540","7241160"," Spending a little bit of time over here."
"7241860","7243600"," This turns into some kind of consolidation. "
"7244000","7244520"," Middle the afternoon."
"7244800","7246180"," We're doing this kind of ping pong stuff."
"7246880","7247660"," Down in here. "
"7249380","7250800"," Ping pong stuff right here."
"7261630","7262330"," Yeah, Chase."
"7262590","7263690"," When that happened to me, man. "
"7265630","7268350"," My like Odyssey with with my computer."
"7268550","7271490"," I was so upset and I paid like I paid a bunch."
"7271750","7272310"," I paid two. "
"7272410","7276150"," I think I paid twice to have my computer just looked at."
"7276450","7277930"," Can you please help me fast?"
"7278730","7280330"," No, no joy in that."
"7280550","7282350"," And then I'm having to buy a brand new computer. "
"7283370","7284150"," I was pretty upset."
"7284290","7285650"," I still have that other computer."
"7285870","7286710"," I haven't fixed it yet. "
"7288190","7289990"," Nothing cost me two grand."
"7290550","7291710"," So I have to get that thing fixed."
"7304610","7306270"," I'm about to get stopped out right now. "
"7309130","7309750"," I'm close."
"7310210","7310730"," I'm like a penny away."
"7311030","7311690"," Two pennies actually. "
"7321980","7323320"," Yeah, I'm out right now."
"7323720","7324000"," I'm out."
"7325300","7325940"," Right there. "
"7326080","7326640"," Five my stops."
"7329660","7330700"," So I'm out right there."
"7335100","7338140"," I have this feeling like I have this feeling that I should just hold calls. "
"7340240","7342300"," And just hold on to them all day long to the bell."
"7343240","7345460"," In that in that space right now where I'm just like."
"7346100","7348540"," I just put them on fucking don't even look at them all day long. "
"7351000","7352820"," I know a little soft right here."
"7353040","7354380"," Let me show you guys some here."
"7356000","7359640"," I'm gonna fix real quick. "
"7359640","7369410"," Yeah, you know what top today is probably 395 if we get a top."
"7371370","7373430"," There's not a lot of room to go higher here."
"7374570","7376150"," We're only at two things right now. "
"7376870","7379590"," Kind of burn out the VIX right now burn out some."
"7380950","7382550"," I'll show you guys a couple of things here."
"7390740","7392140"," It's a tough place here. "
"7394160","7396560"," Yeah, mute the book map real quick."
"7401080","7402840"," Oh, the VIX has more to go down."
"7403080","7403420"," Sorry. "
"7404240","7406980"," The VIX has more to go down here to 2106."
"7408920","7410220"," 2108 somewhere in there."
"7412980","7417140"," You know, we can get a kind of catch up bounce here in the VIX though. "
"7418020","7419380"," Some weakness in the spy."
"7425190","7430550"," Another thing about the spy is that it's coming into this resistance here."
"7431130","7434870"," This is positive for the spy right here. "
"7435130","7435670"," It's good to see."
"7437390","7441370"," Right here, but you don't see even better as if we get that bounce down there."
"7442590","7446970"," Then let this stuff all catch up to get the push that we need to get up there. "
"7449770","7450590"," 391 is 390."
"7451230","7454270"," I don't know if we pull back that far, but I like the idea of it."
"7461300","7463000"," That's that 391 down here. "
"7464540","7465780"," Get the push that we need."
"7466200","7473940"," Now, with that said, if we do drive higher, 395.48 is up here."
"7474360","7476240"," There's a trade here. "
"7476960","7484140"," There's like ad money here and ad money here to either get this right now or pull back and get"
"7484140","7484380"," this."
"7485480","7488800"," It's still on the table or some kind of failure up in here to get there."
"7495160","7499300"," They are trading calls right now, so 395 is now 41 cents. "
"7500580","7501840"," I'm not in them right now."
"7501840","7503460"," I got stopped out at 38 or 39."
"7509130","7513170"," I just bought about a 10-pack, a 395 C's. "
"7513390","7514350"," I'm going to want to add some."
"7515230","7517290"," I'll add down here if I have to."
"7519190","7521310"," Somewhere down here, if we come down there. "
"7521610","7525950"," The trade is for like 394 failures somewhere up in here."
"7526550","7530050"," If the trade rolls over and we fail to get it, I'll add to that trade."
"7530370","7533250"," I'm going to have to move the trade to a different strike. "
"7538740","7543320"," It's a good day today, so we'll throw some risk on."
"7543840","7545480"," We'll throw some gambling shit on."
"7557320","7558440"," PT4 failure, maybe. "
"7560480","7561960"," Write that PT4 failure."
"7569840","7573240"," We have failure to make 395.48 or so up here."
"7578800","7580700"," And now down below here. "
"7582460","7583740"," Add or adjust position."
"7588940","7590720"," Add or change strike."
"7593000","7597720"," If they really fuck it up, then I'm going to probably have to change the strike and put it more"
"7597720","7598000"," in the money. "
"7603030","7610630"," Now, with that said, any pullback up here, with that said any pullback up here is not really the"
"7610630","7611650"," place for the putback spread."
"7613110","7615190"," It might be tomorrow, we have to deal with that."
"7615550","7616890"," I thought it would be today. "
"7617170","7620010"," I thought we'd have enough juice to get up there today, but we may not be able to."
"7620210","7625630"," So if we can't get up there today, I really want to be up there to put that putback spread"
"7625630","7625910"," on."
"7626530","7632710"," And if we have a failure at some point this afternoon, if it's up here, or if it's a failure"
"7632710","7638410"," now and we start to consolidate down here, what we'll do is then we'll start looking at putback"
"7638410","7641350"," spreads and we'll look at macro stuff. "
"7641350","7642770"," I want you guys to see something."
"7644310","7649070"," So if you remember when we first started looking at the fed funds rate."
"7651790","7657530"," We were looking at the fed funds rate, inflation rate, unemployment rate. "
"7658530","7660850"," And then at one point, we're looking at the twos and tens."
"7661530","7663410"," We'll look at all of those right now."
"7663710","7664450"," Today, we're going to. "
"7665590","7669630"," Because when we said we need to see certain things, this was back in October."
"7670690","7675810"," We started that conversation and then in December, we built upon it."
"7676050","7679090"," And then I think January and February talked about it as well. "
"7679690","7682850"," We've talked about this layered anybody that's followed the stream for a long time."
"7682930","7683890"," Those we've been talking about."
"7685630","7690150"," We started the conversation off with this is what you're looking for. "
"7691950","7693850"," And we're starting to see those things."
"7694650","7697670"," We're even we're seeing it as well in TLT."
"7699670","7700910"," We're seeing those things. "
"7701230","7708130"," Now, there are some times where we have actually gone up and not down a very rare instances."
"7708690","7710950"," He was talking about any constant on Twitter."
"7711290","7713090"," He mentioned the one time that we didn't go down. "
"7714230","7717430"," But there was a case in 1998 where we melted up."
"7718290","7719570"," Into the brutal 2000."
"7719570","7723710"," I think that's the only hole in this whole trade. "
"7724630","7729230"," We talked about this in the beginning of the year specifically saying you'd see like a."
"7730190","7732550"," Sideways and dip by and up on TLT."
"7733330","7735810"," Then a rip face and higher by summertime."
"7736430","7740090"," That's what we're thinking like by summertime and the summer, something like that. "
"7743620","7746000"," Those charts are looking like we're there."
"7746960","7748640"," Those charts are showing a few things."
"7749520","7751480"," One, they don't care about CPI. "
"7754460","7757660"," Two, that the end of rates is probably closer than we think."
"7758200","7760360"," Three, it doesn't really matter."
"7761640","7767740"," If the Fed raises rates by 50 BPS 25 BPS pauses doesn't matter. "
"7770360","7772000"," At the end of rates is close."
"7773720","7774400"," Rate hikes."
"7775020","7778200"," So there's either going to be a 50 BPS with a pause at that point. "
"7778860","7781500"," Four pause, four 25 BPS and then a pause."
"7782260","7782900"," That shit's coming."
"7785340","7789140"," You're seeing that the two in ten roll over right the yields are rolling over. "
"7790940","7793860"," That divided by just the yields are rolling over at this point."
"7794500","7795620"," Unemployment is coming up."
"7797400","7800100"," Fed funds rate is starting to flatten it. "
"7800280","7803960"," Like flatten enough to where they'll try to front run it."
"7804940","7805920"," Inflation's coming down."
"7806900","7808760"," TLT is trading like it should be. "
"7810300","7812100"," The last key to this puzzle is going to be."
"7812620","7814780"," The last key to this puzzle, let me take the time here."
"7815380","7816900"," 1143, a couple more minutes here. "
"7817460","7819200"," We have one more interaction here on the one minute."
"7820000","7821920"," We're getting a small bear plane here."
"7822500","7823560"," Got a couple minutes here. "
"7823680","7824640"," We'll see if we can do this."
"7824680","7827580"," If we can't, I'm going to cut myself loose out of this position again."
"7827680","7829960"," Second time, taking just a few penny cut here. "
"7832340","7834900"," Keep my eye on this trade and see if it reverses on me."
"7835200","7836480"," It's 1143, two more minutes."
"7844110","7845890"," And I'm out at 37 cents. "
"7848010","7849470"," I'm not going to fuck around here now."
"7849530","7850310"," I'm going to wait for down below."
"7850670","7852210"," I'm going to look for a new position down below. "
"7852710","7854090"," Ador change strike down here."
"7854510","7856770"," If this moves higher, I want to see some development here."
"7856770","7858270"," I want to see price get above. "
"7858830","7860990"," If I can't see price get above, I'm not going to take a position."
"7861990","7865690"," We're going to talk about the, we're going to talk about the, all the stuff right now."
"7869580","7874080"," So inside of this, so all this consolidation, I'm not dealing with this bullshit in here. "
"7874300","7875040"," It's not going to deal with it."
"7875120","7878340"," I'm not going to get cut up two, three times today to make more money and take any of my"
"7878340","7879200"," winnings from this trade hire."
"7879360","7882560"," So I want to see some, I want to see some action above. "
"7882780","7885540"," I want to see a new high up here at 39345, something like that."
"7886760","7888880"," As a matter of fact, we're going to look at the five minute chart here."
"7890880","7892440"," And take the focus off the one minute. "
"7897800","7898980"," I want to see some consolidation."
"7907590","7909110"," I want to see some work done up here."
"7916220","7917720"," I'm getting cut up in here and I want to get cut up. "
"7921360","7924140"," Turn this into support right now or attempting to at least."
"7925760","7926580"," So we're there."
"7926900","7930360"," I want you to know if you're a bull or a bear, no matter what you're hearing on social media. "
"7931980","7939880"," In the news that we're there that all of these macro things that have been talked about and talked"
"7939880","7942520"," about for two years, not two years, year and a half."
"7943400","7944900"," They're actually starting to show."
"7945860","7952860"," They're starting to show like when we said when we said these are the things you're looking for. "
"7953560","7961540"," They're now showing and I don't think I don't think that it matters."
"7962500","7964380"," How much more they tighten now?"
"7964700","7970520"," I know if you're a bear out there and if you're a bull, I know they need to continue to"
"7970520","7973260"," tighten because of the rate of inflation, right?"
"7974600","7976480"," We're not catching up to the rate of inflation."
"7976480","7977100"," I get that. "
"7977880","7981260"," But I want you to know that we're there."
"7982140","7983240"," We're there right now."
"7983780","7984720"," We are seeing. "
"7987400","7988340"," Cracks, right?"
"7988600","7989440"," We're seeing cracks."
"7990040","7995080"," As a matter of fact, to that point, Detroit's inflation numbers came out."
"7995600","7999080"," I think yesterday we're at 4.38, I think. "
"7999640","8001800"," So we're close to that 5% even here."
"8002720","8004920"," Now inflation rates around the country are starting to come out."
"8005400","8007700"," So there's like some things that are not inflation unemployment. "
"8008840","8014520"," So we're starting to see like the impact before they're hitting the economy."
"8015980","8024740"," We're seeing companies are at least I have friends that know CEOs of some decent sized companies"
"8024740","8028140"," that sit in rooms with them and these people know that it's happening."
"8029000","8033560"," So the economy is or that's working, not to where it should be, but it's working. "
"8035480","8037080"," Damage is being done."
"8038940","8040220"," Now, how do we know?"
"8041440","8042800"," If we get that, then this is funny."
"8043300","8046740"," Someone else asked me this that do you actually subscribe to the no landing?"
"8046880","8050540"," And I'm like, no, but I have to understand it at least or where they're coming from. "
"8050680","8051440"," This is a couple days ago."
"8051560","8052200"," It was Joe Donut."
"8052360","8054060"," No, Joe Donut was talking about a week ago. "
"8054760","8057020"," I think yesterday your wife's boyfriend and I were talking about it."
"8058140","8064460"," I was like, I don't subscribe to it, but you at least seem to understand the concept of it and"
"8064460","8065960"," where it's happened in the past."
"8065960","8069060"," And it has happened one time in the past. "
"8071080","8071940"," Is that possible?"
"8072480","8075040"," It is, but there's an easy way to see if it happens."
"8077020","8078680"," And it's basically that golden cross."
"8079640","8082020"," Basically that you can actually just chart it out. "
"8083720","8084600"," That path."
"8085080","8086400"," And as a matter of fact, I think I've seen a path."
"8086780","8087920"," I don't know who I saw that with. "
"8088760","8091760"," I don't know if it was Mike Silver might have had it."
"8093260","8099340"," I don't know who had it, but there's a chart out there showing and we'll chart it out for you"
"8099340","8100700"," today at some point."
"8101200","8110860"," If it doesn't happen during the cash market session at the end of the day at four p.m. We're"
"8110860","8117160"," going to look at it and you can kind of use this as a baseline for the no landing. "
"8118640","8124100"," It basically the idea behind it would be that we trade above roughly four twenty."
"8124960","8126160"," Well four hundred."
"8127300","8131540"," Then hit like four thirty or something and then come back down and retest successfully. "
"8132480","8136380"," A successful retest of roughly it's somewhere between four thirty and four hundred."
"8136520","8137780"," We'll chart it out so you can see it."
"8138760","8141260"," Now if we trade that sideways and up still. "
"8142240","8143920"," And that's someone was talking about the weekly charts."
"8144220","8145260"," Yeah, that's a part of that too."
"8145420","8146920"," The weekly charts are definitely a part of that. "
"8146920","8150420"," The bulls are able to regain that and stay on that track."
"8150820","8153080"," You would see nineteen ninety eight play out."
"8155120","8158420"," Now key to know here is that all this macro stuff. "
"8159640","8163540"," Is going to point towards that move to the nineteen ninety eight stuff."
"8164100","8166560"," Or we stay below here on the weekly charts."
"8166580","8168140"," We start staying below this four hundred. "
"8170360","8172300"," You're you're sealing the deal this year."
"8174020","8177900"," On some kind of a low to be found in the market this more than likely this year."
"8179280","8181360"," Not twenty twenty four not twenty four twenty five. "
"8182260","8185780"," Unless if it comes early the scary part about this is if it comes early."
"8186740","8189080"," If you start to get that low like right now or this summer."
"8190080","8195500"," They could spell a recessionary shit for like two years forward down for a year to. "
"8196320","8202280"," The timing isn't right."
"8202280","8205580"," If we made that role in like December or even next year."
"8205760","8206620"," But if we're going to make it now. "
"8207740","8211740"," It could spell some some sideways some real rough action for the next couple years."
"8212959","8214200"," The timing isn't right."
"8219440","8221760"," We'll look at that and we're going to look at that today. "
"8221840","8225360"," We're going to look at that macro stuff that everybody talks about."
"8225639","8226680"," So you can see it."
"8227299","8231219"," And we're going to chart that out so you can actually anticipate if it's going to be like nineteen"
"8231219","8231780"," ninety eight. "
"8232299","8235860"," Or if it's going to be like here we're finding a low now fascinatingly enough with this."
"8238379","8242320"," The price targets on some of those lows are not as low as they once were."
"8245790","8248770"," So where we're looking for like fourteen we've got a big old bear playing here. "
"8250090","8253530"," Big beautiful bear playing coming on down to three ninety two fourteen hopefully."
"8254549","8256809"," Bears want to take this up bad boy down three."
"8256950","8258690"," Bears getting all buried up yet in the chat or not. "
"8264000","8267420"," Who's saying that right now saying silver made some good points."
"8268240","8268820"," Someone fine."
"8268980","8270020"," I'll go find silver. "
"8270400","8270940"," I don't think it was last."
"8271120","8271680"," I'm watching."
"8271940","8273080"," I think I watched his last night. "
"8273219","8274520"," But I don't think I watched him."
"8274980","8275879"," I hadn't watched him in a while."
"8276059","8278400"," And I think I watched him like a three or four nights ago. "
"8278680","8279459"," Could have been somebody else."
"8280400","8284320"," But it shows that no landing path and what that no landing path is."
"8285120","8286299"," And we can chart it out. "
"8287120","8288299"," It's pretty easy to see."
"8288420","8290020"," It's just this like cross in the market."
"8290719","8293959"," As long as you train above a certain number and retest it and keep going higher. "
"8294700","8296520"," You know we're heading into a nineteen ninety eight."
"8296680","8296719"," So."
"8299260","8299660"," Environment. "
"8300340","8303379"," If we try to keep below a certain number and the similar stuff with the weekly."
"8303620","8304740"," That's a key part of this."
"8306379","8307580"," You'll see that we actually. "
"8308400","8311320"," We're actually in a place where you need to put on in regardless."
"8311799","8313860"," This is a fascinating part with the put back spread."
"8315299","8317080"," It deals with both scenarios. "
"8318760","8322719"," It actually deals with the grind higher the nineteen ninety eight style."
"8322740","8323620"," It actually pays you."
"8324120","8324780"," For the trade. "
"8324820","8327420"," It's a risk in that in that scenario of going up."
"8327540","8331160"," It's risk free in the scenario we roll down in the next six twelve months."
"8331660","8333000"," It's going to pay big money. "
"8336120","8338540"," So we need to put a trade on for that."
"8338820","8339700"," For both scenarios."
"8340100","8343840"," We can't have like just I am just just fucking long and a triple leveraged. "
"8344000","8345879"," Dow Jones burn to the ground."
"8345879","8347260"," We need to have something that's tactical."
"8347959","8349760"," Something that deals with both scenarios. "
"8350760","8354559"," It's something that we can put on and be feel confident and safe in this market."
"8355540","8356860"," Whether you're a bull or a bear."
"8357540","8358260"," It doesn't matter. "
"8358879","8361340"," Both of those doors are open right now to the market."
"8362360","8364100"," The upside is the least likely."
"8365160","8370440"," The least likely scenario would be which is the only open door that a lot of people smart people"
"8370440","8370900"," can see. "
"8371719","8373900"," That up trade that least likely trade."
"8376459","8378420"," You can still hedge the market."
"8379900","8383459"," Risk free and trade the market up as it goes. "
"8383459","8387100"," As long as it saves above a certain number of retests we can trade the market up and be safe."
"8390940","8392320"," So that's what we'll be looking for."
"8392420","8396200"," We're looking for a way to hedge the market. "
"8398240","8399920"," We're all looking at each other a few weeks ago."
"8400060","8401240"," We're like yeah, we're at 420."
"8401700","8402380"," Are we going up from here?"
"8402780","8403440"," Probably fucking not. "
"8404020","8404580"," Right?"
"8404920","8406180"," That was pretty easy to see."
"8406340","8407220"," We're at 420."
"8407560","8409200"," Are we going to 460 at this moment?"
"8409400","8410100"," Probably not. "
"8412570","8414550"," Now where we are with the banks."
"8414890","8417330"," Where we are with the macro news."
"8418390","8419810"," Or like the fund funds rate. "
"8420030","8420750"," The unemployment rate."
"8420970","8422070"," The inflation coming down."
"8422410","8424450"," You know coming down quote air quotes. "
"8425730","8427610"," Rate hikes are all this stuff."
"8427850","8429350"," Cracks in the system being seen."
"8431930","8434470"," It does put the does now raise that question. "
"8434510","8434930"," We have."
"8435450","8441230"," The data now to say okay, let's take a look at this and see how you how we position."
"8442870","8444030"," For the rest of the year. "
"8451330","8457350"," It's a it's a put back spreads are ratio spread one to two two to one."
"8457470","8465190"," Everyone to say it."
"8465190","8465790"," The money that you bought. "
"8483480","8486080"," Yeah, I know where the move index is as well."
"8486200","8488200"," The move index isn't looking pretty either."
"8488400","8488420"," Right?"
"8488520","8489400"," That's kind of sealed in the deal. "
"8489520","8491540"," The five and 10 or the five and 10s are as well."
"8492240","8493540"," Kind of sealed in the deal there."
"8500140","8501000"," I'm being asked. "
"8502000","8506020"," How do you determine the price target one, two and three."
"8507140","8508020"," Let's start there."
"8508360","8508940"," Price targets. "
"8509420","8510720"," I'm trying to look for."
"8512380","8516440"," Places of volatility in the market where we had sellers in previous days on highs."
"8516440","8517340"," Same on lows. "
"8518080","8522580"," Where was their minor or minor support or or or supplier demand."
"8524680","8528400"," So you're going to hit these targets until you hit real real supply."
"8528580","8531860"," So we know right now in the market that real supply is at three ninety eight. "
"8533160","8538020"," You know, that's where the real sellers are real sellers are sitting at three ninety eight"
"8538020","8538020"," guaranteed."
"8539360","8542260"," That's where the real unless we have hidden sellers in the market."
"8542260","8542820"," All that kind of stuff. "
"8542980","8545580"," But that's where real supply is three ninety eight right now."
"8548220","8551000"," We got previous pivot points as well."
"8551160","8551700"," Kind of to this. "
"8553600","8555740"," How weak and strong unless there's something we don't see."
"8557960","8558780"," Sometimes you don't know."
"8558920","8559600"," Sometimes it comes down. "
"8559800","8560160"," You don't know."
"8562880","8565680"," Then interchange strike boxes located on your chart."
"8566480","8571800"," These are not EMA's but I but on this chart this we will try to can't put. "
"8572880","8574760"," Can't I can't put these lines on here."
"8574880","8578360"," So every day I have to adjust them to match up to."
"8580440","8580920"," EMA's. "
"8581740","8585540"," We have a tool that's launching so you can see it and use it."
"8586800","8590640"," And if you need so you can see where where all these places are."
"8592580","8595040"," Then we look at velocity as well in the trade. "
"8602800","8603960"," Good question Jason."
"8612100","8614720"," When do I see for possibly getting revisited."
"8615440","8619180"," You know fucking Friday man should have fucking happened on Friday. "
"8619580","8621540"," And then I was like worst case Monday no big deal."
"8622260","8624020"," We got all this volatility in the market."
"8624680","8628580"," We got you know shit posters VC shit posters. "
"8630260","8631420"," Pulling a hissy fit."
"8633040","8634600"," You've got contagion."
"8636900","8641000"," People trying to make runs on banks all this other fucking shit and cyber swearing but. "
"8642020","8643900"," And you can't put that cap back in that."
"8644700","8647840"," When you pull that cat out of the bag you ain't putting it back in that easy."
"8648720","8650040"," And they're trying to put it back in today. "
"8650420","8651900"," I was reading the news today and they're trying."
"8653220","8655620"," It's funny because you're like oh look at them they're trying to."
"8656100","8658020"," I was like reading the news this morning and I'm like. "
"8658020","8662440"," They're already trying to gloss over the banks like look nothing nothing to see here."
"8665260","8669840"," I think this is hilarious when the cats not going back in the bag."
"8673360","8676600"," Everything I said everything like some of us reading last night and today I'm like. "
"8679990","8682190"," Bizarre like but just bizarre stuff so."
"8684050","8685570"," The cats not going back in the bag."
"8689880","8690600"," But 400. "
"8692820","8697480"," Outside of that we I think we should see it unless something we don't know happens."
"8698520","8699680"," It should happen this week."
"8701900","8703120"," You should see it this week. "
"8704440","8706600"," I'd like to see it I want to I want to show it out there."
"8707200","8721310"," Not sure but I want to put a hedge in the market at 400 if I"
"8721310","8721310"," can."
"8723750","8726410"," So I need to get back into a hedge for this market. "
"8736520","8739740"," I'd like to actually see that you know what be you know what be kind to be honest."
"8741600","8747320"," I'd really like to see like 50 or 100 like just slam it if you know you're not going to"
"8747320","8748300"," be able to do it."
"8748320","8750080"," They already know they're not going to be able to do it. "
"8750680","8753940"," You know like that when you see the news talking about the balance between fighting inflation."
"8754920","8758720"," And not creating a crisis that's real."
"8760280","8763940"," So I'd really like to see that I'd really like to see if any time there was a time that"
"8763940","8764980"," I'd like to see 50 BPS. "
"8765700","8767840"," Right fucking now into March honestly."
"8769160","8770540"," I'd really like to see it."
"8771700","8776560"," I'd really like to see like one last 50 like there's one time this this actual fed meeting. "
"8777360","8779300"," I'd really like to see it because it's not going to matter."
"8779780","8782260"," It's not going to matter if it's zero it's not going to matter if they pause."
"8782900","8786520"," It's not going to matter if it's 25 just just do it one time. "
"8787520","8789240"," If there was one time to do it."
"8789980","8792800"," This is the time this March meeting is the time to do it."
"8795520","8800460"," I think I think if they honestly if they say anything like 25 BPS. "
"8801340","8804000"," And we're considering doing more at the next meeting."
"8804520","8808020"," I think I think there is I think the destruction is in place at that point."
"8808760","8810200"," I think that this the deal is sealed. "
"8811240","8815160"," I think they know that I think that they think they know that it's probably the last if there's a"
"8815160","8815480"," rate hike."
"8815500","8816460"," This is the last one."
"8817320","8819600"," No matter what anyone else out there saying right now. "
"8821620","8822640"," This is the last one."
"8822740","8823640"," It's either going to be a pause."
"8824560","8828540"," I hope to hope the fuck it's not a a cutting rates. "
"8829460","8831960"," Like it's either pause 25 or 50."
"8832760","8836720"," I'm hoping they do 50 because I don't think they get another chance to do to do."
"8836880","8841620"," I think I don't think they can do three or four 25 BPS hikes. "
"8841620","8844820"," I don't think they can I don't think they can pause it or I think they can pause it."
"8846380","8847500"," Let's say a pause it right."
"8848180","8852140"," They're going to stop the destruction but at the same time they're going to fight inflation. "
"8853300","8858160"," So I'm trying to figure out a way in my head to be like least trying to catch up to"
"8858160","8858460"," inflation."
"8858760","8860640"," Hopefully the rest of the destruction is done."
"8861820","8863100"," So you do the 50 BPS. "
"8864160","8865440"," You say that's the last one."
"8867160","8867840"," That's my hope."
"8876520","8877240"," Yeah, they broke. "
"8877440","8878120"," We know they broke."
"8878260","8879240"," I think that they broke it."
"8879240","8882440"," I think that they know that they've broken it, but the inflation is still there. "
"8884700","8888400"," You know, if you break it and don't have the inflation down, you really haven't done your fucking"
"8888400","8889060"," job, right?"
"8889240","8890460"," We're going to go right the fuck back up."
"8890660","8894760"," So I'm praying for 50."
"8895140","8900360"," Be honest with you, as of like this morning, I'm praying for 50 BPS. "
"8900980","8902360"," I think it would be welcomed by everybody."
"8903500","8907560"," Then you just you just say we'll we'll discuss the next meeting when we get there."
"8907980","8909340"," Leave it simple like that. "
"8909880","8911320"," You start the path of destruction."
"8912600","8913620"," You panic everybody."
"8914120","8915040"," Everybody freaks out. "
"8917360","8921560"," I don't think the I used to be up and I'm going to say up into this meeting as well."
"8922180","8928220"," I used to say to people if they raise rates 25 BPS, this market's going to slingshot back up and"
"8928220","8928480"," it did."
"8929100","8930420"," I don't think that holds true anymore. "
"8930660","8934580"," I don't think that I don't think this meeting is that's I don't think this meeting is the same"
"8934580","8935640"," meeting that's been in the past."
"8942180","8945920"," I don't think the same I don't think the same I don't think this is the same meeting anymore."
"8945920","8946780"," I don't think that. "
"8947120","8953540"," I don't think that that the bad news is good news is going to apply to this meeting."
"8956860","8958180"," I think the writing is on the wall."
"8958300","8960420"," I think everybody knows the writing is on the wall at this point. "
"8966560","8968660"," Just grinding and consolidating right now in the spot."
"8979780","8982180"," Well, though the market's so got to be crazy."
"8982180","8984260"," I think that market will shoot up when rates are increased. "
"8984420","8985800"," It actually has though."
"8987580","8993660"," If we whenever we had a rate hike, so what happens is like idea is the simplified version is if"
"8993660","8995300"," the market believes the fettest fighting inflation."
"8996060","8998020"," The market will go up sideways and I believe it or not. "
"8998700","8999160"," And it did."
"8999560","9000040"," It went sideways."
"9000340","9000980"," It went sideways. "
"9000980","9005680"," It was up since June because they're raising rates incrementally trying to fight inflation."
"9006620","9012620"," Demand destruction kind of trading us sideways and down slowly over time so that some stuff could"
"9012620","9015420"," catch up to us believe or not to make that soft landing."
"9016280","9018480"," Velocity in the market to actually catch up to us. "
"9019440","9024180"," It's like it's like we're having like a controlled crash even though the price is the same when you"
"9024180","9024940"," trade the market sideways."
"9026260","9033320"," Now with that said inflation hasn't come down so they so this meeting is going to be important."
"9033520","9035140"," This meeting is where we switch from. "
"9035600","9040300"," You'll notice when they raised 25 BPS we sell off and that fucking dip is bought right back up"
"9040300","9040520"," again."
"9040900","9042260"," I don't think that's the case anymore."
"9042260","9047500"," And I think that's where the real risk in the market is to even today like just sitting here today"
"9047500","9048640"," with you guys in the market. "
"9049380","9050960"," There's risk of front running this."
"9051720","9057480"," The open this morning risk of front running this the volatility yesterday in the market danger and"
"9057480","9057640"," risk."
"9057820","9059340"," You see all the puts on the market. "
"9059340","9060720"," You see the V VIX going up."
"9060980","9067920"," People are hedging right now in the background for this for the for the implication that if we woke"
"9067920","9069380"," up tomorrow we were down 10%."
"9069380","9071260"," Wouldn't be shocked at all. "
"9072620","9074540"," And you see the hedging that's going on the market."
"9074680","9075940"," They don't even care what the price is."
"9076240","9078640"," They're like fuck 400 I'm fucking hedging right now. "
"9080060","9083800"," Because they know that it's going to get front run or the implication that's going to get front"
"9083800","9084040"," run."
"9085440","9087140"," And that this meeting is not going to matter."
"9088020","9094140"," So I hope that they do it hopefully just put the 50 BPS on start the process and you know"
"9094140","9095820"," rip the fucking bandaid off at some point. "
"9107220","9111800"," Yeah, no, you know that's the problem that I got Fernando is that one of the problems I got right"
"9111800","9120820"," now is like you're like looking at this and you're like what is he going to do raise rates 25"
"9120820","9123180"," BPS for the next three years four years."
"9124000","9125780"," This is not making sense to me."
"9126880","9132100"," I think you're as a matter of fact if you're a collapsed bear if you're like hey I want collapse"
"9132100","9135640"," I want like I want the stock market to do a long term debt cycle reset. "
"9136820","9139480"," You want 25 BPS every fucking meeting."
"9139960","9140780"," That's how you'll get it."
"9142100","9146300"," If they just keep tightening and tightening and tightening like that it's going to destroy shit. "
"9151420","9153240"," You do that for like three four years man."
"9153480","9155060"," It'll it'll be brutal."
"9163510","9167430"," What do I think about the London boys will do before the close the 12 30 Eastern time. "
"9169610","9173810"," No, no now retesting down low here add or change strike right taking a look at this."
"9173890","9175530"," Let's look around the market and see what's going on."
"9176670","9177650"," Let's do the five minute. "
"9179030","9180470"," You have another box lower here."
"9182370","9187110"," Do we get the question here is do we get down to three eighty nine right."
"9188350","9192290"," Do we get down there it's a big question here right three we get down to three eighty nine thirty"
"9192290","9192610"," one. "
"9195250","9198230"," Or do we stay here at this three ninety two eleven."
"9198410","9200370"," That's a big question right we have resistance above."
"9200870","9204150"," So we're going to look around the market and see now. "
"9205890","9207530"," Three eighty nine forty five."
"9207530","9208370"," It's right here."
"9208530","9210630"," This is where the hourly trigger is down here. "
"9212230","9216050"," So this trigger right here down here at three ninety or three eighty nine fifty."
"9216290","9217090"," It's fifty two actually."
"9218330","9221030"," If you get some kind of a trade like this where you go down. "
"9222310","9227390"," You're going to need it'll take time to consolidate for the one in five minutes to come underneath."
"9228110","9231790"," And lend a three trigger support to make that trip higher."
"9233830","9238970"," And so I'm watching this right now in the spy in the background price is currently trading below"
"9238970","9239970"," the one in five minute. "
"9240430","9245570"," So as a bull that's bearish okay we're bearish here is a bull right now."
"9247330","9250570"," We're not we're not taking a position long here at this point."
"9251250","9253610"," And I'm going to bring a chart up for you to look at to see this. "
"9254490","9255650"," Throw the VIX real quick."
"9256890","9258810"," And we're seeing some support on the VIX."
"9259750","9262090"," Let me bring this over for you so we can take a look at it together. "
"9263850","9265370"," Is there a trade for a bull here?"
"9265550","9265670"," No."
"9267670","9269130"," No trade for a bull here yet."
"9273500","9274880"," Okay so we're in the VIX. "
"9276760","9281060"," You can see some support right now for the VIX right VIX found some support."
"9281920","9283440"," It's got a five minute trigger above here."
"9284200","9285860"," What do bulls want to see?"
"9287920","9290560"," Bulls want to see one here. "
"9294160","9295060"," I'm missing here."
"9295400","9299310"," I don't know where the box is anymore."
"9300630","9301850"," I'm missing my box. "
"9302410","9303710"," Alright whatever we'll do without the box."
"9305030","9306470"," I'm missing a box is here."
"9307750","9308730"," There it is right there. "
"9311010","9312970"," So this is what bulls are looking for here."
"9313190","9315190"," Our worst case worst case scenario."
"9317130","9318750"," Bull's best friend is up here. "
"9319990","9324950"," $24.79, $24.50 or $25 is a bull's best friend."
"9325290","9328550"," This hourly support is going to lend the best trade for the bulls."
"9329190","9333170"," Now with that said, there's a couple more boxes for bulls to pay attention to. "
"9335030","9336610"," And that's a reversal right here."
"9337590","9338630"," And another one just above."
"9339030","9342670"," The best one for bulls is likely up here at 25 bucks. "
"9343330","9347430"," Best trade for bulls is that we VIX rises 25 rejects."
"9348390","9350650"," Comes back down and slams down into this $21."
"9351690","9353510"," So we can get a reversal here before. "
"9354990","9356350"," That's the best trade for bulls."
"9356530","9357610"," The safest trade for bulls."
"9357810","9360270"," This is the consolidation spy on the downside. "
"9361430","9363190"," So this scenario right here."
"9366050","9370050"," That scenario right here is the trade down here."
"9370610","9372190"," Now I bring the VIX to 25. "
"9373250","9378910"," You consolidate here and then get your trade higher on the spy."
"9379930","9390210"," Now with all that said, this"
"9390210","9392090"," is the same trade here on the spy, right?"
"9395530","9398110"," And that would be that we come break through here, come down here."
"9398890","9399870"," One in five minute, come underneath. "
"9400950","9402070"," We get this beautiful trade higher."
"9402450","9404850"," Now with all that said, I want you to see something else here."
"9406530","9412810"," We traded right off on the 14th, right?"
"9413470","9415730"," And just slammed higher in this red line right here. "
"9415810","9416610"," This is the five minute."
"9417270","9418370"," And you can see."
"9420630","9427050"," You can see right now price came back down to the five minute and it's held. "
"9428210","9429730"," So can you take this trade right here?"
"9429810","9434410"," No, but what you can do is take the trade above the one minute."
"9435370","9439170"," Okay, so price gets above the one minute on the spy."
"9440210","9441690"," You can actually take that trade. "
"9442690","9447150"," So that price right now is that 392, 80 and change on the one minute chart."
"9447650","9450990"," So we don't know right now, right?"
"9451150","9452790"," Just showing you the VIX is like, ah, we don't know."
"9454030","9458150"," So on a one minute chart on the VIX, you can see it. "
"9460880","9465620"," So right here, price is now trading 392, 49."
"9465620","9467960"," So what you need to see here is this."
"9468120","9469160"," I'm going to show it to you real quick. "
"9469880","9471240"," I'm going to show you the safe trade."
"9472120","9473200"," Here's the safe trade."
"9473300","9473500"," Okay. "
"9473960","9475160"," Take a snapshot of this."
"9476740","9478260"," So the safe trade here."
"9484980","9485700"," Hold on here. "
"9485760","9486180"," I get this wrong."
"9504570","9508190"," The safe trade here right now is priced to come up."
"9509290","9510230"," Over the one minute. "
"9512890","9513730"," Pull back."
"9517550","9518430"," Retest successfully."
"9519690","9521250"," And then start to head higher. "
"9524050","9526630"," So right in here, you want to see that retest."
"9528210","9530550"," You want to see confirmation that the move is higher."
"9531370","9535590"," You don't want to see a lower low here or lower high here because what happens with price is if"
"9535590","9536830"," you see this, we break through. "
"9538310","9540030"," That's where you get trapped right in here."
"9540810","9543130"," So you need to see this retest here."
"9543730","9545530"," Now there might be little one minute trades there. "
"9545650","9547010"," You can take one five minute trades."
"9547030","9547550"," You can take."
"9548250","9551150"," But for the safety for bulls, it's somewhere in here. "
"9554370","9556990"," And on a five minute chart, how you can see that right here."
"9558330","9562230"," As you'll see this retest here and you'll see it just like this."
"9562250","9563130"," You'll see like a move higher. "
"9564190","9566230"," And it'll start to continue higher here."
"9566610","9570090"," The one minute will come right back up again and restart one more time."
"9570830","9572910"," This retest is the key for bulls right here. "
"9574170","9574750"," Successful hold."
"9574750","9576610"," You don't take the trade until you come off of it."
"9577530","9577890"," Okay. "
"9578710","9580630"," So right now we're going to watch that one minute chart."
"9583070","9586690"," You want to see price come above the one minute, which we're seeing."
"9588470","9598350"," You want to see a retest of the one minute and the red line here, the five minute continue higher. "
"9599350","9605790"," And that'll show you if we're going to get the for only getting for only getting 395 or if we're"
"9605790","9606090"," going to get."
"9609010","9610030"," The rule over."
"9617110","9617830"," It's right here. "
"9617870","9619070"," We're going to watch this play out right now."
"9620230","9622450"," Still no safe trade here, believe it or not."
"9625310","9626750"," You don't want to get reversal here. "
"9627730","9628910"," You're going to reversal here."
"9628970","9629490"," You know what happens."
"9630690","9632830"," Price reverses here and comes down. "
"9633630","9635090"," You'll see the cross."
"9636310","9637850"," You'll see the bearish cross right here."
"9639670","9644090"," And you'll see a violent move with that white line and that white line will come right down right"
"9644090","9644250"," here. "
"9644330","9645670"," And that's where you get trapped right in there."
"9650520","9651800"," You're going to hang out right here."
"9652980","9655000"," Hang out and just watch out how it unfolds. "
"9655700","9656900"," Let someone else put the risk on."
"9673060","9676380"," So that the safe trade here, price is now above the one minute, right?"
"9676820","9684180"," The safe trade for you is to wait for a rip and a retest that holds."
"9685120","9686860"," If you don't see that, there's no trade here. "
"9686980","9690060"," You want to see the rip higher, the retest of the one minute."
"9691760","9693800"," Successful of your finger on the buy button."
"9693940","9696760"," And if it trades higher, price trades higher, you can take that trade. "
"9708520","9712600"," You kind of need to see a reverse here just so you can see how the reversal actually happens."
"9713500","9714180"," Like the bearish reversal."
"9715160","9717840"," I'd like to actually see a reverse just as a teaching lesson. "
"9718740","9720160"," Or at least not teaching, but just risk."
"9720960","9722540"," Now, some people will take this trade right now."
"9722920","9725260"," Some people are like, I'm going to fucking take some calls here. "
"9725580","9726360"," Fuck you, I'm out of here."
"9727340","9728060"," I've done that."
"9728460","9731940"," Like put risk on and say I know we're going up here and you didn't get cut up. "
"9734020","9735220"," You'll see people take this trade."
"9735420","9737220"," This is some of the complaints in the stream we've had."
"9737600","9740300"," People take this trade, they're getting cut up, then we go up. "
"9741280","9742720"," And they're like, I'm just getting cut up on both sides."
"9742720","9748620"," So if you want the trade where it's safe or not you, we're going to start showing that instead of"
"9748620","9749120"," the safe trade."
"9750020","9750640"," That's what we'll do. "
"9767910","9769730"," I'm going to go over some news real quick with you."
"9769910","9771030"," Just refresh some news here."
"9772930","9774430"," Then I'm going to actually read something to you. "
"9774470","9776090"," I've got your wife's boyfriend sent me something."
"9776270","9777310"," So I'm going to read whatever he sent."
"9777510","9779390"," He sent some good stuff to me now inside stream. "
"9780390","9781590"," So shout out to your wife's boyfriend."

"10655410","10659000"," Let's look at AMC. "
"10670620","10672080"," I think we already charted this one out."
"10676330","10677150"," Looks like we did."
"10677490","10683190"," We must have talked about AMC last time and, uh, almost a pin strike down to 472. "

"10711000","10714120"," Just pinged it right down, uh, nailed 472."
"10714700","10716520"," Very bearish right now on, uh, AMC."

"10736740","10740760"," This tee off right here on the 9th of March told you the same thing. "
"10743140","10745920"," And velocity is horrible right now on AMC."
"10746280","10747120"," It's gross."
"10747800","10748900"," You can actually see it right here. "
"10750000","10752700"," This is showing you how velocity is terrible on AMC."
"10753580","10755460"," Anybody have any news on why that is?"
"10755600","10756620"," Are they assigning news to it?"
"10762750","10764710"," The CEO fucking over investors."
"10765510","10766190"," That's who it is. "
"10766810","10767670"," What does he own this at?"
"10767850","10768930"," Like $1.30 or something?"
"10769650","10770950"," He admitted that once, didn't he?"
"10773260","10776540"," I think he owns AMC and loans out of shares for $1.30. That's allegedly."
"10779650","10780770"," They approve the split."
"10783820","10785040"," You could see this though. "
"10785520","10787120"," You could see this all lining up."
"10787260","10787900"," They teed off here."
"10788060","10788840"," They teed off here. "
"10789960","10791760"," And the velocity was to the downside here."
"10791760","10794540"," I don't know if you can see this, but now you can actually see the velocity."
"10795900","10797180"," See it getting bearish here. "
"10797400","10798460"," See it getting bearish here."
"10798600","10799620"," See it getting bearish here."
"10800420","10804860"," If this yellow was up, if this was rolling, actually back here, this looks. "
"10805560","10807140"," Yeah, there was some kind of a trap in here."
"10809480","10813500"," Right here, there was a trap, but you kind of knew it once you got into here."
"10814120","10816340"," This was the sign right here of the collapse. "
"10819380","10820680"," So when was that?"
"10824510","10826990"," The sign of the collapse was..."
"10827710","10828230"," Hold on."
"10830910","10834190"," Today at $9.30, you ran the opening battle, you could tell."
"10836490","10837550"," That's a bad one. "
"10838610","10839130"," That's brutal."
"10840830","10842890"," And it's still..."
"10844590","10848950"," Yeah, previous lows here at $4.42. Oh, shit."
"10850010","10856790"," $3.81. Very dangerous stuff. "
"10856950","10857850"," You get a squeeze higher."
"10859550","10869530"," You could get a squeeze higher back to $5.06 or something, $5.05. But it's going to tee"
"10869530","10869950"," right off."
"10870130","10872470"," There's a couple levels for you if you're an AMC person. "
"10874950","10882570"," $5.02. $5.15. $5.50. $5.39, but I don't know that it goes there."
"10888480","10890980"," This is very destructive here, just so you know."
"10892420","10895120"," There's probably no squeeze here until velocity slows. "
"10897380","10899580"," And velocity's ramping right now to the downside on AMC."
"10904900","10905680"," All right."
"10906800","10908980"," Still dicking around on Spy right now. "
"10909780","10911080"," Is there a trade on Spy?"
"10911320","10913600"," You tell me I want to know if you think there's a trade on Spy here."
"10915880","10917760"," No trade still yet for me on Spy."
"10920190","10923010"," I want to see Spy trade higher than the white line. "
"10923270","10924470"," Come back down and retest it."
"10929720","10931060"," Still no trade for me on Spy."
"10939990","10941330"," Let me look at the VIX real quick. "
"10941910","10942570"," AMC gang."
"10944270","10945190"," Crushing death blow."
"10945330","10949030"," Are we seeing any other action in any like BBY or..."
"10957450","10959670"," Is BBY taking a hit off that?"
"10960130","10960890"," Yeah, a little bit, huh?"
"10962030","10963910"," Yeah, they take the same hit on that. "
"10966710","10968510"," BBY looking pretty bearish right now."
"10968650","10970670"," GME gang, what are you guys doing out there?"
"10971750","10972990"," Damn, this makes me..."
"10972990","10981070"," This makes me wonder if Abe sold out of the meme stocks and now we've got meme bank stocks."
"10982730","10984770"," They're all long in the meme bank stocks. "
"10985270","10987170"," Stocks now with the old fucking boomers."
"10989430","10991990"," I made a post about that on Fencement last night."
"10998710","10999490"," This is good. "
"10999590","11000370"," I like this right here."
"11000550","11001210"," This is bullish."
"11001550","11002350"," Hold on a second here. "
"11003670","11005590"," I got to switch back over to Spy here."
"11005730","11007410"," That's a good looking trade right there."
"11013800","11015260"," That's a juicy one right there. "
"11016520","11017580"," I like that trade."
"11029820","11030900"," I've got set up 394."
"11034020","11034460"," 384C. "
"11035180","11038180"," And so what I want to see is a nice little squeeze higher."
"11038980","11042340"," I want to see a little test right there and take this thing and run this thing higher."
"11042500","11043680"," That's a nice trade right there. "
"11044700","11046780"," Let me look at the VIX real quick."
"11053980","11055880"," We're bullish on Spy right now."
"11057880","11058840"," I'm going to watch this. "
"11059000","11059420"," See how this unfold?"
"11068460","11069900"," I'm bullish on the Spy right here."
"11087620","11089300"," I'm watching VIX in the background here."
"11099090","11100190"," There's your PT above. "
"11105620","11107300"," PT failure, here's your R2."
"11108180","11111460"," R2, here's 39551."
"11113100","11113940"," Right there. "
"11139600","11141440"," Looking at 394Cs."
"11141940","11142380"," I haven't bought them yet."
"11142540","11145360"," I want to see like a rip and a retest and for it to hold. "
"11147400","11148140"," Let's see a rip."
"11149000","11151600"," Retest, catch up, and then hold."
"11153400","11155000"," It buys somewhere in there. "
"11157320","11157940"," Oh man."
"11158420","11162020"," So this right here is like where I get caught in bad trades."
"11162300","11166740"," I'm like, this is where I'm like, I just jumped the gun. "
"11167140","11167880"," I'll be honest with you."
"11167960","11171940"," Like right now, my brain is like, buy that right now."
"11175580","11178040"," Just throw shit tickets at it right now. "
"11191790","11193350"," Yeah, we're not going to take this trade though."
"11193450","11195150"," We're going to do this the safe way."
"11195150","11196290"," We're going to make sure. "
"11196630","11199050"," We're going to make sure that we're not catching people."
"11203110","11204650"," You bought shit tickets already?"
"11205030","11205870"," No man."
"11206070","11206710"," Let's play out. "
"11217540","11218700"," Hold on here."
"11226900","11229420"," You guys want that face rubber, don't you?"
"11235960","11238680"," Yeah, trying to stop you out of your trade right now."
"11258280","11261980"," Carlos saying that did I got torched on some that so Netflix put me. "
"11264120","11264760"," Netflix."
"11265840","11268940"," That's what made me have a red week that train specifically."
"11279940","11284660"," Someone saying AMC news AMC shareholders have approved the company's proposal. "
"11285020","11287420"," To convert AMC preferred equity."
"11288040","11291180"," They put it into shares of common stock per market watch."
"11291280","11292840"," Did we already know about this happening or something?"
"11293380","11298960"," Wasn't this like something where all the holders were hedge funds on that approval?"
"11299020","11300320"," You guys already knew that, right?"
"11300600","11301540"," We talked about that maybe. "
"11303700","11307420"," That the hedge funds actually hold all these shares to make votes or something like that, or I"
"11307420","11308940"," think the CEO and the hedge funds do."
"11309760","11313380"," I could be mixing this up, but don't hold me to what I'm saying right now."
"11313380","11318960"," Someone told me that it would be approved due to who actually owns the shares. "
"11320640","11322360"," And that hedge funds do was happening."
"11323400","11326160"," There was a guaranteed lower trade in AMC over that."
"11327060","11330560"," I thought I talked about it in stream, but I'm not sure. "
"11343600","11344700"," I'll leave that trap it in here."
"11350640","11357100"," You let it try to trap us again."
"11357100","11358200"," Come on now. "
"11361740","11362540"," Another trap."
"11363980","11365340"," Stared stepping us down."
"11366600","11367620"," No love here. "
"11367780","11368580"," Let's look at the five minutes."
"11368640","11370100"," Five minutes coming very bearish here."
"11371120","11373020"," There actually is a trade here for bears. "
"11373440","11378520"," On the five minute chart, we are getting across right now and we have prices below the one minute."
"11379020","11382020"," Price target below 389.61 if they can hold this."
"11383580","11385560"," Big part of this trade is coming up right now. "
"11387800","11389780"," Here comes that cross right now again."
"11392160","11396140"," If I take some puts in here now, finally, whether we're going to get some fucking action to the"
"11396140","11396840"," downside here."
"11399760","11400800"," No, my God. "
"11400980","11403400"," Let's talk about this stuff right here."
"11403460","11404660"," If I was a bear, I'd be pissed."
"11406800","11408440"," This kind of action right here sucks. "
"11408700","11411560"," You're going to stay and put since 31139."
"11413040","11415100"," Got an hour of no real movements."
"11415100","11416420"," Like you want blood here. "
"11418080","11420520"," You want like straight bloodbath down here."
"11421540","11422600"," Make some money."
"11426120","11427420"," Got so much drama. "
"11435490","11436870"," Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."
"11437030","11438330"," Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen."
"11438530","11443630"," Welcome to Beer Theater, where we have to get emotional for the next hour. "
"11445070","11451010"," And slowly make our way down that one straight staircase down."
"11453550","11455850"," Dude, what are those star things?"
"11459220","11461300"," What are you guys doing in the chat here?"
"11462900","11467340"," Rejects generator gifted the sub tier one to chase winter, baby."
"11467600","11468480"," Thank you, Reggs generator. "
"11469720","11470900"," Cosinius has followed."
"11471340","11472740"," Late spread has followed."
"11474220","11475520"," Jason's super chatted earlier. "
"11475760","11476820"," I think we answered that for Jason."
"11479140","11480740"," Reggs generator hooking up chase."
"11481200","11482700"," Chase is always in here dropping. "
"11484180","11485740"," Jason, who else is doing that?"
"11486120","11489420"," Who else is doing that stream is?"
"11491700","11492620"," She's a moderator."
"11493520","11494900"," I figured his name right now."
"11494960","11496020"," I don't know why I'm having a bind block. "
"11496200","11496820"," Probably because I'm tired."
"11503130","11503870"," Come on, Cap."
"11504150","11504770"," Where the bull's at?"
"11508300","11509940"," I don't think you are too late to buy puts. "
"11510740","11514340"," The place to buy the move for puts here is one."
"11514680","11516840"," So the move for puts is not this trade right here."
"11517760","11519960"," The move for puts is like the bloodbath. "
"11520960","11524960"," If it shapes up, if it starts to still hasn't shown itself, believe it or not."
"11525680","11526460"," It's almost there."
"11526760","11527460"," You need the cross. "
"11528780","11532620"," I only mute something for you here so you can see it better."
"11533440","11533700"," I'm going to second."
"11533860","11534140"," I'll mute it. "
"11535480","11538020"," I think the get rid of that."
"11538020","11539280"," Yeah, there we go."
"11540600","11541840"," This is easier to see. "
"11545420","11549080"," If you're looking for the trade for the bears, it wasn't actually all this."
"11549460","11551560"," The trade for the bears is..."
"11553460","11554900"," See how they threw it down right there?"
"11555140","11556260"," They're throwing it down again?"
"11556900","11557600"," This is it right here."
"11557700","11558400"," This is the bear trade. "
"11560060","11561460"," This is the meat of the trade right there."
"11561900","11562660"," You get the rejection."
"11563500","11564620"," The white line comes right underneath. "
"11567060","11568320"," It's actually right now."
"11569080","11569920"," This is the bear trade."
"11582060","11583240"," Come on, baby. "
"11584460","11585380"," Bloodbath it for me."
"11587540","11588880"," Start bloodbath it."
"11589020","11589700"," Send it down. "
"11589940","11590780"," Make it rain blood."
"11592220","11592860"," Come on."
"11601660","11603200"," Come on bears. "
"11608720","11610020"," Come on bears."
"11610400","11611240"," Get down to 390."
"11614140","11614920"," Give him some money. "
"11620500","11621920"," These fucking bears."
"11623820","11624680"," South 392."
"11638910","11640890"," Come on bears, you can do it. "
"11640990","11641490"," Put it together."
"11642150","11642550"," Go bears!"
"11649150","11651550"," Does that sound like dickhead all?"
"11652010","11652710"," Go bears!"
"11659640","11661380"," Come on bears, you can do it."
"11661380","11664440"," Put it back into it bears. "
"11671940","11672980"," Do bears."
"11675220","11676300"," Come on bears."
"11676900","11677740"," Don't do it. "
"11677820","11679160"," Don't do it like that bears."
"11681400","11682620"," You got a cell three."
"11682760","11683940"," You got a cell 392. "
"11684440","11685420"," Come on bears."
"11706720","11708200"," Oh, come on bears."
"11708480","11709900"," You got this dude. "
"11710040","11712560"," You got red white price under."
"11712780","11714600"," This is like the setup right here."
"11715280","11716000"," Cell 392. "
"11719280","11720580"," Just cell 392."
"11721660","11722980"," It's let all hang out."
"11728040","11729920"," This is the bear setup right here. "
"11730140","11732280"," You can see it's a beautiful, nice cross of the white line."
"11733780","11734920"," Red lines above."
"11735800","11736960"," Price is right below. "
"11743220","11745100"," You got Vix failing right here."
"11745220","11746260"," Not a good look for the bears."
"11747800","11751980"," Oh dude, bears are going to get stopped and squeezed out right now. "
"11753440","11755380"," Gonna get squeezed the fuck out right now."
"11762340","11764880"," Dude, this action is so terrible in here."
"11765540","11767820"," This is going to be some of the worst action right here. "
"11767820","11768800"," This is going to be ripping."
"11769480","11772540"," What is the put worth that was bought up here?"
"11772660","11773500"," Probably not too much."
"11775520","11777800"," What is the call worth in here destroyed, gone?"
"11778760","11779220"," Look at this. "
"11779240","11782160"," This action right here is just gross."
"11784040","11785800"," You can't even buy a put spread in here."
"11786640","11787340"," It's nasty. "
"11788960","11789360"," Oh."
"11791720","11792120"," Yucky."
"11793960","11794680"," Now 1249. "
"11794940","11796280"," Bears have got 11 minutes left."
"11796640","11798480"," Well, not even have 11 minutes left."
"11800280","11801420"," They got a new low here. "
"11801560","11802320"," They got a new low here."
"11802420","11803200"," They got a new low here."
"11803400","11807440"," They got a new low on 1138. "
"11810240","11810780"," Tag it."
"11810920","11811860"," They got the new low here."
"11817870","11818870"," Dude, this is gross. "
"11821930","11823210"," It's almost bourbon time."
"11827130","11828310"," This action is gross."
"11854640","11855700"," Fucking bears, man. "
"11855940","11856920"," What are you doing, bears?"
"11861960","11863760"," Please give me this retest over here."
"11863940","11864380"," Come on, bulls."
"11865520","11866280"," Come on, bulls. "
"11866540","11867680"," Show me your retest in the one minute."
"11867820","11868760"," So I can take a long, please."
"11869040","11870060"," We take a call here, brother. "
"11870560","11872540"," Give me a long call."
"11872540","11873180"," Oh, dude."
"11873620","11874260"," Fucking bears. "
"11875680","11877400"," God damn bears."
"11883730","11885090"," Fucking drama, dude."
"11885630","11887330"," Welcome to the fucking bear show. "
"11887650","11889130"," Welcome to the brought bear drama show."
"11891350","11892990"," Bears like it's not over."
"11894030","11895610"," We're in the fourth quarter. "
"11896910","11898630"," It's only been three downs."
"11898850","11899710"," We're not kicking it."
"11900950","11902170"," We own this. "
"11902170","11903550"," I'm Mike Dica."
"11904810","11908010"," This is a corner bar in Chicago on this south side."
"11910690","11911930"," It's our ball. "
"11912170","11913130"," The pigskins ours."
"11921630","11927910"," Chicago, Chicago and Green Bay tied a three, three in the fourth on a snowy Sunday afternoon."
"11928510","11929670"," Nobody's in the stands. "
"11929670","11932430"," It's blowing four, fifth minus 50 right now."
"11932910","11934110"," And the game ain't over."
"11938410","11941350"," Back when football was football and nobody scored. "
"11945190","11947730"," With the AFC where defense mattered."
"11948130","11948590"," One game."
"11948950","11952690"," The U.S. military reefer joined, forcing the U.S. to bring it down over the Black Sea. "
"11956690","11962190"," This dream is sponsored by to the to get free daily points to Benachi and market."
"11962430","11965850"," By signing up to the tick.com."
"11966110","11971810"," D.V. Sigma is saying I visited the Amsterdam Stock Exchange on Friday as with Wall Street."
"11972210","11974610"," There's a bull sculpture, but no bear sculpture. "
"11974970","11976010"," It's basic discrimination."
"11982430","11984030"," Yeah, I'm watching the VIX right now."
"11987300","11988980"," I like the VIX being high right now. "
"11989080","11991000"," It's all the better shorted into the ground."
"11991900","11995520"," Price isn't following the VIX right now."
"11995680","12006540"," Oh, yeah. "
"12006700","12007500"," It's one of the only fans."
"12007820","12010200"," One of the only fans I can't stand are Green Bay fans."
"12010960","12012260"," Because I'm a New England fan. "
"12013200","12016580"," So they're like one step worse than doing."
"12017820","12018660"," I'll be honest."
"12020480","12025500"," I think when I was a kid, everybody was a Cowboys or San Francisco fan. "
"12025520","12026460"," I was a young person."
"12027880","12034100"," And I was like, why are all these people wearing San Francisco and 49ers and Cowboys girls?"
"12034560","12035600"," I was like, I don't know what those teams are."
"12036440","12038660"," Now I know how people feel about Patriots. "
"12038660","12042940"," And if you ever meet a Green Bay fan, they're ratted."
"12048530","12052050"," It's like the old Rocky Marciano conversation coming to America."
"12054490","12055610"," Greatest of all time. "
"12058550","12059650"," Fans own the team."
"12065310","12067290"," I don't think it's bad."
"12067490","12070890"," I think it's we get together and there's a Super Bowl or something with Green Bay and the Patriots. "
"12070890","12075770"," And it just becomes like arguments over who's got the best stats."
"12077690","12080770"," You know, he's not like, I used to not like."
"12082030","12086070"," I used to not have a lot of appreciation for Peyton Manning. "
"12087170","12089310"," And I have way of newfound respect for him."
"12093550","12094850"," Not his brother, though."
"12095230","12096310"," Not that guy from New York. "
"12096930","12099530"," But Peyton Manning, a lot of respect for that I didn't have before."
"12100230","12101190"," He held that team together."
"12106210","12108010"," Vikings fan hair, Green Bay sucks. "
"12111110","12112270"," Yeah, Philly, dude."
"12112870","12117470"," My father told me stories about Philly and I guess even New England, I guess all the East Coast"
"12117470","12117810"," teams."
"12118030","12119090"," My dad used to tell me that. "
"12120310","12124430"," People used to throw like batteries and shit, like D cell batteries at players."
"12124970","12127090"," And players would like beat each other up real gnarly."
"12127590","12129190"," Grab each other's balls and stuff. "
"12129530","12133190"," I guess that still happens to an extent, but not like it once did."
"12133190","12134750"," Face mask pulling."
"12136210","12137690"," Punching in the and the neck. "
"12137710","12138890"," All kinds of craziness."
"12139850","12142650"," My father said that the fans when he was young."
"12143550","12145590"," It was like the 70s, I would say. "
"12146650","12147830"," 70s and 80s."
"12148490","12150510"," So you go to a football game and it was."
"12151730","12153310"," It was nothing like today. "
"12157100","12158620"," Bored into Vikings family."
"12159460","12159900"," Go bikes."
"12160640","12161080"," Dubbears. "
"12166330","12168250"," Yeah, Tom Brady, something else, man."
"12168890","12170030"," But you could see that."
"12170210","12170810"," You could see it. "
"12171230","12172330"," His first game he ever played."
"12172350","12172990"," You could see it."
"12174370","12175810"," The bears right now. "
"12176290","12177450"," Bring in blood to the market."
"12178290","12178730"," Finally."
"12179550","12180250"," Come on bears. "
"12184190","12187190"," Vicks trading up into some resistance right now, but 20."
"12190640","12191080"," 2366."
"12192900","12194580"," For a target on the Vicks right now. "
"12199830","12203070"," So American football became big in the UK in the 1980s."
"12203950","12206270"," I was more discerning and waited a while."
"12206430","12207630"," I eventually decided on the Houston Oilers. "
"12208650","12209590"," Yeah, did War and Moon."
"12210930","12211330"," Yep."
"12216180","12219580"," You want me to look on the on the 15 and one hour. "
"12219800","12222700"," Cup and hail forming on 395 C for tomorrow."
"12222700","12223200"," Let's see."
"12223440","12224180"," Yeah, I'm open. "
"12224460","12225460"," I like that trade."
"12226380","12227620"," I like that trade for tomorrow."
"12227820","12229300"," I just don't know where the buy is. "
"12229360","12230220"," I think it's down here."
"12230940","12232460"," I think the buy is right here."
"12232620","12233240"," I'm not positive. "
"12233500","12234520"," It's this deep."
"12235660","12239620"," but I'd like to, I'd like to take that trade with you somewhere down in here."
"12241360","12242300"," I like that trade. "
"12242680","12244480"," I don't think I'm, maybe take a weekly or something."
"12244900","12246320"," This price action probably doesn't matter."
"12248540","12251440"," I'd like to take it a little bit lower if I can, but yeah, I see that trade. "
"12254680","12255920"," You know, it's really weird too."
"12256100","12256800"," Like, I don't know."
"12257060","12261820"," Like, I don't, um, I still watch college football every now and again. "
"12262260","12264460"," I like college football still to this day."
"12264620","12266040"," I like actually high school football too."
"12267660","12269660"," I don't watch as much as I felt they used to. "
"12270840","12272120"," For a multitude of reasons."
"12273860","12276780"," I think too a lot of society has changed."
"12278800","12282080"," I know it's still big with my family and friends and stuff. "
"12282300","12284600"," I don't, not as a particular about it as they used to be."
"12285000","12285740"," Same with basketball."
"12286760","12290900"," Like, I don't like the, I don't, I don't like how basketball changed even. "
"12291620","12294460"," I think maybe MJ's years were the last years that I liked on basketball."
"12294460","12297000"," Like, the no travel league, all that kind of shit."
"12297140","12300840"," I don't like, I don't like how much of a show it's become. "
"12301280","12303760"," I guess it's, I understand it, the show that it's become the NBA."
"12304640","12306860"," And I'm not a really a fan of a hockey anymore either."
"12307700","12311720"," I go, I've been, I go to hockey games sometimes, go to basketball games sometimes go to football. "
"12312980","12315800"," Baseball's been pretty good still to an extent."
"12317960","12320940"," If I'm with friends, I like to go to a baseball game in person."
"12321500","12324960"," As a matter of fact, I'm going to see the Red Sox opening day. "
"12325640","12326600"," So I got that lined up."
"12326940","12328640"," I love soccer right now in person."
"12328860","12329340"," I played soccer. "
"12330180","12331260"," I still love soccer."
"12331780","12333340"," I like rugby to an extent still."
"12334060","12335840"," Golf I'm getting back into finally. "
"12336920","12338500"," I'm liking some of what's happening in golf."
"12340440","12345460"," I don't know if that's because of, I don't know what all the full reasoning for that, but there's a"
"12345460","12346440"," bunch of reasons for that."
"12347220","12349580"," I think some of it has to do too with social media. "
"12361240","12362200"," Dude, I wrote it."
"12362260","12363180"," I was wondering where you went."
"12363360","12364360"," I've been meaning to talk to you. "
"12365500","12366700"," I didn't know you were a real man."
"12366940","12367800"," I've been meaning to talk to you."
"12368000","12371680"," I haven't meant to tell you that I haven't had a chance to reach out to you, but I wanted"
"12371680","12371980"," to. "
"12373120","12374260"," I think Winky did too."
"12375560","12376400"," Or maybe I did."
"12379460","12380120"," What do you got there?"
"12380220","12380680"," Let me see what you got. "
"12387100","12388120"," Hold on a second here, brother."
"12389580","12391180"," I'm going to somehow get that."
"12391420","12392020"," Hold on a second, man. "
"12403820","12404940"," Yeah, I see that, man."
"12406060","12407020"," I see that, brother."
"12410060","12411500"," I see that trade, man. "
"12412880","12413900"," That's a gorgeous trade."
"12418200","12419280"," That's my question, right?"
"12419460","12420200"," Does it go down to?"
"12423160","12425040"," Yeah, that's that 3.89 right here."
"12425120","12425520"," You see it?"
"12426180","12427880"," To the bottom range of that band right there?"
"12430840","12431740"," Right down there. "
"12431840","12434900"," I'm wondering, I'm wondering if it's down here all the way down here or not."
"12437980","12440140"," I don't want to take the, there's two things."
"12440440","12446360"," The only two things stopped me on this trade at this point is I want to see the, I want"
"12446360","12447920"," to see price crossover up here. "
"12449720","12453130"," I want to see price break above."
"12454870","12455750"," I want the confirmation."
"12456570","12459330"," If it fails and goes down, I'm not, I don't want to get trapped in there. "
"12459710","12461030"," But I, I see what you're saying."
"12462110","12463630"," But I don't think it matters on a weekly."
"12463890","12467030"," I think if you just buy the weekly here or monthly here, you're probably fine. "
"12467730","12468050"," Probably."
"12468430","12468910"," Or a spread."
"12470050","12471570"," Like in the money call spread here is fine. "
"12473830","12474910"," I'm looking at it right now, bro."
"12481160","12481980"," Yeah, I know I get it."
"12482160","12482620"," I get it, bro. "
"12485620","12487140"," Yeah, there's a cup of handle here."
"12488200","12493060"," Uh, I mean, you know, like on a, on a one minute or five minute chart, it, it doesn't really"
"12493060","12493760"," matter here."
"12494800","12498080"," Franklin Templeton's head of European fixed income, David's song. "
"12498240","12501560"," I don't know if we're going to do it down here and then do the repair stripper or if we're"
"12501560","12505760"," going to get up in price here, then do the face, especially here."
"12506040","12508500"," I want the confirmation or I want the bounce down below."
"12511160","12512720"," It's somewhere, it's one of these two. "
"12512840","12513800"," I don't know which one it is yet."
"12514440","12515860"," And I'm looking at the VIX right now."
"12516960","12518820"," I'd like to see the VIX get a little bit higher. "
"12522760","12526360"," I'd like to see the VIX get up to that 25 if possible."
"12526900","12528100"," I don't know if I'm going to get it though."
"12532000","12533040"," He's fucking bears. "
"12535800","12538000"," Now 101 bears have a half an hour."
"12551670","12552770"," Yes, I'm going to DC."
"12553950","12556250"," I will be in DC this spring, I think, or summer. "
"12557710","12567130"," We had a trip planned and then DC was closed for COVID, but then because of protesting and stuff"
"12567130","12567470"," like that."
"12567670","12571690"," So we're trying to bring the kids there one time before they're too old."
"12572750","12574610"," So they can see some of their history. "
"12576930","12578490"," If you're in DC, let's hook up."
"12583010","12585650"," As soon as the stream's over, I'll give you a shout."
"12594850","12600230"," Zero head just saying that a Russian fighter jet struck propeller of US military reaper drone,"
"12600450","12604890"," forcing us to bring it down over the Black Sea US military statement. "
"12605770","12607670"," That won't result in anything."
"12609170","12610390"," But it is good to see."
"12617390","12618850"," Yeah, banks turn and drop again. "
"12620050","12628910"," Any specific tickers you want to look at?"
"12628910","12631990"," I see down eye on Apple, maybe bullish move here."
"12647750","12649170"," That's where Apple rolled over to."
"12650970","12654010"," Apple showing slightly more bullishness than Spy right now. "
"12655570","12658410"," Spy has not shown it, but Apple has shown it a little more bullish from a move."
"12659710","12662850"," Still like the idea of a little bit more of a pullback on Apple."
"12663950","12665810"," I'd still like to see Apple come down a little bit. "
"12665930","12667630"," But I agree it's getting bullish in here."
"12672460","12674060"," Just a little bit more."
"12686580","12689060"," Are we getting ZXLF rolling over still?"
"12690900","12693140"," Yeah, XLF is looking a little bearish here. "
"12693880","12697360"," Just a warning to you out there we could get a swift move down here."
"12698620","12700760"," XLF is very bearish right now."
"12702260","12705840"," Getting back gains trading 32.18 on an XLF. "
"12706720","12710100"," That's an Achilles heel for S&P 500 right now."
"12715290","12716130"," You guys want me?"
"12716290","12720050"," You guys got a bank stock you want to see or no specific bank stock you want to look at?"
"12720190","12720970"," I'm going to want me to look at."
"12722670","12723830"," It's a warning out there too. "
"12723910","12725310"," You're probably going to get a move lower here."
"12726530","12727650"," XLF looking pretty bad."
"12731260","12733380"," Wonder if XLF will give back all of its gains. "

"12822230","12823890"," Bright red blood."
"12825210","12826710"," What makes the green grass grow?"
"12827730","12829150"," Anybody know what makes the green grass grow?"
"12830770","12842100"," Someone chat, tell me what makes the green"
"12842100","12842100"," grass grow. "
"12842100","12845360"," Z blood makes the green grass grow."
"12859660","12861880"," Blood makes the green grass grow."
"12865680","12868360"," Here's some, this is kind of supportive in here. "
"12868580","12870040"," I don't know that we get this low here."
"12870840","12872620"," This would be a secondary target."
"12872940","12873920"," This is kind of it right here. "
"12874620","12876120"," We're right where we are right now."
"12876860","12877760"," Kind of see the grind."
"12879520","12882520"," So here's your first target, secondary target down here. "
"12884040","12886740"," 389.60 or right here."
"12896100","12897140"," You're welcome."
"12898820","12904160"," Now, I guess I always want to take like the, I always want to take the, um, hopefully you got"
"12904160","12907060"," out of your calls above and you can get completely fucking torched. "
"12907840","12910100"," If you're a bear, you're printing some money."
"12910600","12915720"," If you're a chase winter, I want to know, are you closing your put spreads or are you super bearish"
"12915720","12918040"," right now and you're going to hold them until they go zero."
"12918560","12919680"," For a bilateral meeting. "
"12927500","12930420"," Look at Chase, print my fucking puts."
"12933460","12935540"," I always love this shit."
"12938060","12941580"," Blood in the streets right now, bright red blood. "
"12942940","12944500"," No trade for the bulls here."
"12945500","12947620"," Big time bull trap in here."
"12948840","12949940"," Bloodin' it down to 390. "
"12951680","12954160"," Bloodin' it down to the right yellow line right here."
"12954320","12956180"," 3949, taggin' it."
"12957380","12960500"," Smashing through right now to R1. "
"12962040","12962600"," Woohoo."
"12963680","12966640"," Yeehaw giving it all back right now."
"12967280","12969040"," All of it back right now. "
"12971220","12973300"," Didn't get caught in the trap, right?"
"12973700","12975080"," None of us got caught in this trap."
"12975320","12977320"," We all knew to take some profit up here."
"12977760","12980220"," Tried a couple times there, tried there a little bit. "
"12980460","12982300"," Nothing to go with there."
"12982760","12983760"," No one getting destroyed."
"12986240","12989540"," Do it live and don't tell people about it afterwards. "
"13005460","13006280"," What does it take?"
"13006620","13008320"," You know, there's money."
"13008520","13011740"," This was the trade for the money part of this trade was right here."
"13013440","13015160"," I don't like buying puts. "
"13015380","13016680"," I don't think the pay well enough for me."
"13017040","13018060"," But no big deal."
"13018560","13020760"," If you like to put side, take the put side. "
"13024570","13025590"," Sometimes I take puts."
"13027150","13028130"," Sometimes I do."
"13032350","13033690"," Is there blood in the streets?"
"13034090","13035070"," There's blood in the streets. "
"13035070","13037090"," Now it's trading down."
"13037210","13040250"," Can we get $3.98, $3.96, can we get it?"
"13040750","13042450"," Now it's trading $3.90, $26."
"13044210","13044830"," Can we get it?"
"13045670","13047790"," Okay, so I want to talk to bulls here, okay?"
"13049950","13051830"," We're not, I don't know if we'll get exactly that. "
"13051990","13052990"," But we're going to look at this."
"13053190","13054770"," I want to show bulls and bears something."
"13054970","13055710"," I want to show you bulls something. "
"13060480","13061360"," Hanks right here."
"13064060","13066620"," You guys letting me focus on the stream today."
"13067300","13071700"," You guys are being nice to me in the in the chat so that I can focus on where we're"
"13071700","13072060"," headed. "
"13073480","13075500"," You're making cap happy today."
"13077840","13078980"," Cap's not salty."
"13079720","13080780"," Pretty happy guy. "
"13083080","13085480"," Everybody's making money, bulls and bears are making money."
"13085900","13087000"," Okay, now."
"13089200","13091020"," We got some talking to do here. "
"13094020","13095820"," We got some talking to do here."
"13097260","13100180"," As we come into the hourly trigger down here, okay?"
"13102520","13104560"," You can't as a bull buy this."
"13104700","13108980"," You can buy like a, you can buy like a, let me explain myself better. "
"13110000","13116080"," You can buy a dip bounce probably down here, like take this higher to this white line."
"13117740","13119360"," Hold on, let me see if we can do this better."
"13122380","13125620"," But the fear here is you're going to get caught in a trap again, right?"
"13125820","13132280"," So you could possibly like buy this once it hits, but then there's risk of coming down and through"
"13132280","13133580"," and going even lower. "
"13134880","13137440"," Now as a bull, what do you need to see?"
"13139220","13141760"," You need to see price bounce here."
"13144400","13148560"," And you need to see price get underneath again."
"13149980","13152120"," The white line in the red line. "
"13153160","13154620"," You have to see this."
"13154620","13158120"," If you don't see this, now you can see this white line."
"13158360","13160960"," This red line, if it goes sideways, is going to imply that the move is over. "
"13162060","13164860"," But even then you need price to."
"13169790","13174050"," You still need price to come back above to get bullish again, believe it or not."
"13175530","13181670"," Now there are ways to tell if the move is over on the downside, but for right now, it's not"
"13181670","13182330"," showing price. "
"13183030","13185810"," It's not showing this move being over."
"13185810","13188590"," So we're not seeing velocity slowing yet."
"13193050","13198010"," So just right here, you can see the deli is a little over sold right now. "
"13198810","13201210"," But the hourly is not showing it to you yet."
"13201950","13205490"," We're still bearish in the five minutes, still slightly bearish in the one minute."
"13206270","13208390"," And the hourly is really not telling you what's happening. "
"13208630","13212390"," So some risk here for you to buy this dip down here currently."
"13213330","13214690"," Are we done going down?"
"13214690","13215510"," Probably not."
"13215890","13221450"," And you probably want to see some consolidation, not just the snapback higher. "
"13221910","13222970"," You want some consolidation."
"13224170","13225890"," So we're not seeing that that moment."
"13226050","13229690"," So as a bull, it kind of like halfway there. "
"13229910","13233490"," You're not like, yeah, I'm ready to buy some shit here."
"13235830","13237190"," Is this the bottom?"
"13237570","13238650"," It's not saying it is."
"13239870","13242950"," So there's nothing here saying this is bottom yet. "
"13242950","13243810"," For bulls."
"13246650","13253530"," My point here on this is that you, my point here on this is that bulls could see."
"13255390","13259710"," This trade come higher and then you get, you get trapped again. "
"13260250","13265790"," Maybe a zero day trade in here, but the problem here is if this continues down, that's where the"
"13265790","13266350"," trap is."
"13267090","13271570"," And then you start to see this trade lower here."
"13271570","13274470"," And you blast through and you're caught one more time. "
"13274790","13276050"," Does that mean this happens?"
"13276350","13276390"," No."
"13277130","13282030"," But what it does mean is if you're a bull trying to grab a dip, that you're going to be"
"13282030","13286130"," looking for this kind of curve up."
"13287330","13289890"," You're going to look for one of two things to happen. "
"13290050","13291530"," There's two ways this can happen."
"13291690","13292990"," This rotation back higher."
"13294050","13296590"," You end up seeing this red line curve here. "
"13297390","13298990"," And what you'll see is price."
"13302010","13305010"," We'll either tag down here and then come up here."
"13305990","13308010"," You'll trade here and do this kind of nonsense. "
"13308210","13309450"," Then you'll see this white line come up."
"13309630","13310670"," Then the red line of going underneath."
"13311430","13313330"," And this is your actual trade right here for bulls. "
"13313670","13314590"," Way up here, believe it or not."
"13314850","13316430"," Now there's a trade in here to make some money."
"13317390","13320370"," There's a trade in here to make some money in a one minute chart. "
"13320610","13325210"," But for bulls for a bull trade, there's a lot of work that needs to be done for bulls at"
"13325210","13325590"," this point."
"13325850","13330990"," They get a lot of work to do to feed time for a positive momentum to come down."
"13330990","13336090"," And raise price up and create a three trigger cluster for the bulls. "
"13337630","13339990"," We just tagged 3960."
"13341050","13341830"," You see it right there?"
"13344170","13345990"," See it right there 3972."
"13347010","13349290"," Now we just smashed 3965. "
"13350550","13352150"," It's actually lower, isn't it?"
"13352570","13354750"," 3960 is actually down here."
"13356190","13357510"," Right there."
"13359050","13360090"," There's 3960. "
"13360310","13361930"," Now trading 3962."
"13362650","13367510"," Now 3957 smashed three pennies down below on the spy."
"13368770","13369130"," Right. "
"13369410","13369750"," Tagged it."
"13369910","13370010"," Boom."
"13370230","13372030"," Look at that big move down right there. "
"13372270","13373410"," Paying puts down below."
"13374210","13376270"," Hit the price target down below right there."
"13376590","13382410"," If it was me, I would take the money and run and look for a move quickly like a move"
"13382410","13382710"," here. "
"13383510","13386330"," At least into this one minute trigger up higher here."
"13386710","13390710"," So just be careful of the snapback trade right here that might be setting itself up."
"13391990","13394890"," So be really careful if you're bear, take the money and run it. "
"13394930","13396890"," Well, I can't tell you to do that, not financial advice."
"13398230","13400510"," But be careful of a snapback trade right now."
"13403590","13405730"," Very careful here of a snapback trade. "
"13406850","13411530"," And this is the this is the hourly trigger right here."
"13412470","13415750"," 3890 right now trying to get underneath the hourly."
"13416270","13421430"," If you're a bull long right now, bye bye calls. "
"13422390","13427650"," Not only that, bears trying to keep it underneath the hourly right now to get even more bearish."
"13428350","13431850"," Bears trapping bulls right now trading 3867."
"13433070","13439250"," Bears want to stay underneath this 3920 and reverse trend to the bear side. "
"13439250","13442470"," Look at that move right there."
"13444470","13447450"," Gave back the entire cash market move."
"13448050","13449690"," Unreal for the bears. "
"13450550","13451890"," Unreal, look at that."
"13452550","13460070"," Underneath that we have a new low on the day broke below 389.96. Bears trying to keep it underneath"
"13460070","13465190"," the hourly trigger here to turn this market bearish once again."
"13465190","13470070"," We were talking about hitting 395 today, 398 today. "
"13470250","13474030"," Look at bears with the smash below 3960."
"13474490","13475850"," Hello ladies."
"13476670","13478610"," Slam dunk for the bears. "
"13479410","13480570"," Go bears baby."
"13481150","13482910"," Look at that Smasher."
"13483470","13485550"," Unreal here for the bears. "
"13486690","13489230"," Can you imagine if you're a long right there, you'd be totally fucked."
"13491350","13493110"," All your calls gone."
"13493110","13495390"," Look at that. "
"13496390","13498970"," All your calls would be dead right there."
"13500070","13501470"," Zeroed out."
"13504270","13505690"," Bye bye calls. "
"13507150","13507850"," Unreal."
"13510530","13513270"," Look at that Smasher right there."
"13513870","13517170"," Let me show it to you on the spy here. "
"13517850","13519250"," Look at that hourly trigger."
"13520050","13520950"," Look at that."
"13521290","13523590"," Look at that nastiness down there. "
"13526010","13529050"," Just slamming it down in the bull's face."
"13530710","13531350"," Doosh."
"13535210","13535850"," Doosh. "
"13538510","13540330"," Bears coming back up here."
"13540430","13543290"," We're looking at 39060 right now for the bears."
"13543570","13546190"," They want to tee right off on 39060. "
"13548110","13549730"," Fucking bears, man."
"13550070","13552710"," Angry, angry bears right here."
"13555850","13560530"," Angry, angry bears right here with slam dunk on the bull's. "
"13560530","13564390"," Quickly fades, pairing to one percent."
"13569130","13571210"," Slam dunk on the bulls."
"13573010","13575050"," Rip the backboard down. "
"13575050","13584970"," You got bears tearing off their gym trunks right now running around naked with"
"13584970","13588210"," their unshaven bodies doing laps around the court."
"13590350","13593450"," Knee slides across the soccer pitch."
"13593450","13596890"," It's pretty daily points for Benachi and market profile. "
"13596890","13599330"," Looks like a seed out of Teen Wolf 2."
"13599870","13600170"," Dot com."
"13612310","13616450"," Oh man, that was great."
"13620650","13622090"," Bears, what are you doing?"
"13622090","13623350"," You savages. "
"13627180","13629960"," Bears just stirring the shitpot now."
"13630880","13632260"," Bears are like, we want blood."
"13632520","13633460"," We're underneath the hourly trigger. "
"13633680","13634380"," We want lower lows."
"13635220","13635860"," Where are they, Cap?"
"13636100","13636840"," Tell us where they are."
"13636920","13638020"," And I'm like, all right, let's take a look. "
"13639260","13640740"," We're not done there."
"13641420","13642460"," You want to know where they are?"
"13642560","13643420"," It's pretty fucking low."
"13646020","13647760"," Three and five, twenty-eight. "
"13648200","13648640"," Jesus."
"13649480","13652100"," If we went that low, three and five, twenty-eight."
"13652300","13653760"," I don't know if we get all right there. "
"13654780","13657860"," The pivot right down here."
"13658240","13659600"," Look at the bears, man."
"13659960","13661840"," Bears coming back right here. "
"13662880","13664280"," Just quieting the bulls."
"13665340","13666340"," And look at them."
"13666480","13667520"," They're like, come on down here. "
"13667580","13668820"," Give me some more action down here."
"13668880","13670960"," Get that one minute and five minute down here right now."
"13672540","13674740"," Bears like, bring down the five minute. "
"13674900","13676020"," Bring down the one minute."
"13676520","13678960"," Let's start teeing this shit off over here."
"13679360","13681600"," I don't care if price goes up there. "
"13681680","13683040"," That's our next target down below."
"13683600","13686340"," If we hit three and five, I'm going to laugh my ass off here."
"13690040","13690560"," Bears. "
"13692500","13694040"," The bears, baby."
"13694500","13694980"," Look at them."
"13700060","13701740"," Bears like we're front running this. "
"13701820","13703060"," You ain't going to put no heads on."
"13704220","13705720"," Bears are all fired up."
"13706180","13706620"," Sweaty. "
"13706800","13707620"," Meet disco."
"13707880","13709640"," Music's just blasting right now."
"13710180","13711760"," They're like, we're not ever front running this. "
"13711820","13712900"," You're not even getting a 400."
"13714140","13718140"," Look, if you don't have, if you don't ride your heads into zero, you're not a bear."
"13723660","13724920"," Ring the bell. "
"13727880","13729300"," Ring the bell."
"13734960","13741680"," I don't hear no bell."
"13749130","13750190"," Oh, yeah. "
"13750530","13752830"," J.T. W.J.C. H."
"13754930","13755650"," Yeah."
"13755650","13757770"," That cocaine bear just did a slam dunk."
"13761250","13762890"," We'll call him bull fucker. "
"13763250","13766090"," He said a bear fucker bull fucker came out."
"13766390","13766790"," Look at that."
"13767150","13768870"," Don't mess with the bear horns. "
"13772210","13774190"," Now looking to trade to the pivot."
"13775330","13778370"," It would be giving up all the gains."
"13779770","13784490"," Going back and going back to the closing price yesterday. "
"13785870","13788090"," Unreal moves here by the bears."
"13788430","13790990"," Let's look at how beautiful that is right there."
"13792790","13793350"," Savagery. "
"13793530","13795610"," Pure savagery by the bears."
"13797170","13799350"," Just taking it back old school."
"13799610","13800270"," They want the pivot. "
"13800890","13803370"," They want the closing price here from yesterday."
"13806090","13808230"," Hopefully none of you bulls got caught in that."
"13808430","13811230"," Good thing Captain Jim James saw this one though, right?"
"13811230","13812190"," Sorry. "
"13812350","13813550"," That was a comment to somebody else."
"13816670","13818330"," You got to love this market."
"13842150","13846310"," White House's Kirby says the U.S. craft posed no threat to anyone. "
"13846510","13848630"," Smash an international airspace."
"13849550","13850910"," Bears smash in here."
"13851470","13852090"," Go Bears. "
"13857650","13858150"," There's no."
"13858470","13859350"," I'll be honest with you."
"13859430","13860430"," There's no trade for the bulls here. "
"13860550","13861110"," You need to escape."
"13861310","13862370"," Bull's got some work to do."
"13862490","13862790"," I'm sorry. "
"13864810","13866150"," Bull's you got some shit to do."
"13866290","13868230"," Bull's got pants."
"13871230","13874250"," Bull's are like, I'm going to go out today and I'm not going to wear my underwear. "
"13874570","13876970"," I'm just going to throw in a pair of shorts and walk around the neighborhood."
"13876970","13878590"," All sun's shining out there."
"13878990","13879770"," The sun is out. "
"13879910","13880190"," It's beautiful."
"13880470","13880950"," We're going up."
"13881170","13881890"," This is the bottom. "
"13884490","13886290"," Bears are like walking down the road."
"13886470","13888350"," They just pants this guy."
"13889210","13890310"," Bull walking around. "
"13890550","13891270"," I'll make it shit."
"13894590","13896310"," Trying to put his pants back on."
"13896530","13897290"," Trips over himself. "
"13897830","13899070"," Balls on a flight of stairs."
"13901390","13902930"," Bears like not so fast."
"13907760","13908380"," Look at that. "
"13908520","13909220"," That was terrible."
"13914490","13914810"," Terrible."
"13942370","13947050"," We just mugged some bulls in here, didn't we?"
"13947190","13948770"," A bunch of bulls just got mugged. "
"13950490","13951610"," I'm like, yeah, come to Detroit."
"13951770","13951970"," It's great."
"13952250","13952870"," Come on over to Detroit. "
"13953010","13953610"," Come hang out in Detroit."
"13954750","13955610"," Come to the neighborhood."
"13956030","13956710"," Everything's going to be fine. "
"13958590","13961070"," Take a soccer ball down to the corner."
"13961710","13963210"," Ball rolls down an alleyway."
"13964170","13965370"," Bull rolls down there. "
"13965390","13966750"," He's like, what's going on back here?"
"13988230","13989350"," Bull's won a refund."
"13997400","13998520"," Bull capitulation."
"14002790","14004390"," I'm reading your comments right now. "
"14018260","14020240"," Yeah, we're getting the trade back higher right now."
"14020320","14021600"," There is a small trade here."
"14022260","14023640"," I mean, we're in charge of this one. "
"14023780","14024780"," There's a small trade right here."
"14024860","14027740"," The one thing I'd be careful of is the reversal right here."
"14028180","14029880"," And there's another small trade right here. "
"14030160","14032100"," If you get above, you take profit right here."
"14032440","14036780"," I'm not taking this trade because I don't want to get people like..."
"14036780","14038860"," I don't want to get people..."
"14040080","14041460"," People are taking these trades."
"14041640","14042240"," They're losing money. "
"14042380","14043100"," They don't have time."
"14043440","14045520"," But there is a trade here."
"14045620","14046620"," We charted this out a minute ago. "
"14046720","14048120"," There's a snapback trade right here."
"14048720","14049920"," You'd have to take profit."
"14050840","14058000"," Then look for another entry after right here. "
"14058140","14059100"," There's another trade right here."
"14059260","14062660"," But I don't want to talk about it on stream because people get and cut the fuck up in these"
"14062660","14062920"," trades."
"14064060","14066000"," I've heard people tell me they're getting cut up. "
"14066220","14068060"," So there is another one minute trade here."
"14068060","14077880"," If price can get above and retest for bulls, the safety trade for bulls though is not right"
"14077880","14078100"," here."
"14078560","14081500"," Just some information about some market moves we saw recently. "
"14081840","14083140"," I want to show it to you right here."
"14083220","14084680"," So this is a five minute chart."
"14084920","14091220"," If you want the safety trade for bulls, I want to show it to you right now so you're not"
"14091220","14092300"," getting banked up. "
"14092700","14094860"," You're not taking profit."
"14094860","14098700"," You're not knowing how to take the trade."
"14098720","14099940"," All that kind of stuff. "
"14101800","14106500"," So right in here and you want to see price come above, believe it or not."
"14108320","14109520"," Hold on here."
"14113400","14116140"," You want to see price come above right here. "
"14117320","14120060"," And then believe it or not, retest this and confirm the trade higher."
"14120820","14124500"," Until you see this retest in here, there's no trade for you as a bull."
"14124500","14125980"," And you got to know that. "
"14127020","14130920"," I'm not willing to trade this shit anymore with you guys because I can't."
"14131060","14134020"," I don't want any follower to ever be losing money with me."
"14135000","14137540"," We lose enough money with bad trades that as it is, right?"
"14138100","14147780"," So you need to see this work"
"14147780","14148740"," itself out here. "
"14149000","14154260"," If you're a trader looking to put on a weekly or a monthly here, you need more than just this."
"14154420","14155220"," This doesn't cut it."
"14155540","14156560"," I assure you it doesn't. "
"14156560","14160600"," If you want to win seven out of nine trades or seven out of ten trades, nine out of ten"
"14160600","14162980"," trades, this is not it yet."
"14165580","14168220"," If you want like the sure thing, this is not the trade yet."
"14170160","14172760"," You have to see price get above, retest down below. "
"14173980","14175020"," Then you're off and running."
"14176860","14179420"," Until you see that, there's no trade for you here."
"14179740","14181460"," Now there's trades here for zero day buyers. "
"14183040","14185460"," And that's, as a prime example, right?"
"14186740","14187980"," It's a prime example."
"14189000","14191960"," You have that trade right there and only that trade right there."
"14192360","14197080"," You can't even get back into this trade unless you can't get back in this trade. "
"14202580","14208260"," You can't get back in this trade unless price goes higher."
"14209020","14209420"," Higher."
"14211180","14215000"," Retests it and then comes up to just right there and that's a trade right there. "
"14216940","14220400"," And then you have to cut them and then you have to wait for price to come up here down."
"14220760","14222140"," And then that's the next trade right there."
"14223200","14225240"," So until you see that, there's no trade for you. "
"14225600","14227380"," I'm tired of people losing money."
"14227880","14229740"," There's no reason for you guys to lose money here."
"14229980","14230040"," None. "
"14232360","14233800"," Or not, not generally, right?"
"14234040","14234960"," Generally should be making money here."
"14235140","14237940"," So there's no trade here for a bull just yet."
"14237940","14242300"," And if it does firm itself up, I'll have it for you. "
"14260690","14263770"," So yeah, so here's the deal with that Twitch."
"14264210","14266870"," So Twitch, it's free."
"14267450","14268310"," You don't pay anything. "
"14269550","14274130"," If you want to find a way to support the channel and don't want to tip, like some people are"
"14274130","14275090"," like, I want to tip with cash."
"14275990","14277670"," Some people are like, I want to donate and ask a question."
"14278230","14282630"," Some people are like, if I make money, I want to tip only based upon performance. "
"14282630","14286630"," Some people are like, I'm poor, but I want to tip, but I'm poor."
"14286950","14294610"," So if you're like, poor and want to tip, if you sub through prime, Jeff Bezos gives me $2.50"
"14294610","14296390"," a month, two bucks."
"14298430","14301790"," I think it's $2.50 a month if you sub through prime. "
"14302830","14307410"," So it's a free way for you to stick it to the man and tip without paying any money."
"14308630","14310630"," Some people want to subscribe where they pay money."
"14310630","14317650"," Now, at some point in the future, there's likely going to be some kind of a bonus material for"
"14317650","14318830"," anybody that does sub with money. "
"14318990","14325070"," If you're subbing on Twitch with a monthly thing where you're signing up to pay cash, I've already"
"14325070","14329670"," just decided that we're going to do some kind of private stream for you guys."
"14330010","14334910"," I'll try to find a way to do like a tear stream where I just chart your favorite tickers out"
"14334910","14335350"," for you."
"14336450","14341470"," So if you're, if you are, I haven't done it yet, but I was talking to Winky about it and"
"14341470","14343390"," you'll get a free stream. "
"14344870","14349030"," Like on a Saturday or Sunday, and I'll do an hour or two with you."
"14349030","14350490"," Let's say there's five or ten."
"14350610","14351610"," Even if there's five or ten of you. "
"14353810","14356710"," We can spend an hour just charting out your favorite tickers."
"14356790","14362970"," You want to look at or if you have a question or maybe a concept you want to understand, you"
"14362970","14367810"," can tell me in advance and I'll try to be prepared for you to review these concepts with you if"
"14367810","14368810"," I can, if I understand them."
"14370210","14374970"," So if you are subbing with like a monthly, whatever, I don't even know what the monthly thing is"
"14374970","14377250"," that I think Twitch standardizes it. "
"14377310","14382190"," So if you do something like that, and you want to do like a Saturday or Sunday morning, one hour"
"14382190","14382450"," thing."
"14383630","14386550"," We're more than happy to do that for just those people that are doing that."
"14386790","14390690"," Now, if you want to, if you're trying to find free ways for you guys to support the channel too,"
"14390690","14394490"," because I know some of you don't have a lot of money or you don't believe in tipping. "
"14394950","14397050"," So if you can, you can stick it to Jeff Bezos."
"14397890","14400830"," Two dollars and fifty cents a month, it will be subbed through prime."
"14402250","14406290"," But there's no requirement to sub, there's no requirement to follow, there's no requirement to pay. "
"14407590","14410230"," No requirement to tip here, there's nothing hidden behind a paywall."
"14410790","14412470"," I have nothing behind a paywall here."
"14412890","14415710"," The discord's not through a paywall, the livestreams aren't. "
"14415710","14417430"," Captain's Alpha isn't."
"14418770","14424130"," And the only time that there will be something charged will only be when I pay for data and shit,"
"14424190","14428530"," which I'm going to be paying some severe money for data with the new website."
"14429130","14432610"," But you'll still be able to get a buy without having that website as the key. "
"14432950","14434970"," And there will be free tools on that website."
"14436050","14440090"," So there'll always be some kind of a free version that you can hack your way through."
"14441090","14442310"," I promise that. "
"14443210","14445990"," I started out as that, I'll never give that up, so."
"14452590","14454270"," Yeah, that's for free picks."
"14459450","14462770"," Yeah, and some people want, some people are making money here or not losing money. "
"14463010","14464570"," Some people are learning shit here and they want to tip."
"14464890","14472450"," There are donation buttons, I believe there's a donation button in the YouTube description under"
"14472450","14472690"," PayPal."
"14473970","14474930"," There's a few things you should know. "
"14475690","14483610"," If you do a super chat, I split that money with YouTube and I pay taxes on it."
"14483770","14485530"," So I'm seeing like 30%."
"14485530","14491050"," The best way to support the stream is through, if you're trying to do a donation is through the"
"14491050","14493490"," direct PayPal link in the description of these videos. "
"14494230","14497210"," It's the easiest way for me to get the most money."
"14497690","14500110"," I split a lot of money with Twitch."
"14502410","14504530"," And with taxes and all that stuff. "
"14504670","14505970"," I don't really see a bunch of it."
"14506290","14508390"," As a matter of fact, I haven't seen tips in."
"14508730","14513710"," I think like two months they hold them for, but like I think it's two months like two full months"
"14513710","14515130"," they hold that money to. "
"14515310","14515850"," So there's like this."
"14516370","14518290"," It's all part of like social media control."
"14519590","14522130"," It's all built into like feeding the machine. "
"14522990","14524110"," It's kind of fucked up."
"14524330","14525910"," If you want the most direct way to support."
"14525910","14529590"," I have a PayPal button, I think in my description. "
"14530390","14531510"," And that one is legit."
"14532030","14537170"," And that I think I might have one in Captain's Alpha had one on Captain James on Twitter, but I"
"14537170","14540650"," removed it because these fucking bots were fucking."
"14540950","14547170"," Where they were creating fake Captain James names and then saying join me in. "
"14548110","14551230"," You'll never get a DM from me asking for money ever."
"14551790","14553510"," Ever for nothing ever."
"14553510","14556070"," I decided to lead all that shit on public Twitter. "
"14556310","14556930"," Private Twitter."
"14557470","14558450"," There's no bots in there."
"14558610","14561350"," So I left the donate button there as well. "
"14562170","14567110"," And that's the way where social media companies don't pick my pocket or whatever."
"14567850","14569290"," And it does cost my interest."
"14569810","14571590"," Believe it or not, this costs a lot of money. "
"14573490","14574830"," I just replaced my computer."
"14575830","14576650"," That shit was too grand."
"14578230","14581390"," I paid for all the service and running around town to come back and streaming. "
"14581390","14582750"," It's just expensive."
"14582990","14583410"," It's not cheap."
"14584090","14587510"," So if you are donating or supporting the stream, I really appreciate it. "
"14588090","14591650"," If more than you know, it helps me to continue doing this."
"14592150","14595210"," And not only that, the time and effort and energy that it takes."
"14595910","14599270"," I don't know why, but my own brain, like seeing a tip does help. "
"14599530","14600450"," It makes me feel good."
"14600570","14600970"," I don't know why."
"14601290","14602290"," It shouldn't, but it does. "
"14603530","14604990"," I'm being honest with you."
"14606410","14610110"," But you just showing up as enough to if you're a poor trader, if you're losing money, you're losing"
"14610110","14610410"," your shirt."
"14610410","14612090"," Your count is down this year. "
"14612470","14613950"," You don't fucking owe me a tip or nothing."
"14613950","14614850"," You owe me zero."
"14615910","14618830"," If you just want to hang out with me, I'm fine with that. "
"14619150","14620970"," I can really good with that, believe it or not."
"14621930","14627670"," And there's a bunch of people in this that support the stream through their time, right?"
"14628330","14630450"," And so at some point, I need to make this stream."
"14630750","14635070"," I need to make the content help to pay these guys. "
"14635930","14638690"," So I'm trying to do that in a model that's free for you."
"14638690","14642870"," So it's seamless, but be able to pay these guys down the road."
"14643510","14653370"," So whether that's through ads or Amazon Prime or links to Amazon Prime so that there's this"
"14653370","14654270"," thing where there's this thing. "
"14654430","14655470"," I haven't rolled them out yet."

"14669930","14672030"," It's a way for you to support the stream and support these guys."
"14672650","14678290"," And it's part of the reason why we're starting the website too, is so that that will help pay the"
"14678290","14679410"," people that put this together."
"14679810","14682210"," If you think this is just me, you're crazy. "
"14683490","14689770"," There's like, there's right now there's about 20 people in the background that work to make sure"
"14689770","14691030"," that I'm here right now every day."

"14698290","14700590"," There's a doctor that helps me with my voice."

"14706550","14709930"," I've got Joe Donuts out there trying to give me vision. "
"14710490","14713710"," You know, there's like, there's all these different, there's people working on technical stuff in"
"14713710","14714050"," the background."
"14714330","14719090"," There's people working on trying to interview people, people working on the development in the"
"14719090","14720870"," background, the full stack kind of stuff."
"14720870","14724390"," So, you've got Winky here every single day. "
"14724730","14729070"," So, trying to build this up into that work and at least be like, here, for your time, please take"
"14729070","14729270"," this."
"14730610","14732410"," Because it's not sustainable otherwise."
"14733650","14737610"," The discord, your wife's boyfriend's in there, Winky's in there, Jason Hendricks is in there. "
"14738590","14740830"," A whole bunch of other people in there just trying to make things work."
"14741530","14747170"," Providing until you've got, you know, long time watchers that show up every single day that drop"
"14747170","14748230"," knowledge in here, right?"

"14768150","14768430"," He's real."
"14768670","14769370"," He's not a furu."
"14769750","14770170"," He's wrong. "
"14771070","14772870"," We actually get to see him wrong in real life."
"14773390","14776090"," He's not constructing something for you to see."
"14777010","14777610"," He's not. "
"14779150","14784030"," You know, there's like something about crafting an image for you people out there that is so wrong."
"14785110","14786810"," And you get this like poisoned."
"14789050","14789850"," That's not poison. "
"14790090","14794390"," It's a crafted astroturf view on how things are."
"14794550","14795850"," And I don't want to provide that for you."
"14795870","14798670"," I'm here to show you how it is to be a trader in real life. "
"14800090","14802050"," I hope that that you gained from that."
"14804130","14806010"," If you want me to be right all day long, I can."
"14806170","14808010"," I can easily, easily be right all day long. "
"14808250","14813450"," I can easily just show up when the trading environment is perfect for me and my trading style."
"14814670","14817730"," Easily do that for you and look like I look like I'm perfect."
"14818550","14820490"," It's just not the case for most people. "
"14821190","14825630"," You run into issues trading, investing, buying, selling, you get cotton traps."
"14826530","14828930"," You have hard days and good days, right?"
"14829790","14832390"," Pissed off days, happy days."
"14833190","14838790"," So that's I think that's the experience that a lot of traders and investors are missing is the"
"14838790","14839130"," reality. "
"14839710","14843950"," Do you guys really want to see me with a nice fucking car and a jet and you guys really"
"14843950","14845950"," want to see me like showing off shit to you?"
"14846490","14847350"," I don't know."
"14847450","14848810"," Is that really what you need?"
"14850130","14851730"," Do you need that?"
"14851990","14854670"," Like do you need Tony Robbins?"
"14855690","14857770"," I don't know that I'm not going to be that guy for you."
"14857770","14858890"," I'm going to be the guy that's going to be. "
"14858970","14860030"," This is what real life is like."
"14862510","14863510"," And it's different."
"14863850","14865550"," It's not like what you think it is. "
"14865790","14868590"," And oftentimes you beat yourself up when you think that it's only you."
"14869050","14870670"," It's like, man, I'm having a tough go at this."
"14872650","14873870"," Or I'm struggling with this. "
"14874210","14875630"," Or you've always got someone in your ear going."
"14877090","14877850"," I nailed it."
"14877930","14878290"," I nailed it. "
"14878830","14879230"," I nailed it."
"14879310","14879690"," I nailed it."
"14879790","14880150"," I nailed it. "
"14880230","14882130"," And you're like, why can't I be that person?"
"14883890","14884410"," Right?"
"14884410","14886130"," So you beat yourself up, right?"
"14886290","14887270"," You beat yourself up mentally."
"14887810","14890330"," You beat yourself up with depression or whatever it is."
"14890870","14895870"," And when a reality is you really need to see how someone else trades or invests and see the trials"
"14895870","14897170"," and tribulations that they go through. "
"14898010","14899170"," The good times and the bad."
"14899890","14902150"," Because that's more based in reality."
"14906130","14908230"," That's more the reality of life, right?"
"14920780","14922000"," I saw you, Binky. "
"14923300","14924240"," I saw you."
"14926040","14928620"," You guys even know that side of this trading life."
"14928740","14932260"," You guys see like a lost over image of what things are. "
"14935770","14937590"," That's just not what it is."
"14941060","14942120"," It's just not what it is."
"14942200","14943560"," And people work hard on that image. "
"14944140","14945000"," They work hard."
"14945260","14947260"," Can you imagine having to work on that image all day long?"
"14948080","14948660"," And you know what?"
"14948800","14950920"," A lot of them only make an hour long video because of that."
"14951140","14951920"," For the image they have to show. "
"14951920","14953720"," All right."
"14966950","14967450"," So we've got some."
"14967750","14969930"," This is some good stuff for Spy right now. "
"14969950","14971290"," You like to see this right now, right?"
"14971730","14972550"," Consolidation on Spy."
"14972950","14975010"," You want to see this consolidation on Spy."
"14975170","14976610"," You don't want to see him teeing off here. "
"14977250","14980130"," There is still some risk here for bulls, right?"
"14980250","14983870"," You've got the five-minute chart still coming down a little bit here, right?"
"14984150","14988450"," You kind of know these bears want to send this right back down here, right?"
"14988650","14988990"," Into the bell."
"14989570","14992310"," Bears want to get that big, big, huge clothes down below."
"14992310","14997290"," They want to get down here and send it down to $3.57. You want to send it right back"
"14997290","14999350"," and they're going to tell you, you know what's funny about this morning?"
"14999850","15003670"," Before I came on this morning, I looked and I was like, there's no gaps. "
"15004890","15008070"," I was like, there's no fucking gaps on this open this morning."
"15008930","15010650"," And I was like, that's that's abnormal."
"15010710","15012210"," You don't normally see no gaps. "
"15012250","15013490"," And there are no gaps here."
"15013990","15015630"," No gaps down below from yesterday."
"15016570","15022090"," But they still want to take it down to the closing price. "
"15025240","15030200"," Even with no gaps down here, there's no gaps in here, right?"
"15031360","15033400"," They took it down to the opening price here."
"15034260","15040060"," But they're saying to you, yeah, we're going to get all of this here to delay some bonuses and"
"15040060","15042720"," expand the hiring freeze tomorrow's."
"15044320","15047300"," And so what do we need here for both to buy to the tick?"
"15047840","15049080"," We need time. "
"15049120","15054380"," The more time we spent here, the more time in it, there is for the one in the five minute"
"15054380","15057540"," to start to chill the fuck out, right?"
"15058340","15063380"," It also gives time for anything bad that can happen where bears are teeing off in here, trying to"
"15063380","15065040"," send this prices lower, right?"
"15065800","15066840"," So this is not the time."
"15066980","15071080"," We just talked to 10 minutes ago and said, you look at a five minute chart."
"15074660","15077300"," Where is the confidence trade here for a bull?"
"15078680","15079920"," It's not here, is it?"
"15080060","15080900"," This is a five minute chart. "
"15081080","15081720"," This is not the confidence."
"15082000","15082600"," Oh, hold on a second."
"15084740","15086200"," Like we talked, we talked. "
"15086460","15087780"," Remember, Nino's in here, right?"
"15088580","15091260"," Nino, you were gone for a few days and I harped on this."
"15092400","15093420"," And Nino was right."
"15093780","15095260"," Nino's like, I don't want to get cut up. "
"15095940","15097160"," Nino's like, I don't want to fucking get cut up."
"15097720","15099120"," I just want to take a trend trade."
"15100440","15102000"," Can you get me a trend trade?"
"15103660","15106080"," And we're not in a trend trade right now, are we?"
"15106160","15106900"," This is just a five. "
"15107940","15109400"," It's a perfect time here."
"15110920","15117220"," We need price to be above the one in the five right here on a five minute chart."
"15118080","15119540"," We're not seeing that yet, are we?"
"15120680","15122680"," I don't put some risk on the market right here. "
"15123220","15129100"," The truth is you can't take this trade until you get above this, right?"
"15129100","15131660"," Or find a bottom, right?"
"15131800","15132160"," One or the other."
"15132960","15136240"," And even then, let's look on a higher timeframe from the 15 minute."
"15136460","15138600"," Let's look at a 15 minute in a one hour. "
"15139320","15141240"," And let's look at the 15 minute here."
"15141380","15142260"," What is setting up here?"
"15144840","15146140"," Kind of bearish, isn't it?"
"15147980","15151180"," What do we not want to see happen here in a 15 minute?"
"15151620","15153600"," So now you're a bull or even you're a bear."
"15154680","15155560"," Bear bull doesn't matter. "
"15156280","15159520"," On a 15 minute chart, what does a bear want to see?"
"15159520","15169040"," A bear wants to see price get underneath this five minute and"
"15169040","15172840"," buy enough time for the one minute to get underneath here."
"15173000","15173440"," See that?"
"15178270","15180570"," Make this trend go lower here."
"15180990","15182730"," This is what a bear is looking for right here. "
"15183950","15190290"," Bears can't take a short here until they get underneath three 88 98."
"15190990","15192030"," There's no trade here for bears."
"15192030","15201830"," There is a trade for bears though if price gets under three 88 98 and confirms off of the one"
"15201830","15203490"," minute coming underneath there, right?"
"15204610","15210310"," Just one minute line here coming underneath that will confirm it. "
"15210690","15216930"," So a bear is looking for price to get underneath and confirm that move lower."
"15217470","15217910"," Make sense?"
"15220130","15224110"," Now let's look at a higher time frame, a one hour time frame, right?"
"15224710","15225890"," And what are we looking at here?"
"15227330","15230970"," Same kind of the same thing that the 50 minute saying, right?"
"15231530","15235050"," Bears want to get underneath this level is three 88 support right here."
"15235110","15236290"," Bears need to get underneath it. "
"15236590","15242090"," It's also telling you that if bulls do buy down here, that we know there's some sellers here,"
"15242230","15242370"," right?"
"15242730","15247890"," We know that trend sellers are trying to send this down right here on the end."
"15248710","15256790"," We are trying to confirm the move is actually lower and not higher and bulls need to get above this"
"15256790","15259890"," level here and get up to 395 and actually 399."
"15260410","15261310"," Why do we say that?"
"15261430","15262210"," Why do I say to you?"
"15262830","15264470"," Hey, I want to get up to 4000. "
"15264910","15265570"," Why is that?"
"15268180","15273760"," Because if I look at a daily chart up here, there it is right there."
"15274660","15275420"," See it?"
"15278100","15282680"," There's 390, there's 395, there's 398 right there."
"15284100","15294380"," So if we are bearish here, if trend is down, if we're bearish, that"
"15294380","15299120"," means this white line's going to come over and this big old red line's going to come over up here,"
"15299860","15300540"," right?"
"15300540","15303880"," And we're going to tee off from up here. "
"15305200","15309980"," Way up here, we're going to tee off and then start making a nasty move lower."
"15310320","15310740"," Makes sense?"
"15311500","15314780"," So the daily is 398, right?"
"15315220","15317520"," 395 is, hey, maybe that's the top, right?"
"15317880","15319980"," That's that red line right there in the daily chart."
"15321320","15325040"," And then in the hourly trend, they're already telling you, they're like, fuck you, we're not"
"15325040","15325700"," getting up there. "
"15326500","15329120"," Look, we're not even getting up to the daily resistance levels."
"15329480","15330600"," You ain't getting your 395."
"15332420","15333960"," You ain't getting your 398. "
"15335820","15336840"," That's not happening."
"15340120","15342300"," And just remember that daily, right?"
"15343820","15345700"," Remember that daily number here?"
"15345820","15347740"," Remember this, the daily number up here?"
"15348520","15353360"," You know, if the bulls can get up here and try to fight in here and then try to fight"
"15353360","15357440"," near at 398, they have a shot then to reverse the market."
"15357940","15361960"," This is where that big yellow line is right here. "
"15362400","15364360"," So, you know, this is the tee off line."
"15364960","15366480"," This is also the reversal line."
"15366980","15370740"," So if you can trade this up here, take that money and then you wait for it to come up"
"15370740","15376360"," and retest the daily and then you can take a lot much longer trade with confidence as a bull. "
"15376560","15377640"," But we're not even there yet, are we?"
"15378300","15379480"," Right in fucking there yet."
"15380840","15383880"," And this morning I was talking to you about the risk on market."
"15387410","15391530"," I'm telling you this morning, I don't fucking like the item I'm trade. "
"15391870","15393610"," Well, first of all, because it's not has no liquidity."
"15394250","15400670"," My second issue here is that we have CPI here and the other risk to the market is actual crash."
"15402810","15405690"," There's actual crash risk in this market. "
"15406210","15406990"," And it is here."
"15407650","15411650"," Whether you can or can't see it, whether you disagree or not, I don't fucking care."
"15411650","15413590"," I care about me. "
"15414530","15418850"," And I care about me knowing that there's crash risk in this market right now."
"15419690","15425450"," Because I know there's you're not going to tell me that in a bull market we have crash risk like"
"15425450","15426890"," we do right at this moment right now."
"15427130","15428930"," It's heightened at this moment right now. "
"15429730","15436530"," So, you know, there's risk in this market, especially the last week."
"15438130","15442350"," So even right now, this telling right here, I'm going to assume that this wasn't expected today."
"15451780","15456840"," I guess, I guess one person probably called it, but it wasn't expected generally today. "
"15457180","15461320"," So, um, bulls, what do they need for today?"
"15461660","15465260"," We're in the five minute back to that five minute chart, bulls need some consolidation."
"15465820","15467360"," Bullen bulls need to chill the fuck out."
"15467900","15473180"," And they need to wait for a price to get above right here and try to get that trade going"
"15473180","15473500"," again. "
"15473500","15475480"," Okay, try to get that speed and up here."

"15556550","15558370"," If price can get above."
"15561200","15564120"," Or you get your market address or show your market address right now. "

"15574660","15576620"," And price can get above right here."
"15577960","15580960"," And you continue to see the hourly trigger come underneath. "
"15582580","15584140"," This is how you get your three trigger combination."
"15584500","15585180"," Now, this can be bad."
"15585320","15588480"," We can actually sell here, but if price gets above here. "
"15589420","15592700"," It's going to be a it's going to be a velocity move to the upside."

"15602560","15606120"," We have a two trigger cluster, a one minute and an hourly."
"15606640","15608860"," Polish so far because price is above."

"15639390","15640350"," Boom, right there. "
"15640470","15641070"," We're going to make it green."

"15657710","15658970"," Watch it real closely right here."
"15659750","15662890"," If actual price of spy can stay above."
"15666830","15670190"," Right then this this line right here probably shouldn't matter. "
"15670250","15671890"," This is three ninety seventy eight."
"15672410","15675970"," We're going to watch how this unfolds right now and see the longer we spend here."
"15676410","15677330"," The more bullish we become. "
"15677870","15681930"," This can actually turn to bearish as well for the different downside move."
"15682310","15683730"," Like a fucking bloodbath in the clothes."
"15684390","15688170"," But if you're a bull, if price can get above this green line right here. "
"15688690","15691310"," And this the squiggly white line right here."
"15691310","15692610"," It's going to get pretty fucking bullish."
"15694030","15699490"," And the crazy part is if we trade above here to if we trade above here. "
"15700490","15703790"," And retest below get above just like this."
"15704130","15705630"," In fact, I'll just draw it out for you."
"15713680","15715420"," Now I want to see this first. "
"15715620","15716260"," I want to see this."
"15717120","15718160"," We'll see this."
"15719140","15720700"," See this right here. "
"15722700","15724120"," And that right there."
"15724120","15732190"," And I'm not going to buy this until we get about here."
"15732970","15734170"," I just want to look for this. "
"15735050","15736350"," So in my mind already."
"15737150","15740670"," In my mind right now I'm going if I can see this kind of stuff happen right here."
"15741250","15743130"," By the time we get right here, I'm going to take a long. "
"15743550","15745410"," Now let's say we start to sell here."
"15745790","15747970"," That I know that this isn't playing out right."
"15748150","15751070"," I got no trade if we start doing this nonsense right. "
"15751690","15753810"," But I know that if we start squeezing up here."
"15754390","15756950"," I'm going to watch this this white line underneath."
"15757430","15759810"," I already know that the red lines of the underneath. "
"15760310","15764130"," I'm going to slam down here and confirm that trade and I'm off and running."
"15764430","15764910"," You see that?"
"15765090","15766490"," So that's where the confirmation is."
"15766890","15769270"," So all kinds of work in here for bulls to do. "
"15770530","15774590"," Until I see that happen, there's no fucking trade for a bull."
"15776550","15779390"," And it's not only unwise to take this trade."
"15780230","15782490"," But I trade that like seven, eight, nine times, ten times. "
"15782490","15783110"," You're going to fuck it."
"15783270","15788370"," Yeah, you look like a rock star for calling it the one time or the six times."
"15788590","15791030"," But it's like four times you're not going to call it. "
"15792030","15793330"," Three times you're going to get it wrong."
"15796780","15800820"," And you want like 90% accuracy, 70% accuracy, that kind of stuff."
"15803460","15804840"," So that's what I'm looking to happen. "
"15804840","15811120"," Now if this doesn't happen, I already know where that next support level is."
"15811180","15812000"," It's right down here."
"15812000","15821030"," And that next support level on the spy is rechecking the previous low. "
"15823470","15824650"," 3,5, 34."
"15829200","15830420"," 3,5, 34."
"15836140","15837160"," Right down there. "
"15840370","15841850"," 3,5, 34, right down here."
"15841970","15842330"," That's where it is."
"15844150","15845170"," It's actually a little lower. "
"15845250","15847390"," It's like somewhere down here, but you get the picture, right?"
"15848410","15849130"," There you go."
"15849210","15849670"," You're set up."
"15850410","15852090"," You're setting ready to go right here. "
"15852830","15859310"," And you already know what numbers we close below leads us to a bearish resolution tomorrow."
"15860310","15861550"," We're not even there yet, right?"
"15861630","15864690"," We just looked at the hourly and the daily and said, you know, we close it."
"15864690","15866490"," And the 15 minute was like, hey, close both of these numbers. "
"15867010","15867830"," We're fucking bearish."
"15868890","15870170"," I'm assuming it's right down here."
"15870250","15871170"," 3,5, 34. "
"15873470","15875150"," And that's where you get some trend going."
"15880680","15883860"," Man, you know, I think that you could, I think you could record."
"15883860","15887820"," Or you, I bet you could just have taken that little segment right there and make a video on it. "
"15887920","15888120"," Zed."
"15889680","15890440"," There you go."
"15890860","15891400"," It's all you need. "
"15894620","15898360"," I think that, I think that little rant right there would explains it perfectly."
"15930280","15930740"," Hold on."
"15930840","15931300"," What's going on?"

"16768790","16770390"," Trend is the yellow line."
"16776630","16777630"," This one right here."
"16779650","16780850"," This is like the driver. "

"16791970","16793510"," This is the emotional one."

"16808260","16813540"," And this right here is the monthly right here."
"16814500","16817000"," And if price gets above these three."
"16820620","16822140"," And you have the one in the five minute. "
"16822340","16825240"," This becomes a very volatile mix right here."
"16827520","16828900"," I mean like 50."
"16829220","16830340"," I mean like 50. "
"16831300","16832840"," Like hidden 50 on VIX."

"16843020","16851330"," Now the spy is still under the same relentless pressure."
"16854130","16858450"," So if you look on a one day chart here."
"16865570","16867070"," I want to show you that pressure. "
"16868590","16870590"," Maybe I can show up under a 30 minute chart."
"16873690","16874530"," This is more clearly."
"16877870","16879070"," This is a 30 minute chart. "
"16884560","16887920"," You don't want to see price under this green."
"16888960","16890060"," The screen right here."
"16890820","16891940"," And it's under it right now. "
"16892880","16894480"," And you don't want to see."
"16896340","16899600"," The monthly the weekly and the daily come down here either."
"16900400","16901720"," You just don't want to see it. "
"16901920","16903280"," You don't want to see this stuff coming down."
"16903280","16904480"," You don't want to see price under."
"16904920","16906660"," You don't want to see the hourly under here. "
"16906840","16907960"," You don't just want to see this stuff."
"16908240","16911440"," This is how a crash is created right here."
"16913420","16915220"," I want to show you something else right now. "
"16915220","16916000"," I want to look at something else."
"16916780","16918060"," This is what I'm leading up to here."
"16918740","16920300"," This has been happening now. "
"16921860","16923600"," Going back in February right here."
"16925100","16926020"," It's very scary."
"16926920","16927860"," Now it doesn't mean we crash. "
"16928120","16931980"," It just means that there's real danger here."
"16931980","16934440"," That's lurking underneath the market."
"16934460","16937840"," Now leading with that doesn't mean we don't go up here or whatever. "
"16937960","16939200"," I just want you to know that it's there."
"16940740","16941960"," It's lurking in the background."
"16942280","16943500"," There's macro stuff. "
"16944100","16944240"," Unemployment."
"16945780","16949500"," Not the bullshit you hear about what the fed fund rate is going to be."
"16949920","16951300"," Unemployment inflation. "
"16952960","16954040"," 2s and 10s."
"16954440","16955680"," 5s and 10s."
"16957040","16957560"," The fed fund rate. "
"16958960","16959440"," Unemployment."
"16960020","16961480"," All these macro things."
"16961920","16963660"," They're screaming at you right now. "
"16963880","16964560"," They're fucking screaming."
"16965220","16967280"," They're like we've hit all the requirements for us to have a crash."
"16967700","16970720"," We've hit all the requirements for a bank to lie to you. "
"16971520","16972600"," And then the front run a crash."
"16975000","16977520"," I want to show you something here that I haven't shown you."
"16985500","16987440"," This is where the real scary shit comes in. "
"17000330","17004250"," Hold on a second here."
"17012330","17013710"," Give me one second."
"17022510","17024130"," I want to show you one thing here. "
"17051850","17052950"," You're just a second here."
"17053050","17053250"," Hold on."
"17061830","17071450"," Right there. "
"17080660","17081700"," Right there."
"17081960","17082600"," Look at that run."
"17093680","17099340"," The US State Department says we expect Russian ambassador to meet with senior US officials. "
"17099340","17100840"," She was on Tuesday afternoon."
"17125620","17131680"," I want to show you something in the background here that I haven't shown you."
"17143260","17144740"," This is a daily chart here. "
"17145640","17147400"," I want to show you something here in the background."
"17151380","17156340"," This is a monthly momentum here."
"17158680","17170600"," And this is bringing this up"
"17170600","17171100"," for you here. "
"17171220","17171400"," Hold on."
"17177270","17177950"," There we go."
"17182910","17184630"," I want to show you this right here. "
"17191800","17193440"," This is what I really want to show you here."
"17193760","17194600"," This is an important thing."
"17198140","17204040"," So if there's a moment in the market or there's risk of crash. "
"17209010","17210490"," This is monthly momentum right here."
"17210670","17216250"," And you see how it's even though price is going up right here."
"17219130","17221130"," So here we show it's a better way here. "
"17223450","17225430"," So see how price is going up right here."
"17228820","17232160"," And I want you to see how momentum is going down right here."
"17234400","17235320"," This is monthly momentum. "
"17235860","17237800"," And this could be very dangerous in the market."
"17238700","17242800"," And what it's really showing you is that they're not buying this market even though prices are"
"17242800","17243220"," going higher."
"17243520","17244720"," So there's a chance here. "
"17245340","17247000"," Even though we have higher prices right now."
"17247780","17250700"," The banks are removing themselves in the market without you knowing it."
"17253580","17255020"," And I want you to look at this. "
"17255200","17258560"," This daily omen, this is daily, weekly and monthly."
"17260260","17262040"," You start stacking these up here."
"17264640","17266620"," If you start stacking these up down here. "
"17268280","17269820"," And if these start breaking below."
"17273020","17274680"," It's starting to predict a crash."
"17276840","17278220"," It's not saying it's going to happen. "
"17278880","17281060"," But I'm going to show you where it has happened in the past."
"17282520","17284360"," You see how low this one is the right here."
"17285380","17286340"," There's one right here. "
"17286780","17288340"," This is the bottom, the end."
"17288880","17290320"," Let's see where this one is right down here."
"17290980","17292660"," It's right before the last leg down. "
"17293160","17294140"," See how that lines up."
"17294860","17296020"," I want you to see how it lines up."
"17296920","17297500"," So right here. "
"17299140","17301880"," That starts to line up when we're right below."
"17302380","17303320"," This is low right here."
"17304180","17305340"," And we're just starting one right now. "
"17306240","17307820"," This is past a month right here."
"17308280","17309000"," It's right here."
"17309520","17310300"," I'll show it to you. "
"17311020","17312200"," Right, fucking there."
"17315640","17317820"," And it was the last leg of 2020."
"17319460","17320720"," There's other examples of it too. "
"17321340","17322020"," There's one right here."
"17322960","17324420"," This is 2008."
"17326200","17330660"," And right in here what they were doing was they were selling out without you knowing in price. "
"17331600","17333080"," And we made one more like down down here."
"17334020","17335860"," We went underneath on a monthly momentum."
"17336480","17338560"," You can kind of see it happening before it happens. "
"17338560","17340620"," So you want to see something here."
"17340780","17343180"," I want you to look at how price is going higher."
"17344120","17345640"," See how price is going higher. "
"17347360","17349520"," And see how momentum is going down."
"17350560","17352500"," Even though price is going higher."
"17352960","17354640"," So according to that it's right there. "
"17354840","17358080"," GOP says US should guarantee all bank deposits."
"17358640","17362140"," It's right where you see that last little boom leg drop down the market."
"17362880","17363360"," Okay. "
"17364560","17366940"," So we're seeing this right now."
"17367660","17369020"," In the stock market."
"17370640","17371700"," Currently right now. "
"17372260","17374000"," Seeing declining momentum on the monthly."
"17374820","17377020"," And yet price is not showing us lower prices."
"17378440","17380880"," I'm not saying this happens, but I'm warning you. "
"17381480","17382960"," If you're in this market right now."
"17383820","17385300"," And people are telling you."
"17385900","17388420"," You got yesterday at Mike Barry telling you. "
"17388440","17389000"," Probably not."
"17389520","17396260"," I'm promising you that there is a chart here telling you no."
"17398060","17400200"," That there is systemic risk. "
"17401360","17401860"," At this moment."
"17404660","17407740"," Now if we squeeze up for a day or two a week."
"17408400","17409380"," We squeeze up to 400. "
"17410240","17411560"," Squeeze up for 30."

"17517310","17520850"," We broke below the weekly and monthly that was check mark number two. "
"17521870","17524470"," And as we're heading into right now check mark number three."
"17525050","17528050"," Start to see the bank cracks even though they tell you it's not that bad."
"17528490","17529770"," That's not that bad check mark. "
"17530230","17532230"," Then you're looking at the unemployment rate."
"17532230","17532990"," The inflation rate."
"17533270","17534210"," Tens and twos. "
"17534350","17534790"," Fives and tens."

"17547090","17549830"," No matter what anyone's telling you I'm telling you this fucking thing right here."
"17550970","17551570"," It's crashes."
"17553570","17557070"," And right now it's it's saying that we're in risk of one doesn't mean it's gonna happen. "
"17557070","17557310"," No."
"17558070","17559930"," But if anyone's out there telling you like."
"17559930","17562890"," You know this is the fucking bottom. "
"17563970","17564970"," I'm a bull."
"17570140","17572640"," I'm telling you there's there's a stomach risk."
"17573960","17575780"," In this market right at this moment. "
"17576940","17577960"," It's a stomach."
"17588460","17589880"," So trade higher right now."
"17590640","17593620"," I want you to know though that that's there. "
"17596220","17597860"," I want you to know that it's in the background."
"17599320","17604280"," I want you to know that if you woke up tomorrow we were down hundred points two hundred points"
"17604280","17606360"," three hundred points five hundred points."
"17607680","17609500"," That that systemic risk. "
"17611160","17614120"," Is currently right at the tipping point."
"17614660","17615520"," Could take a week."
"17615840","17616220"," Could take a month. "
"17619100","17620580"," But I want you to know that it's there."
"17621660","17624060"," I'm kind of glad we talked about it at this moment."
"17624460","17627280"," I've been meeting to talk about it with you guys and having a chance to talk about it with you"
"17627280","17627440"," guys. "
"17628160","17630740"," And I just need you to know that it's there in the background."
"17630740","17633760"," No matter who's telling you shit or what on social media."
"17634400","17641440"," But there is systemic risk to wake up tomorrow morning and have your 1987 crash. "
"17642960","17644580"," I assure you it's right there."
"17646140","17652660"," More so that it's been anytime since June of last year right now at this moment."
"17653680","17658280"," You have declining velocity on the SP 500. "
"17660740","17663900"," On a monthly planning monthly velocity it's very dangerous."
"17677400","17678300"," Yeah I want you to know."
"17685170","17686450"," I want you to know that it's there. "
"17689370","17691410"," It doesn't mean you can't take long here it means."
"17692730","17695730"," I need you to or I want you to be aware of it."
"17696490","17697650"," You can be bull all day long. "
"17698670","17699810"," Just be aware it's there."
"17705160","17706300"," Because I wasn't really concerned."
"17706620","17707000"," I'll be honest. "
"17707160","17708500"," I really wasn't concerned about it."
"17709100","17712820"," I wasn't concerned about it until some shit matched up on charts macro stuff matched up."
"17713600","17717300"," But I want you to be aware that underneath the surface. "
"17718200","17722500"," We didn't really have a risk at 3.45. We didn't have a risk in June, October."
"17723300","17724040"," I couldn't see it."
"17724160","17725020"," I was like we're not there yet. "
"17725460","17726280"," Time is not right."
"17726380","17727160"," All kinds of shit's not right."
"17727580","17729720"," But right now at this moment it's right. "
"17731920","17735660"," You know we can say yeah the market's hedged and so Gama's going to save us."
"17738810","17741350"," And I can assure you that if they pull the trigger and start."
"17741550","17743390"," If they pull the trigger and start selling the smart with real money. "
"17744130","17745210"," There ain't nothing saving it."
"17746770","17747990"," Not a fucking thing."
"17752880","17754080"," They own this market. "
"17755320","17756460"," Right now they own it."
"17757820","17759960"," We're underneath the weekly and monthly so they own it."
"17760220","17762040"," So they own everything. "
"17762040","17763080"," They bought everything in October."
"17764380","17765420"," They bought everything in December."
"17766960","17768640"," If they decide to do the drug pull. "
"17769000","17770440"," There's no auto buying underneath."
"17771220","17777500"," And once that train gets if that train gets going at any point."
"17778660","17779720"," You ain't stopping it. "
"17780100","17780180"," Right?"
"17780440","17780960"," Nothing you're going to do."
"17781040","17782100"," Nothing the feds going to do."
"17782320","17783580"," Nothing Jerome can do. "
"17784220","17785680"," It's just going to start rolling right down."
"17800260","17801900"," You know I'll be honest with you."
"17802100","17804140"," Like when you're watching these when you're watching this kind of stuff. "
"17804480","17807540"," It doesn't give a it doesn't care about news."
"17807540","17809420"," It's just telling you in the background."
"17809720","17810240"," It's telling you. "
"17811620","17812320"," We're declining."
"17812780","17813840"," It's giving you a warning."
"17813860","17814280"," It's saying. "
"17814840","17816640"," We don't care what is being said publicly."
"17818260","17820600"," The market is at risk of rolling over right now."
"17822240","17823540"," Doesn't matter what the reason is. "
"17823920","17825220"," Doesn't matter if it was something manufactured."
"17825600","17826540"," Doesn't matter if somebody don't know."
"17828340","17832540"," Doesn't matter if it's like a data scientist that works for JPM that says. "
"17833040","17835160"," Yeah, it's been three years since some some's happened."
"17835720","17836700"," It's going to happen."
"17837300","17838280"," Moving risk from the market. "
"17838280","17839480"," We were the liquidity from the market."
"17839680","17840680"," Doesn't matter what the answer is."
"17840820","17841220"," Why it is. "
"17841800","17842300"," Doesn't matter."
"17854900","17856480"," And this is why I want to get to 400."
"17856700","17857840"," I'm like, let's get up to 400. "
"17858200","17858520"," Whoo."
"17859580","17860840"," Give me that market hedge, baby."
"17861320","17862100"," We put it back on. "
"17862820","17864040"," Because I am in panic on this."
"17864260","17866060"," I'm like, I'm not panic, but I'm like, yeah."
"17869620","17872040"," Even though I'm panic, I don't want to waste money on puts either. "
"17873940","17875840"," I'm also, I'm also greedy."
"17875840","17878820"," I don't want to get, I don't want to like, I have done that before."
"17880200","17883460"," I spent like 100 grand once on some crash protection. "
"17885040","17885440"," Gone."
"17887140","17888800"," So I don't want to waste money on this."
"17890420","17894840"," Like I get that we can go straight up from here, but I want you to know that in the"
"17894840","17895140"," background. "
"17895780","17898320"," If they're telling you like, Oh, there's no risk out there."
"17898440","17901020"," I'm like, Oh, this is as risky as it's ever been."
"17901680","17903700"," Right now is the riskiest time. "
"17903700","17907580"," In like 30 or 50 points being nothing to me."
"17908880","17911600"," Like we trade to 400, 410, even 430."
"17911980","17912820"," I'm like, that ain't shit. "
"17913740","17916940"," The risk is like five, 600 points down right here."
"17919960","17921700"," So I'm like, what's a 30 point swing?"
"17921980","17922700"," It doesn't mean shit."
"17923560","17924100"," It means nothing. "
"17927400","17927740"," Here we go."
"17927820","17931900"," A little bit of consolidation now for the bulls, bulls trying to put it back together."
"17932760","17935100"," Trying to put their pants back on, trying to squeeze us higher. "
"17935780","17937660"," None of this has changed right here, right?"
"17938100","17939480"," None of this right here has changed."
"17939720","17941580"," You want to see that the price come higher?"
"17941980","17944480"," Come back down, retest this red line right here."

"18252580","18255720"," It's funny because I'm like, I'm like, wait a minute. "
"18255820","18258540"," I'm like, are they, I'm like, are they, are they telling you that we're going to keep raising"

"18259140","18260180"," 25 VPS?"
"18261480","18265140"," Are they telling you this because they don't want you to know that they're going to front run the"
"18265140","18266240"," fuck out of pausing rates?"
"18268660","18274160"," Just selling this shit down because they already know that they're you're only getting probably one"
"18274160","18275480"," more rate hike if possible."
"18277440","18278720"," If we're lucky."
"18279700","18282360"," So there could be like a calming of the markets from sellers. "
"18283660","18287040"," Like real sellers saying, oh, no, no, no, no, no."
"18287040","18291240"," The Fed is definitely going to raise rates, but only 25 basis points."
"18291920","18298780"," We've calmed down the baking failures and, you know, we're going to continue on the path for the"
"18298780","18300280"," next two or three cycles. "
"18302280","18303520"," Borders, I should say."
"18303880","18308420"," So according to task, Russian defense ministry says that Russian fighters did not use on board"
"18308420","18311680"," weapons and did not come into contact with an American drone."

"18322670","18322810"," So."
"18331650","18332630"," Right over here."
"18332670","18333430"," What am I looking for?"

"18744220","18749420"," Let me know what you, uh, let me know what you come up where you come up with there."
"18752280","18752860"," There's part. "
"18753180","18757200"," You know what's crazy is you can actually see what you can actually."
"18757200","18762860"," I don't know how to explain this, but you can see where they'll prop price up and exit the market"
"18762860","18763460"," without you knowing."
"18767570","18768010"," Exactly. "
"18771650","18773250"," Yeah, you'll see the next though."
"18773390","18777930"," They'll exit the market and you won't see it on regular available data."
"18786090","18789630"," Now we do have what we have a blackout and buybacks come up soon, right?"
"18791670","18795590"," What is it on the 16th?"
"18795590","18799350"," Right, a buyback blackout on the 16th. "
"18799350","18804750"," I think I can't remember 16th or 17th is a blackout on buybacks for tech companies."
"18805630","18807810"," So you won't have that liquidity in the market."
"18813830","18815830"," I can't believe you logged in right then and there. "
"18816750","18817710"," That's awesome, Benny."
"18838580","18839680"," Oh, no way, really?"
"18847960","18848680"," Let me know."
"18848780","18849280"," What you got?"
"18849800","18850640"," What'd you come up with?"
"18850760","18851240"," I'm interested. "
"18855790","18857270"," Yeah, it's the 17th, right?"
"18864170","18865510"," Yeah, I think it's around there."
"18866810","18868470"," It's really suspect right now."
"18869250","18870950"," And you know me, man, I'm a fucking permeable. "
"18873090","18874190"," I'm a permeable man."
"18874530","18875430"," It's the scary."
"18875670","18883010"," It's the most scared I've been since November, September, November of 2021. "
"18885050","18888370"," I was making videos then saying we're going to get a fucking role."
"18888370","18890190"," I was like, you might see Apple squeeze up."
"18892130","18893590"," And that's what we saw that, right?"
"18893690","18896950"," We saw tech squeeze up into the end of the year and then fucking boom. "
"18898110","18900750"," We're right with the same declining volume as that time too."
"18904920","18905640"," They're not volume."
"18905920","18906500"," It's not volume. "
"18906700","18907660"," It's momentum."
"18908320","18908580"," It's velocity."
"18910220","18910940"," There's your clue. "
"18913460","18917360"," We have declining velocity on the monthly."
"18971900","18974680"," Yeah, I don't want you to think like I don't want you to think that."
"18974860","18977940"," I don't want you to take what I just went through in that stream. "
"18978520","18980340"," I don't want you to take that as."
"18982580","18983440"," It's going to happen."
"18983440","18985980"," I want you to take it as a measured. "
"18987220","18991540"," I want you to take that as a measured healthy fear of where we are in the market."
"18996750","18998590"," And you guys know I never say this shit."
"18998610","19000410"," You guys know that I never ever. "
"19001390","19002590"," Say this shit without."
"19004630","19006130"," Some kind of basis in fact."
"19008770","19010170"," You know what we'll do is this. "
"19010810","19011930"," Do you guys want to go over."

"19024990","19028590"," Even a dumb cash market trader can understand. "
"19029090","19030730"," You guys want to do that part of it too."
"19031070","19032270"," They can show you the second half of it."
"19033330","19034630"," We can look at it right now. "
"19038490","19040050"," I can lay it all out for you."
"19040130","19041230"," I can show you TLT."
"19042130","19043370"," Showing the same fucking thing. "
"19043950","19046250"," TLT is remember by a hundred bucks goes up."
"19046510","19049550"," Comes back down by a hundred bucks goes up comes back down."
"19049950","19051370"," You can look right back in 2008. "
"19052310","19054750"," Look back at every crash you ever had same shit happened."
"19055770","19058430"," TLT trades up down up down up down up down sideways."
"19058430","19063590"," And then it gets that fucking rip on high high quality bonds. "
"19064270","19064910"," When it happens."
"19065750","19066990"," There's your step number two."
"19068610","19070790"," You can look right at a year chart on TLT. "
"19070870","19072730"," It's playing out exactly how we talked about."
"19079820","19082100"," So I don't mean to put a damper on the show either."

"19242210","19246310"," We're going to do that at four o'clock or unless it gets unless this is a boring close. "
"19246310","19248270"," I want you to look above here."

"19249690","19251670"," We have a three trigger cluster starting right now. "
"19257440","19259600"," If price can stay above."
"19259920","19260740"," Let's look closer here."
"19261600","19269730"," If price at any point. "
"19273080","19274500"," Can get above."
"19278460","19281020"," 389 83 with the one minute above."
"19281820","19283980"," We should take a rocket ship right here in a few minutes. "
"19284700","19286520"," We need to see price above 389."
"19286520","19286660"," 82."
"19291560","19293420"," And the one minute as well. "
"19293800","19295380"," So three nine eighty two."

"19326440","19329680"," We don't see price come up here trades not on not valid."
"19331500","19333740"," If price gets above here."
"19339750","19341150"," Price becomes valid. "
"19356110","19360050"," And I'm going to set up the stuff in the background for us to look at the macro stuff."
"19368460","19371340"," If we can't stay above this where we going."
"19372080","19373120"," Does anybody know. "

"19383050","19385970"," And you're going to see price follow all the way down here."
"19386770","19390010"," Retest this low and even lower to three eighty five. "
"19394980","19399740"," So price must stay above here and get above this yellow box and this white line right here."
"19404280","19407640"," And there's that target below right there three eighty five thirty four."
"19408200","19409380"," No trade yet for bulls. "

"19500740","19502380"," Pulling out hairs in their armpits."
"19503940","19505440"," Bears getting all bared up. "
"19506440","19508140"," Waiting for this report at the end of the day."
"19508220","19508720"," They'd be like whoo."
"19509720","19512980"," This is like the simple stupid trader report. "
"19513600","19516320"," This is how you understand shit as a as a as a dumb trader."
"19518560","19521980"," That's what the finance guys call you and the Wall Street guys call us."
"19522100","19522680"," They say we're dumb. "
"19524820","19526080"," The fee collectors."
"19527580","19528740"," The insiders."
"19537380","19538640"," Weakness right now. "
"19538900","19540620"," Look at that weakness price below."
"19541120","19543920"," Bear plane starting to form on the spy right now."
"19544340","19546720"," Still no trade for bulls is there. "
"19547500","19548060"," Look at that."
"19548360","19549460"," No trade for the bulls."
"19552980","19554900"," No risk either though right. "
"19557060","19558480"," No risk either."
"19558680","19559620"," Didn't take that trade."
"19559920","19563020"," Knew that we needed to get above and test the one minute above. "
"19564700","19568460"," Still no risk bull sitting on his hand right now."
"19571320","19573560"," Bull saying I'm not getting caught in that."

"19577060","19578240"," I'm not getting trapped. "
"19584100","19584920"," Deaf to bulls."
"19587720","19590300"," Yeah, I think it was chase."
"19590740","19591340"," I think chase. "
"19591560","19592340"," I think so."
"19592460","19596600"," I think what happened was we went into a close and we took profit and chase wasn't here."
"19597240","19601020"," It's like we all took our money and ran it on like one day and then we came into the"
"19601020","19603280"," market the next morning and the market was in fire. "
"19603340","19604120"," It was blood."
"19604700","19609400"," Like just bleeding on the open and shit and all of us were flat and we're just like in here"
"19609400","19609620"," going."
"19610580","19614520"," When we buy a dip man and chase just kicked in the door. "

"19619300","19621500"," pulled up and we're like whoa whoa whoa."
"19626010","19629110"," But he was like kicked the door and kicked us out of the chairs."
"19629790","19633770"," He like broke a leg off the kitchen table instead of breaking glassware everywhere. "
"19633770","19635410"," We're all drinking beer and hanging out."
"19636390","19637730"," It was hilarious."
"19639090","19640650"," And of course I'm yellow to chase. "
"19640830","19643330"," I'm like don't come inside this stream right now."
"19648330","19652930"," We all got caught like we're all like we're all like we're all sitting there holding their dicks or"
"19652930","19654790"," whatever and sessions that beep."
"19658350","19659770"," Yeah, that's what it was. "
"19660230","19662010"," Dead open the door all like hanging out."
"19663890","19665570"," We were trying to get pulled up."
"19669370","19670290"," It was hilarious. "
"19672670","19674110"," That day was hilarious."
"19680600","19684200"," Well, no, I mean, I chase was right because people were caught long."
"19685000","19686900"," The whole bunch of people got caught long and that shit. "
"19687020","19687620"," I remember that day."
"19688460","19690320"," We were all just like, oh, no, not yet."
"19690820","19691080"," Not us. "
"19691860","19693380"," We're still cool here, man."
"19702440","19703520"," But it was hilarious."
"19704680","19705740"," And I love that shit. "
"19705740","19707020"," Y'all getting pulled up in here."
"19707020","19707840"," Is that what's going on?"
"19712340","19714960"," If you were here that day, it was fucking hilarious."
"19717380","19718500"," Still makes me laugh. "
"19718960","19719720"," Still right now."
"19719900","19720500"," Still find it."
"19721080","19722000"," Still get a kick out of it. "
"19723020","19724400"," And it was really serious too."
"19724640","19725960"," Like everybody's in panic."
"19726540","19727880"," Everybody's wondering what's going to happen. "
"19728640","19729300"," It was really tense."
"19729640","19733240"," Like I think it was one day when it was expected to continue to go up or something like that."
"19735900","19737300"," Oh, what's going on here?"
"19739020","19739420"," Ooh. "
"19742040","19743980"," There's like we got to sell this red line, bro."
"19748760","19750280"," Look at this dog shit in here."
"19750520","19751040"," That's good. "
"19751280","19752580"," This is great trade right there."
"19753580","19754940"," This is all dog shit in here."
"19757060","19759300"," Now, let's talk real quick about tomorrow, too. "
"19760700","19761980"," What day is today, man?"
"19762180","19763520"," Is today only fucking, what is day?"
"19763700","19763960"," It's a Tuesday?"
"19765460","19766460"," It feels like a Friday already."
"19769080","19770400"," Let's look at the rest of the week here."
"19771300","19772280"," Or at least right now. "
"19772340","19773080"," Let's look at the rest of the week."
"19774480","19774880"," So."
"19777320","19777720"," Sorry. "
"19778460","19779140"," About that."
"19780040","19780440"," Okay."
"19780760","19782140"," So this is what the bulls want, right?"
"19783340","19783840"," You can see this. "
"19783920","19784900"," So this is a weekly chart here."
"19787320","19790200"," We know right now there's some support down here, right?"
"19792080","19794140"," We think there's support down here, let's say."
"19794900","19796080"," It's not great support. "
"19797280","19799100"," We know we're able to get lower, right?"
"19801260","19805060"," We know we know that true range right now is going down here at 380."
"19806240","19808840"," And we actually know we can get lower than this."
"19809180","19810360"," We're going to look at a large time frame. "
"19810460","19811420"," I'm going to show you some stuff here."
"19812780","19814420"," How we can get lower and stuff."
"19816260","19817840"," We know right now this is true range. "
"19818020","19818700"," Or we can get down here."
"19820540","19825100"," We know that the, at least for a small time frame, we want to get price above."
"19826420","19828260"," Or bulls want to get price above. "
"19828720","19830180"," This is a five minute chart, right?"
"19830960","19834460"," So right now there's no intraday trade for a bull, is there?"
"19837360","19838920"," A 15 minute chart."
"19840180","19841460"," You can see it though, right?"
"19841780","19842880"," There is a bull trade here."
"19842960","19843960"," See how this white line. "
"19845160","19846460"," Comes over right here."
"19846600","19849700"," We need price to get above to get higher tomorrow, right?"
"19850120","19851000"," Tuesday, we need to get higher."
"19851940","19853080"," It's kind of bullish there, right?"
"19853640","19861560"," We know that there's, we know that there's sellers at 395 and 398, kind of big ones in the daily"
"19861560","19861960"," at least. "
"19862980","19864180"," If I can make this bigger."
"19865460","19867880"," I know that these sellers are hiding out here."
"19870640","19872840"," We know that some bigger sellers will turn this one yellow. "
"19875180","19876860"," We know some bigger sellers above."
"19878380","19883340"," We're going to talk about a, or they are the big boys right up there."
"19885620","19887860"," We have something to look at here. "
"19888140","19889300"," Something that's important to look at."
"19898640","19900720"," I think someone was talking about this in the weekly."
"19900980","19901940"," We're going to look at the weekly here. "
"19903360","19906940"," And there's still some very bearish conditions here."
"19907720","19909400"," So this is your trading range right now."
"19909760","19912160"," A 398 down to 380, believe it or not. "
"19915620","19917240"," Are we done here, right?"
"19917420","19919220"," You see the 30 teeing off here, right?"
"19919400","19920400"," They're teeing off at 407."
"19920960","19923220"," They're teeing off again and they're teeing off right here."
"19923220","19927480"," Didn't even get any kind of an extreme upper movement to the market, right?"
"19928140","19929420"," Didn't even get to where you wanted to get. "
"19930080","19931920"," Just showing you bear down, right?"
"19932920","19936180"," Telling you we're going to continue to go down in the trying to break through."
"19936380","19939560"," Remember we talked about trying to break through this stuff here?"
"19939680","19940660"," This is the December."
"19942380","19945180"," This is the December support in the market. "
"19946800","19948240"," We've got a one hour here."
"19950560","19952060"," You start to look at."
"19953960","19956160"," You start to look back over here on the right hand side. "
"19956240","19957740"," You see the support over here, right?"
"19958180","19960100"," This is December support right here."
"19960760","19963620"," And you see them already trying to grind through it right now, right?"
"19964040","19966580"," Hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, boom."
"19967720","19968160"," Breakdown. "
"19968380","19971360"," Well, at least I think it's 345, excuse me."
"19972160","19974020"," We have a true low down here of 374."
"19974840","19976220"," So we know we can trade to 374. "
"19977000","19977680"," That's S2."
"19977900","19978840"," We know we can trade there."
"19980040","19985540"," And we know once all if this support is lost down here that we can go to 345, 36, like"
"19985540","19985880"," it's nothing. "
"19986660","19988020"," Like it's like it's like it's butter."
"19988660","19990300"," And we know that the banks own all this."
"19991080","19994360"," We know are below the real support in the market on the weekly and monthly. "
"19994720","19999800"," We know the only thing holding this market up is whomever bought October and December."
"20000240","20005740"," We know are below moment of velocity and momentum, which is the auto bots that buy this market."
"20005840","20006940"," We know are below it right now. "
"20006940","20015260"," So at high risk right now, we're on a one hour chart, right?"
"20015620","20015900"," Trend."
"20017080","20019660"," If the white line is above the red line, that's bullish."
"20021160","20027560"," But this white line comes up here and this red line comes down below where bullish price comes"
"20027560","20027920"," above. "
"20032180","20032660"," Right?"
"20033040","20034920"," And we're going to start attacking these sellers above."
"20036180","20037540"," Squeeze them out, squeeze them out."
"20038240","20039960"," Rip face are up north, believe it or not. "
"20041240","20042460"," Is this the move?"
"20042940","20045860"," Are you telling me that this is the move up in the market?"
"20047720","20052680"," Because normally the easiest way is wherever the easiest path is, right?"
"20053240","20056880"," Do we have more demand right now in the market to go higher to 410, 430?"
"20058080","20059920"," Or do we have more likelihood of going lower?"
"20060040","20060880"," I want you to think about that."
"20061280","20062420"," Is the move higher or lower?"
"20063280","20063720"," Is it to 460?"
"20065100","20066500"," Or is it more likely closer to 360?"
"20068560","20073380"," Now we can get squeezes in here and all kinds of squeezy shit, but it's just another place to sell"
"20073380","20074280"," down this market."
"20074840","20075520"," Make sense?"
"20076180","20077120"," Staircase it down. "
"20082580","20083540"," So internet plays?"
"20083840","20085200"," Yeah, there's a trade here higher."
"20088020","20089220"," Let's look on the daily."
"20091180","20092380"," See it right there, right?"
"20092600","20093500"," It's actually lower now. "
"20095280","20097280"," I gave you these numbers earlier today."
"20097400","20098440"," I guarantee it's lower now."
"20098520","20099520"," I guarantee it's down there. "
"20101740","20104220"," Now it's that 398-397 right there."
"20106000","20108760"," And look at that, just crashing down upon us over here."
"20112000","20113240"," And what are they trying to do?"
"20115140","20117060"," Is get us underneath over here, right?"
"20118080","20118940"," We have a new low. "
"20119160","20120340"," I'm going to have to look at the weekly, actually."
"20120460","20120820"," Let's look at the weekly."
"20122620","20123780"," Let me do it on SPX. "
"20127520","20129480"," Now we're not going to do any lessons here."
"20130800","20135200"," And how to read a classic stock chart, but this is a weekly chart right here."
"20135580","20138080"," I want you to know something else. "
"20140400","20141820"," This candle right here."
"20141920","20142520"," You see this candle?"
"20145110","20149930"," We have a series of ready one, two, three, four."
"20152330","20153990"," Decliding higher highs. "
"20156130","20159450"," Increasing lower lows here, here, and here."
"20159530","20162990"," This candle right here, this one right here was unexpected."
"20163510","20164410"," You can't tell me it was. "
"20164570","20166750"," You can as a bear say, you knew this candle was coming."
"20167370","20170090"," This candle changed any kind of bullishness."
"20171970","20177210"," If you're doing like a bull's got this, bull's got that, bear's got this, bear's got that. "
"20177390","20179390"," Right now, that candle changed."
"20179390","20187020"," And until you get above that, until you get above that candle, close higher than that candle."
"20187320","20190940"," Until you get a close, believe it or not, above 410, we're not bullish. "
"20193380","20195360"," All bears are in control here."
"20196860","20200340"," And right now you have another new low on a new week already."
"20204470","20207330"," So long term is not, this is not over yet. "
"20208250","20211730"," Until you can show me 410, 412, this shit's down."
"20214470","20217170"," You have a lower low on this new week already already."
"20218070","20222150"," Now, if you had held the previous low from last week, I'd say, no, that's so bad. "
"20223770","20226130"," But all this is lining up to say bearish."
"20228590","20231790"," And I think this is where you get like your, where is it down?"
"20231930","20232870"," Everyone to show that to me?"
"20233210","20233970"," Something like that, right?"
"20234210","20235830"," And then we go boom, straight down there."
"20237810","20239250"," I wouldn't be that high of you like there. "
"20240970","20241770"," That's your head and show."
"20241870","20243050"," It's kind of like a head and shoulders, right?"
"20244310","20247070"," That's to show you that way right down right there, something like that."
"20247770","20249230"," So, so far we're not bullish. "
"20250610","20251330"," Nothing convincing."
"20253070","20254390"," You got to show me some proof."
"20254730","20259050"," And if you're going to take a long, you better get a higher high and you better get a lower"
"20259050","20259770"," low next week. "
"20261070","20264150"," Give me a higher low, excuse me, higher low and then a higher high."
"20264550","20265450"," See this inside candle?"
"20265650","20266670"," That didn't give it to you, did it?"
"20268570","20274910"," So you need a candle that closes at a high above on this week, if not next week."
"20276410","20281350"," If everything is spelling down right now, that's a weekly basis. "
"20281990","20283530"," The weekly looks like dog shit."
"20284250","20286590"," Pure unadulterated dog shit."
"20287670","20291350"," I'm not going to lie to you bulls, doesn't look good here. "
"20295960","20297340"," And a daily on the SPX."
"20298380","20299520"," Same thing, right?"
"20299900","20301100"," What is this right here?"
"20301820","20303060"," You know what this is, right?"
"20304700","20305920"," Do you know what this is?"
"20306700","20308540"," This is a fucking baro, baro, plain."
"20309340","20310400"," That'd be all serious. "
"20311560","20313300"," This is a baro, plain."
"20313940","20315540"," This is not what you wanted to see today."
"20316640","20320400"," You don't want to see this candle red on a daily on SPX. "
"20320740","20324140"," You don't want to see it pushed down like it is on SPX."
"20324600","20325500"," You don't want to see."
"20326900","20333200"," This cross taking place on the SPX, because I'll show you exactly what it is. "
"20337450","20338530"," It's right there."
"20341590","20344510"," And all I'm asking for is to put a hedge on the market."
"20344670","20350370"," I'm like, can I just get up here to 398 so I can tag that so I can make that"
"20350370","20350930"," blood rain?"
"20352930","20354530"," We can't even get that right now. "
"20357750","20359210"," It doesn't look good for a bull."
"20360050","20362010"," I'm going to be honest with you."
"20362010","20365350"," And the daily look atrocious. "
"20369320","20371340"," And I mean atrocious."
"20372960","20375540"," This is not the look for bulls right now."
"20377500","20380020"," This is a, I'm sorry, I'm going to be honest with you. "
"20380100","20381260"," This is not healthy."
"20382560","20384580"," No matter what you're hearing out there, this is not only."
"20384680","20389500"," I don't care about like a plane getting shot down, a drone getting shot down, anything like that. "
"20389760","20391100"," This has nothing to do with that."
"20391100","20395120"," This didn't lead to a plane being shot down over the Black Sea."
"20396540","20399680"," This didn't lead to a plane being shot down. "
"20399960","20402440"," This didn't lead from Silvergate."
"20403940","20405620"," It's all lining up though, right?"
"20408080","20412760"," This doesn't lead to a 25 DPS rate hike and continued rate hikes down the road."
"20413400","20414480"," You're being front run. "
"20415140","20420400"," Or at least it's showing you that be you're being front run for this market to sell at this point."
"20422160","20423960"," You look at a four hour chart."
"20424720","20428280"," We already have the cross already there done. "
"20430400","20431920"," There it is right there."
"20433980","20439080"," There's your bearish cross teeing off didn't even wait to get up to 395, 398."
"20439740","20441960"," None of this didn't wait for this just slam. "
"20444060","20445340"," Four hour trend."
"20447120","20448480"," One hour trend."
"20449660","20451300"," What does that look like to you?"
"20452760","20454700"," Bearish is fuck all. "
"20460750","20464210"," And I'm just like man, can I just get this one part so I can get in there."
"20466410","20469070"," And we're talking about buying IWM."
"20471250","20473190"," It's not looking to what is this?"
"20474450","20475850"," It's a 15 minute. "
"20476330","20477250"," It's a bearish crossover."
"20480300","20482120"," I don't know like I'm trying."
"20482120","20483280"," You have to teach. "
"20483320","20489580"," You have to teach me something that I'm missing because this shit's looking sickly at best."
"20491720","20499280"," I don't need to see too much here to know that the market is on cusp of some real danger"
"20499280","20499800"," to it."
"20500800","20502100"," I'm actually disgusted. "
"20502420","20504100"," You'll be looking at the suspect right now."
"20508250","20509610"," That's a 10 minute chart."
"20510470","20512030"," That's a five minute chart. "
"20513210","20514670"," That's a one minute chart."
"20519370","20520730"," None of this looks good."
"20522510","20523310"," It's gross. "
"20524050","20525130"," I'm sorry it is."
"20531180","20532700"," And this looks healthy, right?"
"20532900","20533920"," Look at the spy right now."
"20534020","20535220"," This looks fine, doesn't it?"
"20536580","20537540"," Not so bad. "
"20537700","20539180"," Let's buy a dip, dip, cup and handle."
"20539880","20540980"," Take this in tomorrow."
"20541960","20542940"," I'm telling you man. "
"20545600","20547500"," I'm bearish as fuck here."
"20547760","20548460"," I shouldn't be."
"20561340","20563320"," Breakdown below to 335. "
"20564560","20565080"," 34."
"20565580","20566820"," New low on the day."
"20567520","20568420"," One minute chart. "
"20569000","20571200"," How many charts are going to throw up there to you to say?"
"20572560","20574280"," We're at risk of a market crash."
"20585600","20587420"," We're at risk of a yesterday too."
"20596780","20606620"," You know, it just doesn't look"
"20606620","20606880"," good. "
"20606960","20607760"," It doesn't look healthy."
"20611920","20614300"," It looks very sickly here."
"20619970","20621490"," None of this looks good. "
"20621490","20624950"," We're going through climbing voss, voss, but I'm telling you, man, every single thing in the"
"20624950","20626250"," background does not look good."
"20626410","20628210"," Nothing is looking good here."
"20639880","20640860"," Well, come get it, then. "
"20640960","20642240"," I'm still long, 13 socks."
"20651700","20652740"," No, no, no, no, no, no."
"20653000","20654540"," It wasn't all buy, buy, buy, buy. "
"20654700","20655360"," It was buy, buy, buy."
"20655640","20659780"," Well, the whole plan here is to get up to 398 so we can short the fuck out of it."
"20661860","20663020"," That was the only plan. "
"20669410","20672690"," The only plan was to get to 398 to short the shit out of this stuff."
"20672850","20673250"," That was it."
"20673550","20674510"," We didn't quite get there. "
"20674570","20677950"," We got up to 393 and we got out of that."
"20678030","20679890"," We didn't get caught in any of this shit down here."
"20680870","20681490"," None of it. "
"20681590","20684710"," And we spent the rest of the day talking about the dangers of the market right now."
"20689760","20692700"," You got old man Johnson, Mike Barry telling you, there's no systemic risk."
"20692900","20694400"," I'm like, dude, I'm looking at it everywhere. "
"20695300","20696900"," You see it everywhere right now."
"20697600","20698400"," Everybody turn."
"20698600","20699200"," It's bearish. "
"20699800","20701560"," Bears, bears, bears, bears."
"20710000","20710680"," Let it burn."
"20710880","20711700"," Just don't want to go sideways. "
"20719340","20720560"," What's up, pinky?"
"20726830","20727610"," Now, 318."
"20728210","20729030"," There's your power hour."
"20729850","20738910"," And I'm telling you, man, it looks bearish, bearish, bearish. "
"20739730","20742970"," Yeah, pretty much they do."
"20745690","20748350"," We need like a, we need a swift reversal."
"20751570","20752370"," Swift reversal. "
"20753870","20755930"," Three, two, we're going to look at this poor, even the clothes today."
"20758070","20758470"," Yeah."
"20762490","20763470"," Look at that shit, man. "
"20763690","20766170"," That shit is just begging to be sent to the depths of hell."
"20767830","20773350"," My, I'm not going to try to, I'm not going to tell a bull to buy a dip here at"
"20773350","20773490"," all."
"20775430","20777370"," Because it's not appropriate to do that. "
"20779050","20780110"," I'm going to do this."
"20780210","20782190"," I'm going to switch the program over to a kiss something else."
"20785250","20786910"," We're going to before the end of the day today. "
"20788350","20789890"," This is SPX, okay."
"20793610","20794690"," Fed funds rate."
"20799700","20800480"," Almost there. "
"20800640","20801280"," You see it right here?"
"20802040","20802920"," I want you to see this one."
"20803040","20804300"," This is back on 2006."
"20808280","20812400"," I want you to see my cursor line, how it's right where we are right here. "
"20813360","20814280"," And you know, it's fascinating."
"20815800","20820480"," If they just raised us like 50 BPS in this last March meeting, boom, there would be your pause"
"20820480","20821040"," right there."
"20824810","20826410"," Five, two, five right there. "
"20827710","20829050"," So there's check one."
"20831350","20833690"," And that's where the roll starts right in there."
"20834370","20837850"," So if you can see it, but your roll starts right here. "
"20837950","20840130"," Now, sometimes we squeeze up and then roll over."
"20841290","20841770"," Right?"
"20842030","20843550"," We've already started this role already."
"20845510","20847710"," Maybe it's a snap and cut rates immediately. "
"20849390","20850290"," We're already there."
"20850490","20850830"," You see it?"
"20851490","20854090"," Sometimes we squeeze up, but we already, we already began this."
"20854430","20856050"," This train's already left the station. "
"20856910","20861910"," Next one that's hard to see is right here."
"20863630","20865070"," This is unemployment rate."
"20866950","20869870"," See that small curl starting on unemployment rate?"
"20870550","20872490"," See how low we are, the bottom of it?"
"20873970","20876350"," They tend to front run the turn. "
"20878130","20879150"," Watch my cursor."
"20881090","20882850"," They tend to front run the turn, right?"
"20882850","20888530"," The front running, if they know there's rate cuts, if they know that we only have one more left, if"
"20888530","20891970"," they know if they do one more, they're going to break something, try to front run this shit."
"20892510","20900770"," If they see a real bottom in rates, sorry, unemployment rate, excuse me. "
"20904970","20906870"," Inflation starting to come down, right?"
"20908330","20909210"," And watch it right here."
"20910710","20912270"," Inflation coming down, you can't see this."
"20913330","20915130"," Let me see if I can get this where you can see it. "
"20918680","20922620"," There's actually two parts of inflation where inflation actually comes back up and then it comes"
"20922620","20925280"," back down, but it's already going down as they're front running it."
"20926100","20928340"," And you could see inflation at this point."
"20932820","20935000"," Come down, come up, and then come down. "
"20935240","20937140"," But this is matching up just fine as well."
"20939620","20942380"," And I want to show you the last two pieces to the puzzle here."
"20947720","20957440"," This is unemployment rate, this is the fed funds rate, this is down here"
"20957440","20958000"," is inflation. "
"20959560","20962780"," The last one I want to show you is these two right here."
"20963100","20966600"," And get rid of this one, get rid of that one, we're going to get rid of this one."
"20968320","20970100"," And we're going to make it really simple here. "
"20976880","20986670"," We're going to do just two, just two year yield, 10 year yield,"
"20986870","20987530"," new pain."
"20988850","20989750"," That's 10 year."
"20990450","20999760"," I think that, I think that was 10 year and this is two year. "
"21001580","21003640"," We don't have to do the two by the 10."
"21003740","21007220"," We'll just do the two, we'll just do the two of the 10 rolling over right here."
"21007820","21010080"," I want you to see this roll over right here. "
"21011400","21013120"," This roll over right here."
"21013900","21017660"," I want you to see the roll over right here and the roll over right here and the roll over"
"21017660","21018160"," right here."
"21021270","21023030"," I want you to look at it back here. "
"21025330","21027310"," I want you to see the roll over here."
"21027550","21028530"," I want you to see them right here."
"21028810","21029890"," I want you to see them right here. "
"21029990","21032110"," The rolling over of the market right here with the yields."
"21032710","21036050"," The yields don't automatically say the market's going to roll over."
"21036590","21040930"," When you start to combine the yields with unemployment, the fed fund rate. "
"21042790","21046210"," the bottoming of the unemployment rate and the rising of it."
"21047110","21048530"," The inflation coming down."
"21049390","21053310"," The Fed funds possibly being paused or one more raising of rates. "
"21055290","21061210"," When you look at that with the velocity in the market declining, even though price has gone up in"
"21061210","21066970"," SPX and SPY, when you're looking at that with the velocity, when you look at the fact that we're"
"21066970","21071570"," below the weekly month of momentum, when you start to add up these things, one, two, three, you see"
"21071570","21075150"," the cracking in regional banks, you start to add these things up."
"21079030","21081790"," And we've been talking about this since last year right in the stream."
"21082110","21091270"," So when you start to add this stuff up, when you start to add all this stuff up one by"
"21091270","21095910"," one and you're going, you're going, okay, look, it's all listened to a bear talk all day long. "
"21095910","21097910"," And I'm like, well, we're not there on this."
"21097930","21098930"," And we're not there on that."
"21099070","21099850"," We're not there on this. "
"21099850","21100810"," We're not there on that."
"21100910","21101610"," We're not there on this."
"21101950","21104050"," We trade this market until we get there. "
"21104890","21108410"," We are there right now on all of that stuff."
"21109430","21112570"," Not one, not two of four, not four of eight."
"21113710","21115810"," We're at like fucking 10 of 10 right now. "
"21118330","21119910"," 20 of 20 right now."
"21129660","21133120"," And now I'm showing you the macro stuff tied into all this stuff."
"21133280","21138320"," So if you look at all of it together, can we get a rip?"
"21139180","21139660"," Sure. "
"21142240","21144240"," Can we have a no landing scenario?"
"21144560","21144920"," Sure."
"21151740","21153340"," We can have a no landing scenario."
"21153600","21154040"," You want one?"
"21183780","21185200"," There it is right there. "
"21193100","21195720"," If you confirm this bottom, we start trading it up."
"21196260","21197200"," There's your no landing."
"21198140","21199700"," As long as you trade that, we're good. "
"21201780","21203300"," Start breaking below this stuff."
"21203500","21205480"," And I've already shown you how we can break below this."
"21205640","21206220"," I'm going to try. "
"21206540","21208160"," There's your no landing right there."
"21208720","21212760"," It's right there."
"21212840","21213740"," It's plain as day. "
"21215540","21219560"," And we already know that they're coming in right now trying to make this a no soft landing."
"21220220","21222700"," Trying to make this a hard landing to get us underneath right in here."
"21228390","21229890"," That's all you have to watch right there. "
"21229970","21231030"," You start breaking below this."
"21232570","21234470"," And there's fucking nothing holding it up."
"21235470","21240630"," And your next spot to hold it up in truth is 3,300 right down here. "
"21243190","21244150"," It's crayons."
"21244950","21245650"," Fairly easy."
"21269800","21270700"," God, I hate. "
"21270960","21271740"," I hate selling."
"21273760","21275500"," I hate it with a passion."
"21278780","21280080"," Well, I love it and I hate it. "
"21280140","21282980"," I love buying bottoms, but I don't like when the market sells off."
"21283100","21284480"," I don't like the destruction that comes with it."
"21286700","21288820"," It's like the paint, like the pain that you don't want. "
"21289520","21293220"," Like, all right, pull the pull that screw out of my foot."
"21295800","21299140"," Pull the tower out of my kneecaps when I rolled down the hill skateboard."
"21299780","21303840"," So right down here, we're in high danger right now is the point that I'm trying to make to you. "
"21305000","21309440"," There as we trade higher here, let's say we just try to trade it up to 393."
"21309760","21311920"," Trip 395 trip to 400."
"21312520","21315160"," They're just looking to just tee off in this market right now. "
"21316680","21317820"," That's what they're trying to do."
"21334380","21336440"," The AMC halt took Reddit offline."
"21344200","21345580"," Embrace it, embrace it, or bear. "
"21347340","21348560"," I just want you to know that."
"21348740","21350020"," I just want you to know that right now."
"21350560","21354800"," I've been telling you guys for six or nine months, like we need some shit to line up. "
"21354900","21356560"," It's fucking lined up right now."
"21358400","21359460"," It's lined up right now."
"21359460","21362000"," If we woke up tomorrow and I was like, we're down like 200 points. "
"21362120","21363220"," I'd be like, not shocked."
"21365000","21366160"," Not shocked at all."
"21367300","21370000"," And this is like weird because in price, we're at 390. "
"21370860","21373460"," Like on the surface level, this doesn't look that bearish."
"21373540","21374680"," It's like, ah, it's not so bad."
"21375220","21375640"," This is a low. "
"21375860","21377000"," We're going to buy it and go up and some great."
"21378200","21383340"," But there's real, there's real risk to our stock market right now."
"21384540","21391180"," That can't be, can be kind of seen with traditional charting, but not like some other stuff that's"
"21391180","21391840"," shown in the background. "
"21400250","21401770"," I'm reading you guys's comments."
"21402110","21402430"," They're hilarious."
"21402750","21404490"," You guys are like, why is cap so bearish?"
"21406650","21408730"," How many people we got watching right now?"
"21408730","21414150"," I'm going to see if any of the bulls have already logged out and said, closing my trading for the"
"21414150","21414350"," day. "
"21427400","21428880"," Paper hands, Mike Burry."
"21432220","21433720"," 150 on Twitch, so thank you."
"21433760","21435360"," Don't hang up on me because I'm not a bear. "
"21436060","21437020"," In any way, shape or form."
"21437160","21442120"," I just got to lay this shit out for you guys so that if it happens, you don't say, ah,"
"21442280","21443780"," fuck, he didn't tell us or something."
"21443780","21447360"," I know you guys are all like, he has to call it exactly. "
"21448320","21449140"," Or he's a failure."
"21451040","21454280"," So at least you know the shit that I'm looking at in the background."
"21455660","21457860"," This is the stuff that keeps me up at night time. "
"21463780","21465840"," Career low is like, I'm still long, baby."
"21469060","21469740"," What's the step?"
"21470420","21475720"," Well, right now the best, so the best part of this trade is that last chart that I showed you"
"21475720","21476400"," with the cross on it."
"21478040","21485780"," If you're able to take that trade, so the cool part about this trade right here is, ah, why did"
"21485780","21486360"," I get rid of that?"
"21486460","21487000"," Did I get rid of that?"
"21487080","21487400"," Hold on a second. "
"21489020","21500210"," The cool part about this trade is that a putback spread, putback"
"21500210","21503470"," spread would pay you if the market goes up here."
"21503650","21508750"," So putback spread, if it went up like this, it would pay for itself."
"21510770","21513770"," The put that you're selling would pay for the puts that you bought here. "
"21514810","21520350"," So if you like, dated them out like six months or nine months, all of it, like six or nine"
"21520350","21525650"," months out, the put side of it would pay that you ended up selling."
"21526810","21534270"," And then the put side that you bought would print the two puts and the putbacks by the ratio spread"
"21534270","21536090"," would pay down there."
"21536090","21543090"," Now, there is a place that you would get fucked, and that would be a sideways trade. "
"21547420","21550360"," If we just do this nonsense, this wouldn't pay that trade."
"21552140","21555560"," If we just do this nonsense, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth."
"21556300","21562700"," Now, normally even if we're doing this kind of a trade, normally you'll do a signal move above or"
"21562700","21565740"," below, so there'll be chances to get out of your trade if it's not doing it. "
"21566140","21570640"," But this is likely the path for until it happens when they front run this shit."
"21571140","21574400"," This is likely the path until they can get that last bottom in the trough that we're in."
"21574580","21578400"," We're in a trough right now, and we're looking for a capitulation phase at some point this year. "
"21579020","21580680"," But right now, it's set up to do it right now."
"21582140","21583600"," It's set up right here for it."
"21588720","21590360"," The trade is on right now. "
"21590420","21592360"," I can assure you that the trade is definitely on."
"21597400","21600160"," We'll see if we can set this back up again on this side here."
"21600560","21601680"," I'm going to delete that now. "
"21603100","21607300"," We'll see if we can set back this up one more time and see if we can get some kind"
"21607300","21608560"," of trade into the bell."
"21610060","21611720"," Same thing holds true right here."
"21611840","21612360"," Nothing's changed. "
"21613880","21616380"," We can get price above and a retest here."
"21617080","21619820"," We'll look to see if we can get this right here."
"21633240","21634740"," See if we can get this trade right here. "
"21634820","21638120"," This would be the confirmation right up here, right on this spot in a minute."
"21691420","21694520"," Yeah, I know, I just want you to know, I'm not telling you that's the trade."
"21694720","21695780"," I'm telling you that's the risk. "
"21696860","21697520"," Completely different."
"21698320","21699600"," I'm telling you where the risk is."
"21700260","21703460"," I'm telling you where the traditional charting patterns are. "
"21704120","21705660"," I'm showing you where the velocity is."
"21705880","21707080"," I'm showing you all these things."
"21707800","21709100"," I'm not telling you we're going to crash here. "
"21709100","21711200"," I'm telling you that it's all set up for one."
"21723180","21725780"," Don't say Cap Jim's telling you we're having a market crash."
"21726520","21729680"," All I'm telling you is all these things are there in the background. "
"21731040","21733200"," You need to know that they're all there right now."
"21735640","21737240"," Don't change this on me."
"21738040","21740620"," You guys are going to be like, oh, Cap Jim's over crashing tomorrow. "
"21763760","21764260"," What's up?"
"21765300","21766820"," Oh, man, the chat was paused."
"21769120","21769720"," Thanks, Winky."
"21772480","21775360"," Yeah, I don't want you to think that I don't want you to think that I'm calling for a crash. "
"21775540","21778300"," I'm telling just just laying it all out there for you."
"21780300","21783720"," So like when you see me say, don't get so bullish or you see me say, let's try to get"
"21783720","21784140"," the 390."
"21784140","21787600"," So I can put a hedge on when you see all this stuff. "
"21787880","21790440"," Like there's a reason why I'm saying this stuff to you in the background."
"21801210","21802190"," I spend all the money."
"21802370","21803110"," I don't bull man. "
"21803210","21803810"," I'm like the bull."
"21803950","21805010"," I'm as bullish as they come."
"21806350","21811130"," Even when I'm like, I want like, I'm like, I want Tesla at 52 so I can buy it for"
"21811130","21812510"," me to watch Tesla go to that price. "
"21812910","21814730"," I don't want to see that happen at all."
"21814790","21815510"," I don't want to see it happen."
"21816330","21817350"," Like hurts me in the inside. "
"21817350","21819750"," I'm like a, I'm empathetic."
"21825520","21827120"," Don't get all buried ever bulled up."
"21832670","21835630"," Squeeze and I are now trying to trade higher and get above that 389. "
"21836530","21838110"," We are now coming into a cluster."
"21839330","21844250"," Coming into a one, two, three, one, two, three trigger cluster here."
"21844770","21845810"," We can get above right now. "
"21845870","21846610"," I'm going to take some calls."
"21846630","21847990"," We can get above right here."
"21853210","21854630"," Clear that out right there. "
"21861420","21863540"," We're going to have March 15th."
"21864340","21865740"," No, those are too expensive."
"21867900","21880880"," 391 C's or $1.53. I'm"
"21880880","21882520"," in for $1.53 here. "
"21885910","21901090"," Now $1.57, $1.58. $1 "
"21901090","21915440",".56. I want"
"21915440","21918540"," to see a successful retest of this yellow box right here."
"21927190","21928910"," We can't hold this right here."
"21932630","21934450"," I'm going to cut the trade loose right in here. "
"21948440","21958250"," I'm going to move this box to the"
"21958250","21959750"," side so you can see it in real time."
"21974860","21978420"," We're fighting right now with this blue line right here."
"21978540","21979760"," This is the hourly trigger right here. "
"21988240","21990500"," Flat right now."
"22004000","22005480"," Pretty dangerous right here."
"22005580","22006360"," I'm going to trade them in. "
"22068950","22070890"," I'm reading the statement by Schumer."
"22076040","22079900"," I'm just shaking my head at the saver rattling by Schumer right now."
"22084950","22085950"," For a drone. "
"22088250","22089250"," Come on, baby."
"22092210","22093710"," Come on, one minute."
"22096550","22098310"," Last chance for bulls here. "
"22099290","22106710"," It's now $3.41. Bull's $1.5. We're going to see if they can win to $4.30 here."
"22115890","22117370"," Sit down, bag holder, Bobby."
"22119630","22122390"," You had your reign for the second half of the day. "
"22132810","22135850"," Yeah, I'm like, there's no need to be threatened."
"22136270","22138350"," I don't like Russia at all, dude."
"22138490","22139250"," I can't stand them. "
"22141310","22143630"," There's no escalation going on here."
"22144210","22147270"," There's not going to be an escalation over a drone shot down."
"22148470","22149710"," That's not happening. "
"22151970","22153550"," Save the saver rattling."
"22154950","22161570"," You don't need to save a rattle to the second strongest military in Ukraine."
"22163210","22164750"," We're not even talking the world. "
"22166050","22167130"," Come on, bulls."

"22295160","22296840"," I'm not here selling this shit. "
"22308140","22312340"," I got a limit sell on it at least just in case I get smacked the fuck down up here"
"22312340","22314100"," in this resistance above."
"22314360","22316460"," We're coming into sellers like right here."

"22369750","22371130"," $3.45 right now. "
"22371190","22373330"," Bulls have 15 minutes to pull it out of their ass."
"22373330","22375670"," They got a new high on that trade right there."
"22375770","22376710"," It could be a pullback here. "
"22376810","22377150"," Be careful."
"22377690","22379250"," You could see a pullback right here."
"22379350","22381830"," Just to check this right more, one more time. "
"22382550","22385030"," 15 more minutes for bulls right now into this close."

"22592100","22593480"," It's going to get crazy around here. "
"22593800","22598740"," You're going to see the market start squeezing iron or you're going to see the market roll over."
"22599420","22601480"," It's very dangerous right now in this market."
"22602100","22605700"," And you can see us right now, even into this close, the tension into this close. "
"22605700","22610140"," The tension into the FOMC and next week and the 22nd."
"22610260","22611160"," So show back up tomorrow."

"22681260","22684220"," Bull's winning a three trigger into the close. "
"22684700","22690800"," This is going to rip faces off, I think, into at least 4.15. You've got a three trigger hourly,"
"22691580","22692600"," minute, five minute."
"22692600","22694900"," Where is the top for the bulls?"
"22695420","22698080"," I'm going to give you a target up on high for the bulls here."

"22724580","22728200"," Bull's in control, currently into this bell."
"22729020","22732060"," The one thing I'm going to warn you of after this bell, I'm going to warn you of something here,"
"22732080","22732300"," okay?"
"22732760","22738080"," If you're a bull and you're long into this bell, you better be able to hedge futures. "
"22739920","22744860"," If price goes, look at that big, big, green giant bar right there."
"22744860","22749440"," If we trade up into this bell and this is closed right now, I want you to know that above,"
"22749880","22752800"," they're going to try to sell you in the overnight on ES."
"22753140","22755520"," I'm going to give you two targets on ES, if you're a Globex trader. "
"22756240","22760340"," If you're a Globex head hedger, I'm going to give you a place to hedge above."
"22760920","22770640"," The first number that you need to know is $3.962.25. $3.962 "
"22770640","22780490",".50. Next one, $3.95.25. Next"
