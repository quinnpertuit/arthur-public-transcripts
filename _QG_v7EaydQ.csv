"_QG_v7EaydQ","1030320","1034040"," you'll see a violent move higher and then we begin a massive sell-off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1034040","1038840"," uh... you look at this perspective of a sell side hedge fund"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1038840","1041720"," they're gonna stand out of the way"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1041720","1044280"," on a surprise right but get out of the way"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1044280","1049120"," and allow the initial market reaction to be positive"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1049120","1050640"," this isn't guaranteed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1050640","1053800"," we'll take anything they say is like this is financial advice"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1063720","1066480"," but my experience at least"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1066480","1070920"," if you have a rate of the rate shock today that's positive"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1070920","1073560"," sell side hedge funds step out of the way"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1073560","1076760"," markets going to explode higher"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1076760","1081360"," naming explode the s p five hundred is the most shorted"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1091240","1096160"," after the initial uh... while this is awesome sauce world everything is great"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1096160","1097800"," whoa who"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1097800","1101480"," uh... could roll right back over and become a violent move"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1105560","1107560"," have seen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1107560","1109640"," so keep that in mind"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1109640","1114320"," another rate shock would be fifty bps"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1114320","1116320"," fifty bps we i have seen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1116320","1120320"," events like that you'll see an event like that and uh... one of the key"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1122520","1124480"," if something like that occurs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1124480","1129760"," is uh... instead of just a move lower"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1133840","1136880"," you usually figure these things out quite quickly"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1136880","1140080"," if there's a rate shock let's say there's anything that's like bad"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1140080","1142280"," i mean like bad"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1153480","1157480"," not just see it a drop to just below"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1157560","1161560"," the implied move you actually see a smash through it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1161560","1164480"," sometimes you'll see below below the implied move"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1164480","1166800"," a fake-out and then a smash through it"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","1169200","1170920"," and this is really key here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1170920","1173760"," is does it or does it not recover"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1173760","1177320"," if it doesn't recover turns around something like this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1177320","1180400"," that's usually really really bad"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1180400","1183280"," uh... it doesn't recover you'll typically see"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","1183280","1185800"," uh... violent moves violent moves all the way down"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","4153480","4159480"," Admit all the Tesla bulls are just pumped right now."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4159480","4166480"," Tesla bulls trading on a one, two, three, four trigger cluster right now. They're sitting."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4166480","4169480"," Testables are sitting on."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4169480","4177480"," Probably the most bullish place they could be right now."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4177480","4184480"," If you're looking for a dip to buy in Tesla, as long as it doesn't break that one eighty six could be a bullish."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4184480","4189480"," Well, it could be a trap, but it could be a very bullish outcome for the bulls on Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4189480","4193480"," I'm sure they're all talking about it. They're all getting hot and sweaty."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4193480","4197480"," You can see that bullish consolidation forming up."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4197480","4205480"," They want to see rip face rippers higher. If you are in a trade on Tesla, just note that one eighty six."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4205480","4208480"," It needs to hold."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4208480","4213480"," Now that breaks below briefly, that's not breaking below."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4213480","4218480"," Let me just bring up Tesla one more time for the testables."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4218480","4224480"," The desk testables can see this. So, talk Tesla real quick."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4224480","4232480"," Tesla on the daily looking bearish. See that? So this is an indication."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4232480","4236480"," Saying that we're not actually bear our bullish here. We're actually bearish."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4236480","4243480"," The hourly starting to roll over here to starting to look bearish."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4243480","4249480"," So, though, Tesla looks bullish here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4249480","4257480"," On the outside of everything. Let me get rid of some of this stuff here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4257480","4262480"," On the on the facade of Tesla, Tesla looks extremely bullish."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4262480","4268480"," I will say to you that momentum is saying otherwise."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4268480","4272480"," Momentum is saying that Tesla is going to."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4272480","4277480"," Price is going to break below one eighty five one eighty six."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4277480","4283480"," And it can continue its move lower. I want you to be aware of this because."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4283480","4286480"," If you're long right now, Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4286480","4290480"," You need to see for the for your trade to be dead."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4290480","4295480"," You'll want to see price not only break below this one eighty six."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4295480","4300480"," But reject. So, just be just be conscious of this."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4300480","4305480"," The rejection trade is where it's at for you. So, let's say you're long Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4305480","4310480"," And Tesla breaks below briefly and you start panicking and you want to sell."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4310480","4315480"," Oftentimes you can wait for the rejection trade to then get out of your trade."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4315480","4318480"," For the for the for the move lower later on. Okay."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4318480","4321480"," Now, if it breaks below and it comes back up."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4321480","4324480"," No problem holds its pants up and continues higher."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4324480","4327480"," You can then reenter the trade in here. So, if you're long Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4327480","4332480"," There is no problem being long on the outside. At least it looks fine on the surface."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4332480","4335480"," Tesla looks like it's consolidating for an extreme move higher."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4335480","4337480"," If you're any longer here, I get it."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4337480","4342480"," Just know that if you break below, you can always wait for wait for a retest."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4342480","4347480"," Get out of your trade and then wait for a move higher consolidation."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4347480","4350480"," Maybe even maybe even a recheck to go higher here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4350480","4358480"," Just be careful in here. There's some underlying stuff saying that Tesla is weaker than it looks on the surface."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4358480","4363480"," It's just down here. Not completely weak, but not the best either. See it right here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4363480","4367480"," You really do want to see Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4367480","4372480"," Velocity here start to move higher."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4372480","4374480"," I'm going to show you that."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4374480","4380480"," I want to start seeing some yellow bars here just for confirmation bias that we're going to trade higher here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4380480","4383480"," You don't want to see like this start to develop on the downside,"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4383480","4388480"," especially on FMCD. Start to see this stuff develop here in a breakdown in Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4388480","4392480"," You have normal waves in Tesla, right when you trade in Tesla."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4392480","4396480"," You can actually see if it's not too hard to see."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4396480","4401480"," Trading below, trading above, trading below, trading above over here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4401480","4407480"," And it's not quite bullish yet. You want to kind of see, you kind of want to see like some development here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4407480","4410480"," You kind of want to see this develop."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4410480","4415480"," So another way to look at this with Tesla would be in price."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4415480","4419480"," You want to see the confirmation trade take that long right there."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4419480","4423480"," You want to see it test and then make its move."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4423480","4427480"," And then you're set up with a trade long and you take it there."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4441480","4447480"," Yeah, price target above on Tesla, as you already know, is like $242."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4447480","4458480"," You have a speed bump above on Tesla at $223.26 and then $240 and change above."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4458480","4462480"," And if you were to measure that move, you know, we're going somewhere higher, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4462480","4469480"," You know, we're going to like $300 and then we're going to $350 and then we're going to go kill some,"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4469480","4472480"," some shorts above at $400 at some point, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4473480","4476480"," That's a lot of work ahead for testables out there."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4476480","4478480"," That's that no landing."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4483480","4485480"," Kelly's old school setups going on in here."
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4488480","4490480"," All these old school setups going on."

"_QG_v7EaydQ","4672240","4677320"," ECB's this goes as credit growth has stopped in Europe the most important thing is to avoid a credit crunch"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4682400","4687240"," ECB's Panetta says banks will pass on rates more than in the past. I take partnership. Do you think or no?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4693840","4697880"," Yeah, I would have to stop streaming on YouTube wouldn't I I forgot about that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4699800","4703600"," Yeah, I remember that I forgot about that I have to bail on YouTube I"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4705760","4710200"," Heard of some you know some people are doing as they were doing two streams that they say that I could get"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4710680","4714080"," Someone people were saying it could do like a second camera setup"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4714720","4717200"," with a second instance of streamlabs and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4717520","4722240"," Just separate both of them and they're both now like what cameras on one side of cameras on this side"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4722720","4725440"," And then it is two streams technically you get away with it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4726040","4728040"," then some other people were saying that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4729160","4730240"," the"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4730240","4732240"," the language is vague"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4732480","4733440"," on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4733440","4734440"," exclusivity"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4734440","4738680"," Then other people were like well you try fucking around there. You'll find out I guess won't you?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4739040","4741040"," so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4744480","4748120"," We can also monetize YouTube and people could sub to you there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4751720","4754120"," Hmm you haven't thought of that either"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4755240","4759960"," The whole I haven't done any kind of monetization. Well, you know, it's funny too is that I did um I"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4761320","4766080"," Did the I went through the Amazon affiliate program for books like the books that you see there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4766400","4771320"," And I got kicked out yesterday because I didn't post the links inside of the website"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4772200","4774080"," So I have to like post them on the website"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4774080","4780320"," But the funny part is the amount of time that it took to be approved as an Amazon affiliate"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4780320","4782320"," I have to go back to the entire process again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4783720","4788200"," And then I looked at what I made on Amazon Prime for the books. It was like a dollar 50 or something"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4789840","4791840"," In total"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4792120","4794400"," So I was like this is even worth the time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4795160","4797160"," Probably not"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4803160","4805160"," Probably not worth it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4816320","4818160"," Yeah, the answer is clear don't take it. Yeah"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4819840","4821920"," Yeah, I agree with the partnership stuff"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4822920","4830480"," Well, that's what some people are saying I watched a couple videos on YouTube and some people are like, I don't take the Twitch partnership"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4838120","4840800"," Yeah, Joe I was gonna send I was gonna have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4843480","4846760"," I was gonna have Mrs. James send you those links"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4846760","4851120"," I haven't talked to everybody yet. She's gonna be upset cuz she's the one that actually did that work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4851920","4854280"," I have to go tell her. Hey, you gotta read read do all this stuff"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4854280","4858240"," And then I want you to send these links to uh to Joe post"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4863560","4867400"," Yeah, I agree with Winky here though Twitch is ultimately better for streaming"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4868640","4873600"," I'm gonna agree with you Winky. I have to say that if you guys if you're on YouTube"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4874240","4876240"," You got to give Twitch a chance"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4877320","4879880"," There's some real positives on Twitch they"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4880840","4885720"," Well, there's some some things I don't care for right now. They don't save your videos"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4886080","4889000"," So that it would add an extra layer of work. We'd have to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4890040","4894840"," I'd have to record each live stream and then post them to our website"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4895360","4896920"," to store"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4896920","4899960"," Right because right now they only save six days worth of videos"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4901480","4905720"," And then so we have I think we'd have to figure something out to store our own videos"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4906680","4913480"," On the website, I guess and I think maybe that changes as as time or if you get enough subs or something"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4914360","4919200"," Maybe they let you keep them on there longer, but the storage is an issue YouTube's like hey, we'll keep whatever you want"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4920200","4922200"," Which is kind of nice"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4922480","4925680"," But the twitch functions are awesome"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4925960","4930280"," Like twitch like the the functions that they have you can like remove a screen remove the chat"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4930280","4935080"," You can play it in the background while you're doing something else you can just listen to the audio"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4935720","4941800"," And then just watch the chat. There's a lot of options on twitch at least that YouTube just doesn't have functionality"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4941800","4946240"," I guess a lot of a lot better interaction that kind of stuff"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4948640","4950640"," But you did"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4952280","4957160"," Okay, so they can't watch them so my on my end it says it deletes my videos after six days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4959040","4963560"," So I'll have to find out why it says that right now it says six days they delete videos"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4964560","4966560"," That's what it says at least"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4969200","4971200"," Maybe I'm just maybe I'm just reading that wrong"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4979200","4987880"," Is it a time limit setting yeah, I don't know for sure on the back end what I see is your video will be deleted after six days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4989480","4991480"," Or it won't be saved any longer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4992480","4996720"," And I don't I don't know the answer repetitively I'm still extremely new"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","4997760","5000760"," To twitch it's like going to YouTube for the first time ever"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","5726760","5731400"," Is it worth the extra cut they take I get if you don't make much off of subs and members"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","5759360","5766720"," That's working on the background because we pay so much out to you PayPal to twitch to YouTube. You're like the split is insane"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","5767360","5770840"," So at some point the subscriptions will just move over to our website"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","7364400","7366240"," It's on man"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","7380160","7382160"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7383680","7385680"," That's a mute book map"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","7393040","7395040"," So xlf"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7397440","7399440"," Let's look at xlf"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7402240","7404560"," Uh worth at least paying attention to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7406160","7408160"," So xlf um"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","7428800","7432080"," On xlf the one thing i'll give to xlf is this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7434240","7437200"," If it can hold here and it's hourly it has to hold here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7440640","7445360"," It's worth paying attention to just keep an eye on it here 31 71"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7446480","7450320"," It has to hold you want to see the one in five minute get under here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7451200","7453200"," Kind of give it a lift up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7453440","7456800"," Uh, so we'll look at and we'll look at this in a large in a larger time frame"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7460880","7465840"," So just on a larger time frame even for all the bearishness doesn't want you to pay attention to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7466800","7469760"," Is you know you have extreme bearishness and xlf right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7472560","7475920"," I just want you to look right here and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7476880","7480880"," Uh the way that xlf has been moving and you can see right here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7482960","7486320"," You know it starts to become bearish and then we get a nice little lift up, right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7487120","7489120"," See how we come up here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7489360","7492320"," And if we can see any kind of great a gun validation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7493120","7497600"," And power trading after strong profits last year according to the cei"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7498240","7500240"," Could see"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7501760","7504320"," You know this might take some time, but even so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7504880","7509600"," Like it's a bottoming process. So just don't think i'd say to you what an xlf would be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7510640","7512640"," Even though it looks extremely bearish here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7514640","7518720"," Uh, you can see we have a higher lows on velocity"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7519520","7521520"," Pay attention to it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7521840","7523840"," Um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7524160","7527200"," You ever see this consolidate here and we don't break below"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7528400","7531920"," Uh that that we're right here this 31 72"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7532560","7534800"," If you can see any kind of consolidation here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7535520","7537520"," And you can see this daily coming down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7538160","7540400"," Uh, finally you can take price above"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7541120","7543360"," I'd be interested in above 32 bucks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7544320","7550320"," And worth at least watching here at least worth watching if the if the hourly the daily come together"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7551120","7554320"," And so if this if this the hourly comes together with it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7556960","7562800"," With this daily here and price starts to move our it could be looking for a pretty significant squeeze"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7564480","7567280"," It's the monitor monitor xlf here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7571680","7576000"," Could be could be some bottoming action in xlf even with all the bearishness on it right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7577840","7579840"," And so if we're looking at xlf"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7580480","7582480"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7585840","7590960"," So for all that bearishness and xlf, um, not at no interest in consolidating below"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7591040","7593680"," So what like if it if it starts the trade down here?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7594160","7599520"," I got no interest in it. I got no interest in catching that knife either. Um, if you look on a"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7600960","7602960"," Five day chart on it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7604960","7607120"," We got no interest in catching knives down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7607760","7609920"," Uh, and I got no interest in this down here, but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7610560","7612560"," With that being said"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7628880","7634800"," With that being said this is constructive it doesn't look constructive I bet to you, but it is kind of constructive"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7635120","7637760"," Uh the one thing here and xlf would be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7640320","7642320"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7647120","7649120"," 33 75"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7666320","7668320"," 31 75"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7670320","7676080"," There is a trade in here if it stays above"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7678320","7682720"," Now if it breaks below it's bad news. This is like bad news down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7686160","7691600"," And there's some really vicious daily coming down here. So my point here is that, um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7695440","7697680"," 33 70 yeah right up in there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7700400","7704720"," Uh, if they can kind of try to get back up in here and though daily can come underneath"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7705840","7708320"," Oh, there might be a retest down below here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7711440","7715200"," No guarantees in this trade something to watch over time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7716080","7718080"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7728960","7732320"," If it can hold its pants up here something like this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7732320","7734320"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7743120","7746560"," Now if this starts breaking down here right the the trade is dead"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7748560","7753440"," Uh, I have no interest in catching knives down here. I would be interested if it can show itself"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7753520","7756240"," You know it comes back down retest and then maybe take it this trade long"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7756880","7760400"," To get up here now some kind of rejection because of the daily coming down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7761200","7764400"," Right and then daily would sweep underneath the hourly would come up underneath"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7764400","7768400"," Then you'd have the white and the red line right here and possibly pick this back up over here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7769200","7771440"," So xlf at least it's at least worth watching"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7772800","7776400"," Now if we have a bad day in the market with Jerome all bets are off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7779280","7782880"," All bets are because this can go the other way this can go it's gonna become a yeah, fuck you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7782880","7786000"," We're out of here. We're going way down to the depths. No, we're gonna print 20 bucks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7787040","7788960"," Because there is a target down below at 20 on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7789760","7794720"," On xlf, but just be aware of it. No, there is a bull's trade in here somewhere"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7797120","7799120"," On xlf"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7799360","7804880"," Now bulls need that too, right? Bulls aren't gonna get higher without that trade developing over time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7811600","7814800"," Coiling nothing going on in the spy right now no movements at all"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7815600","7819280"," Uh, it's now 1156 we have two hours until"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","7892240","7894640"," There's a larger trade chase above"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7896320","7902480"," Uh, what like once we once we consolidate and get above the early in the daily. There's a there's a huge move higher there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7903440","7905440"," It's gonna take some work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7909200","7912800"," Paul closes at 1250 right on brother. No, no, I'll leave it going man"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7914160","7916160"," I think 1250 is great"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","7916720","7920800"," I think my only concern was my only concern between now and then would be"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","8183440","8188960"," The fed is expected to hike 25 basis points. You can expect the fed chair to say banks are well capitalized"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8189280","8192720"," And talk for having to leave this time. I'm gonna take a five-minute break. I'm gonna go potty"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8193600","8198480"," I'm gonna grab uh do I need to grab anything for this and he might and this is the key here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8198480","8200480"," Probably some more water"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8200480","8205120"," Future move it is in the guidance where all the actions like you to be in markets today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8205120","8210320"," And there could be some sharp reckoning in those markets depending upon what the fed decides and what fed chair"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8210640","8214960"," Powell says here the market is priced in the chance. I saw that mr. Talking monkey"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8215760","8217760"," Eddie temple layer cake. I like layer cake"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8218400","8221520"," So there could be sharp rate movements for a market that is priced right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8222000","8224000"," There's the 440. Yeah tea"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8231040","8237440"," 37 with the question also of stocks are begging and cuts and they're unprepared for a fed that still sees itself batting inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8238240","8240240"," In the year ahead. He's gonna be listen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8240240","8242240"," Let's don't be right back in me five minutes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8242480","8250560"," And how much concerning expresses about the potential for the recent bank turmoil to drag down the economy growth and reduced inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8250560","8255600"," That is how much of the feds go to reduce inflation is accomplished by the banks, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8256720","8258960"," Steve stick around we know you got a big meeting at two o'clock"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8259040","8262800"," But uh, we want to stick or have you stick around so we can balance a couple things off you really quick"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8262800","8266000"," I want to bring in the committee right now Liz you're sitting right here to my left hand side"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8266240","8272240"," Um steve broke out some numbers 83 percent chance of a 25 point hike 17 percent chance of no change at all"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8272400","8274400"," What camp do you fall"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8274400","8280240"," Uh first of all, I don't think we can separate monetary policy and financial stability at this point after the events"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8280240","8283760"," That have occurred over the last couple weeks. I think they are now hand in hand"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8283760","8287760"," And they're going to continue being hand in hand until we finish this rate hike cycle"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8288800","8294720"," Steve is absolutely right that we usually come into these meetings with a pretty clear idea of what we're expecting"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8294720","8298880"," I think 83 84 percent is still pretty clear of a expectation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8299760","8303200"," What's going to be the risk and I say this every time that we have a fed meeting"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8303440","8309600"," I mean it even more today the most dangerous time to trade the market is between two and two 30 p.m. Eastern time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8309760","8313680"," You get the data at two you get the dot plot at two you get the economic projections at two"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8314160","8319440"," He starts talking at two 30 and almost inevitably we reverse whatever that first move was"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8319840","8325920"," So this is a time where we literally have to sit on our hands watch it happen listen closely"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8326560","8330560"," I think that probably there's an excuse to do both things"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8331440","8336560"," What I would say the responsible thing to do here is to pause say that we're waiting for more data"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8336880","8338960"," Leave it open to possible hikes later on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8339200","8345360"," Find out if this does have as much of a disinflationary effect as they're expecting and then do it again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8346000","8347760"," I don't think that that's going to be the case though"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8347760","8352320"," I think he's got clearance to hike by 25 because of the rallies that we've seen over the last few days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8352480","8357280"," All right liz young 25 point hike wait and see approach to trading until at least after two 30 eastern time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8357520","8359200"," Joe turn over where do you stand?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8359200","8364880"," Well, I agree with liz the market has given the federal reserve the opportunity to raise by 25 basis points"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8364960","8365920"," That's clear"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8365920","8370560"," Uh, I still go back to the experience of the orange county bankruptcy in december of 94"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8370960","8375440"," Federal reserve raises one more time after that then by the middle of 95 they're cutting rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8375760","8378800"," I also believe that the rally that we witnessed in the market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8379360","8385840"," Now introduces an element of surprise which previously didn't exist in the last several days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8386320","8391600"," Now the surprise is if the federal reserve is far more hawkish than we are expecting"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8391600","8397120"," Then you will see a dramatic impact on the market and obviously a negative one for that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8397440","8399440"," um, but what they should do is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8400160","8406320"," Really sit back and pause. I think as I said the other day they're going to be credit criticized in either direction"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8406800","8412000"," If he raises 25 he'll be called john claudreshet if he does nothing he's arthaburn"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8412000","8415760"," So he's going to be criticized in either direction, but I think"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8417120","8419520"," Can I ask joe and liz who are?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8420000","8423040"," Arguing for a pause and in my presentation just a minute ago"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8423040","8426320"," I talked about the potential and I don't know that's going to happen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8426800","8434240"," For the fed to ratchet up the outlook for 2023 to 537 guys even to that three bar chart in the back that I used earlier"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8434640","8435680"," That's a potential"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8435680","8441200"," It wouldn't take only a couple votes to to go that way and I just want to know joe does the market freak"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8441600","8446960"," If the fed goes the other way and said instead of a pause it really says we're going to do more this year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8447680","8450720"," Yeah, that's that's the surprise steve. That's the hawkish surprise"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8451280","8453280"," Given that the market has has rallied"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8453840","8459280"," Four and a half percent for the nasdaq and the s&p basically 3 percent the last five days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8459360","8464080"," The market is not prepared for that. I also think what it doesn't do is remove the most"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8464640","8468240"," Important condition for the market and that's the interest rate volatility"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8468720","8472720"," How do you relax the interest rate volatility? That's really significant"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8473200","8479120"," Last point on all of this is understand the stress in the mortgage back security market right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8479760","8481040"," that is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8481040","8482320"," extremely"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8482320","8483440"," intense"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8483440","8488640"," Silicon valley bank has 58 billion and nbs that if they want to raise liquidity they're going to sell"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8488800","8491200"," So they're going to sell alongside the federal reserve"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8491520","8498880"," How is the federal reserve at this meeting going to address that the need to sell nbs to raise this liquidity at a time where the federal reserves"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8498960","8503840"," No longer the marginal buyer for these mortgage backsecurities because they want to sell with them"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8503920","8507600"," Right. Give me one second while we still have steve leece and we're going to lose him in just a few minutes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8507840","8513040"," Steve leece man. I just want to run on your point for a second about possibly the the fed continuing its rate hike strategy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8513120","8515600"," I know there's five new voting members this year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8515600","8521280"," They all move with the fed for less than a year are those the wild cards you're talking about that might lead to this outcome that a lot of people aren't talking about"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8521440","8525040"," I think there is a potential wildcard. We got five freshmen voting this time around"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8525120","8532080"," We've got a bar and cook a jefferson on the board appointed by biden and logan from dallas and ghoulsby"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8532080","8534000"," They've all been with the fed less than a year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8534320","8538560"," They've all been at the fed during a time when we didn't really able to answer the question"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8538880","8544720"," Are they hawks and does because everybody was a hawk inflation was high the fed was hiking aggressively wasn't any question"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8545120","8548240"," Now there might be a question on the other side of that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8548640","8550640"," Business that we don't know and there could be some"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8550720","8556080"," Uncertainty about either the vote today or the dot plot today or speeches in the future"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8556080","8560160"," Whether or not they're more concerned about the disinflation or the impact of the banking system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8560480","8563360"," There's also powell who is by the way"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8564160","8568080"," Statistically he is mr. Consensus. We looked it up today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8568480","8574560"," And there have been fewer dissents on a percentage basis with powell than there were under greece man bernanke and yellin"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8574560","8577600"," I don't know the number of votes, but it's only three percent"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8577600","8583120"," That's half of what it was for vernanke out of which means he will change the statement or do what he has to do"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8583200","8587520"," Probably to keep more people on board. So there's a lot going on behind the scenes. Give us"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8588000","8590800"," Give us a second. Let's get over to steve wise and give us like five more minutes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8590800","8593440"," I know you got to get out of here soon. Give us five more minutes. We want to get your reaction"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8593920","8596720"," Somebody I don't think anybody calls mr. Consensus steve wise"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8598560","8600560"," Please please stick around"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8607600","8613520"," Believe if they don't go 25 the message that they send is that hey, maybe these banks are in trouble"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8613600","8615600"," This dream is sponsored right to the tick"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8616080","8618080"," Get free danny's"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8625680","8630640"," Rising prices, so I think they do go but the message will really will be in the dot plot"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8631040","8633040"," So what is that going to tell us?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8633120","8637040"," That's what you've got to look to and I do believe that feds got dual mandate"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8637200","8643040"," Which is employment and inflation so they're going to pursue their policy along that now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8643040","8646400"," They're also responsible for the financial health of the banks, but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8647280","8649280"," I don't believe that's an issue right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8649280","8655280"," You have two notorious examples one principle one would still come valley bank a poor risk management"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8655520","8661520"," It's not up to the fed to make the policy decision based upon their risk management"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8664000","8666000"," So I think that they go ahead"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8667200","8673440"," Right, I think it's kind of absolutely that in six months the feds can start cutting rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8673600","8680080"," It's usually a year a year after last increase. So that's my view. Hopefully I didn't disappoint you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8681040","8686000"," Steve why she never disappoint me. Steve Lee Smith. Are you so happy down there in DC? I am still here, sir"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8686400","8692080"," What's your take on what Steve? Why you said to say um, he's saying inflation insidious and that's what the fed has to make"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8692080","8693680"," It's never one priority"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8693680","8696400"," Yeah, well first of all, I wouldn't call the market pricing asinine"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8696400","8701440"," I would call it confusing and and perhaps not correct in the sense that you look at that rate outlook chart"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8701440","8705840"," And you see those cuts built in. I'm not sure it's there. It's the right call here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8706320","8710160"," Um, but really what it comes down to is two things that we don't see"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8710880","8713760"," We can't see the flow of money in the banking system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8714240","8717840"," Powell can see that if he sees that there's money still fleeing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8718320","8723600"," The regional banks or some of these other banks and going into he might be more concerned than we are right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8723680","8725760"," Because he's seeing that flow of funds right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8726160","8733200"," The other thing is that we don't know what the ultimate impact is going to be of what people expect to be tighter credit standards"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8733360","8739440"," Ultimately, Steve that is a disinflationary impulse to the economy. It has always been less lending"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8739440","8742400"," It might mean by the way higher interest rates for your loan"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8742880","8748240"," But that also means less borrowing and that could mean fewer jobs and less inflation down the road"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8748320","8751840"," So we don't know that he's gonna have to take a gamble with that that he can deal with that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8752240","8754480"," Later when it appears and not preemptively"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8755280","8756080"," Steve, it's joe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8756080","8763280"," So on the surface the debate ranges 25 basis points or a pause but the real stress is on balance sheets"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8763680","8766480"," How does the federal reserve chairman address that?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8766800","8770080"," How does he address my concern with mortgage backed securities?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8770480","8776720"," Do you think that he's going to give us any guidance on what he may or may not do with the balance sheet as we move through this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8777200","8780800"," So joe, I'm not sure that this solves your problem with mortgage backed securities"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8780800","8785120"," But remember the fed is offering you a one-year loan at par not you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8785840","8793840"," Offering banks a one-year loan at par for your mortgage backed security right at the one-year OIS spread plus 10 basis points"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8793920","8797040"," Is the rate so it's like four and seventy four eighty something like that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8797040","8798800"," Maybe a little bit lower today because of what's happened"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8798800","8804160"," But any event you can take that that on your balance sheet you can finance it for a period of time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8804480","8808320"," That removes the the concern on your balance sheet at least for now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8808880","8810880"," um, I think that he"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8811200","8817840"," Takes the information that he has about what's happening in the banking system tries to overlay that on the system joe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8817840","8820560"," I don't I don't think he's gonna he's gonna panic here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8820640","8825120"," And I I don't know what to do with steve's idea about you don't want to show panic look"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8825520","8830640"," If the house is on fire you call the fire trucks no matter what it shows about what's happening inside the house"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8831600","8835280"," All right, steve lease when we got to leave it there. It's been a good time not a long time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8835280","8838400"," We know you got to make your way over to the fed. Thank you. It's always for joining us"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8839520","8844160"," All right, so steve wice. I want to come back over to you. You're saying inflation is the number one thing they have to tackle"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8844160","8846560"," This dream is sponsored by it takes right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8846560","8849840"," We know takes right now is you to actually hear what is played which is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8849840","8851920"," Borrows and still future with the media"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8851920","8858080"," Get a free trial. I just picked right go to go for about the house on fire isn't the house smoking at least right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8858640","8860640"," I don't believe it is but but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8860800","8866640"," Obviously pows a lot more for for inform than steve than anybody here because he's seeing the actual flows"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8867040","8871680"," All I can key off of is what we've seen so many bank"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8872080","8875600"," CEOs come out and say we're picking up deposits. We know that's true"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8875920","8880800"," We can see that that the equity market has rallied back providing some comfort"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8881040","8885360"," Because while the fed doesn't care about the equity market people do when they hear it every day"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8885520","8888400"," Well, the doubt finished up high arrow microsoft's up another 3%"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8889120","8891120"," So then that gives them some comfort"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8891520","8894880"," So my bet is that you don't see a disaster"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8894880","8902320"," You don't see stresses in the bank system and that the fed gets back to or stays on course with inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8902480","8904480"," Now, of course the palace seeing something different"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8905440","8913120"," Which he could be although I ascribe a small chance that then they should pause right because you don't want more runs in the financial system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8913280","8918960"," But where are you gonna go? You can go in treasuries. We saw big moving treasures saw rates which thing rates move back up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8919520","8925280"," Right, so the 10 years move back up. So I still think it's focused on inflation and I going back to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8926080","8933120"," Cutting rates in six months. You don't want that to happen because if that happens that means the economy has gone into more of a tailspin"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8933680","8936960"," Right and the fed has to react by cutting rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8937280","8939840"," So and I don't think that's gonna be the case so that tailspin met up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8939840","8947120"," We're not the only one putting it out there JP Morgan's Marco Kalanovic using that same kind of unsettling metaphor saying a soft landing now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8947120","8951680"," Looks unlikely with the airplane and a tailspin and engines about to turn off Liz Young"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8951760","8956480"," Are we at that point right now and if so is a 25 basis point hike is that the answer?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8957520","8963920"," I don't think we're in a tailspin now, but I disagree with Steve in the sense that I do think that there's smoke coming out of the house"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8964320","8966320"," These analogies are gonna drive us all crazy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8966320","8967440"," but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8967440","8972160"," Look at it may be the case that we don't see more headlines of the same nature"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8972320","8976880"," Right of the deposit fleeing nature. It may not be that it's regional banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8976960","8983600"," But I do think that this was the beginning of exposing what is a universal problem for the market and for corporations right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8983680","8989200"," Which is liquidity and the fact that we sucked all the liquidity out of the system very quickly on a number of different levels"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8989600","8992560"," And the market moved very quickly in response"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8992960","8996960"," So this liquidity issue I think will continue to show itself in different ways"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","8997280","9003680"," Look at things like high yield spreads right up a hundred basis points just in the last couple weeks because of what's going on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9003760","9005360"," So for a long time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9005360","9011360"," I've thought that there's some sort of credit event out there whether it's companies trying to refinance debt that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9011680","9015120"," Was taken out when rates are very low and they can't quite make those ratios anymore"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9015200","9017200"," I don't know what the next big headline is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9017680","9021840"," But I feel confident saying that I don't think we've seen the end of the headlines"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9021920","9025040"," I just don't know that it's going to be the same type over and over again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9025520","9028240"," I still think they will have to cut not for a good reason"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9028560","9031040"," But I think they will have to cut before the end of the year maybe not three times"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9031280","9033520"," But I think we'll see at least a 25 basis point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9034240","9038720"," Bring it all back to the equity markets. That's why I continue to be bearish"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9039120","9043280"," There's everything you've said everything steve said everything joe said right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9043840","9046400"," Whether it's liquidity crunch when there's smoke coming out of the house"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9046880","9053440"," All it means that earrings going to climb that the market p e is unsustainable and is and actually"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9053760","9060720"," Is sort of ridiculous that you've seen multiple expansion in the face of truly declining economy with best best case"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9060960","9064720"," Believing that poll which I don't believe that rates will be cut in six times"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9064720","9071760"," How do you explain the resiliency though in the equities market with all the negative news all the negative events of the last 10 days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9072240","9075680"," It's it's remarkably surprising how strong we are"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9075760","9082080"," You know, I think there's a lot we don't understand how the smart check one's whether it's the increasing of alga's whether it's that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9082400","9085280"," That index funds on more than 50% of every equity"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9086160","9089200"," Um, just don't know. I mean it just doesn't trade on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9090000","9093040"," How we all grew up in the market on fundamentals"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9093600","9096720"," Fundamentals satiable appetite that's bullshit too"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9097120","9100400"," On the single data point in a certain bullshit"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","9248640","9250640"," And we're seeing it right now come out of the news"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9252960","9254240"," And"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9254240","9258240"," With saying that that post that I made this morning, there's this weird setup"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9259840","9261840"," That's been happening in the background"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9262800","9265280"," Uh, it's important because we're creating"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9266400","9268400"," Not just a surf class"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9269200","9272160"," If you have a class of surfs being created right before your eyes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9273760","9276720"," The agreement with the fed has been broken"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9278800","9280800"," I'm fighting inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9281280","9286240"," Uh fighting all kinds of nastiness out there right that came from covid"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9288320","9290320"," And"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9290400","9295840"," We had an agreement with the fed right in the treasury department. We're gonna fight this we're gonna fight that we're gonna break this gonna break that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9296800","9298800"," And all that kind of stuff"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9303360","9307600"," And the fed balance sheet we have erased"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9310560","9312560"," All of that work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9313120","9315120"," All that work has been erased"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9316800","9319360"," Uh to to backstop basically"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9321280","9323680"," Banks that legally took on more risk than they should have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9324640","9327360"," Banks that were these are regional banks, right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9330080","9332080"," Uh, these banks also"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9332880","9337200"," These babe these banks also had what exposure of up to 65"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9337600","9341920"," Rather than the traditional banks only having 35 40% exposure, but even then"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9342880","9344880"," We're better positioned than prime banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9345840","9349200"," Uh to put money in savings to actually buy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9350160","9355680"," Bonds when rates went higher, they could have even backstop themselves. They didn't they took the money and ran"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9358560","9362640"," Prime banks have more exposure right there. They're already they're not in some way. They already have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9364080","9366800"," 60 to 65 of their bank backed up by people's"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9367360","9372960"," Pre-rates increasing so they have a lot of maneuverability these these regional banks did and they didn't right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9373680","9376080"," Now they didn't do further back stopping"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9376720","9382080"," For themselves did they said fuck it? Well if it burns the burns will start over again. We'll let the fed help us"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9383440","9385680"," And you know the background over the past year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9386960","9392080"," You know that some people are gonna get get fucked in this you know that uh the poor people are gonna get fucked"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9394160","9396160"," But it's even worse"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9398800","9400800"," Because now you've broken the agreement"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9401760","9407040"," With everybody there's no more participants on equal right the banks are holding hands"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9407600","9410400"," Stock markets hold hands poor people are holding hands"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9412160","9417760"," They backstop these regional banks and they basically know that these prime banks are fucked as well"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9420160","9423600"," And so now they're stepping in right now to protect rich people golden parachute"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9424640","9427280"," Meanwhile in the stock market, what are they doing?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9428160","9430400"," They're protecting the stock market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9431520","9434400"," And they're saying we're gonna protect 401ks for you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9435120","9437120"," And so if you're rich"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9437520","9441440"," If you're a stock market participant if you have a 401k you're safe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9442400","9444400"," But who's getting left behind right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9445600","9451040"," Is there's gonna get left behind and ultimately fucked is a poor person. They're going they're doomed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9452000","9455840"," And doomed on a level the fleecing of the united states of america"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9456320","9459680"," I don't think it's ever been as apparent as it is the past two weeks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9460320","9464960"," There it's being front run the fleecing of the poor in this country"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9465600","9468160"," Now I know that you out there think that you're not a poor"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9469360","9471360"," But you likely are"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9472000","9474400"," You likely don't make more than a few million a year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9475760","9477760"," You likely have a mortgage"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9478160","9480160"," That it was a second third mortgage"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9480480","9483920"," Yeah, you not all not likely but a lot of you out there. You likely have bills"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9484000","9488720"," You likely have all kinds of credit out there. You likely have a wife or a husband and kids"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9490400","9495440"," System is built for that and I guarantee not guarantee but a lot of you probably will live paycheck to paycheck"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9495840","9497440"," above your means"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9497440","9499840"," And even you are one step away"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9500720","9502960"," Well after being kicked out of this class"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9503840","9506640"," That seems like they're gonna make it with their 401k with their house"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9507360","9514320"," They're they're like above a poor person but in reality as time passes your risk as this unfolds"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9515040","9516160"," um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9516160","9519520"," Risks you to be kicked down into becoming a renter"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9520960","9522960"," Blackrock is betting on that as well"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9524320","9528960"," Uh that that's going to happen to you. So you might think that you're not a part of this class of pours"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9530000","9532720"," Well, but more than likely you are and if you watch the"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9533680","9536800"," The range of who's poor and who's not in the difference"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9537920","9544000"," And who has wealth and who doesn't it's vastly it's it's that the disparity is just growing and growing by the year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9545200","9550560"," And when you see 25 of all purchases going to investors this year, that is insane"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9551920","9556640"," Now you'll see some people out there saying yeah, it's where there's coming coming housing crash. Fuck. No, there isn't"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9557440","9559520"," There's a coming surf class"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9559520","9561520"," Of people that make enough money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9562160","9564880"," Uh out there, but are still part of the pours"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9565600","9567760"," They're not actually as rich as they think they are"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9569920","9571920"," And even today this decision"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9573280","9575520"," By the fed is basically saying to you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9576240","9579760"," It's basically saying to you this base saying hey look this is what we're at right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9581680","9583680"," Uh we protected the banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9584400","9586960"," And we're gonna protect you the 401k holder"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9587600","9589840"," Seems like your housing is okay"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9589840","9592640"," And we're gonna protect the stock market. We're gonna fuck the pours now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9593600","9595600"," And the truth is this agreement is broken"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9596640","9601680"," The truth is that you're now going to be told not you but a poor person real poor person people think they're poor"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9603280","9605280"," Are basically going to be shoved down their throat"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9606640","9608640"," We're not all in this together"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9610880","9614960"," And you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna be dealing with inflation longer than you expected"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9615440","9618720"," You thought you were gonna break this down between 2023 and 2024"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9619440","9623360"," Sorry, buddy. That's out the window. It's now five to 10 years"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9624720","9631200"," Oh, and sorry, buddy. You thought we're gonna cut rates. That's now five to 10 years. You're gonna get rates. You're gonna get inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9631920","9636960"," If you don't think you're gonna see a spike in inflation off of what they just did this past two weeks, you're insane"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9638000","9640640"," It's insane to think that we're not gonna see a spike in inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9642080","9646960"," You can hear all the the talk today and the jabber and the blah blah blah and all this kind of stuff"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9647440","9651920"," You can see that the fed's fund rate is looking is saying hey, we're gonna cut rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9653760","9655360"," Now in my view"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9655360","9659280"," The only thing the fed can do is either start cutting checks for people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9659920","9663600"," And that sounds crazy, right? Like checks for poor people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9664480","9670080"," Here's your bailout while you deal with inflation, but that sounds crazy, but they're not gonna do that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9670880","9678480"," So you're hoping as a market participant that they're at least gonna bail out the stock market with a rate cut or a pause, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9679120","9682240"," And market participants are like, yeah, if you won't get it today, we're gonna get it the next time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9682240","9685840"," We're gonna get it at least by the end of the year, but the truth is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9687200","9689200"," If you even want to keep that contract"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9690160","9693920"," That we really are fighting inflation even though we're backstopping the banks when it fuck the pours"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9694720","9698560"," That means it's gonna be rates for longer. There's no other solution to it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9700080","9704240"," Just in commentary from so you're either going to accept there's a bank's are seeing many defaults"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9704640","9709360"," Not seeing many defaults at present their credit losses. It can happen with a lag. They do know though"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9709600","9713440"," You're gonna either accept higher inflation. You're gonna accept"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9714320","9716320"," worse living conditions for longer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9717280","9719280"," Or we're gonna pump this shit to the moon, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9720240","9724640"," There's no way out of this. There's there's no way for you for you to argue that way out of this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9725200","9728080"," And ultimately who's gonna get fucked to the poor people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9728880","9734640"," The already poor people that make like 40,000 60,000 90,000 the crazy part here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9735280","9738880"," Is that you're creating a system of services a system of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9740080","9742080"," Surfed them"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","9744880","9746880"," We're gonna chat about that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9747760","9751360"," Uh that thing because to me, you know, I don't normally get angry about this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9751440","9755760"," And I wasn't even angry about it into a week or two ago last thursday"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9756720","9758880"," Not this past thursday the one before that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","9759840","9764960"," You know like last week on twos and we're all like yeah, it's felt like we've been trading a week and it's only tuesday, right?"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10014400","10019200"," There are so many companies that came along in the last like eight years or so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10019760","10021040"," to allow it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10021040","10023040"," Allow you to easily"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10047840","10054000"," So you can buy these smart breaker boxes. I can totally see a world where basically they decide, you know what?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10054720","10058800"," I think we should turn everything as a service, especially in a rental"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10126400","10127200"," Um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10127200","10130240"," When you have more homes than than real people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10131280","10138240"," I mean, I live in Georgia, which based on that uh that document or the the link you sent this morning you sent out"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10138560","10142080"," You know, we're number one. Yeah, we're number one. So we lead"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10143040","10147600"," Cool, uh in uh in large corporations owning all of your houses"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10149520","10153840"," And you know, it's evidenced by that where my where my house is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10154960","10159200"," Uh around me the the homes generally sell for you know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10161280","10166880"," Between between seven yet. Well between about 700 and a million plus"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10167840","10172640"," But every home in my area is this generally is this pre-covid"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10173680","10175840"," No, this is now. Yeah, okay. Okay, all right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10176960","10178960"," so um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10178960","10184480"," Every home in my area now is that is available. You can't buy them none of them are for sale"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10184960","10188400"," Because of the same problem of we've discussed on twitter that is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10188960","10193600"," Almost 40 percent of all mortgages in america were originated between"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10194560","10200720"," Or the current mortgages were originated between 2019 and 2022"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10201200","10204000"," So everybody's got like a mortgage at"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10204640","10209760"," Two and a half three percent in my area. So they're not going to sell while we're at six or seven"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10209840","10214160"," No, and then all of the homes that are being sold at this point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10214320","10219440"," Uh, there's really something wrong with them like they're they're for sale and they've been for sale for a long time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10219840","10223840"," And that's the reason why they're still available. So there's no real home inventory available"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10224000","10228800"," So if you want to move into my area anywhere inside of my school district or within"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10229440","10232000"," You know say 20 miles of me"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10232560","10239760"," You're a renter and you're not a renter in a home in most cases the the homes that were bought by individuals and are being rented"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10240160","10245920"," They're all occupied. So the ones that are coming online are in neighborhoods that were built to rent"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10246240","10248560"," So in my area, there are a lot of homes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10249200","10254240"," That are built to rent new homes for rent is the sign in the front of these neighborhoods"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10254960","10256000"," And"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10256000","10259360"," You look at these homes. They are four and five bedroom homes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10259840","10261680"," Two and three car garages"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10261680","10266560"," They're renting for five thousand dollars a month and you have no option to purchase them"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10267040","10271440"," And that's what they're doing. They're building them there. They're building them near my offices right across the street"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10271920","10278160"," There is a town home community. You can't buy them. They're renting for 3500 bucks a month"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10278800","10280800"," And welcome to the neighborhood"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10280880","10284640"," And this is this is very rural part of the Atlanta area"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10284960","10288800"," And so I don't have a good perspective on the markets around the country"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10289040","10292240"," I travel a lot, but I don't you know look around for homes a lot"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10292400","10296720"," But if it's anything like this, this is an unsustainable situation for"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10297520","10300640"," You know for people that no one's going to be able to ever own a home"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10300960","10302080"," And in this event"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10302080","10303920"," Yeah, I think I think you're making a good point here is that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10304320","10310000"," Unsustainable for people not for the people that own these houses. I mean, I'm gonna say something when I moved here to Detroit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10310720","10315600"," I could buy a house from anywhere from believe it or not 1500 bucks to 2025 30"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10316160","10320240"," And on the back end renovating these houses and then trying to sell them"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10320560","10323440"," I was able to flip for like a hundred hundred and fifty thousand"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10324000","10329840"," Increase the the uh cost of a home here in the Detroit city area, but it's all changed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10330800","10331920"," Now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10331920","10338720"," It's no less than 20 to 30,000 to buy and then the renovations are now costing minimum of 130,000"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10339280","10342320"," And then you're automatically like i'm going for a hundred percent markup on these things"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10342880","10348320"," So you're like uh 200 250 in a place where a home used to go for"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10349120","10354720"," You know at two decades ago a thousand bucks and you're talking about just an artificial automatic price increase"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10354880","10357360"," Michigan in that report had 25"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10358320","10363680"," Uh of all new home sale all all home sales in this state this year was 25"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10363840","10368800"," We're doing investors and the investor boom here is relentless has been pauses, but relentless"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10369360","10371440"," Um, and then the oh they'd give it up on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10372080","10377520"," They've been giving up on home sales here in Georgia. They they were like screw this. We'll build"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10378400","10381520"," Yeah, there's like a force like we we're not taking anything less than this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10382000","10384320"," Going on here right now. So it's like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10384400","10389600"," Rapid rapid and even even when you're not going to sell let's say you don't find a buyer say hey can you buy this this price?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10390560","10392720"," You're then saying well, fuck it. I'm just going to do rentals"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10393200","10398480"," And i'm just going to charge this amount of money will be the same as a mortgage for someone buying this and those renters are there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10398560","10401600"," And this leads into the next question the important one for you joe is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10402640","10408800"," So I was like i'm gonna get out of when I got out of michigan now i'm like, eh, you know, maybe i'll keep keep some of these homes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10409600","10411760"," Because I don't know about my own children"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10412400","10414800"," Are they ever going to be able to price into something?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10415280","10421680"," Do i have to leave them a home so they can either occupy it or they sell it to buy into that class they can't own a home"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10422240","10429440"," Uh five years or a decade from now, right? We were talking about what's your thoughts on that? That like, yeah, I mean"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10430240","10432240"," Kids"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10432400","10434560"," It's it's an inflation thing right so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10435280","10437280"," Just look at look at the"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10443600","10447680"," In a way that it hasn't for generations and that's causing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10448320","10453840"," Um, you know, that's that's causing the asset class of a home"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10454480","10459760"," to inflate beyond the reach of many people even with what would be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10460800","10465840"," Before say before covid would be considered a good paying job"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10466400","10468720"," Like let's say you get an engineering degree and you get paid"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10620480","10626560"," Five plus percent you're unlikely to be able to own a home save for a down payment"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10627040","10628800"," uh, you know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10628800","10633760"," Raised kids fixed cars like all that stuff and then and then save for retirement"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10633760","10636800"," There's no way to be able to do that. So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10637760","10639680"," That was before"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10639680","10646480"," This increase in inflation and you know while we did have wages growing for the first time in a long time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10647280","10654000"," During the covid pandemic because it it forced businesses to have to compete for you know for"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10654960","10659120"," Employees because it you know right now. We're at basically effectively zero"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10659840","10665360"," Unemployed it where we are. I mean everybody wants a job. There's multiple jobs for that person"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10665840","10671680"," Out there in the market and so they'd have to be competitive. I just can't imagine if I was if I get out of college"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10671840","10675600"," I just met this guy the other day. My wife was looking for a new piece of furniture for my kids"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10676480","10678480"," And this lady had a really nice"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10699680","10701840"," And they're kind of in this weird place of being stuck"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10702560","10707280"," Uh in in like this this moving up and how much money do they need with their debt"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10707840","10710240"," to uh move up and in class, I guess"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10711040","10716880"," Uh, and I just wonder about if somebody regular out there with a normal like let's see have a liberal arts degree and you're not making 90 grand a year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10717760","10722720"," Uh if your parents aren't going to give you something, how do you even start to enter the housing market?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10722720","10728400"," How many houses are left at 150,000 250,000 even at 250,000"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10728960","10734960"," Uh, you've got carloans school loans all this like you're buying a you're buying a house at 150,000"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10735040","10739600"," That needs a hundred thousand dollars worth of renovations to feel safe and enjoyable living"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10739680","10745440"," So, you know, that's the reason why they're you know, the the rental market because they have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10747760","10750000"," Hold on here. We're still having some some issues here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10763680","10766320"," You know, that's my thing is if it now we're not talking about"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10767120","10774320"," We're not right now talking about kids or adults without talking about you as an adult or you you being 30, 40, 50 years old"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10774880","10779200"," Talking about this young generation these uh, they'll say they're 10 years old or 15 years old"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10780320","10781920"," 18 years old"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10781920","10786400"," But what do they need uh to make it in life? I guess quote unquote"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10786400","10789280"," I guess I know a lot of you don't want to but I got a mind being a renter"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10789280","10791840"," I like being this or I like being that like being mobile"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10792400","10797920"," Uh, I know that 50% of people under 30 years old live at home with their parents. That's a known fact"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10799360","10801360"," Then the question becomes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10801360","10803360"," Well, I mean just check and see if he's back or not"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10804640","10806640"," Nope doesn't look like he is"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","10838400","10840400"," See if he'll join us here in just a moment"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10840400","10847840"," No, that's that's a key question here and this this leads into today's fed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10848960","10851760"," Fed it tastes fed rate hike"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10852800","10855600"," discussion from the fed from chair pau and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10856480","10859840"," What is he doing right? How do you come back from saying we backstop banks?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10860000","10862800"," We're going to continue to fight inflation with 25 vps"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10863360","10865680"," And means we know we're all going to leave people behind"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10866480","10868800"," You know, so if he comes out there today and says to you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10869680","10872000"," If chair pau comes out there today and says to you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10874400","10876400"," There you go, you're back, baby. You look handsome"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10877040","10880960"," If she goes back to you though and says i am going to keep fighting inflation. We're gonna backstop the banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10881120","10885760"," We want you to all accept this and you see right now your 401k is they're safe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10886240","10888000"," uh, but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10888000","10890000"," We're we're gonna keep fighting inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10890560","10894480"," That target date if you're out there looking and saying to yourself well, they're gonna keep fighting inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10895040","10898000"," Uh, we had targets of 2023 and a 2023"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10899360","10902960"," My assumption here is that you're now looking money many years ahead"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10904640","10906640"," I yeah, absolutely"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10906880","10908880"," the"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10909520","10916160"," I mean, I I hate it because i'm looking at it and you and i both have young kids and we look at it from the standpoint of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10916720","10921520"," You know, we're when when our parents were where we are"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10922480","10925200"," The dollar was worth over double what it is today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10926080","10932400"," And if we're and it's it's only reduced in value relative to the assets you want to buy with it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10932880","10937280"," Uh, it's only it's only gotten faster and I don't see with the fed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10938240","10941600"," Positioning and and signaling how it plans to deal with"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10942240","10944720"," uh, the current monetary problems we have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10945040","10951440"," It's obviously going to continue to print and when they print money it debases the value of what you have or what you've heard"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10951920","10953840"," And and we're going to just keep doing that. So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10954400","10958000"," Um, that's why when we were discussing your house is what to do with them"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10958400","10960800"," Realistically the houses that you hold"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10961680","10968960"," Um or the property that you hold or whatever hard asset that has pricing power as inflation continues to grow"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10969440","10971440"," Those types of assets"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10971520","10973520"," Not a sale vote not a sale vote"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10974000","10978880"," Um, but those types of assets will will be basically a coin"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10979680","10986800"," In the game that will increase in value as you know, it you know, if if a dollar is only worth 50 cents"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10986880","10989120"," Then now your house is worth two dollars"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10989520","10992720"," Like that's just the way it is because those assets will be safe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10993360","10995360"," Or at least safer than"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","10996000","10999680"," Then paycheck to paycheck or cash you're earning each each month"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11000400","11002400"," So you just lose all power"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11003120","11006800"," If all you have is a paycheck a paycheck will has"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11007440","11010640"," Historically never kept up with inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11011600","11017840"," I don't know any other way to um, give my kids a leg up. I'm trying to think of some other way to be like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11019360","11022720"," You're not going to be fucked. It's the only thing that I can think of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11024480","11029520"," Uh to try to give them any kind of a future the where we're careening towards is is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11030400","11034480"," Like you're saying like uh as years pass even even if thousand mark comes down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11034560","11036560"," It still doesn't come down again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11037600","11039600"," To some level that's reachable"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11040720","11048080"," I think I think that large corporations have learned the stability that housing can add to their portfolios"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11048880","11054480"," In a destabilized monetary system, which ours is now and is getting worse"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11055120","11059920"," Um and is you know, basically guaranteed in the future to only get worse and worse"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11060320","11064400"," So they have learned that housing is a great stabilizer because"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11064960","11066400"," housing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11066400","11071440"," The the cap rate of housing is great and it gets even better as"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11072080","11075840"," As money becomes worth less and less if you bought it in the past"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11076320","11081600"," So buying housing now is a great way to protect yourself on the in the future"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11082080","11084080"," Because you know people are going to be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11084720","11089280"," In dollars terms poorer in the future and having to pay you more"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11090080","11096000"," Of their monthly income just to be in the house that you and now we're extending the inflation fight"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11096400","11099360"," Which props up the house market for even longer doesn't it? Yeah?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11100160","11101680"," Absolutely"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11101680","11106720"," I mean, I hate it because like all the people anybody in these in this stream that doesn't own a house"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11106880","11108880"," Would want to in the future"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11109040","11110240"," Right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11110240","11112240"," It already may be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11112320","11116160"," Too late unless you change the way that you earn money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11117120","11125280"," unless you change that that method or do a a real like I could a job to take another job at a"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11126080","11129280"," At a high factor more than I'm earning today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11129360","11132400"," Like if you're just getting cost of living adjustments at your current work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11132880","11137920"," And you work there for 35 years the chances of you ever getting a breakout amount"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11138480","11144320"," Raise so that you can actually accrue enough money for a down payment on a home"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11145040","11146320"," Is very low"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11146320","11150960"," Not only that that's just the truth that's just the way that we were discussing you and I were discussing what the"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11151600","11156080"," Mortgage insurance taxes and then having to keep up with that over time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11156480","11158720"," You know we're talking five six thousand a month, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11159200","11160720"," and then"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11160720","11164880"," forbid anything bad happens to you if not let's say nothing happens to you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11165440","11170720"," Uh, no no no roadblock to you. You don't get hurt. You don't get a something tragic happen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11171280","11176000"," You don't get I don't know a sister that needs a medical care anything you can think of out there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11176480","11179840"," Even better is still only working to that to that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11179840","11183520"," I'm going to retire and I just made my mortgage off and now I'm going to use this money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11184080","11187600"," For my late care and later in life for my kids. I don't know what they're going to do"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11188000","11189840"," So even if you're there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11189840","11194880"," What do you gain like how hard is it for someone to own something tangible?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11195680","11199040"," It's extremely hard. Well, it wasn't hard"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11199920","11203360"," That's the reason we're where we are today. It wasn't hard"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11204560","11206560"," in 2020 and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11206560","11211600"," 21 and some of 2022 like it was proves every year like I own something"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11212240","11215600"," I don't own any money on a radar even if I have mortgage. I've got like a hundred grand"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11216080","11218960"," 500 grand and in real equity in a property"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11219920","11224720"," I mean, I think I think that everyone realized everyone that has power and control"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11225120","11233360"," Realized how dangerous it was to give the keys to the the masses with interest rates as low as they got"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11234240","11240960"," Because a lot of people figured it out. They realized that when you can borrow at effectively"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11241760","11247280"," You know zero plus two percent or one one and a half percent whatever the banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11247680","11250960"," Wanted to make in addition to the origination fees"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11250960","11255120"," They made originating loans on commercial real estate or housing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11255840","11258000"," like those"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11258000","11263040"," That that level most smart people knew that that was a limited time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11263440","11268000"," And that we were going to not stay at zero. They came out. We're not europe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11268080","11272160"," They came out of getting fucked over in 0708 right? Well, a lot of these people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11272720","11274720"," They knew they got screwed in 0708"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11275280","11279680"," And once they had that's what I noticed. I noticed a lot of these home buyers were like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11280000","11283280"," I remember what happened a little bit about a decade older than me and they're like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11283920","11286400"," We I went through all this and now and even two decades"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11287040","11289200"," People that are older same thing. They know exactly"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11289840","11291840"," Scoop it up while you can"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11292240","11294240"," Knowing that we're gonna end up wind up here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11296560","11302240"," Absolutely, and so what is that what happens this next generation is my question. I don't know that we have I think it becomes a chase"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11303200","11306960"," That that you can never catch up from but you heard elon say that too, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11307360","11312560"," That everything will become a service one day for most people you're gonna pay for services and vehicles"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11314640","11319840"," Stuff in your you will and it will seem it will seem like a deal at some point like right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11319920","11323360"," We're we're in it's kind of like the market before the fomc"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11324160","11328240"," It's just it's spiky and crazy. It'll level out at some point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11328240","11331760"," But when it does it's going to level out at a level higher than"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11332960","11336080"," the the like comfort or where you can feel comfortable"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11337280","11339040"," being an investor"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11339040","11344480"," And then you'll feel like you're in a good place by making a payment that is lower"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11344800","11348480"," But the payment that is lower means that you have to work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11349680","11351680"," Forever yeah"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11351680","11353680"," And when you stop working"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11354160","11356160"," When you stop working"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11356160","11359040"," You you are out you you cash out of the system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11359680","11364800"," And then you are no longer valued by society and because of that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11365840","11370560"," You know, you're gonna end up where america is a service where we're"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11371360","11377600"," Where freedom is a service you have all the freedom you can afford today if you don't pay you're out will evict you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11378160","11380160"," and now you're a"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11411520","11414400"," wound up in the 80s for people that were blue collar"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11414880","11419680"," That's where we're headed for in the 2020s and 2030s for white collar"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11444880","11446640"," the idea that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11446640","11451680"," That we in in america are going to end up like the uk has been given to me by two people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11451680","11459040"," I know that live in the uk where very few people own homes and all the homes are effectively owned by a group of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11459920","11462880"," larger companies that that lease and rent homes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11463520","11468160"," And flats in london and the major larger cities in the uk"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11468640","11469520"," um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11469520","11477040"," And that's just the way that it is but they went through that in the 1970s and 80s when they were kind of going through and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11477920","11481600"," getting rid of all of the government owned industries"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11482960","11485200"," When they did that there were there was a lot of"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11499520","11504160"," But my buddy that was living in the uk he married this lady from london like her family"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11505280","11508880"," Her family was pretty wealthy and they did not own the home they lived in"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11509360","11513760"," Um, they leased it they they leased a house that had an orangery"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11513840","11518640"," And i don't even know what the hell that is but they had one in there. So it's like like this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11519360","11524400"," There was a solarium and an orangery and like all these crazy rooms we don't have in the u.s"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11742000","11745840"," It didn't quite close that gap. There's a tiny little time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11745840","11748400"," You might be able to see the screener here, but there is tiny little gap"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11749120","11751120"," to failing banks"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11789280","11795840"," Shortsighted it just it's all shortsighted everything everything's about political expediency right now"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11814960","11819200"," What do you think uh, I guess people are really interested not so much"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11819520","11824080"," I want to know your take on do we get zero two point two five or two five bps"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","11848720","11851440"," Well, I mean, I think I think the Jerome pal"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11852880","11855840"," Probably like I just picture him kind of like uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11856640","11862480"," Like an old if anyone remembers the old s and l skits with steward smiley where he likes sits in the mirror"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11862960","11865600"," And he looks at himself and tells himself he's good enough"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11866080","11868800"," He's smart enough and gosh darn it people like him"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11869280","11872000"," Like I feel like that's j pow right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11872560","11879040"," Like he's gonna raise 25 bps because he said he you know, he didn't say it was pause time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11879840","11883200"," and I think he realizes that he he needs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11884000","11886240"," he needs to raise to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11887120","11891680"," I guess to to wring out the last bit of credibility in the fed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11892880","11894880"," But in the in in the end"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11895600","11901760"," Raising is just it's just doing the doing you know doing the doubles work about crushing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11903040","11908240"," You know you and me because he's gonna raise rates. It's gonna make it harder for people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11908880","11911280"," That need money and need loans"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11911920","11916800"," We're gonna keep inflation. We're not gonna raise enough to stop inflation. That's for damn sure"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11916880","11920240"," Especially not while we're expanding the balance sheet as we raise rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11920720","11922960"," And erasing half of the years worth"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11923520","11931280"," Uh, or ever since we started cutting or started raising we're raised 50 percent of the balance sheet reduction in one weekend"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11931600","11934640"," Yeah, so at this point we are going to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11935600","11940480"," We're heading towards what I I was talking to you about I was like the minute I read about it the first time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11940480","11944960"," I was like holy shit. That's exactly what we're gonna do. We're going to have a no landing landing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11945760","11949920"," We are going to we are going to continue to squeeze"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11950640","11952640"," Rates, which is gonna hurt"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11953440","11955440"," You know hurt everybody"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11955440","11957440"," We're going to continue to have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11957760","11959360"," inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11959360","11961360"," We're going to crush"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11961360","11967200"," Main street. We're going to crush wall street and we're going to ultimately bail out the banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11967600","11973440"," That's what I think we're doing. I think we're going to crush everybody and then they'll dip in and save the few"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11974880","11976880"," Institutions that they feel like they need"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11977200","11980880"," Yeah, if you if you were if you make your living off of other people's money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11981760","11984880"," Uh, you already see it right if you go out to a restaurant or whatever you see"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11985680","11988480"," Higher price food you go to get a service you go to get"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11989360","11993760"," Hard goods all those costs to them are being passed along to you as the poor person, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","11994480","11999920"," So if you're a landlord if you're a um, you know, whatever you're doing to make to make it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12000320","12003280"," You're going to pass all of those costs down to the poorest the poor"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12003680","12005680"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12005680","12009280"," Yeah, I mean the so if in a no landing scenario"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12010080","12011920"," We we we we push"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12012560","12016400"," We basically try and push the economy to grow through"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12017440","12025360"," You know through a lab. I mean obviously not not raising rates too much yet going with 25 basis points or then maybe pausing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12026400","12029440"," Which is going to allow inflation to go nuts because as you've seen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12030160","12035520"," You know any any expansion of the fed balance sheet and the markets goes crazy, which is great"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12035840","12041280"," That's wonderful, but it doesn't fix any of the underlying problems. So we leave the cancer down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12042080","12044880"," Right and we just we just punt"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12045520","12051360"," to the end of the next election cycle and then we're going to crash this economy so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12052000","12053760"," um if we don't"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12053760","12055760"," if we don't do something now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12056560","12059600"," the the problems are harder later and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12060000","12065040"," I think that the fed is basically signaling that they are going to listen to the requests of their"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12065920","12070560"," You know their handlers in congress and they're going to say yeah, no, we're going to crash this fucking bitch"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12070800","12072800"," but we're going to do it later"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12072800","12074320"," not now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12074320","12080080"," And that's where we're headed. How do you think it works out politically and how it affects the market?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12081520","12083520"," Uh, I think"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12083520","12088160"," We're going to fail out your foreign k we're going to fail out the stock market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12088720","12093280"," Because we need them to be we need them to be our partners here to some extent even though it's not"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12093520","12097440"," Let's say let's say apple sells from 160 to 125. You're still kind of safe, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12097920","12104080"," So you're like yeah before okay is at least steady. It's not it's not at 80 bucks or 90 bucks or 60 bucks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12104720","12109920"," Uh apple in my portfolio. It's at 125 like even right now at apple at 160"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12110160","12114000"," It comes back down to 130 125. What have you lost? Nothing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12114720","12117200"," Right, but what do you think politically happens?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12117920","12120880"," Uh if they say today, he says they were going to keep fighting inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12121520","12125040"," And we're going to build the rich people. Do you think that has implications?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12125680","12130080"," Well politically, uh, maybe even the market down the road into election season"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12131760","12135600"," Yeah, I mean at this point we are we're"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12136160","12138640"," Whistling past the graveyard. I think that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12139600","12145760"," I think the the average joe on main street still doesn't fully understand what's going on"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","12372320","12377600"," Um, this is an ongoing conversation. Isn't it's been developing. Oh my god. It really has"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12378480","12384320"," From back when I was a happy happy ball, you know, like we started this conversation way back then"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12386800","12388800"," There's a squeeze happening right now in the spy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12389280","12391600"," Uh bears are gonna want to watch this cross over here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12391680","12394960"," This is your place above where you're going to look for this squeeze higher"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12395520","12400000"," And see if the bears can take us down into the hourly and daily trigger down below here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12400960","12402960"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12403600","12404800"," What's that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12404800","12407280"," Did you trade your one-minute trigger to yellow?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12407600","12413280"," No, I added in a five ema for the five-minute chart just a six ema"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12413520","12416480"," Okay, so the five-minute charts so I could just keep track of it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12416960","12418480"," On bull"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12418480","12422000"," Timeframes people we're trading the one-minute live and I was like this ain't working people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12422480","12424480"," We're gonna slow this down for people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12426080","12428080"," Slowing it down we're gonna slow down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12429840","12432320"," You'll see it here. We switch back to this one-minute chart"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12432880","12435280"," Well, this this white line is the yellow line"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12436240","12438240"," on the five-minute here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12438240","12442880"," And so in a one-minute chart, they're just teeing off the one-minute and five-minute on a one-minute chart"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12442880","12447040"," They're just teeing off right here, and you'll see this if I switch back to the five-minute"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12448640","12450640"," Just teeing off right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12452800","12458400"," Just tee it off and this looks like the the only bottom that's here in the market at least on book map"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12458880","12462640"," Uh demand hasn't shown itself in any any lower numbers down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12462880","12465680"," It's just showing itself right now right with that yellow boxes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12466160","12470960"," Now we'll look for a squeeze higher to three ninety eight thirty three as this bearish crossover happens"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12471680","12474560"," Now this is not the norm right as we head into this fomc"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12475200","12479440"," Uh, this is not the norm that we see right around 11 30. We usually see a squeeze higher here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12479760","12485120"," We saw it early this morning at 10 15 not at 11 30. You're seeing the"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12485760","12488240"," uh risk off appetite into"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12488880","12494960"," Uh, the fomc rate decision. It's 114. We've got 46 minutes left until the news is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12495600","12501360"," Uh dropped on us. Maybe this is a maybe this is some kind of a precursor someone knows something that we don't know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12506240","12511280"," You know the other the other thing I I'm worried about is that when you and I were talking about"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12512000","12515520"," How the fed would raise rates to stem inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12516480","12518480"," Early on like last year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12519760","12523360"," We were talking about the fact that obviously you have to get"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12524160","12526160"," You have to get the fed funds rate"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12526640","12528640"," Above the rate of inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12529280","12535920"," For it to beat inflation and that a failure to do so would mean we would just have to go back"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12536400","12540880"," Several times to the well and start raising again. And so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12541520","12546960"," Um currently the reason that's another reason why I say we're going to do 25 and because we're not there yet"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12547280","12550560"," And pal knows history and knows that the only way"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12551120","12556160"," That you get inflation to really get under control is either to bring inflation down, which"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12557040","12563920"," We're just not doing that or raise rates above the rate of inflation, which voker showed works really good"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12564560","12566400"," It's not pretty"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12566400","12572080"," But um, we are not there and pussy putting around it and just sort of edging"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12573360","12580240"," You know edging towards it is never going to get us there because inflation is kind of like uh, it's almost like a magnet, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12580640","12585920"," Like the closer you get to it with the rate it doesn't just magically come down to you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12586000","12588800"," It's like having opposing magnets. It's going to push it up too"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12589280","12592160"," You just got to like jump over it and push it down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12592640","12596480"," But how to do it without absolutely taking the economy and being blamed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12597200","12600480"," Um, there is in a way. Do you think really is in a way?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12600720","12603120"," Do you think that uh, you have the voker moment?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12603120","12606160"," So people have a vocal moment, but there was the first time voker attacked"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12606880","12610640"," Inflation and then he had to come back later on and actually hammer down on it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12611200","12617360"," So i've heard some talk of we're at that first voker moments where they they let inflation come back and rear its ugly head"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12618000","12621920"," They kind of just took that took the head from being dunked underneath the water"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12622000","12625680"," The apple dunking and said breathe for a minute before we dunk your head again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12626320","12632080"," Do you think that we're there maybe where do you think we get the dovish fed not like 25 bps"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12632240","12635360"," Please let us beg and plead to keep fighting inflation yet"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12636080","12640240"," Uh, we're gonna we're gonna let the market or at least the banks breathe for a minute here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12640240","12645040"," Or do you think you know, you know, I understand like maybe re-tighten down the road a year or two down the road"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12645520","12647280"," Or do you think it's um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12647280","12650880"," A chance of no, we're gonna stay the chorus right now and protect the banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12653200","12658240"," I mean, they're gonna protect the banks no matter what. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that they're going to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12659200","12663440"," That doesn't mean that they're going to protect them with insurance or interest rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12663920","12667200"," They could just protect the banks with balance sheet. Yeah"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12668080","12674160"," That was what I was saying. That's our no landing is we let interest rates. Fuck everyone. Sorry. I keep saying F bombs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12674320","12676560"," Uh, but we let we let interest rates"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12677200","12682320"," You know mess everyone up and then we save the ones we care about right like that's what"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12683280","12685120"," That's kind of what it looks like they're doing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12685200","12692080"," I mean, this was probably earlier that they hadn't deployed the balance sheet than they thought they would but that's kind of where we are"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12694400","12696400"," That's right. I think we are too"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12696800","12700320"," And reading always like this is gonna be what I think wild to see"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12701600","12703600"," Yeah, like let's let's destroy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12704560","12705920"," Let's destroy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12705920","12709680"," Everything and then save what we loved and that's kind of where we are"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12709680","12716160"," Let's see what let's see what some people are saying in the chat right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12719360","12725760"," Yeah, that's kind of funny too. So lane mire just said i'm just waiting for chat gpt to take over so I can collect my ubi"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12726240","12729280"," It's funny because I see that I see that uh talked about right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12729840","12737200"," Everybody's gonna get a universal basic income and then you've got uh, you've got uh oligarchs out there saying people need a work harder"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12738160","12741200"," Uh, you see the french being told you have to work harder. You see"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12742000","12744640"," US citizens being sold. You have to work more and harder"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12745200","12752240"," For less. I think the french were being told if you if you insist on living if you insist on living a longer life"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12752560","12754560"," We're gonna insist on you working longer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12755120","12759120"," Because that's it's really not a matter of harder. I think they just they're like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12760080","12764080"," You know, you you bastards are living too long and rather than"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12764720","12769440"," You know, we we tried we tried to uh kill you off by making it really cool to smoke"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12769520","12774000"," But that's not working anymore. So in french they just need people to work longer now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12774560","12778480"," Don't get trapped in here if you're a bear just so you know, we've got some collapsing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12778960","12782400"," On the vix in the background at least you've got the hourly. I'm gonna show you guys some real quick"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12782960","12786160"," The uh, I think that's fascinating. We had this whole conversation about"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12787440","12793920"," Uh universal basic income coming coming down the road down the street and that you'll work less the people like warriors will be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12794080","12796080"," Out of work attorneys will be out of work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12796400","12798400"," Scientists will be out of work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12799840","12801840"," Developers we put out of work by all of this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12802720","12805680"," And then you've still have in the background there's still this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12806240","12809760"," Thing where you've got people that want profit so they're like well where we have to find some work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12810400","12812000"," For these people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12812000","12815280"," We're gonna we have to create something where they need to earn money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12817280","12819280"," So that I can stay profitable"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12819600","12821600"," Uh, once your job is taken away from you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12822160","12826560"," Uh, so would you comment on that or do you think that that will actually come true? Do you think that?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12827440","12829440"," Uh life will get better for"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12829760","12831760"," Do you think life will get better for?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12832080","12835840"," Uh, the worker is decades past or do you think we'll just find another way?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12836560","12839040"," Uh to keep people safe. I think the super good"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12840720","12842560"," consumer goods"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12842560","12849200"," You know, eelon musk says, you know that you know, ai and robotics are going to be the largest deflationary force in history"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12850080","12855920"," Even more so than like agriculture and that's possible. I think that's totally possible"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12856560","12857680"," um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12857680","12860160"," That you know that at the point when we have"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12860960","12862960"," useful robotics"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12863200","12865200"," And useful in that, you know, they're not"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12866160","12872720"," Capable of doing one repetitive job again and again, but that requires do you think we'll let regular people off from"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12873920","12877680"," Let's say robotics are making me money, but shouldn't I use the uh the people"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12878480","12879680"," I"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12879680","12886000"," Mean it's just going to depend right like used to be used to be all of your fabrics were handwoven"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12886480","12890160"," But um, they're not anymore now. They're all made by our giant machine"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12890560","12895520"," Did we want to keep those people doing something sure but was the consumer willing to pay?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12896320","12901280"," Uh, you know what the equivalent today would probably be $10,000 for a sweater"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12901680","12906880"," For someone to sit there for weeks and weeks at a time and make a single bolt a cloth"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","12907360","12914080"," No, yeah, so um, I don't think that I don't think it will come down to there being a"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","14260960","14263760"," Start looking at so let's look at this real quick as we get up there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14263760","14266480"," We got 402 right so we said maybe a failure"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14267280","14273040"," So we have a failure to print 403 402 look at 402s 401s on the call side"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14274000","14278960"," And then start looking at like a 395 P on the put side"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","14408560","14410560"," Sometimes it's better to hold on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14411760","14413760"," To at least try to salvage yourself"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14414400","14416720"," Uh be careful be it be careful"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14417280","14420640"," Sometimes it doesn't work. I've had one trade here where it took one time"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","14427120","14430880"," But half more in the toolbox if needed. Let's see. I'm long calls here, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14431920","14436480"," Yeah statistically if if we if we sell off here, we will come back here again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14437760","14441120"," One out of 10 times will we won't bounce back up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14441120","14445360"," We'll actually start blasting through here that you ain't ever making that money back if that happens"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14446160","14450320"," Uh, but but statistically if you if you're upside down your trade"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14450400","14452400"," It's better to manage that trade on these days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14452960","14454720"," Uh for the first"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14454720","14460640"," For the first loss. So if you like goes down comes back up. Unfuck yourself in reposition"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14465360","14467360"," I don't know I don't explain that correctly, but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14468000","14471600"," Uh for those of you that have been here long for a long time you probably understand what i'm saying"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14473920","14479280"," If the trade goes against you in a five minute if you're trading a five minute here and you see us trade underneath"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14480000","14481280"," the white line"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14481280","14483280"," Just right here real quick. I want you to see something"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14484800","14488720"," So in a five minute chart as long as we're above this white line right here, it's bullish"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14489600","14492400"," This white line right here continues higher and price stays above"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14493200","14498320"," Right doesn't rule over you're probably safe if you get underneath this white line though"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14498320","14501840"," Price gets underneath this white line. Let's see you're getting burned in the call side"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14501920","14504720"," You can take that short side right alongside it and make the money back"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14505280","14507920"," Right so you're not completely fucked on the day. Does that make sense?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14508480","14512000"," So that's another idea another way to be looking at this decision today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14513280","14516400"," So if you get tangled up underneath this white line right here in a five minute chart"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14516800","14523680"," Uh, you have to take the short side as fast as you can so that you're able to to pay back that that bad trade that you made"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14527360","14529120"," It's okay. You don't have to always be right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14529120","14535600"," You you the key part about being wrong is that you're able to come back in and recover from any losses that you incur"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14538160","14540160"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","14541680","14543840"," You can see this last line above here"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","17633200","17640800"," Um, and the last thing I'll say is that we've undertaken we're undertaking a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17641520","17642800"," Okay, just a quick follow-up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17642800","17646560"," I mean given all of the stress and the uncertainty that you've also alluded to in the statement"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17646880","17651520"," How seriously was it was a pause considered squeezing higher now trading? So we considered"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17652160","17657360"," 136 we did consider that in the days running up to the meeting and you see the decision that we made which"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17658160","17664720"," Which uh, I'll say a couple things about first. It was supported by a very strong consensus and i'll be happy to explain why"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17665280","17667280"," And really he's done with the speech right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17667280","17672480"," Data on inflation should get some vault cross market came in stronger than expected and really before the recent events"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17673040","17675760"," We were clearly on track to continue with ongoing rate hikes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17676240","17680880"," In fact as of a couple of weeks ago, it it looked like we need to raise rates over the course of the year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17681120","17685120"," More than we'd expect it at the time of the scp in december bull shit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17685360","17686960"," December meeting"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17686960","17690240"," We are committed to restoring price stability and all of the evidence says"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17690720","17694960"," That the public has confidence that we will do so that we'll bring inflation down to two percent"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17695520","17701520"," Over time it is important over time now you edit that in with our actions as well as our words"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17703040","17708240"," So we also assess as I mentioned that the events of the last two weeks are likely to result in some tightening"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17708240","17714160"," Credit conditions for households and businesses and not good on the labor market and on inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17715760","17721200"," Um such a tightening of financial conditions would would work in the same direction as rate tightening in principle as a matter of fact"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17721200","17723600"," You can think of it as being the equivalent of a rate hike"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17724240","17728080"," Or perhaps more than that. Of course, it's not possible to make that assessment"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17728080","17730640"," We're going to talk about this later any precision whatsoever"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17731200","17734800"," So our decision was to move ahead with the 25th credit tight and we're talking about that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17735360","17738640"," And to change our guidance as I mentioned from ongoing hikes to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17740400","17746240"," Some some additional hikes maybe some policy-firming may be appropriate talk about that all morning going forward"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17746400","17747360"," Um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17747360","17754080"," As I mentioned in assessing the need for for further hikes will be focused as always on the incoming data and the evolving outlook"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17754480","17759120"," Squeeze tired now 481 nothing out of the unknown at this point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17764480","17766480"," Mr.. Can you explain?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17767360","17770160"," The difference between ongoing rate increases and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17770800","17774960"," Firming trading 401.9 401 32"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17775120","17777520"," Could policy firm without you increasing rates?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17779600","17784960"," No, I think it's it's it's meant to refer to our policy rate really I would focus on on the words may and some"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17785840","17787840"," As opposed to ongoing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17789040","17793920"," So we clearly were what we were doing there was taking on board the on trying to reflect the uncertainty"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17794400","17799520"," About what will happen. I mean it's possible that this will turn out to have very modest effects"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17799760","17804000"," These events will turn out to be very very modest effects on the economy in which case"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17804480","17806960"," And inflation will continue to be strong in which case"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17807840","17815120"," The you know the path will look might look different. It's also possible that this potential tightening will contribute significant"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17815840","17823280"," Tightening in in credit conditions over time and and in principle if that that that's that means that monetary policy may have less work to do"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17823280","17825280"," We simply don't know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17825440","17830720"," So trading 401 43 right now hike you did today could further exacerbate problem in the banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17831520","17834400"," Watch for that liquidity above with our monetary policy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17834400","17840640"," We're we're really focused on macroeconomic outcomes in particular. We're focused on look above at 4 0 7 5"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17841280","17842320"," and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17842320","17845360"," What can that produce in the way of tighter credit conditions?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17845680","17848560"," I think when we think about in the banks, we're focused on our"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17849040","17855600"," On our financial stability tools in particular is where you create a class of people that can't get credit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17856320","17860000"," Not businesses the new facility is where you become a renter"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17860720","17862720"," You"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","17868640","17874720"," 22 weeks ago you had the terminal rate would be higher obviously that was before the stress in the making sector"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17875280","17879360"," And I realized there's a lot of uncertainty, but can you can you explain it all to what extent?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17880240","17884560"," Your forecasts or those of your colleagues or those of the board staff incorporated"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17885120","17887120"," Today a material tightening of credit availability"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17888080","17895280"," Because of the stress in the banking sector or are you waiting to see it in the data before you incorporate"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17896800","17899200"," That potential tightening into your forecasts"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17899760","17902640"," So, you know, we just come from an FOMC meeting and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17903280","17906480"," You know the the people who write the minutes will be very carefully counting"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17906480","17912400"," But I'll tell you what I'll be so I don't worry about it buddy significant number of people saying that they anticipated they would be some"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17913360","17915520"," Some tightening of credit conditions and that would"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17916320","17922400"," Really have the same effects as as our policies do and that therefore they were including that in their assessment"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17922720","17926400"," And that if that did turned out not to be the case that in principle you'd need more ray hikes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17926640","17928880"," So some people did reflect that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17930560","17932560"," In their in their"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17932800","17937040"," In their scp forecasts. I think there may also just have been remember this is 12 days ago"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17937680","17940720"," You know, we're we're trying to assess something that just is so recent"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17941280","17945200"," And it's people, you know, it's very difficult. There's so much uncertainty"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17945200","17950720"," So December was a good place to start and we wound up with we wound up with very similar outcomes for December"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17951680","17957520"," And it you know in a way the the early the data in the first part the first five weeks of the intermeeting period"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17958000","17963200"," Pointed to stronger inflation and stronger labor markets. So that pointed to higher rates and then"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17963840","17966720"," this this latter part kind of the possibility of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17967680","17971040"," Of credit conditions tightening really really offset that effectively"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17971520","17978800"," To follow up have you considered at all whether your primary tool the funds rate is going to be enough to sustain the kind of tighter financial conditions"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17979360","17984080"," That you believe will be necessary without doing significant damage to the banking sector"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17984080","17989360"," Have you for example considered changing reserve requirements selling assets out of the system open market account"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17989920","17993920"," Is a way to better achieve tighter financial conditions that don't"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17994640","17997520"," Uh, accelerate deposit erosion for example from banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","17998640","18004400"," You know, we know that we have other other tools in effect, but no we think our monetary policy tool works and we think"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18005040","18007040"," You know many many banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18008400","18010240"," Our rate hikes were"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18010240","18014640"," Well telegraphed to the market and many banks have managed to handle them. That's right. I agree with that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18016800","18020080"," They were telegraphed in advance. Absolutely. I agree with politico"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18020080","18025120"," I wanted to ask especially these banks that risk that all the time of the world maybe not prime bank"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18025280","18028720"," All these regional systemic risk exception had space to do this work"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18028800","18031040"," And ensure depositors to be protected at these two banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18031040","18034560"," I was just wondering if you could speak to why that decision was made"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18034560","18040960"," Was it purely a confidence issue or were was there a concern that there would be some 40186 right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18041520","18043360"," Out of the way"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18043360","18044640"," Now squeezing higher"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","18074000","18078560"," I realized you know right away that that there was going to be a need for review"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18079120","18084480"," I mean the question we were all asking ourselves over that first weekend was how did this happen implied move in the high of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18085680","18087120"," 403"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18087120","18089120"," Somewhere in here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18089760","18093360"," We could trade higher but I want you to see this big white line up here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18093520","18098560"," I don't want you to see it on book map as well. There's this big little block of sellers in here and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18099200","18104160"," I get briefed. We'll see if we can trade higher than this zone right now. We'll take a look at book map"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18105680","18109200"," I do want you to be aware if they tag the high sometimes you come back down to grab"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18110480","18115200"," So we'll take a look on book map if there are any more highs above premiere"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18115760","18119920"," Just know you can see this supply and there's one more place above"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18120800","18126800"," 41 100 is disinflation still occurring in the u.s. Today. Yes, I mean that is your"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18127600","18130240"," Right here way to see our three way to see this next"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18131040","18133040"," but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18133040","18135040"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18137600","18142480"," You know that there's another line down in here inflation's been coming down now for six months"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18142480","18148640"," You know, there's one right above air civic and reach up and slam this but it's certainly reach up and slam this right here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18148640","18152080"," Housing services is is really a matter of time passing. We continue to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18152880","18155680"," 2 41 at much lower levels of inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18155680","18161120"," So that's 44 percent of the of the core pce index where you've got a story that's ongoing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18161520","18165360"," Where we didn't have in February and we still come in as a major supply of hair"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18165360","18168800"," No reason not stick some profit up here as you come in here services"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18168800","18171520"," So you want to leave some runners on to get up in here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18171600","18175200"," You know, that's just something that we'll have to come through through softening demand"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18175760","18179360"," And perhaps some softening and labor market conditions. We don't see that yet"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18179440","18181840"," And that's that's of course 56 percent of the index"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18182080","18186640"," So the story is pretty much the same. I will say that the inflation data that we got to your point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18187200","18189200"," Really pointed to stronger inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18189520","18191040"," If I could follow up on that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18191040","18194560"," I was curious why you don't see more coming from the credit crunch because it seems to me"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18194560","18198400"," That's like something that you'd actually welcome to a degree and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18199040","18205040"," Expect and are you not seeing more coming from that because you don't know or because you just don't want to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18205200","18210080"," Have another round of wishful thinking. So it's really just a question of not knowing at this point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18210320","18217840"," There's a great deal of literature on the connection between tighter credit conditions economic activity hiring and inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18218080","18221360"," Remember this right answer is important for you to know the question is how"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18222000","18226240"," Success was our conversation earlier today and how how sustained will it be that's that's the issue"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18226640","18230800"," And we don't really see it yet. It's so so people are making estimates, you know, people are publishing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18230800","18234480"," Creating a class of people that will be employed while they go through recession"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18234960","18236960"," So with that we'll talk about this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18237440","18240960"," It's creating a class of people that will work their asses"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18241840","18248480"," As conditions are tight as we think about although have money to spend we'll be paying attention to the actual unexpected"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18249120","18251120"," effects from that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18255360","18257360"," For a longer period of time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18257440","18259440"," Thank you for taking our questions"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18259840","18261600"," I wonder if you could talk a little bit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18261600","18263600"," I know that you've got your internal review coming"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18263600","18267440"," But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you think happened with oversight"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18267440","18274000"," It's elk on valley bank and whether this suggests that something about regulation and supervision needs to actually change going forward"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18274560","18280080"," And I wonder you know, how can the american people have confidence that there aren't other weaknesses out there in the banking system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18280160","18282560"," Given that this one got missed as you noted"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18283280","18287040"," So let me let me say what what what I think happened and then I'll come to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18287840","18290880"," The questions around supervision. So at a basic level"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18291760","18295120"," Silicon Valley bank management failed badly"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18295840","18301040"," They grew the bank very quickly. They exposed the bank to significant liquidity risk and interest rate risk"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18301520","18303520"," Didn't hedge that risk"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18304000","18306000"," Supervisors"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18306480","18312400"," Saw these risks and and intervened they saw before that the public saw all this they took the money to run"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18313120","18317760"," We know that svp experienced an unprecedentedly rapid and massive bank room"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18317920","18323120"," So this is a this is a very large group of connected depositors concentrated group of connected depositors"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18323680","18328880"," And a very very fast run faster than historical record would suggest so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18331440","18337440"," As for us so for our part we're doing a review of supervision and regulation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18338480","18345280"," My only interest is that we identify what went wrong here. How did this happen? Is the question what went wrong?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18346000","18351840"," Try to find that we will find that and then make an assessment of what are the right policies to put in place so that it doesn't happen again"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18351840","18354240"," So and then implement those one thing I want to make a note here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18354400","18359680"," It would be inappropriate for me at this stage to offer my views on what the answers might be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18359920","18364000"," You know, I simply you know the one thing you don't want to see in these in these vc companies"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18364160","18366160"," You don't want to see them completely get shut out"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18366480","18370400"," But that will be up to him but you want the banks to take on a hedge"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18370960","18373600"," Which isn't required is the point when transparent"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18373680","18379120"," You're not trying to kill vc's or anything or even the banks available these vc's but you are saying hey, man"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18379440","18381440"," Good to the bank you're saying look"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18381680","18387280"," You were telegrap to hedge and you did there will be recommendations coming in and there was no requirement that they did"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18387280","18389280"," What they did was they put the money and ran"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18390640","18395200"," And the final point, you know, now what you don't want to see is the senate say something like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18395760","18401200"," Yeah, you're gonna be uh, you're gonna be financing vc's that you have to put this pre through the banking system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18401200","18404880"," This was a this was a bank that was an outlier in terms of both its percent. No wasn't"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18405840","18407280"," of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18407280","18410640"," Uninsured deposits and in in terms of its, uh, no"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18411760","18417120"," Uninsured deposits and again, there are there are ways for you to ensure it outside of the fdi see that's bullshit too"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18417840","18421840"," Uh, and you could require these people to buy that insurance too, but you can do that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18422480","18427280"," And so that's really the nature of the interview of sorry of the review is to discover that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18427360","18430720"," As a depositor if you're the bank say all right, do you have your paperwork for your"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18431520","18433520"," Outside insurance on your money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18433520","18439280"," You've been very consistent in saying that the fed would be raising interest rates and then holding them there for quite some time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18439680","18447120"," Uh following today's decision the markets have now priced in one more increase in may and then every meeting the rest of this year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18447280","18449280"," They're pricing in rate cuts"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18449600","18450560"," Uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18450560","18455120"," Are they getting this totally wrong from the fed or is there something different about waiting?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18455600","18458320"," Uh, you're looking at it given that you're now thinking that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18459120","18461920"," Moves might be appropriate as opposed to ongoing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18462560","18468160"," So we published an scp today as you will have seen and it shows that uh, basically participants expect"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18468640","18474960"," Relatively slow growth a gradual rebalancing of supply and demand in the labor market with inflation moving down gradually"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18474960","18477760"," This is going to be important for the politics in this country"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18478560","18482000"," Participants don't see rate cuts. Hopefully you took your profit there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18482000","18488160"," I would just say as always the path of the economy is uncertain and policy is going to reflect what actually happens rather than what we write down in the scp"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18488160","18492080"," But that's not our baseline expectation. Well, if I could follow up and ask"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18493200","18497520"," As you look forward, uh into the rest of the year here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18498480","18507360"," Are you saying that um what you see and the 5.1% basically uh consensus is based on being"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18507840","18513680"," It will be sufficiently restrictive or is it leavened by the idea of you don't know what's going to happen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18513680","18519680"," That's where you don't know what should people think about in terms of how the fed thinks about how far it is from the terminal"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18520160","18524880"," It's going to depend remember we were looking for purposes of our monetary policy tool"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18524880","18527680"," We're looking at this is the kick in the can part of banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18528320","18533200"," Uh and asking is there going to be some tightening and credit conditions and then we're thinking about that as"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18533760","18537920"," Effectively doing the same thing that rate hikes do so in a way that substitutes for rate hikes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18538000","18539280"," That's bullshit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18539280","18544080"," The the key is we have to have policies need got to be tight enough to bring inflation down to 2%"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18544080","18547440"," They knew that was coming anyways come from rate hikes. It can come from"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18548080","18550400"," Uh, you know from uh tighter credit conditions"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18550480","18557760"," This is covering ass right now and we're we it's highly uncertain how long the situation will be sustained or how significant any of those effects would be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18557760","18559600"," So we're just going to have to watch"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18559600","18561600"," Uh in the meantime"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18562560","18564080"," You know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18564080","18569360"," Obviously at the end of the day, we will do enough to bring inflation down to 2% no one should doubt that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18569840","18574880"," I am impressed they didn't braise the inflation rate to three or five any kind of new verbiage there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18576720","18580320"," Hi chair paul, Rachel seagull from the washington post. Thank you for taking our questions"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18580880","18585440"," I know we've talked a bit about how silicon valley bank was unique to a certain sector of the economy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18585920","18591280"," But there's also growing concern that there are financial stability risks from the commercial real estate market and loans"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18591280","18597600"," That will begin to roll over later this year and next and that smaller regional banks also disproportionately hold those loans"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18598240","18604480"," Is there a risk that could mimic the kind of what we saw with svb to banks that disproportionately risk comes at like year five"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18604960","18606720"," Another three or four years"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18606720","18609760"," Well aware of the concentrations people have in commercial real estate"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18610000","18615200"," I really don't think it's comparable to this the bank the banking system is is strong. It is sound"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18615200","18620240"," It is is tell about how you can't let the commercial bank fail for commercial mortgage back. It's a period of sale"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18620240","18623840"," Tell them that I really don't see that as at all analogous. Tell them the truth"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18624560","18628480"," The question would you be open to an independent investigation separate from the feds probe?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18629200","18630400"," I welcome"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18630400","18634160"," That it's it's a hundred percent certainty that there will be independent investigations"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18634720","18637680"," And outside investigations and all that so we welcome"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18638480","18642560"," When a bank fails their their investigations and of course we welcome that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18644560","18646960"," Yeah, we just don't want the we just don't want to set it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18647120","18649120"," Edward launch it up box business"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18649280","18655200"," Inflation has been rather sticky. So do you need help from the fiscal side to get inflation down faster?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18656720","18661360"," We don't assume that we don't give advice to the fiscal authorities and we we assume that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18662320","18667360"," We take fiscal policy as dip bots down below front door dip bot down below"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18667440","18670880"," We're looking to see if we get one more dip by here or even down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18670880","18674320"," responsibility for price stability the federal reserve has responsibility for that and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18675200","18680240"," Nothing is going to change that. So we have a lot to talk about as well after this time presser"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18681120","18687040"," Wraps up if I could follow on that, but they're working the the spending that's happened is working against what you are doing, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18687040","18691280"," So it's prolonging. Oh, here we go. There's real questions. You know if you you have to look at"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18692480","18698480"," At the impulse from spending because spending was of course tremendously high during the pandemic and then as the pandemic programs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18699200","18701200"," rolled off spending actually came down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18702160","18704960"," We want to see this conference ends for the ball to roll off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18705040","18707040"," So why don't pay attention right now?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18707040","18709040"," As this conference is going to wrap up shortly"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18709520","18712720"," You should see some of that ball roll off the market here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18716880","18718880"," Hi chair pal and you're one with axios"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18719440","18723360"," Two questions about aspects of the government's response on Silicon Valley bank two weekends ago"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18724080","18729200"," First, why is this new bank funding facility done under emergency 13 3 authority as opposed to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18729680","18733280"," Expansion of the discount window changing the terms the discount window that's been around a long time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18733680","18735680"," and second can you discuss the federal and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18736240","18742240"," In the FDIC guarantee of uninsured depositors and why there's your eyes right down in here on your balance sheets last week"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18742720","18744720"," supporting that positive guarantee"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18744800","18746640"," sure, so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18746640","18748240"," 13 3"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18748240","18750480"," Seemed like the right chase if you're watching right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18750480","18754960"," This is where this is your opportunity down here as we come down here chase discount window"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18754960","18759600"," If you're looking for that opportunity to put some call spreads on a certain way so that we're talking about earlier"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18759600","18761760"," You could be looking down here for that no magic to that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18761760","18766880"," It's only available in on looking at four thousand on es for that trade requirements"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18766880","18774240"," But it seemed to be the right place so somewhere right down in here. We're just we're lending to the in effect. We're we're"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18775120","18777120"," Lending to the bridge bank"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18777680","18783440"," So that's where the funds came from and it's it's a loan that's 100 guaranteed by the FDIC so there's no risk in it for us"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18785920","18794880"," Thank you, Chris Reugeber and associated press the scb scp suggests one more rate hike as does the"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18795360","18797360"," Change in the language in the statement"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18798640","18802320"," And which suggests that you're perhaps nearing the end of a cycle of rate hikes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18803040","18808880"," Do you feel though that if inflation remains high you'll be able to resume additional hikes as needed or have you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18809360","18814400"," Somewhat tied your hands here with these signals about rate hikes coming to an end. Thank you. Absolutely not"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18814560","18821920"," No, we we we if we need to raise height raise rates higher. We will I think for now though we"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18823280","18826320"," As I've mentioned we see the likelihood of"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18826960","18834400"," Credit tightening we know that that can have a you know an effect on the macro economy on demand on labor market on inflation"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18834960","18837200"," And we're going to be watching to see what that is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18837360","18840240"," Vic's trading up into resistance at 20"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18840240","18845920"," Labor market, so 2081 you'd really like to see vix get up to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18846960","18853840"," 2190 if possible enough policy to bring inflation down if possibly you can get 2190 and the vix then try to get the sellback down and off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18854080","18860080"," Hopefully we can get one more move lower here. Hi chair. Paul. Thanks for taking the question Kyle Campbell with american banker"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18860640","18862640"," I have a couple questions about the balance sheet"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18863280","18865280"," Uh first of all i'm curious"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18865840","18868640"," At what point the financial supports that the that is extending"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18869440","18872560"," Through the discount window and through its enhanced lending facility"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18873440","18879520"," Might be at odds with the objective of reducing the balance sheet and i'm also curious what your thoughts are on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18880080","18883280"," The not just the availability of reserves, but the distribution of them"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18883840","18889200"," There's going to get this crossed right here if they can you might be concerned about it being scarce for certain banks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18890320","18891840"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18891840","18895760"," I want to buy this down here because it looks like it looks like demand coming up right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18896240","18900800"," Clear by see the demand leave 4,000 and come higher right here. So he might get a bit the market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18901200","18905520"," Right here, but increase the size of our balance soon that the intent and the effects of it are very different"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18906080","18910960"," From what we from when we expand our balance sheet through purchases of longer term securities"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18911520","18916800"," Large scale purchases of long term securities are are really meant to alter the stance of policy by pushing down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18917680","18923200"," Pushing up the price and down the rates longer term rates, which supports demand through channels. We understand fairly well"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18924000","18926000"," The balance sheet expansion is really"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18926400","18931360"," Temporary lending to banks to to meet those special liquidity demands created by the recent tensions"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18931760","18935040"," It's not intended to directly alter the stance of monetary policy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18936080","18939600"," Um, we do believe that it's working. It's having its intended effective bolstering"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18939600","18942080"," I want you to look at one other thing is this takes place"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18942080","18948480"," I want you to look down below here at this implied move in the market then we get range expansion in the market after today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18949040","18950560"," To the up and downside"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18950560","18954480"," I want you to see that we're going to get some range expansion here into the up and down side"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18954880","18959360"," You're looking for a dip me buying in this market if you want to put some risk on in this market at the end of the week"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18959440","18964480"," It's down below here 394 396 397 somewhere down in here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18965280","18966800"," Is working"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18966800","18973120"," And um, of course, we're we're always prepared to to change that if that changes, but we don't see any evidence that that's changed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18973120","18975120"," I"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18978240","18980560"," Chair catteriness arrival with Bloomberg news"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","18982400","18985840"," The minutes of the january federal meeting a last meeting um indicate that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18987600","18992240"," You discussed the possibility of runs on non-bank financial institutions"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18992800","18996560"," And the impact of large unrealized losses on bank portfolios"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18997120","18999520"," Can you talk a little bit more about that discussion?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","18999760","19003200"," Um kind of what was coming in right now in light of that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19003840","19011120"," And then why didn't the fed, you know, do anything about that at that point to ultimately prevent, you know, what happened this month"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19011680","19017280"," I mean to be honest. I don't live in a volume selling coming into the spy right now quite an interesting seven weeks"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","19554240","19557760"," It's expensive enough choking off growth as you said you're watching before"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19558240","19566480"," Would that situation warrant a rate cut what situation would warrant a rate cut and have the bank failures prompted any discussion around"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","19588080","19594240"," Curious how you view financial conditions now and if credit were to tighten enough if that would prompt a rate cut so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19598160","19601840"," Financial conditions seem to have tightened and probably by more than"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19602400","19604400"," the traditional indexes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19604720","19612000"," Say because the traditional indexes are are focused a lot on rates and equities and they don't necessarily capture"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19613520","19619680"," Lending conditions. So we think that though. So there are other measures which which if they're there you go"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19619680","19623120"," You know bank lending conditions and things like that they show some more tightening"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19623280","19630560"," The question for us though is how significant will that be and how you know, what would be the extent of it and what would be the duration of it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19631200","19633840"," And and then you know, once you have once you know that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19634560","19638960"," There's a fair amount of research about how that how that with broad uncertainty bands"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19639680","19641680"," How that works its way into the economy?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19641680","19647520"," We'll talk about that too. What he's saying here about tightening financial conditions are not reflected in the indexes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19647520","19651840"," And there's a reason for that it's going to be sustained joe donut and I talked earlier about"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19652560","19656720"," Creating a class of people that have no credit extended to them"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19657200","19664000"," But yet they have money to spend on goods and services. I mentioned with rate cuts. It's rate cuts are not in our base case"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19664640","19665520"," and"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19665520","19669040"," You know, so not as hawkish embarrasses you think I promise you"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","19699520","19701760"," This is what called what's called kicking the can down the road"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19703440","19706720"," There's some other scare some scariness here, but not the way that you think"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19707920","19709920"," so"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19711280","19715600"," The first one here is gdp we're gonna talk about gdp is looking bad, right"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","19727120","19731120"," The gdp projections are kind of bad down the road, right? We already know that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19734240","19736240"," Now trade a dollar 40 and 397 sees"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19738000","19742240"," Gdp protection projections are bad down the road. Okay, that that's not good"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19743200","19749200"," Now with that being said that's going to come into some politics. You're going to see that impact our political system"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19749760","19752880"," Uh, you're going to see people out there saying well, we don't want gdp being low"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19753680","19757600"," Uh, we don't and that they're going to fight for this, right? They want companies to be able to produce goods"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19758080","19761920"," In services for you to buy now unemployment is going to be another key part of this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19762240","19766080"," As long as they keep people employed, they don't care if you have good credit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","19766480","19770720"," Now if you're a business, I want you to realize you can go bet you can go right to the fed and look at this"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","20068400","20070400"," Is unreal"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20071040","20077200"," And now that what does this lead to it leads to senate hearings, hopefully these senate hearings"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20077920","20080160"," Continue to support vcs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20080720","20085600"," Uh, but with some requirements on these banks and vcs that you don't want to see a hammer come down"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","20095120","20098080"," But you do want to say to like these banks that take on this risk"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20098320","20102480"," Yeah, you could have hedged this we require you now to hedge just when these things are in place"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20102960","20104960"," Well, look at that squeeze and hire right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20105360","20107440"," Just blast and hire they don't even care"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","20122560","20124400"," Should I have stayed long here?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20124400","20127760"," I'll be pissed off if I'd pissed off. That was the case"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20128480","20130480"," now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20131040","20132640"," now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20132720","20135280"," I want you to I want you to realize though. I want you to realize though"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20135280","20140400"," They're pushing this off and this is going to come into politics and the vc thing right the senate hearings"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20140400","20141920"," You can let them say that shit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20141920","20145920"," But you just want you just want protections put in place that trigger like if i'm a vc"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20145920","20148800"," I go to a shitty bank like like s sbb or whatever"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20151680","20156240"," One of these shitty regional banks that they're going to say to me. Hey, look we we only protect uh, you know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20156880","20158880"," We protect nothing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20158880","20162000"," We're fdic insured at $250 000 and you get 50 million"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20162320","20165760"," We require you to have your own insurance against losses"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20165760","20170720"," We require and then then then you want the senate to tell these banks to do the same thing for themselves"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20172240","20174240"," So that they have to assume more hedging"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20175120","20177120"," As rates go higher"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20177120","20180480"," So that that's all that stuff on the side there. That's that's the other side of this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20181040","20187920"," Uh, but for as far as we're concerned here the bet is willing to to support rich people from this point forward"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20188320","20193280"," And that means that your inflation is not coming down. I apologize to you as time passes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20193680","20197360"," You are going to see this is going to take some time man. You are not going to get ahead"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20198080","20202880"," Of, uh, the rate of inflation. I'm sure you have it at this point. You're not getting ahead of it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20202880","20204640"," You're not getting ahead of it this year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20204640","20206640"," You're not getting ahead of it next year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20207200","20212640"," And they said they're going to they they say they're only tight tight in two more cycles and that the credit crunch is going to do that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20212640","20217680"," That's bullshit. We saw that no 708 910. No, no to four years right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20218880","20225680"," Right, so you're not going to see that you're going to probably see a forced voker second moment in five years"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20226960","20228960"," Which is horrific"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20232640","20234640"," It's unreal"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20237520","20240720"," Unreal dude i'm telling you this is not the moment a bear is looking for"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20241200","20242560"," Promise you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20242560","20247120"," This is not the moment you were looking for. This is the traded sideways about moment. I guarantee you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20247440","20250400"," You're not seeing a market crash from that. What was just said today guaranteed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20251840","20258000"," Yeah, I mean, I'm not guaranteed. I can't guarantee it, but that presser there no matter what you're consuming out there in social media"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20258640","20260800"," It was not that was not the presser you wanted"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20264640","20267840"," That was let's create a class of let's create a class of serfs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20268880","20270880"," In my in my opinion"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20271920","20274080"," This is the same thing it gets gross"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20277120","20286240"," It's it's gross. It's the sideways market is what it is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20287280","20289280"," That's what it looks like to me"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20289600","20293600"," And he said it right he he said it about the indexes he said it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20295040","20300560"," Now there is some problems down the road if we go look down the road right when they're talking about GDP going down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20300560","20304160"," That kind of stuff, but you're going to see politics play into that as my point"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20304240","20309680"," Do I keep bringing this is politics back up when we have to deal with that down the road, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20310400","20313920"," So when we're going down that road, you're like, yeah, but GDP is going to be horrible in two years"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20314400","20320320"," There's also an election in two years and in that election I guarantee you people are going to promise"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20320880","20322240"," Higher wages"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20322240","20326320"," They're going to promise that we we we start to bring the GDP back"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20326720","20329840"," And you're going to see as we start heading lower over there that they're going to rip"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20329920","20332800"," They're going to they're going to trade this up on that on those hopes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20333600","20334640"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20334640","20336800"," Numbed I apologize. Not what you wanted it to be"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20337440","20342320"," Uh, it's not what a bear wanted it to be it's not what a bull wanted it to be either to be quite frank with you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20342800","20347120"," Uh, bulls don't want to buy tesla 185 they want to buy tesla at 65 bucks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20348720","20351040"," Seems to be this like bull bear thing out there where"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20351920","20354240"," Uh bears seem to think that bulls want to buy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20354640","20356640"," hold on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20356640","20358640"," I"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20362000","20366080"," Seems to be there's this thing out there where where bears seem to think that bulls want"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20367200","20373280"," I don't know like this is the tesla bottom. I don't think that bulls think it is a tesla bottom, but this is pushing off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20374800","20376800"," That's what this is pushing off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20377760","20379920"," Uh, and you have to see it for what it is"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20380720","20382720"," You really do you have to look at it clear as day"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20383520","20388880"," Uh, this is not the uh bloodbath the depths of hell. This is not the all-time highs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20389600","20391760"," Uh, this is trade this market sideways"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20392880","20395120"," Socks man. This is going to be a shitty market to trade"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20396080","20399280"," It's not going to be the fun market. It's not going to be the fun market trade in my view"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20403200","20405200"," Yeah, it's it's gross"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20405440","20407440"," It is absolutely gross"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","20410400","20416160"," Absolutely gross your next bet or your next uh big thing you're looking for is the election cycle in my view"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20417200","20420240"," Uh, the next thing you're looking for is politics to change"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20420960","20424240"," I'm not on either side on that. I just I'm just saying if you want a major shift"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20424880","20426880"," It's more than likely going to be politically driven"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20427360","20430560"," More than likely going to hinge on a presidential senate election that kind of stuff"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20438000","20443200"," Yeah, I think that's your next major. I don't know that there's anything else major like major policy shift"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20443840","20450480"," Outside of uh, this kind of bullshit that we're seeing right now. It's probably a political uh going to be going to be pushed off to paul politicians"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20451920","20454560"," And i'm fascinated by that i'm fascinated by that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20456080","20461760"," I'm fascinated of another two years of this how people are going to feel when they actually hit the voting booth"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20462640","20464640"," Well, we've seen how that goes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20465200","20467760"," People live under these conditions for another two years"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20468640","20472640"," Uh, it's going to get tiring for people it really it really will get tiring for people"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","20550160","20552160"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20552160","20557520"," See what you're saying here someone's saying i've been thinking more and more that that's the right strategy to all this is opposed"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20557600","20562800"," Trying to time things. Yeah, timing is not right. Is it we talk about that in the in the program oftentimes"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20563440","20568880"," Sideways and up big nothing burger king of america saying my take is the fed uh solidest saying my take is the fed doesn't know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20569280","20574160"," But they were doing and admitted it. Yeah, he did admit it earlier didn't he he had some real key"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20574960","20576960"," uh, changes in his"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20578400","20585200"," Words today too, didn't he he did he had some he added some things either there's a lot of that lots of dissect in his verbiage today"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20588800","20592240"," Yeah, so nordic trade is saying you don't expect a recession that will kill"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20592480","20596560"," Uh, we'll kill both the s&p and inflation. I do want you to understand here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20597040","20602080"," Very clear. It's a great question is that they're telling you that they're going to force you to work through it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20602720","20606560"," The trying to tell you they're going to keep you employed they're going to enslave you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20607360","20610400"," While we go through it in a recession is the key here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20611840","20616080"," It's not like it's not like you're going through something where you're not employed. They're going to say yeah"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20616080","20618080"," You're going to work your asses off through this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20619920","20623760"," Uh, this is this is a huge thing right now. These are the vocal ears"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20625280","20627280"," Not that there's no jobs. You're going to have a job"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20628000","20632000"," You're going to have a job. You're going to you're going to break your balls. I assure you that's what he's telling you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20632960","20634960"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20638400","20643680"," Yeah, that's right. That's right. He wants to keep upper levels of the financial industry intact money flowing to create industry"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20644800","20650720"," I heard status quo. Nothing worthwhile has broken yet. Keep hiking until that happens. I skilled back in market already priced"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20651440","20657840"," In a point zero to point two five agree and then pause looks like we were getting point two five and point two five again down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20658560","20661680"," Now as usual, the last thing the fed wants to do is surprise markets"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20662320","20666320"," Uh, blah, blah, blah. I think it's I think it's a longer tightening longer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20666560","20671600"," Now mike could slow into the right past 430 crash looks like it will happen by a war or some other BS"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20672000","20673680"," Summary of press was bank. This is fine"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20673680","20676880"," But it leads to credit tightening and gdp not expect to be robust"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20677360","20682640"," And rates will remain high until next year overall not bullish at all quite bearish economy and for equities"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20683280","20688880"," Even remorseful at one point. Uh, I think the fed kind of saying we don't know what we broke and we were easing off"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20689280","20694160"," Micros haven't changed earnings week. We see sub 380 before 420 in the spy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20694960","20698320"," Now, yeah, I don't mind seeing 380. I think 380 side. I think three days natural"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20699120","20704640"," Uh, so came back 209 saying that I want to talk about that too. Uh, let's look at spy real quick"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20704960","20706960"," We could use spx. I guess"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20707520","20710080"," Uh, so I don't I don't disagree with that statement"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20710480","20715520"," Uh, but that I think is more natural trading than anything. So that's a good one. I just read right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20715760","20717840"," Let's talk about spx real quick"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20717840","20722080"," And we're gonna look at xpx in a higher time frame. I'm gonna look right at just on a daily chart here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20723120","20725920"," And I think what he's saying look let me know if i'm wrong here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20726480","20730640"," Uh, came back 209 is making a point here and I I don't disagree with came back here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20732000","20734240"," Kind of I don't know if it's I don't know it's 380"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20735120","20737280"," I'm gonna go with no on the 380 down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20738240","20742800"," Uh, but what I am going to go with here is I wouldn't see this top up here at 409"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20742960","20747760"," This is spx right now. I wouldn't be surprised to see you know spx be above here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20748880","20752240"," Trade back down and catch that dip in that in in that uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20755040","20759360"," And that that close this gap down below and then trade higher. I don't know that we get down here came back"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20759360","20764720"," I'm not going to go as as bearish as you are down a 380. Just this full roll. You might get it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20765200","20769520"," Uh, I think they're gonna at least I think bears or bulls are at least gonna try to buy that dip in there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20769520","20771520"," So that's the daily"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20772000","20776000"," Here it is right here. You know bull if you know bears want to sell this right down right like yeah"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20776000","20778160"," You got up there now. We're gonna sell it back down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20778560","20783120"," There's that 380 that came back as saying down below. I think the bulls do try to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20783760","20789840"," Buy this up here now on a bet on another time for time frame here. Let's look at something else here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20790960","20792960"," Look at the uh daily here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20793600","20795600"," And I do want to warn you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20796160","20798960"," Uh, not warn you, but I want to tell you this here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20801040","20803040"," I'm on the boat"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20803040","20805040"," Right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20805280","20808640"," We're in springtime. We've got march in april. So you got this trade up higher"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20809120","20813760"," Trade down lower trade up higher trade down lower and I would like to see that complete up here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20814160","20817520"," And then we come in the summer months and we trade down here in the early summer months over here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20817680","20822400"," That's what I think is gonna happen. So i'm looking for that dip buy down there for that continuation trade higher"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20823040","20826480"," I'm looking for a low of our dip buy at least that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20827120","20829440"," Uh, let's take a look closer at it on spx"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20830640","20834880"," Some kind of a dip buy down in here. Maybe close the gap down here at 395"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20834880","20837920"," Three 395 six for continuation for the bulls"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20838160","20842160"," If that if that gap gets close and we start to reject off the daily"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20842560","20845680"," If we get the rejection off this daily here you start trading price below"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20846000","20849680"," We blast down and then we get the confirmation that we're going lower"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20850000","20852800"," Yeah, I'll entertain that 380 down below there. No problem"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20853360","20856800"," Uh, but as for as for right now being springtime march heading into april"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20857200","20858160"," uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20858160","20860400"," I'm going to look for weakness down to"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20862000","20868400"," 395 ish and then some continuation to close some gaps above here at 420 possibly even uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20869440","20870720"," 430"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20870720","20874400"," Into into april and then we'll get that slow summer, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20876000","20878320"," Of the slow early summer and then the late push up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20879280","20881280"," in summer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20881760","20883760"," So i'm down with you for some weakness"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20884400","20887600"," Uh, just not as weak as you think I don't I don't think that's going to happen"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20889280","20891920"," That's a great point came back 209 I love it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20892720","20894720"," Uh, what else we got here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20898400","20900400"," Go back to uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20900640","20902640"," Right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20903520","20908720"," And that's where we are right now right 395 right down in here some of that weakness right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20913760","20918480"," What about the next wave of earnings do companies readjust lower to hit then market keeps going up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20918480","20920240"," That's a very good question as well"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20920240","20923680"," My fear here is that they run into earnings trading up into it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20924080","20928240"," And then we sell the news as we get into earnings generally speaking. That's what I think is happening"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20928960","20930960"," So"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20932480","20937120"," Yeah, I agree with you too came back if we break so one thing came back is making a very good point here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20937600","20941680"," Uh still very good point. So let's look at uh, let's look at the five day here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20943040","20948720"," Let's just look at this five day right here. So came back's basically saying that the bears need to get underneath"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20949600","20951840"," Not just get underneath, but they have to like sell down"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20952560","20957680"," Get the confirmation and then you get that 380 that you're looking for down here with some conviction"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20957680","20959520"," This can happen in the overnight hours"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20960080","20964800"," You can get this like a you can get this if hedge funds can come in in a little liquidity environment"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20965040","20968240"," They can get this and trade this to three. It's not against that trade at all"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20968720","20973120"," Uh, but if you see the buyers just stepping in relentlessly in here at like 395"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20973520","20976080"," They're gonna try to fucking get that move up into 430"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20976640","20978640"," For eight because you know it went"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20979040","20981920"," March and april like the strong months for the stock market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20982560","20986960"," Uh, and then we get that lull in early summer everybody starts taking vacations and shit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20987440","20990480"," We're all fucking around day trading like, uh, 15 points"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20991120","20995440"," Up and down 30 points up and down every day. Meanwhile everybody's partying hanging out in the hamptons"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","20995840","21000240"," And then we get that final like sell down and then we got a rip higher later in summer normally"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21000640","21003440"," So just look at the look at look into spring and summer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21004000","21006000"," And that kind of shit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21006000","21012480"," Going on here in the markets. I saw a bull monitor this as of right now for me. This is a dip buy down below"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21013440","21020320"," Now this 395 392 you can cut your losses down here too. So the next few days. Here's the deal next few days"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21020320","21023360"," We got until monday here and we got some volatility also"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21023920","21027760"," Uh next week on thursday, but blue somewhere on wednesday thursday friday, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21028800","21031040"," When we get some vol i believe it's next thursday"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21034800","21037680"," Because i think the senate hearings where that real vol is down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21038080","21042000"," So if you're looking for a dip to buy, it's probably down here, right? You get your dip buy"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21042160","21045040"," I don't know if it's today tomorrow or friday or even monday"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21045120","21048240"," This is your dip buy down here and your stops are below it, right?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21048400","21049840"," This is where you take"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21049840","21053920"," Put you put your dip buy on right if we start to blast down you trigger your stops"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21054400","21059680"," And you wait to see if we're gonna take this long down to 380. I like the 380 trade"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21060160","21062160"," I just don't see it happening"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21062480","21068720"," Time of year. I don't see it happening. I think this is an opportunity for bulls. Just buy back in trade this up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21069120","21073840"," Now if we trade 380 any point we start blasting down here bull blast down 100 points something like that"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21073840","21075840"," I'm down to buy that dip too"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21080000","21085440"," Yeah, I think it's the sideways I think it's this weird sideways and up trade so let's look back at spx"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21086080","21090160"," So this doesn't mean you don't get blood baths in here. We know that we get blood baths"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21090560","21095200"," We know that every year even with saying even if i'm saying to you like look at this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21095920","21102640"," Even though i'm saying to you we're going sideways enough that doesn't mean watch the please two lines right here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21103120","21109600"," That doesn't mean that we don't trade out of range one time that doesn't mean we don't trade down from range one time"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21109920","21115040"," We can trade all this shit down here. We can trade all this stuff in here, but still trade this bullshit sideways"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21115920","21117200"," it's"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21117200","21118560"," It's"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21118560","21123520"," It's really bad. This is not what bulls want. This is not what bears want in my viewpoint"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21126000","21131920"," Well, this is this is not what either side is looking for and this is what i'm seeing is continuation of this nonsense in here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21132240","21138080"," And this shit's been going on since uh, uh, may set may 18th of last year"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21139600","21141600"," uh may 18th"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21144160","21148320"," I mean bears are looking for like they're not looking for 32 man. They're looking for like, you know"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21148960","21151680"," 2800 and lower. I don't think that happens here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21151680","21153680"," Uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21153680","21160080"," Bulls are looking for this to believe it or not. Uh, what the feds telling you is longer. It's going to take longer"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21160960","21164160"," So I think you're going to see moments of capitulation and moments of highs"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21164880","21166880"," Uh, and that kind of shit"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21167200","21169360"," Uh, this is a brutal market that they're setting up for us"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21170240","21172080"," Not going to lie man"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21172080","21174080"," brutal fucking market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21177680","21181280"," Extension of a brutal market already get ready for it in my view"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21182640","21187280"," Seriously get ready for it. It's going to suck not making me happy here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21197200","21200880"," And I wouldn't be do I've got crash puts on the market"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21201440","21205360"," I've got them for today. They expire today. Do I think we got them into this close?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21205440","21208240"," Probably not probably gonna get torched on this whole trade here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21212480","21217760"," Yeah, my my puts are at my so we're down here right now and my 392s are at three cents i'm getting smoked"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21218480","21221040"," Uh, well not smoked i'm made of money on selling puts"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21221680","21224080"," But on the other side of this trade i'm getting burned right now"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21224080","21226080"," You"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","21251360","21253360"," Zero change in tone"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21254960","21260480"," Yeah, I don't know if we get a crash in september daktobra i was thinking on the back end of a crash"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","21270160","21272560"," I think this is all a scam maybe even maybe even longer"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","21645600","21648240"," You might get that one last blast down. I'm not anti this"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21648880","21650880"," But i'm anti is this right here"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","21674320","21676320"," It's like you're trying to tee off here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21676720","21678720"," Not so much the ass end down here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21679200","21681840"," You can get a little bit more in the downside here in kRE, but"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21682480","21684080"," uh, you want to like"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21684080","21688640"," When we're really bullish on kRE you should be coming to me and say hey cap"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21690160","21694960"," I want a short kRE so do you understand i'm saying so you can like better positioning"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21695200","21697360"," So just just look at kRE in a daily here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21698640","21702720"," And let's say we're trading up here again in kRE you'd be like hey cap i want to take that short"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21702800","21706000"," I'm like yeah, there you go. It's right there. You see it and there it is right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21706560","21709920"," Hey cap i want to take that kRE short and there it is right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21710480","21714160"," And so you want to see kRE like uh squeeze higher maybe"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21714880","21719040"," Right get up here and then be like hey cap i want to take that kRE short again and i'm like fuck"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21719040","21721200"," Yeah, man. It's right there bro. You get what i'm saying"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21722000","21724000"," See it right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21725760","21730240"," Uh is there more downside risk on kRE sure is it is it uh worth the risk probably not"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21731200","21736560"," Uh, I don't know what that you know, I don't know. I don't see it. I see it better here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21736640","21739520"," This is where you get like better juice where you like more confidence"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21740400","21742960"," More blasting down and so you're looking for that right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21744320","21746320"," Not truthfully"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21746320","21747760"," um"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21747760","21750320"," And that this part of the cycle you see what i'm talking about here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21750400","21755680"," So say it blasts down but then it rips higher up here. You want a short to fuck out of that right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21756480","21758880"," See what i'm saying? That's where the real short is on kRE"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21759360","21761520"," So if you can get kRE back up to like a failure"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21762320","21768160"," A failure above it like 50 bucks even if it comes up and tries to do this bullshit up here 58 bucks"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21768880","21770880"," That's a kick-ass short right there"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21772320","21774320"," Makes sense"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21774640","21776640"," All right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21779120","21781120"," Next one what's the next question?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21782720","21784720"," Uh"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21785120","21787120"," Okay"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21788640","21793600"," Yeah, you guys see what i'm saying? I mean it might be like you might have weakness into the bell or something or in a one-minute chart"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21793680","21795680"," Maybe like yeah, i'm making money"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21795840","21797920"," Uh, but the big money is probably on a rip higher"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21801280","21804480"," Now you can wait, uh, so i'll show you something else on kRE"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21805600","21809760"," Uh, you don't don't buy a spread yet. I'm gonna straight. This is the other side of this trade. So kRE"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21810960","21813680"," Uh, you still can't take a trade here as a bull"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21813680","21817600"," You can't you can't take it right here because it could be a capitulation moment here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21817760","21819760"," So let's just look at a kRE"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21820160","21822160"," and a better time frame"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21822400","21824400"," Uh, you don't even want to enter this trade"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21826080","21828240"," Uh until it stops doing its thing"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21828880","21831280"," You want it to you want it to come back up here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21832560","21834560"," And you put like a spread on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21835360","21840400"," Even though this failed here. This is a good example right here exactly. So let's say you let's say you trade above right"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21841360","21845920"," You get your confirmation trade you didn't get it did you so you wouldn't put this trade on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21846400","21849440"," Unless you were there would you you actually execute the long trade"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21849920","21853680"," Uh on a confirmation. Let's say you still did. Let's say you put the trade on right here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21854240","21856240"," Uh, you would actually put your stops right below it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21856640","21858640"," You get stopped out of your trade"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21859840","21864720"," Uh, another thing too here is if you're a if you're a capitulation bear if you're like a crash bear here"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21865680","21867680"," Just put on a ratio spread man"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21868160","21872480"," Uh if you're like we're going to crash the market here. I don't know put a fucking ratio spread on"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21873120","21874640"," Because it'll pay you"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21874640","21876640"," Uh for for being wrong"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21876880","21882320"," But on a look up a putback spread on youtube the options industry council has a great video on it"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21882800","21886240"," It pays you for for being wrong. So if you're wrong, what do you care?"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21886960","21892160"," Um, I don't understand why people don't use them more frequently, especially in these situations that we're in"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21897680","21899680"," You"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21903360","21905360"," What else you got there"

"_QG_v7EaydQ","21994400","21998640"," It would give you the time for the hourly to come back down and swoop up the one minute to come down and swoop up"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","21998960","22002080"," And the five minutes come down and swoop up for a trade higher into next week"
"_QG_v7EaydQ","22002720","22005520"," And then you can see a play out right there. So 186"
