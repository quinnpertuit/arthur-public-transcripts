"qMKyCtrkYJc","917840","921840"," Dealers are pricing all the puts up."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","939840","948840"," I'm looking at June 16 puts."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","948840","955840"," 4.20 P's for the 16th or 51 cents."

"qMKyCtrkYJc","959840","965840"," As a matter of fact, I was on the phone last night with Vol."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","965840","973840"," I gave two strikes on futures for a bear put back spread."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","973840","984840"," 4.250 and 4200."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","984840","987840"," They're expensive."

"qMKyCtrkYJc","1031840","1034840"," Everyone is going to pile inputs."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","1034840","1038840"," I think that the put back spread, though, is probably the best trade."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","1038840","1041840"," If we go higher, you get paid."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","1041840","1046840"," If we go down, you're going to get paid."

"qMKyCtrkYJc","1065840","1069840"," I think we're going to R3 up here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","1099840","1106840"," We're going to get out there."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","1106840","1109840"," OK."

"qMKyCtrkYJc","4708460","4712820"," So like looking at this right here and IWM probably looks bearish to you"

"qMKyCtrkYJc","4844220","4850420"," And you can also re-enter again down here, so I know it's pretty close or in my view. It's pretty close"

"qMKyCtrkYJc","16360300","16370300"," Let's look at the 12th."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16370300","16374300"," Oh, do we got so many calls for Monday?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16374300","16379300"," So many calls for Monday, dude, 436."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16379300","16388300"," Monday's pin is at 427."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16389300","16393300"," Oh, man, dude, there are no way they're paying those calls."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16393300","16397300"," There are no fucking way they're paying those calls."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16397300","16402300"," Oh, dude, there's a ton of calls on fucking two on Tuesday too."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16402300","16403300"," Savages."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16403300","16407300"," Get a pin at 427 on Tuesday."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16407300","16409300"," A dollar to a session load."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16409300","16412300"," Dude, what's up with these bulls, man?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16412300","16417300"," We got a pin on Wednesday for like 428, Max Payne."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16417300","16424300"," We got 426 to 427 right here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16424300","16427300"," You guys think we trade this sideways again?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16427300","16431300"," Maybe, huh?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16431300","16434300"," You guys thinking that we ping pong this bad boy?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16434300","16442300"," Ping pong the entire way in the next week?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16442300","16445300"," It's actually lower, isn't it?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16445300","16446300"," 420."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16446300","16449300"," We have big pins down below."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16449300","16454300"," Big pins to the downside in the market."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16454300","16457300"," We've got some calls above at 435."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16457300","16460300"," There's a magnet too."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16460300","16466300"," I just don't know that they print those right now for next week, dude."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16466300","16468300"," I'm close enough in hand grenades and horseshoes."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16468300","16471300"," Maybe you already hit it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16476300","16478300"," Another good question."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16478300","16486300"," Why do I look at futures versus spy on BookMap?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16486300","16494300"," BookMap tends to have better levels for ES than a cash market."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16494300","16497300"," Cash market, BookMap."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16497300","16499300"," It's like every five and ten."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16499300","16500300"," There's a bar there."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16500300","16504300"," There are algorithms that are set to buy and sell."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16505300","16511300"," It's hard to find out where the rail support and resistance is in my experience."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16511300","16512300"," I used to do spy."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16512300","16515300"," I used to do all the tickers on stream."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16515300","16517300"," They weren't clear enough."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16517300","16522300"," They weren't clear in what's real support and what's real resistance."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16522300","16527300"," ES tends to have a cleaner order book in my view."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16527300","16529300"," Good question."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16535300","16543300"," Another good question."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16543300","16545300"," 2.31 on a Friday."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16545300","16547300"," Almost here for the weekend."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16547300","16549300"," I think I gave you my synopsis for..."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16549300","16551300"," I think I already gave you what I think's going to happen."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16551300","16552300"," Go ahead into the weekend."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16552300","16554300"," We'll review one more time quickly."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16554300","16559300"," 5 minute chart here, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16559300","16564300"," What do we know about this chart?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16564300","16573300"," This stream is sponsored by Tixricke."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16573300","16574300"," We know..."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16574300","16578300"," It allows you to actually hear water flame features, forex and stock instruments."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16578300","16580300"," We know demand is right there, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16580300","16581300"," So far, that's what we know."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16581300","16582300"," Demand is right here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16582300","16583300"," Do I think we get a rug pull on this?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16583300","16584300"," I do."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16584300","16585300"," I do."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16585300","16601300"," But even saying that..."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16601300","16603300"," I'm interested in this trend, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16603300","16605300"," Every time I come down here, I'm going to buy that dip, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16605300","16612300"," I'm going to buy that dip until it fails."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16612300","16618300"," If this begins to fail right here, I'm going to start getting bearish to the downside."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16618300","16621300"," And I really don't trust this at all."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16621300","16623300"," I don't trust this."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16623300","16625300"," I don't trust this."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16625300","16627300"," I just don't trust it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16627300","16628300"," It's not on your side."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16628300","16633300"," This whole move right here is not on your side."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16633300","16634300"," I want you to know that."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16634300","16641300"," This whole move here was made with little velocity to the upside."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16642300","16644300"," So I would not..."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16644300","16650300"," I'd have more faith in this than I do in this."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16650300","16652300"," And I don't trust this support at all."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16652300","16653300"," I don't trust this support."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16653300","16655300"," I don't trust this support."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16655300","16657300"," I kind of trust this one down here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16657300","16659300"," I'd really like..."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16659300","16661300"," What I really truly trust is 420."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16661300","16666300"," I trust 420 and I trust 410."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16666300","16668300"," So how's it coming to next week?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16668300","16673300"," If they rug pull you, you wake up one day and we're trading 420 or 410."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16673300","16676300"," Don't say I didn't tell you."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16676300","16679300"," And now with all that said, I'll still buy all this stuff, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16679300","16680300"," We'd be trade up here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16680300","16681300"," I'll buy that."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16681300","16682300"," I'll buy that."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16682300","16683300"," I'll buy that."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16683300","16684300"," I'll buy that."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16684300","16691300"," If they pull the rug, I'll switch to the short or sell side down here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16691300","16696300"," If we get too high up,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16696300","16698300"," I'll be looking to sell up here too, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16698300","16699300"," Sell up here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16699300","16700300"," Sell up here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16715300","16716300"," Valhalla baby."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16716300","16717300"," 438."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16717300","16718300"," 436."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16718300","16720300"," I see it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16720300","16721300"," Here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16721300","16722300"," Here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16722300","16725300"," Squeeze up on the Tuesday."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16725300","16726300"," Do we get there?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16726300","16727300"," I don't know."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16727300","16729300"," I'm still bullish here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16729300","16732300"," I'm 79 cents a barrel down at $1.17."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16732300","16733300"," So 1.54%."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16747300","16750300"," Saying all of this here, we're going to take a look at something else here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16750300","16752300"," We're going to take a look at the VIX."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16756300","16759300"," Right now we are trending up."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16759300","16763300"," You see it right there?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16763300","16766300"," There's your zone for trading right there."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16766300","16769300"," As long as we stay in this zone."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16769300","16772300"," We're going to go to the right and up."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16772300","16775300"," If we begin to break down,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16775300","16778300"," we're going to go to the right and up."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16779300","16783300"," If we begin to break down below this zone,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16783300","16785300"," I'll start getting bearish in here, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16785300","16788300"," You see it right here, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16788300","16791300"," We start breaking this stuff."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16791300","16797300"," The hourly trigger is going to be"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16797300","16800300"," what you need to know."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16800300","16802300"," So 429.03."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16802300","16805300"," You do not have to worry about it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16806300","16811300"," You do not want to see price go below 429.03 right now."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16811300","16814300"," I do want to show you something here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16814300","16816300"," We are getting toppy."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16819300","16822300"," We have a declining velocity here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16825300","16828300"," Whenever I see this, it looks like that over there, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16828300","16831300"," And then we start to collapse."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16831300","16833300"," So this is not a good sign."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16835300","16838300"," That right there is not a good sign for bulls."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16838300","16841300"," I didn't see that until just now."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16841300","16843300"," So looking at this right here,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16843300","16844300"," I'm not a fan of that."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16844300","16846300"," Even if price goes higher,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16846300","16850300"," what it'll do is set up, it'll set up"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16850300","16853300"," a pretty big and hard and heavy role."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16853300","16855300"," So I don't like seeing that right there."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16855300","16857300"," I always like to buy the dip"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16857300","16859300"," when we're down here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16859300","16861300"," Never like buying the dip up here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16861300","16862300"," I don't."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16862300","16863300"," I don't like it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16863300","16864300"," I will, but I don't like it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16865300","16868300"," I really like buying the dip down here, down here,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16868300","16869300"," that kind of stuff."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16873300","16874300"," You see it, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16877300","16880300"," I love buying on this kind of velocity right here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16880300","16882300"," When this stuff is happening right here,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16882300","16884300"," we're like a max bearishness."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16884300","16886300"," Velocity is coming back up."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16886300","16887300"," Max bearishness."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16887300","16889300"," Velocity is coming back up."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16889300","16891300"," I was looking for that trade right there."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16891300","16893300"," And that trade is not here, right?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16895300","16896300"," We're not right there, are we?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16896300","16898300"," We're not right there, are we?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16898300","16901300"," So, whatever this run is,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16905300","16907300"," I got my gnarly eyeball on it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16909300","16911300"," I don't like this right here either."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16911300","16912300"," This is the VIX."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16913300","16915300"," It's trying to find some support."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16915300","16917300"," I want you to notice something here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16917300","16919300"," Notice how the VIX is curving."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16921300","16923300"," Whenever I see this curve happening,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16924300","16925300"," it makes me think we're going to roll"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16925300","16927300"," and squeeze this up right here, okay?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16929300","16930300"," See how you see the VIX flattening?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16930300","16932300"," Whenever it's flattening like this,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16934300","16937300"," VIX will start to want to make its way higher."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16945300","16946300"," So, yeah, I'm looking for a cell."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16946300","16947300"," I have a feeling here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16947300","16949300"," Not a feeling, but my thought,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16949300","16951300"," my thinking here is that we're likely"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16951300","16954300"," going to get a cell signal here in the next few minutes"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16954300","16955300"," and we're already having it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16955300","16957300"," It's already happening."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16963300","16965300"," So, be real careful in here to this close."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16966300","16970300"," Expectation from here is at least 4, 2, 8,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16970300","16972300"," 5, maybe even lower."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16974300","16975300"," When I'm looking at in the background,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16975300","16977300"," it's looking kind of suspect."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16977300","16979300"," The bull case to the upside."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","16979300","16982300"," It's looking pretty suspect to me."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17010300","17011300"," If you don't have your hedge on yet,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17011300","17012300"," you should."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17015300","17017300"," Today, Monday, Tuesday,"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17017300","17018300"," you're going to get a rug pull at some point."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17018300","17019300"," I assure you of it."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17022300","17023300"," Hold on here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17040300","17041300"," Is that a good answer for you?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17061300","17062300"," Oh, there to go."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17062300","17063300"," It goes again."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17064300","17068300"," Oh, boy."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17076300","17077300"," Do you think spies rolling?"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17088300","17089300"," Oh, yeah, bear town."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17094300","17095300"," I think July is good."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17095300","17096300"," I think we have a good month in July."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17097300","17099300"," I think that I think we're up in most of June."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17101300","17105300"," I think we're up in July as well."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17105300","17106300"," Hold on a second here."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17111300","17113300"," I think the first week of July is going to be really good."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17116300","17119300"," What I would not do is do not discount the volatility next week."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17119300","17122300"," We've got news, economic news every day."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17124300","17126300"," It's like landmines all next week."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17132300","17133300"," Yeah, I sold in May."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17133300","17134300"," I made some good money selling in May."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17136300","17138300"," I think I just think it's tempering your expectations."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17139300","17141300"," I think we went over it yesterday."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17142300","17145300"," Went over like your expectations for a bull market."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17145300","17146300"," What selling means."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17147300","17151300"," I think that I think that a lot of people think selling may or"
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17152300","17157300"," people think what the down move is is deeper than it actually is."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17157300","17161300"," I think people are trained to 2022."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17162300","17166300"," And so when we say, yeah, it's going to roll over that they expect like 3,200."
"qMKyCtrkYJc","17169300","17170300"," So I don't see that."
