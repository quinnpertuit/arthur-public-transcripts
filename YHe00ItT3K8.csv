"5060","6580"," Alright, this should be better."
"6960","8100"," I just rebooted everything."
"8500","10500"," I cleaned out a bunch of crap in the background. "
"12140","19860"," It looked like we had a streamlabs crash of some kind, and then it started to reboot itself in the"
"19860","20080"," background."
"20380","24380"," There were like two or three instances of streamlabs slapped by itself."
"25400","27180"," We'll see if this works this time. "
"40760","42040"," It should be back again."
"49640","51060"," This looks like it worked."
"76070","77510"," This looks like it's working again. "
"79050","87970"," Yeah, you know what happens is, you know what happens is, we're not what happens, but there's a few"
"87970","89370"," things that could be going on."
"89370","99350"," Often times, so it seems to happen here is like streamlabs OBS sucks, but I"
"99350","102830"," don't have the time to do the work that I need to do for streamlabs."
"105330","106990"," There's like two versions of streamlabs. "
"107150","109570"," One like you built, like there's Linux and there's Windows."
"109570","117650"," We use the Windows version here, but also even so, if I don't turn things off and reset them"
"117650","122550"," everywhere and time passes."
"122870","127410"," I don't know why, if I don't stream for a couple days, that's normally when I run into issues. "
"127729","133970"," I reset the internet at the smart on the router, reset one of the computers, but then did not reset"
"133970","134550"," the other ones."
"134550","144330"," So I'm assuming that it's just like a, like a, like a doom fucking mismatch information just"
"144330","149770"," fighting with it with it with it with it with each other each other this morning."
"151090","152490"," So stream is back up again. "
"152810","153670"," It should be good to go."
"155550","157570"," I'll post something in the discord below."
"157570","158090"," Right now. "
"227610","233430"," It's 11.30 a.m. Eastern time, the U.S. sells 79 billion dollars in three month bills."
"233870","239470"," Prior high yield, five spot, two, four cents in a private cover of two spots, six, five in the U "
"239470","242170",".S. sells 70 billion dollars in six month bills."
"242810","247650"," Prior high yield, five spot, one, zero, five percent in a private cover of two spot, five, nine. "
"320360","342040"," All right."
"342220","342600"," Sorry."
"342780","344920"," I'm trying to talk to people in discord right now. "
"346020","348300"," So we used to have an open discord."
"350520","352420"," And it just got out of control."
"352920","359780"," It was out"
"359780","363900"," of control. "
"366040","368700"," I felt horrible even having that discord."
"368880","370300"," At one point, I'm like, fuck this."
"370440","371080"," We're shutting it down. "
"371560","372380"," I'm like, I don't care."
"372460","377280"," Anybody says like that discord, like a financial discord's period."
"377720","380680"," If they're open to the public, be very wary. "
"381120","382060"," I got a warning of that too."
"382240","387620"," Like if you're ever, if you're a member in an open free discord related to any kind of thing"
"387620","391820"," finance be very wary, like extremely wary."
"391820","396660"," Like the difference between a free and open financial discord and one that's going to pay well on"
"396660","404780"," it is night and day because you're then like from the website side, you can like request all kinds"
"404780","405160"," of shit. "
"405300","409200"," We haven't done that yet, but we're about to start like, Hey, we want your fucking phone number,"
"409200","412540"," your email address, your kids names and all that stuff."
"412760","416980"," But when you put the two or three steps in front of these scammers and bots, it's a beautiful"
"416980","417360"," thing."
"417360","418900"," They're that gorgeous thing. "
"420100","420580"," Absolutely."
"422100","423500"," Someone was asking right now."
"423660","425940"," The key point behind this too is if anybody. "
"426980","431380"," From the old discord, like, like is, is friending you from that discord."
"431900","434740"," You're likely a bot or scammer trapped in that discord."
"435200","435560"," This is a point. "
"435780","435900"," So."
"437660","441160"," I would only ever like, you guys, this is another point to you."
"441420","442900"," This is a, if you're a follower. "
"444500","447000"," If you're a follower of anybody on discord, right?"
"448560","453380"," This works as well on other social media, but specific to discord."
"455880","457660"," You want to always be."
"458920","463060"," In a public, not a free discord, but it's going to be in public in a discord. "
"464020","467440"," And anyone that even if you're like, you're getting friendly with somebody, yeah, this that well, I"
"467440","468580"," guess it's fine inside of it."
"468580","469620"," Like if you're in the discord, right?"
"470220","471360"," And you want to be my friend."
"472820","474320"," Or I want to be your friend. "
"475200","481800"," The safest thing that I could say to you would be to be having a public in the discord"
"481800","482580"," conversation."
"484660","489360"," Like your name is, I don't know, let's pick up a name like your name is."
"492560","494360"," Your name is name. "
"495400","496180"," Give me a name."
"496440","497660"," Like your name is stop."
"498100","499680"," That's your name. "
"501160","502740"," And my name is go."
"503560","506320"," So I'm going your stop and we meet each other."
"506980","508900"," Or no, or I get a friend request from you. "
"509360","511960"," And your name is stop and you're like pick up Jim."
"512159","512900"," I want to be a friend."
"514520","520260"," Regardless if it's a paid discord, a free discord, an open discord, no matter where you are. "
"520840","525720"," If you're in discord and your name is go, the guy named stop says to you."
"525880","526580"," Hey, I want to be your friend."
"526840","528940"," In your life. "
"529580","531420"," I know this guy from discord."
"531880","532740"," This will be close here."
"533260","534760"," Sense and private to cover. "
"534760","535560"," So."
"536740","537860"," Listen close to this."
"538020","541380"," So I know there's a guy out there in a discord named stop. "
"542700","543780"," That's all I know."
"544440","546220"," And I've conversed with him, let's say."
"547240","549020"," He tries to become my friend. "
"551080","552020"," Here's the difference."
"553040","555920"," When stop tries to become my friend, I should have."
"556760","559240"," Already just had a conversation with stop. "
"560020","564420"," Or stop should have just already had a conversation with me inside of a discord."
"565340","565660"," So."
"566780","568540"," If I see that if I'm like, oh. "
"569440","571080"," I know that stop person."
"572000","573500"," They're in the same discord as me."
"573560","575240"," We play a fortnight together. "
"576240","579700"," I should still go to that person and say, hey, stop."
"580040","583400"," It's me go to do request friendship with me."
"584000","586540"," That is the that is for me. "
"586660","592260"," At least what I found to this point is the only way that you would get a DM for me"
"592260","596580"," or that I will accept your friendship or offer you friendship."
"596640","600080"," So if I'm going to become your friend out there."
"600700","606060"," I likely need to speak with you directly on discord. "
"606060","608060"," This is told it's true for Twitter too."
"608560","612780"," If you attempt to DM me on Twitter and I haven't reached out to you and there's a bunch of"
"612780","613580"," reasons for this."
"614380","616960"," There's, of course, the scams and the bots and the fraud. "
"617820","623300"," But then there's other things you'll have people try to set you up for nefarious things too."
"624640","626740"," So you want to be careful of that as well."
"627840","629780"," Now, this might be like this could be anything. "
"631000","634600"," I have like, I have, I have like men and women out there."
"635000","641440"," I don't talk about this a lot, but like I haven't been a woman that contacts me and some are"
"641440","641780"," trying."
"642020","648880"," I've had I've had a had a woman set me up that tried to befriend me and then tried to"
"648880","652720"," lure me into lurid things. "
"653380","655820"," And when I declined, she got mad."
"656600","661740"," Now, I don't think she was a scammer or a bot, but I most definitely think that she was looking"
"661740","663860"," for something to say negatively."
"664300","667800"," Hey, there's some screenshots of this guy acting this specific way or whatever. "
"668020","670860"," And the other thing too is you open yourself up to fake accusations."
"671720","675840"," I don't care who you are, you can have like five followers and they're like, Hey, look, this guy"
"675840","678800"," responded and, you know, he's showing me his dick pics, even if it isn't true."
"678800","681560"," So just be careful out there. "
"681880","683560"," I like sometimes I even forget."
"683740","686540"," I'm like, Oh, I know that person on Twitter and I'm going to start blabbing with him."
"687020","690840"," It's really nice if you go in public to people and say, I don't know. "
"691020","691560"," Hey, stop."
"691940","692740"," This is go."
"693340","695460"," Do you want to have a conversation in DM?"
"697220","698700"," And then that have them say yes. "
"699200","704540"," And then you just have a conversation with them on via DM on any social media."
"706140","707880"," That's how my brokerage broke it into."
"708920","715200"," I used to show too much and I wasn't speaking to I thought I was speaking to and they had"
"715200","717160"," enough information and they got in. "
"717400","721020"," So just a word of recommendation or a prior experience."
"721660","726460"," Do not believe ever even if you think you're like, I know that person."
"726460","730540"," It might not actually be the person that you do know as a friend elsewhere. "
"734390","734790"," Yeah."
"737330","738430"," You know, it sucks too."
"738550","743050"," Because if you're just like a painter or something or a landscaper or, I don't know, you're in like"
"743050","744830"," a restaurant town. "
"745030","745610"," Like people don't care."
"745870","749730"," But around financial stuff, people get really weird."
"750670","752510"," You're like, you're a target. "
"753510","755230"," Like the 1000 people might be fine."
"755390","756550"," It's one out of 1000 or not."
"757530","759750"," You might be like, well, it doesn't affect me or whatever. "
"759750","761230"," I'm sure it's real."
"761510","762570"," It really does happen."
"762570","763150"," It happens a lot. "
"763870","770810"," And it's very, it's very risky and dangerous and you're always exposed to it."
"770950","776230"," So it's the same as swatting and shit like that."
"776930","778470"," Like that shit's all bad shit too. "
"778650","778730"," Right?"
"779050","780450"," Like it's legit."
"797190","798130"," There we go."
"798230","799230"," Just parking the bus today. "
"799310","799810"," I've done shit."
"800010","801750"," Looks kind of like a reversal still."
"802790","804750"," You got that low right there. "
"804870","806330"," You got that low right there."
"806550","807130"," You got one more."
"807130","811170"," If that holds and you see that, that would look pretty fucking bullish to me. "
"812390","813850"," So just like waiting for a little bit more."
"814030","815750"," You get the one and then get down there."
"815970","819210"," You got the, you know, you got the roundish thing right there. "
"819210","821450"," And you got the, you know, like kind of thing right there."
"822330","824230"," And it's not there quite yet."
"824450","825630"," Just, just, just sit in your hands. "
"825790","825950"," Relax."
"826750","829270"," If you're a bull, just kind of like hanging out."
"829490","829970"," See what happens. "
"830770","832550"," You know, you want to be above the hourly trigger."
"834850","837410"," So until that happens, you really got no trade here."
"840980","842180"," Oh, this is big though. "
"842840","850720"," U S five year inflation expectations rise to 2.9% in February from 2.5%. U S three year"
"850720","857200"," inflation expectations rise to 2.7% from 2.4%. That's the New York Fed."
"858460","861520"," Consumers hold steady on expected income and earnings gains in February."
"861780","865240"," Consumers are more downbeat on the job market in February. "
"866280","867500"," That's to be expected."
"867780","871920"," February expected year ahead rent rise is the lowest since 2020."
"871940","872720"," That's good to see. "
"873640","876360"," Expected home price rise flat."
"876600","878200"," I don't know if that's really good either."
"878200","881800"," Some of this data is like seasonal data. "
"882720","884260"," Like, yeah, we're in February."
"884680","886180"," Like, what do you expect in here from housing?"
"887140","891800"," Take that same reading in April and it's going to be, you know, whoa, cocaine, baby."
"892620","897400"," Even if it doesn't, even if we don't get that, those sales into June or July reports. "
"898320","904720"," You're expecting this to be the, like everybody that's trying to sell or buy is out there."
"904880","906900"," Like anyone trying to sell or buy right now."
"906900","910560"," It's literally in the middle of painting their walls in their kitchen. "
"911260","915220"," And I don't know, cleaning up the leaves in the backyard and stuff like that."
"916060","920660"," So no one's thinking about, I guess, or that mentions that thinking, they're just not to market"
"920660","921180"," right now."
"921280","924940"," So what else do we have here?"
"925500","926860"," We have more data, just more data crap. "
"927100","929340"," That's looking like more volatility."
"930080","931120"," Fall, baby, fall."
"931120","938760"," And this fall, if you, the market brief last night showed you the, of all surface, right?"
"939540","942340"," Showed you guys volatility lasting into the 12th. "
"943140","944240"," Today is the 11th."
"945380","949120"," So that's another hint here that the doom is going to be out for the rest of today."
"958790","960190"," You move an airman yourself. "
"960690","967070"," Yeah, it's like really like, it's really bizarre like, I don't know, like the whole like."
"968450","969470"," I need it."
"969590","971330"," What I need is a drop Twitter account. "
"971690","973330"," I was trying, what I was trying to do is."
"974590","979670"," To be honest with you guys, I'm trying to like remove like captain, like tier captain, Jim James"
"979670","980070"," away."
"981490","984850"," And like do everything on trade, the trigger, the handle. "
"985770","988990"," So I keep making really raunchy posts on Twitter."
"994390","999810"," Because I want my own handle, like I want like, maybe I should just create a drop handle on"
"999810","1000130"," Twitter."
"1002090","1008050"," Maybe I should just do that, like create like a, like captain, Jim James with like a fake nose and"
"1008050","1009850"," a mustache and like glasses on. "
"1013210","1014790"," I've been accused of that too."
"1015150","1016710"," I've been accused of my friends too."
"1017210","1018670"," Like Chaz was a good friend of mine. "
"1019170","1023490"," And he's like Chaz with DM and go, is this your handle?"
"1024490","1025190"," Is this you?"
"1025310","1026869"," And I'm like, no, and he's like, are you sure?"
"1027089","1028329"," And I'm like, I swear it's not me."
"1028970","1030490"," I would tell you if I had a drop handle."
"1032109","1035010"," But you would tell all my friends, like, I got a drop handle over here. "
"1035050","1035270"," It's mine."
"1035490","1036770"," This is where I'm at right now."
"1037910","1039790"," You can get like, you know, like a hundred followers. "
"1040550","1041990"," I follow you follow me."
"1041990","1044270"," It sucks."
"1044750","1051150"," Like when you hit 10,000, I want you to know something like a thousand followers to about 10,000"
"1051150","1053470"," followers is the sweet spot. "
"1054090","1057070"," The moment that you hit 10,000, all bets are off."
"1057450","1059070"," Everything's everything's, everything's stupid."
"1059070","1061630"," It's like it just gets stupid. "
"1061810","1062410"," You get detractors."
"1062770","1063250"," You get trolls."
"1064030","1066170"," You get trolls that don't know that they're getting you followers. "
"1066710","1068250"," It's so, it's so bizarre."
"1071210","1073470"," Trills are like, you're always wrong."
"1073770","1074970"," And you're like, dude, just keep doing that. "
"1075250","1076590"," Like, I'll tell all your friends."
"1079030","1083530"," Like the more emotional you get, you don't want 10,000 plus followers."
"1084170","1084870"," Trust me. "
"1085290","1086030"," You don't."
"1086250","1087130"," Like there's a sweet spot."
"1087330","1088870"," Like right around a thousand is like perfect. "
"1089810","1095210"," If you can get a thousand people that you know, or meet, or you're like, hey, this guy's following"
"1095210","1095390"," me."
"1095450","1096250"," This girl's following me."
"1096290","1096970"," This guy's following me. "
"1096970","1098230"," You have like great conversations."
"1098550","1099370"," You can hang out on Twitter."
"1099570","1100550"," Nobody cares who you are. "
"1101150","1102010"," Nothing like it."
"1103310","1107090"," You don't, you don't want to, you don't want 10,000 or more than that ever again."
"1108110","1111290"," Because they account becomes a bullshit at that point. "
"1111890","1116670"," It's like a, it's like a, you can't even carry on a conversation with people."
"1116710","1118390"," You'll have like, you'll, you'll say anything."
"1118570","1123050"," You could say the fucking sky is blue and some guy's going to be like, oh, I'm actually, I study"
"1123050","1123730"," the color charts. "
"1123730","1127650"," I've got a PhD in color theory and you are wrong."
"1128150","1133830"," And I'm going to explain it to five page Twitter, Twitter dissenting opinion right now."
"1134230","1137570"," As to why you're calling something blue, not fucking blue. "
"1138250","1142810"," And you're like, as, and you're like sitting there going, of course you can do that."
"1143910","1145990"," The fuck are you talking about?"
"1150570","1151550"," It's absurd."
"1156670","1157390"," Trust me. "
"1157690","1158770"," You don't want followers."
"1161170","1165930"," It just, it becomes a, it's just becomes a, um, a service thing."
"1166770","1168270"," It's like, it's like Elon. "
"1169330","1171250"," You know, do I think Elon's a Republican?"
"1171470","1171830"," Fuck no."
"1172830","1175630"," I don't think he gives a fuck about Republicans or Democrats."
"1176130","1176690"," Motherfuckers rich. "
"1177690","1183510"," I'm sure these guys, I'm sure he hired somebody that's like, here, I'm going to show you how to"
"1183510","1184870"," have, how to get a reaction."
"1186510","1187950"," You know, we're like plebs."
"1188050","1190110"," We're like, oh, why is he doing this?"
"1191310","1192530"," It's for fucking. "
"1193230","1197610"," So remember that conversation we had the other day about people with wealth."
"1198830","1201210"," And they need certain things in their lives."
"1202370","1203490"," Elon needs to be approved. "
"1204190","1206590"," He needs, he doesn't care how he gets it."
"1207190","1208570"," He doesn't care if it's bots."
"1208890","1210890"," He doesn't care if it's real. "
"1210890","1213690"," But he's, he's probably got someone smart out there going."
"1214030","1218750"," Well, if you say these things right here, or if you take it from this perspective, you're going to"
"1218750","1221350"," get a lot of feedback and you're going to feel good about it."
"1221750","1223410"," You know, that's some fucked up shit. "
"1223990","1225270"," But that's probably what it is."
"1225470","1230150"," So with Elon in particular, you know, he needs to reach the masses."
"1230950","1233750"," You know, like that, that's some Rome shit in there, right?"
"1234530","1237070"," It really is like, what do you think we should do this week?"
"1237890","1240850"," What do we think we should do this week, Emperor Jim James?"
"1241530","1242070"," Fuck it. "
"1242210","1243310"," Let's start feeding motherfucks."
"1243530","1245490"," We'll start feeding motherfuckers to the lions today."
"1246490","1247890"," Start that shit back up. "
"1248050","1248790"," That'll rile them up."
"1250790","1253650"," They got enough blood and blood guts and doom out there."
"1253830","1255590"," Let's just start feeding people to lions. "
"1256470","1257330"," See how that goes."
"1258510","1259610"," Well, are we getting a reaction?"
"1260510","1260990"," Keep doing it."
"1262370","1264810"," Let's get more people to the Coliseum right now. "
"1269030","1270390"," It's fascinating on that too."
"1270630","1276170"," I didn't really care for the Napoleon movie, but I found it so hilarious."
"1277290","1279130"," This is the Ridley Scott version, I think. "
"1279650","1282530"," What I found hilarious was they're in the French Revolution."
"1283390","1286330"," Whether it was true or not, it's very true about life."
"1287510","1290190"," You know, it was like, we're going to, I'm going to get up there and I'm going to tell you"
"1290190","1291630"," to kill all these people over here. "
"1291630","1292230"," And so they do."
"1292590","1293890"," And then they pick out another group."
"1294070","1295130"," They're going to kill all these people over there. "
"1295170","1295570"," And they do."
"1295710","1297890"," And they kill another group of people in prison."
"1298070","1298950"," A whole bunch more people. "
"1298990","1300570"," And then there's nobody left that put in jail."
"1301250","1304650"," So the masses look at you and they're like, you know what?"
"1304870","1305390"," How about you?"
"1305710","1306830"," We're going to get your ass now."
"1307130","1311830"," Remember the guy that like, I'm not going to tell you guys the whole movie, but just that whole"
"1311830","1313150"," sequence of events. "
"1313410","1319430"," I was like, this is fucking, that's like a mirror image of what's going on out here right now."
"1321850","1322990"," Yeah, it was very inaccurate."
"1323390","1330570"," I agree that the Napoleon movie was inaccurate, but I did like the thought process. "
"1330770","1332210"," They're getting across on some of this stuff."
"1336330","1337450"," Yeah, it was pretty bad."
"1337650","1338390"," I'll be honest. "
"1338630","1339310"," I turned it off."
"1340050","1340990"," I couldn't finish it."
"1341130","1341710"," It was so bad. "
"1342570","1343710"," I couldn't finish it."
"1345250","1347790"," No, and I wasn't really a fan of Oppenheimer either."
"1347990","1349830"," Oppenheimer wasn't a fan of that movie either. "
"1350750","1352590"," I'll be honest."
"1353390","1362610"," I think we still get great films, but I think the age of filmmaking, the golden age of filmmaking."
"1363750","1373450"," Like right when practical effects and CGI merged social media, advent of social"
"1373450","1379290"," media, the advent of writers not having mentors and writing rooms. "
"1380230","1387010"," That ended the non consumption of books and novels, like, let's be honest."
"1388050","1396010"," And then the fleeing of this talent to other avenues of getting the work out there."
"1396610","1400210"," Because fundamentally changed the landscape of our future with filmmaking. "
"1401390","1402890"," Not that one would have great filmmakers."
"1403410","1405070"," Just it's not what it was."
"1405450","1408370"," Like what it was is likely never coming back ever again. "
"1409070","1414690"," It's possible we could have a resurgence or like a renaissance, but I think that and then we're and"
"1414690","1417830"," then these kids today, dude, it's like my daughters this weekend."
"1419230","1422890"," We were watching some films and I noticed this."
"1422890","1424450"," My children. "
"1425430","1435430"," Love movies that they can like stop and talk and pay attention to something"
"1435430","1435790"," else."
"1436710","1440130"," And then and then come back to that moment of action."
"1441290","1443010"," It's really weird like. "
"1443630","1445070"," They expect."
"1450130","1451790"," Or like they're being taught."
"1453330","1455550"," Hey, this is a moment you're supposed to pay attention to. "
"1457030","1457470"," Right."
"1457830","1459630"," And then you don't pay attention anymore."
"1459910","1464250"," This is like every five minutes, like five minutes of an action or some kind of sequence. "
"1465450","1466890"," It's really loud normally."
"1467150","1470550"," It's really like it's always like boom, boom, boom, this, that and everything."
"1470950","1472890"," And then when you get into the wall. "
"1474410","1479450"," It's just fucking filler being made these days instead of that moments being important to the"
"1479450","1480150"," story, maybe."
"1480890","1482350"," They're just like removing it."
"1482470","1483890"," It's like we're going to put some bullshit over here. "
"1483990","1487050"," It's not going to impact the next big sequence we have coming."
"1487650","1490370"," And we know that these kids don't won't pay attention to it anyway."
"1490630","1492650"," So it doesn't it's inconsequential to the film. "
"1493870","1497710"," So of course we switched to a movie this weekend that was consequential."
"1498670","1499450"," Like you had a big moment."
"1499450","1503670"," And you come into a consequential part of the film that you had to pay attention to. "
"1503970","1506110"," My fuck like I should be saying at the F word."
"1506310","1509150"," My kids were like, da, da, da, da, da, da, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"1509290","1511210"," And I was like, hey, I think they're saying something that's important. "
"1511290","1512890"," And my kids were like, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"1513210","1513730"," I'm like, okay."
"1513990","1514750"," So let's go on the conversation. "
"1515130","1515990"," So the three of us are talking."
"1516430","1519090"," And they switched back into another boom part."
"1519330","1520930"," And my kids were like, what's going on?"
"1521390","1523430"," And I was like, yeah, I can see this is happening. "
"1524090","1524810"," You can see it."
"1527550","1528410"," What did he say?"
"1528490","1530530"," Everything is a blockbuster big budget movie."
"1534260","1534780"," Yeah. "
"1534900","1535040"," Yeah."
"1535260","1535400"," Yeah."
"1535600","1537860"," I realized the DVD sales are part of this. "
"1539120","1541080"," And they're think about it."
"1541260","1544120"," There is some great produced content."
"1544920","1550600"," Even long format that comes off of other avenues today. "
"1551820","1554280"," I watched the guy called Alt X."
"1555300","1557120"," Over the weekend Alt X or something."
"1557660","1561960"," He did an expose on Tyrion Lannister a while back."
"1562600","1564640"," And then he did one on Jon Snow this weekend. "
"1565300","1569660"," It was like an hour or two, it was a two hour video that he made."
"1570140","1571200"," It was well produced."
"1572000","1574160"," You could tell that he put time and effort into it. "
"1574340","1577080"," You can tell that some serious people were working on that."
"1577820","1581760"," And when I see things like that, I'm like, you can't get that made in Hollywood today."
"1581760","1585120"," But that would be a great show for like history channel. "
"1585380","1587580"," This guy put it out for free on YouTube."
"1588320","1589500"," Like, wild."
"1590520","1593500"," I think his name is Alt X or something like that or Alt. "
"1593800","1595060"," I don't know exactly what his name is."
"1595600","1599380"," It was the real Jon Snow or something like that from Game of Thrones."
"1600020","1604080"," And it was like, I watched that on a history channel. "
"1604080","1605680"," I'd be like, that's great content."
"1606360","1607760"," So think about that."
"1607760","1611980"," The caliber of some of the content coming out elsewhere today. "
"1613860","1615760"," I haven't watched Shogun yet, I want to."
"1617060","1621260"," I started season two of Tokyo Vice."
"1622400","1624400"," That's the TV show I'm watching right now. "
"1625380","1627300"," Oh, I did watch something really cool."
"1628360","1628740"," I watched."
"1630220","1631340"," I watched. "
"1633220","1634580"," Hold on here."
"1634580","1635720"," Let me look it up."
"1647510","1650350"," I just watched a drug store June. "
"1652490","1653830"," Drug store June."
"1654190","1654950"," I thought it was great."
"1656250","1659250"," Everyone I watched and said they would never watch it again, but they loved it. "
"1659510","1662510"," And it was like nails on a chalkboard for two hours."
"1663270","1664130"," And it really was."
"1664930","1667010"," It was very self deprecating. "
"1669870","1671190"," Someone like me."
"1672390","1677390"," And then it also, but it was very like, oh, even my kids were like, this is real."
"1678070","1679610"," They were like, this is absolutely real. "
"1680110","1681270"," Did anybody see that movie yet?"
"1681430","1682770"," Anybody see drug store June?"
"1684210","1685790"," Let me know in the chat if you've seen it."
"1686270","1687550"," It's, it's awesome."
"1688870","1691990"," It's going to be nails on a chalkboard, but it's hilarious. "
"1694290","1698390"," It was great comedy and nobody can see nobody said yes to that."
"1698390","1700210"," Look that one up to drug store June."
"1700410","1702830"," Do not watch the trailer. "
"1703510","1703990"," Warning."
"1704350","1705590"," Do not watch the trailer."
"1707210","1708610"," Do not don't bother. "
"1709310","1711310"," They have like a bunch of the jokes are in the trailer."
"1711610","1712990"," Not all of them, but a bunch of them."
"1713670","1715150"," You're, you're wasting your time. "
"1715150","1716990"," Just go watch it drug store June."
"1717550","1720690"," If you have the chance, check that film out, especially like comedy."
"1722850","1724270"," Or if you like. "
"1728930","1734670"," If you guys like any of that kind of self depreciating comedy, I haven't looked at to see if it"
"1734670","1735750"," got slammed by Reddit."
"1735950","1738490"," I'm assuming it's going to be slammed by Reddit, but it was great."
"1740030","1740770"," Good morning, David. "
"1740910","1741290"," How are you, man?"
"1741410","1741790"," Good to see you."
"1749070","1750110"," Actually, it's cyan."
"1754470","1757780"," The Game"
"1757780","1765020"," of Thrones document. "
"1765020","1765340"," Pretty decent."
"1766440","1767300"," Pretty decent."
"1767500","1767580"," Like. "
"1769080","1773340"," Like he talks about the book, the difference between the books and the TV show."
"1773760","1778700"," Basically, this is what the real terrain is in the books versus what was presented in the TV show."
"1800750","1806970"," David saying sideline say not liking the bid ass spread since London on June contract volume on the"
"1806970","1810410"," June contract now exceeds the March contract, not trading the March anymore. "
"1811670","1814010"," If you're a futures trader, low X trader."
"1815250","1816570"," Thanks for that insight, David."
"1820150","1821670"," All right, I'll be right back with you guys. "
"1821850","1823450"," Once again, I'll be back here in just a bit."
"1823770","1825750"," I got to finish up what I was doing while I got it."
"1825930","1827170"," Well, the stream shut down. "
"1827690","1829050"," They're back with you guys in just a few."
"1830050","1831050"," Squeezing up right now."
"1831370","1833970"," S&P trying to squeeze above break higher. "
"1835290","1838030"," We've got what looks like an inverse setting shoulders here."
"1838490","1844310"," Still no trade for the bulls unless they're above 512.09. And even then I'd like to see a back"
"1844310","1848310"," test of 512.09 for continuation to the upside."
"1849330","1851710"," Keep your eyes in this gamma chart down below here. "
"1852390","1856370"," We are rotating through, I believe, but we've got SPX gamma down below."
"1856850","1862330"," If you didn't notice this, this is the gap that needs to be filled the screen box on SPX."
"1862330","1865750"," Still not quite there, though, are we still leaving that gap?"
"1866270","1871190"," Even if we had higher, we are returning to the gamma flip line right now. "
"1871190","1875870"," If you want to see what this red bar is, this is the gamma flip right here that we're trying"
"1875870","1876550"," to break above."
"1877490","1880150"," Just so you can see this down below here."
"1881690","1882430"," Let me see me. "
"1882510","1885470"," I'll bring that one in right there so you can see the gap that's left behind."
"1886270","1888510"," I'll make this maybe more transparent."
"1888510","1889630"," Can I do that?"
"1890650","1891710"," There we go right there. "
"1891930","1894830"," A little bit more transparent down there so you can see that gap."
"1896310","1899570"," I bet bulls would love to see that gap get filled today."
"1900250","1904710"," If I had to guess, bulls would be like, close that fucking gap so we can start marching higher. "
"1905910","1906850"," I've had anything in just a minute."
"1922620","1924180"," Do, do, do, do, do."
"1926040","1926640"," Acting. "
"1927400","1929880"," There's more attention on those names."
"1930320","1935360"," For industrials and energy names, I think there just has not been the same level of attention."
"1936100","1938580"," You guys are ultimately a wealth management firm. "
"1939820","1946440"," How do you link investment returns with initiatives like this, especially at a time where DEI in"
"1946440","1947660"," general has faced pressure?"
"1948280","1957380"," I think the DEI in sort of the political sphere has come under fire, but companies are not turning"
"1957380","1965580"," away from paying their employees fairly, from increasing diversity, and they understand the value"
"1965580","1965920"," in that."
"1966060","1972040"," We have seen so much research that shows that more diverse companies perform better."
"1972200","1973120"," They're actually more innovative. "
"1975300","1981060"," They're better on risk metrics, better on return on equity, stock price performance, and so"
"1981060","1987780"," companies that are really being proactive on closing these pay gaps are poised to outperform."
"1988360","1995080"," Do you see the corporate response to the DEI pushback sort of out there and overt, or companies"
"1995080","2000560"," like, you know, we're going to say less about it, but continue to move along with the policies we"
"2000560","2001220"," had in mind anyway?"
"2001220","2007240"," Yeah, I think unfortunately companies are saying less about it, but there's no slowdown in what"
"2007240","2009800"," companies are doing because it just makes business sense."
"2010300","2015260"," And what we're talking about here, closing pay gaps, better for companies, better for investors. "
"2016220","2017560"," There's a recruiting tool."
"2018780","2019300"," 100%."
"2019300","2025280"," If you're going to attract and retain top diverse talent, move them up the ladder, create more, you"
"2025280","2028500"," know, stronger, more robust companies, you know, this is a great way to do it. "
"2028500","2031920"," Should these disclosures be mandated by governments?"
"2032420","2035720"," Because we've seen some experimentation right with California and other countries."
"2035960","2038580"," Yeah, we've seen California start to mandate this data."
"2039040","2044820"," In fact, there's many countries around the globe that mandate that this data is either disclosed"
"2044820","2046720"," publicly or disclosed to government. "
"2047380","2051639"," And the reason that is is because they see when it's disclosed, the gaps actually shrink."
"2052420","2057500"," And in the United States, that's not in the case, but what we see here in the scorecard, which is"
"2057500","2063679"," really something to celebrate, is you've got, you know, over 50% of the companies in the scorecard"
"2063679","2065739"," are disclosing quantitative pay gaps."
"2066219","2069139"," You compare that to the S&P 500, it's 25%. "
"2069139","2074040"," So you really see the leadership in these larger companies, the companies that investors are"
"2074040","2076199"," engaging with, even outside of mandates."
"2076820","2081620"," It would be great to have mandates because then, you know, like in the exchange, you have data that"
"2081620","2086960"," everybody can see, it's transparent, it's standardized, but we will get there."
"2087260","2087960"," And it's investable. "
"2088340","2089280"," And it's investable."
"2089500","2090060"," Yeah, you got it."
"2090280","2092719"," Natasha, thank you very much for sharing the results with us. "
"2092940","2094260"," Natasha Lamb from Arjuna."
"2094760","2095219"," Thank you."
"2095699","2101660"," Coming up after the break, a timeline of OpenAI's leadership changes as Sam Altman now rejoins the"
"2101660","2101860"," board. "
"2102060","2102420"," Don't go anywhere."
"2217330","2222070"," I'm going to give you guys a note from the bros over at Gamma Labs this morning."
"2222250","2226490"," They were saying volatility opened higher on Monday. "
"2226730","2231230"," Well, at the money, volatility term curve has shifted substantially higher."
"2231450","2234430"," We made a note of that yesterday on Sunday and the market brief for today."
"2235490","2240950"," As traders anticipate increased uncertainty ahead of the CPI print on Tuesday. "
"2242150","2243710"," So keep an eye on that."
"2244710","2247590"," We also noted that last night on Sunday that."
"2250090","2255450"," I also noted on Sunday that that gamma or that volatility is not. "
"2255630","2257710"," I'm reading your note about gamma bros."
"2257990","2265950"," I'm also noting here that that gamma or that volatility is not lower until Tuesday on the 12th."
"2265950","2271910"," And we remain heightened after the 12th, even though that volatility kicks. "
"2272370","2278950"," Or really is really there's a relief of that volatility on Tuesday, the 12th."
"2279930","2281150"," Let me see here."
"2281490","2285310"," But funds rate futures continue to walk back overly. "
"2285590","2291850"," Devish rate path expectations and are currently implying about 80 BPS worth of cuts for 2024."
"2291850","2297170"," We also saw the update from financial juice this morning with 75 BPS."
"2298350","2302890"," SVX dealer gamma is 152 M down from 391. "
"2303490","2308170"," That also that also means there's less of a stranglehold in the market as well."
"2308590","2310270"," Gamma flip is at 51 10."
"2310670","2311950"," Call walls at 5200. "
"2312550","2314290"," Zero date put walls at 5100."
"2315010","2318150"," Local resistance is at 5150."
"2319370","2321230"," We also have more note here. "
"2321370","2325270"," I'll read some of the rest of this to you this morning, and then we'll get back to CNBC."
"2326530","2329590"," There's a discussion side note side of things."
"2329870","2331590"," 5100 to 51 10. "
"2332350","2336670"," Zero date put wall and gamma flip is the main downside level to watch for today."
"2337610","2339910"," So 5151 10."
"2340650","2342090"," If you look down below here. "
"2342990","2347310"," You will see that we are right around that zone right right now right down here right around that"
"2347310","2347590"," zone."
"2348270","2352570"," We're looking for that hopefully that gap to get filled in even if it doesn't for some kind of"
"2352570","2354070"," local support here at the moment."
"2354250","2356550"," We are seeing that second bounce right now. "
"2357150","2358310"," What else are they saying?"
"2358610","2363050"," Well upside is limited to 51 51 75."
"2364250","2368430"," So just a heads up if you're watching right now, the upside target."
"2371010","2375350"," Is right down here somewhere inside of here. "
"2375350","2378310"," So I'm going to draw now this doesn't make it so right."
"2378550","2385970"," We already know how this goes that we already know that we put it right here right in there."
"2388070","2390830"," We already know that this shit doesn't always work out right. "
"2391290","2396770"," We're not going to we always hear the gamma bros are assigned absolutes."
"2396890","2399670"," I don't know if they actually make absolutes, but they're assigned them."
"2400830","2404570"," So we're looking for a range somewhere in this vicinity right here. "
"2405730","2407870"," Right in there with crayon bros."
"2409430","2411430"," An expected range not guaranteed."
"2413330","2417690"," But also note that tomorrow the CPR I report will likely inject volatility. "
"2417890","2419610"," We also have a 10 year note auction."
"2420130","2424110"," Later that day at 1 p.m. that will be followed by a 30 year bond auction on Wednesday."
"2424850","2425930"," This is important. "
"2426710","2430770"," This was inside of your market brief last night."
"2430770","2438510"," And we discussed last night the T note 10 year note auction and the bond auction coming as well."
"2438990","2443390"," So just note here that let's look at this bottom chart really quick. "
"2446290","2454210"," So the thesis here is that we're parked on volatility for the CPI print right in that."
"2454370","2456610"," Wait a minute here pause that."
"2456610","2461550"," And we've got we have the 10 year note auction right. "
"2461990","2464230"," We've got the 30 year bond auction."
"2464510","2466550"," This is all on Tuesday right and Wednesday."
"2467210","2472830"," So let's say we even if we came up here right close that gap right down there. "
"2473490","2476850"," And then you close this gap on volatility into Tuesday morning right."
"2477390","2481110"," And then once that all comes off you have the opportunity to trade up here."
"2481910","2484690"," Okay, so just be aware of this path right here. "
"2485650","2492190"," Into the vol surface the money vol surface into tomorrow for the 12."
"2492670","2494230"," Let's keep your eyes on that one."
"2495590","2497790"," We're going to switch back to the market brief right now. "
"2498690","2500190"," Oh sweet I was on camera still."
"2504830","2506930"," Oh no I'm in the wrong in the wrong thing here."
"2509190","2510730"," I should have been naked or something. "
"2511610","2514690"," So there's your so there's your vol so I want to make some a little bit more yellow."
"2514690","2515350"," It looks green."
"2518230","2520970"," We're going to make that a little bit more yellow up there right there. "
"2521230","2521470"," Perfect."
"2521970","2523510"," There we go."
"2524110","2526430"," Note this note this down here. "
"2526610","2528610"," Note this this little bit down here."
"2528970","2531910"," So I'd say there's even a possibility of a move like this."
"2533390","2534370"," Move up here. "
"2534530","2540690"," Maybe close that gap rejects right down and then that's your that's your you know, volatility is"
"2540690","2542490"," left the room for the moment."
"2543070","2544690"," That could be tomorrow afternoon."
"2546110","2547970"," Into that could be tomorrow. "
"2549030","2550070"," Into the."
"2551270","2553950"," 30 year bond auction on Wednesday actually."
"2554610","2558630"," So you have 10 10 year later in the day tomorrow and then you have 30 year on Wednesday. "
"2560210","2566010"," Also note that European recap market dip CCB considers rate cuts where you talked about that to you"
"2566010","2566430"," this morning."
"2567190","2570190"," APAC recap B O J policy speculation."
"2570950","2575710"," The Nikkei dropped over 2% admits ongoing speculation that the Bank of Japan. "
"2578150","2581250"," Will end negative rate policy at next week's meeting."
"2582170","2587030"," Now that is that is something that is bring that for you there."
"2588730","2596410"," Material to the U.S. markets. "
"2601290","2604490"," So there's some some rotation of money into China looks like as well."
"2605410","2610710"," Just on thoughts of maybe China pumping some more money into the system."
"2611170","2613990"," Sorry I'm trying to pay attention all this stuff over here. "
"2615010","2616330"," Going on right there."
"2619700","2621500"," Let's see if you can show some of that up there."
"2624260","2626840"," Leave that little tick right up here for it to look at. "
"2628820","2629300"," All right."
"2629340","2631040"," That's all I've got for you guys back here in just a minute."
"2637980","2638900"," It's all next week. "
"2640600","2642420"," Let's get to the judge in the half of post nine."
"2645520","2645980"," All right."
"2646040","2646940"," Welcome to the halftime report. "
"2647120","2648980"," I'm Scott Walker front and center this hour."
"2648980","2654460"," The momentum unwind as several of the best trades here to date are reversing investment, committing"
"2654460","2657320"," now debating whether that trend will continue and how to play the market."
"2657320","2659240"," Right now joining me for the hour today. "
"2659680","2664720"," Joe Terranova, Amy Raskin, Steve Weiss, Jim Labanthal will take you to the market today."
"2664920","2667400"," I would just go on CMV and ask them all."
"2667480","2668320"," Are you short the markets?"
"2668800","2669460"," Pretty simple, right?"
"2669720","2670160"," Back. "
"2670500","2675800"," I think Amy, our focus remains on Nvidia, which is red again too."
"2676000","2681440"," Now a few moments ago it was green, but this remains I think the big story of the market for"
"2681440","2681980"," obvious reasons."
"2682120","2684880"," Questions about whether it's topped, whether an unwind is coming. "
"2684880","2686920"," We haven't seen you in a few weeks."
"2686940","2690040"," And you've been trimming this name like many others who sat on this desk."
"2690340","2690500"," Yep. "
"2690640","2692580"," We've owned this name for a very long time."
"2692580","2701040"," Also another note here that the White House estimates 2025 unemployment rate of 4% versus the rate"
"2701040","2707860"," of 3.9% estimates of 3.8 for 2028, 2034 period."
"2708320","2710020"," White House is also estimating. "
"2711020","2720960"," The U.S. real GDP growth at 1.8% in calendar 2025, 2.0% in"
"2720960","2727440"," 2028 and 2.2% in 2034 based on forecast locked in November."
"2728420","2737120"," Now that is important that this isn't making it so, but this is being released right now."
"2737120","2741000"," Does is cause for concern at least on the unemployment side. "
"2741600","2745340"," We don't want to see an employment start to go vertical off 4%."
"2745340","2749180"," That can lead to some real consequences for the stock market."
"2749560","2752560"," This looks more like a talk out there to keep the markets. "
"2753200","2756360"," Tamped down because it actually isn't happening just yet now."
"2766010","2775310"," In 2025 versus 16 spot 5% in 2023, growing to 20 spot 3% in 2034 and estimates debt"
"2775310","2782150"," held by public at 102 spot 2% of GDP in 2025 versus 97 spot 3."
"2782330","2784110"," Actually, some of these reports aren't so bad."
"2784110","2785570"," Some of this stuff looks pretty good. "
"2785690","2787510"," 6% in 2034."
"2789130","2811080"," Me, frankly,"
"2811400","2813520"," the trigger is going to probably be CPI tomorrow."
"2814120","2818900"," We think it's coming in a little hot, but you know, as long as it's in line with expectations, this"
"2818900","2819660"," trade continues. "
"2819900","2823300"," If it's too hot, then maybe that's the time to take off some money from this chip."
"2823440","2823560"," Why?"
"2823720","2828840"," I'm wondering who else is in danger of any kind of rollover from the chip trade that's been just"
"2828840","2832700"," absolutely on fire, not just the SMH, which is reflective of the trade itself."
"2832700","2836980"," But, you know, since November 1st, super micro is up 350%. "
"2838040","2838480"," 350%."
"2838480","2842920"," You got arm and AMD are up more than 100% respectively."
"2843100","2844960"," Taiwan, semi's up 63%. "
"2844960","2846180"," It's another positive fault today."
"2846560","2848040"," Qualcomm's up 56%."
"2848040","2849840"," Broadcom's up 53%. "
"2849840","2851020"," I mean, there are others on my list."
"2851720","2855340"," Do we need to look down that list and say, okay, that one could be in trouble."
"2855820","2857080"," That one looks like it's susceptible. "
"2857080","2863260"," Maybe the AI Halo got a little bit above the or ahead of the fundamentals."
"2863580","2864600"," How do you look at this?"
"2864820","2865900"," Well, you own Taiwan, semi, right?"
"2866080","2867080"," I do own Taiwan, semi."
"2867360","2872880"," Taiwan, semi to Amy's point, you know, that stock, I bought it fourth quarter last year. "
"2873000","2873780"," It's up 50%."
"2873780","2875680"," I mean, that's just unusual."
"2876160","2877740"," And I had trimmed Taiwan, semi. "
"2878000","2878560"," It took a little off."
"2878940","2881520"," That's just prudent because it just got to be too big a position."
"2882980","2885520"," But it's a very easy answer to question, actually. "
"2885520","2889940"," Just go and look at Nvidia reported after the close."
"2890360","2896420"," Just go and look at what the top performers, what the stocks that did the most on the day after"
"2896420","2897020"," they reported."
"2897480","2900700"," And that'll tell you what's more susceptible than others. "
"2901120","2903860"," Look, I think that some are clearly ahead of themselves."
"2904340","2907000"," Some clearly have no valuation support."
"2907640","2908980"," I don't know that Nvidia is there. "
"2909300","2915080"," I mean, you know, forget about what the stock's done 35 times forward and Jim had it right if"
"2915080","2917000"," you're going to keep growing your earnings 50%."
"2917000","2919160"," But they won't keep growing 50%."
"2919160","2920720"," And that's really the issue. "
"2921100","2922800"," So the point is where you really get off."
"2922920","2927040"," Now, I think that there is a lot of people that want to come into it still that haven't bought"
"2927040","2927380"," it yet."
"2927520","2927860"," Nvidia. "
"2928060","2930440"," Nvidia, so that'll keep some floor under."
"2930680","2933760"," Battle of the floor is at 700 or 600 or here."
"2934040","2935280"," I own very little of it. "
"2935520","2937180"," I just bought it on a dip last week."
"2937460","2940580"," And for me, it's just not that important to my portfolio."
"2940920","2942020"," But Taiwan, semi years. "
"2942020","2945560"," The Taiwan semi today price target goes to 150 from 125 at first."
"2946260","2947140"," Reiterated outperform."
"2947380","2948620"," They expect stronger growth. "
"2948840","2949440"," It's a market multiple."
"2949480","2950260"," Second half of this year."
"2950620","2951240"," It's a market multiple. "
"2951460","2951880"," And guess what?"
"2952160","2954420"," If you own Nvidia, you just kind of look at Taiwan semi."
"2955160","2958940"," Because guess who is manufacturing those chips for them and for all the others?"
"2959580","2963880"," So they're basically the supplier in an armchairing this fight to all of them."
"2964100","2965340"," They're sort of company agnostic. "
"2966240","2967780"," You've got to get a major part of their production."
"2968020","2970400"," But also, you know, Asmel, ASML."
"2970400","2974740"," We were just talking about it right before this. "
"2975040","2977960"," And they've just got new products coming out."
"2978340","2981320"," They will be arming Meta and Microsoft in Intel."
"2981700","2982560"," So I mentioned last week. "
"2982900","2984340"," So Amy's owned it for a while."
"2984660","2984720"," I assume."
"2984920","2985280"," I own it. "
"2985360","2986920"," I think the future is extremely bright there."
"2987120","2987740"," But it's not cheap."
"2988140","2990400"," If you go out a year and a half, it's 25 times. "
"2990980","2991100"," Right?"
"2991240","2992100"," But right now it's not cheap."
"2992200","2995300"," This is a question really about momentum, which is why I saved Joe for last."
"2995820","2999540"," Your full investing strategy professionally is around momentum. "
"2999540","3000360"," Obviously."
"3001140","3007500"," So if you look at, you know, whether we're in early stages, early innings, if you will, of a"
"3007500","3008700"," momentum rollover."
"3009360","3011020"," Where you're going to have money going into laggards. "
"3011080","3015060"," I mean, Meta, Amazon, Salesforce, Broadcom, Uber, Microsoft."
"3015580","3016220"," They're all lower."
"3018020","3020600"," Apple, Tesla, Alphabet are all higher. "
"3021640","3025540"," That's telltale sign of a rotation from Momentum into laggards."
"3025540","3030860"," You're all over the list of the biggest winners since November 1st."
"3030940","3037200"," Whether it's your AMD, or your CrowdStrike, or your Palantir, your Broadcom, your Salesforce, your"
"3037200","3038640"," Arista, your Service now. "
"3039140","3040080"," And that's just for starters."
"3040480","3042400"," You have all of these holdings within the Joe T."
"3042840","3046780"," And all of them are up unbelievably from the most recent bottom."
"3047160","3047300"," Yes. "
"3048000","3053380"," That is why I have the overlay of quality on top of Momentum."
"3053380","3058500"," Exactly for the environment that you're in now, when Momentum begins to roll over, you don't have"
"3058500","3060060"," the exposure to the single factor."
"3060280","3063420"," But let me speak exactly towards what's going on right now with a market. "
"3064080","3068500"," The concern that I have is this is going to be the next several weeks going into the Federal"
"3068500","3068860"," Reserve."
"3069140","3073000"," One of the more dangerous periods of 2024 for investors."
"3073660","3078900"," Because they're going to be attempting to make decisions based on the price and performance of the"
"3078900","3079100"," past. "
"3079640","3082760"," Really, no new fundamental information."
"3082760","3084180"," We're past the earnings season."
"3085080","3089800"," And right now, the technicals are in control of the market. "
"3090240","3092060"," It's obvious that Momentum has broken."
"3092640","3094500"," Now, technical factors are taking place."
"3094560","3095140"," You look at Nvidia. "
"3095540","3097500"," You have to know your technicals in Nvidia."
"3097780","3099480"," Nvidia the low last week was 834."
"3100140","3102280"," The low this morning is 841. "
"3102700","3103760"," So that's a support area."
"3103760","3108260"," But the technicals are going to be in control for the next several weeks."
"3108480","3109960"," And the technicals don't set up well. "
"3110380","3114100"," And no, I don't think this is over where we see a Momentum correction."
"3114880","3120780"," Because what you're also witnessing is you really don't see a significant broadening out with a lot"
"3120780","3121360"," of Momentum."
"3121420","3123580"," Now overnight, Japan broke down. "
"3123920","3125080"," Have we seen crypto breakdown?"
"3125840","3130340"," That's arguably the hottest area of Momentum in the market right now."
"3130340","3137240"," So I think there's more to go in cooling off this white hot Momentum that we've had so far year"
"3137240","3137600"," to date."
"3137880","3145180"," And I just urge the viewers to understand that the process of correcting Momentum is technically"
"3145180","3145800"," oriented. "
"3146320","3152520"," That's a dangerous place to date when you don't have this fundamental market for all of the"
"3152520","3162100"," Momentum slash fraud slash exuberance slash euphoria has had this incredible ability over the last"
"3162100","3166220"," couple of years, if not longer, to self correct without falling apart."
"3166800","3175020"," You could go, you know, SPACs corrected, NFTs corrected, all this other nonsense self corrected."
"3175300","3177780"," So maybe you've got these Momentum names ahead of themselves. "
"3178440","3178960"," They're correct."
"3179360","3181100"," But you have the rotation."
"3181520","3184940"," So if money's coming out of the video, maybe it's finding a home in Apple or maybe it's coming back"
"3184940","3187020"," into Tesla or maybe it's going into the health of that. "
"3187180","3191540"," Well, let's also not lose sight of the fact for the last two weeks, the equal weight S&P 500"
"3191540","3194880"," and small caps have both outperformed the S&P 500."
"3195140","3195760"," Now it's only two weeks."
"3196000","3196560"," Equal weight. "
"3196760","3196980"," Okay."
"3197180","3197940"," There's a new high rate."
"3198180","3200880"," New high last week for the equal weight S&P 500. "
"3201120","3206480"," Also, did you realize that almost one fifth of that index hit a new 52 week high recently?"
"3206680","3207260"," This is great."
"3207660","3210800"," So it's not like you've had a vacuum."
"3211080","3216940"," You've had these stocks at the top go down and they're nothing else is shoring up the foundation. "
"3217540","3217760"," Yeah."
"3217940","3219380"," Well, that's the point."
"3219500","3220380"," The broadening is happening. "
"3220740","3225320"," I mean, it's possible for the rest of the market to come up to meet where the Magnificent Seven or"
"3225320","3226580"," Fabulous Five, whatever they are."
"3226700","3229720"," It's possible for them to come up and meet that performance and I think it's happening."
"3230460","3232740"," You know, Joe, I do see the broadening. "
"3232780","3238200"," I just mentioned an equal weight and in small caps, but I don't see quite the breakdown that we're"
"3238200","3243560"," talking about here in terms of Momentum."
"3244080","3246180"," You know, that's pretty strong Momentum."
"3246220","3249260"," I mean, if we look at Friday, sure it was down, but I mean, that's just just one day. "
"3249260","3252440"," We're talking about the reversal from Friday, which was incredibly powerful."
"3252440","3253600"," It has had follows."
"3253860","3254020"," Yeah. "
"3254120","3255200"," It was just one day."
"3255220","3256180"," It was just one day."
"3256300","3257640"," No, but I'm not disagreeing. "
"3257660","3260460"," It is just one day and one day doesn't a trend make."
"3260740","3266580"," But when a stock like Nvidia rolls a hundred bucks in a day, that's something that gets eyes wide"
"3266580","3266840"," open."
"3267420","3268080"," That's a good point. "
"3268080","3269820"," But let me just let me just say this really quickly."
"3270020","3270360"," Yes."
"3270360","3271540"," A hundred points in one day. "
"3271540","3272260"," I gotcha."
"3272440","3277160"," But also equally sort of strange is that it was going up two percent every day for like two weeks."
"3277440","3278380"," You know, I mean, that was strange. "
"3278640","3279100"," That was odd."
"3279320","3280140"," That needed to be corrected."
"3280140","3285480"," I think what we focus too much on these big stocks is the dollar priced movement rather than the"
"3285480","3286220"," percentage movement. "
"3286900","3291560"," And away from Nvidia on Friday and away from perhaps, well, even Meta."
"3291820","3294060"," Meta is down 20 bucks today."
"3294180","3295720"," I haven't bought more on the flush. "
"3296240","3297640"," But it's only down four percent."
"3297840","3300440"," And from the highs, it's nothing relative to where it's come from."
"3301080","3306460"," So I think that the momentum will be dictated by CPI and then PPI on Thursday. "
"3307260","3311360"," And then maybe we go into right now Palace at the stage for being more dovish."
"3311480","3312540"," So that could be another trigger."
"3312980","3315580"," It's only natural as I said a week ago and a week before that. "
"3315660","3317140"," And Joe was linked to February for the correction."
"3317640","3319960"," The market has to consolidate some points."
"3320380","3323660"," No matter what the tailwinds are, it's got to take a breather. "
"3323720","3325120"," So I really think that's all we're seeing."
"3325460","3326980"," Sure, valuations are extended."
"3327560","3331260"," But I think for good reason some of these stocks, whereas for others, they're not extended. "
"3331260","3334880"," Well, a breather, Amy, is a lot different than a slumber."
"3335400","3341520"," A breather means you take a rest and you don't go into a full long-term slumber in these names."
"3341780","3343940"," And you've got things like alphabet and apple. "
"3344780","3347300"," And, you know, look, Tesla has its own sort of issues too."
"3347460","3351780"," But alphabet, for example, Moffatt and Nathanson today are things really that bad, right?"
"3352220","3355880"," The narrative and the news has been so negative seemingly every week on this."
"3355880","3363000"," They say although sentiment is not as dire as the markets moved around meta in October of 22, we"
"3363000","3366680"," once again hear ourselves urging investors to stay the course and have trusted leadership will"
"3366680","3367780"," innovate through this challenge. "
"3368120","3372900"," It's been really easy to get really negative on names like apple and names like alphabet."
"3373300","3376820"," We've almost only heard negative sentiment around both of those names."
"3377340","3378520"," Now they're working a little bit. "
"3378940","3383940"," If they continue to work, then you're not thinking about Nvidia so much every single day."
"3383940","3388020"," I mean, honestly, I think there's so much noise around all of these stocks right now and so much"
"3388020","3388320"," attention."
"3388860","3391300"," You look at the biotech index over the past couple of weeks. "
"3391300","3393000"," It's done phenomenally well."
"3393220","3395820"," I think there are other areas of the market to focus on."
"3396460","3401320"," I do think if apple continues to correct, it maybe becomes more interesting, but it's still trading"
"3401320","3407800"," at a 25 times multiple for oak stock with almost no growth and, you know, a very high market"
"3407800","3408380"," capitalization. "
"3408620","3410220"," They do have the buyback to support them."
"3410540","3412660"," So it puts it in a little bit of a different category."
"3412660","3415700"," But I would look for this to broaden out. "
"3415820","3416780"," The market to broaden out."
"3416880","3423280"," I do think if CPI continues to come in as I expect and inflation continues to wane, that will"
"3423280","3424100"," support the market."
"3424760","3428600"," But I do encourage people to look beyond the magnificent seven at this point. "
"3428900","3429040"," Yeah."
"3429240","3431820"," Wolf goes to 5,300 today."
"3432280","3432380"," Right. "
"3433220","3436020"," They were more negative than most for a long period of time."
"3436220","3436840"," Now not so much."
"3437140","3439540"," 5,300 quote shifting to the no landing scenario. "
"3440360","3440380"," Okay."
"3440380","3441200"," Barons."
"3441340","3442660"," Bull still has plenty of fight. "
"3443400","3443840"," UBS."
"3444180","3447880"," It appears that three pillars that have supported U.S. equities remain in place."
"3448400","3453180"," So nobody's, you know, ready to give up the ship just because you could have a little bit of a"
"3453180","3454960"," momentum reversal for a little while. "
"3455380","3458200"," Without question, I think we're all saying the same thing."
"3458380","3463840"," I think what we're doing is we're trying to guide the viewers towards what's going on right now in"
"3463840","3464300"," this environment."
"3464860","3470960"," I think it's clear and I don't think anyone has changed their overall bias towards 2024 being a"
"3470960","3472460"," positive year for risk assets. "
"3472560","3473420"," You have all the conditions."
"3473480","3479060"," The fundamental conditions was set in place at the end of 2023 from the Federal Reserve to coming"
"3479060","3484440"," out of the earnings recession to the innovation where, which was reflected in earnings being"
"3484440","3486160"," witnessed from artificial intelligence."
"3486660","3488240"," That was the fundamental foundation. "
"3488240","3489220"," No one's saying that."
"3489240","3495520"," I just think what we're acknowledging is the price action on Friday in Nvidia, the price action in"
"3495520","3499840"," other stocks, which have appreciated the same extent."
"3500240","3500920"," Intuitive surgical. "
"3501360","3502420"," You could make the same argument."
"3502920","3508460"," Eli Lilly, AMD, these are all stocks that were up significantly year to date that are finally"
"3508460","3511900"," experiencing a much needed and healthy correction."
"3512480","3514040"," And I think that's full stop. "
"3514300","3515780"," That's what we're right now."
"3515940","3517080"," That's what this is about."
"3517460","3522340"," It doesn't mean it's an inflection point, but it also doesn't mean it ends in 24 hours. "
"3522600","3527020"," You know, to your point, intuitive surgical and amiable back there back and we worked together over"
"3527020","3527740"," 20 years ago."
"3528000","3531580"," I don't think a year ever went by where people said, wow, intuitive surgical."
"3531900","3533800"," Look at how overvalued that stock is. "
"3534280","3535260"," You know, and here we are."
"3535500","3536660"," So that's what they're saying now."
"3536960","3540420"," In a year or two years, you're going to say, wow, I should have bought intuitive surgical back"
"3540420","3540660"," then. "
"3540940","3543740"," Look, Google, I agree with you what Moffat Nathan said."
"3543980","3545540"," That's why I texted you last week."
"3546140","3548960"," And Kevin, I bought more because it was maximum negativity. "
"3549620","3550240"," We're talking about Google."
"3550500","3551620"," We're talking about presidential election."
"3552080","3552380"," We're advertising. "
"3552380","3553500"," You're going to pick up."
"3553720","3559280"," And by the way, they're still, until further notice, one of the two winners in AI right now that"
"3559280","3559900"," would be Microsoft."
"3560560","3564360"," So you've got to buy and selling out a discount to the market as well when I added to it. "
"3564560","3566580"," So those are when you got to take the opportunities."
"3567140","3568720"," Do we think Apple's found some pudding here?"
"3568920","3569160"," Yes."
"3569300","3570640"," As after dropping below 170. "
"3571520","3572660"," It got back above now."
"3572780","3574180"," It's almost 173."
"3575320","3578440"," You've had, you know, finally some buying in that name. "
"3578620","3584680"," You've had some buying because capital is moving out of the hot momentum area, the winners if you"
"3584680","3584960"," would."
"3585400","3593120"," And it's moving into Apple and it's looking at Apple and it's it's utilizing Apple as a port, so to"
"3593120","3599440"," speak, a source of where almost a defensive element and the element of, listen, we know this"
"3599440","3602160"," company buys back a significant amount of their shares."
"3602580","3605340"," They raise a tremendous amount of cash flow. "
"3605800","3607840"," So it's nothing more than a rotation."
"3608920","3611460"," So you're watching me right now."
"3611700","3612460"," I want you to be right. "
"3612460","3613440"," Obviously I have a position."
"3613680","3615480"," Look if it goes down to 160, I'd buy more."
"3615600","3617340"," But the technicals, I know this is your domain. "
"3618300","3619120"," Look a little ugly."
"3619400","3622680"," Just tell the clouds just to the, yeah, to the simple technician that I am."
"3622980","3625080"," I look at the 200 day about to roll over. "
"3625240","3629040"," The idea that the trend on the 200 day would go negative in a rising market is ugly."
"3629720","3634340"," The 50 day is, the 50 day just wants to cross the 200 day and you don't want that."
"3634920","3636200"," So let's just hope you're right. "
"3636340","3637020"," I want you to be right."
"3637020","3643420"," You guys look at these names, the ones that I mentioned to you and say, well, I'm most worried"
"3643420","3646840"," about X stock that Tesla."
"3648260","3651580"," Yes, but that's one that has had no momentum. "
"3652020","3655940"," I'm talking about ones that have had a lot which have gone up a lot and you're all over these"
"3655940","3656160"," trades."
"3656700","3660140"," You look at, you look at down this list and saying, well, Palantir is up 76%."
"3660140","3661800"," I'm not saying anything about Palantir. "
"3662060","3663440"," I'm just using that as an example."
"3663440","3664960"," It's up 76%."
"3664960","3669120"," They're deemed to be one of the, you know, key AI players in winners. "
"3669580","3674700"," So if I'm going to worry about strikes up 80%, if I'm going to worry about the momentum trade, I'm"
"3674700","3678060"," going to worry about the strongest pillar of strength."
"3678120","3679060"," And that's Nvidia."
"3679540","3683960"," To me, Nvidia tells you everything about the momentum trade itself. "
"3684240","3684380"," Okay."
"3684520","3685420"," Well, then you just answered the question."
"3685680","3690920"," If Nvidia has lost its momentum in the near term, then what you're telling me is that arm is going"
"3690920","3692940"," to and that AMD is going to correct. "
"3693120","3698580"," Some of these other names are correct because it's all part of a universal momentum factor."
"3699080","3704480"," And in 2024, the momentum factor was up nearly 20% year to date."
"3704520","3710560"," You had strategies that were allocating towards the momentum factor and saying, okay, in the"
"3710560","3717520"," universe of momentum, which are the stocks that qualify as strong candidates in momentum in 2024. "
"3718180","3719320"," We're going to buy those stocks."
"3720160","3721720"," It's factor invested in its best."
"3721960","3726080"," So now Nvidia then is the litmus test now in this market on the momentum factor. "
"3726940","3728300"," That's what we're saying without question."
"3728980","3730980"," So then all these other names."
"3731820","3733720"," Well, here's, I mean, you asked this before. "
"3733840","3735800"," When I asked this, I want to state this more dramatically."
"3735800","3736440"," Don't you think Qualcomm?"
"3737020","3740340"," Yeah, I am in Qualcomm, but look, look, I need to sell chips."
"3740600","3741560"," I know I need to sell chips. "
"3741760","3742060"," I'm overweight."
"3742440","3743500"," I'm enjoying the ride right now."
"3743620","3747500"," I think the bigger point I would want to make and Scott, you were making this before is outside of"
"3747500","3748700"," tech, outside of chips. "
"3748700","3750120"," Things are starting to work again."
"3750380","3754080"," Things that I've been known and kind of kind of ridiculed on the show a little bit for."
"3754200","3754840"," And I get it, all right?"
"3754960","3756220"," But things like GM is working. "
"3756540","3757840"," Things like Qualcomm, by the way."
"3757920","3758880"," That's a pretty cyclical name."
"3759220","3759960"," Things like Citigroup. "
"3760140","3760920"," Things like the airlines."
"3761380","3762300"," Things like Cleveland Cliffs."
"3762720","3763560"," There's a lot of stuff. "
"3763680","3764280"," I know you were going to mention."
"3764280","3764880"," No, no, no."
"3765240","3767900"," But you couldn't get through anything without mentioning Cleveland Cliffs. "
"3767920","3770280"," Couldn't get through the first block without it mentioning Cleveland Cliffs."
"3770280","3771140"," It's doing great."
"3771260","3771960"," It's doing great. "
"3772160","3773300"," But here's the overall point."
"3773540","3777500"," If we're going to worry about Nvidia and I'm with you on that Joe, I think we can take a"
"3777500","3778460"," heck of a lot of comfort."
"3778700","3781380"," That's the rest of the market is doing well. "
"3781820","3783160"," The rest of the market is doing well."
"3783400","3785640"," Listen, I think you're misunderstanding."
"3786780","3788140"," I'm not disagreeing with you. "
"3788340","3788660"," No, I know."
"3788880","3792600"," What I'm trying to communicate is I'm just trying to define the environment."
"3793480","3795720"," You're making a fundamental argument. "
"3795960","3796160"," Yes."
"3796520","3799360"," And I see everything that you see in the fundamentals."
"3800120","3807360"," But what I am telling you is that if Nvidia is going to continue to have negative momentum, then"
"3807360","3814100"," everything associated with momentum is going to correlate with that and move in the same direction"
"3814100","3814600"," as Nvidia. "
"3815420","3816440"," Irrespective of the fundamentals."
"3816900","3818120"," But you know what I see."
"3818540","3819040"," That's what I mean. "
"3819200","3820300"," I'm not disagreeing."
"3820420","3821660"," I'm adding to what you're saying."
"3821980","3823480"," But let me tell you how I look at that. "
"3823620","3827260"," I look at that as opportunity because I'm not buying things because they have momentum."
"3827800","3829240"," As a matter of fact, I'd rather than issue."
"3829500","3830040"," Are you in Bitcoin?"
"3831120","3832060"," That's the one thing. "
"3833460","3834360"," That's the one thing."
"3834360","3835440"," That's the one thing."
"3835480","3835820"," That's the one thing. "
"3835860","3836600"," That's my investment."
"3836820","3837760"," That's the one thing."
"3837860","3838580"," That's the one thing. "
"3838580","3841680"," Doctor, I've cut back on everything to really get my health into it."
"3841700","3843460"," I'm only having three drinks tonight."
"3843780","3845640"," But by the way, otherwise I'm good. "
"3846000","3846340"," Great trade."
"3846720","3847900"," No, actually, it's not momentum."
"3848560","3849000"," It's not momentum. "
"3849540","3850000"," Momentum's there."
"3850420","3854140"," What I'm buying is the marketing prowess of fidelity and BlackRock."
"3854460","3855180"," But that's what I'm buying. "
"3855440","3856300"," You're in this moment."
"3856480","3856720"," Come on."
"3856820","3857340"," Come on. "
"3857520","3858180"," Let's be clear."
"3858560","3860780"," That's the epitome of the momentum trade is Bitcoin."
"3861540","3863940"," Without a doubt, but I'm not buying the momentum. "
"3864620","3865640"," I'm telling you what I'm buying."
"3865820","3865900"," Yeah."
"3865900","3868640"," But you've added to it as it's continued to go up. "
"3868640","3868680"," Yeah."
"3868740","3869600"," You know why I added to it?"
"3869660","3870060"," Playing the momentum."
"3870340","3871560"," Take a guess why I added to it today. "
"3871940","3872180"," Okay."
"3872300","3873120"," Because it continues to go up."
"3873340","3873560"," No. "
"3873820","3875440"," Because you pay approved it for funds."
"3875900","3877340"," That's why I added to it today."
"3877740","3882700"," And because you had some moron on squawk box talking about how you can use it to buy gold sneakers. "
"3883040","3884260"," The question is you were over it."
"3884300","3884960"," You wouldn't."
"3885180","3889900"," You wouldn't be doing it if it didn't have this renewed momentum behind it. "
"3890560","3891660"," Here's whatever reason."
"3891940","3893400"," I'm glad you could read my mind."
"3893400","3894560"," You're not doing a great job. "
"3894740","3895320"," It's a good idea."
"3895400","3898200"," I don't understand why you're so defensive."
"3898460","3899160"," It's kind of obvious. "
"3899240","3900600"," I'm trying to straighten out."
"3901320","3902500"," I'm trying to straighten out."
"3902580","3903700"," We don't have enough time left in the block. "
"3904220","3904380"," Continue."
"3905340","3908300"," But when Bitcoin reached 60,000 before."
"3908720","3909680"," I didn't own any of it. "
"3909960","3910320"," Okay."
"3910980","3912580"," This is the time I own it again."
"3912620","3915320"," Because you've got every fund out there. "
"3915340","3918140"," Every fund company out there saying you've got to buy Bitcoin."
"3918800","3920460"," That's fundamental to me."
"3920780","3925120"," What do you mean you didn't own any of it until it hits before 60,000?"
"3925220","3926500"," You've been in and out of it here and there. "
"3926600","3928760"," I'm saying 60,000 when it hit years ago."
"3929320","3930540"," I know you were talking about it."
"3930620","3933140"," I thought you were talking about it back to 60 now. "
"3933420","3934540"," I'm playing again."
"3935040","3939240"," Every fund company in the world is rushing to market with a Bitcoin product."
"3939920","3941080"," That's why I own it. "
"3941380","3946900"," So I'm betting Fidelity and BlackRock are putting millions and millions of dollars in the market."
"3946900","3949620"," If it had momentum, just momentum, I wouldn't own it."
"3950100","3950320"," Okay. "
"3950600","3951720"," So that's why I own it."
"3951820","3953560"," If it goes down 15%, would you sell it?"
"3956020","3956380"," No."
"3956760","3957580"," Because I'll tell you why. "
"3960140","3961940"," Because you're still going to have the marketing of it."
"3962240","3966000"," And if it goes down 15%, I may not buy more."
"3966120","3966560"," I've got enough. "
"3966600","3969200"," It's speculative position, which I keep rather tight."
"3969780","3971540"," But no, as long as that keeps happening."
"3972220","3976580"," You've got now you've got wealth managers that are saying, okay, because they see approved it. "
"3976820","3979860"," I can put it in these, you know, in my client's portfolio."
"3980300","3980520"," Okay."
"3981700","3982960"," You can allocate towards it. "
"3982960","3983260"," All right."
"3983280","3983400"," Yeah."
"3983980","3984940"," I'm going to get to Washington. "
"3985060","3985720"," We have some breaking news."
"3986040","3988080"," I'm going to get to Megan Picella at the White House."
"3988260","3990200"," We're learning more about the president's budget for this year. "
"3990480","3992500"," Okay, Scott."
"3992760","3992980"," That's right."
"3993160","3997300"," So the Biden administration is proposing a 2025 budget today that would spend about seven point"
"3997300","3998480"," three trillion dollars. "
"3998940","4002600"," That's a five and a half percent increase from last year's proposed spending levels in order to"
"4002600","4007220"," have more money to devote to social security, to reduce the cost of childcare and offer more loans"
"4007220","4007960"," to small businesses."
"4008740","4012420"," On the revenue side, the White House expects to raise roughly five and a half trillion dollars."
"4012680","4014880"," That'd be a nine percent increase from last year's forecast. "
"4015320","4018900"," Do impart to proposals that would hike taxes on corporations and the wealthy."
"4019440","4024640"," Despite that rise in spending, the White House sees the deficit falling to about $1.8 trillion next"
"4024640","4024940"," year."
"4025200","4028680"," But as the deficit falls, the cost to service the debt is on the rise. "
"4029120","4033500"," That reflects in part an expectation by the White House that the long term mutual rate has likely"
"4033500","4033980"," risen."
"4034580","4041340"," The White House has interest costs will hit $965 billion in 2025, a 21 percent jump from last year."
"4041820","4043900"," Those costs will rise from there throughout the decade. "
"4044460","4049480"," Overall Biden is proposing a trillion dollars for discretionary non-defense spending and a stepped"
"4049480","4052120"," up $900 billion in defense spending."
"4052480","4052680"," Scott."
"4053900","4054720"," Megan, thank you. "
"4054760","4056420"," Megan Cassella at the White House there."
"4056820","4060660"," As you see with the details on the president's proposed budget, we're going to take a quick break"
"4060660","4061280"," when we come back."
"4061280","4064700"," So Amy's made a lot of moves since we last saw her at the end of February. "
"4064960","4065780"," We're going to document those."
"4066020","4067300"," White has some more new ones too."
"4067820","4069840"," We're going to do those along with our calls that they will do it next. "
"4073400","4075840"," Are you following the Halftime Report podcast?"
"4076600","4077500"," What are you waiting for?"
"4078140","4080060"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."
"4080780","4082320"," Follow the Halftime Podcast now."
"4101990","4107870"," According to France Info Radio, refinery fire under way at the S O X on mobile plant in Port"

"4121740","4125540"," Protect your trade from macro headline risk with financial use pro."
"4126040","4129300"," Now only $99 a year for our real time service."
"4236410","4248290"," All right. "
"4248350","4248610"," Welcome back."
"4248690","4250630"," We're going to document some of these moves that Amy's made."
"4250910","4253150"," All of these are on February 20th. "
"4253150","4256210"," So let's make sure everybody understands that, but we haven't seen you in a little while."
"4256210","4259730"," So American Express, you bought that's a new position for you."
"4259750","4260390"," It is a new position. "
"4260470","4261290"," Tell me why you bought that."
"4261290","4263350"," We were looking for more consumer exposure."
"4263510","4268790"," We're very underweighted consumer and we were looking in a lot of different categories and all the"
"4268790","4273650"," categories sort of lead led us to American Express, which is a financial, but we liked the leisure,"
"4273870","4279670"," the travel, the post pandemic consumer behavior sort of really excused to American Express's sweet"
"4279670","4279970"," spot. "
"4280150","4281330"," It's trading in a below market multiple."
"4281750","4282490"," It's not well loved."
"4282850","4284630"," So that's what that's where we went. "
"4284930","4285210"," Okay."
"4285830","4288330"," Netera, you also bought that's a new position as well."
"4288490","4289290"," It is a new position. "
"4289930","4293850"," Netera, it's a $11 billion diagnostic biotech company."
"4294270","4296110"," We think this is a really exciting company."
"4296590","4302550"," What it does is it tests, if you have cancer, it will take a sequence of your cancer and then"
"4302550","4305470"," take multiple blood tests to see if your cancer is coming back. "
"4305950","4308330"," It just had a clinical readout on ovarian cancer."
"4309330","4314570"," It was able to diagnose cancer recurrence 10 months earlier with 100% accuracy."
"4315190","4318810"," 40% of oncologists ordered a Netera test last quarter. "
"4319110","4322050"," This company is growing fast and it will be cash flow positive this year."
"4322210","4322390"," Okay."
"4322590","4323990"," We're watching that stock get a little bit of a move. "
"4323990","4325570"," You bought more Accenture ACN."
"4326230","4326470"," Tell me."
"4326610","4328430"," We bought Accenture again. "
"4328670","4331990"," This is the expectation for Accenture are relatively low."
"4332370","4333370"," It's not a cheap stock."
"4333650","4334930"," We put our Splunk proceeds. "
"4335070","4336770"," We had own Splunk, which was bought by Cisco."
"4337210","4340950"," We put our Splunk proceeds into Accenture to keep our tech waiting work."
"4341110","4343650"," We are a little bit underweight tech to just keep our tech waiting there. "
"4343650","4345250"," We have some big winners that you've trimmed Berkshire."
"4345710","4346410"," We trimmed Berkshire."
"4346650","4348470"," It's been straight up over the last couple of months. "
"4348470","4350290"," Big winner for us."
"4350430","4353110"," We like the company just trending to make room for other things."
"4353290","4355170"," Joe Laughs because he took it out of his JOT. "
"4355390","4357130"," I saw that out of the corner of my eye."
"4357270","4357730"," It's not quality."
"4358650","4359410"," It's not quality. "
"4359750","4360950"," It's the definition of quality."
"4360990","4361390"," Costco."
"4362790","4365330"," That's another one of these stocks that's been around a high. "
"4365990","4366770"," It's been around a high."
"4366950","4368310"," It had a tough earnings last week."
"4368730","4372110"," But we trimmed it at lower levels than even after the decline from earnings. "
"4372110","4374630"," Again, just straight up for the last couple of months."
"4374670","4377490"," We really like the company, but very expensive at this point."
"4377670","4379850"," What about vertex and Regeneron, which you've both trimmed?"
"4380090","4383390"," We like both of those names longer term Regeneron's one of our biggest positions. "
"4383830","4387410"," We were making room for Neterra, so we think that has more upside going forward."
"4388030","4389650"," We still really like Regeneron."
"4389810","4390870"," Vertex, we like as well. "
"4391050","4393810"," But a lot of the good news from their pain medicine is now in the stock."
"4394030","4394270"," Okay."
"4394530","4394870"," Steve Weiss. "
"4395250","4396430"," A couple of moves here."
"4396550","4398350"," You sold Freeport FCX."
"4398650","4399210"," Why'd you do that?"
"4399210","4401710"," You know, I just didn't want the commodity exposure. "
"4401990","4403910"," I'm still uncertain about the economy, candidly."
"4404410","4405630"," Still uncertain about China."
"4406450","4409530"," And so when it bounced, it got danced like 35, 36. "
"4410270","4413530"," And I bought a little more, but I just wanted to get out of it."
"4413630","4414950"," It wasn't a big enough position to matter."
"4415350","4416330"," It turned out to be a nuisance. "
"4417450","4421930"," And I probably also wanted to do the Joe T, along with the other 125 stocks."
"4422050","4423210"," I saw you laughing at that, too."
"4423350","4426410"," Well, I mean, if you want me to fire him up, I can just paraphrase. "
"4426790","4428430"," He sold it because it's not going up anymore."
"4428430","4431510"," No, I sold it because it's too small."
"4432250","4435490"," I sold it because I don't think fundamentally the economy is going to drive it higher. "
"4436550","4437570"," You bought more ADM."
"4438150","4439390"," Archer, Daniels, Midland."
"4439850","4440770"," Pure moments of play. "
"4441110","4441210"," No."
"4441590","4443130"," No, no, no, no."
"4443330","4446090"," I think they're getting close to resolution. "
"4446210","4447170"," Three minutes and three seconds."
"4447370","4452890"," And the companies come out and they've reiterated that any changes resulting from the investigation"
"4453350","4455970"," aren't going to change the earnings guidance for this year."
"4456590","4457650"," And it's a very small problem. "
"4457650","4458530"," So that's why I bought it."
"4458690","4462190"," If it goes, if when that comes out, the stocks go right back to the 80s."
"4462210","4462390"," Okay. "
"4462650","4465930"," So let's do a few calls in the time that we have before we need to take a break."
"4466290","4469850"," Let's do Lily, Joe, since we've been talking a lot about momentum."
"4470690","4476550"," Two calls today reiterated, overweighted Morgan Stanley, reiterated outperform at BMO. "
"4477430","4480070"," So Morgan Stanley says price target's going to be 950."
"4480490","4485030"," They maintain that BMO maintains the price target at 865."
"4485970","4486210"," Okay. "
"4487050","4487730"," You own it."
"4487810","4488850"," You agree with both."
"4489630","4495830"," Fundamentally, the story is as compelling as any story that you could find in the healthcare"
"4495830","4496690"," sector. "
"4497350","4500430"," The stock has benefited from momentum."
"4500910","4503710"," It has benefited from a technical breakout."
"4504730","4510790"," But potentially the journey that it is taking might find itself spending some time sitting in"
"4510790","4514070"," traffic or maybe having to get off. "
"4514650","4518210"," Use the rest stop for a little period before it goes back on the journey."
"4518730","4521090"," And the reason for that, again, goes back to momentum."
"4522550","4523210"," I don't know. "
"4523310","4523690"," You veered off."
"4523950","4525810"," I lost there."
"4526010","4526610"," Into the rest stop. "
"4527230","4528530"," It called a tow truck."
"4529310","4530070"," Joe needs help."
"4531210","4534970"," Netflix, wise, price target goes to 725 from 615. "
"4535470","4536390"," And that's at Oppenheimer."
"4536670","4538090"," They reiterated outperform."
"4538690","4541330"," Obviously, they like the long-term subscriber growth on the upside. "
"4541950","4544010"," I bought a few months ago on a dip."
"4544250","4546510"," To me, they are the winner in streaming."
"4546830","4547110"," They're profitable. "
"4547790","4549110"," They sell pricing power."
"4550050","4551930"," They are adding content to it."
"4552410","4555710"," And all the others are just continuing to try and catch up to Netflix. "
"4556370","4559570"," So if there's one real winner, one profitable winner, it's Netflix."
"4559990","4563070"," Now, the stock bounced before I could make it a meaningful position."
"4563230","4564230"," So it's a pretty small position. "
"4564890","4566350"," But I'm not selling it."
"4566350","4570130"," I don't think it's cheap at all."
"4571070","4572510"," So I just can't buy it here. "
"4572790","4574270"," But, again, fundamentally, they're a winner."
"4574430","4576670"," Amy Nike, which you trimmed late last year."
"4576770","4578430"," Is this thing turning anytime soon?"
"4578650","4578830"," I hope so. "
"4579070","4580870"," Because Guggenheim says it's the best idea."
"4581330","4582990"," They say it's going to be breaking out in 24."
"4583530","4584210"," Price target 130. "
"4585190","4586850"," I think it's early to say it's breaking out."
"4586970","4588850"," I think from a long-term perspective, I like Nike."
"4589170","4589710"," We trimmed it. "
"4590570","4592030"," It has a lot of exposure to China."
"4592310","4594130"," It has more competition than it's had in the past."
"4594130","4598710"," I think it will ultimately win, but I'm not sure this is the time to add. "
"4599210","4601290"," Alright, let's get the headlines now with Contessa Brewer."
"4601570","4602030"," Hi, Contessa."
"4602310","4602810"," Hi there, Scott. "
"4603150","4608330"," US Central Command announced there was another humanitarian aid drop over Gaza today to provide"
"4608330","4609570"," critical relief for civilians."

"4667710","4669070"," Notching yet another all time hard."
"4669290","4670630"," Bitcoin ETF is on fire today."
"4670990","4671470"," Bob Pezzani. "
"4671970","4674330"," He's following that today in ETF Edge right after this break."
"4847110","4847630"," Kramer."
"4849750","4854410"," All right, we are back with Bitcoin hitting another record high today, breaking through 72,000,"
"4854510","4855770"," almost 75 now. "
"4856290","4859630"," Let's get to Bob Pezzani with a look at the crypto surge in today's ETF Edge."
"4859790","4859930"," Hey, Bob."
"4860150","4860390"," Hey, Scott. "
"4860750","4866510"," For the ETF community, Bitcoin is the gift that keeps on giving since the 10 spot Bitcoin ETF began"
"4866510","4867650"," trading in mid January."
"4867850","4871990"," Flows have steadily increased, but can investors handle all this volatility?"
"4871990","4874250"," Let's talk with the managers of one of those Bitcoin ETFs."
"4874690","4877310"," Matt Hogan is the CIO of Bitwise Asset Management. "
"4877570","4879830"," He runs the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust."
"4880030","4880930"," That's B-I-T-B."
"4881570","4886490"," Matt, they started trading the nine new spot Bitcoin ETFs since they started mid January. "
"4886790","4891690"," I've seen about 20 billion in inflows, including 1.3 billion into your ETFs."
"4891890","4897130"," Grayscale has seen some outflows, not surprisingly, but just tell us who's buying your ETFs."
"4897250","4897850"," These ETFs. "
"4897930","4898310"," Is it retail?"
"4898970","4899510"," Is it institutions?"
"4899950","4901830"," Do you have a sense of who's buying?"
"4902510","4903550"," Yeah, I do, Bob."
"4903770","4906130"," It's sort of everyone, everywhere, all at once."
"4906850","4912330"," Right out of the gate, the initial buyers are retail investors, registered investment advisors, but"
"4912330","4916650"," we're also seeing hedge funds, venture capital funds, and others lining up. "
"4917010","4922090"," Soon, we think we'll unlock major wealth management platforms, the Morgan Stanley's and Wells"
"4922090","4925990"," Fargo's, and we're even seeing corporates lining up to get into these funds."
"4926530","4929710"," A lot of the floodgates are open, not all of them."
"4929710","4934650"," It's some retail demand, but there's an increasing share of professional investor demand, and I"
"4934650","4935990"," think that share is growing. "
"4936410","4937950"," So that's my next question."
"4938130","4941670"," What kind of institutional acceptance or resistance are you seeing?"
"4941850","4947190"," So, for example, how many of the wire houses are allowing trading in your spot Bitcoin ETFs right"
"4947190","4947370"," now?"
"4947810","4953110"," They're mostly allowing it on an unsolicited basis, which means that if a customer asks, they can"
"4953110","4954370"," facilitate that trade."
"4954370","4959450"," But we think in the next weeks or months, and it could be as soon as weeks, you'll start to"
"4959450","4964670"," see these major wire houses allow solicited investing into these Bitcoin ETFs. "
"4964670","4969070"," That means that the advisors can suggest to their clients that it might be helpful for their"
"4969070","4972250"," overall portfolio to add a small amount of Bitcoin exposure."
"4972810","4978010"," And historically, that's when you see sort of massive flows from those platforms, and that's what I"
"4978010","4978130"," expect."
"4978130","4982650"," So, if you're at Merrill or Morganstown, you'll ask, you might be able to be allowed to trading,"
"4982790","4983610"," but it may not be on the platform. "
"4983970","4984710"," Is that the point there?"
"4985070","4987250"," You may be able, depending on your situation."
"4987990","4993170"," So, a lot of these new investors coming into Bitcoin through these ETFs may not be used to the kind"
"4993170","4994210"," of volatility we're seeing."
"4994390","4999510"," I mean, we had a low of what was it, 39,000 in January to over 70,000 today. "
"5000190","5005710"," Is there a correlation that Bitcoin is correlated with that can satisfy investors who are concerned"
"5005710","5006130"," about it?"
"5006130","5007730"," It doesn't seem to be an inflation play."
"5008470","5009270"," Is it correlated with tech?"
"5009510","5010590"," Is it correlated to nothing?"
"5010770","5012630"," Is it a completely different asset class itself?"
"5013450","5017090"," You know, I think Bitcoin is its own asset that going through a period of price discovery."
"5017450","5022010"," Before these ETFs, only a small fraction of the global capital markets could access it. "
"5022250","5026210"," And now everyone can, and we're seeing Bitcoin re-price as a result."
"5026750","5031990"," But one thing I'll say that's been really nice to see is if you strip out GBTC, which had some"
"5031990","5038810"," artificial selling from the FTX estate exiting it, if you just look at the new 9 ETFs, investors"
"5038810","5045830"," added exposure when the price went from, you know, 50 to down to 39,000, and they've added exposure"
"5045830","5047270"," as it's gone up to 72."
"5047690","5052770"," And otherwise, they weren't panicked by the pullback and they haven't gotten over excited by the"
"5052770","5053030"," run. "
"5053270","5055810"," They're just steadily adding to Bitcoin exposure."
"5056010","5057810"," And that gives me confidence that they're here to stay."
"5058230","5060770"," I think most of them are long-term investors in the space. "
"5060770","5065430"," Okay, we're going to have a lot more coming up on how the Bitcoin ETFs are changing the investing"
"5065430","5066950"," landscape for ETFs."
"5067070","5069250"," That's ETF Edge coming up, 1.10 PM Eastern Time."
"5069350","5071770"," We'll also talk about a new wave of weight loss ETFs. "
"5072590","5073350"," You knew that was coming."
"5073830","5074730"," You knew that was happening."
"5075010","5076850"," ETF Edge.cmbc.com."
"5077110","5077830"," It's got back to you. "
"5077890","5078690"," Of course it is, Bob."
"5078930","5079190"," Thank you."
"5079390","5079990"," Look forward to that. "
"5080170","5080630"," Bob Pizani."
"5080790","5082470"," Up next, the setup on three stocks."
"5083190","5084110"," About to report earnings. "
"5084410","5085230"," Oracle is today."
"5085570","5086570"," We've got Adobe this week."
"5086570","5089050"," In the eight cases, general ownership across the board. "
"5089050","5089570"," We're back."
"5089910","5090650"," We're right after this."
"5283940","5287040"," That's a key earnings starting out to the bell today with Oracle. "
"5287500","5288840"," Jimmy, this is your stock."
"5289360","5289480"," Yeah."
"5290100","5291460"," They had a terrible quarter. "
"5291600","5293300"," Not a bad quarter, last quarter."
"5293480","5297760"," And it came down to the data centers that they're building to fuel future growth and what that"
"5297760","5299840"," impact on margins will be going forward."
"5300200","5303000"," So obviously, we want an update on that in this quarter. "
"5303000","5308020"," But I think we've got to recognize that these data centers are the long-term growth story for the"
"5308020","5308340"," company."
"5308500","5312920"," So I'm not sure I'm going to get too twitchy if they tell us that they're building these things out"
"5312920","5315640"," quicker than expected and maybe that's more expensive than expected."
"5316000","5319820"," I think at this valuation, given what they're trying to do, this is a good hold here. "
"5320180","5322340"," Adobe's going to be important this week, isn't it, Joe?"
"5322620","5324020"," That's Thursday after the bell."
"5324220","5327020"," It does get a call today reiterated a buy over at Jeffries."
"5327840","5332400"," They say buy the AI scare, maintain the price target at 700 bucks. "
"5332400","5338160"," The general feeling and perceptions that Adobe's not doing enough and communicating what their AI"
"5338160","5339260"," strategy is."
"5339660","5341500"," Scott, that's reflected in the price performance."
"5342220","5346240"," Basically, this stock is in the same place it was last July. "
"5346620","5347960"," Down six and a half percent year to date."
"5348560","5353360"," And relative to its software peers, it's really underperforming whether it's Salesforce or"
"5353360","5353980"," ServiceNow."
"5353980","5357420"," So this is a critically important earnings report. "
"5358160","5363180"," And one could argue that the earnings conference called thereafter is going to be even more"
"5363180","5363460"," important."
"5363920","5370160"," They have to jumpstart the momentum with some fundamental understanding of what the AI strategy is."
"5370260","5371940"," All right, Tim, you got another one today after the bell. "
"5372080","5372840"," Casey's general story."
"5373000","5373860"," You just bought it last week."
"5373980","5374900"," Just bought it last week. "
"5375020","5378880"," I mean, I'm not likely to change my long-term outlook on this stock no matter what they report."
"5379320","5380780"," There shouldn't be any surprises here."
"5380780","5384400"," We're talking about a gas and convenience chain located in the Midwest. "
"5385100","5388100"," It'll give an insight into how the health of the consumer is doing."
"5388260","5389420"," That will be helpful for all of us."
"5389860","5391360"," But again, very new stock for me. "
"5391440","5393860"," I'm not expecting fireworks up or down after this report."
"5394060","5394620"," Okay, quick break."
"5394840","5397460"," We're back, Santoli, on the other side with his midday word. "
"5401040","5407100"," At the age of 16, my career ambition, career goal, was to be a commissioner of a professional"
"5407100","5407740"," sports league."
"5407740","5411120"," So, I feel really proud that I was able to achieve that."
"5411580","5418500"," Our league is at this extremely pivotal and transformative moment where the world is recognizing"
"5418500","5420140"," the value of women. "
"5420640","5426960"," And I'm just really humbled and appreciative of the opportunity to be able to shine a light on our"
"5426960","5430540"," league and everything that we've achieved to date and what's to come."
"5629920","5631660"," We're back for the senior markets commentator."
"5632600","5634300"," Mike Santoli, of course, mid-day word. "
"5634440","5637260"," So, I think we're obviously waiting for CPI tomorrow."
"5638080","5643280"," But, you know, interesting moves in the market, this momentum reversal into some of the laggards."
"5643640","5647680"," I'm sure you think it's too soon to declare a full trend change. "
"5648400","5650440"," But tell us how you're thinking about the markets today."
"5650700","5651240"," Yeah, for sure."
"5651240","5656040"," It doesn't look like a whole lot except for the sharpness of the decline from Friday's highs in"
"5656040","5656860"," most of these metrics. "
"5657440","5661540"," It hasn't, you know, done much to undo the build-up of our performance."
"5661740","5667740"," But I do think it's relevant that you're able to see the markets so far more or less handle this."
"5667940","5670520"," And, you know, the S&P 500 is back to a level. "
"5670540","5672480"," It was that a couple of weeks ago for the first time."
"5672680","5678860"," So, you have these repeated excuses for the market that maybe slow down, cool off, flatten out, and"
"5678860","5680060"," it hasn't really caused damage."
"5680060","5684320"," So, the big concern for me is not that, oh, no, the leadership has broken stride. "
"5685060","5689680"," It is, does that trigger some kind of other mechanical stress in the market?"
"5689840","5693020"," And then we're starting to talk about another quant quake or a volmageddon."
"5693380","5695460"," And we've seen no real signs of that right now."
"5695800","5696680"," And I think that's a good news. "
"5696820","5701560"," If we can just sort of digest it along the way, it's really micro over macro at this point."
"5702040","5705920"," You know, we're talking about the internal dynamics of this market because the macro is kind of"
"5705920","5706260"," common."
"5706260","5711960"," And it's really a lot of dispersion within the market as opposed to, you know, living and dying by"
"5711960","5712840"," every economic grid. "
"5713220","5714800"," Now, CPI, does it change that?"
"5715060","5717900"," Does it cause yields to kind of decisively break one way or the other?"
"5718140","5718740"," We'll have to see."
"5719380","5723840"," You know, it does help, obviously, when you, you know, if you're going to have some loss of"
"5723840","5729640"," momentum in some of those highest flying names, obviously it helps that Apple, Alphabet, and even a"
"5729640","5732360"," name like Tesla are picking up some of the slack."
"5732360","5738120"," That's why you haven't had some of the more dramatic role or whatever word you want to put to it. "
"5738260","5738660"," For sure."
"5738860","5744480"," And in a way, it seems tautological because if what you're seeing is, you know, the trade that was"
"5744480","5747860"," on is now all of a sudden cooling off and reversing partially."
"5748320","5752620"," Well, the trade that was on was, as you guys have been talking about, own NVIDIA and Meta against"
"5752620","5753960"," Alphabet and Apple. "
"5754240","5758180"," And so if you're unwinding it, both legs of it are going to go the other direction."
"5758460","5759720"," So for now, that's what it is."
"5759720","5761220"," And, you know, we'll see. "
"5761360","5763720"," We talked last week about how oversold Apple looked."
"5764520","5769420"," Some of the smarter analysts are timing upgrades to say, okay, enough already on the downside."
"5769760","5772900"," So we'll see if it has any legs beyond just this little mean reversion. "
"5773020","5776660"," We've also decided that last month's CPI was but a seasonal blip."
"5776860","5777000"," Yeah."
"5777420","5781280"," You know, tomorrow morning it'll be interesting to see if that's actually backed up or we need to"
"5781280","5782120"," actually rethink stuff. "
"5782340","5782840"," Yeah, for sure."
"5783020","5788480"," I mean, we did have a little brief bit of upset in the market after the January report."
"5789080","5794420"," We'll see if this, you know, enables anybody to make the case that a trend is changed, that it's"
"5794420","5797740"," not just a little bit of a bumpiness along the way down in inflation. "
"5798080","5798160"," Yeah."
"5798380","5798520"," All right."
"5798740","5799040"," Thank you. "
"5799200","5799840"," We'll see you on closing bell."
"5799940","5801340"," Mike Santoli, our senior markets commentator."
"5801760","5802340"," We'll step away. "
"5802620","5804580"," We'll come back on the other side with final trades."
"5809010","5811470"," Are you following the halftime report podcast?"
"5812230","5813110"," What are you waiting for?"
"5813790","5815670"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."
"5816190","5817890"," Follow the halftime podcast now. "
"5817890","5820930"," All right."
"5881320","5883680"," I'm going to stop back in here with a really quick and quick break."
"5883680","5885060"," Sorry, I was in a meeting there really quick. "
"5887140","5888040"," Get rid of that."
"5888640","5889740"," Oh, I got to open up the."
"5891480","5892940"," That bad boy back up there. "
"5893000","5893360"," There we go."
"5893420","5894220"," Loading the feeds up."
"5896160","5897960"," Just hop in really quick here. "
"5898120","5900160"," Well, CNBC takes their break."
"5900920","5902080"," This is kind of a."
"5903420","5906060"," Someone was asking, what was caps take today?"
"5906860","5908420"," They just shown up."
"5908820","5908840"," So. "
"5911080","5913580"," Oh, I meant wrong one."
"5913760","5914100"," There we go."
"5914760","5915280"," So. "
"5918200","5920340"," Last night on last night's market brief."
"5921460","5926020"," We had a target to the downside of bring that up."
"5928320","5932740"," So my expectation or at least like what was my expectations for today that we would go down and"
"5932740","5933020"," trade. "
"5934620","5935960"," 508 in some change."
"5937020","5938220"," We did that down here."
"5938340","5939660"," We got a low of 5050. "
"5940800","5942840"," So that target was achieved."
"5943940","5945980"," Now the big question comes in."
"5947200","5949800"," Do we break above this hourly trigger?"
"5950700","5952920"," So that would be the next question I'm assuming here, right?"
"5953220","5954280"," How high do we go here?"
"5955260","5956820"," There is a question. "
"5957980","5963920"," We also in that market brief had more volatility into tomorrow, the 12th."
"5965020","5967860"," We were showing you the ball surface heading into tomorrow."
"5967880","5968960"," The money aspects. "
"5969080","5972180"," There is a question here of 56 million dollars."
"5972440","5973540"," I'm going to meet this here."
"5973900","5976840"," One quick second. "
"5977920","5982140"," There is a question here of you get the squeeze and then we roll back down."
"5982140","5984340"," I have a weird."
"5985680","5989480"," Roll back down to close that gap down below. "
"5989760","5994400"," That's what a bull would want to close that gap and continue on to the upside."
"5996180","5998220"," So I don't know if we get that today."
"5998380","6001060"," We're going to find out really quick here in the half hour and hourly trigger. "
"6001420","6004540"," If we do get that rejection, I do recommend if you are a bull here."
"6004840","6008380"," You're watching that little bit of a inverse head and shoulders."
"6008560","6012160"," If we do go up here, you don't want to be in here because this is very volatile. "
"6012160","6014840"," They could slam this right back down on you and get blooded."
"6015500","6021140"," But you could get that nice squeeze up reversal back down and then that continuation of the upside."
"6021340","6023720"," That's when I would begin to get bullish again. "
"6024860","6025760"," Let me carry it back."
"6025920","6026420"," My kids are calm."
"6026620","6027520"," My kids schools call me. "
"6027560","6027740"," Hold on."
"6059490","6060430"," Sorry about the interruption."
"6060710","6063010"," I've got a daughter complaining of that. "
"6063170","6064850"," She's sick at school."
"6065110","6066010"," So just give me a few minutes."
"6066010","6070590"," I'm going to check with my wife and see who's doing the pickup. "
"6071530","6074190"," It's either myself or my wife and we're going to find out here in just a minute."
"6074310","6074810"," So give me a moment."
"6075050","6075630"," Be right back. "
"6076550","6078470"," Oh, so just to continue that conversation."
"6079330","6079870"," So right here."
"6080070","6080150"," Right. "
"6080970","6082130"," So where we are right now, right?"
"6084230","6087210"," What I really like to see here is that trade up here, right?"
"6087890","6089070"," Clear all this stuff out here."
"6089550","6090970"," Come back down and then we continue hard."
"6091110","6093130"," Do I think we're going to get that between now and tomorrow?"
"6093230","6093990"," Probably not. "
"6094310","6100430"," It's probably some kind of a pin for a small range in here awaiting that."
"6101950","6105070"," Volatility that we're expecting in tomorrow's prints in the morning."
"6105310","6108790"," So I'm not extremely bullish here, but I'm not bearish here either. "
"6110250","6113530"," But I'm waiting for that ball to roll off the market into tomorrow."
"6113930","6114490"," So we have that."
"6114730","6116790"," We have some on news coming out in the morning. "
"6117590","6118470"," Some inflation data."
"6118730","6121290"," So we also have a three year and a 10 year."
"6121670","6122410"," Is that right?"
"6122590","6122710"," No. "
"6123090","6123170"," Yeah."
"6123690","6124870"," Three year and 10 year, I believe tomorrow."
"6125430","6128190"," We're going to bond in a keynote auction tomorrow and Wednesday. "
"6128470","6129650"," Sorry, Tuesday and Wednesday."
"6138290","6138790"," That's right."
"6139030","6139170"," Yeah. "
"6139310","6143690"," If you guys, if you guys, I don't know, like some of you guys out there are, I can tell"
"6143690","6146290"," that some of you are getting the market briefs and some of you are not."
"6147350","6149470"," I know that some of you getting pro briefs out there."
"6149550","6150730"," So we've got like different levels. "
"6151350","6155870"," So I can see, I could, I could see why you don't already know we've hit our target down to"
"6155870","6156730"," the downside this morning."
"6156730","6158990"," We're now heading up into the hourly trigger this morning."
"6159790","6161090"," Let me see if I can see anything else. "
"6161250","6161810"," Give me one quick second."
"6161990","6162170"," I'll look."
"6162730","6164270"," And then I got to, I got to grab my wife. "
"6164510","6165290"," So hold on one second here."
"6168330","6170270"," Surely expecting results the three year."
"6170430","6170750"," No talk. "
"6170970","6172370"," I'll lead with a bit to cover ratio."
"6175650","6179740"," I mean, one quick second here."
"6203730","6206610"," Yeah, I mean, if it was me like. "
"6209230","6211010"," Let me check the 30 minute really quick."
"6216630","6220030"," Like the we were looking at this velocity earlier in the 30 minutes."
"6220030","6221490"," I don't like this either. "
"6221890","6222790"," I'll be honest."
"6222790","6224430"," Like I really like these."
"6224950","6227790"," I really like like these nice fat dips down here. "
"6228950","6234710"," It looks like we could get some more downside hourly, but watch this too."
"6235070","6237250"," What's that daily ramp there, right?"
"6238110","6239310"," So intraday, vol."
"6240250","6241610"," And then a ramp to the upside. "
"6243030","6246230"," So at least in the 30 minute basis, we're a 30 minute basis."
"6246450","6247150"," We're very bullish."
"6247930","6249070"," They're buying the market. "
"6249470","6253470"," I want to guarantee all that shit you just heard on CNBC about velocity."
"6254110","6254670"," Going down."
"6254910","6255370"," That's not true. "
"6255790","6257470"," Or at least it's not true."
"6257570","6258150"," It has to be 500."
"6259310","6261610"," So individual issues. "
"6262030","6265370"," Yeah, I can, or I can see that in individual issues, but here's another."
"6265370","6269750"," I was listening to that CNBC person talking earlier and."
"6271410","6272310"," Let me see. "
"6272410","6273110"," I moved this offset."
"6273490","6275470"," There's some fascinating what they were saying."
"6275930","6279030"," I was fascinated by it because they were saying. "
"6281410","6283130"," They were making the commentary."
"6283810","6287330"," You can see the momentum trade in Nvidia."
"6288470","6292190"," The momentum trade in Nvidia leaving, right?"
"6292530","6294110"," The momentum in Nvidia is leaving. "
"6294910","6296890"," Is that bad for those stocks?"
"6298790","6303290"," So you've got out performance by NVDA versus the rest of tech."
"6304150","6311570"," Now, if NVDA comes back into normal momentum and velocity alongside the rest of tech, that still"
"6311570","6314070"," means that it outperforms the rest of the stock market, right?"
"6315150","6318770"," So try to parse what they're saying to you there."
"6318770","6326890"," They're trying to tease you with, you know, if NVDA doesn't outperform the stock market, that means"
"6326890","6327790"," crash and queues. "
"6328170","6328630"," It doesn't."
"6329230","6329910"," It just means."
"6330490","6335430"," It just means that it's in more in line with the move in tech, right?"
"6336410","6344250"," So more broad base rally or a more broad base bull market doesn't necessarily mean Nvidia is going"
"6344250","6348250"," to go to the depths of hell, like start trading down on its own to the depths of hell, and"
"6348250","6349970"," yet the market's going to move higher. "
"6350110","6355210"," You'll likely see people later on go where they told me NVDA was done, and here it is still going"
"6355210","6355450"," up."
"6355610","6360530"," Maybe just not the momentum rate that was expected, okay?"
"6360630","6362670"," So try to parse what they're saying there."
"6363210","6372150"," They like to say things sometimes that are pushing their own or pushing some that sells, you know,"
"6372270","6372770"," some with sizzle. "
"6381680","6388840"," Yeah, that was my question about small caps was, you know, we always like to front run shit, right?"
"6389000","6395420"," They tried to front run small caps with the first rate expectation cut or cut gambling."
"6396400","6399420"," And again, you got to think about it this way."
"6399460","6403360"," If we don't get a rate cut, was it next week of the week after?"
"6403580","6406700"," So I think it's next week or it's after the 15th or something or something. "
"6407020","6410260"," We have a rate decision, but it's on the fucking note from last night."
"6410260","6415520"," But the point being would be this, if you don't get your rate cut, you know, it's all the doors"
"6415520","6417040"," are closing for a bear, right?"
"6417500","6419280"," You're like, all the doom and gloom shit."
"6419400","6421460"," It's like, well, what do you do after this rate decision?"
"6421960","6431360"," If you don't get a rate cut at this rate decision, you know, it's, I guess he's not back. "
"6431380","6434120"," We've said that before that he's backed into a corner and he hasn't been."
"6434400","6440200"," I don't know what kind of moves he could come up with, but I would anticipate, regardless if he"
"6440200","6445820"," does or does not cut rates in June, that that fucking trade will be on."
"6446560","6452560"," If you don't get a rate cut on this one, regardless of anything, you're going to see that trade"
"6452560","6453980"," material. "
"6454120","6459340"," So they will be pricing in a rate cut June whether they're going to pull you dragging and kicking"
"6459340","6461260"," and screaming to that expectation."
"6461860","6462340"," Does that make sense?"
"6463440","6465680"," Like even if we don't get a rate cut in June, right?"
"6465840","6466260"," It's my point."
"6466260","6467780"," It ain't going to matter. "
"6468000","6473140"," They're going to fucking front run that shit that there is going to be a rate cut in June because"
"6473140","6474100"," he's already stated."
"6474980","6476360"," He is set on public."
"6476720","6478540"," You know, expect a couple of rate cuts this year. "
"6478880","6482560"," They might not be back to back, but he's basically, they're basically saying that, right?"
"6482800","6483340"," Not just him."
"6483480","6486000"," There's other fed chairs that are saying that."
"6486160","6491700"," So you don't, it doesn't take rocket scientists of math to say, yeah, if we don't get one in March,"
"6491760","6494520"," you're likely going to see one in fucking June. "
"6494520","6496140"," It's likely a foregone conclusion."
"6504790","6505330"," So."
"6507930","6510150"," Yeah, I did list last night. "
"6510450","6511510"," All of the events."
"6511750","6513710"," I think I got all of his events that he listed."
"6513710","6515610"," I got a few others that he didn't list. "
"6516310","6519850"," And then I got regular stuff that everybody knows about."
"6520050","6526890"," So I did list, I did put like this date, this time, this event, and it's importance."
"6527930","6530570"," So we do have volatility coming, right?"
"6530770","6537090"," But does that necessarily translate to, I don't know, fucking 3500 by Friday?"
"6538090","6540870"," No, it just means range expansion. "
"6542690","6548230"," And, you know, I remember when we were talking about someone's going to get hurt, right?"
"6548470","6549350"," Someone's going to get hurt here."
"6549650","6551330"," We're either going to fall seasonality or we're not."
"6552010","6556230"," There was the second question of what happens. "
"6556230","6558290"," Do we have a really fast flash crash?"
"6558830","6560570"," I know that's a topic of discussion."
"6562230","6563330"," Everybody said it, right?"
"6563630","6568010"," You know, you're just going to wake up tomorrow and we're going to be down 200 points."
"6568770","6569870"," And you're going to get hurt. "
"6570170","6571890"," And I'm like, no, like these people aren't hurt."
"6572050","6574350"," They've been, they fucking made so much money on the way up here."
"6574850","6576270"," They're not getting fucking hurt. "
"6576470","6580190"," And there's a ton of fucking people waiting for that to happen."
"6580830","6583750"," Not because they want somebody to get hurt because they just want to jump in on it."
"6583750","6588410"," So you have like two different groups of people that, two groups of bulls, right?"
"6589250","6591890"," You got the bull that's been partying since Jan one. "
"6592870","6594050"," That's the fucking fact."
"6594090","6594990"," Can't say no."
"6595490","6601170"," And then you got another whole group of bulls that just want that flash crash of 200 points"
"6601170","6605050"," straight down or whatever because they just want to fucking buy a seasonal low. "
"6605690","6612250"," So there's no like, there's no sentiment, sentimental change here from bulls that I can see."
"6612810","6615310"," And you know what happens when you're in that situation?"
"6615910","6617990"," They fucking grind us straight up to the moon."
"6618650","6623270"," So you kind of need that sentiment change from bulls. "
"6623770","6627610"," You don't want like one group of bulls just riding this shit."
"6627790","6630070"," You don't want another group of bulls begging for a bull back."
"6630670","6634930"," You want bulls questioning is the run over. "
"6636030","6637650"," And we don't have that right now."
"6637850","6641290"," We don't have a full sentiment change in the market."
"6641290","6647370"," So we either need that sentiment change or, you know, and ball whiz was ball whiz came out with the"
"6647370","6647570"," whole. "
"6647750","6649150"," Remember, we're all discussing it, right?"
"6649210","6653430"," It's like me, trainer podcast and then ball whiz is like, Hey, there's option B too."
"6654190","6656350"," You know, or you get that range expansion sideways."
"6657530","6661150"," And but we're getting new highs and some nice lows as well. "
"6661150","6662550"," That's the broad base rally."
"6663870","6665670"," The late stage bull run."
"6665890","6668450"," So I don't know what the answer is which way we go. "
"6668810","6670610"," All I know what to do is to fall price."
"6671890","6673710"," So I don't know what else to say there."
"6674610","6675790"," So we'll see how that goes. "
"6676030","6680570"," You can see right now we're running into this first major resistance up here at the 30 minute"
"6680570","6680830"," trigger."
"6681350","6684990"," We're going to come back and back test the five minute trigger to see if we're going to continue up"
"6684990","6685970"," into the hourly trigger."
"6687250","6691650"," There is more volatility expected into tomorrow morning before the open. "
"6692570","6694010"," And then we're also have two more."
"6694010","6698230"," We've got a table auction and a bond auction and that should be it for the early part of the"
"6698230","6698430"," week."
"6698890","6703950"," If you look in the vault surface, it's rising across the board along with that volatility. "
"6704490","6711410"," The spike for this week finishes tomorrow morning at eight a.m. So if you're looking for a dip by,"
"6711410","6714470"," it's either on a successful back test of the hourly trigger."
"6715070","6718510"," Or you're looking for that gap to get closed down below on gamma."
"6719090","6720830"," That screen or down here pops up. "
"6721630","6722910"," I'll be right back within just a few minutes."
"6722970","6723850"," It's going to take my life really quick."
"6728190","6729550"," Here, I'll put a downside target. "
"6729750","6730790"," You all buried up out there."
"6731270","6732390"," You want me to get buried up with you?"
"6732650","6732950"," Hold on here."
"6733070","6733130"," Ready?"
"6734730","6736250"," Let me one quick second here. "
"6747670","6748850"," Into tomorrow morning."
"6749990","6751090"," I'll get all buried up with you."
"6751150","6751570"," Hold on here. "
"6753890","6754210"," 50660."
"6754430","6755170"," Do you see it right here?"
"6755870","6756510"," That's S3."
"6757690","6759090"," Here, I'll get all buried up with you. "
"6759090","6759990"," I got you covered."
"6760150","6760630"," Hold on here."
"6766290","6767010"," Oh, yeah. "
"6767350","6768270"," Into tomorrow morning."
"6768410","6768850"," How about that?"
"6775050","6776110"," Maybe that'll help."
"6776230","6778290"," Maybe that'll help put some cope out there for you. "
"6778330","6778690"," There you go."
"6779570","6783650"," This is the low that I would expect into tomorrow morning right here."
"6785170","6794510"," From now into, let's call it, the news that the morning economic news on Tuesday morning, that's"
"6794510","6795830"," the dip that I'll be looking to buy. "
"6797750","6798270"," In there."
"6799530","6800850"," Now I will say this."
"6802210","6806410"," If at any point there is a squeeze higher right here. "
"6807370","6809670"," Let me go over to this chart so you can just see it."
"6809970","6810170"," Hold on."
"6811790","6812810"," For your full screen. "
"6817720","6819860"," Let's make that nice and easy for you."
"6820000","6820540"," Right out there."
"6822660","6827020"," If I was, the dip that I'm looking for is likely down here. "
"6827100","6829480"," We closed that gap down below on the SPX."
"6830260","6833620"," Then we start to make our way higher into tomorrow morning."
"6833860","6835600"," Like K39, 30 something like that. "
"6836840","6838200"," Is that the 12th right here?"
"6838340","6839080"," Here's the 12th."
"6839820","6840720"," This wins the 12th."
"6841920","6843720"," It was March 11th. "
"6843840","6845020"," Where is March 12th?"
"6845220","6847660"," Tuesday 6 a.m. 9 a.m. Right over there somewhere."
"6848940","6850480"," You guys probably want to clean up a little bit."
"6850580","6850980"," So there you go. "
"6851660","6852340"," Right there."
"6852820","6853140"," Squeeze up."
"6853940","6855220"," Trade down into the clothes today. "
"6856180","6858720"," And then we get the actual dip by right down there."
"6859120","6860140"," Now I will say this though."
"6860880","6862360"," If we get the squeeze up, right?"
"6862980","6867780"," If we get the squeeze up and we successfully grind on this hourly trigger, right?"
"6868000","6870200"," You tag this bad boy back here with the new high. "
"6871660","6872100"," Right?"
"6872400","6874520"," And we start ramping up here in that hourly trigger."
"6875380","6879380"," I am going to be wanting to be a buyer for all that right there because we're going to get,"
"6879560","6880520"," we're going to cross them."
"6880780","6882920"," I think there's one more dip coming down here tomorrow. "
"6883740","6885160"," And that's the actual dip by."
"6887140","6887580"," Okay."
"6887840","6890540"," So for right here, is this clear enough for this day for you?"
"6891260","6891960"," I hope that it is. "
"6893380","6895040"," That looks like a crayon drawing."
"6895040","6903560"," And you will also get another market brief for tomorrow at the end of today at the tonight, if"
"6903560","6905320"," there's anything that's changed or anything like that."
"6906340","6907600"," So I think that helps, right?"
"6907780","6908140"," Does that help?"
"6909080","6909480"," Right there. "
"6916620","6916980"," Yeah."
"6917240","6918160"," You know, you guys can do."
"6918320","6920160"," If you guys don't want, I'll be honest with you guys. "
"6920400","6922120"," If you guys are like, I ain't paying nothing."
"6923380","6927280"," Dude, like that $30 subscriber level is like beautiful."
"6928760","6929580"," That's all you need. "
"6930640","6932500"," You can even just pay for the market briefs."
"6932700","6933880"," I think those, I don't know what they cost."
"6934140","6936780"," But I think we, you can even just get the market briefs. "
"6937740","6941420"," And those are all before you guys get that shit the day before that should even happens."
"6941940","6942820"," And they're pretty accurate."
"6943020","6948140"," I think if you go back and look at them, they're like about 70% accurate or higher. "
"6948800","6954280"," I probably gave you like maybe 80% accurate in what to expect the next day."
"6955980","6959560"," So now what I do on stream here is different than what I tell you guys."
"6961100","6963740"," Because I like to gamble alongside. "
"6964380","6968920"," This is where we're going for like 20 cent calls and shit like that."
"6968980","6970380"," But you guys don't follow all my trades."
"6970480","6972380"," You guys follow some of my trades. "
"6972740","6976720"," Some of you guys only follow the gambling trades, which you shouldn't be following any of them"
"6976720","6976940"," anyways."
"6977980","6982100"," You guys should be following what I put out for you in a market brief."
"6982580","6983420"," They're pretty good. "
"6983600","6984580"," I've been watching them."
"6984800","6985780"," They're pretty fucking good."
"6986240","6987800"," So here you go. "
"6988680","6990500"," Here's the expectations into tomorrow."
"6991500","6992760"," Let's see how this works out."
"6996230","6997130"," Oh fuck yeah. "
"6997270","6998530"," Pro is worth every fucking penny."
"6998810","6999390"," Pro is even better."
"6999950","7003530"," Pro is like, pro is like, here's everything to when we're done. "
"7004750","7007670"," And then if this breaks, we know that that's not going to happen."
"7009750","7012010"," That's super fucking, the pro is fucking baller."
"7012150","7017610"," So can I go over specific tickers for you and pro and all that stuff?"
"7017610","7018790"," We look at oil. "
"7019070","7023030"," We look at right now with Tesla and Nvidia and stuff like that."
"7023190","7028690"," So if you guys ever want me to switch that up to don't hesitate to be like, Hey, we're going"
"7028690","7029810"," to move on to this different ticker now."
"7035910","7036270"," Celebrate. "
"7041310","7043050"," So yeah, just this right here."
"7043150","7043790"," Just watch this."
"7043790","7048710"," You figure by tomorrow morning, there's still some, there's still some volatility. "
"7049110","7052990"," There's like, I think I, I think I succinctly said it too."
"7053790","7058230"," If you're a trader, get a bull or bear, get off a one minute chart, get on to like a"
"7058230","7062550"," 15 minute chart, get on a 30 minute chart while we encounter volatility."
"7063170","7067250"," I think that's a wiser path for you as a trader. "
"7067510","7072070"," You're just looking for like, for like these points of sell and these major points of buy."
"7072070","7077170"," And you're going to buy and sell those major points until they fail with stops below or above them."
"7077790","7082950"," I think that's the most simplest way to put it for everybody that's out there from now into end of"
"7082950","7083270"," quarter. "
"7083630","7087050"," And there will be probably two moments of a pinning action."
"7087850","7090790"," Parking the bus into both of those moments."
"7091810","7097490"," You're likely not going to see shit screaming down into like Friday or the. "
"7098750","7099510"," Twenty eight."
"7099850","7101410"," I think that's another Friday for this month."
"7102690","7104510"," You will see the high volatility. "
"7105010","7106690"," You'll have to see one day big bloodbath."
"7106970","7108690"," You're going to see one day big day all the way up."
"7109070","7110490"," And you what you should be doing right now. "
"7110530","7112410"," I swear to you, you're a trader investor."
"7112730","7113250"," Listen to me closely."
"7114910","7120830"," Scale out a little bit and look for those like really big lows and those really big highs. "
"7121610","7123990"," And if you see any of those into the."
"7124930","7126210"," At least into the first."
"7127250","7129250"," That's a time for you to attack. "
"7129550","7131850"," And either take along or take a short."
"7132670","7132750"," Okay."
"7133270","7134550"," So just range expansion. "
"7135010","7135870"," Real simple stuff."
"7140400","7141880"," All right, I'll be back with you guys in a minute."
"7141940","7142640"," I got to take care of this. "
"7142760","7144420"," My daughter is complaining of being sick at school."
"7184740","7185780"," All right."
"7186160","7190380"," The average FICO credit score dropped for the first time in a decade last week. "
"7190640","7191880"," Now, don't make too much of it."
"7191880","7194700"," It was only one point from 718 to 717."
"7195080","7198440"," But it comes as credit card debt now tops $1 trillion. "
"7199120","7202940"," And if you pay late, you know you get whacked with some big fees."
"7203200","7204580"," But likely not anymore."
"7204580","7211000"," The CFPB is cracking down on late fees to a maximum of eight bucks from an average of $32 right"
"7211000","7211320"," now. "
"7211780","7215060"," Joining us now is the director of the consumer financial protection bureau."
"7215760","7217740"," Rohit Shapra Commissioner."
"7218020","7218720"," Thanks for joining us. "
"7219100","7219620"," Is this."
"7220020","7221720"," There's some lawsuits against it."
"7221820","7222480"," Chamber of Commerce. "
"7222480","7223380"," I think bankers association."
"7223960","7224820"," I can understand the latter."
"7224980","7225940"," Maybe not as much the former. "
"7226720","7228600"," Is this the law now?"
"7228920","7229480"," Is this happening?"
"7229500","7230060"," Will it happen?"
"7231040","7239400"," Well, what we found was that big credit card issuers were exploiting a loophole for years and"
"7239400","7239740"," years."
"7240320","7248980"," And it allowed them to haul in $14 billion in late fees on top of the extra interest they charge"
"7248980","7250500"," on late payments."
"7251020","7256620"," And in addition to slamming people's credit reports and imposing other consequences. "
"7256620","7264340"," So what we've done is we have narrowed that exemption to make it a little bit more fair for"
"7264340","7266140"," consumers and the entire market."
"7266540","7266840"," Look, you're right."
"7267260","7269400"," People owe about a trillion dollars. "
"7269700","7273200"," They know they got to pay that and they got to pay it with interest."
"7273820","7279480"," What we don't want is credit card companies creating a business model where they're cheering when"
"7279480","7280880"," their consumers are paying late."
"7280880","7287720"," So is this enacted now or is it still something that's being proposed and may not occur?"
"7287920","7289280"," Or is this now how it's going to be?"
"7289880","7291780"," So we've finalized the rule. "
"7291980","7295040"," It will take take effect in a few months."
"7295400","7299580"," But as you mentioned, lobbyists are suing to stop it."
"7299680","7307200"," And look, that's no surprise we have seen how companies that rely on junk fees are pushing back"
"7307200","7307500"," hard. "
"7307500","7311460"," But we've got to do our job to make sure that consumers are fairly treated."
"7312260","7317760"," And then there was, we had hinted about closing costs on homes."
"7318140","7321200"," If you could write it up, and you probably, you can. "
"7321380","7322020"," I mean, you are the commissioner."
"7322340","7324000"," You got a team behind you and you got to get it approved."
"7325000","7327860"," What do you want to do around home closing costs?"
"7328880","7334740"," Well, here's what we're finding across the country is that people are needing to come up with big"
"7334740","7335580"," down payments. "
"7335580","7336000"," All right."
"7336340","7341180"," But we've noticed in our analysis quite a jump in closing costs."
"7345580","7346720"," There we go. "
"7347840","7349200"," That up right there."
"7349740","7353220"," So my wife is going to pick up my daughter, which is awesome."
"7356680","7358340"," And so stay here with you guys. "
"7358720","7359600"," I have to go and pick her up."
"7364360","7366140"," I shouldn't say that, but."
"7370560","7371400"," There we go. "
"7371880","7376500"," I did get to go to this weekend, my daughter, my youngest daughter."
"7377460","7380280"," So it's kind of, if any of you have kids out there."
"7381520","7382760"," I went to. "
"7392480","7395360"," My, say you want to hear a funny story about family."
"7396660","7397240"," I."
"7405700","7407300"," This weekend, I'm."
"7407300","7412240"," I get a chance to break away this weekend. "
"7413120","7415900"," And my daughter, my youngest daughter says to me, she goes, Daddy."
"7417180","7419060"," She goes, we're going to a luau."
"7419540","7421020"," And I go where she's like at school. "
"7421500","7422100"," I was like, no way."
"7422140","7422960"," She's like, do you want to come?"
"7423200","7423940"," Like, yeah, I do."
"7424920","7427520"," So I go with, I go with her to the luau. "
"7429840","7431700"," And I get inside the luau, right?"
"7432160","7433960"," Well, let me make this bigger for you guys so you can see it."
"7434760","7435980"," Let's see it right here."
"7440230","7443110"," So I go to the luau and. "
"7444230","7445610"," I'm hanging out with my daughter."
"7445830","7449790"," It's like her and I hanging out one on one time dedicated the whole thing, right?"
"7450910","7456270"," And my daughter's best friend was at the school with her mom."
"7456510","7457990"," These are like best friend kids, right?"
"7458930","7464070"," So I'm talking to my daughter's best friend's mom. "
"7464850","7466350"," And she says to me, she goes."
"7467590","7471590"," She goes Maggie says that you have no time for her."
"7472270","7473850"," I'm like, I'm right here right now. "
"7475510","7477230"," And I go over here right now."
"7477410","7481650"," I go as a matter of fact, on that topic of her saying that, I should probably go and make"
"7481650","7483930"," sure that I'm with like right next to her, right?"
"7484770","7487210"," And I've been like right next to her earlier until the mom came."
"7487430","7488590"," So I go and hang out with my daughter. "
"7489590","7490590"," Like just her and I, right?"
"7491150","7494630"," And I'm dancing and we're in the dance thing doing the dancing and all that stuff."
"7495150","7498230"," And she's like, she's like, I have to go find a couple of my friends."
"7498730","7500950"," The U.S. State Department says the U.S. must improve. "
"7501910","7505110"," That's our disposal to out compete China, wherever possible."
"7507110","7508670"," Because she has to go see my friends."
"7508810","7511010"," I'm like, well, you want Daddy to come help find your friends with this?"
"7511170","7512870"," She's like, I don't know, Daddy. "
"7513750","7515610"," I'm like, come on, let Daddy come find your friends with you."
"7515710","7517010"," She's like, okay, Daddy."
"7517830","7522210"," We make a lap or two around the gymnasium dance that's going on. "
"7522530","7526030"," And then I just make sure I stay behind her while she's doing her thing."
"7527910","7530190"," And since she goes dead, I gotta go to the bathroom."
"7530770","7531270"," I go, all right, sweet. "
"7531410","7531890"," I'll come with you."
"7532410","7535670"," So we go down the hallways and I wait outside the bathroom door."
"7536770","7537770"," And she's just in there. "
"7538790","7539890"," Like she's like, she's not a kid."
"7540210","7542010"," She's not a child and she's not a pre-team."
"7542530","7546230"," So like they, she really smells bad, puts on too many, too much nail polish. "
"7546510","7549270"," And those are all like the things that kids at that age do."
"7549830","7556650"," And I'm sitting outside and not trying to look like a pervert or a weirder or anything like that."
"7556650","7559910"," So I'm like, you know, looking off to the left and I'm looking off to the right and all that"
"7559910","7560410"," kind of stuff. "
"7561230","7564810"," And trying to like stand away from the door of the bathroom and all that stuff."
"7565410","7568510"," Well, she had left the bathroom and left me behind and took off."
"7570230","7573570"," So I'm just sitting outside the bathroom and like one of the teachers. "
"7574490","7578810"," Was they were all like looking at each other and they looked at me and they're like, excuse me,"
"7578810","7581970"," sir, if you would like, we can find a bathroom for you to use."
"7582610","7584230"," And I'm like, oh shit, here we go."
"7584650","7586790"," I go, oh, I think my daughter is in this bathroom. "
"7587230","7588490"," And so I'm just waiting for her."
"7589770","7594250"," And at that moment, a woman had walked out of the bathroom and I said, could you go back in"
"7594250","7596450"," there and ask for my daughter?"
"7596450","7597530"," And she did."
"7597950","7599490"," And she's like, nobody's in there, man. "
"7600570","7603450"," So all this is going on when the teachers are watching me and they're laughing."
"7603630","7604610"," Now they're laughing at me."
"7605010","7609470"," So I take off back to find my daughter and I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I thought you were"
"7609470","7611470"," telling people that I don't like being near you. "
"7611710","7613030"," I don't have any time for you."
"7613310","7615130"," I was like, you're trying to lose me anywhere you can."
"7615810","7620130"," And this, this kind of like, I can't win. "
"7620950","7625110"," She's almost at that age where I'm going to lose her to my last youngest daughter."
"7625110","7626350"," Like, I'm going to lose her."
"7627310","7631290"," And, you know, I can't do anything right. "
"7631490","7632430"," Does it dad right now?"
"7632710","7634570"," Like, I'm, or I'm starting to get to that point."
"7635250","7637050"," We're like, my daddy doesn't have time for me."
"7637090","7637650"," He doesn't love me. "
"7638230","7644090"," Another thing that I noticed too was she's that she's getting that age where she doesn't"
"7644090","7646930"," necessarily want me doing things with her."
"7647670","7650570"," She wants me to observe her doing things."
"7651230","7652570"," So I got to pay attention. "
"7652570","7655210"," I think maybe that bathroom thing was a lesson in that."
"7657150","7658350"," I want you there."
"7659810","7662090"," But I don't care what you think and what you know. "
"7662730","7663910"," I know more than you."
"7664310","7669410"," And I just want you to stand over there and be focused on whatever it is I'm doing."
"7669930","7675190"," So I think I have to switch to that maybe like where it's more, a little more standoffish and a"
"7675190","7676930"," little bit more observational. "
"7678330","7682750"," I don't know if I'm wrong on this or not, but those are the, that's what I'm being telegraphed."
"7690530","7692010"," It could be your daddy."
"7692810","7694130"," I don't know what they want. "
"7694470","7698250"," Like they go through, like, like kids go through all these phases."
"7699070","7700990"," Like all it's, it's constantly changing."
"7701230","7703530"," It's like scratch my back. "
"7703950","7704490"," Don't touch me."
"7705950","7707450"," Daddy, you like, do this."
"7707830","7708330"," Daddy, do that. "
"7708770","7709490"," Daddy don't like that anymore."
"7709810","7710690"," Daddy like this now."
"7711110","7712710"," And they don't always tell you all this either. "
"7712710","7716170"," You have to like read between the lines of this stuff."
"7717050","7718810"," Like find out what they really want."
"7720470","7721350"," All right. "
"7721490","7722630"," You guys like that with your parents?"
"7725050","7726190"," Let me see what you're saying."
"7728510","7730530"," Do we have to be so close to the school?"
"7732650","7734790"," Oh, you have drop off and pick up, Addy."
"7736550","7737710"," Of the Burke pressure. "
"7744450","7744810"," Yeah."
"7747570","7748390"," I know what to do."
"7748630","7749470"," I'm a dad, dude. "
"7749650","7750110"," Someone asked me."
"7750150","7750750"," They're like, are you rich?"
"7750910","7752370"," I'm like, I've got two Ferraris."
"7752490","7752910"," You want to know?"
"7753470","7758750"," I have a Ferrari that is 10 years old and I have a Ferrari that's 16 years old. "
"7761830","7766170"," I don't have like real Ferraris and jet planes and all that stuff."
"7766170","7772310"," I have like really expensive kids that take up all of my time."
"7774370","7775930"," Like kids are like that. "
"7776270","7777090"," They're great."
"7777510","7778710"," I don't dislike kids anyway."
"7778930","7781330"," Shiver for him, but that's how you want thing. "
"7782070","7783590"," There's something else I noticed."
"7783910","7786690"," So I go to the, I go to this luau dance, right?"
"7789310","7795370"," And it's like, it's like my wife and I dancing and maybe one other couple."
"7796350","7797650"," Maybe one of the couple participating. "
"7798390","7800910"," There were a couple dads though that eventually were like moving."
"7801210","7802170"," They're like, yeah, we can move this."
"7802630","7803710"," See those, they're dancing over there. "
"7803770","7804210"," We can do this."
"7804670","7806530"," We're like the parents that are like, we're going to dance."
"7806870","7808250"," We're going to do like a dance in a circle. "
"7808430","7809170"," We'll get all the kids together."
"7809170","7809890"," All that kind of stuff."
"7815350","7816710"," We're involved with our kids. "
"7817210","7821430"," Like, I think that's a part of being a parent's like, can you do that?"
"7821990","7823630"," Like there's times in my life when I couldn't."
"7827090","7832670"," And not everybody has that opportunity, though, either to be like, hey, we have this to do it or"
"7832670","7840630"," that to do it or whatever, but if you ever have the opportunity to be able to raise children and"
"7840630","7842990"," enjoy it, it's fucking awesome."
"7843230","7843870"," Very nothing like it. "
"7844930","7845650"," It's awesome."
"7846390","7847490"," They're a mini you."
"7852350","7853290"," They're a mini you. "
"7853550","7860320"," So I don't know how else to describe that."
"7866360","7867580"," Chances are nobody's watching."
"7867760","7873080"," Well, my thought about that too, when I was dancing was, I was like, man, I was like, there's so"
"7873080","7877180"," many parents here and they're all just like, I was like, you guys aren't. "
"7878120","7885780"," I don't know."
"7886440","7891960"," It was always like, not so much helicopter parenting, just you did things with your kids."
"7892860","7896100"," Like you go skiing, you go skiing with your kids, you go hiking, you go hiking with your kids, you"
"7896100","7899320"," go surfing, you bring your kids, you go surfing with them. "
"7900920","7905380"," I moved here to Michigan and that's not as, I don't see that's more prevalent."
"7906220","7910280"," I see a lot of like, I'm going to bring my kids here and I'm going to go sit over"
"7910280","7913840"," there in the corner and let them do whatever they're going to do and I'm getting involved in it."
"7914580","7916960"," I see it's not, it's not, it's glaring. "
"7917520","7918240"," I should say it's glaring."
"7918720","7919280"," It's more glaring."
"7919680","7925740"," Like if you live in like Colorado or something, like those parents are all like, my kids this, my"
"7925740","7928180"," kids that, and I do all this stuff with my kid. "
"7929600","7932220"," You know, like, I don't know, that's where I'm from."
"7932420","7937240"," So like, that's, then that's my experience has been like, spend time with your kids, right?"
"7937240","7943300"," You learn about radios, learn about transistors, you learn about, I don't know, oceanography, what"
"7943300","7946020"," makes the ocean wave wave, you learn all that stuff with your children."
"7946160","7947040"," You're like, let's do it together. "
"7948900","7952220"," And I don't know, I don't know what that means."
"7952680","7954060"," I don't know what that necessarily means."
"7954280","7959880"," It's going to be successful in life or good kids do not have major issues, but I think it's"
"7959880","7963480"," important to spend that time with your children. "
"7965120","7967520"," Those are some of my fond, my dad wasn't like that."
"7968280","7972480"," And it was some of the most fond moments I had as a kid was my dad spent that time"
"7972480","7972860"," with me."
"7973640","7975700"," They were the most fond moments of my childhood. "
"7979550","7984010"," But that was like a, he was there for me, but he was, you know, strictest, butarian."
"7984510","7985410"," He was the provider."
"7985730","7986350"," He was never home. "
"7987790","7989490"," And that was his whole thing, right?"
"7989490","7992090"," And be the dad."
"7992470","7994810"," Well, not emotional, that kind of stuff."
"7995470","7999870"," You're like, you, you have to do this and do that and provide this and be that. "
"8000210","8005330"," If you feel anywhere around the line, you got to, you know, accept it and, you know, stab yourself"
"8005330","8005910"," in the heart."
"8007550","8008310"," All that stuff."
"8008310","8013150"," According to Politico, Bosnia, it's our membership talks and the commission will announce. "
"8014150","8016170"," The announcement is expected on Tuesday."
"8018610","8020190"," So we got this rolled out, man."

"8656640","8662560"," tick-tock and a potential ban I see a lot of shit being thrown around and it seems like it's"
"8662560","8672200"," all based based in not quite bullshit but just a lot of conjecture it seems you guys have a take"
"8672200","8678720"," I have the I of course I think tick-tock rots people's brains out I also don't like it from"
"8678720","8688620"," the perspective of a main street hat for the security of the United States I would like to see it"
"8690500","8700520"," forked off into a different entity with the control at the hands of some sort of you"
"8700520","8708080"," know like a US interest of some kind that's either paying some kind of breakwater breakwall so if"
"8708080","8711200"," you have that's not really what I'm wondering I'm wondering do you think that the ban actually"
"8711200","8719490"," comes in do you think that there's a deal done do you think that's actually we've had that talk"
"8719490","8729440"," before right this is you guys are saying in that topic they just need to sell it off yeah I'm"
"8729440","8738300"," agree I'm with you too H bomb well I have a I have an ethical complaint against all of this"
"8738300","8743080"," but I feel like if when I was a kid the same thing was said about where we are today"
"8743080","8749590"," I don't think we stopped that from happening like I think it's horrible I think I think tick-tocks"
"8749590","8758450"," horrible but do I think I'll stop it no I've seen other things happen over my lifetime that have"
"8758450","8765970"," also proven that to be the case like you know we need to stop this it's gonna do this it's"
"8765970","8772930"," gonna do that yeah that happened but they continue doing it so I don't know that we're ever gonna"
"8772930","8782790"," stop the tick-tock effect or that it won't pop up somewhere else or that it's not in"
"8782790","8791770"," the in other US companies interest to do the same thing so I don't know if we're my point there"
"8791770","8798110"," my only point there would be with the only point there with the main street hat on would be I"
"8798110","8806870"," doubt that we stop this until it does significant fucking damage that significant damage basically"
"8806870","8815090"," maybe a generation or two possibly of having some experience but dude I gotta tell you guys some"
"8815090","8820410"," there was like a there was like an internet renaissance period where people were protective of"
"8820410","8826950"," their privacy then we went through this whole internet where now everybody wants to be like fuck it"

"8876420","8886260"," the I'm on the well they did so China did do some shit recently that was like really bad but"
"8886260","8892760"," honestly from my perspective they are an adversary of the United States like it or not and Russia"
"8892760","8901460"," is an adversary of the United States like it or not there's no way around that I don't think I"
"8901460","8910040"," hope that there is one day I would really like to see like Russia reform even if they're fail-out"
"8910040","8916280"," at a lot I wish there would be more of that for Russia I wouldn't expect overnight change but I'd"
"8916280","8922040"," really like to see them join some a man no it's this is evil to say like a world homogenous"
"8922040","8929560"," my hegemony some kind of world hegemony we are getting bigger the world is getting this becoming a"
"8929560","8935860"," smaller place and no I don't want to live and then maybe they don't either maybe it's because"
"8935860","8940160"," they're from a different culture that they don't want to live like that I understand and respect"
"8940160","8945280"," that too they don't have to but if they don't you got to know and accept that they are not"
"8945280","8950680"," right if they don't actually have to join a world hegemony hegemony if they don't that's fine but"
"8950680","8956380"," if they don't you still have to understand that that is the case does that make sense so it's like"
"8956380","8960760"," it's not like add do I care if they do yeah I care if they do if they don't just"
"8960760","8967800"," to be aware of it now that they want to be a power and that it's not the Western or"

"10852240","10859540"," at it on a let's go on an hour basis and this looks beautiful too believe it or not and"
"10859540","10867080"," we're going to look at it on a daily basis and let's see what's going on here on a daily"
"10867080","10876980"," basis uh from a weekly perspective we're likely not going down on sisco okay so on a weekly basis"
"10876980","10884760"," what i really like about this is when you get weekly lows in a daily basis it signifies time to"
"10884760","10893100"," buy sisco right you can see that right nice beautiful run in sisco nice beautiful run in sisco"
"10893100","10902260"," question becomes are we already at a nice beautiful run in sisco uh it looks to me i mean watching"
"10902260","10909300"," everything marching up here looks right now like there could be more downside to come at least on a"
"10909300","10918980"," daily basis but it looks very constructive right now as well and let's look right here on what"
"10918980","10924440"," happens on the monthly trigger even when we blast down it gets bought right you can see it right"
"10924440","10930780"," back here in november you can see it right back down here right on the monthly trigger watch that"
"10930780","10936980"," blue line okay that's the monthly trigger and it looks pretty good right we we just had that happen"
"10936980","10945900"," here right now we do have some volatility coming up this week and even the daily velocity"
"10945900","10954160"," or not the daily the weekly velocity is making that known it's saying we probably haven't seen the"
"10954160","10963500"," down move yet on sisco but the way is up we are holding the monthly trigger we are now above"
"10963500","10973380"," the daily trigger and we're coming into be looking for much more are a lot"
"10973380","10979460"," more highs to come so you have something like this down here right and hopefully we continue higher"
"10979460","10987800"," right guess i should put it like that maybe make it look prettier we have some new highs to come"
"10987800","10995760"," right all of this there'd be one word of warning here and that's that weekly velocity and so i know"
"10995760","11002980"," we're up here right now but i would say to you that on a weekly basis i'm going to expect"
"11002980","11009980"," volatility here so would not shock me to see us get rolled down right get rolled back up here and"
"11009980","11015740"," then violently come back down until this turn actually takes place i want you to see that really"
"11015740","11025740"," quick too so i want you to see the daily trigger right here has not yet crossed the weekly"
"11025740","11035740"," so i would really like to see this cross down below right and i would really"
"11035740","11042660"," like to see this monthly come up right here right so this is the end of uh march right april"
"11042660","11048960"," costs for families may something like this right we're seeing comments from bank of england's man"
"11048960","11053300"," says we have a long way to go for inflation pressures to be consistent with the two percent well"
"11053300","11063140"," hello kitty so the hi kitty so the idea being here that expect some volatility even if this happens"
"11063720","11069840"," um but this is looking good like the structure is good my only fear here though is where are the"
"11069840","11075380"," lows to buy where are they to buy the entire way up special offer or financial use pro for years"
"11076000","11083500"," so yes i would say to you i am bullish on sisco and i would be looking for places known"
"11083500","11091100"," places to buy along the way up you can see where the buyers are stepping in right you can kind"
"11091100","11098600"," of see that over there now you can even see something more like this down here and be looking"
"11098600","11107820"," for some failures how kitty"
"11107820","11116120"," hi kitty so yeah the structure looks great it looks like we're going to continue to go higher the"
"11116120","11120640"," only thing that i would say to you would be if at any point there's a rejection of the monthly"
"11120640","11131670"," trigger something like that and you get a new low oh sorry i'm trying to make this simple that"
"11131670","11140880"," trade is over so if you see any of this right here uh the trade is over normally when we"
"11140880","11147040"," see structure like this you can see that there's a lot of volatility and you can actually see the"
"11147040","11151900"," volatility here the last time we tried to crack big a cross on that daily trigger right what"
"11151900","11158440"," happened blasted it up and they violently went to the downside so it that would not shock me until"
"11158440","11165740"," that we get that cross in the confirmation trade to the confirmation trade and until you get that"
"11165740","11172000"," you know i'm going to expect this volatility in here as this attempts to move to the upside but"
"11172000","11177600"," right now structure is good i like it i like it for that upside move over time i am bullish"
"11177600","11184760"," as of right now on uh sisco the one the one note that i would make to you would be"
"11184760","11190660"," the one note that i would make to you if you're out there trading or bullish on sisco is they're"
"11190660","11198060"," likely still going to have big volatility downside moves you're likely not priced out of that"
"11198060","11204420"," happening so if you're not long sisco i would be saying to you yeah if you ever see it trade"
"11204420","11213100"," in uh 4884 maybe even a bloodbath down to 4780 or something like that you might get another chance"
"11213100","11225010"," to jump in that trade and bullish on sisco good one good one to throw up time"
"11225010","11232770"," to pull out the vodka i just saw jimmy say time to pull out the vodka some of the chats"
"11232770","11240510"," not showing just yet we see what what switch is saying right now if they're all fired up over there"
"11240510","11250230"," now we've got nvidia up down below and we also do an nvidia update on the pros and the pro"
"11250230","11260410"," uh pro trader so you can ask ask other pro traders what's what i'm telling you on that did"
"11260410","11265290"," i check live l y vv hold on one second we'll look at that one in the background right now"
"11265290","11274190"," live let me take a look at live and see what it's saying"
"11274190","11288310"," you mean live nation this"

"11324720","11334300"," not liking it over the long term not liking it"
"11336000","11345280"," ah it's got a little bit more room to go hmm little more upside but i'm not a fan of"
"11345280","11354620"," it's i think it gets sold up there i think they're gonna sell you on 105 106"
"11354620","11364560"," somewhere in there maybe 107 40 106 uh 107 65 i guess the question becomes"
"11364560","11374300"," uh maybe you're asking does it get back to 125 dollars hmm how about i'll say this on"
"11374300","11380220"," i'll say this on live if i had uh three different things to say and live over the long term"
"11380220","11388140"," i see it going up over the medium term uh i think you have more downside to come likely that"
"11388140","11396160"," sell off of um 106 40 and you're going to be grinding to get there as well to get back"
"11396160","11402340"," to all-time highs a lot of volatility to get there so i guess i'm bullish on live overall um"
"11402340","11413990"," are you just are you saying that you're in calls right now hold on here"
"11413990","11427660"," maybe trader podcast could enter the enter this david"

"11461200","11469880"," top here that the next dip buy is uh 92 92 possibly even 85 i'd be wanting to be a"
"11469880","11477820"," buyer here to actually take this one out so like uh you like you get a chance here but it's"
"11477820","11485420"," that this is the last 20 right is my point like this could just as easily uh just turn around"
"11485420","11491900"," and start the way down for a corrective corrective move in the market and the real trade was right"
"11491900","11500620"," there so uh and here it is right here right just on a daily basis and you know what the"
"11500620","11508100"," scariest part of this is that's scary so much but you have trapped buyers up here that are going to"

"11896130","11902330"," it pop up for for for report i'm like yeah next report it's popping down next part report it pops"
"11902330","11912210"," up again then it pops down it reminds me of uh in the moment that it gets away"
"11912210","11919470"," from them that's another thing the moment that it gets away from up or down uh watch out remember"
"11919470","11929030"," velocity and employment and jobs and inflation is never good ever never good"
"11929030","11938250"," never ever ever good so it would behoove the fed to have like a good report of bad or hot"
"11938250","11948010"," report of cold report hot report of cold report i think we're in like the full"
"11948010","11953850"," manipulation mode we're like we're like exiting we're not quite out of a soft landing yet and we're"
"11953850","11962010"," not at the recessionary period it's like a space docking we're if we're space docking over here"
"11962010","11971590"," okay there's there's like the soft landing period then there's the guaranteed"
"11971590","11977450"," recessionary period not quite out of the soft landing and there's this like there's this like"
"11977450","11986390"," indeterminate truly historically in indeterminate phase uh there's an indeterminate phase"
"11986390","11993410"," indeterminate phase uh that we i can't put any percentages on i looked at them i looked at every"
"11993410","11996710"," one of them and i was like yeah i was like it's like throwing a fucking dart at the board"
"11996710","12001690"," uh so if you so if you do this on your own come on this you want to do something"
"12001690","12005890"," cool i already have the chart but it took me a lot of work i ain't showing it to anybody"
"12005890","12013510"," i showed it to a few as a small group we have seen it i'll say this go back in"
"12013510","12018590"," history get your no pads out at home you want to do something fun you want to do something cool"
"12018590","12024070"," you don't get a lot of you don't get a lot of original thinking on fin twit i got a"
"12024070","12030490"," good one for you you'll like this one go on fin twit not fin twit sorry get up into it"
"12030490","12040300"," but you're gonna go on fin twit afterwards i have something for you go back and"
"12040300","12049160"," uh you can go back as far as you want but uh go back and find what is widely accepted"
"12049160","12058880"," as the start and end of the last i don't know do you like the last uh about five soft"
"12058880","12068620"," landings and uh do the start and finishes of the last five recessions"
"12068620","12073220"," you can go farther back go far as far back as you want do like the 70s the 50s do"
"12073220","12077300"," whatever you like go out there and get the data for it you can find it anywhere you can find"
"12077300","12082700"," you can just start searching for it and you'll find it now i want you to plot on a chart"
"12082700","12091920"," an NYA chart a SPX chart whatever you want whatever it goes far back as you want right uh plot"
"12091920","12100660"," those dates because i don't ever hear people talk about this ever ever and"
"12100660","12107740"," plot what if we if we do have a soft landing when does it start when does it end then"
"12107740","12116020"," the we always we always get a recessionary period 100 percent of time after the soft landing we get"
"12116020","12123380"," a recession but then i want you to look at the period between what's accepted as the start start"
"12123380","12130800"," and stop of a soft landing and the start and stop of the guaranteed recession and then i want you"
"12130800","12139620"," to come back and tell me what you think about that period that period is not often discussed uh"
"12139620","12148460"," infant to it it's a fascinating uh it's a fascinating thing to to look back and see what they were"
"12148460","12155320"," doing during that time period in terms of rates uh the rates of unemployment the rate of jobs and"
"12155320","12162700"," the rate of um the fed funds rates the inverted yield curve too is it you're all wrapped up in"
"12162700","12168900"," that and in policy making it in those time periods and it's fascinating because there's like a"
"12168900","12176120"," window uh i i don't know what to call it there's like a window between those periods and they they"
"12176120","12186040"," vastly differ and i want to know what your thoughts are on that not my thoughts i've already done"
"12186040","12190240"," the work i want to see what you know the cool part about that is if you post that stuff"
"12190240","12195660"," on fint to it uh you'll be like that's an original thought it's not really too widely discussed and"
"12195660","12200880"," what is that window called nobody has a name for it that i've found there's just like a window in"
"12200880","12208040"," between uh soft landings hard landings recessions when we skip a recession or not so we're not"
"12208040","12212260"," actually skip them if you get a soft landing you actually get one every time or historically every"
"12212260","12217360"," time you get one afterwards but it's fascinating to see that window in between when they declare"
"12217360","12223720"," the uh something like hey this this was the soft landing over here and then when the recessionary"
"12223720","12229840"," period starts there's a there's this like window sweet spot and a lot of that has a lot of that"
"12229840","12238240"," has to do with the velocity of uh unemployment um velocity of the inverted yield curve velocity of"
"12238240","12244220"," um uh jobs and unemployment and that kind of stuff and where they actually are in relation to like"
"12244220","12249460"," is is an employment now at six percent or not uh did inflation spike at two percent now it's"
"12249460","12261280"," fucking ripping faces off all that stuff matters la porta yeah i like that too it's"
"12261280","12266960"," a really fascinating thing to look at so and so that's why i'm like really like oh sometimes i go"
"12266960","12274600"," and finto it and i'll be like we are entering the period of probably the most manipulated part of"
"12274600","12280740"," the fed and treasury department uh is right now we're starting to come into like we're about midway"
"12280740","12288680"," through the minimum soft landing and you should see like mass manipulation as long as they can i"
"12292680","12302520"," like it i like the la porta i like it it's"
"12302520","12312520"," um hello baby squeeze on up there tag that hourly trigger let's take a look at the let's"
"12312520","12322420"," take a look here don't we uh the trainable range right now is all the way"
"12322420","12329100"," up to uh 51 75 so way up here we get a lot of room to run up here remember"
"12329100","12334820"," that we got that gap to fill right there so be careful of this squeeze and then the gap fill"
"12334820","12342960"," for up here if we do break above that uh that gap above and we can consolidate we are going"
"12342960","12357040"," to try to attack and go straight up to that 51 75 so"
"12357040","12366870"," big moment here for the gap fill on spx let me know if you think that we just"
"12366870","12372350"," run it up do you guys see that spx gamachart down there do you guys think uh maybe you guys"
"12372350","12379210"," can't see it all so see that gap back here maybe i should remove this here maybe i should make"
"12379210","12387350"," this cleaner so i'll put that up here we are now above the gamma flip just so you know but"
"12387350","12396530"," i want to remember this down here so maybe i'll write this as a um just right here whoop right"
"12396530","12407000"," there or maybe i just draw maybe make a gray or something there's"
"12407000","12411040"," a little bit of a gap not filled down below here maybe that works and i'll just do um um"
"12414220","12433030"," probably not the best thing to be no no no no no no no don't want gap we'll"
"12433030","12441090"," uh make this smaller and the color different white make this like 26 down here doesn't need to be"
"12441090","12453970"," filled just gap to fill down below gamma flip is right over here so"
"12453970","12463730"," you can see the gamma flip right there we see i make this bigger for you right"
"12463730","12470070"," about there and also note that there's another i'll make this cleaner for you there's one"
"12470070","12479150"," resistance right there and there's a second one right oh nope there's a second one uh"
"12479150","12489050"," right about there there we go right there that's"
"12489050","12504100"," maybe a cleaner picture for you the"
"12504100","12512480"," big big moment for bulls here if they are able to break above figure if"
"12512480","12522280"," bulls are able to break above i am on a roll to the downside tomorrow we do know that"
"12522280","12528020"," uh sellers are selling vol before we get to events so it would not shock me to see us go"
"12528020","12536860"," up but pay attention to this right up here this little this little zone of um this little zone up"
"12536860","12544360"," here of interest right up there if you are a bull you're going to be looking for this kind of"
"12544360","12555540"," a consolidation and then an eventual move up to actually see it with the hourly trigger come"
"12555540","12565540"," on dude what's going on with my cursor is not cooperating today about there right about there"
"12565540","12574080"," somewhere in there doesn't look pretty does it this is prettier that looks ugly you get the gist"
"12574080","12582100"," right so i guess if you're a bull this is what you want to see you want to see that"
"12582100","12588040"," squeeze up you want to see the push back down the consolidation and then this right here this green"
"12588040","12596880"," hourly trigger would be the signal for you as a bull uh to take out that prior high right there"
"12599000","12604200"," come back down and bam you're off and running that's a big one for the bulls right hold on i'm"
"12604200","12613180"," having real problems here uh i have a cat here on the optical cord okay sorry about that take that"
"12613180","12617760"," one out take that one out take that one out see that right there you get the pre-prior high"
"12617760","12623360"," consolidate squeeze that one up and then you're really off and running and we'll start blasting"
"12623360","12629460"," north here i'll put that one up for you too and i'll make this one uh yellow because i'm not"
"12629460","12638500"," on this trade i'm on this trade right here this this pull back down if we do this i will"
"12638500","12671910"," go along with you let me go back to the green screen you"
"12671910","12681230"," got it david that is correct david is absolutely correct uh jerry berry saying spy needs to stay"
"12681230","12691070"," above five ten eighty for a possible target of uh five thirteen fifty and then five"
"12691070","12705100"," sixteen both supply areas but we are still in a four hour and one hour uptrend uh for now i'm"
"12705100","12715790"," fascinated to see what happens here if they sell the vol into tomorrow's event or not or"
"12715790","12723430"," if they trap you into that event we're going to find out another note here too would be one last"
"12723430","12727810"," note that i have to tell you here is and i got a warning of this if you get the"
"12727810","12734610"," squeeze up here oftentimes we'll come back down for that test and we fail so just be aware of that"
"12734610","12740010"," you want to see this part of the trade is important you want to see the bounce in the consolidation"
"12740010","12745990"," move you don't want to see like the squeeze and a failure and also the bigger the squeeze the less"
"12745990","12765990"," stable it is let's see it in action right now there's more"
"12765990","12776800"," room to go up there there's some more supply up there it's trying right now this"
"12776800","12780580"," is going to be a big tell right here whatever this move is is going to be a huge tell"
"12781700","12788240"," huge tell because you want to see this squeeze and begin to consolidate you want to see that hourly"
"12788240","12795180"," trigger come right up underneath it what you don't want to see is the squeeze and a firm rejection"
"12795180","12800480"," to the downside that's bad that's like doom see that shit these bears gonna come right in and be"
"12800480","12807100"," like yeah suck it we're going down just another chance for liquidity you don't also don't want to"
"12807100","12812560"," see an immediate fucking red candle right here in the hourly trigger that's bad news too well not"
"12812560","12819480"," necessarily right away bad news but we'll lead to something like this down tomorrow so let's pay"
"12819480","12830600"," close attention to this as it happens let's see what happens here nice"
"12830600","12839630"," little squeeze right now into the hourly trigger trade 5.1186 let's see if we can break higher"
"12841050","12847130"," there's a little more right over here yeah that's that 512 put it right there but it's like right"
"12847130","12869950"," it's like right there right there and"
"12876380","12884440"," video with a triple bottom and video is looking constructive here SPX closing the gap right now on"
"12884440","12891840"," the upside currently this gap has now been closed still a gap left to fill down below down here"
"12891840","12901100"," whoopsie there hi WM still consolidating"
"12901100","12908320"," QQQ's dip buyer stepping in down below here this is the regular place for dip buyers to step it"

"13053600","13059720"," shit i didn't do eth did i let me do eth really quick i got to ask for about eth"
"13059720","13070590"," this morning if any of you have uh some people i think trader podcast talked about eth let"
"13070590","13080060"," me take a look at it i was asked my thoughts on it oh boy eth"
"13085220","13092620"," i think uh someone's i think someone said target is forty eight hundred on eth"
"13092620","13116100"," let me look and see what i think no"
"13116100","13121520"," he said forty eight no oh he might have said fifty eight hundred you're right i think he might have"
"13121520","13128220"," said that you're i think you're right uh so i'm mistaken he didn't say forty eight hundred he did"
"13128220","13138040"," say fifty eight hundred so i am mistaken oh boy um"
"13138040","13150820"," i don't know if you want my yeah"
"13150820","13158020"," um i would get the fuck out of the way if you're an eth bear that's what"
"13158020","13167920"," i'll say i think about eth i can show it to you playing his"
"13167920","13176180"," day let's switch over really quick okay so here's my take on eth okay"
"13176180","13183360"," we're gonna look at eth really quick and there's a period here i want you to look at with me"
"13183360","13193160"," okay uh especially on velocity on eth but i do like about these crick these shit coins i'm gonna"
"13193160","13203140"," say it shit coins is this right here i want to draw your attention to"
"13203140","13213680"," this yellow line right here and what has not happened yet and that is this right here you"
"13213680","13221460"," can see the weekly here maxing out we're almost there over here in the weekly right right um but"
"13221460","13227240"," what isn't what hasn't happened yet is we haven't had that happen that's when you get the monthly"
"13227240","13234620"," velocity to the upside and you see stupid shit like this like any pullback gets bought and you see"
"13234620","13244540"," crazy stupid new highs does that make sense so i would say to you this expect volatility on"
"13244540","13254060"," eth saying that there will be volatility though expect any and all tips to be bought for an off the"
"13254060","13262720"," chart kind of an upside move like a like an insane move to the upside even though it's straight"
"13262720","13268620"," vertical right now i do expect pullbacks i expect them to be bought i expect the weekly and the"
"13268620","13277360"," daily to be bought and we are not done going up come on here i want to do sound recorder"
"13277360","13286500"," uh so to that point uh your first target of course is going to be five thousand uh well not"
"13286500","13294100"," of course well your first target is right where we are so here let's uh let's look down here so"
"13294100","13301020"," your first target right now is right where we are right where we eth is so right there is your"
"13301020","13307340"," first target right there and then over right where eth is and we're we're right on it right now"
"13307340","13316000"," your next target on eth of course is all of these other places right you got another one right"
"13317640","13328690"," there and you got another one right over here let's bring"
"13328690","13337320"," those over right there right there and"
"13337320","13347140"," right there so as we pierce these i am going to"
"13347140","13354260"," expect you get that right there right pull back down something like that something like that"
"13354260","13363560"," something like that something like that violence violence violence violence in the move up do i"
"13363560","13370060"," expect us to hit five thousand yes do i think that's the end of the run for eth no i"
"13370060","13375880"," do expect a pretty violent sell up there though like violence could come all the way down there"
"13375880","13381140"," maybe not that far and then have to work its way up but i think you're eventually going to be"
"13381140","13389840"," looking for at least at least if i were to measure this i think six thousand is being very nice"
"13389840","13396700"," i see the six thousand and then i also see the pullback consolidation"
"13396700","13404520"," maybe down there and then the continuation of the upside right there just so you can see it right"
"13404520","13410160"," there how it all plays out whoop right there come back down whip right up there and i think you're"
"13410160","13417260"," going to see um easily see even even new highs on uh that maybe even some thousand over there"
"13417260","13424360"," somewhere like this pretty big moves right there right talking about some time to get there keep an"
"13424360","13431080"," eye on this one right here too just this weekly trigger down here right there you see it bam danger"
"13431080","13439780"," maybe this is middle of summer maybe this is the fall and there you go june and september already"
"13442570","13449830"," drew it out it's already showing itself something just like that does that make sense so if you're"
"13449830","13460050"," an eath person uh that's what i see eath"
"13460050","13467990"," uh i think top target is uh roughly right over five thousand do i think you can get the six"
"13467990","13499020"," thousand yes uh do i think you can go higher than six thousand yes yes i do yeah i"
"13499020","13505640"," i'm going to guess here that i'm going to guess here that people are pretty bullish here i think"
"13505640","13514000"," you're waiting for tomorrow morning i can be wrong but i think you are i think you are because uh"
"13514000","13520940"," i i don't think it's a matter of uh price action i think it's a matter of uh the ball"

"14796340","14801500"," that's the that's the overall downside target there's some other targets like a hundred bucks"
"14801500","14808900"," there's like a count for $100 but I would really like to see him be let have just a big"
"14808900","14816260"," flush down there close the nine there's a gap at like 96 I think or 98 haven't looked recently for"

"14851130","14860690"," will again I have in the past and I will again absolutely Tesla's like if you're thinking in terms"
"14860690","14867730"," of like a year I'm thinking in terms of 20 years I think one of the major problems for Tesla"
"14867730","14879050"," right now is that the time between great things happening is stretching so"
"14879050","14887990"," that's an issue that's a major issue for Tesla but overall I am bullish they have some they do have"
"14887990","14893430"," some existential threats that are legitimate too they've got threats with they've got threats with"
"14893430","14902870"," Chinese EVs of course but I'm looking at a scale now of like 2035 to 2030"
"14902870","14911330"," is when you're going to see a big crossover in EV and ICE engines if they can make it to"
"14911330","14917730"," right around that time period there should be a resolution for Tesla that's very positive around"
"14917730","14925530"," that time period 2030-2035 a long time from now all that needs to be priced in that's another 10"
"14925530","14931550"," years from now 11 years from now right so five to 10 years from now so the horizon for me"
"14931550","14940210"," is much farther down the road I am bullish on Tesla over the next 10 to 15 years and price"
"14940210","14950210"," on Tesla but it's much wider so yeah if I can catch 100 bucks if I can"
"14950210","14960220"," catch 70 bucks let me pile onto it a"
"14960220","14968260"," Tesla should work on a hydrogen car I don't know I get the point behind the hydrogen car I think"
"14968260","14976500"," all I think all any of that tech is better than than ICE engines I know that there's always going"
"14976500","14982840"," to be a need for ICE engines I know I understand that 100% but I think we need to"
"14982840","14992660"," spread out some of our what we're using I'm also afraid of the loss of lubricants and plastics"
"14992660","14998880"," hopefully we can hopefully we can mind that shit someday off Earth"
"14998880","15008860"," we need that stuff we need that stuff for the expansion of"

"16037460","16047380"," by nine thirty high probability of it yeah i don't want any puts for tomorrow um i"

"16057560","16067490"," gonna be green not"
"16067490","16077070"," true holy winners are selling theta"
"16077070","16082010"," um i don't believe that statement there's a bunch of statements out there that are they're untrue"
"16082010","16091610"," uh there's like statements that um being a buyer of stocks is better that's bullshit um i've heard"
"16091610","16098470"," people say things like sp500 uh has been flat for with no returns for 20 years that's bullshit uh"
"16098470","16104170"," dividends are great selling but selling options on the sp500 is great pays very well but people get"
"16104170","16108870"," fucked up all the time selling options too so selling theta can be good but it's still dangerous"
"16108870","16113230"," like the one thing about that shit is like you go back and look at the math on it and"
"16113230","16120210"," you're like yeah you're like between the one loss that i took and i took a drumming on the taxes"
"16120210","16126050"," the fees i guess you could say you'd be up by like 10 percent but then why not just buy"
"16126050","16130610"," the s&p 500 you just might as well as but if you can't outperform the sp500 you have no"
"16130610","16138210"," business being in the market uh the only other thing about this too is the better swing you could"
"16138210","16147950"," take would be to remove the money from marketplace fully and uh buy assets that uh that uh go up"
"16147950","16154390"," over time appreciate appreciating assets there's more to this than just the stock market there's"
"16154390","16159730"," like so there's more to this than just the stock market if you have a win and you remove that"
"16159730","16165430"," money from the stock markets and you invested in an appreciating asset that's low risk you're still"
"16165430","16171490"," doing better than someone's selling uh theta or selling uh options in general running the wheel"
"16171490","16176250"," whatever the fuck it is you're doing the real winners in this market are the people that make money"
"16176250","16182250"," remove it from the market and put them in and put your money into you can believe some of it"
"16182250","16189030"," in the market but there's a greater picture here uh that's not often discussed uh that i think is"
"16189030","16194510"," way better uh like you know you buy a house or something you buy some gold whatever it is uh"
"16194510","16200090"," i don't know baseball playing cards i don't care what you buy and maybe not baseball playing cards"
"16200090","16209670"," but something that appreciates uh regardless over time uh i think that's where the real win is uh"
"16209670","16217430"," and i think that's how you fund all of those slightly more risky or things that you do that's my"
"16217430","16222490"," own personally i always hear the same thing about futures right pro i think trade podcast pro's"
"16222490","16227590"," trade futures a lot of you have never seen someone get fucked up in futures it is not fucking fun"
"16227590","16232450"," when it happens i got another thing for you well i'm not going to say this part i'm going to"
"16232450","16241090"," stay out of that part because uh like piss off uh you know a lot of futures traders are losers"
"16241090","16250490"," whole ton of them um i think for you as a person if it was me as a person you"
"16250490","16258430"," likely need a well-rounded uh risk profile like i have a savings account i have a 401k i buy"
"16258430","16266050"," um stuff like an index i buy up share of s uh s p y or whatever it is s"
"16266050","16275730"," p x whatever you want to do uh like that's a baseline i bought haycap i bought myself a house"
"16275730","16279470"," haycap i made three and a k this year i was able to put a down payment on house i"
"16279470","16284390"," want you to say stuff like that to me um you know what i mean or haycap had a kickass"
"16284390","16290470"," year i took that money out of the stock market i want you guys to say that if you don't"
"16290470","16297270"," you learn you will at some point do very well doing whatever it is you do when you're going to"
"16297270","16300630"," be like you're going to get to like year five or ten and you're going to come back and you're"
"16300630","16305350"," going to go fuck i should have taken all that money out and bought some shit uh that appreciates in"
"16305350","16310650"," value and once you learn that lesson you'll go down that road um you'll learn all these lessons as"
"16310650","16315930"," time passes on another thing about selling shit too is a lot of times you need money for that so"
"16315930","16320730"," a lot of guys don't aren't have don't have a net worth of a million dollars or free money and"
"16320730","16325090"," i mean free uh like you don't need it for anything else you don't have to live off it you"
"16325090","16328290"," don't have to expect anything more to come in on it you need to have some wealth behind you to"
"16328290","16336290"," be doing that stuff so that every person's path is different to get there but um i can understand"
"16336290","16341290"," people wanting to put risk on uh i can't blame them for doing that and a lot of people do"
"16341290","16346650"," that in general i don't know anyone do you fucking know anybody out there that came into a market"
"16346650","16352870"," and started out by uh selling theta or no no offense to that i it's a great great plan very"
"16352870","16359110"," low risk but um you know like most people can market they're like what i don't know i bought my"
"16359110","16365790"," favorite stock uh i bought a my favorite stock that someone told me about um i bought marijuana"
"16365790","16374070"," stocks because i smoke weed i bought um i don't know Nike stocks because my kids like nikis i"
"16374070","16381890"," bought BTC because everybody likes bitcoin you know it's all my friends talk about right so i think"
"16381890","16387189"," it's okay if you do that stuff it's part of your process where you need to be to get but"
