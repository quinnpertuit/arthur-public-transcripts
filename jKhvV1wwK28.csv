"112720","115280"," Who's just rushing to the upside right now?"
"117000","118180"," Oh, wait a minute, my camera's off. "
"119380","119740"," What the heck happened?"
"119920","120500"," My camera hair."

"122880","124000"," Come on now, come on camera."
"125280","127139"," You can do it, baby, come on. "
"131780","133700"," See if my camera comes on here."
"135400","137000"," What's going on out there?"
"137180","137680"," Good morning."
"143760","145620"," Well, well, well. "
"147360","152300"," Spy trading, 5, 13, 14 right now."
"154640","156280"," What's going on out there?"
"156840","163220"," Are you going to slap that ask right now as we open?"
"165280","167720"," Bear with me as I close this shit out."
"167720","169200"," Just give me one quick second here. "
"170720","175140"," I want to make sure I don't get tasty."
"175500","177180"," Sometimes I'm like, I'm going to do this."
"177360","180960"," Then tasty's like, you're going to reset the entire thing and log back in this morning. "
"181140","182080"," So give me one quick second here."
"204940","206580"," How are we all doing this morning?"
"218260","220140"," Let's crack it out there this morning."
"220480","221640"," I got to do one quick thing. "
"221940","222980"," We got to look at a few things."
"224320","228880"," So number one, I guess I got to reset this or something."
"231500","232360"," What's that up top?"
"232560","233980"," What does that say up top up there?"
"235300","238300"," That's not what we were reading the other day, was it?"
"239940","242740"," That was not we were reading two days ago, was it?"
"246800","249060"," I'm looking right now and I don't see. "
"250240","251020"," I see it."
"251200","251620"," That's funny."
"251780","252300"," I'm looking right now. "
"252300","252740"," What does it say?"
"253180","255940"," Stocks gained for a second day in a row."
"257880","258399"," Huh."
"259540","264020"," Two days ago, what was the, what was the discussion two days ago?"
"264440","265700"," I want to know in the chat. "
"267400","271560"," You tell me in the chat, what was the discussion?"
"273440","274440"," Two days ago."
"276560","277760"," Let me know in the chat."
"278720","279600"," What was it?"
"280960","281920"," Two days ago. "
"289870","291230"," We know what it was, right?"
"294350","295910"," Stock market crash, right?"
"296170","297350"," It was stock market crash."
"298450","299930"," That's what it was two days ago."
"301310","303270"," And where are we right now?"
"305450","307210"," 512.97, right?"
"307870","309010"," That's what we are right now, right?"
"312990","319830"," It's not a matter of, it's not a matter of what I think or what you think. "
"320710","322010"," That's not what matters."
"322970","328770"," What does matter is price action, right?"
"329450","334950"," Not thesis, not the plan, right?"
"335230","336330"," The plan goes the wrong way."
"336330","336930"," What do you do?"
"340370","343430"," We've got people on, we've got people on what?"
"343890","346670"," Stock market crash watch, right?"
"346850","347650"," We got that going on. "
"349130","358650"," If you saw that on Twitter, they posted from a large company what their plan was."
"359330","361050"," They didn't bother with stock market crash."
"361390","362410"," They just said, fuck it. "
"362410","364510"," We're going to do stock market watch."
"366990","372590"," We'll run that shit for, I don't know, run it for as long as we need to, right?"
"372770","373390"," It gets views."
"376310","377430"," And yes, here we are. "
"379030","387310"," And we are trading right now, 5.13.03. You know, it's not easy for that."
"387530","390770"," It's not easy for, what am I doing here?"
"390770","392610"," How do I do this and do this wrong or something?"
"398070","399150"," What am I doing wrong here?"
"399270","401910"," I just need a share of a link."
"402390","403050"," There we go. "
"423090","424390"," Let's post that right there."
"424590","424950"," Apologize."
"425130","425950"," I don't have a lot of sleep. "
"429090","430590"," Like burn in the candle air."
"431230","433550"," I don't even know what to say about CNBC this morning."
"434190","442990"," Two days ago, three days ago, we were told that the top was called by the big banks, right?"
"443690","445210"," We were told run. "
"447710","451770"," And here we are blasting up again this morning."
"452230","454510"," We were told this time is different."
"455670","459610"," We were told, you know, hold on to that short that you have. "
"459610","469710"," We, as a matter of fact, I posted on our website the put buying, right?"
"470030","476190"," Then I, then you could see the closing of puts and then the doubling down of puts."
"477110","484470"," Big money into the clothes as market was going up yesterday."
"484470","491670"," Yesterday, there are the clothes two days ago, and then yesterday was that's just a squeeze. "
"493710","494750"," It's just this."
"494950","495650"," It's just that."
"498070","499690"," What are we trading right now?"
"500630","502850"," Five, 13, 40. "
"504630","506350"," Do I even do the opening bell?"
"506850","508570"," I don't even know that I need to do this this morning."
"508570","510650"," Do I just go right over to it right now?"
"510670","513370"," I'll do it in the bottom left hand corner for you."
"514130","515710"," Where are we trading right now?"
"516370","518650"," Say it with me in the chat. "
"526010","527850"," There's your yellow box right there."
"534740","535940"," Touch it for me."
"539720","540500"," Touch it. "
"541500","543640"," Get up there and touch it."
"550070","552070"," Now trading five, 13, 55."
"553590","555170"," We make it pretty for you. "
"560210","561410"," This is what happens."
"561650","565170"," You get told things that are not true."
"566810","569790"," You get told things for your emotions. "
"572430","576710"," I was on stream two days ago and told do not buy a dip."
"577470","582310"," I will wait until it becomes bullish again."
"583490","584590"," Where are we?"
"585310","587010"," Are you now buying calls?"
"587470","589250"," Do you want to buy my calls?"
"590210","596890"," Get on your brokerage and buy my calls at the ask. "
"607940","616700"," Twenty cents calls yesterday are now trading 90 cents."
"617640","619440"," Please buy them from me."
"620140","621360"," It's looking bullish. "
"622860","625480"," Can you pick them up for me right now, please?"
"628380","629740"," It's now bullish."
"630280","630760"," Pick it up."
"631720","633160"," Buy my calls from me, please. "
"633720","635460"," They're hot and ready for you."
"644540","646680"," I need a buyer here."
"657670","660930"," What up, David AMS?"
"661090","661890"," Good morning, my brother. "
"674640","679740"," I had two people this morning, probably good friends or whatever."
"679740","681640"," They were like, I thought you were flat in the clothes."
"682500","684500"," Like two friends of the show. "
"686160","688440"," Wait a minute, you were flat yesterday."
"689360","690880"," I was like, they didn't watch to the end."
"691320","691620"," Did they?"
"694400","695460"," Some of you did. "
"697120","700520"," I actually watched yesterday's viewership."
"701460","706420"," I actually watched yesterday's viewership numbers."
"708040","710340"," Not this morning, but I watched them yesterday. "
"710440","712180"," This is what yesterday's viewership numbers were."
"713460","716560"," Watching the show, right?"
"717300","719060"," We all needed to take a break and piss."
"720320","727020"," So viewership went down, came back from break, viewership back up again. "
"727340","728440"," So everybody's taking a break, right?"
"729900","733700"," And then right around like 330, right there."
"734700","737800"," So if you were in the show yesterday to the close."
"738600","740480"," So four o'clock in the afternoon. "
"744360","748320"," We literally bought zero date calls."
"752620","754840"," Three fifty in the afternoon."
"755800","756560"," Yesterday. "
"763540","767620"," So I apologize to you if you didn't stick around until four."
"768940","772460"," We do it here until we stop the show."
"775440","778600"," When we stop the show, it's over, but we didn't. "
"779780","781700"," We stayed we around here."
"781820","784640"," You know, we call it the bitter end."
"785680","788000"," We stay until the bitter end. "
"789880","792580"," It's not fun staying until the bitter end."
"793940","796640"," I realize at times it can be boring."
"797760","801620"," I realize at times you sit in your hands, right?"
"801800","802120"," What do you do?"
"802300","803120"," You sit in your hands. "
"805640","812460"," And you wait until it resolves to somewhere that you can make an informed guest."
"814160","815020"," You might be wrong."
"815120","816060"," I mean, I could have been wrong. "
"816360","819660"," Okay, we'll get this morning and it was blasting down to the depths of hell."
"820720","824840"," But that that yesterday, do you remember yesterday the down moves?"
"825640","828480"," The big boulders coming down, raining down."
"829520","831880"," And we're like, is it bullish?"
"832860","833600"," Is it bearish?"
"833880","834500"," Do you buy this?"
"834840","835200"," I don't know. "
"837080","840120"," And we had to sit here until the close for."
"841220","844900"," A little tiny, a little tiny bit of."
"846080","847340"," That's probably going up. "
"847940","850000"," They just trapped every seller at that moment."
"852620","854920"," So there's your top pin strike right there."
"855020","855560"," You want to see it?"
"857460","858920"," There it is right there. "
"861020","862440"," It's right there."
"864360","865920"," How's that apples right there?"
"866000","866640"," Is that close enough?"
"867960","868820"," It's okay."
"877360","882300"," Should I post the we do it, we do it live video on Twitter?"
"889850","892450"," Okay, so all that out of the way. "
"893510","896050"," First thing this morning, I'm losing my voice."
"897050","900950"," I'm speaking too much and streaming too much right now."
"901730","906470"," Normally I would stream like here and there or, you know, six hours a day. "
"907350","910770"," We've been streaming though more than we normally do."
"911110","914430"," We streamed now at like eight thirty in the morning, nine o'clock in the morning."
"914870","919930"," We've pulled it until four p.m. It's been rough on my vocal cords. "
"920470","923310"," So I need you to understand that as we move forward for the rest of the week."
"924630","929170"," That this week in particular is not this week in particular like last week."
"929230","932710"," It built up into where I had no voice on Saturday. "
"933210","935390"," I didn't speak at all last weekend."
"936170","939590"," This morning my vocal cords are in the place."
"940610","945630"," That they were last week on Friday and today is Thursday, right?"
"946470","949950"," So I'm about a day early right now in my vocal cords. "
"950210","951570"," So you probably hear it this morning, right?"
"951730","953750"," Do you hear the, can you hear it in my voice?"
"954450","958770"," I'm well hydrated, well copied up, but my voice sounds pretty rough."
"958770","965110"," You can actually hear a, I don't know, sounds really messed up, but I need you to understand that"
"965110","967370"," today, okay, as we move forward."
"968530","975270"," If you followed us on those calls into the bell for the second day in a row, you should be"
"975270","976270"," very well up. "
"976670","978390"," You should be doing very well this week."
"979510","982710"," There's no reason for you to over trade this morning."
"983550","983910"," You understand?"
"984430","988050"," You take your money, you sit back and relax for a moment. "
"989490","991170"," Do you guys understand that out there?"
"992110","993130"," Thanks for being here, Cap."
"993330","996410"," Hey, look, I want you all to know something, okay?"
"997250","1000270"," I'm going to make bad trades on stream."
"1000270","1003470"," I am going to make good trades on stream. "
"1004090","1006090"," I want you to know something."
"1007870","1017270"," We started this because people make, they're living doing this, right?"
"1018130","1024130"," And they do not have basic fundamental trading tools, basic."
"1025190","1027550"," You would think that they do, but they don't. "
"1028329","1036630"," The number of people that I have sat down with behind closed doors over the years in conversations"
"1036630","1044750"," made friendships with, they regurgitate a lot of things that they learn out there."
"1045450","1048710"," They can regurgitate what Spot Gamma says."
"1049410","1056210"," You can get on Twitter right now and people will make posts that sound like they know what they're"
"1056210","1056970"," talking about. "
"1062110","1064550"," They will make posts researching."
"1067430","1068910"," Things that we need to know."
"1069170","1069750"," You need to know. "
"1070090","1070650"," I need to know."
"1072150","1074150"," They'll research all kinds of cool shit."
"1074490","1074950"," And it's great. "
"1075370","1076210"," I love consuming it."
"1078070","1082550"," I love to read it and take it on."
"1082790","1084090"," Like, hey, I need to know this information. "
"1085090","1087070"," But it has nothing."
"1087510","1089490"," To do with making money."
"1090710","1094350"," And making money is different. "
"1095190","1099010"," Than knowing anything about fucking gamma."
"1099450","1102610"," I'll be honest with you about gamma."
"1103470","1111270"," It's a way to, in my view, it's a way to complicate pivots. "
"1113330","1114490"," How I trade."
"1115250","1124210"," Think about, if you're going to think about how I trade, it is like a screen with a screen with"
"1124210","1126130"," a screen with a screen with a screen with a screen."
"1126610","1132010"," And what I need to know is, where are the Elliot wavers at?"
"1133430","1137550"," Then behind that screen, where are the traditional chartists at?"
"1138850","1140870"," Where are the gamma bros at?"
"1141850","1151110"," Where are the, where are these guys at over here, right?"
"1151330","1151850"," Triggers. "
"1152470","1156590"," Where are the 20 EMA guys at?"
"1156790","1159330"," Or where the 200 DMA guys at?"
"1159850","1162250"," Where's everybody at and how they trade?"
"1163290","1164770"," And then I have to layer them all."
"1165850","1167250"," You know, wall trading."
"1169530","1171210"," And that's what you have to do. "
"1172250","1174190"," You know, and you have to dumb your shit down."
"1174810","1176170"," Because making money is a lot different."
"1177170","1178230"," You see this right here?"
"1178990","1180230"," You see that right there?"
"1180350","1180870"," You watching this?"
"1183470","1185350"," What's that yellow bar right there?"
"1186350","1188550"," Take the money and run. "
"1188550","1198530"," And I need, or I'm"
"1198530","1206650"," not need, but I was shocked at how many people didn't have basic awareness of where the market is."
"1207210","1208070"," Like, where's this?"
"1208450","1209170"," Where's that?"
"1210970","1211990"," Where's the danger?"
"1213110","1213610"," Where's the money?"
"1218280","1219380"," And it really hurt me."
"1219580","1224120"," Like my kid, you're not like inside my inside my brain in my heart. "
"1224840","1226580"," I was like, we have to."
"1227180","1228800"," I was like, I'm stupid."
"1229820","1232360"," But we need to do this together. "
"1235180","1237960"," We started this with a small group, like a hundred people."
"1238280","1239800"," I was like, how are my friends?"
"1240800","1241980"," They're still here today."
"1242420","1243320"," They're all sitting here. "
"1243500","1245920"," They're all watching the show right now at home."
"1246860","1247560"," They're in the chat."
"1249360","1251080"," They call me DM me. "
"1251200","1251620"," I call them."
"1251620","1253240"," I called Binky last night."
"1253620","1255840"," I called David AMS last night. "
"1257380","1260160"," We talked last night until midnight."
"1260980","1261980"," These are my friends."
"1262220","1263340"," These are the people that I trade with. "
"1265000","1268480"," And, you know, they're all still here today."
"1269180","1269760"," Years later."
"1271040","1273880"," And they're here for you guys too, out there. "
"1274420","1277480"," This is a community of retail that is trying to help each other out."
"1278400","1282220"," So please stick around with us and follow along."
"1287960","1288500"," That's it. "
"1288640","1289360"," So I got on that stuff."
"1291480","1292500"," Good morning, everybody."
"1293260","1294200"," Y'all doing well?"
"1294340","1294860"," Good morning, Binky. "
"1295020","1295380"," How are you doing?"
"1299920","1300520"," All right."
"1302220","1303100"," Here we go."
"1304240","1305400"," Today's Thursday, right?"
"1305920","1306480"," I hope it is. "
"1307460","1312320"," We're going to talk about some of the economic news that we have and events coming up in the"
"1312320","1313440"," morning and then tomorrow."
"1314680","1316560"," We had claims this morning, right?"
"1317720","1321240"," 830 a.m. Then we had productivity and the U.S. trade balance."
"1321660","1325300"," At 940 right now, we've got your own power in the Senate. "
"1326180","1328960"," We then have Mr. Speaking of 1130."
"1329640","1334880"," We have, uh, Mr. Speaking again at 1 20."
"1335360","1336800"," We have consumer credit at three. "
"1337480","1339260"," If you look down below here."
"1339960","1343480"," There is also tomorrow a whammy of some kind."
"1343700","1348200"," We've got, uh, William speaking at 7 a.m. tomorrow. "
"1348760","1351640"," We have non farm payrolls at 830."
"1352880","1362380"," If you are a bull, you need to stay sober knowing that we still have a little bit of potential"
"1362380","1365120"," volatility today with Jerome Powell."
"1365120","1370360"," We still have a little bit of volatility tomorrow with non farm payrolls. "
"1370780","1372480"," You could be like, yeah, everything is awesome."
"1373280","1376880"," Come in tomorrow morning and they just blast it down to the depths of hell."
"1377340","1381200"," We saw it yesterday with supply coming in yesterday, right?"
"1381440","1383040"," They like swatted down. "
"1384280","1385200"," Price, what?"
"1385560","1386720"," Three, four times yesterday."
"1388760","1391340"," That could be dealers could be Marco."
"1392500","1393980"," We don't know who it is. "
"1395220","1397000"," But you need to be hyper aware of that."
"1397180","1397300"," Okay."
"1398020","1400040"," And the rage that's going to come. "
"1401100","1404380"," Uh, from these, uh, these, these, this price action, right?"
"1405480","1406540"," I call it rage."
"1406780","1408180"," I try to keep it simple around here."
"1411200","1413180"," So I'm going to close that down below. "
"1413640","1416180"," Tesla trying to rip faces off to the upside."
"1417220","1419220"," If you were with me long Tesla."
"1420620","1424880"," Because I do have a position open on Tesla and I have time on that position. "
"1425720","1430960"," I am looking for on the low end, 182, the high end, 186."
"1432100","1435060"," Uh, there is an issue here with Tesla."
"1435580","1436160"," Hey, Kitty. "
"1436920","1438420"," Um, there's an issue here."
"1439120","1444540"," Uh, I had a, I had them going to 200 sooner than later."
"1446000","1447460"," It's, it's a little bit. "
"1448920","1451400"," Extended in time, maybe an extra five days."
"1452160","1453700"," 20th somewhere in there, 28th."
"1453980","1457660"," Now we could do that right now, but I want you to be aware that if you are a long"
"1457660","1463660"," Tesla with me, uh, you could potentially roll potentially roll your position at about 182 to 186. "
"1464760","1468860"," Um, to reposition yourself or you can just be like bucket cap."
"1468880","1469360"," You're wrong."
"1469580","1471060"," We're going to 200 tomorrow. "
"1471580","1474940"," If that happens, uh, it's going to be party time, right?"
"1476100","1478000"," All those questions about are you right?"
"1478120","1478580"," Are you wrong?"
"1479160","1485180"," Uh, you know, as we resolve, as they resolve themselves, you will find out around here that, um,"
"1485640","1488860"," uh, we, we win more than we lose when it's done."
"1489080","1491180"," We manage positions properly around here."
"1491340","1491860"," Hi, Kitty. "
"1492480","1493500"," Check this kitty out."
"1494060","1496100"," I was like a Russian blue or something like that."
"1496380","1498220"," Can you see her, see her in the thingy?"
"1498520","1499220"," Here she goes. "
"1500400","1502720"," She's all, she's all purring right now."
"1503460","1504700"," What are you doing over here?"
"1504820","1505860"," Oh, so risky this morning."
"1508700","1511840"," I'm going to bet that, uh, nobody wants to hang out with her right now. "
"1521120","1522600"," She's like play with me."
"1522660","1523380"," I'm like, I can't."
"1526320","1526760"," Okay. "
"1526940","1529300"," So, um, hopefully you close your positions."
"1529300","1531400"," I put the yellow bar up there for you."
"1533240","1536660"," If you want targets to the upside, we can look at those right now. "
"1537660","1539240"," So we hit our first target right there."
"1539560","1542220"," Now let's take a look at, uh, let me see if we can go to the triggers really quick."
"1543460","1544040"," Hi, Kitty. "
"1544540","1545500"," Oh, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty."
"1546060","1547540"," Now Kitty is above my head."
"1551980","1553780"," There's a cat above me right now. "
"1554740","1555760"," What are you doing up there?"
"1557040","1557460"," Oh, yeah."
"1557640","1557880"," I'm in trouble."
"1562820","1564540"," I'm in so much trouble this morning. "
"1568740","1573600"," Let's take a look at a, um, let's, uh, let's zoom out a little bit if we can, okay?"
"1576200","1576860"," Hi, Kitty."
"1578440","1582700"," Kitty, you cannot sit on top of the computer to keep yourself warm."
"1583000","1583500"," No, no, Kitty. "
"1584500","1588660"," Kitty, that is a, um, that's an expensive, uh, butt warmer."
"1591940","1596380"," And she's going to swipe off the, uh, the driftwood from Joe Donuts."
"1596560","1597380"," Oh, here we go. "
"1598240","1599920"," Oh, no, not the bars of love."
"1602300","1604240"," Don't, don't, she just did it."
"1608240","1614120"," She just knocked off, uh, she just knocked off driftwood from a, from a, uh, boat. "
"1615760","1618660"," From South America that, uh, Joe gave me."
"1619560","1619920"," Okay."
"1620280","1621620"," So it's sorry about that. "
"1621680","1622100"," I apologize."
"1626180","1627060"," That's our assholes."
"1627280","1629080"," She literally went up there and she went, she like swiped it. "
"1629140","1629820"," She's like, you know what?"
"1630340","1630700"," Fuck you."
"1634720","1635080"," Okay."
"1635180","1635920"," So let's take a look here. "
"1636020","1636140"," Okay."
"1636640","1637980"," So right up here, right?"
"1638760","1640640"," We've got a all-time highs right here."
"1642580","1644800"," Not quite all-time highs, right?"
"1645940","1650340"," We know that sellers, last place sellers were, were right here, right?"
"1650800","1651540"," Sitting right up here. "
"1652960","1654040"," Uh, so what do we do here?"
"1654200","1654740"," What do you know?"
"1654920","1655980"," How do you know what to do?"
"1659680","1663960"," So, um, what we did, what I used to do, what I don't know."
"1664160","1670760"," What I was told, uh, years ago was, did you know that people pay for pivot points every day?"
"1670760","1672160"," I was like, no fucking way."
"1672400","1673380"," They're like, yeah, they do. "
"1673620","1674380"," I was like, that's crazy."
"1675580","1684060"," Uh, short story is that I was, uh, teaching my daughter how to, um, create gamma models, um, per"
"1684060","1685320"," feet, furval."
"1685700","1687880"," I figured, I don't know how to pronounce his name, but he's from Ukraine. "
"1688680","1691920"," He put out a post once about, uh, how to do your own gamma."
"1692920","1695040"," And so my daughter and I learned how to do it together."
"1696640","1702740"," And in that process, uh, she's started to help me, uh, to post in the morning. "
"1703220","1707680"," Pivot points for people for free on a handle on Twitter called, uh, Captain's Alpha."
"1708180","1709700"," Sometimes I'd be close there too."
"1710040","1712200"," I kept a very straight face on that handle. "
"1712560","1717760"," Uh, never shit posting, none of that bullshit and, uh, would post very important information."
"1718340","1727860"," If any of you were on that handle, you will remember that I made a huge post, uh, about what"
"1727860","1730420"," to expect in 2020, uh, three."
"1731040","1733060"," In December of 2022. "
"1733860","1739000"," And, uh, I made a post about you should long Excel C XL Y or not."
"1739000","1747100"," Why a whole bunch of like tech, um, indexes, small, uh, tech, or tech indexes."
"1748720","1751280"," And that is paid out very well at this point. "
"1752220","1757240"," In that process, uh, as we were making a jump to a sustainable community."
"1757900","1763380"," Uh, we decided that we were not only going to do just the nine, uh, tickers every morning, but we"
"1763380","1766460"," were going to build a tool to put on the website on the front page."
"1767200","1771460"," For you to input any symbol and get your levels every morning for free forever. "
"1773600","1779520"," On top of that, uh, we also offer an indicator to subscriber level or higher of pivots."
"1780200","1781580"," Now that you can put on training view."
"1781960","1783320"," So we're going to do that this morning. "
"1783960","1786940"," Uh, we're going to, we're going to show those pivots this morning."
"1789500","1790820"," Because of where we are, right?"
"1791400","1792440"," How high can we go?"
"1793240","1794400"," Where is the resistance?"
"1794880","1796040"," And there it is right there."
"1797040","1799460"," Now we can make this pivots, um, pivot option if you like. "
"1799460","1804500"," Uh, we can put our two, our three, our four and our five."
"1804980","1814530"," We actually know right now just by doing this that, uh, this is a cell zone up here."
"1815250","1818530"," If price gets up here, it's an auto cell. "
"1819750","1820490"," Make sense?"
"1821290","1826090"," Now it might not come down today or tomorrow, uh, but it will."
"1826730","1827370"," And you'll get paid."
"1827370","1831810"," So if you had like puts up here, like two, five, two, three days a week out, you'll get paid. "
"1832490","1835970"," We also know that, uh, that was taking place on the downside."
"1837230","1838270"," Two days in a row."
"1839850","1841850"," We were hitting our fours and our fives. "
"1842270","1847130"," So if you take calls that are week out a month out, there will be a turn."
"1848290","1849910"," About 90% of the time."
"1851470","1858490"," So when we saw that, uh, two earlier days this week, the extensions of the pullback. "
"1859870","1861770"," You could take a long position."
"1862470","1864910"," No matter where we went and know that it would pay."
"1866310","1869570"," Even if there was continued doom and gloom a day or two later. "
"1870010","1873970"," And right now we are right back to where all time."
"1873970","1877670"," I don't know if we roll over and down and it's doom and gloom."
"1878230","1882750"," If you're a bear out there, you can probably put another hedge on where we are. "
"1883630","1885470"," And we are likely getting a correction."
"1886350","1887730"," We know you guys know this, right?"
"1887870","1892690"," You guys are you guys know who all these other companies are out there."
"1892850","1896390"," They tell you where all the ball is. "
"1896530","1901210"," They tell you when the gamma comes off the market, they tell you where the events are."
"1902110","1904710"," And where we start to get really risky, right?"
"1904950","1906990"," Some of you guys out there know where it is."
"1906990","1908690"," How long the run is going to last?"
"1911030","1915470"," Somewhere around the 11th, but the least we're going to likely continue to go up. "
"1915750","1919070"," And as we can as we get into the end of quarter, we know there's stuff coming."
"1919590","1920670"," It's going to get nasty."
"1920670","1922030"," So we're up here right now. "
"1922610","1923430"," It's 514."
"1924970","1928950"," Maybe you're a bull and you said to yourself, oh, I missed it all."
"1928950","1930450"," Well, we're back here. "
"1931010","1932810"," If you want to hedge yourself, you can."
"1936650","1941490"," We said the other day you're a buyer of dips, not a seller of rips."
"1942670","1945970"," I'm assuming someone short here in this audience right now. "
"1946590","1948410"," They didn't close two days ago."
"1949030","1954210"," There's probably a seller here that is going to tell you that they did close and did not."
"1954750","1956630"," We have the data that you didn't. "
"1956630","1963130"," We know that you continued to buy fucking puts into the bell two days ago."
"1963730","1965290"," I showed it to you on the stream."
"1965950","1971430"," I showed you the continued put buying into the bell two days ago. "
"1972070","1973450"," That's real data."
"1974350","1978130"," That's not us talking or chatting or claiming."
"1978610","1979370"," We can see it. "
"1984340","1987520"," So we are at our two right now, 51373."
"1988260","1994220"," You've got more targets above stick with your with what the tools that we teach you are."
"1994820","1995120"," Right. "
"1996580","2000200"," We're going to go back to the main screen here and we're going to use this tool."
"2003000","2004380"," For further upside pullbacks."
"2005160","2005280"," Okay. "
"2006040","2009060"," So you know, as long as we're above the one minute trigger, we are bullish."
"2010320","2010800"," Right."
"2011400","2013500"," You've got the target of our two right now. "
"2013940","2016120"," You've got a small little double top here in the one minute trigger."
"2016540","2019240"," We can pull back and possible here to check five minute already."
"2020280","2024620"," So as long as we say above this, the next target to the upside is going to be five fifteen"
"2024620","2025840"," thirty nine. "
"2027000","2027480"," Cool."
"2029100","2032800"," H bomb saying right now that the volatility is coming off the market."
"2033280","2035800"," The grind is happening to the upside. "
"2038580","2039720"," What's going on, H bomb?"
"2039900","2040220"," How are you doing?"
"2040720","2041680"," Good to see you, man."
"2043360","2045720"," Where do I think NQ top is?"
"2046700","2048380"," We discussed this yesterday, right?"
"2048940","2050199"," I told you where I think we're going."
"2051679","2057880"," Five fifty five, five sixty or fifty six hundred fifty five hundred, I should say. "
"2058420","2061199"," Just below fifty five hundred on SPY or SPX."
"2061199","2064739"," And then we have a major pullback."
"2065360","2067000"," Then we hit fifty six hundred. "
"2067320","2068780"," We have another major pullback."
"2069420","2069980"," And then you ready?"
"2070480","2071060"," Fifty nine sixty."
"2072360","2073420"," That's what I expect. "
"2074080","2079420"," Now, if it doesn't do that or it becomes invalidated, we'll address it then."
"2080520","2083100"," It's okay for it to become invalidated as well."
"2083900","2085920"," This, I say this a lot, right?"
"2086699","2088460"," Our job is not to be right. "
"2089340","2096720"," Our job is to make a plan, accept them or run, and move forward from there, right?"
"2096900","2098220"," Adjust our trading to that."
"2098900","2105480"," There's no absolutes as a trader, an investor, there's no absolutes here at all."
"2105780","2109780"," If you can't get over that, you're not going to make it in this market. "
"2111000","2116220"," If you hold people to that as well, I see that on Twitter a lot."
"2116920","2120480"," But a lot of people on Twitter, people that I respect."
"2121160","2126920"," People go into like Andy Constance's comments and say, that fucking guy's always wrong. "
"2129780","2133760"," I'm like, what, number one, why are you expecting Andy Constance to be right?"
"2134400","2135060"," What at all?"
"2136140","2139460"," Or I got other guys out there that you'll see like Gem gets shit."
"2140820","2141700"," I don't know."
"2142100","2143020"," It doesn't matter, right?"
"2143360","2144100"," I don't like Gem. "
"2144560","2145780"," I don't like this guy."
"2145780","2147160"," I don't like Captain Jim James."
"2148040","2149100"," It's not about being right. "
"2149720","2154020"," Now these guys spend their time sharing their information with you, what they think."
"2154380","2154800"," They're plans."
"2155800","2157400"," I think it's gracious that they do it. "
"2157560","2158380"," They don't have to do that stuff."
"2159140","2161680"," And I don't really care if they're right or wrong at all."
"2162500","2167660"," Most people make those comments never, ever, ever open themselves out to that criticism. "
"2169180","2170400"," But I do know one thing."
"2170880","2172340"," Those guys have a plan."
"2172700","2173960"," Those guys do the research. "
"2173960","2177720"," Those guys, if they're wrong, counter trade it."
"2178420","2179920"," Now their own thesis is."
"2180320","2183360"," So yeah, where do I think it's going?"
"2185420","2185980"," 5960. "
"2186880","2188160"," That's the track we're on."
"2189060","2191900"," Into December, March of 2023."
"2192820","2196140"," If it reverses and we begin to not correct, but crash. "
"2197080","2197960"," I'll change my thesis."
"2199000","2200120"," They had no problem doing that."
"2200560","2202640"," I don't know what nobody had nothing on that stuff. "
"2203140","2204580"," That's going to be the same for you guys up."
"2204700","2207740"," Right now we're on that track, which is kind of crazy, right?"
"2207980","2208380"," It's unbelievable."
"2209220","2211060"," It's not something that I want to believe either. "
"2211400","2213280"," It's not something that I'm comfortable with."
"2213480","2215020"," It's not something that makes me feel good."
"2215880","2217980"," Even making that statement doesn't make me feel good. "
"2218100","2219700"," It's not something that I want to see."
"2220500","2222180"," But we are on that track right now."
"2224660","2227240"," And it's unbelievable that we're on that track right now. "
"2227240","2229320"," All right."
"2234010","2235470"," So here we go."
"2236390","2238270"," Trading 513 right now, 73. "
"2240030","2241290"," They're trying to push up right now."
"2241350","2244150"," We'll keep an eye on supply from the upside."
"2245030","2247230"," It gets dangerous up here and it gets very volatile. "
"2249370","2251850"," See if we can move some of the stuff over so you can see it better."
"2254290","2259010"," Push that back a little bit and maybe over right there."
"2261210","2262530"," Let's take a look at BookMap. "
"2263930","2266670"," Maybe we can go right straight to BookMap and see."
"2271310","2273150"," See what's going on up here."
"2276430","2278850"," You can see that supply there and there, right?"
"2279050","2280350"," Trying to break through it. "
"2281970","2284530"," It looks more like slow grind, right?"
"2285890","2287270"," It's not much market up here."
"2287270","2293690"," If I had to guess, if you want my professional opinion or non-professional opinion, this action"
"2293690","2304010"," here has less to do with going up there and more to do with bulls buying the Kool-Aid, expanding"
"2304010","2309970"," the upside targets right now, buying more calls, buying more calls, buying more calls."
"2311570","2313270"," So I think we're going that much higher. "
"2313270","2313890"," Probably not."
"2316950","2319050"," Target to the upside, 5156."
"2320690","2321790"," I'll give you that one right there. "
"2321970","2324930"," 5156, possibly 5159."
"2326670","2328270"," There's a little band up here as well."
"2329130","2333810"," There'll be some volatility right here and right here, of course, as we break higher. "
"2335050","2338070"," We're likely going to, hold on, back over here."
"2339590","2344570"," We're going to do, we'll do gamma together this morning so that we can take a look at it."
"2345610","2346610"," Give me one quick second. "
"2346690","2350830"," We're going to take a peek at the gamma profile of the market and see as we open up."
"2350950","2353650"," I'm going to assume here that people are buying shit tons of calls."
"2355310","2356930"," I'll put Jerome on right now. "
"2357030","2359130"," Give me a moment here and we'll put Jerome on."
"2359990","2363690"," By the way, Tesla down below is testing its hourly trigger right now."
"2363690","2364330"," If you want to see it. "
"2365990","2372150"," They had a high of 179.81. This is going to be a key moment for Tesla to see if"
"2372150","2373810"," they can get above their hourly trigger."
"2374410","2379790"," If they do get above their hourly trigger and you see a 1-5 minute, just pay attention down below."
"2379990","2380690"," You see this right here. "
"2381350","2382150"," This is Tesla."
"2382770","2390910"," If they get above their, their hourly trigger at 177.98. Watch the fuck out if you're short because"
"2390910","2392150"," we're going to blast the fuck up."
"2392830","2395790"," The target above that hourly trigger. "
"2396090","2398010"," This is where the panic sets in for sellers, right?"
"2399210","2404570"," The target above is 196.72. Let me mute this for you so you can see it."
"2406930","2408310"," You can put that away for you."
"2408370","2409070"," See that right there?"
"2409430","2411030"," Let's go down there and take a look. "
"2413690","2415370"," Here's a Tesla right now."
"2416770","2417970"," We're going to do a 30 minute."
"2422750","2424150"," I'm going to show it to you. "
"2426700","2431370"," If you break above right here, right?"
"2431510","2441250"," If you break above the hourly trigger, the target on Tesla is 196.22. 196 "
"2441250","2445470",".22. Keep your eyes on Tesla."
"2446810","2455190"," You need price to get above this 177.98. You can see supply coming in here."
"2455790","2457690"," They do not want this to happen, right?"
"2457990","2459530"," Sellers are going to be pissed. "
"2460770","2464590"," If we do break above and hold this, if you see any kind of action that is like."
"2467650","2469530"," This is actually good action right now."
"2469630","2470470"," This is not bad action. "
"2470650","2471510"," This is pretty good action here."
"2472370","2473870"," I don't ever like big squeezes."
"2473870","2483210"," I always prefer like get up here, consolidate, consolidate, consolidate, and then you get to move. "
"2484230","2485030"," It's constructive."
"2486410","2489890"," If you are a seller of Tesla, I would be a little bit weary here."
"2490090","2492390"," Not completely, but I would be a little bit weary here. "
"2492530","2496550"," As this starts to build and build and build, there's a bigger chance."
"2497090","2502950"," If we squeeze up here and then came right back down, I would expect more continuation of the"
"2502950","2503170"," downside."
"2503550","2506130"," I hate big squeezes on triggers. "
"2506710","2510310"," The more we do this and mess around that kind of stuff, focus down here."
"2510570","2512990"," It's showing to me that we're likely going there."
"2515050","2519190"," 196.22. Next thing is SPX. "
"2520010","2529590"," We're going to look at the gamma situation this morning together and find out where resistance is."
"2531250","2532050"," Right?"
"2533610","2535490"," Let me click this one right here."
"2536050","2538870"," We've got a 51.39 now. "
"2544300","2547380"," We've got gamma at massive number."
"2547960","2557620"," We're at 88.2. Gamma flip has stayed the same at 50.80."
"2559020","2572490"," Then we're going to update our levels this morning and see"
"2572490","2573250"," where we're at here."
"2575710","2580110"," Again, we're back to bring that over for you. "
"2582910","2584110"," Local resistance."
"2588900","2589800"," Hold on here."
"2591280","2592300"," Local resistance. "
"2592580","2594020"," We've got 109 million right here."
"2596380","2604120"," We've got a target once again of 51.50. You see where these sellers stepped in right here?"
"2604640","2605940"," They're going to try the same thing."
"2606760","2607980"," They're going to get angry about it. "
"2608860","2618160"," If we break above 51.50, your next target to the upside is going to be 51.75. It's got"
"2618160","2620540"," 77 million here, 5,200."
"2621820","2627360"," A little bit of resistance here at 51.70. Price target though is 5,200."
"2628800","2632920"," We break above, break above, right?"
"2633820","2634420"," Consolidate. "
"2635840","2637240"," That's our move right there."
"2637520","2638700"," That's our move right there."
"2639200","2642480"," Currently for me at least, price target 5,200. "
"2643840","2648720"," As the vol comes off the market, unless there's some kind of negative news out there."
"2649400","2651060"," Or time passes."
"2653920","2657700"," But a 5,200 price target on spoons right now. "
"2660080","2661880"," Local support right here."
"2662520","2664100"," Local resistance right here."
"2671780","2677500"," I'm going to pop that back on. "
"2677640","2678280"," Is that coming back on?"
"2678440","2679120"," There we go."
"2679580","2682360"," NYC says it lost 77 to pause the past month."
"2682640","2683400"," Slashes dividend. "
"2684680","2685920"," That's all right over there."
"2685960","2687220"," That's a doom and gloom over there."
"2687340","2687940"," So saucy. "
"2689280","2692240"," Spoons coming up to break above R2 right now."
"2693200","2694480"," Price target 5,200."
"2698260","2700460"," Probably not today, but soon. "
"2707030","2709070"," I'm going to bring up the Senate hearings for you."
"2709930","2711190"," So you can listen to it in the background."
"2712890","2722180"," A restrictive stance of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on economic activity and"
"2722180","2722480"," inflation. "
"2723800","2728280"," We believe that our policy rate is likely at its peak for this tightening cycle."
"2728860","2731420"," If the economy evolves broadly as expected."
"2732340","2737020"," It will likely be appropriate to begin dialing back policy restraint at some point this year. "
"2737800","2744120"," But the economic outlook is uncertain and ongoing progress toward our 2% inflation objective is not"
"2744120","2744480"," assured."
"2745520","2751580"," Reducing policy restraint too soon or too much could result in a reversal of progress that we've"
"2751580","2752480"," seen in inflation."
"2753200","2756980"," And ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back to 2%. "
"2757800","2763820"," At the same time, reducing policy restraint too late or too little could unduly weaken economic"
"2763820","2765040"," activity and employment."
"2765040","2771300"," In considering any adjustments to the target range for the policy rate, we will carefully assess"
"2771300","2774660"," the incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks."
"2775500","2779740"," The committee does not expect that it will be appropriate to reduce the target rate until it has"
"2779740","2785220"," gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%. "
"2786420","2791420"," We remain committed to bringing inflation back down to our 2% goal and to keeping longer term"
"2791420","2793500"," inflation expectations well anchored."
"2793500","2799220"," Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum employment and stable"
"2799220","2800840"," prices over the longer run."
"2802160","2807280"," To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families and businesses across the"
"2807280","2807620"," country. "
"2808120","2810600"," Everything we do is in service to our public mission."
"2811560","2815760"," We at the federal- Can you guys do some chat really quick so I can see if chat box"
"2815760","2816260"," is working?"
"2817120","2817800"," Thank you."
"2818040","2818740"," Thanks, Chairman. "
"2819360","2826300"," You've acknowledged the Fed likely waited too long to raise rates when prices shot up in 2021."
"2827160","2828260"," We can't make that."
"2828440","2828860"," Thanks, guys. "
"2829040","2829500"," I appreciate it."
"2829660","2833720"," Again, Mr. Chair, at the expense of workers, if the Fed waits until unemployment starts increasing,"
"2834020","2837320"," it may be too late to cut rates in time to save American jobs."
"2837960","2844240"," Why shouldn't the Fed act now to prevent workers from losing their jobs rather than reacting after"
"2844240","2844660"," the fact?"
"2845700","2851140"," So we're well aware of that risk, of course, and very conscious of avoiding it. "
"2851800","2856980"," And what we said is what we expect and what we're seeing is continued strong growth, strong labor"
"2856980","2860540"," market and continuing progress and bringing inflation down."
"2860880","2867080"," If that happens, if the economy evolves over that path, then we do think that the process of"
"2867080","2874000"," carefully removing restrictive stance of policy will can and will begin over the course of this"
"2874000","2874220"," year."
"2875040","2881340"," I mean, I know we've had this conversation publicly here privately also that you know working"
"2881340","2882640"," people are hit the hardest inflation. "
"2882780","2886420"," They're also hit the hardest when companies try to cut costs with layoffs."
"2887140","2892740"," This town too often seems to forget that maximum wealth and maximum employment is part of the Fed's"
"2892740","2893340"," dual mandate."
"2894060","2895760"," Let me ask you about bank supervision. "
"2896200","2901300"," Senator Scott mentioned that last year's bank failures illustrate the need for strong oversight."
"2901300","2906580"," SVB grew too big, too fast, Fed supervision didn't react decisively enough."
"2907380","2913700"," The Fed in response undertook an assessment of its supervisory process to identify and address gaps"
"2913700","2916320"," related to the speed, the force, the agility. "
"2917100","2918800"," That's the right word of its supervision."
"2919220","2924900"," Explain what concrete steps the Federal Reserve has taken to strengthen supervision in any specific"
"2924900","2927780"," areas where work to make improvements is ongoing."
"2927780","2931080"," So this is a very broad area of work. "
"2931540","2936640"," There are many, many people in the Federal Reserve system who are involved in supervision,"
"2936640","2937740"," thousands of them."
"2938440","2939840"," And there's a rule book."
"2940160","2945860"," And so there's been careful study and thought and a lot of listening to understand how we can meet"
"2945860","2949720"," those goals of being quicker and more effective basically is how I would say it. "
"2949800","2953800"," If you look at Silicon Valley Bank, we weren't quick enough and we weren't effective enough where"
"2953800","2954380"," we were in."
"2954380","2961820"," And so we're working hard to develop a new rule book and another set of practices, which is still"
"2961820","2967180"," going to be evidence-based and fair, but it's going to involve earlier interventions and more"
"2967180","2967760"," effective ones."
"2968120","2971440"," And I think this is work that's ongoing and will be for some time. "
"2972380","2973180"," Thank you."
"2973820","2978540"," The job of the Fed of all public officials is to serve the American people, not their stock"
"2978540","2979100"," portfolios."
"2980020","2981620"," We've seen abuses in this body. "
"2981880","2983360"," We've seen abuses in the Federal Reserve."
"2983360","2990200"," I wrote to you last month asking the Fed to identify substantive penalties for board officials who"
"2990200","2991400"," violate the trading rules."
"2992060","2993800"," Where is that in the process?"
"2994320","2999660"," And I expect these rules in place before the next monetary policy hearing in six months. "
"3000140","3000500"," Where is it?"
"3000700","3006600"," So we got our own inspector general gave us six things to work on."
"3006600","3011360"," I read the list from beginning to beginning to end and the sixth one was what you said, and I"
"3011360","3012640"," just said, we're going to do all of these."
"3012960","3013600"," Let's get going. "
"3013780","3015740"," So we've done five of them and we're working on the sixth."
"3016000","3018700"," And it will be finished within six months when you're back."
"3019040","3019580"," I want to get it right. "
"3019680","3020320"," I certainly hope so."
"3020680","3021180"," I expect so."
"3021560","3023520"," I expect so is a better answer than hope so. "
"3024900","3025860"," One last question."
"3026060","3031220"," More and more many companies use algorithms that combine competitors' price information to engage"
"3031220","3034500"," in what they call dynamic pricing or surge pricing."
"3034500","3037960"," You know that corporate PR teams worked hard on this. "
"3038440","3043240"," Just another way for corporations to make it harder for consumers to seek out lower prices and to"
"3043240","3044360"," pad corporate profits."
"3044800","3050680"," Are you concerned that the wide adoption of these price gouging strategies, these pricing schemes,"
"3051060","3052640"," if you will, will contribute to inflation?"
"3054480","3057500"," I mean, I think it works both ways."
"3057500","3060780"," You know, we're well aware of this trend, we're monitoring it. "
"3060940","3065120"," Remember that prices go down when there's no one in the store and they go up when there are a"
"3065120","3065540"," lot of people."
"3065540","3068720"," If you're doing dynamic pricing, same thing with the with the ride companies."
"3069560","3070760"," It works both ways. "
"3070900","3075200"," I don't know that have implication for, you know, for inflation, it would certainly have"
"3075200","3077240"," implications for consumers who need to be informed."
"3077980","3083800"," You think that this kind of surge pricing might lower prices overall?"
"3083800","3092520"," I mean, that's my understanding is that the idea is that in slow in slow periods, prices actually"
"3092520","3096360"," go down and in higher period in in busy periods, they go up."
"3096580","3101140"," But these are sophisticated economists working for these big companies and they're not going to do"
"3101140","3102720"," things to lower their profits. "
"3103500","3107100"," I think the price mechanism is incredibly important in our economy."
"3107100","3113720"," I think we need to give companies the freedom to do that as long as they're not fixing prices or"
"3113720","3118020"," failing to disclose the nature of the price changes to the public."
"3118340","3119500"," I have a few seconds. "
"3119720","3124380"," Research has indicated constrained supply was behind a significant amount of the inflation we've"
"3124380","3125580"," seen over the last few years."
"3126120","3130360"," If the supply chain, for instance, of autos have been more resilient or if there have been more"
"3130360","3133100"," housing availability, would that have major job easier?"
"3133960","3134440"," Yes."
"3135060","3135760"," In a word. "
"3136140","3136360"," Yeah."
"3136540","3143780"," A big part of the inflation was, and we saw it in 2023 when the supply chain problems unwound and"
"3143780","3148800"," when the when the labor supply shock that we had unwound as well, we saw inflation come down very"
"3148800","3150220"," quickly in the second half of the year."
"3150460","3155700"," But it's also down to, you know, tight monetary policies playing a role as well. "
"3155700","3163920"," Which leads me to the, to the plea with you to speak out about in reading your chat right now."
"3164080","3166680"," There are profits in green to inflation."
"3167540","3168260"," Thank you. "
"3173770","3175450"," They see you out there, hero call."
"3176610","3179690"," Well, I was just yourself agreeing with me more."
"3179830","3183350"," That would be a nightmare and I'm awake. "
"3186010","3193370"," So what I would say, however, is that the fact of the matter is that so often, if in fact"
"3193370","3194730"," 60 percent."
"3194810","3196510"," Hey, sir, asking if there's a 1030 dump."
"3197270","3197830"," Remarkable. "
"3198430","3199690"," On an event day."
"3200190","3205270"," 60% of Americans today can't afford a thousand dollar emergency."
"3206110","3210850"," I can't imagine how the average millennial affords a down payment for a home. "
"3210850","3215870"," I can't imagine how they take into consideration when they're looking at a snapshot of their"
"3215870","3216750"," financial future."
"3217750","3223930"," Fixing and repairing or having a plan for obsolescence that happens for every homeowner in the"
"3223930","3224310"," country."
"3225990","3233930"," I think the issue is far more complicated and would love to delve into that over the next four"
"3233930","3235490"," minutes and 18 seconds. "
"3236270","3243190"," But my first question is a combination between the challenges of illegal immigration and crime."
"3245030","3250490"," It seems like every single week, there's another story of another city under water attempting to"
"3250490","3256550"," feed and house millions of illegal immigrants and and American taxpayers are footing that bill."
"3256550","3264790"," Like I mentioned in my opening statement, just recently in Denver, we saw city workers having their"
"3264790","3273690"," hours essentially zeroed out so that the city can allocate more resources for the illegal"
"3273690","3276550"," immigrants in San Francisco. "
"3276550","3285630"," They say that the average cost between San Francisco and Oakland because of crime is almost four"
"3285630","3287890"," billion dollars."
"3288150","3290010"," Couple of that within the spine."
"3290010","3295010"," Now, bringing above our two trying to target by 1539. "
"3295010","3300720"," The state police price still above the one minute trigger at the same time."
"3301720","3308780"," Mayor Adams says he needs more money because the state of affairs from illegal immigrants in the"
"3308780","3317220"," city devastating the economy, scaring the citizens and reducing the opportunity for business as"
"3317220","3320400"," usual to return to New York City."
"3320400","3327340"," So my question is, can you explain how our economy is expected to continue shouldering the burden"
"3327340","3330560"," and the costs because of illegal immigration. "
"3331320","3338440"," And what if any information do you have as it relates to the impact of this surge of crime in"
"3338440","3345420"," our major cities on the economic outcomes of those cities because I heard the discussion that when"
"3345420","3346680"," you have more folks in the store."
"3347340","3352420"," You have more shoppers, except for these days, when you have more folks in the store, sometimes"
"3352420","3353920"," they're just there to steal."
"3354420","3356580"," Look at the woman sitting down behind him. "
"3356740","3359060"," She looks like she hasn't slept in like 10 days."
"3359300","3363800"," Your quote for which I thank you, but I would say right before that, what I said was immigration"
"3363800","3364580"," policy."
"3365240","3368140"," Very important, very much under discussion, and it's none of our business. "
"3368600","3371300"," We don't set immigration policy and we don't comment on it."
"3371560","3371640"," So."
"3372560","3374420"," But you commented on immigration. "
"3374920","3378420"," So my point though is that when you're going to tell a story, please tell the whole story,"
"3378440","3384000"," especially when the nation is frustrated by nearly 10 million folks by the end of this year coming"
"3384000","3390740"," to the country and having the kind of negative impact on prices on crime on the challenges that"
"3390740","3396560"," every day Americans, especially Americans living in the poorest parts of America face on a daily"
"3396560","3396940"," basis."
"3398060","3401840"," So as you accurately quoted, I was referring, I said over time."
"3402120","3404360"," So I was referring to the history, which, which with you agreed. "
"3404580","3408780"," So I wasn't, I was staying as far as I possibly could from the current political context."
"3409060","3411860"," And, you know, it's really not appropriate for us."
"3412000","3412540"," We're independent. "
"3412820","3413840"," We like to remain that way."
"3414180","3418820"," And the way we do that, one of the ways is by staying out of political issues that we, that"
"3418820","3419820"," we really aren't assigned."
"3419820","3425040"," And so the kinds of issues you're talking about are very, very real. "
"3425140","3427140"," I don't deny that, but they're really not for us."
"3427620","3433460"," So the Fed does not consider the impact of 10 million illegal immigrants coming to our country and"
"3433460","3435400"," the costs associated with those illegal immigrants."
"3435400","3441860"," Nor did they consider the impact on states like New York or California or Illinois where the"
"3441860","3445760"," devastation of crime ravishing the poorest Americans has an impact. "
"3446160","3447640"," We don't, we'll take that into consideration."
"3447980","3448840"," So we, you know, we do."
"3449320","3451160"," And so does the Congressional Budget Office. "
"3451160","3456200"," We do try to estimate population and we try to estimate the effective immigration legal or illegal"
"3456200","3458420"," on the size of the workforce and on GDP."
"3458660","3463180"," If you look at the Congressional Budget Office as you probably know, a detailed assessment of all"
"3463180","3463940"," the things like that."
"3463940","3465520"," We don't really have a way. "
"3465880","3469800"," And we do look at the finances in the aggregate of state and local governments."
"3469820","3471320"," That's in the hiring that they do."
"3471800","3476140"," So that's something we look at, but we wouldn't do a very specific assessment like that. "
"3476260","3478840"," I mean, CBO would probably would, but we wouldn't do that."
"3479080","3479520"," Thank you."
"3481940","3485080"," This is Scott Senator Hernandez of New Jersey's recognized. "
"3485600","3486260"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"3486540","3491040"," Before I begin my question is I want to celebrate that in the past year, we have seen the first"
"3491040","3493220"," Latino federal reserve governor."
"3493220","3496980"," And the first ever Latino federal reserve bank president. "
"3497420","3502020"," These are historic milestones that show we are finally making progress, something that I have been"
"3502020","3508400"," at for quite some time to the leadership of our economic institutions."
"3509100","3511000"," So I want to applaud that."
"3511840","3516560"," And Mr. Chairman, I hope that progress can continue and extend to the rest of the federal reserve"
"3516560","3517040"," staff. "
"3517900","3518640"," Thank you."
"3518640","3526840"," I agree with my friend, the ranking member, that when you tell a story, you should tell the whole"
"3526840","3527220"," story."
"3528400","3537080"," Mr. Chairman, are you aware of the Washington Post's February 27th article that says the economy is"
"3537080","3540260"," roaring and immigration is a key reason?"
"3541520","3543400"," I don't recall that, but I would have read it. "
"3543540","3544340"," Let me read it to you."
"3545180","3551900"," Immigration has propelled the US job market further than just about anyone expected, helping cement"
"3551900","3558040"," the country's economic rebound from the pandemic as the most robust in the world."
"3558840","3566160"," It goes on to say, economists and labor experts say the surge in employment was ultimately key to"
"3566160","3572120"," solving unprecedented gaps in the economy that threatened the country's ability to recover from"
"3572120","3573660"," prolonged shutdowns. "
"3574160","3576580"," Would you take issue with those statements?"
"3577320","3582000"," You know, there are a lot of adjectives and adverbs in there that you wouldn't see in Fed World,"
"3582440","3585740"," but the take out the adjectives and give them the story."
"3585940","3589680"," The story is, I think, broadly, this."
"3590300","3593180"," It is that spine now squeezing higher to five. "
"3593240","3598800"," There are five that were above R2 right now with a target to the upside of 51539."
"3599580","3605720"," A lot of Twitter sentiment right now is put buying just the heads up out there."
"3605820","3610980"," There are lots, lots of hedging going on from retail right now. "
"3611160","3617700"," A lot of growth, wages were coming down, the economy is bigger, and those are probably going to get"
"3617700","3619040"," run the fuck over, by the way."
"3619200","3623080"," This is without making any judgments on immigration or immigration policy, but I think that's an"
"3623080","3623800"," odd fact."
"3623800","3628300"," I'm just suggesting that the facts are that we had 10 or 11 million jobs that were going"
"3628300","3629760"," unfulfilled in our economy. "
"3630600","3634820"," They lacked the productivity that is necessary for success economically."
"3635800","3644800"," And as part of that, clearly, immigration helped fuel part of our revival coming out of the"
"3644800","3645380"," pandemic."
"3645620","3649240"," In fact, those were the people who were the essential workers when the rest of us were staying"
"3649240","3649500"," home. "
"3649500","3654700"," So I agree we need to do what is necessary to have a regularized border."
"3655160","3664680"," But I also think that just to create the context of immigration as a scourge is absolutely wrong."
"3665100","3666200"," Let me turn to another question. "
"3666400","3671680"," In my view, the sticky inflation we've been seeing in the housing sector is principally due to the"
"3671680","3673940"," massive nationwide housing shortage."
"3673940","3677840"," The Fed's monetary policy report attributes the shortage to restrict."
"3677960","3684100"," Just a warning out there, if you're watching, I want you to pay attention to that list underfunding"
"3684100","3686580"," of the screener that we're coming in. "
"3686720","3689820"," If you want to look at that screener up there, I will go in the wrong way."
"3691120","3691640"," Shit."
"3691860","3694600"," The top screen, okay. "
"3694860","3700120"," In that corner, I want you to watch that we're coming into 5150 right now."
"3700120","3701820"," Let's be aware of it."
"3702020","3703460"," And middle-income Americans. "
"3704060","3706420"," According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition."
"3706600","3711100"," This is the same place that sellers came into before."
"3711460","3719800"," In New Jersey, we'd have to work two full-time jobs to afford a modest one-bedroom rental home at"
"3719800","3720540"," fair market rent. "
"3721340","3725480"," Do you agree that increasingly unaffordable housing is a problem for the economy?"
"3725480","3727540"," I think there are two things going on."
"3727720","3732160"," One is a longer-term housing shortage and the other is the pandemic effects and the associated"
"3732160","3734980"," higher interest rates, which are things that will pass through."
"3735360","3739420"," When all that passes through and rates are normalized, we'll still have the underlying housing"
"3739420","3739900"," shortage. "
"3740620","3743420"," And it's going to be causing upward pressure on housing prices."
"3744020","3749400"," Now, the monetary policy report noted that quote home purchases by low-income households have"
"3749400","3754740"," fallen disproportionately more because mortgage lenders impose maximums on the ratio of a"
"3754740","3756940"," borrower's debt service payments to the borrower's income."
"3757720","3762620"," I'm worried about how this dynamic will interact with the recently proposed capital requirements"
"3762620","3768000"," proposal, which according to analysis from the Urban Institute would disproportionately increase"
"3768000","3773120"," the cost of mortgages for black, Hispanic and low-income moderate borrowers. "
"3773120","3779800"," Given this, isn't there a risk that if the capital rules implemented without changes, that it could"
"3779800","3783920"," make it even harder for disadvantaged borrowers to attain home ownership?"
"3784280","3786580"," There is a risk like that and we're very focused on it."
"3786720","3788500"," And hopefully you're working to mitigate it."
"3789060","3789340"," Yes. "
"3789740","3790000"," Thank you."
"3790080","3790580"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"3791160","3791820"," Thanks, Chairman. "
"3793020","3794900"," Senator Rounds from South Dakota."
"3795440","3796440"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"3797120","3798560"," Chairman Powell, welcome back. "
"3799280","3804640"," Look, first of all, I've appreciated the way that you've approached the discussions in front of"
"3804640","3805320"," this committee."
"3805780","3812220"," And I understand your desire to stay as neutral as possible with regard to the politics involved in"
"3812220","3813040"," an election year."
"3813780","3817960"," But I do have some questions here specifically with regard to the Basel 3N game proposal. "
"3819060","3827140"," An analysis of that proposal found that 97% were either opposing it or expressing substantial"
"3827140","3827560"," concerns."
"3828320","3834440"," In the hearing last March on the monetary policy report, you stated that the Federal Reserve is a"
"3834440","3840380"," consensus organization, and you said, and I quote, I will do everything I can possibly to do."
"3840600","3848360"," I will do everything I can possibly to bring people together in consensus and have a capital"
"3848360","3851260"," framework that could be broadly supported. "
"3851980","3857280"," My question to that is, do you currently believe that there is a consensus on this capital"
"3857280","3857720"," framework?"
"3858700","3860280"," I believe that we will have one."
"3860600","3865460"," I'm fairly confident that we will have such a consensus when we do move forward."
"3865880","3871100"," So we could expect that you will probably not call a vote on the proposal until you believe that"
"3871100","3871720"," there is a consensus. "
"3873380","3874420"," I think that's right."
"3874540","3879100"," I mean, we're just in the process of digesting the comments and then making the appropriate"
"3879100","3879600"," changes."
"3879600","3880760"," Thank you. "
"3881440","3887680"," As you are aware, I've waited several times on the concerns that I have with regard to Basel 3N"
"3887680","3895060"," game, including I'm concerned about the lack of transparency, the negative effects on mortgage"
"3895060","3902320"," lending and home affordability by disincentivizing banks from offering high loan to value loans"
"3902320","3907500"," that primarily help first time home buyers and low to moderate income borrowers."
"3907500","3913420"," I'm concerned that the proposal will make buying a home harder than it already is for many."
"3913900","3918780"," And further down the road, I fear that it could disincentivize mortgage lending from the largest"
"3918780","3924220"," banks, particularly with regard to the secondary market and their impact on even smaller banks that"
"3924220","3925140"," do business with them. "
"3925780","3932080"," Would you be willing to withdraw the proposal or repropose with significant modifications,"
"3933160","3937900"," particularly addressing the concerns that I and others have on this committee raising specifically"
"3937900","3939160"," with regard to the impact?"
"3939360","3943860"," And I'm thinking of Freddie and Fannie in particular and what the impact might be."
"3945160","3948840"," What would you see as the process involving those particular issues?"
"3949360","3953600"," So on those issues we're well aware of and very focused on those issues."
"3954600","3958060"," We haven't decided what to do about that yet, but we get it on those issues. "
"3958060","3961360"," In terms of process, we're not at the stage of making that decision."
"3961820","3966780"," I will say, if it turns out to be appropriate, when we get to that point for us to repropose"
"3966780","3970700"," parts over all of the thing, then we won't hesitate to do so."
"3971060","3971460"," Okay. "
"3971660","3971980"," Thank you."
"3972420","3976880"," Makes me feel a little bit better because I do think there are some very serious problems that work"
"3976880","3977160"," here."
"3977540","3981980"," If the Basel three in game as proposed goes into effect and I most certainly am hoping that the"
"3981980","3984580"," Federal Reserve will find a consensus on this. "
"3984580","3990200"," And it sounds like that may very well include some significant modifications if it were to be"
"3990200","3990660"," brought at all."
"3990780","3991500"," Is that a fair statement?"
"3992100","3997780"," I expect there will be material and broad changes to the proposal before it comes back to the"
"3997780","3998640"," committee for consideration."
"3999380","4000460"," The board for consideration. "
"4001080","4001860"," Thank you, sir."
"4003360","4011180"," Let's just with regard to the economy today, a limited level of price growth is believed to help"
"4011180","4016920"," facilitate economic expansion, reduce the risk of recession and help businesses and consumers plan."
"4017680","4024080"," However, during the Biden administration, we saw inflation climb to 13% and those prices are now"
"4024080","4024940"," the new norm. "
"4025500","4032380"," I know that you make it a policy not to comment on the administration's fiscal policy, but it is"
"4032380","4039680"," well known that I really do believe that high inflation high prices have been a direct result of"
"4039680","4041680"," President Biden's policies."
"4041680","4049540"," Failed in many cases that the Federal Reserve has limited tools to address some of the problems"
"4049540","4050760"," that these policies created."
"4051420","4055040"," We talk about supply side versus demand side on these costs. "
"4056140","4061940"," What have been some of the unintended consequences from raising the federal funds rate as rapidly"
"4061940","4065920"," as you felt that you had to as the chair and as the committee?"
"4066560","4067480"," What are some of those?"
"4067600","4072160"," I know that we talked a little bit about SVP and the failure there, their inability to look at"
"4072160","4075220"," treasuries and the increasing interest rates and so forth."
"4075400","4079540"," But can you talk a little bit about some of the things that you've seen that were negative with"
"4079540","4082280"," regard to trying to respond to those high inflation?"
"4082580","4082980"," Yes."
"4083400","4086380"," So high interest rates are hard for businesses. "
"4086380","4087440"," They're hard for people."
"4088020","4093760"," They're the thing that they're the tool that we have to use to bring inflation down."
"4093760","4099740"," And our job at this time, when high inflation comes, it is the Fed's job to restore price"
"4099740","4101260"," stability, and that's what we're doing. "
"4101640","4103380"," You point to the losses in banks."
"4104319","4106160"," That was a very substantial thing."
"4106560","4111939"," And obviously the supervisors and that was us, you know, didn't didn't get to that problem. "
"4111979","4114700"," We were aware of it, but we didn't probably appreciate it enough."
"4115040","4120580"," Another surprise though, is that we were able to get this far and get inflation down this quickly"
"4120580","4123080"," without seeing a big increase in unemployment."
"4123080","4124859"," And that's just a great result. "
"4125080","4127260"," That's just a surprise."
"4127439","4130720"," It's not consistent with the historical record, but it's a really positive thing."
"4131040","4131740"," But thank you. "
"4131740","4134819"," And I would just know the only tools you had available were demand side tools."
"4135240","4135359"," Yeah."
"4135840","4136200"," That's right. "
"4136260","4136560"," Thank you."
"4136680","4137560"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"4137760","4138060"," Thank you. "
"4138180","4139939"," Senator Warner, Virginia's recognized."
"4140460","4142080"," Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman Powell."
"4142140","4142899"," It's great to see you. "
"4144840","4147380"," I would point out to my good friend from South Dakota."
"4148200","4156160"," I do think, you know, if we'd gone back a year to 18 months ago, nobody would have predicted the"
"4156160","4156660"," soft landing."
"4157640","4162420"," And I know you're not ready to declare victory by any means, but the fact that inflation has come"
"4162420","4162540"," down. "
"4162640","4166920"," I actually think some of the things like the chips bill, the infrastructure bill and some of"
"4166920","4172180"," President Biden's policies have actually kept the economy growth rate at the levels."
"4172680","4180760"," That have allowed you to bring down inflation without seeing a dramatic rise in unemployment."
"4181040","4185779"," And again, that'll be something we'll probably have the opportunity to litigate over the next eight"
"4185779","4186300"," or nine months. "
"4187220","4194020"," I want to take my time on issues around less about monetary policy and more about regulation."
"4194520","4200120"," You know, I think you can never presume that we're out of the woods on financial stability, as we"
"4200120","4204220"," saw with the New York Community Bank yesterday, the stock plunge and the capital infusion."
"4205880","4209860"," You know, one area that I raised with you a year ago, I want to re-raise today. "
"4210440","4218360"," And that is non-bank lending, the fact that non-bank lending in terms of to non-financial firms now"
"4218360","4221740"," is actually exceeding regulated bank lending."
"4221740","4226480"," And let me be clear, I've got, you know, the non-bank financial sector has done productive things"
"4226480","4229060"," in our society over the years."
"4229680","4238720"," But when folks like former New York Fed President Dudley and former Governor Grozner recently said"
"4238720","4245100"," that they had worries about this reliance on the non-bank financial sector could lead to overall"
"4245100","4246600"," economic lack of stability, I guess. "
"4248620","4253260"," What do you think, I've got a three-part question, what do you think are the risks as we see"
"4253260","4260000"," this push out effect of more and more lending going outside the regulated permit to the non-bank"
"4260000","4260820"," sector?"
"4263260","4265580"," How much do we really know about these institutions?"
"4265900","4274120"," And one of the things they have very smart sophisticated investors, one of those very smart"
"4274120","4278740"," sophisticated investors said, well, hey, we don't like the lending profile right now, and we want"
"4278740","4281700"," you not make any additional loans for the next six to nine months."
"4282880","4285420"," Do you think our system would be able to pick up the slack?"
"4288940","4293440"," So, we have the regulated banking system where you've got a lot of transparency, you've got deposit"
"4293440","4299160"," insurance, you've got access to the discount window and all those things, regulation."
"4299160","4304300"," If you go outside that, most of the funding that we see now in these vehicles is sophisticated"
"4304300","4309000"," investors who are actually limited partners, meaning they can't pull their money out, they've"
"4309000","4311160"," signed a contract, they've funded these deals. "
"4311980","4318860"," And so, what you see now in the non-bank financial sector is significantly, it's that kind of"
"4318860","4319000"," thing."
"4319100","4320620"," So, it doesn't have the run risk."
"4320620","4326460"," The point is the bigger it grows and the more diverse it gets, it is happening outside the"
"4326460","4332960"," regulatory perimeter, and you worry that when there is another crisis, you'll be surprised, but"
"4332960","4338320"," there will be ways that that financial structure too can break down, and it does break down in ways"
"4338320","4339000"," we don't anticipate. "
"4339420","4345940"," So, I think we need to be smart about the way, about intermediation is absolutely moving out of the"
"4345940","4348800"," banks into the capital markets and into non-bank financial institutions."
"4348800","4351620"," That's what's been happening for a long, long time."
"4351960","4355520"," I just think we need to be thoughtful about understanding where the risks are emerging. "
"4355700","4360760"," And that sophisticated investor may rightfully say, hey, we don't want you to lend anymore for an"
"4360760","4367920"," extra period of time, but that may then at that moment of crisis mean that the lending capabilities"
"4367920","4369080"," completely dry up."
"4369080","4373080"," And one of the things I never completely understood, until I got a little better explanation"
"4373080","4379740"," recently, why the large regulated banks weren't more complaining about this non-bank lending, but"
"4379740","4382060"," I, as I got to understand a little bit more of them."
"4383060","4389220"," And again, I'm not per se criticizing on the non-bank lending, but many of the regulated banks"
"4389220","4390760"," actually lend to these large institutions. "
"4390760","4394440"," So they make, you know, they make money off of those relationships."
"4394720","4398360"," And maybe that's again an explanation of why they're not being more, more critical."
"4398740","4403080"," I only got 40 seconds left, but I would like to come back to another thing that we've talked about"
"4403080","4403400"," a lot. "
"4405400","4408440"," And that is the question of use of the discount window."
"4409760","4412880"," I believe one of the original tools that the Fed had."
"4412880","4417300"," I know banks say, well, we're concerned about the stigma. "
"4417520","4423640"," I've got some legislation that would actually require mandatory use of the discount window."
"4423660","4424840"," I'd love your comment on that."
"4425240","4431620"," And also just the idea that having the mechanics of the discount window open, potentially even 24"
"4431620","4433000"," seven, because we saw it. "
"4439500","4441960"," There's a lot of work to do on the discount window."
"4442200","4443000"," You're absolutely right."
"4443460","4446280"," It needs to be brought up technologically into the modern age. "
"4446820","4449420"," We need to do more to eliminate the stigma problem."
"4449800","4454760"," And we need to make sure that that banks are actually able to use it when they need to use"
"4454760","4454900"," it."
"4455180","4461040"," And, you know, those things, that's a broad work program that we're on right now. "
"4461040","4462740"," And it's very important."
"4463000","4466340"," I know you're working on it, but I would look forward to working more, and I'd invite other"
"4466340","4466720"," colleagues."
"4466920","4473240"," I really do think before we started adding a whole host of other regulatory issues, we ought to use"
"4473240","4474440"," some of the tools that are out there. "
"4477330","4478050"," You're not gone."
"4478550","4481710"," So, God, I expected that the veterans committee center tell us North Carolina."
"4482070","4482430"," Thank you, Mark. "
"4482910","4484710"," I was about to take control of Senator Warner."
"4487510","4490270"," Welcome, Chair Powell and Gus sends his regards."
"4490590","4492610"," If you have time after the hearing, you ought to go by and see him. "
"4492750","4495850"," He's a dog in our office, but I don't want to disturb his nap."
"4496210","4498790"," But thank you for being here."
"4498910","4501610"," I want to get back on his Basel three proposals. "
"4501710","4507790"," Senators, Lomas, Coons, Joe, Brandon, and I sent a letter indicating our concerns with the current"
"4507790","4508270"," proposal."
"4508270","4513770"," But I think it's also worth noting that the number of other organizations, a diverse group that are"
"4513770","4515810"," not normally aligned on policy."
"4516090","4522910"," You got bank trades, national housing conference, NAACP, Habitat for Humanity, National Community"
"4522910","4525050"," Reinvestment Coalition, the list goes on. "
"4525590","4527750"," Who have concerns with the current proposal?"
"4528690","4529670"," Here's my concern."
"4531170","4537110"," I think we're trying to make the best of what was foundationally a bad proposal."
"4537770","4545950"," And so I'm in the category of people who think that it should be repoposed, because I think one of"
"4545950","4551690"," the reasons why I did not support Mr. Barr's nomination is I felt like we were going to be here. "
"4551690","4556510"," I mean, it was pretty clear to me before he ever got confirmed on the board that we were going"
"4556510","4559410"," to be in this place some months or years later."
"4559950","4560810"," And here we are."
"4561270","4564090"," And I think that the industry felt the same way. "
"4564330","4568230"," All of these stakeholders, some of them earned banking trades, some of them are on the other side"
"4568230","4569610"," of the spectrum."
"4569610","4576690"," So I'd like to cast my vote or provide some weight to the idea that we should repropose it."
"4576930","4583010"," And what we ought to do is talk about the reality of increasing capital or the prospect of"
"4583010","4585350"," increasing capital requirements doesn't concern me. "
"4585550","4592950"," I think the prior Fed supervisor had made comments publicly that maybe we needed to raise capital"
"4592950","4593290"," standards."
"4593290","4598550"," But what we did here in this proposal, and I heard in that dialogue, is let's deal with puts and"
"4598550","4598850"," takes."
"4599430","4606190"," Let's talk about raising capital requirements, but let's also talk about reducing the cost of the"
"4606190","4608290"," regulatory burden today if we can do it responsibly. "
"4608930","4612070"," There's no evidence of that in the current proposal."
"4612410","4617550"," And I think that that may actually produce a different set of comments that would be instructive to"
"4617550","4622410"," a final proposal that I think realistically will include some increasing capital requirements."
"4622410","4630170"," So over what time horizon do you think we would expect either see, try to make the best of this"
"4630170","4635630"," foundation or go back and take a look at it at a new foundation and repropose it. "
"4636730","4640170"," You know, we're going to work through it as quickly as we can and should."
"4640430","4643350"," I will say it's more important to get it right than it is to do it fast."
"4643650","4644270"," We're not in a hurry. "
"4645690","4649830"," But my guess is we'll work this out over the course of this year."
"4650190","4650270"," Yeah."
"4650730","4656330"," Well, you know, if you take a look at the outsized cost of operational risk, the long list of"
"4656330","4663130"," concerns that I publicly and privately expressed on the current proposal, I do think sometimes it's"
"4663130","4665270"," easier to knock down. "
"4666110","4668990"," What I think is a poor foundation and build a better house."
"4669330","4672570"," So again, just wanted to make that comment publicly."
"4673030","4674590"," I got a question about shrinkflation. "
"4674590","4679550"," I tell you some of these words that we come up with, but President Biden's using the idea of"
"4679550","4679750"," shrink."
"4680190","4688150"," Flation and you know, chastising manufacturers for creating smaller portion sizes for potato chips."
"4688150","4689590"," I'll use that as one example. "
"4689850","4694430"," But if you have rising input cost."
"4694430","4700410"," So you can see right now that we are breaking above you're not able to control the local resistance"
"4700410","4701990"," of 5150."
"4702130","4703130"," The target to the upside"
"4703130","4723870"," can't"
"4723870","4724130"," even reduce. "
"4724830","4731170"," We saw as we were heading up into 5150, we did not have an immediate rejection 21 at 18%"
"4731170","4732050"," over 11 years."
"4732470","4736110"," And over the last three years, we've seen it at 21%."
"4736110","4742970"," Price target on spy itself is 51539 industry that's trying to actually provide products that that"
"4742970","4743810"," consumers want. "
"4743810","4748510"," And now they're being chastised for trying to figure out 14 C's about on them anymore."
"4748590","4749570"," But we were on them yesterday."
"4749950","4751350"," They were 20 cents. "
"4751690","4754450"," They're now trading a dollar for the record."
"4754450","4757050"," I want to say on 44 right now dollar 44."
"4757570","4758150"," I have a question. "
"4758370","4763590"," I think the chair mentioned, and if I misunderstood this, I'm sure the chair will clarify, but I"
"4763590","4770190"," thought in his opening comments, he he suggested that stock buybacks and paying out dividends were"
"4770190","4770810"," a key factor."
"4770810","4773570"," Test off 0.83 right now."
"4773710","4778470"," Policy C stock buybacks and dividends is one of the top five reasons we're experiencing the"
"4778470","4779590"," inflation we have right now. "
"4780690","4785050"," First, I guess I see stuck buybacks and dividends is just the same thing in a different form."
"4785590","4786530"," And I don't know."
"4786710","4789610"," I wouldn't comment on anything that your even may have said it. "
"4790490","4791930"," I'd like to avoid that."
"4791950","4796390"," I don't think I'm not going to ask you about policy because I think you're consistent on that."
"4796630","4803150"," But I just can't imagine that if we decided to outlaw a stock buybacks and dividend payments, that"
"4803150","4805930"," would have a material effect on inflation. "
"4806410","4808630"," So I'm not going to ask you to respond to that."
"4808710","4810270"," But there are some people that buy inference."
"4810630","4813250"," You can you could assume that that's that they think that that would be helpful. "
"4813250","4817590"," I just for one, I'm not an economist, but I just can't imagine that it would be, you know, one"
"4817590","4818990"," of the things that would make your job easier."
"4819270","4820570"," Can you at least open on that?"
"4821550","4823310"," Banning stock buybacks and dividends."
"4823430","4823830"," Yeah. "
"4824110","4824110"," Yeah."
"4824190","4826750"," I think that would be quite a change in our capital markets."
"4827170","4827310"," Yeah. "
"4827450","4827930"," Me too."
"4828150","4828630"," I mean, shareholders."
"4829090","4832590"," This is just money going back to shareholders from company that have nothing to do with it. "
"4832730","4832970"," Okay."
"4833170","4840610"," Thank you, Mr. Chair."
"4840610","4845050"," If you are a bull, you want to see see this yellow box right here. "
"4845190","4848070"," You want to see this yellow box become support right here."
"4848490","4850950"," So about 514 18 on spy."
"4851370","4857450"," You have well pointed out overall prices have moderated considerably since the Fed began raising"
"4857450","4864630"," rates, yet housing costs have remained stubbornly resilient or high, leaving us really no closer to"
"4864630","4867430"," addressing the affordability crisis that I think that we have. "
"4867430","4869670"," And this was it was there well before the pandemic."
"4870710","4874970"," Shortly before the Fed began tightening chair Powell and you came before the committee."
"4875230","4881610"," I asked you about how higher interest rates could exacerbate this unaffordability problem that we"
"4881610","4885390"," have by making mortgages more expensive and also hindering housing development. "
"4885650","4890310"," And I think that at the time you argued that we have a excess housing demand during the pandemic"
"4890310","4894790"," and that was kind of at the root of higher costs and that your goal, the Fed's goal was to"
"4894790","4897470"," bring demand closer in line with supply."
"4898270","4900210"," So my question, my first question is this."
"4900650","4904850"," So the housing market has cooled significantly over the last two years. "
"4905090","4911890"," Is it your view that we it is cooled enough so that housing supply and demand is better in balance"
"4911890","4912490"," and."
"4913470","4919810"," Following in that, you know, given the feds limited tools understanding that at what point do you"
"4919810","4923170"," think that you've done all that you can to lower housing demand."
"4923810","4929950"," My view is that we're well past time in Congress to take action on the housing supply side, but I'm"
"4929950","4931590"," interested in how you see this dynamic. "
"4932050","4935830"," So we're not, you know, we're not focused so much on housing and housing inflation."
"4936150","4939630"," We're really focused on the aggregate, which is also goods and not housing services."
"4939630","4942230"," That's that's way more than half of the PCE inflation. "
"4942830","4947810"," The thing there are things in the housing sector that that we didn't fully anticipate."
"4947810","4953890"," One of them was one of them just was that people in very low interest rate homes with very low"
"4953890","4955750"," interest rate mortgages aren't selling."
"4956110","4959050"," So the quantity of homes that's available is incredibly low. "
"4959170","4965030"," And that's why it's very little in the way of existing home sales and that drives up existing home"
"4965030","4967450"," sale prices, but also new home sale prices."
"4967450","4972890"," So that again, there's two sets of factors that the longer run issue, but then there's the factors"
"4972890","4977070"," associated with the pandemic and the inflation and our response to it."
"4977410","4983830"," I think as the overall inflation continues to come down and rates then come down, you'll see the"
"4983830","4989150"," housing markets start to heal and get better and housing affordability should go up again, but"
"4989150","4992350"," you're still going to be left with with with the longer term problem of supply. "
"4992350","4993250"," Right, right."
"4993510","4994930"," I think that's right."
"4995070","5000590"," I mean, what I see in Minnesota is that higher interest rates are, of course, driving up the cost"
"5000590","5000950"," of construction. "
"5001590","5004370"," They're driving up the cost of mortgage rates."
"5004570","5008090"," You're seeing people who aren't leaving a house that maybe is a little too small for them because"
"5008090","5013050"," they can't afford it that the housing just as you're saying, people are staying in there and their"
"5013050","5013770"," homes longer."
"5013770","5021550"," And so there's sort of this double whammy of construction slowing at the same time that there is"
"5021550","5024510"," this great need to address housing supply. "
"5025130","5030950"," One of the things that is happening, it's interesting, a recent analysis by Zillow found that the"
"5030950","5032390"," monthly mortgage payment."
"5033490","5039650"," On a, on a, on a, let me get this right, a recent analysis by Zillow found that the monthly"
"5039650","5047790"," mortgage payment on a home on a $343,000 home, assuming 10% down payment is about $2,200 a"
"5047790","5047970"," month."
"5048190","5050270"," Okay, so $2,200 a month. "
"5050450","5057550"," That means the cost of owning a typical home is higher than 30% of median income, which is kind"
"5057550","5058710"," of the measure of affordability."
"5059270","5064890"," And so we've got a lot of issues with people just being priced out of the home of the housing"
"5064890","5065210"," market."
"5066090","5073370"," So from where I sit, the cumulative issues of higher mortgage mortgage rates are just really a"
"5073370","5073910"," challenge. "
"5074070","5082130"," And until we can get to the bottom of that, we're going to have a hard time addressing the housing"
"5082130","5083790"," affordability challenge that we have."
"5083790","5086710"," So I think your eyes on this action, this price action right here."
"5086850","5091190"," I mean, we don't actually home prices don't actually want to see this hold right here. "
"5091290","5095830"," It's really rents and owners equivalent rent, but I'll leave it up here as well."
"5096070","5098010"," Here's the gamma very very difficult situation."
"5098310","5103550"," And, you know, the sooner we can get back to price stability and restore interest rates to lower"
"5103550","5105590"," levels, the sooner it can start healing. "
"5105590","5106250"," Yep."
"5107030","5107350"," Thank you."
"5107430","5108110"," Thank you, Mr. Chair. "
"5108970","5112350"," To make that smaller because of the Kennedy of Louisiana."
"5112850","5115050"," I want to show this to you guys and you can see it."
"5115230","5116550"," Chairman, thank you for being here. "
"5116690","5117710"," Thank you for your services."
"5117710","5120230"," I think I've said before."
"5121730","5128750"," I believe you and your team probably saved the world economy during the pandemic economic meltdown. "
"5128750","5135570"," Say a louder when the whole world wanted dollars by establishing the currency swap line."
"5135590","5136630"," So I thank you for that."
"5137070","5145370"," You gave an interview, Mr. Chairman on February 4th of this year to CBS 60 minutes, I think. "
"5145950","5146670"," Is that right?"
"5147030","5147230"," Yep."
"5147570","5147890"," That's right."
"5148050","5150490"," They printed digitally, baby. "
"5150630","5151930"," I learned a lot reading it."
"5155350","5159230"," You were you were asked a question about inflation."
"5159810","5161230"," Did we print it digitally?"
"5161890","5163170"," You asked a question. "
"5163570","5164750"," Say that in the chat."

"5179480","5184390"," But we don't expect to see a decline in the overall price level. "
"5185130","5188290"," That doesn't tend to happen in economies."

"6104480","6110120"," Powell given what actually happened with the banking sector with SVB in First Republic I just"
"6110120","6114440"," encourage you guys not to apply a regulation that doesn't actually solve the underlying problem my"
"6114440","6118380"," fear that if you apply this to banks of a hundred billion dollars and above you actually are doing"

"6141340","6146940"," for strong employment and stable prices is critical for small businesses on Main Street for farmers"
"6146940","6154820"," for ranchers for Montana families you follow all the metrics from your perspective where is the"
"6154820","6162440"," economy at now and where's it going you know the economy is growing at a healthy sustainable solid"
"6162440","6169300"," strong pace and that's that's one thing second thing I'd say is the labor market is very strong and"
"6169300","6176320"," and quite tight still 3% 3.7% unemployment for the last 24 months that's the longest period since"
"6176320","6183200"," you know 50 years and the third thing is inflation inflation was too high it's come down very"
"6183200","6188380"," sharply since the beginning of last year if you look at the 12 month number the headline number has"
"6188380","6194940"," come down from the fives down to 2.4 and the the core number is at 2.8 I think"
"6194940","6200160"," it was at 4.9 a year ago so these are big declines so we're in a very different place"
"6200160","6204620"," and a healthy place we are going to use our tools to try to keep that strong economy keep that"
"6204620","6209460"," strong labor market while we continue to make progress on inflation one of the areas where there"
"6209460","6216380"," has been inflation and I don't exactly know where it's at now but food rose quite rapidly and by"
"6216380","6220620"," the way I'm a farmer we didn't get much of that in fact we didn't get any of it prices"
"6220620","6227920"," now compared to what they were a year ago are actually off compared to where they're six years ago"
"6227920","6232820"," they're up but compared to where the year ago they're down and so my question to you Chairman"
"6232820","6239660"," Powell is there anything you can do specifically to deal with food costs so as you bet I'm telling"
"6239660","6244840"," a farmer is business but if you look at the food cost to the consumer part of that is commodity"
"6244840","6251340"," costs and that was partly spiked as you know because of Ukraine grains and oil and that kind of"
"6251340","6256000"," thing but the rest of it is a lot of costs in the supply chain from when it leaves the"
"6256000","6262540"," farm to get you know collected and processed and trucked around and then put on the shelves and"
"6262540","6267960"," then the stores you know and all those costs are just part of the general economy so as the labor"
"6267960","6274180"," market pulls off from its overheated status two years ago you will see and you have seen you know"
"6274180","6279700"," food inflation flattening out and so that you know the really high rates of inflation have come"
"6279700","6286420"," down the prices of course if not correct I would I would just say that it cattle's doing better"
"6286420","6291900"," grain actually has dropped in price at the farm gate and I don't want to get into that debate with"
"6291900","6297120"," you at all because we probably agree but it take too long take too much time we've got other stuff"
"6297120","6302880"," to talk about learning from you you've discussed in previous hearings the impacts of the pandemic"
"6302880","6311120"," shutdowns and supply chain issues have had on economies globally how does the US economy look today"
"6311120","6319160"," compared to our competitor nations particularly China why I start with the advanced economies you"
"6319160","6324020"," know we're doing the best of anybody we've got the strongest growth and the lowest inflation of the"
"6324020","6328520"," advanced economies China is a whole different story China's having you know significant"
"6328520","6333800"," difficulties with its economy right now and they're in a very different place that then certainly"
"6333800","6343360"," we are and so to repeat that what I heard you say is the economy of the United States is"
"6343360","6348800"," basically in better shape than any other economy in the world any other major economy yes yes okay"
"6348800","6354680"," look one of the other challenges out there is housing in communities all across this country"
"6354680","6361400"," whether you're in Montana whether you're in a city in Ohio how workforce housing in particular is a"
"6361400","6369240"," top a top priority top commodity so to speak plenty of folks great organizations are working to"
"6369240","6373900"," address this I meet them every day and I appreciate the work they're doing but how do these housing"
"6373900","6382700"," supplies issues show up in the data that the FOMC uses to make decisions so housing prices don't go"
"6382700","6388180"," into the data housing starts and renovations and things like that are just business activity and"
"6388180","6395360"," that shows up but when it comes to inflation we're you know we convert ownership into an imputed"
"6395360","6399700"," rent and then we look at rents and so we look at that's how we look at all that so"
"6399700","6405300"," we're not if we're not directly affected by by changes in housing prices but over time those will"
"6405300","6410400"," those will drive rents up so so is it fair to ask are there economic trends that you see for"
"6410400","6417040"," housing yes so I there's two big things going on one is we had this underlying shortage of housing"
"6417040","6423620"," and it's due to things like difficulties of zoning a lot of the close into cities places are"
"6423620","6428720"," already built and so more difficult to get zoning more difficult to get people and materials and"
"6428720","6433100"," all that that's one thing and that's not going away then there's just a ton of things happening"
"6433100","6438320"," because of the pandemic because of inflation because of higher rates and those are in short in the"
"6438320","6444020"," short term those have really they're weighing on the housing market but as rates come down and that"
"6444020","6448800"," all goes through the economy we're still going to be back to a place where we don't have enough"
"6448800","6454400"," housing well once again thank you Chairman Powell for your work I very much appreciate it thank you"
"6454400","6459840"," chairman thanks Senator Chester or Senator Kramer of North Dakota thank you Mr. Chairman Chairman"
"6459840","6463980"," Paul good to see you thank you for being here it's been a rather uneventful couple of days for you"
"6463980","6470020"," considering you spent two days in this place and I don't I'm not gonna upset that by the way just"
"6470020","6477560"," so you know but I did appreciate your your response earlier to Senator Scott when he asked about"
"6477560","6482720"," immigration he said you know the Fed hasn't been assigned that so I want to bring up something else"
"6482720","6485700"," you haven't been assigned to that you and I've talked about over the years and that of course this"
"6485700","6492640"," climate the role of climate in your job the role of climate risk and banking and you've often said"
"6492640","6497300"," I think you I think the most common statement was we should stick to our knitting I think is one"
"6497300","6504840"," of yours stay in our lane similarly what you said probably debt to Senator Scott but that said in"
"6504840","6513260"," October the Fed the OCC FDIC issued climate guidance as you know for management of covered"
"6513260","6519020"," institutions and so I'm just kind of curious did Congress somewhere along the line give the Fed"
"6519020","6522940"," authority over climate policy as well or was that not is that another one of those things that"
"6522940","6527240"," somebody just took on and I realized you're not the dictator of the Fed only the chairman of the"
"6527240","6533480"," Fed but I'd be interested in as the chairman your views on our room no our assignment is is the"
"6533480","6538140"," safety and soundness of banks and that they understand and can manage the risks that they face"
"6538140","6544580"," that's our assignment and we said in in the climate world we would do two and only two things one"
"6544580","6552540"," of them was to do a illustrative stress scenarios scenarios not stress scenarios scenarios climate"
"6552540","6558060"," scenarios so that you know the banks are already doing this the large banks who are subject they're"
"6558060","6562340"," already doing it because they're doing business internationally and they don't have any choice so"
"6562340","6567960"," we said we do that and we also said that we'd offer guidance on not on level of climate risk"
"6567960","6573280"," or anything like that just on what you had to do to be in a position to assess and and"
"6573280","6579100"," that's if for my thinking that's it that's what we're doing and we're not doing it they're no new"
"6579100","6584180"," initiatives we're not gonna change our capital requirements to reflect climate risk or anything"
"6584180","6589500"," like that I'm I'm really determined that we are not a climate policymaker and that that is really"
"6589500","6595240"," the business of elected officials thank you I'm gonna bring up one other topic I don't know that's"
"6595240","6599620"," been brought up today that's central bank digital currency I think from a lot of my frames out"
"6599620","6604400"," there I think there's some well I know there's some confusion I mean I'm easy to confuse but there"
"6604400","6610100"," are a lot of people get confused about what is meant by the administrations you know admonitioned"
"6610100","6615820"," it to continue researching experimenting looking at some sort of a you know central bank digital"
"6615820","6622140"," currency people I think people back home look at that and go oh my gosh you know they're gonna"
"6622140","6628980"," control this now and could you maybe just differentiate a little bit what people think of in terms"
"6628980","6635220"," of a Bitcoin or or their held digital currencies versus what a central bank digital currency who in"
"6635220","6640680"," my view should emulate cash right it's it still should be about the dollar not about some different"
"6640680","6645440"," kind of currency could you just sort of help people back home better understand why they should be"
"6645440","6650860"," quite so frightened first of all I want to say that we're nowhere near recommending or let alone"
"6650860","6657200"," adopting a central bank digital currency in any form but the idea is that as technology has evolved"
"6657200","6663360"," money has become digital so but the government doesn't issue digital money it's digital if you look"
"6663360","6667680"," at your bank account people don't hold those physical dollars they're digital so the thought was"
"6667680","6672500"," that the government could create a digital form of money that people could then transfer among"
"6672500","6679240"," themselves now of course that raises a concern that that if you if that were a government account"
"6679240","6683880"," that the government would see all your transactions and that's just something we would not we would"
"6683880","6690000"," not stand for or do or propose here in the United States that is how that works in China for"
"6690000","6694720"," example but that's not what we would say if we were to ever to do something like this and we're"
"6694720","6699200"," a very long way from even thinking about it we would do this through the banking system with the"
"6699200","6703600"," last thing we would want that we the federal reserve would want would be to have individual"
"6703600","6708560"," accounts for all Americans or any Americans for that matter only banks have accounts that that's"
"6708560","6713860"," the way we're going to keep it so it's it's just really it's a question of of following technology"
"6713860","6720020"," as it evolves and in a way that serves the public better people don't need to worry about it"
"6720020","6725620"," central bank digital currency nothing like that is is remotely close to happening anytime soon that"
"6725620","6729580"," was very helpful thank you was chairman thank you chairman mr."
"6730000","6732380"," Cortez Masto of Nevada thank you mr."
"6732500","6738380"," Chairman how great to see you again thank you for all of your good work I want to talk a"
"6738380","6743620"," little bit about the commercial real estate and what's happening there the financial stability"
"6743620","6750220"," oversight councils 2023 annual report identified commercial real estate as a financial risk and the"
"6750220","6757280"," feds monetary report also noted commercial real estate prices continue to decline especially in the"
"6757280","6762980"," office retail and multifamily sectors I'm especially concerned that because of the low levels of"
"6762980","6769680"," transactions in in the office sector prices have not yet fully reflected the true decline in the"
"6769680","6775300"," value so can you expand on the emerging risk the federal reserve has identified in the in the"
"6775300","6780320"," commercial real estate market one and then I'm curious can you discuss the the compound risks"
"6780320","6787240"," identified in commercial real estate lending particularly at banks with large CRE concentrations"
"6787240","6795660"," and high fractions of uninsured deposits sure let me say I think they're just very very few"
"6795660","6801200"," transactions in in commercial real estate right now particularly in the troubled areas so it's not"
"6801200","6805500"," a question of prices still falling it's a question that you don't have the kind of price discovery"
"6805500","6811320"," we you just have to assume that the prices are very low and come down a lot so on commercial"
"6811320","6818880"," real estate we have a secular change in people working from home this is one big part of it that"
"6818880","6824220"," means that in many cities the downtown office district is very under populated there are empty"
"6824220","6830120"," buildings in many major and minor cities it also means that all the retail that was there to"
"6830120","6834280"," service the thousands and thousands of people who work in those buildings they're under pressure"
"6834280","6840240"," too and banks will have made loans to many of those buildings not all of them but many so this"
"6840240","6846980"," this we've known for some years and so what do we do we have identified the banks that have high"
"6846980","6853640"," commercial real estate concentrations particularly office and retail and other ones that have been"
"6853640","6860760"," affected a lot we identify them and we are in dialogue with them around you know do you have your"
"6860760","6865400"," arms are on this problem do you have enough capital do you have enough liquidity do you have a plan"
"6865400","6871260"," you're gonna take losses here are you are you being truthful with yourself and with your owners and"
"6871260","6876220"," so we've been working with them and so for some time we've been doing that and you know this is"
"6876220","6882860"," a problem that we'll be working on for years more I'm sure there will be bank failures but this is"
"6882860","6886480"," not the big banks if you look at the very big banks it's not a first-order issue for any"
"6886480","6892060"," of the very large banks it's more you know smaller and medium-sized banks that have these issues"
"6892060","6898640"," we're working with them we're getting through it I think it's manageable is that word I would use"
"6898640","6903660"," but it's you know it's a very active thing for us and the other regulators and it will be for"
"6903660","6912880"," some time thank you do you have concerns well let me just ask you this as you're talking with these"
"6912880","6917840"," small medium-sized banks because we know that there's always could be a contagion which we've seen"
"6917840","6923760"," in the past do you have concerns that if they fail that somehow this is going to impact the"
"6923760","6928520"," financial sector and are you prepared and trying to address that and prevent that from happening"
"6928520","6933500"," we're trying to stay ahead of that so we also reached out to banks that had high concentrations of"
"6933500","6939280"," uninsured deposits and particularly underserved deposits and a lot of commercial real estate in the"
"6939280","6944380"," office sector so we're you know we're well aware of that issue we're just trying to stay ahead of"
"6944380","6949560"," it on a bank-by-bank basis and overall okay and so far we've been able to do that thank"
"6949560","6957100"," you let me jump to another issue that has been on my radar the federal housing finance agencies"
"6957100","6965260"," report on the federal home loan banks included or concluded that the distinction between the FHL"
"6965260","6970220"," banks role and that of the federal reserve discount window as lender of last resort has not been"
"6970220","6976500"," clear especially during times of market stress during the 2023 banking terminal we saw banks rely"
"6976500","6981180"," on advances from the federal home loan banks and didn't even have relationships with the federal"
"6981180","6987620"," reserve to use this discount window I know you've talked a little bit about this with senator"
"6987620","6993040"," Warner but how is the federal reserve working with the federal home loan banks to ensure that banks"
"6993040","6999140"," establish protocols to borrow from the feds discount rate window prior to times of stress we work"
"6999140","7004060"," with the federal home loan banks because in many cases banks were moving their loan from the"
"7004060","7009440"," federal home loan bank so we need to have smooth transfer we need to be in good touch with them"
"7009440","7016340"," even more important than that though is that banks any bank in the United States needs to be in"
"7016340","7022180"," touch with the discount window know know how to be able to to access it be able to access it"
"7022180","7027620"," have appropriate collateral have control of that collateral you know in many cases it would just"
"7027620","7034580"," was incredibly inefficient and took a long time for banks to actually go through that function the"
"7034580","7039560"," home the federal home loan banks are actually ahead of us in technology we know that we need to"
"7039560","7045060"," really invest in technology to modernize the discount window and also we need to do more to make"
"7045060","7050860"," that to get our our banks all of them in touch with the with the discount window in a way"
"7050860","7058700"," that they can use it quickly should they need to do so thank you Cortez master senator Hagerty of"
"7058700","7066760"," Tennessee's recognized thank you chairman Brown welcome chairman pal under the under your tenure"
"7066760","7067300"," mr."
"7067420","7073120"," Chairman the Fed has taken the stance that the two percent inflation target shouldn't be viewed as"
"7073120","7079900"," a snapshot in time but rather it needs to be achieved quote sustainably when inflation was running"
"7079900","7087040"," well above the two percent target back in 2021 and early 2022 the Fed was patient and allowed rates"
"7087040","7093100"," to offset the below target inflation that had occurred in years prior it strikes me as odd now that"
"7093100","7099700"," while we're still well above target inflation and have been well above for the prior year market"
"7099700","7103960"," seemed to expect the Fed to immediately cut even before we reached the two percent inflation"
"7103960","7110880"," threshold so my question is is this if the inflation rate reaches two percent would that be"
"7110880","7115720"," considered a return to the target rate on a sustainable basis or is it still the case that"
"7115720","7122140"," inflation would need to more or less overcorrect well below two percent before the Fed makes the"
"7122140","7128080"," rate cut adjustments we it would take us a while to really get comfortable that inflation had"
"7128080","7133740"," settled in sustainably at two percent but that's not our test for for changing interest rates"
"7133740","7138500"," interest rates right now are well under restrictive territory they're well above neutral and we've"
"7138500","7142160"," said we would not wait for inflation to get down to two percent because if you wait that you know"
"7142160","7148000"," monetary policy works with long and variable lags so we've said you know for some years that that"
"7148000","7153860"," we would start restoring the federal funds rate to a more normal almost neutral level we're far"
"7153860","7160620"," from neutral now and so you know we do plan assuming the economy moves along the lines we expect we"
"7160620","7165820"," do plan on on starting the process of dialing back restrict I'm just trying to square look for the"
"7165820","7174780"," symmetry I know we sort of allowed the economy to overshoot when inflation was high and and we sort"
"7174780","7178900"," of made up for prior years of low inflation trying to square that with the fact that we didn't"
"7178900","7184500"," actually do that we adopted a framework that said we would do that but then we got suddenly a few"
"7184500","7190120"," months later we got it almost an explosion of very high inflation that's not what we were looking"
"7190120","7194980"," we we said you know moderate moderately above or modestly above two percent this was not modestly"
"7194980","7201060"," above two percent and we reacted we thought that the mistake we made was we thought that that that"
"7201060","7206000"," inflation would go away that it was quickly regulatory transitory which means goes away quickly"
"7206000","7210680"," without effort by us we figured out at the end of twenty one that that was not the case and"
"7210680","7215660"," we acted and you don't see that same abrupt dynamic coming the other way you more comfortable no I"
"7215660","7220160"," think like I think we're in the right place which is we're waiting to see that we're waiting to"
"7220160","7224500"," become more confident than inflation is moving sustainably at two percent when we do get that"
"7224500","7228840"," confidence and we're not far from it it'll be appropriate to begin to dial back the level of"
"7228840","7233920"," restriction so that we don't you know drive the economy into recession rather than normalizing"
"7233920","7239620"," policy as the economy gets back to normal can we go to the balance sheet and talk about that we've"
"7239620","7244780"," seen a dramatic expansion of the Fed's balance sheet over the past couple of decades in 2005 it was"
"7244780","7250060"," at eight hundred billion dollars it's at seven point five trillion a day it's double since the"
"7250060","7256100"," pandemic was underway and through quantitative tapering the Fed is attempting to to reduce its"
"7256100","7263620"," footprint and the concern I have is on the other hand government spending tends to just continue to"
"7263620","7269520"," be thought profligate we're running now a trillion dollar deficit every 100 days and we're flooding"
"7269520","7272780"," the market with treasury debt and we're pushing putting up with pressure on interest rates as a"
"7272780","7278140"," result and what I think that is lost on on many of us here is that the spending levels will"
"7278140","7282640"," only make your job harder when it comes to lowering interest rates not to mention there's a tacit"
"7282640","7289120"," expectation that the federal step in once the markets can no longer absorb our new issuance I think"
"7289120","7293560"," this is very serious problem I think it deserves more attention and I think we're now at a point"
"7293560","7299720"," where your objectives may be you know very weird down here that we have the monthly trigger down at"
"7299720","7304900"," one oh two fifty on Dixie am I missing something here Mr. Chairman or does increased net issuance"
"7304900","7311760"," by the treasury lead to higher rates I mean in principle more supply should lead to modestly higher"
"7311760","7316940"," rates but that's not going to affect what we do that's not a problem for us we're you know our"
"7316940","7322300"," balance sheet normalization is running very much as expected we've decreased the size of our"
"7322300","7328180"," holdings by almost one and a half trillion dollars I hear you I just I think it's troubling that we"
"7328180","7332900"," continue to put physical pressure by continuing to put again we're running a deficit of a trillion"
"7332900","7336900"," dollars every one hundred days and the issuance is required to deal with that putting a lot more"
"7336900","7341280"," pressure I think on the Fed and again making your job harder I think we need to take that into"
"7341280","7347620"," consideration another component of this topic your colleague Governor Waller said he'd like the Fed"
"7347620","7352020"," to shift its holdings toward a larger share of short-term treasuries back prior to the financial"
"7352020","7356620"," crisis about a third of the Fed's holdings were in bills now they're around three percent of your"

"7360900","7366440"," take us to get there take a while you know that's that's an issue we're in our FOMC meeting in"
"7366440","7371220"," a couple of weeks we're gonna have our first really deep dive on what to do with the balance sheet"
"7371220","7376160"," that's one of the issues I don't think we'll deal with that at this meeting but over time you know"
"7376160","7381800"," you'd love not to own a lot of MBS and I can see a case for shortening the maturity but"
"7381800","7385140"," it's not something you know it's not something that would happen quickly and it's and you know"
"7385140","7388920"," we're not we're not actually looking at that that's sort of a longer-term aspiration that I think"
"7388920","7393820"," he was just one final point Mr. Chair and you know I've talked about this before we're we're we're"
"7393820","7399020"," in an election year you're getting a lot of pressure I hear from lawmakers to adjust rates I'm not"
"7399020","7402520"," willing to raise rates or lower rates but I'm just here to emphasize the fact that the credibility"
"7402520","7407480"," of the Fed depends on your remaining data driven the credibility of our currency as the as the"

"8148330","8154730"," follow one question I'm finished Mr. Chairman will you confirm that prior to the Federal Reserve"
"8154730","8162450"," issuing any new liquidity requirements it will first conduct all necessary data collection that"

"8168810","8176670"," short Mr. Chairman maybe that's very short I can't we can talk about this more but I don't want to"
"8176670","8181330"," make a really specific commitment like that without talking to people who are you know carefully in"
"8181330","8187770"," touch with this but that that is the right thought thanks German thank you senator Federman from"

"8270700","8276400"," that some of the folks in this room would have is that good for the economy and are you concerned"
"8276400","8282680"," that banks under your supervision are doing this are not paying sufficient that's correct that's"
"8282680","8286920"," that's a question I haven't I haven't heard of course they have the option of putting that's a good"

"8335020","8339600"," getting anything on our checking accounts so we solve that problem I don't think we're asking for"
"8339600","8347420"," but but given the reality the question so let me let me pivot the monetary policy in port seats it"
"8347420","8355100"," while demand for housing has fallen the strong labor market has kept prices high that matches what"
"8355100","8360840"," I've been seeing in Georgia too many folks can't afford a home according to the monetary policy"

"8368420","8374700"," increases of just a percentage point or two can be the difference between owning a home or not are"
"8374700","8381520"," you concerned about this interplay between lower demand yet stubbornly high prices and what it"
"8381520","8388360"," means for folks trying to buy a home and what do you think is is driving these high prices so"
"8388360","8394340"," that the housing market is in a very challenging situation right now you have this longer run"
"8394340","8398740"," housing shortage that's right at the same time you've got a bunch of things that have to do with"
"8398740","8404020"," the pandemic and the inflation in our response with higher rates so you have a shortage of homes"
"8404020","8408840"," available for sale because many people are living in homes with a very low rate mortgage that they"
"8408840","8414660"," can't afford to refinance so they're not moving the longer run is back to 0708 regular existing"
"8414660","8420180"," homes that are for sale is historically low and very low transaction rate that actually pushes up"
"8420180","8426340"," prices of of other existing homes and also of new homes because they're just not enough supply the"
"8426340","8431920"," builders are busy but they're running into you know all kinds of supply issues still around zoning"
"8431920","8438380"," and and workers and things like that so it's quite challenging and of course rates are high so"
"8438380","8444180"," people who are buying a lot of the buyers are cash cash baby able to actually pay without a"
"8444180","8449080"," mortgage because mortgages are expensive I will say the first problem the longer one problem supply"
"8449080","8455340"," is a longer run problem the other problems associated with low rate mortgages and high rates and"
"8455340","8462200"," all that the longer run is because we had a housing shortage before 0708 but we'll still be left"
"8462200","8466760"," with with the housing market nationally where where does the housing shortage there's no question"
"8466760","8475800"," major issue and this issue of high prices lack of supply of course disproportionately impacts some"

"8496500","8503400"," at around 3% we can appreciate progress but a 3% gap is still significant would you agree that"
"8503400","8509480"," it is important to continue to continue focusing on narrowing this gap and if so what tools as a"
"8509480","8515620"," federal reserve have to do this work it's very important and the single best thing we can do is get"
"8515620","8522500"," prices under control and inflation under control so that we can have a long expansion with the the"
"8522500","8528140"," record is clear that a long expansion it really gives significant benefits to people at the at the"
"8528140","8533020"," low end of the income spectrum because the labor market gets very tight inflation is low and they"
"8533020","8537860"," benefit more than anybody so that's where we were before the pandemic and we'd like to get back to"
"8537860","8543560"," that place thank you so very much I think there's some other legislative I disagree with that that"
"8543560","8550220"," we were leading into a recessionary period before the pandemic done to improve that rate that"

"8561120","8570660"," Powell my first question is about CDBCs there's been some chatter lately on the"
"8570660","8579320"," social media that people are concerned about the Fed creating a CDBC without"
"8579320","8588760"," legislative authorization you and I've discussed that before and as you know there Joe Kennedy"
"8588760","8598500"," comes out in the they're talking about CBDs that that marijuana stuff"
"8598500","8607080"," other than a CDBC so the question is this do you still agree that the federal I thought I heard"
"8607080","8615380"," CBDs a US they're talking about CBDs now you hear that up there through the station yes I do thank"
"8615380","8622140"," you that's just that's really calms people's fears the people who are concerned that we could end"
"8622140","8627380"," up with something like the digital you want that is used as a means of surfing you hear that"
"8627380","8633280"," there's a guy on the Internet's called Juan he's talking about CBDs and stuff the Fed my next"
"8633280","8643100"," question is about your core CPE now as you know there's a disconnect between how you measure damn"
"8643100","8651300"," ones out there selling CBDs American people see inflation because the American people are spending"
"8651300","8661060"," their money on gasoline and food and rent things that have gone up a lot and they hear about these"
"8661060","8670220"," improvements in the economy that they're not seeing in their everyday lives so can you explain what"
"8670220","8679460"," measures you use to evaluate inflation and just explain to the American people why you don't factor"
"8679460","8686480"," in the things they spend money on every day like food and gasoline actually we do our statutory"
"8686480","8692040"," target is inflation it's not core inflation so if you look at if you look at headline inflation"
"8692040","8697740"," over the last 12 months that's it that's that's our goal it's 2.4 percent core inflation is"
"8697740","8703000"," actually higher than that it's 2.8 percent and the reason is that some energy and food prices have"
"8703000","8709320"," come down and those don't count in core so we you know our overall legal target is is headline"
"8709320","8717340"," inflation which is you know it's our best effort to capture the the cost of living that people face"
"8717340","8722120"," it's not perfect it's very you have to make all kinds of judgments that aren't easy I mentioned"
"8722120","8727960"," that housing earlier how do you measure housing inflation lots of issues but that's what we target"
"8727960","8735720"," the reason we look at core though is that headline inflation tends to be more volatile and it tends"
"8735720","8741360"," to be pushed around by commodity prices which really don't relate to the overall state of the"
"8741360","8747220"," economy as it tight as loose so core tends to be a better predictor of overall inflation than"
"8747220","8752340"," overall inflation is I know that's complicated but ultimately though our target is headline"
"8752340","8760300"," inflation which does include food and energy I mr chairman I'd like to include a letter in the"

"8777160","8785180"," more likely that it will be harder for consumers to buy a house and small business to obtain alone"
"8785180","8794700"," under Basel 3 or will lending just migrate outside the banking system which may be harder to assess"
"8794700","8802900"," because it's opaque I'm sorry I didn't get your question okay so with regard to Basel 3 if there"
"8802900","8812740"," are more constraints on lending activity what is more apt to be the consequence of"
"8812740","8819700"," that that it's so I read I read this bill right and then I read some of the arguments for"
"8819700","8825520"," encounter to my name Basel and I bet none of these people even understand it themselves fully if"
"8825520","8831360"," there were anything gonna throw the word Basel around credit in the banking system they would"
"8831360","8835240"," probably probably be both things probably they'd be fewer loans made but in addition there would be"

"8868140","8884070"," Congress spending more and 1978 that started more money or are they separate considerations it's"
"8884070","8891430"," hard to get my mind around that question we don't print money to fund the deficit that's not what"
"8891430","8899170"," happens when the government borrows it borrows it issues basically the government borrows to fund"
"8899170","8905750"," deficits is what happens right and so that's so so that would educate me that on bills you pass"
"8905750","8915390"," because we in spending in deficit spending are creating a you spend it and you're"
"8915390","8920390"," responding by well we're not making loans though you know we're not we're not landing money to the"
"8920390","8926210"," government we're not financing these deficits and so there's no chicken"
"8926210","8935550"," in the why don't we continue this yeah"
"8937030","8946830"," thoughts earlier about fiscal sustainability and how we can work with you Jerome Powell now now"
"8946830","8952910"," creates the deficit spends the money great oh here we go address these issues you know the markets"
"8952910","8961130"," like get fuck we're going up what you say has since it ripple effects outside of this building but"
"8961130","8965510"," it would sure be nice if we could sit down with you on a bipartisan basis and have those"
"8965510","8973770"," discussions in a frank way thank you senator federman of penciling holy shit that was bizarre all"
"8973770","8980450"," right senator van Hollen's right let me um you know let me start by thanking senator federman for"
"8980450","8988350"," his allowing me to to question mr chairman good to see you real wages are up right that's good news"
"8988350","8994950"," yes over the last couple of years you know wages have been going up more than inflation real wages"
"8994950","9002850"," broadly or up that means more families have more spending power in their budgets right yes worker"
"9002850","9011150"," productivity is up right yes he did corporate profits are up right i believe so and productivity"
"9011150","9018350"," worker productivity is rising faster than corporate profits right i don't know the answer that may"
"9018350","9024690"," well be right the the charts i i show suggest that so that would indicate that in less you know"
"9024690","9034170"," corporations decide to pocket as profits more of the gains they get from their workers labor"
"9034170","9041610"," that we should be able to continue to have increases in real wages is that right yeah and so i"
"9041610","9048290"," just it's important i think that you know people recognize that these corporations are doing better"
"9048290","9053230"," than ever if your eyes on these buyers right now see if they can catch a new high they don't"
"9053230","9059150"," necessarily need the specific new high but you want to see gains this can lead to some major upside"
"9059150","9065310"," moves right now watch spy really quick to watch this very closely here we're going to get a profit"
"9065310","9071850"," but the question is whether or not workers the setup here is for a big pretty big move to the"
"9071850","9079190"," upside and as you know targeting five fifteen thirty nine for decades between rising worker"
"9079190","9086450"," productivity and real wages and we're hoping to close that gap would you agree that it would be"
"9086450","9094050"," good for a more inclusive economy if if worker wages tracked worker productivity increases i think"
"9094050","9098890"," i think if you include benefits it that's that's a significant part of that gap i've looked into"
"9098890","9104150"," that but not for not for some years but yeah i mean generally speaking people's compensation should"
"9104150","9112530"," equal should be over time equal to increases in productivity over time shape that and i i also want"
"9112530","9117790"," to there's the trade off on workers wages and there's also an issue with that's a key point there"
"9117790","9126530"," so we have seen record profits we've also seen very high prices these corporations are charging are"
"9126530","9133070"," for things like groceries now i i listen to a little bit of exchange with the chairman earlier and"
"9133070","9143050"," of course i think your answer was you know people will charge what consumers will pay but it"
"9143050","9149810"," should be known that these corporations are reaping much larger profits now than they were pre "
"9149810","9156330","-covid for example right i mean some of them are i'm not i'm not super focused on individual"
"9156330","9162850"," corporate profits but you know corporate profits i gather have been high overall right i mean"
"9162850","9171130"," they're they're high for a couple reasons one is that they're charging consumers for example"
"9171130","9179970"," grocery stores a lot of money and the other would be if they're not sharing the"
"9179970","9185710"," benefits is i got to interrupt this guy so this guy's bullshitting right now this guy understands"
"9185710","9192090"," basic fundamental inflation year over year even if we're at two percent that prices are going to go"
"9192090","9199210"," up this guy also knows that price centers cannot raise prices unless we have an event those events"
"9199210","9206210"," will only take place every 10 to 20 years but this guy knows this so this is like dumb talk"
"9207030","9216070"," at the grocery store or engaging in things like shrinkflation rather than in order to have more of"
"9216070","9224990"," their profits let me let me turn briefly to a letter that i sent to the vice chair of supervision"
"9224990","9233050"," some of the other federal regulators in january of this year regarding the the Basel three capital"
"9233050","9240530"," requirements and i support the overall effort on on Basel we did raise concerns with respect to a"
"9240530","9248050"," specific issue which is the harmful and we think unnecessarily harmful impact it could have on"
"9248050","9254710"," clean energy tax credit investments and all of the regulators testifying that day including the"
"9254710","9260470"," vice chairman said they recognize this was a significant issue and hope to address it would you"
"9260470","9265890"," agree with that yes i would thank you thank you mr chairman thank you senator fetterman thanks"
"9265890","9273730"," senator holland senator fetterman of pencil vane is recognized yes i love that all right so it's"
"9273730","9280590"," great to be here with you today now i don't know maybe some people in america we're talking about a"
"9280590","9288150"," cookie that was 18 dollars and i was i was alarmed and i hope we investigate that there is a"
"9288150","9297770"," an a cookie that cost 18 dollars and and do you believe that an anecdote on twitter about a cookie"
"9297770","9306450"," that caught 18 dollars is that reflective of our economy and where we're at or not i certainly hope"
"9306450","9313130"," not i don't do much shopping these days but that sounds like a pretty expensive cookie yeah and now"
"9313130","9319810"," and i believe that you know that the american economy now is is the envy of the worlds after"
"9319810","9325250"," everything right now correct we are yes we're performing very well compared to our peer group yeah"
"9325250","9332650"," pretty great uh and and is it fair to say that the stock markets are all a bit record highs"
"9332650","9341130"," right pretty close yeah and inflation has been pretty effectively addressed right coming down"
"9341130","9345090"," sharply since the middle of last year yes we've got a ways to go on that but we've made a"
"9345090","9352210"," lot of progress and corporate profits are pretty robust is that fair i believe it is okay well if"
"9352210","9357850"," we can agree that and i cyclically though corporate profits should pull back especially producers"
"9357850","9367470"," of real goods over time that it seems to be against the evidence as well but given given that now"
"9367470","9375970"," since things are pretty pretty great and we're in a really great excuse me one second place but now"
"9375970","9383210"," i am concerned and there's rumors going around uh that that basil are they're going to change and"
"9383210","9389550"," they're going to reducing the capital right and and i guess i'm concerned about that because i"
"9389550","9394190"," don't know why we would want to and also i want the record to reflect on you're much smarter than"
"9394190","9399090"," i am but i would be concerned that things are in a really great place right now we can all"
"9399090","9404590"," agree on that i would be concerned to change something like that because i wouldn't want to have"
"9404590","9412290"," something again like what happened with uh svb and i just wanted to get your take on on that is"
"9412290","9419650"," is sure so us banks are are well capitalized uh and generally speaking they're quite well"
"9419650","9424690"," capitalized and we're not talking about reducing current capital levels at all really in the basil"
"9424690","9431250"," three end game capital may well go up and what we're talking about is whether the proposal that was"
"9431250","9437110"," put out by the bank regulatory agencies including the Fed and which has now been the subject of"
"9437110","9441990"," quite a lot of comment whether you know what changes will be appropriate to that that's what we're"
"9441990","9448510"," talking about we're not talking about reducing existing capital requirements oh okay well that's"
"9448510","9453290"," and uh and then i still want to play off of a comment made by my colleague from Tennessee and"
"9453290","9458550"," i actually agreed with him and he's concerned about the deficit about it's a trillion dollars for"
"9458550","9465110"," every hundred dollar days so now if the federal government added three and a half trillion to the"
"9465110","9473430"," deficit by extending the trump tax cuts would that increase or decrease inflation so i'm uh i'm"
"9473430","9479290"," gonna fall back on our our longtime reluctance to comment on fiscal policy we we take your fiscal"
"9479290","9484790"," policy decisions whatever they may be we take them as they are and we conduct monetary policy to"
"9484790","9490190"," achieve 2% inflation but we don't we don't score inflation CBO does that they'll they'll make a"
"9490190","9495010"," judgment on that but it's not something we do because you know we're an independent agency and that"
"9495010","9499310"," requires us to stay the heck out of politics no there was right there too that was a political"
"9499310","9506790"," question but would would those kind of uh tax cuts uh think would that help uh addressing inflation"
"9506790","9514050"," or inflame inflation i don't know what the effects would be on inflation i do know broadly speaking"
"9514050","9520550"," um we need to get to a place where revenues and spending are better aligned and i think everybody"
"9520550","9525730"," knows that and you know i think uh we used to talk about this a lot 10 years ago we're"
"9525730","9531410"," not talking about it so much anymore that's understandable the pandemic was a special thing but i"
"9531410","9536490"," do think it's it would be great to get back to that on a bipartisan basis okay well in my"
"9536490","9539770"," i have about 30 seconds left i just want to go on the record i i think you've done a"
"9539770","9544730"," really great job and and i think our economy and i do agree that it is the envy of the"
"9544730","9552610"," world as as well and i i'm confused that more people are talking about cookies or McDonald's meals"
"9552610","9559270"," and those kinds of a thing it's not reflective on the strength of this as well too and i just"
"9559270","9563990"," want to thank you for your service thank you sir thank you senator Federman that's the last"
"9563990","9569530"," question and thanks for your generosity in yielding to um colleagues who got here before from whom"

"9640600","9647180"," one second air boys and girls let's take a look at um book map really quick and just see where"
"9647180","9661430"," we really are it's"
"9661430","9666690"," like we have some a little bit more supply to the upside up there you can see a little bit"
"9666690","9676330"," developing uh 5168 and then uh 5162 this is all good supply down here so i'm looking at looking at"
"9676330","9687670"," a little bit of resistance to the upside right now uh we'll monitor this on the main screen i'm"
"9687670","9691710"," going to take a quick break here um and i'll come back to you in about a half an hour"
"9691710","9698150"," maybe an hour um while uh because we're sitting here for the last three hours or so i need to"
"9698150","9705170"," go potty and uh get my legs working and all that kind of stuff make sure i'm not sitting in"
"9705170","9710410"," a chair all morning do you guys have any quick questions for me now i'll put on cnbc so that"
"9710410","9717930"," you can listen to um whatever the talking heads are going to take away from that uh that"
"9717930","9725350"," conversation we have a little bit more volatility tomorrow in the morning uh but otherwise you i've"
"9725350","9730950"," already shown you guys the ball surface uh it should start to to come down today and then a little"
"9730950","9737470"," bit more as well tomorrow uh so if you're interested in selling ball that's the trade um or i'm"
"9737470","9740850"," going to assume that a lot of you out there are going to try to sell ball sell vix all"
"9740850","9748390"," that sort of stuff out there it's already been it's already been being sold right you know those"
"9748390","9755410"," boys are already out there selling they've been selling it down now uh two big sell downs one two i"
"9755410","9764710"," would expect more of the same uh into at least morning uh and that's the that's a key point right"
"9764710","9770790"," so i want you to remember this right now uh that i want to remember that this was a buildup"
"9770790","9777370"," lead into uh the senate hearings and now it's on to the next volatility they were expecting we're"
"9777370","9783170"," going to actually change our story right and start discussing like the in vid and vidia conference"
"9783170","9791430"," that's coming up uh we're at the the discussion will change to uh opx opx mopx copx you know triple"
"9791430","9797470"," witching quadruple witching all that stuff uh that's coming up right blackout periods uh that'll be"
"9797470","9804550"," the next uh doom and gloom that we have to deal with but right now uh the volatility should blow"
"9804550","9811990"," off or at least a little while um yeah that's you know and bears didn't get or sellers and bears"
"9811990","9817730"," didn't get what they wanted on this so um not just be looking for sell points above on some supply"
"9817730","9823770"," you see that up above you should see us grind higher until we meet up with that uh resistance uh"
"9823770","9829530"," that's applied to sell us down uh but otherwise there's not much to talk about other than uh the"
"9829530","9836510"," data that's coming out tomorrow morning uh so i think that's it right now at this point right now"
"9836510","9839350"," so i want to take a quick break i'll be back with you guys in a little bit uh good"
"9839350","9845850"," luck out there uh if you're a seller you know what to do right uh buy the dip until buy"
"9845850","9853830"," pullbacks and dips until there is either a reason uh if the sell or the gamma comes off the market"
"9853830","9863830"," or we have the next volatile event and we're going higher right now another note here too would"
"9863830","9871910"," be to I want you to also note that this zone up here uh this is a you know like"
"9871910","9876610"," this is an RTX sell zone up here so anything up in here you start seeing prices get up there"
"9876610","9881510"," and if you see any kind of blasting up that would be a queue for a uh or a queue"
"9881510","9888310"," for a seller to uh want to step in to sell this down uh into tomorrow or Monday or something"
"9888310","9892770"," like that the one thing i would say on that though would be the one thing i would say about"
"9892770","9898770"," that you might get the sell for a day or so but there's going to be some um there's likely"
"9898770","9904210"," going to be some pomo out there at the vault uh being taken out of the market at the moment"
"9904210","9911170"," just be aware of that if you are a seller and i'll be right back with you guys and put"
"9911170","9930020"," some CMB up to see on right now you frothy"
"9930020","9936120"," as it would seem in an environment that is fast changing from a rate standpoint yep and an earning"
"9936120","9939460"," yep our forecast all along is that the first half of the year that we're going to see rates around"
"9939460","9944120"," 4% that's where we are are we frothy on a near-term basis yeah according to history in terms"
"9944120","9949720"," of second years of bull markets we're about 700 basis points ahead of the average bull market in"
"9949720","9955480"," four months into the second year over the last 13 bull markets so with everybody agreeing that"
"9955480","9959360"," we're in a bull market and everybody trying to play this momentum game when everybody agrees that"
"9959360","9964300"," things are positive i want to go the other way just like when everyone's super negative i want to"
"9964300","9967960"," be contrarian i feel like there are still a lot of bears out there who are afraid to change their"
"9967960","9972740"," view now because they've been negative for so long no i think that's true on the on the true bears"
"9972740","9977900"," that are always bearish right but you've seen these fringe people talk about being bullish even"
"9977900","9983440"," though they're kind of speak is actually quite bearish so we are still very bullish longer term"
"9983440","9987640"," we're long-term investors in us stocks we think we can get stocks a little bit cheaper over the"
"9987640","9993140"," next few months jimmy ubs today says price momentum as a style is you know i want to interrupt here"
"9993140","10000040"," just listen to this bullshit that's being spun by cnc or cnbc plays off and that was not the story"
"10000040","10007360"," of two days that have just ripped and roared um you trimmed in video two now if we're having some"
"10007360","10012340"," sort of melt up what are we supposed to do with it right it right at the trim of in"
"10012340","10017120"," video was actually a mistake i mean i don't think we need to spend much breath on that i'm very"
"10017120","10021380"," much with brian on this that it is frothy i think we are in a melt up now there's no"
"10021380","10024920"," definition of that but i will tell you what i'm going to do is i'm going to ride it until"
"10024920","10029280"," i get a distributive day and when that happens i'm going to trim i'm going to trim in the"
"10029280","10034300"," semiconductor space which is the epicenter in my opinion of this melt up but i'm not going to try"
"10034300","10039440"," to anticipate it that was a mistake with in video obviously and this thing can look it could turn"
"10039440","10043960"," tomorrow who knows what the jobs report is going to be or it could go another 10 percent higher and"
"10043960","10049280"," my feeling on this is that on a distributive day if i end up trimming Qualcomm or nxp"
"10049280","10053840"," semiconductors on a down four percent day you can look at the charts of either of those companies"
"10053840","10058500"," because it's not just in video that's been melting up these stocks look at them one year or year to"
"10058500","10063160"," date i mean they are just they are turning exponential so if i end up giving up four percentage"
"10063160","10068280"," points on stocks that are up 60 percent believe me i can live with that but for right now ride"
"10068280","10072360"," it don't try to anticipate it it can go on far longer than you think i agree it's a step"
"10072360","10076080"," to wide melt up and just to put some media on those you've been nervous about the Nasdaq more than"
"10076080","10082340"," most yeah so mo mainly mega mega cap tech which as Liz said the the buyers continue to come in"
"10082340","10086420"," you cease to like meta today's up four percent yeah meta and my video is up with the best right"
"10086420","10091080"," now trying to go positive i know the underperformers like the Teslas of the world and the alphabets"
"10091080","10096800"," and the apples but at some level and maybe we're at it now or we hit it after the sell "
"10096800","10101460","-off we got earlier this week the dip buyers say enough is enough these are the stocks that you want"
"10101460","10107380"," to be in because of exponential growth in their earnings power relative to ai to be clear you"
"10107380","10113600"," didn't really get a dip in meta or microsoft you got one apple uh 17 percent below it's 50 day"
"10113600","10120900"," that's a dip the rest not quite yet a dip but semis are just across the board i was looking"
"10120900","10128580"," at some tickers tsm up five percent avgo up three asml up four if you look at a 10 year"
"10128580","10135840"," annualized basis the smh is up 28 percent that's annualized returns for one industry group you know"
"10135840","10140940"," the wild part about this too right is they did not have this conversation with you two days ago"
"10140940","10146380"," they're having this conversation with you after the fucking fact which is bullshit group of winning"
"10146380","10151700"," stocks that continues they were they put you into fear rather than this is what we're going to do"
"10151700","10157260"," the plan ahead before it happens that's what wolf said what i melt up is just crushed it that's"
"10157260","10162500"," what wolf said all i do is uh momentum is going to outperform until the fundamentals disappoint"
"10162500","10168020"," yeah absolutely and we're not seeing anything close to fundamentals really disappointing now you"
"10168020","10173380"," you can pick and say okay well maybe the mag seven is now the mag five for the time being"
"10173380","10177520"," maybe the fundamentals have disappointed from tesla standpoint and maybe there are questions about"
"10177520","10182120"," the fundamentals related to apple and china and weakness around the iphone and market share there"
"10182120","10187580"," but otherwise you haven't had enough of a fundamental disconnect to upset the trade at large and i"
"10187580","10191920"," don't know that we're going to get one from a stock by stock basis that's big enough to send the"
"10191920","10195860"," whole market the other direction i think if there's going to be bad fundamental news it's probably"
"10195860","10200740"," more bad economic fundamental news and the fed reacts to it and people get scared because of that"
"10200740","10206960"," but you have to also notice that i remember when we talked about can the market go up without apple"
"10206960","10211980"," the answer to that now is yes so we've just shifted our view to now can the market go up"
"10211980","10216940"," without in vidia and we don't know the answer to that yet but i think you have to recognize the"
"10216940","10221360"," momentum strength that is behind that and that doesn't mean that it's correct that doesn't mean"
"10221360","10225280"," that it's not all going to come crashing down right big tree fall hard at some point times are"
"10225280","10230480"," different though right before before i struggle with that so much did i say that you know there was"
"10230480","10236020"," a period of time where maybe we couldn't have withstood uh you know a significant decline in apple"
"10236020","10240860"," or an alphabet but now that slack if you will is being picked up by so many other areas of"
"10240860","10245440"," market gets we distributed some of right well we just changed it we just moved it off apple and put"
"10245440","10250620"," it on in vidia so now well it's not like in vidia is the only megacap stock doing well i"
"10250620","10255060"," said you know meta hits a new high today but my point is that if you've got you know financials"
"10255060","10259360"," industrial materials all these other areas of the market that are suddenly doing well yeah a drop"
"10259360","10265080"," in apple doesn't stick out like a sore thumb it's it's absorbed by these other areas that's what"
"10265080","10269180"," we're witnessing now so then back up and let's try to figure out why some of those other sectors"
"10269180","10274560"," are doing well you've got by the end of february more than half of strategist price targets were"
"10274560","10279720"," already blown out for all of 2024 then people started to chase to brian's point everybody's"
"10279720","10285120"," starting to raise their targets so we're chasing this momentum rally people are recognizing i mean"
"10285120","10289960"," people are reasonably rational about the multiples right now recognizing that some of that had gone"
"10289960","10294380"," too far too fast but they absolutely don't want to take their money out of equities so they just"
"10294380","10298980"," start rotating out of the stuff that they've been holding that was up a lot and into things that"
"10298980","10304300"," are adjacent so other parts of tech or maybe the cyclicals because the economy didn't fall apart"
"10304300","10311060"," but the fundamentals economically didn't get materially better they just didn't get worse so we're"
"10311060","10315740"," sustaining through this where we're still growing we're okay inflation's not that big of a concern"
"10315740","10320580"," the labor market hasn't cracked so suddenly everybody said okay we can buy cyclicals now which is"
"10320580","10325700"," you see this big run up in industrials and now i think investors are still looking for other places"
"10325700","10331040"," where it makes more sense to pay that multiple because they're they're still searching for upside i"
"10331040","10336000"," want to hit financials too brian with you because yeah i feel like remember the financials finance"
"10336000","10341100"," has been it's been a favored place for you i think the most substantial thing that came out of the"
"10341100","10347100"," two days of pal since we really didn't we didn't get much if anything new on the monetary policy"
"10347100","10353500"," front was he've all but slammed the door shut on these new Basel 3 regulations that have been"
"10353500","10359420"," railed on by bank CEOs and long discussed pal made it clear that there are going to be major"
"10359420","10365160"," changes to what is being proposed and that is going to be good for the banks there's there's no"
"10365160","10370760"," real way to other way to look at that over the past month the XLF 52 week high now wells"
"10370760","10375060"," is is it a 52 week high JP Morgan's at a high you're trimming that one though yep we trim"
"10375060","10379820"," a little JP Morgan because we prefer city group as we've been adding to city group over the last"
"10379820","10384440"," five months it's a contrarian play we love to buy banks when they're restructuring and cutting"
"10384440","10390100"," costs but we've been long-term bulls in terms of the big banks the asset managers and the brokerage"
"10390100","10396320"," firms because of the scalable size of this now with respect to the regulations falling off now you"
"10396320","10401620"," have the opportunity for some regional banks to add scale how do they add scale through m&a and"
"10401620","10406980"," business combination so i think you're going to see consolidation be a major theme it maybe as"
"10406980","10411440"," early as the second half of this year but certainly into 25 and 26 and that's going to be really"
"10411440","10416720"," really good for the financial services area any overall which oh by the way still remains"
"10416720","10422820"," relatively underway by the majority of our institutional investors i mean JP Morgan is a place as"
"10422820","10428900"," Josh knows that has had just tremendous momentum behind it there's nothing to suggest at least on"
"10428900","10435520"," the surface that that paradigm is about to change anytime soon correct yeah i don't think so it's a"
"10435520","10441060"," very it's a it's a standalone issue even within financial services there is no other institution"
"10441620","10446060"," that has all of the elements that JP Morgan has their number one or two in every business that"
"10446060","10450440"," they're in they're more profitable than most of their peers they don't make stupid decisions when"
"10450440","10455880"," the market gets shaky and then when the market normalizes they tend to out earn everyone else it's"
"10455880","10461520"," one of these things where you actually don't get penalized for paying a slightly above industry"
"10461520","10467740"," multiple for the stock it's a higher price book it's been proven year after year why it's a higher"
"10467740","10473160"," price book and that has never worked against you look at the performance of JP M versus the XLF"
"10473160","10479100"," versus the money center banks versus basket case stocks like city consistently it works it works it"
"10479100","10485300"," works or former basket case stocks like city because the stock is former basket case call me when"
"10485300","10489780"," commercial will stay below us a little bit more the stocks hit a new 52 week high Jimmy you've been"
"10489780","10494080"," talking about what Jane Frasier's been doing over there at city sort of reinventing what it's 17"
"10494080","10498640"," year drawdown with all the respect to city all right but that's okay now it's time in some respects"
"10498640","10502980"," people try and play a what have you done for me lately game when it comes to these banks it's"
"10502980","10506820"," an accurate description of the history and I'm not taking shots at you I mean I think you clearly"
"10506820","10512020"," have to understand that the sentiment has changed I agree with Brian on this the street is finally"
"10512020","10517900"," giving Jane Frasier credit for what she's doing cross cutting big deal no no no you're being too"
"10517900","10522080"," dismissive of this I mean for two years she's been right sizing the business internationally"
"10522080","10527280"," getting rid of underperforming divisions whether it's geographical or underperforming divisions"
"10527280","10531660"," like municipal bonds obviously near and dear to my heart but she looked at that with a clear cold"
"10531660","10536160"," eye and said this isn't giving us enough enough return on equity we're done with it the street"
"10536160","10540620"," applauds that and frankly the value is there I'm not Josh I don't want to argue with you about this"
"10540620","10545480"," what's happening right now not history history is done what's happening right now is the stock is"
"10545480","10550180"," generating cash flow with which it's meaningfully retiring shares we can have a debate by the way"
"10550180","10554840"," that doesn't mean we're having an argument if you have fundamentally different and opposing views"
"10554840","10560280"," what they do after the right size is there a growth story here well so good question yes there is"
"10560280","10565300"," and there's also risk right where is the growth story here frankly it's credit cards which if you"
"10565300","10569980"," believe that the economy is going to go strong then it's a fine place to be if you're bearish on"
"10569980","10574780"," the economy and you're worried about delinquency some may be they say I don't want to own city oh"
"10574780","10579280"," by the way they also do a mean business and treasury security for corporations and security process"
"10579280","10583060"," I don't think it's one of these I want the message to be clear this isn't either or you can"
"10583060","10588380"," own both and I think people have completely said no to city group was for the record we own more"
"10588380","10593020"," JP Morgan in our portfolios and we do city group we're very pointed in terms of where we own city"
"10593020","10596540"," group but I think it's time to start looking at that company there's one important point here right"
"10596540","10601640"," if Basel 3 is going to be modified and capital requirements when because it is I'm with you all"
"10601640","10607020"," right I love what I'm hearing from J Powell today that's going to give city more wherewithal to buy"
"10607020","10612520"," back shares over the last five years they've retired 20% of their shares outstanding at at"
"10612520","10617540"," discounts really meaningful discounts a tangible book value that's good that's good all right so"
"10617540","10620840"," let's do this let's take a quick break when we come back we do have more committee moves to tell"
"10620840","10625080"," you about Josh just sold two important stocks and we're going to tell you what those trades are"
"10625080","10633300"," next are you following the half-time report podcast what are you waiting for look for us in your"

"10789190","10803710"," right we're back"
"10803710","10807130"," let's go through some of these committee moves I said we had today well that was that was quick"
"10807130","10812330"," McDonald's I said on the day that you bought it you almost cornered the burger market with Shake"
"10812330","10817190"," Shack and you needed just a couple of other names but now you you've sold McDonald's hit a stop"
"10817190","10822670"," loss on it yeah um did you think you've made this short time in this name so you hit it"
"10822670","10828470"," no you hit it on the nose when shap reported and just absolutely blew everyone away and all the"
"10828470","10832890"," upgrades started coming in I just said like if I want to hold this position at the size that it"
"10832890","10838150"," is I don't really need the McDonald's and McDonald's so I tightened the stop and I got I got"
"10838150","10841910"," knocked out of it so cut it down a couple of points more I bought it I think McDonald's will"
"10841910","10845510"," be fine this year I think it's gonna have a good year it's not a cheap stop but it shouldn't"
"10845510","10850110"," be it's one of the best executors in the space so I'm not bearish on McDonald's it's just a stop"
"10850110","10853830"," loss nb day what else do we want to do no I mean but Shake Shack by the way I"
"10853830","10858630"," mean you you can't almost talk about one I can't tell it's the it's the best it's just it just"
"10858630","10863550"," got upgraded to outperform again today at Cowan price target goes to 125 from 91 my friend so we"
"10863550","10870230"," just listen to me now and believe me later there is no company in this space that for me has"
"10870230","10876850"," the same amount of potential right now as Shaq has like Chipotle is better but that already that"
"10876850","10882330"," already actualized this is the one that hasn't it actualized and I don't want to own both of them I"
"10882330","10886410"," can't part with this thing think about what's been going on here they're growing now 20 percent a"
"10886410","10892650"," quarter okay so full stop there I don't can't think of another QSR play growing at that rate they"
"10892650","10897770"," can because it's only a few hundred stores they haven't had revenue growth under 17 percent since"
"10897770","10902930"," the first quarter of 2021 when they were still shaking off the pandemic they've gotten more"
"10902930","10908050"," profitable seven quarters ago they were losing money on that income basis now they're beating the"
"10908050","10912810"," street on a regular basis they just saw the best net income this past quarter since they came"
"10912810","10919130"," public and they're opening stores at a rapid pace and they're licensing to foreign operators in"
"10919130","10925010"," like 30 different countries this is the stock this is the stock so McDonald's is okay this is what"
"10925010","10930270"," this is what's popping in the street yeah moving a little bit now too uh you sold zoom tell me"
"10930270","10937210"," about that one stock tell tell listen they had a good earnings report it ran up and then it started"
"10937210","10942150"," to fall off and I just I said you know what life is too short so I only have x"
"10942150","10948590"," dollars that I want to uh that I want to allocate to tech and communication services I don't have"
"10948590","10954250"," any time for this one I think they'll be fine I think there is a potential for growth here and"
"10954250","10959290"," the multiple is like 12 times forward at this point so it's not an expensive stock I don't think"
"10959290","10963410"," there's a lot of risk it's just doing nothing it failed at 70 and I just looked at it and"
"10963410","10968130"," I said I have so many other things I would rather be doing right now than watching paint dry can"
"10968130","10974470"," I let me ask you this and this is purely anecdotal so maybe there is absolutely nothing to it the"
"10974470","10978730"," fact that I feel like I get many more and maybe you all feel the same way I don't know"
"10978730","10984750"," you get more teams invites than you do for zoom these days does that mean anything Google meet but"
"10984750","10989730"," that's why the stock is where it is it's in an 80% drawdown that's everyone gets that the story"
"10989730","10997150"," of zoom is can they can they become an enterprise provider for other things and just use the"

"11009710","11015230"," videos of commodity so they don't have to really compete with Microsoft they just have to wear"
"11015230","11020470"," sales for it says screw it let's buy it that's the that from my perspective that's what could"
"11020470","11025850"," happen with zoom the problem is the pace it's happening very very they're just not growing quickly"
"11025850","11030030"," okay brian belsky let's get the two moves quickly from you you up trimmed at your stake in home"
"11030030","11036670"," depot yeah why well we voted for 12 years it's been a core name in our big cap space we"

"13140310","13148100"," of these bulls right here so just be very careful likely a roll coming we can flush all these"
"13148100","13153580"," people out right here let me go over here to this trigger chart bull screen really quick just be"

"13165420","13172020"," this um it's a big old flush not guaranteed that it happens just be aware of it the VIX is"
"13172020","13180940"," trying to turn up right now just be conscience of it if you do get that break just like yesterday"
"13180940","13186880"," so if you're a long bull here right and you do get that break also remember like we talked about"
"13186880","13195780"," yesterday right you get the blast down your stops are down here right and then it comes right back"
"13195780","13204720"," up briefly that that's your actual exit is here make sense it's not down here so as you're getting"
"13204720","13209220"," blasted to the downside if that does happen i'm watching it right now it looks it looks ready for a"
"13209220","13220580"," because there's some kind of liquidation break maybe not but uh just be aware of it okay first"
"13220580","13225060"," and what we're going to do about the border everything else is just some sort of populist stance"
"13225060","13231260"," that's being taken for a for a speech now Kyle the the narrative has shifted a little bit more as"
"13231260","13236200"," you point out a lot of polling data seems to suggest that Americans are keying a lot more in on"
"13236200","13240440"," things like border security it used to be the kind of the economy front and center but now they're"
"13240440","13245640"," kind of running one two border and the economy slash inflation is there anything that you see"
"13245640","13253740"," developing message wise from both these sides because of the change heading into the election in"
"13253740","13258840"," november what are these candidates going to say and are these candidates tackling it the right way"
"13258840","13268120"," you know i'll get a little bit more technical here on the financial side the institutions that that"
"13268120","13273620"," are at the top of our country again fed and treasury on the on the financial side uh have their"
"13273620","13279520"," slush funds they have the ability to create an economy that feels good but it's actually not"
"13279520","13284580"," operating properly and i what i mean by that is the overnight reverse repo facility at the fed you"
"13284580","13289180"," know we're still we're still at about 800 billion dollars and they intend to run it to zero of"
"13289180","13296860"," course right into the election and i say that because we are all wondering why the economy hasn't"
"13296860","13303380"," slowed down uh and and i think the reason that's happening is you're seeing these fiscal"
"13303380","13309700"," authorities financial authorities push liquidity into the markets but again when i think about what"
"13309700","13315740"," we're looking for going forward when you think about border security the economy has to be when you"
"13315740","13320440"," think about the economy the economy has to be split into two categories one the economy when you"
"13320440","13325820"," look at the numbers when you look at real GDP as it's reported and you look at economic growth as"
"13325820","13330960"," it's reported and look at employment as it's reported it all actually looks fine but when you go to"
"13330960","13336840"," people's wallets and you realize that inflation disproportionately affects the poor in the lower"
"13336840","13344500"," middle class uh you've got a problem because we've seen roughly 45 47 percent true inflation over"
"13344500","13350040"," the last three years and the fed has only admitted to about 17 or 18 percent of that uh you"
"13350040","13354900"," can't chain weight you can't spend a chain weighted dollar people spend real dollars and what"
"13354900","13359680"," you're seeing in the ethnic minorities and you're seeing it in the lower socioeconomic groups"
"13359680","13365800"," they're all ranking inflation or the economy is kind of their number one uh issue and they're"
"13365800","13370920"," ranking border security as two and i think that's why you're seeing Biden poll so poorly right now"
"13370920","13374580"," it might be because a lot of those people have dealt with it one point in their life inflation"
"13374580","13379640"," themselves and their point of origin or their families have and that's the hypersensitivity i'd"
"13379640","13383200"," like to turn your attention more towards the kind of cross-section between politics and and the"
"13383200","13387860"," economy and the markets we're at a market that i just pointed out is at record highs for the s "
"13387860","13393240","&p 500 the NASDAQ is not far away from there as well it seems to indicate because the wisdom is"
"13393240","13398480"," Kyle that the markets are forward looking they're pricing in something down the line right today"
"13398480","13405280"," that's promoting some kind of optimism is that optimism warranted in your mind and are these"
"13405280","13411080"," candidates president trump president biden the two of them together the best people one or the"
"13411080","13418260"," other because it's going to happen that way to lead this economy into the next leg that it has i"
"13418260","13423660"," mean look if you're talking about the economy the economy plain and simple uh then the answer is"
"13423660","13428760"," you know trump's better than Biden if you're talking about these two people being the best the us"
"13428760","13433860"," has to offer i think we both know the answer to that one Dominic and then their boat we we"
"13433860","13437660"," are better than this as a country but unfortunately these are these are the people we're left with"
"13437660","13445780"," um what when you think about um yeah i just i i think that that we're talking about leading our"
"13445780","13452200"," country into what's happening forward and i think between trump and biden i think it has to be"
"13452200","13460640"," trump because i think obviously we all know what biden's uh weaknesses are on his on his ability to"
"13460640","13469960"," be coherent and and actually answer questions in in interviews and deal with the country in the way"
"13469960","13474480"," that he has in the last few years that would be a disaster for our country right we've let over"
"13474480","13480100"," three million people in in the last year unchecked we we're we're kind of letting the enemy get"
"13480100","13484880"," behind the gates and at some point in time something bad is going to happen on the economy and the"
"13484880","13490420"," markets uh i think the market's doing what it should do given the enormous level of liquidity"
"13490420","13496120"," that's being pumped into it i actually think think you might see a reverse effect if you remember"
"13496120","13503660"," when trump won in 2016 the markets really sold off in the futures uh right after the event but then"
"13503660","13508480"," by the morning time they had recovered everything and and actually had a giant rally once people"
"13508480","13513580"," figured out he would be positive for the economy i actually think the the reverse could happen i"
"13513580","13519200"," think so much liquidity has been pumped into this market and it will have going into november that"
"13519200","13524640"," regardless of who wins once that liquidity dries up i think i think markets will actually take a"
"13524640","13530160"," pause and probably have a down move post-election regardless of who wins you know what kyle uh one"
"13530160","13534380"," of the things that fed chair j paul told congress over the last couple of days and specifically"
"13534380","13539900"," today is that the us is fairing better than just about every other advanced economy in the world"
"13539900","13544940"," out there and one of those is china which is the second biggest economy in the world there is no"
"13544940","13548840"," doubt if you look at any of the data they can sugarcoat it all they want but china is nowhere"
"13548840","13553540"," near as good as the us is right now you've been hyper critical of china in the past i wonder"
"13553540","13558700"," if you can tell us whether or not you think that chinese's story has played out enough to the"
"13558700","13565160"," downside versus what we're seeing here in the us yeah i don't think so i think investing in"
"13565160","13572300"," communism long term has never worked and let's just go back and look at msci china's index in the"
"13572300","13578680"," last 30 years if you invested in the msci china index you're at breakeven you haven't made a penny"
"13578680","13588600"," think about that in the last 15 years china's economy has grown reportedly 500 gdp and if you"
"13588600","13595460"," invested in the shang shang high shins and 300 index 15 years ago you've lost a third of your money"
"13595460","13603540"," imagine investing in an economy that's grown 500 and losing a third of your money i mean it doesn't"
"13603540","13608600"," matter if it's quote played out or we might have a dead cat bounce or shizhing ping might say"
"13608600","13614900"," something about stimulating the economy and it might have a a week or two or a month or two of"
"13614900","13620360"," gains in the long run westerners are going to get fleeced investing in china and you say i've been"
"13620360","13625820"," critical i've just been honest about what you're going to get and in the end you see what you're"
"13625820","13632060"," going to get in the last 15 years 30 years you're actually not making a penny and you're taking"
"13632060","13638980"," enormous additional risks by investing in a communist party that's a that is a party driven market"
"13638980","13644300"," all right kyle we know that china is not on the top of your investing ideas list can you take"
"13644300","13649620"," us through what exactly is the top investing idea that you have permeating around your world right"
"13649620","13656500"," now you know i think anything that is a productive asset specifically in the u.s like again i go"
"13656500","13666460"," back to quoting the facts you know the u.s is grown including dividends"
"13666460","13672220"," and we have a rule of law and we have the deepest most liquid capital markets in the world so"
"13672220","13678000"," when you think about what you want to invest in again i think things will slow down post-election"
"13678000","13686240"," for a while and i think that any kind of asset that's a productive asset in the u.s i"
"13686240","13690700"," think whether you're looking at apartments or whether you're looking at income producing companies"
"13690700","13695420"," that focus their business in the u.s or from our perspective i think you want to get in front"
"13695420","13700300"," of demographic trends and i think you want to buy real estate in states where you see a migration"
"13700300","13707920"," from high cost high tax mismanaged states to the states that are pro business lower cost in no tax"
"13707920","13713620"," like florida tennessee in texas you want to get in front of those macro population demographic"
"13713620","13719640"," moves and you know you want to buy real estate in areas that you think over the next decade is"
"13719640","13726220"," going to do really well and again whether that's income producing real estate or even rural land in"
"13726220","13730620"," areas that you think you're going to see expansion into i that's where i'm that's where we're"
"13730620","13734500"," putting all of our capital all right kyle it's a much longer conversation we'll have to have at"
"13734500","13738300"," some point in a much longer format thank you very much kyle for your thoughts we'll see you soon"
"13738300","13746560"," sir i best all right well the latest economic data is showing jobless claims staying at 217 000"

"13752220","13757240"," workers starting to feel the pinch of layoffs joining me now with some clues about tomorrow's jobs"
"13757240","13762920"," report is evan sewn chairman of recruiter.com evan thank you very much for being here with us uh"
"13762920","13767160"," you heard kyle bass and some of the economic commentary he has with regard to what's happening in"
"13767160","13773140"," the u.s right now there are problems there's no doubt about it but largely the economy the job side"
"13773140","13780680"," specifically has been awesome what gives and is it going to turn lower anytime soon yeah you know"
"13780680","13785960"," uh look the job market still remains incredibly tight and there are a lot of factors going on uh"
"13785960","13791320"," the first is that you know the rapid quit rates that we saw during covid have really really come"
"13791320","13797140"," back to pre-covid levels yet there's a whole population of people and in the recruiter index i"
"13797140","13802720"," think 42 percent of the candidates that the recruiters are speaking to had two jobs uh over the"
"13802720","13807620"," past two years so do you really want to have that third one i think not so there's going to"
"13807620","13813500"," be this reluctance to actually quit unless of course there's a reason and this reason that we just"
"13813500","13818240"," showed on that slide is we actually saw we used to look at compensation and management as being the"
"13818240","13822820"," reason that people were looking to leave but other really came up you know what is other other is"
"13822820","13827840"," whether they're scared whether there's a layoff coming there's some other reason that's getting a"
"13827840","13832100"," candidate to look to leaving their job maybe they're worried about uh ai maybe they're worried"
"13832100","13837080"," about contract labor and we're seeing those sort of those sort of hints and clues that's going to"
"13837080","13843440"," affect the overall job economy the the tech trade specifically and finance banks and whatnot we've"
"13843440","13848680"," heard some commentary some illusions if you will to this idea that companies are pivoting resources"
"13848680","13853980"," away from certain areas of the business towards things like artificial intelligence is that playing"
"13853980","13859780"," out in some of the numbers that you have as well absolutely we have a partnership with aura and in"
"13859780","13868880"," the aura report we saw a real serious jump in ai related roles in february is the tide turning in"
"13868880","13874820"," the job market ai jobs in february what evan sewn is saying up 16.7 percent in january demand"
"13874820","13879800"," rising to spite layoffs and tech firm swapping out staff for those with more desirable skills"
"13879800","13887400"," increase in all industries layoffs and tech but not ai is the statement that's being made right now"
"13887400","13897180"," there's actually uh not only that there's uh wage increases in ai as well and machine learning"
"13897180","13907300"," and robotics i'm gonna turn that off right there turn that off right there i'm"
"13907300","13911780"," fascinated to see if uh if we ask you guys a question in the chat right now let me bring"
"13911780","13919020"," this read with your chat let me ask you guys a question do you think we do you think that"
"13919020","13924220"," uh the volatility has gone away so we're not going to get the roll down off of this supply right"
"13924220","13927800"," now do you think it'll be like violent to the downside you think we'll just keep grinding higher"
"13927800","13933720"," i'm fascinated by that right now if that's the case we just keep grinding higher and just eat"
"13933720","13939020"," through all of that supply do you guys understand the concept of the question i'm asking you guys"
"13939020","13947180"," here do you think it's grind higher yeah i can i can be open to that um like when we"
"13947180","13954800"," have the volatility uh we will like win to these um resistance areas and usually sell down and we"
"13954800","13958840"," didn't do that today right we came into local resistance and just stayed there and grinded and then"
"13958840","13968720"," started moving higher hello can you guys hear me okay sorry i'm over here"
"13968720","13978340"," messing with stuff in the background yeah momo hammer on the uh on the daily"
"13978340","13984460"," shorts are hooked from last night yeah they're fucked right now aren't they um you know a whole"
"13984460","13988760"," bunch of people got blown out right basically got blown out uh two days ago right it's just this"
"13988760","14001120"," continuation of it at this point that whole hedge comes off if you're not"
"14001120","14005740"," seeing it done pair i was thinking there might be and then i was like yeah maybe not like um"
"14005740","14012760"," the vol is rolling off so there might not be that like violent reversal to the downside i thought"
"14012760","14016760"," there might be but i'm like i don't know there's not much vol left i guess there could be towards"
"14016760","14022840"," the close uh for the for the date of tomorrow but you know the date of tomorrow reminds me of"
"14022840","14029300"," um the date of tomorrow reminds me of uh we had what we had some other vol event that was"
"14029300","14035640"," expected and it was like something small and people like built it up to be something it's like we"
"14035640","14042180"," came down into that uh vent and then they sold the vol before the actual event um the night before"
"14042180","14046760"," like the close or something and before the event even took place it was like we got some bad news"
"14046760","14051720"," it was recently like a week ago and even though it was badish news we had already come down into"
"14051720","14057700"," that bad news so we kind of just ripped it was like one quick red bar down and then just"
"14057700","14064880"," straight up again so i mean we just went and that's the key point terrors all right with"
"14064880","14073520"," simplifying it i mean we just had volatility into the senate hearing how does that compare to the"
"14073520","14081480"," news we have coming tomorrow right if you're at a way all of this stuff if you're at a way"
"14081480","14091380"," um hold on here that one quick thing to do here if you're at a way like the"
"14091380","14098820"," senate hearing versus non-farms tomorrow right put a weight to that there's probably people out"
"14098820","14103080"," there like hey you got non-farm payroll though tomorrow you know we can we can crash over that"
"14103080","14108300"," alone and i'm like yeah how do you weigh non-farm payroll versus uh senate hearing with Jerome"
"14108300","14117100"," Powell that is has the potential to be very volatile right and even then uh Kennedy was uh Kennedy"
"14117100","14123940"," Elizabeth Elizabeth Warren um who else was uh to leave i think it was yesterday there were moments"
"14123940","14128280"," where uh they could have introduced volatility to the market and they just the market just kind of"
"14128280","14135220"," brushed it off so i mean maybe we do but maybe maybe maybe non-farms come out it's terrible but"
"14135220","14145120"," um so uh so sparky jackets is sparky jacks saying there's definitely a"
"14145120","14152440"," setup for a short term move down here i thought so i or that my original thought up here looking"

"15331480","15341880"," going on here we got some weirdness going on interview interview give me one quick second folks so"
"15341880","15349780"," i think i'm off to the side intentionally uh hold on here yeah i think what i was doing was"
"15351920","15360220"," to bring some of this back i think we were having some issues with being able to see yeah i"
"15360220","15366840"," think last time we had issues was because uh at a cost stuff to break down on yours you know"
"15366840","15372520"," what i'm going to do i'm going to like uh increase my size if i can yeah they can make"
"15372520","15379420"," my size smaller here oh i'm talking about my screen so it's like a little bit more readable oh baby"
"15379420","15386340"," there we go i got you covered brother gotcha i got you covered right here you're good all right"
"15386340","15390500"," well then we can go back all right so this is what i was talking about like ball looks really"
"15390500","15398520"," weird so this is the term structure of um the spx complex right now and the red lines the red"
"15398520","15405340"," areas mean that for that strike and x-free combo of all is lower than it has been on a"
"15405340","15410160"," 60 that looked like the mean and it has like a z-score associated with it so like this is"
"15410160","15416680"," half a standard deviation below the mean um from where it's been the last 60 days green means it's"
"15416680","15424320"," above so what's really interesting for today's x-bury right around 51 55 like all of this red is"
"15424320","15428700"," what you're seeing is they're selling calls here they're selling puts here at this strike so that"
"15428700","15434600"," you know we cut this is kind of like pinning behavior around here all the wild wild market pumps um"
"15434600","15442780"," and at the same time you see the rest of the strikes upside downside across you know pretty much"
"15442780","15448560"," the entire term structure um you have all going up so turn speaking of term structure let's look at"
"15448560","15458070"," that vol is higher than 90th percentile going into the 12th so the 90th"
"15458070","15467290"," percentile was 12.38 we are above it um at 12.95 vol for that implied vol for that day"
"15467290","15473390"," and if i compare this to let's say one more day like one day behind it's about the same so"
"15473390","15481050"," let me actually remove that and go back to monday uh where it was on monday let's add that and"
"15481050","15488270"," you guys have one quick question just what heads up folks that we are coming into our three on spy"
"15488270","15498130"," uh the next level for uh spx is 51 75 yeah interesting also i want to add the call wall"
"15498130","15506470"," on spx rolled up today from 51 50 to 5200 call wall on spy is still 5 15 we had"
"15506470","15513990"," the 52 hundred yesterday uh as the roll up oh it was yesterday i yeah i was focusing on mnq"
"15513990","15519150"," like i've been trading futures a lot uh just because i want to get good at it yeah it's just"
"15519150","15523650"," find it to be a little bit easier to scout and options because i don't have to worry about theta"
"15523650","15528650"," decay and it's a little bit easier to hold you know you have a defined risk you have there defined"
"15528650","15536950"," upside i like it i see why david ams does it and somebody who i really respect and admire told"
"15536950","15543230"," me he goes like you look at all these guys who are like pro traders they don't trade options they"
"15543230","15548150"," trade futures so that's what the big boys do and you need to like you know learn that skill so"
"15548150","15553670"," like all right you know i can do that i'm big micros so just to learn get the ropes not"
"15553670","15558750"," risking too much money not making a lot too but you know it's good it's it's a good learning"
"15558750","15564570"," experience but anyways well we're gonna we're gonna add in um we're gonna add uh david in right now"
"15566030","15573530"," the master go on here we've got david here david just heads up you're on the screen brother all"
"15573530","15581430"," right how you doing my man hey doing good you guys excellent i was having dinner and i got thing"
"15581430","15588330"," that you guys are looking for me so thought it was it was just listening to trader podcasting um"
"15588330","15596410"," about futures i agree with that yeah it's it's been an interesting experience uh so far for me um"
"15596410","15604910"," and i'm enjoying trading futures um and it's it's you know overall it's been it's it's been"
"15604910","15614410"," an exercise in finding precision yeah you know i was always fighting and trying to figure out a way"
"15614410","15620170"," to trade options but you know the thing is is that once you you figure out how to work with"
"15620170","15625850"," these futures it's just you don't have anything against you except for your entry and your stop"
"15625850","15633450"," right exactly and finding that entry is the skill yeah that that's what i meant by precision but"
"15633450","15641650"," i'm finding that my skills and my methods as an options trader are translating fairly well except"
"15641650","15647530"," for like getting the entry just right so you know it's every day we try to improve right like"
"15647530","15654990"," that's the that's the goal as a trader um yeah i've i've taken profits once i am long again from"
"15654990","15661670"," uh 276 so i am happy right now i want to take a hundred points on these few micros that"
"15661670","15669350"," i hold and yeah perfect yeah my goal is today is actually 390 that might be a little bit ambitious"
"15669350","15677170"," but i will get to why i have always been a bull on the show cap knows this a lot"
"15677170","15682130"," of people who know me on reddit know this i am unabashedly a bull when the time is right and"
"15682130","15687510"," i've been saying cap said this once a few months ago and i kind of internalized it because i"
"15687510","15691890"," believed in it too but he said it very succinctly which is that all time highs are made with"
"15691890","15699910"," volatility and i don't like volatility being down while we're grinding up i do not like that"
"15699910","15705010"," because that just means it's gonna like at some point just tap out but the way this whole rally has"
"15705010","15711010"," been has been an exercise in keeping an eye on volatility on one hand and keeping an eye on options"
"15711010","15716530"," positioning on the other hand so what i was just talking about uh what's on the screen right now if"
"15716530","15723250"," you guys can see this is the term structure for today as of right now compared to the gray line"
"15723250","15731210"," which is how it was which is slot volatility on monday and it is significantly higher i like seeing"
"15731210","15737310"," this i like seeing this because this means there's a lot of juice in the market and as as an"
"15737310","15742750"," options trader you really like that as a future trader you kind of don't like it because you know"
"15742750","15747890"," again you have to manage your entries and exits in a in a good way and i'm still learning that"
"15747890","15755930"," skill but anyways um this is something i wanted like when when cat was talking about volatility and"
"15755930","15760410"," people were talking about vix is grinding up vix is grinding up because yeah volatility across the"
"15760410","15769910"," chain is up remember vix is only the way it's calculated it is a measure of puts and calls"
"15769910","15779730"," and their cost from a 23 to 37 day period so if it's close to today's date it's not going"
"15779730","15784610"," to kind of ask me at least 23 days out and only 237 days out and that's how vix is"
"15784610","15789630"," calculated and so you can general terms this is kind of like how the calculation is done that's why"
"15789630","15794930"," you see usually on monday's vix goes up just because of the calculation because it's calendar days"
"15794930","15801370"," and not training days so vix going up i like seeing that because that means people are interested"
"15801370","15806290"," in protecting money further up than today like you know 30 days out they're interested in"
"15806290","15811290"," protecting their money um we have new support just now too right we've got support at 51.50 now"
"15811290","15820210"," don't we but yeah so a little bit no remember now we are entering that zone i talked about the"
"15820210","15825830"," last time i was on here which was a week ago last thursday and when we talked about it i"
"15825830","15833190"," showed a chart that showed there was some numeras um volatility desk and the volatility research"
"15833190","15842490"," desk and they basically said that there are pockets of dealer short gamma that we are uh that we"
"15842490","15848790"," had just reversed after that big rally and there was pockets um where because dealers are short"
"15848790","15853730"," gamma in order to hedge that short gamma they're going to buy calls higher up driving the market"
"15853730","15863550"," even further up themselves so that they can remain um hedged as much as possible now we are in that"
"15863550","15870810"," window right now we got into that window as soon as we cross 51.25 and that's why we've seen"
"15870810","15878210"," this whipsaw action up i am of the belief that today and tomorrow are going to be giga squeezes"
"15878210","15884710"," like it's shaping up right now like we had a big fat trend day developing and i think it keeps"
"15884710","15891410"," going for a while and then the second thing i wanted like highlight is i'm going to put it up"
"15891410","15901370"," this is the current overlay or chart i shared this last time i was on here and i had"
"15901370","15909270"," pointed out that this blue line is the 1960s line and we've been tracking it pretty closely now as"
"15909270","15916050"," a reminder for people who have not been here um though that were not here last week the way i"
"15916050","15922090"," calculate this line the way i calculate everything for this chart i have a window rolling window"
"15922090","15929690"," 101 days and then i go back and look at spx closing prices all the way to 1929 and i"
"15929690","15936830"," find all the windows 101 day windows across all of those time periods all of that time period that"
"15936830","15943750"," are highly correlated to the last 100 day one price action then i run a statistical test called the"
"15943750","15950630"," Granger causality test against my current time series and each of these candidate time series and"
"15950630","15957530"," then out of that only if they are significant to the 0.001 level which is one and one thousand"
"15957530","15964110"," error level you know i have really high data that i calculate for this only then did they get put"
"15964110","15970990"," into this put into this plot and i only show the top seven correlations that are statistically"
"15970990","15975910"," significant so this blue line is what we've been following we've been tracking it very closely this"
"15975910","15981750"," has been my load start and it basically says we're we're gonna squeeze today and tomorrow"
"15983290","15989190"," corroborated by the fact that we are in a short gamma window so we could squeeze to 520 by tomorrow"
"15989190","15998570"," and this would fulfill this predictive um path of this blue line but notice after that there's a"
"15998570","16004490"," big sharp correction over the next like so each of these cells is 10 days wide so over the next"
"16004490","16010490"," five six days it says it is a correction all the other major ones or all the other major correlated"
"16010490","16019610"," lines except for the green line all of them point towards a dip to begin the week next week"
"16019610","16027550"," and that is what is really interesting to me that if we actually get that big big ginormous squeeze"
"16027550","16034370"," that that's our blow off top and then we get into like the sharp correction and then maybe chop"
"16034370","16041330"," sideways for a couple of months before you know seasonality kicks in again so i thought we had"
"16041330","16047570"," until the 11th so you're saying say this one more time so you're saying squeeze today tomorrow uh"
"16047570","16054630"," pull back on monday and then what one more squeeze or no no bullback on i'm saying the pullback"
"16054630","16061870"," starts the correction starts like monday so again these are not exactly 100% predicted right so"
"16061870","16068230"," yeah use this chart i kind of look at all the highly correlated previous price action and try and"
"16068230","16073030"," see if a lot of them are telling me to go one way or the other way right yep so"
"16073030","16079950"," everything has been telling me this is going up right the magnitude of if it's going up that"
"16079950","16086990"," depends remains to be seen but every like the price was going up like right yep till about today"
"16086990","16092930"," instead i've got i've got till the 11th i've got the date this morning we discussed it in laster"
"16092930","16099310"," and i said we've got pretty much until the 11th so the 11th is monday yeah that's monday so this"
"16099310","16103590"," is in line with the same thoughts that we all have here and the vol surface all of it is"
"16103590","16111150"," yeah yeah so um i i am not so my my play like i'm long right now i'm happy long"
"16111150","16116170"," till tomorrow i am too i'm long as well yeah and but then what i'm going to do probably friday"
"16116170","16120930"," close is i'm probably going to start opening quitsprads up and i'm going to start opening i've put"
"16120930","16127830"," spreads for op-x and sorry sorry for um monthn for quarterlies and then what i'm also going to look"
"16127830","16135370"," at very very carefully is i am going to well i've already started a couple of positions um i am"
"16135370","16142090"," also going to be looking through short uh smh so i might get soxis shares or if i feel really"
"16142090","16149490"," degenerate i might do like uh um i might do like calls on soxis um because that's looking fairly"
"16149490","16158290"," overextended uh i have gone long energy um and i've gone long utilities and that is again like i"
"16158290","16163870"," post this little digesting i don't know if you see that i post this yeah we say that or yeah"
"16163870","16169870"," so i posted in the discord and if you look at this chart right here this is all the stocks"
"16169870","16179310"," in their respective ETFs and how many of them are above their uh 20 50 200 SMAs and i want"
"16179310","16189250"," to bring your um eyes down to um excel you utilities right um they're they seem to have"
"16189250","16194450"," bottomed in this year they're starting to get above their 20 SMAs they're yeah they were buying it"
"16194450","16198850"," a few days ago or even before you put the pullback they were buying it for like five sessions or"
"16198850","16204530"," seven sessions at that point right yeah yeah and you know i noticed it last week that it's saying i"
"16204530","16210350"," should have the value guys are starting to like get into this which means a rotation is coming who"
"16210350","16218630"," buys who buys utilities in a roaring bull market nobody when people start buying when funds not"
"16218630","16225570"," utilities you know we're coming to the top we've been talking about everybody's been so bearish on"
"16225570","16230750"," this and i'm like no we're riding this sucker up i'm not there i'm not a bearish person in general"
"16230750","16238690"," um but i understand when there's an opportunity when the actual window weakness opens right so to"
"16238690","16248410"," me i'm not waiting to lock i think the window opens like starting for a nice correction"
"16248410","16255990"," and so i'm trying to take advantage of that um if i'm not allocating my entire port to this i"
"16255990","16262230"," am gonna i have been raising cash while selling into this market because it's been fun riding all a"
"16262230","16267810"," lot of these um a lot of these tickers from like the lows from like you know a year ago"
"16267810","16271370"," and you know now i don't have to for a lot of them i don't have to worry about the"
"16271370","16279630"," extra tax um issues so i can like start trimming my position and uh you know take advantage of what"
"16279630","16284810"," the market has given me i don't want to be too greedy so at this point that's what i'm thinking"
"16284810","16291050"," there's also this whole conversation around seasonality of uh marked seasonality is really bad"
"16291050","16297650"," towards the end of the month yada yada yada so there's that aspect to it too um so yeah that's"
"16297650","16303410"," kind of like where i'm thinking what i really think i really wanted to just kind of bring back the"
"16303410","16309810"," overlayer because i updated every day uh at the end of the day this is i updated an intraday today"
"16309810","16315070"," just to kind of have it for this conversation but this is the squeeze that i was hoping for and"
"16315070","16320930"," i'm getting and then everything is kind of telling me like if okay so so here's the other thing to"
"16320930","16326450"," let me get back to why the short gamma window is important because if you rip through that window"
"16326450","16331410"," and we get to the other side so dealers have already now made their money because they bought"
"16331410","16338450"," upside calls to this thing as soon as those calls get monetized and these are you know some of"
"16338450","16346350"," these expirries are for uh quarterly opx some of them are for um aprils uh on the upside but then"
"16346350","16352230"," yesterday we got a whole bunch of put spreads open for opx as well so and not only did they"
"16352230","16356690"," open in spy they also opened in spx at the same time so that's what's really interesting the"
"16356690","16361110"," dynamic is what i'm starting to see like positioning changes starting to happen and now of course i"
"16361110","16367950"," get data after the fact um i can't see like that kind of dealer positioning um unless you know no"
"16367950","16373970"," more puts out a note or whatnot and so uh what's that's starting to tell me is that the the"
"16373970","16379790"," turn is starting to come and we should be um and i should be cautious at this point as a"
"16379790","16388890"," vote zero dt hero asks podcast thank you for your insight also what is your upside target for today"
"16388890","16397369"," all signals asking for a target number two he's on twitter asking for today no you're an upside"
"16397369","16406750"," target of 520 520 spy for tomorrow like another like"
"16406750","16413070"," point eight percent from here or so where are we on spy we are on five one five yes i"
"16413070","16419630"," just just about a percent tomorrow that'll make me happy five one five was my target for today and"
"16419630","16429590"," we're above it so and as far as positioning is concerned i had uh yesterday about one bte spy"
"16429590","16436910"," calls um i ate shit on them but i held them for today and i cashed out at five thirteen"
"16436910","16443250"," for about forty percent gain um i have five on five so tomorrow and i can tell you exactly how"
"16443250","16452460"," much i am up on them like i believe in this play so um i am i am 135"
"16452460","16461240"," up on them so um yeah and the other thing i'm long on is t l t i think we"
"16461240","16471060"," might see a return of treasure bonds up equities down the way it used to be the bogle"
"16471060","16477540"," head scenario of 1640 like that's what it's based on um they've been they've been positively"
"16477540","16485419"," correlated for the recent time being but being long treasuries is not a bad idea in my opinion"
"16485419","16491700"," right now as equities kind of like deal with this exogenous shock of you know positioning rolling"
"16491700","16496919"," off yeah that's kind of like where i am what i'm thinking but i'm happy to take any other questions"
"16496919","16505779"," or if david ams you have any insights from the way you see um uh you know price levels and"
"16505779","16513340"," targets i'd be happy to hear that as well and add that into my mental calculus yeah yeah the thing"
"16513340","16519020"," with me is it's it's like i really look at from session to session um i don't know if i'm"
"16519020","16526400"," able to share my screen a bit here where you can see my way of thinking of how i operate"
"16526400","16534619"," hold on one second see if i can present cap can i present my screen yes of course not to"
"16534619","16543070"," share a window oh okay can you not share it oh yeah brother here we go we're gonna get some"
"16543070","16551950"," sauce going in here there you go all right okay um look there's not much that i have on my"
"16551950","16558220"," charts and the thing is i i do have one projection um but you know i posted on my ex"
"16558220","16563480"," already what my thoughts were on Aztec and you know those targets are all the way up to 21,000"
"16563480","16567900"," so i'm hitting that that constantly towards that but the thing is you get corrections in this"
"16567900","16573560"," entire process so i take it day by day and session myself yeah they'll try to pin your head on"
"16573560","16577460"," your david and say you said this but it pulled back they don't they never talk they never talk"
"16577460","16581960"," about that or they don't want to talk about uh pull back in the way that you're going or the"
"16581960","16588560"," direction you're heading yeah but you can let me you can see my screen right um i posted this our"
"16588560","16597460"," time frame analysis in december 16 and we were trading around 16,000 and i said after holding the"
"16597460","16602360"," optimal trade on 300 monthly chart expect all time ison and the ex we're higher targets above in a"
"16602360","16608279"," few years well i'm not labeling a time span i because i have no idea what happens if someone throws"
"16608279","16614400"," off a bomb you know deck and uh mess things up i've got 6,000 in the year man uh"
"16614400","16621500"," maybe maybe march but i've got well that 5960 i've got no well what i did is quite simple we"
"16621500","16629060"," had a covid low and we had a all-time high that was made and there's a system that i"
"16629060","16635119"," trade with optimal trade entries where i look for entries and and all we had and the low of the"
"16635759","16641419"," was a correction to the optimal trade entry for a continuation move up and that move can go up to"
"16641419","16648060"," 36,000 and i don't know how long it will take to develop so once i realized that i put"
"16648060","16653840"," on my bull hat um up until we get two of these all-time highs and once we break above"
"16653840","16660300"," i will do a continuation move to 21,000 on ndx now let's press play and see what happened and"
"16660300","16670020"," where we are we're already a third of the way okay so in my job for myself is to buy"
"16670020","16676180"," every dip i can every big correction that we get i still expect somehow that we might be able to"
"16676180","16683400"," get like a pullback to the previous all-time high at some point um you know to reaccumulate for a"
"16683400","16689619"," continuation move up but when and how i have no idea and it doesn't matter so what happened"
"16689619","16699099"," yesterday um look these are highs that we have here to me they're equal highs right um i see them"
"16699099","16706419"," and use them as targets so any move down it's suspicious for me and i will start hunting for places"
"16706419","16716279"," for entries or to target to when we're in"
"16716279","16723360"," area where i started to book for longs again and they ripped us back up now there's another thing"
"16723360","16730400"," that i look for always i always look for around tuesday or wednesday for the low of the week to"
"16730400","16735740"," be made as you know cap i always tell you you know at that point you can take along and"
"16735740","16741860"," hold that position up until the close on thursday right so and the reason why i say thursday"
"16741860","16749640"," especially tomorrow because we have nfb and you don't know what's going to come out of it and but"
"16749640","16757099"," we've also seen that if these numbers are not as expected this entire move up can be reversed in"
"16757099","16766680"," seconds so i am never in a position on that time i trade after the event because what they will"
"16766680","16774340"," do is go back to the ski levels and retest them and if you have outlined them and it does"
"16774340","16779640"," as expected where it reaches a specific level you can join the party in whichever way they're going"
"16779640","16785580"," to go because the market movements that they do is seeking liquidity especially in those areas"
"16785580","16792360"," where they trap traders and then rip their face off either direction whichever way it might go now"
"16792360","16798400"," there was one thing that i was expecting to be taken out and to be honest i thought we were"
"16798400","16804180"," going to take last week blow out right and it did it and there's a level that i keep on"
"16804180","16810260"," my chart and that is last tuesday's low which i use as reference because they try to fake out below"
"16810260","16819020"," it but if we stay above that level i'm still bullish so what did they do on the fifth they"
"16819020","16825680"," went down and they broke back above and they made that low so i had that one but the prior"
"16825680","16835480"," one we broke back above now they pressed it up up until wednesday and then thursday"
"16835480","16841680"," if you see they pressed it down here so we made our low on tuesday as i would expect that"
"16841680","16848300"," to happen and then after we broke out that aggressive move something has to trigger me in looking"
"16848300","16857300"," into longs again right so what area do i want to participate from now we call these optimal trade"
"16857300","16861600"," entries and the same thing what you saw on NASDAQ where i did that from the covid low to the"
"16861600","16868940"," all-time high that was there the same thing works on this swing here so i already had this area"
"16868940","16875740"," marked out for myself in an area where i would like to participate for a long to retarget these"
"16875740","16882460"," highs up here and of course i don't know if the move will continue or not but we need to"
"16882460","16888700"," break above and hold now there's an important element in my trading system that i use and it's very"
"16888700","16896580"," powerful i only operate every four hours and other than that i'm out of it and my foundation is the"
"16896580","16903100"," asian session highs and then london and what i look for is the asian session ranges to either be"
"16903100","16908760"," breached or where stops get taken out so i mark the highest high and the lowest low that is between"
"16908760","16916960"," atm and midnight near your time then i wait the four-hour candle opens up and the first move down"
"16916960","16924220"," is the fake move because smart money starts accumulating below or above the opening line to trap"
"16924220","16930640"," traders and then mean reverted later when the cash opens of london so what did they do in this case"
"16930640","16936400"," they didn't breach the high of the asian session that is this yellow line here i'm going to circle"
"16936400","16943180"," it with with an arrow or put an arrow here see here they pressed it down so what are they"
"16943180","16947940"," doing on this move down you know if they want to go up what do you think smart money's going"
"16947940","16952740"," to do they're not going to accumulate on the way up right so they need to press it down and"
"16952740","16957580"," start accumulating now there wasn't an important level that was held because we have this fair"
"16957580","16962560"," value gap here in this consolidation area here and we had an optimal trade entry where they stopped"
"16962560","16968960"," it to the tick well i knew the night before already where you know i was going to maybe participate"
"16968960","16976060"," for lones now the thing is with london is they trap you a lot of times they make the fake"
"16976060","16980900"," move and everyone's going short here thinking now we're going to really go down and we're going to"
"16980900","16986020"," touch that sell side well the only thing i really do is i jump onto a one-minute chart or"
"16986020","16991200"," a 30-second chart and i will show you what it looks like i wait for these setups and these"
"16991200","16996320"," sweeps of these important levels that i have marked out ahead of time and that always happen daily"
"16996320","17003160"," every single day and they keep repeating and it's just consistent so you're looking for a fake"
"17003160","17011960"," breakdown sweep to get long or or to take the opposite mean traversing train exactly yeah and i do"
"17011960","17017160"," it every single day and it just keeps repeating it does it on the long side i'm on the short"
"17017160","17025200"," side it doesn't matter it's like it's insane you know it's i mean i got a changing schedule for"
"17025200","17031960"," this yeah well you know i don't get yes sir and you know you can see in the discord what"
"17031960","17038280"," i did i think i posted my entire interactive brokers um charts where i entered and you can see that"
"17038280","17044360"," i you know on this push down i just started pressing the buy button i bought my 15 contracts and"
"17044360","17049020"," i said you know because i you know i've been doing this for a while so oftentimes david is in"
"17049020","17055680"," the discord alone trading and both of us are like why is nobody here right now yeah and look at"
"17055680","17060360"," the beautiful thing and the beautiful thing what they did is they took out the daily sell side of"
"17060360","17065000"," the previous day now what is the beautiful thing what i'm telling you right now about that four "
"17065000","17071340","-hour chart right if you open it the opening line or wherever they close the first move down is a"
"17071340","17076480"," fake move because they need to accumulate look they're accumulating not for four hours right"
"17076480","17081440"," they're accumulating for an entire day most of the time so they press it down and why do they press"
"17081440","17087980"," it down they go to the previous four-hour opening area recheck that area accumulate longs and you"
"17087980","17094140"," know the weird thing about it was and i use book map and i have my cvd on and you"
"17094140","17099020"," know we were pressing down and down and down and down i mean mind you this is not like a"
"17099020","17103980"," small move and you can short it because like my trading buddy um who's not active on social media"
"17103980","17110040"," or anything he short is but like nasa they press it down 50 points you know that's a lot so"
"17110040","17115620"," if you start going long here you're fucked you know you can't do that so that's why you really need"
"17115620","17121040"," to wait for those sweeps and then this beautiful pattern emerges where i wait for a bear for a"
"17121040","17128500"," value if i got too unfold and the minute i see a candle closure above it i'm long now you"
"17128500","17133840"," see this also happening on the 30-second chart or on a 15-second chart even my eyes are trained"
"17133840","17139200"," on these type of moves so i can take them really at the lower lower end of everything that happens"
"17139200","17145940"," right so um over time you know if you study it enough you will you will see it happening so"
"17145940","17151820"," now i'm going to a 15-second chart and you see what i mean and it's subtle so i get"
"17151820","17159920"," in on this arrows and these places here right because look what they do i'm going to take off this"
"17159920","17167100"," red box here and make the smaller one so i mark this one here because this one overlaps the asian"
"17167100","17176160"," low that is here minute they break out from this consolidation area here right with a candle"
"17176160","17181600"," closure it's a go for me so they jump up and they break that mid and then i just go"
"17181600","17189760"," i just yeah that's interesting yeah so like yeah i would be in my world i would call that like"
"17189760","17195740"," the zones that you just made i would call them supply uh demand zones right uh yeah you could call"
"17195740","17200680"," them whatever you want you know if it's like literally you wear it for a gap yeah if there's so"
"17200680","17205440"," many names for them but like you know it's the same concept exactly yeah yeah it's it's the process"
"17205440","17210340"," that remains the same yeah you saw a break and you saw a base and then you like it went"
"17210340","17217300"," yeah no that's fantastic there's just one element that is that you have to take into account this"
"17217300","17225600"," only i will only do this in specific in a specific time window so um you know it it like"
"17225600","17230520"," for me it only is validated when it's done in the London session and in the period of the London"
"17230520","17237720"," session where um you know this the smart money starts moving and when the cash opens up because why"
"17237720","17245160"," is that um look the session starts at one a.m right or i'm sorry at two a.m yeah"
"17245160","17253120"," a lot of times i wake up my time that is around six a.m or like five thirty six"
"17253120","17259720"," a.m so that you're you guys i think eleven thirty midnight approximately right because the midnight"
"17259720","17264860"," open is the key area for me where i start to look to see what they're going to do that"
"17264860","17272380"," midnight open level right here that is my skill target at once so if London opens up in the cash"
"17272380","17277100"," and they're all the way down no matter if we're going to continue down a lot of times they will"
"17277100","17283820"," go back and retest that midnight open level and the point of this midnight open level is it's a"
"17283820","17289000"," level that you can use where you can try to figure out to see if they're accumulating either above"
"17289000","17293700"," or below that level to make the move for the rest of the day because a lot of times you"
"17293700","17300900"," will also see that London will make the high or the low of the day and let's go back to"
"17300900","17307980"," the day before and i'm going to overlay something for you real quickly with where you can see the"
"17307980","17316140"," different sessions that are in play right and so i divide these sessions up in different things the"
"17316140","17322800"," golden nugget i thought of myself because it's a spool a run on liquidity and a mean reversion back"
"17322800","17330020"," down that also happens at a specific time of day under the right conditions so now let's go back on"
"17330020","17337800"," that all-time high area right and i will show you how important these sessions are and how they"
"17337800","17343820"," come in play later in the day and how they trap people thinking we're growing up and then they'll"
"17343820","17350120"," rip your face back up down later on in the day but the beautiful part about it is is that"
"17350120","17355660"," if you miss the trade and you have the discipline to wait for it you will get a good entry"
"17355660","17361240"," to join the party to go down now let's analyze how this high was made because you have asia"
"17361240","17367820"," consolidating which was showing like a bullish thing going on but you have to take the prior"
"17367820","17374220"," session into account also because the new york pm session made that made a all-time high asia"
"17374220","17382140"," didn't get above it but london they actually went up and they ticked all time high but remember rth"
"17382140","17388700"," was an open so the new york am session opened here and actually my new york am session starts at"
"17388700","17395800"," seven a.m. new york time and now so and there are two key times that i keep in mind"
"17395800","17401300"," which is the two o'clock prince and the ten o'clock prince because those times will always get"
"17401300","17408700"," retested so yeah i've noticed that i've noticed the ten uh the ten a.m. prince getting tested as"
"17408700","17414540"," well so yeah and look look what happened here because like the previous two o'clock prince from the"
"17415020","17421960"," day from the day before right is this level here and look how they danced around it for the entire"
"17422880","17429660"," day then they break down and look in the new york am session they did a hat fake and dropped"
"17429660","17435900"," it down then the pm opened up you know they dropped it down where did they go to the previous"
"17435900","17445900"," new york pm two o'clock prince and this happened so just to interrupt briefly here so david"
"17445900","17450640"," if you're going to be a buyer again where are where are you looking for that that downside move to"
"17450640","17456440"," go to where's the area of interest that look that accumulation place again for the next one well"
"17456440","17460300"," yeah let me let me let me let me continue sorry sorry i apologize i'm being asked questions here in"
"17460300","17466520"," the background yeah no because it's it's um the thing is it's like you know the story needs it they"
"17466520","17471280"," need to tell me what's going to happen because first of all what i'm expecting i'm not going to try"
"17471280","17477020"," to figure out a place right now to buy because the thing is i want to see either a rejection"
"17477020","17484900"," from the buyer's liquidity which is the all-time high that is there and if we're going to go back"
"17484900","17491000"," down we have a lot of unfinished business down there below but do the first place that i will look"
"17491000","17498400"," at are these four-hour previous four-hour opening candles so you see the dark the magenta blue"
"17498400","17506240"," lines here so i will just step down to each part on spx that's 51.37 down to that 51 "
"17506240","17514220",".25 and then the other area between 51.30 and 51.09 and let's have a look on yes i"
"17514220","17518340"," don't know what i have looked at yes because they're already at all-time highs and i don't trade"
"17518340","17527880"," them when they're above all-time highs and we revert to gressel for example if i because look yes i"
"17527880","17534860"," have the same thing with es right where i have 51 down there as well to 50.97 yeah and"
"17534860","17538800"," look like es is at the target the primary target for me and"
"17538800","17548440"," the next i don't know if we're going to reach those levels with this"
"17548440","17555660"," contract because we're rolling over already to the june contracts next next week so that's"
"17555660","17560520"," something yeah it's going to be a tricky week you know i mean i think the premium is already like"
"17560520","17566960"," 200 points on them or there's a difference of on nastak at least there's a there's a premium of 200"
"17566960","17575400"," points compared to the march contract so i think i don't know if it's going to be friday tomorrow"
"17575400","17581180"," or next week you guys are going to wake up i'm going to think nastak up top 200 points but"
"17581180","17586640"," it didn't if you're using trading here and then i think it's on monday is the role right monday is"
"17586640","17592480"," the role yeah i think always like those days on fin twit yeah well yeah it's going to be like"
"17592480","17596600"," but like you know start trading the the other contract when the volume has exceeded the previous"
"17596600","17602840"," one so stay away because the liquidity is already bad in nastak so i would stay away from from the"
"17602840","17611560"," new contract until because like if you do market orders and even today i close out of a trade or"
"17611560","17618240"," long and i got filled 20 points below because i pressed the market order so you have to be really"
"17618240","17626020"," careful with nastak in regards to that if you're trading that now what happened today because like"
"17626020","17631980"," you get this move and you guys wake up in the new york am session and you know the beautiful"
"17631980","17637100"," part about it is for me is that i'm in london or you know i live in the london time"
"17637100","17643500"," zone so you know i get to participate in that move but you guys wake up and you already got"
"17643500","17647260"," up a few hundred points and i'm thinking like what the fuck how the hell am i going to do"
"17647260","17652900"," this shit now you know so and then when we come back to that system where i'm talking to you"
"17652900","17658820"," about like where i have my bias where i use different systems where i'm you know once i see this"
"17658820","17664740"," reaccumulation here and this by model has been activated you know there's nothing going to stop it"
"17664740","17673980"," except for like really bad news for it not to retest those highs so and the next thing is we"
"17673980","17680580"," also have a weekly gap that is right here that was left open that we just left behind and was"
"17680580","17687480"," never retested really in that sense and and that's where we're testing so in your discord i also"
"17687480","17692620"," said okay we need to breach this zone retest and hold it for me to be able to continue a"
"17692620","17698300"," lot right yeah so that would that would be like if i was opening positions like if i wanted to"
"17698300","17703320"," be a c r d t e edgy jen within our in 30 minutes left in the cash session this"
"17703320","17709420"," would be like i would be what this reads to me on your chart is a break above a supply"
"17709420","17716180"," zone a retest of that supply zone and basing off of that supply zone to go along off of again"
"17716180","17721660"," yeah that makes sense because like you know like i said you see the dotted line that i have here"
"17721660","17726880"," the blue one that is the new four hour opening that starts at 2 p.m so what i'm expecting"
"17726880","17733400"," right now is like because i still want to see this level be taken out on the top side right"
"17733400","17742720"," here 1 8 3 7 7 7 7 5 so it's quite simple what i'm doing here at the moment"
"17742720","17751000"," um look there is this barrage for a value gap that was created and you know but i don't see"
"17751000","17756740"," the short yet in that sense let me see if i have to go through a 30 second chart yet"
"17756740","17766640"," in real so look in my opinion they're accumulating lungs did make a continuation move"
"17766640","17773100"," up to 1 3 7 7 7 that's it don't make it too complicated yeah i like those 30 points"
"17773100","17781420"," i'm long so let's do it now now that's great to open right yeah and you know you get the"
"17781420","17786720"," shenanigans in the open and there you have actually two places to get in and that's why you always"
"17786720","17792660"," see me saying okay i'm waiting either for my level to get touched or i'm going to wait until 10"
"17792660","17799700"," a.m and for me to the market to show me to what they're going to do now look at"
"17799700","17807640"," 8 or at 6 a.m it's when the four-hour print starts and it's a little quiet but there"
"17807640","17816500"," are these little subtle things that are happening right and you can see it they press it down and"
"17816500","17824500"," the reason why they're doing it is to accumulate the lungs again for a continuation move up so this"
"17824500","17831140"," part here every time they dip they buy they break it above they press it back down and they keep"
"17831140","17837700"," pressing it down and this is where retail gets fucked because they think this shit's going down you"
"17837700","17845400"," know now there's another thing that happened here as soon as you breach a new high for me it's a"
"17845400","17855400"," sign for me so i'm remaining bullish as"
"17855400","17863180"," long as we don't make new lows higher highs higher lows higher highs higher higher highs higher"
"17863180","17869500"," lows let me ask you something David sorry to interrupt two questions so when you're looking for"
"17869500","17875680"," these higher highs and higher lows what time frame are you drawing these lines off of well you know"
"17875680","17879880"," my foundation is the four-hour chart in that sense with the daily and the weekly and then i look"
"17879880","17887540"," for the hourlies and but look the thing is is that you have these four-hour opening prints right"
"17887540","17897280"," yeah this is my over-under every time we start step up and you can see it here also you"
"17897280","17904920"," see how we're stepping down yeah i get it so you're using a four-hour candle as your basis for"
"17904920","17911020"," a swing high swing low yeah so when rth opened up for example i was waiting for this area here"
"17911020","17917560"," because i had some fair value gaps here that i had marked out on the chart and i started"
"17917560","17924200"," accumulating longs here so on the way down i are open up i think three contracts and then i added"
"17924200","17930140"," five here and as soon as it started to move up and showing me a wick and i look for"
"17930140","17935680"," these little tiny signatures it's really weird because like if if there's a bullish candle that"
"17935680","17944620"," opens lower than the previous red one here you see what i'm talking about let me show you"
"17944620","17954490"," you see this open here yeah lower than this one here i'm long oh i'm"
"17954490","17962870"," done as soon as it breaks above this one here and it's quick i will add i will add and"
"17962870","17969270"," keep adding you know and then you know and that's how i i increase the size and just go for"
"17969270","17979250"," it and where that's really is here that is really interesting because the way i"
"17979250","17987430"," trade i would have waited for a break and retest of the previous high before i would have gone long"
"17987430","17993910"," yeah but the problem is it takes a long because yeah and what you're talking about and and i i"
"17993910","17999890"," had that same problem and then you're 30 minutes down the line right and then you get a stop and"
"17999890","18005570"," you get this going up and you get this confusion well you know my first goal always is to scale"
"18005570","18013550"," right so i i i i on the first push and i reach that part i take off most of"
"18013550","18020610"," it and those amount of contracts that i take off i subtract that from my stop so let's say if"
"18020610","18028330"," i have four contracts for example right right and i take two of them off and we've gone up 50"
"18028330","18034970"," points on each contract that means my stop is like 100 points lower here right my break in yeah so"
"18034970","18040830"," you it's like in book map i can calculate that automatically but it's like a a math thing you have"
"18040830","18046230"," to do in your head yeah i mean that gives you a room because like let's say if for example"
"18046230","18053230"," this area here was thing because like 10 o'clock opened up and look and i added to the position"
"18053230","18058310"," because like 10 o'clock is a key area or a key time for me to be doing it now"
"18058310","18065970"," look i have a target still open on the upside which i'm working towards to so i stick to that"
"18065970","18073170"," and we did not bridge this this high here so when we got up here there's this little tiny fair"
"18073170","18082110"," value gap here that where i scale out from and it's okay because like the thing is like when we"
"18082110","18087930"," reach that high we're going to reach it higher at some at a later point so it's like a"
"18087930","18095110"," psychological game thing so any dip i'm seeing from there on i'm buying and then if you go on the"
"18095110","18103830"," five minute chart i think you will see what i'm talking about and it's quick because when i just"
"18103830","18113290"," drew out for you at that low same shit happens here look that fair fair value gap becomes inverted"
"18114010","18121650"," yeah this is your buy zone so i always label them and you see me label them in the discord"
"18121650","18128110"," as over-unders so at 10 o'clock when we open up any wick in here and it can wick"
"18128110","18134170"," through it of course but my stop is here look i'm already scaled in this part so you know i'm"
"18134170","18140550"," accumulating i'm adding i'm adding i'm adding i'm adding and on the first push i take some off and"
"18140550","18147570"," that's and i think i even close the trade somewhere here i do ever add that into a trade do"
"18147570","18154690"," you have a scale into a trade yeah took a look a little bit about that please so in this"
"18154690","18162090"," case here where i went long yeah on this week this is a five minute chart so it looks like"
"18162090","18169830"," a wake right but look in the end nothing magical happened here because we had a fair value gap here"
"18169830","18177310"," because we broke above this high here so i marked them right so this is the floor that i'm looking"
"18177310","18182930"," for and it can wick through but as long as the bodies of them close in it it's okay but"
"18182930","18190250"," then we have that for our opening price right where i was just waiting for for it to get retested"
"18191210","18199350"," before i enter and then at 10 o'clock that's the usual time where i usually trade in i add"
"18199350","18207290"," to the position here and you can because like i closed my long somewhere here i think about you um"
"18207290","18217120"," at six o'clock new york time and then um yeah what are we looking for now yep you know"
"18217120","18224960"," to be honest you're looking for this break above and hold but for me the risk reward ratio is not"
"18224960","18231060"," here at the moment i mean i'm done for today i sure can moon and i'm okay with that yeah"
"18231060","18237040"," because i don't know what's going to happen from here because like you get these really weird"
"18237040","18243640"," shenanigans and let's say if someone does um decide to press the sell button it's going to be quite"
"18243640","18248880"," aggressive but whatever happens i don't care because i will be looking for a bullish or a value gap"
"18248880","18256320"," if we're going to reverse and that's what i will consider shorts and i will name this like this my"
"18256320","18264080"," over under also and then just wait for them to go back and they're retested and then take the short"
"18264080","18270340"," if needed but i got it because like it's it's really difficult to pick a top i'm not going to"
"18270340","18275940"," be the one doing that right i'm showing you the type of pattern that i'm looking for um before"
"18275940","18282300"," something like that happens and this is not to fail but um and where would i target to the first"
"18282300","18290290"," place i would go to is back to this area this consolidation area here gotcha well that's brilliant"
"18290290","18297090"," though um thank you so much for sharing that yeah no worries i learned a lot and i know uh"
"18297090","18307070"," there's a fair amount of uh future traders in the discord as well as um on stream and i'm sure"
"18307070","18311790"," they got value out of this as much as i did so thank you so much David like i really"
"18311790","18319030"," like that something to think about maybe change some sleeping habits uh no you know the thing is"
"18319030","18324130"," it's like keep it as simple as possible you know there's it's like and and look i made it as"
"18324130","18328990"," complicated as i could in the past i've been using volume profile and levels and all kinds of other"
"18328990","18338190"," crap and you know the beautiful part about this is let's put on an overlay the triggers to see how"
"18338190","18345910"," they react on those areas because look the areas that i mark out in the end the triggers they also"
"18345910","18353750"," align over those areas so really yeah and it's i thought cap about that also you know it's it's"
"18353750","18360210"," like even here if you're late to the party and you know i'm doing something that is very technical"
"18360210","18367190"," but it's using the triggers and once you get the direction right the one minute trigger has been um"
"18367190","18373890"," a good place you know yeah good things use yeah just follow the one minute trigger like the easiest"
"18373890","18379830"," trade i have found is to wait for a bear cross or a bull cross on the one in the"
"18379830","18387690"," fives yeah and then yeah and then just play that and you know i i'm more of a scalper just"
"18387690","18393130"," because i don't want to like i don't know loss aversion theory or something i want to lose money"
"18393130","18399550"," you know i take a lot of trades um i scale in scale up kind of thing i also do"
"18399550","18404210"," it i don't sit in front of a desk most of the day to trade futures i do it when"
"18404210","18414180"," i get an opportunity but it says like if if there is an edge in looking through overnight i"
"18414180","18420020"," am always willing to learn and this has been very very helpful to like you know at least mark those"
"18420020","18426280"," levels out as like areas of interest exactly you know and the beautiful part about it is is like"
"18426280","18433560"," that's why like i i i trade a lot less now using those four-hour windows right because the only"
"18433560","18438120"," thing is you need to you need to take the time to train yourself how to identify when they're"
"18438120","18446500"," accumulating or district or you know for for whichever move they want to go to but you know less is"
"18446500","18450340"," more and then again you know we don't want to be slaves on the screen i do enjoy what i'm"
"18450340","18456520"," doing by the way and that's why i'm also teaching on the side of it right and you know because"
"18456520","18463860"," it's it keeps me sharp and it forces me to step up to the plate also and you know yesterday"
"18463860","18472700"," i traded live with with some some of my discord you know where i was like trying to explain what"
"18472700","18479180"," is happening and giving them an understanding on my way of thinking because it's that like you"
"18479180","18485260"," can't just copy paste the way you're trading or i am trading right that sense and and you know and"
"18485260","18491400"," with gap platform we are trying to make it easier for for everyone else to i was just talking to"
"18491400","18496180"," bork about that about the you can't copy trade you have to teach the system to them to make their"
"18496180","18501980"," own decision-making and actions right no thought process is good it's too but time they make that"
"18501980","18510000"," decision uh execution all of that stuff it they're late but you know you're already gone yeah yeah"
"18510000","18519900"," can disagree with that yeah same thing in the management of the trade as well right yeah"
"18519900","18527580"," and you know what's next for me in that sense um look you know i i did tomorrow i have"
"18527580","18535560"," a different playbook and that's completely disconnected on what i do on a technical day you know"
"18535560","18541820"," but first thing what i'll do is start off with the agent ranges and i'll plot even deviation"
"18541820","18551180"," standard deviation levels from that on always on thursday to friday and if we are making a new high"
"18551180","18558020"," for example in the afternoon and doing some some mooning to whatever that's what i think we're"
"18558020","18563340"," doing i think we're gonna squeeze i'm looking at it right now i'm like yeah and but even for that"
"18563340","18569260"," i have a playbook ready you know so and like i have this this tgi friday um pgi f setup"
"18569260","18576420"," who are favorites dude yeah where you you you get the weekly range from from low to high and you"
"18576420","18582380"," look for the 20 20 percent retracement level for that so those are areas where i look for to to"
"18582380","18587800"," join the party or either short to because cap asked me what what are those targets you're looking"
"18587800","18593920"," for tomorrow well you know let's see what they will do with tpi tomorrow you know or or nfl i"
"18593920","18601280"," mean and yeah they're they're right right now brother for it yeah so so what i'm going to do is"
"18601280","18607400"," is whatever range they give us after that um and and you know try it out for yourself to see"
"18607400","18613080"," what happens and mark that level in your chart when you get that high print and we make these crazy"
"18613080","18620080"," all-time highs well you know we can do it with uh yes now already because they they already made"
"18620080","18626060"," a new high right for right there yeah so let me take everything off here and we'll see what what"
"18626060","18631520"," that 20 percent level is and mark it on your chart as long as we don't make make a new"
"18631520","18638700"," high keep adjusting it and we'll see if we get a retracement to it tomorrow during the print so"
"18638700","18645620"," it's very simple you go here here pay attention when you're you're out there watching right now pay"
"18645620","18655280"," attention so on this week's range the 20 percent retracement level is 51 49 which like even if you"
"18655280","18664530"," take decide to take this short from here let's see how many points is that okay"
"18664530","18675950"," sit over scare go here do that with two contracts oh my"
"18675950","18685420"," i'm sorry i'm just looking at options positioning right now and um the options market is"
"18685420","18693300"," selling puts on the cues by the bucket load right now and zero dt puts and buying zero dt calls"
"18693300","18702920"," so that's interesting 90 minutes to go into the cash session close i like i like seeing that"
"18702920","18712740"," as a dgen um looking at the s&p 500 um it's it's a different story options of"
"18712740","18721560"," deltas peaked at 156 eastern time and"
"18721560","18729340"," they have peaked at 2 billion in positive delta currently we are at 19 million in negative delta"
"18729340","18737380"," somebody had asked earlier why is VIX up that's why VIX is up people are buying puts people are"
"18737380","18744440"," buying longer dated puts of protection why because we are at all time highs and also because there"
"18744440","18750120"," is NFP tomorrow so there is a little bit of volatility hedging going on but we've already had two"
"18750120","18757220"," sets of economic data showing that jobs are not that hot right now the job market is starting to"
"18757220","18762180"," cool off yeah i think also it could be a nothing burger for some reason but i don't know yeah"
"18762180","18765990"," no that's exactly what i'm saying that it's enough it's going to be nothing burger and that is"
"18765990","18775170"," setting up our squeeze for tomorrow when all those puts get smoked um so i love saying that i'm so"
"18775170","18783250"," awesome i can't wait hey but like you know what whichever high we have tomorrow um we're even at"
"18783250","18789010"," the close today mark that 20% level and just watch to see if you know how it reacts and"
"18789010","18795030"," if we start pressing down or like going down in London and they might rear cumulate you know for"
"18795030","18801710"," our next move up anyway it's a good level to keep on your chart no matter what because and they"
"18801710","18807310"," will go back and test it at some point whichever move it was so they did this yesterday too where"
"18807310","18811470"," they were teasing of a roll down and into the end of the day we just sat in our hands"
"18811470","18816990"," and watched watch as they accumulated they're doing it again right now yeah and let me just say"
"18816990","18820350"," that they were cumulate this is looking like a cumulate yeah they're doing it right here they're"
"18820350","18824590"," just keep hitting it right here and here and here and here and here nobody's business right here"
"18825120","18831330"," yeah one of mine for just two volts of three damming damming david what was your upside target for"
"18831330","18838930"," uh is 21 000 but do you have a near time upside target for the queues for NASDAQ or thank"
"18838930","18843590"," you one eight three seven seven seven five needs to be taken i think they're going to do that today"
"18843590","18852450"," and but the other one was um 18 5.6 it's way up there it's still market above that it's"
"18852450","18859550"," 18 8 57 so you know i'm not surprised if they go there so much but you know the only"
"18859550","18863470"," thing is that i'm fighting with at the moment is that the contract rollovers are coming next week"
"18863470","18868430"," so yeah cannot put a time on it and that's the thing where i got burn-on options because yesterday"
"18868430","18876010"," um i took a put right on this high here yeah i closed it too soon i did head to"
"18876010","18884150"," with futures um going long to the last peak and then in the end you know this morning when i"
"18884150","18889910"," woke up i looked at them as fuck man i bought them for um on on nq options right and"
"18889910","18895730"," i bought them for like 30 and they were like at 93 or something like that when i woke up"
"18895730","18905170"," this morning wow as we've been speaking in the last two minutes on uh NASDAQ and QTQ combined they"
"18905170","18914870"," have added about 200 million in positive delta since i last said that so uh the options market"
"18914870","18922390"," is selling puts buying calls right now now of course this could reverse in an instant because it's"
"18922390","18929190"," the options market positions get closed all the time but the but the thesis behind it is as delta"
"18929190","18936310"," has come into the market market makers have to hedge that delta by buying the underlying the buying"
"18936310","18943050"," feud buying the future so futures should directly start to um react to all this additional delta"
"18943050","18951430"," coming into the market where speculators like you guys and me we are trying to long the shit out of"
"18951430","18958650"," this because we think this is going up and that in fact in an odd way is actually what makes"
"18958650","18964190"," the market go up so i think it's kind of fascinating so let's see if these deltas continue to come"
"18964190","18971530"," in um i know some other people had uh asked for other tickers i'm happy to look at them but"
"18971530","18979690"," i'll wait till david is finished i'm just planning out my trades to see um where am i joined the"
"18979690","18986070"," party i think i have a list here for you maybe we just for a moment just take a look"
"18986070","18992790"," i have i've written down right now arm cost snowflake pound tier marvel avgeo all right let's look"
"18992790","19001640"," at arm um you guys on my screen uh i think you want to present now so do i present"
"19001640","19010940"," i think so there should be a rectangle with an arrow pointing up i stop presenting mine or does"
"19010940","19018820"," that help bam there we go okay so i'm yeah there you go my screen is up now okay so"
"19018820","19024660"," arm uh flows are generally positive they have kind of died down since the morning there was a lot"
"19024660","19031160"," of activity in the morning 150 is the call wall current crisis at 141 so there's nine dollars to"
"19031160","19038500"," the upside technically there uh but flows when i split them out into puts and calls um yeah there's"
"19038500","19044400"," this mild amount of put selling and nobody's really buying a lot of puts and uh there there were a"
"19044400","19050120"," lot more calls earlier in the day a lot of uh expresement tomorrow but they've all been sold off"
"19050120","19056820"," and it's down to only about 3.5 million in the 3.3 million in positive delta so"
"19056820","19066320"," that's just spot volatility um hoods for the 15"
"19066320","19075520"," are getting a bid but all of all is being sold for this region so immediately like that tells me"
"19075520","19085100"," somebody's anticipating a pullback um going into uh next basically going into off x so that's what"
"19085100","19092920"," that tells me and if i look at it in equity hub uh here's your call wall is at 150"
"19092920","19101000"," your hedge wall is at 132 your put wall is all the way down at 100 so it's not even"
"19101000","19108280"," like you can go and uh um wait for a test of 100 to go long ideally like that's where"
"19108280","19113340"," you go long from but there's a lot of like gaps up here which kind of make me like i"
"19113340","19119820"," don't think it's going down there i think um if it does go down we are perhaps looking at a"
"19119820","19126740"," test of 132 which is the hedge wall which is kind of between these two uh please maybe one sorry"
"19126740","19133100"," once i probably look at 135 that's where i would try and long it from if i was going to"
"19133100","19139400"," try and long it for some reason or the other but right now as i said it's above um the"
"19139400","19147500"," 140 strike which is pretty high and then you have the 150 strike which is the call wall so ideally"
"19147500","19158130"," price is going to stick between these two levels uh the 140 and the 150 i"
"19158130","19168830"," i wouldn't long it till away to 132 we can look at it in um with the one"
"19168830","19178670"," up here we are so yeah it's uh checking it's uh 30 minute trigger right now it kind of"
"19178670","19183590"," looks fairly bearish the hourly triggers at 139 which is again that 140 level that i just talked"
"19183590","19188170"," about i would think there were parking there for the end of the day uh that's what that is looking"
"19188170","19196220"," like uh let's see what else we're going to be talking about this uh what was the next one okay"
"19196220","19203260"," next one was cost yes so cost was a hard one for me yesterday i thought even if they did"
"19203260","19209080"," have a good year they would sell it into tomorrow oh man what's the price right now because i don't"
"19209080","19214380"," have it let me take a look right now uh Hank type brother i got it i got it um"
"19214380","19223720"," cost is at 785 so let's look at it call walls at 800 as of this morning um this concerns"
"19223720","19233800"," me for a bull yeah not saying it could be too because look at this there's um there's"
"19233800","19239960"," positioning i like seeing call positioning above the call wall but there's a lot more call"
"19239960","19245260"," positioning down here um and i'm going to look at one more thing for this because of the x-3"
"19245260","19251360"," tomorrow the x-3 next week um there's almost no puts above the call wall i would have like to"
"19251360","19256320"," see some more puts up there because that indicates to me you know there's going to be few to the"
"19256320","19261840"," upside to whip it up i'm not saying it won't happen so that's one thing to really i've got like"
"19261840","19269120"," 8 8 0 5 8 10 is top and then roll down um that would jive now well if we"
"19269120","19275860"," go up there then 8 20 they do sometimes cost likes the fucking squeeze too and then yeah but the"
"19275860","19280940"," thing is it loves to dump as well yeah um but options are going to be very very expensive on"
"19280940","19287320"," it um i would suggest whatever you do uh upside or downside look at something a little bit more"
"19287320","19296540"," complex like uh like a calendar spread where you go outside of the downside um you know or doing a"
"19296540","19301340"," fly um that would be a good way to go about paying cost if you're the concerned i like the"
"19301340","19307160"," fly on it that's what i like yesterday was the fly on it yeah so um so so just that"
"19307160","19312580"," um i would have liked to see some more up here but that does not mean it doesn't work this"
"19312580","19317880"," just means that there's also like if it starts moving up because there's all these calls that are"
"19317880","19324380"," in the money and there's a decent amount right under it like about till about the 700 level there's"
"19324380","19329180"," like a decent amount of puts down there too so that would have matter to it so it could whip"
"19329180","19336500"," up and also if we look at it uh right now in hero uh they're selling puts on it by"
"19336500","19343000"," the handful so you see there's this blue line this is put so that the fact that the blue line"
"19343000","19351700"," is positive means the deltas on the puts are positive which means market is net short puts today on"
"19351700","19357560"," costo um just the heads up here we're coming in we have 10 minutes left until the half hour at"
"19357560","19364180"," 3 p.m. and you just watch that that half hour bar as it's looking right now folks uh switcher"
"19364180","19369740"," spy or spx or excuse to a 30 minutes uh bar chart to take a peek at it really quick"
"19370260","19375660"," uh it's looking like a three-bar play yeah exactly and that's that's that's basically what i look"
"19375660","19381380"," for all the time right and and why are they pressing it down to go short no they're not look"
"19381380","19388500"," at this four-hour candle that is developing right now yep this is right and you tell me if uh"
"19388500","19394940"," high on a four hour looks like that no no it doesn't so what are they doing they're accumulating"
"19394940","19399900"," logs how far can they go we don't know well you have these fair value gaps but the thing is"
"19399900","19405540"," is that it's a bit tricky because right now in the four-hour chart there's potentially a fair value"
"19405540","19412340"," gap in development at the moment now look they can press it all the way down to the 21 the"
"19412340","19418720"," 20% refresh level at some point and then they will turn the market around 20 minutes past nine"
"19418720","19427340"," approximately then you will see them really scooting it up usually and the last push and the"
"19427340","19434080"," volatility spike comes at 50 um that you know of and i don't know what happens exactly that i think"
"19434080","19439900"," it's it's the imbalances or something like that and then you get this fake move and then they will"
"19439900","19448560"," press to whatever they want to reach um in those last 10 minutes so um and that is where the"
"19448560","19453140"," options most of the time get plucked over i think and you guys that are the ETE traders are better"
"19453140","19458260"," than that in that than an iron and that's the reason why i'm not trading options because i don't"
"19458260","19464180"," know how to time them correctly yet and i've tried it many times and i did it with the house"
"19464180","19469000"," money but then you know the fills are just they just suck you need to have the target right and"
"19469000","19474340"," the theta with you and now i'm to be honest trading then the options that are expiring that they"
"19474340","19482180"," itself on spx um but you know i started to do it like day out and it does work in"
"19482180","19489100"," that sense but yeah when this new candle develops and it happens on all time frames in the 15"
"19489100","19494860"," minute chart and on the one hour the first move what they do is the fake move because they're going"
"19494860","19500200"," to the place where they want to accumulate and that is why you see on the higher time frames these"
"19500200","19506580"," high voids or these low voids because they try to go as high or as deep as they can to"
"19506580","19512380"," scoop up whatever they need to get to their targets now on NASDAQ we have that higher target above"
"19512380","19520180"," that are still open and you know we're hugging that opening candle at the moment and EAS is still"
"19520180","19528220"," well below it right but EAS made the new high and NASDAQ hasn't so there is a divergence happening"
"19528220","19535820"," at the moment as we speak so one will follow and i'm assuming NASDAQ will be high before the close"
"19535820","19545460"," at the moment i love hearing that so really quickly going back to this chart right"
"19545460","19554100"," to Costco i am looking at how much of the options volume is going to be expiring tomorrow tomorrow"
"19554100","19563240"," is actually the top gamma expiry for Costco and 39% of the put volume is expiring tomorrow"
"19563240","19573160"," and 34.8% of call volume is expiring and the put to call OI ratio was pretty high so"
"19573160","19582100"," what we might be seeing right now as with the put selling is actually no this this is one DTE"
"19582660","19588980"," puts the light blue ones we're seeing longer dated puts being sold on it too so in all in essence"
"19588980","19595640"," i think this is bullish this is bullish for Costco going into ER from the options market they are"
"19595640","19603000"," nice looking to long Costco long Costco that's the call from trader podcast now that doesn't mean"
"19603000","19607180"," if he's wrong that you blame him you have to go out there and do your own due diligence go"
"19607180","19612380"," out there do your own risk assessment you are ultimately responsible for your own decision so this"
"19612380","19620040"," is not advice let me it's not advice and since like i'm saying that let me see what would be"
"19620040","19624240"," what would be a trade i would want to get into so let me give me a second i'm looking"
"19624240","19633980"," into a trade and right now um what trade would you take i would i would so 5 "
"19633980","19641140","% over what's the implied move i could probably i'll check it hold on i got your brother yeah if"
"19641140","19649720"," you can get me the current implied move that would be fantastic i can like it's under 5% it"
"19649720","19655540"," was yesterday 5% but i'd have to check it again today i don't want to say it is if"
"19655540","19668660"," it isn't it's changed it was yesterday 4.7"
"19668660","19678060"," expected move currently or the march 8th expiry march 15th expiry it's a 5.3 percent"
"19678060","19686560"," all right so here's the trade that i would be taking i would take i would sell an 8.40"
"19686560","19694340"," call for tomorrow for five dollars and 55 cents and i would buy an 8.40 call for for march"
"19694340","19702240"," 15 for 8.55 so that is a total net cost of three dollars as of right now but i"
"19702240","19706640"," think you can get a fill for about 275 so i'm going to try and get a fill for 275"
"19706640","19714240"," because i'll take that trade why not i'm saying this is this is how it's going to go so let's"
"19714240","19729160"," take the trade 3 2.75 let's see if they fill me all right"
"19729160","19739120"," i'm ready to get filled if it gets candle"
"19739120","19745740"," marks are you using the wicks or just candle body are you looking i guess for the demand to step"
"19745740","19751560"," in on that you're looking for an actual wick down there or does that imply anything for you on"
"19751560","19757920"," either side i guess um well it's quite simple the lines that you see in my chart are posted in"
"19757920","19766780"," the discord the dotted lines are just the opening price of the four hour candle now you you know i"
"19766780","19773160"," have the candles on my five minute or my one minute i have a four hour candle always on it"
"19773160","19782800"," right and but i see on a candle type if it's if it's like"
"19782800","19791120"," let's say um how do i explain this easily um look when the when the four hour candle opens up"
"19791800","19797120"," and let's say if they press it down right um you have the opening price and you only see a"
"19797120","19805520"," body of the candle well if you're looking for a reversal for example the reversals don't come from"
"19805520","19815040"," candles that don't have wicks so let's say if i have a bear stance and i want to trade it"
"19815040","19823600"," down when when when it opens up i prefer to see them spool it up first create that wick because"
"19823600","19830820"," it's it's higher than the opening price um and then later on they will press it down at a specific"
"19830820","19838080"," time which like i said you know usually they do this 20 minutes after um nine o'clock or after"
"19838080","19847940"," 20 minutes after whatever time the camera opens um and then they will create that wick so i"
"19847940","19855100"," suspect right now they are creating a wick first on the down oh nice look at this go spy with"
"19855100","19865100"," a big red candle sorry David yeah so this is this is what i was expecting to occur because what"
"19865100","19874800"," are they doing you know they're trying to accumulate longs to go back up so for me you know what"
"19874800","19880060"," i am at the moment i don't know if it's going to hold yet but i'm going to wait and"
"19880060","19885640"," i'm going to add one as it holds i'm hoping i can buy like five twelve seventy eight or possibly"
"19885640","19895550"," even uh five eleven fifty this happened yesterday and i made some fucking bank"
"19895550","19904230"," on that trade well i lost some of it i traded watching that drop um when i put it i"
"19904230","19910170"," raised some stops on it but i was like yeah maybe it'll just keep blasting it didn't they pulled"
"19910170","19917640"," this shit yesterday and it was it was a great fucking trade i'm looking to see right now i'm"
"19917640","19921420"," waiting for that up to envelop so what i drew out with that bearish for i felt like a gap"
"19921420","19928680"," i'm doing the same thing now live on my chart right because i'm i have a trade plan to go"
"19928680","19935440"," along from this over under that i posted in the discord you know i don't blindly enter it however i"
"19935440","19942500"," am waiting for the setup to unfold because i need a confirmation so even though we're going down"
"19942500","19949680"," before i start taking the trade i want a camouflage or back above the specific fair value gap and"
"19949680","19956200"," the time trade that i'm trying to look to learn from so how deep can they go i do not"
"19956200","19964700"," know and you will not know until um things burn right so i have these areas marked out because we"
"19964700","19972620"," have this previous consolidation and that high that we can fake out from now you know they can also"
"19972620","19977700"," go back to the twenty percent retracement level what i mentioned if let's have a look to see what"
"19977700","19987470"," he s is doing remember that fifty one forty nine area that i mentioned what's zero date somebody's"
"19987470","19997320"," asking zero date i'm i'm looking for uh five eleven seventy four brother ooh that's a"
"19997320","20006930"," lot of blood that just took out the last hour and a half of trading yep and now all those"
"20006930","20011890"," bears went sold down there are going to sell again and we're going to just run their stops again"
"20011890","20020470"," yes they're i've been betting they're flinching like yesterday we blasted down it just slammed on"
"20020470","20027010"," the hourly trigger and people are just piling into puts and it just ricocheted back up again on the"
"20027010","20036010"," es the uh 30 minute we're uh above the 30 minute trigger which is at thirty nine fifty and uh"
"20036010","20042170"," on my pivots we are at fifty one fifty six which is my bullish target one which we were above"
"20042170","20048310"," all this time so that was a test of our both still present in my mind i would not mind"
"20048310","20057150"," longing this i am flat right now because my stop got run and i'm happy taking my money so i'm"
"20057150","20066920"," looking for an entry it needs to confirm things for me um you can see on my screen um"
"20066920","20073440"," the options market kind of uh just nuke right there but see they're selling puts again that little"
"20073440","20078740"," oh yeah this is both this is all a scam right here yeah they're they're they're selling uh they're"
"20078740","20084140"," selling puts again um at this level and there's zero to keep what's like somebody just well how"
"20084140","20092580"," much was like about that's about five hundred million in delta inputs came in and about about seven"
"20092580","20096120"," you want the hold on i'll give them the i'll give them the sorry you keep talking i apologize i'm"
"20096120","20104760"," reading good questions here hold on gotcha um it's you know they took off a calls so calls got sold"
"20104760","20112820"," monetized or whatever from 4.12 billion to 3.3 so 800 million in delta got monetized or sold on"
"20112820","20122720"," calls and at the same time about 3.44 to about 600 billion and put delta got applied so got"
"20122720","20132520"," that question about the nq ht on nq it's 18 one one eight and 89 cents"
"20132520","20142420"," 79 76 cents right around there sorry boys go ahead no it's it's cool this is"
"20142420","20147120"," always an interesting period we just had an hourly flip so you know these shenanigans are somewhat"
"20147120","20155840"," expected um and so i'm not too worried about it i now i see a break above the bullish target"
"20155840","20166680"," this is what i"
"20171190","20179770"," did i scaled at 57 i am scaled at 56 exactly at my trigger i've only taken two micros so"
"20179770","20189620"," i'm not risking a lot of money on this i've made my money today so an es i wanted"
"20189620","20207650"," to break above 5160 again to add see if"
"20207650","20222500"," i can go to a lower time frame see if i can get loose adding oh my"
"20222500","20234060"," god so particularly what i'm looking at please yep 5156"
"20234060","20244040"," on my screen as you can see was my it was a previously algorithmically generated pivot point that"
"20244040","20253440"," we came back and tested and after a break above pre-test i longed it at 5156 i'm going to"
"20253440","20259800"," stay along i'm going to keep an eye on this bear cross that just happened on es as well yeah"
"20259800","20265480"," can you share my screen yeah when you talk it'll come up i think that's how it is or no"
"20265480","20276050"," wait okay you"
"20276050","20315180"," share my screen cap yeah of course okay i'm showing you some life phrase here am i"
"20315180","20324940"," reading this short you're short right now no i'm from 54 there you go fantastic entry my man"
"20326440","20334260"," now you caught a two point better entry than i did i have to get better you're keeping a stop"
"20334260","20341820"," type i don't already scale that like four contracts five i threw out five already so you know it's"
"20341820","20347960"," a win and you know that's a thing look my way of thinking is like i look pretty small moves"
"20347960","20356620"," to occur yeah and i you know if i'm sure about a certain move i'll put in bigger size and"
"20356620","20361600"," and then i'll keep the stop type and if i get stopped up that's all right because like if i"
"20361600","20368060"," get those runners remember the four-hour opening price we will go back and test it at some point"
"20368060","20375880"," it's you know the market moves like a drunk man right so yeah i'm not quite sure when and how"
"20375880","20381140"," it gets there and they will get there aggressively now you know there's another thing here it's NFP"
"20381140","20389020"," so it kind of sucks to have these type of market conditions i know and to be honest it's been"
"20389020","20395420"," behaving quite nicely which i wasn't expecting this week it's been pretty clean price action but i"
"20395420","20399920"," think it has to do with what we discussed early that everything is baked in already you know so"
"20399920","20408760"," there's nothing unexpected anymore on this right so deltas are coming back into the s&p 500 you"
"20408760","20413960"," know we just have that one billion in negative delta essentially if you have to get it up to oh"
"20413960","20420880"," sorry more than a billion in negative delta and they're they're creeping back in so this is options"
"20420880","20431940"," market things very growing up and let's hope that continues so on"
"20431940","20438560"," the way up i keep scaling out another thing what i really want to see is them to break above"
"20438560","20447900"," retest this and then go back up gotcha and the reason is is because if we go to the five"
"20447900","20456180"," minute chart what is happening here it's always good to go back to the other time frame look the"
"20456180","20464380"," thing is i'm aware of this 20% level retracement area here and this close here so i know they"
"20464380","20473990"," can flush it down and make a lower low and then they'll go back up see i'm"
"20473990","20482790"," out but nevertheless you know it's the way i trade as it was still um a few thousand bucks"
"20482790","20492670"," because i play with the seven knots that's awesome because i am now out and all i"
"20492670","20498610"," made on that trade was six dollars but hey i'll take it yeah the win is a win right yeah"
"20498610","20505170"," amen that's why i want to thank each other and that's what's raining about so let's see what will"
"20505170","20509510"," happen i'm gonna now you know i had my alert set on this because i went really wanted to flush"
"20509510","20515810"," a little further down and remember what i told you when you get the weekly range you have this 20 "
"20515810","20522410","% level that you can short towards too you take the orders out because they do a website action"
"20522410","20532110"," thing so i think we can short it down here"
"20532110","20540570"," i don't like shorting by the way 90% of my trades are longs i don't like short so i"
"20540570","20548990"," just don't um well in London there there are some my shorts there but i'm you know i they're really"
"20548990","20556950"," fast always and i don't like to yeah i don't uh to be a to be a good short seller"
"20556950","20563170"," you need to not only have timing you also need to have size and you need to have the direction"
"20563170","20569510"," right uh for it to like really pay out so i just find it's a lot easier to be a"
"20569510","20576330"," bull and just buy the dip especially when you're in a positive gambling environment you buy the dip"
"20576330","20581210"," uh till that changes so we get into a negative diamond environment where it's like a lot more"
"20581210","20585030"," volatile than yeah you think about shorting because you know it's going to be a big vote for move"
"20585030","20589670"," down if you're getting the timing right from the downside and then you can you know make some good"
"20589670","20596790"," money yeah so now the next thing what i'm going to do is wait for confirmation until we break one"
"20596790","20603570"," kind of as soon as we get a body kind of closure above here on the one minute so you"
"20603570","20611370"," have to wait and in the meantime like there are people that can short this right they're shorting"
"20611370","20619500"," it for 9 p.m and they're targeted at this 5149 area so just really quick guys we can get"
"20619500","20624520"," through this because it is 3 10 p.m we have a bunch of reports after the bell is it"

"20675000","20680520"," kind of keep at about two two fifty eastern and they've been it was a big sell we can look"
"20680520","20686560"," at that um so there was a lot of good buying a lot of call selling that happened right around"
"20686560","20695980"," that 255 mark and about this sold about three million in one dte delta in calls and"
"20695980","20705680"," um about four million in one dte puts or what somebody's betting on downside for snowflake um"
"20705680","20713520"," i love the company i have stock um i am not playing options on this let's see what the implied"
"20713520","20720880"," volatility is like they're selling vol on every side longer dated though um vol is high how much is"
"20720880","20727640"," vol right now it's it's a little bit too bad's a little bit more juice than it usually does but"
"20727640","20735440"," this has always been a high IV stock um looking at its uh put call impact we have our call"
"20735440","20744360"," wall at 200 way up hedge wall at 175 we are currently trading um where were we trading on this"
"20744360","20754330"," um 167 all right so what"
"20754330","20764210"," does that tell me 167 is right at the guest today's closing um down here and put"
"20764210","20774020"," walls at 160 man we guys are getting all sorts of tough ones where the read is not that"
"20774020","20785180"," easy so history uh we have more calls expiring tomorrow than puts and"
"20785180","20793460"," the put walls come down that's a bearish signal the put wall is you know was at 200 before like"
"20793460","20799640"," it nuked um and it's kind of it keeps coming down to like a once it's come from like 200"
"20799640","20806900"," to 160 and every day it's going down 175 165 160 that means more puts are being bought on this"
"20806900","20816260"," and um directionally um that actually this looks like puts would be the play for this just"
"20816260","20824180"," based on the options market what it is telling me um yeah there's also like you know like all this"
"20824180","20829740"," gamma in 170 like put gamma and it's getting stronger and stronger going into tomorrow there's a"
"20829740","20837360"," whole bunch of put gamma at 165 yeah man this is this is looking like it wants to go down"
"20837360","20845060"," and test that 160 level because all these puts are just gonna get that much more magnetic so um"
"20845060","20854640"," yeah that's kind of like my read of the option structure right now and let me just yeah IV is"
"20854640","20860280"," higher today on this term structure than it has been but it's still squarely like in the middle of"
"20860280","20871330"," where it has been as i was saying like mall is always high on on uh on snowflake so we're"
"20871330","20878430"," looking at book map cap sorry about that uh i'm we're talking to people on the chat managing the"
"20878430","20886170"," chat right now gotcha um what was the next thing that you guys want me to oh so we've got"
"20886170","20894410"," um we did snowflake we wanted to do PLT where did you palantir no but um i love palantir parent"
"20894410","20902030"," palantir marble and then AVGO yep i will look at palantir palantir one dte i am"
"20902030","20911930"," seeing negative most of the negative deltas that"
"20911930","20919510"," have come in are one dte so somebody's buying hooks on them so i'm not seeing enough i'm not seeing"
"20919510","20927090"," a lot of call selling um calls are firmly to be upside uh there's about 20 million in call delta"
"20927090","20936910"," on palantir applied today across strikes and experies but uh we just had about a five million"
"20936910","20944110"," in one dte put delta put in at uh two fifty seven two fifty eight so right around there somebody"
"20944110","20950310"," just want a big fat stack of hooks and we'd have to go to another service to figure out like"
"20950310","20954810"," what exactly did they buy did they buy in the money puts but these are buys put buys is what"
"20954810","20963110"," i'm seeing on palantir and black volatility nothing remarkable it's all being sold on the upside m"
"20963110","20972470"," the downside because it's got juice thank you you hub let's look at the what call impact so you"
"20972470","20982450"," have a call wall at 27 where's palantir trading right now it is trading at 2675 maybe that's"
"20982450","20991430"," why we're seeing um some selling on palantir today like it's kind of like it went up to the 2738"
"20991430","20999310"," range and then from that it's kind of just oscillated between 27 and 2650 like 2660 is what i'm"
"20999310","21006930"," seeing um yeah that just kind of seems like there has it just some monetization of calls happen and"
"21006930","21014290"," people don't think it's going to go higher uh tomorrow that's what the one dte puts tell me to and"
"21014290","21021030"," just given the fact that there's a lot of calls there so let's look at um the history to see"
"21021030","21027430"," where the call walls have been and how much so actually this is interesting the call wall's gone up"
"21027430","21037390"," from 24 to 20 24 25 27 that's at 27 right now the uh hook wall has remained"
"21037390","21046850"," steady at 22.5 and we have about 42 percent 43.5 percent of put puts expiring"
"21046850","21056530"," um tomorrow and 38.83 percent of calls expiring tomorrow so there's more puts expiring but the put"
"21056530","21062930"," to call oil ratio is very small it's 0.70 so it's like a call heavy uh stock and that's"
"21062930","21072070"," kind of like what this tells me to there isn't a material position in options land on uh palantier"
"21072070","21081750"," above the call wall set 27 all the way the next big material call position is at 35 so those"
"21081750","21087370"," are probably yearly somebody's bought and somebody has a bunch of yearlies at 35 and their buys so"
"21087370","21096730"," um materially there's nothing above call wise uh between like 27 to 35 so I think this stock"
"21096730","21106070"," could be capped like right here um or we could see it like essentially right down"
"21106070","21113330"," or right up to 30 but that would require a lot more impetus and depending on what strike and tenor"
"21113330","21119310"," the calls came in today as I said there was about you know 20 million in call delta overall that"
"21119310","21124490"," came into the palantier depending on where they are what strike is next breeze they are I'm going"
"21124490","21130270"," to just chart updates tomorrow um that would give us a better insight into like what the new call"
"21130270","21135150"," wall is or where we could go I would expect the new call wall but if it rolls up it's"
"21135150","21141950"," going to roll up to 28 and not 35 because there's some call delta at 28 which is right the"
"21141950","21149670"," next above but there's like no there's no material called out all the way to 35 after that so if"
"21149670","21153890"," call walls came the calls came in I think there's like 28 calls that probably came in for like next"
"21153890","21158210"," week or something so I might see a call wall go up but I honestly see like this has been"
"21158210","21167050"," like grinding action guys I don't see it being um I don't see it really popping anymore especially"
"21167050","21173730"," after the pop it's at the last couple of days so Marville was the next one right and Marviel yes"
"21173730","21183540"," Marviel did they have Marviel chart Marviel chart it's trading"
"21183540","21193540"," at about 84 it peaked about 85 earlier it's called wall is at 85 that's why but I do"
"21193540","21203420"," see call a significant amount of calls at 90 5.9 million delta it's like 5.9 million notional"
"21203420","21213360"," at 90 compared to 8.3 million at 85 your"
"21213360","21219220"," put wall you don't need to I think worry about it it's like it's I think it's at 75 no"
"21219220","21225240"," wait but walls are 50 yeah you don't need to worry about put wall your key delta big downward"
"21225240","21232800"," strike to like aim for like if you want like shorted is 75 because that's where there is another"
"21232800","21239580"," like big stick of call gamma there's like no puts on this materially like no puts on here till like"
"21239580","21245220"," the 70s right so there's like literally like nothing on the bottom side of my screen when I'm"
"21245220","21255860"," looking at Marviel's options positioning asset this morning let's see what else can"
"21255860","21265620"," you guys see my screen can you um cap I think we're still seeing um are we saying"
"21265620","21271900"," um a good screen yeah I'm looking I'm in the chat right now David can you um there we go"
"21271900","21279790"," it popped right back again all right so so we're looking at book map right now correct book map"
"21279790","21285630"," right now okay oh you know I'm like I didn't realize that you could you didn't have two screens up"
"21285630","21291590"," so we'll look at here I'm looking at the screen right now brother oh yeah cool yeah stay out of"
"21291590","21295790"," chat if you want me to repeat call wall for Marviel is an 85 that's kind of where we're trading"
"21295790","21301190"," right now um the next material call delta is at 90 and as you can see like there's no real"
"21301190","21307590"," puts till like 70 so that's what this is telling me that this is going to keep going up if"
"21307590","21313130"," it wanted to but it's going to start slowing down you see this um this line kind of flattens out"
"21313130","21319170"," this orange line that the orange line the steepness of the orange line basically tells you how fast"
"21319170","21323070"," the move is going to be because that means that's where the gamma is increasing so it's got to have"
"21323070","21329390"," more magnetism to it so right now we're at 85 I don't see anything I mean if you get about"
"21329390","21334950"," 85 we're probably gonna like you know maybe grind it out for a few more dollars and then you know"
"21334950","21339830"," like around 88 to 90 would be a fast so that's what that is telling me if we look at"
"21339830","21345250"," the hero flow from Marviel today we got a fair amount of calls that came in and this sold one"
"21345250","21350790"," DTE puts so the options market is pretty much kind of telling you that tomorrow we kind of expect"
"21350790","21356830"," some uppies um we're seeing some monetization of one DTE calls we kind of saw that earlier when it"
"21356830","21362650"," was at like 85 at 84 15 and then we saw some more like in the last couple of minutes"
"21362650","21369310"," where some more zero DTE calls got a one DTE calls got monetized this is what you are seeing what"
"21369310","21375890"," eight million in delta but generally there's not a lot of puts on this ticker nobody's buying puts"
"21375890","21381050"," um I don't think an options trade is the way to go for this if you want to do it"
"21381050","21387470"," maybe use leverage to go in the money calls for you know if you're in the stream I had a"
"21387470","21392530"," few people ask about Marviel are you are you guys if you guys want to ask in the chat right"
"21392530","21399050"," now are you guys bullish here bearish what do you put your positioning uh in and uh i'm our vl"
"21399050","21405830"," let's see if i can get an answer from these guys yep now they seem like they're happy bro i'm"
"21405830","21415830"," reading it right now caution uh next the next ticker was um avigio broad calm yep you know if"
"21415830","21425780"," all uh avgo goes well i am hoping for 1000 on Nvidia tomorrow so what is the uh the"

"21431560","21438060"," that's all right so we got two weeks that's what uh scott was discussing the other day he was like"
"21438060","21441480"," he's like the Nvidia balls they're not gonna he's like they're gonna run it right up into that"
"21441480","21448180"," event yeah um but i mean i'm saying that you might see that tomorrow if uh broad combo as well"
"21448180","21454180"," brock yeah absolutely well he was discussing the implication for other uh tech stocks too uh they"
"21454180","21461040"," won't sell tech if they're gonna party into Nvidia yeah um i mean like uh i'm looking right now at"
"21461040","21466460"," AMD it looks like it's rated rip faces off nvda looks like it's rated rip rip faces off any of"
"21466460","21474940"," like the ai type stocks are associated with it yeah so yeah i'm looking at this"
"21474940","21484720"," um avgo chart right now dot com and it looks like they've been selling calls on it man and"
"21484720","21489420"," there's been a massive amount of call selling that's gone on that's not for tomorrow's that that's"
"21489420","21495360"," for now for tomorrow's x-ray tomorrow's x-ray is this green line of calls it's like 2.7 and"
"21495360","21502120"," million in delta that's not a lot um and the orange line initially they came in half in the heavy"
"21502120","21509200"," pot like almost 16 million in call delta all x-rays in the morning but then since then they've sold"
"21509200","21518800"," calls and we're negative 38 million so that is a swing of almost 100 million in delta in calls so"
"21518800","21524460"," that is telling me that it would be closed yesterday 1350 so it could just be people are like"
"21524460","21529320"," monetizing calls that they had from before because it's had a nice run up uh and they want to like"
"21529320","21535740"," deliver before tomorrow's uh further uh before tomorrow uh today's earnings um we look at the"
"21535740","21542060"," implied volatility whoo look at that for tomorrow upside downside but this is telling you a very"
"21542060","21550800"," interesting story you see how on the upside these percentages are higher the 1500s right is 31.7"
"21550800","21562100"," stashes higher it says it has been on a 60 day look back 224 IV on"
"21562100","21571460"," abgo 1500s and you know we go further out yeah today it's you know 6.3 standard like 1500 it's"
"21571460","21580200"," only six standard deviations away higher IV than what it was then a 60 year look back for a only"
"21580200","21587120"," 22% 32 standard deviations i'm looking at a bunch of these related tickers and i'm like this stuff"
"21587120","21591600"," looks like it's about to rip somebody's face offs in a big way either that or you're gonna wake up"
"21591600","21598960"," tomorrow morning with uh some kind of a scam scam dump yeah um maybe they maybe they're waiting on"
"21598960","21605100"," that last bit of all that that last um non farms are dead in the morning yeah and uh let's"
"21605100","21612180"," see when we look at these levels it's kind of gotten to its key gamma strike at 1400 it hasn't"
"21612180","21622200"," gone above where is its football and call wall 1500 is the call wall woo cap that's spicy"
"21623260","21630540"," look at look at this gamma positioning yeah looks great man this is so this is its call wall at"
"21630540","21638640"," 1500 right and we're trading at 1400 which is also a big stick which means ice can easily ping pong"
"21638640","21644920"," between these two and given its earnings 1500 is pretty attractive man and there's a lot of calls"
"21644920","21650100"," up here too above it that's probably one of the best ones best ones we've looked up all those of"
"21650100","21655540"," all these tickers one of my favorites yeah but it's it's juicy and it's expensive yeah it's juicy"
"21656960","21664740"," yeah so calendars would be a way to go about doing this too that is we're in a caution though"
"21665540","21677810"," this also by the way looks very much like a price to perfection scenario because there's"
"21677810","21683310"," all these calls up there there's like no puts almost up there right now nobody even selling massive"
"21683310","21690690"," amounts of strike or anything so that basically kind of tells me that stop on that large that"
"21690690","21697630"," middle of that go left stop right there yeah 1500 yep that's your call wall so like the fact that"
"21697630","21703750"," there's like no puts up there too and there's holes up there given like how this talk has gone and"
"21703750","21709830"," given that this trophy looks really much like you know it kind of looks like uh oh i'm having some"
"21709830","21719960"," issues here hold on guys i'm having i have an unstable internet connection shit being"
"21719960","21727000"," tighter i'm going to see if i can uh i'm i'm i think my can you guys can say something"
"21727000","21731380"," in the chat really quick and just make sure i want to just make sure that the stream is still"

"21736980","21744600"," something yeah i think i can see my cursor moving okay so yeah um i'm just getting a warning of"
"21744600","21751140"," an unstable uh internet connection right now thanks guys i appreciate it yeah uh career low i do"
"21751140","21757700"," agree with that wait for ivy chris tomorrow to look for a long on marvel like i think that might"
"21757700","21764700"," be a good thing i've go on the other hand it it really looks like man if given the fact"
"21764700","21774640"," that there's all these calls below it there's a bunch of puts and then 1250 has a lot"
"21774640","21780360"," of puts so there's like a lot of puts down there to evaporate too now let's look at its history"
"21780360","21785960"," i bet the call walls just down now now call walls yeah on the fourth it there were at 1400"
"21785960","21792720"," so they were at 1300 last Friday Monday they were at 1400 and for the last three days they have"
"21792720","21798200"," call walls i've been at 1500 so that's a bullish positioning that all week people have been buying"
"21798200","21805320"," calls into this we might like i would like to i'm going to set it uh along for 355 i"
"21805320","21812140"," want to revisit this uh 355 because i think positioning might change but i just want to see um what"
"21812140","21820200"," the flows look like in you know like 20 minutes or so set timer for 25 minutes if you guys"
"21820200","21829920"," could so it's 330 right now if you two"
"21829920","21833820"," could give me you don't have i mean we don't have to hold you this or anything like that are"
"21833820","21839760"," you guys looking for a dip to buy tomorrow morning uh you're looking for the market to go up"
"21839760","21846880"," overnight right now i guess the bigger question would be do i seem to be looking at the 11th as"
"21846880","21851980"," the start of a roll down or not necessarily going to happen but like the window of weakness where"
"21851980","21856680"," it could happen would begin on the 11th do you guys see any of that out there or is it"
"21856680","21865080"," just me or well you know the thing with me was that i um my seasonalities i was looking for"
"21865080","21876060"," weakness to be 11th to buy it actually till year end but we've been diverging away from it so"
"21876060","21883300"," and you know we're in an election year so you know i i will see how the cycle ends and"
"21883300","21889640"," and i'm not going to try to predict to see what they're doing because you know you guys they're"
"21889640","21899640"," sugar high on something right now so did you see um did you see the um overlay chart that trader"
"21899640","21904560"," podcast showed earlier i have it up on screen right now you want to talk about that really quick"
"21904560","21911060"," again one more time you want to see what i use yeah let's see it man yeah okay cool hold"
"21911060","21919360"," on one second share screen okay well i'm still long in the yes by the way i scaled out just"
"21919360","21924940"," now i'm um having a runner on and i'm moving to stop to break even just scaled out five contracts"
"21924940","21931340"," by the way so what i use for my seasonality is this are you guys able to see my screen"
"21931340","21939040"," yeah we are okay so i still have these market grids things i've never really used been um they're"
"21939040","21948460"," from Kendall um so do you see these lines that are right here let me put a narrow these here"
"21948460","21958400"," and let me take the drawings off dude they're just dragging in"
"21958400","21965200"," these bull these bears right now it's so funny to watch so look the thing was i was looking for"
"21965200","21974740"," weakness um starting from the 13th of February right to drop down"
"21974740","21983740"," and to buy around the 11th of March looking to buy it up until year end yeah me too so"
"21983740","21991380"," but we've been diverging away from it because this weakness it did come but this was your dip and"
"21991380","21997600"," we're still continuing up so you know i got a lot of shipment on twitter because i had said i"
"21997600","22004680"," was like i'm going to take a 5.5 500 or 490 put or something like that spread for March"
"22004680","22009340"," 28th and people were like that's not risk or that's not protection and there's no not enough money"
"22009340","22012760"," there and i'm like i don't think they're going to allow us to go lower than that and sure enough"
"22012760","22018620"," right right now we're sitting at a place where as long as price doesn't go below 4900 CTA's aren't"
"22018620","22027440"," sellers and not shockingly um you know it's i guess we can go lower than that but it's not it's"
"22027440","22033660"," looking to me it looks like price is showing the way of any corrective that any correction that"
"22033660","22041540"," happens they're trying to keep it above that 4900 5000 level um and not that previous high from"
"22041540","22050260"," 2022 January to not go lower than that and you know scare the market into panic selling you know"
"22050260","22059520"," set change sentiment to you know right um this is my book map book map screen"
"22059520","22065660"," um look i was telling you about the scaling part right um i don't know if you were able to"
"22065660","22070820"," see my book map screen yeah i'm looking right now okay you see this little bubble right here yeah"
"22070820","22078380"," um let me see let me raise the screen a little bit can you see my drawing mm-hmm okay"
"22078380","22085700"," so i entered my position right here for contracts right i i'm still sticking to my bullish stance"
"22085700","22091400"," that we're going to retest those highs so you know what is the first place i go scaling is right"
"22091400","22098660"," here so i don't treat them as exact levels but as zones so i take half the position off but"
"22098660","22104600"," because i took half this position off this this pink line that you see here is my average actually"
"22104600","22110720"," at the moment even though like your broker or interactive brokers will show me my average right"
"22110720","22118000"," here but the reason that it's moving down is because i'm scaling out so which how many points it's"
"22118000","22124040"," go it keeps going up this average keeps stepping stair stepping down so that is what happens when i"
"22124040","22130100"," scale so even if i enter into a bad position like right here how i entered into six contracts and"
"22130100","22136760"," i scale out here right because i close the position here with four contracts it's attracts these"
"22136760","22143160"," points that i went up so my average was here my theoretical average and then i decided to close it"
"22143160","22148120"," right because it went against me and i don't want to play around in this chop up until i see"
"22148120","22153940"," this pattern emerge again in the 30-second chart so you know i'm still in the position now with two"
"22153940","22159120"," contracts i'm going to see how far it will go and i can pull the plug but you know if"
"22159120","22164020"," i get stopped out it's fine it's it's a win anyway and you can see right here how many points"
"22164020","22174020"," i banked on that's how i"
"22174020","22179700"," keep hitting the bat hitting the bat hitting the bat until it goes and if we get into an area"
"22179700","22186460"," where i really feel confident on what i'm doing i'll add size to it and in the meantime i'll just"
"22186460","22193540"," stick with my three to six or whatever contracts i do so yeah knowing the clothes and then we're"
"22193540","22200580"," going to have this you know this imbalance going on um the red line did you see here it's hourly"
"22200580","22206800"," high and the hourly low now look the thing is is that within that four-hour range i always know"
"22206800","22213100"," there are stops at these levels right and they will take them out and a lot of times you will"
"22213100","22219780"," see price dip down and then revert back up or either go up and go back down or they use"
"22219780","22227600"," the mid which"
"22227600","22235100"," is we remain above this area i have to remain bullish and i know they can dip back down a"
"22235100","22244540"," little further up to here just still go up and that's how i keep scaling in and out of my"
"22244540","22250140"," trades when i'm you know trading in consolidation shop because you just don't know when in the"
"22250140","22256740"," clothes when they're going to press it up and i'm going to show you right now what happens if i"
"22256740","22266100"," take another one off to see what that pink line does see how it goes down here so i can"
"22266100","22272260"," move my stop to this area right here and still be in profit and i don't care what it does"
"22272260","22281450"," anymore in between so i buy my risk reward basically i hope it's a little fair for what i'm trying"
"22281450","22288490"," to explain and if you guys have questions regarding that feel free to ask now is that something you"
"22288490","22295950"," quoted yourself in book map to like hire to your trading account and your because that's all you"

"22311310","22318490"," depends on which account i'm connected to because like yeah i also have combines on stop top step"
"22318490","22324270"," that i i try to trade on they're playing around with and right here this window where you can just"

"22330150","22339930"," offing or to rhythmic and top step so you know i'm getting a little bit of a push here"
"22339930","22345950"," we're getting our push here we're gonna squeeze into that squeeze the baby yeah yeah so you know"
"22345950","22350230"," i'm sticking to my bias and you know about going to retest those highs"
"22350230","22360230"," you know the monthly so bad for these sellers"
"22360230","22369170"," yeah man dude i was watching them on been to it i'm just like oh yeah but like you know"
"22369170","22374290"," to be sure like it really needs to break above here we need to that kind of remember that fair"
"22374290","22380690"," value gap that i told you about like if you really want a clean trade um you need a kind"
"22380690","22388630"," of closure above it and we will know in 45 seconds what will happen yeah so i wait for that"
"22388630","22393590"," kind of closure and i might add to the position and stick to my target because we have the four"
"22393590","22399510"," hour open right here and like i said you know when when these four hours open up we go down"
"22399510","22404590"," look this four hour kind of doesn't close until the close you know and where would they want to"
"22404590","22409950"," close it you know i presume they want to go up but i don't know maybe they want to leave"
"22409950","22414830"," some gas in the tank for tomorrow who knows you know but look this is not the type of wake"
"22414830","22420570"," i want to see on the top side so i'm i'm still bullish you know i'm not liking this right"
"22420570","22427910"," here this is a four-hour chart overlaid on my um one-minute chart that you see here these big"
"22427910","22437610"," candles so and so let's see see now they broke above yeah"
"22439030","22445650"," see how they made the kind of closure of oh they did it yeah look at that yeah we also"
"22445650","22453550"," on nq we also just got above the five five-minute trigger we the the one-minute trigger is is"
"22453550","22460330"," yep there you go so this is how seeing that pushman yeah and now i still have that that es"
"22460330","22467330"," open but you know do i need hold for it it's good it's been a good run because they're long"
"22467330","22474890"," from here in this area here and it's been going up like that yeah i'm still in my point i"
"22474890","22481410"," i i i added uh at the same level at fifty one fifty six i'm now holding four contracts for"
"22481410","22490590"," fifty one forty six and es i will take two off uh 65 so that's nine points each"
"22490590","22498310"," so yeah it's been a good trade yeah i think i'm going to leave the runner for the buy side"
"22498310","22503730"," all the way up here no that before we can go because look my stop is right here at 275"
"22503730","22511250"," right now you don't even care i don't care you know yeah no that's brilliant um and we're getting"
"22511250","22515950"," absorbed now so these are good signs but the only thing is like i use these absorptions in book map"
"22515950","22520610"," and they're really nice because they're like intermediate resistance or support levels right yeah"
"22520610","22529470"," because the minute i don't see them break out above it you can take a short yeah and but then"
"22529470","22537070"," again you know we're in this area this is this new week opening gap area um it's been a resistant"
"22537070","22543210"," before so you have to be caught regarding this but you know the higher we go the the shorts will"
"22543210","22548870"," start covering and think they're just going to accelerate you know that's the thing that's how you"

"22642810","22651710"," following the closest and 2016 which is the red line uh presidential years perfect so so they show"
"22651710","22659290"," up in their methodology so so what this is actually showing and this is kind of been along with the"
"22661130","22666830"," research notes from investment banks that have like read about positioning um this supports my"
"22666830","22673810"," thesis that tomorrow is going to be a nothing burger uh there's been a lot of ball built up today"
"22673810","22681170"," that's going to get on the mound tomorrow probably yet open giving us a nice big squeeze to mirror"
"22681170","22687390"," what we've just seen but then if you look uh to to mirror um this blue line and what we"
"22687390","22693110"," hear what i want to then show you is look the blue line peaks up here but then this or"
"22693110","22700210"," uh this pink line it peaks up here uh the purple line that kind of peaks up here this uh"
"22700210","22708330"," covid brown line also kind of peaks up here like essentially like into tomorrow yeah red line kind"
"22708330","22716150"," of peaks up here into tomorrow orange line kind of has a small peak and then kind of goes down"
"22716150","22722410"," green line is the only one 2017 which continues to go up so out of all of the lines that"
"22722410","22729470"," the top seven highly correlated statistically significant lines price action lines i have that"
"22729470","22736670"," correspond to the current uh 101 day window that i'm using uh as my ruling window six out of the"
"22736670","22746230"," seven say peak is tomorrow seven looks a long now by the way so i said again i just closed"
"22746230","22753390"," my long on that back oh okay so you guys are all you guys are all watching that out there"
"22753390","22758390"," right you guys are all watching this out here where we've got six or seven examples six of the"
"22758390","22767090"," seven examples are showing a peak into tomorrow so there's a question of uh will we have a like i"
"22767090","22774970"," just like curling blast off through the moon uh squeeze out all shorts all puts of a four a roll"
"22774970","22782590"," into monday or a roll starting on monday uh so if you are a seller out there right you might"
"22782590","22787710"," especially a retailer you might just want to sit on your hands possibly i want to say something if"
"22787710","22793810"," you're watching right now too uh you still want to use your normal trading tools if price gets"
"22793810","22799230"," underneath the daily trade or the the hourly trigger uh then you start seeing that hourly come down"
"22799230","22805470"," to the daily it's not like you have to time it to the exact day let price still show you"
"22805470","22811670"," the way sometimes you know if um if we if everybody knows it's uh friday or monday let's say the"
"22811670","22816970"," 11th they might delay one day they might make it early one day start the process on friday start"
"22816970","22822130"," the process on tuesday uh something like that and catch everyone off guard just make sure that you"
"22822130","22829490"," are allowing price uh to show you the way exactly and i and again i want to reiterate that this"
"22829490","22836550"," is the these are the probabilistic outcomes the best probabilistic outcomes based on prior price"
"22836550","22841990"," action this should you should not trade this day today like even then i'm not saying you know like"
"22841990","22848430"," buy one dt puts on friday clothes i'm not saying that i am saying no because like i want to"
"22848430","22853590"," make something clear for everyone that they also understand that how the market mechanics work like"
"22853590","22859750"," and you can go back to any top that was there right it's like you i know you get farmer"
"22859750","22865490"," when you see these big drops but a lot of times the market will go back and recheck where they"
"22865490","22872670"," came from and you will get your entry again at a specific price level and you can still and"
"22872670","22878990"," actually the second retest is the clean move down because the aggressive move down people are still"
"22878990","22884710"," having like their buy orders ready to to fill because they they still think you know there's still"
"22884710","22891650"," a bunch of people that are still buying the debt right so if they're real sellers they move like"
"22891650","22899410"," they don't move like us they move like a whale or a elephant right yeah and so you have to"
"22899410","22904590"," be aware to wait for that second reaccumulation because that's where where the clean move actually"
"22904590","22911490"," comes from right so there's no need to be in it at the peak and that's why i just like"
"22911490","22916210"," waiting and like i said a lot of times you know look for these highs and lows to form on"
"22916210","22921850"," a tuesday a lot of times and then you can hold it for the rest of the week yeah that's"
"22921850","22929250"," kind of very true we've kind of said anecdotally that tuesday lows are the weekly lows so you know"
"22929250","22936190"," they kind of jives with that uh that's it's almost always like that david right uh you're giving it"
"22936190","22940990"," and you're you're giving an opportunity for an orderly exit when we do have a correction usually"
"22942230","22948330"," usually at fair warning and a confirmation not always but you usually do yeah but you don't get a"
"22948330","22954770"," confirmation it's sometimes because of an exogenous event right so um but even the role in 2020"
"22955310","22962130"," even the even the role in uh 2022 uh we came back in march didn't we wasn't it like april"
"22962130","22969270"," april we rolled in january but we came back up uh so you everyone's panic selling right but we came"
"22969270","22974510"," straight back up to that uh to that roll over in early january if you were owning the underlying"
"22974510","22980570"," part of the market can you imagine just like losing 40 percent of your account and then you see it"
"22980570","22987110"," come back up and you could have accident uh in an orderly manner yeah in march or april when you"
"22987110","22991030"," wouldn't have lost any money it would have been flat but um you wouldn't have gotten torched either"
"22991030","22997090"," no and and that's what i was trying to say you know it's like you see these big moves and"
"22997090","23002650"," then you're you get this formal feeling but you have plenty of time to to reposition for it even"
"23002650","23008610"," covid man there was still if you remember trading covid from the role right this we still had a"
"23008610","23018930"," massive squeeze on the initial yeah"
"23018930","23025310"," you know nice uh exit by the way david on that yeah yeah i think you tell me why why"
"23025310","23030750"," i did that and why i you know look i've been i've been trading book map for 10 000 hours"
"23030750","23037390"," already for i don't know how long right and when i see the next version things yeah and and look"
"23037390","23043390"," the thing is it's very simple we have a better setup that is a little bit here are you guys"
"23043390","23049410"," able to see my book map yep i'm gonna draw it look there's this fair value gap thing here um"
"23049410","23057550"," in this area right here right and remember what i told you about the absorption part of it here if"
"23057550","23061930"," you look on the five-minute chart i'll show you in a minute this you have to be aware of"
"23061930","23067990"," this short zone and that's why i said i want to break above and hold and if we stall in"
"23067990","23073870"," that area it's it you know i become uneasy and it doesn't mean we're going to go down to zero"
"23073870","23079910"," you know but i'm grabbing my money and i'm running and i'm waiting for for basically a re-pricing"
"23079910","23086250"," and cap always says you know renegotiate your price so that's what i'm doing and i'm securing my"
"23086250","23090430"," profits and i don't care how far and how deep it goes and i'll just wait for a new setup"
"23090430","23096250"," to form even though i still have a bullish bias that we're going to go up here and it's the"
"23096250","23101370"," time of day like i said you know at 50 look what they do you know they press it down"
"23101370","23106510"," and you know they fuck everyone over and they create a trap and then the last 10 minutes they will"
"23106510","23112390"," do whatever move they want to do wow let's have a look on the creating view chart what i was"
"23112390","23121620"," talking about remember that that area that i drew out as over under we've traded into it but we"
"23121620","23126760"," didn't break above this fair value gap that i drew out where i wanted to see that confirmation"
"23126760","23134800"," break above um is anybody else in the back black screen because i don't not see anything right now"
"23134800","23144780"," i think i'm being dropped here can you see me no we're good we're back yeah they're very good yeah"
"23144780","23152140"," let me see if i can yeah so um let me have a look i think it has to do"
"23152140","23162540"," with trading view and like whenever my broker should open in it it will black it out hold on can"
"23162540","23172150"," you see it now my trap no okay what's a black screen again okay let me dot your face"
"23173610","23183360"," uh share a window and now perfect you might uh perfect okay we have uh end up one up right"
"23183360","23192020"," now yeah so you you know remember that the box over under that i drew on nq yeah we didn't"
"23192020","23197180"," break above it and hold it and retest it to go up doesn't mean that we can't go up there"
"23197180","23203520"," but you want these candle closures above it right so i know they're going to reaccumulate lower for"
"23203520","23209040"," them to go up and but you know i just decided to pull the plug because i want to secure"
"23209040","23215440"," the money in and i'll just really renegotiate the price at a lower place to get in yeah okay so"
