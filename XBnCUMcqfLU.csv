"XBnCUMcqfLU","0","10400"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here with your GellyBrief for December 22nd, 2021."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","10400","16200"," Happy Holidays gang, hope all as well with you out there in Twitterverse and YouTube world."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","16200","19160"," Hope you all have having a great week ahead of you."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","19160","23800"," Some of you will probably be taking some time off as we head into the holiday weekend."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","23800","29440"," Others out there, I'm assuming, will be trading right through Christmas and New Year's."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","29440","32320"," And I'll be here with you throughout the entire week."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","32320","39240"," I might not be here live on Thursday at some point unless there's a huge pivot in the market."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","39240","44480"," But you will get videos from me each day and live broadcasts whenever the market is at"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","44480","45480"," a critical pivot moment."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","45480","50160"," But I do want to take a moment to thank all of you for your support this year, especially"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","50160","52160"," as we wrap up this holiday season."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","52160","56120"," Couldn't have done this without you and can't continue to do it without your support."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","56120","58400"," So with that, let's just get into the rest of the week."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","58400","63960"," We're going to take a look at what we have going on here Wednesday and Thursday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","63960","67080"," These are pretty big information dumps that we have coming our way."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","67080","73560"," On Wednesday, we've got the GDP, Revision Revise, GDP, Consumer Confidence Index that has to"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","73560","74560"," do with inflation."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","74560","82760"," We have existing home sales and sometimes consumer confidence index can be used for negative"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","82760","83760"," news."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","83760","84760"," That's at 10 a.m."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","84760","85760"," to be aware of that."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","85840","90560"," We also have Vickspiration today, the role of Vicks in previous years."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","90560","95120"," It hasn't had too much impact on this time of year."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","95120","97520"," I wouldn't expect it to be a huge impact."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","97520","103760"," It even if it's used for a reason, for weakness in the market, I wouldn't be so sure that"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","103760","104760"," that's the real reason."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","104760","105760"," Okay."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","105760","106760"," And then on Thursday, we have more information dumps."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","106760","107760"," Right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","107760","113280"," We've got initial jobs claims, continuing claims, personal income, consumer spending,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","113280","116080"," court inflation, all kinds of stuff, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","116080","120600"," We've got huge information dumps, consumer sentiment index."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","120600","125200"," I think all these numbers are going to be somewhat glossed over."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","125200","129520"," You might find slight volatility out of these numbers unless there's something going on"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","129520","131080"," that we don't know about."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","131080","134480"," I highly doubt that they're going to hammer us this week."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","134480","135480"," No one's around."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","135480","136480"," It's possible, I guess."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","136480","137480"," It can happen."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","137480","138480"," It's always a possibility."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","139480","144800"," But heading into this holiday season, people have wrapped up their main street shops and"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","144800","145800"," all that kind of stuff."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","145800","148880"," I doubt that it happens today or tomorrow."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","148880","151080"," So what does that really mean for us heading into the rest of the week?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","151080","152720"," Thin trading, low volume."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","152720","153880"," We'll get into the charts."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","153880","161720"," I'm going to mostly rely upon the charts as we head into the coming days, rely upon volatility,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","161720","163040"," that kind of stuff."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","163040","165280"," Volume profile should be important right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","165280","167360"," There's been a nice little base built up."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","167360","168920"," We'll take a look at that stuff right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","168920","173040"," We're going to get into just the volume profile real quick."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","173040","175560"," We're going to look at ES."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","175560","177960"," You can see that we didn't slip under in the overnight."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","177960","179720"," We're starting to curl up right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","179720","182080"," We should have a nice base in here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","182080","186560"," But when we watch the book map together live during the daytime, we can see that that base"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","186560","188200"," is being built down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","188200","192480"," For 614, we saw that base get built yesterday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","192480","194680"," You see it continuing in the overnight."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","194680","202680"," We might trade around in this area here for 640.25 up to this 468."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","202680","210280"," We were talking about this wall was coming down slightly into yesterday live on book map."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","210280","211360"," It's actually down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","211360","214040"," We start to get some resistance at 4660."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","214040","221280"," And as we grind through this wall, as the week wraps up, we could end up grinding through"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","221280","223000"," this into Friday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","223640","226640"," Excuse me, Thursday for Christmas."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","226640","229720"," This would be the start of your Christmas rally."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","229720","233840"," After Christmas on Monday, you would have clear skies above here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","233840","239520"," Let's say we grind through and we melt up to touch 4,700 on Friday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","239520","245800"," Then if we came in on Monday here, let me see if I can show you guys this."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","246680","251400"," If we grind above this area into, let's say we get, absorb all these sellers heading"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","251400","257880"," into Monday, you end up forming this nice base back here and we have clear skies above."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","257880","263000"," And that takes us into that 4,700, 4,800 mark."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","263000","272400"," Now mind you, you do need to remember that we had buyers down below here at 4520 or so."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","272400","276960"," These buyers will begin to exit, let's say, at the 4,700 mark."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","276960","280840"," So you'll get some weakness in here for that next move up to 4,780."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","280840","286400"," Be aware of that as we move forward, people like to take profits when they buy bottoms"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","286400","293040"," and you'll have the next batch, hopefully, of buyers that will send us to that 4,780"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","293040","295480"," as we move into the new year, all right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","295480","300640"," So this is what the volume profile is telling us right now on ES."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","300640","301960"," This is looking healthy."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","301960","304280"," Some of this down here is, you know, kind of sketch it down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","304280","308440"," I'd really like to see us just grind through this stuff, build a bigger wall down below"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","308440","310400"," here if we can."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","310400","316320"," But all the three indexes, it's still healthier than it was, even though, believe it or not,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","316320","321800"," NDX or NASDAQ and believe it or not, I think we have much better overall."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","321800","324600"," So we're going to take a look at those next."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","324600","327600"," We'll look at, so, NQ."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","328600","332560"," Let me look at the regular contract here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","332560","334640"," And you can see the same thing, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","334640","337080"," We had a little bit of weakness in the overnight, no big deal."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","337080","341400"," Of course, we're squeezing up into the open this morning and you would expect that heading"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","341400","342400"," into today."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","342400","346640"," There is a lot of nice room in here to grind through nice sellers in here between the"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","346640","352520"," 16, this 15, 9, 67, should find some support at the open."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","352520","356880"," Any way that you can buy this dip today should help and we have a lot of room up here into"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","356880","363520"," the 16, 1, 4, 1 and we need to grind through this area here for a bigger push-up next"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","363520","364520"," week."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","364520","369320"," So you might see NDX or NASDAQ push-up pretty well today, okay?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","369320","375280"," Or trade within this range kind of bouts around, grind out all these sellers into the following"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","375280","376280"," week."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","376280","382600"," That would, if this, if NASDAQ ends up pushing up into the new year, you would see a move"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","382600","383600"," much higher."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","383600","387760"," That's that 16, 900 that I talked about."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","387760","389640"," And we have one other issue in NASDAQ."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","389640","394720"," Let's say we get up into this area bounce around, maybe you even see, you start looking"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","394720","399640"," for those plays that we've been connecting the dots on, I keep showing you guys, order"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","399640","406080"," flow for trades into January, February, those are the ones you want to focus on."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","406080","411840"," You also want to be focused on any single stocks in NASDAQ that can squeeze higher in"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","411840","413000"," this time period."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","413000","417600"," You could find some up and down trading in here, some grinding in NASDAQ, the index"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","417600","423680"," itself, whereas if you're focusing on single stocks that haven't beaten down, some speculative"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","423680","424680"," growth type stuff."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","424680","428920"," We talked about all these stocks, right, PayPal, Pins, we've talked, I have a list of them"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","428920","433960"," that I read off to you guys all the time, Uber, any of these beaten down stocks that"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","433960","438600"," you know about out there should catch a bid because they've been so beaten down, hedge"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","438600","443000"," walls are so low right now, we're moving higher into positive gamma, a flip zone,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","443000","445320"," you can show you that in a minute here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","445320","450920"," So NASDAQ could end up being kind of meh, next few days, you want the work to be done"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","450920","455120"," here before you take a nice fat long, you could get up here tomorrow, let's say, right,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","455120","459880"," you go up here and bash around a little bit and the grind starts, okay."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","459880","463840"," When this grind starts, you want to let the banks do this work and then jump back board"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","463840","464840"," again above."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","465320","471640"," So expect that ceiling somewhere around 16144 by volume profile, and then we're going"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","471640","480520"," to look at the RTY, you can see why I'm talking about this nice space above on NASDAQ."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","480520","488360"," There is some nice space above here on IWM, RTY, the ROT, the Russell, in reality."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","488360","492600"," If you're going to play, if you're going to look at an index that had the most potential"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","492600","496600"," to go much, much higher, it's going to be the Russell."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","496600","500480"," This base building back here is monstrous, it really is."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","500480","504960"," That's the one thing that no one's been paying attention to is meanwhile, ROT has been down"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","504960","511920"," for so long now, NASDAQ has been down for so long now, that a base is formed to lift"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","511920","513880"," off from, right."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","513880","518760"," So you can see the Russell curling up slightly, you're going to have some traders out there"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","518760","523320"," that say this is value area high, and we're going to sell down to this value area low"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","523320","524320"," at 21281."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","524320","528080"," In reality, I'm doubting these numbers right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","528080","532920"," When you start to look further back in time, this is looking like base building to me and"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","532920","538360"," it looks like you've got thin sellers above here, you could wind up seeing some nice upward"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","538360","545880"," movement from now into the first or the second week of January 228, 230, or some price targets"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","545960","550440"," in my mind, and you have to look further back as to what's been going on in the market."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","550440","552440"," It's been going on since November, okay."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","552440","555800"," This is only a 10 day, it's not 15 minute, a 10 day."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","555800","560520"," When you start looking at the two month, three month charts on this stuff, the grind has been"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","560520","565240"," so significant that it's normal for us to just come above here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","565240","569360"," So I'm going to be watching the IDAMM closely, I think that a lot of the bulls are going to"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","569360","574160"," be watching IDAMM closely, the ROT, there's a lot of potential here to be moving up over"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","574160","575160"," the next month."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","575640","579880"," The three weeks to four weeks, and then we're going to take a look back on the charts and"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","579880","582280"," this should help you out much better."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","582280","586920"," So on the, this is the ES chart, it's slightly different than the spy, I'll publish these"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","586920","591560"," charts for trading view for you on Twitter this morning and there's some things you want"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","591560","593400"," to be looking at today, okay."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","593400","598960"," So you're by the dip zone is somewhere down here at 4, 5, 9, 3, you'll be buying these"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","598960","599960"," dips down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","599960","603880"," This is all positive gamma here, if you can see we're not in negative gamma, your viewpoint"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","603880","607040"," from this point forward should not be, we're selling the market."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","607040","611480"," That's the bear plan in the coming days that we're going to keep slowly selling down until"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","611480","613880"," we hit this 4, 4, 8 for another retest."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","613880","618640"," I'm not buying that right now, I'm going to be buying any dips down here, 4, 5, 9, 4,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","618640","619640"," I'm all over it."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","619640","625080"," For 4, 6, 100, I'm all over it, this is all positive gamma territory up here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","625080","630880"," You'll be lucky if you even get to buy this area to this morning at 4, 6, 40, you might"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","630880","635320"," have some, this chart shows something different than what I saw on book map today."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","635320","643120"," There is some resistance kicking around, some grind at the 4, 6, 5, 4, 6, 100 and close yesterday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","643120","648080"," Once we get past that, it should be some form of a trade up to 4, 700."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","648080","653440"," You'll experience some volatility as we hit the 4, 6, 88, 4, 6, 95 area and that's for"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","653440","655920"," that tag at 4, 7, 1."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","655920","659080"," And what are you looking for here, same thing as yesterday, you're looking for what the"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","659080","660080"," reaction is."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","660080","664240"," We're either going to make our way above here into Friday, bounce down and then make"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","664240","670160"," our way up to 47, 80 into next week in the first couple of weeks of January."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","670160","673400"," So this morning when we wake up, what am I looking for, we're looking for what the open"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","673400","674400"," does, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","674400","677480"," If we start selling down, we get a green bar up and then start selling down here, I'm"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","677480","680960"," going to buy the Dipper to 4,600 all day long."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","680960","684760"," We know the smart money is down here at 4,500, they're going to take some of that profit"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","684760","689600"," as we get above here at this 4,700, right, this zone here, it'll take some profit, we'll"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","689600","695840"," swing back down to 4,600 and the original buyers will want to hold into 47, 80 and hopefully"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","695840","701880"," that's when those 4,500 buyers will swing up, you'll find that big river of liquidity"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","701880","708240"," joined forces with the 4,600 people, pushes up to the 47, 88 and that's what it's looking"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","708240","710480"," for as we move forward."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","710480","714400"," So I'll show you a better place to be buying the dips here on the Spy Chart."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","714400","720560"," At the moment, we're going to head over to Nasdaq, sorry to be so quiet this morning"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","720560","724600"," in the family around for the holidays."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","724600","730320"," We're going to take us to the same look here at Nasdaq and this is what I was talking about"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","730320","734160"," in here, you're going to be looking for some form of consolidation in here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","734160","739080"," We talked about 16, 100 up here by volume profile, you might swing up in here, bounce"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","739080","744600"," around, right, or just get up here, starts grinding that iceberg and then slam our way"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","744600","746760"," forward into 16,238."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","746760","753600"," Now the absolute gap of strikes at 16,238, that is my one concern is when we get up here,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","753600","759240"," we really need people to be making big, big, big bets into January for some of big tech"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","759240","762680"," and we've seen some of it but not a ton of it."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","762680","767960"," There are some buyers though on some major stocks, I think we looked at a few of tech"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","767960","771920"," stocks that had some major support single ticker stocks."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","771920","778040"," I really would be focusing, once we get up here to this 16,100 zone up here, let's say"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","778040","783000"," you're playing the cues, I'd be getting out of this right here and then focus directly"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","783000","789000"," on specific single speculative growth, growth stocks, tech stocks, and that will help us"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","789000","793560"," to push above here and then make that move up to 16,900."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","793560","797200"," Nothing's negative here until you break below 15,775 right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","797200","800240"," This is volatility trigger here is when things will get nasty."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","800240","810960"," I would be a buyer of a NASDAQ down here at 15,781 at any point this week in the cues."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","810960","815200"," Otherwise, I think I'm going to let the cues do its thing over here and I'm going to focus"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","815200","816200"," on even myself."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","816200","820480"," I should be, I'm going to take a look at some of the big bang man stocks and some of the"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","820480","824280"," beaten down tech as we open tomorrow and if I find anything that looks like it's going"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","824280","828400"," to squeeze up or has a potential to or if I see anything in book map, then we can go"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","828400","833200"," live at some point and you guys can say, hey, I really want to be trading PayPal today"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","833200","835040"," or whatever stock you guys like Uber."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","835040","836040"," Where's Uber going?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","836040","840200"," That kind of stuff and we'll look at those and see if it's clear skies above."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","840200","845120"," Let's look at RTY real quick, kind of got the same thing going on right, huge potential"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","845120","846120"," in here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","846120","850520"," RTY is kind of in my view, in my book, as I move into the rest of the week, I'm going"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","850520","852080"," to be looking for trading this."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","852080","855360"," You can see this is beautiful clear skies above here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","855360","860840"," They basically got by the dip down here at 2188, prime prime example of how beautiful"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","860840","861840"," this chart looks."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","861840","866760"," We've got volatility below, right, you got by the dip situation down here at 2138, cut"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","866760","870920"," your losses anything below here, but I'm not expecting us to get this deep."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","870920","873920"," I'm looking for a dip bike tomorrow on the bell, 2187."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","873920","876960"," I want to ride this baby right up, 228, 230."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","876960","878960"," I even already have some spreads out there."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","878960","881440"," I've got some straight calls out there."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","881440","885480"," Looking long to go to 230, this is clear skies here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","885480","887440"," There's not many sellers in here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","887440","890560"," We've destroyed sellers since November."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","890560","894240"," We have ripped down this market since November."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","894240","898400"," I am very bullish right now on IWM, I'm very bullish on small caps right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","898400","900400"," I'll even post about it on Twitter."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","900400","902760"," I don't know what some of these bears are talking about."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","902760","906560"," This stuff right here will just melt up spy."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","906560","907560"," It will."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","907560","909720"," It'll melt up parts of MDX or NASDAQ."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","909720","913000"," You're going to see this happen with this trade going on this week."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","913000","915480"," This is the trade to be watching."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","915480","917080"," We're going to look real quick at spy."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","917080","918760"," I'm going to get back on the one day."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","918760","920760"," I think I was looking back in last December."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","920760","926400"," There were some comparable things to be looking at here, and we're going to take a look down"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","926400","927400"," here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","927400","928680"," This is what I'm talking about with the bears."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","928680","933440"," They're going to try telling you tomorrow and Thursday that's doom and gloom."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","933440","937280"," They're going to tell you that we're turning here, and this is a corrective."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","937280","938280"," I'll even show it to you."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","938280","939280"," This is what the bears are thinking."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","939280","940280"," They're going to come down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","940280","941280"," I'm going to think we're going to come up here, and we're going to start failing down."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","941280","942280"," They're looking for this right here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","942280","943280"," Do I see that happening?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","943280","944280"," No."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","944280","945280"," Why do I not see that happening?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","945280","950640"," I don't see it happening because we're in positive gamma."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","950640","960960"," I would have believed in this if we had closed down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","960960","965040"," You wanted to see this failure somewhere down in here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","965040","966760"," The bears couldn't commit down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","966760","970000"," They took the money, and they ran, and they should have."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","970000","974360"," This move right here is a good, great move."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","974360","978360"," You're very taking money and you run, and they were expecting that continued sellback."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","978360","979960"," This is where you'll see that corrective move."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","979960","982520"," When you see something like this, the bulls are in charge."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","982520","983520"," I'm sorry."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","983520","986120"," I decided to say if that's what it is."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","986120","987120"," I like to do measures."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","987120","989560"," I don't know if I'm going to have a bumble with a bust in an Elliott wave, guys."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","989560","996640"," It's part of the Elliott wave process, but I'm looking at that right there."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","996640","1001920"," I'm looking for that swing over there, and some of this starts to make sense, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1001920","1004440"," Start seeing that price target above."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1004440","1006800"," That doesn't shock me to see that happening in the future."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1006800","1008080"," What am I looking for?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1008080","1011040"," I'm looking for any dip buy that I can do down here at 460."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1011040","1017280"," I'm going to be looking for some volatility above in this 465, 466 range."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1017280","1022440"," Maybe jump out and let the robots do it, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1023160","1028160"," We could even end up trading inside of this zone with this possibility right here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1028160","1033800"," So we sell down, we bounce around in here, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1033800","1040920"," And then eventually, we eventually at Sam Thursday, Wood's Thursday, right here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1040920","1043320"," We do some kind of goofiness like this."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1043320","1045800"," We have some kind of a slow melt up into Friday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1045800","1049160"," We hit the 470, and we're good to go, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1049160","1051800"," And what would you see into Monday?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1051800","1058920"," You would see some sort of a take profit to see either bounce here at 464 or even 460."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1058920","1064920"," And then we make our way above to this 478 by the 31st, right there."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1064920","1067080"," Something like that, I would expect."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1067080","1069640"," I'd be a buyer of any of these dips."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1069640","1074000"," So anything in here, like I'd say we dip this down, dip this to here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1074000","1075840"," We dip this to here, I'm a buyer here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1075840","1082320"," I find a new support up here at 464, maybe some moments where we're trading down or this"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1082320","1084920"," 478 to maybe extend it a little farther out."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1084920","1087320"," I could see something like that, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1087320","1090960"," Bounce around in here, and then we hit 478 in the second week of January."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1090960","1095880"," But even if it's stretched out and time-wise, you're looking for these key levels to be"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1095880","1098720"," buying with some time on your calls to get up to 478."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1098720","1100720"," So what's my plan for tomorrow, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1100720","1102520"," How do I wrap this up with you guys?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1102520","1104080"," I am a buyer down here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1104080","1105360"," Anything down here I'm buying."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1105840","1107600"," This is all game of flip up here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1107600","1111240"," So if we get any weakness into tomorrow, I'm buying it."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1111240","1115560"," If we come back down here and you hear bears screaming and yelling at you tomorrow saying,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1115560","1119960"," look, you gave up all your profits from the day before."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1119960","1124640"," You know that the snapback levels at 461.16, that's a gift."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1124640","1127200"," If I get that gift tomorrow, I'm buying it."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1127200","1128880"," And they might not give you that gift."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1128880","1133320"," My assumption right now is that these buyers down here and the way that the flow was coming"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1133320","1135960"," yesterday, that's order flow."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1135960","1141280"," That's not just options flow and gamma that's been moving, which I want to make note of."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1141280","1147080"," We are our positive gammas expanding up and our negative gamma from below is coming up."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1147080","1152760"," So we're shifting and to shift all of these charts as we move forward because of our clothes"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1152760","1153760"," yesterday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1153760","1155240"," Everything came up yesterday."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1155240","1159440"," So we've got higher walls from below and we've got higher walls above."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1159440","1161480"," So keep that in mind as we move forward."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1161480","1162480"," This is a gift."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1162480","1166040"," I know that we trade down on this, but if they do, this would be the one opportunity"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1166040","1167040"," that bears have."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1167040","1172040"," If they've missed the boat so far, hopefully make this move up to 470."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1172040","1174760"," And you know, we're on board right now to trade higher."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1174760","1179520"," I would be concerned as we head into, you're going to hear a lot of these, you're going"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1179520","1186760"," to hear news about by defensive stocks because they've been doing so well."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1186760","1190520"," It'd be really cautious that stuff as we head into January, February, you might be"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1190520","1196400"," the one bag holding when our market does sell off in March, I would be really wary."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1196400","1197400"," So I guess not."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1197400","1198400"," So I guess you get some of you guys are."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1198400","1200600"," I saw a lot of trades in Nike."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1200600","1201600"," Nike went up, I think."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1201600","1202600"," I'm not sure."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1202600","1203600"," Let me take a look at Nike."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1203600","1208760"," But I know that's one of the goofy fucking plays that Morgan Stanley has been pushing right."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1208760","1210360"," You can see the buy right here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1210360","1214640"," And this to me looks more like this looks like bot selling, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1214640","1216720"," We sell down, we push back up."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1217160","1221520"," They have a lot of call flow today in Nike for this trade that NMS is telling people"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1221520","1222520"," to buy."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1222520","1225880"," But this looks more like we're going to sell up a bunch more bag holders, sell down, spike"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1225880","1226880"," back up."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1226880","1231600"," Same thing as we sell off this kind of a trade into early year, be aware of that."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1231600","1232600"," Okay."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1232600","1233600"," And move forward."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1233600","1237880"," Nike is not really a beaten down stock, but you still look at Nike, take a look at Nike."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1237880","1238880"," Okay."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1238880","1240880"," That's not looking like you here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1240880","1245720"," Let's look at the one year in Nike is a pretty, pretty powerful move up here."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1246080","1247080"," They sold this down."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1247080","1248760"," They drove it back up."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1248760","1252480"," My, my thought is they're going to sell it down, drive it back up, sell it back down"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1252480","1257760"," and unwind themselves from this trade that they get down here at 131."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1257760","1262160"," So be just be cautious of this, this trade heading into the new year, this trade kind"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1262160","1263160"," of bothers me."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1263160","1266080"," I don't dislike it, but I'm wary of it."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1266080","1275680"," Trades like this remind me of RK back in 2021, 2022, back in 2019, 2020, leading into 2021."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1276680","1277880"," Makes all these huge gains."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1277880","1278880"," Everything's wonderful."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1278880","1279880"," Everybody's high five."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1279880","1284040"," And in the end of like March, up here at 185 and you're stuck holding the bag, 200."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1284040","1288840"," You're stuck holding the bag up here and this, this Nike trade sells down for an entire"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1288840","1289840"," year."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1289840","1294680"," I could be wrong on this, but I'm telling you, it's, it smells to me, smells."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1294680","1298080"," It might be great for day trading the next couple of weeks, but it smells real bad to"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1298080","1299080"," me."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1299080","1301200"," And Nike is this high up right now."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1301200","1304560"," And even if it does shoot up, let's say it shoots up 200, 230, 250."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1304560","1308880"," You tell me you're going to bag hold that in March, crazy, they can be going to bag"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1308880","1309880"," hold that in March."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1309880","1310880"," You're absolutely crazy."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1310880","1317440"," If I'm down here at 125, tell me you're going to hold this at 225 or 250 come in spring"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1317440","1318440"," time."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1318440","1319440"," And it says no."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1319440","1321000"," So maybe you can run this up, right?"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1321000","1325520"," You're like really cool, David Day trader, you buy these dips for the run up, let's say"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1325520","1330120"," it's fine, but I would not be investing in Nike in 2022, you're investing in a stock"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1330120","1336360"," of them down for a year, like RK or whatever, RQ, something, you know, if you don't like"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1336360","1340040"," Kathy's stuff, you don't have to invest in that, but find some better stocks and buy"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1340040","1345560"," in something that's already way up here 179, okay, or at least I will, you can do what"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1345560","1346560"," you want."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1346560","1349800"," I don't really care sometimes with some of you guys out there doing that's no offense"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1349800","1357840"," either, but I'm looking for stocks that have been beaten down for a whole year into, into"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1357840","1358840"," next year."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1359280","1360600"," You guys know what they are."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1360600","1365480"," I've shown you guys growth stocks that are just climbing the banks and moving them and"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1365480","1368600"," I'll introduce them more to you as the weeks progress."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1368600","1375560"," Now I'm going to leave you with one last thing on us having a toast for anyone that's supported"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1375560","1380120"," me, trying to grow this channel, trying to grow the handle, trying to get some training"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1380120","1385400"," classes done, run book map, all that stuff for you guys, I'm going to be doing a buy"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1385400","1390160"," me a bear kind of a thing every week, right, so this week we're, instead of doing it on"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1390160","1393640"," Wednesday today, you might do a one, you might have a bear together or something today,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1393640","1398600"," but we're going to have a zoom call, a live zoom call for 100 of you that want to join"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1398600","1403200"," and just relax, have just a quick talk, so that I can hear your ideas."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1403200","1406920"," I really want to hear who you guys are out there, who you girls out there, women, men,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1406920","1407920"," whatever, wherever you guys are."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1407920","1412840"," I don't care what you call yourselves, I'm a pretty easy guy, so, but I do want to know"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1412840","1413840"," who you guys are, you know."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1413840","1420000"," I want you guys to somewhat form a group of people that can trade together as bulls"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1420000","1425880"," and bears, take the big bear trade, take the big bull trades together, and you guys can,"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1425880","1430600"," this is what these other people do, right, so you might as well help each other out become"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1430600","1437080"," better traders, help each other out to make money and kind of use a group of people with"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1437080","1442040"," resources together to find out where the market's going, okay, and even if you go your own way"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1442040","1446760"," at least you have that input, that you can bounce your thesis off other people."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1446760","1450680"," You don't always have to trade what I trade or what other traders trade, but at least"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1450680","1454320"," you can say, hey, look, I want to take this market short down here and find out what the"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1454320","1456160"," group has to say about it."
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1456160","1460160"," Sometimes it's nice to listen to people that you trust to say, yeah, you can do that, but"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1460160","1464080"," put this on, or this is what I would do, I know there's some people out there that follow"
"XBnCUMcqfLU","1464080","1469520"," me on these videos here, and they trade much more complex trades, so if you're a complex"
