"15510","20810"," This specific livestream, if you could just repost it that way, no one's like, hey, didn't say this"
"20810","21790"," or didn't say that or whatever."
"22230","23250"," We have to talk about it."
"23330","23550"," It's important. "
"24310","30630"," This is an important moment to the market for you as a participant, even if you're a seller,"
"30630","37330"," there's a lot of important information you need to have or where we are and what's taking place"
"37330","38050"," this morning."
"38050","43650"," Sometimes I'll say these things and we come back and people say, yeah, you said this and we're"
"43650","47930"," going to look at December, if we have, let's see if we can look at December really quick."
"50350","52350"," I think 30 minute chart is fine for December. "
"53010","57170"," We're going to look at December, hold on here, we're going to go to a full trigger screen."
"57170","64470"," I think it was December, yeah, right down in here, right here."
"64790","70130"," I said December, my fact this, I think this is the December move right here. "
"70270","74290"," I want to talk about two important timeframes."
"76410","83890"," We can look at, we can actually look at, so this is December right here."
"84750","85950"," This was actually it. "
"86190","87210"," I think this was the big one."
"92640","93980"," This was the big one right here."
"95220","97020"," I don't know if you guys remember that. "
"100640","104360"," This one right here and then this one right here too is kind of big as well."
"106840","116760"," Now we can look back over here and we're going to talk about, what is"
"116760","117340"," this right here?"
"117500","120140"," This is March, right?"
"120140","121600"," So let's start back here, okay?"
"125620","132280"," So I want to, it's easier to show this on a daily chart, a one day chart."
"132920","134180"," Let's stick it to the one day chart. "
"141080","142340"," There's a one day chart here."
"142460","146720"," We're going to look at, I don't know if we should look at SPX maybe, well we can do it."
"146860","148380"," It's maybe it's better to show on SPX. "
"162710","164690"," Okay, right here."
"166880","173610"," Now let's look back in time here and whenever we break below, whenever price breaks below, or not"
"173610","183070"," price, whenever the daily trigger crosses, whenever the daily trigger crosses the monthly over"
"183070","183630"," here, right?"
"184210","184890"," Watch right here."
"187630","194350"," Now we go into a risk off type scenario for major downside moves. "
"194630","197730"," It's very, very dangerous in here when we break through this."
"197910","205590"," So if you're watching this cross, nope, not that cross, that one right there."
"207450","212310"," That usually signifies high risk to the market for major downside to come. "
"213030","217230"," Now, we don't always have follow through."
"218290","225110"," You can see this pull back up here, we got above right, bounced around, started rocking off, came"
"225110","228570"," back down to check it, and then we're off and running again."
"229250","231030"," But you have to think about it, okay?"
"231570","238950"," My point here being that, so you get the cross right here, you see that cross, see"
"238950","244470"," the first cross here, right?"
"244710","246730"," So this is a time for warning. "
"247630","252230"," Not necessarily, hey, we're going to crash, but risk off warning, okay?"
"252750","255110"," So the other break is right here."
"255709","258310"," You're automatically in a risk off warning."
"258709","263050"," Now if it resolves itself, everything is fine and you don't have to worry about it, okay?"
"263810","268870"," If we rejected to the downside, you would have been warned in case if you had more downside to"
"268870","269070"," come. "
"269750","272070"," Does that example make sense to you at least?"
"272770","276910"," And then when we're over here, I'm going to show you some other examples of this too."
"277550","282470"," You get the big cross right here, you get the big giant cross here, and then a bloodbath down."
"283010","286030"," Same thing over here, bloodbath down on the monthly trigger. "
"286570","292730"," Same thing over here, major slam, slam, slam, violent, high volatility moves, right?"
"292950","294710"," And then you can also see it right in here, right?"
"294890","296670"," Like wam, wam, wam, wam, right?"
"296980","300750"," The risk off is the warning is taken off and we rocket ship to the upside."
"301170","308870"," So this isn't to say because we're here, this isn't to say that we're going to crash, we're going"
"308870","309910"," to crash, doom and gloom."
"310750","315490"," But when you get the yellow line crossing that orange line, it leads to high volatility. "
"316290","322010"," So when you're looking at this cross that's taking place right now, see that yellow line crossing"
"322010","328350"," the orange line over here, when this cross takes place, it triggers three things."
"329110","338950"," It triggers extreme volatility, it also triggers a risk off warning, it needs to be"
"338950","339250"," confirmed."
"340190","349090"," So when we're down here trading this right here, when this happens, right, what it leads to is"
"349090","351970"," volatility, major, major volatility. "
"352990","359230"," And what the sellers are going to be looking for here is whatever this move is down, if it's to"
"359230","362170"," the monthly, if it's below the monthly, it doesn't really matter."
"362710","371150"," What really matters is the swing high, if that gets rejected, it's going to lead to some pretty big"
"371150","373070"," destruction in the marketplace."
"373070","381910"," So we have a risk off warning, it's not confirmed yet, but you're going to be looking for it. "
"382030","388810"," So we're talking to Joe this morning about it, let me see if I can, I'm going to write some"
"388810","393010"," stuff out here on the screen for you so that you, so this is Claire's day, okay."
"394670","396270"," This cross right here, right?"
"398550","407250"," So the cross, cross of daily trigger, below weekly trigger,"
"407790","412370"," brings risk off warning."
"416130","420790"," The other thing that you need to understand above this though is it will still need to be confirmed"
"422490","431830"," and if confirmed,"
"434510","444260"," you will likely be offered, you will likely be offered an exit"
"444260","444880"," strategy. "
"449280","451180"," We'll leave that up there like that."
"451760","458000"," So cross of the DT below the WT brings risk off warning will still need to be confirmed, if"
"458000","460140"," confirmed, you will likely be offered an exit strategy."
"460960","468240"," And what this implies here is that none of this matters, okay, it's not going to go straight to the"
"468240","472200"," depth of how, what it's going to do, it's going to bounce, right, and it's going to ricochet up. "
"472500","478240"," So regardless of where that bounce is, you would still need to confirm it here, does that make"
"478240","478480"," sense?"
"481420","483580"," So you've got the move down over here, right?"
"483960","489400"," You've got, you'll have a swing high and then a blast down below and then you get the rejections"
"489400","490420"," and all that kind of stuff."
"490860","497020"," Start pinning up here, rejecting, we start looking for the next available level and that is going"
"497020","501720"," to be on SPX347087."
"502860","504940"," So none of this is good, this is very unhealthy. "
"504940","509160"," As a matter of fact, it's going to also matter how we close this week out."
"509980","514240"," Do you see, I want you to see this error, we see this orange line right here, we close this"
"514240","520640"," week out, you'll start to see the orange line head lower, you'll see the daily trigger begin to"
"520640","525260"," race down next week and we'll begin to make some violent moves up and down."
"526080","532460"," Now the caveat that I was talking to Joe about this morning to this would be, the one caveat to"
"532460","541580"," this this morning that I wanted to leave Joe with was, even with this alert of a risk off, you're"
"541580","550180"," going to likely, a high likely high probability, you'll likely be giving a chance to exit long or"
"550180","553620"," short, listen to me closely on this, long or short. "
"553900","560220"," So if you are a seller or a buyer, it's not going to really matter, what does matter to you"
"560220","568220"," is, let's say you're short right now, right, and you're like, everything is awesome, we're going to"
"568220","573280"," crash this, all this stuff and if the market turns on you and it starts to rip higher, you're"
"573280","575160"," likely going to see us come right back down again."
"575760","580380"," If you're a bull and you're like, hey, I'm trying to buy this dip down here and you get caught"
"580380","585140"," in it, you're likely going to see the market rip higher, let's say you're upside down or something,"
"585280","587700"," you're going to see it rip higher and give you a chance to make some money."
"587700","594120"," So if I guess, maybe I'm describing that wrong, key point here is, as this volatility will"
"594120","598740"," increase, you're going to be given chances if you're in the wrong to be in the right regardless,"
"599360","599840"," does that make sense?"
"600300","606420"," So long short doesn't matter, you're going to see violence from this point forward and you're going"
"606420","608700"," to see some wild ass moves. "
"609040","616420"," If you are a seller, you're still waiting for that 430 rejection or even slightly higher, we could"
"616420","621920"," blast above that 430 and then put still come back down a check 430 and if that check doesn't hold,"
"622180","626600"," that is the boom, exit the market, get the fuck on out, things are going to get violent."
"626840","636340"," And we're going to go back to January of, we're going to go back to January here, we'll go back"
"636340","645570"," right here really quick to January of 2022 as a fine example of this."
"646230","650770"," So you've got the initial role here, right?"
"651110","652870"," Watch this cross right here, do you see that?"
"653770","654670"," That's the cross. "
"656210","661170"," Do you see how price, do you see how price came back up to check it?"
"662750","664030"," Look closely here."
"666770","674990"," You get the blood back down right, you get the squeeze back up over here and then the rip down,"
"675230","677770"," there's still a daily chart and spy by the way."
"678870","685870"," Some more blood down here but the key point is, it's a giant liquidity grab right here. "
"686970","693170"," But you still have the cross that's still viable right on the yellow and orange and that's where"
"693170","694230"," things got really nasty."
"694430","699870"," If you were in the market in January of my point that I'm trying to make to you here is"
"700910","706810"," if you're in the market long, I wasn't at this point but if you were along at this point in"
"706810","715490"," the market, the key point, the key driver would be that once this trigger started right here, once"
"715490","722110"," that started and you're like, oh shit, I'm going to cut here, right, I'm going to cut panic sell,"
"722850","727650"," there was still one more opportunity to exit the market actually near where you were before."
"727950","730130"," You see that like way back here in December. "
"730510","733670"," So if you're a bull, don't panic."
"734830","742610"," They can still resolve the upside too, even though this went down, had price gone higher, you would"
"742610","744930"," have had an opportunity to reposition again to the upside."
"745370","751790"," So the only key thing that you need to know here right now is that we are definitely risk off,"
"752130","755210"," definitely risk off waiting for confirmation. "
"756410","762670"," Now I do want to show you this December area here, I think this was December, and we had the"
"762670","764210"," same kind of a situation over here."
"764950","770210"," We resolved to the upside, same thing over here, hey we're going to crash, resolve to the upside."
"770210","778190"," So what we can't, what you don't want to do is this, what you don't want to do here"
"778190","788130"," is you don't want to, you know, panic sell this, right, you're like, oh shit, cap"
"788130","795190"," saying we're having a crash warning, right, you panic sell this, we squeeze way back up here, even"
"795190","799470"," higher, and you could have gotten out way up here, you understand what I'm saying?"
"799470","801770"," Even if it's going to continue to the downside. "
"802790","812690"," So don't be a seller here, be a seller up here, yeah, you need to impress upon you the"
"812690","818510"," importance of where you are a seller, does that make sense?"
"819210","822650"," And also impress important, so let's say you're selling, let's say, I think if you're like a bull"
"822650","826190"," that says you want to, if you're a bull wanting to sell right here, you should have been a seller"
"826190","826470"," here."
"826470","831950"," If you were a bear and you were selling this, you still have that chance to come back down over"
"831950","834830"," here and not get caught down here, does that make sense?"
"835670","841610"," So just be, be, you know, I guess the idea is the swings are going to be wild and whether"
"841610","846810"," it resolves the upside or not, let's say, let's say you're like, I got a short right here, you'll"
"846810","853190"," at least be given a chance over here with resolution to the upside to exit here rather than up"
"853190","853430"," here."
"853430","856950"," If you're a seller here, you get squeezed up here, you'd stay short until that happens. "
"857850","864630"," So just don't be, just don't be the wrong time trying to sell, but anyway, right now, there is"
"864630","872350"," danger in the marketplace, absolutely 100%, have we broken trend, no, we have not, if you check"
"872350","880490"," trend right here, you see this low right here, we still have not broken trend, so trend still alive"
"880490","887710"," to the upside, bit bulls have hanging by a string, but bears are definitely, see that blue line"
"887710","893810"," right here, bears are definitely going to want to smash down into this, create as much panic as"
"893810","900710"," possible in fear, and then get that giant squeeze up for that continuation to the downside."
"901190","909430"," So just be aware of the mechanics of how this works itself out and what it can lead to, it"
"909430","919010"," major downsides in the marketplace, do not ever take a cross of this yellow and orange line"
"919010","927650"," as meaning nothing, it means a lot, it's a severe, expect wild shit to come from this point"
"927650","928050"," forward."
"928270","938250"," So I need you to at least understand that the power of that move can be seen today,"
"938270","942970"," tomorrow, just this cross right here, it's a one minute chart right here, just this cross right"
"942970","945990"," here is extreme bearishness and extreme bearish is the marketplace. "
"946750","952430"," Now, I don't know what's setting this off, I'm not that I don't, I'm assuming that it's front"
"952430","961090"," running an anticipation of the end of rate heights, so these banks are going to front run this shit"
"961090","962550"," early and they don't care."
"963230","969030"," So whether, now if you're, I'm assuming you, you're thinking that that process is going to take one"
"969030","974410"," month, right, you're a seller or a barrier, probably like, hey, we're going to crash today or this"
"974410","978990"," week and we're going to restart the market because I'm positioned short."
"979430","986490"," The process should take into at least springtime to take from now into, so then what are we in"
"986490","989250"," right now, we're in November, basically, right. "
"989810","994330"," So next two months and then another three months, that's five months of downside action it's going"
"994330","1000870"," to take, but you need to, at this point, be prepared for that downside action and to be selling any"
"1000870","1002350"," and all rips at this point."
"1002630","1008310"," So if I were to say, hey, cap, do you have a bear suit on today, I don't, but I"
"1008310","1008570"," will."
"1009070","1013870"," So my bear suit will come on above at that 430, 440 area. "
"1014030","1016650"," If we can roll that back down, it's going to become sell the market."
"1017430","1023690"," So the bear suit is standing by, I should say, it's not like I'm not wearing it right now, but"
"1023690","1026230"," I'm going to be wearing it here very soon."
"1026849","1029270"," Next month or two, you're going to see the full bear come out. "
"1029470","1038690"," So be conscious of it when it's happening when it back when we were streaming back in September,"
"1039109","1045930"," October, November of 2021 and I was telling people, hey, this is the time to get out, right?"
"1046270","1050670"," And now start to get out of Apple, all the big ones that the banks were supporting with corporate"
"1050670","1051230"," debt bonds."
"1052070","1056990"," I was like, hey, some of this might get held up and it did, we kept squeezing up into the"
"1056990","1062550"," beginning of the year, but then we finally got that roll in January and we got the confirmation"
"1062550","1067370"," heading into, I believe, April or March or something like that, then the real selling started."
"1068090","1073150"," So this, this should be a process should be two, three, four, five months. "
"1073610","1078230"," Anyone out there that tells you like, hey, crash today, Black Monday, that stuff is wrong."
"1079470","1080410"," They are wrong."
"1080510","1081530"," It's normally takes time. "
"1082270","1089450"," Even in COVID being like a major moment in the market, we still had major squeezing that took place"
"1089450","1090490"," for those confirmations."
"1091030","1095750"," That big roll that happened in COVID where we're still giant squeezes up and then we confirmed it"
"1095750","1099050"," to roll over, I'm not going to expect a COVID type of roll."
"1099370","1107650"," There's no reason for there to be that kind of a crash fundamentally or technically, but be aware"
"1107650","1107970"," of it. "
"1108290","1112450"," Okay, so if you're a market participant, if you're a bull out there, right, I need you to, I'm what"
"1112450","1113270"," you guys know of a bull."
"1114030","1122790"," I need you to know that you are, you are being set up right now for confirmation, you're being set"
"1122790","1130010"," up right now for confirmation of the market to crash into February, April of next year."
"1130250","1131430"," Now it could take even longer. "
"1131590","1141030"," It could take the entire year, believe it or not, but you're, you're, if you're a bull, your only"
"1141030","1145970"," thing that you're doing at this point is looking to sell 430, 440, something like that."
"1146190","1147090"," You're looking for that."
"1147450","1153170"," If you don't see the will from buyers to step in up there and reverse it to the upside, you"
"1153170","1153670"," are not a buyer. "
"1153850","1155930"," You risk off at this point with cash in the market."
"1156430","1160490"," If you're a seller, you have the potential to have an extension to the downside."
"1160690","1162390"," I've got this gray box over here. "
"1162430","1168170"," You've got an extension possibility down to 406.59ish somewhere in there."
"1170570","1173970"," An extension of the downside right now, you likely don't get it."
"1173970","1175190"," It's really overextended. "
"1175770","1182030"," But if you're a seller, you're biggest thing here, like the thing that you need to like, well,"
"1182150","1184810"," here's a piece of advice to you if you're a bear."
"1185430","1189630"," You're a, you're a, you're a bear, you know, I don't dislike you."
"1189850","1194890"," I know people come off saying cap doesn't like sellers or cap's always a bull, but if you're a"
"1194890","1197870"," seller, you know that I don't dislike you at all. "
"1197870","1199770"," You know that I tell you exactly what you're looking for."
"1199950","1205210"," If you're a seller, you want, you're at this point regardless of price where we are right now."
"1205330","1208390"," You're looking for that confirmation. "
"1208730","1213570"," It is key for you to get that confirmation on."
"1214290","1215730"," It is key for you to get that."
"1216230","1217490"," You're going to say, no way cap. "
"1217710","1218230"," I don't want that."
"1218590","1221010"," But let's talk real truth trading here."
"1221510","1228030"," You need the squeeze back up and then the rejection, and that what that's doing is confirming to"
"1228030","1234610"," you that it's confirming to you that we're going to have, we're going to have a, that we're going"
"1234610","1241110"," to have a liquidation on a much higher time frame on a one year, believe it or not, time frame"
"1241110","1241610"," of accumulation. "
"1242590","1248850"," So we're going to go from an accumulation to not consolidation, but distribution on a one year time"
"1248850","1249190"," frame."
"1249310","1249430"," Okay."
"1250810","1253070"," And so you're looking, so that's your thing. "
"1253350","1253890"," You're a seller."
"1254410","1258430"," Don't be drinking the fucking Kool-Aid out there and being like, yeah, you know, my friends are"
"1258430","1261630"," telling me crash, you know, black Monday crash today or black Friday crash."
"1262250","1262970"," And that kind of nonsense. "
"1263610","1264990"," Don't be listening to that shit out there."
"1265070","1269210"," Stop drinking the fucking social media, you need that confirmation."
"1270010","1273330"," And so when you see it, if you see it in the next few weeks or the next four weeks,"
"1273330","1281090"," that rejection up there at 43440, something like that, you see the buyers don't have, you see the"
"1281090","1287050"," squeeze and then you see that the buyers don't have the sentiments or the will to want to buy the"
"1287050","1287390"," market. "
"1288010","1297630"," You're likely going to see that market reject there and begin a steady decline over the coming five"
"1297630","1299770"," months at minimum."
"1299970","1301470"," It should take until about April."
"1301770","1304050"," So though it's at four months and then two more. "
"1304250","1306650"," So I said five, well, let's do it six months."
"1306930","1311110"," It should take about six months, three to six months somewhere in there, depending upon when the"
"1311110","1312730"," panic really begins."
"1313670","1315590"," You won't see panic today either. "
"1315790","1319550"," I don't want you to think by this warning that you'll see like true panic today."
"1320290","1324550"," But the true panic will kick in as that 43440 rejects."
"1325130","1327990"," You'll then see the selling go below the monthly trigger. "
"1328530","1334790"," And that's when you're going to start triggering long only funds to begin to hedge massively."
"1335570","1341990"," That and that creates the waterfall puts, that creates the force selling by major institutions."
"1342950","1347650"," And you will see that you'll see that cascading downside waterfall. "
"1348670","1351710"," So we failed to get a new high on the year, right?"
"1351910","1353950"," On 2022, we failed to get the new high this year."
"1355050","1359870"," We are now starting to have or we have the official cross of the daily trigger over the weekly"
"1359870","1362510"," trigger that that triggers the warning immediately."
"1363130","1369090"," And now we're just waiting for that confirmation for a liquidity grab from the upside to begin to"
"1369090","1371490"," make those doubt that staircase moved down. "
"1372110","1380970"," Now, if you're looking, if you want to like pre pregame that, if you're looking to pregame that"
"1380970","1385990"," right now or what are those targets in the springtime, I can give them to you right now."
"1386030","1389530"," I can give you the actual numbers as of right now."
"1389590","1397750"," They've changed over time, but I can give them to you with some kind of fair expectation of where"
"1397750","1401770"," we're going to go from historical examples going only back to 1890 with the tool. "
"1402170","1404770"," So if you have access to the tool, you can already see these things."
"1408550","1417410"," If you feel like you if you feel like you if you feel like you are missing out or something"
"1417410","1422130"," or you missed the you missed this move down, you have not missed it."
"1422270","1424270"," There's so much more down to go. "
"1425310","1427410"," And we're going to talk about something else here too."
"1428230","1431170"," So if the bears get their confirmation, right?"
"1431830","1435270"," If a seller gets their confirmation up here, we begin to head lower."
"1436410","1444270"," If they get that confirmation, you are guaranteed to see you are guaranteed at minimum to see a"
"1444270","1447290"," retest of this prior low from October, I believe 12. "
"1448090","1451550"," That will be $34.96, $65."
"1453210","1458050"," Historically, if not only historically, but if you look at the white golf type stuff, if you guys"
"1458050","1466690"," are or understand white golf in any way, shape or form, this failure of the new high up here and"
"1466690","1473830"," this retest down below has a high probability of breaking below, even lower."
"1474510","1480630"," So had you got had we had bulls gotten the new high and failed, there would be a low probability"
"1480630","1483350"," of breaking this prior low from October. "
"1483550","1484690"," Does that make sense too?"
"1485330","1491670"," So had we gotten a new high from 2022, we had traded up here, you would have had a high"
"1491670","1496050"," probability of retesting this at most and then getting go."
"1496830","1504570"," The failure to get the new high signals that not only will you test this here, but you will likely"
"1504570","1510270"," break below it at some point, even if we squeeze for liquidity and retest and even lower low."
"1510590","1514650"," Now currently that's at 2814 in the quarter. "
"1515150","1519970"," But if you figure if we were to hit this by if we were to hit this by a Q2"
"1519970","1529970"," of 2024, 26, 18, 200 points, that would put a target of springtime of 3000."
"1531290","1538030"," So let's call April a target of right about here."
"1539830","1545650"," Right about there is going to be a target for April, right around 3000. "
"1546250","1552470"," So by April 30th, something like that, if we get a confirmation of we get this confirmation up here"
"1552470","1556810"," that we're going to begin rolling, you should expect 3000."
"1557150","1562350"," Now that doesn't mean, hey, capture, I buy like put puts here for 3000."
"1562610","1565350"," Fuck no, you buy them on the confirmation above. "
"1565950","1570630"," If we start to roll that three, if we start to if we start to reject this up here and"
"1570630","1573610"," confirm that move down lower up here."
"1574530","1578750"," Fuck yeah, you put the 3000, you know, 3500 or something."
"1578750","1586390"," With a with a like 3500 with a target of 3000 in April to the downside. "
"1586990","1593990"," And the bears will have the greater probability of not only you're getting a major test of this,"
"1593990","1597830"," but then you're going to still likely roll down and get 3000."
"1598430","1605370"," So bears, congratulations, if you're a seller, congratulations, you're, you're 90% of the way,"
"1605870","1611630"," you're 90% of the way towards, towards that major role."
"1611810","1621590"," And not only that, if polls were looking for, if polls were looking for, if"
"1621590","1631050"," polls like myself, because I was and am looking for the low to be just a recheck of"
"1631050","1633590"," 3500 at worst, right?"
"1633790","1636310"," Like we don't go back and visit a new low in the market. "
"1637150","1639710"," We're going back to visit 3500, no big deal."
"1640010","1640830"," I can accept that."
"1641130","1644590"," But right now, we're not setting that up. "
"1644710","1650110"," Right now we're setting up a new low below 3500."
"1650310","1652750"," So there's probably two things that you need to know."
"1653170","1656630"," Number one, we are in a risk off warning. "
"1657350","1660750"," You need a confirmation though above it for 3440."
"1661150","1663330"," So those are the two number one and number two, right?"
"1663550","1670150"," Number three, due to not regaining a new high of some point this year, you are going to be looking"
"1670150","1674810"," for a new low at this point, not 3500, but likely 3000."
"1675830","1684370"," Whereas you probably weren't looking for a new low if you had, if the market had had a attained a"
"1684370","1686170"," new high on the year. "
"1705830","1708870"," Thank"
"1708870","1717370"," you. "
