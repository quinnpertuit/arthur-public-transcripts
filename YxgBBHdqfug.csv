"157710","159330"," projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level before the film begins. "
"159330","164840"," Good morning out there."
"165240","172500"," How's everybody doing?"
"172500","173540"," We've got our one above."
"173760","183500"," We just broke through the after hours high right here, tagged"
"183500","190300"," through that and now trading up to retest the high at 4.39. Oh, wait from yesterday. "
"191080","192460"," I'll just see that right here."
"193540","197720"," Yesterday's high at 4.39. I believe that's 08 or 06 somewhere up in here."
"199820","205480"," Tag yesterday's low before the close here and see that right there in premarket. "
"207960","212520"," I do need to let you know this morning that I'll give it a few minutes to see if I"
"212520","213420"," can make a pile in here."
"216040","217360"," Just a minute here."
"218800","220840"," There we go. "
"220900","221420"," Good morning everybody."
"221620","222160"," How's everybody doing?"
"224780","225420"," Excuse me."
"226760","229100"," Let's give a minute here for people to pile in. "
"240420","241400"," I'm about to close."
"241980","244380"," So I've got a bunch of options out there."
"244460","246220"," I've got some puts for the 20th. "
"246320","247740"," I've got 0-8 puts for today."
"248460","250940"," I've got 440 C's for Friday."
"250960","252720"," I'm about to sell those right now. "
"253280","255120"," Those are now 74 cents."
"255360","256880"," So many guys followed that trade yesterday."
"257579","259000"," I'm about to exit that trade. "
"259079","264200"," That's 440 C for Friday, the 16th."
"272820","275520"," I've got a puts for the 20th in here."
"275520","275720"," It's here. "
"278480","280920"," Puts for the 20th getting hammered right now."
"281760","284480"," I've got June 20th for 20 P's."
"284660","285960"," I think I'm going to leave those on. "
"286160","288520"," I think yesterday they were just dying."
"289300","291660"," I did buy those with profit last week."
"292380","296620"," And then the close yesterday added 4.31 P's for this morning. "
"297520","298840"," Those are fucking dead."
"298920","300020"," I think those are dead right now."
"300440","301640"," Let me just check those right now. "
"303120","305160"," They're at 3 cents, 4 cents."
"305340","307060"," I think I bought them at 15 cents yesterday."
"307980","311460"," But I am proposing for some profit on the 16th right now. "
"311620","314640"," So just heads up on that 440 C."
"315880","319480"," And then I did not buy 0-8s on this morning's bell."
"319860","321580"," I was a little late getting here this morning."
"321780","325020"," I was on the phone with, I have to do some meetings today. "
"325880","327760"," Tomorrow I will not be here."
"327880","328060"," I'm at."
"329140","337060"," At an office for the website kind of stuff that I'm doing. "
"338200","343500"," With some people that have to take a look at everything that we're launching to prove everything"
"343500","344380"," that kind of stuff."
"344980","347520"," But I'm getting caught up in some meetings today."
"347700","349140"," So the live stream will be on today. "
"349360","352200"," I'll be in the office today with you."
"352640","356900"," So if there's any like big moves in the market, anything like that, I will pop into the stream."
"357620","362500"," You likely see my camera here with me here, but I do have to take some phone calls this morning. "
"363580","366900"," Leading up into that meeting tomorrow that I have."
"366900","367600"," So I have no choice."
"368000","369260"," Now we're going to look at the market here. "
"370640","371780"," We're going to look at the market here."
"372080","373060"," What to expect here."
"374180","378720"," In the coming couple of weeks that we have coming up here because we have OPEC's. "
"378820","379500"," We've got Vixpiration."
"379920","382940"," We've got end of month flows, all that kind of stuff."
"383900","385880"," We have the digestion to go over. "
"385880","387560"," So this morning, I'll be here with you."
"387660","391160"," It's 9.55. They're probably taking about a half an hour to review this stuff with you."
"392360","397020"," What to expect in the next couple of weeks into the beginning of July, that kind of stuff. "
"400920","402980"," Get a nice new hot cup of coffee in front of me."
"403940","405540"," We're going to review that stuff today."
"407700","409220"," And how to trade it. "
"409380","410820"," We were talking about this yesterday."
"412660","416760"," Inside of this closed yesterday, we were talking about the close down here."
"418660","423180"," If we're above green, if we're below green, what to be doing, right?"
"423340","427780"," If we get above below green, if we get a rejection, you see that the sellers are not getting the"
"427780","428980"," rejection that they want here. "
"429940","430920"," Well, they're getting it in the overnight."
"431100","432600"," We had a good overnight trade last night."
"433060","434060"," Some of you guys are following along. "
"434460","436280"," I did stay awake for that trade last night."
"437300","438720"," Some good follow through into the morning."
"439020","441180"," And now we're going above the hourly trigger here. "
"442520","447000"," And I made a post on, let's see if I can bring this post up for you."
"447940","450840"," I made a post on, let's see if we can change this."
"451780","452220"," Come on now. "
"452720","453920"," What is going on with Twitter?"
"457850","458810"," We just second here."
"464580","465900"," Just a second here."
"466840","467220"," Okay. "
"469100","471360"," So let me put this off to the side."
"471720","473960"," So the good thing for bulls here."
"475380","476160"," Well, you didn't know. "
"476220","478340"," Well, I can't look at this with you today."
"479160","486340"," But we're going to look at some of the reaction this morning that I read on Fintuit."
"487340","488840"," And it kind of blew my mind. "
"488940","493020"," I was like, kind of blew my mind some of the some of the shit that I read out there."
"493080","493960"," Some of it was really good."
"495660","497840"," But then a lot of it was insane insanity. "
"498800","500620"," And I figured we'd get that insanity."
"500620","504120"," I figured we'd get that insanity this morning."
"504260","505260"," And of course it was out there. "
"505640","512700"," And a lot of it has to do with the reaction from the fat to what the fat had to"
"512700","512960"," say."
"513659","516900"," I have to give credit to Jerome Powell."
"517480","519020"," I figured he would give you the 25. "
"520700","527800"," The pause, but the key point for yesterday would be the language would matter on the pause."
"528460","529760"," Pause language would matter."
"531600","536000"," I'm impressed that you got the pause another 25 VPS hats off to you. "
"536400","538180"," That does signal something to you."
"538220","544280"," It signals that he's not trying to break the economy nor the stock market as of right now."
"545160","550300"," No matter what anyone's telling you out there, the him giving you or him inputting out there, the"
"550300","554060"," pause is going to support the market with a caveat. "
"554060","560320"," The caveat is that he was able to relate to you yesterday."
"561440","565020"," That there are more rate hikes coming."
"565960","570800"," And him threading that needle yesterday was fascinating to me. "
"571520","573040"," I know a lot of you guys hate Jerome."
"574960","576300"," But I got to give it to him."
"576620","580640"," I know he's like he's bankrupted a bank and all that kind of stuff, but I got to tell you,"
"580700","586660"," I'm giving it to him because not only was he able to pass out a pause, but he was also"
"586660","590380"," able to make a threat that to this point is sticking. "
"592040","594640"," Now do I think they're going to raise rates more?"
"595240","595780"," Maybe."
"596620","600480"," But I don't think it matters to him whether he does or doesn't."
"601240","608300"," He needs for the soft landing for people to believe that he's going to raise rates in the future. "
"608760","613780"," And I just found it absolutely fascinating that he's like, he's like balls out like we're pausing."
"615100","619420"," Now, if he had raised rates 25 BPS, I expected a pullback from that, of course."
"620300","624540"," You would have heard people saying, what's his drive and motivation?"
"624960","627020"," Is he trying to hurt the stock market?"
"627020","628580"," Is he trying to hurt the economy?"
"629620","630600"," What's his real motives?"
"631120","638980"," But he was actually able to pass off a pause and the threat of rate increases historically. "
"640100","649340"," The moment that we pause or pause cut with that standard language too, no threats of increases."
"651220","655800"," Normally, it's not just we broke something, we reset as well."
"657720","661060"," Even if we haven't broken something, we will reset the market. "
"661460","667220"," So if you're a bull out there, you should be grateful that you got."
"667980","673280"," He was as generous as he was pausing and able to convey the message."
"675140","677940"," That they're not done, right?"
"678280","684580"," We're not done and we're going to go to more rate hikes, you know, and he like maxed the threats"
"684580","684900"," yesterday. "
"685020","686920"," So I'm impressed."
"687360","688140"," I have to say it."
"688300","689280"," I'm fucking impressed. "
"690340","691580"," He's very savvy."
"692480","694820"," Whoever he had, write that script for him."
"695000","697820"," However, that was worked out in a meeting somewhere. "
"699840","701920"," I would assume that they ran."
"702680","704040"," I'm not kidding you."
"704120","710380"," They probably ran that through some focus groups as to how to convey what they're trying to do. "
"711200","712180"," But I got to give it to him."
"712280","716960"," I know some of you are going to disagree with that, but that's the fact to me at least."
"717680","721800"," And when we have more time, like maybe Monday or Tuesday or not Monday. "
"722200","726920"," We're off for Monday for Juneteenth, but Tuesday I'll go over the macro picture with you again."
"727400","732180"," We go over that in the show all the time and I'll explain that to you."
"732200","739880"," You know, I'm simply put if this is inflation and if that's inflation down here and up here, you"
"739880","742280"," know, you're only like a quarter of the way down. "
"742280","748780"," So he's buying you time to ride that inflation rate down as a bull."
"749140","749420"," It's going."
"749620","751580"," You'll then see the unemployment rate come up. "
"752660","754620"," You'll then see a rate."
"755000","760780"," The threat of rates will then be removed and you'll get an actual pause and that kind of stuff."
"760960","762160"," And we'll get that last leg down. "
"762840","769400"," And I made a post about this a few days ago about this saying, you know, your floor needs to"
"769400","770740"," raise a little bit."
"770740","773160"," We can look at that right now if you want."
"774600","777440"," I think Tuesday is a better day for it or maybe. "
"778600","781460"," I think we have a stock show coming up here on."
"782260","784160"," Yeah, we get a stock show coming up on Sunday."
"784960","786820"," How about on that stock show on Sunday?"
"786820","788640"," We'll go over all of this together. "
"788640","790480"," We'll go over all the macro stuff with you."
"791740","794560"," All the stuff that you can simplify."
"795900","800220"," So he's raising the floor by him, not just straight pausing. "
"801340","803720"," He's still working on that soft landing."
"804340","810040"," And even if we revisit lows, it's not going to be as bad as you thought it was going to"
"810040","810200"," be."
"810540","811980"," I saw some craziness this morning. "
"812460","815340"," I saw like a bunch of two thousand eight, two thousand shit."
"816180","818280"," I was like, I was like, they're fucking crazy."
"820060","821080"," So I don't know. "
"821460","822700"," We'll look at it on Sunday."
"823100","826000"," How about that 11 a.m. We have a stock picking show starting this week."
"826820","829260"," And I will be with you on that day that morning. "
"830840","833980"," My, my fact, my family is going on vacation and leaving me here."
"834080","839140"," I got a bunch of stuff to do for a big outdoor trip that we're doing."
"840940","844620"," So on Sunday, I'll, oh, I will review the macro picture with you. "
"844620","845780"," It's very simple to understand."
"845900","847920"," It's not as complicated as you really think it is."
"849940","851460"," People overcomplicate it all the time. "
"852440","853260"," I don't know why."
"853640","854880"," I don't know why they do."
"855760","859700"," Some people have to sound smart for their jobs, I guess, or people's motivation. "
"859700","863200"," People have different motivations for what they do."
"863840","868120"," But for you as a stock trader and investor, you can, you can easily simplify these things."
"868360","870200"," Very easy concepts to understand. "
"870420","871820"," Ray Dalio does a good job at this."
"872240","878560"," It sucks at timing, but it is an outstanding job of having a fireside chat and explaining, easily"
"878560","882740"," explaining complex concepts to you."
"883840","885640"," Because, you know, you're not an economist, are you?"
"886120","886920"," You're not an economist. "
"886920","890100"," You're not a financial advisor."
"890340","891600"," You're your own financial advisor."
"892360","895160"," So you just have to understand these basic concepts, how they work. "
"896340","897820"," Now, hold on a second here."
"900300","901420"," Drink too much coffee."
"907760","909140"," That's my take on Jay Powell. "
"911920","913160"," Jay Powell did a good job."
"914000","920920"," And veryably, he did what, even though you didn't get 25 BPS, the angry threat of the two more"
"920920","923580"," hikes, it's the same thing."
"924160","924980"," It's good enough for me. "
"925080","925700"," I'm happy with it."
"928300","934580"," So we're going to look at my post that I made on at trade the trigger, trade the trigger last"
"934580","934900"," night."
"936280","938320"," And we're going to talk about that post right now. "
"939900","942660"," So I have a handle here called at trade the trigger."
"942660","946860"," It's an update post that I made last night for you."
"948020","949200"," And it was for spy. "
"949400","957240"," And I said, until this cyclical trade is over, key point here, cyclical trade is over."
"957620","966880"," And we revert back to the economy's structural trade, limit expectations to the downside."
"969340","975680"," Note, as more time passes, sideways risk lies with sellers and not buyers. "
"976280","983040"," The point here being as the, as our, as our velocity comes higher."
"984540","986380"," And here's price right here, right?"
"987120","992400"," Longer we do this, the more risk there is actually to the upside and not to the downside."
"992400","1001260"," And even if you get the downside trade as time passes, that price is always coming up from the"
"1001260","1001560"," bottom. "
"1002160","1004840"," It's like a great shark coming up to meet you."
"1005800","1009360"," So sellers only have so much time is my point here."
"1009560","1013120"," So if you're a seller and you're like, Hey, I want for 12. "
"1013180","1014520"," I want for 22."
"1015240","1020240"," Excuse me, 420 or 422 for 12 has time passes."
"1020240","1023180"," Those numbers are going to slowly creep on you. "
"1023819","1026020"," And it'll eventually become a dip by."
"1026500","1029180"," This is what a bull market is."
"1029880","1033339"," When you're in a bull market, a bull run in a bull market, right?"
"1033680","1036819"," You will see bulls that will fucking just throw money at shit. "
"1037540","1038900"," And eventually it'll print."
"1039640","1044440"," If you put enough time on it, one month, three months, doesn't matter if they buy the top or bottom"
"1044440","1045160"," of that channel."
"1045619","1048780"," It'll eventually turn green might not be 300%. "
"1049580","1051520"," But they're not that either you're going to die."
"1051660","1055520"," All the old school memes are coming back into fashion."
"1056520","1058540"," Diamond hand shit like that, right?"
"1058740","1060580"," I hold my options to expiry. "
"1060860","1062640"," All that shit's come back into play again."
"1063640","1070800"," So eventually, if we have no pullback, it will still push hires that point."
"1071980","1079880"," So next up comes the consolidation range trade for four, which is with a pin on the collar at 4320. "
"1081000","1083820"," Spy range, 432, 438, 95."
"1084740","1091480"," If price and the hourly trigger break up, or excuse me, if price in the hourly trigger break above,"
"1091920","1093280"," I meant this is bad wording."
"1093500","1097600"," This should have said as long as price is above the hourly trigger at any point in the hourly"
"1097600","1100840"," triggers above the daily and the weekly, we will go up. "
"1102120","1108640"," And if we successfully retest above 440, that would mean we break 440, we retest it, and then start"
"1108640","1116000"," to go higher, we will begin the continuation to close 451 and 461, regardless of velocity."
"1116780","1121300"," As long as price is above that hourly trigger, we can continue higher."
"1121700","1123460"," Believe that or not, that will happen. "
"1123880","1125600"," That'll happen many times this year."
"1126880","1128400"," I'm going to warn you a few things here."
"1128920","1134880"," You will get meaningful pullbacks to the daily trigger, maybe one or two, to the weekly trigger,"
"1135560","1139520"," but we will relentlessly ride that hourly trigger all the way up through all of it. "
"1140300","1145720"," And I'm going to show you examples of that this morning in a bull market, in a bull run, so"
"1145720","1148280"," that you can understand the concepts I'm trying to give to you here."
"1150860","1154520"," Now, I also wrote here, a beginning situation of 451 and 461."
"1154880","1157700"," A break below 432, the target is 426. "
"1158560","1162540"," An extreme will of 412 is possible, but not probable."

"1465090","1466390"," I'm sorry, but it is."
"1468890","1473170"," Maybe some people aren't watching my stream or something and they're just fucking around and"

"1490390","1492730"," It's very important here for you to understand this, okay?"
"1494370","1495250"," Number one."
"1496550","1498410"," Here's a super trend right here. "
"1499450","1499950"," Big one."
"1501150","1502450"," We're at the bottom of it."
"1502570","1502930"," You see that?"
"1503970","1505190"," Super trend, bottom of it. "
"1506010","1507490"," That's 460 right there."
"1508610","1510810"," We're just getting started as the point."
"1510810","1515730"," But the second big thing that I want you to understand here, this is critical for you to"
"1515730","1516190"," understand. "
"1519230","1519830"," Price."
"1521550","1524410"," I don't care if it's above the green."
"1525090","1526050"," We are going higher. "
"1526490","1527550"," I don't fucking care."
"1528070","1528670"," That's what's happening."
"1530310","1532530"," Because we're in a bull market. "
"1535430","1542170"," When price is above green, we are going up every time for the next fucking months and years."
"1542410","1542750"," I don't care."
"1543010","1543410"," Let it out years. "
"1543590","1545090"," Maybe like six months, three months."
"1546230","1547950"," That's what's happening every single time."
"1548850","1550430"," Every single time. "
"1553250","1556690"," On a higher timeframe, like a 30 minute chart."
"1558250","1559230"," Daily chart."
"1560310","1562290"," Price as long as it stays. "
"1562570","1571690"," If we have price, hourly, the green, the yellow, the orange and blue stay like this."
"1572710","1573750"," We are in a bull market."
"1574910","1580010"," No matter what you tell me, no matter what you can, blah, blah, blah, all day long. "
"1580270","1581110"," I don't fucking care."
"1584550","1585690"," We're in a bull market."
"1585690","1593350"," If price at this moment, if we had a crash, let's say we had a fucking correction five minutes from"
"1593350","1593550"," now. "
"1594170","1595450"," And price came down here."
"1597370","1603870"," Even down here, as long as the green, the yellow and the orange do not follow."
"1604670","1606050"," Do not follow. "
"1606910","1608470"," We're still in a bull market."
"1610450","1611670"," We're still in a bull run."
"1611670","1613250"," We're still in a bull market. "
"1613510","1613870"," Period."
"1614230","1614570"," End of story."
"1615410","1616930"," No fucking discussion. "
"1618950","1619390"," Zero."
"1621230","1621670"," Discussion."
"1622330","1623350"," I don't want to fucking hear it. "
"1624190","1625950"," I can look back to the beginning of the original."
"1626310","1628750"," I can go back to 1890 with you right now on this."
"1629790","1631030"," And show it to you. "
"1632970","1635330"," Now, here's the point that I'm trying to make to you."
"1635450","1637150"," We are in a bull run bull market."
"1637150","1638990"," Don't fucking forget it. "
"1639110","1640090"," Especially if you're a seller."
"1644810","1646130"," Not a bull market."
"1646410","1646710"," See that?"
"1647050","1648570"," Not a bull market here. "
"1649990","1651710"," Structural changes, right?"
"1652570","1653710"," Look at this yellow line."
"1653850","1655730"," See that break below the orange line?"
"1655930","1656850"," Do you see this here?"
"1657530","1657850"," Break below."
"1658650","1659290"," Right there, right?"
"1660310","1661470"," See how it breaks below. "
"1661630","1662010"," Remember this?"
"1662350","1662690"," Key points."
"1663250","1665530"," Yellow line breaks below orange line."
"1666230","1667110"," Price below it. "
"1667850","1668410"," Comes up."
"1668550","1669250"," Comes back down."
"1669490","1669570"," Boom. "
"1670270","1670630"," Boom, right?"
"1671430","1673590"," Yellow line below the orange line."
"1674190","1676990"," Notice in a bull market bull run."
"1677710","1680230"," Yellow line does not turn down. "
"1680650","1682050"," Even if price goes down."
"1682670","1684810"," Notice how the yellow line is not turning down."
"1684950","1687390"," You got price, yellow, orange, blue. "
"1688450","1689650"," Remember those key points there?"
"1690410","1691590"," Yellow, orange, blue."
"1692650","1693850"," Yellow, orange, blue."
"1694170","1695290"," What are we starting right here?"
"1695290","1696750"," Yellow, orange, blue. "
"1697590","1698250"," Starting."
"1700510","1702930"," Starting, starting, not ending."
"1703910","1707030"," Not fucking around over here with volatility. "
"1708470","1709050"," Starting."
"1710470","1712690"," I don't know how many times I have to say this to people."
"1713470","1716210"," Starting, starting, starting, starting, starting. "
"1716530","1717530"," Sorry to have to repeat it."
"1719490","1725840"," When we begin those phases, they last."
"1727440","1730080"," For a major amount of time. "
"1730680","1732960"," When we got out of 2020, right?"
"1733320","1734740"," We left behind everybody."
"1735240","1735660"," We ran."
"1736220","1736740"," Yee-haw. "
"1737300","1738940"," We tagged the yellow in the orange."
"1739280","1740800"," Kept going up and up and up and up."
"1741780","1746140"," So in that post that I made to you, when I said to you, if price is above green, you've"
"1746140","1746720"," chased it. "
"1747100","1749980"," If we get down to the yellow orange, you buy it."
"1750100","1752760"," If you're a trader and you're like, well, I'm getting cut up."
"1753480","1758120"," You'll have multiple opportunities in this run to grab the yellow line. "
"1758580","1759560"," You can see it here."
"1760080","1762880"," You actually have a few opportunities to grab the orange line, right?"
"1763160","1768600"," Look, in 2021, you had one, two, three, four, five opportunities to buy the orange."
"1769180","1776380"," To buy the yellow line, you had one, two, three, four, five, or let's say a five, six, seven,"
"1776560","1776700"," eight. "
"1777320","1780980"," Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, right there, and one run."
"1782620","1785120"," And do you see when price is above the green?"
"1785640","1788500"," If the green is running higher, you're going to chase it."
"1789060","1792060"," You see that just chasing the green the entire way up. "
"1792860","1797700"," Back to the original point of price, yellow, orange, blue."
"1798480","1799500"," You see that run right there?"
"1800380","1800640"," Vamo."
"1801260","1802600"," See that one right there?"
"1803100","1803460"," Vamo. "
"1803460","1807260"," Until we get a structural change, we run."
"1807500","1807920"," We run."
"1808280","1808760"," We run. "
"1809520","1810940"," We run, run, run, run."
"1811460","1812160"," We don't have."
"1812300","1815380"," We're not seeing 4.32. We're not seeing it. "
"1816040","1818420"," I can show you this back all the way back."
"1818500","1819780"," On Sunday, I'll show you this stuff."
"1820520","1821600"," I'll show you all the way back. "
"1823800","1827180"," It's 1895 on the Dow Jones Industrial Average."
"1827400","1828300"," I'll show it to you on Sunday."
"1828860","1830700"," And I got something else to show you on Sunday. "
"1830700","1833980"," I have higher timeframes that show."
"1835280","1840600"," Show when they begin to actually sell this market before every single crash."
"1841160","1842180"," I can show it to you. "
"1842440","1849420"," And every single crash going back to the beginning of time, when price goes higher, and yet they're"
"1849420","1851740"," leaving the market, the big banks are leaving the market."
"1852000","1855000"," That has not shown itself right now in where we are."
"1856360","1858100"," We have not had many. "
"1858460","1865780"," We've had maybe one or two since 1895, where we've begun a bull run like this, and we've ever just"
"1865780","1867720"," crashed and gone down to the depths of hell."
"1870060","1871720"," So this is my warning to you."
"1871860","1877380"," I don't want to get frustrated, but I am this morning, because I was reading some stuff on fin to"
"1877380","1877480"," it. "
"1877620","1880820"," And I was like, these people are going to fucking lose every last dollar they have."
"1881500","1885660"," And I posted it late last night on trade, the trigger."
"1886540","1888060"," So just bear warning. "
"1888440","1889900"," This is the one warning you're going to get."
"1890340","1893600"," Last time it was Sunday, I'll give you the details on it."
"1894080","1895920"," I'll give you the macro reasons for this. "
"1896700","1900640"," I saw someone else this morning post pulls in, but bears are fucked here."
"1900960","1901540"," They're not fucked."
"1902080","1902920"," They're going to get a run. "
"1903740","1905020"," It's going to run its course."
"1905700","1906720"," I'll show you one."
"1906880","1908320"," I'll also show you one Sunday. "
"1908620","1912360"," Wake off patterns and tell you exactly where you are in that pattern."
"1912640","1915040"," I'll show you the worst bear shit you can see."
"1915460","1920520"," And you're still going to close all at minimum. "
"1921480","1925760"," You're still going to go up here and close every single gap."
"1926280","1927320"," You're going to close them all."
"1928320","1930580"," You're likely going to get all time highs. "
"1930580","1937160"," So you can fight that all you want all the way up and you can give every last penny back."
"1938060","1939000"," If you want."
"1941940","1945680"," And I bet you'll be getting bullish when we're rolling over up here. "
"1952920","1954420"," I'm not really mad."
"1957140","1959020"," I just, my mind is blown."
"1960980","1966080"," My mind is blown that people are proposing some shit that's out early fucking preposterous. "
"1972760","1979640"," So for right now, if you're not long this market and you don't want to chase that green line above"
"1979640","1980720"," the green line, right?"
"1981400","1982200"," It'll come back down."
"1982740","1983980"," You'll get some dips down here."
"1984880","1985900"," Come back down here. "
"1986000","1986780"," You'll grab this one."
"1986920","1987520"," You'll come down here."
"1987640","1988400"," You'll grab this one. "
"1988860","1990800"," You'll have people telling you it's a blow off top."
"1991100","1991980"," All kinds of fucking nonsense."
"1993140","1995040"," When it rolls, we'll know it rolls. "
"1995440","1996100"," We'll see it roll."
"1996840","1998140"," We'll actually see price."
"1998800","2001320"," You're like, why do you need to get positioned for the great crash cap?"
"2002240","2004860"," Yeah, we can do that, you know, but it's not here now. "
"2005360","2006300"," Like, well, that's purple."
"2006540","2006960"," We don't want purple."
"2010020","2010500"," There's orange. "
"2012440","2014360"," You know, you want to see that cross."
"2023350","2025350"," Yeah, you want to see that kind of cross there."
"2025450","2029350"," That's a shitty cross, but I'll draw it better for you on. "
"2029750","2031210"," You want to see that cross over."
"2032050","2034550"," You want to see that, you know, you want to see that rejection."
"2035010","2036030"," There's like two or three. "
"2037250","2042930"," There's this usually three or that's the three easy trading ways to do it."
"2043330","2046130"," There's some velocity stuff that shows that there's better ways to see it."
"2046130","2047070"," And I'll show that to you on Sunday. "
"2047590","2050510"," But, you know, it's like this kind of stuff right here you're looking for."
"2050949","2052489"," We fucking done any of that yet?"
"2052650","2052889"," No."
"2053850","2058909"," So before you even get there, even if you wanted to jump in on it, you could have jumped in"
"2058909","2059230"," on it. "
"2059370","2059429"," What?"
"2059730","2063730"," Another fucking three points down is that 20 fucking points."
"2064330","2067050"," You could have gotten into that trade right there in confirmation."
"2067670","2073130"," So, you know, nothing's showing this. "
"2073130","2075730"," And I'm not going to show it to you right now because it's kind of a kind of a cool"
"2075730","2076350"," thing to look at."
"2076370","2078110"," I've shown it on this program in the past."
"2078850","2081630"," How you can see the crash before it actually happens. "
"2083530","2084489"," Every one of them."
"2085389","2086590"," Every single one."
"2088150","2091270"," So until that happens, you're long and strong. "
"2091690","2097110"," You are long and strong, this market on a one minute chart here."
"2104980","2106580"," You can see it right here."
"2107700","2109540"," One, two, boom. "
"2109760","2113240"," There's number three and rip some faces off to the upside right there."
"2114540","2115420"," Trending higher."
"2119900","2120620"," And there you go. "
"2120840","2122160"," Big beast mode right there."
"2124920","2127700"," Now do I think you're going to get anything crazy out of this week?"
"2127940","2128100"," No."
"2129440","2131140"," I think you're going to get a bunch of big banks. "
"2134080","2136660"," I think you're going to put a bunch of big banks, right?"
"2136660","2137480"," It's their market."
"2137580","2138720"," It's their stock market."
"2138960","2141180"," And they are going to print their shit. "
"2142240","2143600"," They're going to print their shit."
"2143720","2145200"," They're going to park this bus on you."
"2145600","2146960"," They don't care what you want. "
"2147140","2148880"," They don't care about what Jay Powell said."
"2149020","2149360"," Well, they do."
"2150940","2152520"," They do care what Jay Powell says. "
"2152660","2155980"," But right now they have a trade on."
"2159380","2162120"," And unless something materialistically has changed."
"2162930","2166040"," And that trade is still on. "
"2166300","2169280"," And nothing has materialistically changed in that trade."
"2170400","2173140"," Nothing has materialistically changed."
"2174100","2175920"," This was yesterday's expected move, right?"
"2176940","2177880"," That was for yesterday. "
"2179240","2180640"," Just hit it this morning."
"2180880","2181180"," Outstanding."
"2181500","2182120"," Slap that ass. "
"2183200","2187500"," We get R3 above at 445.08. I don't think we tagged that personally."
"2188400","2191070"," That 445.08. But I do think we tagged this."
"2191210","2192910"," These two previous highs right here. "
"2192970","2193730"," These two yellow bars."
"2194190","2194750"," 440."
"2195450","2195530"," 3."
"2195730","2195970"," 441. "
"2197610","2199130"," This is back from 2022."
"2200770","2201630"," Right here."
"2204020","2204940"," Previous highs. "
"2205760","2206320"," 2022."
"2207020","2209440"," So show up on a show up on Sunday."
"2209720","2210140"," I've done this. "
"2210400","2214160"," I've actually done this video or that segment in the past."
"2214680","2216140"," A few times."
"2217420","2218360"," Previous highs. "
"2218360","2218960"," 2022."
"2219640","2223660"," Matter of fact, matter of fact, I did these videos or this."
"2223880","2227000"," I've done this recap at our lows. "
"2227680","2231260"," We were at 350 and 360 and I was telling you to buy the fucking bottom."
"2231880","2234520"," I made those videos and said buy here."
"2235980","2238980"," In three to five years, you're going to look back on this low. "
"2240320","2243320"," Even if we revisit it would have been a viable bottom."
"2244080","2245680"," You didn't want to miss this."
"2245680","2249260"," And even right now, what J-POW is trying to do is the same thing. "
"2249840","2254900"," J-POW is trying to get the market high enough so that when we go back over, you're likely not"
"2254900","2258860"," going to see anything worse than 32 or 3500."
"2259440","2261620"," Whenever that time is, it's likely not now."
"2262080","2267280"," Him threatening you with more rate hikes down the road into the end of the year. "
"2268280","2272140"," They're going to get this market up here when they finally roll it over to reset the market."
"2272140","2275060"," It's likely going to come back down there for 3500, 3200."
"2275540","2278940"," And the longer that he does this to you, it's going to go even higher. "
"2279720","2282160"," So there's actually more risk to a seller."
"2282500","2289920"," We're not a seller, but there's actually more risk to a hesitant investor than there is to someone"
"2289920","2292860"," that bought 3600, 3500."
"2293360","2299000"," There's more risk to them because there are sellers out there scaring these investors saying, don't"
"2299000","2302160"," worry, you'll have another chance to buy that bottom. "
"2303320","2304180"," You'll have another chance."
"2304500","2305000"," Don't worry about it."
"2305040","2305540"," It's going to be lower. "
"2306340","2306980"," It'll be 2,800."
"2307380","2308060"," It'll be 2,600."
"2308960","2313620"," I'm telling you what, fucking three to five years from now, if J-POW is still raising rates and"
"2313620","2319860"," still threatening you in two years or three years, we will come back lower once they pause and cut"
"2319860","2320160"," rates. "
"2320760","2325280"," We will reset, but you will look and find out that all along you should have bought that fucking"
"2325280","2326100"," 3500."
"2326100","2332440"," I assure you, our stock market can put on two or 300 points in a blink."
"2333280","2340480"," And when we reset that reset from that trough, do you guys know what a trough is, that last touch"
"2340480","2341080"," that happens?"
"2341760","2345100"," You and I both know that that shit lasts for like a month and a half. "
"2345600","2350000"," That isn't something that normally we don't get down there and bounce it and then trade sideways"
"2350000","2351760"," and down for five more years."
"2355960","2357960"," It's just not how it happens."
"2358320","2364140"," If you're pointing towards 2008, you should be looking towards Mike Barrie, because he made a very"
"2364140","2364920"," valid point. "
"2365260","2366240"," You bought the dip."
"2367300","2371560"," There is no structural fraud right now like we had in 2008 either."
"2371840","2375920"," Some of you will disagree with that and claim, yeah, the moment they stop showing up to the bond"
"2375920","2381100"," auctions, or the, I don't know, you'll say it's in cars or it's in this or it's in that. "
"2381100","2387280"," But one of Mike Barrie's key points is that he believed that our market was fraudulent."
"2388800","2393700"," Had that not been found that second or that last leg never would have happened, right?"
"2394620","2401340"," If there wasn't that fraudulent re-wrapping of shitty, shitty mortgages, right?"
"2402020","2403380"," We never would have had that last leg."
"2403580","2404420"," Mike Barrie would have been wrong. "
"2404680","2405580"," We would have kept going up."
"2405760","2408680"," That would have been the end for 2008."
"2422400","2424740"," Previous hi, baby, 2022. "
"2429750","2432770"," Wish I had held those Friday calls to right there."
"2434030","2436130"," I'm off here ranting instead of trading."
"2439510","2441570"," I have a feeling right now. "
"2441810","2447350"," I have a feeling right now that I was talking to some friends and I was like, so right now"
"2447350","2448810"," my account is littered with."
"2449470","2454190"," Normally I'm like, normally I'm like zero dates for just that day."
"2454750","2461190"," Then I put a trade on the market and then I take the trade off the market over time and"
"2461190","2462870"," then I'm just zero dating for the end of it. "
"2463370","2470570"," Now that we're in a bull run, I have making enough money that I can just throw money at, put"
"2470570","2475290"," protection at all as far, no matter where we go, I can just buy some puts."
"2475870","2477890"," Now they're just littering my account."
"2478190","2479850"," It's kind of hilarious to see. "
"2481970","2483230"," Reminiscence of a bull run."
"2494510","2498470"," Sunday at 11 a.m. we're going to review stock picks."
"2499670","2501330"," We're going to look for some more picks. "
"2502390","2503770"," We're going to review your stock picks."
"2504670","2505850"," They're going to have a favorite ticker."
"2506690","2507230"," Where are the buys?"
"2507750","2508370"," Where are the dangers?"
"2508370","2511270"," So you're specific tickers that you like. "
"2511430","2512190"," We're going to review those."
"2512930","2518270"," And then we're going to do a macro show where I actually show you how we can see."
"2518590","2522790"," I can see when the market's going to crash before we roll. "
"2524690","2530390"," And I'll show you every example of that in previous history where that happened to show you proof"
"2530390","2531030"," of concept."
"2531030","2537610"," My meeting tomorrow is to do that same proof of concept with some very intelligent people."
"2547470","2556340"," This Sunday at 11 a.m. Just give us 441. "
"2556820","2559760"," Yeah, it's like 441 37 or something like that."
"2560520","2564540"," I think that's the is that the is that the high target from that last run?"
"2564860","2566200"," I might have the numbers wrong."
"2566660","2568520"," Sometimes I'm like, yeah, I'll just throw that up there. "
"2568520","2569140"," It's close enough."
"2571900","2588250"," Yeah, well,"
"2588390","2591150"," we're going to look at the macro reasons for this trade."
"2591770","2593970"," I did post an article to it. "
"2594230","2597810"," I think it was drunken Miller was talking about China."
"2599770","2604530"," And inside of that article, he said two fair points."
"2604970","2608530"," It was like, you know, the next three to six months. "
"2610910","2615710"," I think he said the next three to six months, you're going to see a cyclical trade in China."
"2616870","2621790"," He said, then we'll then China will will revisit a structural trade."
"2623190","2629350"," And I was like, I was like, drunks out there throwing out some some some stuff, some some candy to"
"2629350","2629710"," people. "
"2630550","2634610"," It was on business insider and he was throwing some candy out."
"2634610","2638850"," And you've heard me on this program talk to you about a cyclical trade."
"2639910","2647790"," I told you that people do not like to discuss the COVID trade. "
"2648410","2658110"," You'll hear people discuss the market crash trade and they never include the COVID trade into it."
"2658670","2665650"," They're like, if you don't look at COVID, you just look at these other examples, it all fits."
"2669150","2670330"," That's what they tell you, right?"
"2670630","2671990"," You'll actually say it. "
"2672210","2673310"," You don't look at COVID."
"2674950","2675910"," It all fits."
"2678750","2679990"," Drunken Miller, I was impressed. "
"2680750","2681570"," This is past week."
"2681690","2682330"," You think he said it?"
"2682550","2685450"," He said, there's a cyclical trade and then a structural trade will revisit."
"2685750","2687450"," And I said, I agree with you. "
"2688050","2689850"," We've been talking about that in this program."
"2690670","2693210"," I talk about Mary the Landscaper, right?"
"2694050","2695670"," You guys remember Mary the Landscaper?"
"2695670","2699550"," How many times have I used her as a heel, right?"
"2700270","2702030"," He's married the Landscaper as a heel."
"2702030","2708110"," And I tell you, there is a cyclical trade still playing out from COVID. "
"2708270","2714850"," It's like you've got, you have the normal economic business cycle, seasonality cycle going on,"
"2714990","2715110"," right?"
"2715950","2718890"," And then we threw a giant fucking wrench in it with COVID."
"2719830","2726430"," And now you've got not just one cog going, but you have a second cog going and they're not matched"
"2726430","2726690"," up."
"2726690","2728290"," The gears are not together. "
"2728610","2729730"," They're not rolling in the same."
"2731430","2735670"," And so you're watching this secondary cycle play out."
"2736810","2740530"," This secondary business cycle play out in the background. "
"2743550","2747530"," I'm watching some of these companies, these spec growth companies."
"2747770","2752070"," I've been watching them now in the background with Winky for a period of time."
"2752730","2756530"," And I'm reading their ER statements over a quarter, over a quarter. "
"2756730","2758090"," I'm looking at their year of year sales."
"2758450","2761450"," I'm looking out there with their producing, right?"
"2761650","2762510"," Like all this different stuff."
"2762650","2763750"," And I'm like, hey, yeah, that company. "
"2764290","2765690"," Yeah, like Peton sucks."
"2765990","2769110"," They didn't make a bicycle for outside after the COVID trade with this other friend company over"
"2769110","2769350"," here."
"2770930","2772570"," They have actual products. "
"2772810","2773690"," They're not promising anything."
"2774530","2775930"," They're making a ton of money."
"2776350","2777730"," They're definitely not going bankrupt. "
"2778650","2780630"," None of their ERs have been bad."
"2781290","2785030"," They went to the moon, came back down to reality."
"2786130","2787410"," They're priced appropriately. "
"2789470","2791810"," And their last three quarters are outstanding."
"2792890","2795750"," They're still there in the background going, fuck yeah, everything's awesome."
"2796930","2800650"," Yeah, we know that our price was re-priced, but now it looks great, right?"
"2802490","2809110"," And you've got hedge funds out there that are buying these tickers and running them up in the"
"2809110","2809490"," background. "
"2811550","2817970"," And I think part, not think, but part of this is that Mary the landscaper did the right thing."
"2818190","2819890"," You guys like to consume shit on the internet."
"2821770","2824010"," You like to consume the zeitgeist, right?"
"2824910","2828910"," Like Mary was a snorton cocaine or Mary didn't pay her college bills. "
"2830030","2832230"," Mary didn't, Mary was at the casino."
"2832870","2835190"," Mary, I don't know, fucking was eating bonbons."
"2836090","2838910"," During COVID, and I don't think that was everybody. "
"2839570","2844190"," There was a portion of people, I was reading on Reddit last night, people were going, greatest"
"2844190","2849730"," fraud committed during COVID was businesses getting PPP loans."
"2850510","2851850"," But they didn't have to pay back."
"2852150","2854330"," And I was like, okay, so what do those fucking companies do?"
"2855430","2858930"," And some people think that most of those companies didn't do the right thing. "
"2859410","2866710"," I assure you that probably a fair percentage of those companies had some responsible people that"
"2866710","2869850"," said, woo, we were on our last fucking leg there."
"2869850","2870850"," We got a free handout."
"2871370","2873670"," We're going to reinvest this money for the right thing. "
"2874650","2878270"," Try to, try to, try to out run this COVID shit at the time, right?"
"2879350","2884330"," And so now we're reopening after COVID and they have, they're on good footing."
"2885050","2886710"," Some of these companies aren't good footing."
"2886930","2887790"," They paid off their debt. "
"2888590","2891230"," They, they, they transformed into the company they are."
"2891330","2892670"," They don't care about their stock price."
"2894510","2895770"," Mary has a new truck. "
"2896110","2897710"," Mary has new lawn mowing equipment."
"2898070","2899270"," Mary paid off her mortgage."
"2901750","2905690"," So there are those people and there, there is that small cycle going on in the background. "
"2906410","2909050"," That is why unemployment is not where it's at."
"2911490","2914050"," You also have proxy wars going on."
"2914390","2915830"," That's why GDP is still up. "
"2916250","2917450"," I mean, there's some things out there."
"2917650","2918790"," There's some things going on."
"2920790","2923150"," Inflation's coming down, but it's not at the bottom. "
"2923150","2923730"," Is it?"
"2924190","2925970"," You guys all know about fed funds rate."
"2926210","2927410"," I hope you know about inflation."
"2928030","2932050"," Hope you know about the yield curve, which doesn't matter at all. "
"2932490","2933290"," Be honest with you."
"2936330","2942310"," But truly like the two big ones inflation unemployment rate."
"2942650","2947590"," And even if the unemployment rate is rising, there's a Goldilocks zone. "
"2947590","2951570"," It's where I need to hire somebody and I can't find them."
"2952510","2953030"," Right?"
"2953210","2954910"," There's unemployment rates still rising."
"2955430","2956790"," There's like this sweet spot. "
"2957130","2958670"," And that sweet spot's still there."
"2959390","2960810"," Retail sales right up."
"2965880","2966680"," There we go. "
"2966860","2967840"," Nice little rule right here."
"2968760","2973620"," So right now, so that you know, we are above the hourly trigger, right?"
"2973820","2974720"," The only triggers right here."
"2976140","2977600"," Getting a pullback right now. "
"2977680","2978520"," We're going to go down and check."
"2979960","2981300"," Let's put this in a one minute chart."
"2982960","2984320"," Nice little rule right here. "
"2984420","2985340"," Nice little bear cross."
"2986360","2987040"," Barrow plane."
"2987740","2997630"," Come back down here and check 4.37.75. Might be a nice little five"
"2997630","2998570"," minute trade for you. "
"3002830","3005690"," My take here is that for the next two weeks."
"3006190","3007530"," So it saves the 15th, right?"
"3008370","3009390"," Into the 30th."
"3009470","3011310"," You're going to see the consolidation trade. "
"3011590","3012990"," You're going to see them park in the bus trade."
"3013590","3016890"," You might see some nice volatility trades for exploration."
"3021230","3023010"," And you're going to see them load up. "
"3023170","3026470"," You're going to watch these buyers load up in the next two weeks."
"3027410","3030530"," We're going to get the new JPM caller trade on the 30th."
"3031190","3034890"," If you're a long time trader, my assumption here is that. "
"3035410","3036650"," It's like another friend this morning."
"3036810","3040430"," I'm like, if you started trading on March 31st, right?"
"3042010","3044390"," Like from April, May and June."
"3045270","3047450"," You're wrapping up your trades right now. "
"3047630","3049010"," You're waiting for the 30th."
"3049390","3051490"," And you're going to then trade the next quarter."
"3052210","3053730"," You're not trading right now. "
"3053830","3056150"," You could be trade zero dates and shit weekly's."
"3057990","3062530"," But the next two weeks, you know, it's just a consolidation trade, right?"
"3063350","3064470"," We parked the bus."
"3064770","3066970"," We wait for the banks to tell us where we're going. "
"3067810","3070790"," And then we trade the next quarter."
"3072590","3073070"," Right."
"3075110","3076870"," We're going to trade the next quarter together. "
"3077070","3077710"," It's going to be fun."
"3077930","3079070"," I assure you, we'll start."
"3080450","3081970"," July 1st, that quarter. "
"3082710","3085230"," And I will see you on the other side of that quarter."
"3085890","3087010"," When we're here, right?"
"3087230","3089230"," We got July, August, September, right?"
"3089870","3091190"," So September 15th."
"3091970","3094170"," If you trade with me between July 1st. "
"3094930","3096250"," In September 30th."
"3097110","3098110"," We'll be sitting here together."
"3098110","3100630"," On September 15th going. "
"3100930","3101150"," Yeah."
"3101910","3102690"," Let's park the bus."
"3103230","3104330"," Whether it's up down. "
"3104550","3106450"," I don't care sideways, wherever it is."
"3107370","3108530"," We'll be parking the bus."
"3109210","3113490"," And there'll be more people rolling through saying, well, let's do it. "
"3113490","3115450"," And I'll be like, yeah, you know, you got two weeks of this."
"3116230","3117510"," We got two weeks of."
"3118070","3119470"," Uh, parking the bus. "
"3120410","3122530"," In war planning for the next quarter."
"3129760","3131900"," It's been six months since the bus has stopped."
"3131900","3134000"," Uh, yeah, we had the first trade. "
"3134160","3135680"," We had the first trade started in what?"
"3135960","3136020"," October."
"3136620","3138220"," It actually made June of last year."
"3138320","3139040"," The first trade started. "
"3139320","3140740"," Then October was the big one."
"3141340","3144560"," I think that was October 13th or 15th or something like that."
"3144980","3146960"," And we had a, or we had a December trade. "
"3147220","3148060"," Then we had a March trade."
"3149140","3151440"," And now we're coming into a July trade."
"3152760","3153800"," Now the next couple of weeks. "
"3154320","3156340"," I think that trade is up."
"3156580","3160840"," So when you're looking to put some size on the market and that kind of stuff."
"3160840","3162520"," It should be a fun trade. "
"3163540","3168040"," I'm assuming if you're a seller out there that you are fascinated to find out."
"3168680","3171240"," What the next caller trade is going to be."
"3171540","3172120"," And I am too. "
"3173280","3176980"," I'm interested because of the language from Jerome."
"3178460","3180280"," My assumption here is."
"3181300","3183500"," That they will raise the bottom caller. "
"3185960","3187620"," For the summer."
"3189080","3192260"," And then they will lower the bottom caller once we come into fall."
"3193780","3194920"," It should be fascinating. "
"3199260","3201100"," So I have some meetings this morning."
"3202840","3204480"," I have to take some phone calls."
"3204700","3205900"," I've got some guys with these. "
"3206200","3209080"," I have some developers that have to speak to this morning."
"3209760","3211220"," And I have some work I have to do."
"3212500","3215500"," Some technical work for my or some stuff that I have to do. "
"3216140","3217900"," As like an owner kind of bullshit."
"3220020","3221420"," That I have to do this morning."
"3221640","3222980"," So I'll be here with you this morning. "
"3223660","3225740"," Trade what's in front of you guys know all the rules."
"3226280","3227380"," Talk to each other in chat."
"3228320","3230600"," You guys know all about fair planes, bull planes. "
"3231120","3233660"," You know about price being above the hourly."
"3234340","3235440"," And what that means."
"3236280","3238240"," You know that we're in a bullish context above. "
"3238560","3239700"," I'll leave this in a five minute here."
"3240540","3243880"," So as long as price is above the white line."
"3244260","3245080"," We are bullish right. "
"3245800","3249100"," You're also looking to tee off on the white line."
"3249100","3252380"," So whenever we come back down and test that white line."
"3252760","3252880"," Bam. "
"3253320","3254260"," It's another trade."
"3254420","3257060"," The upside stops underneath it right stops down here."
"3261220","3263400"," We also know that the target to the upside. "
"3263680","3265780"," This is the previous high from 2022."
"3266340","3268740"," You'd like to nail that one get that one out of here."
"3268740","3273380"," Yeah, this is where your true volatility is right inside of here. "
"3274760","3276100"," 2022 right back here."
"3277920","3279740"," There's also some cool trades here."
"3280220","3281820"," I'll talk to you about these on Sunday. "
"3282720","3284120"," Bitcoin is a big one."
"3284680","3286820"," If you are a Bitcoin bear, it'd be wary."
"3287840","3289960"," They're going to buy the fuck out of that bottom down there. "
"3290040","3292760"," I don't care if it's 17,000 24,000."
"3293940","3295740"," That shit is going way up."
"3295740","3299260"," Be careful on the Bitcoin trade. "
"3300000","3303900"," If you're a bear on Bitcoin that they're lying to you."
"3304660","3306360"," What's another one that I've been looking at?"
"3306640","3309500"," There's another one that I've been looking at in the background here with."
"3309760","3314540"," Not just Bitcoin, but there's some other shit people are talking about that I'm like, now they're"
"3314540","3315520"," running that shit too. "
"3317520","3321420"," Bitcoin right now sitting on the bottom of its channel."
"3321680","3322940"," It's actual upward channel."
"3323680","3324660"," Let's look at that one. "
"3324860","3326560"," Let me see if I can show you guys Bitcoin real quick."
"3348100","3350660"," Now this is more of a macro view on Bitcoin."
"3354770","3360290"," It's more of a macro view on Bitcoin here, but I do want to draw your attention to something. "
"3360430","3363910"," This is a chart that I use for when we start to top out."
"3365950","3368330"," And I'm going to put that right there for you."
"3369190","3371570"," And you can kind of see here in the background. "
"3373930","3375350"," I want to see that right there, right?"
"3376510","3378630"," Kind of like Max Bullishness, right?"
"3378810","3381330"," Price still squeeze in here here."
"3381970","3385350"," And you can already see the divesting of back Bitcoin in the background."
"3386710","3387190"," Right?"
"3387710","3392350"," And I also want to point out here this bottom down here. "
"3392670","3394150"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"3394270","3395450"," It's starting to come back up, right?"
"3396290","3397390"," Right down there."
"3398350","3399890"," You guys can't see all of this stuff. "
"3403890","3406250"," I'll show you this Max Velocity right here."
"3406290","3407330"," Do you see there right there?"
"3407430","3409410"," Bam, or boom, Max, Max, right?"
"3410010","3412430"," Paul already starting to roll off on the daily."
"3412990","3414810"," Always already starting to roll off on the weekly. "
"3415610","3417250"," The monthly is plateauing."
"3418050","3419170"," The quarterly is plateauing."
"3420050","3423690"," It's giving you a hint of things to come, right?"
"3424410","3424750"," A hint. "
"3426170","3426610"," Things to come."
"3427410","3428310"," Things to come."
"3428570","3429170"," Things to come. "
"3429330","3429890"," Things to come."
"3429890","3430310"," Things to come, right?"
"3432430","3433470"," Things in the future."
"3435250","3439810"," Down here, when I start to see the weekly bottoming out like this, now weekly is a little weak"
"3439810","3440330"," right here. "
"3440810","3441570"," It's not positive."
"3443490","3443890"," Right?"
"3444110","3445810"," But I'm going to expect that to come back up there."
"3445910","3446810"," It's kind of getting better. "
"3447830","3451330"," But this is really what I'm looking at down here, and I'm looking at that accumulation on the"
"3451330","3453010"," quarterly and the bottoming of the monthly."
"3453690","3457090"," So my point here is even if you see some kind of weakness."
"3459590","3460070"," In. "
"3461870","3467430"," And as this passes here, this month passes, two months past, three months past, you're actually"
"3467430","3469850"," going to see an explosive move to the upside here."
"3469930","3470830"," Here's 20,000."
"3471350","3474150"," Just in a macro theme here, right?"
"3474950","3475910"," Here you got October. "
"3476270","3477730"," You got December of 2024."
"3478670","3483910"," If you get this explosive move to the upside, you're going to get your ass handed to you."
"3485090","3490270"," You're going to get your ass handed to you as a, as a, as a, and I'm a, I can't"
"3490270","3492350"," stand crypto and I can't stand Bitcoin. "
"3493090","3495650"," So right now, right, 19, 649."
"3496450","3502230"," If for some reason we can get down there, I'm going to buy anything down here."
"3502470","3502830"," I'm going to buy. "
"3503030","3504410"," I don't think you get down here personally."
"3505370","3506230"," I'll be honest."
"3507210","3509010"," I don't think you get down there. "
"3510530","3515550"," All these forces coming up from down below are likely going to buy this here."
"3517010","3519230"," Look, you're going to come in here, right?"
"3519390","3521970"," And I want you to pay attention to this yellow line right here."
"3521970","3525790"," You might think that's bearish, but I can already tell you right now it's not. "
"3526110","3527930"," It's going to come swooping up like this."
"3528550","3533590"," What it's going to do is this is going to swoop down like that and price is going to maybe"
"3533590","3536770"," get a quick low and then start to slam higher."
"3539590","3544650"," And so if you're like a Bitcoin bear, any of that kind of shit, I would be really wary here. "
"3545850","3546510"," Extremely wary."
"3546890","3554730"," If you're looking for a next leg down on Bitcoin, you really need to see like price break, 19, 339,"
"3555650","3558570"," and have weekly and daily come down on top of it."
"3559250","3562850"," We'll be looking for like a market crash, like end of the world 2008 style. "
"3563110","3566170"," So until that happens, I don't see it on Bitcoin."
"3571620","3572800"," Didn't even wait, did it?"
"3573160","3575080"," Already trading 430, 73."
"3577100","3578340"," So I'll be back with you guys. "
"3578660","3582600"," I've got a meeting, so I've got like five meetings I got to do right now."
"3583700","3587520"," If you have any questions in the chat right now, if I can answer them quickly, I will."
"3590860","3598940"," Just so you know, I'm flat on Friday, 440 C's, and I've got two piles of puts. "
"3598940","3605260"," I've got some puts for today, and then I've got some puts for 420, but both were still bought with"
"3605260","3605660"," winnings."
"3605940","3607880"," So I don't really care if they burn, they'll just sit there."
"3608320","3614460"," And every high that we get up here, I'll buy more puts from winnings so it'll always be hedged as"
"3614460","3615340"," we make our way higher. "
"3619630","3621070"," Leave that up for you right now."
"3624980","3626240"," Top of the world, baby."
"3627340","3628780"," Top of the world. "
"3628780","3632700"," Let me check out your, let me check out your chat right now."
"3633060","3634560"," Give you guys a saying inside chat."
"3640680","3641980"," Alright, hold on, I'm coming, guys. "
"3644140","3647240"," Oh shit, I didn't talk about TGT, and I didn't talk about Bud."
"3648340","3650400"," We'll do TGT, Bud, and Tesla."
"3652840","3655120"," Because I promised you guys I would talk about that. "
"3661920","3662860"," I got you guys."
"3663100","3663720"," Hold on a second here."
"3665340","3668850"," I love all you guys here. "
"3669030","3669230"," Hold on."
"3672450","3674690"," Remember, this is a free community."
"3675170","3680230"," If you can't chat right now, if you're watching me on YouTube and wondering why you cannot chat"
"3680230","3688210"," today, sometimes we open up the chat on YouTube from time to time. "
"3688350","3690110"," I know yesterday was a day you guys wanted to chat."
"3690370","3691970"," Some people did something to get that chat."
"3692310","3695470"," Some regular members did a bunch of stuff for you guys to get that chat open yesterday. "
"3698150","3701570"," We put the membership fee on there for $5."
"3702030","3703790"," I get about $1.50 of that money."
"3705310","3707030"," The third of it goes to YouTube. "
"3707710","3708810"," Third of it, I pay taxes."
"3709090","3709690"," The other third, I keep."
"3710510","3718170"," The only reason that $5 is on there is because we used to be overrun by scammers, non-normal"
"3718170","3721390"," watchers that cleaned up the chat with that alpha, that kind of stuff. "
"3722290","3723950"," So we had to institute that."
"3724430","3728950"," If you are like, Hey, I don't pay money to for us."
"3729590","3733130"," I don't pay money to anybody charging any kind of money. "
"3733130","3734170"," I don't care if it's $5."
"3735130","3735870"," That's fine."
"3735970","3736930"," You have another option. "
"3737430","3742290"," You can go to Twitter or excuse me, Twitch and watch us there."
"3743410","3746150"," So if you're like a complainer, you are whiner."
"3746730","3748870"," You have some fucked up shit or whatever. "
"3749050","3749770"," I don't know what it is."
"3749770","3752250"," But if you're like, I don't pay, you don't have to."
"3752350","3754610"," You can go to Twitch, watch me there. "
"3755210","3764210"," You can sign up via Amazon prime gaming and subscribe to me there and you can chat for free."
"3765670","3772530"," So if you're like, Hey, you know, because what I'm doing here is I'm weeding out bullshitters."
"3773670","3775050"," That's what I'm doing. "
"3775810","3778670"," Weeding out scammers, bullshitters and all that kind of stuff."
"3779770","3781590"," So you do have a free option to chat."
"3782630","3788190"," So there's always a free option here with Captain Jim James. "
"3788310","3791550"," There always will be a free option here with Captain Jim James."
"3799780","3800860"," Okay, target."
"3801560","3802800"," We're gonna look at target here. "
"3803980","3807760"," We saw the rotation into Dow Jones industrial average."
"3810020","3815380"," You saw clowns on clowns on fin to it."
"3816220","3819960"," Saying if we're in a bull run, target should be the leader. "
"3820640","3822100"," And shocker."
"3822580","3823040"," Here it is."
"3823520","3824920"," Ripping faces off, right?"
"3826440","3836960"," As long as price stays above the hourly trigger at 132.60. Price target above 139.59. Now"
"3836960","3842660"," with that said, it's getting a little long and the tooth, right?"
"3844100","3846160"," It's getting a little long up here, right?"
"3846400","3847720"," It's getting a little long up here. "
"3848400","3849700"," You see that one right there?"
"3850780","3857460"," It's kind of a place where you start taking some off and maybe you leave 25% on, right?"
"3857660","3859220"," You'll see that rejection right there."
"3860140","3864740"," This hourly is going to come up and you're going to see another entry, hopefully."
"3865840","3867920"," So you take the money off here, right where you are. "
"3869060","3871320"," And you could leave some on if you wanted to get up there."
"3871960","3877780"," You're looking for, let me see, it stays on the 20th to the 21st."
"3878760","3882200"," You want to see if we get a consolidation here and a move higher. "
"3883540","3885180"," So I'm going to draw this in for you here."
"3889190","3890510"," Right about right where you are."
"3891350","3891890"," Right there. "
"3894490","3895210"," Right there."
"3896450","3898790"," And you'll be looking for a consolidation trade from here."
"3900510","3902650"," Move this down so you can see velocity on it. "
"3902650","3905130"," I want you to know that you see this velocity right."
"3905270","3906770"," We're a little bit long on the tooth and the hourly."
"3908190","3911190"," But we've got daily here that's a monster. "
"3913370","3918930"," So I'm going to expect the daily to come screaming up here."
"3919590","3922170"," I'm going to expect now you don't have to take this trade."
"3922290","3925510"," I think it's risky still, but you're probably going to explode to the upside here. "
"3926030","3933210"," Come back down, consolidate, and then make this next move up to this weekly at 1.50 over here."
"3933470","3939070"," That's your next target up here, 1.50. Once you hit 1.50 up here, it's likely going to consolidate"
"3939070","3939650"," some more."
"3940170","3945650"," You're going to see the daily and the hourly come up and you'll start getting even higher highs. "
"3946290","3952930"," So currently we're at the beginning of our price target, 1.36 to 1.39. From there, you're looking"
"3952930","3961810"," for the next trade from 1.40 to 1.52. And then your next trade from there is $171.86"
"3961810","3963770"," on target."
"3964890","3965530"," Budweiser."
"3966210","3966690"," Bud. "
"3967570","3977050"," You know, I was reading out a Reddit post on modello taking over as the leader of the king of"
"3977050","3977210"," bears."
"3977890","3978710"," I'm like, well, number one."
"3980070","3982210"," I was like Budweiser. "
"3982510","3985250"," I was like, I read every comment, like 1,000 comments."
"3985250","3992210"," And I'm like, this is where the masses and where the plebs are regurgitating and not paying"
"3992210","3992610"," attention."
"3993550","3996030"," This is where an investor is not paying attention. "
"3996810","3998950"," This is where a trainer is not paying attention."
"3999610","4005890"," You're consuming garbage on the internet, and then you're regurgitating it and you're not actually"
"4005890","4007310"," looking at what it really means."
"4009170","4011910"," There's a reason that news is out there. "
"4012470","4013310"," And what do we get?"
"4013490","4013850"," We got a bounce."
"4014910","4015590"," Got another bounce."
"4016610","4017310"," Got another bounce. "
"4017670","4019690"," Look at velocity down here."
"4020250","4022050"," Monster velocity to the upside."
"4023250","4024170"," It's ready to fuck. "
"4025150","4026350"," Bud wants to fuck."
"4027450","4030710"," And you see how it just blasted through this yellow right here?"
"4031090","4034190"," This is what I was talking about on TGT."
"4035070","4035550"," Same. "
"4035750","4038430"," It's going to blast right through the yellow line just like on TGT."
"4038430","4039750"," And what did it do?"
"4040110","4041550"," Ripped faces through it."
"4042070","4043870"," You got a squeeze play here, right?"
"4044970","4045630"," Squeeze play. "
"4046010","4047050"," And what is it doing right now?"
"4047230","4053370"," Squeeze and trading 4.58.03. You are looking for, and these trades right here, you're looking for"
"4053370","4056130"," the break above the rejection."
"4056870","4058470"," And this is called a kiss trade."
"4059710","4060950"," It's called a kiss trade. "
"4061270","4061450"," Right here."
"4061570","4062890"," Boom, you go up, you come back down."
"4063610","4064930"," This green line comes up. "
"4065090","4067010"," It confirms the trade."
"4067010","4070890"," And then you get even more explosive trade to the upside."
"4071010","4075110"," You've got 59.50. You've got 60 bucks to the upside up there. "
"4075630","4079390"," I do expect some consolidation at some point on Budweiser."
"4079910","4082290"," I expect these explosive moves here."
"4082490","4085290"," One bam, two bam, three bam. "
"4085730","4091130"," Show its head above, sixty-five, sixty-three, sixty-five dollars, believe it or not."
"4092130","4094010"," Some consolidation in here."
"4094010","4097950"," And then a continuation higher from there. "
"4098430","4101270"," I want to explain something to you about Budweiser here."
"4105410","4106870"," We're going to look at Bud."
"4109149","4111830"," We're going to look over it over a weekly chart. "
"4113390","4116689"," And just the pure stupidity out there."
"4119470","4124450"," The decline began on Budweiser in 2016, September."
"4124950","4127210"," You've got some guy that spent, what are we at?"
"4127490","4128370"," 2023, right?"
"4129130","4130370"," They rode it all the way up. "
"4130729","4131850"," They rode it down, right?"
"4131990","4133790"," This is like an old man trade right here, right?"
"4134250","4138029"," You sell it, you buy it, you sell it, you buy it, you buy it."
"4138689","4143689"," And then you've got some hedge fund out there that's like, well, I guess we're going to bankrupt"
"4143689","4145130"," Budweiser, aren't we, right?"
"4145890","4147450"," We're going to bankrupt Budweiser."
"4147930","4148390"," Put on. "
"4149069","4153830"," Let's find somebody out there to make some bullshit news up so I can get paid, right?"
"4155370","4158050"," Up down, up down, up down."
"4158330","4159350"," And we get down here."
"4160450","4161790"," And what is it?"
"4162790","4164050"," Well, I don't know. "
"4164250","4169470"," I'll pay somebody off at Budweiser to put some bullshit out with a can of beer for some influencer."
"4170229","4173029"," You know, we'll push it on fucking social media."
"4173090","4173970"," We'll push it out there. "
"4174490","4176350"," Because what does that sell side want?"
"4176609","4177330"," They want down here."
"4177550","4178270"," They want zero."
"4179250","4180830"," They want max profits. "
"4181410","4182370"," Well, did they get it?"
"4182710","4184109"," They fucking didn't."
"4184470","4187470"," Not only did they not get it, right?"
"4187870","4192790"," Not only did they not get it, but we have a series of higher lows on a weekly chart."
"4193210","4194270"," One, two, and three. "
"4195210","4197390"," And meanwhile, you're just reading garbage."
"4198410","4201950"," And there's a market maker out there that's like, I bought the fuck out of this."
"4202630","4206630"," And they're looking for an explosive move to the upside on Bud. "
"4206630","4215610"," And I assure you, when that move happens right on Budweiser, those same masses, plebs, whatever you"
"4215610","4219770"," want to call them, up here when Budweiser is the king of beers again."
"4220470","4227050"," We'll come back out on social media and they'll say something stupid like, yeah, fuck Budweiser."
"4227170","4228290"," They're the worst beer ever made. "
"4228570","4231050"," Of course, they're the number one beer in the world again or in America."
"4231770","4233750"," They're going to forget about the LGBT stuff."
"4234510","4236990"," This is all greed, market making. "
"4237590","4239490"," I'm telling you like this stuff here, right?"
"4240050","4246810"," When you guys are reading or hearing the noise and cacophony, it's almost always the opposite."
"4247830","4250650"," So right down here at Budweiser, just look at that in a weekly chart."
"4250750","4251370"," It's just waiting. "
"4251970","4254110"," One, two, and three."
"4254490","4256810"," An explosive move to the upside right there."
"4258770","4259790"," Explosive move. "
"4260610","4262170"," You're not even going to remember it."
"4262710","4265550"," And right now on Budweiser, what is it trying to do here?"
"4266870","4267750"," What's it trying to do?"
"4267870","4268710"," It's trying to get up here."
"4268850","4269670"," It's a weekly chart. "
"4270470","4271570"," It's not even a daily chart."
"4271730","4272730"," It's trying to break above."
"4273870","4274230"," Right?"
"4274430","4276550"," It's trying to get that cross on a weekly. "
"4278750","4280630"," Trying to get that cross right there."
"4280750","4281130"," You see it?"
"4283990","4284710"," Right there."
"4285030","4287210"," And that is going to be a monster move. "
"4288730","4289830"," Monster upside move."
"4290030","4290870"," Bam, confirm it."
"4291130","4292550"," And then boom, boom, boom. "
"4293330","4295110"," That's your whole year right there, right?"
"4295350","4295690"," 2024."
"4296670","4297970"," It's going to monster crank."
"4298950","4300330"," And you're going to be left behind. "
"4301070","4302550"," And you're going to say it's dependent nonsense."
"4302870","4303750"," You're going to be caught short."
"4304930","4305690"," Whatever it is. "
"4305830","4309230"," You're going to be consuming that garbage out there that has nothing to do with greed."
"4310190","4311390"," And greed is the name of the game."
"4313150","4314010"," Greed, baby. "
"4320250","4321630"," It's always about greed."
"4322870","4324970"," It's always every time it's about greed."
"4327350","4328370"," It's about greed. "
"4333800","4334320"," Budweiser."
"4335660","4336180"," Target."
"4339920","4341400"," And then we've got the last one. "
"4341460","4342500"," Everybody's all fired up."
"4342580","4345100"," I bet there's a whole group of you out there."
"4345140","4346340"," You're all fucking testables. "
"4347120","4348680"," Got your pitchforks out."
"4349840","4351500"," I deleted that tweet too."
"4351940","4353540"," I've been deleting tweets for like the past. "
"4353800","4355240"," I'm trying to delete my whole history."
"4355920","4359860"," And I deleted a bunch of tweets about a bunch of shit about Tesla that I actually know."
"4361620","4362960"," I'm like 300 soon. "
"4363360","4365560"," I was like, I didn't think it would be that soon, boys and girls."
"4366200","4367380"," You guys got right on that tweet."
"4367640","4369200"," Talked about the cyber truck. "
"4369380","4370360"," Some of you saved that shit."
"4371160","4372760"," Some of you guys went in like the way back machine."
"4372760","4375520"," I just wanted a few people to see those tweets. "
"4377700","4379840"," I didn't want to like keep it on fin to it."
"4380520","4382780"," I was like, I think I was drunk or something."
"4383000","4383780"," I'm like, yeah, I'll tell them. "
"4383820","4385060"," Maybe I'll tell them."
"4385100","4385700"," Maybe I won't."
"4386100","4387100"," I'm like, maybe I can. "
"4387220","4387840"," Maybe I can't tell."
"4387980","4388720"," I don't know if it's possible."
"4393940","4396720"," Some of you guys have been trading Tesla with me since the beginning, right?"
"4397380","4400420"," Some of you guys have been trading Tesla with me for multiple years. "
"4402080","4402720"," Multiple years."
"4402720","4404080"," These have secret chats."
"4404360","4404900"," Remember that stuff?"
"4406980","4407580"," Tesla. "
"4409620","4411880"," Still on trend to 300."
"4413940","4416280"," Got that 350 tag up there, right?"
"4417160","4418840"," Look at that boss up here."
"4419260","4419940"," What are they at right now?"
"4420300","4421540"," 89 Jesus Tesla. "
"4423860","4425740"," My, my, my Tesla."
"4427040","4430260"," You've got explosive move with the daily above the weekly."
"4430260","4433360"," You've got the daily about to cross the monthly here. "
"4434660","4437040"," You're just consolidating right now, brothers and sisters."
"4437360","4437900"," That's all you're doing."
"4437900","4439340"," You're in consolidation phase. "
"4441300","4443080"," That's all you are right now."
"4443520","4444200"," Consolidate, baby."
"4445660","4446280"," Consolidate. "
"4446680","4448680"," You push up here, right?"
"4449620","4450520"," Push up here."
"4450960","4452460"," Still have support right here."
"4453180","4454260"," Buyers still here. "
"4455520","4456760"," These buyers right here."
"4457380","4457820"," Still here."
"4458740","4459540"," Name of the game. "
"4459980","4460380"," Consolidate."
"4460560","4462580"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"4462740","4465760"," Even if you get a weak moment down here, right?"
"4465980","4470360"," This thing bad boys going to come right up and snatch you and take you right up to Valhalla 300. "
"4471260","4471520"," Right there."
"4474100","4474660"," What's that?"
"4474960","4477240"," Let's call it a July 30th."
"4479060","4479860"," Right in there. "
"4480100","4481820"," Worst case scenario, July 30th price target."
"4482720","4482920"," 300."
"4484060","4487420"," If you want to know if the trade is dead, the trade is dead below 247. "
"4487420","4487900"," 85."
"4489420","4494320"," If you're looking to make an entry, let's say we roll the market down between now and then."
"4494740","4497340"," So you start breaking down, you're like, okay, cut my stuff. "
"4497500","4497940"," Take my start."
"4498220","4499240"," You do this stuff here."
"4499600","4502020"," That's not actually, you don't really take stops there. "
"4502120","4503980"," You take stops when it starts to reject."
"4504520","4506100"," So your stops are like right there."
"4506720","4509320"," And then you're looking for the next place right here to buy. "
"4510040","4511620"," Probably 230 bucks."
"4512320","4513740"," Should be your reentry."
"4514920","4519060"," Consolidate for a July mid-July move to that 300 above up there. "
"4519640","4520640"," So you at least have your levels."
"4522040","4523000"," It's right here, baby."
"4523320","4523960"," Here's your buy levels. "
"4524060","4524560"," You buy here."
"4524640","4525400"," You buy this dip."
"4525720","4526460"," You're testable. "
"4526680","4527880"," You're buying that dip."
"4528480","4531840"," You're buying any break above this consolidation, right?"
"4532540","4533420"," You buy here."
"4533660","4534560"," You buy here. "
"4534680","4535660"," You buy here."
"4536280","4536800"," Stops underneath."
"4537980","4539300"," All right, I'll give it to you one more time. "
"4539320","4539500"," Ready?"
"4540780","4542680"," Buy with stops below and 264."
"4543580","4547260"," Buy with stops below and 247.85. Buy at 220."
"4548140","4548440"," 212. "
"4549520","4551620"," Hopefully you can get that sweet ass 212, man."
"4551720","4552740"," I'd love to buy that shit."
"4553080","4554400"," I fucking love this, man. "
"4554960","4556380"," Like boom, rocket ship."
"4556600","4558340"," Just a big break and then slam it."
"4558960","4559760"," That's just me though. "
"4559840","4560420"," I'm cheap as fuck."
"4562980","4563580"," I'm greedy."
"4563960","4565560"," I'm not your kind of bull. "
"4565820","4568540"," A lot of you guys are bulls are like, I bought calls here."
"4568540","4569600"," I bought calls here."
"4569700","4570540"," I bought calls here. "
"4570680","4573080"," I'm just like, give me one fucking dip, man."
"4573300","4573780"," Just give me one."
"4574140","4575660"," I just want that one face ripper. "
"4576400","4578120"," I'll let that guy buy this up here."
"4582040","4583480"," That's the kind of bull I am."
"4583860","4585340"," I might not be your kind of bull. "
"4586520","4588320"," Some of you guys trade Tesla every day."
"4588420","4589940"," You're like, I'll buy that right there."
"4590000","4591580"," If it comes back down, I'll buy it again. "
"4591900","4592420"," Buy it again."
"4592720","4593080"," Buy it again."
"4593360","4594680"," Then I'll buy it for the last trip. "
"4594900","4595460"," I don't do that."
"4597740","4598900"," Hold on, I need some water."
"4599580","4600940"," My voice is killing me today. "
"4611290","4614830"," If I had a buy on Tesla that I wanted to buy, I'll tell you the truth."
"4616230","4618990"," 213, 197."
"4620350","4621650"," Will I get that dip by?"
"4622050","4622370"," Probably not. "
"4623030","4624570"," I know that at some point I will."
"4625950","4627430"," These lines will move up."
"4627650","4628210"," We'll roll over. "
"4628210","4631430"," We'll trade sideways in time."
"4631970","4632710"," I will show up."
"4633010","4635210"," Some of you guys out there, I send text messages. "
"4635450","4637310"," I'm like, it's time to buy Tesla again."
"4641240","4643220"," I get you guys are going to chase us."
"4643400","4645640"," This is trading $4.39.82, baby. "
"4646460","4647660"," Keep our own truck in."
"4650260","4651820"," There you go."
"4651820","4653420"," I think I gave it all to you. "
"4654220","4657160"," I think I've done every ticker that I needed to."

"5241050","5243390"," It's very expensive to do what we do here."
"5243970","5247730"," And the time behind it is huge."
"5248090","5250170"," Like he's the people that are working in the background right now. "

"5267390","5269350"," That costs a lot of money."
"5269550","5270890"," The data costs a lot of money."
"5272790","5277270"," The like I feel like I've built two offices. "
"5277710","5282450"," The equipment that I have is in the now probably $20,000 equipment."
"5283110","5287250"," The cost for me to do this just every day every month costs me $1,000 a month."
"5287390","5287910"," Something like that. "
"5289170","5289590"," Somewhere in there."
"5290230","5292210"," That doesn't include any of the time or effort."
"5292450","5296870"," So someone made a comment saying, I don't know why people charge money. "
"5299890","5301770"," If they're making so much money."
"5302110","5306050"," The tons of money that I make."
"5306650","5307610"," I'm paying for this. "

"5316570","5317810"," I have to take care of them too."
"5319010","5321690"," So this is extra on top of all of that money. "
"5322430","5325710"," I'm not just like some kid in my basement or something like that."
"5327190","5328970"," And this is all still free."

"5466230","5467210"," It makes me cry."
"5467210","5468910"," I was crying a couple days ago on the stream."
"5469710","5471090"," To blow my face off. "
"5472210","5473930"," Joe Donut is my partner."
"5474590","5474950"," Why?"
"5475610","5476470"," Ask him what his job is."
"5476870","5478210"," He's the chief compliance officer. "
"5479050","5482130"," He's the chief compliance officer to make sure I'm not a fucking furu."
"5482270","5483050"," And I'm not a scumbag."
"5483650","5485170"," I don't turn into like a meat. "
"5485350","5486250"," Not going to say the names."
"5486610","5487790"," I'm not going to turn into somebody."
"5488050","5489170"," Find a G four. "
"5489830","5491750"," Drive in a Lambo or any of that kind of shit."
"5492090","5492690"," Just a normal guy."
"5494110","5496130"," Some of you guys meet me in real life. "
"5496130","5496170"," I'm not going to say it."
"5496270","5497290"," Matter of fact, I'm going to meet."
"5497930","5498690"," Uh, Winky. "
"5499530","5501430"," I'm going to go meet him next week, I believe."
"5502010","5503390"," And I'm a normal motherfucker."
"5503550","5507330"," You're not going to roll up in a Lambo or a limousine or a G four. "
"5508330","5509230"," I'm bringing my wife."
"5509550","5510670"," We're going to go to a concert together."
"5512970","5513890"," This is a normal guy. "
"5516650","5517250"," All right."
"5517530","5517810"," So."
"5519030","5519650"," I will be back. "
"5520310","5521390"," I'll be here with you."
"5521970","5522970"," You know the rule, right?"
"5522970","5526150"," We trade above this five minute line here, this white line."
"5526370","5526810"," We are bullish. "
"5527650","5529170"," We are going up here to tag."
"5529770","5532610"," The previous high at four forty one four forty one."
"5532830","5534290"," Oh, three and four forty one. "
"5534670","5535650"," Thirty seven."
"5535930","5536510"," Excuse me."
"5536570","5537010"," To the upside. "
"5538250","5539090"," R two."
"5540190","5541250"," Four forty two."
"5541470","5541810"," Oh, eight. "
"5543350","5544290"," Grinding, baby."
"5545230","5545530"," Grinding."
"5547390","5549030"," And I will be back with you. "
"5549550","5550830"," If anything changes."
"5551550","5553050"," You do know what to look for."
"5553570","5556430"," If you are a seller, you know what to look for, right?"
"5556550","5558470"," I'm going to draw this up for you like I did yesterday. "
"5558630","5559950"," So we were yesterday in stream."
"5560750","5561870"," And I was, I had drawn something."
"5562030","5562930"," If you're new to us, right?"
"5563150","5565110"," I'm going to draw something out for you here so you can see it. "
"5565410","5567270"," This is a five minute chart right here."
"5567710","5569710"," And I'm going to show you two examples here, okay?"
"5570670","5571530"," If you're a seller."
"5574850","5575970"," And you're trading. "
"5576150","5577310"," Your day trader, you're a seller."
"5577430","5578710"," It's a five minute chart right here."
"5579590","5581190"," I'm going to draw something out for you here. "
"5582770","5583170"," Okay."
"5585710","5587850"," There's three stages to a sell trade."
"5588390","5588830"," Three stages. "
"5595420","5597080"," Three stages to a sell trade."
"5597440","5597500"," So."
"5599080","5599740"," Then get this right here. "
"5600240","5602820"," So let's say we come up here and we tag this right."
"5604840","5606620"," And you're like, oh, I want to sell that."
"5606780","5607280"," That's the top. "
"5608560","5610700"," So you get the reversal down here, right?"
"5611720","5616120"," Well, that's trade number one right there, okay?"
"5618540","5619860"," You're like in and out."
"5620040","5620320"," Damn."
"5620600","5621540"," Two, three minute trade. "
"5623060","5623080"," Right?"
"5623800","5625820"," There's a secondary trade in here."
"5627100","5627580"," Okay."
"5628920","5631160"," This is a dangerous trade, but it's trade number two. "
"5631260","5635380"," If you're trading this on a one minute chart or something like that, it's a secondary trade in"
"5635380","5635500"," here."
"5636200","5638020"," Now inside of this trade right here."
"5642000","5645620"," It's very dangerous for you. "
"5648630","5651570"," This is oftentimes where people get trapped."
"5651890","5654990"," They lose a lot of money in here because it's going to reverse and go to the upside."
"5656070","5656190"," Now. "
"5657610","5662430"," The, the banker trade, like the one that makes actual money where it's like confirmed and you're"
"5662430","5663170"," going to make some money."
"5664070","5664290"," Um."
"5665710","5666630"," I mean, or not. "
"5667170","5667250"," But."
"5670430","5683420"," My point"
"5683420","5684320"," to you, though, is that."
"5687180","5687580"," There. "
"5691020","5695140"," My point to you, though, is that these, like this can reverse on you here."
"5695340","5695440"," Okay."
"5695640","5696420"," Go to the upside, right?"
"5697000","5698660"," You like, you're like, yeah, I'm short here. "
"5699200","5700100"," I didn't close here."
"5700260","5700960"," You should have closed."
"5701480","5703980"," You wanted to take this one down here for a couple of seconds. "
"5704700","5704900"," Fine."
"5705260","5706440"," You should still close here."
"5706440","5710360"," What normally happens is you'll get one, two, and three minimum. "
"5710960","5712980"," This will erase anything that you made in here."
"5713500","5718460"," Sometimes you'll even go slightly higher and you'll see dealers creep in and they'll erase your"
"5718460","5719340"," trade as well, right?"
"5720220","5721760"," You'll see this kind of nonsense in here."
"5722180","5722940"," You see a breakdown. "
"5723800","5724480"," I'm back up."
"5725160","5726680"," And only when you're right here."
"5727620","5729260"," You actually get the pay trade. "
"5729840","5732200"," You as a seller, you want to be seeing."
"5733280","5736380"," This part of the trade right here."
"5737040","5737520"," Okay. "
"5737720","5739580"," Say like one, two, the initial move down."
"5739800","5741460"," Stay out of this zone right here."
"5742200","5744080"," Never get involved in that trade. "
"5744860","5749420"," You're standing sitting there with the pan and the cell button to nail it, right?"
"5749900","5755880"," But not until you see the rejection here and the rejection here and the beginning of a bleed down"
"5755880","5756120"," here."
"5756720","5760840"," And then that's where you put on your short or your put and you put a stop above it up"
"5760840","5761560"," here, right?"
"5762800","5766180"," And normally I won't even do it until you get below whatever that green line is."
"5766440","5768100"," Like right there, I'll just be ready to slam it. "
"5768740","5770480"," And then I've already set up to the downside."
"5771080","5773940"," Some targets down below previous pivots, right?"
"5774460","5777400"," I'll slap on like, slap on something like this right here."
"5777780","5778060"," Bam. "
"5778500","5778840"," Right?"
"5779220","5780860"," I know about these two down here."
"5781340","5783680"," And I'm looking for that direct tack down below."
"5784540","5786200"," Same thing is here with the bulls. "
"5786940","5788140"," So three trigger cluster."
"5789320","5791280"," This morning on fin to it, I said, hey, oh shit."
"5791460","5793020"," We got a three trigger cluster coming up. "
"5793080","5794800"," We got a bull plane coming up right here."
"5794800","5796980"," You can see the move right here, right?"
"5797360","5797980"," One, two."
"5798280","5799220"," This is a bull plane. "
"5799700","5808960"," We've got a cross happening of the hourly trigger, the 2070MA and the 129MA."
"5809580","5811760"," And price was above, right?"
"5811920","5813540"," You can see it right here, the same kind of a deal."
"5814800","5814820"," Right?"
"5815280","5815660"," Price goes above. "
"5815940","5816360"," You have a cross."
"5817020","5819080"," This is upside down bear trade right here."
"5819500","5821060"," One, two, and three, right?"
"5821300","5822100"," One, two, three, right there. "
"5822220","5822700"," One, two, three."
"5822700","5824660"," You have the upside down cross."
"5825440","5827380"," Just like I was showing you the cross the other way. "
"5827840","5829520"," One, two, three, boom, move higher."
"5830500","5830840"," Confirm."
"5831240","5832040"," Trade it higher, right?"
"5832780","5838860"," You can see us now trading all the way up on a trend day into the previous high of 2022"
"5838860","5843500"," at 441.03. R2 is above. "
"5843920","5845040"," Another target up on high."
"5851750","5852350"," And I'll be back."
"5871410","5872330"," Brad Phillips. "
"5875090","5882010"," Brad, can you text or can you put in the chat right now what your, your exact handle is on"
"5882010","5882330"," Discord?"

"5890450","5895130"," Can you put anything or can you, can you write inside the YouTube chat?"
"5896170","5902990"," If you can't, can you right now send me your, because what I think is that you didn't read, read,"
"5903190","5903870"," and sign the rules."

"5906790","5913090"," So if you're in the Discord right now, Brad, if you go to the Discord and go to the Welcome"
"5913090","5918720"," Channel, let me see the Welcome Channel here. "

"6005470","6006870"," Says you're a member here."
"6009350","6010310"," He had no role. "
"6011270","6012570"," Thank you, Blind Nestle."
"6012690","6013450"," I appreciate it, brother."
"6015510","6017790"," I appreciate that, uh, Blind Nestle. "

"6049780","6052920"," And just type, Hey, everybody, something like that."
"6053020","6053560"," How's everybody doing?"
"6053940","6054600"," Introduce yourself."

"6125670","6126030"," I'm over here."
"6126210","6126950"," I'm over here ranting. "
"6127650","6128970"," I just took them off earlier."
"6129650","6131630"," I don't even want to look at what they're worth right now."
"6131890","6133410"," I'm afraid to look at them. "
"6134090","6134530"," Fuck."
"6138970","6140970"," They're up 300% right now."
"6146050","6146910"," Fuck me. "
"6152110","6157590"," Oh, I want to cry right now."
"6164470","6166990"," Oh, so I couldn't settle them yesterday in the bell."
"6167190","6168290"," I'm like, well, not the bell. "
"6168290","6170050"," I was in the phone with Winky."
"6170530","6171950"," And I wasn't paying attention."
"6172370","6174710"," And he's like, you should have sold those four forties. "
"6174870","6175930"," And I'm like, no, I added some."
"6176230","6178310"," I mean, I got puts and calls for the whole week."
"6178430","6179310"," I don't care which way we go. "
"6179590","6180250"," Up or down."
"6180410","6180970"," I don't give a fuck."
"6182830","6184570"," And I sold them down here. "
"6184810","6186470"," I sold them somewhere like right here."
"6189750","6191710"," Right here, right here somewhere here."

"6348250","6349690"," I am horrible sometimes."
"6349690","6350570"," I'm trying to fit. "
"6350770","6354910"," Sometimes I read these names and it's like the interplay on them."
"6355030","6355530"," I'm like, all right."
"6355730","6356850"," So what does this one mean over here?"
"6357450","6358910"," We just crashed the plane. "
"6361730","6364210"," Kisham followed Shikuni followed."
"6364210","6365910"," So if I'm messing up your name, I apologize."
"6367630","6369210"," Z Holy croissant. "
"6370390","6371710"," Right in it down on everybody."
"6377090","6378590"," G Daddy God."
"6385230","6385970"," Hi Michelle. "
"6387390","6388730"," Good morning, Mr. driver."
"6391570","6392470"," What's up with AMD?"
"6393890","6395170"," Let's look at AMD in the background here."
"6395250","6397090"," I'll tell you if it's anything different to the rest of the tech. "
"6399850","6401170"," Oh, AMD nice."
"6401330","6402250"," Nice shout out on AMD."
"6403170","6404230"," Oh, yeah, dude. "
"6404330","6406930"," AMD is getting primed right now."
"6408590","6409430"," Primed on AMD."
"6415890","6417470"," Nice shout out on AMD. "
"6417650","6417970"," Good alpha."
"6419750","6422110"," Always like hearing good alpha in the chat."
"6423130","6424070"," Great question. "
"6428940","6433620"," When a ticker is not following the rest of the market, what is happening to it?"
"6433620","6436420"," It is super bullish."
"6438640","6440540"," And it's almost ready, isn't it?"
"6443380","6444500"," It's almost there."
"6446740","6452440"," I want to buy 114.84. That's what I want to buy. "
"6452740","6454260"," Do I think we're going to buy 118?"
"6455660","6458740"," Do I think I'm going to get that deal down there, 114.84?"
"6459880","6461060"," Probably not."
"6461060","6464800"," Now there is a little bit of rolling going on an AMD."
"6465180","6472400"," It looks like if I had to guess we're cycling out of AMD and we're cycling or we're rotating into"
"6472400","6473260"," a different stock. "
"6473540","6481000"," So personally, I'm looking for a dip-eye at 114.72. That's what I want."
"6482820","6487420"," I want something like that."
"6487700","6490060"," I want like that little bit of capitulation down here. "
"6490860","6494260"," And then I want that consolidation and then that leg higher on it."
"6494680","6497280"," I want that hourly to come down and scoop it up."
"6500240","6502480"," So what am I looking for on it?"
"6508000","6515420"," I'm looking for consolidation between 114.72. 123.23. And if you're like, well cap fuck you, I"
"6515420","6516160"," don't want to go that low. "
"6516480","6516900"," I hate you."
"6518620","6519780"," I can understand that."
"6520920","6527460"," So I'll give you a second thing to tell you. "
"6527660","6531700"," If the dip is bought right now, right where we are."
"6533620","6535620"," If the dip is bought, I wouldn't buy it."
"6535800","6539600"," But if you see the dip bought here being right, you see that dip get bought?"
"6540920","6547600"," This hourly come down and you could see a squeeze here. "
"6547600","6547960"," Right?"
"6548160","6549560"," You'll close this up right here."
"6550900","6554340"," And you're going to look for the consolidation right here for the next leg higher."
"6555220","6555840"," Right there. "
"6556400","6557680"," So there's two trades here."
"6558120","6559700"," There's like, watch the dip-eye."
"6560940","6561340"," Watch. "
"6564980","6565980"," Show it to you right here."
"6578840","6579940"," Watch the dip-eye."
"6580040","6583220"," I'll give you the, you can see the dip being bought right now. "
"6583340","6585160"," The rotation into a nice green bar right here."
"6585540","6585840"," See that?"
"6585840","6592560"," You want to get above the 27 and the 129 EMA for the 30 EMA, excuse me, 30 EMA and"
"6592560","6593340"," the 129 EMA."
"6594240","6595700"," There's a trade for you. "
"6598640","6600080"," There's a trade for you here."
"6603590","6606910"," The trade is ready for the trade."
"6607930","6616950"," If price gets above 12334, you can trade it from here to right about here. "
"6618650","6624870"," 12334 to 124.97. This hourly here might be able to pick you up and run you higher."
"6626530","6627870"," So I'll show you the trade."
"6632030","6633930"," I think you're consolidating in here. "
"6634590","6636170"," I don't think you're actually going up."
"6637670","6638890"," But here are your levels."
"6639370","6641290"," It's like for 123 to 124. "
"6643070","6646790"," I think by the time you get there, the green is coming, going to come down."
"6646790","6648890"," This is end of the day right here."
"6650490","6653250"," But I think you're going to ultimately get rolled over here. "
"6653710","6657210"," Like you got a trade here right here."
"6657710","6659530"," But I think you're not done to the downside."
"6660290","6662250"," So I think you're going down. "
"6662750","6664390"," I think that is what's happening."
"6665390","6673310"," And I think you're going down until this 114 right here."
"6673310","6676690"," So I think you're in a rotation trade right now. "
"6679790","6681730"," You've got a rotation trade down here."
"6685270","6686050"," That's what I think."
"6686650","6688030"," You're in this kind of a trade right here. "
"6689990","6692650"," Okay, now I can be wrong on this."
"6695550","6697830"," And I'm going to chart it for you, okay?"
"6700110","6701610"," You can take a snapshot of this."
"6708010","6709870"," I make that green, okay?"
"6710810","6713110"," So just like this is an hourly trend to the upside. "
"6714070","6718290"," I agree that you can stay bullish."
"6719870","6723650"," I agree that you can stay bullish even on the hourly."
"6724430","6736420"," Even if the, so you"
"6736420","6737900"," can snap this right here, okay?"
"6742390","6746470"," Any kind of rejection below this green right here. "
"6746470","6747950"," That I have put here for you."
"6748050","6750330"," Any kind of rejection below that, you're going to see new lows."
"6751030","6751730"," I promise you. "
"6752530","6755230"," I see the hot, the low here, and I see the higher low right here."
"6755390","6761030"," But I assure you that if any point you start rejecting this stuff, you're going to keep revisiting"
"6761030","6762090"," this stuff down here, okay?"
"6762790","6767690"," So if you want that trade to the upside on an AMD, here's your first leg."
"6768510","6770150"," Give a rejection point right here. "
"6770270","6771270"," I should have done that right there."
"6771770","6772430"," There's your first rejection."
"6776050","6779110"," There's your second rejection right there. "
"6788750","6789870"," So there's your first one."
"6790270","6791110"," There's your second one."
"6791370","6791870"," And then boom. "
"6792170","6794130"," You have one other back here you got to worry about."
"6797450","6800230"," You got one more right there and you got one more right here."
"6801590","6802350"," Just that one. "
"6805940","6807900"," So maybe there's one more zag over here."
"6808020","6808660"," One more zigzag."
"6809520","6812640"," Here you can take a snip of this if you want. "
"6814680","6817860"," Your stops are right here."
"6824240","6826260"," And I would be looking to buy this."
"6826700","6827520"," Make sure I get that right. "
"6827740","6828260"," Jeff's right there."
"6830980","6832880"," You're looking to buy any of this stuff down here."
"6833020","6835420"," This line down here, you're looking to buy that line. "
"6838960","6844780"," Yeah, Winky's telling me they're buying, they're selling AMD and they're buying INTC."
"6845660","6847400"," That was an old trade of ours, right?"
"6851160","6855200"," INTC was still cheap where AMD was overpriced."
"6858260","6859180"," So there you go. "
"6859280","6861600"," There's a trade boom right there and snip that."
"6862260","6862880"," Let's do it."
"6863080","6863920"," Pause the program. "
"6865120","6866060"," And there you go."
"6874350","6875930"," Oh, we hanging."
"6876250","6877150"," What are we doing up there?"
"6877350","6878230"," What's that dog?"
"6878470","6878690"," What up?"
"6879970","6881090"," What's going on with that?"
"6889650","6891190"," We hanging Dong up there?"
"6891190","6911730"," Oh, man. "
"6963070","6967180"," The build thing, isn't it?"
"6978090","7006870"," Let's"
"7079000","7080200"," do it."
"7080860","7087200"," Nobody home by D-Y-A-L-L-A."
"7119760","7122080"," I love seeing that big old. "
"7122080","7123100"," Oh, man."
"7125120","7126180"," Oh,"
"7148730","7158230"," man."
"7172850","7180430"," Oh,"
"7197710","7217130"," man. "
"7280150","7281870"," All right, that's enough for me for today."
"7283930","7285590"," I don't need to do this anymore."
"7287970","7288850"," Oh, man. "
"7294470","7295530"," Can't do it anymore."
"7303030","7316870"," That was"
"7316870","7317990"," ridiculous, wasn't it?"
"7318170","7318730"," Look at that shit."
"7318930","7319990"," That's just like, woof. "
"7325810","7326970"," Whoa, turn that off."
"7328350","7329410"," Okay, I'll be back."
"7331610","7332710"," We'll be back with you. "
"7332770","7333150"," I know you guys."
"7333530","7335410"," Sometimes people are like, why is he late this morning?"
"7335410","7336130"," The market's selling."
"7336490","7337510"," I can't be here. "
"7338510","7340330"," I can, but I can't always be here."
"7340430","7341330"," I know it's great right now."
"7341590","7341970"," I have a bunch. "
"7342170","7343810"," My phone is blowing up like crazy."
"7344830","7345850"," I have to take these calls."
"7346430","7347710"," I have to get ready for tomorrow. "
"7347710","7350370"," The morning, congratulations if you rode this all the way up."
"7350670","7352850"," If you rode this all the way up here, congratulations."
"7353710","7358150"," 441-37, 441-03, nice target. "
"7358850","7360910"," Do you want to know if we're going up from here or not?"
"7361030","7362550"," You don't know if we're going up from here or not."
"7362710","7364790"," It's the same rules as always, right?"
"7365290","7367390"," Same rules from as always."
"7368670","7374350"," If price can get above the five minute trigger here, we will smash through this. "
"7375370","7377490"," If you see that happen, we're rock and roll."
"7377810","7381890"," I do want you to know that as the day moves forward, we will check previous lows."
"7382450","7384750"," We have another checkbox right down here. "
"7385050","7386030"," I'll give it to you right now."
"7386610","7388510"," There's one more target right down here."
"7388550","7391850"," If we can come back down here, you're probably like, please don't leave me behind. "
"7392570","7394650"," I'll put it on a five minute chart to make it easy."
"7398110","7399910"," It's right down here."
"7400090","7404310"," If we come back and check it, you're looking for a dip-eye at 439-23. "
"7404970","7407330"," You should be long to the upside."
"7407530","7409310"," We're not done here going up, believe it or not."
"7411070","7413310"," We are trending on the 6 CMA. "
"7418370","7419430"," Turn that green."
"7419750","7421230"," Hopefully you can get in here and try this."
"7422490","7423390"," Party down on this. "
"7423590","7425290"," Matter of fact, I got to change it again today, don't I?"
"7426750","7427790"," Back to the 27."
"7434140","7434540"," Done."
"7444910","7447190"," R3-445-08. "
"7450390","7453230"," If you're just tuning in, watch us from the beginning of the show."
"7453390","7456810"," We went through all this in the beginning this morning, and we had a little chat about it."
"7464180","7465320"," Am I doing wrong here?"
"7471400","7473800"," Look at that little T right there. "
"7474220","7474780"," Hello, sexy."
"7490050","7491470"," God damn beautiful thing."
"7510270","7514650"," All right, so I will be back here with you in just a little bit more. "
"7519270","7526400"," All right, I'll be back."
"7529440","7533180"," Yeah, I switched it to 27 from 30 to 27."
"7848350","7855630"," According to Freddie Mac, US 30-year fixed rate mortgage is 6.69% on June 15, the week, versus"
"7855630","7857730"," 6.71% for the prior week. "
"7860500","7862500"," All right, I'm going to stop in with you right now."
"7862720","7864340"," One of my favorite things to do."
"7864640","7866620"," The average 6.1% out of June. "
"7866720","7870300"," People think that I'm not going to be here with you, and then people leave the stream, right?"
"7870440","7871120"," They're like, it's all over."
"7871200","7871680"," I'm out of here."
"7872220","7874540"," So I have an attentive audience in the background. "
"7875200","7877120"," I got another pick for you right now."
"7878240","7879560"," You guys ready for it?"
"7880100","7881080"," Who's ready for a pick?"
"7881980","7884180"," I got another pick for you right now."
"7885320","7887580"," It's called Regeneron. "
"7887980","7889520"," I'm talking about Regeneron."
"7889920","7891880"," Talking about ripping some faces off."
"7892560","7895760"," R-E-G-N, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. "
"7897320","7899820"," Five trigger bull cluster."
"7901060","7902320"," Daily, crossing the weekly."
"7902940","7903620"," Price above the hourly. "
"7904120","7906460"," If you can even get in on this, I don't know if you can or can't."
"7906640","7907900"," It's trading right now $780."
"7909040","7910840"," Price is above the one minute, the five minute. "
"7911060","7916020"," As long as we stay above the one and the five, which you have at home on your own trading"
"7916020","7917020"," software, right?"
"7917520","7920540"," You've got price right now above the one and five minute."
"7920540","7924340"," Trade is alive on that trade all the way up to 791."
"7924860","7934600"," If price breaks below $777.56, you are going to look for a dip buy below at $770 for"
"7934600","7935880"," continuation to the upside. "
"7936720","7940920"," If you're a trader that's like, oh, cap, I was buying the absolute fucking dip."
"7940920","7950820"," Your next dip buy below that is 755.87. We've got 766.72. 756 in some change."
"7951800","7955600"," 757.76. And then we're looking for a target to the upside at minimum. "
"7956700","7960040"," 793.78. And we're going to go attack some shit on this trade."
"7960700","7961760"," R-E-G-N."
"7962180","7963240"," What do we want out of it?"
"7963420","7967380"," We want to rip faces off and take out 809 in change. "
"7968180","7969760"," Then we want to get up there and we want to tag."
"7969760","7971300"," What do we want to tag after that?"
"7971440","7973580"," We want to get ramped there at 898."
"7975000","7978540"," And then we've got the big bad boy to the upside. "
"7979180","7981520"," We've got all time highs on it."
"7982320","7983560"," Way up there."
"7983840","7984080"," Boom. "
"7984800","7988460"," 837.87. It's moving right now as we speak."

"7991620","7993820"," If it gets the roll, listen closely here."
"7993920","7995280"," If you're like, yeah, I don't like chasing a shit cap."
"7995660","7996240"," I get it. "
"7996740","8003780"," Remember, down below 766.95. And then we've got 756.33 to the downside."
"8004640","8007060"," So right here, be like, yeah, I'm going to try to buy that dip cap down here."
"8007720","8009080"," And you know what I'm going to do, Cap?"
"8009220","8010920"," I'm going to put a little bit of stops there. "
"8011040","8014160"," And just in case it rolls back over, which I'm going to tell you right now, it's fucking not."
"8014660","8016180"," This shit is going to move."
"8016800","8018600"," Okay, so right here. "
"8018720","8019020"," Right there."
"8019180","8022740"," This week's announcement is a patient of causing rate hikes by the Federal Reserve."
"8023400","8025120"," Put that as a red. "
"8025820","8030920"," Put that as a red down there as long as price stays above right where it is right here."
"8031400","8040020"," So right now, price is trading 780.64. As long as price does not get below currently 777.99. Price"
"8040020","8045040"," target to the upside, 793, believe it or not, 793 to the upside."
"8045300","8049400"," It's a little long of a tooth right now, but if we can get a gorgeous little like, and I'd"

"8115290","8116710"," Just starting to get bullish."
"8117410","8119390"," It's a little long in the tooth right now in the early."
"8119650","8122650"," You can see it's a little long in the tooth here, but see this one down here. "
"8123170","8124330"," See that one right there?"
"8124610","8125010"," That yellow?"
"8125470","8125830"," Forget the green."
"8125970","8128470"," The green's going to come back down a little bit of a pullback coming on it."
"8129130","8129210"," Right?"
"8129410","8130890"," But then that pie is going to come in. "

"8145690","8148910"," up, it's going to grab you and rip your face off."

"8189330","8190530"," Does this look familiar to you?"
"8190570","8191850"," Does this look like Budweiser, maybe?"
"8191850","8193910"," Does that look like Budweiser?"
"8194350","8195410"," Looks like it doesn't it?"
"8195969","8197930"," Stopped hitting lows over here."
"8198270","8199389"," Stopped going down here."
"8199629","8200910"," Started getting higher lows. "

"9753600","9757360"," If you do not see a new high, which you are not in that five-minute candle."
"9757640","9759360"," You see the failure to make a new high here."
"9759840","9763900"," It is now 12.32. We are likely going to come down here and test. "
"9764620","9768440"," 4.40.02. Pay a very close attention right here right now."
"9769180","9774280"," They do have a couple more minutes, not always exactly on the half hour, but be wary here."
"9775040","9778960"," We could come back down and test this white line right here. "
"9778960","9786660"," If we start to get underneath it, we could even trade all of this back down here to give all"
"9786660","9791980"," of this back and trade 4.37.91. To pay a very close attention to where we are in the"
"9791980","9792680"," market right now."
"9792780","9796340"," There's a failure currently to get a new high at 12.30 in the afternoon."

"9890340","9893500"," right now talking about the tool with one of the devs. "
"9894580","9897500"," If you don't see me chatting into the microphone."

"10442810","10444390"," You're on those zero dates with me."
"10444510","10444930"," Congratulations."
"10445310","10446010"," You're making more money. "
"10451960","10453540"," Go right in that supply zone."
"10453700","10455240"," You see that big red bar up there?"
"10456220","10457140"," This one right here."
"10457220","10459160"," Be very careful of this one right here. "
"10459320","10461160"," That 537 number right there."
"10462740","10466300"," It's going to be an instant sell."

"10518920","10521540"," Remember these are from the five minute, not the one minute. "
"10521800","10523920"," So just be conscious of these boxes down here."
"10532260","10534740"," We have left the gap down below right here."
"10556390","10557670"," Look at that, baby. "
"10561510","10562050"," Hells."
"10562150","10565270"," Yeah, 441.18. Woo hoo."
"10576730","10578350"," Right back to another few minutes. "
"10578490","10580110"," We got to do some more stuff in the background here."
"10610690","10615630"," So according to sources, ECB policy makers discarded a move on corridor this week."
"10616010","10617690"," See no decision in July. "
"10617690","10619210"," ECB policymakers begin."
"10619450","10625150"," ACB policy makers apologies begin a debate on the evening out the evening out the interest rate"
"10625150","10625410"," corridor."
"10628910","10634270"," According to sources, ECB policymakers see the topic of rates corridor gaining relevance later this"
"10634270","10634510"," year. "
"10700570","10704830"," I also wanted to make a note to you guys out there that if you look here."
"10704950","10708890"," You pay attention close to."
"10712810","10715170"," Right here, this is your support right here, right?"
"10715310","10717230"," You can see this on book map. "
"10719310","10721810"," You can see this big support right here, right?"
"10722950","10730230"," So that is going to be translating to as this yellow box on your 27 EMA right here, right?"
"10731410","10733750"," You don't want to see if this holds or not."
"10735850","10738270"," And we'll find out right now if this holds."
"10739190","10740890"," So if we start to begin to roll. "
"10742130","10745550"," I want you to be aware that there is a gap down below down here."
"10745610","10747770"," If you keep your eyes down here, there's a gap down here."
"10747830","10750590"," It's not showing up on a five minute chart, but it is down here. "
"10752070","10754470"," From pre market, we just left it behind."
"10757390","10760450"," You want to see if this holds and consolidates."
"10761230","10765170"," I don't know if you get a consolidation in here. "
"10765850","10768730"," It makes you don't do this big roll down here, any of that kind of nonsense."
"10769650","10770210"," Into the close."
"10771610","10773810"," I'm sure you guys are scared about that. "
"10774310","10776250"," Still haven't hit the previous high."
"10776530","10781210"," So we've got, I haven't really checked to see what the actual number is."
"10781610","10786130"," But 441 18 is pretty fucking close to 441 37. "
"10787350","10789030"," There's another note here too."
"10789030","10796990"," If you look at yesterday's high, you know, bears are looking for a lot of secondary."
"10797350","10803710"," Not bears, but like sellers, technicians, you know, they're looking for. "
"10804630","10806950"," So this morning, I made a post and I said."
"10807590","10808290"," I said."
"10814020","10817640"," So this morning, I said on I woke up this morning and I was like. "
"10818740","10820520"," When I say this morning, I'm into it."
"10820620","10820900"," I said."
"10823180","10824440"," Was like drink coffee. "
"10826620","10828140"," And I said, good morning."
"10829180","10831780"," Figured I'd wake up to Chipper Bears this morning."
"10832440","10833580"," Looks like they're not Chipper. "
"10834360","10834900"," Sips coffee."
"10835900","10839100"," And then I said, we checking the previous lows and high today."
"10840460","10842480"," And that's kind of what we did here, right?"
"10843640","10845800"," We checked previous lows this morning. "
"10845800","10847800"," We had previous lows from yesterday."
"10848800","10850400"," We checked them again this morning."
"10850800","10851020"," Bam. "
"10851340","10852400"," And what we were told."
"10852600","10854820"," We were told, nope, buyers are stepping in, right?"
"10855040","10855740"," They stepped in here."
"10856060","10857460"," They stepped in here again. "
"10858220","10859480"," And we're going to go back and check."
"10860800","10863620"," The previous high from yesterday, right right there."
"10864520","10867340"," Find out if there are actually sellers here, right?"
"10867560","10868480"," Are the sellers still there?"
"10868700","10869080"," Are they not?"
"10869300","10869560"," What do we do?"
"10870200","10871380"," We blasted through. "
"10872740","10873940"," This now became support."
"10874800","10877000"," And we begin to make our way higher, right?"
"10877600","10879620"," That's what we're doing right now, right in here, right?"
"10882200","10886300"," And you know that technical traders out there, you know that people out there."
"10888340","10890300"," From yesterday's from what happened yesterday. "
"10890760","10894340"," If you don't, you may or may not know this, but I want you to know this."
"10894940","10897380"," That pretend none of this happened today, right?"
"10899060","10901040"," That's why I mean that post this morning is."
"10902160","10906320"," Traders from yesterday, longtime traders are looking for. "
"10906820","10910000"," You get your high, you come down and break below the hourly, right?"
"10911260","10914860"," And technical traders are looking for a rejection or rejection of the downside."
"10915560","10916400"," Didn't get that, right?"
"10917100","10918300"," You can see it right here."
"10919340","10919580"," Right?"
"10919720","10920360"," They didn't get it, right?"
"10920620","10921320"," Sellers didn't get. "
"10921540","10923220"," They didn't get to stay below the green box."
"10924480","10929120"," And when they tried once more today, they didn't get the rejection to the downside, right?"
"10929120","10931260"," This is all bad for sell side."
"10932260","10933960"," But another key point is here. "
"10934900","10940680"," When we didn't go down, we come back up and sellers are looking for two key things."
"10941560","10943600"," They're looking for rejection here to the downside."
"10944680","10947140"," And they're also looking for a failure right here. "
"10947700","10950000"," They're looking for, hey, we're going down right here."
"10950120","10953920"," This is kind of like the setup for a second day, right?"
"10954460","10958380"," You've got your high, you've got your failure to make a new high."
"10959120","10962140"," And then we start to check new lows to the downside, right?"
"10962340","10966020"," So these are all things that traders are looking for. "
"10966180","10968900"," What does all of this mean, right, for the future?"
"10969200","10975720"," And so when you see something like today here, right, they're not even giving time for a"
"10975720","10976840"," consolidation, are they?"
"10977600","10983840"," Fuck the sideways trade, fuck the rechecken, fuck the rejection of the downside, right?"
"10983960","10985200"," We're not rejecting the downside."
"10986480","10988340"," Next up is the sideways trade."
"10989100","10991300"," And in one day, took one day to consolidate. "
"10992440","10993760"," One fucking day, not even a day."
"10994500","10996280"," Took the open, right?"
"10997560","10998500"," We came right into the open."
"10998660","11001500"," We said, so we got three things we're looking for, right?"
"11002260","11003220"," We're looking for three things. "
"11003500","11005820"," I know traders last night, we're looking for some key things."
"11006340","11007840"," I was talking about them in the close, right?"
"11009820","11012120"," Did we get the rejection here to the downside?"
"11012700","11012720"," Nope."
"11012960","11014600"," Did we get the rejection to the trend?"
"11014600","11015140"," Nope. "
"11015540","11016740"," We woke up this morning."
"11016840","11017760"," It was down, right?"
"11017980","11018600"," Ooh, it's down."
"11019160","11020300"," What happens up here?"
"11020540","11021300"," Did we get the rejection?"
"11022380","11022580"," Two. "
"11023340","11023460"," Down."
"11024260","11024320"," Nope."
"11024920","11026300"," What we did was we started squeezing. "
"11026600","11027780"," You got one, two, three cluster."
"11028180","11028780"," We started squeezing."
"11029000","11030140"," So they've got a three-trick cluster here. "
"11030600","11033120"," And we weren't selling the open here, right?"
"11033260","11034500"," We're not selling the open down here."
"11034600","11035520"," That's bad news, right?"
"11035860","11037060"," You saw right here on trend."
"11037380","11037800"," It got bought. "
"11038220","11039060"," We had buyers here."
"11039940","11044720"," So the next thing you are looking for as a trader is, did we have a failure?"
"11046040","11047420"," And we did not, did we?"
"11047560","11050440"," We got up there and we said, fuck you, we're out of here, right?"
"11051040","11057180"," So when you see stuff like this here, it's telling you that we're very fucking bullish, isn't it?"
"11057720","11061700"," It's telling you that we're trading a new zone, right?"
"11062600","11064540"," We've got $4.39, $4.40 up here."
"11064660","11065180"," Well, kind of. "
"11065620","11066900"," Kind of trading a new zone."
"11066900","11069020"," We got the yellow box from earlier we talked about."
"11069460","11071400"," We talked about the red box above it. "
"11072100","11074040"," After you started the show today, right?"
"11074400","11076340"," I was like, hey, you got this box up here."
"11076840","11078180"," This is the red box, right?"
"11079640","11082580"," Well, as I get this big red box, get the yellow box, get the red box."
"11083520","11086840"," And we just went straight up to the top of it, bam, slamming down. "
"11087740","11091800"," And so the question becomes, you're looking at book map now, right?"
"11092000","11094660"," Now you're looking at book map and you're saying, well, what is that right there?"
"11094660","11097260"," And they're saying to you, no, no, no, no."
"11097400","11097800"," You know what?"
"11098260","11099080"," We broke above."
"11100280","11105720"," We're going to make a new level here and find out, is this the new bottom?"
"11106440","11107920"," You're so bullish down here. "
"11108060","11108960"," We're going to come up here."
"11109440","11110720"," Are we now trading from this?"
"11111120","11113600"," So this turns into a big old fat green right here."
"11116080","11116960"," That makes sense. "
"11117260","11118600"," We don't want to lose this here."
"11120200","11122400"," We don't want to lose that there anymore, do we?"
"11122740","11124200"," And you can see it right here."
"11127060","11128020"," It's right there. "
"11128200","11129120"," We don't want to break this."
"11129280","11131380"," If we break this, there isn't much below it."
"11131740","11132460"," We need to see that. "
"11134420","11136660"," Not too much below it is there, right?"
"11137360","11140820"," Your next stop is way down here, right?"
"11144280","11147960"," So we're going to keep our eyes on this green box right here."
"11150280","11151600"," We don't want to break this."
"11151980","11152900"," If you're a bully, you don't. "
"11152900","11158080"," It doesn't matter if you consolidate in here, but you do not want to see a rug pull, do you?"
"11158360","11161760"," If they pull this rug right here, they're like, whoop, it's gone."
"11162820","11164620"," We're going to start trading to the downside."
"11165020","11168800"," We're going to start, come down here, check this stuff, start doing this stuff. "
"11169340","11173420"," We'll start blasting all the way down, at least to this level right here, okay?"
"11174340","11175320"," You can see it down there."
"11175460","11177140"," 44, what is that?"
"11179340","11181220"," 44, 35, right?"
"11181620","11182580"," It's way down here."
"11182720","11183940"," It's like way, way down here. "
"11184320","11186660"," So if you're a sell side, it's getting there."
"11186820","11188160"," You're on a seller right now."
"11188660","11189140"," It's getting there. "
"11189200","11192880"," It's not quite there yet, but you're going to keep your eye on this right here."
"11194380","11195840"," Can't wait to keep your eye on that."
"11196460","11198200"," I want to keep you to keep your eye right. "
"11198360","11199980"," There's a giant trade in here."
"11200740","11203260"," Like there's a giant down move like right here."
"11203820","11204060"," Bam. "
"11205220","11207120"," So we'll see if they pull the rug or not."
"11208980","11211100"," There's probably, you can see it's late in the afternoon."
"11211360","11213560"," It's 1256, probably a cocaine lunchtime. "
"11214180","11216920"," Hookers and models, models and bottles, whatever you want to call it."
"11217560","11222120"," And we're going to look to see if this holds or if they pull the rug up here and you"
"11222120","11222440"," are not."
"11223000","11224980"," Keep our eyes on this. "
"11225100","11229820"," If you're looking for this trade to the downside, there's a really nice fat trade here for you to"
"11229820","11230240"," go lower."
"11231060","11231820"," Nice room in here."
"11231820","11233440"," You see how big that room is in there?"
"11233560","11238700"," Big like a rubber band being stretched between the one minute and the 129 here. "
"11239060","11241240"," That's a big money trade to the downside."
"11242180","11246560"," I'm sure sellers are looking at it because all sellers need to do is get down here underneath."
"11247440","11247560"," Right?"
"11247720","11249140"," It's bam, right to the downside. "
"11249660","11249920"," Bloodbath."
"11250680","11252280"," So keep your eyes on that trade to the downside."
"11253640","11255020"," You've got 438 here. "
"11255740","11258140"," It probably translates well to 435."
"11261200","11262700"," And look at those puts."
"11262980","11263460"," They're so cheap. "
"11263620","11265180"," They're 4 cents right there."
"11265840","11268420"," 4 pennies to the downside to 435."
"11269740","11272080"," 438 are 10 cents right now. "
"11272220","11273360"," They're dirt cheap to 10 cents."
"11273560","11275140"," They cost nothing."
"11276060","11277700"," They don't cost anything right now. "
"11277920","11282180"," So we'll see if that works itself out or not."
"11283000","11286400"," If they don't rug pull this, look at the screen right here."
"11286400","11289440"," If they don't rug pull this, we're going to continue higher. "
"11289680","11293100"," I assure you, they start to keep buying this right here."
"11293760","11293960"," Right?"
"11294580","11297040"," We will tag that previous high at 441."
"11297680","11303800"," And we will likely even tag our two above at 442.08. Right there. "
"11304000","11312160"," Next target above after 441.37 is 442.08. Not bad, huh?"
"11313160","11314240"," Pretty good day."
"11317320","11318880"," You see that beautiful right?"
"11319020","11320360"," That nice support right here."
"11320660","11321900"," Gorgeous support right there. "
"11323100","11324540"," Got some more supply here."
"11324640","11326260"," Some more supply opening up to the upside."
"11327060","11327880"," That's 444. "
"11332440","11333320"," 4465, baby."
"11334480","11335500"," You know what that is?"
"11335580","11337120"," You want to know what 4465 is?"
"11337340","11338040"," I'm going to show it to you."
"11343340","11344220"," Right there. "
"11344220","11345280"," 443 here."
"11345540","11346540"," And I have higher numbers."
"11346840","11348880"," I got like 450s, 460s. "
"11349760","11352480"," Sometimes I flash them on you, but sometimes I don't."
"11352580","11353400"," So try not to be an asshole."
"11355020","11357480"," I see you do have more upside targets here. "
"11358320","11363400"," You got 443, 23, 445.08. There is some supply up there."
"11363600","11364740"," You can see it right there."
"11365500","11367920"," You can see this is likely R2 right here. "
"11369080","11370480"," Very close to R2."
"11370600","11371580"," This is R3 up here."
"11377200","11380240"," We're going to change this to previous eye. "
"11381960","11383160"," Previous eye 2022."
"11383900","11385240"," Maybe we'll just drop two of them."
"11385460","11386300"," Maybe we can copy these. "
"11386960","11387600"," Can I copy it?"
"11387880","11387960"," Nope."
"11388820","11389700"," We'll just draw it again."
"11391000","11392860"," Previous eye, previous eye. "
"11407800","11409540"," Previous eye, previous eye 2022."
"11410220","11413780"," If you want to take that trade to the downside, you know exactly what to be looking for."
"11413780","11415300"," You should be a pro at this point at that. "
"11415880","11416100"," Right?"
"11416380","11418160"," You got the price right here."
"11419080","11421920"," You would be wanting to watch for this right here."
"11422000","11422780"," You'd watch for a failure. "
"11427540","11429180"," You'd see a couple green bars."
"11431260","11433320"," Bip, bip, bip."
"11433860","11435300"," You'd see the failure right here. "
"11437720","11439220"," You'd set up the trade to the downside."
"11440880","11442600"," Your first bar right there."
"11443360","11445040"," You'd take that trade right there. "
"11445140","11446080"," That's where you take that trade."
"11446940","11449040"," And you would capture all of that move right there."
"11450080","11452120"," We're not seeing that right now, are we?"
"11452900","11454980"," So you're going to watch this happen here. "
"11455740","11458620"," Watch the suck up her breath."
"11458660","11463240"," If it reverses to the downside, you set the trade up and then you jump on it and you get"
"11463240","11464060"," your trade to the downside."
"11464580","11467920"," Until that happens, there's no trade for a seller. "
"11467920","11469820"," Right now the move is still the upside."
"11470140","11472160"," We're still trading above the five minute trigger."
"11472540","11476380"," We're trading above the six EMA on the five minute chart. "
"11484980","11487300"," Yeah, I'm going to bet here."
"11487600","11489400"," So this morning, I haven't thought about that."
"11489500","11489980"," Who said that?"
"11490040","11490560"," He has 12. "
"11490800","11499900"," I haven't thought about that yet this morning, but I, my thought this morning was that call, my"
"11499900","11505420"," thought this morning was that theta gang was going to come out and throw some condors on and some"
"11505420","11513040"," condors on or some flies and just let this shit ride out into end of month."
"11513040","11513800"," That was my thought."
"11514180","11521320"," The only risk that I saw here for option sellers was of expiration. "
"11521740","11527460"," I was like, yeah, you know, like day before day after expiration, they might have some risk."
"11528600","11530880"," I think it probably would probably put a trade on."
"11531880","11533760"," But, you know, there's other fear here too. "
"11533920","11535420"," Like Thursdays, we usually have an update."
"11536020","11537580"," Statistically, we have an update on Thursdays."
"11538180","11542700"," If we don't get an update on Thursdays, it goes to like an 85% chance of an update on"
"11542700","11542980"," Friday. "
"11543880","11546240"," You guys, we talk about that in stream, right?"
"11547540","11549080"," Thursdays are usually an update."
"11550400","11556800"," If we don't get the Thursday update, we tend to like, let's take an 85% chance on Friday that"
"11556800","11557180"," we get it."
"11557180","11560760"," And then you've got the expiration risk next week. "
"11561460","11563260"," What day is of expiration, by the way?"
"11563400","11564280"," I need the exact date."
"11564940","11566020"," I didn't haven't looked at it yet."
"11566220","11566960"," I haven't done some. "
"11567160","11570340"," I've been so busy that I haven't been able to look up."
"11572700","11573680"," Up X States."
"11575740","11576680"," Up X calendar. "
"11581500","11583200"," What's anybody know the expiration date?"
"11583320","11584940"," I haven't looked at it."
"11595330","11597130"," Fixed expiration calendar."
"11597990","11599040"," We've got 2023. "
"11600530","11603650"," It is on June 21st."
"11603750","11604590"," So mark that on your calendars."
"11605550","11607070"," We've got June 21. "
"11609450","11611050"," 21st of June, 2023."
"11611270","11612890"," So you've got volatility on that day."
"11614390","11615970"," So maybe this is your high target. "
"11616290","11617710"," Maybe if you're a call."
"11617890","11620910"," If you're a call seller, put seller."
"11621450","11622690"," You're looking to put on a."
"11623630","11626010"," Any guys out there trying to put on a trade for that. "
"11626910","11628410"," You still believe in that trade."
"11628850","11632230"," Maybe this is the high side of your butterfly and the downside of your butterfly."
"11633210","11634470"," Is for Vickspiration. "
"11635550","11639370"," So that we I know we have all on that or leading into it the day after that kind of"
"11639370","11639550"," stuff."
"11641230","11642230"," What's that Wednesday?"
"11642890","11646490"," So we have Wednesday Vickspiration and then we got a day off on Monday."
"11647370","11649090"," So there's a good opportunity there for. "
"11649650","11650830"," Theta gang over the weekend."
"11651610","11654470"," And then you've got the Wednesday volatility, Thursday volatility."
"11655930","11658050"," But maybe the theta gang is like fuck this. "
"11658230","11658890"," I'm not doing shit."
"11659690","11661490"," Like if I was theta gang, I used to be theta gang."
"11662050","11664570"," If I was theta gang and I saw that today, I'd be like fuck that. "
"11664710","11665150"," I'm out of here."
"11666070","11668610"," I'd be like has 12 makes a good point."
"11668710","11670330"," If I was fucking theta gang, I'd be like fuck this. "
"11670470","11671730"," I'm going to wait until this shit's done."
"11677010","11678270"," Who wrote that?"
"11678470","11679790"," Who wrote that in the stream?"
"11681470","11682630"," E-PES 12."
"11685210","11688690"," E-PES 12 making a very good market insight right there. "
"11689590","11690870"," Let me know if you're theta gang."
"11691130","11691890"," Are you like fuck this."
"11692090","11693170"," I'm not doing any of this shit. "
"11693450","11697590"," Or are you like, is this your high target on your butterflies?"
"11698110","11700470"," Are you going to put a fly on here and hope to get one down below?"
"11704850","11706610"," I honestly don't know."
"11706930","11708850"," I used to trade theta."
"11709090","11712150"," Or I used to be a call and put salary in. "
"11714030","11717350"," Days like this, like past few weeks."
"11718250","11722150"," This is like when you're a theta gang, it's like that's just theta gang."
"11722270","11723310"," Like complex trading gang. "
"11724050","11726990"," You get like nine kick ass trades and one of these trades."
"11727670","11728950"," You're getting a phone call."
"11729730","11731110"," You're like hello?"
"11733490","11734590"," You're like fuck. "
"11738690","11742550"," I used to have a bunch of jokes about theta gang."
"11742950","11744230"," I got them all written down actually."
"11744410","11747790"," I used to post them and then I'd save them and repost them and shit. "
"11754270","11756130"," Yeah, you're going to be getting to run the hell over."
"11756550","11760270"," If you're selling options and anything, I shouldn't be saying just theta gang."
"11760270","11767290"," If you're selling calls or puts or whatever, like you're probably getting the hurt put on you. "
"11771050","11773330"," Like can you imagine being a call seller right now?"
"11774090","11779330"," Like imagine just being a call seller and you own the fucking spy right now and you're like fuck"
"11779330","11779730"," me."
"11779990","11780770"," I got to sell these."
"11781150","11783850"," I got to sell all the underlying and now I'm stuck. "
"11784550","11787630"," And this is kind of fucked up because it drives the market higher, right?"
"11787850","11788510"," Now you own it."
"11792510","11794930"," I always like different kinds of theta gangs."
"11796070","11801830"," People that try to sell, so you have more, you have higher likelihood of selling option, of making"
"11801830","11806110"," money, selling options than you do on buying options. "
"11806630","11809850"," Like buying options, they tend to go to zero."
"11812590","11817890"," Your profit is unlimited except for your profit on call side is unlimited."
"11818410","11822230"," Your profit is finite on the put side but spy would have to go to zero. "
"11823750","11825990"," But call sellers, put sellers."
"11826710","11835010"," If you trade like a bull call spread or a bear put spread, you're still an option seller."
"11836230","11840410"," Theta gang though likes to, when they get really smart, people are like, I'm really smart. "
"11840610","11841150"," I'm a smart guy."
"11841810","11843130"," I love managing a trade."
"11843770","11847510"," They will try to capture a space that you can trade in. "
"11848170","11851470"," So just pretend you have like the number one, I don't think the number 10 to 20."
"11853090","11858030"," And you have a very high probability that, let's say the price is at $15."
"11859850","11866590"," And this stock ticker is believed to do one or two Sigma moves. "
"11867250","11873650"," And one or two Sigma moves on this ticker is no less than $10 and no more than 20."
"11874290","11876910"," And they haven't done that in nine months a year."
"11877990","11886550"," So you could sell outside the money calls, outside the money puts at $5 and at $20. "
"11886550","11889890"," And so there's a trader in there, right?"
"11890170","11894210"," And the guy like me is like, okay, I'm going to buy 16 C."
"11895690","11898750"," And there's someone there's someone buying the underlying, right?"
"11898930","11901770"," They're like a guy comes out or a woman comes out and she goes, it's $15."
"11902610","11905930"," I think that I want to own this at $15, right?"
"11906250","11907270"," So they're buying the underlying."
"11907790","11911190"," I'm a guy that wants to buy a 16 C call. "
"11912330","11914990"," There's someone else out there that owns the stock."
"11914990","11918590"," They own that stock for $15 and they want to make some money."
"11918970","11920970"," So they're like, okay, I own this stock. "
"11921290","11923530"," It doesn't make me a ton of money."
"11923550","11926850"," It goes up really slow, goes up really down really slow over time."
"11927370","11934210"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to sell calls and puts against it to generate profit, right?"
"11934370","11935850"," So like I own this underlying stock. "
"11936030","11937850"," It moves slowly to the right up and down."
"11938270","11939710"," And I'm going to generate some profits."
"11939710","11942970"," So I'm going to sell some calls in the upside and I'm going to sell some puts to the downside. "
"11944050","11945810"," And I'm going to generate cash flow."
"11946330","11950010"," And what happens is I'm selling those puts or calls, whatever I'm doing."
"11950590","11951910"," Let's say I'm selling calls on it, right?"
"11954010","11955390"," So I'm going to take a bunch of money. "
"11955650","11960850"," If we don't close above $20, I get all that money for selling that call."
"11962310","11963830"," It's keep all that money, put it in my pocket."
"11964170","11968810"," I own the underlying, still I'm safe, generating cash flow for myself on this tick of the trade"
"11968810","11969290"," sideways. "
"11970470","11972570"," If we go above, right?"
"11973250","11977410"," If we go above that, that $20, they sold that $20 call."
"11978190","11986690"," I am exposed to selling the underlying at $15, right?"
"11986830","11988930"," Or paying out a pocket to keep it."
"11989510","11992910"," I could keep them, I guess, and pay the cash, but nobody does that. "
"11993670","11994790"," I missed the move, right?"
"11995010","11997650"," I lost $5 if I hadn't sold the call."
"11997650","11999290"," But I made a bunch of profit."
"11999470","12001450"," So in this case, I would have lost money, right?"
"12002990","12005930"," I didn't actually get to $15 to $20. "
"12007970","12008790"," Does that make sense?"
"12010550","12012530"," Same thing goes for the downside, right?"
"12012990","12016470"," If I'm selling puts against the ticker, I can be on the hook for that money, right?"
"12017310","12019350"," Same thing goes for the person that's selling the ticker."
"12019370","12022990"," I have to cough up some money for that difference, right?"
"12023110","12025250"," You get a phone call, you owe me some money."
"12030360","12032620"," Yeah, you can buy a hundred shares of something. "
"12032940","12035820"," There's also something called a poor man's cover call."
"12036260","12038260"," It's also known as a synthetic long."
"12039000","12044360"," You can do synthetic longs pretending that you're owning the underlying as well. "
"12045420","12049240"," There are people in our Discord that discuss these concepts for you."
"12049440","12055240"," And there are other people that are selling and buying calls and puts on the up and down side for"
"12055240","12057380"," that same, trying to capture that same profit as well."
"12059280","12060740"," So those are butterflies. "
"12061760","12062920"," Then they have broken wing butterflies."
"12063940","12066980"," You can sell butterflies, buy butterflies, buy and sell butterflies."
"12067360","12071100"," You can do condors, iron corn, condors, that kind of stuff. "
"12073200","12075980"," Oh, look at these sellers up here."
"12077660","12078460"," Ooh, I got some puts."
"12080540","12081880"," I got some puts. "
"12081880","12083540"," I got some 438s."
"12084680","12086340"," I got 438s."
"12087180","12088460"," Let's see if I'm up on them. "
"12088680","12089180"," Oh, wait a minute."
"12089480","12090020"," I just fucked up."
"12105610","12106050"," Good. "
"12106390","12107150"," Oh, it's taking here."
"12107810","12108830"," Just turned off my brokerage."
"12114490","12115490"," See what I got here. "
"12142330","12145330"," I bought a 438P for 11 cents."
"12153950","12155550"," And they're back to flat right now."
"12156670","12158370"," They're up just a little bit there for a minute. "
"12162930","12163370"," 438Ps."
"12163790","12165410"," Looking for this tag target down below."
"12165690","12166410"," You shouldn't buy these. "
"12166990","12170290"," You should be waiting for some confirmation."
"12170310","12171290"," This is a lot of shit."
"12172030","12174850"," This is all like I made a lot of fucking money here. "
"12177990","12179470"," I'm gambling right now."
"12181050","12182290"," I'm at the casino here."
"12183090","12183830"," Don't do what I do. "
"12187870","12188770"," Fitzy, what up, brother?"
"12190390","12191150"," What up, dough?"
"12198840","12199780"," Two are one."
"12200460","12203040"," A little bit of a roll."
"12203240","12203660"," We're checking. "
"12204180","12206640"," We're checking the five minute twenty-seven EMA right now."
"12210630","12211870"," Fuck around and find out time."
"12215090","12219010"," So every day we come into the day and it's like, Whoo!"
"12219210","12219650"," My calls. "
"12220030","12222930"," And then we come into the end of the day and we're like, Okay, here's the bear's time."
"12223390","12224950"," No follow through yet for the bears."
"12225190","12226610"," Yesterday we got some follow through. "
"12227390","12228590"," But not much, right?"
"12228790","12231950"," So we'll look to see if the bears can take a trip lower here."
"12232610","12233870"," We'll set it up for them."
"12234750","12238150"," You guys want to go to a one minute chart so we can get it nasty into the tick?"
"12238810","12239550"," There it is. "
"12240470","12242650"," Let's see if the sellers can take it down here."
"12243170","12246770"," This is the target right here, 438 to the downside."
"12246770","12249990"," We do have some kind of a bear plane forming. "
"12251090","12254230"," See if the sellers can take over here and try to run this down."
"12254650","12256310"," We've got R1 right here."
"12256830","12259270"," We have this yellow one right here is from yesterday. "
"12259990","12262410"," I believe this was the high from yesterday."
"12263410","12264650"," See a few of these things."
"12264950","12266250"," If the sellers can take over here. "
"12266930","12266990"," Nope."
"12268710","12269970"," Previous high from yesterday."
"12270270","12273090"," We're at all the stuff in so you guys know what all these places are. "
"12273710","12274850"," Previous high from yesterday."
"12284080","12287740"," If you are a seller here, you want to be getting underneath the green bar."
"12288080","12289420"," Not be above the green bar. "
"12289660","12291320"," You want to see a rejection candle, right?"
"12291500","12292840"," You want to see a red bar down here."
"12294260","12298160"," You want to see a green bar up."
"12300120","12302540"," You want to see a rejection bar to the downside. "
"12304580","12305940"," Bloodbath down there, right?"
"12306820","12308920"," We've got another one right here to do with that."
"12308980","12310500"," That would be a green bar, right?"
"12310840","12311840"," Suck it back up here."
"12312100","12313120"," Then come back down here. "
"12313220","12313960"," Get underneath here."
"12314280","12315740"," And then your big trade is down there."
"12318200","12319880"," This is the money trade right here. "
"12320340","12322820"," I don't know if we're getting down here."
"12325360","12328540"," The easier way to trade this is on a 5-minute chart."
"12329580","12330500"," Right there. "
"12330840","12331140"," Get underneath."
"12332880","12333620"," Right here."

"12334740","12336660"," This is the money trade right here."
"12338560","12340120"," Big fat money trade."
"12341260","12346160"," I do want you to warn you that bears have had no success. "
"12346640","12348340"," I feel bad for bears here."
"12349000","12350480"," Like they're getting fucking crushed."
"12351220","12352340"," They're getting fucking crushed. "
"12353520","12354040"," You're a seller."
"12355820","12358140"," No joy for sellers right now."
"12361810","12363470"," Absolutely no joy for sellers. "
"12370300","12372320"," Should I write follow through price target?"
"12372620","12373300"," I mean, I can't even write."
"12373500","12377720"," Normally, if we were a normal market, I'd be like, if we were a normal market, this would be PT "
"12377720","12378460","-1 right here."
"12379880","12381400"," Like we were going right there. "
"12383220","12383660"," Guaranteed."

"15611930","15615010"," I'm on the track of what we're talking about here in the background."
"15615570","15617570"," Okay, hourly trigger. "
"15618510","15622670"," I made a post on trade the trigger this morning, letting you know that if we break up above it"
"15624290","15630370"," and confirm the trade higher with a one-minute, five-minute and an hourly trigger, it's a three "
"15630370","15631450","-trigger cluster, right?"
"15631450","15635710"," And we will blast off from there in a bull market."
"15636030","15637010"," What did we do this morning?"
"15638010","15640570"," We ripped faces off and then we kept confirming."
"15640930","15644890"," This is a one-minute chart right now, but we confirmed it here in a five-minute chart earlier. "
"15645170","15646210"," You can see it right here."
"15646890","15648630"," Three-trigger bull cluster down here."
"15649290","15654810"," Slammed it higher, came back down, tested again, slammed it, tested again, tested again, right?"
"15655990","15659090"," So you might be thinking, it's all over, Captain. "
"15659090","15661490"," And I'm like, fuck, no, it's not."
"15661870","15663130"," It's not fucking over."
"15663470","15671970"," The hourly trigger is now above at 4.38. It is now climbed higher here. "
"15673130","15674990"," You have R3 above."
"15675510","15677770"," You might think to yourself, we're done here, Cap."
"15678290","15682170"," And I'm like, nope, the hourly is chasing you higher right now. "
"15682370","15685610"," It's literally, it's straight vertical right now."
"15686290","15687870"," It's a green vertical line."
"15687870","15692630"," I'm going to show it to you on another chart in the background so you can see it. "
"15693310","15699070"," And when that green line is vertical, when we represent this green line right here, it is going"
"15699070","15700890"," straight fucking vertical right now."
"15701110","15702790"," It's not sideways, not at an angle."
"15703170","15706230"," It is fucking vertical to the upside. "
"15706650","15708190"," And it is fucking blasting."
"15709790","15711470"," What is happening right now?"
"15711690","15712010"," Do you know?"
"15712890","15717050"," It's just like Cathy Woods getting herself a margin call."
"15717690","15723930"," We are going to rip some fucking faces off and rip out every single asshole's stops. "
"15724670","15726190"," So where do we have stops above?"
"15726950","15729350"," We got stops here at 4.43, right?"
"15729950","15732630"," We know that these stops are from 2022."
"15733650","15740110"," Remember earlier when we showed that big fat orange bar that came out down here and we said, this"
"15740110","15741290"," has to hold, right?"
"15742190","15744430"," We have that happening once again, right?"
"15744710","15745190"," Remember back here?"
"15745190","15745950"," Look back here."
"15746350","15747870"," Remember back here in time?"
"15748270","15751670"," We had that big orange bar come out, the invisible hand, right?"
"15752690","15754490"," What's going on again right now?"
"15754550","15755250"," Do you guys see it?"
"15756250","15762530"," We have another invisible hand creating another bar down below. "
"15762710","15763930"," Remember that green bar that I drew?"
"15764490","15765570"," And I was like right here, man."
"15765710","15766870"," They're right fucking here, right?"
"15767590","15769390"," I told you that the hourly trigger is coming up."
"15769750","15772970"," And I'm telling you right now, they're right here holding this market up. "
"15772970","15774810"," I want to show you some stuff."
"15775270","15779270"," You've got previous high margin calls, baby."
"15780030","15783030"," If you don't, if you don't, if you don't close those, right?"
"15783250","15784170"," You're going to get a phone call. "
"15785090","15787670"," Hello, Mr. Eiken."
"15788490","15789870"," This is Mrs. Eiken."
"15790730","15791970"," Is Mr. Eiken there?"
"15792590","15793770"," I don't know, Mr. Eiken. "
"15794550","15797330"," And you're like, uh, listen, lady."
"15804930","15807310"," So right here, you've got some shorts."
"15807590","15813270"," There's some fat white guy sitting here in New York, and he's like motherfuckers. "
"15815010","15818990"," And this guy is not going to get caught with his pants down."
"15819250","15821810"," He is afraid of smashing up here."
"15822850","15824670"," And he's going to pull that short off. "
"15824670","15827530"," So we've got R3, R2, R3."
"15827710","15829830"," We've got, oh, you've got 448."
"15831510","15834270"," You've got 450 right here. "
"15835030","15837530"," These are more previous highs to the upside."
"15838010","15841490"," You've got 450, 04, 448, 66."
"15842730","15844870"," You've got R3 at 445, 08. "
"15845650","15847730"," You've got this previous high from 2022."
"15849530","15851130"," And you've got Valhalla, baby."
"15851750","15852510"," You've got it. "
"15864330","15866430"," So we are going up."
"15866650","15871250"," We are closing out all of the stops above."
"15873630","15876370"," We got the spy, baby. "
"15877230","15878430"," We got the spy."
"15880910","15882490"," We got the spy."
"15882490","15882870"," We got the spy here. "
"15882930","15884250"," You're getting a roll on AMD."
"15885010","15892350"," That's where that close above usually gets seller step in there and AMD trying to close that gap."
"15892490","15897050"," You should have closed and re-entered after that anyways on AMD. "
"15897470","15898670"," You saw the top tick there."
"15898870","15904190"," You're trying to close the gap on AMD from back on June 15th, I'm assuming."
"15904550","15907150"," They're going to come in like sellers, like locusts. "
"15907150","15910270"," There are people that are trapped and they're like, just get me out of the trade, man."
"15910410","15911190"," Just get me out of the trade."
"15912170","15916010"," So right now, R2 tagged almost to the pin, baby. "
"15916530","15918130"," Look at that right there."
"15918350","15919170"," 442, 08."
"15919370","15921030"," We tagged 442, 02. "
"15922190","15923030"," We've got buyers."
"15924430","15925670"," Invisible hand right here."
"15926370","15927690"," Sitting here, 441, 03. "
"15928590","15929170"," They're going nowhere."
"15929530","15930470"," Same as earlier."
"15931550","15933090"," Same as this one right here, right?"
"15933730","15937090"," You're going to watch the pullback to check if we're going higher. "
"15937650","15938930"," Come on up in here."
"15939170","15939610"," Come down."
"15939870","15940790"," Check the 5-minute. "
"15941250","15948070"," If the visible hand doesn't disappear, we will continue higher and take out our 3."
"15948550","15955350"," Now, with all that said, if they pull the rug here and you get the reversal, what are you looking"
"15955350","15955770"," for?"
"15955870","15956990"," I'm going to say it again to you."
"15957530","15959850"," I'm going to show it to you in real time."
"15960630","15963530"," You are looking for red candles down here. "
"15964210","15964730"," Bam, bam, bam."
"15964730","15967410"," You're going to look for green candles right here."
"15968550","15969730"," Bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"15969970","15973870"," And then you're going to look for red candles right here."
"15974290","15975130"," Bap, bap, bap, bap."
"15975270","15977530"," You don't enter the trade until you get underneath. "
"15978710","15981350"," We know the stops are right here."
"15981810","15983210"," So, stops right there, right?"
"15983710","15988390"," So, you know right now you know that the stops, right?"
"15988570","15989670"," He's in a second time."
"15990170","15993190"," You know that the sell side stops are right here. "
"15997330","15998130"," Seller stops."
"16000370","16002030"," Right there, we'll put that in yellow."
"16002710","16006570"," And we know we got a drop blast out of these stops right there. "
"16006770","16007630"," So, there's your seller stops."
"16008410","16011610"," We're going to go back down here, check to make sure we still have fires, right?"
"16011970","16013150"," We're going to try to squeeze it down below."
"16013390","16015610"," If we take it down below, we're going to concentrate this. "
"16016370","16021670"," Start breaking to the upside and then bam, you take out these stops and rip some faces off to the"
"16021670","16022350"," upside, right?"
"16022350","16024070"," Pretty easy, pretty standard."
"16024590","16026750"," You know when to close your stops, you know when to take along."
"16027330","16029850"," It's now 2.16 in the afternoon. "
"16030510","16033090"," Sellers, no relief for sellers here."
"16033730","16033910"," None."
"16035310","16040510"," Big question here too is even if we roll this, even if we roll this, I want to show you"
"16040510","16040970"," guys something. "
"16042030","16043650"," It's now 2.16 in the afternoon."
"16047130","16048450"," 15 minute chart."
"16050110","16051330"," Way back here. "
"16051450","16052190"," You see that trend?"
"16055250","16056870"," Doggy, boom, bought it."
"16058830","16061110"," Ripping faces off right there, right?"
"16061450","16062450"," So, what are we looking at now?"
"16062730","16063530"," We're going to extend."
"16065170","16065650"," Trend. "
"16066490","16068030"," And what do we see here?"
"16069650","16070670"," What do we see here?"
"16070770","16071190"," We see it."
"16071290","16074530"," Same thing we talk about every day in the closed yesterday."
"16074530","16077930"," So, we get above that fucking thing, watch out, right?"
"16078450","16079750"," And what are we looking at for tomorrow?"
"16079750","16086550"," If we roll this down here tomorrow, we go bam, leaving if we do this, right?"
"16086990","16089450"," They're going to try to rip your faces off again. "
"16090210","16097350"," Take out the next set of highs at 448, 450 for tomorrow."
"16098570","16099530"," That's their plan."
"16100310","16102230"," Again, same kind of shit, right?"
"16102230","16103090"," Cell side. "
"16103430","16106390"," Trying to get under just the 1 in 5 minute, man."
"16106950","16108590"," Trying to get under the hourly."
"16108870","16111570"," And not only that, get some rejection going, right?"
"16112110","16114170"," Get down here to get some rejection. "
"16114790","16122850"," Cell side, right now, currently, where we are in price, has no business unless they're below."
"16123170","16123570"," Ready for this?"
"16123830","16123950"," Shocker."
"16125570","16126130"," Truly. "
"16127150","16129990"," Right now at this moment, they have to sell below 436."
"16130590","16136270"," To even think about trend change on a 5 minute fucking chart."
"16138090","16139850"," 5 minute on an hourly chart. "
"16139930","16140970"," I'll get in that an hourly chart."
"16141110","16143490"," Anything below 436, seller's in charge."
"16144030","16150110"," Otherwise, as long as we hold the hourly, and as long as we recheck it, we are going to start"
"16150110","16151650"," ripping some fucking faces off. "
"16152570","16154510"," Unreal moves in the market."
"16155690","16159190"," Fintuit is going to be stunned right now."
"16159410","16161150"," Absolutely fucking stunned. "
"16162430","16162950"," Guaranteed."
"16163730","16165530"," Fintuit is a..."
"16165530","16167890"," It's got to be an animal house shit show in Fint."
"16168070","16168850"," I haven't been on Fintuit. "
"16169330","16171630"," I'm like shit posting, but I ain't reading anything on Fintuit."
"16172070","16173610"," I got a bunch of work I'm doing in the background."
"16174350","16177950"," But I'm positive that people are pissed on Fintuit. "
"16179010","16185850"," I told you yesterday, and I told you the day before, that you do not want..."
"16185850","16187330"," You want to have threatening J-Pow."
"16187490","16189810"," We're going to raise rates in the future."
"16190630","16192590"," You don't want J-Pow just pausing. "
"16193470","16196250"," That threat from J-Pow keeps this market alive."
"16196770","16197870"," Garen fucking teed."
"16198570","16200610"," You're seeing it right now, front run. "
"16201630","16205030"," Jerome Powell has not paused permanently."
"16205950","16210650"," You want J-Pow to be aggressive inside of his speech."
"16211270","16215050"," You want him to be inside the room saying, we're not pausing. "
"16215210","16216670"," We're not doing QE."
"16216930","16219590"," We're going to raise rates down the road, whatever that shit is."
"16220250","16222410"," And as long as he keeps that mantra, you're good. "
"16222710","16224790"," The moment he says to you, we are paused."
"16225010","16226090"," We're never raising rates again."
"16226770","16228110"," Watch the fuck out to the downside. "
"16228550","16230330"," You got a gift from J-Pow yesterday."
"16230590","16231630"," Congratulations, bulls."
"16232470","16234910"," He's keeping your market alive right now. "
"16237250","16238790"," The smell on Fint."
"16238930","16240990"," I haven't read anything on Fintuit."
"16241770","16245230"," So maybe I'll scroll through right now and see if people are saying on Fintuit. "
"16245790","16248330"," I've just been shitposting all throughout the day."
"16248510","16249910"," Oh yeah, there it is."
"16251710","16253070"," To the moon, baby. "
"16253730","16254430"," Diamond hands."
"16260630","16261550"," Diamond hands."
"16262910","16264210"," So there you go. "
"16264210","16266630"," And this that we ain't done here, I assure you."
"16266810","16269370"," That's a five minute chart, but this is the one you want right here."
"16269770","16271530"," This is the big, bad donkey right here. "
"16271670","16273750"," And you got more problems if you're a seller."
"16274430","16276070"," Right down here, this hourly trigger dude."
"16276250","16277510"," This shit is just vertical. "
"16277930","16279850"," I'll show you the, I want to show it to you in the background here."
"16280370","16283790"," I wish you guys are getting this tool like this week."
"16284330","16289290"," These fucking guys, these fucking full stack developers might have a tool to you buy this week. "
"16289790","16292870"," Like end of this week, you guys might have something to work with."
"16292870","16294550"," Like a beta test tool."
"16295570","16298710"," And I got a white paper I've been writing for you guys waiting till you get it. "
"16298790","16300370"," You're going to be fucking stoked."
"16301530","16303890"," So just right here, look at that test, right?"
"16304430","16305970"," We talked about this yesterday, right?"
"16306670","16306750"," Boom."
"16308670","16309390"," Whoo hoo. "
"16309790","16310710"," Top of the world, Ma."
"16312330","16315030"," 442, 443, staying on track to the upside."
"16316090","16318850"," We got, we got zig zag channels on that tool. "
"16318970","16319710"," It's so badass."
"16320210","16321250"," You're going to fucking love it."
"16321330","16322110"," You're going to make so much money. "
"16322790","16326730"," You're going to be reading the white paper for like three months and going, oh, this happens and"
"16326730","16328210"," that happens and that's what this is."
"16328650","16329950"," That's what a bull plane is."
"16330070","16331250"," That's what a bear plane is. "
"16331850","16333410"," Oh, look at all this craziness."
"16333610","16334950"," This is, you're getting a crash predictor."
"16335630","16339350"," So you can actually look at it for yourself and be like, no, like these guys saying we're crashing. "
"16339730","16340150"," We're not crashing."
"16340750","16341690"," Give me fucking phenomenal."
"16341930","16342750"," You're going to be fucking stoked. "
"16343490","16344490"," Sorry for swearing so much."
"16345110","16346810"," I'm just so pumped on this right now."
"16348330","16351530"," So right now, prices above the one and the five minute, right?"
"16351530","16353350"," Being defended on the one and five minute. "
"16353530","16355210"," Can we get one more squeeze to the upside?"
"16355490","16358170"," If you're a seller, you're looking for price to get underneath."
"16361690","16362610"," Right there."
"16363190","16364790"," You want to see red bars, baby. "
"16365470","16369130"," A green bar that can't get back up so you can come back down here and test this."
"16369270","16370330"," But look what's coming from underneath."
"16370930","16373130"," The big green shark is coming underneath. "
"16374510","16375730"," The giant move higher."
"16376570","16380150"," Yeah, we might get one day of consolidation."
"16384330","16386430"," You see the verticalness in that bar?"
"16386610","16387290"," Look at that verticalness. "
"16387509","16388730"," That thing is just straight vertical."
"16389050","16389430"," Look at it."
"16390130","16391869"," Look at that green bar. "
"16392110","16394930"," You see that green right there when that thing starts going like that?"
"16395169","16395730"," Not like this."
"16395950","16396310"," Not sideways."
"16397290","16398470"," Not at a kind of an angle. "
"16398630","16402509"," When it starts going like this, we're going to rip some fucking faces off."
"16402509","16405290"," It makes straight rip some faces off."
"16406330","16408770"," How much do $4.48 costs for tomorrow?"
"16409230","16410930"," Anybody know the price on those?"
"16412630","16415070"," The price on $4.48 for tomorrow. "
"16416869","16418029"," Maybe the 20th."
"16418950","16419750"," Oh, yeah, tomorrow."
"16420090","16420890"," One more day left, right?"
"16421090","16422369"," What are $4.20 costs right now?"
"16423290","16424210"," $4.48, excuse me. "
"16424890","16425990"," What are those bad boys costs?"
"16426310","16426770"," Holy shit."
"16426910","16427550"," They're already up."
"16428169","16428990"," $0.10 already. "
"16429310","16430490"," Dealers are like, go fuck yourself."
"16430710","16431070"," They're not a penny."
"16434070","16436369"," Usually in a day like say, they'd be like one penny. "
"16436610","16438189"," Dealers are like, they're 10 cents, bro."
"16438390","16439930"," They're 10 fucking cents."
"16440890","16442070"," You're not making 5,000%. "
"16446849","16447950"," Dealers learning here."
"16450270","16451610"," Dealers are like, oh shit."
"16453830","16457169"," Some guy on the phone going, calling the dealers going, dude, what are you doing?"
"16457369","16459270"," We're following the entire trade. "
"16459270","16460689"," We're buying the market with them."
"16465849","16467390"," Like a big old shark."
"16472650","16474529"," You saw that post this morning. "
"16474730","16477590"," I retweeted it for you on Captain Jim James."
"16477950","16480270"," I said, blinders on."
"16480750","16481950"," Put your blinders on. "
"16482890","16484570"," Don't be following fin twists."
"16485029","16487310"," Follow Captain Jim James at all times."

"18953740","18954180"," Okay. "
"18954340","18955280"," So let's see what's going on."
"18955400","18956500"," I got to get back to what I'm doing here."
"18959460","18960980"," We have a reversal candle. "
"18964920","18965480"," Stay focused."
"18965740","18967280"," We're losing this right here right now, right?"
"18968000","18969980"," So this is going to be turning yellow here."
"18970620","18973520"," They're going to want to pull the rug out of us into the clothes here, right?"
"18973860","18974920"," Got some sellers coming in. "
"18975020","18977040"," They're all angry right here."
"18977040","18979680"," They don't like you."
"18979800","18980320"," We're going to come in. "
"18980440","18983380"," We're going to rain on the parade of the bulls and the buyers, right?"
"18984040","18985960"," So what are we going to look for down below?"
"18986260","18987340"," Same as usual, right?"
"18988320","18989700"," It's 3.05 in the afternoon."
"18989900","18990840"," We have one hour left."
"18991160","18994700"," We have a half an hour until 3.30. The hour is not over, right?"
"18995220","18996960"," So 3.30 is when the hour is over. "
"18998500","19000000"," So are we done here?"
"19000220","19000820"," That's the big question."
"19001040","19001480"," We've done cap."
"19001660","19002180"," I don't know cap. "
"19002360","19002580"," We've done."
"19002680","19003140"," I don't know cap."
"19003440","19004180"," Let's take a look. "
"19004540","19005420"," The time is this."
"19006160","19006700"," Oh, oh."
"19007440","19008120"," It's that right there. "
"19008940","19009840"," Time is that right there."
"19010960","19011360"," We've got the."
"19011540","19014280"," We've got going on here. "
"19015300","19016260"," We've got right there."
"19017260","19018340"," Ten past right there."
"19018340","19019420"," A little one minute. "
"19019560","19020320"," Let's see what's going on."
"19020660","19020880"," Let's see."
"19021800","19022460"," How am we going?"
"19023400","19024240"," 1458, right?"
"19024640","19025280"," 1,500. "
"19025960","19027520"," We've got a new high, right?"
"19027920","19028460"," Right there."
"19028540","19029020"," We've got a new high."
"19029280","19030600"," So are we done here so far?"
"19030720","19031300"," It's saying no. "
"19031960","19033260"," We've got a new high, man."
"19034100","19036520"," So we've got 14 minutes to make a new high."
"19036860","19038700"," 14 minutes to make a new high. "
"19038820","19040940"," So where do we buy a dip here?"
"19041180","19042140"," Is there a dip to buy?"
"19042680","19043380"," We don't know, right?"
"19044020","19045040"," We checked it down here."
"19045540","19046520"," Let me get the rings up for you."
"19047320","19048840"," We've got a nice big fat cross there. "
"19049160","19049180"," Boom."
"19049480","19049720"," Check it."
"19049860","19050680"," Grind, grind, grind. "
"19051080","19051780"," Go higher, right?"
"19052040","19052260"," Sellers."
"19052420","19052860"," Watch this."
"19053780","19055800"," Sellers doing the same thing right here, right?"
"19056660","19057500"," Grind it down. "
"19057700","19059500"," Grind it down and try to keep it under, right?"
"19059680","19060680"," So what are we looking for here?"
"19061540","19063380"," What do we know that we're looking for?"
"19063460","19064400"," You guys already know, right?"
"19064760","19065520"," Don't need me to tell you."
"19066040","19067200"," Get rid of this right here."
"19067840","19069660"," Sellers want to get underneath. "
"19070540","19070940"," Right?"
"19071380","19071940"," Get rid of that box."
"19072800","19073540"," They want to sell this."
"19074040","19075460"," They want to put..."
"19075460","19078720"," They want to get a quick little rip right here. "
"19079380","19082640"," And they're going to try to sell back down on you and check the five minute."
"19082740","19083760"," They're doing this all day, right?"
"19084280","19085880"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"19086240","19088700"," Check this five minute right here, right?"
"19088880","19089320"," 441. "
"19090460","19091840"," 88, right?"
"19092900","19093320"," 441."
"19093540","19093620"," 88."
"19096420","19096980"," Excuse me. "
"19097940","19100540"," Turn this down a little bit because my end..."
"19102680","19103300"," My end."
"19105220","19106300"," Damn, here's not working."
"19107820","19110960"," The one day that I'm like, yeah, I got a bunch of stuff I got to do in the background. "
"19112960","19115100"," I got a bunch of meetings and stuff I got to do."
"19115160","19119440"," I got a big show I got to do on a show tomorrow I got to do for the smart"
"19119440","19119860"," people."
"19120960","19121880"," Find out what they want. "
"19124340","19125660"," So right in here, right?"
"19125840","19127780"," See that red bars down below the five minute?"
"19128500","19129940"," Green bars coming up right now."
"19129940","19132600"," And these sellers need to hold this, right?"
"19133200","19140320"," So if you want to take the trade down to the 441.90, you need to first see a reversal"
"19140320","19140800"," candle."
"19141220","19142100"," So you set up your short. "
"19142360","19143780"," You're not going to hit the sell button yet."
"19143800","19145060"," You're just going to set it up."
"19145400","19151260"," If you see a red reversal right here, you know that you can take that short to the downside. "
"19152000","19154020"," 1, 2, 3, 4, 5."
"19154520","19159920"," But we already know, we already know that we won the 15 minutes."
"19159920","19163420"," At 3 o'clock, right?"
"19163560","19164900"," We already know we got the new high here."
"19165380","19167840"," So we know the bulls are going to have 15 minutes. "
"19168860","19170320"," To get a new high, right?"
"19170600","19171000"," Get a new high."
"19171080","19171980"," We have a new high right here."
"19172140","19173300"," Let's just snap it in. "
"19173860","19177260"," And you hear people on Fintuit say double top, right?"
"19177820","19178340"," Same thing."
"19178600","19180040"," I'm just in a five minute chart right here."
"19180380","19182520"," So you have bulls have one more chance. "
"19182940","19187260"," What they're going to do is they're going to take a chance to run this back up in the next"
"19187260","19188040"," 15 minutes."
"19188040","19190540"," If they do that, you can't mess with it, right?"
"19190760","19192960"," Being new high stops right there."
"19193380","19194240"," Bam, bam, bam. "
"19194620","19195080"," Up to the upside."
"19195420","19195680"," We go."
"19195860","19196460"," Do you get what I'm saying?"
"19197100","19199060"," So can you take a short here as a big question?"
"19199460","19200300"," Fuck no. "
"19200800","19201420"," Fuck no."
"19201620","19202500"," Not on a 1 minute chart."
"19202660","19203500"," Not on a 5 minute chart. "
"19203620","19204480"," You can't take one here."
"19204800","19205820"," This is the 6 CMA."
"19206120","19208740"," But on a 1 minute, it's the 27 EMA, right?"
"19208920","19210200"," See how that works for you?"
"19210560","19213800"," So right now we're holding the 6 CMA, right?"
"19214260","19215260"," On a 5 minute chart. "
"19216160","19217860"," That's that white line right there, right?"
"19217860","19218780"," So which way are we going?"
"19219060","19219520"," Up or down?"
"19220360","19221160"," We don't know yet."
"19221300","19227660"," But right now the sellers are losing 3.09, 6 more minutes for the bulls to get a new high."
"19228220","19230980"," 6 minutes for the bulls to get a new, bulls to get a new high. "
"19231560","19233080"," We're going to wait and see if they can do it."
"19234180","19236720"," I want you to also see these big red volume bars here."
"19237000","19238680"," 1, 2, 3, 4."
"19238980","19240260"," These are people taking profit. "
"19240760","19242480"," So they're going to try to sell this down on you."
"19242700","19245900"," If you want my honest opinion, from my honest opinion here, right?"
"19246580","19248840"," Seeing these red bars here kind of sketch me."
"19249420","19253100"," If I'm looking on a daily chart here, there's some pretty big sellers up here, aren't there?"
"19253500","19253980"," Who's that like?"
"19254060","19254780"," Is that Jamie Diamond?"
"19255380","19258620"," Is he back at JPM saying sell, sell, sell, sell, sell?"
"19259920","19260820"," Is that what he's doing?"
"19265540","19266620"," Sorry, making jokes. "
"19272300","19275400"," So right now we're going to be able to plan a trade to the downside, right?"
"19275400","19280060"," If you're a seller out there and you want to get this at least something in for the day, you're"
"19280060","19281340"," going to keep your eye right here, right?"
"19281800","19282720"," Keep your eye on it."
"19282760","19284700"," You're not quite there yet, but you're looking at it."
"19285580","19286720"," What time is it right now?"
"19286940","19287480"," It's like at the time. "
"19288400","19290700"," So I don't like seeing the big red bars right there."
"19290700","19291280"," They'll be honest with you."
"19291320","19295440"," But even so, it's 3.10. Bulls have five more minutes for a new high. "
"19295740","19296840"," We have five more minutes."
"19297020","19298380"," I'll tell you what, they get that new high."
"19299680","19301080"," We're going to the moon once more. "
"19301420","19302840"," So what are you going to look at here in the background?"
"19303240","19303660"," Let me take a look."
"19303660","19310520"," We got four forty-fives or eight cents, four forty-fours or twenty-four cents."
"19312360","19316120"," It's kind of a steep price in there trying to get me to buy some expensive calls. "
"19316300","19319000"," I don't think they're going to print those four forty-fives."
"19319120","19322600"," I think they're going to tell you they're going to print them and then they don't."
"19323320","19327220"," That's four forty-five or even if they do print it, they're not going to pay you, right?"
"19327820","19331820"," So you kind of have to be looking at this time of the day at something that's either for tomorrow"
"19331820","19336860"," or something that's closer in the money that they're actually going to pay, right?"
"19337020","19341720"," So you might get up there, but you're like twenty thirty delta calls might not actually print big"
"19341720","19341860"," money. "
"19342000","19343680"," Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't."
"19344200","19346860"," But the dealers here are like, we're not paying anybody else."
"19347060","19349480"," We'll make them eight cents when we get there, right?"
"19349680","19350640"," Some shit like that, right?"
"19350860","19355000"," They got these big computers in the background that are telling them maximize losses to these"
"19355000","19355720"," dirtbag bulls. "
"19356560","19360880"," Three twelve right now, three minutes here for the bulls to get a run higher."
"19360880","19363680"," So we can get an explosive move to the upside right now, couldn't we?"
"19363800","19364880"," You got just a couple minutes, right?"
"19365060","19365260"," Three minutes."
"19365800","19369360"," You could technically put a call on right now for the stop underneath it. "
"19369460","19373020"," The next three minutes, if that thing doesn't start green-barred up, you pull the plug on that"
"19373020","19373240"," trade."
"19373480","19374980"," Don't tell anybody I told you that."

"21022090","21028950"," but I don't know if we'll get there So just buy stops with uh 248 seems appropriate."
"21029590","21030950"," Can it have a major pullback?"
