"18700","19580"," Check one, two."
"24760","32400"," All right, so if you guys can see me out there, I'm just heads up."
"32560","33460"," I've got a thunderstorm. "
"33900","34660"," I walked outside."
"34920","36220"," I'm like, I want to go see what's going on outside."
"42440","53410"," So I'm just heads up that where I live, where"
"53410","53850"," I live. "
"54550","55510"," I'm having, I walked outside."
"55750","57370"," I'm like, is there construction going on outside?"
"58010","58410"," Well, I got side."
"58590","60050"," There's like a wall of black in the sky. "
"60830","64349"," So if you're tracking, if you're still with me right now, if you're tuning in real quick."
"65530","68950"," There's a, there's a high chance I'm going to lose power and internet."
"69570","70610"," It's like flashing. "
"70910","71550"," My lights are flashing."
"72030","72710"," My internet is flashing."
"74450","77450"," And more than likely I'm going to lose power at some point here. "
"77570","79470"," There's a massive thunderstorm coming through."
"80410","82890"," You're listening to trade the news."
"83130","83650"," Yeah, hold on here. "
"84110","85270"," Thanks for the trade, the news update."
"86610","87710"," Everything's coming back online."
"88530","89790"," Just, I promise, this isn't me. "
"93800","96120"," So we'll look real quick in case I lose you guys."
"96680","99480"," In case I lose you guys, I'm going to, in case I lose you guys."
"101560","107420"," If this, if it does shut off at some point, we're going to talk about the rest of the day. "
"107480","112820"," Okay, we're going to go over what, what my expectations are for the rest of the day in case we"
"112820","113800"," get lost here."
"114180","115620"," I want you to know two things."
"115760","115940"," Okay. "
"116840","118960"," I want you to know that there's volatility."
"121100","121960"," Right here, right?"
"122140","123660"," I want you to see this volatility, right?"
"123720","124680"," We broke above it, right?"
"124780","126620"," But I want you to see this right here specifically."
"127900","132480"," So these sellers, bears are going to try to step back in here, right?"
"133040","136900"," We know that there's, we know that these, there's sellers had a big red bar that we saw up here. "
"138000","139000"," And up in here, right?"
"140580","144000"," So just, just know that bears are going to start to reposition as we get up here."
"144760","149520"," Uh, know that we're still within our trading range to trade all at the 450."
"149560","151060"," We talked about that yesterday, right?"
"151400","153260"," Still in our trading range to even get up here. "
"153760","156100"," It's not abnormal for us to trade that high."
"156900","159340"," Don't feel like it is because it isn't on a larger timeframe."
"159400","164140"," You can see that, that we can easily trade up to 450. "
"164940","165340"," Right?"
"165500","167100"," We can easily break above here."
"168820","169880"," Just be aware of that."
"170020","173380"," I don't know that I expect that to happen, but what I do expect to happen. "
"173380","178840"," What I do expect to happen here is what my expectations are."
"179720","182060"," We have a small roll over at some points."
"182440","189940"," We trade higher, try to close above this 4, 4, 3, 5, 0 somewhere in here, creepy crawly up, let's"
"189940","190140"," say. "
"191360","193480"," And for for for futures."
"195900","197180"," I think we I think we squeeze higher."
"197940","202560"," Matter of fact, yeah, I think we squeeze higher and or even if we squeeze higher just slightly. "
"203360","207720"," And I think we're going to try to make try to make this close for Friday."
"209260","211220"," That's what that's what I thought right now is."
"211560","212320"," Do we get there?"
"212840","213500"," I can't tell you. "
"214860","219080"," Uh, but but I think that's going to be the attempt between now and Friday."
"219360","223160"," This is going to be the price target up here at 440 call that at 448 or so."
"223560","224540"," Just below 450. "
"225900","226700"," That's going to be the attempt."
"227380","231300"," I also think that you're going to see futures get bought tonight."
"231480","233180"," I said south futures, but I think they're going to buy them. "
"233560","234520"," No matter where we end up."
"234620","238040"," And if we if we trade down here to the bell, I still think futures get bought."
"238260","240300"," Okay, so no matter where we wind up, I think we get get bought. "
"241120","243860"," My price target right now is 450 or 448 or so."
"243920","244340"," Let's call it."
"244760","246620"," We know that 4, 4, 4, 47. "
"247760","250720"," If it takes us to get here tomorrow, if we squeeze up."
"252260","253900"," Tomorrow we could sell this right open."
"255180","258120"," If we only squeeze up to here, we could trade up to here and then sell down. "
"258480","262080"," This could also move higher to 450 or 448 tomorrow."
"263920","265220"," Just maybe aware of that."
"265520","268060"," If I lose you guys, I can actually smell the thunder outside. "
"270660","273440"," Right now, so we've got a huge thunderstorm in Detroit right now."
"273560","277940"," So if I had up losing you guys, that's my my thought and plan for today."
"277940","280520"," I don't think we sell down into Friday right now. "
"280580","281600"," I don't think that's on the."
"282540","286460"," I don't think that that's I don't think that doom and gloom is on the on the."
"288420","289560"," Docket right now could be. "
"290300","292440"," We could slide right down here into Opex."
"293280","294520"," That's the out of the side of the trade."
"294600","297300"," The bear trade is when do they actually load up. "
"297380","298320"," Do they load up right now?"
"298440","299260"," Do they load up higher?"
"300240","303140"," My thought process that though, I think Chase was talking about it earlier."
"304010","308020"," Was that puts get closed and hedging."
"308980","310860"," No, no need to hedge any longer. "
"311930","318280"," The market pushes this up regardless of what bulls want or bears want retail, at least."
"318700","321960"," So I think we do get that regimen all the way up here and tomorrow."
"322580","324680"," And then I would then I would say. "
"327100","330680"," It's tough to buy anything over this weekend."
"331700","334460"," I'll be with you guys tomorrow unless we have this nasty storm or something."
"335480","339520"," I should be here tomorrow, but if I'm not here tomorrow, whatever if this thunderstorm is worse"
"339520","340100"," than expected. "
"341400","347160"," It's tough buying calls or puts unless you're buying spreads because of the three day weekend in"
"347160","347660"," the theta burn."
"348080","351320"," And they'll tell them on Monday anything on Monday and then they'll start again."
"351820","354520"," Try to get your trade stuck wrapped up by this Friday. "
"355060","357920"," Take a nice long weekend and come back to it again on Monday."
"358600","365160"," There is some question to that we could start that downward move that heavy move down come Monday"
"365160","365600"," as well."
"366360","368980"," Just be conscious of that as well as as we trade forward. "
"371260","373740"," So at this point, I'm not going to take any trades."
"374040","377620"," We tagged 442.84. We talked about this 443."
"378360","381000"," I'm going to be looking for a dip by somewhere down in here. "
"381100","383000"," I'll be looking for another trade for the end of the day."
"383500","384340"," I'm going to clear this off."
"384740","386740"," I'm going to be looking for a dip by down in here. "
"387500","392020"," If I can catch something down here for an end of the day trade right down in this zone down"
"392020","393340"," here is what I'm looking for."
"393420","397180"," So if you're a bear and you're like, I want to get all bears and target that down there."
"397440","398320"," That's what that's your thing. "
"398500","401120"," I'm not I'm not willing to take the risk out as a bear right now."
"401440","405560"," I'm just trying to be greedy and just trying to buy a VWAP type of a trade higher."
"406600","408100"," I've made enough money today. "
"409240","411640"," This is another good point is you don't have to over trade, right?"
"411800","413080"," Tell bears this on the way down."
"413740","416200"," I'm always like you should have taken this part of the trade."
"417340","419540"," They're like, I want to stay in for that last little push. "
"419540","420340"," I understand that."
"420500","421480"," If you're a bull, I understand it."
"421960","422820"," Now they're moving up. "
"424540","429980"," But I'm going to be looking for, you know, some kind of a beautiful end of day banger to the"
"429980","430160"," close."
"430860","436240"," Now, if you want to trade this up, you can I'll leave this up so that so that you can"
"436240","438400"," continue this trade into end of day."
"438580","440760"," I'm not I'm not anti this trade going higher right here. "
"441840","448240"," I'm just looking at it from the looking at it from the, you know, the inter day doldrums, like just"
"448240","450160"," the inter day."
"450160","457720"," See the buyers are still here here indicated slightly negative, but the put the put regimen is"
"457720","460200"," being fucked around with my market makers."
"461160","462780"," You see these sellers up in here?"
"463540","464820"," They're coming down now. "
"465460","466500"," See him down in here?"
"470960","472060"," This is right in here."
"472440","474160"," I said 447 looks like the 447."
"475040","475960"," No, they're still up there. "
"476220","476680"," They're right up there."
"476880","477140"," 447."
"478860","481160"," You can see these sellers ganging up in here. "
"483760","490000"," It's between 445 and right where we are right now."
"490060","492700"," They're trying to try to get their push on right now."
"495520","497040"," They're last stand right in there. "
"498820","500120"," You can see him right there."
"501980","503540"," You see all this ice right here?"
"505180","506720"," I'm trying to tell you fuck no."
"518630","520230"," Let's keep your eyes peeled if you're a bull. "
"520970","524890"," If you're going to be like, you're looking for a place to buy a dip."
"525550","529210"," You're looking for 443, maybe 441."
"530890","532750"," Maybe even down here right here. "
"534390","534650"," Like 440."
"535110","535650"," Believe it or not."
"536610","537850"," It's no way that's happening. "
"538170","540770"," It doesn't always happen, but when it does happen, it pays."
"542290","544970"," So just keep your eyes peeled for a good dip by in here."
"545710","548510"," You know, we do these short coverings and we don't even get there right. "
"550350","553670"," We end up doing another one of these goofballs when we get up here to go on higher."
"553850","554550"," But this is a great trade."
"554750","555370"," This is a good trade. "
"555690","556310"," This is a good trade."
"556910","557790"," It's another good trade."
"560330","562350"," Consolidation, quick dip down, boom, move higher. "
"563770","568530"," So instead of buying a dip here, here, here, I'm going to look for that outside of consolidation"
"568530","569770"," range by to go higher."
"574410","575430"," That's the plan, Stan."
"588520","591320"," So you can determine interest in trading ranges. "
"591680","592160"," Yeah, sure."
"592440","593520"," So let's talk about that."
"595680","597640"," So I'm not, hold on. "
"597800","598880"," I can show you that."
"599700","600160"," Hold on."
"600420","600840"," Good question. "
"602580","603840"," So we'll do it here and we will."
"604500","604940"," Okay."
"605200","607400"," So this is like, you're not a new. "
"607540","614960"," So I trade up by the, I trade up my, I actively trade on tasty on a computer setup over"
"614960","615180"," here."
"616580","621500"," But if you're a new trader or even, even if you're like a long term trader, these are some of"
"621500","622820"," the fastest charts out there."
"623380","628900"," This is, you put this up against like Ninja trade, you put this up against, you name it. "
"628900","635120"," The only thing that I've got faster than this is, is book map that I pay a lot of money"
"635120","635600"," for, right?"
"635740","637480"," Probably a ton of money for book map."
"637920","640100"," Pay like fucking three or $500 a month."
"640280","645380"," Think of pay $500 a month in total for book map and the indicators that I have is like $500"
"645380","645960"," a month. "
"646100","648760"," That's what I pay to have book map information."
"649220","652780"," But if you want something free, believe it or not, these charts are fast."
"652960","654220"," You put these up against thinkorswim. "
"654220","657220"," Put these up against any other fucking weebo."
"657360","658440"," You put weebo up, believe it or not."
"658700","665300"," One thing they're good for is the information that's conveyed that those milliseconds actually do"
"665300","668200"," matter for executing a trade. "
"668940","674360"," So I really like watching my options chains."
"674800","683060"," My options chain on thinkorswim, but I'm going to show, I think I can, I can do this."
"683700","686800"," I thought I could show, there you go. "
"687720","690880"," But you can check out an options chain on weebo."
"691500","692200"," Let me see."
"693720","697800"," So this is, I'm just going to show you, this is the 13th for today. "
"698760","702860"," Depending upon which broker used the only show like 10 strikes."
"703960","707780"," And matter of fact, I think these are only showing, are these showing every strike?"
"708000","709740"," Some show every strike, some don't."
"709740","711020"," Like today, right?"
"711180","717320"," We're at 442 right now, 442. "
"718580","721320"," Yeah, this isn't the best to look at this on, is it?"
"721460","722180"," How do I make this higher?"
"723660","724660"," Can I make this higher?"
"726620","735390"," This isn't really the best, can I make this even higher?"
"739530","747470"," Yeah, this might not be the best, it might not be the best to be watching on."
"748170","749930"," This weebo might not be a good example."
"752770","753530"," But regardless. "
"755390","761110"," You see the open interest here on the right hand side, you see the volume over here right on these"
"761110","761410"," options."
"761970","767510"," What I'll try to do is, if I can shout something out to you, but let's say I shot the"
"767510","775910"," 4, this is the 4, I don't think I can highlight this or not, but this is the 443 that"
"775910","777350"," I've been trading all day long, right?"
"788510","793550"," And it's almost two strikes outside of the money, you can see 116,000 calls over there, you can see"
"793550","797730"," 96,000 one strike away, right?"
"797910","799130"," They're 67 cents currently."
"800090","805750"," And I'll usually just watch the price of these calls throughout the course of a day, I'll watch"
"805750","806650"," them rise and fall. "
"807350","811130"," I'll watch what they were worth this morning, because I'll know, I'll know that they're going to"
"811130","815470"," probably expire worth, not probably, but it's a high chance that calls expire worthless by today."
"816170","819610"," I'll watch to see if they're cool in here."
"820530","822130"," May I have to bring my options chain up?"
"825360","827420"," I can't stream this over there. "
"831730","835610"," Let me see if I can bring this up on another screener, give me just a second here."
"842840","845440"," You know, I've got a, hold on a second, I'm going to do a better job of this."
"845940","847200"," Fuck all this, we're going to start over. "
"848860","852640"," I'm going to try to do is I'm going to bring up what I, what I, how I watch."
"853660","854900"," I'm going to show you what I watch."
"857120","860540"," Isn't it weird how the market moves, how you think it's going to move before it happens?"
"861900","862180"," Kind of bizarre. "
"862560","863180"," Give me just a second here."
"863240","864480"," I'm going to bring up, I'm going to show you what I do."
"865620","866120"," It's a good question. "
"868420","872580"," Let me see if I can bring up, because I've got multiple accounts on Tasty."
"887970","889870"," I'll see what I, I'll see exactly what I watch."
"897580","900820"," Okay, so this is Tasty Works, okay?"
"902780","904700"," I've got it on spy right now, right?"
"904860","908620"," I can change to the 13th, and this is what I watch throughout the course of a day. "
"910860","916980"," So right now I'm trading, so within a few strikes, you can see how it says 142,000 over here."
"918380","923320"," Now that these puts have lost value all day long, and they've been buying these all day long."
"923500","924600"," They've been buying these all day long. "
"924920","926820"," Now, it's not impacting it as much today."
"926920","931560"," We already know that no matter how many puts are bought, that the market's going to go up because"
"931560","934260"," of covering, right?"
"934980","941260"," But I'll watch the strikes that I'm interested in through the course of the day, the rise and fall,"
"941500","941920"," their price."
"942240","949320"," We know this morning that 443s started out the day worth around 19 cents, 17 cents that started"
"949320","949720"," today. "
"950100","956780"," So I can already know that if anyone's in this trade since the open, that 19 cents should be about"
"956780","960060"," the next pain level for the first buyers of this from this morning, right?"
"960620","965840"," I also know that they're going to try to kill these options at some point today later on today."
"966200","971420"," I'm also looking for interest, like IV, like do the market makers think we're actually going to go"
"971420","971700"," to 435?"
"972260","973560"," They're showing two cents over here."
"973840","976200"," They're not given too much value to us hitting that, right?"
"976520","981440"," And I'm also watching to see if they're eating the value of these options the farther out and"
"981440","983480"," strike from where they're going to try to close the day at. "
"983700","986400"," I don't want to see you guys, but I'll watch these things."
"986400","990760"," You'll see these numbers pop up, like 140,000."
"991020","992680"," You'll see 200,000 pop up. "
"993000","994580"," You'll see them jump back and forth."
"994900","1000240"," Actually, Tasty will show you the high frequency traders jumping back and forth wherever they think"
"1000240","1001000"," the market's going."
"1001300","1007340"," It doesn't work 100% of the time, but when we are making moves in the market, oftentimes if you"
"1007340","1011180"," don't have like me telling you, hey, look, we're probably going to get a Vanna squeeze today. "
"1011540","1017080"," If we're not getting a Vanna squeeze, if we're directionally moving up or down, you'll actually see"
"1017080","1019820"," these bars raised and lower."
"1020000","1022140"," You'll see these bars over here, these purple bars."
"1022300","1026540"," They'll get bigger and smaller on both sides, depending upon the direction of the market. "
"1027460","1028880"," That's what I watch."
"1029380","1034560"," If I'm focused on a day, like I come in in the morning and get ready for my day, I"
"1034560","1037940"," will have a screener just onto the side."
"1038560","1043560"," I just watched the ebb and flow of the value of an option that I'm interested in the course of"
"1043560","1043760"," a day. "
"1044260","1051780"," I promise you, if you do that for a week, two months, three months, five months, six months, eight"
"1051780","1056900"," months, and you just start watching your options chain, your dailies, just your zero dates, one"
"1056900","1058140"," dates, or your next expiring."
"1058560","1061660"," This is an apple Tesla, it doesn't matter what."
"1062320","1067460"," If you're able to see the interest in options and the price fluctuation in options over the course"
"1067460","1072540"," of the day, and you've got a general feeling of where we're going, you can get an idea of where"
"1072540","1078540"," Max Payne is on that single option, how much interest is in that single option, and the ebb and"
"1078540","1080580"," flow of the interest in it through the course of a day. "
"1080960","1085480"," So you're kind of riding on the coattails of other traders, you're hiding on the coattails of"
"1085480","1086120"," trading firms."
"1086800","1092220"," Now in a day like today where everybody's buying these 433Ps, we talked about that right at the"
"1092220","1096300"," open this morning, we started the livestream, we told you, I said, the only people buying puts"
"1096300","1099560"," right now are going to be retail traders."
"1100040","1108920"," These aren't HFTs, these are retail traders, these are late to the party, or these are firms that"
"1108920","1113980"," are trying to manipulate the market to print some spreads they've got out there, some condors,"
"1113980","1115840"," butterflies, whatever, some manipulation. "
"1116380","1124760"," Some of it is inside, some of it is banks doing it, and they'll try to manipulate the stock price"
"1124760","1127320"," or the share price to where they want it for a close."
"1127740","1130980"," You'll often see this at the beginning of the day and at the end of the day."
"1131600","1133900"," They don't care about that money either. "
"1134420","1139520"," So people will also sometimes think, why are they buying $100,000 in puts right now, or about"
"1139520","1140140"," $1000?"
"1140560","1147520"," Why are they buying 130,000 contracts of spy 4th, 4th, let me go back and look and see where"
"1147520","1147840"," those were."
"1148580","1150440"," Let me see me and raise this up for you so you can see it."
"1152390","1162380"," Bring this back up again, let me log in, just going to get that back to the"
"1162380","1163020"," 13 there. "
"1164420","1170420"," You might be asking yourself why do they keep adding to these puts here, right?"
"1171160","1177620"," Even if it's not going up, so most times when we're moving you'll see these firms creep in."
"1178060","1183480"," Matter of fact the neatest part is, let's say you see one day you'll see 140,000 puts heading into"
"1183480","1188320"," an event and all of a sudden, right?"
"1188320","1191520"," All the buyers raising on the call side and you'll say, oh shit, they're going to counter trade"
"1191520","1192580"," this, right?"
"1192760","1194120"," And then boom, we end up squeezing higher."
"1194880","1199740"," Now why, you might say why are there so much interest that's grown all day long in 437 P?"
"1200080","1204140"," It's not because they don't want, it's not because they're trying to make any money off this. "
"1204500","1209040"," It's because they're holding a position, a condor, a fucking butterfly and they're just trying to"
"1209040","1211800"," manipulate the market enough not to go higher."
"1212240","1213460"," They're just trying to stop it from going."
"1213640","1217720"," If they don't want it at 450, they can't be outside of their butterfly. "
"1217900","1222520"," They want that butterfly to print or that fucking condor to print within a certain price range."
"1222980","1223660"," Does that make sense?"
"1224600","1226520"," It's like right, they want it within a certain price."
"1227080","1228640"," They don't want to trade without it within that range. "
"1229460","1234420"," So the more you, I don't know how to explain this well in simple terms, but just start."
"1234700","1237340"," Even if you sign up for a taster works account and you don't trade on it, you should be trade"
"1237340","1240660"," on tasty because you can make especially if you're new trading, you can make like a hundred"
"1240660","1240940"," accounts."
"1241640","1246280"," You can blow them up with PTD, PDD, whatever it's called, PDT. "
"1247460","1253200"," You can blow them up with day trader rules and just roll the money into another tasty account."
"1253800","1260820"," You can fucking not ICH, but you can wire that ship back and forth into new accounts and keep"
"1260820","1262260"," trading with small accounts."
"1262500","1263140"," But that's very relevant. "
"1263600","1270580"," The point is that if you start some way somehow find a decent way to monitor options chains in your"
"1270580","1277720"," favorite stock for ETF or ETN and just watch the flow of the value of the one that you're in."
"1277780","1282800"," If you're in the put side you want to be in those in those in the lows and then back"
"1282800","1283380"," in in the highs."
"1283960","1288940"," And just as a good indicator, right now the 443's excuse me. "
"1290100","1291540"," I'm assuming a bag over here."
"1293740","1294360"," It's kind of wonky."
"1294740","1297980"," So the 443's right now are currently holding value at 26 cents. "
"1298280","1304440"," I already know right now that the low on most 443's was like 19 cents this morning."
"1305340","1309240"," I know if we break 19 cents, we're probably going to scream even lower."
"1309880","1314740"," But if we're down there and I can grab a low at 19.20 cents, I already know a bunch"
"1314740","1317700"," of holders there that want to grip that into the close. "
"1318400","1319320"," It's hard to explain."
"1319860","1324400"," The longer that you stare at that shit day in, day out for fucking month, three months, six months"
"1324400","1331060"," a year, you start to be able to visualize what the market's going to do."
"1331160","1335320"," It's like a it's a decent tool to be using in the background. "
"1335480","1339040"," You just got it sitting there in the background and you start to time your trades better."
"1339220","1345060"," The key part to the the key part that I'm trying to relate to you in this is think of"
"1345060","1347740"," it like a tug of war."
"1349260","1353300"," You ever get in like a tug of war when you're a kid and you've got like 10 guys or"
"1353300","1356000"," women or 10 women on one side and 10 women on the other side?"
"1356000","1362180"," If you're a woman out there listening to the broadcast right now and I don't know, six guys and"
"1362180","1363900"," seven women in each team or something. "
"1364100","1364520"," Whatever it is."
"1364800","1365420"," It doesn't fucking matter."
"1366040","1370040"," What matters is when you're in that tug of war you know the feeling, right?"
"1370500","1374680"," And you start to get an idea for their strength and their methods, right?"
"1374900","1377560"," And that same thing correlates to watching an options change. "
"1377880","1382060"," So if you're it's like anything."
"1382380","1383580"," It's like sex with the same person."
"1383580","1388560"," It's like when you play a new basketball team or a new soccer team you've never played before and"
"1388560","1389360"," you're like, I don't understand. "
"1389640","1391020"," Oh, get the feel for this team."
"1391320","1394180"," But then you've played a team over and over and over and over again."
"1394360","1396860"," You're like, yeah I know how these guys play. "
"1397100","1397520"," I know they're setups."
"1397780","1399220"," I know I get the feel for man."
"1399440","1400520"," I have a feeling for them, right?"
"1400720","1405040"," You're just uncomfortable and you're getting the feel for where the market's going. "
"1405780","1410420"," The other thing that I watch for in these options chains is premium creep."
"1410880","1416020"," Either out of the options chain or into the options chain."
"1416300","1418820"," Sometimes I'll be sitting there and I'll be like, are we going up or down here?"
"1419320","1421080"," And we might be looking like we're going up. "
"1421220","1422380"," This is a prime example right here."
"1424220","1428300"," Now I'm not saying this is happening right now, but oftentimes you're looking at an option and"
"1428300","1432500"," you're like, yeah we're going to squeeze higher and even though we're squeezing higher on a on a"
"1432500","1437260"," candlestick chart you can see inside the options chain the fucking calls are just dropping in"
"1437260","1437540"," value."
"1437540","1442840"," Now I'm not saying that's happening here but I'm saying if you saw that in an options chain as"
"1442840","1447860"," we're creeping up right now it's showing you that there's a flight away from those calls that they"
"1447860","1449120"," know something that you don't know. "
"1449300","1453780"," So everywhere a little bit of edge that you can get right between the book map between the options"
"1453780","1460080"," chain between the option flow that's coming in between the market breadth indicator between the"
"1460080","1461240"," news that's coming out."
"1461400","1462300"," We'll listen to trade the news."
"1462520","1467140"," All of those indicators you start listening to trade the news you're watching these two or three"
"1467140","1471560"," screeners and you're saying you're in your candlestick chart and you get to look at the market the"
"1471560","1475460"," market profile is right and you're like oh shit I have an edge. "
"1476240","1477660"," I have an edge over other people."
"1477700","1482800"," I have an edge over traders and this is one of my tools that I use to have that edge."
"1484160","1486200"," That's like I know that I'm making the right decision right. "
"1487640","1490500"," So you might, this might not make sense to you right now."
"1490520","1491660"," I'm going to have to explain this well."
"1492140","1494540"," I'm not doing this kind of off the topic as I was asked. "
"1494860","1500360"," I haven't had a chance to formulate a better explanation of this but what I point to you is this."
"1501140","1501920"," Here's my point."
"1502820","1509780"," My point is open a fucking options chain right and then you'll start inventing like you'll start"
"1509780","1510140"," doing it. "
"1510220","1513260"," You'll start bouncing through like today's expiry tomorrow's expiry."
"1513760","1517920"," You'll start to check to see if there's a bunch of call holders that you don't see on today's"
"1517920","1523960"," expiry but all of a sudden you check tomorrow's expiry and there's like 500,000 calls on tomorrow's"
"1523960","1524380"," expiry."
"1524800","1526640"," Oh you got some backup over there. "
"1527040","1530980"," Then you find out you looked a deeper in the call expiry or the expiry chain you find out oh"
"1530980","1537060"," wow next week there's fucking half a million fucking puts over on fucking 400 you know or it's or"
"1537060","1540100"," it's a month out you start seeing where all the placements are where the hedging is."
"1540220","1546720"," You start to see the makeup and components visualized of the of where they where market makers are"
"1546720","1552980"," hedging for us to go where the value is or the premium is in each option and then you can"
"1552980","1559680"," actually jump in too on specific strikes right strikes that are popular it's always good to be in"
"1559680","1566460"," strikes that are always but you know a lot of the time it's good to be in where popular strikes"
"1566460","1572480"," are especially if you're like are we short a longer stock for an ETF or ETN or whatever you dig"
"1572480","1579680"," through there well you go out there blindly by some call on any ticker and you find out that"
"1579680","1584320"," nobody's in calls that it's just a shit ton of puts in there and you're the only guy by it"
"1584320","1587680"," you're the only guy buying calls right you want to go in there and just dig around root around a"
"1587680","1592880"," little bit and find out what's going on so if you don't do that in your trading I'm going to"
"1592880","1600440"," recommend to you to start doing that and you'll start to be able to decipher what's going on you'll"
"1600440","1607140"," start to be able to decipher what's going on behind the scenes of the intraday trades and training"
"1607140","1613320"," and another neat part of that too right is if we make violent moves in the market unexpected you"
"1613320","1618160"," guys are ever out there and you're like why did the market just dump like I didn't see that coming"
"1618160","1622920"," I didn't see news on I didn't see news on twitter I didn't Walter Bloomberg didn't say nothing"
"1622920","1628300"," trade the news didn't say something but I guarantee you with one place you will see it right you'll"
"1628300","1634060"," see them fucking come in like a back door you'll see like men in black suits right the bed and"
"1634060","1637700"," black will come in and you'll just all of a sudden see them buy it remember yesterday we were"
"1637700","1641820"," trading yesterday together and I said to you I was like all these things are saying we're going up"
"1641820","1646600"," right here I was like but this I got this fucking great that it was grading me yesterday I was"
"1646600","1652000"," like I was like man I was like these motherfuckers keep loading up here like they're actively like"
"1652000","1657200"," at that moment I was like we should be going up here I was like it was my effect it"
"1657200","1666940"," was right here it was it was right here yesterday see what I can bring this up right here"
"1666940","1675720"," so yesterday I'll make pretend we didn't see this trade yet right see this right here"
"1675720","1682140"," I think this is where we put it we drew it right here we drew this yesterday and we were"
"1682140","1688820"," talking about in stream yesterday right pretend we didn't have 10 you didn't know any of this over"
"1688820","1696560"," here you didn't know anything about this over here it was just showing this right here you know any"
"1696560","1702100"," of this over here it was looking like we were consolidating right and we're gonna get this nice"
"1702100","1707960"," spike up here or even higher right and all the indicators said this was a bull flag we're going"
"1707960","1714400"," higher everything said this yesterday and I'm over here and we're down here yesterday down here and"
"1714400","1721660"," I'm looking and I'm like like motherfuckers I'm like they went from 40,000 40,000 puts to 90,000"
"1721660","1726680"," puts now they're up to 150,000 puts normally shit they just went to 200,000 puts I'm like why"
"1726680","1731720"," are these motherfuckers just loading up fuck up right now at this moment they're doing it like"
"1731720","1737740"," right here they're doing it they're just fucking loading up and I'm like these motherfuckers know"
"1737740","1742420"," what's going on in the background these fucking guys are about to drop this drop this fucking"
"1742420","1747520"," market down here and meanwhile no one knows a fucking thing about it right and we caught this"
"1747520","1752780"," yesterday because of what everything else was saying we're going up and we caught it because of"
"1752780","1757780"," something simple enough and free by the way of just keeping your eye and then options chain and"
"1757780","1762780"," seeing where the high-frequency trading firms are coming in and coming out sometimes you'll see"
"1762780","1767580"," them do splits and strangles you'll see them by both sides you'll see you'll see them sometimes be"
"1767580","1772420"," in for like five seconds in out in out that's why I call them hyper constraining firms and they're"
"1772420","1777320"," manipulating the market this is where you'll see this is where you'll see the actual manipulation"
"1777320","1782220"," in the market you'll actually be able if you track that stuff you can actually see them come in and"
"1782220","1786160"," out they're like little tinkerers in the background and they're fucking around the market they're"
"1786160","1790660"," basically manipulating it for their own benefit whether they are holding a position like they're"
"1790660","1795460"," holding the underlying stock they want to be at a certain price whether they're in spreads whether"
"1795460","1800420"," in butterflies whether in some complex ratio spread that they need to have print they will come in"
"1800420","1806260"," and manipulate the fucking market including the fucking spy and shockingly right they might have a"
"1806260","1812400"," position that they need to get print on in Tesla or in Apple right so those shorts literally short"
"1812400","1820360"," smaller ETFs and indexes I'll post sometime I'm going crazy about this I'll post sometime up one of"
"1820360","1827020"," these days I'll dig up some some talks that I've listened to and been to in the past amongst very"
"1827020","1831900"," smart people like Princeton cut type shit and these guys talk about they're like they'll short"
"1831900","1839720"," Tesla but not through spy they'll fucking short Tesla in tiny easily to manipulate ETFs these tiny"
"1839720","1845900"," ETFs that actually impact the spy so they'll put a short arm up there or manipulate the spy to drop"
"1845900","1851160"," Tesla and then they'll go and attack it in these smaller ETFs right so these guys know beforehand"
"1851160","1856720"," the impact it's gonna have actually happened on spy from these smaller ETFs while instead of"
"1856720","1861720"," actively shorting Tesla directly they'll short it indirectly and impact price the stock so as these"
"1861720","1867000"," complex trades that go on the background but meanwhile you've got a door into that world you can"
"1867000","1872240"," actually watch the dark room the options chain room it's a dark room and all of a sudden you see"
"1872240","1877820"," a guy in a black suit walk in the back door and he goes you all think we're going up"
"1877820","1883460"," right now but I'm gonna load the fuck up on fucking 200,000 puts right now zero dates and I'm"
"1883460","1887960"," gonna drop this pitch down and then all of a five minutes later spy dumps and they got paid"
"1887960","1896480"," billions and you're getting stuck holding fucking bags so my point is sign up for Tasty account you"
"1896480","1900960"," have paid on it sign up for one get in there open up an options chain keep it on a"
"1900960","1907580"," good ground like the Salvation Army or something or the good will grab an old shitty monitor plug"
"1907580","1916920"," that motherfucker into your into your laptop or into your like Windows 10 or something and look up"
"1916920","1922840"," identify screens or text screens or whatever you do right slam into a three monitors into your into"

"1926540","1931980"," monitors one screener you want to keep a little box of me in there so you can watch me all"
"1931980","1935700"," day long and then another little box I want you to open up that little fucking when you open up"
"1935700","1942000"," a little Tasty Works then this other this better programs there's actual you can pay for the"
"1942000","1947700"," options chain to be up and open and be more interactive and more direct but for me it's easy it's"
"1947700","1953000"," simple I can simply see them simply see it in visual form and Tasty it's free I trade on it"
"1953000","1958260"," already I'm buying and selling these calls and put all day long but for you you just want to start"
"1958260","1963020"," watching the ebb and flow inside of these these options chains all day every day that's what you"
"1963020","1966940"," watch so that you get a feel for it like a woman right or for like you like you want"
"1966940","1971700"," to get a feel for something you want to feel for the inner workings of something or the of the"
"1971700","1981300"," inner mechanicals that go on easy way to do it easy way easy easy easy does that work"
"1981300","1990660"," so the point here is this if you don't understand what I'm talking about right my point to you is"
"1990660","1995940"," it's like when you play somebody over and over and over again you don't have to look at them the"
"1995940","2000500"," first day and say I understand what's going out this team but the fifth or tenth time that you play"
"2000500","2006100"," them you start to understand even does that make sense it's more about a feel so just start"
"2006100","2011340"," watching an options chain watch them all day long in and out in and out with the base trades on"
"2011340","2016660"," it but just watch the ebb and flow after a while you're gonna in your your eyes are gonna start"
"2016660","2022720"," to identify the shifts inside of the market you'll start to understand what's going on you like"
"2022720","2028780"," yeah now we were wasn't a good example because they don't really show you visually a quick way to"
"2028780","2035880"," see where the where the where the hand is on the scale but for me I can easily see when"
"2035880","2040980"," the finger comes out and sits on the scale on each side and yet it's interesting you have the basic"
"2040980","2045300"," calls and puts on this but I'll tell you what as you see the pivot points in the market you'll"
"2045300","2050179"," start to see the shifting in the options chain too you'll you actually see it take place light"
"2050179","2058199"," right before or leading up to a pivot moment in the market you don't believe it just try it just"
"2058199","2070610"," give it a chance oh you're"
"2070610","2078449"," gonna do that corn trade are you in that corn trade now the whole negative gamma thing is a whole"
"2078449","2082449"," other thing so if you're talking about if you want to start talking about positive and negative"
"2082449","2088210"," gamma whole different conversation that were it works and it worked so that works in positive and"
"2088210","2094190"," negative gamma watching options chains that's not Singapore it's circulating now that the New York"
"2094190","2103770"," City subway shooting suspect has been taken into custody oh yeah baby get that motherfucker let's"
"2103770","2106650"," talk about you guys want to talk about negative gamma real quick you can talk about negative gamma"
"2106650","2113810"," what you need to know about negative gamma we can tell what that real quick you want to pretend let"
"2113810","2119630"," me see if I can put something up to show you about negative negative gamma give you a basic"
"2119630","2129540"," understanding of negative but it's not really negative and positive gamma but we can show"
"2129540","2140220"," it I can visualize it for you let me"
"2140220","2146680"," see explain it let me see it explain it with it contemplate this my mind so if we're in a"
"2146680","2150920"," if we're in a positive quote-unquote positive looks like some dip buyers are stepping in right now"
"2150920","2159800"," the cues in the spy sets up dip buyers stepping in currently on the spy and the cues dip buyers"
"2159800","2169740"," stepping in so let's start at we'll we'll talk about the three terms talk about volatility levels"
"2169740","2178080"," just they're areas of contention large areas of contention right"
"2178080","2187240"," oftentimes I won't trade volatility levels because this that's for me at the end result is it's"
"2187240","2196140"," where I where options are get ground up in value like monthly basis I look for volatility levels"
"2196140","2201980"," for where to sell they're a larger volatility levels in large timeframes they're smaller volatility"
"2201980","2207440"," levels on daily timeframes now but you just have to know that right those are areas of support and"
"2207440","2213900"," resistance that's the easiest way to say that I would have volatility trigger it's support and"
"2213900","2219400"," resistance volatility trigger it's easy way just vault so it's a fancy way of saying believe it or"
"2219400","2229120"," not support resistance then we've got negative and positive gamma regimes right those"
"2229120","2237020"," levels change what you really what you really need to know about negative and positive get our"
"2237020","2246920"," gamma is levels of volatility within those with within those areas getting nice"
"2246920","2253000"," little squeeze going on the spy right now so if we're in a if we're in a negative gamma zone"
"2253000","2259600"," right or an area of us if you're raising there reading to investment grade going to be minus from"
"2259600","2265420"," double b plus that looks stable for hotel uniform November I'll bring this over I'll show you this"
"2265420","2274100"," in a better better light okay so right now our current I believe it's at 450 but I think it's"
"2274100","2280880"," actually hot or I think the band of volatility right now is higher but oh oh oh what I'll do"
"2280880","2288140"," is I'll make this easy for you so simplified always simplify these things never try to over"
"2288140","2294800"," complicate the stuff and if we're going up and down that impacts what happens within positive or"
"2294800","2300840"," negative gamma too but it's not important right now we're sitting in a box or something I get a box"
"2300840","2310460"," I'm sitting in a box I just need a box I forget where the box is there's a box rectangle"
"2310460","2320160"," okay so let's say at 450 right anything down here right is is negative gamma"
"2320160","2329260"," let's say let's just say I think it's at 450 but this is negative gamma in here okay we're gonna"
"2329260","2339100"," make this color red okay well on here god damn it red okay right and then we have"
"2339100","2349160"," what's called the volatility trigger or a volatility zone right make this one yellow okay"
"2349160","2358520"," make this one yellow right and then above here we'll make this positive gamma pair let's just say"
"2358520","2367740"," this is positive gamma here hold on we'll make this green"
"2367740","2377240"," okay so whenever we're below down in this negative negative gamma zone down here right you're going"
"2377240","2382540"," to expect now depending on which way we're headed to if we're headed up here you can see that we"
"2382540","2388820"," don't really like we still have high volatility right high big moves right big moves whenever"
"2388820","2396980"," you're whenever you're down inside of negative gamma you'll have violence moves up and down okay"
"2396980","2403680"," you get to be conscious of that up and down these this area here of contention right is where you"
"2403680","2409100"," can lose the trade right an example would be you think we're going to sell off I'm saying that the"
"2409100","2414000"," latest military eight package from the us to Ukraine will contain many of the weapons systems yes"
"2414000","2420560"," it's already provided as well as some new capabilities we didn't tear but when we did it was a"
"2420560","2425460"," violent move down right violence right this is this ball clear whenever this is diggling in the"
"2425460","2431480"," middle don't ever like doing it now these moves are violent moves right we get these huge moves"
"2431480","2437780"," when we're in here right no matter where we're going violence specified in the package will include"
"2437780","2444060"," artillery systems artillery rounds and armored personnel carriers when you're when you're in a"
"2444060","2452900"," positive gamma environment also approving transfer of additional helicopters to Ukraine you tend to"
"2452900","2460280"," have less violence you have less implied moves in the day so your implied move up here not always"
"2460280","2467440"," but you might have an implied move up here of let's say let's say you've got an implied move today"
"2468000","2476320"," at 30 at 0.30 0.30 right now it didn't happen here but typically you will you have like"
"2476320","2483780"," 30 percent moves very small moves in in in in low gamma environments if you're flagging here then"
"2483780","2489140"," you'll have that squeeze higher the other small implied moves generally speak not always but"
"2489140","2495940"," typically volatility will be compressed when you're in a positive gamma environment when you're in"
"2495940","2505260"," a negative gamma environment your implied moves tend to be like 1.5 right not 0.3 percent very rare"
"2505260","2509480"," in negative gamma environments you might get some sideways days and we'll tell you here we're going"
"2509480","2514460"," to trade sideways here right but you know but still there's risk of a higher of a larger move down"
"2514460","2519400"," here but generally speaking when you're in a positive gamma environment you're going to have less"
"2519400","2524540"," moves you'll have the meltups you'll have that we continue to just grind higher and grind higher"
"2524540","2531640"," and grind higher and grind higher and here we tend to have more risk for violence and more risk and"
"2531640","2535940"," also another note in here is when we're down here you tend when I you guys want to come on"
"2535940","2539880"," stream with you know I'm like sell the rip sell the rip right sell the rip even if we trade"
"2539880","2544780"," a higher sell the rip sell the rip this is your ceiling up in here right sell the rip don't"
"2544780","2550520"," be about trying to time your dips down here is no point the regime down here is selling the regime"
"2550520","2556940"," up here is buying the dip buying the dip buying the dip does that make sense so you're buying the"
"2556940","2562720"," dip once we break down below into volatility it starts to turn into sell the rip sell the rip sell"
"2562720","2566740"," the rip sell the rip sell the rip sell the rip sell the rip sell the rip sell the rip"
"2566740","2573460"," sell the rip does that make sense okay so how does how does gamma impact our negative and positive"
"2573460","2581440"," these levels change um change all the time they fluctuate um so that's all you really need to know"
"2581440","2586520"," you don't really need to know too much when it comes to um you don't need to get too you"
"2586520","2592500"," don't you don't need no need to overthink a lot of this stuff and a lot of times traders and"
"2592500","2597160"," investors they try to be smarter than the guy that's showing you that stuff not me but like even"
"2597160","2602280"," spot gamma you don't want to be you don't need to over complicate this stuff it's just another tool"
"2602280","2608140"," in your tool tool chest to say what is what regime we're in right now and just showing you that"
"2608140","2612460"," now what regime that that's actually what it where it is right now i think i think that's pretty"
"2612460","2617080"," much the levels right now so what regime are we in right now right so we're in the sell the"
"2617080","2623160"," rip regime this is generally where it was right so we're looking for any opportunity to sell it"
"2623160","2627380"," doesn't mean you just go fuck it i'm buying puts down here because we're in a negative gamma regime"
"2627380","2632220"," it means we're going to have some violent moves and whenever we whenever we have a rip you're"
"2632220","2637740"," looking to sell it so if you see a move up today into tomorrow up here what are you looking"
"2637740","2641960"," for up here you're not looking to take this long if anything you're waiting to get above a"
"2641960","2648980"," volatility zone then you pick this up long you pick it up past the volatility zone right the"
"2648980","2655760"," volatility trigger sorry uh vault trigger you want to wait to pick this up as a bull right but if"
"2655760","2659460"," we are if we know we're already in negative gamma you're just waiting for every time we come higher"
"2659460","2665420"," every time we come higher up in here you're going to sell sell sell if that makes sense does that"
"2665420","2674870"," make sense any guys out there that's simplified enough or not is that too fast that helps oh"
"2674870","2679430"," awesome so keep it simple so if you know where the so if i tell you if you guys ask"
"2679430","2683230"," me the more you're like hey where's the vault trigger hey where's what's the gamma levels i can"
"2683230","2687350"," tell you every day i pretty much have a fair idea of where they are as a matter of fact"
"2687350","2694190"," uh there's a cool guy uh Sergio he's a Ukrainian guy he wrote some code to get your own gamma"
"2694190","2699450"," levels if you guys want we can do some coding together one day and a slow day if you have"
"2699450","2706450"," a slow day coming up uh i can i can code some um we can live stream a coding session"
"2706450","2714850"," where we code uh what the fuck's the uh language it's um what is what's the god i have to"
"2714850","2719070"," get the god damn name of the language i do not forget but i want a mind block on it"
"2719070","2726210"," anyways this guy on twitter cool guy uh he gave he posted some public code uh to write a script"
"2726210","2730130"," so you can get your own gamma levels you don't even need a fucking paper spot gamma you can just"
"2730130","2734650"," get your own gamma levels every single day and find out where vault triggers are we're negative and"
"2734650","2740370"," positive gamma is in the market we'll do that together so that um one of these days we'll write"
"2740370","2746610"," we'll write some code or we'll transfer some code so you guys can can have your own little program"
"2746610","2754250"," that'll show you um show you uh your own gamma levels you can tip it out yeah python thank you"
"2754250","2761890"," python god damn it yeah we'll do some python coding together one of these slow days we'll write"
"2761890","2766990"," we'll we'll write it he gives all the inputs so we'll just write some simple code and then we'll"
"2766990","2771970"," write a python program and you can get your own fucking gamma and post it on the internet and tell"
"2771970","2780790"," everybody you're fucking super cool okay ready so we got this next tag above looking for 443 see if"
"2780790","2786130"," we can get up here to 443 hopefully you took that last trade we just talked about right told you"
"2786130","2791790"," about that ripper coming in told you that there's uh QQQs and spy calls coming out and we are"
"2791790","2797290"," ripping higher right now nice dip by right down in here right nice little bottoming pattern this is"
"2797290","2800990"," a beautiful trade damn it dude i missed some of these trades some over here chatting with you guys"
"2800990","2806210"," uh thank at least i'm saying some bub this is a beautiful fucking trade right here uh sellers are"
"2806210","2814590"," still above at four four four four uh three so the beautiful trade damn it god damn it i'm missing"
"2814590","2820850"," money right now i'm it's well so what you need to know is this right you need to know where"
"2820850","2827070"," volatility triggers are on a macro scale not macro but you know we'll fucking mark it then you see"
"2827070","2831370"," me in the morning i'll say here there's some sellers here some some weak resistance here there's"
"2831370","2837750"," some support over here those are just smaller smaller minute intraday uh volatility triggers they"
"2837750","2843490"," basically are they're just basically an inside intraday volatility triggers areas of support"
"2843490","2850070"," resistance but what you need to know as a trader investor is are we in a positive regime are we"
"2850070","2854890"," in a negative regime the other thing too is as we let's say we're in a positive uh gamma"
"2854890","2859530"," environment but we're trading down towards that volatility trigger right there's still different"
"2859530","2865030"," state or there's still uh move large moves that can be made large moves once we hit those"
"2865030","2870370"," volatility triggers we break through it we bounce off it um and what starts stance so when people"
"2870370","2873770"," ask me all the time they're like but and i get yelled at for it i got people that come"
"2873770","2878430"," in the stream and they get pissed off at me and they're like you told me you were bullish and"
"2878430","2882970"," you were bearish and you were this and you were that and i'm like well fuck i mean so like"
"2882970","2889810"," my overall stance right now is bearish it is even though we're going up right now my overall stance"
"2889810","2895150"," is bearish right and yours should be too we're in a negative gamma environment if anyone asks you"
"2895150","2901010"," you should be always like right now you should always be like well i am bearish right now right i"
"2901010","2905830"," am bearish uh even though i'm bearish that doesn't mean that i'm looking to fucking just buy"
"2905830","2911490"," fucking puts wherever you know it means that you're looking for any good opportunity to short this"
"2911490","2916990"," market now if you're like well let's see what the pits of hell in the market where negative gamma"
"2916990","2922390"," environments and you're like well you bearish or you bullish i'll say to you well you know i'm i'm"
"2922390","2927590"," let's say we have a market liquidation event well i'm bearish here but i'm definitely bullish gonna"
"2927590","2933290"," buy this fucking bottom right here right i'm gonna trade it up as high as i possibly can but i'm"
"2933290","2938370"," not gonna have a bullish viewpoint until i get back into nate and it's positive gamma gamma to we"
"2938370","2943790"," break through this giant volatility trigger above us so that gives you your that gives you your"
"2943790","2951290"," overall uh macro viewpoint right on the market until we break above this ball trigger i can't have"
"2951290","2955990"," a view of an overall bullish stance in the market but i can buy this bottom over here so make"
"2955990","2960230"," sense so you can be bearish and bullish at the same time uh so when people are out there in"
"2960230","2965890"," public saying stuff like uh we're going to fucking all-time highs and i'm like don't fuck keep that"
"2965890","2972850"," guy saying i'm like we're fucking down in this market breath and i'm like when we just rolled over"
"2972850","2978910"," a market breath i'm like none of these things here are saying none of these things here are saying"
"2978910","2983510"," going up well we make it up today but none of these things are saying we already had the bit"
"2983510","2987930"," in the market we already bought a bottom down here we just bought a bottom down here there's a"
"2987930","3005620"," prime example because it's a prime example hold on here i'm gonna bring this up for you guys let me"
"3005620","3015440"," just take a second here was a good example it's a good thing to be"
"3015440","3022820"," thinking about here right we already know that the we already know that the ball trigger is let me"
"3022820","3039160"," see oh no right here somewhere in here come in no"
"3039160","3050670"," hold on let's take it here just"
"3050670","3060610"," take it here okay so if you already know"
"3060610","3065650"," this the ball till you trigger right we're at around 450 we know above is positive gamma we know"
"3065650","3070690"," down below is negative gamma right so just look at this bottom this bottom thing down here right so"
"3070690","3074570"," you ask me hey what what your stance right now what's your viewpoint of the market well i'm bearish"
"3074570","3080930"," we're down in negative gamma right next thing we already know that the market breath indicator has"
"3080930","3085710"," nothing to do with price that we can be going straight up over here this was this was actually we"
"3085710","3092130"," had this was all positive up here right um we still had market breath breakdowns right uh but right"
"3092130","3097430"," now we're still in negative gamma and the market is rolling over if we were above here and the"
"3097430","3102490"," market was just starting to roll over or it was near completion of rolling over let's say the"
"3102490","3109170"," market was actually right here let's say the market had traded up it was just coming down right"
"3109170","3114910"," here and we were in this this uh breath was down at the bottom down here we'll say we're way"
"3114910","3119550"," down here right what would my viewpoint be well shit we've already liquidated the market we're in"
"3119550","3125850"," positive gamma i'm bullish on the stock market does that make sense and because we are we are"
"3125850","3131950"," rolling over right here and we're still in negative gamma i am my overall view is bearish on the"
"3131950","3136630"," market and you can just use this when someone's asking you are you bullish or bearish in the market"
"3136630","3143050"," i can tell you right now technically why we are right technically why we're we're in negative gamma"
"3143050","3150010"," we're markets rolling over where we probably will probably at this point liquidates below in"
"3150010","3154310"," negative gamma and some of you points still uh negative gamma when you guys want to get bullish"
"3154810","3159170"," like really bullish not buying a bottom down here bullish because you're gonna be bullish for for"
"3159170","3164110"," this run that's fine and still have a bearish outlook you can still be bearish in this market and"
"3164110","3170290"," buy a capitulation moment in the market down here right uh so you can still be bearish and still"
"3170290","3174410"," buy calls down here and still be a fucking bear uh but if you want to be a bull and"
"3174410","3180030"," say i'm fucking bullish in this market you need to see like a market liquidation event still above"
"3180030","3185170"," in positive gamma and you still know at that point uh that we're going up we're going up from here"
"3185170","3190190"," and and furthermore we should probably grind most of this up it's not going to be these violent"
"3190190","3197630"," moves or above here let's hope that helps you know they used to have people come in extreme be like"
"3197630","3202850"," i don't you're fucking liar and you're fucking this i'm like you got your crazy i'm like it's not"
"3202850","3206610"," like i just make this shit up on the back of my fucking ass i'm looking at this stuff every"
"3206610","3212990"," day believe it or not i'm looking at this shit every day and this is how i get my views"
"3214230","3219510"," right and uh i'm not the only one out there in the marketplace that does this uh it's not like"

"3363610","3369130"," trying to get these puts to print even more into the end of the week so today i said to"
"3369130","3375010"," this morning i said keep your eyes on the options chain today if we see hedging flow and put flow"
"3375010","3381970"," on top of that hedging flow uh to amplify into today and tomorrow we'll know if we get a market"
"3381970","3388710"," reversal otherwise if we don't see that we know right we know that there's a shit ton of puts that"
"3388710","3394390"," are going to expire today and tomorrow now jpm caller they might leave that on and not close it out"
"3394390","3400130"," but you know what that fucking caller is followed by hedge funds it's followed by other"
"3400130","3407110"," institutions it's followed by retail traders it's followed by small family run uh houses and so"
"3407110","3412810"," you've got all these people watching that trade right and even though jpm might not close it you"
"3412810","3417570"," got shit like i think they're traitors i think it's $50 million but i guarantee you got another"
"3417570","3424890"," fucking 200 million or 500 million or even a billion dollars on that same fucking trade and they"
"3424890","3429950"," might use it as a hedge they paid for it for free with selling calls above they moved the market"
"3429950","3435570"," that day everyone's anticipating that trade so what happens when jpm puts that trade on right"
"3435570","3440390"," you've got all these other motherfuckers that follow that trade and they might not close it but the"
"3440390","3446010"," smaller hedge funds and the other banks and the other retail traders that are throwing heavy trades"
"3446010","3450530"," on they're sure as shit gonna close their end of that trade they're not using it as an actual hedge"
"3450530","3455510"," they're using it as a way to fucking fund themselves and that's pretty much that trade on captain's"
"3455510","3461530"," trades is this it's the same fucking trade it's basically the jpm caller uh but just the call side"
"3461530","3466810"," uh just the call side i think i find the call side to be simpler to find when it's ready"
"3466810","3472850"," to go but it's basically that fucking trade and so we're going to trade that trade or make that"
"3472850","3479610"," trade in the market uh you know once a month once every month and a half or whatever um because"
"3479610","3485070"," we can get some indicators to say that it's going to work but anyways my point behind that is this"
"3485070","3489170"," is that when chase is asking that question this morning because like we're going to continue to go"
"3489170","3494410"," up for our third uh wednesday and thursday this week and more than likely yes even if the jpm"
"3494410","3498790"," caller doesn't close there's a shit ton of traders out there that are in the money with that"
"3498790","3504090"," following that trade and they are going to close for profit and so that's the implication today and"
"3504090","3507890"," tomorrow uh that we're going to go up we're going to go up today we're going to go up tomorrow"
"3507890","3514250"," and uh those all those puts and all those put spreads uh all those fucking butterflies and condors"
"3514250","3518070"," that have had half their legs cut off on they're going to try to get they're going to now get"
"3518070","3524330"," the call side of those trades to print they're going to close their put side for profit even if the"
"3524330","3531510"," uh interest stays on on the hedging now the other thing too in this is the market makers know a"
"3531510","3537130"," lot of this shit is going on so the market makers too at the same time can see puts being"
"3537130","3543450"," closed they see calls being bought they see that there's no chance right there's no implied move"
"3543450","3549330"," low enough from the structure of market that we're not going to 420 today we're not going to 400"
"3549330","3556530"," today but they start to de hedge and de risk themselves from that implied move lower right so so"
"3556530","3561950"," everybody knows everybody knows except for everybody except for some people know that there's not"
"3561950","3566910"," much risk of us going there so if there's not much risk of us going there right they're going to"
"3566910","3574190"," want to make money on the upside swing right in devalue uh those options right down to zero um so"
"3574190","3579090"," we'll probably see that today and tomorrow we'll see that that that implication so let's see if we"
"3579090","3584950"," can go higher here we've got a nice little bounce another another uh cut some bears in a bear trap"
"3584950","3594100"," take a look here and let's see how how high we can go let's see if we can peek up"

"5635070","5636210"," We've got a great group of traders."
"5636290","5637750"," They try to help each other. "
"5637850","5644150"," I've been a member of some pretty, pretty badass like high speed trading rooms, like boiler room"
"5644150","5644650"," type shit."
"5645170","5646550"," And they're fucking assholes."
"5646970","5648450"," They're not nice fucking people. "
"5648790","5651790"," If you don't know what you're doing, they'll sit down on you."
"5651890","5652830"," They'll sit right down your neck."
"5653470","5655450"," We try not to do any of that around here. "
"5655710","5658530"," If I catch that shit, I'll fucking bounce somebody in a minute."
"5659110","5661310"," I don't care if you're greatest trader in the world."
"5661330","5662350"," You should be passing that along. "
"5662810","5665350"," If you're a new trader, you should be sucking it up like a sponge."
"5666830","5670010"," And the reason I say that is because we're fucking retail traders."
"5670250","5673350"," It doesn't matter if you've got five years, 10 years or a day of experience. "
"5674010","5675710"," There's a couple, I've got a couple of thoughts on that."
"5676250","5682470"," Number one, the retail traders are still getting, they're still scattered, right?"
"5682890","5686350"," They're going to be a force in this market someday in a big way."
"5686710","5690010"," And the more they help each other out, the more you can compete against a large bank. "
"5690830","5696230"," And secondly, why the fuck would you want to shit down on a retail trader when you've got a bunch"
"5696230","5701070"," of fat bucks in banks that could give a flying fuck about every single retail trader?"
"5702090","5703710"," All you can do is help each other out."
"5703890","5704750"," We don't move markets."
"5705550","5709430"," So if we should be helping each other out to make sure that we're making money in these markets and"
"5709430","5711590"," we're competing against the banks on each other. "
"5711910","5714830"," If you think you're taking my $100,000, you're not."
"5715130","5716670"," The banks are taking my $100,000."
"5717290","5721010"," If you think we are taking money from the banks, that's what we're doing. "
"5721510","5723090"," So keep that mindset when you're a trader."
"5723450","5727950"," Remember back when you're a new trader or a new investor and try to help your fellow man along,"
"5728050","5732990"," fellow woman along, him, her, them, whatever they want to be called."

"5757790","5761730"," getting in your job because of inflation because you're getting fucked over by everybody in your"
"5761730","5761970"," life."

"6161890","6164890"," There's no guy like fucking, there's no like me Kevin out there."
"6166570","6168790"," There's no guy out there goofing around."
"6168970","6172570"," They're very serious about trading and investing. "
"6173410","6175310"," But even if it's dry, you can put them on at nighttime."

"6244030","6247250"," Now there's 176,000 calls on 442. "
"6250070","6252050"," I think I'm going to try to pin it to the bell at least."
"6252930","6254830"," It looks like they don't want it going any lower."
"6262480","6265080"," Gorgeous, look at that gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous higher. "
"6266220","6271120"," So options industry counsel, if you don't, if you don't pay for that shit out there, don't be out"
"6271120","6272640"," there paying for fucking classes."
"6274160","6277720"," You'll be paying for like alpha shit behind closed doors."
"6279180","6281960"," There are some people that put out some quality stuff that I've paid for. "
"6282160","6284480"," I got paid for spot gamma, you know, shit like that."
"6286080","6289200"," There's a what's this guy?"
"6289380","6293260"," There's a couple guys out there that I would I would pay for some of their information."
"6294660","6297560"," But you guys don't have to be paying like out of your asses for stuff. "
"6299400","6301140"," I paid for a lot of myself."
"6301660","6306620"," And then the guy that's talking to you might see him live for like an hour."
"6308000","6311680"," You know, are you gonna record a video or you get a live stream for 45 minutes?"
"6312520","6316820"," Or you they might show up in a pivot one or two days a week, but they're off fucking pissing"
"6316820","6320640"," away the $300 to pay them every month or $600 to pay them every month. "
"6322850","6327550"," Where they're sending you signals that they're getting from people like me."
"6328990","6335050"," I caught people doing that people, but I caught, I've caught a couple of bots that take posts that"
"6335050","6335290"," I make."
"6336050","6339690"," You know, so they're just, they're just rehashing and cycling stuff that guys like me, guys out"
"6339690","6341910"," there or women out there or whatever. "
"6342590","6343610"," It's becoming support right here."
"6343730","6346210"," Just that heads up that 443 is now becoming support."
"6347450","6348450"," I'll just see this right here. "
"6348630","6349310"," We'll follow my cursor."
"6350410","6351810"," See this little bump right here."
"6353310","6355050"," Might be able to make a nice light higher right here. "
"6355210","6355850"," Nice squeeze higher."
"6360400","6362140"," So yeah, try not to pay for that stuff you can."
"6362300","6364060"," You can make some of those classes are good to pay for. "
"6364200","6366340"," I think spot gamma has a class."
"6366780","6367760"," I have never taken it."
"6369100","6370500"," But I think it's part of their package. "
"6371600","6373260"," I've never been interested in taking it."
"6373700","6378840"," I've taken a few classes that I've paid for in the past, and they've most of them suck."
"6379860","6380780"," I've got some food. "
"6380900","6381400"," I've got some."
"6381880","6385040"," I've got a library of classes."
"6387420","6389340"," I could post them. "
"6391600","6393780"," They're just fucking goofy half of these classes."
"6403060","6404640"," Nice push higher to 443."
"6405400","6407600"," We'll see if we can maintain up here now. "
"6408520","6418520"," Let's see if"
"6418520","6420440"," we can do this is blue skies above."
"6421160","6422080"," I don't care what you say."
"6423420","6428700"," If this holds here, this is definitely blue skies above. "
"6430140","6432460"," The bulls are in charge right now."
"6436990","6439330"," 443 is now worth 67 cents."
"6439890","6440750"," Fuck yes. "
"6443650","6444470"," Hell yes."
"6449670","6451950"," I don't know if we turn around here or not."
"6452110","6455510"," If we continue higher, we should be able to move up to 445. "
"6456110","6462010"," It's only fucking 309 to power our baby."
"6467680","6468720"," That's base and baby."
"6476790","6479550"," Support on spy for a bounce chase is 443. "
"6481010","6482890"," It's starting to create a base right now."
"6485300","6488300"," If it can hold right here, it can squeeze to 445."
"6501430","6502910"," We'll see if it's going to leg up here. "
"6504870","6511950"," If it can base here, you can see right here, all these sellers have been, all these sellers, what"
"6511950","6516110"," it looks like on paper, all these sellers have been worn out."
"6516610","6525050"," If it can base here, I'm not seeing sellers in charge to make that leg higher."
"6525230","6530430"," I don't know if we get higher here, but let's go back here and look and see if we can"
"6530430","6530990"," get. "
"6533680","6539000"," Yeah, see the sellers are up here at 440, 480."
"6540740","6542540"," Sellers are weak currently in here."
"6543840","6545680"," I don't even know roll here, I'm just saying. "
"6546260","6549860"," Buyers, the buyers seem to be buying the dip at 442, 10."
"6550780","6557560"," The sellers seem to be higher because next dollars are coming down currently."
"6558260","6562780"," We just moved down to 443.40. Yeah, looks like they moved down slightly here. "
"6566130","6569730"," So you can find where they are, the majority of them."
"6589320","6599600"," Nice tag at 443.27 calls coming in on SPX, Facebook, X, spy, TQQQ's,"
"6601020","6606860"," SPX, April 13th, 44.55, only $45,000."
"6607440","6611380"," A neat little block of calls came in on two tickers. "
"6612080","6618740"," We've got AR, June 17th, 36C for $936,000."
"6619700","6629660"," We have SP, there we have those AR, and then we've got OVV, Oscar Victor, Victor, July 15th, 55C"
"6629660","6633160"," for $808,000, another interesting trade."
"6635460","6640240"," So we'll see here, we'll see here, looks like it's basing right now. "
"6640620","6643000"," I don't see a lot of resistance here."
"6644020","6650980"," This is a tough call right here to see if we can get to 445 into the bell or at"
"6650980","6652740"," least to try to tag that 445 above."
"6653860","6655320"," But the sellers are weaker here. "
"6655420","6657160"," You can see it on the right-hand side."
"6657320","6658000"," It's weak."
"6658840","6660760"," Oh, we have to 444 and 445. "
"6662280","6665720"," I want to call that, but I can't just yet."
"6667040","6675660"," Can't just yet call that that attempt, maybe 444.40 as an attempt."
"6676520","6683040"," There's still interest in, there's still interest in calls. "
"6683280","6688360"," There's still, there's now 180,000 calls on 442."
"6690080","6693480"," So we'll see, we'll see if we get that squeeze higher here."
"6694560","6695820"," Looks like we might catch it. "
"6697440","6699900"," Yeah, now we've got 179,000."
"6700060","6701900"," We're actually getting calls added in currently."
"6702720","6703800"," So something's up. "
"6704340","6705100"," Probably a squeeze."
"6729130","6730730"," We'll see how high we can get here."
"6734190","6735690"," Can't call it here for some reason. "
"6736290","6737110"," Can't see it."
"6737250","6738650"," Like the, usually it's defined."
"6741730","6749900"," You can see a little wall of sellers here at 443.30. It's kind of a mixed bag in here. "
"6751060","6751800"," Tough call."
"6757370","6762130"," Maybe drop for some more, maybe we drop slightly to get some more support."
"6762870","6765470"," More, more commitment from buyers. "
"6767370","6768270"," Tough to call."
"6769150","6770550"," Buyers certainly in control."
"6771170","6771690"," Need another push. "
"6772790","6773510"," Need more, more money."
"6774410","6777310"," Need more, need more believers that were going higher."
"6797660","6805320"," So you guys, what we're looking at here, 444.40 price target. "
"6825570","6827490"," Get a little help from market makers."
"6835970","6837770"," Awked up, pimping 5% for the day."
"6837910","6838570"," Good job, good job. "
"6842810","6843910"," They can see where they are above."
"6848490","6858410"," And see where they're hiding up there, right there, right there, right there, right there."
"6858630","6861190"," Hiding in here, right there. "
"6863670","6866650"," And you can kind of see that end right there."
"6867870","6869430"," For 4, 440."
"6871330","6873150"," Just like traffic all the way up. "
"6873730","6875030"," Have to grind it all at 445."
"6880410","6882010"," And ball leaves."
"6883430","6888370"," Sellers and ball leaves at 445.90 up in here. "
"6903470","6908550"," And the QQ's can close the gap at 349."
"6909350","6910070"," It becomes boss."
"6911030","6915450"," Turns P and go low archpamp and yep, hell yeah, you believe. "
"6917130","6920330"," Josh, seeing isn't believing, believing is seeing."
"6921570","6923050"," I believe it's back and fly."
"6926350","6927510"," Guys are hilarious. "
"6933190","6936370"," Hey, you're welcome, Corey, right on, brother."
"6942040","6945760"," At least in some line I drew hilarious chase."
"6947300","6957180"," Now trading 443.44. My price target above is 444.40 with traffic. "
"6958580","6960600"," 445, you could get there."
"6962820","6966020"," But, you know, when I say earlier, it takes them off the table, let a few run."
"6966680","6967540"," It's free money. "
"6968820","6969740"," You've already earned it."
"6972600","6978600"," If you aren't in anything right now and you're looking for an entry point, just wait for a dip and"
"6978600","6980880"," grab something for the bell close."
"6982640","6983920"," There might be another dip in here. "
"6984040","6985380"," Hopefully there's another dip in here so you can get in."
"6986920","6988620"," Just been grinding straight up."
"6989580","6993280"," Do be conscious of something as we go here, just as we go up here, right?"
"6993840","6995460"," You can see this nice little move right here. "
"6997700","6999260"," It's nice little grind higher."
"6999700","7000880"," Quick for a little relief, right?"
"7001440","7002280"," Grind higher."
"7002600","7005960"," You might see that quick little relief and that grind higher. "
"7006280","7010160"," So if there's another chance at a quick relief, you can take that next run up."
"7010580","7012260"," It's been relentless the entire day."
"7012700","7015160"," This entire day has just been one full fucking blast off. "
"7015460","7016560"," Even this shit in here printed."
"7017160","7018620"," We're able to trade this all day long."
"7019080","7019940"," Easy day trade today. "
"7020360","7021360"," Easy day trade today."
"7022240","7023500"," Easy day trade today."
"7024640","7025940"," Easy dip buying today. "
"7027220","7028820"," All in all, just easy street."
"7030220","7032520"," So just be careful of this little move down."
"7032920","7035560"," Take another quick relief move down and then another pump higher. "
"7036300","7041440"," We're at 443.52. So just along the way, take your bread and run."
"7042080","7042900"," Take your money and run."
"7048320","7049640"," It is now 319. "
"7050200","7051760"," We've got 41 minutes left in the day."
"7055060","7057840"," Vic's now just just following the pieces over here."
"7057840","7059060"," Now down to 2189. "
"7060700","7065500"," Talked about wanting to see the VIX down around 2114 or something like that."
"7073950","7076010"," Think about the VIX when you're trading."
"7076730","7081140"," I want you to think about its implication. "
"7083300","7085880"," So when you guys were talking about what do we think is going to happen?"
"7086160","7086940"," What's going to happen tomorrow?"
"7087400","7090560"," What's going to happen Sunday and Monday?"
"7092740","7095700"," You can always also think about this in your mind."
"7095700","7096620"," You've got the VIX right."
"7101420","7103100"," This is getting bullish over here, right?"
"7112550","7113910"," Start the pieces together. "
"7115470","7116790"," That's kind of fucking wonky looking."
"7118030","7119930"," But I always think about the VIX in your trading spy."
"7120330","7121910"," Even when you're trading the queues, think about the VIX. "
"7123810","7125370"," Trading Tesla, think about the VIX."
"7131200","7133800"," Start to get a little bit of a better picture, right, of the VIX."
"7137320","7138460"," Doesn't it be perfect, right?"
"7139120","7145720"," But you can think to yourself, how much farther down can we go here before we catch on the bounce"
"7145720","7147620"," or before we break through?"
"7148260","7151720"," Let's say we can go down here, come back up here and then trade lower. "
"7152480","7155860"," Think about it if you're like, hey, if we're going to, let's see, a cap staring at a green day"
"7155860","7156180"," tomorrow."
"7159380","7163540"," Does the VIX sell off into Friday clothes so that it bounces back up for Monday?"
"7164540","7167440"," Or is it something where we have a negative Friday?"
"7168460","7172240"," Or we have a positive overnight, right?"
"7172400","7175880"," We got a big bar down and then we start selling off Friday, right?"
"7175980","7176860"," So we can come back above."
"7177360","7183680"," Think about the VIX's relationship to your ideas on where spy, where spy is going to be today"
"7183680","7184120"," tomorrow. "
"7184580","7188480"," And then, of course, the setup for Monday being green or red."
"7193780","7195440"," And you can kind of see it right there, right?"
"7198180","7200000"," This is setting up for bearish, right?"
"7200140","7201020"," This is a bear flag, right?"
"7201220","7201740"," Not a bull flag."
"7201740","7204840"," And then start to think about what bottom is, like where can we go?"
"7204980","7208900"," We start adding in, we know we've got some confirmed support down below in 1850. "
"7213360","7215300"," And think about Friday."
"7215540","7216720"," I keep saying Friday, but you know what I mean?"
"7216900","7220400"," Thursday and then Monday."
"7221580","7222680"," So keep that in your mind. "
"7223540","7231700"," Spy up 1.17% today, complied move today was 1.5%. Think about that now, too, right?"
"7231860","7236780"," We're bullish and we still are within the expected range of trading today."
"7237240","7245140"," Looks like it'll put us at somewhere between 4.44 and 4.4, 44.40 and 4.45. If we"
"7245140","7249020"," were to trade up to that 1.57, implied move for the day."
"7251960","7253860"," Add 1 plus 1 plus 2."
"7259910","7261490"," The beautiful move right there. "
"7286850","7290150"," So we can squinch this down a little bit, see where the sellers are above."
"7296950","7302510"," Yep, right up there, 4.45. You can see it on the right hand side here."
"7303890","7306210"," You can see right down here, the buyers down here. "
"7309940","7311020"," Currently, we have a buy program."
"7311380","7312620"," We have more buyers than sellers."
"7313980","7316700"," I don't know what the imbalance is, but it's definitely to the buy side. "
"7322780","7328480"," Now, trading 4.43.50, 4.3.53. Look at that, just blasting."
"7329220","7329780"," It's insane."
"7333440","7334800"," All right, cord just moves. "
"7343970","7350450"," Currently, more put buyers than call sellers or, excuse me, currently more put buyers than call"
"7350450","7350710"," buyers."
"7351710","7352510"," So what does this mean?"
"7352850","7355050"," I think Chase is asking why are we not rolling it over."
"7355930","7358150"," So yesterday, we had real money selling, right?"
"7359210","7360830"," Today, what are we talking about today?"
"7361070","7362530"," What do we say this morning at the start?"
"7362530","7365590"," We said we have more spy calls coming in. "
"7366730","7371310"," We said this is an opportunity for put buyers to reposition themselves."
"7372030","7376790"," I talked to you all day long and said today, this is a good place at 4.45 to 4 "
"7376790","7380510",".50 to place some put spreads, right?"
"7380790","7382990"," So you're like, why is the market not rolling over right now?"
"7383310","7383690"," It's not intended."
"7384090","7389350"," So you can be buying some puts that are dated for mid-April, late-April right now, right?"
"7389350","7394250"," You're able to replace some puts that are in the money, put spreads, and those will show up in the"
"7394250","7396410"," hero indicator, even though we're trading higher. "
"7397570","7399310"," They're looking for a print in the money."
"7400050","7403690"," You get some 4.45. Let's look them up a day with the print."
"7404310","7405950"," Let me look at my back and look some up right now. "
"7407670","7408490"," Let's look them up."
"7409490","7410310"," We're almost there."
"7411810","7412910"," Up the bears out a little bit. "
"7415430","7416530"," Let me two seconds here."
"7420610","7421770"," Okay, we're going to do some trades."
"7422490","7424070"," We're going to do the spy. "
"7427640","7429900"," We're going to month rate trade the spy."
"7430500","7431800"," So we're going to be bearish."
"7432920","7436420"," And we're going to pick a May 18. "
"7437580","7439680"," Okay, generate trades."
"7440100","7441460"," We know we'll have volatility as an 18."
"7441720","7442740"," There ain't no fuck away around it. "
"7443620","7444620"," Oh, that puts me."
"7444820","7448220"," Do I think we're coming back to retest 443 between now and March May 18?"
"7448840","7449920"," Fuck yes, we are."
"7450720","7451440"," Fuck yes. "
"7452020","7454040"," I don't give a fuck if we trade the 460."
"7454860","7458980"," We will fucking see 443 by May 18."
"7459660","7461980"," We might not see 420 or 400. "
"7463060","7465240"," But we will fucking see where we are right now."
"7465900","7467560"," So let's see if we can do this."
"7469560","7470380"," 444s, 443. "
"7470940","7472680"," We'll do 440 pairs."
"7472980","7473620"," That's actually pretty good."
"7473720","7473980"," Nice trade. "
"7474760","7476180"," Okay, so we'll look at that right now."
"7477960","7479280"," Okay, so this is a pretty good fucking trade."
"7480050","7482120"," Okay, so we're going to look over there. "
"7483120","7483720"," Here you go."
"7485380","7486280"," All right."
"7489870","7493050"," So this is a spy debit put spread. "
"7494130","7497810"," This expires on May 18."
"7498330","7500090"," See right here, expiry May 18."
"7500870","7503870"," It's a 440, 444 put spread. "
"7504350","7506990"," Do I think we're going to, oh, look, we're rolling over already."
"7507690","7509070"," If I can say something."
"7510750","7515770"," So the debit put spread is for, I said that 445 and 450 is a good time to place some"
"7515770","7516390"," puts, right?"
"7517130","7518930"," So between now and May 18. "
"7519210","7521150"," Do I think we'll, we'll see 440 and 444?"
"7521790","7522610"," Fuck yeah, I do."
"7523110","7523850"," You fucking right."
"7524210","7526830"," Coming into like crazy ass crazy. "
"7527210","7528710"," I think we could trade up 460 in April."
"7529070","7529990"," I don't give a fuck."
"7530610","7531810"," The only thing that I know, right?"
"7532550","7534430"," No is that we'll see 440 again. "
"7537510","7545610"," $143 prints, almost double, not almost, but, you know, it prints 198, 180 percent."
"7546510","7550790"," And if you're a trader, I'm an investor that can't stand by the computer all day long."
"7551450","7552470"," Not a bad fucking payout. "
"7554530","7555810"," Not a bad fucking payout."
"7556330","7561050"," $142, you, you, you, you, now it's $143."
"7561790","7565710"," Uh, there's 142 bucks to place that trade and you don't look at it. "
"7566910","7568870"," And I don't give a fuck if we go to 460."
"7569930","7572450"," That fucking, it's coming to fuck back down to 440."
"7572770","7574810"," I guarantee it by May 18. "
"7575030","7577590"," Now it might not be down at 400 or 4,000 then."
"7578230","7581770"," Uh, but it'll be there, I may, I may, I might even do the 18th."
"7581850","7585290"," I might do like the, the, maybe the store, maybe the date before the 18th. "
"7585710","7586510"," Somewhere in there."
"7586610","7587630"," It's pretty fucking good trade."
"7588510","7592270"," Fucking trade does, we could come up here and come straight back down here. "
"7592630","7594630"," We come up here and just touch right here."
"7595770","7596750"," And you're going to print."
"7597610","7599330"," And this shows the implied move. "
"7599890","7601890"," This shows the implied move, right?"
"7602190","7608130"," You've got a, you've got a, you've got an implied move that we're going to actually do all-time"
"7608130","7609930"," highs for now May, May 18th."
"7610830","7611830"," I fucking doubt it."
"7614210","7619310"," Now this says I'm only going to have 47% chance of probably the profit, but this thing, this is,"
"7619430","7620790"," this thing isn't a smart AI. "
"7621090","7624090"," It's just a simple AI for the implied move for bears and bulls."
"7624590","7627930"," If you're a bear though, the implied move is right in the fucking money down here."
"7628090","7630610"," 250 or at 425, right?"
"7631290","7632090"," And that's what we talked about, right?"
"7632250","7634650"," We should get 420 into May 18th. "
"7634730","7635450"," And this seems reasonable."
"7636450","7637650"," So that's a, that's a beautiful trade."
"7637910","7639190"," I think that's a beautiful trade and maybe we're wrong. "
"7639750","7642610"," And the cool part is, right?"
"7642970","7645830"," That if you're selling and buying a put, right?"
"7646710","7652710"," If you take this trade on some, if you, on some brokers, as well as the inflation data this week"
"7652710","7654630"," was high, but not that surprising."
"7655290","7660810"," If we trade higher, if we trade higher here, you can cut one side loose, right?"
"7661450","7665050"," If we trade higher for part of this, you can cut the put that you're selling."
"7665830","7667470"," And then hold on to the put that you bought. "
"7668030","7671470"," And you'll, you'll win both sides of the trade on a put spread."
"7672210","7675810"," Now, I think there's another opportunity by call spreads, believe it or not, even in this, even in"
"7675810","7680890"," this regime, you can still, there's still another chance to buy call spread and hold both to print"
"7680890","7683350"," between now and May, believe it or not."
"7683770","7688210"," I think you can get another call spread print, not April, and hold a put spread right now. "
"7688210","7688550"," That's what I was saying."
"7688710","7694390"," That will continue with this plan for rate hikes, reducing accommodation to get inflation."
"7694390","7695170"," That prints out cool. "
"7695170","7703220"," So, there's an opportunity."
"7703440","7708640"," Your first opportunity, bulls are bears, we're at 4.40. It's all our CPIs, pretty much the peak."
"7712700","7716980"," One note, there's a lot of, there's a lot of, even though we're rolling over slightly right here,"
"7717100","7719640"," there's a nice premium on calls right now. "
"7720340","7721300"," Beautiful premium call."
"7721480","7724180"," All I'm saying is forecasting inflation is peaked and we'll start to fall."
"7728720","7729500"," One more note as well. "
"7729740","7735260"," This morning at the bell, what number, what strike did I call out to you this morning at the bell?"
"7735260","7741720"," It's called out 443 for 19 cents, I think, or 30 cents or something."
"7742420","7743580"," Currently trading at 70%."
"7743580","7746200"," Oh, it's been a support of 50 basis point hike in May. "
"7751030","7753190"," Currently trading it, 53 cents."
"7753430","7754770"," So, I think it was 19 cents the first time."
"7754990","7756250"," Yeah, it was 19 cents. "
"7757550","7759450"," Now, trading at 73 cents."
"7759710","7763370"," That is a 400% option on the day."
"7770380","7775920"," All I'm saying is first 50 basis point hike in May and possibly more in June and July. "
"7779210","7785130"," So, once it gets to above the neutral by the latter half of the year."
"7789190","7791710"," Yeah, the 443's were 19 or 20 cents."
"7791890","7792830"," You're going to walk in a disability. "
"7793130","7794030"," It was lowest 13 cents."
"7794330","7802730"," Now, now worth 70, 88 cents right now, 88 cents, 400% print."
"7804090","7804490"," You're welcome. "
"7810680","7816660"," Now, they're worth 90 cents, almost coming into a 500% print for the day."
"7823330","7826310"," It's a 500% print if you weren't buying and selling all the way up."
"7840390","7841190"," Yes, sir. "
"7847270","7848150"," 443 baby."
"7853590","7854870"," You see that, right?"
"7855010","7855430"," Your wife's boyfriend?"
"7867770","7870910"," My wife's down with the pressure and prices in coming months."
"7872550","7876190"," Iron mortgage rates will have a bite on how much people can pay for houses. "
"7880990","7887070"," 443's now a dollar, one, 500% burr, baby, burr."
"7890810","7891470"," All right, I just sold."
"7896290","7897250"," Thank you very much. "
"7900450","7901490"," All right."
"7904910","7907970"," 444.40, still that price target we're looking for."
"7908930","7911730"," Sometimes you'll get the creepy crawlies up in the close to 445. "
"7912710","7919330"," If we see that creepy crawlie up in the close, you might see some pretty good pretty good chance"
"7919330","7923170"," trying to get past all those sellers, trap those sellers into tomorrow."
"7926390","7927990"," Just smashing and blasting."
"7928950","7930690"," So, it came in with a gun's blasting. "
"7930690","7931730"," Blah, blah, blah."
"7932630","7936450"," Well, I was saying it's completely feasible to avert a recession."
"7945840","7949060"," You also have, uh, so here's another thing to be peeking at, right?"
"7949340","7953880"," Everybody was on the 4.42s. They were at 72 cents to one point. "
"7954220","7955980"," And now they're dollar 84, it's like 100% print."
"7956640","7957720"," Had you gone one strike out?"
"7958300","7960740"," You made three times, four times."
"7960800","7964240"," Pull back in demand for labor and not have a big impact on jobs. "
"7971320","7972120"," I got to eat."
"7973180","7974340"," Michael's like, yeet."
"7976680","7981060"," I, uh, sold my, I sold my, uh, my calls just now. "
"7981240","7982360"," The ones that I had, the runners I had."
"7986470","7990350"," Yeah, I said the, uh, the rates rolled over at the end of the day today, but, uh, for 20"
"7990350","7992250"," minutes ago, we heard that the rates rolled over."
"7994420","8002270"," Now trading 443.90. Give me that squeeze, baby. "
"8003070","8004330"," Give me that squeeze higher."
"8005690","8009670"," Waller saying he doesn't see any value in trying to shock the markets in order to get inflation"
"8009670","8010230"," down."
"8010950","8012690"," It doesn't want to shock the market. "
"8013210","8013870"," The shocker."
"8014830","8023870"," That's the top there at 446.99. Uh, 445 is where technically we should have 445."
"8025850","8027070"," So I guess I'll put that on there. "
"8028310","8033210"," Uh, but what I, what, what I see a lot of some sellers up there, some weird sellers hiding up"
"8033210","8033550"," in here."
"8035050","8044840"," So we'll see if we can get up here to that"
"8044840","8045080"," 440."
"8049120","8049480"," Right. "
"8049540","8050240"," See right here?"
"8050520","8051540"," He's hitting sellers right here."
"8052380","8054500"," Yeah, there's a little bit of, see this, see that right there."
"8055080","8055500"," They're in there. "
"8057540","8058620"," See him hiding right here."
"8060860","8061740"," And then that 445."
"8064240","8065820"," This is the last band of sellers. "
"8066140","8066880"," See him hiding down here."
"8067640","8069140"," Let's have 440, 440 number."
"8076980","8079800"," Can I buy one more rep if we can, if we can get one more rep. "
"8082780","8084740"," Um, if we can get one more rip in here."
"8088310","8092970"," I don't know what's going on with this fucking right here."
"8096850","8098950"," I might, you know what I might, I might grab some of this. "
"8100590","8111950"," There's a"
"8111950","8113490"," little bit of light selling going on."
"8113710","8119710"," So this right here, uh, might look for maybe a little bit more."
"8119910","8120670"," What time is it right now?"
"8120670","8123110"," 337, maybe like 340. "
"8124410","8125790"," Keep an eye on this right here."
"8126930","8128170"," Nice little tweezer move."
"8131840","8132880"," Give it a minute to breathe. "
"8133880","8135420"," I might have to turn one more trade with you."
"8136520","8137860"," Give it just a second here."
"8139440","8141020"," Might just blast off too. "
"8142180","8144400"," Might, might just be no fucking, no quarter."
"8153470","8154670"," Let me see it up here."
"8165210","8170110"," Well, there's an economy, we'll be able to withstand aggressive, fed actions. "
"8171930","8173730"," Okay, so what's the plan for sorting, right?"
"8173730","8174430"," Good time for aggressive action."
"8174510","8176930"," So I have the Fed because the economy can take it."
"8177650","8182050"," The only thing you want to be thinking about right now is placement with put spreads, if you're a"
"8182050","8182150"," bear. "
"8183990","8185390"," Right, we talked about it this morning, right?"
"8186110","8186530"," Just placement."
"8187070","8189890"," You can buy some spreads today and it doesn't matter where you rip to tomorrow."
"8189890","8197250"," If you put them on an account that you don't stare at every day, we should get some weakness into"
"8197250","8197770"," next week. "
"8198650","8204389"," Then we should get a nice rip as well for the end of the month or sideways trade for ER"
"8204389","8204850"," season."
"8205969","8208490"," And then we should start selling off into May, right?"
"8208629","8211270"," We know that we're going to sell off into May at some point."
"8212510","8213410"," Spreads of your friend here. "
"8213770","8218170"," Spreads of the kind of thing right here where you can go higher and you can be in put spreads."
"8220950","8221430"," Great."
"8222549","8227230"," We know that we can still liquidate the market here and those will print between now and May. "
"8229230","8231770"," You know that we could trade to 450 tomorrow."
"8232010","8234549"," You could buy 445p spreads, right?"
"8234790","8238990"," To 440 speed or 440, 445p spreads for May."
"8239510","8241410"," And it's not going to fucking matter if we trade to 450. "
"8241969","8243570"," It's still coming fucking back down."
"8243969","8245650"," We all fucking know it's coming back down."
"8246090","8247670"," Everybody knows it gets coming back down. "
"8247670","8249510"," So they can't horseshoes and hand grenades."
"8250350","8254730"," If you miss the short today and you like to come back tomorrow and say, cap, I should have bought"
"8254730","8258830"," those fucking spreads yesterday or cap, I knew I should have shorted."
"8259350","8261469"," You know, you don't, why bother with the, why, who cares?"
"8262030","8263110"," Just buy some fucking put spreads. "
"8263990","8271170"," Talk by, buy put spreads that are 450, 445c, excuse me, for, for May."
"8271889","8273870"," And even if it goes up tomorrow, it's going to come back down anyways."
"8274690","8279490"," You know, do I think we're going to, I think, do I think we're going to see 444 before May,"
"8279629","8280469"," May 18th?"
"8280870","8280969"," Yes. "
"8281930","8282850"," Yes, I do."
"8283850","8285930"," So you can just buy them right in the money right now."
"8286250","8290549"," If you're like, if you're like dying and put a trade on, get some put spreads. "
"8291910","8293290"," Can, do I think we can go up from here?"
"8293389","8293549"," Sure."
"8294950","8296629"," Do I think we can squeeze them from here?"
"8296709","8296870"," Sure."
"8297049","8297830"," But what do you fucking care?"
"8298370","8299170"," They're fucking put spreads. "
"8300110","8301990"," They're not fucking calls or puts that you're holding."
"8302389","8303270"," They fucking will print."
"8305190","8311370"," If you're looking for a place to buy call spreads, I think we can go lower next week, early next"
"8311370","8314070"," week, Monday, Tuesday, down days, bloodbath. "
"8315190","8317370"," And we can buy some, we, those put spreads, they'll print."
"8317770","8319850"," And you can buy some call spreads down there for April."
"8321830","8324770"," As I, it, this market's so easy to trade right now with spreads. "
"8326030","8327730"," And what, we're in a negative gam environment."
"8328110","8330230"," Every fucking three days, we're up and down a hundred points."
"8333270","8336370"," If they ain't printing today, they're going to print some time this week or next week. "
"8341049","8346709"," More money has been going in and coming out."
"8346910","8348590"," How does he think the economy will handle that?"
"8350850","8352750"," What's, I don't know the context of that."
"8353830","8356230"," Why bother with normal point puts where we are?"
"8358010","8360250"," There's no, there's no reason to buy puts right here. "
"8361870","8362670"," There's no need."
"8366150","8370110"," The only, the only time the, the only time is a good time to buy like straight up calls or"
"8370110","8372790"," puts is inter-day day trading."
"8373549","8376790"," Other than that, put on some spreads, sit back and relax. "
"8378090","8379930"," And come back tomorrow and day trade it."
"8380670","8383910"," There's plenty of money we made and puts inter-day."
"8386610","8388230"," What's the, uh, Floyd, I missed that. "
"8388670","8390290"," More money has been going in than coming out."
"8390530","8392030"," How does he think the economy will handle that?"
"8393130","8394890"," Yeah, you're fucking QE."
"8395050","8395890"," Is that what you're talking about?"
"8397610","8398050"," Excellent. "
"8398350","8398930"," He's back in existence."
"8399890","8401030"," Yeah, they did that dude."
"8401230","8402590"," They were pumping fucking oil trade. "
"8403230","8404950"," Everybody's pumping the oil trade right now."
"8406530","8407810"," Everybody's pumping the oil trade."
"8409290","8413650"," I'm, I'm looking at the oil trade with fucking, my eyes are all squinty on it. "
"8420090","8423990"," I get, I get the reason, I get the reason for it."
"8424760","8429050"," But man, I understand the oil trade."
"8431290","8432190"," I get it. "
"8433670","8436370"," Man, that shit looks like distribution so bad."
"8438270","8439990"," I understand the oil trade."
"8441190","8443510"," USO is fucking rippin today. "
"8445850","8447430"," And it's looking hella fucking bullish."
"8447690","8449330"," Even where it's at right now, it's looking hella bullish."
"8454670","8461430"," I shouldn't be so doubtful of the oil trade anymore. "
"8462470","8464550"," The trade was such a good fucking trade."
"8464830","8472830"," Now I'm like, I don't know, maybe unless, unless they, unless GDP is going to go up, to like, it's"
"8472830","8475610"," a trap, so that's spidey sense shit."
"8476130","8479030"," Nothing won't go up, and I'm probably wrong in this. "
"8480630","8482470"," I'm so suspect of it right now."
"8485590","8487610"," A little bit of roll going on spy real quick."
"8490650","8492030"," Bull's taking some profit here. "
"8513480","8517220"," We bought some, uh, 444 for 39 put spreads for June."
"8517560","8518020"," I don't know."
"8518720","8520380"," I'll be honest, I'm going to be honest with you. "
"8520820","8523360"," If those start printing at all, I'd close them out."
"8524060","8525020"," I won't be honest with you."
"8525100","8530200"," The moment that we might get that a breakdown in May 18th, right?"
"8530200","8533360"," Think about this, you'll get the breakdown after May 18th after OPEX. "
"8534020","8539020"," You should get a breakdown, but I would as, I'm going to tell you here that, uh, the next retest"
"8539020","8543120"," of highs is probably going to come in June."
"8544180","8550040"," You're probably going to see a test of, if not all time highs, you'll definitely see 460."
"8550760","8557540"," If it's down from 4,000, just, just if you place that trade, just make sure that you close it"
"8557540","8558500"," out before we get to June. "
"8559180","8561200"," I wouldn't, I wouldn't hold them into June."
"8561200","8564680"," Cause that, my thought is that we might have to finally get that low."
"8564880","8570300"," Let's say you get the low at 4,000 in like May 20th or 25th or 8th or something stupid"
"8570300","8570840"," like that. "
"8571360","8580100"," I think you're then going to see a huge, huge, uh, face rip and fucking rally, uh, in May."
"8580520","8584180"," I think, I think in May, or not May, but in June sometimes."
"8584540","8587500"," So if those, if those, if you put them on right now, it's fine. "
"8587500","8592140"," If you get any kind of a print out of it, like 20%, 50% or something, take the money"
"8592140","8592460"," and run."
"8593020","8595900"," Think about it when you're, uh, your, your, your closer date."
"8596080","8598520"," Cause I think that you, I think you're just so good. "
"8598620","8602420"," I think in June, I think if we get tipped out of 4,000, you're going to fucking get a"
"8602420","8604480"," face rip or like 600 straight points up."
"8605540","8607500"," Like you think the last rally was good."
"8607700","8610340"," You wait until you, you wait until you hit 4,000. "
"8611920","8614340"," There's going to be a massive fucking rally off 4,000."
"8615820","8619640"," If you're going to get a rally off 4,000, you're going to get a rally off of 4,000."
"8620260","8625200"," Uh, we'll still sell down below 4,000 later on, but you're going to get a rally. "
"8625380","8626620"," You're going to get a reaction, I promise."
"8627360","8628320"," I'll fucking tell you this."
"8628540","8628660"," Okay. "
"8629140","8635520"," If you hit 400 or 4,000, 3,000, 2,000, 1,000, you're going to get a reaction."
"8636260","8638900"," You're going to get algorithmic fucking full on buying."
"8640060","8647760"," Now trading the 440.04. We have, uh, just a little bit more to go. "
"8647880","8649640"," Just got to squeeze mode just a little bit more, right?"
"8650580","8651780"," Just going to squeeze them up here."
"8651780","8652980"," It's 4, 44, 40."
"8653880","8656220"," Called this price target down here somewhere. "
"8657160","8658900"," Uh, so we'll see."
"8659340","8660040"," Maybe it was over here."
"8660180","8660600"," I don't remember. "
"8661080","8662060"," It was somewhere down in here."
"8663320","8665140"," Trading up 4, 44, 40."
"8665600","8667480"," We have 14 minutes left to the bell. "
"8667480","8669300"," Talked about the creepy crawly up, right?"
"8669440","8674280"," Do we get the creepy crawly, uh, climb the wall of fear into the bell here?"
"8674740","8679420"," If we can tag this 4, 44, 40 or even 4, 45, uh, into the bell."
"8680120","8681640"," Uh, very strong close."
"8681880","8683520"," So right now, think about this too, right?"
"8684080","8686800"," Uh, this is a bullish close, right?"
"8687020","8691260"," It's currently, if we were selling like face, rip, and sell off right now, uh, it'd be a weak"
"8691260","8691560"," close. "
"8691840","8693500"," But just so you're just heads up to you."
"8693980","8696980"," This is a bullish close, uh, on intraday charts."
"8696980","8701940"," And we might have to look forward to this into, uh, tomorrow with more puts. "
"8702220","8705240"," As a matter of fact, only half of the puts are being closed today."
"8705580","8708160"," We still have another half of them to be closed tomorrow."
"8713200","8715140"," This is a bullish close right now. "
"8719080","8719780"," 443s, man."
"8720080","8720760"," Hell, yes."
"8724440","8728800"," We have Tesla calls coming in right now, April 14, 1050c. "
"8729580","8730960"," That's our second price target."
"8730960","8734940"," We had 1020 is the first and then 1050 as the second price target."
"8735220","8742480"," We have spy calls coming in right now, April 29th, 444c, $934,000. "
"8744240","8746120"," April 29th, and that does make sense."
"8746920","8752060"," Like if we get some weakness next week and then we, we rip it up into the end of April"
"8752740","8760360"," and, uh, then, and then we sell it back down into, um, sell it back down into May 18th."
"8764400","8765480"," So think about this way. "
"8765560","8769580"," You get another dip to buy for another run in April."
"8772920","8775920"," And then we're going to get some weakness into May 18th."
"8778040","8783340"," We're the week after the week he talks about and then we'll get, uh, a big push up in June. "
"8783760","8784400"," That would be the expectation."
"8784820","8785660"," Something, something like that."
"8789990","8792250"," Are they going to give me 444 or 40 or not?"
"8794480","8796900"," Looks like lots of just profit taking a squeeze higher. "
"8810890","8819770"," Uh, what I think is this, I think, I think, I think you have to look at this perspective."
"8820150","8821630"," We talked about this all day long, right?"
"8821810","8825150"," That we're in an area that you can buy some put spreads and they're probably going to print at some"
"8825150","8825430"," point."
"8826750","8831830"," Uh, we're also in an area where I think, yeah, do I think Mark goes up and down, even though"
"8831830","8833390"," we're in negative again, I think it goes up and down. "
"8833490","8837270"," I think that you're going to get some weakness between now and the end of April to buy a nice"
"8837270","8838690"," fat run to the end of April."
"8839230","8842090"," And then I think you're going to see a sell down in May."
"8842730","8847550"," Do I think that we just fucking traded the depths of hell, uh, tomorrow, and it's just relentless"
"8847550","8849230"," straight down for a month and a half?"
"8849230","8854290"," No, Texas Governor Abbott to hold some Mexican vehicle inspections. "
"8854810","8859930"," So the easy thing for, and this is the way he has the cleaning about these Texas government"
"8859930","8864830"," inspections at the border saying that they were increasing cost."
"8866330","8866990"," All right."
"8867170","8868390"," They gave me 44411. "
"8868390","8869010"," Let's take it."
"8870390","8873410"," So, uh, let's look at, let's look at a chart, a larger chart."
"8875510","8877210"," There's selling off right here real quick. "
"8877910","8881070"," Uh, we've got, what, 10 minutes left."
"8886450","8890650"," So, it's looking a large time frame."
"8893470","8894990"," It's about 10 minutes to go to the close. "
"8895350","8896090"," They're closing on balance."
"8896470","8898730"," It's hovering around 400 million to the sell side."
"8899730","8902730"," I'll be careful that we got a sell side going in close. "
"8902950","8903190"," Not much."
"8903730","8905410"," So here's 400 down here."
"8908810","8910450"," Here's that retest down below. "
"8910710","8912610"," We still have to do the retest down here, right?"
"8912770","8914590"," If we do the retest, right?"
"8916830","8920830"," This is, we'll do, we'll put a drawing in here for a vertical line."
"8921730","8925610"," This is May, this is May 2nd right here, right?"
"8928790","8936730"," So, I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility for us to, uh, trade, because it's a nice"
"8936730","8937710"," little relief rally, right?"
"8938530","8940370"," No call buyers stepping in."
"8940490","8942370"," This is all just market makers doing this shit, right?"
"8946640","8947860"," We get some weakness, right?"
"8950920","8952200"," We might even tag down here. "
"8953960","8956440"," Trade higher, back to this line over here, right?"
"8964330","8966470"," Boom, you get, there's a 17th right here."
"8966550","8967430"," Maybe it's somewhere like this."
"8968790","8970830"," That's the 18th of May, right?"
"8970830","8972350"," And then boom, that expiry is over. "
"8972630","8974790"," Blast down, hit that 400."
"8975530","8977730"," Crazy selling for a week, right?"
"8977810","8979150"," That we get into June, right?"
"8980010","8981790"," And we start, we blast off higher up here."
"8982430","8983530"," It's something like this. "
"8984070","8986190"," Something, I see something like this happening."
"8987530","8990010"," I'm fucking this up right now, time frame wise."
"8990210","8996370"," I'll try to, I'll try to, I'll do this over here, over here for you, so you can see what"
"8996370","8998390"," I think is going to happen between now and May. "
"8998390","9003410"," But even so, we could go up tomorrow to 450, still sell off a little bit."
"9003550","9005170"," There goes your put spreads printing, right?"
"9006090","9010150"," We could still liquidate the market and call spreads will print over here."
"9010530","9013950"," I don't think fucking calls print over here until June. "
"9015790","9016690"," Does that make sense?"
"9016990","9023250"," But I wouldn't want to have put spreads dated for June expiry down here and hold them to expiry and"
"9023250","9024950"," have the market blast back up in June."
"9026630","9030010"," So timing or dating is important in calls and puts."
"9030490","9032730"," It's easier for you to buy some put spreads up here. "
"9033170","9036550"," And it's easier for you to buy call spreads anywhere down in here, right?"
"9037190","9039830"," Put spreads up here, call spreads down here."
"9040670","9042890"," And then day trade, the rest of it over here."
"9043330","9048170"," All day trading, once you, maybe each time you press these or buy these things, right?"
"9048710","9051710"," You can day trade, enter day trade, be bearish and bulls at the same time. "
"9051710","9055450"," And we're getting to that place where we're getting up here where you can put them on."
"9057570","9062890"," And I think if we hit 4000, I think we'll make a giant rally."
"9064290","9066250"," It's just like this rally down here, right?"
"9067070","9069410"," See these monster moves down, giant rally. "
"9070250","9072310"," Another test down below, giant rally."
"9072850","9074050"," I think it's easy for us."
"9074630","9077930"," Even when we go down, you guys got to remember that there's going to be another reaction. "
"9079110","9081810"," Okay, so let's even look at it from here."
"9081930","9083750"," Let's say we go down one more time over here."
"9085590","9093470"," And let's say the tag is, it sucks to do this on spy because ES offers a better price target. "
"9094150","9096190"," You can kind of see it's all conferencing over here, right?"
"9097490","9099050"," Kind of see it's all conferenced."
"9099350","9104710"," Bam, the bam, right down here, like 393400 in May and then we rocket ship up higher."
"9105890","9107550"," I'll do this on an ES chart for you. "
"9109490","9113130"," Um, later on, but that's the plan for me."
"9113250","9114430"," That's the plan that I'm sticking to."
"9115810","9116830"," So just be conscious. "
"9117170","9118250"," Buy some put spreads up here."
"9119510","9120430"," You can buy them today."
"9120490","9121190"," You can buy them tomorrow. "
"9121750","9122970"," Fifty fucking believe it or not."
"9123790","9126230"," We can go to 450 and ain't got to fucking matter."
"9126410","9126950"," It's still going to print. "
"9127950","9130170"," And look for those moments to buy call spreads."
"9130410","9131050"," You know where they are."
"9132490","9133350"," You know where they are. "
"9133410","9135810"," We show you the market breadth indicator when you buy call spreads."
"9136550","9137250"," We're not quite there yet."
"9139470","9140550"," But we'll get there soon. "
"9140730","9141050"," We'll get there."
"9141770","9142630"," We should get there."
"9142730","9142950"," Excuse me. "
"9142990","9146290"," We should get there soon."
"9147830","9149770"," We should get there like next week at some point."
"9153850","9156910"," And if we don't get there, we're just going to day trade it. "
"9156990","9157610"," Make money that way."
"9163850","9164210"," Fuck."
"9164530","9167630"," No, I'm going to warn every single one of you out there right now. "
"9167770","9167910"," Okay."
"9168770","9170250"," I'm going to warn every single one of you."
"9170390","9171330"," Mark my fucking words. "
"9172750","9174630"," I want you to remember something."
"9174890","9175050"," Okay."
"9175850","9177470"," I'm going to warn you of something. "
"9178750","9181610"," The moment we hit 4,000 right."
"9183410","9185170"," Do not be caught short."
"9186170","9188590"," Do I think we can trade below 4,000?"
"9188870","9189350"," Fuck yeah. "
"9190430","9195230"," I am warning you that when we hit 4,000, you're going to get a reaction."
"9196750","9202290"," I'm going to tell you right now that that market is now that selloff is going to get bought."
"9203350","9206610"," Do not get caught short at 4,000. "
"9206790","9207710"," You can let a bank do it."
"9208170","9210070"," You can ride it all the way down to 4,000."
"9211010","9216150"," But if you think I'm going to be fucking short, end of 4,000 fucking smoking crack bra. "
"9217450","9218330"," No way."
"9219770","9220910"," No fucking way."
"9221690","9223710"," Matter of fact, and you can tell you about that shit. "
"9224630","9226290"," And you've got a good lesson for you."
"9227490","9228330"," Ask Chase."
"9229670","9231230"," It's not that we ain't going lower. "
"9232710","9235550"," It's that you take profit for the next leg down."
"9236270","9238670"," Chase can attest to this."
"9240010","9246650"," When we make new lows like that, and on such a huge number, if you hit 4,000, trust me,"
"9246970","9248010"," you're going to get a reaction. "
"9249330","9251290"," Now do we trade lower than that down the road?"
"9251530","9251610"," Sure."
"9251830","9252510"," I'm open to that trade."
"9253510","9253710"," I am. "
"9254030","9254790"," I just don't."
"9255150","9258570"," Do I think you're going to blast through 4,000 down to like 360 that day?"
"9258810","9259310"," Or even that week?"
"9259790","9260370"," Fuck, no."
"9261010","9263710"," You're going to get a massive oversold bot. "
"9264330","9267230"," You're going to get a massive market reaction saying no."
"9273390","9274270"," All right."
"9274550","9275610"," Oh, Dave, contrarian. "
"9278930","9282330"," So maybe this might be a good place to buy some lotos for tomorrow."
"9283590","9285470"," Let's take a look for some lotos."
"9285690","9285910"," What we got?"
"9286190","9287910"," It's 3.57. We got three minutes left. "
"9289110","9289930"," Let me take a look here."
"9292680","9294160"," You guys want some lotos for tomorrow?"
"9295080","9296360"," Let's have a look at some lotos."
"9297080","9298180"," April 14th. "
"9298940","9300780"," Oh, there's a lot of interest in lotos for tomorrow."
"9301320","9303820"," Hey, everybody's on 445 C's."
"9304980","9306500"," I agree with that trade. "
"9307420","9313320"," 448, 445, 95 cents for lotos for tomorrow."
"9315260","9317220"," 446 or only 62 cents though."
"9318920","9319700"," Those are cheap. "
"9321740","9322820"," We're bang for the boat."
"9331150","9332530"," So I bought some lotos."
"9332650","9335450"," I bought some lotos for tomorrow. "
"9336830","9342710"," If you want to know what I think for tomorrow before the bell rings, I think that I think that"
"9342710","9343250"," we gap up."
"9343370","9344430"," I'm not positive on that."
"9344450","9345470"," We could be weak tomorrow. "
"9346290","9348290"," But no matter what, I think we're going up tomorrow."
"9348670","9350930"," I think that we could trade down tomorrow."
"9353850","9355770"," We could even trade down off the bell tomorrow. "
"9357150","9363130"," But right now for the puts, everybody knows the puts are coming off today, that they came off"
"9363130","9363410"," today."
"9363890","9365030"," They're going to come off tomorrow."
"9367110","9371730"," I would think that I would think that we trade higher tomorrow too. "
"9371910","9373490"," So I'll take that bet."
"9373890","9374610"," I could lose this bet."
"9374790","9376350"," I'm not like the most confident in it. "
"9377230","9387560"," But I'm going to take the bet that we trade up overnight and then probably"
"9387560","9389600"," sell Friday."
"9390940","9392960"," They won't give you a second day of..."
"9392960","9399940"," My favorite for tomorrow is instead of this, tell us beautiful action all day long."
"9400560","9401680"," That they'll just push it up tomorrow. "
"9402740","9404480"," And you won't be able to trade this tomorrow."
"9404960","9410900"," I could be wrong on this trade, but I could be wrong on this trade, but my thought is that"
"9410900","9411720"," we still trade higher."
"9411920","9413380"," We're close to resistance right now. "
"9414000","9415840"," So this whole rally could be over."
"9418780","9423780"," I want to see if we trade this up into tomorrow."
"9424160","9425180"," I want to see if we can trade that up. "
"9430980","9433180"," About 30 seconds to closing down in New York."
"9433900","9438760"," I'm going to add some more here."
"9443560","9445560"," At the bell, we got calls on Baba. "
"9452790","9455030"," So I do think that we trade this up tomorrow."
"9455170","9456010"," I think we gap it up tomorrow."
"9456690","9457570"," I don't know if we gap. "
"9457730","9460390"," If we gap up too high, we could sell off right at the open."
"9460630","9464290"," But I think they're going to rob you of this trade."
"9464790","9467130"," You might not get this trade like all day. "
"9467190","9469550"," You might not get this tomorrow, right?"
"9470870","9473790"," You might get this tomorrow, but I think what they're going to do is they're going to do it"
"9473790","9474070"," tonight."
"9475170","9476090"," Something like that."
"9477390","9478050"," Maybe sideways. "
"9479150","9482910"," And then they sell it off into the bell, profit taking in the bell."
"9483190","9484110"," That's what I think happens."
"9485590","9486350"," But I could be wrong. "
"9486890","9488570"," Okay, so I hope you all had a wonderful day today."
"9488570","9495450"," It's 4 p.m. I'll catch back up with you tomorrow."

"9506230","9509490"," If you're losing money, I would say to you to paper trade with me."
"9510030","9511930"," So that you can get comfortable."
"9512570","9514350"," You don't have to actually trade it with live money. "

"9532790","9537210"," I'll see you guys tomorrow morning like 8.39. If there ain't no fucking news tomorrow, well, we do"
"9537210","9537810"," have some news tomorrow."
"9537950","9539330"," No, yeah, we get some news tomorrow."
"9539870","9542610"," We've got fucking retail sales at 8.30. I forgot about that. "
"9542750","9543390"," We could get a dip."
"9543630","9548070"," Matter of fact, we could gap up overnight, fucking dip this shit down, and then buy it."
"9548090","9550810"," This might be a futures trader's Globex trade for the night. "
"9551250","9555790"," We could see like big up night, sell off in the morning, and then another rip or a face rip"
"9555790","9556310"," into the clothes."
"9556470","9557750"," I forgot about retail sales tomorrow."
"9558230","9558790"," That's a big one. "
"9559690","9563590"," But if retail sales are good tomorrow, we're going to fucking, I'll tell you what, if retail sales"
"9563590","9566590"," are good tomorrow, we're going to fucking blast off to 450 tomorrow."
"9566950","9567910"," I'll base it on that."
"9568450","9570470"," Good retail sales numbers, we're going high. "
"9572130","9576070"," Bad retail sales numbers will go up overnight and then sell it off for the open tomorrow."
"9576590","9579890"," I do want to say thanks for showing up with me every single day."
"9580190","9581210"," I appreciate the support. "
"9582110","9584090"," Appreciate you guys subscribing, following along."
"9585190","9587310"," We should have a great trade coming up here soon."
"9587590","9589090"," You guys know about put spreads, right?"
"9589350","9590170"," Don't come back to me. "
"9590250","9593270"," Don't be fucking yelling at me if you're not putting put spreads on."
"9593590","9594510"," They eventually print."
"9594810","9597450"," Most guys that follow these those put in call spreads. "
"9597450","9599170"," No, that eventually they print."
"9600490","9601630"," Thanks for showing up all you guys."
"9601770","9607910"," Thanks, Garrett, Andy, La Tuka, Chupacabra, Chupacabra, P.N. where it's from. "

"9628490","9630430"," L.R.M., Hot, Hot, Hot, good to see you. "
"9631410","9632570"," Who else in their Floyd's Garage?"
"9633050","9633530"," Who else is in here?"
"9633650","9634650"," It's a lot of talk clapping."
"9635270","9636410"," Just some guys, Steven."
"9637310","9640750"," Emerson, if you're out there listening along, Josh, brother, my brother, thanks for being here. "
"9641430","9642430"," Who else is sticking around?"
"9644310","9646790"," Michael, appreciate all you guys in here all day long."
"9647270","9647730"," Appreciate it. "
