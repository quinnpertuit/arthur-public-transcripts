"AsA-8UkSIq4","0","6680"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here with your Daily Brief."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","6680","13520"," I made a couple videos yesterday that I wanted to release, but I didn't like how they came"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","13520","14520"," out."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","14520","19920"," I need them to be more concise in my views on the market, so I hope to have something"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","19920","23560"," up for you today or tomorrow if I can get it together."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","23560","28640"," But I don't want to leave you hanging into this week as you all want to be able to trade"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","28640","32360"," this week and have a road map for what lies ahead."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","32360","37600"," Now the reason we're on this chart right here is that I use, it's a relic of my past."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","37600","44000"," I use weebel, I like the speed of their charts as a battle map for my day."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","44000","48280"," And so rather than using TradingView today, which is where I do most of my research, I'm"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","48280","52840"," going to share with you one of the charts that I use today trade."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","52840","58240"," Now this is messy at the moment and we're going to take it to a smaller scale, but what"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","58240","63520"," I want you to understand is that we broke through the 10-day moving average and the"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","63520","65520"," 21-day moving average."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","65520","69760"," And that puts us into a bearish context overall."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","69760","75160"," And that means that we have the next targets that we're looking for a reaction at the 50,"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","75160","77920"," the 150, and the 200."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","77920","83480"," This white line right here is the 200, and you'll see that it's coming into contact"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","83480","85600"," with a key level of support."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","85600","94720"," So also notice this 150 over here is coming into this next area of major support at $4.42.95."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","94720","99960"," And then you'll notice this green line right here is the 50-day, and that's starting to"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","99960","103880"," match up with this STX buy area down here."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","103880","109760"," Now bears were under the assumption over the weekend that they were just going to sell"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","109760","114680"," this market down to the 50, wake up Monday morning with their baskets full, but that"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","114680","120280"," was a tough thing to be doing because we were in a very low liquidity and low volume"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","120280","121920"," environments last week."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","121920","127840"," When we have sell-offs with low volume and low liquidity, we tend to snap back from them."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","127840","132920"," And that's exactly what took place in futures last night, and this morning grabbing a bunch"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","132920","134520"," of bears by their assets, okay?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","134520","138600"," Now, we're going to look at this chart, but I do want you to see that this is where you"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","138600","139800"," sell the rip to."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","139800","144760"," You are looking for us to sell this market to the 50 overall, to the 150, and to the"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","144760","147280"," 200, and you're looking for a reaction, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","147280","152160"," If you want to get long in this market, you're looking for us to get near or touch, let's"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","152160","156520"," say the 50, see a reaction, and then we bounce back, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","156520","157520"," You want to see that reaction."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","157520","161800"," If you don't see that reaction, then we're still going to be looking lower until we do"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","161800","162800"," find some support."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","162800","167240"," Now, I'm going to bring this chart a little bit closer where it's not as messy for you."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","167720","173000"," I want you to see what you're looking at for the next few days, okay?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","173000","176160"," Now, you can see that we bounced back overnight, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","176160","178240"," We're coming into this morning right here."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","178240","182280"," This is Monday, this is Tuesday, and this is Wednesday, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","182280","189120"," If you are bullish, let's say, then you're looking for us to trade up to this RTX sell"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","189120","191120"," or this yellow line right here."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","191120","195520"," This yellow line above, right, is where major resistance is at, okay?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","195520","200000"," So if you're a bull, you can trade this, you'd get out of your lungs near this RTX"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","200000","208200"," sell today, and then tomorrow, somewhere around this 4.6726, we're even possibly now at 4.6558"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","208200","213800"," or exit lungs on Wednesday at 4.6574."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","213800","217200"," So you can see that in these next three days, this is the sell area."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","217200","220080"," If you're a bear, the same thing holds true, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","220080","223800"," You're not going to take a short until we're somewhere up above here."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","223800","225720"," We had that same issue down here."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","225720","232600"," No bear should have been short into the close on Friday for Monday fucking morning, okay?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","232600","237080"," Bears should have waited until we broke through and then take it lower, and that goes for"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","237080","238080"," you as a bull."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","238080","241920"," If you're going to take this up, you're going to exit and wait until we jump above, and"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","241920","246840"," if we don't jump above, let's say we bounce off here, we know we can sell down to the"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","246840","250240"," next support levels down below."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","250240","253040"," Now, we are concerned about Wednesday, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","253040","256000"," The bears are going to want this month to end in the red."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","256000","261560"," So I expected this to be this sideways movement that we talk about from now until Wednesday."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","261560","265640"," You're going to look for this white line right here as miners support."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","265640","271560"," If we start to sell, if we can't hold this today or into Wednesday, you will see us sell"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","271560","277840"," down into this 4.52 area before the end of the week is out."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","277840","286080"," Now let's get in our closer scale here, and you should snap these on your own trading"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","286080","291000"," charts so you can see what we're looking at from now until Wednesday."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","291000","293520"," So let's say we open this morning, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","293520","298640"," We're going to look for a bounce to go long on R1, and if we don't get this bounce here,"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","298640","303880"," we will sell down and then take this up in a bullish move, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","303880","309800"," If you're a bear, and you want to see us break through R1 to take this short, and then"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","309800","315240"," you would exit your short down below somewhere in here in case we bounce, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","315240","319640"," And let's say you were like, well, no, I want to be a diamond-handed bear, well, you can"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","319640","324760"," be, but you're still waiting for a break below this level to take it even lower."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","324760","329680"," So this is the zone we're going to trade in here for the next three days."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","329680","334440"," This is your buy area if you're a bull, this is your sell area if you're a bear."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","334440","339160"," If you want to get bullish above, you have to wait for us to break through and hold"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","339160","340880"," some support."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","340880","345680"," If you want to get bearish below, you're going to wait until we break through, right?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","345680","348400"," Then take another short lower, okay?"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","348400","352880"," You don't want to get caught anywhere being a bear on this line, this yellow line right"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","352880","356320"," here, and you don't want to get caught above here as a bull."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","356320","360000"," Otherwise, this is exactly what happened on the Friday clothes."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","360000","364440"," So snap these lines on your own charts as we make our way forward through today."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","364440","369800"," I do expect us to trade sideways into Wednesday, and if you're a bull, you're going to be looking"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","369800","373360"," between now and Wednesday for us to break above and move higher."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","373360","377200"," If you're a bear, you're going to be looking for some failure somewhere up in here between"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","377200","379000"," now and Wednesday."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","379000","381040"," This is a crucial moment for the market."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","381040","386480"," I will get into my thesis at another time, but this should help you out today."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","386480","389800"," I hope it does, at least, and then it's actionable."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","389800","391200"," Have a great day trading."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","391200","396760"," If I see any flow that tells the story from the bear perspective or from the bull perspective,"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","396760","398360"," I'll post it today."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","398360","404400"," If I see any news or anything else that makes me have a conviction of when the long or short,"
"AsA-8UkSIq4","404400","405800"," I will let you know as well."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","405800","408240"," This should be a great trading plan for you, by the way."
"AsA-8UkSIq4","408240","408920"," Good luck today."
