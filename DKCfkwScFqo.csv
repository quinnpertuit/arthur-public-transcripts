"DKCfkwScFqo","10760","13840"," It feels pretty fucking rough, but..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","13840","17040"," Let's see if we can see it for a lot."
"DKCfkwScFqo","47040","69040"," Check one, two, like check."
"DKCfkwScFqo","69040","71040"," You're not going to like me this morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","71040","74040"," I'm pretty..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","74040","76040"," I'm going to try to hold it up this morning,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","76040","79040"," but uh..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","79040","80040"," I got a..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","80040","82040"," I'm pretty fucking sick here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","82040","88040"," We'll see how it goes though."
"DKCfkwScFqo","88040","93040"," I did take a shower, so..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","93040","96040"," I'm trying to look apart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","96040","101040"," Good morning, Jay Perry, how are you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","101040","102040"," Almost there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","102040","110040"," I'll get everybody in here really quick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","110040","112040"," No, I don't even know if the one anybody"
"DKCfkwScFqo","112040","115040"," who watches morning feel like shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","115040","116040"," And me, D.A."
"DKCfkwScFqo","116040","118040"," What was that one?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","118040","120040"," It is day one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","120040","124040"," I was wondered if there'd be a day where..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","124040","129040"," Uh..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","130040","134040"," I was wondered if there would be a day where..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","134040","139040"," Or a day would come where I would be sick during a..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","139040","141040"," Fed rate decision."
"DKCfkwScFqo","141040","144040"," Good morning, how are y'all doing out there this morning?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","144040","146040"," Dude, I feel like..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","146040","148040"," I feel like crappers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","148040","151040"," It's pretty bad."
"DKCfkwScFqo","151040","153040"," We have the flu here in my house."
"DKCfkwScFqo","153040","157040"," It started early last week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","157040","163040"," And I built to a crescendo, I think, on Sunday night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","163040","164040"," I did the bad thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","164040","166040"," Like, I did a really bad thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","166040","167040"," I went out to..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","167040","168040"," I felt like shit Sunday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","168040","170040"," And we went out to dinner."
"DKCfkwScFqo","170040","172040"," And I shouldn't have been going out to dinner."
"DKCfkwScFqo","172040","174040"," And at the time I didn't know."
"DKCfkwScFqo","174040","178040"," And by the time I got to dinner,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","178040","182040"," my youngest looked like death warmed over."
"DKCfkwScFqo","182040","185040"," My oldest looked really bad."
"DKCfkwScFqo","186040","189040"," And by the time I got to dinner, I felt like shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","189040","190040"," Like, it was like..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","190040","191040"," I don't know if it was..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","191040","193040"," I've been resting the whole weekend."
"DKCfkwScFqo","193040","197040"," And then I got into going out and doing something."
"DKCfkwScFqo","197040","200040"," But we ended up leaving."
"DKCfkwScFqo","200040","202040"," I'm not bouncing out of there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","202040","205040"," And I'm still really sick right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","205040","207040"," So I don't have COVID, which is good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","207040","208040"," It took a test."
"DKCfkwScFqo","208040","211040"," And then I took some other tests like RSV or some shit like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","211040","214040"," So it is flu that I have."
"DKCfkwScFqo","214040","215040"," Now I'm sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","215040","216040"," Really bad."
"DKCfkwScFqo","216040","217040"," I've got a temperature."
"DKCfkwScFqo","217040","219040"," And I've lost my voice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","219040","222040"," So at some point I could possibly lose my voice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","222040","223040"," I did load up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","223040","225040"," I've got some prescription stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","225040","227040"," And then I've got some..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","227040","228040"," I don't know."
"DKCfkwScFqo","228040","230040"," Fucking day, colon."
"DKCfkwScFqo","230040","231040"," Lossing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","231040","233040"," This isn't that sort of shit for the day."
"DKCfkwScFqo","233040","236040"," But I want to be able to be here for you this week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","236040","241040"," To make sure that you've got what you need to get through the week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","242040","244040"," Now last week on..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","244040","250040"," Last week I started discussing what to expect this week on Monday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","250040","255040"," So give a chance to go back and just read some of the lead up into this week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","255040","266040"," I did see some people discuss this upcoming week on Sunday where we started about a week ago prepping you for what to expect this week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","267040","271040"," And what it basically comes down to is that we haven't had a lot of news."
"DKCfkwScFqo","271040","279040"," We haven't had any volatility type news since the beginning of January."
"DKCfkwScFqo","279040","282040"," And this week we have it in spades."
"DKCfkwScFqo","282040","287040"," We've got aces, kings, queens, jacks, you name it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","287040","289040"," This whole entire week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","289040","295040"," And I tried to relate it to flying or being on a boat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","295040","300040"," Either flying in bad weather or being on a boat and bad weather where there'll be sudden drops."
"DKCfkwScFqo","300040","305040"," You're going to get this sideways and sudden drop type action."
"DKCfkwScFqo","305040","312040"," Basically every time you see us in a high you take out some 10 cent puts on spy expiring."
"DKCfkwScFqo","312040","316040"," Now at this point this upcoming Friday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","316040","322040"," And another way to train it was through calls on VIX right in volatility."
"DKCfkwScFqo","322040","328040"," We have it right when we also have the yen or the bank Japan decision last night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","328040","332040"," We'll get into some of that stuff this morning and how that impacts our markets."
"DKCfkwScFqo","332040","336040"," You know, on the on the surface you're going to hear a lot out there about it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","336040","338040"," And there are people that are better than me that know about this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","338040","342040"," The first person I would recommend for you to find is a Seder."
"DKCfkwScFqo","342040","344040"," If you don't know who he is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","344040","348040"," I've known him for a long long long long time way back."
"DKCfkwScFqo","348040","350040"," Long time Wall Street bet days."
"DKCfkwScFqo","350040","357040"," He's the guy that I probably trust the most for current yen US dollar stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","357040","359040"," Now he might block you or ban you too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","359040","361040"," He's a quant in real life."
"DKCfkwScFqo","361040","363040"," He's a very smart person."
"DKCfkwScFqo","363040","367040"," I wouldn't ask him any questions at all if you can find him out there on Twitter."
"DKCfkwScFqo","367040","369040"," I don't even know if he's still there or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","369040","373040"," He likes to ban people or black people but you can probably track him down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","374040","380040"," With a drop Twitter account or if he's blocked you already in real life."
"DKCfkwScFqo","380040","383040"," He gets pretty he gets he's very dismissive."
"DKCfkwScFqo","383040","386040"," So if he does block you find him."
"DKCfkwScFqo","386040","391040"," I don't know if it's with a drop Twitter account or incognito or something like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","391040","392040"," You probably find him."
"DKCfkwScFqo","392040","396040"," The other person that I would highly recommend is always Bob Kendall."
"DKCfkwScFqo","397040","401040"," Bob Kendall was an actual trader back in the."
"DKCfkwScFqo","401040","403040"," Princes of the end days."
"DKCfkwScFqo","403040","408040"," He was he was there when US funds would try to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","408040","411040"," A short pan and."
"DKCfkwScFqo","411040","419040"," You know that's it went on for years and years and years and years and years and that's one thing I would predicate."
"DKCfkwScFqo","419040","423040"," Some of the yen dollar stuff too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","424040","431040"," Would be you know the cocaine bag is still open in Japan whether you believe that or not and."
"DKCfkwScFqo","431040","434040"," Especially with the church department that kind of stuff like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","434040","440040"," They're still actively partying like it's a 1979 over there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","440040","442040"," And I would predicate that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","442040","447040"," That would you know we bring back to the right zero now not negative rates but zero but then the rest of their operations."
"DKCfkwScFqo","447040","449040"," We're all very loose."
"DKCfkwScFqo","449040","451040"," Right now in Japan."
"DKCfkwScFqo","451040","455040"," And I would seek those guys out those guys that can give you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","455040","460040"," From a cash market traders perspective."
"DKCfkwScFqo","460040","464040"," What you likely need to know about the dollar."
"DKCfkwScFqo","464040","470040"," I would not be relying upon been to it in general specially traders cash market people you want people that have."
"DKCfkwScFqo","470040","476040"," Have been through this with Japan for decades and decades and decades and have that experience."
"DKCfkwScFqo","476040","479040"," So I'll defer to those guys on that on that stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","480040","485040"," Yeah the sick like you know it for me it's."
"DKCfkwScFqo","485040","490040"," We put the masks on in the in the restaurant by the way and we bounced out of there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","490040","494040"," Like the problem for me is with maybe in sick is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","494040","497040"," So we we actually."
"DKCfkwScFqo","497040","500040"," We did the we followed what they told us to do."
"DKCfkwScFqo","500040","502040"," They're like you know wear a mask."
"DKCfkwScFqo","502040","504040"," Wash your hands."
"DKCfkwScFqo","504040","507040"," Stay at home. We did all that shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","507040","512040"," My wife was a my wife is like a doctor kind of a thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","512040","520040"," It's not that I train her and she's not the kind of like a two week fucking thing she's got an actual degree and all that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","520040","528040"," She played not played she she did play but she was an athletic trainer for professional sports for a period of time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","528040","531040"," And so we did that all that stuff right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","531040","533040"," And we didn't get that sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","533040","538040"," In fact I didn't get sick once my youngest got back to school."
"DKCfkwScFqo","538040","545040"," First time ever was this past fall and immediately we got sick like bam bam bam bam bam."
"DKCfkwScFqo","545040","552040"," Six six six that's how I got COVID first time I got COVID was from kids bringing home to school and."
"DKCfkwScFqo","552040","556040"," It's been hell since then because we weren't sick for so many years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","556040","561040"," You know like zero sick for like four fucking years or something like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","561040","568040"," And now it's like an incubator farm and we went to my I went to my youngest daughters."
"DKCfkwScFqo","568040","572040"," A luau dance a couple weekends ago we're dancing in like this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","572040","575040"," Dancing like the gym and all that stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","575040","579040"," And there are kids everywhere they're all disgusting these kids are raunchy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","579040","583040"," I'm watching them in the place and I'm like I'll be fine. I wasn't sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","583040","584040"," So now I'm pretty sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","584040","587040"," So bear with me today as we move forward."
"DKCfkwScFqo","587040","592040"," There may be times over the next course of the next two days where I just can't even speak to you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","592040","598040"," And that's just my voice and being sick so I apologize for that over the next couple days here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","598040","601040"," Let's get into the market brief really quick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","608040","612040"," Okay number one this morning I'm not going to play CNBC just yet."
"DKCfkwScFqo","613040","619040"," But we are going to look at the front page of CMV say this to see this morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","619040","621040"," We've got the usual analyst calls."
"DKCfkwScFqo","621040","626040"," Fund manager says this stock software is set to be serious player and AI gives 50% upside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","626040","629040"," Maybe we can take a look at that later if we get the time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","629040","634040"," The ones that I really want you to watch are the super micro computer one of the hottest A."
"DKCfkwScFqo","634040","637040"," I play as long side via tanks 10% on share offering."
"DKCfkwScFqo","637040","639040"," We discussed earlier in the week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","640040","647040"," That we could have some catalysts for SMC eyes just to sell off friend VDA to sell off."
"DKCfkwScFqo","647040","651040"," Not before but going into these events and we saw a little bit of that yesterday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","652040","658040"," Fed could cut rates fewer times than expected as economy keeps growing according to CNBC survey."
"DKCfkwScFqo","658040","660040"," We'll get into some of that today too with the Fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","660040","661040"," We're going to discuss."
"DKCfkwScFqo","661040","663040"," I guess we can discuss it right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","664040","666040"," Maybe I'll just maybe I'll open that one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","666040","668040"," We'll discuss it later."
"DKCfkwScFqo","669040","675040"," We're going to discuss big Japan ends world's only negative rates regime and historic move."
"DKCfkwScFqo","675040","678040"," Banan's yield curve control."
"DKCfkwScFqo","678040","682040"," And we're also going to get into SMC super micro computer."
"DKCfkwScFqo","682040","683040"," We're going to that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","683040","684040"," There's a super micro computer."
"DKCfkwScFqo","684040","685040"," We'll get into that one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","685040","686040"," We're going to the be a bank of Japan."
"DKCfkwScFqo","686040","697040"," We're going into the Fed rate cuts rate or Fed could cut rates fewer times than expected as economy keeps growing according to CMV survey."
"DKCfkwScFqo","697040","703040"," One thing I'll tell you is this is before we get into my lights are off this morning where my lights off this morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","703040","704040"," All right, whatever."
"DKCfkwScFqo","704040","710040"," So now the first thing we want to talk to you about the Fed is this fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","710040","712040"," I want you to realize something about the Fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","712040","720040"," There's not going to be fucking feds not going to come out to this rate decision and change course."
"DKCfkwScFqo","720040","724040"," It's historically is not it's not what Jerome does."
"DKCfkwScFqo","725040","727040"," He's not known for that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","727040","731040"," So let's let's look at this really quick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","734040","739040"," You know, forecasters in in Samucy Fed survey are increasing the cost of the U.S."
"DKCfkwScFqo","739040","741040"," economy will avoid a recession."
"DKCfkwScFqo","741040","744040"," Soccer and pull off a soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","744040","747040"," If you're a long time watch of the show."
"DKCfkwScFqo","747040","752040"," I've told you this how many fucking times soon to swear in this early morning,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","752040","758040"," but how many times have I told you that your your soft landing already started."
"DKCfkwScFqo","758040","763040"," And once that soft landing is done door two things."
"DKCfkwScFqo","763040","767040"," First one would be once that soft landing is done, they're going to tell you to stop using the word, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","767040","772040"," So you got all these voices out there telling you no soft landing, maybe soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","772040","778040"," Meanwhile, the markets fucking trading a soft landing and they're eventually going to tell you to stop using the word."
"DKCfkwScFqo","778040","781040"," You'll actually you probably see Jerome even mentioned that now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","782040","788040"," We'll try to get if I can get into today, I'm going to show you the window between a soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","788040","792040"," And what happens after every soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","792040","795040"," It's followed historically."
"DKCfkwScFqo","795040","798040"," Every time by a recession."
"DKCfkwScFqo","798040","802040"," And all these dates are agreed to prior."
"DKCfkwScFqo","802040","806040"," Now, if you look at every soft landing we've ever had, they have established dates."
"DKCfkwScFqo","807040","813040"," If you look at every hard landing that we've had or recession that we've had, those are, those are dated, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","813040","817040"," If set in stone, the soft landing was from this date to that date."
"DKCfkwScFqo","817040","820040"," The recession was from this date to that date."
"DKCfkwScFqo","820040","824040"," If you line all of those up, there's a window in between them."
"DKCfkwScFqo","824040","831040"," That does not have a name in that window is basically a window of manipulation from the fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","831040","835040"," And the Treasury Department, they decide how long it lasts."
"DKCfkwScFqo","836040","843040"," And we will take a look at that because I made a post on an outlook for this year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","843040","849040"," In December, and it was public for a little bit and some people have read it, but not too many."
"DKCfkwScFqo","849040","856040"," That post though went into that window between the soft landing and the next guaranteed recession."
"DKCfkwScFqo","856040","861040"," So we'll take a look at that as well if I can to get to it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","862040","864040"," Let's talk about the rest of this here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","864040","867040"," Increasing on the US economy will avoid a recession and pull off soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","867040","873040"," Unlike past surveys, don't even see growth slowing much below potential in the next couple of years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","873040","882040"," Potential downside of the better forecast less fed easing with possibility that officials at the meeting this week forecast fewer rate cuts in 2024 than they did in December."
"DKCfkwScFqo","882040","887040"," For now, the narrative that the US economy is so fragile that it cannot be survived without its full rates has been debunked."
"DKCfkwScFqo","887040","892040"," The US economy has been discarded in the rubbish bin of history, wrote John Donaldson, director of fixed income."
"DKCfkwScFqo","892040","897040"," Hey, for trust and response to the survey. And number one, the Fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","897040","904040"," Here, as long as the Fed is raising rates, right? Listen to me closely, raising rates."
"DKCfkwScFqo","904040","912040"," Even if they cut, if they raise again, as long as they're while they're in these operations, the market is actually quite safe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","912040","916040"," The market becomes less safe when we start cutting."
"DKCfkwScFqo","916040","922040"," I don't know if you know that or not, but there is risk to the stock market in particular."
"DKCfkwScFqo","922040","926040"," The moment that the Fed stops raising rates, not always."
"DKCfkwScFqo","926040","930040"," And most soft landings not we don't roll over."
"DKCfkwScFqo","930040","935040"," We might and sometimes we do roll over, but not like we could roll over."
"DKCfkwScFqo","935040","940040"," So right now the Fed is doing its job if you're if you're a stock market trader."
"DKCfkwScFqo","941040","946040"," And as long as the Fed has raised rates and is continuing what it's doing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","946040","950040"," You are usually historically safe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","950040","958040"," So even if tomorrow at two 30, you get no rates increase and you get no rates cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","958040","966040"," And even if the reaction is poor, right, we start to sell down and into tomorrow's rate decision."
"DKCfkwScFqo","966040","971040"," It's actually not bad overall for bulls in the market."
"DKCfkwScFqo","971040","977040"," My most fearful time is when they make their first rate cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","977040","982040"," So the most exposure that a market participant has."
"DKCfkwScFqo","982040","993040"," Historically, at least if there is exposure to like risk to a big downside move is going to be when they make their first cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","994040","1001040"," Now we will still need to be watching the velocity of unemployment jobs inflation at that time period."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1001040","1007040"," Are we spiking down and spiking up and do they continue to cut?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1007040","1015040"," Now they can cut raise whatever they need to do the more they go sideways with all of this data."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1015040","1018040"," The better off that they are point blank."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1018040","1024040"," That's the easiest way to describe it to you is that the longer that they keep jobs inflation and employment."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1024040","1026040"," It's kind of like bounce inside to side."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1026040","1031040"," A little bit like not quite no velocity in those numbers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1031040","1035040"," You don't want to see big giant whip downs, whip ups, any of that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1035040","1038040"," As long as you seem going side to side, you're all set for right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1038040","1042040"," And believe it or not, as long as you don't get a rate cut, there's no window of that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1042040","1044040"," Now you may be wondering to yourself, what does that mean?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1044040","1046040"," What does that mean, Cap?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1046040","1051040"," If we had a rate cut, I would expect a huge fucking green bar."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1051040","1058040"," Like if it was risk, if there was risk, I would expect a huge giant green bar, we go straight up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1058040","1066040"," Could be a day, could be a few days, most grab a liquidity and we start blasting straight down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1066040","1068040"," I mean, like down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1068040","1072040"," And that would be the riskiest moment in the market."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1073040","1077040"," I wouldn't want to be caught long there personally without any kind of protection."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1077040","1084040"," At that moment when that happens, there's a front running sometimes and we will blast down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1084040","1087040"," You guys over here will like 200 points in a couple of days."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1087040","1088040"," That shit will happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1088040","1091040"," Two, three, four, 500 points really fast."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1091040","1094040"," Or has happened in the past."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1094040","1097040"," So that's not an easy thing to trade, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1098040","1101040"," Because if they do a rate cut, you're going to get what?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1101040","1102040"," Exuberance."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1102040","1104040"," Whoo, everything is awesome."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1104040","1105040"," What is that guy talking about?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1105040","1107040"," He's out of his mind, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1107040","1111040"," And then you would come back like a day later and it's just everything's on fire, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1111040","1115040"," So you got to be really careful in those moments."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1115040","1118040"," Possibly best thing is to not even participate."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1118040","1123040"," Or if we get the big rip up, you've taken all your money out of the market at the top there and"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1124040","1128040"," I sit on your hands for a week or two longer just to see what's going on out there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1128040","1129040"," All right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1129040","1130040"," So, hold on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1130040","1131040"," We're getting up to an open rate."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1131040","1132040"," I've got two minutes left."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1132040","1133040"," Let me switch over briefly."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1133040","1135040"," We'll come back to this stuff here in just a minute."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1135040","1138040"," We'll get into the economic calendar and all that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1138040","1139040"," Oopsie."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1139040","1140040"," What did I do wrong here?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1140040","1141040"," I did something wrong."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1141040","1146040"," Let's go to the open count positioning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1146040","1151040"," I did something wrong here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1152040","1153040"," Okay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1153040","1160040"," So this is the chart from, I had someone ask a question over the weekend."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1160040","1161040"," There we go."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1161040","1164040"," I had someone ask me a question over the weekend, which I liked."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1164040","1167040"," And the guy was like, uh, and his Schrodinger was his name."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1167040","1170040"," And he was like, yeah, he's like, I don't, not on the show all the time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1170040","1171040"," I got to work."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1171040","1172040"," He's like, I'm in the discord."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1172040","1174040"," He's like, I don't get all these updates."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1174040","1178040"," He's like, I want to be able to discuss things in the discord or you're in the discord and"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1178040","1181040"," you're discussing the posts that you make, try to tie everything together, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1181040","1184040"," Like, um, tie it all together because it's hard."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1184040","1186040"," Like I'm on Twitter, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1186040","1188040"," On Twitter, we have some commentary on Twitter."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1188040","1190040"," Then I'm on a live stream all day long."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1190040","1192040"," We got the discord."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1192040","1193040"," We got the website."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1193040","1196040"," So almost like a 20 for our operation around here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1196040","1198040"," I think if I wasn't live streaming."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1198040","1206040"," If I just did like, um, uh, recorded videos every once in a while and mostly written posts"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1206040","1207040"," and stuff like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1207040","1211040"," I could update you throughout the day and be a little bit more vague, I guess."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1211040","1216040"," But where we're trading, like non stop 24 hours a day."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1216040","1218040"," Um, people get lost."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1218040","1220040"," That's a fact, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1220040","1221040"," People are going to get lost."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1221040","1223040"," People are going to be like, I saw you say this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1223040","1225040"," Now you're saying that, that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1225040","1227040"," Uh, and that's true, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1227040","1228040"," For some people, it's not true."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1228040","1229040"," Some people were like, I'm here every morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1229040","1231040"," Watch the show a little day long."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1231040","1232040"," We know exactly what's going on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1232040","1236040"," So what I thought about this morning was, uh, in for the future, especially this week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1236040","1240040"," Is, uh, to scale out a little bit, see where we are."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1240040","1242040"," And where are we right now, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1242040","1244040"," This was a, this was the post from last night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1244040","1247040"," Um, this is a one hour chart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1247040","1251040"," And this is the actual, I haven't changed in any way, shape or form."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1251040","1254040"," Uh, and this is what we had said was we're going to come down here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1254040","1256040"," And we're going to bounce."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1256040","1258040"," Right on right on cue, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1258040","1260040"," That's what we're doing right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1260040","1261040"," Uh, we're bouncing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1261040","1262040"," Uh, it says right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1262040","1263040"," Uh, it says right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1263040","1270040"," Bulls must hold 51085 or we roll targeting 50987 and likely the daily trigger, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1270040","1271040"," Somewhere down there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1271040","1275040"," We're going to end up, uh, testing that daily trigger personally."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1275040","1282040"," I would love to test that daily trigger and possibly break through it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1282040","1286040"," We'll take a look at that if it's a possibility of breaking through."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1286040","1290040"," And what kind of damage we could get."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1291040","1293040"," You can see off the opening bell, the buyers did step in."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1293040","1296040"," And we're now testing the daily trigger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1296040","1298040"," And this is going to be a big thing here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1298040","1302040"," Uh, when I drew this last night, the one thing I didn't consider would be."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1302040","1306040"," Some kind of a pinning action coming into the marketplace."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1306040","1308040"," Right in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1308040","1313040"," And pinning you into the rate decision tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1313040","1316040"," Uh, where they try to hold it, hold you in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1316040","1321040"," Last you down possibly for the, for the doom and gloom around like two in the afternoon,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1321040","1322040"," two 30 in the afternoon."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1322040","1325040"," And then you, how there's your dip by to go higher."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1325040","1331040"," So if you are looking for a reason for the market to go down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1331040","1335040"," This morning, if you're looking for that reason for the market to go down, where could it be going?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1335040","1339040"," And if we're not going to squeeze up and above the daily trigger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1339040","1343040"," If that does not happen, uh, where do we roll to?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1343040","1345040"," Like, what are the actual targets to the downside?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1345040","1348040"," So let's look at that this morning, uh, for positioning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1348040","1350040"," So we're going to get rid of this here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1350040","1351040"," Right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1351040","1353040"," I'm going to get rid of this here so you can see it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1353040","1355040"," Let's just take a look at it right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1355040","1358040"," So here's where the buyers stepped in on the hourly candle."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1358040","1360040"," Uh, they stepped in right down here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1360040","1362040"," This is where they are."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1362040","1366040"," They're right down here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1367040","1372040"," Let's see if we go this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1372040","1378040"," And we know that the little, little sellers are right up in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1378040","1380040"," Right there, right there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1380040","1385040"," And get all that in yellow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1385040","1388040"," And all that in yellow too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1388040","1390040"," So right in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1390040","1393040"," So you can see the buyers stepping in."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1393040","1396040"," You can see the seller stepping in right here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1396040","1398040"," Trying to figure out what the day is going to be."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1398040","1402040"," If I had to guess, even with this arrow going up,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1402040","1407040"," that this does not resolve until tomorrow at 2.30."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1407040","1408040"," Uh, three o'clock."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1408040","1411040"," My guess here is that we're going to be pinned in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1411040","1414040"," You're going to see some kind of action like this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1414040","1418040"," Uh, and you're going to say like, they're going to say on CNBC, like."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1418040","1421040"," Investors wait for Fed decision."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1421040","1424040"," Investors wait for Jerome Powell."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1424040","1427040"," I don't see Jerome doing anything different."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1427040","1430040"," He is said he's not adversarial."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1430040","1432040"," A million times, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1432040","1435040"," He has said he'll telegraph to you what to expect."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1435040","1441040"," I did see the Washington Post has been going bananas with, um,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1441040","1446040"," with, uh, some contradictory fed speak to be expected."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1447040","1449040"," No, but let's just put that right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1449040","1450040"," There's an hourly chart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1452040","1455040"," And where could we go tomorrow?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1456040","1460040"," If you wind up getting stuck in here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1460040","1464040"," You end up getting this ping pong action and you have that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1464040","1466040"," Just a little bit of blood down here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1466040","1471040"," If you're looking to participate, uh, in this next quarter."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1471040","1475040"," Uh, even if you get this bounce down here, even if we go up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1475040","1481040"," Uh, the options market will likely still sell, uh, the market."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1481040","1484040"," Uh, the options market will typically sell even good news."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1484040","1485040"," So let's say you get."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1487040","1489040"," So you get something like this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1490040","1492040"," You get pinned in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1492040","1494040"," Even if you get pinned in here, doesn't matter."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1494040","1500040"," You get some key pointers that if you get that fed doom, um,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1500040","1502040"," you get the hedge in the market, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1502040","1505040"," The fed doom regardless, even if we were to squeeze higher."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1506040","1507040"," Here or even here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1508040","1511040"," By the time we come into the beginning of the month,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1511040","1513040"," this is like April 1st."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1514040","1516040"," To the 14th, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1516040","1520040"," You'll end up getting, uh, another place to buy the dip."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1521040","1523040"," You know, digest the news, all that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1524040","1530040"," And then your new quarterly flows coming in on, um, you know, uh, April 1st,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1530040","1532040"," April 15th, something like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1532040","1538040"," And you should be able to get, catch them kind of a, uh, dip by for the quarter is my point."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1538040","1542040"," Um, now we could turn around here next this week and you're going to see like,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1542040","1546040"," the yen is dooming the U S, you know, U S currency is now strong and."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1546040","1550040"," Uh, blood baths around for everybody and all that talk."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1550040","1554040"," When you see all that talk this week, uh, you're going to see all that talk today."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1554040","1555040"," You're going to see it tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1555040","1557040"," Um, you're likely going to see it into the end of the month."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1557040","1558040"," All that kind of shit, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1558040","1562040"," You have expiration coming up to some really fun stuff usually happens with that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1562040","1564040"," We'll take a look at that too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1564040","1569040"," At some point, uh, the day before of expiration can get kind of fun, but, uh,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1569040","1574040"," uh, key points here would be if you are a swing trader, if you are, uh,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1574040","1576040"," wanting to participate."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1577040","1581040"," Uh, in Q two, like, hey, I missed everything cap."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1581040","1583040"," Uh, where is the dip by?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1583040","1584040"," Where's the season?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1584040","1586040"," The season of low hasn't happened."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1586040","1587040"," All that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1587040","1590040"," Uh, we got to call places to look, don't we?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1590040","1592040"," We got two places to look here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1593040","1595040"," We've got currently 505."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1596040","1600040"," And the next spot down here for 72."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1601040","1602040"," Whoa."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1602040","1603040"," For 72."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1603040","1606040"," This would be about four 70."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1606040","1608040"," Figure three weeks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1608040","1612040"," Be roughly about, uh, 485 ish."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1612040","1614040"," 480, 485 ish."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1614040","1616040"," That would be like this big doom thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1616040","1618040"," We get some, you know, fed doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1618040","1620040"," I don't know if we're going to get this, but I wish we would."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1621040","1623040"," Like some fed doom, some yen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1623040","1624040"," Doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1624040","1625040"," And it's like, whoop, just for a second."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1626040","1627040"," And boom, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1627040","1629040"," You're in like, you're in like Q two."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1629040","1630040"," You get some doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1630040","1632040"," And there was a dip by down there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1632040","1636040"," There's that 45, that 490, everything is supposed to be gnarly."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1637040","1644040"," Um, you're going to hear all these people tell you that it's fucking horrible and like, you're not getting that you're going to get this down here and you're going to be horrible."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1644040","1647040"," And the truth is they just want to fucking sweet ass price."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1647040","1650040"," To get in there and get up there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1650040","1651040"," So we'll pay attention."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1651040","1656040"," So we'll get into a, we'll get into that posture."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1656040","1658040"," There's no point here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1658040","1661040"," We're going to get into the posture of bring on the doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1661040","1664040"," Uh, get me a fucking low, please."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1665040","1667040"," Uh, and if we don't, what happens?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1667040","1670040"," So let's just say we don't go down there, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1670040","1672040"," We already know what to look for."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1672040","1676040"," We already know when the doom is gone."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1676040","1679040"," Let me go, let's get all this like movement here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1679040","1681040"," And let's say we get none of that doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1681040","1683040"," Let's say we don't get any of this down move down here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1683040","1684040"," We just start boom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1684040","1685040"," We're above here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1686040","1688040"," And the hourly trader comes up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1688040","1693040"," We know what to do, don't we start taking that shit long and we're off and running again."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1693040","1695040"," So I don't care personally."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1695040","1696040"," I'll be honest with you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1696040","1698040"," I don't give a fuck."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1698040","1701040"," If we roll down for a correction and I don't give a fuck."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1701040","1705040"," If we roll up and start trading five 50 or five 60."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1705040","1710040"," Either way, we can take it and we know what to look for in either scenario."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1710040","1715040"," Uh, if we begin to roll down or if we're going to trade higher and move forward with none of that doom and gloom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1715040","1716040"," Mark just blows it all off."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1716040","1717040"," It's like F fuck off."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1717040","1719040"," We're running from here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1720040","1721040"," Let's get back down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1721040","1724040"," Let's go down to a smaller time frame now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1724040","1727040"," Okay, so we're sitting on this time frame right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1727040","1732040"," When we look, we're stuck between 512 31 and 510 21."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1732040","1734040"," So let's go down to a 30 minute basis here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1734040","1736040"," See what this looks like."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1736040","1739040"," I love by the way."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1739040","1744040"," Uh, I love by the way, not trading one minute trigger with you guys this week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1744040","1752040"," I'm like, Oh, good morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1752040","1754040"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1754040","1755040"," My feeling better."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1755040","1757040"," No, I'm sick as a dog."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1757040","1758040"," I am super sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1758040","1760040"," I have a temperature right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1760040","1763040"," Um, I'm going to lose my voice at some point."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1763040","1765040"," I'm pretty fucking sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1765040","1769040"," Uh, I'm pretty sick, but I want to be like, I want to be here with you guys."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1769040","1772040"," So I'll be here as much as I possibly can."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1772040","1776040"," Uh, if there's a lull, uh, if I get through everything we need to get through,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1776040","1781040"," I will be taking breaks so that I can be here in force when the old man is speaking tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1781040","1783040"," Uh, thanks for asking."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1783040","1784040"," I appreciate it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1784040","1785040"," I'm extremely sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1785040","1789040"," I'm like, I'm dying over here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1789040","1793040"," You like this, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1793040","1796040"," I think we're going to switch to some of this too in general."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1796040","1800040"," Um, or, well, I think this, I think on Sundays,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1800040","1803040"," I'm going to do more for the supporters."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1803040","1806040"," And I'm going to give you different time frames."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1806040","1810040"," Uh, so you have, I want to show you this to this upcoming Sunday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1810040","1813040"," I want to, uh, pro traders already have this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1813040","1815040"," I give it to them every day."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1815040","1818040"," They get like an outlook that's like, hey, this is what it is for a year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1818040","1820040"," As of right now, this is what it is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1820040","1823040"," And like a four hour basis, a one hour basis."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1823040","1825040"," And then of course you get the show, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1825040","1829040"," Uh, but our supporter level is sometimes kind of like, yeah, what's, what is he telling me?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1829040","1832040"," Like, I don't want to trade for the next two days or three days."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1832040","1837040"," I want an outlook as to where the projections are, where we going down the road."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1837040","1847040"," Uh, so at least once a week, I'm going to try to drill down for, uh, our swing traders that are only supportive level so they can get a view, a better viewpoint as to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1847040","1852040"," Hey, on this, um, timeframe, I'm bearish or bullish on this timeframe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1852040","1854040"," I bearish or bullish on this timeframe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1854040","1856040"," I'm bearish or bullish."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1856040","1863040"," Uh, cause you know, a lot of times, a lot of times, well, my fact on Friday, I was talking to Scott of always."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1863040","1866040"," And he was like, where did you make your money in this week?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1866040","1870040"," And so we started going through like, I made money here and I lost money there and made money here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1870040","1873040"," But when we were scaling in and out of those trades."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1873040","1880040"," Who were like scaling in and out from like a one minute timeframe to like an hour timeframe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1880040","1884040"," And it's like, it was like these little spots like this big."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1884040","1897040"," And, uh, on a one minute timeframe, then you zoom out and you're like, you know, if you were looking at an hourly basis, you know, you couldn't really, or it's all completely different thought process, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1897040","1904040"," Then it is on a one minute basis and the same goes for a, for a daily chart, weekly chart, all that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1904040","1907040"," So we'll take a look."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1907040","1910040"," We're going to take a look at some stuff this morning for you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1910040","1916040"," And I'm going to post some, I'm going to show you guys something right now that I found interesting."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1916040","1922040"," And, uh, let me see if I can bring this up here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1922040","1927040"," Let's flip over to, um, can I do this here?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1927040","1930040"," Cycles. There we go."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1930040","1933040"," We're going to bring up cycles."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1933040","1937040"," And we're, we got something to look at here that we need to look at."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1937040","1941040"," These are PPO, uh, PMO indicators."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1941040","1947040"," Right here is a little bit of a roll coming on on PMOs, right, a little bit of drop here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1947040","1950040"," PPOs are rolling down as well."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1950040","1953040"," So you can go over to a."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1953040","1958040"," Think over this. Okay, this might be better."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1959040","1964040"," This is, um, PPOs, PMOs and market breadth."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1964040","1967040"," For the S&P 500."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1967040","1973040"," And there are some key points to this to be paying attention to and watching."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1973040","1978040"," And I want to first draw your attention to this roll down right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1978040","1982040"," You see that roll down and you get this roll down right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1982040","1985040"," Further roll down over here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1986040","1989040"," And you can see that kind of translates to some pullbacks, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","1989040","1993040"," And a gradual correction that takes place in the market."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1993040","1995040"," Fairly easy to see."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1995040","1999040"," Sometimes we get, uh, sometimes we end up getting."
"DKCfkwScFqo","1999040","2004040"," Now, what, what happens is that what's most important about this one right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2004040","2009040"," Is that's what you sometimes what you get is a rotation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2009040","2013040"," Of money. So I have money, right? I got 10 bucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2013040","2021040"," And I rotate into, uh, risk, risk on stocks and VDA, spec growth, you name it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2021040","2027040"," Once I make my money, I rotate into other sectors, especially sectors that haven't come up yet."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2027040","2030040"," Like risk on stock, uh, stocks, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2030040","2036040"," Or ETFs like XLK, XLC, all these big tech, uh, indexes, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2036040","2038040"," Or sectors."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2038040","2040040"," And you'll see it down here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2040040","2043040"," You can actually see down here when they rotate in and out of."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2043040","2045040"," I'm just going to scale that up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2045040","2049040"," You can see how they rotate in and out of each sector as time progresses."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2049040","2056040"," Now, when they do this rotation, the key point for you to understand is that, uh, when they do these rotations in and out."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2056040","2060040"," It doesn't always correspond to price going down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2060040","2064040"," You can actually see a successful rotation right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2064040","2069040"," And it did not correspond to price velocity to the downside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2069040","2077040"," My point being is that sometimes you get velocity and price heading down along with, um, the rotation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2077040","2081040"," And sometimes you do not see a place here we didn't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2081040","2086040"," It didn't follow with this market breath to the downside. And why is that?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2086040","2095040"," Uh, it's because we don't get below 20% in these, in these sectors, which will trigger a liquidation event."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2095040","2099040"," When you get that liquidation event, price and spoons blast down to the downside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2099040","2105040"," You get that V shaped recovery and usually, let me preface this. Okay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2105040","2114040"," Usually you will see that price velocity to the downside begin way up here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2114040","2122040"," You actually see a big downside move, uh, pull back up and then more downside move than a pull back up and more downside move, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2122040","2132040"," Uh, if you do not see that, like, so no velocity of price to the downside, you see it hold no price velocity to the downside holds."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2132040","2138040"," Uh, they make a successful rotation and we're often running back to the upside again."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2138040","2143040"," So right now we have that happening, right? You can see we have the sector rotation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2143040","2151040"," You can also see that we do not have the corresponding price velocity to the downside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2151040","2156040"," We're going to see that right now. We do not have that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2156040","2158040"," You see that?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2158040","2164040"," So like some prior events, we should already be like down here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2164040","2171040"," If you wanted to get, uh, you know, that squeeze up and then the big move down, the big squeeze up, the big move down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2171040","2172040"," We haven't seen that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2172040","2177040"," We've been seeing just this zone right here, right? Just zoned training."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2178040","2184040"," Uh, so we will pay attention. We'll stay watching more closely the market breadth."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2184040","2196040"," Uh, even so my, my, the positive here is even though you see PMOs and PPOs rolling over, even though you see market breath rolling over as of right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2196040","2204040"," Um, we're not seeing, uh, price velocity to the downside matching that rotation as of yet."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2204040","2206040"," We have not seen that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2206040","2213040"," Uh, so to that point, unless that is lost and that is down here at 505, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2213040","2219040"," Which we just discussed a few moments ago, didn't we? We discussed where the daily trigger was."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2219040","2221040"," Daily trigger is right down here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2221040","2222040"," Okay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2222040","2225040"," And this, so this is your DT right here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2225040","2231040"," Now, whatever doom and gloom we have coming into these events, if you see this kind of an action,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2231040","2236040"," and we have already, uh, blasted down on PMOs and PPOs."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2236040","2247040"," If you've seen the full rotation take place, uh, and we like go down on market breath, then we start increasing on market breath again, especially into risk on stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2247040","2254040"," Uh, you are going to see more action like this or a consolidated move to the upside, not the downside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2254040","2256040"," Does that make sense?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2256040","2264040"," So if you're a bear, you would have at this point have wanted to have seen more downside price action."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2264040","2271040"," We don't have that as of yet. This looks more currently."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2271040","2277040"," This currently muck looks more like this action here, doesn't it?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2277040","2282040"," Looks more like this than it does like this, right? No violent move down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2282040","2286040"," And what does this look like? Looks like this right there. See it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2286040","2292040"," Up, down, up, down, up, down, and then boom to the upside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2292040","2297040"," And this sure then shit right now at least looks like up down, doesn't it?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2297040","2305040"," Does not look like womb straight down blast down boom blast down over there. We're not seeing that at the moment."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2306040","2310040"," And that says this doesn't come from like the Fed going, yeah, everything's awesome."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2310040","2317040"," Then we roll down as well. So we still have some risk also associated with Jerome Powell."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2317040","2322040"," So let's say we get Jerome Powell, right? Bloodbath and Jerome Powell, we squeeze up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2322040","2330040"," All the ball comes off the market, but then we get an actual roll down in the future into the first week of or second week of April."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2330040","2334040"," So we have a few things we have to watch over."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2334040","2337040"," See if I can go back to this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2337040","2343040"," I hope that didn't help this doesn't delete the chart from last night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2343040","2347040"," Sweet still there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2347040","2350040"," So."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2350040","2353040"," Let's bring that up right there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2353040","2356040"," Come on now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2356040","2363040"," Hold on a second here. It's not going to want to do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2363040","2368040"," I'm going to have to jumpstart this thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2368040","2372040"," There we go."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2372040","2376040"," Come on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2376040","2380040"," It's supposedly it's calculated. It says it's calculated right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2380040","2384040"," So."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2384040","2391040"," One quick second here for this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2391040","2399040"," So there's some stuff to look at here, right? So the things I want you to understand here would be this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2399040","2402040"," The things that I want you to be clear on here is this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2402040","2407040"," We have the markets right now. We can see Claire is day."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2407040","2412040"," That the market is rotating right now. Claire is fucking day."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2412040","2417040"," We can also see that we have not that's up. That's not even a fact."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2417040","2419040"," We know for fact."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2419040","2423040"," Number one, the market is rotating out of risk."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2423040","2427040"," We know for a fact coming into the end of the quarter."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2427040","2434040"," We know for a fact that for Q two that they were going to be looking for money flows into the market at a good price."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2434040","2438040"," For Q two the summer run, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2438040","2447040"," We also know for a fact that or historically that the summer months are going to become slower."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2447040","2452040"," I don't know if you guys know a lot about summer trading. Some of you guys are new traders."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2452040","2458040"," Summertime gets really slow. It's like a grind. We grind up. We grind down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2459040","2464040"," Most of the heavy action trading is done by the time we get to summer."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2464040","2471040"," Another fact that we know is that price has not corresponded to this rotation, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2471040","2475040"," I just showed it to you a few moments ago."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2475040","2484040"," And we can see two prior examples, one where we rolled down in one where we just traded sideways and made our move higher."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2484040","2489040"," So you as a trader, I want you to be paying attention to that five oh five area."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2489040","2495040"," I want you to pay attention to are we just doing a sideways consolidation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2495040","2498040"," Bring this over here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2502040","2507040"," Are we doing just a sideways consolidation for Q two rip."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2507040","2511040"," Right? Here's your five oh five down here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2511040","2520040"," And we just talked about five oh five earlier."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2520040","2526040"," Is this going to be the same that we did before where we do this bullshit down here, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2526040","2530040"," Coming to Q two and we're off and running, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2530040","2534040"," Leave all that stuff behind and we're out of here for summer months."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2534040","2545040"," Or does it become more like that correction that we had where we actually begin to break below."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2545040","2549040"," Right? Get underneath that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2549040","2553040"," Get underneath that daily trigger, right? I guess it'd be higher."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2553040","2557040"," I guess I could hold on a second here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2557040","2566040"," Get a little bit sloppy here, right? Because we got this stuff happens by the day."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2566040","2571040"," We're able to get underneath this here and start to have a correction on our hands."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2571040","2575040"," Right, where you get past this low here, you get underneath the daily trigger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2575040","2579040"," You get the hourly trigger underneath the daily trigger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2579040","2583040"," And we get some velocity to the downside price."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2583040","2602040"," We haven't seen the yet, but we are going to be looking for that into this next week into end of quarter and the first two weeks, believe it or not, they get some time like sellers have some time between now and probably April 14 to make this happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2602040","2607040"," But I'll tell you what, do the sellers have that right now?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2607040","2616040"," The answer is no, they don't. I just showed it to you. Just showed you that they don't have. I would have expected at this point."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2616040","2620040"," At this point, I would have expected price to be right about here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2620040","2622040"," Like right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2622040","2626040"," I would be expecting this action us to be right about here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2626040","2632040"," For us to be getting those, you know, that weekly trigger that monthly trigger and that kind of stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2632040","2634040"," But we don't have that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2634040","2639040"," That's my point. There's none of that at this moment."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2639040","2647040"," In the market, we're not seeing any of that price action in the market right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2647040","2652040"," And yeah, so synchronic city said this just now summer sucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2652040","2654040"," Summer blows."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2654040","2659040"," Summer is like what? Jump on a trade. Don't touch it. Don't look at it for two weeks, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2659040","2662040"," Take a nap."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2663040","2666040"," Good morning, John Haggerty. How are you, brother?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2666040","2669040"," Good morning. And here's another thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2669040","2672040"," Here's one of the things I want to discuss right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2672040","2675040"," Something that bothered me deeply."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2675040","2678040"," Last night I was on last night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2678040","2682040"," I don't know. Matthew was last night. There was a major article about Jerome Powell."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2682040","2684040"," And inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2684040","2687040"," Like the first hundred fucking comments."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2688040","2692040"," I was shocked. Top hundred comments. I'm ready."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2692040","2694040"," I was shocked."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2694040","2698040"," How much people don't understand basic economics."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2698040","2701040"," I was flabbergasted."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2701040","2705040"," So I'm going to discuss this with you guys this morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2707040","2711040"," I'm going to discuss this with you guys this morning. This is an important thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2711040","2713040"," How are you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2714040","2718040"," I'm going to discuss this with you this morning. Some basic economics."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2718040","2729040"," Okay. Now, I am of the belief that the fed with the fed and the treasury operations happen to coincide with business cycles."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2729040","2733040"," So can I say that what they do really matters? No."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2733040","2739040"," I can't. And a lot of ex fed presidents are on record and books that they write."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2739040","2743040"," I've been written about them and interviewed for biographies and autobiographies."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2743040","2747040"," Long after they are fed chairs or little presidents or whatever."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2747040","2750040"," And they even say admit to the same stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2750040","2757040"," But they don't know if it really makes a difference. Could just be the economic cycle in there, maybe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2757040","2763040"," There may be enhancing or having an impact on what's already happening naturally."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2763040","2768040"," But I got to say this because on Reddit last night, I think it was last night or the day before."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2768040","2772040"," I wanted to like, I wanted to hit myself and head with a hammer."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2772040","2775040"," Because I was like, why, why do these people don't understand this?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2775040","2778040"," I'm going to make this really simple for you. Okay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2778040","2781040"," Super simple for you. Try to make this super simple."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2783040","2785040"," Okay. We're going to move this over here for a minute."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2786040","2789040"," I don't know how people can't grasp this, but I guess they can't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2789040","2792040"," You haven't the rate of inflation right here. Okay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2793040","2795040"," And that rate of inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2796040","2798040"," Is a steady."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2798040","2803040"," Or the fed in the treasury departments or the president, whoever."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2804040","2807040"," I want you to know that inflation doesn't stop going up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2807040","2809040"," In our country."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2809040","2810040"," Inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2810040","2814040"," The fed wants 2% inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2815040","2819040"," That 2% inflation never stops going up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2820040","2827040"," Do you understand that like every year 2% 2% or fighting for that 2% right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2827040","2829040"," So prices do not come down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2830040","2832040"," Do you understand me? Like."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2834040","2835040"," Just keeps going up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2837040","2839040"," You have to understand that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2839040","2840040"," Now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2842040","2843040"," COVID happens."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2843040","2846040"," We get a spike in inflation that is abnormal, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2847040","2849040"," Year over year inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2849040","2853040"," Now they're fighting with rate increases to bring that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2854040","2856040"," Rate of inflation back down to 2%."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2857040","2858040"," You understand that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2860040","2863040"," This rate of inflation ready."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2864040","2867040"," Does not impact the price of goods and services."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2868040","2869040"," In a."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2869040","2870040"," Come down moment."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2871040","2876040"," Your eggs do not go up from $2 or a dollar to $4 or $6."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2877040","2880040"," And then magically come back down to $2."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2880040","2883040"," Even though the rate of inflation comes down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2884040","2885040"," That makes sense."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2886040","2888040"," I don't think it does for a lot of people out there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2889040","2894040"," The rate of inflation coming back to 2% does not drop the price of eggs."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2895040","2899040"," It's just the rate at which inflation impacts the price of goods."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2901040","2904040"," Does that make sense? So I don't know if that makes any sense."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2907040","2911040"," It just slows any new increases in price."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2912040","2916040"," For you to actually get the price of eggs to come down permanently."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2917040","2921040"," You would need the rate of inflation to go negative."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2923040","2925040"," Does that make sense like negative."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2926040","2932040"," Below 2% below 0% start going like negative 4 negative 5 negative 7."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2933040","2938040"," So if you're going to get that if you wanted that shocked that people don't know this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2939040","2940040"," So."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2942040","2943040"," That's right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2943040","2946040"," Jay Shady just said you would need deflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2947040","2949040"," Now if you did get that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2950040","2952040"," Now these are the people on Reddit right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2952040","2954040"," I'm like if this is what you want."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2955040","2962040"," You want deflation and you want to go back to the prices of the prices of goods and services."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2964040","2966040"," That pre COVID."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2967040","2968040"," Do you understand?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","2969040","2973040"," Do you understand the impact that would have on the economy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2974040","2978040"," And on our society and you probably don't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2979040","2982040"," If you're a working person with a job."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2983040","2987040"," And you're making let's say 50 grand a year 70 grand a year 90 grand a year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2988040","2992040"," You are likely going to be hurt the most in that process."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2994040","2996040"," Now I'm not saying that I don't want to see that happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","2997040","2999040"," My main street hat or I can get through that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3000040","3002040"," But I want you to know out there that if that were to happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3003040","3007040"," Who likely gets hurt the most is you particularly to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3009040","3015040"," People fantasize about people fantasize about things like Civil War."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3016040","3019040"," They fantasize about things like."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3020040","3024040"," You know get rid of the fraud from the fed get rid of the fraud from this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3025040","3026040"," The fraud from that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3027040","3029040"," I'm not necessarily anti that at all."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3030040","3033040"," But be aware that when you're asking for those things."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3034040","3038040"," The reality of those things are far different than what you think they will be."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3039040","3042040"," Not you personally, but a lot of people who think that would be a great thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3043040","3044040"," That would be a great thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3045040","3046040"," Yeah, can't wait till it happens."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3047040","3048040"," Whenever those things do happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3049040","3051040"," We saw it in 0708 right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3052040","3056040"," You saw the president of the United States standing on this on the."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3057040","3059040"," Capital steps with senators."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3060040","3062040"," And they were literally whispering in his ear."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3063040","3064040"," They were on their on this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3065040","3067040"," The state Capitol steps whispering his air saying."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3068040","3070040"," If you don't get this done by the weekend."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3071040","3073040"," People aren't getting paid at Walmart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3074040","3075040"," They're not getting paid at McDonald's."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3076040","3077040"," They're not getting a check."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3077040","3079040"," Like they're going to get literally going to check sent out to them."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3080040","3082040"," The workers of America going to get sent out a check."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3083040","3084040"," Right. They're Friday check."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3085040","3086040"," And these are people that live week to week."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3087040","3089040"," Right. Sometimes robbing Peter to pay Paul."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3090040","3092040"," And they're their check is going to bounce."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3093040","3097040"," I don't know if you know what that means or what will happen if that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3098040","3099040"," What will happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3099040","3102040"," If most of America's check but clip bounces."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3103040","3104040"," On a Friday afternoon."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3105040","3106040"," It will be."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3107040","3108040"," Fucking doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3109040","3111040"," It's it's very similar to what happened in COVID right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3112040","3113040"," You all have to stay home and none of you can work."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3114040","3115040"," What did they do."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3116040","3117040"," You tell me what they did."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3118040","3119040"," They fucking gave you checks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3120040","3121040"," They literally gave you money."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3122040","3123040"," And said here's free money for you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3124040","3126040"," And they did that in 0708 as well."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3127040","3128040"," Invert. It's the same situation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3130040","3131040"," Why did they do that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3132040","3134040"," So you don't fucking riot and burn down the United States of America."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3136040","3137040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3137040","3138040"," So whether it's right or wrong."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3139040","3140040"," Whether you agree with it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3140040","3141040"," Whether you like it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3142040","3143040"," The Fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3144040","3145040"," The Treasury Department."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3146040","3147040"," The government."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3148040","3149040"," The sovereignty of the United States of America."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3150040","3151040"," Is going to step in."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3153040","3154040"," And stop that from happening."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3155040","3156040"," Does that make sense to any of you out there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3157040","3158040"," Whether you like it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3159040","3160040"," And these people on Reddit aren't getting it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3161040","3162040"," They're not understanding that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3164040","3165040"," And what that means is the fraud."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3165040","3166040"," Goes on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3166040","3167040"," Until it really truly breaks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3168040","3170040"," You are not going to get a Fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3171040","3172040"," A Treasury Department."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3173040","3174040"," A presidency."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3175040","3176040"," A Senate."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3176040","3177040"," And no one else out there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3178040","3179040"," That gives a fine fuck about what you want."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3180040","3181040"," No."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3182040","3183040"," They didn't do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3183040","3184040"," No 708."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3184040","3185040"," They didn't do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3185040","3186040"," COVID."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3186040","3187040"," And they're fucking not going to do it this week for you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3188040","3189040"," Do you understand that?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3189040","3190040"," Whether you like it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3190040","3192040"," If it ever does happen where they can't be fixed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3193040","3194040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3194040","3195040"," They will still."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3196040","3197040"," Fight it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3197040","3199040"," Like it's like tooth and nail with the with the drug."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3200040","3201040"," It's tooth and nail with the."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3202040","3203040"," With that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3203040","3204040"," With just the operations from our government."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3206040","3207040"," And they will do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3208040","3209040"," They'll party."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3209040","3210040"," They'll destroy it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3210040","3211040"," They'll do the cocaine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3211040","3212040"," They'll do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3212040","3213040"," They'll do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3213040","3214040"," They'll do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3214040","3215040"," They'll do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3215040","3216040"," And they will do it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3216040","3217040"," They'll party."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3217040","3218040"," They'll destroy it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3218040","3219040"," They'll do the cocaine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3219040","3220040"," They'll do all the partying."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3221040","3222040"," And what does that mean to a young Redditor."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3224040","3225040"," It means that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3226040","3228040"," You can sit there all day long and bitch and wine about it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3230040","3233040"," But the only way for you to combat where you're at right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3235040","3238040"," With where we are with the rate of inflation and where we're headed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3239040","3241040"," Is that you're going to fucking pay more for eggs."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3242040","3243040"," Fuck you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3243040","3248040"," And you are going to pay for the bullshit and scams or whatever money flow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3248040","3250040"," There was in COVID."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3250040","3254040"," You're going to you're going to assume that and the rest of your adult life."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3254040","3256040"," Whether you like it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3256040","3258040"," And the moment that you accept that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3259040","3260040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3260040","3261040"," The moment you can get on with living."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3262040","3265040"," The moment that you can get on looking for a job that pays better."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3266040","3270040"," And you can try to try to like chase that inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3271040","3274040"," It's horrible to say, but it is what it is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3275040","3281040"," That's the reality of life that a lot of people don't have for them or a lot of old people don't tell young people."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3282040","3284040"," Is that you are going to absorb that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3284040","3286040"," You are going to live with higher inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3287040","3290040"," You are you can sit here and bitch for the next 20 years, right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3292040","3294040"," And suffer or chase."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3295040","3298040"," You have two choices and that's really the choice that you have."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3298040","3299040"," That's it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3299040","3300040"," You can go on Reddit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3300040","3308040"," You can wine all fucking day long and 20 years from now, you'll be the asshole left behind whining about that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3308040","3310040"," Instead of saying, I need a better fucking job then."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3311040","3312040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3312040","3313040"," This sucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3313040","3315040"," And I don't want to deal with it as being a young person."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3315040","3321040"," I don't want to shoulder this and it's going to fucking blow and I hate my fucking politicians and I hate this and I hate that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3321040","3322040"," That's fine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3322040","3325040"," But you have to chase it because you will be left behind."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3326040","3330040"," You will be left behind as other people go out there and get higher paying jobs demand more money."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3330040","3333040"," They negotiate contracts at FedEx, whatever that is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3334040","3337040"," You have to find a way to chase that inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3337040","3340040"," That shit's been going on since day fucking one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3341040","3343040"," And it sucks to say it, but it's true."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3344040","3347040"," And if that happens, where's the stock market going."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3348040","3349040"," Brings up that last question, right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3349040","3351040"," Everything I just said is true."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3352040","3354040"," It means that the stock market is undervalued."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3356040","3364040"," Due to the devaluation of our currency, due to the devaluation of just inflation going up 2% every year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3364040","3365040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3365040","3369040"," And minimum, it goes up means that our stock market is under fucking value."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3376040","3377040"," That's right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3377040","3378040"," It does."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3378040","3379040"," That's right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3379040","3380040"," He got it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3380040","3383040"," Now, personally, taking off my my trader hat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3384040","3387040"," Yeah, do I have like the do I have those fantasies?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3387040","3388040"," I do."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3389040","3390040"," I'm going to say that I don't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3390040","3392040"," I'm not going to tell you that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3392040","3394040"," Do I want to see deflation?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3394040","3395040"," Of course I do."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3395040","3397040"," Will we have a deflationary period ahead of us?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3397040","3398040"," We will."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3398040","3400040"," Even when we get a soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3401040","3402040"," We have a window ready."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3402040","3403040"," We got soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3404040","3405040"," We get a window."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3406040","3409040"," That window is predicated upon the fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3410040","3412040"," That peak fraud."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3412040","3413040"," Like peak."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3413040","3414040"," That window."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3414040","3417040"," I can't put a time on because when I looked at it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3417040","3419040"," It could be anywhere from a year and a half."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3420040","3422040"," After the soft landing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3422040","3424040"," To a fucking decade."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3425040","3430040"," It is so vast that window between the defined dates of a soft landing and a recessionary period."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3430040","3432040"," That you can't say what they're going to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3432040","3434040"," What's going to happen or what they're going to do."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3435040","3437040"," Now when I can't predict."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3437040","3439040"," At least from looking at macro stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3439040","3441040"," I can't see the answer to it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3443040","3444040"," Anyways."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3446040","3448040"," I was shocked that nobody understood that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3448040","3449040"," Top 100 comments."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3449040","3453040"," If you were like, I'm like this people don't even fucking understand that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3453040","3455040"," Unless they get deflationary, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3455040","3458040"," Unless we go negative fucking inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3460040","3462040"," We're never going back to those prices."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3463040","3465040"," You can bitch all day long."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3465040","3466040"," You can whine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3466040","3468040"," You can bitch about cost of hamburgers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3468040","3471040"," Fucking cost of hamburgers are only going to go up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3472040","3473040"," Only going to go up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3475040","3476040"," That's it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3476040","3478040"," What's even more fascinating about this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3479040","3481040"," If you are an older person."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3481040","3486040"," If you are older, if you're like, I don't know, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3486040","3487040"," Older than that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3487040","3488040"," You watch this show."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3488040","3489040"," I already know."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3490040","3492040"," That you yourself."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3492040","3494040"," Have seen this cycle."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3495040","3499040"," Repeat itself over and over and over again."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3500040","3503040"," And there should be a sweet spot for that worker."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3504040","3507040"," There should be a sweet spot for that worker that doesn't make a jump."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3508040","3509040"," In pay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3509040","3512040"," That can't get ahead of this inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3513040","3517040"," You will see a moment in probably 10 or 15 years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3517040","3522040"," Where you will finally feel like, Hey, I'm getting ahead of the curve here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3522040","3524040"," And there will be another event."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3525040","3528040"," That is going to make the price of eggs jump up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3529040","3531040"," And you're going to be like, Oh, fuck."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3531040","3532040"," That was short lived."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3532040","3534040"," And now at the start of a new cycle."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3535040","3537040"," Does that make sense to you out there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3537040","3539040"," So, yeah, you're going to you're going to suffer."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3539040","3544040"," And for the next 15 years, if you don't get a neck norm or not normal,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3544040","3546040"," let a jump in your pay early."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3546040","3548040"," And you are going to feel it for 10 or 15 years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3548040","3552040"," Most of your adult life, if you're young, if you're like watching the show right now"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3552040","3553040"," and you're 20."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3553040","3556040"," Yeah, you're going to fucking feel it for the next fucking 20 years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3556040","3559040"," And you're going to probably be about 40 years old."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3559040","3562040"," And you're going to say, Oh, I'm finally getting ahead of the curve right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3562040","3563040"," It feels great."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3563040","3565040"," And there'll be another event that's going to fuck you over."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3565040","3566040"," And you're going to be like, Oh, fuck."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3566040","3567040"," What am I going to do now?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3570040","3572040"," I'm telling you guys, if you're young, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3572040","3576040"," I'm telling you the truth and you will come."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3576040","3580040"," You'll remember this conversation when you are old."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3580040","3582040"," You'll say, I remember this fucking guy told me this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3582040","3584040"," I didn't fucking believe him."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3584040","3586040"," And here I am an old man now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3586040","3588040"," And I've been through this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3590040","3591040"," What if I'm investing?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3591040","3593040"," That's a good question."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3593040","3594040"," What if you're investing?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3596040","3598040"," I have those same questions for myself."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3599040","3602040"," We just saw a big, big rush."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3602040","3607040"," In 2022 of people trying to shift money around, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3608040","3610040"," To chase inflation, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3610040","3611040"," Protect their wealth."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3612040","3614040"," During that transitionary period, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3614040","3616040"," We had a huge spike in inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3617040","3619040"," The only thing I would say to you would be to follow the money."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3620040","3622040"," Always follow the herd money."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3623040","3624040"," They come out."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3624040","3626040"," You can see it sometimes and sometimes you can't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3626040","3628040"," But you can see the herd."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3628040","3630040"," Matter of fact, I was just yesterday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3630040","3635040"," I was just looking at high yield savings accounts and high yield checking accounts."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3635040","3638040"," And I'm like, they pay less than Robinhood."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3638040","3640040"," And I think we will right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3641040","3643040"," I was like, this is fucked up, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3644040","3647040"," They pay less than I was looking at some bonds and stuff like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3648040","3651040"," And I'm like, there's no, there's no safety there right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3651040","3653040"," Male rep 5%, which is pretty good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3654040","3655040"," It's beating inflation."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3655040","3656040"," So right now you're kind of safe."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3658040","3660040"," You're kind of safe right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3660040","3666040"," You should be doing well with just those instruments on their own."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3669040","3670040"," It's really true."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3670040","3671040"," It's hard to say that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3671040","3676040"," I don't want to tell people this because it sounds a lot like."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3677040","3681040"," It sounds a lot like the old people telling young people."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3682040","3686040"," Keep eating your avocado toast and keep going to Starbucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3687040","3689040"," But that's really, really not the truth."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3689040","3691040"," And I would say one last thing to you out there if you're young."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3693040","3694040"," When I was young."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3696040","3697040"," My dad."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3698040","3703040"," Moved to Boston, Jamaica Plain, Boston, Massachusetts."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3704040","3706040"," And Boston was a shithole."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3707040","3709040"," Boston had the combat zone had."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3709040","3711040"," Pussycat theaters in the north end."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3713040","3716040"," Most of Boston proper was a shithole."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3717040","3721040"," If you went to New York in that time period, New York City was a shithole."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3722040","3723040"," It was a dump."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3723040","3724040"," You wouldn't want to live there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3724040","3725040"," It was very dangerous."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3725040","3726040"," You go to Penn Station."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3726040","3728040"," They were shooting up heroin in Penn Station."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3728040","3730040"," Matter of fact, we have more problems today in Penn Station, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3730040","3732040"," But at that time, it was a real shithole."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3732040","3736040"," You think San Fran is a shithole now or New York's a shithole now?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3736040","3738040"," You have no idea how bad it was back then."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3739040","3740040"," Santa Monica, California."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3741040","3743040"," There was a time when you wouldn't want to live there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3743040","3744040"," It was a dangerous little town."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3744040","3747040"," Sleepy little town with gangbangers and poor people."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3748040","3749040"," That's what Santa Monica was at one time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3750040","3754040"," All these old fucks that are old now, they were all moving into those places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3754040","3759040"," And buying shitholes and working on those communities."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3759040","3760040"," So where they are today."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3760040","3764040"," So if you're 20 years old today and you're like, well, I just want to live in wage."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3764040","3766040"," And I do say to you, where are you living?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","3766040","3771040"," And they say, well, I live in this built up town with my parents or the same town as my parents."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3771040","3773040"," And I want to have what they have."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3773040","3775040"," That is not how life works."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3775040","3779040"," It's not how capitalism in the US works in any way, shape, or form."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3779040","3780040"," No."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3780040","3784040"," You are not going to be able to move into the most desirable neighborhoods."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3784040","3788040"," Most desirable towns and get paid working at fucking Starbucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3788040","3792040"," The same rate as someone living there that's already wealthy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3792040","3796040"," You should do what they did, which they don't tell you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3796040","3799040"," These old people don't like to tell you this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3799040","3803040"," But they didn't live somewhere with all of those services."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3803040","3805040"," They moved to a shithole."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3806040","3808040"," And they built it up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3808040","3809040"," They did."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3809040","3811040"," That's what they did."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3811040","3815040"," No matter what they tell you, they're going to tell you they did this and that and all this other shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3815040","3816040"," They were smart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3816040","3817040"," They weren't fucking smart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3817040","3819040"," They fucking moved to a place that was depressed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3819040","3821040"," And they created a community there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3821040","3829040"," So today, if you're young, you should be finding a place that's a little bit more affordable."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3829040","3832040"," In near where you can get good jobs."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3832040","3833040"," And that's the truth."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3833040","3835040"," I have no other way to say it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3835040","3837040"," And I'm not trying to pump the trade either."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3837040","3838040"," There are other places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3838040","3840040"," There are places in California."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3840040","3842040"," There are places in Utah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3842040","3844040"," I look at them all the time, like Utah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3844040","3846040"," Minneapolis has these places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3846040","3848040"," Pittsburgh has these places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3848040","3849040"," You can go to Wisconsin."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3849040","3850040"," You can go to Pennsylvania."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3850040","3851040"," You can go to Ohio."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3851040","3853040"," You can go to even California."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3853040","3855040"," There are places literally in California."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3855040","3860040"," New York has places up by Buffalo, I believe, has some places as well."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3860040","3862040"," Now it's not Santa Monica."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3862040","3863040"," It's not Beverly Hills."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3863040","3865040"," It's not fucking New York City."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3865040","3866040"," But I will tell you this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3866040","3871040"," Historically, if you can find one of those places that have been beaten down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3871040","3873040"," I have a little more reasonable cost of living."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3873040","3876040"," I have a little more reasonable entry into buying a house."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3876040","3879040"," You can usually still find something today."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3879040","3880040"," That's affordable to you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3880040","3888040"," And probably a job nearby and you're going to be pissy about it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3888040","3890040"," You're not going to have everything that you want."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3890040","3892040"," You're going to have all of it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3892040","3895040"," But I assure you that you can, you know, get off Reddit and bitch."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3895040","3898040"," Stop bitching and find a place to live."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3898040","3899040"," Find a job."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3899040","3902040"," Create whatever it is you want in life, whether it's a family, whether it's."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3902040","3905040"," I don't know party in, whether it's doing drugs."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3905040","3906040"," I don't care."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3906040","3907040"," Whatever it is you want to do."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3907040","3922040"," Whatever it is you want to do, you'll likely be able to find one of those places that are depressed and in 20 years, you'll look back and say, I didn't think that place would be wanted now or the next hot spot, whatever it is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3922040","3934040"," You know Portland at one time was a fucking, Portland was kind of a dump still today but Portland at one time was really a dump right was a dump. Seattle wasn't the place always."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3934040","3944040"," All these places that are now the place, there will be new places in the future."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3944040","3950040"," We're kind of want to move South Dakota working remote yeah sure this place is there too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3950040","3955040"," I'm sure there is so just be my point here would be."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3955040","3964040"," I realized that right now you're like I don't want to move there. I don't want to move here. I don't want to move there. You'd be shocked how the stuff happens sickly."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3964040","3969040"," And you see like the rise and fall of a great place. You don't want to be in the tail end of that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3969040","3974040"," And how there's a rise in the place that you would never expected. Anyways."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3974040","3982040"," Looks like we're box boxed in right now on S&P 500 looking at break above buyers stepping in down below at that five 10 19."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3982040","3986040"," The buyers still trying to break above there are lots of buyers here right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3986040","3991040"," You can see that they're pushing pushing right here pushing right here and pushing right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3991040","3996040"," If you'd like to be a buyer you'd like to be a bull today you want to be above."
"DKCfkwScFqo","3997040","4002040"," The hourly trigger let's take a look at where that is. It's a 512."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4002040","4005040"," 512 31 right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4005040","4010040"," Where bulls take over move that over so you can see it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4010040","4016040"," You want to get all bold up if we're going to go higher you want to be above again the hourly trigger currently we're below the hourly trigger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4016040","4024040"," This is a place for sellers to ready get set up for the rate decision tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4024040","4028040"," Sellers trying to set themselves up with a hedge."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4028040","4034040"," Heading into tomorrow and you can see they've already done that once twice and they're trying to do it again."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4034040","4042040"," So if you are not hedged for tomorrow this is the place to do it on that hourly trigger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4042040","4044040"," Let me go through."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4044040","4048040"," As a matter of fact if you live somewhere out there in this country."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4048040","4050040"," Let me ask you a question."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4050040","4058040"," If you live out there in this country and you think that you know of a place that's reasonably priced."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4058040","4061040"," Let's say that housing is roughly."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4061040","4065040"," I'll go with anything under three hundred thousand dollars."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4065040","4074040"," So like an average starter home is like one fifty and a really nice starter home runs up to about three hundred thousand."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4074040","4075040"," I'm in the chat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4075040","4085040"," Tell me some of the places where you can get a starter home for about a hundred grand and you can get a really nice starter home for up to like two fifty three hundred."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4085040","4088040"," Oklahoma City is one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4088040","4091040"," You think that's hard to find? I don't think it's hard to find."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4091040","4093040"," I'm in the I'm in the flipper community."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4093040","4095040"," I know that these places exist."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4095040","4100040"," I look at them all the time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4101040","4103040"," Let me know."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4103040","4104040"," Oh yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4104040","4105040"," No, I agree with you on that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4105040","4107040"," I agree with you on where I live."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4107040","4108040"," I agree with you on that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4108040","4111040"," I agree with their places where it's ridiculous."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4111040","4112040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4112040","4113040"," The cost of housing is ridiculous."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4113040","4114040"," I'm going to agree with you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4114040","4115040"," A hundred percent."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4115040","4118040"," My fear here is that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4118040","4124040"," I guess my personal fear here is that as a young person."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4125040","4128040"," It's easy to fall into the trap of."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4128040","4132040"," Well, I'm just going to suffer and I'm going to bitch and moan on Reddit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4132040","4138040"," Or wherever it's YouTube, Twitter, fucking TikTok."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4138040","4141040"," And then what happens is you get left behind."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4141040","4143040"," That's my biggest fear."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4143040","4145040"," You get left behind."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4145040","4148040"," In this day and age, it doesn't have to happen like that anymore."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4148040","4151040"," The age of communication and the Internet."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4152040","4156040"," You can be well versed in whether you're going to get left behind or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4156040","4161040"," A really nice place to keep you left behind is Reddit, my view."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4161040","4164040"," Where you're just being told you're fucked, bro."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4164040","4166040"," Just accepted, man."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4166040","4167040"," Go to work."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4167040","4168040"," Fuck them."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4168040","4170040"," What do they call it?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4170040","4173040"," It's not slow quitting, but it's like I'm not going to do anything."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4173040","4177040"," I'm just going to take my 20-hour job and fuck you and I'm going to bitch on Reddit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4177040","4180040"," You end up getting left behind 20 years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4181040","4182040"," You go fuck."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4182040","4187040"," I could have done this and I could have done that and I could have done this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4187040","4195040"," Yeah, quiet quitting or something like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4195040","4197040"," You end up losing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4197040","4199040"," You're like the..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4199040","4201040"," In the long run, you lose."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4201040","4204040"," And you'll see your friends from when you were 20 years old."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4204040","4205040"," They were like, oh, fuck this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4205040","4208040"," I'm moving to this place where I can actually afford a house."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4209040","4211040"," They got a tech job that I want, but it's not the best."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4211040","4216040"," But I got this decent job making 90 grand a year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4216040","4217040"," I notice it right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4217040","4223040"," You can actually see during COVID, during COVID, a lot of..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4223040","4226040"," During COVID, a lot of..."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4226040","4229040"," During COVID, a lot of restaurant workers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4229040","4234040"," I'm going to take this opportunity to better myself and get the fuck out of working restaurants."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4234040","4237040"," Just an article about it in the New York Times recently."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4237040","4240040"," Our people are just like, I'm going to get out of the job."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4240040","4241040"," I'm tired of this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4241040","4244040"," Everyone gets stuck in this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4244040","4247040"," So there are people that recognize that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4247040","4256040"," They're trying to better themselves, trying to get a leg up on this next inflationary period."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4256040","4257040"," Thoughts on copper?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4257040","4261040"," We're going to look at it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4261040","4263040"," PICB."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4263040","4265040"," Oh, RGF."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4265040","4271040"," RGF announced changes to their leadership, which is nice to see."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4271040","4275040"," And one of their guys comes from a food company."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4275040","4280040"," I sure got the name of the food company is, but now there's whispers of a takeover."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4280040","4285040"," So that was good to see."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4285040","4289040"," During COVID, people were moving in here like mad because of prices."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4289040","4292040"," Yeah, I believe that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4292040","4296040"," The remote workers have a lot of power, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4296040","4299040"," They have a lot of disposable income."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4299040","4301040"," Their money is even magnified, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4301040","4306040"," So if you make like 50,000 as a remote worker, you're probably making what 70?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4306040","4309040"," Maybe like 20% more."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4309040","4312040"," Even more, 30% more."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4312040","4316040"," If you're making 100k, remote workers, you got way more money, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4316040","4317040"," Like 140,000."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4317040","4319040"," My wife's a remote worker."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4319040","4321040"," She doesn't pay for shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4321040","4323040"," She doesn't have to, she doesn't have to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4323040","4326040"," She used to have to like drive everywhere, eat everywhere."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4326040","4330040"," She used to have to buy expensive clothes."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4330040","4334040"," It was lots of travel, lots of cost of being a worker."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4334040","4340040"," She doesn't pay any of that stuff anymore."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4340040","4342040"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4343040","4346040"," And that's more than likely the future too, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4346040","4348040"," Whether we like it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4348040","4350040"," More remote work."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4350040","4358040"," Likely more of that in the future."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4358040","4361040"," In Minneapolis, a starter home is $300,000."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4361040","4364040"," That's kind of reasonable today, isn't it?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4364040","4365040"," Is it on the high end or the low end?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4365040","4367040"," I thought there were communities in that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4367040","4368040"," Let's look."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4368040","4370040"," Should we look up housing in Minneapolis?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4370040","4375040"," We can."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4375040","4377040"," I'd say about average, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4377040","4383040"," I'm talking about the suburbs or the surrounding communities of Minneapolis or some of the"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4383040","4385040"," poorer neighborhoods in Minneapolis."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4385040","4387040"," I've seen housing for like 100k."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4387040","4389040"," I've looked in Minneapolis."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4389040","4391040"," I've looked in Wisconsin."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4391040","4393040"," Jamie in the city."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4393040","4394040"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4394040","4399040"," That's the other thing that I noticed is I was looking in Seattle yesterday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4399040","4407040"," And they tear down these one, these single family homes and now they're building townhouses and condos."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4407040","4411040"," Like apartments, roach motels."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4411040","4416040"," And now they want you to pay a million dollars for like triple quadruple living."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4416040","4419040"," Have you noticed that too?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4419040","4424040"," He moved out of the Minneapolis suburbs."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4424040","4429040"," Are they doing that in your city too?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4429040","4435040"," Let me know here if you're going to put a hedge on for tomorrow in the chat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4435040","4444040"," Are you hedging this event tomorrow right here on this hourly trigger for the roll down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4444040","4448040"," For the rate decision doom."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4448040","4452040"," Keep that up right there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4452040","4457040"," Have you ever thought about buying houses in other countries? Yes, I have."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4457040","4464040"," You're hedged right now. Good job."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4464040","4469040"," You're a little short semis for the rotation. Good job. Absolutely. Good job. We're rotating right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4469040","4474040"," They just showed it to you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4474040","4479040"," Western South Dakota. You're thinking about moving to right on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4480040","4484040"," So me personally, have I ever thought about buying house overseas? Yes."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4484040","4487040"," I have looked in places. I've looked in Mexico."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4487040","4489040"," Have not looked in Asia."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4489040","4495040"," My next thought was I was talking to my wife a few pre-COVID."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4495040","4500040"," We wanted to pre-COVID. I wanted to buy a boat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4500040","4505040"," I wanted to sail around the world and I didn't know where I'd wind up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4505040","4510040"," For a home base. I didn't know if it would be in the US or if it would be in another country."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4510040","4518040"," If I would get sick or something down in Panama, if I would get sick in Southeast Asia and decide to live there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4518040","4521040"," Those plans are all gone at this point."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4521040","4527040"," It fucked up my whole like COVID fucked up my whole life. My kids are now too old to do that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4527040","4533040"," Now I'm kind of in this like waiting, holding pattern for my kids to go to college."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4533040","4538040"," So I've got eight years ish."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4538040","4541040"," Seven years tacked on eight years tacked on now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4541040","4543040"," Now where I can't leave and do that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4543040","4548040"," So I'm kind of stuck here with you guys in the States for at least that long."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4548040","4551040"," A Vix hedge. Congrats on that's a good one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4554040","4556040"," I like South Dakota."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4556040","4562040"," I like that. Half my family is from Montana, so the Southeastern corner."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4563040","4566040"," I like South Eastern corner of Montana."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4571040","4576040"," Good question. Cap if rates stay the same as it bullish, if they raise them, is it bullish."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4576040","4580040"," If they lower them, which do you, which do I don't don't think will happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4580040","4582040"," We going down."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4582040","4589040"," There's a mechanic to this trade. There's a mechanic in my view going on right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4590040","4594040"," If we get a rate cut. Good question. If we get a rate cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4594040","4597040"," The initial reaction should be an upside move."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4599040","4602040"," I don't do think though that that could possibly."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4602040","4604040"," If they were to cut right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4605040","4610040"," That would possibly be a really bad signal to the market."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4611040","4614040"," I know this is going to be contrary to a lot of what you're told out there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4615040","4616040"," Let's go through right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4617040","4619040"," So the Fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4621040","4623040"," Is feeling good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4625040","4626040"," About their."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4629040","4631040"," Their progress they've made."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4632040","4634040"," So you you want to see the fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4635040","4637040"," You want to see the fed like chill."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4637040","4640040"," You want them to be like, Hey, we're coming into this right decision."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4641040","4642040"," And you don't get a rate cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4642040","4645040"," And we don't need to make a rate cut right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4645040","4647040"," Right. So you get no rate cuts."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4648040","4649040"," That's a confident fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4651040","4653040"," Now the initial reaction might be a bloodbath."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4654040","4655040"," Like down below."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4656040","4657040"," No rate cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4658040","4659040"," Right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4659040","4660040"," But it would be supportive."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4661040","4663040"," There should be supportive. The market should still be supportive."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4664040","4665040"," Because the fed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4666040","4668040"," Is fine. They haven't broken anything."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4669040","4673040"," They've told you in advance told you in advance and told you in advance."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4674040","4676040"," You can expect two to three rate cuts this year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4677040","4679040"," And they've told you not to expect them back to back."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4680040","4685040"," As long as they have that room in their schedule for the rest of 2024."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4686040","4688040"," Then we're going, we're doing fine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4689040","4690040"," Does that make sense?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4692040","4693040"," Okay."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4693040","4697040"," Now, if you were to get a rate cuts at this meeting."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4698040","4700040"," That would signal."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4701040","4705040"," And that the initial response should be a huge upside move."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4706040","4709040"," Market blasts. And I mean fucking blasts."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4710040","4715040"," But it would probably be a blast for liquidity."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4716040","4718040"," Why? Because in the background."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4719040","4722040"," The fetch. If the fed is cutting rates at this meeting."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4723040","4724040"," In particular."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4725040","4729040"," Maybe they've broken stuff that we haven't seen in their panic."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4730040","4734040"," They're back pedaling on their damage that they think that they've done."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4734040","4736040"," And I think that they have done that damage by the way."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4737040","4738040"," I think they already have."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4739040","4743040"," When I was I was reading an article this week about five guys burgers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4744040","4745040"," And."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4746040","4749040"," How a burger costs what 20 bucks for a burger right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4750040","4751040"," And I noticed it everywhere."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4752040","4755040"," I notice when I go to fine dining."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4755040","4757040"," And I mean real fine dining like James Baird."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4758040","4763040"," When I go to our beard, or people that say their beard quality, I should say."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4765040","4766040"," Or better."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4767040","4769040"," I noticed the cracks there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4771040","4773040"," I noticed that a burger at one of those places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4774040","4775040"," Is not that good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4776040","4777040"," Service. Not that good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4778040","4779040"," Knowledge. Not that good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4780040","4781040"," I also notice it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4782040","4784040"," On like the McDonald's level."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4785040","4787040"," Brian, I noticed it on the five guys level."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4789040","4791040"," What they're having to charge for you getting."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4791040","4792040"," It's not that good."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4792040","4793040"," I go to my local."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4793040","4794040"," I have a local bar here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4795040","4798040"," And they still in a Monday, you can get a burger, a bear and fries from 10 bucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4799040","4800040"," And it's a handmade patty."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4801040","4802040"," It's sexy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4802040","4803040"," It's a great burger."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4803040","4808040"," But you can see the damage being done to businesses."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4809040","4811040"," So me, do I think they've already done the damage?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4812040","4813040"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4813040","4814040"," Do I think that we've seen that damage yet?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4815040","4818040"," No, and we will see the damage being done out there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4818040","4820040"," These companies are not going to survive that shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4820040","4821040"," I assure you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4822040","4826040"," People aren't buying in and out or not enough, but I'm five guys burgers anymore."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4826040","4831040"," And then have the disposal income to buy before and you see them raising their prices again and again and again."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4831040","4833040"," I wouldn't be shocked to see this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4833040","4835040"," Some of these companies say I declare bankruptcy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4835040","4838040"," I wouldn't be shocked to see a McDonald's declare bankruptcy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4839040","4840040"," I'll be honest with you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4840040","4842040"," I got McDonald's someone big."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4842040","4845040"," Some of these big, big corporations that serve food."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4846040","4848040"," You can see the pain already there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4848040","4851040"," You can see they keep raising their prices, but they have to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4851040","4853040"," They don't have a choice but to raise prices."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4855040","4857040"," So yeah, for tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4858040","4863040"," If there is no rate cut, it's everything is proceeding as normal."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4864040","4869040"," If there is a rate cut tomorrow, everything is not proceeding as normal."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4869040","4872040"," If they raise rates tomorrow, that's another rarity."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4873040","4875040"," I don't see that happening at all."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4876040","4878040"," Personally, now if they did."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4879040","4884040"," The initial reaction on that one would be a huge down move, but still supportive."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4884040","4887040"," If the Fed thinks they can raise rates again."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4888040","4890040"," Now, can they raise rates in the future?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4890040","4891040"," Yes."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4891040","4893040"," Can they cut and raise?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4893040","4894040"," Yes."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4894040","4896040"," I wouldn't be shocked to see a cut and then a raise."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4896040","4898040"," That's probably the most likely path."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4899040","4900040"," You see a rate cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4900040","4903040"," You see a pause and possibly a rate increase."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4904040","4906040"," Or they do, they do like a cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4906040","4907040"," A cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4907040","4908040"," A cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4908040","4909040"," A cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4909040","4910040"," A cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4910040","4911040"," Nothing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4911040","4912040"," A cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4912040","4913040"," Nothing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4913040","4917040"," That would be the ENTER between these based on the next 30 days."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4917040","4920380"," Same be like five decisions down the road or six decisions down the road,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4920380","4922040"," could they raise again?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4922040","4923040"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4923040","4930040"," And that would be a part of that window between soft landing and the next hard landing"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4931040","4937040"," where you would get them and more manipulation from the fed on raising and cutting rates historically when that happens,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4937040","4939040"," they can extend that window a decade or so."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4939040","4941040"," The markets still goes up to the right in those scenarios."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4941040","4942680"," Right now what you don't, if you're a bull,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4942680","4944600"," what you don't want to see is a ray cut tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4944600","4948240"," I know that sounds crazy to you, but it's real."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4948240","4949720"," You don't want to see a ray cut tomorrow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4949720","4953400"," You want to see it, and this is the second part of that trade."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4954680","4958680"," So, if you're not getting a ray cut tomorrow, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4958680","4960680"," And you see some weakness in the market."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4960680","4964000"," The next question that arises is,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4964000","4968840"," when do we price in the inevitable ray cut?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4968840","4971760"," And if that comes, you're going to see a front running"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4971760","4973240"," of small caps."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4973240","4975880"," You see the rotation going on right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4975880","4979240"," I would have all eyes right now on small caps."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4979240","4980960"," That's like the one."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4980960","4983640"," In a small caps blast down tomorrow or anything like that,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4983640","4987400"," just remember in your mind that if we don't get a ray cut"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4987400","4992400"," tomorrow, they don't have much time left to have one, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4993600","4996360"," They're going to price that shit in before we ever get there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","4996360","4998400"," If we ever get to that ray cut,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","4998400","5000400"," if there are going to be traders out there"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5000400","5003280"," that are going to be looking for the pricing in"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5003280","5004880"," of that eventual ray cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5004880","5007360"," He's getting into a corner now over it, isn't he?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5007360","5009160"," Like, if he doesn't cut rates tomorrow,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5009160","5012400"," how many fucking rate decisions does he have this year?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5012400","5015280"," Now, all the talk that you see out there right now,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5015280","5016320"," watch my hand down there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5016320","5018560"," You see all that talk out there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5018560","5020640"," Just CNBC this morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5020640","5023600"," They're like, well, maybe we aren't getting"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5023600","5024800"," three ray cuts this year."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5024800","5027080"," Maybe it's only two, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5027080","5027960"," That's all bullshit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5027960","5031720"," That's just fucking traders trying to max out"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5031720","5033240"," doom and gloom trade, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5033240","5034720"," And then as soon as that's done,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5034720","5037280"," they're going to max out the pricing in trade"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5037280","5038720"," for the ray cut."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5038720","5041960"," So watch out for the hands and the magic hands"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5041960","5046960"," and the shuffling of the cups, because I assure you,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5047920","5050400"," I assure you, the traders are watching for that,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5050400","5053240"," no, no, on that rate decision of no rate cuts,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5053240","5057480"," no rate increases in looking to enter that trade price in."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5058560","5060680"," With all that doom and gloom in the background"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5060680","5063000"," to actually buy that dip and run that shit up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5064360","5066520"," No matter what they're telling you in public."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5071360","5073240"," It's absolutely crazy, the price of burgers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5073240","5074800"," Absolutely fucking crazy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5074800","5076680"," There ain't no way that some of these companies"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5076680","5078200"," are getting out of this unscathed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5078200","5080360"," There ain't no fucking way."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5080360","5082040"," No way."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5082040","5082880"," No way, no how."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5082880","5084760"," As a matter of fact, we used to see this all the time, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5084760","5086080"," We'd saw it with like,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5086320","5088920"," tell me some restaurants that didn't make it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5088920","5090480"," How about Howard Johnson's?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5090480","5092240"," We're off top of my head."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5092240","5094640"," Way way back in the day, Howard Johnson's was the place, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5094640","5097400"," They were like the holiday end of the world."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5097400","5100080"," They had Hojo's, I think was the name of the restaurant."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5100080","5102320"," They didn't fucking make it, did they?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5102320","5104440"," And you're going to see more of that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5104440","5106920"," Teachees, that's another one right there, teachees."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5108440","5110720"," So I'm looking for those companies to,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5110720","5112840"," or companies that, looking for companies"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5112840","5115360"," that are raising their prices to the point"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5115360","5118000"," where people are unwilling to pay them."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5119000","5121080"," And there's hurt there for those companies."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5122080","5124320"," Steak and ale, yeah, I remember that place."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5124320","5125640"," York Steakhouse, remember that one?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5125640","5127320"," That was from the way early 80s."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5128840","5130160"," But I want you to think about that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5130160","5132640"," Think about like, can a company,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5133600","5136120"," or when does a company surpass"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5136120","5138880"," what customers are willing to pay?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5138880","5140240"," When did you just come to a point where you go,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5140240","5142160"," fuck this, I ain't buying this anymore."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5143160","5145440"," You know, and if you do that,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5145440","5148600"," if you're like, fuck this, I ain't going there anymore,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5148600","5150280"," that's when they fail."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5150280","5151960"," They have like a critical moment"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5151960","5155960"," where not enough people are spending money in those places"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5155960","5158560"," and they will have a failure that's unseen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5161360","5162200"," Morning, crazy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5162200","5163040"," How are you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5164680","5165680"," Oh, you're sick too, dude."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5165680","5167400"," I'm sick as a dog right now, brother."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5167400","5168480"," Like super sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5168480","5170280"," I have a temperature right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5170320","5172000"," I'm violent ale right now, man."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5174240","5176080"," Oh, dude, we had like the whole family."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5176080","5177160"," It's like yesterday."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5178000","5180920"," I woke up yesterday morning to do the show"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5180920","5182680"," and my wife's like, are you right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5182680","5183960"," I'm like, no."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5183960","5186040"," I'm like, every morning I wake up"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5186040","5187680"," and know I can do things,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5187680","5189520"," and this morning I cannot."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5189520","5193400"," And my, she was asking me because my kids felt the same way"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5193400","5195600"," and my wife felt the same way."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5195600","5197680"," So we all stayed home yesterday"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5197680","5199680"," who were all bundled up in blankets."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5199680","5202240"," Like, kids have like tissue hanging out of their noses."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5202240","5203880"," They're home today too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5203880","5206520"," Kids and wife are home again today."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5206520","5207920"," No work, no school."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5211320","5213160"," It feels right to blame them, me too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5214840","5215920"," They're fucking dirty."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5218360","5219520"," Let's take a look at a small,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5219520","5221000"," and I'll work granular level here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5221000","5222280"," Let's take a look at the one minute chart."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5222280","5223720"," Let's see what's going on here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5224720","5226520"," What's happening here with the bulls?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5228040","5229240"," So we've got our, hi, Kitty."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5229240","5230080"," How are you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5230080","5231160"," You want to say hi?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5232000","5233160"," I'm a per."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5233160","5235000"," I'm a frisky this morning."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5235880","5236720"," You frisky?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5238360","5239640"," You are a frisky, aren't you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5239640","5241280"," Look at that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5241280","5242440"," It's your frisky on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5243440","5245360"," She's out there at the door every night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5245360","5248320"," She's out there like, she's a young cat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5248320","5250080"," Found her in a wood pile."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5250080","5251400"," But she goes out to the door at night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5251400","5252760"," Time she's like,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5252760","5257160"," ooh, I'm like, what are you doing?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5258160","5259800"," I'm like, what are you doing?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5259800","5261440"," She's like, are you, are you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5261440","5263880"," I'm like, oh, you're trying to get laid, aren't you?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5264960","5266360"," So I just want to go outside,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5266360","5267440"," be a woman of the night."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5267440","5269960"," I'm like, no, no, we're not doing that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5269960","5271680"," Hang outside and be a woman of the fucking night"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5271680","5272520"," in the springtime."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5272520","5273880"," We ain't doing that shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5275320","5277480"," So she's like, if you're not going to let me outside,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5277480","5280360"," I'm just going to come and jump all over you"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5280360","5281960"," twice a day or something."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5287200","5290360"," Okay, I'm losing the camera here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5292040","5294040"," I might be losing the show here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5297280","5299120"," Yeah, so, hi, Kitty."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5300440","5302760"," Right down here, just watching."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5302760","5303760"," Hi, oh."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5306480","5308800"," And this, we already know one thing I want to let you know"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5308800","5310520"," if something is don't ever get caught."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5313040","5315920"," Don't ever get caught right in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5317240","5318920"," Very dangerous here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5318920","5320120"," Let the algorithms do the work."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5320120","5322840"," If we break above, we know what to do, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5322840","5326680"," Look for a pullback and confirmation above this right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5326680","5328440"," Don't get rolled to the downside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5328440","5329880"," All that super dangerous in here,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5329880","5331840"," like really dangerous trading in here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5331840","5333200"," It's good trading down here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5333200","5335760"," Awesome trade, awesome trade."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5335760","5337120"," But don't get caught in here"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5337120","5340640"," because you can get blasted by our ore seller."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5340640","5343960"," Have your trade on your thesis lined up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5348160","5352160"," So if you want to set up a long trade, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5352160","5355000"," You want to be like jotting the spotlight right there"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5355000","5358240"," and then have a way to place a pull down place."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5358240","5359720"," Let me draw this out for you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5365960","5368680"," You got this little bad boy right here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5371160","5373840"," Right there, that's your first target to the upside."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5377160","5382160"," You got another one right in here, whoop, right there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5407160","5408160"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5429440","5430960"," Somewhere just like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5435120","5436120"," Something like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5437160","5444160"," You got one deaf, one blind eye together there, functional cat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5455160","5458560"," Did I see the squatters BS in Queens, New York, lady?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5458560","5464560"," No, but I did see a squatter thing with someone in Seattle."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5465560","5467560"," I saw a squatter thing on Reddit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5471560","5475560"," She got arrested for changing the locks on her."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5477560","5478560"," I can't see the million."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5478560","5480560"," It's a $1 million house."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5481560","5482560"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5488560","5493560"," I didn't see the story, so I can't comment on it, but I didn't see it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5495560","5499560"," I saw the one story where the guy was a professional squatter"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5499560","5502560"," and he's squatting in a rental home or something."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5504560","5505560"," Hi kitty."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5508560","5510560"," She needs a back scratch of some kind."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5519560","5520560"," Ow, ow."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5521560","5523560"," All right, I'm scratching your back."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5530560","5533560"," Just chewing on my, my earpiece now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5534560","5535560"," All right."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5546560","5550560"," Gas and rent and Arkansas supposed to be cheaper than cost living"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5550560","5553560"," or paying three, seven, even four gout dollars a gallon right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5556560","5557560"," Squatting is a weird thing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5557560","5560560"," It's like, for me, I'm like, you want to squat?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5560560","5561560"," Like, you want to squat?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5561560","5562560"," Like, come to Detroit and squat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5566560","5567560"," Like, come here and squat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5568560","5569560"," I love to see you squat in Detroit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5570560","5571560"," They're not going to squat Detroit, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5571560","5573560"," You're going to squat somewhere nice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5584560","5586560"," I just think it's show you this part over here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5591560","5592560"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5597560","5598560"," I'm going to take some medicine here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5598560","5599560"," Give me a couple seconds."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5599560","5601560"," Starting to feel like shit already."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5601560","5602560"," Give me like a few seconds here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5611560","5612560"," Fucking day cool."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5612560","5613560"," I've been pounding NyQuil dude."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5613560","5615560"," NyQuil's fucking awesome."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5615560","5617560"," NyQuil's like."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5618560","5622560"," I shouldn't shouldn't say this, but like, like, this is the first time"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5622560","5627560"," I'm drinking this, uh, daytime shit, but like, the NyQuil?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5627560","5632560"," Like, if you get the flu, it's like, what are you doing over there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5632560","5633560"," Oh, no, no, no, no."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5633560","5634560"," How are you doing?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5634560","5636560"," I like it's my own personal bottle of NyQuil."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5636560","5638560"," I don't share it with the wife and the kids."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5638560","5639560"," It's mine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5639560","5641560"," You got my own NyQuil bottle."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5648560","5650560"," You guys ever do that with NyQuil as an adult?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5650560","5651560"," Just start pounding it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5654560","5657560"," I'll drink it until it fucking makes me fucking go out and go like black out."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5662560","5663560"," So I got some pounding day cool."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5663560","5664560"," This stuff's nasty."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5665560","5668560"," This shit keeps you like functional in a really bad way."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5668560","5673560"," Definitely do not do what I do with this shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5693560","5695560"," Yeah, the NyQuil shit is baller."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5695560","5697560"," Like, of course we can't have nice things."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5698560","5701560"," You used to be able to fucking go out there and get methamphetamine in the cough syrup."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5701560","5702560"," You can't do that anymore."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5703560","5706560"," Fucking people out there fucking all the crackheads."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5711560","5713560"," I didn't know how bad it was."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5713560","5719560"," So, like, I went to, um, I went to North Carolina and I was sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5720560","5724560"," And I was like, give me one of them, like, give me one of them DXM things down there."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5724560","5726560"," Like, sir, we're gonna have to arrest you right here in the spot."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5726560","5727560"," I'm like, what are you talking about?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5728560","5731560"," They're like, we're in dry county and all our medicine is dry, too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5731560","5733560"," It's like, just like the army."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5733560","5736560"," You'd take some of that out of your proof and over there and go about your business."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5736560","5738560"," I was like, what are you talking about?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5738560","5741560"," Wasn't living anywhere where there's, like, meth problems?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5742560","5745560"," North Carolina is the first place I went where they had, like, a meth problem."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5749560","5751560"," Yeah, really for everybody else."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5751560","5753560"," I'm like, I just felt so bad."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5753560","5756560"," They're like, they had it behind, like, fucking four layers of plexiglass."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5756560","5757560"," It was all locked up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5758560","5760560"," They're like, what do you need that for?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5760560","5761560"," I'm like, I'm fucking sick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5762560","5763560"," God damn, give me the medicine."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5765560","5766560"," Sorry."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5767560","5768560"," Brandi mixed with hot water for a bed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5769560","5770560"," You're a ton of garlic."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5771560","5772560"," Oh, you know what I did do?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5773560","5782560"," I forced myself last night to eat, um, oxtail, uh, stew that I had made and froze."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5783560","5784560"," And that shit helped."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5785560","5787560"," Like a real one, not a fake bullshit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5787560","5789560"," Like, this is like with real stock, real everything."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5791560","5792560"," Oh, yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5792560","5793560"," You like that right there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5793560","5794560"," What's that right there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5796560","5797560"," Oh, yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5804560","5806560"," Yeah, meth problem."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5806560","5809560"," Counties have really affordable starter homes."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5810560","5811560"," Oh, yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5811560","5817560"," Dude, I was like, oxtail was like, it was like, it was like, it made it all from scratch."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5818560","5824560"," So it's like, it's like that chicken noodle soup for the heart or the, you know, like the soul or whatever they say."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5825560","5826560"," I fucking, I was like, I'm eating this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5826560","5827560"," I don't care."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5827560","5828560"," I'm going to eat it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5828560","5830560"," And it felt better afterwards, believe it or not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5831560","5835560"," I had lots of garlic, shallots, wine, all the other good stuff in it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5840560","5847560"," Uh, no, but I do wonder if we're going to have a rotation in cities."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5847560","5848560"," That's what I think is going to happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5848560","5853560"," I think we're going to get a rotation out of a rotation out of, but."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5853560","5862560"," I think our cities are going to turn into, if you've never been to Asia, if you've been to, I'm like a megalopolis type city."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5862560","5865560"," I think our city is going to turn into more into those."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5866560","5869560"," Uh, I think Seattle is a good example of it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5870560","5876560"," Um, where you're going to pay a million dollars for an apartment, basically."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5877560","5879560"," Uh, and I think that you're going to see."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5879560","5886560"," Uh, our mid sized cities, uh, be more reminiscent of what people think of as a city or a, or a prop."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5886560","5892560"," It's a good example of one of these cities would be, um, uh, what's that place in Ohio?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5892560","5893560"," Hold on here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5896560","5906560"," Uh, there's a place in Ohio. I just went to recently, not Dayton, the other."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5906560","5910560"," The other, uh, let me look up. Oh, hi, I really quick."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5921560","5922560"," Uh, Columbus."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5923560","5930560"," Uh, Columbus, Ohio is a great example of a mid sized city that is overall doing very well for itself."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5931560","5940560"," And reminds me in his reminiscence of a, maybe an early San Francisco coming around or, uh, an early Santa Monica."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5940560","5946560"," Yeah. Uh, so if you're like looking for that city that's not, um, that megalopolis, I don't know if you guys ever go to Asia,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","5946560","5953560"," if you're going to like, uh, China or to Japan, Korea, um, Hong Kong, any of those places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5953560","5957560"," That's what Seattle's reminding me of that kind of a place. LA."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5957560","5965560"," LA is just like absorbing and swallowing up, uh, surrounding communities, counties, things like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5965560","5970560"," I don't think it gets particularly better."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5970560","5972560"," Uh, in those places."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5977560","5988560"," Yeah, Columbus though was, Columbus used to be kind of like a slow boat town, wasn't it? Like, uh, let's say early 2000s."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5988560","5994560"," Uh, was, is Columbus of 2000 the same Columbus as of 2020? Let me ask you that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","5994560","6000560"," I don't think that it is. Um, I've been there, you know, here and there over the decades."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6000560","6002560"," It's one of the ones that I noticed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6007560","6016560"," I think like Dayton tried to be Columbus and this failed a little bit at it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6027560","6030560"," Just squeeze and play right now against people that are hedging."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6037560","6045560"," You know, there's someone out there at home right now that has hedged tomorrow's event and they're pissed off at this exact moment right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6045560","6047560"," They're like, God damn it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6047560","6051560"," Can I just put a hedge on the fucking rate decision and just have it stay down?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6055560","6060560"," There's someone on Twitter right now that's like, someone to Twitter that's like,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6060560","6064560"," I sold this shit right up here, baby."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6064560","6066560"," I'm hedged to the tits."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6068560","6071560"," And they're like watching this fraction right here and they're like,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6075560","6077560"," Hold on a second here."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6086560","6089560"," He's like, I'm going away. I'm going to eat your cords today."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6095560","6096560"," Sorry."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6102560","6103560"," Damn cat."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6108560","6110560"," Sorry, that's it. Doors closed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6111560","6114560"," Can't do it. Can't do the kitty today doing it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6125560","6126560"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6129560","6133560"," Good morning out there. Hey, David. Good morning, man. How are you? Good to see you, brother."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6135560","6137560"," Are y'all doing out there? How are you doing, David?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6143560","6148560"," Oh, she's screaming for me. Can you hear her? She's like the door. She's like,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6154560","6156560"," Oh, she's like the door. She's like the door."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6159560","6160560"," Silly human."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6167560","6170560"," They're not nice, man. Cats are not nice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6178560","6181560"," They're their meanies. They're not nice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6184560","6186560"," They're not nice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6189560","6192560"," They're not nice. They're not nice. They're not nice."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6194560","6196560"," I'm making it known right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6199560","6202560"," Hey, yeah. What's up? I read some. I was reading a,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6202560","6205560"," if you're from Europe, I was reading about that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6206560","6209560"," France is preparing to send troops to the border, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6209560","6211560"," What's the deal on that?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6212560","6216560"," Do you think that NATO is ready to intervene or not?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6219560","6221560"," We already know there's troops on the ground."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6222560","6224560"," There's always been troops on the ground, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6225560","6227560"," There's many other troops are always on the ground."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6228560","6232560"," I saw that with France, though, putting troops at the borders."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6233560","6234560"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6235560","6237560"," It's you're saying it's just Macron."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6239560","6241560"," I know the U.S. is doing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6242560","6244560"," I know what the U.S. is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6245560","6247560"," I cannot talk with the U.S. is doing."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6248560","6249560"," But I know the U.S. is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6250560","6252560"," The U.S. is ready to fuck around and find out."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6253560","6255560"," I know that for sure. 100%."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6256560","6258560"," Oh, it has you, really?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6262560","6264560"," Italy doesn't agree with troops."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6265560","6266560"," There's a lot of euros in this audience."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6267560","6268560"," I wonder what their thoughts are on."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6271560","6274560"," Is the UN trying to set a stage of some kind?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6275560","6279560"," Yeah, you've noticed a lot of escalation and media noise over the past couple of months."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6281560","6284560"," The U.S. needs to switch or is switching to."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6285560","6286560"," Between a Serbian Kosovo."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6287560","6288560"," That sucks."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6289560","6290560"," It sucks big time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6298560","6299560"," It sucks big time."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6304560","6306560"," I'm trying to prepare people mentally for actual conflict."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6307560","6309560"," Other NATO countries don't seem to agree."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6311560","6312560"," I'll say this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6313560","6318560"," I'm not going to say anything that I'm not going to say anything other than this, but I will say this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6319560","6321560"," It's a very important thing in life."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6322560","6325560"," That I didn't know until I was in the Army."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6327560","6328560"," Everything."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6329560","6330560"," Everything."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6331560","6332560"," That was on the news."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6332560","6338560"," It didn't matter if it was Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, did not matter."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6339560","6340560"," Everything."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6341560","6342560"," Was a lie."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6343560","6344560"," All of it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6345560","6347560"," It was never what was actually happening."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6348560","6351560"," I would sit in a defak or a con-ex or whatever."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6352560","6355560"," Eating and I'd be like, what the fuck are they talking about right now?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6356560","6358560"," They have like AFN network and stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6359560","6361560"," And they would play U.S. News."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6362560","6364560"," It was never what was actually taking place."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6365560","6372560"," So whenever I am as an adult now, an older person, whenever I watch the news,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6373560","6374560"," I'm like, none of this shit."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6375560","6376560"," None of this shit can be real."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6377560","6378560"," Positive that it's not real."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6379560","6383560"," Or whatever we being told is completely misdirected from what's really happening."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6384560","6385560"," So I can't comment."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6388560","6389560"," I can't comment on this, but."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6392560","6393560"," What I will tell you is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6397560","6399560"," I'll tell you, I mean, fuck around enough, dude."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6400560","6401560"," The U.S. does not play."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6402560","6403560"," Behind a closed door."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6404560","6405560"," They do not fucking play."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6407560","6408560"," We come off really easily."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6409560","6410560"," Americans come off really easily as."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6413560","6414560"," You know, are they going to be there?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6415560","6416560"," Are they going to be this?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6416560","6417560"," Are they going to be that?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6417560","6418560"," Truth is, out of closed door."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6419560","6420560"," They ain't fucking around."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6420560","6423560"," And they don't often show their hand is my point behind this."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6425560","6426560"," Before until it's too late."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6429560","6430560"," And they are committed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6430560","6431560"," So they've always been committed."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6431560","6432560"," They always will be."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6432560","6436560"," I know we come off as a certain thing in the public view, but behind a closed door."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6437560","6438560"," Any like that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6439560","6440560"," The U.S. don't fuck around."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6441560","6443560"," It can seem like it's not real, but it is."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6451560","6452560"," Yeah."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6453560","6458560"," And Drake saying, even though I'm living in France, this is one of the reasons why I haven't made the actual documentation to get my double."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6459560","6462560"," Nationale, I don't feel safe becoming a French citizen right now as a military agent."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6463560","6464560"," I'm going to tell you right now that."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6466560","6468560"," Like a flip, flip, flip of a switch."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6469560","6470560"," Like it's literally a flip of a switch."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6472560","6473560"," They did it in World War II, too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6474560","6475560"," And they did it in Iraq."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6475560","6476560"," The first Iraq war."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6476560","6477560"," Even the second one, they did it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6478560","6479560"," They'll call back."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6480560","6481560"," I don't think this is real."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6482560","6483560"," This will happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6483560","6489560"," This is like more of the fantasy land stuff, but I've talked to my friends like until I'm 65."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6489560","6491560"," I think it's like 60 or 65."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6491560","6492560"," I can be called back."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6493560","6495560"," Either way, it's just a training environment."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6496560","6497560"," Maybe they're just training young soldiers."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6497560","6498560"," My wife can be called."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6498560","6500560"," My wife and I are both veterans."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6500560","6503560"," Both honorably discharged veterans from the U.S. Army."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6503560","6504560"," It's a matter in the Army."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6505560","6506560"," They will call everybody up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6507560","6508560"," They'll call you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6508560","6510560"," No matter what your age is, they will call you up."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6510560","6511560"," Every single person."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6512560","6513560"," They call all of you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6513560","6515560"," They did it to my aunt's."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6516560","6517560"," What am I on?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6517560","6518560"," It's called back."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6518560","6519560"," That was a pilot."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6520560","6521560"," That was just Iraq."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6522560","6524560"," So if you had another war, like if you had a potential to war,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6525560","6526560"," you're going no matter what."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6527560","6528560"," You're going to get drafted."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6529560","6531560"," If you're young, you're likely to see me."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6532560","6533560"," I'll likely be there with you."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6536560","6537560"," And that's what they did."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6537560","6538560"," In World War I, they did it."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6538560","6539560"," They did it in World War II."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6540560","6542560"," To some extent, they did it in Korea as well."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6543560","6546560"," They called back World War II veterans to train soldiers for Korea."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6548560","6550560"," So they do plan this stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6551560","6552560"," They are ready for it if it does kick off."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6553560","6554560"," And I hope it doesn't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6555560","6558560"," I don't want you to think out there that I am in any way, shape or form pro war."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6559560","6560560"," I'm not."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6561560","6562560"," It's one of the worst things you can ever have happen."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6563560","6564560"," We were just discussing with you earlier, right?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6564560","6566560"," People with the fantasies about civil war."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6567560","6573560"," Shit or the tires rolling down Manhattan, like, you know, deflation of the kind people want."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6574560","6576560"," I said to you earlier, like it's, it's a dream."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6577560","6578560"," You don't want to ever be in that dream."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6579560","6580560"," In reality, you don't."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6585560","6586560"," Yeah, it's a geopolitical game, absolutely."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6588560","6589560"," It's a, it's the hegemony of the world."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6590560","6591560"," Some extent too."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6592560","6593560"," There's a hegemony going on right now."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6595560","6596560"," In the world."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6597560","6600560"," What I, what, what book is it that I always recommended people to read?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6603560","6606560"," Is it called the next hundred years or something or America in the next hundred years?"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6608560","6609560"," It's fascinating."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6610560","6616560"," It's not completely going to be true, but it's fascinating because it's, um, it discusses, uh,"
"DKCfkwScFqo","6617560","6619560"," geopolitical, true geopolitics."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6619560","6622560"," A lot of times people don't want to know about geopolitics."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6622560","6623560"," Very sketchy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6623560","6624560"," Not sketchy."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6624560","6626560"," It's very gross to, to study."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6628560","6629560"," I think it's called them."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6629560","6631560"," I think it's called the next hundred years."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6634560","6635560"," I'm sick dude."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6635560","6636560"," David, I'm sick of their dog, man."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6636560","6637560"," I got a temperature."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6638560","6640560"," I'm loaded up on medicine and stuff."
"DKCfkwScFqo","6676560","6678560"," I'm sick of it."
