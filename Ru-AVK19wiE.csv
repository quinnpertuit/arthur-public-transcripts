"10120","11100"," Check 1-2."
"12200","14860"," I want to see if this actually works."
"21630","23310"," That was the other thing that I was missing here. "
"41800","43020"," Let me just second-air it out."
"43940","45100"," We got to adjust some stuff."
"46040","46860"," How's everybody doing?"
"47800","48900"," Hell yeah, it's my birthday. "
"51140","52520"," Thanks for all the birthday wishes."
"53160","53780"," Good to see you, Emerson."
"54240","56540"," Your wife's boyfriend, Gil, Iden, Dougie. "
"57860","58260"," Beatty."
"58260","58880"," Kind of weird."
"59040","61040"," I got a new setup going on over here. "
"62700","64220"," So I did some work this morning."
"64960","65920"," Thanks for having birthdays."
"65920","66580"," I appreciate it. "
"67040","67780"," Everybody's doing well."
"67880","68920"," Can you guys hear me well out there?"
"69840","73140"," I've got a trade the news back on for you today."
"74280","79000"," So you should be able to hear some of that this afternoon or coming into the afternoon at 12 o "
"79000","79300","'clock. "
"80940","82400"," I canceled Ben Zinga."
"82400","83980"," This is the second time I canceled Ben Zinga."
"84060","86840"," I think of all the news sites. "
"88020","89900"," Trade the news is going to have to be the one."
"90020","91960"," There isn't a better one, which is kind of shocking."
"93100","99300"," You could just buy a Bloomberg terminal for 20 grand a year and read off the news and make a"
"99300","100300"," ton of money. "
"100300","103360"," Believe it or not, well, it's not really the news."
"103620","106380"," There's a, there's like a tech system on Bloomberg news."
"106400","107500"," That's where they get their news. "
"108460","109540"," So we're going to do."
"109640","114460"," We're going to stick with trade the news because just between the delays and the emphasis and"
"114460","115000"," what's important."
"115760","117640"," I can't find anything better out there. "
"118840","121400"," Yeah, thanks for all the happy birthday as I appreciate it."
"121880","122680"," Good to see all of you."
"122820","123940"," Good to see all of you here. "
"123940","127100"," This is a frickin phrase ripper this morning."
"127539","131360"," I wasn't even paying attention to the market and then I was trying to get all this stuff set up."
"132020","137520"," And so I put, I plugged in the the flow this morning and then I'm like, well, I'm going to"
"137520","139040"," change some of the stuff around. "
"139220","144180"," I wanted to put some screens up higher and like one over another and that kind of stuff so that"
"144180","146980"," I have better eyes aren't looking everywhere."
"149680","154200"," So right now, we, so we did, it looks like we hit a top at 449 70."
"154500","155780"," I'm going to talk to you briefly. "
"156240","161600"," Now, spot camera this morning said, I think they said, let me go to what spot camera said actually."
"165240","171120"," They just give me a quick second here because they did give some support levels if you are long."
"171120","175140"," And we'll take a look at book map currently right now. "
"175220","181240"," We know we've got VWAP down here at 448 32 and then we'll look lower for more support."
"181460","183280"," There seems to be some ice down here."
"183600","186200"," There was also a previous support down below here at 447. "
"188220","189420"," We'll try to take a look here."
"189580","194860"," There's a little bit of a gap in here too big supports that 441 32."
"195260","198020"," I don't know if we go down that far at the moment. "
"200520","203340"," We did just we just did just test support though at 450."
"205260","208260"," And then spot gamma gave some notes this morning."
"208640","210200"," I briefly read through them. "
"210580","214520"," Let me take a look at them real quick and see what they let gave us support for the day."
"215840","217240"," I haven't paying too much attention."
"217860","224320"," I had a breakfast with my family this morning, so I'm a little out of a little out of touch"
"224320","224800"," at the moment. "
"224800","230500"," Okay, so support lies at 4456 and 441 mark that on your charts."
"230580","233080"," I haven't even charted this morning out yet."
"233100","234740"," So I have to do that for myself as well. "
"236260","238220"," I'm gonna have to actually get off to do that right now."
"239020","240420"," Let me just a quick second here to get set up."
"293990","298070"," Which I'm actually quite surprised if you're looking at the chart for today. "
"298070","303630"," The resistance is at 4480 and 4500."
"304810","308110"," So I'll try to bring this chart up for you guys right now."
"308310","311710"," And we'll take a look at the chart for the day from spot gamma. "
"312170","316010"," There was another point in their note this morning that we want to be looking at."
"319770","321010"," Let me see if I get this one."
"321210","324070"," This one right here. "
"324070","324890"," 4456."
"325310","327290"," Okay, so we'll bring this over real quick."
"327870","332250"," So this right here, 441, 44310, I believe is the other one. "
"332350","333210"," So right in here."
"333670","335250"," See this yellow line that I have."
"337030","339110"," This is considered support here. "
"339450","341130"," Just regard this white line right here."
"341530","342850"," And then your second support."
"343150","344150"," I'll put them in right now. "
"344410","348370"," So you've got S1 down here."
"349330","352550"," We've got a small S there."
"354730","356730"," So this is S1 right here. "
"357030","363330"," And then S2 is right here."
"366390","368930"," And then R1 is 4487."
"370870","371770"," Let's see if I get that right. "
"374810","376290"," Put a 4480."
"377670","384790"," So 4480 above, which is outstanding above our first resistance line here."
"394470","398710"," And then R2 is right where we stand right here. "
"407850","415690"," And we have an implied move today of 0.82%. We're already trading outside of our implied move of"
"415690","419230"," the day at 1.03%. So this has been a very excellent day."
"419510","425870"," We also have some nice consolidation here from 1030 this morning into the 12 o'clock hour."
"426310","429090"," When we're this bullish, typically we have a little bit of a rollover later in the day. "
"429270","433910"," That lunchtime rollover between 1 and 2pm and then we rip higher."
"435070","438270"," So the question becomes, are we going to trade higher than 4450?"
"438270","445350"," We also saw today, if you were watching Flowago this morning, I scrolled through briefly and you"
"445350","447490"," could see the bid in the market."
"447790","455510"," Yesterday on Twitter, I posted a link to the number of calls that were placed across the market"
"455510","458790"," starting on the 18th until yesterday. "
"458790","466850"," And it was one of the largest call buying streaks in the history of the stock market was the past"
"466850","468370"," three to four days."
"468690","474750"," I'm asking just saying that the crisis is likely to spur digital currency considerations globally."
"476630","482570"," And what that leads to is a so someone asked me yesterday, I said, what do you think of it?"
"482630","485430"," And I said, well, I'm very I'm very scared of what's happening. "
"485430","491810"," And the reason that I brought that up was because, well, twofold, there's a companion piece story."
"493330","497470"," Softbank has been highlighted the past week in our newspapers."
"498190","501490"," And so the first question is, is this a bid from Softbank?"
"501930","508530"," The second question that brings up though historically is that there it creates a melt up type"
"508530","509010"," situation. "
"509590","515890"," The only problem with it is when you make a spike like that, that on the flip on the backside"
"515890","524770"," of that trade, it typically proceeds or a melt up or excuse me, a crash proceeds or falls after the"
"524770","526470"," initial melt up from those trades."
"527170","532750"," And so that's where the risk comes into this trade is that we've been going up for I want to"
"532750","534350"," say six days now at this point."
"534350","538030"," And the bid into the market is just absolutely insane. "
"538550","544870"," The bid in Spy and SPX even this morning was beautiful and gorgeous because what it does is it"
"544870","546430"," expands our market."
"546510","547630"," I'm scrolling through it right now."
"547870","553050"," Matter of fact, I'm going to go back over here and take a look into the bid on SPX and"
"553050","554550"," on the Spy today. "
"555130","556170"," And the biggest takeaway."
"556670","559530"," So I'm in a different window right now in the discord jet."
"560530","564470"," We have $7.1 million and SPX that rolled in today. "
"565190","572570"," And that is for December 16 4900 C and then March 23 45 10."
"573490","579050"," So mark that down right 45 10 on on your charts right as a price target."
"579870","583930"," That's usually a prop decks desk that's throwing those those calls out there. "
"584850","591510"," For a longer period of time and then and bolstering the market for a longer period of time and then"
"591510","593790"," and then throwing on some calls on top of it all."
"594070","599210"," The other neat part was the bid that came into spy this morning, which is quite substantial."
"599990","607130"," We had calls come in for 460 for April 22nd, which allows us to print up to we've talked"
"607130","613810"," about that. "
"613810","618350"," And we saw that this morning at 1049, we saw calls come in for April 22nd."
"618570","620750"," I've got it highlighted right now on the discord."
"621490","622690"," I can't I can't scroll. "
"622910","626990"," I can't show it to you on YouTube because I have it all set up on a different a different"
"626990","627750"," rig right now."
"628550","637110"," But these April 2460 calls expands where we can go in this market and also the the the the the"
"637110","642350"," call wall and the absolute gamma that 1.6 million was able to push us up this morning."
"642350","643410"," Into that 450. "
"644590","646990"," And so you want to see stuff like this."
"647310","651710"," Now the other aspect to this is I want to if you can look at this on the right hand"
"651710","656410"," side, you also saw an expansion in spy puts today."
"656990","663930"," They began at 930 and haven't they haven't relented until 1130 this afternoon, almost 17 million"
"663930","665590"," dollars in spy puts. "
"665590","671030"," And so you're looking for how deep are those puts in this market and they're not deep at all."
"671030","673110"," These are all in the money type puts."
"673330","674630"," We've got some down at 429. "
"675030","678850"," We've got a hedge down below here for March 22nd."
"678910","683650"," It was it was it was on my birthday today, but they expire on May 20."
"684560","694230"," 429 P for 8, 10, 11 million dollars in spy puts to 429, but that's nowhere near as deep"
"694230","697070"," as 400 or 4000 P."
"697370","703930"," And the assumption would be that we shouldn't get down to for that if you if you see those 4000"
"703930","710090"," P's that are out there floating around out there as long as we don't see aggressive put pying down"
"710090","712790"," at 360s 90s 400s. "
"713590","720170"," 405s rolling into those previous positions and we start to see some relenting in the puts that are"
"720170","720730"," put out there."
"721170","728130"," 429 looks like the lower bound and if anything would even cement further a lower bound that's"
"728130","730030"," probably 430 or 440."
"730810","735710"," So how deep can we go if the market rolls over right now from the puts that are out there. "
"735730","739810"," It doesn't look like the expansion goes any deeper than 440 from here."
"739810","743030"," Can we trade lower than they're sure more put roll in."
"743270","749230"," But when you're seeing this hedging come in at 429, it starts to it starts to stop the market from"
"749230","750170"," having that. "
"750350","755450"," Excuse me, when you start to see this call in market wide expansioning calls, if you were looking"
"755450","762790"," at that post yesterday, the we it was 800 to 10 or so or 800 to 100 on individual ticker"
"762790","763190"," expansion."
"764010","767850"," But the expansion on calls on the ETFs were below 100."
"768130","770710"," They're at like 70 or something, which is bearish. "
"771030","779010"," But today we saw today expansion and calls on the on individual indexes, which is a positive for"
"779010","779810"," the market."
"779810","787090"," And further, you're not seeing an expansion and puts down to 405, let's say 390, which is what we"
"787090","788470"," saw last month."
"788470","795210"," It starts to raise the put wall down below from that 400 from the call buying and the expansioning"
"795210","795790"," calls today. "
"796090","800150"," And it also raises the bottom on the market from 400."
"800690","808570"," I would from what this looks like the bottom should be right now, no more than let's call it 440"
"808570","809390"," right now."
"809390","816210"," Maybe a quick trip down below to 435, but the market is tightening up or excuse me, at least the"
"816210","820910"," the the put wall below the bottom of the market is coming up. "
"821290","828930"," Let's say to 440 and we're actually expanding and raising how high we can go on the call side."
"828930","833030"," Now we haven't seen for 70s and for 80s yet."
"833270","836850"," So this looks like a good target at 450 for currently. "
"837250","842010"," Now you want to start seeing more calls at 465 and 470."
"842710","849690"," When you start to see calls at 465 and 470, you'll see and move higher than say 45 10."
"850110","855850"," You'll start to look for 4,600 if we start to see 4,700 from this point forward. "
"856490","862190"," So I'm going to I'm going to go back now to the regular call call buying and options buying in"
"862190","862550"," the market."
"863510","870390"," But it is it is positive to see that the put buying we have aggressive put buying currently 17"
"870390","875870"," million dollars inputs against the market, but in no way shape or form."
"875870","881890"," Are those going to be starting work this year to add climate risk to its own capital rules for the"
"881890","882230"," ECB. "
"883690","888310"," In no way are you seeing puts out there that are that are deep deep outside of the money."
"888670","890430"," And that was the fear from spot gamma."
"890430","892010"," This one I'll bring this back over here. "
"892070","897050"," And this was there as their notes from this morning, which is critical to the market."
"897850","898950"," And it's right."
"899070","899730"," I think it's right here. "
"899890","900270"," Let me take a look."
"902310","903210"," Right over here."
"903410","904730"," I'm going to show it to you guys right now. "
"904830","907630"," The point is that we see gamma flow is offering little influence to markets, the current aspects"
"907630","908070"," prices."
"908590","912630"," As long as the market holds greater than 440, then VAN are delta hedging impact due to a change in"
"912630","915030"," implied volatility is still supplying a bit of support."
"915650","920310"," If the market does drift higher to 4,500 call wall then positive gamma resistance should increase. "
"920610","930250"," Therefore, VAN would shift neutral again would start to act as resistance should market sell off."
"930250","935950"," We still see little support because of the put heads destruction over the last week."
"936170","940430"," If traders elect to purchase puts, which adds to the other negative delta, this could coincide with"
"940430","941110"," the spike in IV. "
"941770","944590"," Both of these factors would add speed to any drawdown."
"944950","947650"," And the key there is speed to any drawdown."
"947970","951910"," The idea being that without expansion on the call side. "
"952830","961230"," And with just still this open interest that three, believe it or not, 360 to 400, right, that"
"961230","965490"," there's this cliff that we can fall back upon once the call stopped coming in."
"965750","966430"," But they didn't."
"966570","972210"," They came in today and further bears don't see us going that deep down any longer. "
"972530","977750"," They're now saying, I'm only going to get 4.29s. So at this point for right now, even if the"
"977750","982390"," market were to trade sideways to find new support to trade higher."
"983510","989810"," I don't see any dip down below for 40 currently, which is very positive for this market because"
"989810","993850"," before today, there was no call expansion on indexes."
"993850","1001010"," The only positive news from yesterday for the melt up that I could find end of day was the extreme"
"1001010","1004930"," call buying on individual tickers and not the ETFs. "
"1004930","1007350"," You didn't see ETF call buying yesterday."
"1007830","1009750"," Now today you did see a call buying."
"1010030","1013270"," We traded higher to forty four nine point seven zero. "
"1014310","1019810"," And if you're looking for a tag higher, we know that we have some or some in the money SPX"
"1019810","1023829"," calls that are expiring on the thirty first for forty five ten."
"1025530","1027030"," So let me bring this over here."
"1028310","1029450"," And I was looking higher. "
"1029710","1033810"," The one other thing that I was looking for, you see this resistance above there at forty five"
"1033810","1034089"," hundred."
"1034089","1039069"," If you're looking for another target, you're not seeing any call structure."
"1039069","1042930"," When you see black above, it means that there's no call structure there. "
"1043250","1048530"," But here are two more resistance above us, four fifty two point fifty."
"1048930","1052750"," Then we have some more targets above of four fifty five."
"1053530","1059250"," We'll take a look even higher and you can see for sixty sitting there just waiting for us. "
"1059250","1061570"," We'll see how much is up on the four seventy."
"1061990","1066010"," There are announcing a spectrum high performance data center networking infrastructure platform."
"1068090","1075610"," We have some more resistance here at four sixty eight nineteen four sixty six oh six four sixty"
"1075610","1076610"," four ninety six. "
"1077910","1080930"," A little bump here in the road at four sixty three fifty."
"1083550","1085490"," Some sellers at four sixty."
"1086150","1088930"," Let me bring this back here. "
"1089070","1095550"," This seems to be where all the trouble is four fifty five fifty four fifty six flat."
"1096210","1098050"," Seems like a large area of contention."
"1098710","1108500"," A little more than thirty minutes now to the European cash equity close"
"1108500","1110300"," the car car not more than one percent. "
"1110420","1112240"," The DAX also higher by one percent."
"1112480","1117000"," Well, treasury yields across the continent remain higher, but off session highs fifty basis points"
"1117000","1118180"," now in the German ten year."
"1125500","1127000"," Give me just a couple seconds here. "
"1137280","1140620"," So let's look down below and see if we can find some levels."
"1141300","1143120"," We know that we've got VWAP here."
"1143360","1146200"," You can see VWAP at four four eight point three six. "
"1146620","1149440"," Always a great intraday buying opportunity."
"1150220","1152800"," We also know that we've got four forty eight below it."
"1153060","1155100"," You can see this little bit of ice here. "
"1156540","1158960"," We're going to also look at four four five."
"1159340","1163460"," We got four four five zero down here, which is right down in here."
"1163700","1165760"," So look for a bounce also around. "
"1166080","1169780"," No, no deeper than four four six down below at least for today."
"1170560","1172560"," Let's take a look at a smaller time frame."
"1182680","1185920"," This is previous support back here at four four seven as well. "
"1185920","1204190"," And also"
"1204190","1210210"," note that yesterday the four forty support has moved up from four forty two four forty one"
"1210210","1212710"," seventeen another positive for the market."
"1219610","1220130"," Sweet."
"1225930","1227450"," Hey, thanks for saying heavy birthday. "
"1227650","1228190"," I appreciate it."
"1253480","1255960"," Give me just a second here if you get caught up."
"1273100","1274600"," Just this other little note. "
"1274740","1276540"," I just put this little line in here."
"1276540","1277700"," This one right here."
"1278760","1282900"," Just in case we trade down below looking for another dip by over here. "
"1295550","1296070"," Sweet."
"1296310","1298590"," I feel like I feel naked without trade the news."
"1298990","1299850"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1300770","1302730"," I'm stoked that it's back online."
"1303570","1304570"," I was really missing it."
"1304730","1305730"," I tried out. "
"1305890","1308430"," I want to say another four or five services."
"1309210","1311430"," I paid for I got like financial juice."
"1312070","1316370"," I got Ben Zinga and I'm going to have to remember some of them. "
"1316430","1318030"," I'm going to have to look at some of the ones I bought."
"1318310","1319210"," I forget the names of them."
"1320610","1322850"," But all of them were atrocious at best. "
"1323330","1324190"," I think two of them."
"1324550","1325150"," Maybe try."
"1325290","1326850"," I don't know if we tried four or five services. "
"1328210","1332590"," I think we tried four outside of trade the news and two of them."
"1333870","1335350"," Were delayed by."
"1336350","1337270"," Oh, I don't know. "
"1338030","1341570"," Anything on Twitter by anywhere from five minutes to a half an hour."
"1342170","1344810"," It's crazy was yesterday people said Ben Zinga."
"1345970","1347810"," Part of their news was down. "
"1348230","1350110"," Well, I put their news on this morning."
"1351470","1354010"," I'm like four or five this morning, five o'clock this morning."
"1354090","1359350"," I had a plan in the background and I listened to it till I want to say seven, thirty or"
"1359350","1359850"," eight o'clock. "
"1360270","1363190"," I was coming into the eight o'clock hour and they were giving a market update."
"1363910","1367950"," And what I did was I was tracking anything that they talked about."
"1368030","1369290"," I would just I would just pop it up. "
"1369430","1370310"," My screener, pop it up."
"1370430","1370850"," My screener."
"1371130","1377930"," And literally everything was it was like a half an hour late anywhere from anywhere from 15 minutes"
"1377930","1379810"," to one half hour late. "
"1379810","1380610"," And I was just shocked."
"1380810","1390670"," I was like, man, I was like, you could just have a you could you could sell that news"
"1390670","1393930"," and these guys sell it for 175 bucks or something."
"1394410","1399110"," So I was a little shocked at how long it how long it takes, how imperative it is to have"
"1399110","1400670"," news before it hits the market. "
"1400670","1405930"," You want to get the news in paper news like you get on a black box like you get on"
"1405930","1411210"," a Bloomberg terminal and not getting that is not a positive thing, right?"
"1411410","1416410"," You want to you want to be getting some of the look here."
"1416530","1418790"," I want to keep an eye on this and see if we keep trading down."
"1418790","1421850"," Another price target down below would be 44676. "
"1422790","1424710"," We'll take a look and see if there's any support in there."
"1426030","1427670"," If we break through this VWAP."
"1431930","1432330"," 44676. "
"1432790","1434890"," I'm not seeing it in here somewhere in here."
"1435050","1436490"," There's a tiny bit down here."
"1436610","1438250"," You can see a little bit of buyers right there. "
"1438870","1439810"," We'll see if this holds."
"1440050","1441410"," You can see it right in here."
"1441990","1446810"," And the other thing I almost didn't I almost didn't sign in because I've got a bunch of new"
"1446810","1448730"," indicators for BookMap. "
"1448950","1450230"," And I just haven't loaded them up yet."
"1450710","1451370"," I was like, you know what?"
"1451430","1453890"," I might just spend another hour loading indicators for these guys."
"1454350","1460390"," So I might at some point today log off of live stream so that I can load these things up"
"1460390","1460830"," for you. "
"1461350","1464790"," Because I got some kickass indicators for BookMap that we can start tracking."
"1465370","1471110"," And then I was also thinking about doing a class on BookMap, what you should be looking for, how to"
"1471110","1473390"," read the dome and that kind of stuff."
"1473390","1476370"," So at some point today, I'm probably going to sign off. "
"1476810","1478410"," And also it's my birthday today."
"1478750","1482950"," So before the end of the day, I'm going to do some stuff with my daughter."
"1483470","1486650"," My daughter this morning was loving on me. "
"1486650","1489550"," So I'm going to love on her and probably that's funny."
"1489670","1495870"," When it's your birthday, you end up taking them out rather than them taking you out."
"1496090","1498390"," You wind up loving on your kids. "
"1499910","1502590"," You got a quick bounce here on this spy."
"1504090","1506170"," We'll bring this back right here and just take a peek."
"1506890","1508310"," Saw this beautiful bounce right here. "
"1508870","1513610"," This was this is going back from the 18th here."
"1513890","1516750"," A point of or not a point of control, but a support."
"1517390","1519430"," We traded above support here. "
"1519470","1520670"," We had another tag right here."
"1520970","1523210"," And it looks like we're getting another tag currently right now."
"1523650","1525190"," So we'll see if we can trade this higher. "
"1525730","1528590"," Let's look on a larger time frame here for some resistance."
"1530130","1536020"," And see what we find for resistance above."
"1536160","1537620"," You see us above here, right?"
"1537820","1538740"," This is where we're trading now. "
"1539120","1542880"," We really have blue skies above this four, this four five zero."
"1543260","1549100"," If we can get above this zone right here, your next targets are going to be just below."
"1549400","1553760"," We're going to put one just below just below here. "
"1553760","1557900"," We're going to make this because the other thing to always consider when I'm out, when I'm doing"
"1557900","1559640"," traditional candlestick charting."
"1560000","1564600"," One of the things that I'm looking for is just a prior sell off, right?"
"1565020","1570560"," So back here you had call buyers, you had equity buyers, they're all stuck up in here."
"1571040","1573380"," And they're probably still holding and praying. "
"1573520","1577820"," Please Lord, get me back to four fifty eight light four fifty eight."
"1577840","1580360"," I swear I'll just take my lick and I'll get out, right?"
"1580360","1584360"," And so you try to make that, try to make it slightly before."
"1584560","1590840"," And you can see right in here four fifty eight forty four or so that we've got, we'll probably"
"1590840","1593640"," encounter some volatility as we trade higher. "
"1593720","1597320"," There's another little spot in here we can look at right in here."
"1597320","1599560"," You can see that some bulls got caught in there."
"1600180","1602300"," So we'll tag them and bag them here. "
"1602800","1606380"," And the next, so the next thing that we're looking for here is what?"
"1606860","1609120"," We don't want to see the rejection off here."
"1609120","1616160"," We want to see a trade higher over four fifty consolidation for another move up to two four sixty."
"1616520","1624220"," So the key now is to break above four fifty and then make this a new trading area above here. "
"1624680","1626540"," Two four fifty eight twelve."
"1627260","1630840"," We can do one more line above four sixty if you guys think hell yeah we're going to four sixty"
"1630840","1631080"," cap."
"1631460","1632140"," We can do that. "
"1633360","1636560"," We'll put like make it blue or some shit like that, make it thick."
"1637600","1640440"," So that we know this is the big boy up here for sixty."
"1641380","1643040"," And this is what you're looking for. "
"1643160","1645080"," And on this, this is a two hour chart here."
"1645560","1647800"," You can see in this two hour chart, two hour chart."
"1648380","1652980"," There's a nice clean wick below and the red bar above it here. "
"1653340","1657600"," The bulls are fighting to make this push above four fifty today."
"1665920","1667120"," Watching more bull."
"1667120","1671640"," An agricultural minister saying that so far they are not seeing any issues regarding the"
"1671640","1673560"," availability of raw materials globally. "
"1675720","1678180"," Watching further call expansion in the spy."
"1678700","1680680"," We have calls that just came in on SPX."
"1681660","1684600"," March thirty first forty five twenty C."
"1684900","1687260"," Forty five twenty C for one point four million dollars. "
"1687600","1691180"," Earlier this morning at ten forty nine you saw calls come in on SPX."
"1691540","1692680"," You saw ten million."
"1692880","1693860"," I think it was ten million dollars. "
"1693900","1695880"," It could be wrong, but I think that was the puts."
"1696460","1699420"," The hedging what I what you saw was SPX."
"1699620","1703920"," I think two or three million dollars on SPX calls at forty five ten C."
"1704400","1709200"," And that actually was the first push that we had up to test the upper bounds. "
"1709720","1712760"," So we're seeing more calls coming in at a slight slightly higher strike."
"1713200","1715860"," That's one point four million dollars on SPX."
"1722100","1723580"," We bring this back over here. "
"1760640","1761860"," Good to see everybody today."
"1762020","1762540"," How y'all doing."
"1767030","1769990"," Still have that resistance above at four fifty flat. "
"1779340","1780520"," I'll make sure I got my."
"1795930","1797770"," Make sure I got all my numbers right over here."
"1804490","1806210"," I got two charts rolling right now. "
"1806230","1809350"," I got a one on one screener and then one on another screener."
"1809890","1811210"," I got one for you for you guys."
"1811490","1812090"," Then one for me. "
"1813510","1817390"," Sometimes I'm getting transfer issues getting them back"
"1817390","1849040"," and forth."
"1849040","1850120"," Forty four fifty six."
"1852000","1853020"," Yeah, I got that in there. "
"1853280","1854940"," Forty four three zero right is the other one."
"1855060","1855780"," Forty four three one."
"1856620","1858820"," I said four four three nine or four three zero. "
"1859000","1861980"," It's four four three one."
"1862280","1863920"," It's hand grenades and horseshoes at that point."
"1893140","1894720"," Let me just a second here. "
"1894800","1896040"," We'll start working out some stuff."
"1926310","1945030"," I'm just"
"1945030","1948470"," tracking some other tickers that have some flow on them right now."
"1948530","1950610"," I just want to see how well they're doing. "
"1951090","1952390"," You know, it's interesting yesterday."
"1952630","1953290"," We were talking about."
"1954250","1956250"," We were talking about USO yesterday right. "
"1956350","1959250"," I remember in USO up and I was talking to you guys about."
"1960810","1965090"," Tickers right that are components of the spy or."
"1965570","1967910"," Are are not traded. "
"1970410","1974690"," As much and I said to you, it's probably better to buy the underlying than buying calls."
"1974990","1977470"," And this is a prime example right here, right."
"1977650","1979950"," So we were actually discussing this specifically on. "
"1980830","1981650"," On us."
"1981650","1985550"," So yesterday in Doxy and we were talking about it on an underlying."
"1987430","1988410"," Indexes on the spy. "
"1988770","1994030"," Sometimes they prefer to buy the underlying star shares rather than the."
"1995770","2001930"," The calls are puts mostly because of the shenanigans that take place and mostly because this is the"
"2001930","2002310"," domain."
"2003290","2005890"," Of I think these calls came in here yesterday. "
"2007090","2011250"," And at some point yesterday around here, we got some calls on people are like, hey, you're going to"
"2011250","2011810"," want us."
"2011890","2013870"," So and I was like, if you're going to do that."
"2014550","2017330"," You might think they called out $81 on us. "
"2017350","2018030"," So yesterday."
"2018750","2023830"," But even said, more than likely you'll see some kind of Hanky Panky or something right or some"
"2023830","2026330"," shenanigans inside of after hours."
"2026330","2027870"," And here you see it yesterday, right. "
"2028730","2033990"," You see it into the into the nine o'clock hour yesterday or the eight o'clock hour yesterday."
"2033990","2034530"," Excuse me."
"2036050","2040330"," You can see that it traded up to $81 and then immediately sold off into this morning. "
"2040330","2045230"," And so when you're going to enter these trades, you want to be careful of when you're going to"
"2045230","2045890"," enter them."
"2046410","2051389"," Matter of fact, I don't know if I buy it currently where it's at, but you can kind of see."
"2052270","2052969"," That's kind of funny. "
"2054090","2056350"," It's following exactly what I made yesterday."
"2057090","2058590"," But did you guys remember this yesterday?"
"2061070","2063429"," That rollover that I talked about yesterday in stream."
"2065290","2067409"," So it's not that you can't buy down here. "
"2067489","2072350"," It's that you have to be tactful, more tactful in these kind of tickers."
"2072710","2074730"," So just be conscious of that in these tickers."
"2075670","2080670"," And being tactful and when you enter your positions and when you're actually buying. "
"2081469","2082969"," So and I'm not saying that you can't buy."
"2083190","2084489"," I'm not saying that we're going to keep going up with us."
"2084489","2087630"," So either I'm just saying that let's say you're still bullish on us. "
"2087650","2090469"," So you probably that's probably not a good."
"2091710","2092170"," Representation."
"2092310","2097610"," But let's say you're like, Hey, I'm still super bullish on on oil cap. "
"2097970","2099610"," We talked about this yesterday too, right?"
"2099750","2102150"," You don't believe that we're going to roll this this oil trade over?"
"2102690","2105810"," Well, at least look to be buying below that trend line."
"2106050","2108190"," And currently we are below that trend line, right?"
"2108450","2112230"," If you look at if you look at it for, let's say three months, I think you guys like that"
"2112230","2112510"," trade."
"2112830","2114490"," Look at that nastiness over there. "
"2115130","2116210"," It is like straight nasty."
"2118130","2119030"," Just evil."
"2119630","2120590"," Let's say like a cap. "
"2120610","2121870"," I want to buy this over here."
"2122030","2122150"," Right?"
"2122990","2128930"," Then what you can do is look for how steep it filled off framework kind of there right now."
"2128930","2129190"," Right?"
"2129390","2133090"," We're almost there to have an alert set. "
"2133510","2133890"," Right?"
"2135010","2138690"," Hey, if we break this line cap and we're going to continue on this move higher."
"2139670","2141950"," This would be the time for you to get bullish right right in here."
"2142090","2142270"," I didn't. "
"2142370","2146730"," I thought it was lower, but it looks like it's not doesn't it's not looking like it's lower."
"2147790","2148990"," So keep your eyes on us."
"2149090","2152390"," So at this point, if you start to see any kind of oil trades come in. "
"2152690","2156190"," This would be if you had set an alert here yesterday, right?"
"2156310","2157730"," If you had said a cap, I'm going to set alert."
"2157910","2160210"," I know that you're not bullish on oil right now."
"2162030","2164550"," But let's say you had set an alert right up below. "
"2164890","2167930"," And let's say you got the email today and said said, Hey, ding."
"2168490","2172930"," USO is looking like it's a buy once again to stay on its on its trend, right?"
"2173230","2175470"," It's going to respect its trend or whatever."
"2175470","2177370"," Now it's just now you're just aware. "
"2177690","2180610"," You're just going to say, Hey, I'm going to start looking for oil calls."
"2180750","2182230"," I'm going to look for USO calls."
"2182550","2185310"," I'm going to look for any kind of positive news coming out on oil. "
"2185370","2191370"," And if I find any and it's hit my my buy zone, then now is the time for me to"
"2191370","2192590"," start paying attention to it."
"2192790","2195230"," If you don't see any positive news come out on us."
"2195230","2196930"," So you're going to look for it. "
"2197750","2200350"," To continue to trade down until it finds support."
"2200350","2202230"," So let's say we got alert this morning."
"2202950","2204590"," And you're like, OK, I'm going to learn. "
"2204630","2205530"," I'm going to start tracking it, right?"
"2206270","2207630"," What's the next thing that you do?"
"2207670","2210450"," You have a gap that was unfilled back here, right?"
"2211050","2214770"," And you're going to now set a new alert just right here."
"2214870","2216570"," And you're going to set another alert down here."
"2216750","2221310"," If you have it in, let's say right now you're not you're not hearing any kind of any kind of"
"2221310","2221510"," a."
"2223530","2226490"," We'll raise this up slightly so I get the alert before it happens. "
"2228630","2231010"," So let's say we don't get any support here."
"2231010","2232590"," And let's say we have some negative news."
"2232830","2237870"," We want to look for it to fall down slightly and start to consolidate and make a move higher. "
"2238190","2243230"," So we'll set a second alert and you can start looking for positive oil news."
"2244110","2249290"," Our USO news specifically to see if you want to take that trade higher again for the whatever the"
"2249290","2250350"," next rip is in the market."
"2255960","2259780"," It's watching this nice consolidation one, two, three, four. "
"2260560","2263020"," We'll look to see if any more calls come in on the spy."
"2263020","2267520"," Right now we've got some still got some puts coming in on the market right now, but not heavy."
"2268660","2270560"," It's got nice consolidation down here. "
"2270980","2273200"," And sometimes we'll see some distribution down."
"2273760","2278280"," If we don't find that distribution, maybe we can get one more trade to see if we can break for"
"2278280","2278660"," 50."
"2279260","2279760"," We're up here, right?"
"2279880","2280560"," You might as well do it. "
"2291340","2292200"," Yeah, so we start."
"2292420","2292860"," Hey, James."
"2293420","2294360"," So we started to. "
"2294840","2295780"," Yeah, I saw the wheat."
"2296020","2297200"," I saw the wheat trade as well."
"2297540","2301440"," That's the word thing about those trades is whenever you get into those trades like wheat, when you"
"2301440","2307340"," get into any of the commodities, any of the non liquid stocks, you almost have to just buy the"
"2307340","2308980"," underlying you can't buy calls on them. "
"2309100","2309720"," You might win."
"2310860","2316980"," There's some you could buy like leaps and stuff on like paramount is a good one of trade leaps on"
"2316980","2318180"," even though it's not traded that much."
"2318360","2320880"," But any of the other funky ones, you just kind of have to go underneath. "
"2321520","2327540"," If you weren't tuning in earlier, we reviewed what Spock Emma had to say this morning about is four"
"2327540","2329160"," thousand on the table or not."
"2329160","2333800"," And what needs to happen for the four thousand to be taken off the table."
"2333800","2338580"," You might want to pause the broadcast, go back through and check out what we had to say about it"
"2338580","2339520"," earlier in the broadcast. "
"2340700","2342720"," I think it was to go back to the first."
"2343820","2348160"," Within the first 15 or 20 minutes or so, we reviewed what to be looking for."
"2353780","2359220"," This is Commerce Secretary saying the U.S. and UK are getting close to deal on metals tariffs. "
"2360200","2362520"," That goes what we heard under the UK earlier today."
"2364380","2367780"," I love having our hell of having trade the news back on."
"2368760","2370240"," It makes me feel good. "
"2375040","2378280"," It's like the headline or ticker in the."
"2405330","2406560"," Just a second here."
"2433440","2438140"," Also watching the VIX consolidates slightly down here. "
"2448350","2455330"," Looking to see if we'll get a breach below this this this volatility area here where we're sitting"
"2455330","2455750"," right here."
"2455750","2462390"," So I'm watching this right this this zone right here to see if this is a good dip by."
"2462630","2464950"," Or if we'll get this break down below here. "
"2470160","2471500"," That's my birthday today."
"2472520","2478400"," I'm kind of the I don't really like a celebrate my birthday, but I'm quiet about my birthday."
"2478860","2483800"," I know some people do big things that really like week long celebrations month long celebrations. "
"2485760","2486440"," It's weird."
"2486640","2488360"," My father was really hard on me."
"2489240","2496660"," When I was a kid and when I when I was getting towards puberty, he became more difficult. "
"2497700","2502880"," Not in a bad way, just very, you know, in a good farther way, but at the same time."
"2503760","2506560"," It took all the joy out of birthdays."
"2507020","2509040"," So I do subdued birthdays. "
"2509180","2510900"," I wish I had gotten over that as an adult."
"2512340","2513620"," But I haven't."
"2513740","2516480"," It's kind of a weird thing with birthdays for me at least. "
"2518040","2522280"," I always loved what my dad did for me, but you know, you hit that you hit that those early"
"2522280","2523100"," teenage years."
"2523480","2527860"," And I think your father looks at you and he's like, I don't know if he's going to be a"
"2527860","2528740"," cop or a robber."
"2529340","2531220"," I think that's the I think that's what dads do. "
"2531880","2537520"," And I don't have any sons and I always wondered if I didn't have any sons because maybe maybe I"
"2537520","2538840"," would have been a bad dad to sons."
"2540220","2542780"," I would have had my expectations would have been too high."
"2543260","2544760"," I don't think all dads are like that. "
"2544840","2550120"," But my father was like one of those dads that demanded a lot out of me as a son and"
"2550120","2553100"," had high expectations and didn't accept anything."
"2554480","2559680"," Anything but, you know, I don't know what you call it, but the best out of me."
"2560200","2561920"," That can be a good or a bad thing as I get older. "
"2562800","2563800"," I'm grateful for it."
"2563800","2569000"," But when I was a younger man, you know, I didn't like my father for that reason."
"2569520","2570860"," I didn't think he loved me. "
"2571200","2574640"," But then as I get older, I realized that he had shown me a different kind of love as I"
"2574640","2577180"," became a man that I had to take care of myself."
"2577400","2580220"," That I had to take care of other people that I would be relied upon in life."
"2581100","2583060"," He probably didn't do the best choices with it. "
"2583240","2584920"," But anyways, I don't know why I'm talking to you guys about that."
"2585040","2589880"," But it's something that it's something that stuck with me on my birthdays of all days."
"2591220","2593680"," I don't know if you guys will like that out there or not. "
"2595680","2597220"," You have the same history with your dad."
"2597780","2598420"," You know what I mean?"
"2599940","2604800"," Yeah, I can't give my birth or I can't give my age out there because I'm I had I can't"
"2604800","2605580"," give too many details."
"2605580","2608300"," The more details that I give, it's not that you're a bad person. "
"2608420","2612600"," It's that there are bad people out there that try to jot down every little piece of information"
"2612600","2613220"," about you."
"2613760","2618040"," And then they put out they put a profile together and then they're trying to break into your bank"
"2618040","2618820"," accounts and stuff."
"2619560","2621400"," But I'm not old and I'm not young. "
"2622780","2623660"," If that helps."
"2625100","2627560"," And we're getting a nice little bounce here in the spy."
"2627760","2628640"," We'll see if this can hold. "
"2629120","2631100"," See this perfect bounce down here."
"2631960","2633220"," 448, right?"
"2633420","2635440"," We had that we talked about this number down below here."
"2636180","2638740"," 448 just a few moments ago as we started the broadcast. "
"2639380","2644700"," Talked about looking for this support here at 448 or to the resistance down here that we had traded"
"2644700","2645080"," above."
"2645080","2648300"," It's now looks like it wants to become some form of support."
"2648620","2654300"," We'll see if it holds or if we break through it and it returns turns once again into resistance. "
"2654680","2658520"," So we'll keep an eye on this zone right here that we're in."
"2658640","2662640"," Make sure that this holds if this holds, it is very bullish for the market."
"2662720","2666720"," We break through it, of course, it will remain resistance at this point. "
"2668840","2671680"," Deep thoughts with Captain Jim James, baby, the middle of the afternoon."
"2671680","2673640"," Thanks for saying a happy birthday to me."
"2673640","2674240"," I appreciate it. "
"2674300","2675480"," You have 21 years old."
"2675680","2676960"," Josh is like my son."
"2676980","2678700"," I had Josh when I was 16. "
"2682100","2682960"," You have 69."
"2685780","2687000"," Same with my pops."
"2687260","2688140"," Yeah, it's a tough thing. "
"2688700","2691380"," You know, it's weird too is it's impacted how I raised my daughters."
"2692860","2694500"," I'm not like the asshole."
"2694760","2695720"," My dad was to me. "
"2696680","2699940"," I have a little bit of a 10% asshole, but not in nowhere."
"2700140","2701960"," They're shaped to shape or form the same as my dad."
"2703480","2705020"," I'm kind of grateful to a point. "
"2705460","2709980"," I talked to my wife once and said to her that I'm grateful that I don't have sons because I"
"2709980","2712080"," didn't know how I would be as a dad."
"2712560","2714760"," Because I don't think even my dad thought much about it."
"2714880","2719340"," I don't think that it was it was his priority to care about how I felt. "
"2720740","2722320"," Like your son can have feelings."
"2722920","2725240"," I don't think that dads care about that."
"2725240","2728980"," And even as an adult, he doesn't even want to discuss that. "
"2729140","2734260"," His point to me is I'm grateful that you graduated high school and graduated college and that"
"2734260","2736100"," joined the Army and all that other fun shit."
"2737040","2738340"," And you're still not good enough."
"2738560","2739060"," That's the other thing. "
"2739180","2740540"," You're never good enough for your dad."
"2741700","2743700"," I mean people don't know, I shouldn't say women."
"2743880","2746540"," Like your mom, like my mom always treated me very well. "
"2747220","2749120"," You know, I was like the eye of her apple and all that."
"2750360","2751360"," Rightfully so, right."
"2751560","2752700"," And I needed that love in my life. "
"2752700","2756620"," But dude, fathers, dads can be some hard ass."
"2757040","2758240"," And you know what's weird?"
"2758720","2760980"," They're never hard assholes in front of anybody else."
"2761440","2763680"," It's always like when you're alone with your dad, right. "
"2764120","2765700"," It's never in front of anybody else."
"2766100","2771420"," You always know that your dad, you'll never actually meet your dad's expectations."
"2772440","2774520"," Never, never, ever good enough for your own father. "
"2775620","2777520"," I guess I should be grateful that I had a dad, right."
"2777680","2778900"," I guess some people have never had a dad."
"2781620","2783600"," We talk about a YouTube here, right. "
"2784000","2786240"," If I didn't have a dad, YouTube would definitely be my father."
"2786940","2792080"," I think YouTube is probably the dad that a lot of boys need out there to at least get basic"
"2792080","2793020"," questions answered."
"2793680","2799120"," You know, because my balls are huge and I had to ask my dad, why are my balls so huge?"
"2800760","2804000"," And then of course he pulled his pants down and his balls were fucking bigger than mine. "
"2811300","2814440"," Yeah, it's, yeah, having my daughters."
"2817200","2819420"," Yeah, old school dads are tough and still."
"2819800","2823220"," They're not, they're not the nicest guys in the world. "
"2824140","2827280"," So we're slowly, we're not having quite broken through here."
"2827340","2830340"," I wouldn't consider this yet rejection here at this 448."
"2831060","2833320"," Still a little bit of consolidation, a little bit of selling. "
"2834160","2838760"," Look to see if we get any kind of rejection off of this moment here and start to trade below"
"2838760","2839100"," or not."
"2839180","2844300"," Germany, a coalition party working group are poorly agreeing on a broad basis for package to help"
"2844300","2846480"," relieve burden of high energy costs."
"2847440","2850220"," Some dip buyers still stepping in currently at the moment. "
"2851480","2859260"," I am watching the put flow right now to see if the algos have switched over yet."
"2861040","2863180"," Haven't quite seen it as of yet."
"2863180","2866920"," There's still some call holders on 450 C's for Wednesday. "
"2867520","2872820"," 126,000 calls for Wednesday."
"2873540","2875700"," Let's take a look at Friday's expiry."
"2877720","2881780"," There are 30,000 puts at 440 for Friday. "
"2881980","2882840"," They're a dollar 33."
"2883420","2886380"," So if you wanted to bolster your short position."
"2886380","2893620"," Or this is a German energy package, quarterly, it sees the measures and put in place to strengthen"
"2893620","2895400"," energy independence for Germany. "
"2896220","2901540"," If you wanted to add to a put position, I've got some puts out there that I haven't sold that"
"2901540","2905220"," I bought yesterday and I'm going to keep an adding to them."
"2905380","2911880"," So I'll probably add some 440 P's for Friday for a consolidation phase here."
"2911880","2914180"," So there are some puts being bought currently. "
"2914380","2915200"," Just be aware of that."
"2915400","2917540"," Even if we're getting this bounced currently."
"2930390","2931730"," Scroll this a little bit farther back. "
"2932090","2933130"," I'm not reading everything."
"2933130","2933850"," You guys are salmon."
"2934010","2934530"," I'll scroll back. "
"2937390","2941210"," You know, it's funny."
"2941330","2942450"," I got a funny story about my dad."
"2942870","2944030"," I'll tell you a funny story of my dad. "
"2944470","2950190"," So I like I'd seen my dad like off on and off getting naked like you're getting dressed or some"
"2950190","2950910"," shit like that."
"2950910","2953410"," But I remember that I was watching my dad in the tub."
"2953570","2954810"," He was like taking a bath or something. "
"2955030","2958030"," And I was like, Oh God, his penis is so big."
"2958050","2959350"," And I'm like, he's so gross and nasty."
"2960270","2961790"," And it's like so gross. "
"2962010","2962690"," It's like caveman."
"2962970","2966130"," And I was kind of a revolted because I'm a young boy and all that."
"2966290","2966350"," Right. "
"2966490","2966970"," Got peach fuzz."
"2967490","2968210"," And I remember now."
"2968750","2969630"," I remember looking. "
"2969790","2971070"," We are breaking through currently."
"2972010","2974630"," But I remember now as a grown man."
"2975270","2979570"," I'm like, Jesus, I look as fucking awful as my own dad looked when I was a kid. "
"2983070","2985070"," I probably shouldn't be saying that stuff on YouTube."
"2985530","2987710"," Probably catch a YouTube strike saying that stuff."
"2989570","2991510"," I don't know why dads came up in this conversation. "
"2991890","2992770"," Probably because of my birthday."
"2994270","2995550"," He's the guy that I look up to, right?"
"2995690","2997170"," He's my he's always been my hero."
"2997730","2999190"," I'll be honest with even though he's an asshole. "
"2999850","3001170"," I have a lot of respect for him."
"3001890","3002630"," Take care of me."
"3002750","3003230"," Take care of me. "
"3003330","3006250"," Never ever left me or gave me up or anything like that."
"3007770","3012210"," He put up with my mom and put up with my my siblings."
"3013090","3014870"," And they're still together today. "
"3014990","3017090"," They're still married after all these years."
"3017150","3018510"," He's a very loyal person."
"3020230","3022350"," European courses are wrapping up training for the day. "
"3022350","3023450"," We have a lot of respect for him."
"3023550","3031270"," 0.8% the footsy up 0.3%. And you can't come 0.9%. Very, very loyal man."
"3031630","3033470"," And it's a rare thing, right?"
"3033470","3035870"," Rare to find loyal men out there. "
"3037110","3038690"," So that's always been it."
"3038810","3041250"," You know, that's actually bolstered me as a grown adult too, right?"
"3042850","3045410"," Having that support structure there in one way or another."
"3046570","3048670"," We are breaking through 448 currently. "
"3049050","3050770"," This is looking slightly bad."
"3050770","3052430"," I don't know if I call it bearish."
"3054130","3056030"," I'm going to call this bearish. "
"3056130","3057230"," And this is slightly below."
"3059310","3060350"," Slightly below."
"3063230","3064150"," Vwap here, I think. "
"3064310","3066690"," We'll look to see if this is slight, but this is usually a good place."
"3067350","3069910"," You can see Vwap, which is slightly breaking through it here."
"3071350","3073930"," So some bulls will be looking to buy a dip here. "
"3074370","3077630"," I see some light calls coming in right now."
"3077870","3078150"," Nothing big."
"3078690","3079510"," Nothing too important. "
"3079750","3082890"," Like $30,000 in calls, but nothing serious."
"3083170","3084490"," Looks like most of the money was made."
"3085190","3087410"," So we'll see if this holds or if we get some distribution still. "
"3088070","3091250"," If the afternoon kind of kind of weans itself off."
"3091450","3092610"," It's 12.32 in the afternoon."
"3094190","3097370"," The Vix is still it's been basing since. "
"3097470","3098170"," Let's see."
"3098210","3099770"," The Vix has been basing since."
"3100390","3101010"," Believe it. "
"3101130","3101890"," This is kind of wild, right?"
"3101990","3103610"," If you guys are looking watching the Vix."
"3104130","3108710"," The Vix has been basing since 9.30. This morning."
"3109250","3110790"," It actually hasn't really gone anywhere. "
"3111390","3117670"," The lowest it went was 22.70 at 11.27. It's now trading as high as 2314."
"3118230","3120730"," Looks like it's going to try to make an attempt to go higher."
"3121830","3124030"," That some of some Vix might have been bought. "
"3124250","3126090"," I haven't seen any Vix calls."

"3790840","3794240"," We'll see if they if we get some nice consolidation in here and a rip higher."
"3794240","3797180"," If we can't actually do the nice little tag down below here. "
"3797180","3798960"," So we'll look to see if we can break above here."
"3799360","3800640"," We can get this nice push higher."
"3810240","3813100"," Same price target above to our 450 ultimately. "
"3821900","3824280"," Just so you guys can see this line right here."
"3824280","3827540"," This is real time buyers and this is depth of book here."
"3827800","3829900"," How thick this is when you see more red. "
"3830100","3832000"," It's it's showing more sellers and buyers."
"3832000","3833000"," See more red down here."
"3833120","3834220"," It's more buyers and sellers. "

"3871730","3876350"," New story after news story after news story of."
"3881630","3883710"," Calls for more work from home. "
"3886110","3887710"," Now I think it's bullshit."
"3887710","3891450"," I think it's just the fact that it's sold down to ninety ninety dollars or so."
"3892990","3896030"," But the discussion behind zoom is that. "
"3896670","3905710"," We might get more covid and your workers won't be able to afford to buy gas and go to work."
"3905950","3906450"," That's an insane."
"3906670","3910370"," I saw some of the insane should have been seen in news stories. "
"3910370","3912970"," They want you to go back to what we're doing in the nineteen seventies."
"3913650","3914490"," I don't know."
"3914750","3916890"," They're going to happen rather than focused on EVs. "
"3918010","3922130"," But anyways, even with that being said with some zoom calls came through."
"3922130","3927970"," June seventeenth one oh five C for seven point two million dollars."
"3928690","3931530"," So zoom June seventeenth one oh five. "
"3932090","3935390"," Which is way down here right way down here."
"3935390","3936430"," Just just got them."
"3937330","3938190"," They're expensive. "
"3941470","3945470"," What I would look at is when is there if they don't know if they have dividends."
"3945830","3947190"," But see if they have dividends or not."
"3947410","3948410"," If they don't have dividends. "
"3949110","3951050"," Look for when their next year is."
"3951050","3952830"," And maybe get some call."
"3953930","3954990"," Call spreads. "
"3956990","3961890"," Call it one oh five to one fifteen and date them for June fifteenth."
"3963370","3965990"," Or maybe a week week out or excuse me the next."
"3966470","3969910"," The next big monthly afterwards one fifteen. "
"3970430","3971390"," Maybe for June."
"3973450","3975250"," And we'll look at a larger time frame."
"3975250","3981390"," We're separate all seen press forward suggesting that company planning for default on dollar bonds"
"3981390","3981850"," tomorrow. "
"3983410","3985070"," It's for separate all of Russia."
"3986350","3987450"," Yeah, no shit."
"3987730","3989450"," Of course they're going to default on dollar bonds. "
"3990290","3991690"," I couldn't even open their market."
"3992410","3994650"," You can see some resistance here."
"3995970","3997510"," And see it down here. "
"3999150","4000330"," Make this smaller."
"4003070","4005210"," Let's take a look at a zoom here."
"4006790","4007970"," Tighten up just a little bit. "
"4014360","4016160"," Hasn't even squeezed yet to be honest."
"4019240","4021040"," Looks like you'll get some sellers."
"4021720","4023120"," You got some resistance here. "
"4024020","4026340"," Without a doubt there's trap there's trap buyers here."
"4026560","4027660"," So you have to be aware of that."
"4027960","4029840"," This could take some time to resolve itself. "
"4030560","4036300"," You could end up getting some resistance somewhere like one thirty two one twenty one thirty call"
"4036300","4036840"," one thirty."
"4037200","4038960"," You get some resistance at one thirty."
"4039020","4040780"," But that doesn't mean it doesn't continue to trade higher. "
"4040980","4042300"," It just means that."
"4044040","4045240"," You'll probably get."
"4047620","4048480"," Something like. "
"4051510","4054670"," I think you just have to wear out those sellers so you get something up here."
"4055210","4059330"," Maybe a rejection and you could even set an alert down here for another by."
"4060250","4064530"," And something higher over time as we head into May or June. "
"4065150","4066890"," What they're looking for something in here like this."
"4067630","4068910"," Set an alert down here too."
"4069050","4070510"," If you feel like you missed the trade. "
"4071390","4072590"," Set an alert like one oh five."
"4073450","4076350"," And if there's a down market day and you can grab them again."
"4076810","4077550"," It'd be a nice trade. "
"4077790","4078970"," This might be the better trade of the."
"4079170","4080170"," You know if you missed this here."
"4081770","4085230"," Set an alert in your own software for like a dollar six. "

"4102840","4105020"," See if the spy is going to break higher. "
"4105640","4108140"," A little bit closer here."
"4108939","4113740"," Some support some support one two and we'll see if we can rip higher here."
"4123240","4124420"," Calls coming in on. "

"4335410","4337930"," Right we'll look at GME and look for a price target on GME."
"4341800","4343240"," Damn spy still ripping. "
"4343620","4345200"," Hells yes spy still ripping."
"4346520","4348720"," That's a nice little sweet little trade right there huh."
"4348720","4350340"," It's a gorgeous trade. "
"4350440","4351400"," Look at that trade on spy."
"4352360","4353640"," It's a kick ass trade."
"4354100","4356020"," We called this trade out just a few moments ago. "
"4356820","4358220"," It's still ripping and pumping."
"4359120","4361580"," So we'll look to see if it can make its way higher here."
"4363000","4365080"," Just look to see if it's going to make another leg or two. "
"4369950","4372210"," So there you go another leg on the spy."
"4372670","4373650"," We'll look at GME."
"4373950","4375730"," Same kind of a deal up here on GME. "
"4375790","4379070"," You're looking at some resistance above at 118 and 120."
"4379070","4383490"," I'm not as positive on GME here like I was on AMC."
"4384490","4386370"," But we've been talking about these tickers right. "
"4386670","4387250"," Palantier."

"4395350","4398010"," Now we're also watching calls on Uber. "
"4399250","4401090"," So we'll take a look at Uber as well."
"4401470","4412530"," Uber are GME's blasting off 117.73. Has some resistance above at 118.21. And again at 119.99. Looks"
"4412530","4415730"," like all these stocks that have been beaten down are getting a bid currently."
"4417470","4419230"," Uber has been up since the beginning of the day. "
"4419290","4419790"," It was at 3199."
"4420330","4420990"," Now trading at 33."
"4422270","4424690"," Quick squeeze on a bull flag as well on that one. "
"4425230","4426770"," We'll look at Uber over the course of a year."
"4426990","4428170"," Dude, how do you not buy Uber here?"
"4428750","4430210"," Everybody's like, oh Uber loses money."
"4430350","4431350"," I'm like, I don't give a fuck. "
"4432330","4438770"," All it takes is a company like Cruz to take them over and slap Uber on their stickers, right?"
"4439370","4440310"," It's done deal."
"4441090","4441890"," Look at Uber."
"4442250","4442930"," How does Uber not?"
"4443130","4444150"," Uber is like huge. "
"4444670","4445690"," I mean, talking about a squeeze candidate."
"4446550","4447650"," You want to see a squeeze candidate?"
"4448050","4448750"," There's one right there."
"4449750","4452930"," Price target on Uber for today. "
"4453990","4456470"," 34.82. Impossible."
"4457770","4463510"," Possibly even get as high as 35.36. So we'll look at Uber real quick."
"4464870","4466010"," See what Uber's doing. "
"4473210","4476990"," Uber may not have happened yet, so we have some time on that one."
"4477710","4479350"," AMC, we had some time on."
"4480010","4482930"," We talked about GME, but we didn't look at it. "
"4483630","4485350"," I mean, you want to see a squeeze candidate?"
"4485350","4486790"," There it is right there."
"4487810","4490570"," There's your, there's your hella rad squeeze candidate right there."
"4490730","4493070"," There's no, there's no blue, just blue skies above here. "
"4493770","4501430"," You've got slightly more sellers than buyers, but calls are coming in by the truckload on Uber."
"4501890","4505230"," If you get a squeeze here, I give a price of 35."
"4505630","4506470"," I think it could squeeze higher. "
"4507710","4508730"," It could definitely squeeze higher."
"4509430","4511970"," Because there ain't shit stopping from squeezing higher right here."
"4512950","4513430"," Nothing. "
"4514650","4516470"," All that resistance is at $34."
"4517130","4528450"," There ain't nothing until you get to $35.36. Big sellers above at $38.50. $40."
"4529690","4531710"," If you got to $40, that would be kick ass. "
"4532710","4535910"," I don't know if you'd get there, but Uber, look at Uber real quick for a quick trade."
"4540270","4541050"," Check it out."

"4581510","4586610"," I said this will work on buying leaps or long dated calls on a company like Paramount."
"4587690","4588870"," AKA Viacom."
"4588870","4592490"," I mean, look at this dude. "

"4627810","4629810"," We talk about Paramount's around even talking. "
"4630090","4634450"," I know some of you guys will follow me since the beginning of Paramount, right?"
"4635130","4638390"," If you have never bought Paramount's, there you go."
"4640530","4640970"," Anything."
"4641050","4642070"," You buy anything down here. "
"4642510","4643990"," You just buy them one to three months out."
"4644950","4645990"," Buy them way outside the money."

"5147270","5149390"," So I'm going to take a quick break, not now, but I will."
"5149850","5151410"," We'll wait for this trade to be over."
"5152530","5154050"," We'll take a look once more, right?"
"5154170","5155990"," We talked about this little zone right here. "
"5156550","5158590"," Talked about just this little zone right here."
"5158650","5159550"," We want to get above this."
"5160050","5162270"," So I might see a little bit of a resting area here. "
"5163390","5163790"," Right?"
"5164010","5168350"," And the reason is because the reason I note that is because of this, these sellers right here."
"5168590","5170790"," So right in this area right here, right?"
"5170790","5172570"," You've got, uh, trap buyers."
"5172850","5174350"," They're like, oh yeah, baby, we're going long. "
"5174610","5176210"," And they're like, oh shit, we're going down."
"5176990","5178710"," And they're like, oh, we're going back up."
"5178810","5179110"," I'm going to hold. "
"5179310","5180930"," And they're like, no, don't do that to me again."
"5180930","5183830"," So now that we're up here, they're like, they're like shit."
"5183950","5185330"," I just, I just want to get out of my calls. "
"5185910","5188170"," But they're probably down 30% in their calls."
"5188170","5195370"," So what they have to do is actually rebid by more, uh, to make this next leg higher."
"5195370","5199750"," And if they, if they don't breed by here, uh, it'll, it'll continue to roll over. "
"5199750","5202690"," And they'll get, they'll feel the pain, right?"
"5203790","5206090"," So we'll see if this can hold here."
"5206410","5208450"," We'll see if the trap bulls here and here."
"5208770","5209890"," And believe it or not here. "
"5210110","5211170"," And there's some bulls up here too."
"5211710","5215390"," These bulls are like, please just get up to 450 so I can sell."
"5216170","5217910"," So this area here is a little bit of contention. "
"5219190","5220150"," Let's be conscious of that."
"5220830","5224430"," And we'll see if the, um, the bulls can put it together up here and get us higher."
"5224430","5226270"," To 450. "
"5231430","5233030"," And I'll, I'll work on my audio."
"5233690","5235310"," Uh, let me look at my audio real quick here."
"5235850","5236850"," Hold on brothers and sisters. "
"5238590","5243270"," Let me see my, let me look at my properties and not my properties."
"5243590","5244330"," Not looking for my properties."
"5244750","5247250"," I'm looking for more over here. "
"5247530","5251390"," Looking for, um, my filters and filters over here."
"5251390","5252190"," You're going to check out my filters."
"5253790","5254550"," Oh shit. "
"5254710","5256410"," You know why I'm, you know why my audio is fucked up?"
"5257150","5258890"," You know why my audio is fucked up?"
"5260230","5262750"," Because I don't really fucking filters on this mic."
"5264250","5266350"," When I am plugged that I probably killed my filters."
"5267150","5268750"," No wonder I sound like shit today. "
"5269570","5270950"," Hey, who brought that up to me earlier?"
"5273170","5275290"," Who brought that up on my mic being all fucked up?"
"5275950","5276750"," You are correct."
"5276970","5278130"," My mic is fucked up today."
"5278950","5280170"," Who brought that shit up earlier?"
"5282670","5283670"," Son of a bitch. "
"5283970","5286610"," Louis Reyes is correct."
"5287930","5291550"," So what I did was I, I was doing some, uh, I'll leave it for today."
"5291610","5292690"," I'm not going to fuck with it now. "
"5293410","5294830"," But I will fuck with it."
"5295630","5297170"," I will fuck with it overnight."
"5297750","5301910"," I took my, so what I did was, I was trying to get set up this morning and I had"
"5301910","5303310"," my internet went down for a minute. "
"5303750","5304710"," Then I'm like, well, fuck this."
"5304790","5308810"," I'm going to reset up some of my gear and reposition some stuff."
"5308810","5310850"," And I had to unplug a bunch of shit. "
"5311490","5320570"," So it looks like, it looks like my, um, it looks like my fucking, uh, well, my shit's been reset."
"5321110","5321970"," My shit's fucked up."
"5323950","5325110"," My shit's fucked up. "
"5326890","5328350"," So we'll leave it for today, right?"
"5328950","5330270"," We'll just do it fucking live."
"5331050","5335710"," Uh, you can see this, this, uh, this, they called us a tweezer move here."
"5335750","5337010"," Do you guys know what a tweezer move is?"
"5337010","5339090"," Google search tweezers. "
"5340350","5341710"," Google search tweezers."
"5342690","5346330"," Uh, I don't think anybody talks about that anymore, but that's a tweezer right there."
"5347070","5352870"," Um, so this old school trader, trader move right there, tweezers. "
"5353570","5356430"," And, um, let's look that up right there."
"5357130","5358990"," Do your homework tonight, boys and girls."
"5359370","5359870"," Some of my sons. "
"5371170","5374990"," Also it's really hilarious to have been no news the last six days we've been mooning before that"
"5374990","5375530"," every single day."
"5375630","5377370"," There was a news bomb about war, some horrible thing."
"5377530","5378030"," Now there's nothing. "
"5382130","5389310"," So, yeah, so the, um, you know what else is fucking weird is that you've got, uh, J-Pow, or"
"5389310","5390510"," you've got fed speakers."
"5391530","5392750"," We've got no, it's weird."
"5392930","5393890"," We've got no news scheduled. "
"5394410","5398950"," And so the Fed is out there, scheduling all these news conferences."
"5399990","5402750"," We do have some news on Wednesday and Thursday, but nothing major."
"5403030","5406990"," This whole week is kind of telling the college ministers saying it will be difficult to replace"
"5406990","5410170"," Russian gas dependence for at least two years. "
"5411870","5416150"," Hmm, I don't believe that either."
"5417410","5423850"," I don't, I don't, I don't."
"5424870","5426970"," I don't think, I don't think that I believe that either. "
"5430970","5433770"," I mean, I believe it, that the gas prices will remain high."
"5435530","5440630"," What gas company is going to tell you that they're going to lower the price of gas?"
"5442730","5444670"," I don't think I know a single one out there."
"5445050","5448410"," And I don't know a single gas or oil company that's going to say they want to, they want to"
"5448410","5450010"," invest more in infrastructure either. "
"5452170","5456370"," I mean, can you imagine being called and say someone's saying to you, you have to invest more in"
"5456370","5456710"," infrastructure?"
"5458070","5461770"," You wouldn't want to, but you do, if you have to, right?"
"5462030","5462430"," I guess you do."
"5463250","5467610"," If you have to, but if you don't have to, a little bit less of a good thing."
"5468470","5469450"," This keeps the prices high. "
"5471970","5474570"," Let's see if we can catch this, another bump right here."
"5474650","5476750"," We might catch another bump right here, see if we can catch this one."
"5480430","5487410"," Russian press, Russian energy ministry saying, well, exports from CPC could drop by about a million"
"5487410","5488370"," barrels per day. "
"5490190","5491710"," That's positive gas news."
"5495520","5498860"," And of course, USO is blasting off of that positive gas news."
"5498980","5500280"," We talked about this this morning, right?"
"5501180","5506920"," We said, if there's any positive gas news, expect a rip, and USO is blasting off right now. "
"5506920","5508740"," So we said that right."
"5509520","5510480"," We talked about that this morning."
"5510780","5515360"," Boom, USO climbing on positive gas news. "
"5525520","5526780"," The old gas pump."
"5542480","5544980"," All of this comment out of Russian press."
"5545400","5549840"," CPC is the largest international transportation project. "
"5550760","5552620"," The participation of Russia in Kazakhstan."
"5555020","5558380"," See if we can get this tag, this final tag off."
"5562820","5574300"," It seems like a"
"5574300","5575520"," nice buy right there. "
"5575680","5578980"," If we can get back down here, maybe we can catch another buy for another run up."
"5579800","5583580"," See how that goes."
"5596050","5598610"," Push it, push it higher. "
"5614800","5616200"," Push it, push it, push it higher."
"5619000","5620620"," Give me that last blast off."
"5621540","5623460"," We haven't really touched 450 yet either. "
"5623600","5628040"," We only touched 449.70. So we haven't, we haven't quite hit."
"5629520","5632000"," We haven't quite hit 450 yet."
"5632760","5637260"," So I would like to see that at some point, if it's possible, to get at least that touch on"
"5637260","5637600"," 450. "
"5645470","5645910"," Grabone."
"5649190","5652270"," Thanks for the birthday wishes, Grabone."
"5652930","5655890"," And new traders, thanks for assisting in talking us through this spider web. "
"5656150","5656650"," Yeah, definitely."
"5656910","5657210"," No worries."
"5659290","5661270"," You can see it right in here, right?"
"5661550","5666250"," Seeing all these nice little levels as we plot them and chart them as we work our way up here. "
"5668670","5675070"," Grabone was making comments about helping you to trade the day, find your levels, find out where"
"5675070","5682470"," we're headed, how a day trader looks at the day, and where the price targets are."
"5691290","5692650"," I haven't been looking for a ton of sellers."
"5692650","5696290"," I've been listening all morning because general feeling we had quickly to fortify our console that"
"5696290","5697130"," didn't make the move higher. "
"5697490","5700270"," Yesterday you talked about potential for a big move down as that done."
"5700930","5704630"," Okay, so I don't know if you are just joining me right now."
"5704630","5709590"," If you're currently just joining me right now, then let's revisit it, I guess. "
"5710970","5712790"," We'll revisit it one more time, okay?"
"5713610","5718530"," Because I've been asked a couple times about this and since the broadcast began earlier."
"5719530","5721490"," So, let's start at the beginning, okay?"
"5723410","5732410"," So yesterday, in the market as the market was closing, a spot cam report came out yesterday,"
"5733010","5735290"," becoming out morning and night time for the past three days."
"5735850","5742450"," And the report stated basically that there's no real calls in the market or specifically on"
"5742450","5746750"," indexes, not individual tickers but on the indexes, okay?"
"5747730","5752750"," And so without that call structure, in this call structure, just look at a basic sense of the word. "
"5753290","5755950"," You're not looking for in the money one day or three day calls."
"5756210","5761270"," You're looking for one month out, you're looking for them to be farther out than we currently are"
"5761270","5763210"," to bolster the market to go higher."
"5764030","5769570"," Whenever you have just calls, whenever everybody's buying calls that are one day, three days, and"
"5769570","5772390"," they're in the money, they're price-driven. "
"5772650","5774110"," It means that I'm going to hold them."
"5774470","5776630"," If I get some money off them, I'm going to sell them, okay?"
"5777450","5781330"," It means at any moment the bid can be pulled from the market, that there's a rug pull there."
"5781870","5787030"," And all that's left in the market is a bunch of puts that are deep, deep, deep outside the money. "
"5787590","5790830"," They're down at 400, 390, 370, 360, believe it or not, 360."
"5791550","5795590"," We'll look at some of those charts here in just a few minutes, just to give you an idea of"
"5795590","5795950"," that, okay?"
"5796010","5801330"," It's a university cooperation at $1.76, $3.88, counter-parties."
"5801710","5803210"," So let's start there, okay?"
"5803610","5805050"," And so it doesn't matter where we trade to. "
"5805290","5810970"," What it's showing, and also Spock Emma posted on Twitter, like a Batman thing that said, what if I"
"5810970","5811930"," told nobody about calls?"
"5812410","5812890"," Highest."
"5813530","5815910"," Pull them out since last year."
"5819110","5824070"," So the point is this, is that that was there into yesterday, okay?"
"5826230","5832010"," And with that being there into yesterday, what it means is that the moment that those calls are"
"5832010","5835890"," cashed in for profit, they don't have to go to 100%, they just have to make some money. "
"5836070","5840130"," They go to 100%, they don't have to go to like, they don't have to print per se, right?"
"5840270","5841390"," They don't actually have to print."
"5841990","5845190"," If they're printing 100% on you holding them, that's all you need."
"5845190","5850950"," The moment that bid is removed from the market, the only thing left in the market are puts deep"
"5850950","5854570"," outside of the money, down, right, down, down, deep, deep. "
"5855490","5862190"," And so at any moment, if any bad news drops, the point is that there's no floor that we could"
"5862190","5867070"," careen down, red bar it straight down on any fucking news that gets dropped, at any fucking moment"
"5867070","5873770"," that could drop us, believe it or not, 200 points, literally like 400 points within like one to"
"5873770","5876130"," three days, just straight bar, great, red bar as hell."
"5876230","5880210"," If you don't believe that, I can show you what's happened the last time."
"5880550","5888090"," I can show you the last time we were in this situation, and a similar situation was the almost"
"5888090","5894450"," exact similar situation was right here, right here. "
"5896490","5898470"," No, sorry, right here."
"5899190","5900870"," November 30th, 2018."
"5901850","5903390"," We were in the exact same situation. "
"5904590","5905770"," This is a bear rally."
"5906190","5907450"," Here's another bear rally."
"5909210","5916730"," And as soon as the calls were X are just closed, let's say, sold, we fucking sold to the depths"
"5916730","5918130"," of hell, okay. "
"5919170","5920490"," 222, 28."
"5921710","5926130"," If I was doing this on a trading view, I could show you the percentage drop here, but this is"
"5926130","5927250"," fucking massive, okay."
"5927250","5933970"," And I can promise you that on December 3rd, that everybody was hunky-dory in here. "
"5934850","5936530"," So you have to understand that, okay."
"5936910","5940290"," And we still haven't actually made it back to this level yet."
"5940550","5943230"," This is like 460, okay. "
"5943930","5948670"," So we still haven't even made it to this level to even have this steep self hit, but he is"
"5948670","5954950"," this about this, okay, is that this was even apparent yesterday in our market."
"5957850","5959050"," And, wait a minute."
"5960590","5964770"," I'm looking yesterday, at the close yesterday, I'm like, I'm going to spend some time and just do"
"5964770","5965210"," some research. "
"5967650","5968210"," Excuse me."
"5968910","5977970"," And so what I saw yesterday was what I saw yesterday, what I was looking on the options are call"
"5977970","5982130"," buying and put buying that went on the past from the 18th until the 22nd."
"5982690","5991990"," And what I wound up seeing was a ship ton of calls on individual takers, but no calls on"
"5991990","5996830"," a, here, I'll look at them right now. "
"5997170","5998110"," I'm bringing them up right now."
"6001770","6003250"," This is a good time to look at them."
"6005950","6009090"," So I'm going to try to bring up the website for you guys, so you guys can see this and"
"6009090","6010050"," what I'm trying to talk to you about. "
"6010050","6018360"," So just a second here."
"6021700","6024580"," We should look at this because this is an important thing to talk about."
"6024820","6025140"," Okay. "
"6026460","6027520"," Even more in depth."
"6028300","6029520"," So keep getting asked."
"6031140","6034720"," Do you still think you still think and it's not still think. "
"6035600","6040780"," There's never like a still think it's more of what is the market showing you is the most important"
"6040780","6041920"," thing that you need to know."
"6041920","6048480"," And so at any point leading up into yesterday, we did not have a call call expansion on the"
"6048480","6048960"," indexes."
"6049580","6052600"," But what we did have yesterday was call expansion. "
"6052900","6055680"," From the 18th into yesterday was."
"6056640","6057360"," Let me see."
"6057420","6058620"," I'm looking at me a second here. "
"6060440","6064840"," We did have yesterday was call expansion on individual tickers."
"6065540","6066060"," Right."
"6066240","6068320"," And we talked about that earlier in the week. "
"6068320","6072080"," We said that we said specifically in the morning rolling over a little bit here."
"6072160","6072680"," The S of P."
"6073580","6077640"," Now less than 1% as to X still up one and a half percent."
"6079860","6083640"," And the key point between the key point about yesterday. "
"6084280","6086020"," We're going to look at this right now in just a moment here."
"6086620","6089760"," The key point about yesterday or we're trying to talk about yesterday."
"6090660","6093660"," Was that we did still didn't see index calls. "
"6094440","6098360"," We still didn't see index calls back to VWAP here currently."
"6099040","6100080"," On the spy."
"6101460","6105320"," We did we still didn't see yesterday was we didn't see index calls. "
"6105660","6105840"," Okay."
"6106500","6109620"," We saw we saw we've been talking about this all week to right."
"6109740","6113760"," Hey, we have we have directed calls on specific tickers. "
"6114040","6123640"," They're picking out specific tickers to buy into April, May and June."
"6124420","6127700"," And we didn't see it yesterday either yesterday."
"6128980","6134800"," If you looked closely at that website I posted, you could see that we had an 800 score on"
"6134800","6135820"," individual tickers. "
"6136080","6143220"," And we only had a 74 score on the indexes, which means that we're bearish on the indexes still now"
"6143220","6143680"," today."
"6144800","6147300"," And this is in the spot camera report this morning as well."
"6147300","6149780"," They still emphasize this this morning. "
"6149780","6153080"," So I'll bring the first I'll bring up the spot camera report from this morning."
"6153640","6160860"," Because there still wasn't puts on our calls on the indexes or even puts on the indexes, but there"
"6160860","6161400"," was neither."
"6161840","6169000"," Although it's sitting out there right now is in the money short dated calls and shit tons of puts"
"6169000","6171400"," that are dated down the road. "
"6172560","6177660"," And so at any moment those that at any moment somebody says that we're not going to we're not long"
"6177660","6178320"," anymore right."
"6180960","6185340"," Or not buying anymore the market could could could fall steeply."
"6185820","6192780"," And the what is bolstering the market the past day or so is these calls on individual tickers, even"
"6192780","6194580"," though you're seeing the effect in spy. "
"6195220","6199040"," But you're not seeing the the call buying on the spy going down the road."
"6199420","6203980"," Now this morning we did see that this morning we did see if you were tracking."
"6203980","6206500"," If you were if you were tracking. "
"6208700","6210720"," No wait a minute just I just logged out of."
"6212880","6213700"," Well on here."
"6217420","6219540"," If you're if you were tracking on. "
"6220560","6222620"," You get flow I'll go up here for you."
"6238220","6240980"," Having some problems with float getting flow I'll go back up."
"6241880","6242720"," Well again. "
"6256320","6259820"," I think right here so the key is this is that."
"6265260","6274000"," The key is that you're not the key is that you're not the key is that you're not seeing expansion"
"6274000","6276480"," on the indexes but today on flow."
"6276480","6282940"," I'll go you saw expansion farther out you saw SPX calls that are into April. "
"6283280","6288460"," You saw SPX calls into June and you need to see that bull string of the market."
"6288460","6293700"," You also saw another $20 million in spy puts come into the market but they weren't as deep."
"6294180","6298560"," They weren't down at 390 360 370 they were at 429 is the deepest. "
"6298560","6304760"," So that starts to bolster the idea that we're not going to head down to 429 and print those are"
"6304760","6307080"," probably in a printing just for 40s."
"6307240","6314080"," So but but yesterday on Twitter green government officials saying Ukraine may do is 2022 spring"
"6314080","6319100"," crop so big area to 7 million hectares from 15 million initially expected."
"6320380","6322280"," Before the Russian invasion. "
"6325560","6332000"," So the point behind this that's important is that you've seen more or reasonable puts come into the"
"6332000","6332560"," market now."
"6332900","6338560"," You've seen call expansion on on the indexes at this moment and I'm going to bring this back over"
"6338560","6339620"," here for you to read Carly."
"6340300","6341960"," The point here is right here. "
"6342440","6346440"," When I'm highlighting it right now the point here is that we see gamma flow is offering little"
"6346440","6352260"," influence to markets at current SPX prices as long as the market holds greater than 440 then very"
"6352260","6352260"," low."
"6358920","6364460"," If the market does drift higher into 4500 call wall then positive gamma and resistance should"
"6364460","6369720"," increase therefore van would shift neutral again would start to act as resistance because you want"
"6369720","6374840"," to see more calls being bought above 450 you want to see for 60s and for 70s we saw some"
"6374840","6376880"," of that day in SPX."
"6376880","6383500"," Now should the market sell off we still see little material support below as described the past few"
"6383500","6383860"," reports. "
"6384540","6389160"," We see little support because the put heads destruction over the last week if traders elect to"
"6389160","6393160"," purchase puts which adds the deal or negative delta this could go inside with a spike in IV."
"6393620","6397780"," Both of these factors would add speed to any drawdown speed."
"6398400","6401760"," We know that the price target down below is 440 so if we're looking here. "
"6403560","6412210"," If we look here where it says speed to any drawdown we're talking about a swift move down before"
"6412210","6414650"," you could even get out if you wanted to you couldn't even get out."
"6414870","6416810"," That's the point they're trying to make."
"6417270","6422390"," Up here they're talking about the venom model has a little bit less neutrality shown below is"
"6422390","6424470"," Friday's model left and then right today. "
"6424470","6427210"," A sharp condensed skew is shown in the left."
"6428610","6431730"," And then down here this blue dotted line is what you want to be paying attention to."
"6432930","6438670"," This type of skew that comes with put heavy markets as implied IV declines or increases dealers"
"6438670","6440530"," have a lot of delta hedges to buy sellback. "
"6440870","6445290"," Today's model right shows a similar but less steep skew to March 18th."
"6446190","6451130"," Essentially hedging flows are less impacted by a change in IV."
"6451130","6456370"," Put positions are still larger than that of calls but much less so than last week. "
"6456630","6460130"," Therefore any decline in IV offers some directional dealer hedging."
"6460550","6462470"," The models shift neutral when the skew is removed."
"6463050","6468810"," The example being the blue dotted line right image and then can shift to resistance with heavy with"
"6468810","6469590"," call heavy markets. "
"6470210","6472210"," The example would be 1216."
"6473030","6474490"," So let's look at 1216."
"6475010","6476590"," What happened on 1216?"
"6476810","6477370"," Does anybody remember?"
"6478550","6479390"," That's 1220. "
"6480550","6481550"," Right here."
"6482350","6482610"," Okay."
"6483070","6486170"," So you have this huge push right where we sell down. "
"6486330","6487070"," We have this huge push up."
"6487130","6491890"," We have one try two tries three tries and then we have a violent sell off over here."
"6491890","6494190"," It was a nice violent sell off. "
"6494590","6500110"," So you want to be aware of this and you can see that it took place inside of an after"
"6500110","6500750"," hours environment."
"6501270","6501310"," Right."
"6501450","6502630"," We had a violent sell down. "
"6503630","6506610"," And so that you're trying to see call expansion in the market."
"6506610","6510430"," So I'm going to stick with this right now because we're going to go back to this website and look"
"6510430","6511950"," to see what took place today."
"6512530","6516930"," So we're going to look at this at this index is I S E E sentiment index. "
"6517410","6522030"," And I was noting this yesterday because the point that I was trying to make to you."
"6522430","6523670"," This is important here."
"6523690","6523930"," Okay. "
"6525050","6527550"," Is that when you see these spikes here."
"6528170","6528550"," Right."
"6528850","6532030"," You're looking for Hey, what happened on this spike right here. "
"6532030","6532710"," See that spike."
"6533190","6534990"," That's December 8th, 2021."
"6534990","6537110"," Take a look on your own charts and see what happened. "
"6537930","6541390"," And see how violent the move down is off of a spike like that."
"6541850","6544670"," Look at another example right start on your own go to this website."
"6545090","6546990"," It's on not just Google search I S E."
"6548710","6552670"," Index do Google search I see index right look right here and see what happened. "
"6553210","6556050"," Look right here on January 11th and see what happened."
"6557390","6557450"," Right."
"6558390","6559730"," You want to see the 16th. "
"6559790","6560130"," Let's say."
"6560130","6562630"," Let's look at the 16th of December."
"6564670","6567390"," And you can see right here that's December 16th. "
"6567450","6570930"," We just looked at the 16th right and you can see the spike right up."
"6571230","6573010"," It's a melt up type environment."
"6573650","6578190"," And the moment when those calls buying is stopped right. "
"6579090","6580130"," You'll see today."
"6580790","6583430"," If this major call buying is stopped right."
"6584230","6587790"," We start to trail off and what is the impact on markets. "
"6587790","6591830"," So on Twitter yesterday I made a comment I said someone said well how do you feel about this."
"6591950","6594530"," And I said well I feel that we'll get the melt up."
"6595210","6597370"," But I'm scared for what happens afterwards. "
"6598350","6598570"," Right."
"6598790","6603630"," What happens afterwards when when all this all this gamma leaves the market right."
"6603910","6605390"," Unless we keep adding gamma to the market. "
"6606770","6609330"," So I'm so yesterday and today."
"6609830","6611810"," Let's look at something specific here."
"6611930","6612030"," Okay. "
"6612910","6614890"," If you were to check this out yesterday."
"6614890","6615670"," Right."
"6616070","6618330"," We were at like 800 over here. "
"6618850","6620190"," 800 on all securities."
"6621070","6621890"," Just right here."
"6622690","6624390"," Today we're just above 100. "
"6625770","6626410"," Okay."
"6626910","6627530"," Generally speaking."
"6628150","6630710"," Now the all equities only. "
"6631670","6634670"," We're at a hundred fifty eight one fifty six is positive is bullish."
"6635370","6636850"," But we were still not seeing."
"6637930","6640730"," Is all indexes in ETFs only. "
"6641170","6643670"," And you're not seeing the one hundred over here."
"6643670","6645670"," You're seeing less than one hundred."
"6645750","6649970"," And this infers a bearish sentiment on the indexes as a whole. "
"6650850","6655610"," And so the other concern here and it's weird because I get asked these questions like well these"
"6655610","6656510"," weren't calls that were made."
"6656770","6661050"," There was huge call buying the past three to four days in the market."
"6661790","6665870"," Huge call buying huge call buying believe it or not. "
"6666430","6667910"," Let's look over the past year."
"6668330","6669670"," Let's look over the past five years."
"6670470","6671670"," And it's just monstrous. "
"6671670","6673750"," And incidentally."
"6674350","6676270"," The last time it was this huge."
"6676610","6676750"," Right. "
"6676950","6677690"," What do we got here?"
"6677910","6678230"," We've got."
"6678850","6681170"," We've got August seventh two thousand eighteen."
"6682150","6683450"," It's another one to look at. "
"6683930","6684410"," Right."
"6684530","6685330"," We got another one over here."
"6685610","6686510"," November twenty first. "
"6686990","6687950"," Does anybody know what happened?"
"6688730","6690150"," November twenty first two thousand eighteen."
"6690810","6692030"," It was a fucking hellscape."
"6692450","6693890"," It was a fucking hellscape. "
"6694630","6696590"," This is November twenty first two thousand eighteen."
"6697350","6698110"," And what happened."
"6698910","6702250"," So you're like well Captain you know you shouldn't be listening to spot cameras wrong you shouldn't"
"6702250","6703130"," be listening to them. "
"6703590","6707010"," But the truth is that no matter where we are right now at four fifty."
"6707330","6712010"," So we're at four fifty and what you want to be doing is saying okay I'm looking for call expansion."
"6712490","6715070"," And I'm looking for puts not to be so far outside the money. "
"6715410","6718650"," And why haven't they closed those puts so far out the money now."
"6719030","6719310"," Right."
"6719590","6720330"," And we're going to look at November. "
"6720890","6722370"," We're going to look at in two thousand eighteen."
"6722570","6724270"," We're going to look at what is that date there."
"6725650","6727410"," November twenty ninth two thousand eighteen. "
"6727410","6729470"," So we'll look at November twenty ninth two thousand eighteen."
"6730090","6731490"," And see what happened."
"6731730","6732670"," We'll go back over there. "
"6733510","6733770"," Right."
"6733970","6735610"," And you say oh the cap that can't happen again right."
"6736570","6739010"," And you know our cap this is a."
"6740810","6742170"," You can see it right here. "
"6743470","6744190"," Hold on here."
"6744270","6744910"," I'm on the wrong chart."
"6745190","6745550"," Wrong place. "
"6746290","6747090"," Wrong place."
"6747330","6747690"," Looking for that."
"6748010","6749510"," That giant fucking move down. "
"6753190","6754450"," Wrong place right here."
"6758720","6761660"," And let's see that last leg okay November 18."
"6763500","6763940"," Right. "
"6766080","6766960"," In here."
"6767340","6768700"," So basically right in here."
"6768820","6770100"," Right in this zone right here. "
"6770680","6773220"," You've got this this aggressive call buying."
"6773460","6775320"," And you probably had some more calling buying just past it."
"6775520","6777040"," Look at that huge truck road and see it. "
"6777100","6779800"," But you see in this massive spike in call buying."
"6780680","6782140"," And so you're looking for read."
"6782380","6784020"," You're looking if you're looking for an answer. "
"6784020","6784720"," You're trying to say."
"6785100","6787040"," Hey are we a we in a bull market."
"6787040","6789760"," Or is this just a bull. "
"6790340","6793300"," A bull spike right up a bull rally."
"6793300","6795020"," Is this a bull rally or a bear rally."
"6795200","6796180"," That's your question right. "
"6796500","6798040"," It's a bull rally or a bear rally."
"6798340","6799840"," And the question becomes."
"6800420","6801080"," I don't know. "
"6801700","6805020"," And so what Spock is trying to tell you is that."
"6806320","6808920"," But Spock is trying to tell you is that."
"6810020","6811440"," We'll put the red line here. "
"6811560","6812860"," We're going to also do another one."
"6815080","6816300"," We'll look at another one."
"6816900","6819880"," Over here and what the key here is that. "
"6822520","6826340"," The key here is that we've traded with one to right."
"6826640","6828020"," Come back up here."
"6828800","6831660"," And the reality is that this is the level. "
"6832220","6835520"," This for sixty up here is similar in level."
"6836200","6838400"," To do we roll the market over."
"6838680","6840840"," And that's the question if we roll this market over. "
"6841780","6844240"," And they're telling you out there they're saying to you look."
"6844980","6846040"," At any moment."
"6847180","6848500"," This could come up here. "
"6848800","6850040"," It could come up right here."
"6851420","6852260"," It doesn't matter."
"6852440","6853160"," It could come right here. "
"6853220","6853760"," It doesn't matter."
"6853960","6854840"," We're not seeing."
"6857200","6859560"," The bolstering of the markets. "
"6859920","6863360"," And can you survive this move down is the next question."
"6863980","6866680"," Are you like full balls tilts leaps down here."
"6867280","6870020"," And then another question about being down here. "
"6870420","6871980"," I haven't talked about this much."
"6872140","6874260"," But the reason I'm going to bring this up to you right now is this."
"6874540","6874660"," Okay. "
"6875580","6879700"," You'll hear sometimes bull say well I just dollar cost average."
"6880620","6881880"," And that works."
"6882180","6884620"," The key though for you if you're a bull is this. "
"6885320","6886940"," If you bought this here."
"6887960","6888220"," Right."
"6888400","6891320"," You don't have any cash to rebuy if we make a move lower. "
"6892060","6894360"," You'll never make this money back supposedly supposedly."
"6894360","6895400"," If you look back in like 2018."
"6896300","6896740"," 2015. "
"6897040","6899420"," There's a decade in there where if you bought wrong."
"6900040","6901980"," You wouldn't actually make any money."
"6902680","6905940"," We'll go back and look at those charts and we'll go back in time and look at those. "
"6906380","6909820"," But there are some actual moments that if you bought the wrong the wrong dip."
"6910540","6911400"," You would be flat."
"6911600","6913420"," You wouldn't beat inflation over the decade. "
"6914040","6916180"," So where does that leave you as a bull."
"6916920","6918980"," And especially with the regime that we're in."
"6919280","6924440"," It leaves you saying to yourself I need to find out if this is the last bottom. "
"6925320","6925540"," Right."
"6925800","6926080"," Or."
"6926660","6927820"," If I'm just trading. "
"6928840","6932560"," To a price point and then waiting for the next one over here to buy."
"6932960","6934280"," To take that one up right."
"6934720","6937480"," And you're going to do this now for the next one to three years. "
"6937580","6941780"," Like you're going to have to actually buy dips and sell them to beat inflation."
"6942620","6945000"," To actually make profit in this market."
"6946160","6948360"," So just be aware of that as we trade forward. "
"6948360","6952020"," And be aware that Spock M is not telling you can't look at Spock M and say."
"6952300","6953880"," Hey they don't know what the fuck they're talking about."
"6954040","6954500"," They can get fucked. "
"6954840","6956180"," They're looking at the actual numbers."
"6956820","6960660"," And the ISEE is telling you the exact same thing."
"6961120","6965440"," This is this is agreeing with that statement to an extent right. "
"6965940","6968320"," What this coming up is going to come back down."
"6968680","6971760"," And it is not saying hey we're going to crash the market."
"6972200","6973640"," But it is saying can you handle that. "
"6973640","6978360"," It also says do you take profit up here and wait for the next dip to buy to go higher."
"6978680","6980460"," This market's changed I think."
"6980820","6982780"," Or right now it's changed from. "
"6983600","6987280"," Right now it's changed from you can buy a dip and hold for five years."
"6987440","6991500"," I think this market is one where you have to actively manage your portfolios if you're a bull."
"6991500","6995340"," Like you have to buy a bottom and decide what you think the top is. "
"6995960","6999040"," You know the it starts to get from 440 to 460 right."
"6999200","7002200"," You know the risk is less risk at 440 more risk at 450."
"7002640","7004100"," And extreme risk at 460. "
"7005220","7007480"," You also have to look and see say to yourself."
"7008020","7011840"," Is there any not that has to be great news but is there any good news out there for the"
"7011840","7012520"," market to grow."
"7013080","7014560"," And then you think think to yourself. "
"7014840","7018580"," Hey how long can companies have good ERs."
"7018660","7020340"," Probably another one to three quarters."
"7020760","7025820"," And you can throw one bad quarter in there because they want to get some garbage news out there"
"7025820","7026060"," right. "
"7026680","7029320"," So you start to think about one three years down the road."
"7029320","7032600"," For where the top is in this market."
"7034620","7036900"," Jesus I was just looking to see if I was still in calls. "
"7037560","7039140"," I wasn't sure if I was or not."
"7039340","7042060"," Just be conscious about that and how that impacts where we are right here."
"7042380","7045780"," Now for today what has changed today versus yesterday. "
"7046020","7048640"," Is we did see call expansion on this market."
"7049140","7050840"," We saw call expansion to 460."
"7051580","7053480"," And we did see some put spot. "
"7053700","7056060"," We saw 20 million dollars in put spot today."
"7056580","7058100"," But they weren't as deep."
"7058440","7061480"," They weren't at they weren't down at four hundred three ninety three sixty. "
"7061920","7064420"," They were down the deepest I saw was four twenty nine."
"7064540","7065660"," So if I see four twenty nine."
"7066160","7068700"," I think that they're not going to want to print those. "
"7069280","7073540"," I don't think but the math in the system says they're not going to want to print those four twenty"
"7073540","7073980"," nine's."
"7074240","7075320"," Unless more people buy them."
"7075420","7081200"," So my short term view has changed based upon today's call and put buying to. "
"7081200","7085440"," It looks like there's a new bottom right around four forty."
"7086120","7089280"," If we see more expansion in the coming days."
"7089340","7093720"," Let's say we go get down to four forty and I see a bunch of four thirties come out and"
"7093720","7095040"," a bunch of four twenties come out. "
"7095340","7098480"," We'll then update and say hey we're going to be looking at lower numbers."
"7098740","7103280"," We'll be looking at now for four twenty right or four thirty or four ten as we move our way"
"7103280","7103600"," down."
"7104420","7107980"," So these things are fluid day in day out. "
"7108700","7111760"," So just be so so be conscious of where we are on that."
"7112040","7114680"," And that that IE that's from the NASDAQ."
"7114880","7121660"," That she's tested positive for COVID have tested President Biden and he tested negative. "
"7123740","7125100"," White House has COVID."
"7128560","7132580"," So that becomes a question of do you still think that the market can can drop."
"7132860","7136040"," I think that the answer is not any more. "
"7136040","7141660"," I think today with the purchase of twenty million dollars in puts on the spy."
"7142140","7145140"," If you guys go over real quick to the to the discord."
"7146040","7150640"," I'll bring up the puts that were bought today and you can look on spot the spy puts that were"
"7150640","7151120"," bought today. "
"7151540","7155600"," There's twenty nineteen point three million dollars in put spot on the market."
"7156040","7157960"," I know I'm rehashing this for some of you out there but."
"7160000","7163800"," They're not they were up to now we're up to twenty million dollars in put spot today. "
"7165400","7168100"," Extensive laundry list of puts you can see them here."
"7168620","7171780"," But these puts weren't bought down at four hundred."
"7172160","7177360"," They were bought the deepest that I can see in here of any kind of size was down here. "
"7177700","7180560"," We'll raise make this a little bit larger here."
"7183320","7184600"," So you guys can read this."
"7186420","7189740"," But if you look down below here right here. "
"7190960","7195000"," You can see puts that were bought for March twenty fifth."
"7195820","7201400"," March twenty five four twenty nine P."
"7202260","7208460"," For eight point nine million dollars and four forty five P for four hundred thirty seven thousand"
"7208460","7208900"," dollars."
"7208920","7210680"," And so what's the implication on this. "
"7211220","7216440"," The implication is that we're not going to trade that they're going to print for four thirties"
"7216440","7218060"," unless more people buy four thirties."
"7218900","7222100"," Here's the ones above them to we've got five twenty here as well."
"7222620","7225560"," So another eight or another eleven or ten twelve million dollars. "
"7227120","7232100"," The key though is that they'll probably get those four forty five's to print right here."
"7232360","7232520"," Okay."
"7233040","7235720"," They'll probably get some four forty eight's to print over here. "
"7236100","7240000"," And by then buying puts at four twenty nine it probably puts the bottom of the market now."
"7240380","7243560"," Right around four forty unless more more put buyers step in."
"7243560","7248700"," If more put buyers don't step in I'm going to call bottom of the market as of today for forty. "
"7249900","7251720"," So in discord you're able to see this information."
"7252220","7253520"," I just have put it on discord."
"7255180","7261020"," And if you track the options flow day in day out you can see where the expectations would be. "
"7265420","7266780"," Someone just texted thank you."
"7266900","7267440"," I don't know what that means."
"7267800","7268940"," I don't think that's for us. "
"7268940","7271080"," But anyway so that's what I got for you on."
"7271640","7273220"," That's what I got for you on."
"7276510","7277290"," I mean here. "
"7278590","7282870"," On where we are in the markets in terms of can we trade lower to four hundred."
"7283470","7286490"," Not from what I see in put buying today."
"7286490","7289130"," We can't without that put buying. "
"7289530","7292450"," If we didn't have that put buying the twenty million dollars and put spot today."
"7293110","7294150"," Yes it's still on the table."
"7294150","7300730"," If we didn't have banks buying SPX with an expanded call range. "
"7302530","7304670"," No we wouldn't have gotten a four fifty today."
"7305050","7310510"," Now we're now what you're waiting for is you're waiting for call expansion again right."
"7310730","7312910"," But at least you're not you're not scared about where we headed. "
"7312910","7316750"," We're not you're not scared that we're heading lower than four forty unless we see an aggressive"
"7316750","7317870"," buying regime."
"7318650","7320370"," I wouldn't I wouldn't be scared about going down here."
"7320370","7321990"," And I'd be scared about hitting four forty. "
"7322330","7325950"," But definitely not scared of going below four forty unless you see some kind of expansion."
"7326570","7327510"," So what does that mean?"
"7328010","7333170"," That means that what you will see in the market over the next few days unless there's continued"
"7333170","7336410"," equity buying or continued."
"7338070","7341670"," Our call buying in the market what you end up seeing is you'll end up seeing. "
"7342270","7347930"," You could see a push up here right and then you'll see some consolidation waiting for more call"
"7347930","7348170"," buying."
"7348170","7352810"," If we don't see call buying we consolidate down and we'll drift towards four forty."
"7353190","7358010"," Until we find some support and if we find more call buyers down here and they're like okay I'll buy"
"7358010","7359010"," some four fifty's again. "
"7359450","7363970"," We might get up to four forty five if they say okay I'll buy some four sixty's we'll go to"
"7363970","7364530"," four fifty."
"7365550","7365990"," Okay."
"7367930","7369050"," So that helps. "
"7370950","7372970"," So what do you do as a bull right now."
"7372970","7377910"," I wouldn't be afraid of us going to four hundred at this moment at all."
"7378150","7378670"," I wouldn't be afraid. "
"7379250","7383730"," I would think about taking some profit off the table at some point around this four fifty."
"7384090","7389410"," Take your money and then you're going to be looking for your next leg up with continued equity"
"7389410","7396050"," buying and continued call buying to force you want to see calls at a minimum of four sixty and then"
"7396050","7399410"," even higher four sixty five four seventy for us to go higher."
"7399410","7405330"," Now we can still go higher just buying in the money calls but just be aware that that the bottom"
"7405330","7408250"," can fall out at any moments down to four forty. "
"7409070","7414610"," So that just the bottom has raised itself up slightly from over where we are."
"7417110","7418070"," Hope that helps."
"7418510","7419910"," I don't know if it does or doesn't. "
"7422590","7428470"," But go through that NASDAQ site go to that NASDAQ site right go through and look for spikes in call"
"7428470","7431190"," buying look for the rise that takes place in them."
"7431390","7432650"," And it's pretty consistent."
"7433230","7437750"," It's not like it doesn't tell the truth half the time and tells the truth the other half of the"
"7437750","7438010"," time. "
"7438410","7444750"," It tells the truth those spikes right tell the truth every single time if you go back in history"
"7444750","7446950"," you can go back last six months you can go back last year."
"7446950","7452210"," You can go back last five years and you can just look and see where the rises are and where"
"7452210","7452910"," the falls are."
"7453290","7458670"," And you can see where the spike was yesterday and you can see that we're rolling over on the call"
"7458670","7459210"," buying today. "
"7459890","7465130"," So you would expect at some point unless the call buying picks back up for the market to roll over"
"7465130","7469890"," slightly at some point soon right could be today could be tomorrow."
"7469890","7471510"," I'm still holding puts."
"7472490","7477430"," I'm still trading calls but at the same time I'm holding puts because there should be a roll over"
"7477430","7478190"," here at some point. "
"7479410","7485110"," Well I don't care if I'm paying for my puts right now but my trading calls as well so it's"
"7485110","7487650"," kind of a mixed bag right."
"7489170","7495150"," I add the puts and then I trade the calls to offset the cost of those puts that I'm holding."
"7497150","7501810"," We're seeing a report of an earthquake and Taipei but no magnitude reported in. "
"7502570","7504810"," So we'll look at the one day chart once more."
"7506170","7508250"," We're coming into 146 in the afternoon."
"7508490","7512130"," I'm going to take a quick break here for 15 minutes and we're going to take a quick look at"
"7512130","7512650"," the market. "
"7514570","7516950"," And hold on here."
"7519890","7521990"," I need what I need to do is not do this during."
"7522470","7526050"," I need to like make do a live stream outside of. "
"7527970","7531790"," Hours so that like so we can just sit around you guys can ask me some serious questions."
"7532710","7537990"," And I can answer them more in depth than you know this is kind of like a rag tech throwing"
"7537990","7538950"," throwing a."
"7538950","7545350"," An answer together to came over here right a nice bounce rejection here consolidation down below"
"7545350","7552570"," one to push higher broke through right the support right here and we're back on this little zone of"
"7552570","7553750"," consolidation here."
"7555210","7561230"," So we want to see if we're going to start rejecting here and maybe make a leg down to this"
"7561230","7562110"," area here finally. "
"7563770","7566830"," And maybe we'll look for something like this we'll look for."
"7570030","7573990"," We call it one two I guess this could be three."
"7575230","7579370"," So if you had a tag down below and then move higher I guess that's a that's a thought process. "
"7579830","7581850"," If this fails right here."
"7582470","7588230"," If that fails and we trade back down you could look for one here or even down here."
"7589050","7591590"," For another leg higher there are going to be some. "
"7592010","7597810"," There's one bearish take on today and that would be that."
"7598990","7604950"," That would be if if if bears were to our polls were to take profit."
"7606410","7611090"," And so let's say let's say the other I guess the bear trade on this would be. "
"7611090","7614890"," Well the bull is going to be at some point start to take."
"7617250","7620150"," You see two of these and then a trade lower."
"7621170","7622230"," Into the bell. "
"7623190","7627170"," So what are you looking for here right you're going to look for maybe if you were a bull."
"7627970","7632070"," You're going to look for a pick up down here and look for the bounce down here."
"7632430","7636150"," Maybe wait for this move here so if you're a bull. "
"7636830","7640650"," Wait to get back into somewhere in here okay if you're a bear."
"7641110","7646770"," You can probably take this down and then cut them loose and then look to buy the second rejection"
"7646770","7649430"," right one to rejection go down."
"7649990","7654370"," As we'll pay attention to this if you're super bullish here into the close. "
"7655170","7664050"," Let's take a look at."
"7664730","7666450"," If there's support here."
"7667270","7671870"," It's the reports of buildings shaking but no reports of damage in. "
"7672930","7678830"," Looks like we've got some you know calls are starting to wear off here currently."
"7680410","7682870"," VWAP is down below at 448 44."
"7684270","7686130"," Day traders like to play VWAP. "
"7690470","7693990"," Whatever you're using for VWAP whatever your settings are for VWAP."
"7698520","7701060"," Now you've got more sellers currently above."
"7702460","7705660"," So we will look to see turn this turn this a little bit. "
"7709610","7713490"," The price started above still 450 higher from where we are currently."
"7717970","7719490"," So we'll see if we can make another leg up."
"7721070","7722750"," We've got more calls coming in on par. "
"7727390","7732630"," Bring this back over here and if you're a bully one two three I don't like the fourth try."
"7732810","7734530"," I always like to three tries one two three."
"7734870","7736550"," I don't like the fourth try ever. "
"7736750","7741610"," I always like like the one two ago or one two and if this three is lower."
"7742290","7744950"," I like that for go but I don't ever like the fourth though."
"7745090","7747510"," I don't like the fourth try one two three and four. "
"7747630","7750830"," This could go up here but I don't I don't ever like trading the fourth try."
"7752270","7753570"," So if I miss it I miss it."
"7754930","7758830"," If you're if you're locked in calls right now I would take the money and run up here. "
"7759010","7763390"," Of course if you have the chance I'm going to be waiting for a dip by down here."
"7763950","7767690"," Down here or down here to make one more run up to 450."
"7769790","7771390"," Because I do I do think we're going up. "
"7771590","7773330"," I'm bullish here if you want to know."
"7774710","7777610"," What my what my stance is I'm bullish into the bell."
"7778450","7781130"," I'm not I'm not I don't think they're going to take their money and I think they're going to try"
"7781130","7782430"," to get the four fifties to print. "
"7783570","7784950"," Today before the end of the day."
"7786250","7789610"," So I think we have a price target above at four forty nine ninety nine."
"7790330","7792170"," And I think that we get there today. "
"7803610","7808110"," All right so I'll be right back I need any fifteen or ten minutes I'm going to go get it's"
"7808110","7809550"," my birthday okay so."
"7812170","7816010"," So give me like give me just ten minutes I'm going to go pour cocktail."

"7833310","7837790"," If you're in Europe put your hard hats on or your your bomb shelter helmets on."
"7838730","7843710"," If you're in South America get naked and party because we all know you guys like to party out"
"7843710","7843870"," there."
"7844910","7848050"," If you're in Miami I was told you guys have to shut down spring break. "
"7849870","7853770"," You guys are getting too wild and spring break supposedly just give it like that ten minutes."

"7859910","7863050"," Today's my birthday today so we're going to take it a little bit easy. "
"7864070","7866750"," I'll be looking to take some more calls with here in here by two o'clock."
"7866750","7868270"," I'll take another trade with you guys."
"7868990","7870430"," So I'll be looking for me. "
"7871070","7872470"," I already sold my calls in here."
"7872610","7877910"," So I'm going to look for another dip down here if I miss this I miss it but I hope"
"7877910","7878510"," I don't miss it."
"7878510","7883330"," I hope that I can grab where I'm looking for to buy calls down here. "
"7883390","7889010"," I'm going to show you I'm looking to buy them one two and three."
"7889650","7890870"," So this is my targets."
"7892450","7897410"," Now if you're already in calls I would say stay in calls for that move. "
"7897590","7901390"," If you get this move right here I'm going to change that that red color is nasty."
"7902910","7903930"," We'll turn it to green."
"7905810","7908090"," So if if let's clear this. "
"7908410","7911870"," So if you're already still in calls I would say stay in them."
"7913110","7918510"," Or if this flips and reverses you could stay in and then just add again down here to make your"
"7918510","7918890"," money back."
"7920510","7921610"," I'll be right back ten minutes. "

"8998900","9005060"," What we're going to try to do is take a look at some of the resistance where it is currently. "
"9005060","9008580"," So you've got Tesla coming up here to 970."
"9009180","9013040"," You can see the resistance here between 979.75 and 980."
"9015380","9017760"," We have more buyers and sellers right now. "
"9018240","9023760"," The good thing about what we're doing right now, this break above is that whoever bought those"
"9023760","9029420"," calls is forcing the banks to hedge right here."
"9029420","9032700"," So this is where you're getting your break above on Tesla."
"9033220","9034360"," The timing is key. "
"9058190","9061190"," Should find some resistance at 977."
"9062750","9064490"," So we'll look higher right now."
"9064490","9067270"," As daily seeing inflation is too high right in here. "

"9201220","9203560"," What did we just talk about 20 minutes?"
"9203760","9205140"," You're still tuning in right now. "
"9206140","9206740"," Right."
"9207420","9209180"," I've been on two diatribes today."
"9210420","9211980"," Two diatribes today. "
"9214520","9222600"," And the second diatribe in the first, I highlighted that for us to get, though the first racks of"
"9222600","9226140"," four sick of SPX calls that came in were 460."
"9228220","9235420"," And that you need to see SPX calls higher than 460."
"9235780","9238600"," You need to see that 470 for us to get to 460. "
"9238600","9246280"," And that we're going to look for them in the coming days for us to trade higher."
"9246600","9248840"," And what do we see that just came in?"
"9252240","9257420"," We saw SPX May 20, four, seven, seven, five C."
"9258700","9260300"," Four point, $5 million."
"9261300","9270460"," And that leads us to a"
"9270460","9280140"," call expansion or trading expansion leads us to not having a defined area of 450 down to 400"
"9280140","9282060"," or 440 down to 400. "
"9282660","9287320"," It's now expanding our ability to trade higher from here."
"9288280","9296280"," So when you see calls like this come in, it's showing you that it's showing you that we now have"
"9296280","9300900"," the ability to trade higher from 450 to 465."
"9302200","9304680"," Well, actually four, let's call it 467. "
"9306960","9307640"," 4675."
"9310680","9312060"," Due to that expansion."
"9322480","9325040"," That's daily saying now we have policy supported. "
"9325260","9329800"," And if you haven't seen those calls, they're on the discord channel."
"9331520","9333500"," They just came in at 212 PM."
"9337000","9338480"," It doesn't mean we trade there today. "
"9339760","9343560"," But it does show that we've got a bit in the market that is much higher."
"9345420","9347720"," Watching more Tesla calls come in right now."
"9348040","9351880"," March 25, 980 C, $519,000. "
"9352580","9358680"," March 25, 1020 calls, $245,000 for 1020."

"9476860","9479280"," I told you that if you stayed in your calls to be printing, right?"
"9479360","9480280"," Looks like you are."
"9480280","9484260"," Looks like getting close to printing or at least gaining back what you had lost."
"9484520","9492740"," If you had stayed in your calls, told you that I wanted to get that dip. "
"9492900","9495160"," And if I didn't get that dip, I'm going to lose."
"9496780","9499220"," See spy is fighting to hit that 450."

"9564860","9567800"," We know the importance of Tesla going up."
"9571710","9573890"," A little bit of pullback here on Tesla."

"9645520","9650020"," Daily acknowledging that she does have a concern that when inflation stays higher for longer."
"9650020","9652840"," That tugs at the inflation anchor."
"9658450","9659450"," It's weird too. "
"9659570","9661770"," This morning I listened to a lesson."
"9662070","9665250"," I was listening to a morning show this morning."
"9667650","9677620"," And all I did was shit talk and video and video. "
"9677940","9679840"," Just let's have a quick look at that video."
"9679840","9680280"," Okay."
"9682660","9685240"," NVIDIA looks like it's going to squeeze here, doesn't it?"
"9685380","9686480"," You see this move higher?"
"9687520","9690600"," So keep track of NVIDIA for power hour here. "
"9691500","9693380"," As we move into power hour, boom."
"9693700","9694240"," Try to sell it."
"9694320","9694360"," No. "
"9694620","9695200"," Try to sell it."
"9695300","9695380"," No."
"9697140","9697520"," Three times. "
"9697820","9699280"," One, two, and three."
"9700520","9701740"," NVIDIA tried to dump."
"9703060","9704080"," Keep your eyes on NVIDIA. "
"9706780","9707840"," Into the bell today."
"9709600","9712160"," Now I know you usually give this move back over here."
"9712820","9714280"," This is the leg up that we had. "
"9714780","9716280"," They were just shit talkin' in video."
"9716460","9718080"," This doesn't look weak to me."
"9719020","9720340"," This looks like..."
"9720840","9722640"," Daily goes on to say it is time to look at it. "
"9722640","9723980"," Yeah, they tried to sell it down here."
"9724100","9724860"," Didn't work, right?"
"9725160","9726420"," Looking if we need to go..."
"9726420","9727400"," Try to sell it down again."
"9728000","9728360"," Didn't work. "
"9729200","9730420"," Try to sell it down again."
"9730800","9731580"," Didn't work, right?"
"9732080","9733140"," One, two, three."
"9733140","9734140"," You got shorts. "
"9734400","9735920"," Sitting right here saying hello."
"9736480","9744180"," If we squeeze up here to this 275, shorts will have to buy and we'll go hop cranking into the"
"9744180","9744500"," clothes."
"9745660","9748200"," So keep your eye on NVIDIA as well, okay?"
"9748340","9750080"," It hasn't made its move. "
"9750960","9752480"," It's extension yet."
"9753220","9755680"," Because you know this guy this morning was like..."
"9755680","9756900"," This guy's getting paid for lots of money."
"9757060","9758140"," He's like a professional show. "
"9758720","9762600"," And I don't have the tools here to do this."
"9762600","9765620"," But typically what they're looking for is this move back down."
"9766140","9772000"," But in reality, there's a fair chance that you're going to get a move instead. "
"9772740","9778280"," That is something like this right here."
"9779040","9782860"," Office Bell, you can end up getting something like this."
"9783400","9783840"," 280. "
"9785080","9785560"," Not guaranteed."
"9786080","9787980"," You see them trying to push it down right now?"
"9787980","9793120"," If the bulls can hang on into this bell and you can squeeze out these shorts right here, there"
"9793120","9796200"," could be a squeeze opportunity into the clothes on NVIDIA."
"9796520","9802830"," So watch and keep your eyes on NVIDIA and see if they can push up into this bell. "
"9805670","9807150"," We'll look at NVIDIA right now."
"9810000","9812940"," The bears are just relentless on NVIDIA."
"9813320","9814140"," They don't want to see it. "
"9814640","9816880"," It should have been an easy short on NVIDIA, right?"
"9818800","9821200"," It should have been an easy short on NVIDIA."
"9821840","9826780"," There are some pissed off people on this morning show that I was listening to."
"9826900","9827740"," This is a professional one. "
"9827960","9829040"," This isn't a Twitter one either."
"9833230","9834770"," Bears are just pissed."
"9837670","9839150"," Nice call of instruction NVIDIA. "
"9841210","9846090"," Bears are saying hell no at 274 and 279."
"9846090","9847730"," And I'll tell you what."
"9847910","9848490"," Clares go. "
"9848630","9852430"," I'm not clear skies, but they don't want to give this up."
"9852530","9853210"," There's some more sellers."
"9853510","9855790"," Maybe it does spike up in the media reverses. "
"9856350","9858570"," All these sellers are just brutal back here."
"9858890","9859550"," 300, baby."
"9861450","9865650"," So we'll see if NVIDIA can put a squeeze on into the clothes. "
"9865990","9866790"," I think that they can."
"9867950","9869330"," I think that they have a chance."
"9877760","9880160"," Matter of fact, this is about where it is right here. "
"9880160","9882420"," This is right currently where we are in NVIDIA."
"9883740","9887040"," See this dip that just took place down here to 267.21?"
"9887540","9888380"," I don't know if you're watching."
"9889780","9894360"," You want to see this get bought right here and see if NVIDIA can squeeze even higher. "
"9894960","9899220"," I don't know if you guys are watching NVIDIA right now."
"9900640","9901800"," Bring it back over here."
"9902040","9902840"," See it right down here?"
"9903920","9905400"," These bears, right?"
"9905600","9907200"," When they'd make tries like this, right?"
"9907880","9910500"," One and two, it could explode higher. "
"9910500","9912000"," So we'll see if they break through."
"9912420","9915580"," And if they're not able to break through, you're going to see a large move higher."
"9917700","9919980"," We'll look for NVIDIA calls to come through. "
"9923520","9924700"," I'll show you guys NVIDIA again."
"9925760","9927060"," Give your eyes an NVIDIA here."
"9998060","9999160"," Calls on spy. "
"10002140","10003620"," Google spy again."
"10021340","10022380"," All right."
"10025840","10026900"," This right here. "
"10027960","10029600"," Bring this back over for you."
"10029680","10030520"," Remember what I gave to you?"
"10030620","10033080"," I said to you, I'm looking for a buy-in."
"10033080","10036440"," I said to you, I was looking for a buy-in. "
"10036520","10036900"," What did I say?"
"10037120","10039560"," I said, I think I said one, two, right?"
"10039680","10042880"," Or maybe I said one, two, and three, right?"
"10044740","10045820"," So I'm back again."
"10047180","10049120"," And I'm going to be looking for a buy."
"10077490","10078910"," Great opportunities today. "
"10080510","10081210"," Boom, boom."
"10083890","10086910"," Already having a, already, already again, bought back up like it's nothing."
"10092790","10096430"," We'll look to see if there's a rejection off this white line, this fat white line right here. "
"10096710","10099330"," And if not, we'll hold."
"10102010","10103070"," Great liquidation break."

"10569860","10571360"," You guys remember talking about Uber?"
"10572620","10574880"," The fuck is Uber doing up there?"
"10575880","10580580"," Well, that consolidation just bounced off 33.48. Woohoo!"

"10615900","10616640"," There's 34."
"10617260","10620800"," Looks like the sellers came down to meet at 30. "
"10621020","10621880"," They swooped down."
"10622400","10623880"," They weren't fucking around, were they?"
"10624540","10626400"," This is really what I want to see right here."
"10626640","10627760"," $35 on Uber. "
"10633260","10634400"," Smash and Ambassion."
"10634580","10639060"," We'll keep our eyes out for more Tesla calls and see if Tesla can actually get to $1,000."
"10639240","10640340"," They might squeeze up at the bell. "
"10641380","10643320"," I don't discount them squeezing up to the bell."
"10643440","10645140"," It looks like some of the sellers are disappearing."
"10645140","10647280"," There's a lot of work going on right here right now. "
"10647760","10648860"," A lot of sellers here."

"10773340","10775220"," existence is threatened, what does that mean?"
"10775400","10779360"," Does that mean they want to fucking pull the gloves off and throw it out with the U.S.?"
"10779360","10783360"," Representative Thai saying the U.S. are starting an important conversation on trade. "

"10793160","10795580"," Is this saying that they want to fuck around?"
"10795580","10798540"," Because I think it'd be fucking dope if they fucked around."

"10872320","10873180"," You know what happened?"
"10873660","10876740"," The truth is you probably wouldn't threaten their existence because. "
"10877780","10880960"," That would open the fucking door for China to fucking go in there."
"10880960","10882200"," China wouldn't give two shits."
"10882360","10884700"," If my fact China would love to see us destroyed Russia. "
"10885740","10887880"," Because of the enemy and my enemy and the friend of my female."

"10894140","10897540"," Matter of fact, India, Turkey, Pakistan, they'd all love that shit too."
"10898880","10903560"," Because Russia would be taken out of the picture and it would leave China as the only other"

"10907660","10912260"," What you really want is you really want fucking, and you don't want Putin taken out. "
"10912360","10912840"," I saw it."
"10913060","10917560"," I keep seeing everyone saying that the oligarchs want to kill Putin."
"10918580","10920040"," But you really don't want that to happen. "
"10920040","10924360"," What you really want is you want a revolution from their people."
"10924720","10926720"," You want the oligarchs taken out of power."
"10927180","10931520"," You want real freedom put in, even if it's there for freedom, but you don't want corrupted freedom. "

"10937500","10941160"," We want to get rid of the mafia style corruption in Russia."
"10942300","10944920"," What you do is remove all the oligarchs and Putin. "
"10946180","10947960"," Our CIA has done that in many countries."
"10948360","10954280"," You really need that grassroots movement so that they can elect whatever system that they want."
"10955080","10961760"," As long as it's not extremist on either the oligarchs are the extremists of capitalism and then, of"
"10961760","10967220"," course, you don't want a North Korean style communism either. "
"10970380","10971940"," You want these people to be a part of the world."
"10972000","10976560"," The world economy, world society, all that stuff."
"10976720","10977740"," How do you get that to happen?"
"10978060","10982860"," The real scary part is if they get rid of Putin and they just put in another fucking oligarch. "
"10983420","10985600"," So everything on the outside looks real, but it's not."
"10986440","10991520"," Because you'll wind up here again someday because they've stolen so much from that country."
"10992080","10992520"," Progress. "
"10992740","10993300"," That country's lost."
"10993560","11001400"," So since when they had the fall of Berlin Wall and they had the fall of USSR, they went down"
"11001400","11004540"," this path that led to where they're at right now."
"11004900","11009940"," Had they done what most of the eastern block countries have done, they'd be much better off than"
"11009940","11010580"," they are right now. "
"11010740","11011800"," And you can see it even in Ukraine."
"11012800","11013700"," We're cranes like fuck this."
"11014260","11016720"," I want to live this life, not the life that you want. "
"11017180","11018180"," I just heads up."
"11018320","11019520"," We've got more."
"11019960","11020940"," I don't know if I told you about this. "
"11021000","11022900"," We've got spy puts that came in at $239."
"11025020","11027760"," May 2460 P10.2 million dollars."
"11028140","11031320"," It's nice to see those in the money though, or slightly higher. "
"11032700","11034260"," And not down at fucking 400."
"11035600","11039680"," If you guys recall, if any of you guys are listening to me right now, if you guys remember when"
"11039680","11040540"," we started selling off."
"11040720","11046120"," President saying there are no major incidents reported after the earthquake. "
"11046800","11047520"," Earlier today."
"11048720","11051660"," If you guys recall, we started selling off in early January."
"11052660","11056000"," And I remember that I was having a conversation where I said, you know, it's one thing to have puts"
"11056000","11056720"," that are in the money. "
"11057100","11061440"," It's a whole nother fucking thing to see puts rolling in their way to fuck down at like, you know,"
"11061600","11061900"," 420."
"11062260","11065860"," I think at that time it was 420s and 440s and shit like that."
"11066320","11067180"," And we were high still. "
"11067320","11067960"," We're still like 480."
"11068500","11070900"," It was like you don't want to see calls or puts way down there."
"11070900","11072780"," But you start seeing puts up here, 460. "
"11073680","11073980"," 520."
"11074360","11075620"," May 2460 P."
"11075880","11077020"," That's a better sign."
"11077380","11083160"," It's a healthier sign than seeing deep, deep, deep, deep outside the money puts. "
"11092590","11095130"," Nice little pump back on and video here."
"11095470","11097590"," See if they can close it out strong or not."
"11097990","11103170"," If they don't close this out strong, I'm a little wary on the market going into tomorrow for maybe"
"11103170","11103710"," a red day. "
"11110100","11110880"," We'll take a look at Tesla."
"11110880","11113360"," I might have a red day coming out of tomorrow."
"11114740","11117060"," Not being able to get higher than this 984. "
"11119500","11121600"," It'd be nice to see a squeeze into the bell."
"11122140","11125040"," Nice to see a squeeze up to 1000 than a red day tomorrow."
"11127120","11129820"," I can't predict what happens from here into the close. "
"11131020","11133440"," This can always, this is pure gambling here."
"11133980","11136960"," And the reason being is that you get two things that can happen."
"11137120","11137900"," You can get a squeeze higher. "
"11138760","11142340"," Squeeze the shorts out for every last penny."
"11143180","11149360"," Or you start to get some profit taking at some point."
"11154360","11158360"," The one thing I will give the bulls is the consolidation that's taking place all day long. "
"11160220","11166780"," This is a good ripe consolidation for this one last move higher."
"11168620","11169520"," Does that work?"
"11172560","11173460"," Maybe we can get."
"11175260","11178660"," We can get just slightly bigger balls heading into the close here. "
"11182780","11186340"," Call that the inverse upside down cock and balls formation."
"11193820","11195940"," So we'll do it more time with it."
"11196080","11196660"," We'll do it this way. "
"11213320","11215520"," That's what the bears are like reset it already."
"11215520","11220680"," See if you look right here at this point right here."
"11221100","11223940"," And this is how it kind of goes right here. "
"11224060","11224860"," It's kind of getting limp."
"11226480","11227560"," Don't want it to get limp."
"11227820","11228760"," We need to go up here. "
"11228760","11229560"," We need to go up here."
"11229640","11230420"," We need to have a lot of inflation."
"11230800","11231400"," It's a hard thing. "
"11231500","11231780"," Into the close."
"11234120","11235160"," As the bulls want."
"11239500","11240060"," I'll stop. "
"11242320","11242840"," I'll stop."
"11243120","11243400"," I promise."
"11252820","11254900"," You have definitely not getting me sponsors this way. "
"11257500","11260260"," They're like YouTube's like we want to review all of your video."
"11260480","11261900"," I'm like I don't know if you can do that."
"11262460","11264160"," I don't know if you can review my videos. "
"11265320","11274700"," I don't know if you can see the cock and ball formation on my videos."
"11274860","11275940"," It's a legitimate formation."
"11284340","11287360"," It's a legitimate formation on spy right now. "
"11289700","11291840"," You'll limp dick pattern on the one minute."
"11292200","11301660"," Oh shit."
"11302040","11302840"," Too funny. "
"11310700","11311740"," Manscape."
"11320490","11321810"," Oh shit."
"11321870","11322130"," Zach. "
"11330190","11331950"," Just be conscious right here."
"11332110","11332130"," Okay."
"11332190","11334650"," We're talking about maybe the market squeezing up into the close. "
"11334770","11336990"," Just be conscious that we've spot puts coming in right now."
"11337350","11341730"," We've got some March 25th 440 CRPs."
"11345220","11346880"," March 25th 440 P."
"11347780","11349280"," 153,000 dollars. "
"11349360","11351100"," 115,000 dollars."
"11353960","11359700"," Probably going to see a move by bears to try to buy this as a top."
"11360120","11362880"," Check on Twitter and see if you see any bears out there. "
"11365450","11369050"," The feds daily says that we have a lot of inflation."
"11369750","11371090"," That's a hard thing for sentiment."
"11372650","11373870"," You know it's weird. "
"11374050","11374690"," You don't really need."
"11378630","11380510"," Well, there's two things you got to think about, right?"
"11383670","11385310"," You don't really need good news."
"11385790","11387230"," You just don't need any bad news. "
"11387370","11391290"," We haven't had any bad news for the market to go up."
"11391710","11392650"," And that's what we've had."
"11392770","11393410"," We haven't any good news. "
"11393590","11394490"," We haven't any bad news either."
"11394850","11396130"," Daily saying we have a lot of inflation."
"11396130","11397290"," That's a hard thing for sentiment. "
"11397910","11399170"," I don't know about that."
"11399550","11400930"," I disagree with that to an extent."
"11402070","11405050"," The one thing that bulls should be scared about. "
"11405050","11406910"," If you want to be scared about something as a bull."
"11408770","11411810"," You know the one thing that can scare a fucking bull that nobody's been talking about."
"11413530","11415110"," Especially we haven't heard any of that. "
"11415130","11415410"," I don't know."
"11415570","11416670"," I haven't been on Twitter today either."
"11416790","11419110"," So I don't know what Twitter is saying here. "
"11421610","11423470"," That Tesla's like, I want it."
"11423810","11424790"," Tesla's like, I want 1000."
"11425890","11426390"," Damn it. "
"11427090","11428290"," This is like, give it to me now."
"11429890","11430610"," I love Tesla."
"11431130","11432170"," I love Tesla bulls too. "
"11434310","11441030"," But you know what the one thing is that, you know the one thing is that no one's talking about."
"11442430","11444430"," They've got fed speakers the rest of this week."
"11447210","11448150"," And it does. "
"11448210","11449210"," It does bring it."
"11449570","11452790"," It like it's scratched at the back of my ass yesterday."
"11452990","11457230"," I was like, man, I was like, this would be easy for them to have all these speakers come out"
"11457230","11457690"," this week. "
"11458290","11460670"," And then all you need is the market to be on a high."
"11460670","11466230"," And they only have to say is we're going to do an emergency fed meeting and raise rates raise rates"
"11466230","11467270"," in an emergency meeting."
"11467670","11469050"," And they've done that in the past, right?"
"11469710","11470530"," So imagine that. "
"11470770","11475670"," Like if they did that, if they did that shit, like you just fucking cranking along, plugging along,"
"11475670","11479870"," hit 450, hit 460 and then the fed just goes, just drops the hammer and goes."
"11480690","11482790"," Well, we're announcing an emergency fed meeting."
"11482930","11484970"," We're going to slap 50 BPS right now. "
"11485990","11488590"," That shit would send the market into a fucking death spiral."
"11489890","11494390"," I don't think it's going to happen, but you want to scare a fucking bull."
"11494530","11495150"," That's what you tell them. "
"11498410","11500510"," What's your birthday wish for the market captain?"
"11500890","11501710"," Good question, Will."
"11503490","11507150"," Yeah, we have Jerome tomorrow, right?"
"11507410","11509490"," We had bear bear Jerome a couple days ago."
"11510370","11511110"," Oh, yeah. "
"11515150","11519050"," You get somewhat bearish if ES hits under 44 77."
"11520570","11521350"," I won't."
"11521470","11522490"," I see us go into 440. "
"11523130","11524130"," I think 440 is easy."
"11527290","11529490"," I think I think 440 is easy to tag."
"11530050","11533910"," I'm not going to get I wouldn't get bearish unless we let me look real quick. "
"11534770","11536770"," I wouldn't get bearish unless we broke."
"11542740","11544520"," Yeah, 440 is looking like a need."
"11544740","11546020"," I would be fine. "
"11546240","11548360"," I'd be comfortable buying a dip at 440."
"11550220","11550800"," I would."
"11555700","11557360"," I'd feel good buying a dip at 440. "
"11558000","11559820"," I wouldn't feel good buying a dip under 440."
"11561220","11564700"," Yesterday, the day before I felt good buying a dip at 435."
"11565060","11566440"," It's raised now to 440. "
"11567240","11568860"," So I would feel confident there."
"11569320","11572180"," If we broke below 440, I'd be like shit, we're fucked."
"11574740","11579880"," But right around 440 right now is by the fucking dip by the dip at four. "
"11580080","11588800"," A little easy like I could easily buy a dip at like 443, 444."
"11590340","11591020"," Easy."
"11591620","11594820"," That's just that's just trading back to the previous low. "
"11595520","11597960"," I think that's super easy to buy."
"11599180","11602160"," Some below 440 would be bearish to me."
"11603480","11604600"," Like market bearish. "
"11611900","11615660"," What do I want the market to do?"
"11616000","11617540"," I want us to print iron the clothes."
"11618660","11620600"," I want it to go as high as possible into the belt today."
"11622000","11624760"," So that's if you want to know what I want for the rest of the day. "
"11628760","11631200"," The world's biggest hotel with 10,000 rooms now under development."
"11631200","11635360"," We're just saying bearish under 300 per spot."
"11635580","11639940"," Just via U.S. national security wise says U.S. will discuss these new weapons with allies and"
"11639940","11640200"," partners. "
"11640480","11641300"," Yeah, they should."
"11642440","11644940"," Because there's a dude, Doug."
"11647000","11648080"," Bro, thank you, Doug. "
"11648320","11649860"," Thanks for tipping me for my birthday, bro."

"11665420","11666100"," Thank you very much."
"11666760","11667520"," The new trader."
"11667760","11669140"," Thanks for helping assist us through. "
"11670840","11671720"," To the market."
"11671840","11672420"," Hell, yeah."
"11674240","11675000"," Hell's yes. "
"11677580","11680880"," They should because that's the conversation we're just having, right?"
"11681060","11682880"," The conversation we're just having is that."
"11684280","11684780"," Conversation."
"11685240","11686360"," Back up to 449. "
"11686860","11688500"," See if we can tag 450 in the bell."
"11688720","11689640"," What do I want to see happen?"
"11690080","11692540"," I'll show you right now what I want to see happen."
"11692940","11694940"," I want to see something like this. "
"11697020","11698780"," I want to see this in the bell."
"11701780","11703060"," That's what I want to see in the bell."
"11703400","11704700"," Just one last ripper high. "
"11705720","11706520"," Get this nice little."
"11709400","11710380"," Consolidation down here."
"11711280","11713680"," And if we can swoop it up, even if it takes into. "
"11715480","11716840"," This moment over here."
"11718440","11721780"," We can get up into this 45276 zone of some kind."
"11722020","11723100"," Now I don't know if we're getting here. "
"11725140","11726200"," Because he's like a turtle."
"11727980","11729040"," He's like a turtle back."
"11730520","11732040"," So handsome little turtle guy. "
"11732780","11733660"," Little smiley face."
"11735020","11735700"," He looks good."
"11735880","11737040"," He's got like little feet down here. "
"11739920","11742880"," And he's leaving behind all this, you know, this is tail over here."
"11744000","11744760"," The shell."
"11745060","11748120"," I guess the shell might maybe it's shells terrible looking shell, isn't it?"
"11749100","11749720"," Terrible shell. "
"11750480","11751120"," There he goes."
"11751300","11752340"," He's looking a lot better here."
"11752840","11753560"," He's going to help here. "
"11754020","11755320"," He's got a little gizzard over here."
"11756440","11757800"," And he just wants to get here."
"11758020","11760540"," If he can just get here, he's going to be a happy, happy little fella. "
"11762100","11764800"," So we think in nasty thoughts out there either, okay?"
"11766060","11768120"," So I want to see that move up higher."
"11768740","11773000"," The only problem that we have is if people start to take profit heading into the bell."
"11773640","11774980"," That's a great run by the way. "
"11776600","11777560"," We'll see if we move up."
"11778700","11780080"," Nice dip by down here."
"11780180","11781120"," Nice, nice way to print. "

"11860960","11866540"," Another note to programming note is that this Saturday or Sunday, we're going to build together a"

"11878460","11880020"," We're going to work on the next couple of weeks. "
"11880020","11885040"," We're going to start trading against market and volume profile and adding that into our regular"
"11885040","11885900"," daily thing."
"11885900","11888820"," We've looked at it in the past every morning before we start the day."
"11888960","11890500"," We haven't focused on it as a trading tool. "
"11891000","11894920"," And so we're going to build a script to your own script that you can then give to your friends"
"11894920","11897480"," and say, Hey, this is my script and I'm a badass."
"11898140","11904000"," And this weekend we're going to build a market volume profile script for yourself."
"11904380","11905260"," This is yours. "
"11905540","11911100"," You can build it to your specifications and we'll start trading off."
"11911220","11913660"," We're going to actually trade off that instead of just reviewing it in the morning."
"11914420","11919620"," We'll trade off it for one, two, three weeks until you get confidence and comfortable trading it. "
"11920160","11922560"," And then you can have that in your toolkit and use it every day."
"11923460","11926040"," Watching lots of spy calls come into the end right now, by the way."

"11948500","11949920"," Let's see if we can get this squeeze up."
"11950540","11953420"," Those calls were down as low as, I think, $1.26 or something."
"11954100","11956120"," And then in the high, they were at like 165, 170. "
"11957180","11959080"," So there is a little bit of money to be made in here."

"13272550","13274230"," I don't know if I'm going to get later lucky tonight."
"13274310","13275290"," You never know what's on the menu."

"13386810","13390210"," It sounds like a drop in the bucket like oil."
"13390630","13393250"," 500,000 metric tons is not a lot of steel. "
"13393510","13394730"," That might be like one warship."
"13396250","13401410"," We'll require annual audits of British Steel due to its ownership by China's Jing Ye Group."
"13402070","13403570"," So it looks like it involves China as well. "
"13403830","13411330"," It does impact X new and then STLD EWU SLX and trade X."
"13412610","13416990"," But you might want to look at a short on on US steel on X specifically."
"13417990","13419710"," You might be able to get a good short off that."
"13420030","13424530"," Let's say it was short down today off a rip from taking place over some time. "
"13425350","13427730"," But you might on a high you might really get a good short off that."
"13453760","13455820"," Spy just fighting its way back now."
"13456780","13461000"," Had a nice little bounce off of this of this line of support down below here. "
"13464900","13468120"," Higher higher higher lower higher high."
"13500160","13502180"," See if the reverse is here or not."
"13502320","13504100"," If we can get another plug or push up. "
"13504320","13506000"," If not we don't want to see the reversal here."
"13512310","13514510"," We don't want to see this this turn over here."
"13514990","13517010"," There isn't much sitting down below it. "
"13517010","13524130"," I don't know if you can grab that VWAP this late in the day."
"13527130","13530970"," 447 is a this is all volatility all support here at 447."
"13535480","13536600"," 445 444. "
"13537320","13540760"," This is good volatility all the way down here to 441."
"13541520","13543400"," I said 440 I think I mean 441."
"13544240","13547880"," 441 is where I buy I buy the fucking dip. "
"13552220","13554260"," Yeah 441 I'd be buying the dip."
"13555680","13558020"," There's some nice support here at 445."
"13559160","13561620"," And then the good support here is a lot of support here. "
"13561800","13563700"," You don't have to see sellers enter the market fierce."
"13567540","13570500"," The seller is starting to step in on Tesla as well."
"13572100","13576540"," Light supply support down in 980 VWAP at 970. "
"13579500","13583220"," Looks like you're looking for 950 not that we're going to go there."
"13583360","13585060"," I know that polls are like we're getting over 1000."
"13585620","13590200"," But if we do have a weakness in the moment week moment in this in this in the stock look"
"13590200","13592980"," for 950 as a place to buy a dip. "
"13594280","13595900"," Here indicator is still very positive."
"13595900","13599160"," More buyers on Tesla into the bell here."
"13613860","13617560"," Yeah the JPM caller has a strike of 45 10. "
"13618360","13619760"," It's 45 10."
"13624160","13627080"," That's where their caller is."
"13645690","13647150"," Initiate the code word fierce. "
"13649930","13651410"," Close Tesla calls."
"13654950","13657690"," Trying to prove a record low just think to those."
"13658790","13662350"," The doctor numbers like Trump holding numbers for his presidential run. "
"13662610","13663650"," Yeah it's kind of weird like."
"13667730","13671270"," It's you know it's weird about the whole like Biden thing."
"13671450","13673150"," I don't care for what president would be. "
"13673150","13675890"," I don't think that's my thing on."
"13676090","13683110"," I think I think that the markets trade or people are like you can't trade the market higher with"
"13683110","13685690"," bonds in the credit market."
"13685990","13690450"," What if it's showing a recession and I'm like oh I don't think it matters what the. "
"13691150","13695210"," I don't think it matters who the president is."
"13695210","13700190"," I think they're going to do everything they possibly can not to allow a recession until after their"
"13700190","13700990"," election their reelection."
"13702570","13707970"," So no matter I think that's part of the reaction to I think when. "
"13710490","13712130"," Jay power speaking the other day."
"13712790","13716070"," It's I think behind the scenes that the banks know."
"13716910","13720050"," That they're going to let it run hot until after that election. "
"13721070","13725450"," On some kind of a backroom promise that they'll fight inflation once he's reelected."
"13727290","13730510"," No do they think they fight inflation once they're reelected I don't know."
"13730870","13731970"," I guess maybe. "
"13732770","13734910"," I think they should I think they tend to blow it up."
"13735690","13737810"," I don't have any faith really in the markets."
"13738230","13741590"," My favorite part though that I heard yesterday was the market will price it in. "
"13741690","13742970"," I'm like that's fucking horseshit."
"13744070","13745370"," That's fucking utter horseshit."
"13745430","13748130"," It's all about fucking bringing it up and dropping it down and making money. "
"13751010","13755190"," Don't beat it till it dies and I think as long as they have the tacit agreement to the president"
"13755190","13756110"," which I think that they do."
"13756690","13758430"," I think they would have the tacit agreement from any president."
"13758850","13759430"," I'll tell you what. "
"13760250","13763650"," Tell you what the next presidential election right no matter where we are."
"13764410","13768530"," No matter where the fuck the economy is I guarantee you that whoever's running against the"
"13768530","13771910"," president is going to say that they're going to remove the rates off the system."
"13772710","13774350"," And they're going to try to pump this shit up again. "
"13775330","13776490"," That's going to be one of the promises."
"13776490","13779470"," It's kind of gross."
"13779890","13785370"," I don't know if they get elected for that or what the poor people do and if they actually come"
"13785370","13786110"," on vote or not. "
"13787350","13789990"," They always claim they're going to come on and vote but they don't."
"13791070","13796570"," That's the sad fact and they'll scream on social media but they don't actually vote."
"13800310","13801630"," When especially when it counts. "
"13803470","13804490"," So I don't know."
"13804590","13807390"," I don't know what happens with the economy but it seems like they've blown off."
"13807610","13811750"," Jay Powell's statement right that they're going to get serious on on tamping down inflation. "
"13812630","13815350"," I think somewhere in there's a back room deal where they're not going to."
"13816070","13819150"," They're going to try to not not going to try to hammer it down."
"13819310","13824430"," They're just going to try to slow its rate of growth over the next two years until the next"
"13824430","13825630"," presidential election. "
"13828600","13831320"," Calls coming in on Tesla once again."
"13831760","13839100"," Tesla March 25th 1050 C $525,000 Apple calls March 25th 172.5 C $36,000."
"13839680","13844800"," Because some small bid some small day traders spy calls for 50 C $83,000. "
"13845340","13849120"," Just day traders trying to buy dips and sell rips here into the bell."
"13850360","13853880"," And not get caught on the wrong side of this trade as we head into the bell."
"13853880","13859400"," More from the New Zealand finance minister saying RB and Z response will put pressure on business. "
"13861360","13862620"," We'll see it down here."
"13864600","13867460"," Yeah, this is where I didn't want to see that reversal right down here."
"13867840","13871760"," I want to see a nice push up higher one to push higher. "
"13895310","13900510"," We can talk about rates not probably not appropriate today but we'll spend some time on the tales"
"13900510","13900870"," too."
"13903110","13904690"," We'll talk about the 10s and 2s."
"13905210","13906090"," The 1200s. "
"13906150","13907650"," We'll talk about the tech 1200s."
"13911310","13912990"," We'll talk about the threes and the thirties."
"13919970","13921110"," We'll talk about TLT. "
"13932880","13934840"," We'll talk about why the market can go up."
"13937310","13940710"," We'll talk about why they can run this market into the ground as it goes up."
"13940710","13944050"," We'll talk about how people can get poor at the market and succeed. "
"13961000","13962960"," We did see an expansion of calls today."
"13963420","13970340"," So whatever weakness that we see here, I'm not as bearish with the expansion of calls and how in"
"13970340","13971260"," the money the puts are."
"13971460","13973740"," So just closing the market out here. "
"13974140","13975660"," It's 333 of a half an hour left."
"13976360","13981480"," This is what I will tell you is that there is call expansion now to 470."
"13982400","13984980"," And there is a call expansion to 460. "
"13985880","13988040"," So that leaves some room to run higher."
"13989680","13992680"," You should be expecting yesterday, today, tomorrow."
"13993420","13996980"," At some point this week, you should see some weakness in the market. "
"13997220","13999400"," Some roll over two lows."
"13999860","14007100"," I don't see right now the door wide open to 4,000 due to the puts that were bought."
"14007420","14008100"," So they're so high. "
"14008260","14009380"," They're at right now, they're at 430."
"14010020","14017060"," So I would see weakness down to 440 currently and look for a move higher at this point."
"14018040","14021600"," Look towards 460 for the market to trade to. "
"14021980","14023100"," It could take some time."
"14023280","14027580"," If we have a volatility crush, this includes two other news events."
"14028140","14030580"," It includes positive and negative news. "
"14030960","14032900"," Positive and negative news could include Ukraine."
"14034000","14039940"," Then on both sides, positive or negative news could include an emergency fed rate hike."
"14040560","14042280"," Negative news could include. "
"14043600","14045180"," It's just something unforeseen."
"14045700","14053740"," So we trade this day by day and we look for which way the market's going based upon large events"
"14053740","14055480"," and sentiment."
"14063770","14069590"," So if you are a bull and you want to take some profit, you'll be looking for some weakness down"
"14069590","14072830"," to 445 and possibly even 440. "
"14073270","14074990"," It's not off the table to look for weakness there."
"14075490","14082050"," If you just look at a five day, no reason why you can't trade back down here to 440 and"
"14082050","14082870"," make another move higher."
"14082870","14088710"," No reason why we can't trade down to 445 or 443, 440 in this zone right here. "
"14089070","14090610"," Actually, I'm not showing you this right now, am I?"
"14091090","14095450"," So there's no reason why we can't trade down here."
"14096250","14099230"," If you're a bull and you're like, hey, I want to reposition myself."
"14099870","14101710"," You can always look for a dip by here. "
"14102130","14104330"," You can always look for a dip by down here somewhere."
"14105770","14109590"," And the by the fucking dip is down here at 440."
"14109590","14115190"," The next run up if you're looking for where we should ultimately go right now from the expansion"
"14115190","14116210"," and calls in the market. "
"14117150","14122890"," Unless everybody starts selling out would probably be somewhere around."
"14123810","14131530"," Might take some time, but somewhere around this large resistance up here is at that 460, 458 number"
"14131530","14132790"," we talked about earlier today."
"14133590","14137070"," You're going to look for some selling as we get up here, some resistance. "
"14137770","14139790"," Just note that banks are short up here."
"14140310","14145150"," If we are able to break above 460, you would see some big squeezes happen there."
"14145810","14148890"," Not so much in here, but you'll see big squeezes above 460. "
"14149350","14151990"," That's down the road, I guess, if we continue higher."
"14152690","14156510"," If we do start to sell the market down, I'm not seeing."
"14157290","14160770"," So right now you've got a bunch of puts being bought down here at 429. "
"14160770","14167090"," So I don't think they can get through to 450 unless you start to add for waterfall puts."
"14167090","14169230"," That would then the waterfall puts down to 420."
"14169850","14172630"," That would then steps their staircases back down again. "
"14173090","14179450"," The risk that we had in the market this past seven to ten days in terms of sell down to"
"14179450","14182870"," 4,000 is receding, believe it or not."
"14183710","14189530"," As we have had call expansion edge of the market and we've had some put expansion that is slightly"
"14189530","14190750"," higher than 4,000."
"14192690","14195110"," We haven't seen that in the ETFs. "
"14195170","14201390"," We have seen it in stocks, but not until today we see some bolstering of the ETFs."
"14201670","14202790"," Today we saw it."
"14204170","14205970"," Finally, that's taken some time. "
"14206150","14208670"," We haven't seen that even since March 15th."
"14208710","14214110"," We haven't seen anything that's outside of the money or farther than zero to three days out."
"14238130","14240050"," Just note some market internals. "
"14240250","14243250"," The New York Stock Exchange volume is 522 million shares."
"14243750","14245630"," 1% above its three month average."
"14246290","14249770"," Advancers led the client is 1.5 to 1."
"14250230","14251830"," That is to be expected yesterday. "
"14252190","14253750"," It was like a eight to one, right?"
"14254450","14257410"," Today it's 1.5 to 1."
"14257410","14259730"," Nasdaq volume 4.26 billion shares."
"14260250","14262590"," 13% above its three month average."
"14262970","14265430"," Huge moves in Nasdaq today. "
"14266350","14269070"," Advancers led the client is 2.3 to 1."
"14269490","14275610"," The VIX index was down 2% at 2310 worth taking a note at that 23."
"14275950","14279170"," It looks like it doesn't want to break below 2270."
"14280070","14281510"," It is basing right now. "
"14281550","14284770"," It's been basing since, to be honest with you, since 930 this morning."
"14285410","14291770"," To see some weakness come into play or to see a straight lower for us to get higher, we're going"
"14291770","14295930"," to need to see some changes in market internals as we move forward in the week."
"14314540","14319820"," I think on the election stuff, you guys got to remember that they're going to use the playbook of"
"14319820","14321120"," not following Jimmy Carter. "
"14322360","14329820"," Because I think you look at Jimmy Carter and just a note here, seeing some puts on arc F."
"14332880","14336520"," July 15th, 30 p 1.9 million dollars."
"14336640","14340880"," Just remember that I don't think any president that's running for president is going to want to"
"14340880","14342920"," ever follow the playbook of Jimmy Carter and Volcker."
"14343340","14347280"," It's not that you don't bring a Volcker in, it's that you don't want to do it before your first"
"14347280","14348120"," firm's over, right?"
"14348300","14349580"," There's no president, no party. "
"14350880","14356960"," That wants to do that stuff until after they win their second election."
"14358200","14364280"," Or even if they step down, secure the election for their, for their heir parent that they're going"
"14364280","14364680"," to back."
"14365260","14366500"," They just don't want to do it. "
"14366920","14368460"," It doesn't matter what party you are."
"14369160","14371340"," So more than likely they're going to try to time this."
"14373780","14377240"," Time this so that it takes place at the minimum after the Senate. "
"14377640","14382500"," And then, of course, the big one would be the president, the presidential reelection, and that puts"
"14382500","14384800"," you right into that puts you right into 2024."
"14385360","14387080"," So the task before."
"14388360","14393820"," The task before the fed probably behind a closed door is, Hey, don't fuck up the economy. "
"14395160","14398000"," Or don't put us into a recession until November 2024."
"14402480","14403680"," That's what they're probably saying."
"14403880","14407800"," If I was to guess behind closed doors, Hey, you get as much access as you want. "
"14408440","14411740"," And you can do whatever you want, because we know your bros with everybody else in the finance"
"14411740","14412040"," world."
"14412320","14415800"," Just don't fucking burn the economy down or the market down until."
"14417160","14418580"," Until after the election. "
"14419360","14423460"," Then you probably have other backdoor deals where you get, you know, some other contenders saying,"
"14423480","14425260"," Hey, look, burn it down."
"14426880","14429980"," And we'll put you or your buddies in power for the next day here."
"14430060","14432080"," So I see you have that other side of the argument too. "
"14435000","14436360"," But it does look like that."
"14436460","14443860"," That's what they're trying to"
"14443860","14448540"," do."
"14448540","14450220"," Some unknown dates. "
"14450440","14452220"," I'm assuming it's elections of some kind."
"14459840","14463620"," Someone noted by Biden's approval rating drops to new low 40% earlier."
"14463920","14465720"," And now Walter Bloomberg was mentioning it. "
"14466440","14467000"," Yeah."
"14467300","14470160"," So Biden's approval ratings drops to new low 40%."
"14470160","14471760"," And that's the conundrum for Biden, right?"
"14472920","14478300"," Does he like does Biden help out poor people about yet lose the election?"
"14478960","14480880"," Because the truth is behind the closed doors. "
"14481700","14483960"," Blind closed doors that always comes down to taxes."
"14484540","14489760"," It always comes down to where the economy is and where the market is, believe it or not."
"14490380","14494820"," It has to do with not just the price of a loaf of bread or a loaf of bread or"
"14494820","14499640"," gas, but it comes down to people's pensions and their 401ks and all that kind of stuff. "
"14499980","14500560"," It's weird."
"14500740","14503420"," When you get into a boat and booth and you actually own shit, I promise you."
"14504060","14505300"," If you own shit, right?"
"14506640","14508320"," I'm telling you, if you own shit. "
"14509000","14512040"," You don't always vote this way 100%."
"14512540","14518720"," But you think to yourself, like, I want free health care, but I don't want to pay more taxes for"
"14518720","14518940"," it."
"14519880","14520140"," Right. "
"14520460","14522940"," I want free college, but I don't want to pay more taxes for it."
"14524880","14527100"," So you're always looking for that balance."
"14527180","14528960"," If you can find it as a voter. "
"14529240","14533040"," And if you don't find it as a voter in the bottom line, as you're going to get fucked or"
"14533040","14536200"," your pensions getting burned to the ground, you know, you tend to react."
"14536660","14538640"," With a vote that way."
"14538980","14543920"," And people that have things to lose, like literal, like their house, their cars, their pensions,"
"14544100","14544440"," they vote. "
"14544720","14546300"," They show up every time, especially when it's bad."
"14547140","14550080"," Even if they don't show up when it's not bad, they do show up when it is bad."
"14550780","14557060"," And they will slam that voting button down or that labor or whatever, whether it's the right vote"
"14557060","14557440"," or not. "
"14557880","14561740"," It doesn't matter if you could show them, you know, oh, you're making the wrong decision."
"14562440","14563000"," They don't care."
"14563160","14564180"," They want that instant gratification. "
"14564180","14569100"," Watching some puts roll through right now on Apple, Tesla, ArcG, Roblox."
"14569700","14574000"," Roblox big puts May 20th 50 P 1.3 million dollars."
"14574280","14578820"," Tesla puts March 25th, 970 P 594,000 dollars. "
"14579100","14585240"," Apple puts April 1st, 162.5 P 61,000 dollars."
"14588940","14591440"," I'm going to squeeze those bears out right into the close."
"14592240","14594020"," I'm going to squeeze them out to 450. "
"14595660","14597720"," That squeeze happening right now."
"14598500","14599720"," Just bear rage."
"14609820","14612780"," I'm going to add some puts in here myself into this bell actually. "
"14613380","14616820"," So if we go higher into, we got 449 92."
"14617360","14622900"," And if we can trade up to 45 10 or so into this bell, I will probably add some puts"
"14622900","14623200"," on."
"14623480","14625440"," So we'll look to that JPM caller. "
"14626900","14636760"," We will look to the JPM caller, which"
"14636760","14637580"," is right up here."
"14639240","14642240"," And see if we can make that JPM caller."
"14642400","14643240"," It's right up here, 451. "
"14644040","14645400"," See if we can tag it or not."
"14645620","14653000"," We've made another, another attempt for 449.93. So within 7 cents of a 450 price target above here."
"14654360","14656180"," We do have resistance at 450. "
"14656540","14657760"," So we'll see if we can tag this 451."
"14658600","14661700"," And I'll probably add some puts as we get closer."
"14663600","14665860"," Watching calls coming in on NVIDIA. "

"14776660","14778660"," It's 99.77 on the high."
"14779200","14785040"," We'll look to see if Tesla can move on up to 1,000 and just touch that high there."
"14785240","14785760"," Boom. "
"14786120","14789660"," 97.77. See if we can slap that 1,000."
"14790320","14791860"," Slap it like a fat ass."

"14890380","14896680"," Now trade on the high is 450.38. Can we take it up to 451 into the bell is the"
"14896680","14897080"," question. "
"14909570","14912090"," See if we can get this squeeze higher right into the bell."
"14912450","14912710"," 451."
"14913510","14915250"," Slap that fucking ask on JPM. "
"14922300","14924760"," 10 minutes to closing bell in New York on the underneath front."

"15165130","15168650"," I don't think we'll get it, but I'd like to see this last little push higher. "
"15175930","15177730"," We'll see if we can get that last little push."
"15177990","15181130"," Usually it happens the last seven minutes or so."
"15181330","15183630"," What you end up seeing is doesn't matter if we're going up or down. "
"15184410","15187510"," Not always, but a lot of times the last seven minutes or so."
"15187510","15190330"," You end up seeing some big power moves."
"15191630","15192750"," And then you get bad positioning. "
"15198260","15201420"," We'll see if we get an actual legitimate sell down here in the close."
"15237290","15239290"," Still starting to sell off into the bell."
"15240250","15247390"," Tesla now down to 993.27. So we're looking at here. "
"15254950","15256570"," Nice dip buys down here."
"15256570","15258210"," If you're a bull and you want to dip by."
"15259090","15261750"," You could get this for the next move up tomorrow. "
"15268870","15270610"," Now bouncing on VWAP."
"15277820","15279900"," Watching dip buyers step in again."

"15291500","15293080"," $358 C, $76,000."
"15293840","15297420"," Then also watching some last minute put buyers. "
"15297920","15298800"," That's it for tomorrow."
"15298960","15299760"," Excuse me on that date."
"15300480","15305840"," Then Spy puts 323, 448 P for $100,000. "

"15362010","15362490"," How you doing, brother?"
"15370300","15371920"," The caller is not monthly. "
"15372060","15372900"," It's every three months."
"15373780","15375380"," It gets talked about all over the place."
"15376160","15377900"," We talked about it here a few times. "
"15378040","15378920"," I talked about it on JPM."
"15381380","15383680"," I talk about it on stream sometimes."
"15383760","15385400"," The next time I see the new one come out, I'll let you know. "
"15398070","15401450"," Now watching more puts come in on IWM, the Q's."

"15439900","15441200"," Zero dates, baby."
"15441880","15442700"," Zero date puts."
"15447660","15448320"," Let's see. "
"15448460","15450000"," What do we put on today?"
"15451100","15452520"," What was just today?"
"15452780","15454260"," We started the day at."
"15455820","15457680"," Yeah, we started the day today at 445."
"15494980","15496800"," We've got one minute left. "
"15504580","15507780"," So I just bought some shit ton of 440s."
"15507960","15511080"," I bought a shit ton of 447s."
"15513020","15515560"," So we'll see what happens tomorrow. "
"15519740","15521640"," With just a minute left in the bell."
"15523460","15528440"," Watching Spy puts come in $449P, $400,000."
"15532290","15533830"," So I'm loading up right now. "
"15534250","15539210"," I'm actually into my account, like 20% of my account is on puts for tomorrow."
"15549360","15550680"," All right, that was a good day."
"15551900","15553440"," Well, check back with you tomorrow. "
"15553560","15554200"," It's my birthday today."
"15554360","15556440"," So I hope that I don't get too crazy tonight."
"15556900","15559240"," I want to say thank you to all of you that showed up today. "
"15559240","15560360"," Anyone that said thank you."
"15560440","15560820"," Have a birthday."
"15560860","15561340"," That kind of stuff. "
"15561560","15562960"," I appreciate all of you being here."
"15563180","15564000"," It makes my day."
"15564140","15564580"," It makes my week. "
"15564740","15565200"," Makes my year."

"15567900","15569080"," We'll be back again tomorrow. "
"15569400","15573120"," Also look forward to this weekend to being with you on Saturday or Sunday."
"15575180","15577020"," And I will see you guys tomorrow."
"15577300","15578560"," We'll see what happens in the overnight. "
"15578860","15579580"," We'll see if we will."
"15579840","15580060"," I want."
"15580260","15587600"," I'm wondering if we still grab that for the 110 or they see the 451 for JPM caller tomorrow. "
"15587600","15590960"," That would be interesting if it was one more beautiful day of squeeze."
"15591740","15594860"," Or if they pin it sideways for a couple of days, then don't drop it into Friday."
"15595140","15597260"," Would be another interesting day as well. "
"15597640","15599400"," Sometimes they don't drop at the first day."
"15600120","15602700"," So we'll see what happens over the next couple of days."
"15602720","15604100"," I'll catch up with you guys tomorrow. "
"15605140","15606040"," Thanks for showing up."
"15606380","15609640"," If any of you are celebrating a birthday out there, have a birthday to you."
"15610600","15615020"," And I'll be catching to seeing you guys tomorrow bright and early and hopefully not hung over. "
"15615900","15618340"," If I am, maybe I'll show up my pajamas or something."
"15620320","15622140"," You guys all have a wonderful afternoon."
"15622460","15623460"," Thanks for supporting the channel. "
"15623500","15624400"," Please like and subscribe."
"15625260","15627140"," Please check in again tomorrow."
"15627900","15629760"," We'll see if this market continues higher. "
"15630300","15631360"," There is a bid in the market."
"15631500","15632100"," I'll give you that."
"15632300","15633340"," Even if there is a pullback. "
"15633580","15640200"," I'm not seeing that bloodbath that the bloodbath that was available to the market technically was"
"15640200","15641500"," erased today."
"15642000","15644460"," There was enough bid in ETFs today."
"15645000","15647900"," Not showing a huge giant rollover at this point. "
"15648060","15651060"," Unless we have some headline news that we don't know about."
"15651780","15655340"," I'm not seeing the death spiral down to 4,000 anymore."
"15657160","15660220"," I'd say the weakest that we go at this point is 440. "
"15660740","15665900"," If you're going to see a market rollover at this point, look for a rollover to 440."
"15666720","15670200"," That would be your price target for a buy the fucking dip situation."
"15670700","15673420"," If you wanted to buy the dip situation, look for 445. "
"15674320","15676380"," The coming days are a bounce off 445."
"15677040","15680640"," If you see more puts come in, you'll see a bounce on 445 or so."
"15680920","15682880"," Then you'll see more puts come in to take us to 440. "
"15684700","15687320"," I've got one more day left there for tomorrow's expiry."
"15687880","15691920"," That would be the only other thing to think about is sometimes they'll pin the market for a day or"
"15691920","15692120"," two."
"15692640","15694780"," And they won't print the put side until Friday or Monday. "
"15695600","15697040"," So just be careful of that as well."
"15697640","15699520"," You might not see that the next day."
"15699640","15701060"," You might not see the market roll immediately. "
"15701440","15702920"," Sometimes you do, sometimes you don't."
"15703400","15708680"," If we do see a huge market rollover, we have seen that in the past where we trade higher tonight."
"15710540","15715800"," And then you'd see futures green tonight and then you'd see a reversal at like one o'clock, two o "
"15715800","15717220","'clock in the morning or something like that. "
"15717740","15720440"," You'd see a pin and then we'd start reversing."
"15720780","15722000"," You buy puts a little bit too early."
"15722580","15724720"," So we'll have to add to those tomorrow if we do. "
"15725880","15727220"," We'll add to them today."
"15727300","15733400"," Between today and Friday, we'll start getting pretty serious on a pullback and go and fill tilt."
"15733780","15734880"," Okay, so you guys have a great evening. "
"15735280","15736720"," I will check in with you guys tomorrow."
"15738120","15739920"," Happy March 22nd, baby."
"15740460","15742560"," March 22nd, my birthday. "
"15744140","15744920"," I'm kind of stoked."
"15745180","15745640"," It's a good day."
"15746020","15748040"," It's been a good, good, good lead up to this. "
"15749140","15750260"," Of note, too."
"15750700","15751280"," Of note."
"15751760","15754700"," Tomorrow was the day that the market reversed in 2020. "
"15755800","15761260"," This is what tomorrow was one of the worst days that we've seen in market history and released in"
"15761260","15765340"," my history, like worst day or worse week or two leading into it."
"15765560","15770380"," I remember when we were in February and I remember when I pulled my kids out of school and I"
"15770380","15771880"," was like, the market's going to fucking dump."
"15772500","15774300"," It's going to burn and it did. "
"15774600","15775200"," It burned bad."
