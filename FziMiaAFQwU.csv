"160","3520"," You better check on to my check, my check."
"74080","75120"," Administrative leave."
"75440","76600"," Let's get right into it here. "
"76600","78700"," Not too much, but just a couple of things."
"79160","83260"," No, obviously one seconder boys girls voluntary request of documents."
"83620","85960"," Yes, that's why we don't know. "
"86140","86720"," That's wrong."
"86740","89260"," Was it a whistleblower might have been company?"
"89440","89820"," Oh, no."
"90260","90420"," Good morning. "
"90580","93420"," All right, so I've got to meet this here for a minute."
"93420","94640"," You can date of mine."
"94760","102820"," The address database, for example, you know, just heads up for this morning that we've got to move"
"102820","103760"," some of this over here. "
"103780","104360"," Hold on here."
"106640","110920"," We've got slightly over just heads up for this morning that."
"113140","119380"," Market looks like it wants to drop here or not drop necessarily, but it's got some gaps to close to"
"119380","119720"," the downside. "
"119840","122980"," A brief gap down on the hourly trigger on spy at least."
"124380","131060"," But I am cautiously optimistic at the end of the week here or at least into the not the end"
"131060","135480"," of the week, but maybe into the 30th or at least if you can find a dip to buy in"
"135480","136040"," the 30th."
"136140","141020"," Otherwise, it looks like back and forth slow drift to the right and down. "
"145080","148140"," But you know, like yesterday, I was looking at the action yesterday in the market."
"148240","148700"," It was brutal."
"152240","158360"," So I think I think from my own sanity here, nice dip to buy would be nice. "
"158900","159580"," More on out there."
"159680","159980"," How are you all doing?"
"160100","161060"," How are you all doing out there?"
"162260","163120"," Give me one quick second here."
"163120","164560"," We got some stuff to go over before. "
"164840","166740"," I have some other meetings this morning."
"166880","168080"," So we're about to launch this website."
"169000","175500"," And there's a ton of stuff that's background launch specific that I have to be available for. "
"177600","180080"," And I've got more of the same of that this morning."
"182820","184000"," One quick second here."
"184080","184900"," Let me get the set up. "
"185020","186060"," Give me one quick second here."
"186080","186860"," I got some stuff I got to do."
"191020","192900"," How mortgage apps are inflecting positive?"
"193280","197140"," Yeah, I thought that this is one where it got up because of Lenoir and toll brothers. "
"197960","198680"," Good morning."
"198820","199340"," Good morning."
"199500","199820"," Good morning. "
"199860","200360"," Good to see you."
"200360","203540"," I think you've got to give it a day or two and then you can come back and buy it"
"203540","205060"," because it was 282 percent."
"205400","207980"," Oh, we've got some format changes too. "
"208280","214860"," That was down 11 percent, but the orders suggested for 40."
"215540","219040"," My problem with selling a home builder is if rates are going down, you don't want to sell members."
"219660","221300"," Jim, one name we haven't gotten to. "
"221420","222320"," I don't think it's Jay and Jay."
"223160","224740"," Yeah, and I'm ready for you."
"224840","225140"," What do you need?"
"225420","227460"," I just want to know what your thoughts are about the cord. "
"227560","229940"," The stock is down a little over two percent right now."
"229940","230280"," Okay."
"230360","232140"," Very, very good. "
"232740","233980"," Pharma was very good."
"234280","235020"," I got a reset."
"235160","238200"," We still don't have an answer to TALC. "
"239440","243320"," That's the litigation related to the accusations that"
"243320","252200"," TALC is our carcinogens."
"252200","255240"," Texas, that's what's hurting the stock."
"255480","259339"," And I know that they don't want to hear me necessarily say that, but I love J&J, but I"
"259339","259600"," got it. "
"259820","261260"," I think compared to J&J and the Eagles."
"261500","265520"," I just don't know what happens after the 16, but J&J."
"265740","266580"," So you stay away?"
"268000","270720"," And until we get a resolution of TALC, yes. "
"271720","273360"," Because I fear the plaintiff's bar."
"273840","276000"," The plaintiff's bar will come after me if I say anything to you."
"276820","279460"," There's only one guy in the world the plaintiff's bar would not mess with. "
"279460","281180"," And that man is Dwayne Johnson."
"281700","284980"," If the plaintiff's bar comes after him, he'll come right back and believe me."
"285180","285800"," They will live. "
"286140","287560"," They will rule the day."
"287920","288900"," They took on Dwayne Johnson."
"289140","289880"," Holy cow. "
"290440","291060"," I'm sorry."
"291220","292000"," I didn't even hear her."
"294060","299080"," Jim, while they get miked up, really quick on Bitcoin, you've been telling us the charts were"
"299080","301620"," prepping us for a drop now below 39k. "
"302880","306220"," This is going to be coming up to one percent down after the post TTF."
"306220","307720"," They're still trying to make a stand here."
"307820","312460"," The problem is that the value of Bitcoin went up more than $400 billion in anticipation. "
"312680","317540"," It could be a huge amount of money in, but net the actual money is like about a billion."
"317900","318900"," Very, very disciplined."
"319020","319200"," All right. "
"319360","322400"," So if you meet this again for just a couple of things, you got to go over some."
"322680","324300"," I call it a number of damages."
"324500","326480"," It was a great folk called number housekeeping stuff. "
"327180","329620"," So I will be with you here today at some point."
"330100","333440"," We have some changes coming up here."
"334300","339760"," On the format last or yesterday afternoon, more can ask me if we could consolidate. "
"340780","344000"," The bottom left hand side of your screen down here."
"344200","351220"," You know, you have the two or split level screens on the bottom of your of your viewing experience."
"351880","359060"," So I've switched to a one screener that cycles every 60 seconds. "
"360100","366340"," This morning, it's set for SPX QQQ and Tesla."
"367360","371380"," If you would prefer me to every day, you could always ask in the stream."
"372020","374020"," Start of the stream or something like that. "
"374160","378880"," You're like, Hey, this one ticker is standing out, like NVDA today is the ticker."
"379460","381060"," IWM is the ticker, whatever it is."
"381220","387480"," If you guys have suggestions for cycling through chart sale, that just flipped to the Tesla 30"
"387480","387880"," minute chart. "
"388860","391680"," So this should stay on for about a full minute for you."
"391780","395620"," They're all set to 30 minutes, but I can set them elsewhere if you like."
"396800","402020"," And we'll let's start with three tickers on this bottom side of the stream. "
"403040","405080"," If we can cycle in more, we will."
"405640","406760"," There is an issue here."
"408740","410940"," What I haven't when I have a."
"412020","414140"," Original instances of. "
"416960","418580"," Trading view running it."
"418760","422240"," It really like hammers the performance from my end."
"422520","424800"," It's working fine right now, but. "
"425720","430680"," We'll keep we'll keep looking at it and seeing the matter of the switch browsers to."
"431260","434080"," Like Google Chrome will run in the background."
"434080","437660"," I think Firefox might not run in the background. "
"438300","440560"," Like it doesn't tax resources."
"441740","442700"," So we'll see how this works."
"442880","446220"," If this slows the stream down or something like that, I'll try to switch to. "
"448280","452500"," A maybe a different browser that doesn't isn't so resource intensive."
"453560","455480"," In the background operations."
"456520","459120"," Now right now it's set to SPX Tesla. "
"459900","466660"," And QQ cues, but if you want it like to NQ or Apple or something like that, let me know."
"467980","469360"," Just trade for my phone."
"470980","472260"," Too funny. "
"474640","476980"," Anyways, these charts are down below."
"477300","481120"," It should give you a somewhat better view or a few points."
"481880","484100"," I can possibly even turn up the. "
"485140","486420"," I could turn up the."
"488720","490380"," What you see here if you want."
"491520","494720"," That way you can at least read all the numbers and stuff like that. "
"495200","495860"," I don't know."
"495920","496560"," Let me know what you think."
"498460","500340"," Let me see what this one's set to here. "
"501400","503460"," That's at 125%."
"505380","507500"," Yeah, these are all at 125%."
"507500","507940"," I think. "
"508640","509600"," Yeah, it's all at 125."
"510360","513320"," This might help you at least be able to read this stuff over here."
"514000","515880"," I can turn it up larger too. "
"516059","517140"," Just let me know what you guys want to do."
"520340","521440"," Let me see if I can."
"530790","533450"," Yeah, I think that does it right there, but I'm not sure. "
"543710","545050"," It's pretty crunchy down here."
"545110","545690"," Look at this."
"546170","547710"," It's a 30 minute chart on the Q's. "
"549570","550090"," Kind of."
"550210","550470"," I don't know."
"550570","551970"," You guys can let me know what you guys think of this. "
"553450","555590"," These are all 30 minute charts right here."
"555650","557450"," At least you can see where these clusters are."
"557870","558910"," By the way to Tesla. "
"560390","561250"," Oh man."
"562690","564470"," I don't know what to say about Tesla here."
"564690","565050"," You don't want to. "
"565770","566630"," There's loose Tesla."
"570750","572850"," You've already heard my spiel here on Tesla."
"573150","573390"," Tesla. "
"573690","575670"," We had a failed breakout yesterday in Tesla."
"576890","580670"," And there's a wall of pain coming down in Tesla right now."
"580670","583330"," Sometimes we can escape this, but. "
"584770","587970"," This stuff right here is not looking good."
"588490","589750"," If I can do that, that's better."
"591150","593750"," This is a this is a bear cluster. "
"594670","596990"," Like this bear cluster right here."
"597050","598230"," This monthly daily weekly."
"599290","600610"," It's not going to be pretty. "
"601290","604010"," We talked talked on social media about."
"604970","608130"," Wanting to see us trade that two 33 to 30."
"608350","609570"," They'll break out yesterday. "
"609990","612430"," I'm really watching this taker today."
"612810","614110"," Tesla specifically."
"615730","620610"," And it's even if it goes up, it's looking for whether this went up yesterday. "
"621150","624310"," To test this cross or today to test this cross."
"625070","628010"," Whatever rejection that is is going to be."
"629850","632350"," Can cause some real violence to the downside. "
"632570","633790"," It can get ugly."
"634630","637710"," So I'll leave this one up today because this one's looking for the biggest."
"638610","641070"," The biggest action or reaction. "
"642270","646170"," I was talking to a buddy last night about my thoughts on Tesla and."
"647910","650630"," It's right now where it's at."
"650890","653710"," It's at a place where you have to parse your words. "
"656270","660090"," Be careful as to what specific things that you say about Tesla."
"661410","664590"," Because you can get a major squeeze out of this."
"666850","669130"," But until it shows you something. "
"670550","673670"," It is setting up for some really negative news."
"673950","675250"," I don't know what that news is."
"676190","678630"," For a major downside move. "
"679110","681170"," It's really, really bearish right now."
"682390","683690"," So we'll find out."
"683850","684890"," We'll see if how this plays out. "
"685050","686430"," See if it squeezes."
"687010","691250"," What we're really looking for is that if there is a rejection above on that."
"691610","694230"," All that momentum coming down on top of Tesla right now. "
"694810","696170"," If it does not escape."
"697510","698430"," That momentum."
"699030","700170"," It's going to get ugly. "
"701410","705690"," I was looking at 165 and then I'm like, yeah, but we were already down there."
"706010","707130"," When it's that close."
"707130","712610"," I mean, sometimes you can we can validate that it's consolidation for a larger leg higher. "
"713730","715810"," But with that momentum above."
"716430","719210"," That's where the above that's raining down on Tesla."
"719950","721990"," That is where there's a problem. "
"722870","726010"," It's one thing if all that momentum on Tesla was underneath."
"727210","729410"," I would be extremely bullish."
"730370","732830"," But where that momentum is coming down on Tesla. "
"732830","736470"," There's likely something we don't know that's really negative."
"737090","741730"," Not guaranteed, but that's you want the inverse of that chart."
"742450","744450"," You want that chart flipped upside down. "
"745410","750030"," If you're going to start talking, you're going to get serious maybe about Tesla being extremely"
"750030","750570"," bullish."
"752570","757990"," If I had to guess there's going to be some news on Tesla that is not good."
"759030","762150"," If I had to guess there's something coming out that we don't know yet. "
"763890","766410"," Yeah, yeah, no, this isn't earnings related."
"766730","771310"," I don't know what it is or or it's news during earnings that we don't know that's pretty pretty"
"771310","772270"," vicious and bad."
"773870","776490"," You know, let's go back to that chart really quick. "
"776670","778210"," Look at this perspective here."
"779990","782710"," If this chart was upside down right now."
"783790","792990"," If we flip this chart here upside down, I would be telling you expect some unknown extremely good"
"792990","793890"," news for Tesla. "
"794910","798250"," You know, they would drop some unknown news that's really good."
"798690","801230"," At any rate, you can see this velocity down below at least."
"802150","803390"," Watch this velocity down here. "
"803870","807790"," You really do want like minus a minus 50 on Tesla specifically."
"808550","809690"," So we're at minus 19."
"809990","811150"," We're at minus 27 yesterday. "
"811930","815750"," So I'm still expecting that squeeze on Tesla bigger one than yesterday yesterday."
"815750","817250"," It's closed, but not like it should."
"817910","822030"," So maybe today that comes into play for Tesla. "
"824030","825330"," I'll tell you what, man."
"826030","827650"," I'm going to tell you like Tesla."
"828790","831110"," This that is not the chart that you want. "
"831650","833670"," It's not the chart that you want as a Tesla bull."
"836790","838170"," Yeah, no, I get it."
"838610","839810"," I totally get what you're saying. "
"839810","842270"," Like there's something there."
"842270","843330"," I don't know what it is."
"844950","846810"," If I was Tesla, the company. "
"848090","851670"," If I was an insider in Tesla and I had Elon's air, I would say."
"852910","855510"," Today, I'd be telling Elon, get out your worst news."
"856670","862170"," Have it ready to drop because if you needed a moment to dump some bad news, now's the time. "
"865450","866790"," Which is horrible to say."
"868470","870130"," All right, so on some other stuff here."
"871970","874050"," Let me go through to your levels here for you. "
"874490","875150"," Here's your pivot."
"878230","879830"," Here's your S1 down here."
"880190","882450"," This still this little mark down here. "
"882610","883590"," I don't know if I have that there."
"883670","884950"," So I don't think I wrote anything in there."
"885470","886250"," This is the. "
"887370","888810"," I don't know what this came from."
"888950","889850"," This is supposed to be."
"890830","892230"," Just check this really quick. "
"892450","893270"," Yeah, this is the close."
"894790","898630"," I guess S1 really does is the only thing that needs filled."
"899150","901370"," We had to fill something S1. "
"903090","908470"," And maybe the closing price on Friday, but it's just this gap shit down here."
"908550","909510"," That's one that I can see."
"910050","911570"," Only this stuff right here. "
"911970","912950"," I think that's mandatory."
"913350","914370"," This stuff back here."
"914810","916570"," And we'll talk about that later. "
"919720","920100"," What they need."
"920360","922710"," Then what they need to close that is to get underneath S2."
"922710","925930"," S2 is kind of like the danger zone. "
"926670","929130"," You don't want to see the price of spy below."
"930350","931550"," 41 38."
"935170","936350"," 41 38. "
"936550","937590"," We started racing shit."
"954580","956120"," That over here for now."
"959140","961500"," Okay, so now on to the other part of this. "
"961640","964440"," So we're coming into the 31st of January."
"965240","970340"," We are about to launch a passion project."
"970340","971840"," We've been working on for. "
"972800","975280"," I want to say at least a year, if not two."
"976860","978260"," At least a year."
"979060","981460"," We tried to launch last July. "
"981940","982300"," Oh, not July."
"982620","983320"," I think September."
"983980","986080"," September and December of last year. "
"987020","988080"," We wanted to launch."
"991940","993100"," A more."
"993980","996860"," A more sustainable version of what we do. "
"997760","998400"," And."
"1000560","1004460"," Wanting to launch that version of what that that more sustainable version."
"1005840","1009700"," We couldn't prove a way to do it cheaply. "
"1011080","1012420"," Where someone can."
"1012960","1014200"," Someone can support."
"1014480","1015740"," So right now, right?"
"1016900","1018520"," We are at a place where. "
"1019280","1021340"," We try to keep out the bots on chat."
"1021580","1022680"," It's like five bucks, right?"
"1023339","1025119"," We've got a discord that."
"1025680","1027359"," Is free and open to the public. "
"1028160","1029460"," That's not a good thing."
"1029460","1032380"," It invites all kinds of shit into discord."
"1033099","1034480"," And we need to make this more. "
"1034920","1036319"," We're doing here more sustainable."
"1036900","1041640"," And one of the issues we ran into originally was the price or cost."
"1041819","1043180"," To make that happen. "
"1043839","1045520"," And so it's taken us."
"1045859","1047140"," I want to say at this point."
"1049260","1051000"," Shoot at least since July. "
"1052040","1054440"," At least July of 2023."
"1054760","1056640"," Where we realize that."
"1058420","1059860"," We needed more done. "
"1060400","1063400"," And the development is finally coming to an end."
"1064760","1066040"," It's done."
"1066440","1068340"," We're testing right now in the background. "
"1069020","1070060"," We're at the background."
"1070100","1075520"," We're actually testing this stuff so that we can launch a sustainable version of what we do."
"1076460","1078920"," That's an entry level price of like 20 bucks. "
"1079620","1080600"," A month."
"1081380","1082600"," Which is dirt cheap."
"1083080","1084780"," We're talking about five for that. "
"1084880","1086540"," We're trying to get it down to like five bucks."
"1087180","1090820"," Figuring like five bucks for the chat and five bucks for the discord."
"1091700","1096220"," And for all the data and the cost of everything, the cheapest version that we were able to get it"
"1096220","1097100"," to is 20 bucks. "
"1097680","1099180"," So I'm pretty happy at this point."
"1099940","1102320"," There's still be like a really super free one."
"1103120","1107220"," Version where you can watch the show and that kind of stuff, but you can't get into the discord"
"1107220","1112320"," because we have to charge to keep the scammers the bots and all that shit out of there. "
"1112480","1112640"," So."
"1114720","1119620"," We're at a place though where we are attaining that goal and we're about to launch."
"1119620","1121840"," Anyways, about to launch the shit of the 31st. "
"1122240","1128120"," And as we're coming into that delivery date that deploy date."
"1129440","1137220"," There's a monster monster stack of little things that are piling up and piling up and piling up and"
"1137220","1137840"," piling up."
"1138460","1143320"," Just like absurd small small things that have to be complete for that launch. "
"1144220","1147940"," Now, I know some of you out there are going to say something like, well, we're coming into earning"
"1147940","1148280"," season."
"1148540","1150200"," I'll be I'm here in the office all day long."
"1150380","1155380"," I'll stop it at key moments, but there's always a fire is my point. "
"1155380","1164020"," There's always like there's always a, I don't know, a fed meeting or an ER season or a holiday or"
"1164020","1166780"," something to say, Hey, we need you here right now at this moment."
"1167200","1176960"," This really truly does free us from a lot of stuff and opens us up to being here all"
"1176960","1177580"," the time."
"1177980","1182220"," So we're almost there to keep bearing up be patient with us as we get closer. "
"1183000","1184040"," It's going to be super cool."
"1184640","1190760"," And we're very excited with what we're launching here that we're able to meet that need for a"
"1190760","1197800"," regular retail trader, and especially a new retail trader, which was our original hypothesis was to"
"1197800","1204420"," take care of new retail traders that need tools in their life, whether it's just a toolbox of"
"1204420","1211000"," information or toolbox of Hey, I'm going to do these setups with you repetitively until you stop"
"1211000","1216360"," becoming or stop training as a net loser at all times, that kind of stuff."
"1216560","1217020"," So whatever. "
"1217400","1219180"," Anyways, I've got more stuff."
"1219340","1219900"," I got to do this morning."
"1220380","1222700"," I got a bunch of discord stuff going on today. "
"1222760","1224480"," I had some discord yesterday."
"1224480","1228960"," I had an attorney stuff in the morning, and then I had discord stuff in the afternoon and then"
"1228960","1231560"," today I actually worked on the discord last night."
"1231560","1237240"," The debt, the main dev myself for up until two in the morning last night burn in the candle. "
"1238060","1243220"," And I'm coming right back in again this morning to do a bunch of stuff for the discord."
"1243580","1245020"," There's like all this crap I got to do."
"1245840","1251000"," So I'm hoping to be done with that stuff in the next coming days, and we're finalizing checking off"
"1251000","1256700"," some membership level stuff, making sure that you have specific ticker choices and that kind of"
"1256700","1260360"," crap for you guys on the website. "
"1260360","1263420"," So I'll be doing that all day long today."
"1264020","1267940"," Let's do this buyer stepping in on cues this morning, just like rampant, baby."
"1269620","1271400"," And what else I think that's it. "
"1271660","1273120"," So you'll see me here all day long."
"1273140","1275460"," I will stop in and pop in throughout the day."
"1276420","1278080"," And bork dude, I did what you wanted. "
"1278340","1279080"," You're out there, bork."
"1280240","1287560"," Bork's been inside a discord past couple days dropping some hammers to try to improve the stream"
"1287560","1288360"," and stuff like that."
"1288360","1290960"," So we will also be paying me to do this. "
"1291060","1292220"," Why is that so high up there?"
"1293760","1295020"," Let's see this right here."
"1295760","1296760"," What's going on there?"
"1297760","1298560"," It's too high."
"1300300","1303240"," Now, so he's making suggestions on how to improve the stream. "
"1303440","1305700"," We always like to switch it up every six months or so."
"1306220","1307220"," Try out new formats."
"1307600","1309900"," And so we're going to continue to try to make these streams better for you. "
"1311140","1311820"," All right."
"1313100","1314360"," Bless what's good morning brother."
"1314380","1314960"," How you doing?"
"1317360","1320760"," Yeah, so the issue here is this. "
"1321080","1321500"," The discord."
"1321760","1323040"," Let's talk discord really quick."
"1324100","1325940"," Someone said the discord's gotten really quiet. "
"1326220","1327680"," So the discord."
"1329240","1331340"," Part of the idea here is this."
"1332080","1337180"," The discord number one, it being open to the public where I give you an invite and you can do"
"1337180","1338240"," whatever you want with that invite. "
"1339280","1341620"," We are a financial services discord."
"1341620","1346160"," So automatically, it's not like a kid playing a video game."
"1346820","1347760"," You're a target. "
"1349300","1353620"," You are a target for a very nefarious behavior."
"1353620","1356540"," With a range of minus 13 spot five to minus 15."
"1356800","1360960"," You're like a honey pot core scammers, basically bots scammers. "
"1361280","1361800"," You name it."
"1362760","1366600"," And we have to protect you."
"1366920","1368980"," That's basically where we are. "
"1370820","1375480"," We've shaved off users and we go in and call users."
"1376080","1379080"," At one point, we're at about 3000 people on that discord."
"1379960","1383660"," And it was very active and great banging and all that kind of stuff. "
"1383960","1387500"," But there's we've come to a moment where we have to transition."
"1388160","1391120"," And keep out the scammers in the bots."
"1391500","1392220"," And how do you do that?"
"1392540","1392920"," You charge. "
"1393480","1396980"," You charge and you run everybody through a website first."
"1397660","1401860"," So instead of people just being able to click a link saying, Hey, I'm in."
"1403500","1408000"," What we do is or what we do is we run run you through our website to allow you into"
"1408000","1408840"," a safe place. "
"1408840","1412820"," So we're doing a role at some point into a new server."
"1413180","1415440"," That would be the same server, but into a new server."
"1415820","1422100"," The second part of that too is you're also going to be able to get my you'll get more of"
"1422100","1423580"," me inside of the discord. "
"1423580","1426520"," From this point, we make that role."
"1426800","1427460"," So you'll see more."
"1427660","1432220"," We're going to see you're going to see more interaction inside the discord as well. "
"1433260","1435040"," More time spent in the discord."
"1436160","1438400"," So look forward to it's going to be cool as hell."
"1438640","1440800"," And we've got some big changes coming. "
"1441000","1445880"," So now that's coming at the end of the end of the month or something like that."
"1450090","1450530"," Yeah."
"1450530","1450650"," Yeah. "
"1451390","1457350"," So I want you guys to realize that I agree with you on that one there, but like don't ever"
"1457350","1458770"," accept a message from me."
"1459030","1461110"," You shouldn't do that anywhere on Twitter either."
"1461430","1465810"," If I reach out to you on Twitter publicly and say, Hey, I'm going to reach out to you via"
"1465810","1466150"," DM. "
"1466410","1466830"," That's okay."
"1467090","1467110"," Right."
"1467330","1468750"," Find me on Twitter or something like that. "
"1469270","1470410"," Same thing on discord."
"1470610","1475510"," Have you ever seen me like talking to you directly in a route or a channel and I say, Hey,"
"1475570","1479250"," I'm going to DM you can answer those, but otherwise just breaching out that kind of stuff you"
"1479250","1479830"," should never do."
"1480950","1483390"," But the public discord are there. "
"1483550","1486510"," They're horrible, absolutely horrible."
"1487430","1488570"," They're not horrible."
"1488850","1494010"," If it's like you and a hundred of your friends or 20 of your friends doing innocuous stuff. "
"1494290","1499230"," It's really bad though with the when you start to bring in the thousands of people and any kind of"
"1499230","1499950"," free form."
"1500550","1505650"," We, as a microcosm of that is when we first started this live stream."
"1505650","1509770"," We first started by trying to chase all the Russian bots. "
"1509990","1511050"," Remember the Russian bots we had?"
"1511530","1513690"," We first started streaming for the first six months."
"1513890","1515070"," We had Russian bots everywhere."
"1516110","1522670"," The moment we charged five bucks, it was like or free or free chatting through Amazon Prime. "
"1523190","1525790"," The moment you introduced two or three steps."
"1526930","1528570"," The low hanging fruit."
"1528890","1531050"," You're getting rid of all that low hanging fruit. "
"1531850","1537050"," Or that low barrier to entry to run scams on people."
"1538430","1540610"," All right, so I'll be back with you guys in a little bit."
"1541570","1543770"," I am still we talked last week about. "
"1545630","1551510"," About the expectations for this week into the 30th and that would be where."
"1552970","1554170"," Tech trades."
"1554990","1560790"," Range bound by the dip sell the rips should be a good week for tech S&P 500 to trade"
"1560790","1564230"," sideways and slightly down into the 31st. "
"1564750","1566490"," So we'll see if that plays out."
"1566610","1569970"," I mean, this all looks extremely bullish to me and not that."
"1570710","1574390"," But I'd like to see it happen first by still trading sideways. "
"1575230","1578810"," Not producing much a little bit better action on cues."
"1579050","1581190"," It looks like it's still kind of subdued."
"1582630","1587710"," And if you guys are going to change how this looks one minute remaining, let me know at some point. "
"1587790","1589110"," Just watch just the rest of the day."
"1589610","1596290"," Let me know if you want to see a one minute chart on on this stuff or zoom out a"
"1596290","1599510"," little bit or if you prefer to see it so you can read all this stuff."
"1599510","1601950"," Let me know what your thoughts are on it as the. "
"1603350","1609290"," As the day moves on and we'll test this out and see see how to make this perfect for you."
"1610370","1611710"," Take a peek right there."
"1614180","1619060"," Gamma flip is down here on the daily trigger 4729. "
"1619820","1622140"," Test the one right here for you."
"1625140","1626600"," We should be good here for the day."
"1626800","1627420"," We'll figure out. "
"1627540","1633040"," We'll check on this later and see if this helps you guys in your day or not."
"1633840","1634860"," I'll be back later."
"1650340","1652560"," Welcome to another hour of this walk on the street. "
"1652720","1657320"," I'm Sarah Eisling with Welcome to the David Faber and bonus Jim Kramer hangs around with us."
"1657940","1661100"," How did the big interview that we've got in just a few minutes with the CEO of RTX."
"1661840","1664680"," Greg Hayes, we're live at post nine here at the New York Stock Exchange. "
"1664820","1666160"," Take a look at stocks right now."
"1666280","1666800"," No, Turkey."
"1667240","1668240"," I'm fine, man. "
"1669740","1670580"," Don't pay attention."
"1671000","1672020"," We lead China."
"1672280","1673100"," China never leads us. "
"1674660","1675760"," Not very sure."
"1676100","1677900"," They continued into yesterday."
"1678860","1680680"," I got a number of sectors green this morning. "
"1681120","1683700"," Tech and communication services are on top."
"1683900","1685320"," Energy's coming back a little bit today."
"1685740","1687900"," Just health care and utilities under pressure. "
"1688760","1690880"," We're 30 minutes here into the trading session."
"1691160","1691900"," Here are three big movers."
"1692120","1695360"," We're watching G.E. Under pressure despite better than expected numbers. "
"1695720","1697620"," There after guidance comes in a little light."
"1697620","1700300"," Shares hit a six year high just yesterday."
"1700740","1705220"," United's in the green despite news yesterday that the company expects a quarterly loss of at least"
"1705220","1709480"," 35 cents a share due to the Boeing 737 MAX 9 grounding. "
"1709840","1712380"," United has 79 of the aircraft in its fleet."
"1712700","1713320"," Just a note here."
"1713320","1716740"," Spoons has some form of a cluster here. "
"1716740","1718320"," The clock planes at all until February."
"1719120","1720420"," And then China stocks are rallying."
"1720640","1725820"," China's security regulator says it will step up an injection of capital into the markets there in"
"1725820","1729640"," an effort to stabilize the market and confidence more on that in just a moment. "
"1729640","1731360"," Actually, let's start there with China."
"1732000","1736960"," Because this had a powerful effect whether Chinese stocks were oversold going into it."
"1737120","1742120"," But the word is that they're going to spend $275 billion to prop up the stock market. "
"1742440","1743680"," You know, that was a really good point."
"1743700","1744540"," She just made there."
"1744700","1749280"," She said, you know, this is to who's point Turkey McNugget. "
"1749840","1751020"," So just here."
"1751120","1751860"," She just said right."
"1752080","1754060"," She said China's going to inject cash. "
"1754900","1756800"," Into their monetary system."
"1756980","1758160"," And she said."
"1758880","1761860"," It's not like they weren't oversold there. "
"1762220","1762660"," Anyways."
"1764320","1765940"," Key point right there."
"1766080","1768480"," It's not like they were not oversold. "
"1769060","1769480"," Anyways."
"1773220","1774560"," They should be embarrassed."
"1775260","1779640"," And they should maybe look at themselves and rethink the way that they do business. "
"1780380","1784760"," Because I think that this kind of thing, Sarah, is disgusting and disgraceful."
"1785900","1786340"," Really?"
"1786680","1787960"," Disgusting and disgraceful?"
"1788340","1789200"," Well, they came in."
"1789320","1790100"," We're treating, Sarah. "
"1790280","1793860"," Jim, but if they came in and just supported the economy in the way that many anticipates, they"
"1793860","1796860"," would endure that our federal reserve, for example, has in the past."
"1797940","1800820"," Because that's not manipulation of a giant market."
"1801260","1805580"," I think that they should offer maybe a resolution trust for apartments. "
"1805980","1810360"," Maybe they offer yes, low, do a Keynesian economic package."
"1810880","1814080"," But to point blank, say, you know what, we're going to make the market and take it higher."
"1814640","1815880"," That's not what you do. "
"1816660","1819460"," Can you imagine right now, President Biden said, let's see the stock market."
"1819800","1820680"," It's not up much."
"1820880","1821620"," We got this guy Trump. "
"1821980","1823180"," You know, he'd take the stock market up."
"1823180","1823940"," The Fed By Bonds."
"1823940","1825040"," The Fed By Bonds. "
"1825560","1829940"," Well, there was a period where we wondered whether they would one day buy stocks."
"1831040","1834000"," Jim Kramer is like, we don't want to do that in the United States."
"1834580","1835800"," But we do it all the time, brother. "
"1836700","1838320"," How about why don't they help the companies?"
"1839720","1841980"," Why don't they deal with reality?"
"1843080","1843840"," What are they doing?"
"1844400","1846360"," Do they have any that you think that's capitalism?"
"1847560","1847860"," It's not."
"1848260","1849420"," But that's so what?"
"1849960","1850000"," Okay."
"1850180","1851640"," So they're allowed to do whatever they want with stocks. "
"1852040","1853700"," Do you think they sit around right now?"
"1853820","1858080"," Do you think our chief economic advisor and yelling are sitting down saying, you know what, did"
"1858080","1858280"," she?"
"1858460","1858700"," He's down."
"1858880","1859420"," Let's get that hot."
"1859860","1860220"," Yes. "
"1860440","1860760"," Yes."

"2180190","2187130"," call well I will I was very gratified that today's all your releases in the analysts are not"
"2187130","2192230"," talking about the the problem you have with GTF which one of these ends which I think that you a"
"2192230","2197410"," lot of people are critical of you saying that you put a very low bar it's going to be worse"
"2197410","2203610"," and worse and worse in truth Greg isn't this one problem almost behind you and not nearly as bad as"
"2203610","2209290"," you thought it might be well Jim I wouldn't say it's behind us I think if you know anything about"
"2209950","2216050"," RTX and the way we approach these issues we tried to put a number out last September that we"
"2216050","2221330"," thought would more than adequately take care of this issue I was going to take us a couple of years"
"2221330","2226210"," to get through with all the inspections and to get through all of the MRO activity but what we have"
"2226210","2231010"," seen over the last few months is the shops are coming up to speed we're seeing a lot of well"
"2231010","2235950"," fewer aircraft down ground than what we had originally anticipated so we feel good there's no"
"2235950","2241590"," surprises here on GTF but still a lot of work to do and I give kudos to our airline partners"
"2241590","2247030"," who have stepped up at our working with us to try and minimize the disruption given everything else"
"2247030","2251630"," that's going out it going out on the airline market today well you know I was always hoping we"
"2251630","2255290"," could just speak commercial because Collins was such a good deal and you've made so many good deals"
"2255290","2259790"," to become such a force but we have to speak defense and I think we have to speak defense because"
"2259790","2265650"," when we do something right it tends to be one of the programs that you're involved with can you"
"2265650","2272430"," tell us the state of Ukraine and what you could do to make it so that perhaps Ukraine could do"
"2272430","2278770"," better because I think you have it within your portfolio to make it so this is not a two-year"
"2278770","2284370"," stalemate you know Jim it's it's really pretty simple what we need to do for Ukraine we need to"
"2284370","2289630"," give them additional weapons to support their air defenses you know we put the Patriot air defense"
"2289630","2295230"," system in we have put in the naysams short-range air defense we've given them stingers we've given"
"2295230","2300850"," them javelins all of the things out of out of inventory but frankly they're running out of missiles"
"2300850","2307990"," whether it's the gem tea or whether it's amram for naysams they need more munitions to counter this"
"2307990","2315530"," threat and until Congress can act and spend some more of our hard-earned money over there this"
"2315530","2319930"," conflict is not going to end and I think that's the one thing we need to as Americans think about"
"2319930","2325590"," is the Ukrainians are fighting this war for NATO and the only way they're going to prevail is if"
"2325590","2331390"," NATO and the U.S. specifically steps up to the bar and helps them fund what they need to prevent"
"2331390","2339650"," more atrocities in Ukraine for what happens well I think is as we've seen over the last year it's"
"2339650","2347110"," going to be a stalemate this is World War I trench warfare with drones and again the drones pretty"
"2347110","2351450"," effectively way the Ukrainians have employed them the Russians are starting to also employ them"
"2351450","2357910"," though so this is going to be a long bloody stalemate absent some significant infusion of"
"2357910","2363870"," additional weapons systems into the Ukrainian battle space I'm not talking about you know F-35"
"2363870","2369170"," fighters or anything strategic like that I'm just talking about air defense missiles to protect the"
"2369170","2374530"," skies to protect the people now let's talk about something that you have that if we could get more"
"2374530","2379330"," of maybe it would help a lot of countries and also help shipping talk to me about the program"
"2379330","2386730"," called coyote so coyote is a it's an interesting weapon system that was is in low rate production"
"2386730","2392370"," today it's a it's a small missile you can mount it on the back of a pickup truck or an"
"2392370","2400410"," ATV you fire it against a swarm of drones and it can take on a drone swarm either kinetically by"
"2400410","2405450"," hitting the drones or through high-powered microwaves by simply knocking them out of the air the"
"2405450","2410570"," issue with coyote again low rate production we're talking 40 going to 50 eventually 100 a month"
"2410570","2417730"," there's not enough of them and what we've seen in Yemen with the Houthis is a constant barrage of I"
"2417730","2424050"," would say low-tech weapons and you using gem teas at a million dollars a pop or using SM6s at"
"2424050","2430090"," 5 million a pop to take down 10,000 dollar drones that doesn't make any sense quickly run out of"
"2430090","2437150"," these very expensive munitions so it's up to us Raytheon technologies to ramp up the production of"
"2437150","2442770"," these and we're working very closely with the DoD to do exactly that you know one of the things I'm"
"2442770","2448450"," concerned about it did not impact you as much as it did but I think you're still having a problem"
"2448450","2453530"," finding people and still have a problem with inflation I wonder if you're the federal reserve you"
"2453530","2458050"," listen to what you're about to say and you're thinking you know what we haven't won against"
"2458050","2465830"," inflation we have not created the workers we need to keep wages down either no Jim this is this is"
"2465830","2471950"," a existential problem in aerospace and defense today is the supply chain and not find enough"
"2471950","2478330"," qualified workers to meet the demand that we're seeing you know last year we hired about 24,000"
"2478330","2484990"," people within RTX and at about 5,000 that being about 19,000 people leave we're fortunate right we"
"2484990","2489910"," paid at the very high end of the pay scale for most of these jobs these are great jobs but"
"2489910","2495550"," the fact is there is still a lot of pressure on inflation last year even example we saw 2.3"
"2495550","2501250"," billion dollars of cost growth from our supply chain and from our labor base that's about 800"
"2501250","2506750"," million more than we expected so it's not that the battle against inflation is over is I think"
"2506750","2513590"," misguided I think this idea of cutting rates when you have 3.7% unemployment is also misguided the"
"2513590","2519410"," fact is we need more participation in the workforce and we need to get wages back to a sustainable"
"2519410","2526990"," level of increase well Greg it's David how are we going to do that well I think we we have"
"2526990","2531470"," to figure out you know what happened to the 3% of the working force population that went away"
"2531470","2537170"," during covid right we were at 65 percent labor force participation we're at about 62 percent today"
"2537170","2542950"," that's a big number out of 150 million people or so on the workforce we need to find ways to"
"2542950","2548590"," get those people back to work the good news if there is good news the pandemic aid is is obviously"
"2548590","2555130"," starting to fall away I think people will rejoin the workforce the wages are good and frankly we're"
"2555130","2559210"," willing to train anybody to do any one of these jobs we've got great apprenticeship programs we've"
"2559210","2565350"," got partnerships with community colleges state and local governments we just need to get more folks"
"2565350","2573230"," back in the workforce and that is going to be a challenge Greg forgive me for this in a way"
"2573230","2577110"," and my to my viewers as well but you know I remember a conversation we had a long time ago"
"2577110","2584010"," with you here regarding a potential presidential candidate at the time his name was trump um seems"
"2584010","2588910"," very very possible at this point that he will be the president a year from now at least based on"
"2588910","2593970"," current polling and expectations I'm just curious as to what your thoughts are what a trump"
"2593970","2599830"," administration second time around would mean for for your company particularly given these theaters"
"2599830","2607750"," of war in which obviously you are one of the key suppliers you know david we at rtx we we"
"2607750","2613910"," try and keep a bipartisan mindset in all of these things because the national defense defending"
"2613910","2619470"," democracy is our mission really is a bipartisan activity we can't choose sides between democrats"
"2619470","2624550"," and republicans what I will say in a second trump administration I think we have to continue to"
"2624550","2629530"," make the case why we need to fund nato why we need to protect our allies in the south pacific"
"2629530","2634770"," and in these taiwan street and we're going to have to make that case with president trump if indeed"
"2634770","2640990"," he does come back because we cannot pull back from these relationships the taiwanese depend on us"
"2640990","2645910"," the australians the europeans everyone and i think we just have to make sure the president trump if"
"2645910","2651630"," he does become president fully understands the consequences of pulling back on some of these very"
"2651630","2657270"," very long-term strategic partnerships well it's going to be a little bit of educational need there"
"2657270","2663330"," Greg this is will be your last appearance now when president eisenhower completed his uh tremendous"
"2663330","2669610"," uh two terms he gave a speech about warning us about the military industrial complex have we now"

"2676850","2683730"," need to talk about having a complex again well look i think the fact is uh defense spending is"
"2683730","2689250"," around three percent of gdp today which is close to an all-time low and given the fact that we're"
"2689250","2693910"," in the middle of conflicts around the globe i think we're going to have to rethink what our"
"2693910","2699550"," priorities are in terms of spending um clearly you know recreating as president eisenhower said"
"2699550","2704450"," this military industrial complex is not what i'm talking about but what i am talking about is"
"2704450","2711750"," having the uh where would all to be able to have a credible deterrence to aggression and that means"

"3351650","3355850"," want to hear about money and i think that's the first thing you have to kind of get your head"
"3355850","3361090"," around and that's fine you know you can just say they're investors and i think having investors is"
"3361090","3366410"," very important and making investors money is very important and then number two is is that each one"

"3379650","3388950"," it seems like you it didn't seem like you remember that though"
"3388950","3395850"," actually i have a lot of really good stories you know about you know these activists like one funny"
"3395850","3402970"," story is activist said you know your hair could be a little better and you know you should call my"
"3402970","3410670"," hair guy and i'm like okay and then another one's like we're talking about i didn't do it yet do"

"3445110","3452710"," cry emotional seriously and i'm like it could be maybe a movie really and i think for a lot of"
"3452710","3459030"," them you know each one is different and they all require something a little different and that was"
"3459030","3463530"," a moment and that was nice and by the way that was a beautiful moment you know that you can"
"3463530","3469050"," kind of go from a hostile situation where the first call is very they all want to be tough right"
"3469050","3475350"," to the point where there's a tear in somebody's eye hey that's what you know how i am i you"
"3475350","3479090"," know i think dealing with somebody's heart is the most important thing this is the fact that we can"
"3479090","3484230"," bring more love to the activist community then i'm all for it i mean this is the story that we"
"3484230","3490390"," needed and that's only two because like the story that we saw is like six or eight activists you"

"3516350","3522310"," opportunity um you have to of course you know realize we're in one of the greatest moments of our"
"3522310","3528170"," life with ai so if you are taking a dollar in the margin you're taking an ai a dollar out"
"3528170","3532530"," of ai research so you do want to have the right balance i think those things are important by the"
"3532530","3537570"," way everybody understands that that's part of my question which is how you balance growth which has"
"3537570","3542610"," been decelerating sure and profitability sure what you're really ramping well we talked about"

"3948410","3955690"," i um i'm clear that the economy of solid uh is been doing very well um and i think one"
"3955690","3961730"," of the reasons that it is is a little bit um uh misunderstood you know if you go back through"
"3961730","3969670"," many cycles uh cycles are created out of exosupply creating a phone and then a bus in 90 we had"

"3989210","3996790"," get back to going you don't have an inherent excess of fiber demand therefore the economy doesn't"
"3996790","4003550"," have to contract in order to allow you know demand to catch up with supplies so i think if you"
"4003550","4009430"," move underneath all of that which you see is a good solid foundation uh there certainly are a few"
"4009430","4015450"," little pockets but underline the strength is strong and will continue we mentioned your your"
"4015450","4020930"," optimism regarding financials how much of that is going to be a yield curve normalization and how"

"4034270","4043270"," come capital markets mortgage income all of that will rebound materially as rates normalize which i"
"4043270","4050730"," fully believe they are on the cusp of doing and so from a banking sector point of view uh you're"
"4050730","4057950"," likely to see something like this all in 2000 if you recall back in 2000 with the tech bubble uh"
"4057950","4065210"," you know from 2000 2024 they had phones dropped from 5.3 to 1 percent banks uh went up by"
"4065210","4072630"," 90 percent while the now's over going down 46 percent so this market is set up in my view uh"
"4072630","4078270"," very positively for banks and overall very positively for the economy and i'm sitting generally for"
"4078270","4084950"," the stock market there are some uh areas in the stock market that are a bit exuberant uh and"
"4084950","4089010"," that'll have to be watched out but i don't think it's going to be enough to create a catastrophe in"
"4089010","4094350"," the market uh Kelly's david favor on curious as to why you don't share some investors concerns"
"4094350","4101670"," about commercial real estate exposure particularly office and particularly at regional banks uh"
"4101670","4106210"," given uh you know the need for so many of these owners to refinance at levels that are simply going"
"4106210","4111729"," to be untenable for them hence the banks may end up with the real estate why not a concern or"
"4111729","4115890"," if it is a concern why not perhaps rise does it not rise to a level that would impact your"
"4115890","4124310"," overall view here right it is a concern but it is uh a control concern david uh there's a lot"
"4124310","4129430"," of misunderstanding about the exposure in real estate and then the exposure in real estate in"
"4129430","4136450"," banking first of all the real issue in real estate is in large commercial office buildings that's"
"4136450","4140850"," by the way not because of an excess blood of the dramatic reduction in demand which is slowly"
"4140850","4146510"," coming back some multifamily but look here's the thing that you need to take into account when you"
"4146510","4152710"," think about banks when i first started in banking in 1972 most of the long business country were"
"4152710","4158710"," held by banks on their balance sheets that has changed dramatically now a huge portion of the long"
"4158710","4165350"," especially large loans may be originated by a bank that they end up in the shadow banking system so"
"4165350","4170990"," when you look at the average small bank regular banks and even the very largest banks uh you don't"
"4170990","4177910"," find huge concentrations of very large office complex buildings they're often syndications and it's"
"4177910","4183590"," problematic for the aggregate economy but it's not it's specifically problematic for for the bank"
"4183590","4188910"," so i didn't worry about that but i think it's going to be vulnerable because it's so dispersed"
"4188910","4195330"," outside of the banking system launching kelly finally i got to follow up and ask where you think"
"4195330","4202490"," the potential is for maybe irrational exuberance in the market we've seen some forecasts lately"
"4202490","4207750"," about what for example the forward p e of info tech and communication services might do in the"
"4207750","4214310"," years ahead we'll call on i'm a bit conservative but i've been a banker for 50 years so i guess"
"4214310","4223110"," i'm allowed that but but no look i think there are pockets of irrational exuberance lumen you get"
"4223110","4229310"," when you get some of these companies selling at 40 50 60 70 80 times earnings people don't"
"4229310","4233670"," understand what that means if you pay 50 times earnings that means it's where they become the 50"
"4233670","4242430"," years to earn back that that stock price and so it's it's it's it's it's irrational because what"
"4242430","4249650"," now is happening my own opinion is people are super excited about generating the i which is which"
"4249650","4255470"," is good but it's overstated there's a common belief running around now that AI is going to change"
"4255470","4259610"," the whole world and it's going to do it tomorrow that's not going to happen in my view it is"
"4259610","4265770"," important it's reversing you up in a factor it is not going to do even beings and it will be"
"4265770","4271370"," additive it will increase productivity but it's not going to change the world well we try to be"
"4271370","4276950"," disciplined about giving viewers occasional gut checks on those on those multiples kelly it's great"
"4276950","4281090"," to chat again hope it happens more often great to see you thank you thanks great to see you have"
"4281090","4288190"," a great day well shows of 3m as you can see right there are down sharply this morning this after"
"4288190","4294910"," there was a revenue miss and chairman and CEO mike roman is going to join us to break down the"
"4294910","4490350"," numbers and the guidance in particular that also seems to be giving investors calls 3m"
"4490350","4495590"," shares falling sharply after a q4 earnings beat revenue miss though as well the company forecasting"
"4495590","4500270"," full year profits below analyst estimates on flowing demand amid higher rates and inflation"
"4500270","4505290"," chairman and CEO mike roman joins us now for cm dc exclusive interview mike it's good to have you"
"4505290","4510670"," yeah good morning sarah thank you for having me on today good morning so what happened here it"
"4510670","4516110"," looks like so the organic revenue growth was a miss and the guidance looks like some were saying"
"4516110","4522190"," was conservative or light what are you telling investors yeah i would say sarah there's a lot of"
"4522190","4528430"," discussion about the outlook for 2024 i would i would start with how we finished out 23 we had a"
"4528430","4534770"," strong delivery of our q4 we improved our operational performance that showed up in our results we"
"4534770","4542450"," had EPS said beat our guidance and and beat consensus we had another quarter of very strong cash"
"4542450","4547530"," flow double digit growth in the quarter and our revenue in the quarter was in line with what we had"
"4547530","4553030"," guided the total year similarly we executed well we delivered on commitments we exceeded our"
"4553030","4559710"," guidance for EPS and cash flow delivered 30 percent increase in cash for example reduced our debt"
"4559710","4566890"," by two billion dollars so strong performance and we carry that momentum into 2024 and as we look at"
"4566890","4572810"," 24 we expect to build on that another year of strong growth in margins and we will grow earnings we"
"4572810","4579470"," will drive robust cash flow and we'll see improving organic growth the discussion was around how"
"4579470","4586130"," that organic growth guidance that we have for the year one to three percent excluding some"
"4586130","4591290"," portfolio actions which is an important priority for us so it's uh i would say we're building on"
"4591290","4596370"," our momentum and we do expect a successful 2024 well it is a little messy and you reference this"
"4596370","4600770"," because you are spinning off the health care business right and that's going to be factored into"
"4600770","4606630"," the outlook in 2024 you have these big settlements coming when it comes to all of the legal issues"
"4606630","4612450"," so how much of that is incorporated in here and if you strip that out what does it tell us"
"4612450","4618630"," yeah and you're highlighting we have we have three priorities we've been focused on relentlessly as"
"4618630","4622730"," we came through this year and we'll carry those into the new year it's driving performance that"
"4622730","4627010"," i've been talking about it's progressing on the spin with health care and we're on track to spin"
"4627010","4632790"," out our health care business in the first half of 24 and importantly to continue to make progress"
"4632790","4637210"," on reducing risk and uncertainty related to legal matters and we've announced two settlements that"
"4637210","4642830"," we're also focused on taking to final approval one of them here in early February another one later"
"4642830","4649970"," in March so those are those are part of our priorities as we come into 24 in our guidance we"
"4649970","4657450"," guided for 3m as the whole goal if you will with health care as part of 3m and that helped"
"4657450","4665010"," us we we think it helps us show that continued improvement in how we're executing showing our"
"4665010","4670450"," margin improvement we we talked about 75 to 100 basis points of margin improvement as we come into"
"4670450","4677570"," 24 again driving growth in eps and improving revenue growth so we we did guide it as a whole co"
"4677570","4684130"," the timing of the spin has an impact on how you would separate the two companies it's not you can't"
"4684130","4689730"," just subtract health care from 3m there's other factors you have to consider we spent a lot of time"
"4689730","4695010"," with analysts trying to help them walk through that so that that does make it complicated but it's"
"4695010","4699910"," really a reflection on the things that we know are creating value those three priorities so focused"
"4699910","4703750"," on those as we come into the new year and then as for growth Mike is it just that that"
"4703750","4710530"," some of your end markets the consumer products and electronics and industrials are weaker than the"
"4710530","4718050"," broader economy what are you seeing there yeah as we start 2024 I would say q1 looks a lot like"
"4718050","4724250"," q4 q4 we you know we talked about some of the dynamics we were seeing we had some strength in"
"4724250","4730290"," our industrial businesses mixed in our industrial business in the u.s. and notably we had a strong"
"4730290","4738890"," automotive OEM business in the quarter we had soft demand in China and in consumer retail we saw"
"4738890","4744210"," stabilizing in consumer electronics something that we had seen a you know a negative growth in as"
"4744210","4750130"," we went through much of 2023 so as we come into first quarter and we look at that we see"
"4750130","4754310"," a lot of those dynamics continue the automotive does flatten out the build rates are expected to"
"4754310","4761050"," you know sequentially flatten out we're you know we continue to see softness in China and the"
"4761050","4766830"," retail markets in the product categories that we play in retail where we have products in you know"
"4766830","4771230"," discretionary product category so we you know we carry that in that's how we're looking at the year"
"4771230","4775630"," there is an expectation that the macro improves as we go through the year and that certain end"
"4775630","4779970"," markets will improve but I would say we're you know starting out the year with a view of q1 similar"
"4779970","4787910"," to q4 but Mike as you said earlier and it's David you expect 2024 to be a good year your"
"4787910","4793890"," investors seem to have a different view of what good means I'm kind of curious as to how you would"
"4793890","4799290"," explain the deviation here I mean you've got more than a 10% loss in your market value this morning"
"4799290","4804470"," that being said the stock had moved up sharp into this earnings but still you're good and they're"
"4804470","4810530"," good don't seem to be the same thing yeah I would say the focus David as we've been talking about"
"4810530","4816550"," is on the guide for 24 and and growth is part of that and that impacts what you deliver and"
"4816550","4823190"," in margins and EPS and the EPS was certainly a topic as well so I I believe that we are"
"4823190","4828610"," you know we'll grow those we'll we'll drive that execution and we'll grow as we go into 2024 and as"
"4828610","4833890"," the markets improve we'll take advantage of it and deliver and leverage that for greater growth"
"4833890","4839750"," into our into our results so I I do believe we'll continue to make progress and and build off that"
"4839750","4847090"," momentum deliver growth the markets reacting to the overall outlook for 2024 and and we'll you know"
"4847090","4851970"," we'll see how it plays out through the year again we're starting with confidence in our ability to"
"4851970","4857710"," execute and drive that that improving bottom line and and cash flow yeah well to your point the"
"4857710","4863530"," guidance perhaps below what what many investors had anticipated you do seem to be more positive"
"4863530","4866510"," perhaps in the second half of the year again I don't want to put words in your mouth but I"
"4866510","4872670"," think you're basically heard you say that and I'm curious as to why well I would say the macro"

"5368740","5375020"," on inflation being transitory the the rate was zero at for half that 13 year period and i think it"

"5383180","5390020"," adrenaline they're stimulative low rates and i think that the rates were artificially low which"
"5390020","5398620"," meant that the economy and the markets were artificially stimulated and after 13 years of that"
"5398620","5403760"," people start to say well that's normal that's the way it's always going to be my belief is that"

"5419340","5425400"," worth less than they would in a low rate environment and and the economy will not be as stimulated"
"5425400","5431540"," so where we are right now with these i would say higher rates you would say elevated well higher"
"5431540","5436300"," higher just not high just not high you know i mean today is where we're going to settle no i"

"5464140","5470200"," more normal so you know i believe that over the next 10 years the fed funds rate currently five and"
"5470200","5477560"," a quarter five and a half will average somewhere between let's say three and three and a half three"
"5477560","5482220"," and three and a half yeah where where do you think the neutral real rate is is it is it"

"8767930","8775350"," blue and spirit it is a shame because spirit had a great deal with frontier much better aligned"
"8775350","8781650"," their cultures they're all it would have been such a better deal but your owners and the board"
"8781650","8788630"," decided to go with the more lucrative slash more risky deal and so that is a shame the laws clinton"
"8788630","8793570"," act and that's the exact wording of that what i'll be is due for some updating i'm not a lawyer"
"8793570","8798770"," but your point is exact it's like you know these two coming together would have been a more of an"

"8804890","8809150"," losing all that your niche for customers i think that's more impactful than to the general consumer"

"8914550","8921710"," technology part of this trade is going to continue to build additional momentum to me that's not"
"8921710","8925470"," necessarily a positive because what you're seeing right now is you're surely seeing a barbell"
"8925470","8930730"," impact you're seeing investors go back to the things that they feel most safe in that they're"
"8930730","8935130"," looking at these companies able to continue to grow their earnings when a sizable part of the"
"8935130","8940410"," market that hasn't participated in last year's rally where we should be allocating capital maybe"
"8940410","8945890"," not as firmly in the camp of being able to grow their earnings and so i think it's almost a"
"8945890","8950930"," little bit of a risk off trade in my in my mind in terms of what do you expect for"
"8950930","8955050"," the broadening out of the market and are you going to get that well to me just seems like a"
"8955050","8960090"," continuation last couple days i mean the rustle was up almost two percent yesterday so your your"
"8960090","8967510"," points well taken for the majority of the beginning of this this year we're it's still young last"
"8967510","8973450"," couple days though not you know today not withstanding last couple days you have had a return to to"
"8973450","8978930"," some of this broadening but on the idea that the market is just people are just too exuberant right"
"8978930","8985170"," now we we mentioned what Edgar Denny had written to his clients in in the last 24 to 48 hours"
"8985170","8990470"," or so talking about this exuberant melt up days i want you to listen to what Cheryl Young told me"
"8990470","8995710"," yesterday joe on closing bell she of the Rockefeller global family office she's a private advisor"
"8995710","9000950"," she also happens to be in the barons hall of fame in terms of wealth advisors here's what she told"
"9000950","9007690"," me she's positive but listen I think the market is priced to perfection right now i mean we just"
"9007690","9013110"," hit all time pies today which is exciting to be on the show today i'm a little worried and the"
"9013110","9017150"," last few shows i've been on Scott i was very bullish i was doubling down on tech the last time"
"9017150","9021990"," we spoke in october and valuations are a little bit stretched so things are priced to perfection"
"9021990","9030830"," pretty um you know interesting view from a well-known wealth manager and highly regarded one what"
"9030830","9036190"," do you think of what I do know, Cheryl, well, I've worked with Cheryl in the past."
"9036570","9041110"," Cheryl has been incredibly accurate in her assessment of the market over the last several years."
"9042250","9048130"," So what she spoke about yesterday with you is utilizing the options market to hedge out some of the"
"9048130","9049210"," risks that she's seeing mark place. "
"9049210","9051690"," Well, she's been writing covered calls against her musicians to do that."
"9051810","9056450"," But on her broad view, stick with me, on her broad view that the market is priced to perfection."
"9056790","9057410"," Do you agree or not?"
"9058130","9064470"," The difficult answer to that, Scott, is when you say the market, I'm having difficulty"
"9064470","9067830"," understanding what specific market we're talking about, okay?"
"9068190","9070590"," If we're talking about the stock market?"
"9070710","9071450"," Well, no, no, no. "
"9071730","9074190"," Because right now you have complete buy-for-get."
"9074470","9075110"," Let me finish."
"9076050","9079630"," You have complete bifurcation in terms of performance. "
"9080030","9083110"," So you have to be careful when you say we're talking about the market."
"9083290","9085230"," We began the show talking about this broadening out."
"9085230","9087130"," Yesterday, the rustle was up 2%. "
"9087130","9088270"," Where's the rustle today?"
"9088710","9090650"," There should have been followed through today."
"9091230","9091770"," There was not."
"9091950","9094270"," So no, I don't think there is exuberance. "
"9095170","9097670"," I think there's exuberance as it relates to equity."
"9097850","9103750"," I think there's exuberance surrounding monetary policy got me wound up surrounding monetary policy,"
"9103750","9104290"," okay?"
"9105230","9112630"," Because the exuberance surrounding monetary policy is expecting disinversion of the yield curve."
"9113170","9114830"," It is expecting lower yields. "
"9115210","9117010"," And you're not getting that right now."
"9117430","9123150"," So Cheryl is correct that the market is priced for perfection."
"9123670","9128110"," If you believe that you're going to get disinversion, if you believe that yields are going to move"
"9128110","9128310"," lower. "
"9128410","9132130"," Scott, if you don't get that, then the market doesn't belong here where it is."
"9132230","9132730"," It's going lower."
"9132950","9133150"," Okay. "
"9133430","9135310"," So Howard Marks, right?"
"9135970","9141190"," Oak Tree's Howard Marks, a legend in terms of looking at the markets and trying to decide where"
"9141190","9141950"," we're going from here."
"9142010","9144730"," Talked about this as well within the last hour or so."
"9145850","9147410"," You want second here, gang?"
"9147690","9148810"," I got to stop in briefly. "
"9148810","9151330"," Have you believe by virtue of the fact that we are."
"9151470","9155090"," I got a set up a scene here really quick."
"9155090","9158910"," I'm just going to cut away briefly from the screen that you're looking at. "
"9161270","9163010"," And put something up here."
"9163070","9163790"," Give me one quick second."
"9164030","9164190"," Okay. "

"9175210","9179190"," I'm going to go to this screen right here, I think. "
"9179870","9180770"," Let's see here."
"9182230","9185030"," I'm going to exit that right there."
"9186390","9187910"," I'm going to go home right there. "
"9191850","9200570"," Give me one quick second here."

"9219430","9220390"," Primary monitor."
"9224770","9225250"," Nope."
"9225890","9226250"," Nope. "
"9228550","9229830"," That's kind of it."
"9230390","9231870"," That's one quick second here."

"9248910","9249410"," Right there that works."
"9256970","9258730"," I think that works right there."
"9258830","9259010"," Okay. "

"9261110","9261670"," Sorry about that."
"9261870","9262710"," I apologize for all that."
"9267510","9268690"," You guys can hear me out there. "
"9268910","9269070"," Okay."
"9270250","9276270"," At 12.15, a trader podcast is going to show up to the show to give a market update."
"9277250","9281830"," And as soon as I get him on here, we'll flip over to him and have him on for you"
"9281830","9282050"," guys. "
"9288390","9289890"," So it's not all that expensive."
"9290170","9294430"," But what I don't think we can say here just to be clear is that there's some trap door that's"
"9294430","9299070"," going to open up underneath the market the way it did in 2004 technology stocks or the way it did"
"9299070","9299810"," in 2022."
"9300490","9301570"," Let's be clear too. "
"9302270","9310610"," As bullish as you obviously are, sure, and have been, you're only looking for a 5% gain on the"

"9326830","9332130"," It's going to turn this off here and see if I can get trader podcast on here. "
"9332230","9332870"," Maybe slightly early."
"9332870","9333490"," Hold on here."
"9336230","9337410"," Let's see what we can do here. "

"9360630","9362670"," Watch this chart that I've got down here, right?"
"9363730","9366630"," I think you might be wondering why we look at the half hours."
"9367630","9370570"," The stock market trades on the hour. "
"9371210","9374690"," And the hour begins at on the 30 minutes."
"9374690","9375830"," Not on the zero."
"9376130","9379830"," So whenever you talk talking about stock market, you always want to be thinking about. "
"9381550","9386190"," Those are everything about an hour basis and what happens at the start of each hour."
"9387230","9390990"," So right here you've got 11, the 11 30 hour, right?"
"9391650","9394370"," So 11 30 was the beginning of an hour, right?"
"9394370","9398770"," Then you've got the 11 or 12 p.m. to 12 30 hour."
"9399190","9400930"," It's important in this candle. "

"9448750","9450530"," I don't know if it's like a."
"9452950","9454830"," Like why don't I call it X?"
"9455610","9460570"," It's almost like just begging me to call it X, but I don't."
"9465080","9466640"," So we'll see if we can get him in here. "
"9469000","9470740"," He can join us here in just a moment."
"9474040","9476620"," Yeah, keep your eye on that 30 minute chart on the cues."
"9478920","9482660"," And you want to be watching that second half hour candle fulfill that hour. "
"9484200","9489320"," You want to see the strength of buyers and sellers if it's more, if it's bearish, if it's bullish"
"9489320","9490180"," or if it's neutral."
"9504750","9506070"," Yeah, it won't be an interview."
"9507290","9509390"," Tension during this interview or during this interview. "
"9509770","9513370"," Yeah, you guys, if you're out there listening right now, what you want to do is."
"9514410","9515590"," There's a few things here."
"9515930","9519130"," If you're going to if you're going to ask a question of somebody on the stream. "
"9520730","9522550"," A big part of that would be."
"9523430","9525070"," Is it important, right?"
"9525730","9526690"," So a good question."
"9526870","9527230"," Someone asks. "
"9527530","9529690"," So Momo is asking about Netflix, right?"
"9529690","9530930"," They have an ER coming up."
"9531670","9533150"," You want to ask those questions."
"9533410","9539350"," If you're asking a question about a ticker that's following the market, you may not get that"
"9539350","9540530"," question answered. "
"9541670","9546670"," Oh, when you're asking someone questions, it's always good for there to either be a market to"
"9546670","9553150"," events coming up on that ticker or that ticker is trading against the general markets."
"9554030","9558290"," Normally you'll get an edge on the market that way and it's something unusual that someone can"
"9558290","9558950"," answer for you."
"9560270","9563390"," Yeah, Trader podcast is watching the chat right now. "
"9563410","9566330"," By the way, Trader podcast, I did send you a link to your DM."
"9566530","9568310"," If you want to pop on right now, we can do some."
"9569610","9571870"," I want to make I want to make sure this looks good on the screen. "
"9571870","9575150"," So if you got a chance to pop in before we put people on."
"9577570","9578450"," Oh, you are on?"
"9578570","9579150"," I don't see here."
"9580830","9584390"," I thought I sent you an invitation, but I don't see you as you see. "
"9585610","9586870"," Yeah, I don't see you in the meeting."
"9588390","9589290"," Did you already join?"
"9589910","9590630"," There you go."
"9591570","9591990"," All right. "
"9592070","9592890"," Don't say anything yet."
"9593050","9593590"," Trader podcast."

"9602980","9604120"," Anyone quick second here."
"9609400","9610480"," Hey, Trader podcast."
"9610760","9613040"," Can you just give a mic check to say check one two or something?"
"9613540","9614360"," Check one two. "
"9614420","9615040"," Check one two."
"9616700","9617320"," All right."
"9617320","9618740"," So I've got you muted right now. "
"9618920","9619380"," Oh, hold on a second."
"9619460","9620660"," I'm going to mute my microphone as well."
"9623740","9699960"," All right,"
"9700080","9700180"," gang. "
"9700380","9702940"," So this is Trader podcast joining us live here."
"9702940","9704440"," He's going to give you a market update."
"9704500","9706640"," If you don't know who he is, name is Trader podcast. "
"9707280","9709560"," We've had him on the show and prior prior."
"9712120","9715120"," Prior streams and he is a friend of the show."
"9715140","9716640"," So please be kind to him. "
"9716640","9718800"," He's going to review the market with you."
"9719060","9722260"," And if he has time, he'll also go over some."
"9723520","9725200"," Other tickers possibly for you. "
"9725260","9729120"," So I know some of you guys are wondering about an ER for Netflix at the end of today."
"9729120","9731620"," We're going to add him into the stream here right now."
"9731920","9732600"," You had a podcast. "
"9732900","9733520"," Say what you want to say."
"9733960","9734920"," Hey, hey, everybody."
"9735100","9735540"," Good afternoon. "
"9736900","9740780"," Hope nobody's isn't too much money on this theta day as I see it."
"9741200","9744300"," There was an opportunity to get out to your MSC buys."
"9745000","9750380"," If you bought them yesterday at four p.m. and the MSC number came out to be more than one"
"9750380","9750960"," billion on the. "
"9751480","9754560"," On the sell side, you can kind of see there was like that peak and then."
"9755040","9756080"," You know, we just saw."
"9757660","9761360"," Actually, before I do that, let me explain what I'm doing right now. "
"9762060","9767800"," So what we're looking at is live options flow on the S&P 500 complex."
"9768360","9768860"," All right."
"9769740","9772620"," Now the green line is zero DTE calls. "
"9772980","9774320"," The orange line is all calls."
"9775040","9779840"," The dark blue line that you see over here is all."
"9780560","9784080"," Exbury puts and the light blue line is all. "
"9784840","9786140"," Zero DTE puts."
"9786600","9788400"," So what are we seeing right now?"
"9788740","9794780"," As we look at this snapshot, what we are seeing right now is that there is about seven hundred and"
"9794780","9796580"," sixty million dollars worth of."
"9796900","9799880"," Call zero DTE call delta that came in today. "
"9800540","9806640"," We're also seeing about eight hundred and sixty eight million dollars worth of all."
"9806760","9808620"," Exbury delta that came in today."
"9809820","9813620"," Now, if you subtract the two together from from each other, but. "
"9813900","9820140"," A hundred dated hundred million dollars worth of delta is not dated for today on the call side."
"9820140","9821760"," On the put side."
"9822020","9823320"," This is what's really interesting. "
"9823820","9829600"," We're seeing that today's price action has primarily been driven by zero DTE puts."
"9830260","9836320"," Now, what's happening here is that we've had about six hundred and forty three million dollars"
"9836320","9838780"," worth of zero DTE put delta."
"9839460","9846760"," But if you look at the dark blue line that says positive eight hundred sorry positive eight point"
"9846760","9847640"," one nine million. "
"9848260","9855100"," So what that is telling me that even though there is put buying for today driving today's action"
"9855100","9864040"," longer term outside of today's expiry puts are actually net sold to the tune of six hundred and"
"9864040","9868060"," fifty eight million dollars worth of delta."
"9868060","9874000"," I don't know if that's probably like about the same in premium because most of this stuff is you"
"9874000","9879260"," know closer to being point seven point eight delta at the money puts."
"9879620","9885740"," So anyways, this is what's really really interesting to me is that right now what we're seeing is"
"9885740","9894600"," your DTE puts driving the the flow of the show right now and you know, but longer term puts are"
"9894600","9895100"," the market. "
"9895100","9898040"," The dealers are next short put."
"9898220","9901720"," So that's kind of supportive just looking at the snapshot."
"9902380","9904540"," So there's a couple of other things we could look at. "
"9904720","9906600"," We could look at the implied volatility."
"9907540","9915060"," So what this is, let me go to today's strike where we are right now, which is for around the"
"9915060","9917340"," forty eight fifty spot level."
"9917340","9924140"," And so what this is, this is what's called a fixed strike matrix and the fixed strike matrix. "
"9925580","9933720"," Kind of shows you what the implied volatility for that strike and expiry combination is at any"
"9933720","9934620"," given point of time."
"9935580","9940880"," So what we're seeing right now is that all of this is red."
"9941120","9951100"," All of this red means that the implied volatility at these strikes for these is lower"
"9951100","9958760"," than what it was for what the average volatility was for that combination for the last sixty days. "
"9959320","9965860"," So right now this is one, this is one point zero two ninth z score negative z score."
"9965960","9972220"," So which means it's about one standard deviation away from what the volatility was on a sixty day"
"9972220","9972820"," look back."
"9972820","9982460"," So generally when you see a lot of low volatility means there are dealers out there that are happy"
"9982460","9985440"," to sell puts into this price action. "
"9985800","9993280"," Now when they're selling puts for a particular strike combination, they think they'll actually make"
"9993280","9998340"," money, even though IV is so low right now they still think they will make money on this."
"9998340","10000660"," So this is what's called systematic underwriting."
"10001200","10004340"," And what we're seeing right now is a lot of underwriters for tomorrow. "
"10004920","10011200"," So they don't think the market is going to go like that level based on just looking at this fixed"
"10011200","10012060"," strike matrix."
"10012660","10019220"," What is interesting is this second of February line that you see that's all green."
"10019220","10028880"," Now if you think what could be the reason we have the FOMC speech coming up, we have"
"10028880","10036320"," PCE coming up, which generally lies in this general thirty first to second region. "
"10036920","10040780"," Longer dated as you look, they're selling like down here."
"10041140","10043180"," They're happily selling puts down here."
"10043180","10052300"," Basically means that if you're trying to buy like an April 30th expiry 4850 put it is"
"10052300","10059580"," the implied volatility on that is two standard deviations lower than what it has been historically"
"10059580","10061220"," in the last 60 days. "
"10061220","10069180"," So looking at this, what I showed earlier, and then let's look at the IV term structure."
"10069220","10070540"," Let's add yesterday."
"10071180","10074220"," And let's add last Friday. "
"10075020","10081120"," So the key line is today's term structure of IV going out."
"10081120","10089920"," And as you can kind of see, we are slightly elevated for the 26th than what we were like on"
"10089920","10099400"," last Friday, but generally longer term IV on SPX complex, which includes spy XSF"
"10099400","10102540"," and ES features."
"10103160","10109520"," All of those like the IV on all of that is lower than where it was last Friday. "
"10110060","10111420"," So the gold line is higher."
"10111980","10118800"," And this gray cone, the bluish gray cone that you're seeing on your screen, that is the range of"
"10118800","10127740"," the 90th to the 10th percentile of what the term structure has been in for the last 60 days."
"10127740","10137020"," So again, very technical, but what this is like really telling us right now is that IV is going"
"10137020","10139340"," lower across all strikes. "
"10140120","10144300"," And when that happens, that basically means there is no fear in the market."
"10144300","10151280"," They don't expect us to turn around and gap down one or two percent overnight."
"10151880","10153260"," That's not what's expected. "
"10153260","10157120"," The market's not thinking that there's anything that could do that."
"10158080","10164740"," So that's kind of like what the general market snapshot is like."
"10165680","10169160"," There's another thing we could kind of look at just within this chart. "
"10170840","10176980"," What we saw is now puts are starting to get like monetize this year."
"10177160","10186680"," You see how this line in general kind of like goes up and to the right, it's not the flattish"
"10186680","10187780"," or slightly uptrend."
"10188580","10195240"," So that tells me that there isn't too much fear in the market just for today. "
"10195240","10197420"," We have an auction at one o'clock."
"10197740","10199740"," So this will be really interesting to see."
"10200160","10206940"," And I think we're starting to see a little role in the market because we're probably going to see"
"10206940","10208220"," like let's see TLT. "
"10209040","10213580"," Sorry, Dixie, Dixie is up on a resistance line that I have right now."
"10214060","10215700"," But Dixie has been fairly bullish."
"10216040","10221900"," Now, if Dixie is bullish, that's not great for the indices. "
"10221900","10230960"," So this happens quite a bit to me, but with the trigger, you can kind of see that we're going"
"10230960","10240120"," back trying to retest this 48292 level that we had on the hourly trigger."
"10240620","10242040"," So maybe we're going to go do that."
"10242740","10247620"," But generally, from the options market perspective, now we see some more security. "
"10247940","10248320"," But it's coming."
"10248520","10252900"," We're seeing some calls getting sold off getting monetized or sold off."
"10253460","10261340"," But this is all kind of leading into that one o'clock where we are selling two year two year"
"10261340","10262020"," trajectories. "
"10262600","10267560"," And we can look at what's happening with the two year right here in anticipation."
"10268430","10277340"," The two year has been rising all day since bottoming at around one 30 in the one 30 in the"
"10277340","10277600"," morning."
"10278200","10279940"," It's been kind of going up steadily. "
"10280260","10280420"," So."
"10281300","10288640"," It still hasn't broken our previous highs yet at four point four one nine."
"10289140","10293100"," So we're kind of like, you know, everybody's kind of waiting what happens with this auction. "
"10293100","10299980"," I remember a bad auction with a fat tail probably is not great for the indices."
"10300820","10306980"," And when you're talking about indices, the thing that I would be really concerned about is what"
"10306980","10309020"," happens to IWM."
"10309680","10317380"," So I have this big fat supply zone that IWM has been, you know, kind of pushing into this zone"
"10317380","10320120"," actually goes back months. "
"10322300","10328940"," So we've kind of yeah, this goes back to December of 2021."
"10329720","10334840"," So this has kind of been a fat, you know, supply zone slash resistance."
"10335860","10341940"," We broke over it earlier in the year, but since then we've kind of come back and, you know, like"
"10341940","10343320"," dipped back into the zone. "
"10343320","10352880"," So I am, I am keeping an eye on IWM as a possible short if the treasuries auctions"
"10352880","10353800"," don't go well."
"10354100","10363740"," Right now, I'm not super bearish IWM or anything, like from an unwind and general moving"
"10363740","10370520"," pieces perspective, I would expect IWM to be one of the leaders."
"10370520","10376000"," I think CAP has talked about that a fair bit to like IWM has room to run. "
"10376600","10383620"," We've never had the case where spy has had an all time high, the queues have had an all time"
"10383620","10389140"," high and the IWM, the small, small stocks."
"10389760","10394460"," So I'm eating caps have been in a bear market and they've been still in a bear market."
"10394660","10396860"," So I think this has room to run. "
"10398360","10403200"," I have an opinion on how I would like to play it."
"10403320","10410200"," I would like to see a breakout of this like big fat supply zone before a retest and I'll buy"
"10410200","10410880"," that retest."
"10410880","10413980"," If we're, if everything looks constructive, that's what I would do. "
"10414420","10422660"," But right now, this is the, this is the ticker, which is going to be fairly, fairly"
"10422660","10426760"," sensitive to rate movements."
"10426760","10430000"," So two o'clock auction, we'll keep an eye on it."
"10430240","10432240"," If I'm still on, sorry, one o'clock auction. "
"10432420","10433700"," If I'm still on, we'll keep an eye on it."
"10433740","10434460"," We'll see what happens."
"10435200","10441920"," So with that being said, this is kind of, you know, SPX in general. "
"10441940","10447760"," If there's anything in particular that you guys want me to look at."
"10447760","10454800"," And as somebody had, okay, I see somebody's asking about FTNT Fortnite, I think, and somebody's"
"10454800","10455660"," asking about Netflix."
"10456000","10459680"," So I can look those up and I can show you like what I'm seeing on, on the spot gamma. "
"10460780","10464680"," And general like thoughts are and how the chart looks."
"10464900","10465840"," So let's look at Netflix."
"10468720","10470540"," So this looks like a."
"10472540","10475620"," This is bearish positioning today in Netflix. "
"10476360","10482700"," So what I'm seeing right here is that, you know, there's not really a lot of calls that came in"
"10482700","10483000"," today."
"10483700","10483940"," Right."
"10483940","10491140"," And we've seen like more weekly puts about 21.64 million in zero in weekly put delta. "
"10491420","10492200"," So that's next experts."
"10492380","10493100"," So that's Friday's expert."
"10493620","10499880"," And about 36.49 million overall in put delta being applied today. "
"10500820","10506620"," Now there's like, there's just as we are talking, there's a little bit of a kink in these lines."
"10506620","10510660"," So somebody just put in some weekly calls so we can kind of see that."
"10512960","10522660"," But we can look at Netflix and just look at where all the"
"10522660","10525320"," options reside. "
"10525940","10526140"," Wow."
"10526940","10528820"," That's an interesting looking chart, guys."
"10529480","10530520"," Let me turn this off. "
"10530820","10531260"," Is this by?"
"10531260","10536590"," Oh, that's why I was like, why does it look like this?"
"10537870","10539090"," What's going on here?"
"10539510","10539830"," Let's go."
"10540290","10540430"," Okay."
"10541110","10543010"," And this is still a very interesting looking chart. "
"10544650","10546930"," So let me pull this up."
"10550750","10560550"," So Netflix right now, it kind of got some support around 483 ish, sorry, 481.5 ish and"
"10560550","10562790"," it's kind of like, you know, doing a V shape recovery."
"10563710","10567790"," If you follow the trigger, you know, it's going and testing the hourly trigger. "
"10568550","10573990"," There has been a bearish cross on the 30 minute and the five minute."
"10573990","10577350"," Let's see if it like holes and kind of like slingshots up."
"10577350","10578650"," You guys know that system. "
"10578650","10587030"," So I'm not going to like go into like that right now because I'm not as good as cap and"
"10587030","10588730"," probably some of you as you guys do this."
"10589010","10591570"," So, but let's go look at this."
"10591710","10592150"," What's interesting. "
"10592470","10595490"," So right now Netflix is trading at 486 60."
"10596210","10602070"," So this is where all do you see this big, let me make this bigger because you guys can see"
"10602070","10602470"," that clear."
"10602470","10606490"," So what 500 do you guys see that big stick. "
"10606890","10611050"," That's all the call gamut that is in there."
"10611190","10619950"," That means there's a fair amount of calls that are concentrated on 500 level."
"10620930","10628950"," What we're also seeing is there is a nice buildup of calls up here with some puts in the money"
"10628950","10634490"," puts having are also present at higher strikes and 500. "
"10635170","10636250"," Now that's really important."
"10636550","10644170"," If you're bullish, you kind of want to see like more calls above what I would call the call wall"
"10644170","10644710"," at 500."
"10646610","10652030"," So when I'm seeing this, I'm kind of like liking that you know 510 has good gamma 520 has good"
"10652030","10656490"," gamma 550 has good gamma and in the middle, it's not a lot of like empty notes. "
"10657250","10663730"," Of course, 490 has good gamma 495 has good gamma, but then you see all of this puts down there"
"10663730","10664070"," too."
"10664390","10667990"," Now, one of the cool things is like you see these lines that are coming down."
"10668720","10672790"," These are basically think about think about it as a ramps. "
"10673690","10681050"," So the steeper the ramp, the steeper the more attractive force in that direction, the"
"10681050","10685730"," price action will have."
"10685730","10686690"," Right."
"10687010","10688830"," So we're about 486. "
"10689310","10691630"," So we're right about here at 485."
"10691950","10699250"," But as we get higher, let's say we get to like 490 today before earnings, which you see is then"
"10699250","10702050"," there is more calls that are in the money."
"10702050","10706130"," So there and more puts out of the money. "
"10706190","10710390"," So there's like a lot of Vanna feel that comes from puts losing values."
"10710670","10718830"," So dealers can you know, like buy back the soul shares that they that they sold when they sold the"
"10718830","10719050"," puts."
"10719410","10721210"," So, you know, that's called Vanna. "
"10721330","10725010"," That's like a tailwind to equities because dealers are buying back those shares that they had sold."
"10725010","10732630"," So you see that this, the orange line gets steeper, the more two words, you know, higher strikes"
"10732630","10733010"," 525."
"10733310","10738690"," So from here from just eyeballing in from 490 to 500. "
"10739470","10741110"," That's a pretty steep drop off."
"10741570","10747770"," So that basically means that the call gamma gets stronger and stronger and we see like a higher"
"10747770","10751170"," preponderance to go towards higher strikes."
"10751930","10761850"," Similarly, if you look over here the steepest part is right about here from 485 to about 477. "
"10763250","10765790"," So, but then you'll kind of see the rate."
"10766310","10771890"," The slope of this line is like lower, which means there's not a lot."
"10772090","10776530"," That's going to like push it very fast down downwards. "
"10776670","10778770"," Now, this is very important when you come up on ER."
"10778770","10784070"," This is like if you see a structure like this, that's when you start like thinking about, Oh,"
"10784190","10787950"," what's the move going to be like if the move is upward, right?"
"10789250","10793590"," Dealers can start selling those puts and they have to start hedging the calls that they have sold."
"10793670","10794570"," So they have to keep buying. "
"10794990","10801270"," And that's why you get those like 30 40% pop offs like because they just have I'm not saying"
"10801270","10806570"," that's going to happen, but this is the kind of setup that you see where the dealers have sold a"
"10806570","10811810"," bunch of puts because you know, like, they just there, but they have sold a bunch of calls as well."
"10812950","10815650"," And the ER is better than expected."
"10817710","10822370"," And what's been priced in and dealers have to start, you know, covering the shares. "
"10823110","10830030"," And, and, and that's what like leads the steeper this line is the bigger the bounce is in."
"10830850","10832990"," After hours, that's something to like kind of like think about."
"10833070","10836870"," So this is what that looks like, but let's also look at. "
"10837210","10842370"," Okay, so there's really no risk of reversal based on options positioning right now."
"10842610","10846870"," And what we can look at here is how the experts have gone."
"10847350","10856310"," So currently, you know, almost an equal amount of puts and calls are going to expire on Netflix on"
"10856310","10857090"," Friday. "
"10857090","10861910"," So, but if you're thinking weekly, there's no edge there to play."
"10862650","10867030"," And the, but the options implied move as it is right now is about $13."
"10868570","10869710"," So, yeah. "
"10870890","10872050"," Yeah, Turkey McNugget."
"10872190","10873450"," Oh, it's just, I just saw your message."
"10873570","10874790"," Yes, I did buy a meta puts. "
"10875010","10877410"," I closed them this morning for 20%."
"10880390","10882770"," So I closed my position today."
"10888950","10893250"," What else there was Ford in it, somebody had asked, I don't know if it's on hero. "
"10893550","10896910"," So I don't know if I have a life floor or not."
"10896970","10899370"," FT and FT and T."
"10899570","10901790"," No, it's not on here, but we can still look at."
"10904110","10908350"," FT and T on how the options positioning is done. "
"10908910","10910030"," What is it trading at?"
"10910270","10911090"," Cause that's always helpful."
"10913550","10914590"," 63 92."
"10915130","10918530"," That's a big move overnight to have earnings or something. "
"10918750","10919350"," What happened there."
"10924070","10924470"," Hmm."
"10925330","10925850"," Interesting. "
"10926770","10931910"," I'll have to look into that, but let's look at what price has been like."
"10932030","10933250"," So there's a call wall at 65."
"10934330","10935030"," Straight up. "
"10935530","10940290"," So that's, you have to be kind of, you know, careful of that prices around 64 bucks right now."
"10940690","10941870"," There's, there's like."
"10943130","10947030"," There's a fair amount of people who will, who will be looking to. "
"10953130","10957350"," People, like as it gets closer to 65, they'll be looking to like, you know, sell off their calls."
"10958570","10960890"," Let's look at it this way."
"10964960","10965280"," Yeah. "
"10965620","10972490"," So this concerns me when it comes to Fortinet, just because."
"10973090","10975310"," So it's trading at 64 bucks, right?"
"10975730","10977190"," And you see this big stick right here."
"10977430","10977810"," That's the. "
"10981050","10987570"," That's your call wall, but then you also have this right here with 60, which is like, also has a"
"10987570","10989110"," lot of calls, but it also has a lot of puts."
"10989310","10990330"," And I think that is a."
"10991350","10992070"," What is that?"
"10992210","10995150"," It's a key delta strike and put wall is all the way down there at 50."
"10995450","10996770"," So that doesn't really matter. "
"10996990","10999810"," But what this tells me that these, these are like."
"11000550","11004170"," Fairly big, like almost twice as big as the stuff in the middle."
"11004450","11005550"," So that forms a node. "
"11006110","11006970"," So these are nodes."
"11007530","11008610"," And this is going to be a valley."
"11008870","11010110"," So I don't think. "
"11011070","11015590"," Like there is a good risk and reward in going higher than 65."
"11015610","11016950"," If I was an options trader."
"11017970","11018490"," Right. "
"11018490","11023450"," I also don't think there is good value right now going under 60."
"11023450","11024150"," Under 50."
"11025970","11026870"," Yeah, under 60. "
"11027150","11032730"," So what I was, I would think is that it's kind of like chop in this area in this middle."
"11034350","11037090"," Just from the options perspective, it might not do that."
"11037390","11039190"," Just kind of need to think about it. "
"11039970","11040270"," And."
"11042230","11042710"," Yeah."
"11044490","11047070"," And even if it like shoots past 65. "
"11047070","11053230"," If it gets to close to 70, I would start seeing like I would anticipate just because there's like"
"11053230","11057630"," almost like no calls in above 65 and 70."
"11057630","11060090"," There's like just a little bit of gamma here."
"11060870","11061290"," That. "
"11062310","11064430"," That means it would be like a, like."
"11065290","11068970"," A squeeze squeeze and a fade as stuff gets monetized."
"11069450","11069810"," So. "
"11071510","11074570"," That's kind of what I would think about Fortnite."
"11077630","11080230"," M S analyst, I guess."
"11081210","11083050"," I don't know what that means. "
"11083670","11086490"," Explain gamma in terms of bull bear."
"11087370","11088410"," Well, gamma is gamma."
"11088990","11095790"," Gamma is the best way to think about that is it is the stickiness to price action based on options"
"11095790","11098370"," because you like dealers buy and sell options right. "
"11099030","11103230"," And you and I as traders buy and sell options if, you know."
"11104890","11105370"," Why."
"11106310","11109330"," Oh, why Fortnite is up to the I see what you meant by that. "
"11114790","11115890"," So, let me."
"11116230","11119870"," A better way to think about that is like gamma in the market."
"11122250","11125310"," If there's more gamma in the market, it is very sticky. "
"11125910","11129570"," It means that going up is harder going down is harder."
"11129570","11136810"," And the probably the best performing trades are like, you know, selling options."
"11137810","11143690"," Because then you can like kind of like sell a straddle or a strangle a few days out and collect"
"11143690","11144430"," data on it. "
"11145650","11147650"," In a negative gamma market."
"11148990","11152890"," What happens is that dealers have to chase the trend."
"11154430","11157490"," Right, they have to chase the trend up or down. "
"11158280","11160750"," So it leads to range expansion."
"11162970","11164590"," So, in a negative."
"11165410","11166310"," Gamma environment. "
"11167910","11173190"," You want to, if you were, if you're, if you're a vault seller, if you're an option seller."
"11173790","11178170"," What you want to do is like kind of be able to pick a direction or you sell."
"11179630","11181930"," You know, something like. "
"11183110","11189590"," Like condors or something where the bet is that the price is not going to move too much."
"11190150","11193270"," And you like bet against that essentially by selling that kind of."
"11194330","11195290"," Option strategy. "
"11196110","11198050"," So the best way."
"11199470","11205970"," There's better ways is like mechanical ways is, you know, like the calculus definition of what"
"11205970","11206910"," gamma is."
"11207490","11211050"," But I, I think the best way to think about that is. "
"11213830","11218990"," Getting from somewhere, if you to know, like if you're a positive gamma gamma environment market or"
"11218990","11219470"," a negative."
"11220190","11221750"," Gamma environment in the market."
"11221910","11227570"," I think that's more important than understanding exactly how gamma works, how it decays over time. "
"11228110","11233050"," It's not inherently bullish or bearish, but it kind of tells you like how much freedom."
"11233050","11239810"," A ticker has to move or ticker or a market has to move in one direction or the other."
"11241430","11246530"," So hope that kind of explains your ASML. "
"11247290","11247750"," Yes."
"11248110","11248290"," Okay."
"11248670","11249570"," Yeah, I got you, bro. "
"11251090","11254890"," I think it's really funny that the."
"11255570","11255850"," Wow."
"11256150","11257710"," So that's straight up. "
"11257890","11258290"," Look at that."
"11258590","11259570"," It's weekly called buying."
"11260460","11265410"," You guys see that like those green lines that's there's about like $20 million worth of. "
"11265730","11269550"," Call bill to that got to put in for tomorrow's expiry."
"11269930","11272550"," I'm sorry, sorry for Friday's expiry and."
"11273850","11282310"," They've sold puts for this expiry, but somebody's bought puts longer data than this Friday. "
"11282310","11283430"," So that."
"11284890","11289570"," That looks like hedging behavior where they are selling, you know, calendar."
"11290450","11293210"," What were there somebody's engaging in calendar puts. "
"11294190","11297330"," Like that's what the structure looks like in the market where you're short."
"11299270","11300410"," Puts on the."
"11301830","11306010"," The near side because of heightened IV and longer data you're buying. "
"11307070","11310030"," You know, puts like maybe for like next week because IV is less."
"11310310","11313650"," So you're just benefiting off of the put."
"11315850","11317390"," You know, the IV on puts. "
"11317590","11318910"," You're just collecting that."
"11319210","11324330"," So just heads up there starting for up to just make sure checking on the YouTube chat."
"11324330","11326050"," It looks like they're asking a bunch of questions as well. "
"11326690","11328710"," I don't have the YouTube chat."
"11328930","11329450"," I'll get it to you."
"11329810","11330470"," I'll get you a link. "
"11332490","11333250"," Keep doing your thing."
"11333370","11334210"," Fair podcast doing great."
"11334350","11335450"," By the way, sorry to interrupt your flow. "
"11336110","11336750"," No worries."
"11337230","11340830"," I am just let me put this up here so I can see those."
"11349710","11351070"," Just one second there gang. "
"11351230","11352110"," Make sure he's still here."
"11353370","11356390"," I might have lost him here briefly, but he should be back up in just a moment."
"11359650","11364950"," Okay, we'll switch back to the main screen until he pops back in and wait for trader podcast to"
"11364950","11365610"," come back to us. "
"11368390","11369890"," Looks like we lost him here for just a moment."
"11370090","11372170"," As soon as he comes back, we'll bring him right back to the show."
"11373170","11377030"," If you have some questions from the from youtubers here, I'm going to see if I can bring them up"
"11377030","11377730"," here in the background. "
"11380150","11382490"," See what some of those questions the youtubers had were."
"11388630","11389510"," Hey, trader podcast."
"11389870","11391210"," I'm bringing you back on here and right now. "
"11391590","11392690"," Yeah, sorry about that."
"11392810","11393310"," No, no worries."
"11393310","11393430"," Okay. "
"11393750","11396910"," I don't see your screen at the moment."
"11397570","11398950"," Oh, there you go."
"11399090","11399230"," Yep. "
"11399370","11400270"," Yeah, switch back over."
"11401890","11402790"," Top screen."
"11403310","11403370"," Right. "
"11403890","11404650"," Actually, we move this."
"11405470","11407390"," Maybe just one quick second here."
"11408710","11409910"," Move this out of the way. "
"11413330","11414310"," Going to."
"11417340","11419320"," We have here right there."
"11420740","11422340"," Okay, so you're back up and running again. "
"11422420","11422860"," Say something."
"11424060","11424800"," You hear me?"
"11424860","11425220"," Can you hear me?"
"11425420","11425940"," You're good to go."
"11426440","11427160"," Oh, perfect. "
"11427420","11427580"," All right."
"11427800","11428600"," I'm sorry about that guys."
"11428800","11431100"," I did something wrong. "
"11431640","11435240"," Anyways, ladies, this is a smell that kind of looks."
"11435740","11441360"," You know, bullish from just today's options positioning, but let's go and look at it for."
"11446080","11447100"," Okay, so. "
"11450390","11451170"," That's really interesting."
"11451170","11455370"," There is not that much call or put gamma."
"11456870","11459930"," Where like in this, because these colors are very light. "
"11460170","11461430"," That's what that kind of indicates."
"11462210","11464730"," But the number of options being traded on it is pretty high."
"11465110","11468690"," So let's go look at where we are on ASML. "
"11469150","11469590"," ASML."
"11470130","11470770"," Where does it trade?"
"11477700","11478120"," Hey, Cap."
"11478340","11480240"," I can see that in your screen, by the way. "
"11480520","11480660"," Yeah."
"11480940","11483200"," I'm going to list off some questions from YouTube for you."
"11483700","11484280"," Oh, perfect. "
"11484540","11484980"," Thank you so much."
"11488420","11489380"," So ASML."
"11491080","11492740"," You know, it's kind of interesting. "
"11493140","11496320"," So this is a different indicator of that I use as well."
"11496600","11499140"," I use it in conjunction with the trigger."
"11499680","11506260"," It's kind of helps me see what price action is like where like the pivots lay and whatnot. "
"11506640","11509020"," You know, where's chances to buy the day."
"11509360","11513380"," And if the trigger agrees with it, you know, like it's a good place to like."
"11513980","11514700"," To buy. "
"11514920","11520020"," So right now what I'm seeing with ASML, they're kind of keeping it tight in a range."
"11520500","11521840"," They're not letting it slip."
"11522220","11525620"," The bulls kind of stepped in like right off of the open. "
"11526180","11529340"," But the bears are also saying, okay, you're going to like stay in this."
"11529940","11534960"," This little range that we've carved out the maximum, you know, range that you've been trading in"
"11534960","11537420"," for the last 35 days."
"11538600","11541700"," So, yeah, this, this looks interesting. "
"11541700","11546440"," It kind of looks like, you know, one day, two day, you know, kind of like eating away at that"
"11546440","11546800"," level."
"11547060","11548480"," But there's a binary event."
"11549260","11550580"," There is an ER. "
"11550980","11552560"," So we have to be cognizant of that."
"11552960","11554660"," So price at 771."
"11555940","11556840"," Right now. "
"11557180","11558940"," And let's turn these off."
"11559580","11564700"," So there is definitely a lot of calls at 800."
"11564700","11569520"," And there is also, is that a call wall as well?"
"11569980","11571060"," Call wall is at 800. "
"11571720","11573680"," So that's your big first resistance."
"11574140","11580620"," But that's interesting is also there's, you know, a lot of gamma at 850 as well."
"11580880","11586740"," And you know, it's not as much as the one at 800, but it's certainly more than what's at 790. "
"11587180","11591860"," So that you want to see above a call wall, you want to see like, as I said before, a"
"11591860","11594160"," good strong amount of gamma up there."
"11594520","11596920"," But they're on as many in the money puts."
"11597540","11600880"," So that means there's not that much rocket fuel to go up. "
"11602080","11605080"," So the way this is set up right now."
"11605660","11610220"," And this is also, I'm going to say another thing, which is kind of very important to keep in mind."
"11611020","11613240"," The way this is set up at 800. "
"11614780","11618200"," And it is set up at 850."
"11621160","11624100"," This makes me think that the market is expecting."
"11625960","11631160"," A bumper ER, like a really, really, really good ER. "
"11631860","11637500"," Where they're going to blow expectations and guide higher and, you know, like basically say that we"
"11637500","11639400"," are the next coming of Jesus or something like that."
"11639720","11641420"," That's what that kind of looks like to me."
"11641420","11651290"," If that does not happen, the MMS are very, very likely to take this all"
"11651290","11651910"," the way back. "
"11652290","11654070"," And where would they take this all the way back?"
"11654330","11655170"," Remember, we're at 770."
"11657920","11658940"," That's a big strike."
"11659380","11661080"," The next big strike is 750. "
"11661680","11664480"," So that's like a $20 drop."
"11665180","11668040"," Not a stock like this that trades at 750 bucks."
"11668040","11669980"," Or $20 drop is like what?"
"11670180","11671180"," Like just over 2%. "
"11671180","11672140"," That doesn't really matter."
"11672500","11673660"," But that's what's really interesting."
"11673840","11675860"," But then you see, start seeing over here like 720. "
"11676300","11677580"," That's a lot of put gamma."
"11677920","11681800"," That suddenly becomes more magnetic and suddenly the lower it falls."
"11682120","11685620"," You see there's all this blue stuff, this blue gamma. "
"11686120","11690680"," It starts increasing and you see like this slope gets steeper and steeper."
"11690680","11696160"," So right now where it is priced, just looking at this."
"11697740","11700020"," Complex, this options complex. "
"11700440","11703140"," What I am seeing is a high."
"11704060","11708500"," Like high expectations in the market towards ER."
"11709840","11712940"," Because people want to monetize the up end. "
"11713520","11715460"," And even on the bottom."
"11715880","11717660"," The puts there's not that much."
"11717660","11720160"," So that's kind of really, really interesting to me. "
"11720160","11723120"," And right now it's just sticking to that 770 bar."
"11723720","11726160"," So, you know, 800 to the upside."
"11726720","11727540"," That's where I would expect. "
"11729560","11734240"," You know, a lot of profit taking unless it just blows past it in ER."
"11734520","11737260"," And then you kind of like, Oh, okay, how far does it go?"
"11737440","11740600"," But remember this between 800 and 850."
"11741420","11743120"," There's like not that much in there. "
"11743260","11745680"," So, you know, if it shoots up."
"11746460","11751920"," It's going to be a grind up and then probably like monetization and you start coming back again or"
"11751920","11759180"," rolling your positions, which takes away this inherent like call delta call gamma structure that's"
"11759180","11759360"," there."
"11759660","11762080"," The stickiness, the supportedness kind of goes away. "
"11762640","11766520"," So you can kind of see here, like in the orange line slope."
"11766520","11774620"," It kind of like is the steepest, like between like 775 and 800."
"11775360","11776800"," And then it kind of flattens up. "
"11777280","11778940"," So going up is going to be harder."
"11779680","11787480"," Whereas if you start going to like, you know, if you get a 760, this blue line starts getting"
"11787480","11788500"," steeper and steeper."
"11788700","11794440"," So between 750 and 717 is the steepest where this blue line is. "
"11794440","11799880"," So that's something like I really think about the expectation that high based on just the"
"11799880","11800160"," structure."
"11800400","11801200"," That's what that tells me."
"11801980","11807840"," And if you look at its fixed strike matrix for this next expiration, you see it's lit up like a"
"11807840","11808120"," green. "
"11809380","11812440"," Like, I don't know, like green lantern something."
"11812820","11817000"," And what that's basically telling me, and if you look like it's greener towards the upside, right?"
"11817560","11818840"," That means people are reaching for calls."
"11819420","11820520"," That's what that really means. "
"11820660","11821740"," And how much higher is that?"
"11822560","11823780"," Eight standard deviations."
"11824740","11825780"," Let's just look at 800."
"11826280","11826760"," 800. "
"11827400","11830820"," The Z score is 8.170. So 800."
"11831140","11833740"," So eight standard deviations above where it's been."
"11834240","11836640"," So that's really, really interesting. "
"11837080","11840660"," If you really think about it, you know, like people are reaching for calls and dealers don't want"
"11840660","11841800"," to sell them calls right now."
"11843300","11845200"," And they're charging more for their calls."
"11845460","11846760"," That's why Ivy increases, right?"
"11846880","11846920"," Right. "
"11847180","11852620"," Spot Ivy increases because at that price, the dealers hedging is going to be more expensive."
"11853240","11857240"," If price goes up that way, or if like a lot of people want to buy that, the dealer is"
"11857240","11863000"," just like, man, this means I have to go buy shares right now from like dark pools or from the"
"11863000","11863340"," market."
"11863340","11867700"," And I need to like, if I'm selling this call, I need to have that as hedging. "
"11868340","11870080"," And this is, you know, however many delta."
"11870660","11874220"," And that means I have to buy these many shares and it's expensive."
"11874740","11880740"," I'm going to charge more for selling this call and to offset some of my extra costs. "
"11880780","11884840"," So that's why you can see volatility to the upside rise."
"11885680","11887020"," I hope that makes sense."
"11888180","11891160"," Please in the chat, if you're listening, say something. "
"11895420","11898920"," I know I always like, I'm always like, say something in the chat, please."
"11900540","11901720"," Blow up the chat, please."
"11902620","11903060"," Right. "
"11905620","11907240"," Let's look at Roku, please."
"11907560","11908640"," Somebody said that on Twitter."
"11909140","11909260"," So. "
"11911420","11912660"," Yeah, let's look at Roku."
"11913100","11915500"," I just opened up the chat box inside of the."
"11916440","11917480"," On the screen here. "
"11917500","11919940"," I'm going to try to post it somewhere or push it somewhere that."
"11920860","11924360"," It could be seen here on the right hand side of the screen for you so you can see those"
"11924360","11924880"," these guys."
"11925500","11926020"," All right. "
"11926160","11928600"," So this is a YouTube chat that you just put up there."
"11928940","11933140"," I'm going to try to, I'm going to refresh the chat right now and see if I can get the"
"11933140","11935120"," YouTube questions on here for you."
"11935220","11936520"," You prefer the chat. "
"11937120","11938780"," On the left or right hand side."
"11938880","11940420"," Any preference doesn't matter."
"11940660","11941960"," I think you're right there where you had it. "
"11942100","11942660"," I think that's better."
"11942660","11943400"," Down there that'll work."
"11943760","11947980"," Yeah, I think that works because I can kind of keep an eye on what I'm seeing. "
"11948200","11949540"," Oh, look, look at that guys."
"11949540","11951020"," Oh, there's calls coming in."
"11952320","11956960"," It's your DTE calls coming in the overlap between orange and green lines means this is. "
"11957220","11958080"," We're about to record."
"11958580","11960160"," We're pretty close to having a squeeze here."
"11960220","11961100"," A giant fucking squeeze. "
"11961600","11961920"," Yeah."
"11962280","11968080"," The one that pulls one, they half hour the past hour and a half on cues spy might not produce"
"11968080","11972720"," as much as cues, but cues should explode to the upside right now."
"11973020","11975380"," So I go ahead and say, man, I think so. "
"11975580","11976740"," I do want to highlight a trade."
"11976900","11978540"," Since I have you here, cap, look at this."
"11979720","11982600"," Somebody is buying VXX calls. "
"11983460","11985340"," Oh, weeklies."
"11986880","11988320"," Look at that, dude."
"11989240","11990140"," Well, look at that right now. "
"11990140","11992700"," It's like 70 million in Delta on VXX."
"11994360","12000900"," So somebody is betting that volatility is about to rip."
"12002320","12008840"," And they bought at 1110 and they just bought at 1249. "
"12009680","12012760"," We're here testing the half hour trigger right now on spy."
"12014300","12015060"," Yeah."
"12015300","12016280"," Cues look gorgeous. "
"12016600","12019800"," I don't think spies going to produce like cues does."
"12020520","12022620"," Look at this term structure, man."
"12022820","12024180"," Like, look at this term structure there. "
"12024740","12030240"," The 4900 calls are getting expensive for today."
"12032520","12033760"," Dude, it's funny."
"12034260","12036180"," We can get the fix ripping, dude. "
"12036280","12036640"," We go up."
"12036780","12039040"," We blast higher outside of our expected range."
"12039620","12042020"," Yeah, the expected range today is 56 DPS. "
"12042500","12042840"," Nice."
"12043640","12045740"," So it's not even that it's very tight."
"12046020","12046820"," We're in positive gamma. "
"12046820","12047680"," That's what you expect."
"12047700","12049440"," We expect a slow grind up or down."
"12049500","12051520"," Slow grind, dude, slow grind. "
"12052000","12053940"," Because the dealers will be opposite."
"12054960","12060540"," So blood in markets, if that VXX calls play, that's not what somebody is expecting, but not good."
"12060900","12061560"," I don't think so. "
"12062600","12064660"," Let me check something really quick."
"12064960","12065220"," I will."
"12067100","12069300"," I will find out what it is. "
"12069400","12070900"," And I will share that on the screen."
"12071100","12071820"," Just give me a second."
"12076710","12077650"," All right. "
"12077950","12079250"," So 1110."
"12079510","12080610"," Not necessarily circuit."
"12080930","12081950"," Not necessarily. "
"12082310","12088270"," You can get the VIX running, man, or even VXX running if we trade anywhere outside of expected."
"12088850","12090150"," That's not bored down."
"12091230","12097390"," So that was somebody who bought one 26 14 strike calls. "
"12098750","12103330"," And paid $165,000 in premium on the VXX."
"12104610","12105690"," At 1110."
"12105970","12107110"," This bike right here. "
"12107950","12109290"," That was somebody buying."
"12113330","12115330"," There was somebody buying 14 C's."
"12115730","12116850"," So in the money calls. "
"12118010","12118970"," For one week."
"12120650","12124970"," So that to me is that some and they're pro and given that it's weekly."
"12125730","12127110"," They're going to cash out soon. "
"12127110","12130050"," So they might, they're expecting a pop in volatility."
"12130330","12131390"," They did not go out of the money."
"12131590","12132430"," They stayed in the money. "
"12133230","12135750"," And then they, you know, kind of."
"12137130","12140870"," They bought, they paid $165,000 in premium."
"12141610","12144910"," To apply at that point, 5.82 million. "
"12145510","12148970"," Yeah, it doesn't look that great."
"12149310","12152330"," So now there's, you know, the other thing too is there's no bottom here."
"12152430","12157570"," I'm looking at it right now and I'm not seeing like, I see the, I see the bloodbath and VXX. "
"12157990","12158970"," Let me see 1130."
"12159850","12160370"," Yeah."
"12160950","12162750"," That looks like a blind trait. "
"12162990","12167470"," Well, that looks like they were trying to buy the dip on, on a bounce on the previous low."
"12168150","12168550"," Yeah."
"12169010","12170210"," I think so that. "
"12170270","12170470"," 11."
"12171490","12172010"," Yeah."
"12172270","12174610"," So 1110 was like down here. "
"12174970","12179350"," They were looking for a bounce right on the previous low on Jan on Jan 11."
"12179630","12179710"," But."
"12180930","12182570"," Well, I mean, yeah. "
"12184970","12186010"," I'm not too concerned."
"12186650","12187630"," I'm not too concerned."
"12188190","12188290"," Yeah. "
"12188410","12192550"," I mean, like if I have the, I have the trigger up now, like, thank you for sharing that with"
"12192550","12192730"," me."
"12192830","12199470"," So for, for sharing this, uh, uh, but yeah, that, that, that looks like a really nasty downtrend,"
"12200010","12205070"," uh, on VXX, you know, and, and, you know, look at this guy's like, you see that?"
"12205250","12208910"," Well, look, there's somebody might be buying that previous low, right?"
"12209350","12209410"," Yeah."
"12209950","12210370"," Look at this. "
"12210370","12211690"," It's, it's all red."
"12212110","12215550"," And if it's all red, that means put selling is happening."
"12216190","12216290"," Right. "
"12216690","12220430"," We look at the hero indicator, uh, for the S and P complex."
"12220910","12226830"," Look at those blue lines that going up, you know, we've sold $430 million worth of put Delta."
"12227550","12228150"," Today. "
"12229210","12235910"," All, all experts, but we, uh, we bought the market has bought 400 million of zero dollars."
"12235910","12236570"," And you're already put Delta."
"12237230","12244130"," But so that means like the, the, the, the dealer, um, is still making money because they're selling"
"12244130","12247430"," longer-dated puts more longer-dated puts than shorter-dated ones, you know?"
"12247610","12252430"," So, um, they don't expect the market to go down because they wouldn't be selling your puts if they"
"12252430","12253490"," expect the market to go down. "
"12254430","12257610"," So, you know, that's what they mean by like, ball drying up right now."
"12257970","12261470"," Ball is, is very, very well supplied in the market."
"12262190","12263210"," Somebody asked for Roku. "
"12263210","12266170"," So on Twitter, I am getting you Roku."
"12270930","12274210"," Yeah, so that's pretty negative delta today."
"12276850","12283570"," Dealers are short calls and market is long puts. "
"12285950","12292250"," So I don't see anything there, but let's look at its structure."
"12292250","12299470"," I just posted someone just got annihilated long VIX or VXX thing I'm playing."
"12304410","12305250"," Oh, man. "
"12305930","12306250"," Good."
"12306470","12306590"," Sorry."
"12306710","12307090"," I'll be quiet. "
"12307470","12308490"," Oh, no, no, it's cool."
"12308770","12309970"," I'm happy you're here."
"12310150","12310390"," All right. "
"12310590","12311610"," So let's look at the put call."
"12312550","12315230"," We have a call wall at 100."
"12315230","12317850"," Where is Roku trading right now?"
"12320530","12323310"," Roku is trading at 89. "
"12323310","12324050"," All right."
"12324190","12325070"," So that kind of gives us."
"12325270","12329530"," So we're like right, we're like right here. "
"12330710","12334230"," Let me make this bigger so you guys can see it a little bit better."
"12337050","12343850"," And we are like right here at the 90 area, lots of calls, lots of calls at 94."
"12346010","12347390"," Lots of calls at 100. "
"12348110","12348770"," That's good."
"12349190","12350370"," That's good for a slingshot."
"12350370","12356170"," You see the steepness from like 90 to like 100 is like it's pretty steep. "
"12356730","12361710"," So there's a good chance price goes out that way, but at the same time you start looking at on"
"12361710","12366550"," the put side, you're not going to see much traction because there's a big hedge wall."
"12366730","12370250"," There's like lots of puts like right here, but there's a fair amount of call gamut."
"12370330","12374310"," So that's acting, that's going to act as the bounce area. "
"12374510","12375730"," And that's right under two."
"12375830","12376350"," That's at 85."
"12378850","12386750"," So 85 would need to break for a bigger like downside move on Roku right now. "
"12387410","12391870"," What the market is selling given like how it's like priced at 89 bucks."
"12392390","12396250"," And what we just saw in hero, that's that's just neutral."
"12396510","12398550"," That just seems like there's a lot of calls up here. "
"12398610","12402650"," So they just, you know, there's an expectation of let's look at a fixed rate."
"12402650","12404050"," Yeah, man, like look at that."
"12404230","12404910"," Like everything above. "
"12405850","12410990"," Like for the 16th and everything like, you know, like the, it's, it's people are reaching for"
"12410990","12411210"," calls."
"12411370","12411830"," So they're expensive."
"12412370","12414650"," People are also reaching, but so they're expensive too. "
"12415010","12423270"," Well, what's more expensive is let's see, let's see, right under spot is 2.7, 2.176 and 2.313."
"12424170","12427450"," So calls are a little bit more expensive than foots right now."
"12427450","12430650"," So that should actually tell us on the volatility skier too."
"12430650","12432110"," Just a heads up here too. "
"12432270","12436330"," We've got a four trigger bull cluster with a back test, successful back test."
"12436450","12437810"," We should rip faces off here."
"12438850","12439750"," On SDX. "
"12440670","12441830"," On a SPY."
"12442770","12445870"," We had one earlier on keys, but SPY is happening right now."
"12446070","12447110"," We had a successful. "
"12447190","12448410"," The app hour trigger."
"12448850","12452030"," We should go back briefly here to tag the half hour trigger and then just launch."
"12453010","12453050"," Yeah. "
"12453390","12457570"," So I have some supply right over have like right around where they open."
"12460570","12463470"," At the, I'm sorry about that."
"12463590","12469830"," It's my room, but no enough at four, nine, sorry, four, eight, five, seven, four, sixty. "
"12470150","12471410"," I have some supply here."
"12474250","12478470"," But again, where we are, we're really flat right now."
"12478690","12482530"," I could see us trying to like get up to about 4870. "
"12482530","12487850"," There is some gamma at 4870, which we can kind of look at really quickly."
"12488190","12488850"," Let's look at indices."
"12490190","12490990"," So SPX. "
"12491230","12493850"," Right on a gamma level right now."
"12493970","12494030"," Right."
"12494150","12494530"," Isn't it at?"
"12495530","12495930"," Yeah. "
"12496250","12498510"," So here's something there's that we've been parked on it all day."
"12498650","12498790"," Right?"
"12499050","12499310"," Yeah."
"12499430","12502130"," So 4850, like I have it up on screen right now. "
"12502190","12503110"," If you guys can see this."
"12503790","12506930"," Let me actually move that a little bit."
"12506930","12508070"," So it's in the middle. "
"12508070","12512530"," So right here 4850 is where we've been parked."
"12514530","12517210"," And the next big gamma is a 4900."
"12517490","12519610"," You know, this is a really, really bullish development. "
"12520130","12527270"," Now there's almost as equal amount of gamma in calls at 4850 and at 4900 plus there's some put down"
"12527270","12527430"," there."
"12527810","12530950"," You're seeing some like put gamma like building up."
"12531630","12536410"," In decreasing amounts in the in the monies or for puts essentially. "
"12536690","12541830"," So what we're seeing is there's fuel building up now to the upside, but it's not rocket fuel."
"12542090","12544890"," We don't have like big gamma stacks down there."
"12545370","12546810"," What you see here is 5000. "
"12547390","12552330"," And on the 5000 strike, there's a bunch of call gamma and almost, you know, I want to say like"
"12552330","12554790"," about 70% of the call gamma."
"12555030","12557910"," There's almost as put gamma there too."
"12557910","12563290"," That is also very, very interesting because that to me indicates. "
"12565110","12570390"," A box spread between 4800 and 5000."
"12571250","12576630"," Because this just suddenly came up right as some of the other put gamma came up overnight."
"12576630","12584370"," So this to me, it looks like 4800 4850 somebody opened box spreads with 5000 strike level just to"
"12584370","12584830"," kind of make. "
"12585490","12586390"," More money."
"12588510","12592610"," Also, looks like market is starting to rip."
"12592930","12593750"," Is that what's happening?"
"12594570","12595750"," One o'clock just happened. "
"12596470","12601390"," So let's look at this really quickly together and then I'll go."
"12601710","12604050"," Actually, it's better to look at it in hero."
"12605410","12609850"," Because that kind of gives us a really, really good indication of. "
"12610450","12612990"," Yeah, man, they called are coming in puts are being sold."
"12618130","12620570"," Nobody has any fear right now."
"12620990","12624190"," Look, look, I think it's. "
"12625410","12629750"," I think we I'm still on we rolled down camp into the 31st, but."
"12630110","12631390"," No, no cap."
"12631630","12632930"," Okay, so it is time. "
"12633630","12635690"," It is time to show the naive thing again."
"12636150","12637630"," Yeah, like I've made it."
"12637630","12642950"," I'm still looking for that that pull down into but that daily trigger is so low right now. "
"12643290","12644650"," It's not going to happen."
"12644650","12645490"," I don't want it to be."
"12645630","12648910"," I don't want it to be as deep as some are expecting it to be right now. "
"12648910","12651210"," The daily trigger is still kind of low for my tastes."
"12651890","12657370"," It sits at spy at least it's sitting way down at four twenty one."
"12657710","12659030"," Or excuse me, four seventy one. "
"12659050","12662110"," Excuse me, but we're almost in line at that four seventy two."
"12662230","12665430"," So that's where I'm looking for that roll down to occur."
"12665970","12666410"," Gotcha. "
"12666530","12668730"," You know, I know we're against where we're against each other."
"12668830","12672650"," I still have puts on man for a month on spooze still."
"12672650","12673910"," I left mine on. "
"12674230","12674870"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"12674870","12675310"," I still got him on."
"12675450","12678910"," I I left mine on because it it makes sense. "
"12679150","12679350"," Nice."
"12680010","12680210"," Leave it."
"12681250","12681410"," Yeah. "
"12681730","12683370"," Yeah, I own the market right now."
"12683390","12684630"," Like I own I'm long."
"12684990","12685930"," I need to have a hedge. "
"12685930","12686790"," Otherwise I'm stupid."
"12687150","12687270"," Yep."
"12687490","12689530"," And he says be great. "
"12689530","12690170"," All right, man."
"12690250","12690910"," It's time to rip."
"12690910","12691390"," Yeah. "
"12693910","12697150"," We were not seeing look like puts holding steady now."
"12697370","12697470"," Right."
"12697610","12699790"," You guys see that like like puts holding. "
"12699990","12701950"," There's no more like extra puts coming in."
"12702090","12704870"," Sometimes you're some fool is like trying to like I'm going to short this."
"12705490","12707470"," Right now, but let's see. "
"12707870","12708950"," Let's see how that goes."
"12709090","12711730"," If Andy says it's a B auction, that's really bullish."
"12712090","12716430"," So I just regenerated this as of like price right now. "
"12719030","12722010"," So this is my over layer."
"12722510","12723690"," I kind of."
"12724890","12726530"," Use it because it. "
"12727290","12729570"," I firmly believe that no matter what happens."
"12730750","12735050"," Human emotions and it's reflection in price action."
"12736490","12738490"," Kind of similar historically. "
"12738970","12742850"," Like 100 years apart traders kind of behave the same way."
"12745230","12746670"," So what this."
"12747190","12752310"," Just started for up, but you know, as a time has passed over the years. "
"12753110","12754250"," Find it very."
"12754650","12755190"," I used to."
"12755410","12756530"," I used to give sentiment. "
"12758390","12759030"," I don't know."
"12759150","12765250"," Like I gave it a lot of quarter and I really believe man sentiment really does matter here."
"12765250","12768250"," Like it sets the tone for the discussion right to some extent. "
"12768610","12768730"," Right."
"12769050","12769330"," Right."
"12769330","12773950"," There's also the other thing you have to kind of like always keep it the back of your mind for"
"12773950","12774750"," a lot of people. "
"12774990","12776590"," And sometimes even I am go to your best."
"12777990","12779550"," Price dictate sentiment."
"12780730","12782170"," So people get more bullish. "
"12783130","12783610"," Yeah."
"12784010","12787930"," And people get more bearish closer to all time lows."
"12788550","12788630"," So. "
"12789170","12792470"," Yeah, the sentiment really with the age of the Internet."
"12792470","12795170"," I think it also just drives like just drives."
"12796330","12799850"," Like deeper into professionals than it should. "
"12800450","12802430"," It's been too much time on the Internet themselves."
"12803250","12803690"," Right."
"12804150","12804890"," And I don't disagree. "
"12805330","12808270"," So like look at where we are."
"12808650","12810710"," So on the chart."
"12811570","12813490"," I know it's kind of blurry for you guys. "
"12813610","12813910"," No worries."
"12814250","12818290"," I can make this bigger and it doesn't look as nicer."
"12818530","12819030"," That's this way. "
"12819110","12820290"," But maybe it's better to read."
"12820910","12821910"," Anyways, I will call it out."
"12821910","12824990"," The blue line is 1998 August onwards. "
"12825670","12828070"," The orange line is 1962 onwards."
"12828990","12830470"," The green line is 1971."
"12831630","12833110"," And the red line is 1972. "
"12834430","12834730"," Okay."
"12835650","12841490"," The price action over the last 101 trading days has been most similar to those for."
"12842730","12844210"," Timeframes that we have. "
"12844710","12847470"," And what that means."
"12849630","12850390"," Is."
"12853110","12860470"," Well, let me let me backtrack three out of these four timeframes I've talked about are generally"
"12860470","12862990"," bullish into the next 20 days. "
"12863730","12871650"," The only one that isn't is the 1972 analog, which is also highly correlated and has been"
"12871650","12871970"," predictive."
"12872370","12874250"," That's the other thing to everything that's displayed here."
"12874690","12878630"," I run a statistical test on it to see if any of those old series can predict. "
"12879350","12881590"," The current time series, which isn't black."
"12882110","12888430"," So we are right now at a point where either we start, we peaked and we start our downward."
"12889950","12891790"," You see that like red line. "
"12892210","12894990"," This is why I have a hedge on."
"12895390","12896890"," Because it's still highly correlated."
"12897930","12898810"," We are going up. "
"12899550","12901550"," But this is still highly correlated."
"12901550","12904030"," You got the red line, right?"
"12904290","12906290"," Then what do you have what I've highlighted for these guys?"
"12906570","12909330"," The green line and the orange line and the blue line."
"12909410","12910790"," Those are the three bullish lines. "
"12911870","12916710"," I'm going to do green for the low end of that curve for the outside."
"12920120","12921620"," And I'll do orange to for your brother."
"12921860","12922080"," So you can. "
"12923500","12925140"," Orange is somewhere in here."
"12926780","12928900"," So you guys can see that on your screens at home."
"12930700","12931140"," Right. "
"12931140","12934660"," And you can kind of see the blue line pretty clearly anyway."
"12934840","12935760"," So you don't need to do that cap."
"12936100","12942060"," So anyways, what we're seeing right here is, you know, like if you think analog, if you think. "
"12943700","12948540"," History big, you know, similar price action and historically is going to kind of occur again."
"12948880","12954940"," So three of the times that clear the time series that have been highly correlated with the last 101"
"12954940","12955360"," days."
"12955360","12960300"," And I chose 101 just because it kind of seemed cool. "
"12960700","12965880"," But at the same time, it was also because it kind of it's 101 trading days."
"12966060","12967320"," So it covers about five months."
"12967780","12970640"," So it's a good enough time frame to things. "
"12973000","12975740"," You see 472 possibly by tomorrow."
"12976220","12977280"," Well, all right."
"12977920","12978700"," That's great. "
"12978700","12985020"," But so there's one line that's telling me possibly that we kind of chopped out and it's not going"
"12985020","12991340"," to be a straight plunge down or where I lean is this green line where we kind of grind up."
"12991480","12993620"," We just grind up into the end of the year."
"12993860","12998180"," We have like, you know, like peaks and troughs and, you know, like draw downs for like, you know,"
"12998220","12999580"," four or 5% at a time. "
"12999600","13002300"," But then we always recover and we end the year up high."
"13002300","13004840"," That's kind of where my bias lies."
"13005120","13007960"," I am cautiously optimistic along this green line. "
"13008660","13013780"," But three of the most three of the four or most correlated lines are bullish."
"13014400","13015480"," Only one is bearish."
"13015820","13017220"," This is why I am hedging. "
"13017400","13021200"," This is why I am not completely or I'm not completely bearish."
"13021340","13023680"," It's like, yeah, we could go up to go down."
"13024220","13026620"," We're kind of at the peak if you're going to start going down. "
"13026620","13028800"," So if we don't start going down today."
"13028800","13030720"," And then tomorrow."
"13031200","13035080"," And then they are after like, if you're not going down into the end of this week, I don't think"
"13035080","13035620"," that's happening. "
"13036060","13038320"," You know, so that's kind of where I stand."
"13040840","13043500"," But this is this is, I do this."
"13043720","13047520"," It's a, it's not, you know, statistically 100% accurate. "
"13047660","13049180"," I've tried to make it as accurate as possible."
"13050200","13055660"," But this is a good way to kind of like see what the probable outcomes in the market could be."
"13056120","13059560"," So you don't end up getting, you know, blindsided. "
"13061060","13062300"," That's all I really do with that."
"13062600","13065340"," Anyways, let's go back to the spy."
"13066440","13071680"," As you can see, normal puts came in just a little bit of puts came in there holding steady, you"
"13071680","13072740"," know, calls are holding steady. "
"13073160","13074000"," This is consolidation."
"13074620","13076940"," Let me look at what's happening in the mags."
"13077940","13080380"," Because that's always helpful to see. "
"13080800","13084980"," And you see in mines, we got like we're, they're selling puts in the significance of magnificent"
"13084980","13085540"," seven."
"13086080","13091020"," And we're seeing calls being sold to, but now they're being bought back."
"13091340","13094160"," So this is constructive over here too. "
"13094920","13100820"," In the magnificent seven, you kind of want to see that we can go look at IWM flow really quickly."
"13101780","13102380"," Wow."
"13104660","13109060"," That's a, that's a lot of call selling, which is kind of tapered off. "
"13109540","13110000"," This is."
"13111100","13116660"," This could have something to do with the fact that I do IWM like ripped from like."
"13117520","13122000"," Under 190 to 198 at open. "
"13122000","13127460"," So likely this is just like I think call monetization that happened and it's kind of, you know."
"13128440","13133440"," It petered out around like 1050 and then some calls came in and I would study."
"13134000","13136180"," But generally now we're seeing a steady. "
"13137100","13141720"," Put buying experience and zero dt call buying is today Wednesday."
"13142660","13143700"," Hey, it's Tuesday."
"13143980","13147940"," So this is tomorrow's expertise are calls are being bought. "
"13149820","13152100"," So, yeah, so that's IWM."
"13153360","13155440"," Do I ever watch SDX?"
"13155620","13158480"," Well, you know, I don't watch any VIX product."
"13158760","13160540"," The only thing I watch is implied volatility. "
"13161700","13168040"," So, you know, people have, if you go on fintuit, people have theories about why VIX is low."
"13168940","13174360"," People have theories about the government buying ethics to crush the VIX to crush oil prices, yada,"
"13174540","13174940"," yada, yada."
"13175140","13176600"," There's a whole bunch of stuff out there. "
"13176600","13177740"," They're interesting."
"13178280","13179980"," I am not coupooing anything."
"13180400","13183620"," But to me, that's too much. "
"13183900","13189360"," There's too much noise with the signal and the truest signal that I have found is implied"
"13189360","13189820"," volatility."
"13190420","13195440"," If implied volatility is rising, that means people are scared market is going down and implied"
"13195440","13201600"," volatility, you know, going up will show up not in the VIX."
"13201600","13211400"," Because remember, VIX is 30 day outputs and calls, but seven days before, seven days later. "
"13211620","13217640"," So, you know, like it takes only positioning in that 14 day window to calculate the, you know, what"
"13217640","13220380"," the VIX spot, VIX value should be, right?"
"13221100","13230920"," We don't have, we don't have, you know, hedging happening that far out"
"13230920","13231180"," anymore."
"13231180","13233860"," Because people are like, I can just hedge reasons here DTE."
"13234340","13238800"," So tell them about that, by the way, because that is what's happening, right?"
"13239020","13240020"," We know that that started. "
"13240500","13245220"," Yeah, yeah, I mean, I did statistical analysis about this and I posted it on Twitter, like almost"
"13245220","13247980"," like, like eight months ago at this point."
"13249320","13256420"," I looked at VIX and I looked at SPY and I looked at how much intraday volatility there was in"
"13256420","13257220"," both those indices."
"13258780","13264280"," Since zero DTE was introduced, and I kind of did what's called a difference in difference approach. "
"13264880","13270140"," And then I did basically, I said, okay, let me just show you like, T test wise, you know, how"
"13270140","13270880"," different they are."
"13271300","13276460"," And what I found, people were all complaining about, oh, zero DTE is going to like increase"
"13276460","13276880"," volatility."
"13277440","13284320"," No, zero DTE actually decreases volatility because you can hedge short term. "
"13284320","13286260"," You get the result you want."
"13286500","13289080"," And if you don't need the heads, you throw it away, right?"
"13289280","13290780"," It's not going to lose it."
"13290780","13296720"," It is the purest expression of sentiment because it's options and be it's closest expiry. "
"13297160","13306560"," So I am fairly on the side of zero DTE is actually suppressed volatility"
"13306560","13309320"," over the long term."
"13309320","13314260"," And that is why you see intraday VIX swings became smaller."
"13314640","13316840"," Intraday spy swings became smaller. "
"13317500","13319940"," And you just saw collapse in the VIX."
"13320380","13326220"," And I honestly think it's because people are using because you have every day, expertise on the"
"13326220","13328000"," index now on the S&P 500."
"13329000","13330660"," And that's the biggest options market. "
"13331740","13338000"," The other markets inequities, you know, their volume of options traded is like minuscule."
"13338000","13345400"," Like, I would, I would almost go out and say that if you combined all the options that are bought"
"13345400","13355260"," or sold in volume across all equities and just look at how many options on SPX, not spy on"
"13355260","13357120"," SPX, are traded."
"13357460","13360980"," You will find that that is more than all the other combined. "
"13360980","13370720"," So, um, SPX basically has benefited a lot because remember, you don't"
"13370720","13372960"," need to like think about hedging."
"13372960","13377640"," Oh my God, market's gonna like go down and the closest expiry I have, like as a week away."
"13378240","13381160"," So I have to pay all this money to like, you know, open up a position. "
"13381400","13387640"," And because I own this much under management, I have to open a certain percentage as a, as a hedge."
"13387640","13388940"," So I have to put a bigger hedge."
"13388940","13390040"," Now you don't need to do that. "
"13390320","13391220"," You can be like, all right."
"13392040","13395460"," If the market is going to crash because something is going to happen tomorrow, I'm going to buy a"
"13395460","13396560"," one DTE block."
"13397340","13401120"," And it's going to cost me, you know, a tenth of the premium that would have cost me for the"
"13401120","13401560"," end of the week. "
"13402280","13404340"," Um, yeah."
"13404760","13408980"," So, you know, there is another side to that story too, which is we saw."
"13409160","13409760"," So we were streaming. "
"13411060","13414960"," Way back or before the big role in 2022."
"13415740","13419120"," But then as we came into 2022."
"13420020","13422020"," I'm going to make sure my year is right into January. "
"13422660","13424140"," Right around that first roll down."
"13424940","13425360"," Right."
"13426520","13427180"," That put. "
"13427580","13428800"," I think sometime in."
"13429580","13434300"," Like that January, March is when we, for the one of those first time that I saw."
"13435680","13443020"," Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of put zero date put buying too and amplifying downside moves. "
"13443240","13448220"," So where we have the suppressed ball in these situations here, if you get that, if you trigger that"
"13448220","13449040"," put buying."
"13449600","13451620"," You can also see violence on the downside."
"13452060","13453820"," They used to talk about that on Twitter a lot. "
"13454100","13458720"," Yeah, but it's even it's fallen away because they're not, you know, there's no follow through in"
"13458720","13459080"," that hedge."
"13459420","13460900"," No, because that's the thing."
"13461080","13462060"," There's no follow through on that. "
"13463120","13466720"," Somebody like, you know, like JTM says, all right, Mike has gone down enough."
"13466880","13467820"," I'm going to plunk down."
"13468520","13473720"," One and a half million dollars in premium on zero date calls and it just arrests the drop. "
"13474120","13474580"," Like that."
"13474920","13478920"," You know, because suddenly somebody, you know, and there's a, and the thing is cap."
"13479200","13481060"," You have to remember we talked about gamma earlier. "
"13481740","13485540"," That scenario where the chase is going to happen where zero DTE is really."
"13486880","13491420"," It's going to happen with it that whole thing at the same time, right?"
"13491800","13492160"," Right."
"13492520","13497780"," And so that's why like the CTA thresholds being so much lower, the daily trigger being so much"
"13497780","13498060"," lower. "
"13498520","13502220"," And the fact that we're in positive gamma and we're like, yeah, we're going to see it grind up."
"13502300","13505420"," They have no pressure to buy right now."
"13505560","13507080"," CTA is there along the market. "
"13507340","13508360"," They've got no pressure to buy."
"13508560","13509580"," They're just sitting on the market."
"13510180","13514220"," If we break a threshold, they'll start selling, but otherwise it's that slow grind up until they"
"13514220","13514680"," monetize. "
"13514680","13515200"," Right."
"13515460","13515600"," Right."
"13515940","13520840"," And so right now what we're seeing since one o'clock, we got that nice bump right into one o "
"13520840","13521120","'clock. "
"13521480","13522080"," Look at that."
"13522300","13522900"," Options are flat."
"13523740","13527660"," Like the delta that's coming in is, you know, kind of flat. "
"13527780","13528360"," This is just chop."
"13528580","13529900"," You can't really like make a trip."
"13530060","13530640"," Yeah, I agree. "
"13530840","13536360"," You kind of want to see, you know, this to like start picking up, you know, zero DTE is to"
"13536360","13539400"," pick up and the zero DTE puts that are losing value."
"13539400","13542680"," You know, we have some questions coming in right now too."
"13542740","13542980"," We've got. "
"13543120","13543640"," Yeah, it's right."
"13543700","13543920"," Go ahead."
"13544160","13544620"," No, it's fine. "
"13544860","13547040"," The, obviously here."
"13547580","13553820"," Curious about a window of weakness being a blow off pop and not the slow put the slight pullback."
"13553820","13558180"," I guess I'm assuming some of the some ad living on my end, but yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"13558280","13562560"," They're asking about China stocks multiple times now, but give any thoughts on it."
"13562620","13563740"," If you don't, you don't have to either."
"13568940","13569380"," Don't. "
"13569380","13571440"," I said that the last time I was on stream."
"13572240","13573480"," I have June calls."
"13573920","13577180"," I have June spreads on queb and I'm not going anywhere with them. "
"13577880","13579820"," I was a little contrarian when I bought them."
"13580000","13581360"," They are red right now."
"13582140","13583220"," But I'm okay. "
"13583880","13588260"," I am okay being long exposure to China for this."
"13589960","13592380"," I think it's a great thing, by the way."
"13592380","13594660"," Yeah, I did my outlook for the year to be long. "
"13595680","13598480"," Quab K web and all the other are a bunch of you."
"13598680","13598760"," Yeah."
"13598760","13603780"," In fact, sigh in the thing is, it's. "
"13605080","13609360"," There's some like new stuff happening to right like they're basically announced yesterday."
"13609500","13612200"," They were going to put a trillion you on into China stock market."
"13613440","13617880"," Literally like move it up and, you know, like I bet like Americans like we don't do that. "
"13617880","13620700"," I bet we might want to do exactly do."
"13622000","13624100"," So, so, yeah."
"13624940","13629560"," And then I'd say if you see the like our treasury, I'm like, and you pick the treasury department"
"13629560","13630280"," to say we don't do that. "
"13630620","13630900"," Come on."
"13630980","13632360"," Yeah, no, it's really funny man."
"13632560","13636580"," Because, because, you know, like, that's what everybody's looking for is the QRA. "
"13636820","13639460"," If the QRA comes out more bills than coupons."
"13640700","13641420"," Yeah, dude."
"13641720","13644660"," That market is going to just cream upwards. "
"13645640","13648140"," So, I think that's the thing."
"13648380","13655020"," I did see I'm going to throw a QRA is unlikely to happen, but if it did."
"13656500","13662020"," You're talking about a situation very similar to 2020, the bottom of 2020. "
"13662880","13668700"," No, I think it would be again, it would be again, you know, October, October 31."
"13669100","13670580"," It's going to be the exact same thing."
"13670700","13674100"," If she comes out and like says stuff like right now. "
"13674460","13680180"," Hey, we absorb like $60 billion today in two year treasuries."
"13680180","13681020"," We absorb that."
"13681220","13688300"," So, they could be like, yeah, they could be like we let's do more coupons. "
"13688740","13690940"," And then that the market is not going to work."
"13691200","13693940"," But they cut or they cut it the same or no, hit us with either."
"13694100","13695300"," Well, they can do either at that point. "
"13695300","13696000"," Right."
"13696440","13697240"," So the thing is you're right."
"13697380","13698640"," I think you're hinting at the same thing. "
"13698660","13700360"," I think we talked about this earlier too."
"13700800","13701420"," There is."
"13702260","13705240"," Here's the mental calculus guys, like this is how I see it. "
"13705420","13706580"," You don't have to agree with this."
"13706580","13708200"," I am not an expert in this stuff."
"13708540","13711120"," I'm a retail trader like you, but I got a big brain. "
"13711420","13712600"," So I like to think about this stuff."
"13713200","13713580"," So."
"13719010","13724090"," There's two things like there's the FOMC where there's an expectation of a rate cut, which is"
"13724090","13725410"," getting priced out in March. "
"13726290","13731030"," Then on the other hand, you have the QR announcement, which is for the next quarter."
"13731630","13732710"," What are we going to be selling?"
"13732950","13734150"," How the government going to fund itself?"
"13734710","13740090"," Is it going to be using issuing key bills or is it's going to be issuing treasuries?"
"13741230","13747110"," Traditionally, there's like a matrix of how many treasuries versus bills you need to do, which is"
"13747110","13748130"," fairly conservative."
"13748350","13749410"," I think it's like. "
"13749410","13754290"," 30% of it should be bills and 70% should be coupon."
"13756190","13759090"," But what Yellen did was she kind of flipped the script."
"13759290","13760070"," She went 80 20. "
"13760330","13763350"," She said 80% of it's going to be bills."
"13765130","13767350"," And 20% is going to be coupon."
"13768250","13771610"," And the impact of that is very, very simple. "
"13771890","13772790"," It loosens."
"13773670","13780510"," The credit markets, because what that does is because there's not more longer dated treasuries"
"13780510","13781970"," being offered by the government."
"13782710","13789830"," The dealers or the traders are not holding back anticipating for higher rates for them to get a"
"13789830","13790410"," better deal. "
"13791130","13794650"," So the yield curve on the long end starts coming down."
"13794950","13800910"," If the yield curve on the long end starts coming down, businesses can get cheaper loans."
"13801610","13804010"," Home buyers can get cheaper mortgages. "
"13806550","13809970"," People can start moving money around a little bit easier."
"13812010","13819630"," So that's why what we saw on October 31st was such like, oh my God, how did this happen event"
"13819630","13825890"," was because nobody saw this coming was because you usually don't see that kind of structure."
"13825890","13831850"," And now there is arguments right now that the Republicans may not like that because that is a very"
"13831850","13832790"," political move. "
"13833170","13838950"," It is not a structurally sound move for, you know, the Treasury Department to be doing to the"
"13838950","13841990"," issuing more debt that is short term versus long term."
"13843790","13845890"," Now, on the other hand, the Fed."
"13847970","13855690"," If there are no, there are no, there's more bill, there's more bills than treasuries that coupon"
"13855690","13861310"," being offered the Fed doesn't need to cut because conditions are loosening anyways. "
"13861690","13866490"," In fact, they might actually come out and start talking down the market being like, hey, you know,"
"13866750","13867930"," inflation is not done."
"13869050","13871350"," You know, they might job on the market down."
"13871810","13876810"," The other thing is, if we actually end up getting more coupon than bills. "
"13878370","13880770"," The Fed can come out and be dovish."
"13881170","13883610"," So the end of this result is going to be the same."
"13883850","13884370"," We're going up. "
"13885370","13891170"," You know, the theater is going to be ultimately like which side."
"13892150","13893090"," Does it happen?"
"13893290","13894870"," You know, do they come out and start talking?"
"13895170","13900190"," You know, something very bullish or this come out and start talking something very bearish when the"
"13900190","13903570"," FOMMC minutes are released and the QRA comes up."
"13903830","13908990"," That's why when you look at this implied volatility structure right when the QRA is. "
"13909110","13910950"," Oh, wait, what go back."
"13912270","13914570"," They actually are selling that now too."
"13914570","13916350"," This was all green. "
"13916530","13918050"," This is still shades of green in here."
"13918250","13921990"," You can kind of see it like, you know, really faded out green."
"13922350","13927790"," But this was all like lit up green because nobody wanted to sell puts into this. "
"13928070","13931730"," So right now it just kind of seems like nobody's really concerned."
"13932010","13937230"," They're willing to sell puts for this expiry in ferry."
"13937570","13939290"," I know I kind of like talked a lot. "
"13939290","13943830"," I answered a few questions, try to keep a conversation going."
"13944070","13945450"," And with indirect taking a 60 was auction."
"13945950","13947110"," Who's buying it foreign banks. "
"13947510","13948570"," Actually, no stretching walls."
"13949130","13950370"," I am going to disagree with you."
"13950570","13954370"," It is not banks by or states buying it or banks buying it. "
"13954610","13959430"," It is investors in other countries buying it."
"13960030","13965070"," There was a piece put out by Nomura at the end of November where they kind of went and looked"
"13965070","13968990"," at, you know, who is buying all the treasuries that the US is offering."
"13968990","13977050"," And what it was, they found out that it was basically investors and not institutional money. "
"13979930","13981930"," So, yeah, so let's see."
"13983910","13988250"," If he introduces coupon issuance, the equity market and bond market will rip."
"13988490","13989130"," Yes, absolutely. "
"13989590","13989970"," That is right."
"13989970","13991350"," That's me, by the way."
"13991590","13992690"," Yeah, I know I saw that. "
"13997630","13998150"," Let's see."
"13998510","13998790"," Interesting."
"13999090","14006410"," So that I posted so that they're not going to understand like, what do they need to know as a"
"14006410","14007190"," cash market trader?"
"14007570","14008390"," That's what you need to know. "
"14008550","14012690"," And when that date comes around, that's what you're looking for that they answer that question."
"14013730","14014130"," Right."
"14014770","14021230"," So, more bills, more issuance and bills, T bills is bullish. "
"14022650","14026350"," So, can you tell us more about your my morning routine?"
"14029090","14034230"," Like I wake up, I put my pants on one leg at a time like everybody else and then I"
"14034230","14035190"," go to the bathroom."
"14035190","14039850"," So, but I'm guessing you want me to like talk about like what I look at."
"14040210","14041750"," Yeah, I understand. "
"14042050","14044250"," You do any manscaping in the morning."
"14045350","14047150"," On occasion for the lady."
"14047530","14049150"," Yes, breakfast in the morning. "
"14049490","14050650"," No, I don't."
"14050670","14052730"," I usually have a cup of coffee."
"14052990","14055350"," I drink coffee, man. "
"14055590","14060390"," And I do a French press and I put creamer in it because."
"14061090","14062070"," I like it."
"14062230","14063010"," I stretch. "
"14063390","14065390"," I meditate every day that night."
"14066170","14067970"," I like my scotch."
"14068130","14068850"," I like my weed. "
"14069370","14070690"," You know, if you guys really want to know."
"14071910","14072250"," Yeah."
"14073210","14074650"," But none of that's in the morning. "
"14074930","14079290"," In the morning, usually I am, you know, like busy with hot home stuff and then after that, when I"
"14079290","14084310"," sit down and look at the market, which is usually before open, I will look at options positioning."
"14084910","14093070"," I will look at the flow because SPX now trades options 24 seven so you can, you have flow coming"
"14093070","14095550"," in overnight and stuff so you can kind of see opposition is developing."
"14096130","14100670"," You look at, you know, what the implied volatility is like like this, you kind of look at the term"
"14100670","14103330"," structure but that's looking like so I was like, okay, this is kind of cool. "
"14103990","14105970"," Is it like bullish looking is it bad looking."
"14105970","14113410"," I look at some of the news, you know, like, are we like, like, who released earnings are in the"
"14113410","14115310"," morning, you know, where they're going."
"14116130","14118970"," And, you know, like, then I try and look at why is that happening?"
"14119110","14121190"," Are they saying, or the consumer is strong?"
"14121410","14126210"," Are they saying that, hey, we've hit bottom or, you know, opposite of, you know, like if somebody's"
"14126210","14128090"," saying, hey, we're like, you know, had a bad. "
"14129050","14133490"," Quarter, you're like, okay, now is that a sector white thing, or is that like them being like bad"
"14133490","14133950"," at managing."
"14134670","14136850"," So you kind of like look at that, but not really."
"14137510","14140930"," And every ticker, but like on some of the big tickers that I think are. "
"14142270","14149130"," Interesting, then I kind of like, you know, kind of see like how this is fitting into the thesis"
"14149130","14151490"," like I, I am."
"14153250","14157250"," As I said, I think I've said this before, I'm cautiously bullish on this market."
"14157790","14160950"," I have a hedge on, but I am cautiously bullish on this market. "
"14161710","14164490"," And it does not show me any weakness right now."
"14164590","14169730"," It's all it's showing me is that it does not want to, you know, go up as fast as everybody"
"14169730","14173050"," you want is thinking is going to go up after that big monster move."
"14173050","14179470"," Last week, because it has to digest all of this information, and it's not going to move till that"
"14179470","14179830"," happens. "
"14181450","14184790"," But anyways, that's kind of what it is."
"14185010","14185730"," What do I trade?"
"14186090","14190790"," I'm with you on that trade, by the way, that digestion that pull I'm on the pullback trade."
"14191290","14197530"," I'm not looking for major downside, but I am looking for that face ripper and up until the 14th up"
"14197530","14199630"," until that Valentine's Day move. "
"14199630","14200470"," Right."
"14200830","14203190"," I don't know if we can get to 52 or 5000."
"14203610","14204710"," I'll take 49. "
"14206130","14206730"," I'll think."
"14207030","14213870"," I mean, you saw when I've put pulled up the levels on on spy on SP X, right."
"14214690","14215830"," Let me put that up again. "
"14216330","14217810"," So cap, look at this."
"14218010","14221690"," Well, SP X trade 4850 something."
"14221870","14223630"," Yeah, I mean, but that's that's the bar, right?"
"14223810","14228370"," Like that's what it's sitting on, but there's now equal amount of gamma happening at 49 hundreds. "
"14228370","14229590"," That's the new call wall."
"14229770","14230670"," That's what we're reaching for."
"14230950","14235250"," And what's really good is like this strikes above that are filling up with gamma. "
"14235610","14235610"," Right."
"14235970","14241830"," So, and so that's like, you know, traders are taking upside positions and that's good."
"14242090","14244450"," And you kind of want to see that matter. "
"14245010","14246030"," What's the date, right?"
"14246170","14250150"," Or at least I guess a big question for if you're watching the show here is where do you pick"
"14250150","14250650"," your poison?"
"14251830","14258890"," Are you just buying a buying a spread for the 14th of February to tag that 4900 or are you"
"14258890","14262950"," waiting for the whatever that dip is and when is that dip for me?"
"14263150","14268490"," I'm picking the 31st, but I want to see those flows come in on the beginning of the month for"
"14268490","14268930"," February."
"14269390","14269590"," Right."
"14269590","14274770"," So that's real shit that should come in the first of the month, but yes. "
"14274770","14282110"," Thank you for your 401ks for, you know, contributing passively exactly to this, you know,"
"14282110","14285710"," contributing passively into the Ponzi that is a stock market."
"14285930","14289270"," You know, I'm kind of joking, but 31st first."
"14289450","14290170"," That's why that happens. "
"14290430","14292550"," Yeah, those flows come in."
"14292610","14302890"," So, so we are looking to that now with somebody else about China, you know, there was a, there"
"14302890","14303650"," was a very."
"14304970","14312310"," Sad note posted yesterday by Sichini, it was a letter by a portfolio manager, like a fund manager"
"14312310","14319850"," out in Singapore, who basically kind of like almost blew up here at 19% draw down this month so"
"14319850","14321230"," far in 19 days. "
"14321730","14326170"," So he kind of like closed down the fund and he like said, you know, like, Hey, you know, we"
"14326170","14329250"," were long China, but it doesn't seem to be working."
"14330370","14333650"," We were short Japan, but that doesn't seem to be working."
"14333850","14339470"," We've had, you know, like a ridiculous amount of, you know, draw down. "
"14339730","14340110"," Right."
"14340510","14343210"," So you're drawn out basically in China, right?"
"14343350","14343530"," I think."
"14343950","14344030"," Yeah. "
"14344730","14344730"," Yeah."
"14345250","14345430"," Yeah."
"14345710","14347670"," And so, you know, he pulls this fund. "
"14348530","14349790"," And I felt really sad."
"14349950","14356170"," I left like a long comment about, you know, like, how that is really difficult to admit and you"
"14356170","14357970"," admit to everybody who's money you're managing."
"14357970","14359290"," Like, I'm a retail trader. "
"14359510","14360050"," Well, he didn't either."
"14360890","14360950"," Right."
"14361070","14363290"," So all those guys sometimes will double down, triple down. "
"14363730","14364950"," It's a point that fraud."
"14365250","14365370"," So."
"14365770","14366150"," Right. "
"14366510","14366530"," Right."
"14366830","14370050"," So like he shares to him for doing that and owning up to his mistake."
"14370050","14370330"," Right. "
"14370450","14372410"," And he goes like, I've lost all conflicts as a trader."
"14372990","14377350"," And to me, like that was like, that guy has so much pressure on him, but he's willing to admit"
"14377350","14378990"," that like I make mistakes."
"14378990","14384090"," And I like, you know, when that happens, I go cash and I walk away and I don't trade for"
"14384090","14384770"," like three or four days. "
"14384770","14390530"," I rethink the market, see what I'm seeing, you know, reevaluate the thesis I was trading with and,"
"14390610","14393010"," you know, get back in the market and usually that ends up working well."
"14393170","14398370"," You know, it's very rare that after a break, I will make, you know, bad trades, you know, like my"
"14398370","14399370"," positioning will be better."
"14399530","14401950"," It's good for me to like walk away, but he can't do that. "
"14402370","14402710"," Right."
"14403190","14409290"," He can do that because we've got like lots of money under management and the day he puts out that"
"14409290","14414210"," letter is the day that China announces that we're putting a trillion dollars into."
"14414750","14416230"," Upping up the stock market. "
"14416670","14419750"," So that literally called the bottom in my mind in China."
"14420250","14422450"," They were like, I got a friend here."
"14422510","14424970"," I'm not going to say his name. "
"14425010","14428690"," I got a friend though that's a friend of the show that's a licensed guy."
"14430190","14431990"," And he related to me."
"14432270","14439950"," We were in a phone call last week, week before, and he was talking about a lot of professionals in"
"14439950","14444190"," quite conversations saying they have that or this past three months. "
"14444190","14445290"," I think it started."
"14445730","14450230"," I think a good way to look at it would be like asked out, followed a trend down and bounced"
"14450230","14451010"," pretty consistently."
"14451690","14453750"," You could see us out get murdered at some point. "
"14453890","14455370"," It broke trend to the downside."
"14456330","14458850"," And he mentioned that right around that time period."
"14460430","14465130"," There's a lot of looking back this year to see. "
"14466970","14471490"," There's a thesis being passed around that the stock market has changed again."
"14471490","14474890"," And that they have to rethink in their habits."
"14475810","14475970"," Yeah. "
"14476190","14476950"," How this market acts."
"14477450","14479490"," And I think some charts dot com at the."
"14480150","14484910"," We were showing a video with like three or four fund managers that also said they were rethinking"
"14484910","14485270"," their. "
"14486630","14489790"," Market trade or market habits for this year."
"14492130","14492650"," Differently."
"14493610","14498910"," Like unlike they had ever in the past, they spoke specifically about the manipulation in economic"
"14498910","14502170"," data and stuff that's happening has been happening since this year. "
"14502610","14503830"," I hope you quite again."
"14503970","14504150"," Sorry."
"14504430","14505370"," No, no, it's cool. "
"14506070","14507290"," They're not really hard."
"14507970","14508770"," Create a school position."
"14509050","14511110"," They're in a tailspin last couple of years. "
"14511670","14515810"," They've said a bunch of times that they're going to intervene, but those interventions have not."
"14516830","14519190"," Either panned out or not worked out either."
"14519650","14521210"," They like kind of like not done that. "
"14521610","14525250"," So there's a lot of people who are talking about queb and you know, China in general, basically"
"14525250","14527230"," being like, hey, they're kind of promised up before."
"14527790","14531530"," They might say that, hey, we're putting a trillion dollars into the market, but they might not"
"14531530","14532170"," actually do that."
"14532510","14533730"," You know, they're just contemplating it. "
"14533790","14535090"," So that's a valid concern."
"14536670","14540130"," To me, you know, the R&R is to the upside at this point."
"14540130","14544530"," In all the Chinese thought you think they must stop making stuff for the rest of the world. "
"14547030","14549110"," So, yeah, try to take a look at one of these."
"14549350","14553650"," I did a chart for the year predictions for this year."
"14553830","14554950"," I haven't released this thing yet. "
"14555450","14558710"," Some people have seen it, but I'm going to look and see what tickers I'm looking at and try to"
"14558710","14559050"," hold on."
"14560030","14567010"," Yeah, speaking of tickers, there's something interesting happening within the video right now."
"14567010","14570610"," It's kind of chopping in this like really tight region. "
"14571790","14572810"," And I think that is."
"14573630","14583510"," It might be trying to attack to the upside, you know, try and attack the 600 supply again."
"14584190","14588650"," So that's a, you know, $4 trade. "
"14589590","14590870"," So it's interesting."
"14591290","14593470"," Anyways, somebody asked for Tesla."
"14593930","14594630"," Let me show you Tesla. "
"14598300","14599920"," There's lots of calls coming in, man."
"14600380","14601860"," You can kind of see that right there."
"14602360","14603820"," There's a orange lines. "
"14604220","14607200"," It's 51 million in all the expiry delta and calls."
"14608160","14612100"," And, you know, most of the puts are weekly."
"14612460","14615060"," So they're for this Friday, because you can see this line. "
"14615720","14620080"," The light blue line is deeper than the long than the."
"14621840","14623240"," Dark blue line, which is all expertise."
"14623980","14624120"," So. "
"14626560","14631480"," This snapshot is book is that traders think it's bullish."
"14631900","14635240"," It's also sitting right at its like under its hedge wall at 210."
"14636220","14641220"," So that's a good place for it to start bouncing from, but the upside is kind of capped at 220"
"14641220","14642900"," because that's the call wall. "
"14643740","14647920"," Doesn't mean it can overrun that just because of earnings."
"14648560","14649640"," It's such a binary event."
"14650620","14657980"," So let's look at how overall positioning is outside of the hero signal. "
"14664510","14665470"," Wow."
"14666290","14667610"," It was very interesting."
"14669450","14670130"," Let me. "
"14672290","14672770"," Make that bigger."
"14677410","14680510"," And so as I said, you have your hedge wall at 210."
"14681130","14682730"," It was like a lot of call gamma. "
"14683910","14685910"," There's a lot of call gamma right here."
"14686310","14687130"," Let's do 20."
"14687630","14690290"," So you have your hedge wall right here. "
"14692490","14697190"," And it's, it's pretty even gamma and how much an emotional."
"14700830","14701310"," 13."
"14701730","14704410"," It's actually has twice as much put gamma there. "
"14704970","14706590"," And it has call gamma at 210."
"14707350","14711890"," All right, so that's kind of where it is right now, but we have this huge stick at 220 and"
"14711890","14712690"," that's the call wall."
"14712850","14715710"," That's because it's like 47 million in notional. "
"14717990","14720730"," At the 220 level currently."
"14722830","14725370"," I need to like expand it some more."
"14726770","14727990"," Yeah, so. "
"14729410","14730550"," Break of 220."
"14731470","14735190"," Well, break of 217 leads to 220 pretty fast."
"14735410","14736670"," But it's not. "
"14737830","14740230"," I'm still up on Tesla calls right now."
"14740350","14743610"," Surprisingly, I'm catching a lot of calls."
"14744630","14746010"," Medium on my calls right now. "
"14746450","14747910"," Yeah, Ivy is increasing, right?"
"14748390","14750250"," I was up big time."
"14750250","14755210"," Big time yesterday, I think I'm up like 10 cents or five cents or some shit right here."
"14755210","14757630"," So the at the money call right now. "
"14758090","14763330"," The Ivy on that is 12 stack 12.7 standard deviations higher."
"14764110","14765250"," That it has been."
"14765630","14765910"," Yeah. "
"14766150","14771870"," I was 64 cents or something like that on 235s for the 26."
"14772510","14774190"," And even with all this blood in Tesla."
"14775270","14776610"," Yeah, the calls are paying man. "
"14776770","14780770"," So, you know, you can you can think about that position or, but we are at that."
"14780930","14785330"," I'm watching right now because we are testing that low from Friday."
"14785610","14787410"," I believe right now it could be wrong in that. "
"14788150","14788630"," Yeah."
"14789310","14790710"," So we're kind of."
"14791130","14794910"," We're touching the Friday low right now on Tesla. "
"14795450","14796370"," I think we're going."
"14796590","14799910"," I think we're going back to hopefully it'll test yesterday's low."
"14800630","14805550"," No, so I have the next supply like all the way at two or five, six. "
"14805810","14806490"," Yeah, dude."
"14806890","14808130"," I got one 65."
"14808970","14810570"," No, that's where I want to buy. "
"14810770","14811690"," I think I told you that."
"14811830","14812910"," I want to buy it on there."
"14813270","14813510"," Yeah. "
"14815990","14819590"," And then you said, you know, you might even go lower and I was like, Oh, my God."
"14819790","14820810"," So well, the low."
"14821030","14821530"," All right. "
"14821630","14826630"," So the low that we had dude in like October or something, there was a tiny ass gap left behind"
"14826630","14827850"," like two dollars below."
"14828670","14832130"," And then there's a huge move down to like 68 bucks or something."
"14832550","14836610"," Make the quarter the six month trigger or something like that, right?"
"14837030","14837050"," Yeah. "
"14837190","14837670"," Exactly."
"14838330","14840530"," That $9.89 or something like that."
"14840650","14841990"," There's a tiny ass gap. "
"14842370","14848790"," So when we hit that last major low in October, dude, I didn't buy that morning because I was like,"
"14848790","14849150"," you know what?"
"14849290","14850570"," They'll probably do it at nine 30."
"14850830","14855830"," Slam it down like three or four bucks and then we'll get the ride and they just off and run"
"14855830","14858170"," and like chase price after that."
"14858790","14859270"," Right. "
"14859830","14864210"," You know, with Tesla, the other thing is also guys like it always, it always moves."
"14864610","14868750"," Usually they, they kind of kill earnings every year."
"14869150","14870790"," And the fact that it is so cheap. "
"14871570","14874930"," And the fact that, you know, there's more puts expiring on Friday."
"14875210","14875710"," There's calls."
"14877870","14878370"," That kind of. "
"14879470","14880330"," Says a little bit."
"14880550","14884810"," Yeah, they're juicing it right now for a rocket ship."
"14884810","14886970"," I mean, I'll see how earnings come out, man. "
"14887190","14890850"," And you know, you can always buy PSLL, which is the Tesla long."
"14891910","14892390"," Picker."
"14892770","14894030"," I mean, kind of put that here. "
"14894370","14895290"," I always like that."
"14895710","14897510"," Like what I mean, that's leverage and long."
"14897930","14901430"," But I don't like that was my, my own rules for Tesla typically. "
"14902950","14906690"," Of course, if you're buying into the event, you sell before the event."
"14907070","14910790"," If we are going to sell into an event, I like to wait."
"14911970","14914930"," After that expiry now, I'm on the 26th right now, but. "
"14915950","14921290"," Like the after not always, but as a rule, 70% of the time."
"14922010","14926410"," Even if they have a good earnings that typically, in my view, sells down before the open the next"
"14926410","14926690"," day."
"14927090","14928850"," You see the underlying profit taking. "
"14929250","14933750"," And then you see that next expire or that once that first, that's like the 26 when that expires."
"14934390","14936230"," You'll see the actual Tesla run."
"14936410","14937210"," It'll just start moving. "
"14937210","14938010"," Right."
"14938330","14942170"," And for a lot of high volatility trades, you know, you do leaps."
"14942730","14944670"," Or if you if you're bullish, do leaps. "
"14945650","14947950"," Wait to express that trade."
"14948350","14948710"," Yeah."
"14949310","14951510"," And you know, they won't have high IV. "
"14951890","14952830"," They'll be more expensive."
"14953930","14962110"," If you are a truly master, like a true master trader, like Mr Pelosi, you'd buy like the money, you"
"14962110","14962510"," know, leaps."
"14962990","14966490"," So you take the advantage of the 100x leverage. "
"14967450","14970250"," And you know, you're essentially, you know, expressing the upside."
"14971330","14971730"," And."
"14972030","14974270"," Yeah, exactly. "
"14974310","14975470"," And a pretty big fucking way."
"14976030","14976350"," Yeah."
"14976650","14976750"," Yeah. "
"14977070","14980750"," So, and then, you know, you can make 500 grand in like two weeks."
"14981910","14984510"," So, um, there's another thing we do here too, man."
"14984710","14988590"," And I don't know if you've seen us do this, but when we come into the big tech earnings where. "
"14990150","14994530"," Each quarter, we come into the big tech earnings that can actually swing an index."
"14995490","14998050"," Like Netflix can swing an index."
"14999090","15004050"," Any of the big, big heavy hitters in tech that can move the needle. "
"15005250","15006750"," On cues or spy."
"15008030","15012890"," One of my favorite trades, we do this here all the time is you pick up the zero dates, like"
"15012890","15014710"," at 4pm or 401."
"15014710","15016130"," What's our calls?"
"15016750","15020890"," And you get that exposure to let's say a Tesla that rips faces off. "
"15021490","15021770"," Right."
"15021970","15023270"," First 15 minutes or so."
"15023490","15027590"," And then you're not dealing with like the Tesla drop before their guidance. "
"15027970","15029750"," And Elon does stupid shit."
"15029910","15034130"," And then by morning, uh, um, it's been monetized on the underlying."
"15034130","15034650"," So. "
"15035170","15035470"," Right."
"15035930","15041770"," You can easily do make all that money in 15 minutes on a close, literally in a zero date."
"15041770","15045670"," You can go from like 10 cents to $1.40 in moments. "
"15045970","15050610"," The one key thing to state on this though is, uh, you make sure you put your stops in on"
"15050610","15050950"," the ups."
"15050950","15055930"," If you're a bearish or if you're bearish, put your stops into the downside right when you take that"
"15055930","15057130"," trade or even to the upside."
"15057130","15058490"," So you buy a 10 cent call. "
"15058770","15062570"," You're going to in your mind say this is going to 90 cents."
"15062710","15064670"," I'm going to monetize it 70 cents."
"15064670","15068850"," So if we flip really high fast, you're already out of the trade. "
"15069430","15069870"," Right."
"15070130","15070530"," Same in the down."
"15070530","15072670"," No, I completely agree. "
"15073070","15074710"," You know, expose your dude."
"15074970","15075870"," 20 cent calls."
"15076410","15081870"," Why buy four dollar fucking Tesla calls expiring tomorrow when you combine for 20 cents. "
"15082210","15083190"," That's absurd."
"15083770","15086290"," So, uh, sorry."
"15086330","15086510"," Good. "
"15086950","15087990"," It's cool."
"15088270","15089630"," I agree with that."
"15089790","15092810"," They also think it's, uh, you know, Nvidia. "
"15092870","15097350"," The reason I always remember their earnings time because they don't change it."
"15097350","15098750"," It's for 20 in the afternoon."
"15099310","15103770"," Which is always really funny because you can buy options after that point. "
"15104050","15107750"," So, um, uh, It's famous for that."
"15107770","15108110"," Isn't there?"
"15108250","15109590"," They were always famous for."
"15110130","15110570"," Yeah. "
"15110610","15114650"," I mean, a lot of people have no open to right when no one was ready for it."
"15114750","15115750"," I think that them are AMD."
"15115770","15116930"," I can't remember which one. "
"15117070","15117890"," Oh, no, no, no."
"15117910","15119610"," Is it TSMC that that was it?"
"15119730","15120410"," Is it a?"
"15120490","15124210"," TSMC does it before market open because they're based in China."
"15124890","15125970"," One of them, dude. "
"15126210","15131190"," One of them was like, one of the CEOs said that they hate the gambling on, uh, on earning season."
"15131190","15132430"," So sometimes the leak."
"15133270","15134690"," They're, um, earnings. "
"15134950","15136550"," Which one, which company?"
"15136790","15137950"," I am, I am unaware."
"15138570","15140750"," Uh, Apple does for 20 as well."
"15141110","15146610"," One of these, one of these, um, chip companies will sometimes leak like a day before or earlier in"
"15146610","15147050"," the afternoon. "
"15147890","15150590"," And I'll try to find out which one it is that does that."
"15150990","15151510"," Gotcha."
"15151510","15155590"," So I, I have this little handy dandy chart. "
"15155950","15163150"," It is, um, you know, uh, it kind of tells you if it's before market open or after market open"
"15163150","15164530"," and what the implied."
"15165190","15167450"," Volatility is right now, the percentage move."
"15167870","15170130"," So for Tesla, one 24. "
"15171050","15176490"," Uh, it was 5.84% is the implied move on the stock."
"15176490","15181810"," So if you're going to buy, like that's how the strategist price right now, but that much of a move."
"15182530","15190710"," Uh, lamb research, 5.4%. Uh, tomorrow, Las Vegas sense, 5.22%. IBM. "
"15192070","15196870"," 3.62%. It's probably bring ups us, uh, straddle or straddle sellers as well."
"15197090","15202130"," People selling straddles or selling, um, options into these ERs."
"15202130","15206230"," Yeah, because it was like two out of 10, but you win eight out of 10, right?"
"15206510","15207930"," You're selling puts and rails. "
"15208430","15208870"," Yeah."
"15208970","15213450"," Or you know, like if you have a directional bias, uh, you can, as I said, you can use a"
"15213450","15216090"," calendar, which is basically you are."
"15216370","15218410"," Yeah, you're short. "
"15218870","15223650"," A call or a put in the direction you want, you know, out of the money and you buy the"
"15223650","15224710"," same strike a week later."
"15225110","15231510"," So what happens is the ID crush from the earnings being done, you know, reduces."
"15231510","15233750"," The value of your soul call. "
"15233930","15236150"," So you have more money coming in from that leg."
"15236650","15238410"," And if the price goes up still."
"15239410","15239890"," You're. "
"15241450","15242230"," No, no, no, no, no."
"15242230","15243170"," You crush for a week out."
"15243510","15247210"," So you actually capitalize on that in two on your long side. "
"15247570","15249330"," So a calendars are really good."
"15249450","15255710"," The counter is a really good way to express moves, especially with high IV stocks, because you can"
"15255710","15260330"," still get upside exposure or downside exposure without having to pay for like the nearest expert."
"15260330","15261130"," So. "
"15262150","15263170"," One side loose."
"15263370","15264970"," If it does go against you at some point, too."
"15265110","15265330"," Yeah. "
"15265570","15265710"," Yeah."
"15265890","15269090"," If it gets too much in the money, that's why I said it has to be, you have to do"
"15269090","15269190"," it."
"15269190","15270790"," Like you have to kind of like know what you're selling. "
"15271490","15271770"," Right."
"15272510","15278310"," You know, the options market is saying that it's 5.84 percent."
"15278790","15282570"," You know, implied move for Tesla at 200. "
"15283010","15285010"," That means it's like almost like $12."
"15285350","15288730"," As well as expecting to you expected to move $12 up or down."
"15288730","15289690"," Sure. "
"15290090","15291930"," But how about $20 up or down."
"15292490","15293610"," Do you expect that?"
"15293910","15294030"," No."
"15294290","15295450"," So maybe you like buy. "
"15296450","15299890"," If you bullish and you think it's going to move, you know."
"15300490","15301550"," $12, $15."
"15302070","15308870"," Why don't you buy a $240 call or sell a $240 call, which will have a lot of IV for"
"15308870","15309130"," today. "
"15309850","15313370"," For this, this expiry and you sell."
"15313370","15317270"," So, actually, you know what we can."
"15317890","15319430"," Find high V strikes. "
"15319750","15321510"," Make sure there's a bunch of people on them."
"15321990","15324670"," And then you've also got the other thing too here is."
"15326490","15328950"," Ratio spreads, bull or bear can pay. "
"15329430","15331830"," Bank on those trades as well."
"15332590","15335830"," So I'd be high expected moves if they get the expected high move."
"15336610","15338130"," So we're going to go down or up. "
"15338270","15338670"," Doesn't matter."
"15338670","15339370"," Right."
"15339630","15342430"," So I'm just going to like kind of build a."
"15343070","15343470"," Yeah. "
"15343550","15343990"," Do you think that?"
"15344450","15344890"," Yeah."
"15345110","15348190"," So I'm going to just to illustrate where it is."
"15348390","15348490"," Yeah. "
"15348650","15348970"," That's two."
"15349190","15350510"," It's a 240 call."
"15353530","15353970"," No. "
"15354290","15355510"," So right now or no."
"15355770","15356110"," Yeah."
"15356250","15356530"," I'm being Tesla. "
"15356910","15358250"," So what date right now?"
"15359090","15360030"," So I am selling."
"15360530","15362230"," I'm going to let's say I'm going to sell a 225."
"15363030","15364770"," What's the date of the strike?"
"15364770","15365510"," 26th. "
"15366210","15368610"," I'm looking right now to see where the highest IV is."
"15368910","15369250"," Yeah."
"15370270","15372130"," Well, we're not going to do high. "
"15372490","15373450"," We'll be at the money."
"15374110","15374930"," Well, we don't."
"15375290","15375390"," Right. "
"15375650","15376050"," Is that a high?"
"15376730","15381750"," No, I got 225 because I'm just saying that if the implied move is like, you know, like."
"15382470","15383530"," Six percent at the moment."
"15384630","15387150"," So let's get, you know, $17 above spot. "
"15387550","15388410"," So we're outside."
"15388410","15390710"," So a chance of that going in the money is like less."
"15390710","15392050"," Because it goes. "
"15392530","15393190"," Yeah."
"15393550","15394110"," So I have."
"15394590","15395250"," Okay. "
"15395670","15398290"," So I have the call option at 225."
"15398630","15400150"," I'm going to sell that."
"15400370","15405710"," And I want to buy a call option for the second of them for 225. "
"15407670","15408330"," Right."
"15409170","15410590"," So let's do."
"15410970","15414370"," Let's calculate this and look at that. "
"15416980","15420220"," So at expiry, which is this weekend."
"15420880","15428040"," If the price is any place over $210 or sorry, any place over $204."
"15429840","15430880"," You're making money. "
"15431520","15432540"," Do you guys see that?"
"15433200","15435860"," Talent display is fantastic, especially with high ID."
"15440260","15441620"," Willy Loman gets down."
"15441860","15443380"," I'm seeing an ID of 8% of a Tesla. "
"15443700","15443920"," Yeah."
"15444180","15445700"," So it might have increased today."
"15446040","15452120"," That as I said, that chart is that I showed is not updated as updated as of this morning. "
"15452120","15454800"," So that is totally possible."
"15455400","15457380"," But what I'm saying is you can look at a calendar spread."
"15457820","15461300"," And if you start looking at calendar spread, so they can pay out money because you're not risking"
"15461300","15461820"," as much. "
"15462820","15470680"," So this spread would cost you $1.39 for the same strike for 225 C's."
"15471440","15472840"," And it can pay out."
"15473260","15477580"," Like if it goes, let's say it actually goes to 225 and it expires at 225. "
"15478480","15480300"," It will give 444%."
"15482570","15483910"," Which is kind of fantastic."
"15486690","15489230"," So I like calendar spreads just for that reason. "
"15492320","15496040"," Just saying might be even more ID, which makes the calendar spread even more appealing."
"15496340","15496500"," Absolutely."
"15496900","15497500"," That's what I'm trying to say. "
"15497700","15499780"," Like, you know, don't do straight put straight calls."
"15500280","15501940"," Option the fantastic pick up a book."
"15502440","15502980"," Ask questions. "
"15503460","15504560"," People are always willing to answer."
"15504780","15505800"," I'm always willing to answer."
"15506980","15507760"," You cannot see it. "
"15507820","15508400"," It's really small."
"15508700","15508880"," Okay."
"15509080","15509320"," Yeah, man. "
"15509460","15510060"," Like I got you."
"15511520","15512140"," Let's see."
"15523360","15523820"," Yeah. "
"15523940","15524660"," You guys can see that."
"15525560","15526740"," Yeah, it looks great, man."
"15527100","15527280"," Yeah. "
"15527820","15528240"," Slow scroll."
"15528520","15529280"," Like start at the top."
"15530040","15530620"," So they can see. "
"15530760","15530820"," I'm not."
"15531280","15532700"," I'm going to put it all there."
"15532940","15536680"," So what the trade is is we are. "
"15537260","15538500"," We are going to."
"15538720","15539000"," Let's go."
"15539420","15542000"," We are going to sell a 225 call. "
"15542000","15545520"," And we are going to buy a 225 call."
"15545660","15547120"," We're going to sell the one for this Friday."
"15547720","15549740"," We're going to buy the one for next Friday. "
"15551020","15552400"," And I'm not saying do this."
"15553080","15555640"," I'm saying, this is a confidential advice."
"15556800","15557200"," Right. "
"15557760","15559320"," I'm not going to play this to me."
"15559400","15561020"," They're like, you told me this."
"15561140","15562540"," I'm like, did you take the other five trades?"
"15562840","15563000"," No. "
"15563960","15566540"," It took the one trade that I wanted to take that you're taking."
"15566540","15566820"," Yeah."
"15568140","15570460"," That's my whole account that I'm like, can't do that. "
"15570620","15575020"," So this is a percentage of maximum risk."
"15575700","15580660"," So as of right now, if it ends at $225."
"15582420","15587600"," On expiry, that would be a 444% gain on the position. "
"15588740","15589800"," As an example."
"15590360","15594800"," Now, if you see the one right above it, 225 75 strike, if it goes up there."
"15595380","15596680"," You make less money. "
"15597740","15601400"," Because now your soul strike is going in the money."
"15601960","15606880"," So if your soul strike starts going in the money, you might just want to call that and, you know,"
"15607000","15607740"," close out your position."
"15608160","15608900"," Tell them why though. "
"15609120","15613340"," Tell them why when something goes into the money, what can happen if you go too deep in the money?"
"15613660","15623100"," If you end up going too deep into the money, your intrinsic on the call sold is not going to"
"15623100","15623660"," outpace."
"15626320","15630780"," The value of the time that you have for the extra seven days."
"15630800","15632720"," There's some assignment risk too, right?"
"15632940","15634060"," Yes, that's very true. "
"15634220","15635980"," Somebody can be like, I want to buy this right now."
"15636140","15637140"," It's selling to me right now."
"15637260","15640700"," And then you're kind of boned. "
"15640780","15642540"," You can like lose a lot of money that way."
"15642680","15647680"," So a calendar spread, just look at, look at this, right?"
"15647960","15649680"," Like let's say tomorrow."
"15649680","15655800"," So if there is a 23rd tomorrow on the 24th, the price is at 225. "
"15656760","15659200"," If you sell that right now, according to this."
"15660860","15667220"," You will make 91.4% of the risk money, like the money that you risk, you will make $127."
"15668420","15670140"," I got to stop in for, I apologize. "
"15670420","15671280"," I have to interrupt really quick."
"15671460","15672500"," Just a heads up here, guys."
"15673420","15674940"," Coming into 153 PM. "
"15675460","15683260"," If you're on a QQ chart with half our bars, I want you to focus on this last half hour"
"15683260","15683920"," bar here."
"15684120","15684300"," Okay."
"15684860","15685600"," I have it. "
"15685880","15686400"," Thanks."
"15686560","15687160"," I appreciate it."
"15687240","15690900"," And this, so watch this last half hour bar here on the QQs. "
"15691240","15693900"," The bulls here must get a new high here."
"15694540","15698960"," I would, my preference here is that the bulls on Qs get this new high."
"15700960","15702620"," On this half hour bar. "
"15702820","15706780"," If they fail to, there could be a capitulation move to the downside."
"15706780","15709020"," So at least, at least this green candle."
"15709760","15711420"," I want to see price on that. "
"15711680","15720770"," I would prefer to see price above at minimum, above 4.22.20. They don't, but I don't want to"
"15720770","15727510"," see it any lower than 4.22.20. And my preference would be that we're above 24.22.60 for"
"15727510","15729430"," a ramp into the end of the day today."
"15729630","15732250"," So just keep your eyes on this at home."
"15732590","15735670"," So yeah, because bulls can't be losing this stuff here. "
"15735670","15740270"," You've got a, the first high was back on the 1230 candle."
"15740910","15745610"," The sellers tried to, tried to take out the next candle and failed."
"15746110","15752890"," And then the prior half an hour, we came all the way back down and tested 42, 41.80. So"
"15752890","15758410"," this closing bar here, you really, you know, because they can pin this market right in the close or"
"15758410","15761650"," even roll it down and some weakness into the, into the day here. "
"15761790","15764510"," So pay attention to this two o'clock hour here."
"15764510","15765590"," What happens here in queues?"
"15766030","15766230"," All right."
"15766350","15766370"," Sorry. "
"15766490","15766690"," Go ahead."
"15766870","15767590"," Go back for your."
"15767710","15768710"," Well, no, I'm always. "
"15768950","15769870"," I'm listening."
"15770330","15772350"," I'm enjoying this as well."
"15772850","15777130"," I do have a call wall at four 24 for the queues. "
"15777370","15779570"," And that comes from existing positioning."
"15779570","15781190"," Like that's like max upside."
"15781650","15784830"," As of this moment, you kind of want this to get rolled up. "
"15785290","15792150"," We have right above at four 24 67 ish."
"15792150","15794210"," We have a big call."
"15794810","15796330"," A combo level. "
"15796330","15798390"," And that's where we bonked off of yesterday."
"15798390","15800370"," Like that was there right now."
"15800750","15801250"," Yeah. "
"15801490","15804590"," So let's, the queues are supposed to go sideways."
"15805350","15806290"," That is the."
"15806470","15812410"," Because what is happening is that what we should start seeing is like XBI. "
"15812870","15815850"," You start seeing IWM start to pop."
"15816250","15819750"," And we should see the queues start to."
"15828750","15829870"," So that. "
"15831230","15832950"," So what I'm saying is."
"15834450","15835450"," It's just kind of."
"15835590","15836150"," Yeah. "
"15837970","15839550"," And so I'm, I'm kind of."
"15839930","15840650"," The supply."
"15841110","15842430"," They're right. "
"15842810","15843370"," Yep."
"15843670","15846390"," And you know, like that's the five minute trigger at four 22."
"15846950","15848270"," That's also four 22. "
"15848550","15849530"," Also happens."
"15849530","15849730"," So that."
"15849730","15849830"," That's an end key. "
"15849830","15851010"," That's to be a combo level."
"15851730","15852990"," Of options across."
"15854350","15856970"," KQQ and the NDX and NQ. "
"15857370","15858410"," So that L three."
"15858950","15860050"," So that's, that's a."
"15860270","15861390"," That's a pin area."
"15862310","15865170"," Like we should go sideways or downwards, but. "
"15865490","15866650"," I this is where we should stay."
"15867110","15872510"," We should start seeing like XBI start to pump a little bit and we should start seeing IWM start to."
"15872510","15881930"," always I tell people is keep an eye on Dixie Dixie has been the canary in the coal mine for"
"15881930","15890470"," equities if Dixie is rising chances are we are not going to have as much upside"
"15890470","15897370"," as we expect so anyways the ground is still going Vix is still dying so"
"15897370","15907290"," yeah Dixie is going and you know let's look at TLT TLT is not having a good day guys"
"15907290","15914510"," so if there is a ticker that you think we should watch on four screens for the end of the"
"15914510","15921790"," day for ER reports what do you think we should put up for ER reports let's see who well out"
"15921790","15929810"," of the ones that are reporting today yeah I don't think who is that Texas Instruments I think Texas"

"15944650","15952190"," logged in right now direct it's a chat I think it's crushed on the long link more than the options"
"15952190","15958350"," profit calculator shows yes that is true it can get crushed it says I think when you look at their"
"15958350","15963370"," two minutes left watch out we're looking for this new high SPX look spy trying to get that high in"

"16024330","16031670"," mark it up is not necessarily a bad thing yeah if Dixie goes down too far it's really bad for"
"16031670","16036650"," the mark believe or not yeah so because here's a thing that means people are abandoning the dollar"
"16036650","16042310"," in the US market and right now Dixie going up and market going up means that people think that the"
"16042310","16051350"," best quality globally in stocks and equities and and that so you want me to put this America they"

"16369610","16379530"," so it is been benefiting it bounced on the weekly trigger and it went"
"16379530","16389430"," up you know 10 bucks could do some rudimentary TA here but kind of up against that"
"16389430","16398390"," trend line that's not good it's not bad either but this kind of looks like a kind"
"16398390","16407630"," of looks like range this bigger and"
"16407630","16416750"," you could do more TA on it but yeah no it's I don't know TA wise doesn't look doesn't look"
"16416750","16426529"," too promising so calls are coming in now and puts were being sold but people are also"
"16426529","16434869"," buying puts so this is like earning stuff starting to happen since like 1 45 or so oh they're above"
"16434869","16441330"," their call wall so they are naturally what I would say is extended but here's wait I need to go"
"16441330","16447150"," back at this we need to look at some history of this because that'll give us an indication of how"
"16447150","16456990"," things that have been positioned over time TXN history let's make it bigger can you guys see"
"16456990","16466890"," this now so I'm gonna put the cues up for the clothes"
"16466890","16475169"," I'm gonna put spy up for the clothes all on the one-minute triggers and for earnings today after"
"16475169","16484070"," the bell and then I'm also gonna put up Netflix and FLX and we got Netflix up here for the"
"16484070","16493730"," clothes they're parked on their hourly trigger ISR G you guys want to do"
"16493730","16503590"," ISR G yeah okay so what I kind of want you guys to kind of look at"
"16503590","16512290"," this history tab that I have here the call wall has kind of stayed steady at 175"
"16512290","16522210"," the key and the last like spree up to 175 and the key"
"16522210","16529150"," gamma strike has gone up from 160 to 175 so 175 across the three like everything has rolled up to"
"16529150","16536050"," it and that is what is confirming a you know pretty strong gamma to me like it's like this is"
"16536050","16541410"," where like peak delta is peak well not peak delta like it's above this dealers have to chase delta"
"16541410","16546790"," dealers have to chase gamma the call wall is right here so this is like the biggest call"
"16546790","16555890"," concentration let me ask you a quick question here what's up make a call on network all right sorry"
"16555890","16561570"," sorry let me keep doing you're doing I apologize I'll ask you two questions when you're done yeah"
"16561570","16567490"," for sure and and then if you look at the put wall the put walls rolled up from 150 to"
"16567490","16575470"," 172.5 I don't like that that's a very narrow range that's happened this means that there has been"
"16575470","16583110"," some like put selling that has happened in the last day but that means somebody's looking for a pop"
"16583110","16593050"," and this might not stay generally everything going up is bullish but this like the"
"16593050","16599950"," range being essentially what it's telling me is 14 175 and 175 that is very suspect to me and this"
"16599950","16606029"," is again I'm looking at PXN I need to make the smaller guys just so I can read this a"
"16606029","16614090"," little bit better fixed strike matrix yeah there's more reaching for calls up here to today that"
"16614090","16622250"," doesn't really tell us anything it's volatility skew is insane like yeah people are deaf and it's"
"16622250","16632869"," pretty it's a smile there's no edge here looking at all of this for TxN yeah anyways"
"16632869","16642730"," you were asking okay so don't like if you're listening out there right now don't be like hey"
"16642730","16650730"," they called this they called that I'm this is more like shit a little second I'm doing something"
"16650730","16660050"," background I want you guys or how about this fair podcast if you had if you had to say Netflix"
"16660050","16669890"," ER and guidance do they beat on their ER don't worry about it just send"
"16669890","16675450"," you're just like off the cop like putting you in a position right now do you feel like or do"
"16675450","16683430"," you think they beat ER or there and then do they they have good guidance or bad guidance so here's"
"16683430","16691830"," what I'm gonna say yes so I'm gonna say they're gonna"
"16691830","16699849"," slightly beat ER they're gonna be small beats on EPS and guidance but it's not gonna be as big as"
"16699849","16706770"," what the market is pricing in so do you think ultimately the Netflix is down or up in the open"
"16706770","16714509"," tomorrow so we talked about that earlier and you know it's kind of like what I like seeing like"
"16714509","16720830"," okay so if you can see my screen right now cap yeah I'm watching 500 is like the call wall"
"16720830","16728810"," right but what I really like is all of this you know build up of calls above the 500 strike"
"16728810","16733009"," we're trading you know I think you're trading like 490 or something like right around there is that"
"16733009","16738290"," right I'm a student now 489 parked right on that hourly trigger right now yeah man so 490 if you"
"16738290","16744050"," see like right here there's like a big call gamma but this call gamma 495 there's a big call gamma"
"16744050","16752890"," at 500 so everything above like 485 like there's attraction to the upside in chasing right you have"
"16752890","16757710"," the deal is helping out exactly the dealers will have to help us a lot of them have sold these"
"16757710","16764689"," calls right so right and then and but and over here too there's you know above the 490 strike so"
"16764689","16773090"," I'm my cursors on 490 right now everything you see above the 490 strike the blue stuff that's puts"
"16773090","16780650"," these are gonna start losing value there is a lot of thrust up to 500 right and I could see"
"16780650","16788050"," that happening but unless it is and this is where like the steepest move is on this gamma curve as"
"16788050","16794410"," well so up to 500 but then it starts slowing down and so what I'm trying to say is if"
"16794410","16802810"," earnings are not bumper right these calls they're not gonna like have much of an impact there's the"
"16802810","16810130"," only time the impact starts happening is like oh my god we underpriced Netflix too much and we need"
"16810130","16814770"," to chase with these calls and then you get an explosive move and you're looking at like like I'm"
"16814770","16820670"," looking at 550 as a target there because there's plenty of gamma like there's plenty at 510 there's"
"16820670","16826530"," plenty if I you know this is 510 this is 520 this is 530 there's plenty of stuff there you"
"16826530","16832950"," know like they're gonna be like okay let's go let's start the chase but the issue is looking at"
"16832950","16841370"," this the last time I saw something like this was at an ER for for NVIDIA the last ER and"
"16841370","16848650"," the it was around the 500 dollar strike there was just calls on either side and the 500 dollar"
"16848650","16855230"," strike was like monumental and they had a good ER but it wasn't as great so price fell a little"
"16855230","16859290"," bit you know like they popped a little bit but the next day of price retreated it did not go"
"16859290","16867490"," up above 500 significantly so that's what I'm concerned about all right I want your I want your I"
"16867490","16873690"," want you to tell me is Netflix going up and be green in the open tomorrow or not oh my"
"16873690","16880210"," god answer the but you can be wrong dude don't do this is the magic of streaming are we fucking"
"16880210","16888310"," gonna be green tomorrow Netflix or not okay we're gonna be about 419 about 490 on the open tomorrow"
"16888310","16894130"," good good no we're gonna be above 490 tomorrow okay so above where we are like that's that's I want"
"16894130","16898630"," to say that all right cool see that where we are right now like what options is looking like we're"
"16898630","16905730"," gonna be above that experience everything you look at ads on your own what is your call it's okay"
"16905730","16914740"," to be wrong I get the shit wrong all the time man if I was playing if I was playing"
"16914740","16924560"," Netflix for earnings I would be selling a next"
"16924560","16932960"," week 520 5 5 30 spread cool that's what I'm like"
"16932960","16940560"," I would take that position because to me that's like a less risky position than expressing an"
"16940560","16947440"," upside or downside I think there's gonna be a measured upside so I can capture some some value in a"
"16947440","16954280"," credit call spread so that's that's the way I would look at it like right here like these two nodes"
"16954280","16963320"," is what I would be targeting 525 30 so I think they're generally in line with their reports I think"
"16963320","16972820"," their guidance is gonna be really good I think about tailwinds with the tailwinds with the strikes"
"16972820","16982760"," and then yeah so the thing is they they released bad news yesterday yeah right and"
"16982760","16987800"," they released good news today yeah so what are they gonna release during ER everything is getting"
"16987800","16993160"," priced in right now and there's still so many calls above and that's why I'm like oh I don't know"
"16993160","16999760"," like that and they need to like go in and really nail you know the guidance and you know basically"
"16999760","17003620"," said like we had a bump a year and we're gonna have a bump a year for the next three"
"17003620","17013380"," years and then then the chase starts right right now given how the action has been given how you"
"17013380","17020560"," know 500 is the call wall and the way the option structure just looks man that just looks to me"
"17020560","17026080"," this looks to me like this is this is trying to like the options faders are trying to price a"
"17026080","17035440"," much bigger move like in EPS and in guidance then then what the"
"17035440","17040800"," what the consensus is but we've already moved up so much I don't know if that's really gonna happen"
"17040800","17044560"," so that's that that's where I stand I know it's like it's not are we going up are we going"
"17044560","17049100"," on but you know like I think I think that I think they don't I think that people like we"
"17049100","17054540"," there's so much mincing of words out there in general protect you what you say all that kind of"
"17054540","17060800"," stuff that there's I think people here tend to like a simplified answer like what's your take like"
"17060800","17068980"," we can I can I can sell you the up and down all day long be evasive but myself for"
"17068980","17075880"," for Netflix I think the initial reaction is gonna be flat to down but I think the guidance is gonna"
"17075880","17080220"," come out it's gonna it's gonna be ripping into the open tomorrow and then what are your thoughts on"
"17080220","17085700"," intuitive surgical because I think that they embarrass on them into their ER say after the close"
"17085700","17092120"," I'm bearish on intuitive flat to bullish on Netflix though I agree with you on that on the options"
"17092120","17098040"," saying they need something they need to beat big on they need a big beat big on their reports then"
"17098040","17104140"," their guidance needs to be out of this world yeah it has to be or it gets me priced yeah"
"17104140","17109900"," and that's where like I'm trying to say like this is trying to price in a much higher upside yeah"
"17109900","17114820"," then then you know I think it's possible one of the notes to all of you out there too is"
"17114820","17122320"," as we come into this close here it's now 218 but there's oftentimes into these reports a pinning"
"17122320","17128500"," action on the indexes so be careful you might see like a squeeze in the individual tickers as they"
"17128500","17134560"," report or a bloodbath into their reports but then you'll see is like a like a sideways and down"
"17134560","17140120"," action to the indexes if they can get impacted from some of these reports Netflix should impact"
"17140120","17147600"," cues and spy so you may not want to be even trading that until 401 believe it or not you"
"17147600","17153800"," see like bloodheading down in a four if you do see blood heading down into 401 p.m. somebody's"
"17153800","17163810"," sending puts on somebody's sending puts on the XX now nice that's what's"
"17163810","17172590"," good this is no this is this is interesting we are picking up flows of non-SPX put variety"
"17172590","17178910"," you know because that's telling you puts are not gonna pay the implied volatility chart like this"
"17178910","17187990"," is telling me puts are not gonna pay right now and so whoever is doing this whoever is"
"17187990","17196930"," trading the VXX is saying that okay puts might not pay straight up but I think volatility is gonna"
"17196930","17206750"," pay me straight up so Netflix good continue no if Netflix dies I think markets and the"
"17206750","17213730"," tech earnings are not gonna go well yeah with or at least two years ago right yeah yeah yeah see"
"17213730","17219670"," it be so about to say stupid shit about yeah they're gonna say like oh no you know is this"
"17219670","17225510"," the end of streaming you know like Disney's gonna take a dick if that happens Google might take a"
"17225510","17230430"," dick too because YouTube is one of the only like money-generating places they have right now"
"17230430","17237150"," because search is getting price into their earnings now and then of course you get the reports and"
"17237150","17243330"," they blast off again yeah and that's that's the narrative that has been there in the market like we"
"17243330","17247590"," are too low like expectations are too low except for Netflix because they released a bunch of"
"17247590","17255350"," information before so you know it's like ripping into it but see that's it's the it used to be like"
"17255350","17260570"," everybody like really paid attention in Netflix and this was like during COVID time and like COVID"
"17260570","17267050"," time everybody paid attention because the way Netflix went was the way Google was gonna go was the"
"17267050","17271210"," way you know like advertising was gonna go because it's essentially what it is like how much screen"
"17271210","17277550"," time is like the average consumer spending on screens and how much of their attention we get here"
"17277550","17286130"," it's essentially that's what like that's what it's telling us and so I I think people are gonna"
"17286130","17291630"," remember that again especially because Netflix is now back at the levels it was right now it's"
"17291630","17298750"," seven percent and or the expected move is seven percent move right and then I'm looking I'm gonna"
"17298750","17306950"," check their history right now to see what so they tend to they tend to follow their report pretty"
"17306950","17314190"," big in a big productive way up or down Netflix does right historically and I'm looking at their"
"17314190","17322970"," historically ours right now and they tend to Netflix tends to follow their trend as well so they're"
"17322970","17328310"," prior if Netflix is heading higher they tend to after their ER continue higher or if they're"
"17328310","17337610"," tending to go down they tend to go down not every example but I'm looking back here into January of"
"17337610","17347570"," 2022 and they tend to follow their super trend right so this was their last see when they had"
"17347570","17353970"," the last earnings that I have on here yeah it just kick started like a bull run like that's one"
"17353970","17358910"," example where it went the other direction but the other like nine or ten like of the like like nine"
"17358910","17363430"," last nine or ten reports they stayed right on trend actually that was on trend right there too so"
"17363430","17368730"," yeah I might have been wanting on trend ones yeah and then this one was like you know popped and"
"17368730","17379050"," then set up a bear plane into the next earnings so yeah they will like you're right like once"
"17379050","17386210"," this one when you know was decent earnings or not but it kind of like the weekly picked it up"
"17386210","17392810"," and took it high to the next earnings now here's a thing we're let I'm gonna try something I'm"
"17392810","17401290"," gonna look at something really really quick this earning bad all the way down and then this earning"
"17401290","17411010"," bad all the way down this earning good so bad bad good good bad well this is good but"
"17411010","17420650"," it's indecisive good bad and now good and so the thing is do we get good or bad and"
"17420650","17429270"," huh we are three ninety three is the monthly trigger three four thirty nine is is the weekly"
"17429270","17435490"," trigger and we are above the daily so just seeing if you just think of this I like to think"
"17435490","17440330"," of this as like super trends as well I know that's not necessarily what the trigger is for but this"
"17440330","17445490"," to me like kind of tells me that there is move to continue hugging and keep going yeah those those"
"17445490","17450210"," triggers do match up to that too so you do have super yeah and you there's some other key points"
"17450210","17456890"," on that if price is above that that blue that blue line is your bull mark or is it for"
"17456890","17461530"," the individual ticker prices below it you're in a bear market for that ticker price above it you're"
"17461530","17467030"," in a bull market for that ticker then you the orange line is the weekly that's the emotional line"
"17467030","17475570"," you'll see people get really frisky when prices below it or prices stretching past it right now"
"17475570","17480850"," we're winding up and above all of those lines we're generally bullish here even if we have a bad ER"
"17480850","17487070"," on on Netflix unless unless they break below that monthly trigger they are in a bull bull run right"
"17487070","17492410"," now there it's everything's positive right now in them right exactly and then you've been intraday"
"17492410","17497350"," and weekly trends on the daily and hourly that's where you get like your one month weekly intraday"
"17497350","17507170"," kind of stuff right so we so with Netflix I think you know that's an interesting ER ISRG I think"
"17507170","17512710"," so you'd be hoping today if you'd have a I guess my point on that would be you're in a"
"17512710","17518190"," positive environment with Netflix right now they don't have a completely fucking awful reports or"
"17518190","17526030"," guidance and it still sells off for what he just showed on that chart you'd be looking to buy that"
"17526030","17531090"," dip you pick like right a hundred tickers and you're like okay I got a hundred tickers in front of"
"17531090","17537810"," me I know what tickers are bullish or bearish and if I get a report that's not so bad look"
"17537810","17542110"," for an entry I'm definitely an AMD trade like that when they didn't bring up AI and then a week"
"17542110","17549350"," later they did they sold their fucking ER this is two or three reports ago they sold their ER and"
"17549350","17553630"," they didn't mention AI right then a week that it was like all these there's like huge short"
"17553630","17558910"," entrance short interest to cover a day or two later then they drop the AI shit and it was by"
"17558910","17564330"," the dip and run with it so when we were questioning that as well like why did they saw this"
"17564330","17568090"," ER and it had it was more of a function of the options market and you should have still bought"
"17568090","17572650"," that dip and Netflix to me would be one of those tickers if it does sell the flows that you'd"
"17572650","17577210"," still yeah no I think I think they're making good decisions right like they had spent so much money"
"17577210","17583450"," they were not getting you know like the revenue from there in from their previous price right there"
"17583450","17589190"," your price that took the ticker so yeah they went through it through a correction fuck yeah yeah so"
"17589190","17596470"," but again I think it's gonna break 500 so well you know Joe donut told me that an video I"
"17596470","17602050"," remember the beginning of the NVIDIA run they said everyone or everyone out there said it's a scam"
"17602050","17606550"," right it's it's gonna get repot go back down to zero and stuff and I was like yeah but not"
"17606550","17613590"," before it hits six 700 bucks people like get that ain't ever happened and so did I ever tell you"
"17613590","17619730"," when I opened my NVIDIA position no no no no tell me no so I opened my NVIDIA position the"
"17619730","17629310"," day I made my first deep fake I was like all right you know if I can do this sitting"
"17629310","17634430"," in my home now I have a nice computer like I work with you know big data set so I"
"17634430","17640830"," have like a nice computer and I have a nice graphics card in it and I made this first deep"
"17640830","17648550"," fake and I was like if I can do this in like a year everybody can do this and it"
"17648550","17655170"," was actually a year ago a year ago like four or five days ago that I made my first deep"
"17655170","17662050"," and you know really a year ago four or five days ago yeah congratulations man yeah yeah so that's"
"17662050","17668230"," when I open that that's when I open my NVIDIA position and I've been an invidious since then"
"17668230","17676290"," because I see the value you know everybody says this AI thing is a fad dude like give me like"
"17676290","17683750"," some Celsius and like five days and I could build a company that provides marketing copy generates"
"17683750","17690590"," images writes newsletters for you and I could you know just I could just make your entire mark like"
"17690590","17698330"," half of your marketing department obsolete yet dude this is you know it's weird we're don't I were"
"17698330","17702390"," talking about this too we were like you know this isn't the phone this isn't a car this isn't a"
"17702390","17711130"," media car yeah excuse me this isn't the no we're gonna see that yeah like it's the only thing that"
"17711130","17720730"," I see for a black swan is if either the UN or a nation state puts major controls on a"
"17720730","17728150"," chip producer or AI for their country specifically like the United States the US is arguing that"
"17728150","17733910"," you the EU might try to do that yeah you know but you know what that's fine they'd probably the"
"17733910","17741290"," first ones right if there was a group but that's fine they'll all use those services anyways yeah I"
"17741290","17748650"," get that like an event like something happens due to AI or is blamed on EI AI excuse me that"
"17748650","17754030"," would be the only those are the two real risks to the price of AI but other than that I"
"17754030","17760550"," mean the door has been kicked down right the door has been kicked in and it's the future it is"
"17760550","17765930"," the future or at least my view is right yeah see I use chat GPT every day you know like"
"17765930","17769950"," I do a bunch of programming I'm like kind of sitting here like talking to you guys say but I"
"17769950","17775410"," do a bunch of programming and I'm not a programmer I just use chat GPT as like my repair programmer"
"17775410","17783990"," the flows are coming in guys like this is looking very bullish to me now we are negotiating you"
"17783990","17788530"," know the 30 minute trigger and you know we're kind of back checking the five minute now we're like"
"17788530","17794230"," getting ready to look at that there's like no more puts coming in and that's my indicator if"
"17794230","17797870"," somebody thought market was going down they'll be buying puts right now nobody's buying puts right"
"17797870","17806010"," now so all right so you guys there any more questions you want to see a video podcast coming on"
"17806010","17815930"," what do you guys got out there this guy that will venture close off right then party on guard and"
"17815930","17822050"," you know what I am okay with the computer being an overlord I am as long as they keep us"
"17822050","17830590"," yeah as long as you know they'll be consistent though with their decision-making there's that I"
"17830590","17837550"," always wonder about that dude it's like how do you make profit if like it's like how do you make"
"17837550","17845050"," profit if everything is defined it's like the like having an AI attorneys right well see here's the"
"17845050","17854130"," thing to like we're to find outcomes yes and no because the thing is we cannot understand the"
"17854130","17860450"," internal logic of a lot of machine algorithms machine learning algorithms right we can't understand"
"17860450","17866170"," logic because our brains are not wired or programmed to visualize multiple connections I think"
"17866170","17872270"," there was like a study done in 1960 that kind of like looked at hey how much information can humans"
"17872270","17878450"," hold in their brains at any given point of time and depending on the person it was either between"
"17878450","17883990"," four pieces of information or 12 pieces of information and they kind of average that out to be like"
"17883990","17888050"," okay what seven to eight pieces of information is what you can keep in your mind at any given point"
"17888050","17894930"," of time so if there is a lot of data that is being fed into machine learning algorithm right and"
"17894930","17900450"," it's using like hundreds of connections and hundreds of you know relationships within the data to"
"17900450","17905810"," like come out with an output there's no way a human brain can understand that we can't visualize it"
"17905810","17909950"," we can't do it so what will always happen is people will say that machine learning algorithms and"
"17909950","17915650"," these AI technologies are black boxes and they are because we can't visualize them but and the the"
"17915650","17921970"," problem occurs when based on the data and you know like something like small being changed within"
"17921970","17928650"," the data right you get a vastly different result you know like saying the algorithm if it's a"
"17928650","17934150"," trading algorithm saying like buy instead of a similar situation which is everything is the same"
"17934150","17938690"," but let's say like the VIX is like off by like 0.05 and it says no this is a"
"17938690","17945650"," buy now instead of a sell so you know the human cannot attribute like why is it telling me one"
"17945650","17949930"," thing versus the other when like consistency is like what I really look for and this is what a"
"17949930","17954410"," machine learning algorithm is supposed to do so that's because the internal relationships are"
"17954410","17958530"," changed would it still give in to play then the human aspect let's say it to it let's get an"
"17958530","17965030"," attorney that was a AI and then you had a DA that was an AI and they were running different"
"17965030","17973850"," outcomes do you think that as a DA you would want access to a defense attorney's AI so that you"
"17973850","17978290"," could run their probable outcomes as well or no do you think that then begins to muddy the outcome"
"17978290","17984590"," hmm they're like how's DA they will I can run all this through and find out if we're gonna win"
"17984590","17994370"," or not this case or not that's interesting right so the thing that I will go back to"
"17994370","18001750"," is where it was in Jersey where they started using AI to determine if you were gonna get bail or"
"18001750","18007330"," not yeah I don't know you heard about this yeah happen a few years ago right so the issue becomes"
"18007330","18014210"," is like what is that algorithm being trained off of and what they found like they actually did that"
"18014210","18018330"," for a little while and they found that hey this AI algorithm is basically saying that if you're"
"18018330","18023150"," African American you're not getting bail and that was because historically the data that had been"
"18023150","18031570"," given to it like fed into it had you know higher instances of African Americans not being given"
"18031570","18039870"," bail and even though it does not use if they said it is it is blind to race but they"
"18039870","18044490"," were giving it information like with zip code that the crime occur and that this person is like"
"18044490","18051610"," used up which zip code did they live in and then you know if you look using historical data they"
"18051610","18058030"," would you know be like oh with this person who lives in a predominantly black neighborhood and the"
"18058030","18063890"," crime occurred in predominantly a black neighborhood historically we haven't given that person a"
"18063890","18072990"," bail you know it's wild yeah so they basically ended up you know rejecting that not doing it that's"
"18072990","18078830"," well like you know data integrity and you know like AI safety became like a clarion called you know"
"18078830","18086970"," like this is what we need to look for but it's fascinating I think an application like that of AI"
"18086970","18095710"," where like the AI is the DA and then other AI is a it is your defense"
"18095710","18102890"," lawyer I think those are there's this more stuff we need to do there's more data we need to do"
"18102890","18107470"," there's a lot more like things we need to feed it before you know like it becomes usable where it"
"18107470","18113730"," is usable right now is if you're sitting and you want to start a company or a trading firm and"
"18113730","18119490"," you want to use the like you know file the paperwork chat GPT will help you file the paperwork or"
"18119490","18126150"," an AI from like something that allows you to you know that's been trained on you know standing up"
"18126150","18133910"," businesses and whatnot will be will be helpful so what I'm trying to get at cap is that we are"
"18133910","18142170"," the best value right now is not just leaving an AI agent by itself to do something that might be"
"18142170","18150490"," subjective mechanistic projects that's fine subjective projects not so much yeah I would put that"
"18150490","18156110"," AI right in there if a bureaucracy was making a decision about your I don't know immigration status"
"18156110","18161130"," without any kind of an outside input or you're let's see you're I guess you're an approbation or"
"18161130","18165910"," something if you're arrested and they're using AI to punish you or something or manage your"
"18165910","18171030"," punishments and you had no other inputs from any other source they'd be they would use something in"
"18171030","18177350"," their own favor right at some point right right to your point on the data set collecting I noticed"
"18177350","18182650"," last week I was talking about how some of the data might not even be accurate like you're saying"
"18182650","18188230"," they can't look at race but then they're looking at demographics and postal codes you might have"
"18188230","18194070"," had a 10 year period where maybe African-Americans moved out of a neighborhood now you've got a"
"18194070","18198790"," Caucasians living in this one neighborhood and the data is good but it's not good right it's like"
"18198790","18204810"," ten-year-old census data or something like that so they could really impact decision-making and a"
"18204810","18213030"," negative light right right give you a false sense of hey they're not gonna be racist towards me"
"18213030","18216930"," because I live in this white neighborhood but then because of the color of my skin I'm gonna get"
"18216930","18221730"," fucked anyways right or something like that right right and that's why I think big racism all of"
"18221730","18227210"," that stuff is like subjector right and that's why I don't think we are going to see a mass adoption"
"18227210","18234390"," of AI by AI agents by themselves with autonomy in those areas and that's why I think the real key"
"18234390","18243150"," is going to be like you know how do we like put an AI agent with limited capacity to improve"
"18243150","18249010"," optimization like basically optimize a part of the task that the worker does and I think that's"
"18249010","18254130"," where you know like there was a there's a conversation piece yesterday that I read where it was"
"18254130","18262070"," like hey don't think of you know NVIDIA and AMD spending money like you're gaining data center"
"18262070","18270390"," share this is more like they are going to be gaining worldwide IT spend share and I actually agree"
"18270390","18275570"," with that statement that's why I'm like Omega Bullish on both these companies Duwapolis have"
"18275570","18282490"," existed in America and they have built America you know so you know like if you look at the oil"
"18282490","18286350"," companies the oil variants they kind of like hated each other but they work with each other Pepsi"
"18286350","18290570"," and Coke hate each other but they work with each other Mastercard and Visa they hate each other but"
"18290570","18295390"," they work with each other right so you know this is how Duwapolis are where like new industries are"
"18295390","18302590"," like built and I honestly think that there is going to be there's going to be enough of an"
"18302590","18309030"," ecosystem start building you don't get mass adoption of things unless you have an ecosystem around"
"18309030","18315550"," an innovation there's lots of studies in sociology there's studies in information technology that"
"18315550","18322030"," I've talked about this which you need is an innovation ecosystem together to really push through"
"18322030","18329350"," you know a new development and what's happening right now is the innovation ecosystem is going to"
"18329350","18335610"," be in tier 2 and tier 3 which is going to be like the software products that come along that"
"18335610","18343810"," use all this new AI technology so I see for the next four or five years a bunch of products"
"18343810","18349670"," bunch of software that comes up that incrementally you know use this AI to help out I don't know if"
"18349670","18355990"," you saw what Adobe is done with Photoshop they have generated AI without building to Adobe AI to"
"18355990","18363350"," Adobe Photoshop crazy right and so and now what that really does is like for your average you know"
"18363350","18368550"," media creator who is making like images and stuff and using Photoshop they can do that that much"
"18368550","18376450"," faster and that is the operational efficiency in like all these like small you know like niche"
"18376450","18380270"," areas that it's going to come out and it's going to be very specific we're not going to get a"
"18380270","18387230"," generalized AI but we're going to get specialized a is AI is artificial special site artificial"
"18387230","18394130"," specialized agencies and we're going to see a whole plethora of them like thousands of them for"
"18394130","18403210"," different use cases and I think that's what's gonna like really move the economy forward we are in"
"18403210","18410690"," a way in the era the next gold rush and you want to be selling picks and shovels and the"
"18410690","18420170"," picks and shovels play is TSMC is Nvidia that's my thesis and I'm gonna stick with it yeah"
"18420170","18429680"," yeah yeah yeah yeah I gotta do something here in the background"
"18429680","18438900"," that's Netflix and then we've got ISR G down here make sure everybody can see this on the chart"
"18438900","18447540"," all right I see like shovels selling the shovels and not that one no no so actually picks and"
"18447540","18454700"," shovels is the first wave and second wave play so Nvidia for the next like year or two the real"
"18454700","18464160"," money maker is the software and finding where the software or the next big software kick is going"
"18464160","18469760"," to be because that's what moves technologies you know like the internet have been around since the"
"18469760","18476580"," 70s but the internet didn't take off the AOL messenger and email became a thing and you know those"
"18476580","18483280"," are the sticky software uses of the internet like it happens to messaging you know and always you"
"18483280","18488780"," know this is gonna sound really weird pay attention to what the porn industry is doing the porn"
"18488780","18495100"," industry is always the leader yeah when it comes to the use of technology they were the first one"
"18495100","18503520"," new technology exactly they were the first ones to take you know money online so credit card"
"18503520","18508860"," processing they were the first ones to do it online they were also the first ones to have 1080p"
"18508860","18516960"," streaming video they were also the ones to do of VR 3D with no buffering issues with all that stuff"
"18516960","18523740"," they were first first first first first exactly and so keep an eye on what porn is doing and I"
"18523740","18531400"," don't know like I have like I play around with AI dick around with it all day and I know"
"18531400","18539280"," that within like two hours I could create a pipeline where every day I could create an Instagram"
"18539280","18547460"," thought doing like a stupid tick-tock dance you know she's got like you know and then just you know"
"18547460","18552040"," kind of like just having only fans page for her or whatever and just raking money people are doing"
"18552040","18557460"," that right now it only takes us about two hours to like set it up and then you know like"
"18557460","18563640"," about 30 35 minutes of processing every day and people are running farms of this you know there's"
"18563640","18569600"," there's a real concern amongst the only fans community creator community that AI thoughts are gonna"
"18569600","18574480"," make your you know typical Insta thoughts completely obsolete like why do you do that and then to"
"18574480","18582260"," top it off you can use a large language model with the Insta thought and you can have them text"
"18582260","18589600"," message back and forth with your subscribers so I was thinking about just the PayPal maybe are the"
"18589600","18597290"," online banking with using AI and lonely people are people trying to break it's like just trying to"
"18597290","18603590"," break through what they're doing I think I'm what you think you get your Twitter up right now be"
"18603590","18612310"," careful there oh sorry this is black black I follow black swan so you know like he just he just"
"18612310","18620750"," responding I was like what is that oh it's a canned response okay anyways so that is a weird to"
"18620750","18626770"," look at this weird look at we're just no no calls coming in right now but all that put all"
"18626770","18634590"," those puts being sold and market is going so there's no theater right now all right I want to say"
"18634590","18637890"," thanks for coming on today I appreciate your time I think everybody here in the stream appreciate"
"18637890","18645330"," your time as well please follow that trader podcast it's a t-r-a-d-e-r and then P "

"18653710","18662750"," on Wall Street bets he posts meme calling a meme videos usually with J-Pows some other people in"
"18662750","18669810"," there as well so you probably see his memes all over Twitter on the front page of Wall Street bets"
"18669810","18674050"," as well he's a friend of the shows we're trying to actually pull him in and try to get him"
"18674050","18679230"," here more frequently and maybe even start to do some kind of a market update kind of a thing down"
"18679230","18683870"," the road or whatever he's interested in he's on the in the chat all the time he pops in and"
"18683870","18688770"," out all day long so you have any questions for him give him a big shout out thanks for joining"
"18688770","18693110"," us something just happened with Moderna thank you so much something just happened Moderna there's a"
"18693110","18702830"," lot of and 104 is the call wall so somebody's trying to reach for that right now Moderna baby"
"18702830","18707930"," all right anyways all right thank you so much everybody have a great day all right oh let me switch"
"18707930","18713630"," back over here I put up the screener oh no did I do that wrong so right now I've got"
"18713630","18721350"," I can switch over to I can switch over to this screen right here if you want this is showing"
"18721350","18729250"," spy cues ISR G and Netflix or I can go back to the main screen and we can go to"
"18729250","18736070"," the main screen here if you want here hold on here main screen and then what I could do is"
"18736070","18744150"," come back to this chart possibly let me see if I can jump on this and make it put it"
"18744150","18752630"," back to one screener over here and they can stay on spy for a minute and then towards the end"
"18752630","18762330"," of the day we can come back to I'll pop the four pain or up four pain screener up for"
"18762330","18771410"," you guys a little bit closer to 4 p.m. does that work for you guys out there yeah all"
"18771410","18777970"," right so I'll do the mainstream for right now and at about 345 I'll switch over to the four pain"

"18782690","18792210"," more than welcome to I will put an NFLX for you on into the close here and what else I"
"18792210","18799350"," will be back with you guys at 4 p.m. for that report code for spot gamma I used to"
"18799350","18805270"," have a code for spot gamma there might be one in the description if you guys check YouTube I think"
"18805270","18811710"," I do have an affiliate link for spot gamma inside of the description of the video down below so we"
"18811710","18816030"," just go to the actual live stream there is a code let me take a peek see if I find"
"18816030","18825070"," one right now hold on here let me see if I can get a code here let me check and"
"18825070","18833070"," see if I got a code for spot gamma think of it I think that I do let me check"
"18833070","18842810"," here I think I did and then I didn't or it doesn't work anymore"
"18842810","18848670"," I don't know if this actually works let me check here I think I got one right here so let"
"18848670","18858430"," me just check and see I think I see one here hold on I'm missing some I'm I'm missing some"
"18858430","18863510"," of the chat here too I think some of you got someone just a tip they think I had a"
"18863510","18869590"," question I'll get let me get back to that here in just a second here details see what I got"
"18869590","18879390"," here spot gamma I don't know why that's not showing up I have one in the description of the videos"
"18879390","18889210"," let me here I'll let me see if I can do this this way go to my come up go"

"18898150","18907990"," maybe yeah I don't see them here"
"18907990","18917190"," I don't know why I got to think about that then if this one will hold on here"
"18917190","18926630"," more here we go I got a spot gamma link right here copy link address okay we'll turn that off"
"18926630","18933930"," and I'm gonna read there's a link to hold on here"

"19934480","19938780"," given that we are still fighting this battle with inflation I don't think we can call it over I"
"19938780","19943500"," think the Fed goes to great lengths to remind people that we can't say that it's over and so I'm"

"19987580","19992640"," quote they don't want to get into the second half of 24 and inflation is already at 2% you"
"19992640","19998160"," still haven't moved the policy right that would be too late inflation on a 12 month core basis you"
"19998160","20003020"," know could get to 2% by the third quarter of this year so I mean that's that was an"
"20003020","20009840"," influential member maybe non-voting on the Fed in this particular go-around but nonetheless there's"
"20009840","20015920"," your Fed speaker who suggests inflation is going down at a fast enough clip clip and they're going"
"20015920","20021400"," to cut rates before it gets the target they told you that themselves well like he said non-voting"
"20021400","20027160"," member we had three voting members come out and say that it's unlikely that it'll be March I guess"
"20027160","20034600"," we'll see the key to Scott is that hidden in that hidden in that December 13th notes and dot plots"
"20034600","20039720"," is that the Fed expects that we're going to get to an unemployment rate of 4.1 percent now that"
"20039720","20045520"," in and of itself has been revised they used to say mid-course but let's take 4.1 I haven't"
"20045520","20051360"," done the math the way that they have but right now at 3.7 we're still getting lower and lower"
"20051360","20057400"," claims we're still getting lower continuing claims I don't see how we get to 4.1 and I think it's"
"20057400","20063520"," incumbent upon the Fed to explain to us how we get to 4.1 percent unemployment in the current"
"20063520","20068740"," environment with financial conditions they don't need it too they don't need it to get higher in"
"20068740","20074220"," fact they don't care about that anymore what they once thought well what what what they thought"
"20074220","20078800"," doesn't need to happen they don't need to kill the economy anymore like they first thought they"
"20078800","20084640"," needed to crush demand and need to have unemployment sky rocket to kill inflation because they come"
"20084640","20090800"," to the realization that the inflation that was caused was not primarily caused by some excess"
"20090800","20096120"," demand within the economy because of the growth it was caused by existential things that happened"
"20096120","20103580"," as a result of the pandemic plus some stimulus that was piled on top of it so when you say"
"20103580","20108520"," that they no longer believe that i'm referencing notes that were from the december 13th me i'm not"

"20113000","20117960"," last three weeks i guess or four weeks so be it but i'm referencing the latest thinking that was"
"20117960","20124500"," intimated about lots of the 4.1 percent downgraded from the 4.4 percent and yes we can relitigate"
"20124500","20129960"," why the inflation was caused i think i was early on that calling for the correction in 2022"
"20129960","20136740"," predicting high-profile sharing environment at this juncture at this juncture in order for us to"
"20136740","20142360"," get down to two because we've seen a steady 30 basis points month after month we haven't seen a new"
"20142360","20147960"," paradigm shift in that right and we do need to get below 30 basis points and so we haven't done"
"20147960","20152820"," anything and i think something more will need to happen for us to have a new paradigm on that month"

"20169780","20176140"," hike before they start cutting previous to this again i always own up to what i said previous to"
"20176140","20180940"," this i did not think we were going to have cuts this year at all just because we weren't"

"20186900","20192780"," it went in october from growing 60 basis points month month over month went down to 20 it since"
"20192780","20198600"," come back but this is what could make my entire bearish thesis wrong is if the housing component"
"20198600","20205320"," was a significant way that will be enough just be careful here normally when we come up here right"
"20205320","20212400"," we're reaching up here like we are right now like the hand of god will come down supply we'll use"

"20576470","20582050"," that was one of my big concerns of 2023 is that i thought the consensus was just way too high"

"20659210","20665530"," moment on television for a very long time i want to do my very best bill more imitation new rule"
"20665530","20672630"," new rule here we go new rule in the wake of a pandemic that was a supply shock you do"
"20672630","20678430"," not need growth to slow in order for inflation to come down that's what we've learned inflation"
"20678430","20683470"," came down growth did not slow and i will tell you this scott i'm going to put up a graphic"
"20683470","20688670"," here that i believe to be wrong i have never put up a graphic i thought to be wrong this"
"20688670","20694090"," one i think is wrong this is our cnbc rapid update you're going to see two things a piece of"
"20694090","20701130"," information in this chart one economists have had to upgrade their their forecast again for the"
"20701130","20706350"," fourth quarter by one point two percentage points again for the first quarter this year by nearly a"

"20717230","20722030"," the future and it's been wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong i don't know that that slump happens"
"20722030","20727430"," again new rule you do not have to have growth come down in order for inflation to come down in"
"20727430","20732730"," a post pandemic period because greg brance this time is different that's essentially that that's"
"20732730","20738270"," essentially the argument i i was going to harken back because i've had this argument off camera"
"20738270","20745110"," with both of you both you and steve and so i i i i continue to disagree scott i i"
"20745110","20751530"," think it is only different in so far as the cycle has been elongated but yes i won't just be"
"20751530","20756510"," our word but we must see a cycle i can tell you why the cycle has been elongated it's the"
"20756510","20763870"," reason why i was largely wrong in 2023 because not only did we have the great wealth transfer from"
"20763870","20769390"," governments to companies and individuals to strengthen and fortify the balance sheet probably more"
"20769390","20775350"," strongly and more solidly than many of us anticipated but we also have the great refinance which"
"20775350","20782330"," did that as well and so we haven't seen spending come down either from a corporate perspective or a"
"20782330","20787730"," consumer perspective in the way that in the ways that one might expect half you have 500 basic"
"20787730","20792630"," points of rehights and we need that in order to get to 2% when we can move off the"
"20792630","20798150"," fed to and get onto earnings because ultimately that that's what's going to matter probably at"
"20798150","20803070"," least in the near term more than anything else brian greg makes the case that earnings aren't"
"20803070","20808850"," already not good enough they haven't started out great and they're going to prove to be not strong"
"20808850","20813530"," enough to keep this market going higher you would make the the exact counter argument to that"
"20813530","20820330"," wouldn't you i would just like it a year ago and we were right a year ago and revisions are"
"20820330","20826070"," still pretty strong and i think that comes from you know looking at the market as a total you have"
"20826070","20829930"," to take a look at the bottoms upside of things and where you see the contribution of earnings"
"20829930","20835290"," coming in from especially technology and from communication services and yes there's parts and"
"20835290","20840330"," financials that have been very strong you don't discount the consumer so i think that this argument"
"20841090","20846050"," about earnings not being strong they're just not looking at the right data just like they were a"
"20846050","20850230"," year ago and i think it's more building about the bearish narrative in terms of wanting growth to"
"20850230","20855210"," slow and i just don't see that we don't see that we see no analytical or anecdotal events of that"
"20855210","20860110"," with any of the earnings work that we do but i mean even even at your denny who's like a"
"20860770","20866730"," huge bull on the market is talking about an exuberant melt-up phase that we could be underway as we"

"20890750","20895990"," market well let's look at my forecast right two hundred fifty dollars of earnings and fifty one"
"20895990","20900850"," hundred that's not exactly jump up and down especially given the fact that the market is at highs i"
"20900850","20905250"," don't doubt we're at uh we've gotten a little bit too far ahead of our skis here i went out"
"20905250","20909210"," that we softened up a little bit but common sense that especially the second half of the years we"
"20909210","20914870"," kind of settle into new valuations and what we'd like to call year two of normalization with"
"20914870","20919630"," respect to price performance for the market being high single digit low double digit in earnings"
"20919630","20924310"," growth being that i just see that the market's probably i don't disagree a little bit ahead of"

"21458630","21464710"," right so if you think about whether as whether investors will rotate out of tech like what's the"
"21464710","21468850"," first one you're going to try to move money away from it might be Netflix so i think there's"
"21468850","21472850"," definite risk there and there's definitely been this run up on the stock it's very expensive we"
"21472850","21479110"," know that the pickup of the ad tier uh the less expensive version for subscribers has been slow"
"21479110","21485630"," does it remain that way do we have a meaningful increase in subs or not you think double-edged"
"21485630","21489810"," sword for Netflix on the ad tier now there's there's a lot of hope right they've added many you"
"21489810","21494070"," know monthly active users on the ads on the ad front that doesn't correlate one-to-one subscribers"
"21494070","21499630"," because you have many active users in one family that's one subscriber that being said their ad"
"21499630","21503190"," load according to reports i've read according to a personal experience that i've had on the ad tier"
"21503190","21508470"," is low they're not selling through the ads at a rate that you would expect them to so you could"
"21508470","21512810"," say that's going to be one or two things one it means that Netflix is just bad at selling ads"
"21512810","21516830"," or two is that they're in the early days and they need to get a sales engine up and running"
"21516830","21522470"," so ad agencies are comfortable buying and if they get to that point where ad agencies will buy then"
"21522470","21528150"," you could see much more revenue come through the ad the ad product and very interesting thing that"
"21528150","21533350"," i just read is that the ad user might even be worth more than Netflix after they've watched the ads"
"21533350","21538810"," than the subscriber user maybe something like $20 per user versus 16 so if they can fill those ads"
"21538810","21544450"," based is that's really really good news for them Jason Snipe live sports aside do they have the new"
"21544450","21550710"," content to continue to add subs the way that you would like to see happen i should also note this"

"21569190","21575730"," get i go back to the the leader in in streamers to again 250 million subscribers and when i think"
"21575730","21580930"," about creators you know looking to looking for distribution channels i think this is what this is"
"21580930","21585490"," the platform that's most attractive to them and i think that they are better positioned than the"
"21585490","21591070"," other streamers and of course the the strike from last year is a head one from all the streamers"
"21591070","21596330"," but Netflix did a lot of content spending prior to and that's why their free cash flow continues to"
"21596330","21601810"," grow because they they haven't had to spend any as much money as of late so i i continue to"
"21601810","21605770"," like the content library and i think that's an opportunity for them and it with your comment about"
"21605770","21610450"," that as well same question content yeah enough oh yeah i think so everybody else has had to deal"
"21610450","21614630"," with the situation and i've long thought that Netflix is was in the best position to handle it"
"21614630","21619290"," because they have great reality television program a bunch of great fun dating shows love us blind"
"21619290","21623430"," for instance and then they also have you on the documentary front and people are watching those"

"21900960","21906560"," the levels of the market and where we're at um you know s&p for 20 times earnings Nasdaq 28"
"21906560","21911280"," times i think it's going to be like more of a show me story um for especially those more expensive"
"21911280","21916560"," stocks in the market but there's still a lot of stocks that are dramatically less expensive than"
"21916560","21922120"," that with very um a negative sentiment still built in that really could have the opportunity to"

"21936740","21941240"," feels that way i mean certainly you can go back to the late 1990s i mean we can know s "
"21941240","21945420","&p multiples s nacdaq multiples we get into the stratospheric levels it's certainly absolutely"
"21945420","21951540"," possible but i think there are a fair number of stocks that are much closer to like being priced"
"21951540","21956260"," for perfection actually maybe even trading at more of those stratospheric valuations but i think"
"21956260","21960840"," the really interesting opportunity in this market is those companies that are less expensive that"
"21960840","21965580"," have the opportunity for earnings growth to surprise to the upside over the year ahead out of the s "

"21982560","21988900"," culprits of like the most of them are not the culprits of the i think excess evaluations that we"

"22009760","22014900"," telecommunications with Verizon's report this morning really reinforced our thesis that these"
"22014900","22021380"," companies have become just much more stable cash cows than the market had appreciated in the past"
"22021380","22026960"," and with Verizon trading at you know over a 10% free cash flow yield over 6% dividend yield"
"22026960","22034700"," with their with churn down or churn churn sorry churn stable with them taking price increases with"
"22034700","22039640"," having to give fewer cell phones for upgrades really suggest the free cash flow will expand in the"
"22039640","22044300"," year ahead so you have that stock compared to a wal-mart which has years where i mean some years"
"22044300","22048280"," they can grow earnings nicely other years like they grow earnings a bit trades at 25 times earnings"
"22048280","22052400"," like there's a lot of room for valuation expansion what's going to happen to the fed what's going"
"22052400","22056080"," to happen to the economy i don't think it's really going to have that material of a difference on"
"22056080","22061080"," Verizon's earnings and you've got a really cheap stock forward in general motors you like yes we do"
"22061080","22065740"," also like auto so in a portfolio you have you know a spectrum you have kind of your bottom line"
"22065740","22070880"," characteristics stocks have bought more ball night characters stocks that have some more"
"22070880","22076380"," cyclicality but what we really like about them and the companies we like in general is that they"
"22076380","22081060"," have the opportunity and they're not just the opportunity they are executing on their company"
"22081060","22087020"," specific business plans taking out costs improving products with an overlay of like if things"
"22087020","22091720"," actually get weaker rates go down what happens when rates go down cars get cheaper for people to"
"22091720","22096080"," buy so they kind of have a backstop if things do get a bit weaker at the same time they're"
"22096080","22101480"," both taking out meaningful costs we expect that you know we will probably see more more of that to"
"22101480","22108180"," come um and the push out of EV adoption really gives them more time to build that out in a"
"22108180","22112880"," more cost-effective manner develop products that are very competitive in the market at the same"
"22112880","22118560"," time have the benefit from their cash cows of you know that really the larger SUV vehicles in the"
"22118560","22123440"," case of Ford also commercial vehicles as well general motors with the buyback and i mean people 25"
"22123440","22128860"," percent yes 25 percent of their stock is expected this year maybe 20 percent next year it's quite"
"22128860","22135500"," substantial trading it like you know under five times earnings give me your idea though um kind of"
"22135500","22143080"," let's go back to where we started with mega caps yes are the valuations crazy no do you think the"
"22143080","22149880"," earnings are going to live up to it are we in danger of thinking that more broad market is actually"
"22149880","22156220"," going to be narrow again and if so so be it so i think you have to be like very"
"22156220","22161980"," stock specific on this right so you have in the communication services area you have you know two"
"22161980","22166520"," of those companies are you know trading at multiples just over 20 times not that much more"
"22166520","22172240"," expensive than the market like less expensive than the NASDAQ with the roads we do own we do own"
"22172240","22177540"," some so i want to yes um yeah i mean in particular we like google and we like meta um"

"22187240","22191740"," meta i think what people might miss about her maybe why it's not as expensive as some of the other"
"22191740","22199280"," stocks is ai enables them to have more rapid adoption of free content creation right their whole"

"22257000","22260780"," beginning just November i saw things are really getting bad gosh i mean it should be bearish but"
"22260780","22265800"," actually things are getting bad race came down and that was very stimulative so now we have the"
