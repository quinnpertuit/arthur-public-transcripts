"NgRbB27cIQI","479400","485400"," I don't want too many people to hear this stuff because I'm not trying to create a panic or anything like that."

"NgRbB27cIQI","534400","537400"," Dan, if you're a bear, you should watch this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","537400","549400"," If you're a bully, you should, I mean, I didn't know if I should make this and just make a post, but I didn't know if I didn't know if it was, you know, if you're a seller or a buyer, you should watch this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","550400","551400"," It doesn't matter."
"NgRbB27cIQI","551400","556400"," It's important for you to be able to manage the next week to 10 days on either side."
"NgRbB27cIQI","556400","560400"," Even if you're a great trader, bad trader, long-term investor, it doesn't matter who you are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","560400","562400"," I think this is for you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","562400","566400"," It's important for you to have this grasp of the market for where we are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","566400","569400"," And a lot of people don't make it out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","569400","578400"," I mean, I warn you of something like as trading gets more difficult as we come to a top, it's going to be a challenge."
"NgRbB27cIQI","578400","585400"," Every come to these places, bottoms, tops, rollbacks, any of that kind of stuff, this washes people out of the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","585400","590400"," So, and we see people come and go all the time over this right where we are right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","590400","593400"," So, it's critical."
"NgRbB27cIQI","593400","594400"," Yeah."
"NgRbB27cIQI","594400","597400"," I love you too, Mr. Browser."

"NgRbB27cIQI","599400","600400"," Yeah."
"NgRbB27cIQI","600400","601400"," We'll just do it for these people here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","601400","602400"," That's what I think."
"NgRbB27cIQI","602400","603400"," Centroid's lifestyle."
"NgRbB27cIQI","603400","605400"," What's going on, man?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","605400","606400"," Yeah."
"NgRbB27cIQI","606400","607400"," Thanks."
"NgRbB27cIQI","607400","610400"," Dude, I want you guys to know something else too."
"NgRbB27cIQI","610400","613400"," Recently, it's been a lot of hard work."
"NgRbB27cIQI","613400","618400"," And I feel bad because I was watching, I re-watched today's stream and yesterday's stream."
"NgRbB27cIQI","618400","620400"," And you can kind of see that I'm tired, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","620400","621400"," I didn't see it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","621400","623400"," I'm not noticing it on stream."
"NgRbB27cIQI","623400","624400"," I noticed it the last couple days."
"NgRbB27cIQI","624400","627400"," I'm like, man, I look like I'm fucking out run over by a truck."
"NgRbB27cIQI","627400","630400"," You can hear the slowness of my voice."
"NgRbB27cIQI","630400","632400"," You can hear the worn out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","633400","639400"," You can tell that I'm like, like, seven, eight hour live streams and then meetings at night"
"NgRbB27cIQI","639400","643400"," time and then work that I'm doing in the background at night time and it's just been brutal."
"NgRbB27cIQI","643400","645400"," So I appreciate you saying thank you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","645400","647400"," I appreciate you showing up, man."
"NgRbB27cIQI","647400","648400"," Centroid's."
"NgRbB27cIQI","651400","653400"," Put your members the only jacket on."
"NgRbB27cIQI","653400","654400"," What up?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","654400","655400"," Tammy, good to see you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","655400","656400"," How are you?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","656400","657400"," Thanks, Tammy."
"NgRbB27cIQI","657400","658400"," I appreciate it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","658400","659400"," I love you guys too, man."
"NgRbB27cIQI","659400","660400"," I love all of you guys out there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","660400","662400"," You guys, some of you guys are new to me."
"NgRbB27cIQI","662400","668400"," Not new like today, but this all started by a small group just like you guys, like a small"
"NgRbB27cIQI","668400","669400"," group of us."
"NgRbB27cIQI","669400","672400"," And I was trained with other people."
"NgRbB27cIQI","672400","676400"," I would have meetings with people like we're doing right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","676400","682400"," People are like big time like market makers and stuff from years ago and small trade group."
"NgRbB27cIQI","682400","686400"," And I was really upset with people that got taken for a ride."
"NgRbB27cIQI","687400","688400"," Bull's bears."
"NgRbB27cIQI","688400","689400"," I didn't care."
"NgRbB27cIQI","689400","690400"," Fire sellers didn't matter."
"NgRbB27cIQI","690400","691400"," So."

"NgRbB27cIQI","1027360","1030280"," like, I don't want to go play golf and make a deal and make this serious."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1030280","1035840"," I'd rather use a foot wedge or slam 10 balls over the water with someone I'm trying to"

"NgRbB27cIQI","1166080","1167080"," What's going on?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1167080","1168080"," All right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1168080","1169080"," Let's get this rolling here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1169080","1173080"," So this is a good place to start."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1173080","1176080"," Uh, we're going to move over to a, to a chart really quick."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1176080","1178080"," Uh, we're going to go to the mainstream."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1178080","1180080"," And we're going to talk about something here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1180080","1186080"," So, uh, I want you guys to know that for, in my investing in trading trade, I'm going to"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1187080","1188080"," invest in trading career."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1188080","1189080"," I was a retailer."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1189080","1197080"," And I spent my time, uh, learning what I thought I needed to learn about the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1197080","1205080"," And as time had passed, I had a string of professional traders."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1205080","1208080"," Now these aren't like a retail trader from home."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1208080","1213080"," These are actual professionals that work, uh, in hedge funds."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1213080","1217080"," And they spent a lot of time trying to teach me how to trade the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1217080","1223080"," And I'm at a point now where, uh, unless."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1223080","1227080"," There is information to the market that is unknown."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1227080","1229080"," And I mean really unknown."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1229080","1232080"," There's not much market information that isn't known."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1232080","1237080"," Uh, I don't put too much, uh, weight into it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1237080","1242080"," Now you may think that the market didn't or doesn't know about the one or any other news"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1242080","1245080"," that comes out when we have a rollover."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1245080","1248080"," Uh, but there are books interviews."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1248080","1251080"," You can go to, um, there's some Yale."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1251080","1254080"," Uh, yeah, there's some, uh, Yale, Harvard."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1254080","1257080"," Um, uh, what, what I call them?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1257080","1262080"," Like, um, speaking engagements where, uh, market insiders will talk about."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1262080","1267080"," Uh, how the large banks will keep offices around the world."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1267080","1271080"," Uh, you may not believe or know this, but, uh, banks are almost like the same."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1271080","1273080"," Uh, banks are almost like the CIA."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1273080","1275080"," They have people everywhere."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1275080","1276080"," They pay for information."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1276080","1277080"," They put people in places."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1277080","1281080"," Um, they pay for all kinds of different ways."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1281080","1284080"," Uh, they have offices in countries, uh, where they can make money."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1284080","1287080"," Not a lot gets past the banks."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1287080","1290080"," Uh, not, not a ton."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1290080","1294080"," So there isn't much information that gets by on a bank."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1294080","1299080"," And that's an important thing to, um, uh, to understand."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1299080","1305080"," So where we may think, where we may think that something is unknown to the markets, it's very rare."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1305080","1307080"," It's, it's something like a terrorist attack."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1307080","1310080"," It's something like the death of somebody."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1310080","1313080"," Sometimes corporations can keep things on a lid."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1313080","1319080"," Uh, an example recently would be Sam Adams kept a lid on their accounting."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1319080","1326080"," Um, department kept a lid on, uh, the mistake of going with or thinking that people would drink, um,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1326080","1330080"," uh, salt or alcohol, salt, salt, salt, salt or beverages."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1330080","1336080"," Uh, while they were out at nightclubs and then at dinner at nighttime, dinner was the big one, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1336080","1342080"," Uh, so anyways, my point here is, and even when that happens,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1342080","1346080"," whatever that action is to that unknown news,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1346080","1354080"," you can tell if it's unknown because it'll almost always retrace, even if it's going to go down or up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1355080","1358080"," Uh, it'll almost always retrace the move."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1358080","1363080"," Uh, and the, the one is a big one, especially for today. People are asking me in stream today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1363080","1369080"," Um, do you think that, uh, we can go down overnight? Yeah, we can."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1369080","1373080"," Uh, but that there will be a counter, uh, trade by market make."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1373080","1377080"," And I'm airmarking my dealers, uh, against that risk."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1377080","1383080"," And sometimes they will chase too. They will try to counter that news and they will also."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1383080","1391080"," Um, try to chase that news. If they, if there becomes a waterfall of negativity or positivity, they'll chase either way."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1391080","1395080"," Um, not if you don't understand the mechanics of this, uh, of, uh, delta hedging, but."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1395080","1402080"," The base idea here is that any known news will be hedged by dealers."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1402080","1405080"," Any unknown news they will chase."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1405080","1410080"," Uh, so people are asking, do you think we'll go down overnight? I don't think so until a certain time until we get to a certain number."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1410080","1418080"," No, we will, they will count a delta hedge until we get to, um, I believe I don't know what it is right now. We'll look at the exact number."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1418080","1434080"," We talked about it in the end of the stream today. So, uh, that leads into the next question, which is, uh, when people assign reasons for the market being down to news, generally speaking, I tend to disagree with that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1434080","1437080"," And we're going to talk about that why right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1437080","1452080"," Uh, they don't lose money. Uh, I want you to know that. Uh, sometimes they do. Um, the crash of 87, uh, market makers, floor traders, dealers. Um, uh, we're at risk of that, right? They had to make a market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1452080","1464080"," Same thing happened in 2008 and then 2000. Uh, it's famous movies about it, right? We're never going to be able to have a bond or a bank ever again. They're going to shut us down if we make this move. No one's ever going to trust you again."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1465080","1480080"," There is, it's their market, it's their garden. And as long as you are understanding of that, um, you'll start to stop. You'll, you'll start to be able to, you'll be able to say what the news is, uh, if you know where price is, does that make sense?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1480080","1486080"," Uh, you'll be able to, you'll be, you'll come to, like you'll, you kind of know we're going to roll down today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1486080","1491080"," Or we're due for one and then the news comes out after. That's not a coincidence."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1491080","1494080"," I was my point and we're to that point."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1495080","1498080"," I'm going to show you two things. So this is yesterday."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1499080","1504080"," And, uh, this is yesterday about 36 minutes into the, into the live stream. I'm not going to spend much time on this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1505080","1512080"," I'm going to post two links to it. Um, I'm going to give a post right now to two links. Here's the first one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1512080","1517080"," I'm going to send this off to you. Copy this link and watch it later."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1518080","1523080"," I'm going to show you the next link right here and I'm going to copy this link at the same time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1524080","1530080"," And I'm going to post this one in the chat with you guys and you can watch this one at a different time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1530080","1538080"," Uh, the time on this one is, uh, 141 12 and the time on this one is at 36 12. This was yesterday."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1539080","1545080"," Not today. This was yesterday. I'm going to be really brief here and play in this for you. Bring this up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1546080","1550080"," And I'm going to speed it up for you really quick to want to be clear. Let me clear about something here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1551080","1555080"," I don't know if I can do this or not, but you're going to see."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1556080","1557080"," As we get closer."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1558080","1561080"," Now, unless we have some fundamental shift from the fed."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1562080","1564080"," I want to be clear with you about something."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1567080","1568080"," I showed this the other day."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1569080","1575080"," And I want you to know something. Even if we get a pullback here today, this doesn't mean shit. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1576080","1581080"," I want you to know that the market is poised."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1587080","1589080"," These bears were wrong here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1590080","1595080"," They're wrong here. They're wrong here. Okay. And the market is poised."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1596080","1602080"," To come up and fail all time highs."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1603080","1607080"," Meet all time high. I'm going to pause that right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1608080","1611080"," Uh, this section of the video discusses."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1613080","1623080"," Uh, talking heads and influential people coming out, uh, out of the closet and saying, is it time for a correction? Is it time for the markets to roll over?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1624080","1628080"," You can go and watch this on your own. I'm not going to stay on this for long, but this was yesterday in the morning."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1629080","1634080"," And then this is the next video right here. I'm not going to leave this one on either for a long and."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1635080","1640080"," I was like, I see those in here. So we're going to take a look at what are 40 minutes of the broadcast and, uh,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1641080","1645080"," and what I want to draw your attention to is not going to pause this one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1646080","1652080"," You can watch this on your own. We're going to go over this right now, but I do want you to realize that we."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1653080","1666080"," Yesterday. I was very bearish and, um, I went into more detail later in the morning about, uh, set. We are setting up for a correction. Now we blasted off yesterday."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1667080","1670080"," Uh, but we're setting up for two things to happen. We were setting up for."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1671080","1675080"," We are setting up for a correction. We're setting up for a top."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1676080","1681080"," And we're setting up for a very influential people to come out there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1682080","1687080"," And, uh, start calling for a correction or a top. And what did we see?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1689080","1697080"," Today, uh, we saw this was six hours ago at 2 p.m. Maybe it's seven hours, but at 2 p.m. You saw Michael Barry come out and he said,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1698080","1703080"," uh, maybe it's time for a market correction. Now he hasn't been on Twitter in months."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1704080","1709080"," I think one of his I could tell me if I'm wrong here, but, um, he basically said you bought it all right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1709080","1712080"," And he shows up today at 2 p.m."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1713080","1719080"," And now we have news reasons for the market to come over. That is too much of a coincidence. Don't you think?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1720080","1725080"," Let me ask you out there watching the program right now. You don't think that's a little bit of a coincidence."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1726080","1732080"," Uh, that we're setting up for a correction. We're setting up for a top setting up for, um, famous bears to come out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1733080","1741080"," Uh, and say something. Now some bears are out there. They call it every week. Call it every day. They call it every two weeks. They call it once a month, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1742080","1752080"," And, and, uh, sure enough, we roll over today. Uh, after a huge run yesterday, we talked this morning on Twitter and said, you know, I take money and run on those opens, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1753080","1758080"," You can reposition yourself for that green bar up or we're going to roll over whatever the fuck it was. I said, but that doesn't really matter."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1758080","1764080"," What matters is these aren't coincidences and they are not news driven."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1765080","1782080"," And, uh, there's a reason for that. The computers, algorithms, these hedge funds trade based upon numbers that are almost kind of set in stone. Not exact, but kind of close to set in stone."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1783080","1793080"," And as we approach certain places, they are going to, um, say certain things. And so I want you to realize that even that rule over today is kind of expected."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1794080","1803080"," And this tweet here is kind of expected from certain people because these people are professionals. The people that taught me are professionals."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1804080","1808080"," And they are looking at these same things that I talked to you about in stream."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1809080","1823080"," They know where the pullbacks are. They know where to step in. There's a lot of bullpears out there that don't. There's a lot of bulls out there that don't, but there are professionals out there that do know where to look for this to happen."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1824080","1831080"," There's another part of this too that I want you to realize. I said this yesterday, you should watch those streams because I discussed yesterday."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1832080","1839080"," And I think that are this morning, I might have discussed this yesterday, this morning, which was there are banks out there. There are hedge funds out there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1840080","1844080"," I was talking about the market having to digest things today. Market's going to have to digest."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1846080","1850080"," I said, I'm going to stop trading today. I took some zero dates, but not trading like size, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","1851080","1856080"," And I'm like, I'm done trading today. I got made three pennies on some calls. The market was just racing up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1857080","1861080"," And my calls weren't printing anything. And I was like, I'm kind of done here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1861080","1866080"," I'll buy some dips or throw some zero dates, but basically I'm done trading the actual trading. I'm done."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1867080","1875080"," I had said that today. And I said, the reason why I'm done trading here is because the market needs to digest where we are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1875080","1878080"," Number one, without a doubt, the market needs to digest where we are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1878080","1884080"," I chart it out for you two places lower to buy the market or signposts to buy the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1885080","1902080"," And in on that topic, I also explained that there are some banks out there that will do anything and everything to not allow the market to continue to go higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1903080","1908080"," There's a lot of money and power. You will blow up these banks and hedge funds if we go higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1908080","1917080"," So while the market is digesting, the task of a lot of these banks is for them to change sentiment everywhere."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1917080","1923080"," The news, CNBC, Twitter, Wall Street, but it doesn't matter where it is."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1923080","1937080"," And they will get on publicly like Mike Barry. He owns a fund. He's president of fund, right? So these people will come out and they will do their fucking darn just right where we are right now to begin."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1937080","1950080"," And I talked about this this morning, I think, right before this even came out. These people will come out in droves to not lose their positioning to not get rolled as we go higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1950080","1958080"," So you're seeing that today, you are going to see this grow louder. I said that this morning we're going to see this grow louder as we go higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1958080","1965080"," Now, to that point, we know about this now, right? We know this is going to begin, but there's something else going on."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1965080","1971080"," And that is we are, we are actually setting up for a correction. This was yesterday."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1971080","1983080"," When you see a guy like Mike Barry saying this right today, you don't think that's a coincidence when I spend 20 minutes twice yesterday on Hey, we're setting up for correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1983080","1992080"," These guys know it. These guys trade to this system here in their hedge funds. This is what they use the shit that we use here is the shit that they use."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1992080","1998080"," And they know it's coming. So we're going to get rid of this right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","1998080","2013080"," And we're going to take a peek at something here. We reviewed this yesterday and we're going to review it again here for you. And then we're going to go through two phases here. I'm going to show you where the indexes are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2013080","2022080"," Where they can go. Why there's risk to a correction. I'm going to also talk to you about how to trade it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2022080","2031080"," When you can get bullish again to sit on your hands, if you're a seller, where to be selling all of that stuff at the end. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2031080","2035080"," So just to start the program off here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2035080","2042080"," I'm going to remove these four drawings right here. And I just want to show you something here. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2042080","2052080"," I want to show you when we begin to come inside. We start to blast up like this and you see these when we see these pullbacks here. This is a bull run right here. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2052080","2057080"," I want to draw your attention to two specific things that you were looking for."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2057080","2064080"," The first thing that you were looking for is does I'm going to keep this very simple like crayons for you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2064080","2075080"," If you see the yellow line, or if you see, I want to wait and draw attention to a few things here. Okay. Price is right there. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2075080","2081080"," Yellow line right here. Orange line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2081080","2085080"," And blue line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2085080","2092080"," Whenever we have price over yellow, yellow over orange orange over blue, we have a bull market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2092080","2102080"," Okay. Whenever we have price drop below the yellow line, but the yellow line continues higher. We have a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2102080","2107080"," Actually see it right here right correction. The yellow line is not crossing."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2107080","2114080"," The orange line right you see that. See if price dropping below the daily trigger."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2114080","2119080"," Yet no drop of the yellow line. Yellow line doesn't doesn't cross the orange right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2119080","2123080"," Do you see here how the price goes below."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2123080","2129080"," Down to the orange line yet the yellow actually comes down and then slams in over here. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2129080","2134080"," I want you to see that because you have a forewarning."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2134080","2141080"," Of a rollover in the market. If the daily trigger crosses the weekly trigger."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2141080","2145080"," I want to be aware of that. If the daily trigger crosses the weekly trigger."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2145080","2149080"," It is not good for the market as a risk off signal."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2149080","2155080"," Very serious signal to the market. If you don't see the yellow follow price down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2155080","2158080"," It is only a correction. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2158080","2161080"," I was like number one big rule here. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2161080","2165080"," Giant rule here. Even this is rule number two."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2166080","2170080"," Even if the yellow line crosses the orange line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2170080","2175080"," There is always an opportunity to exit the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2175080","2180080"," So if there is a bloodbath and you see let's say you're along the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2180080","2184080"," And you panic. So if you're if you're if you own the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2184080","2190080"," And you panic here. You would get fucked because you would have had a chance."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2191080","2193080"," For the market to come back up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2193080","2195080"," And you would have exited the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2195080","2200080"," Right here and not have lost a ton of money."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2200080","2203080"," Does that make sense to you? I need you to understand that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2203080","2206080"," So if we are in a risk off environment."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2206080","2210080"," You will still have an opportunity on a recheck."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2210080","2213080"," On a small we do this in a day trading right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2213080","2218080"," You'll see the failure and we just come back up and we fail where the original failure was."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2219080","2225080"," Even if it's only briefly. You still get a chance on a check to make sure that we're actually going back down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2225080","2228080"," I was related to like drowning a bull right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2228080","2232080"," Gonna start to roll the market over the bulls will try to buy their way back in."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2232080","2237080"," They'll fail with that little green bar that doesn't close above the crossing white and red line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2237080","2241080"," And then we start rolling down right there. They have their chance to get out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2241080","2248080"," So you have two signals that happen every single time historically."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2248080","2251080"," Okay, that I want you to see and understand."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2251080","2254080"," Now we have another we have another warning ahead of us."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2254080","2256080"," We begin to roll over."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2256080","2260080"," I want to show you those right now for where we are. This is this is SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2260080","2263080"," And I want to show you two things here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2263080","2268080"," I want to show you declining velocity on the daily here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2268080","2275080"," Whenever we have declining velocity, it's for telling that we're going to begin to roll over."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2275080","2279080"," Okay, you can see the small role right here. You can see the small role right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2279080","2283080"," And you're seeing declining velocity. We highlighted this yesterday."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2283080","2287080"," Even though price had gone up that we had declining velocity on the daily."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2287080","2295080"," And we had a peak on weekly velocity right here. We still have more room to go up over time over here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2295080","2301080"," But even though we have more time more time to go up in the next three months or six months."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2301080","2309080"," Right now we're starting to top out on the weekly and the day and we're rolling over already on the daily velocity."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2309080","2315080"," I want you to be aware of that because when that begins to happen now weekly can stay up high."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2315080","2318080"," And we can get this role down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2318080","2321080"," Right. And the market can continue higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2321080","2326080"," So right now there's no warning of a market rolling over right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2326080","2328080"," It's risk off right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2328080","2335080"," We can also tell at this moment right now that this is SPX that we still have a vertical yellow line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2335080","2337080"," We don't have any failure of the yellow line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2337080","2344080"," Yellow line's not coming down here to meet up with the weekly."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2344080","2352080"," With that said that does not mean that price cannot come down to the weekly on SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2352080","2356080"," Okay so price can actually still come down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2356080","2361080"," Slam down fail on the daily trigger and then blast down to the weekly."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2361080","2363080"," Does that make any sense to you?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2363080","2364080"," Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2364080","2365080"," Right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2365080","2368080"," And we already see the daily coming down right here right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2368080","2373080"," Whenever we see that daily come down we have big giant pushes down in the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2373080","2376080"," I want you to see that right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2376080","2378080"," See that move right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2378080","2381080"," Okay and how deep it goes matters right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2381080","2383080"," It does matter how deep that that goes."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2383080","2387080"," We are setting up for this and I want to show you dry your attention somewhere else."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2387080","2389080"," This is SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2389080","2393080"," So even if we don't get a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2393080","2396080"," You're going to get people."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2397080","2402080"," You're going to get people that are fearful up here people that have been long here right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2402080","2405080"," They're going to take some risk off the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2405080","2408080"," They're going to put that money somewhere else somewhere safer somewhere."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2408080","2409080"," That's that's cheap."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2409080","2412080"," You saw me in stream today asking about."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2412080","2417080"," Disney and asking about UPS and asking about some other tickers right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2417080","2420080"," There's a bunch of them that I was looking at McDonald's."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2421080","2427080"," I noticed today that Microsoft and Netflix and Tesla were weak."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2427080","2433080"," For us to have just even just a correction that money needs to go into other stocks."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2433080","2435080"," Okay and it has to go somewhere right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2435080","2438080"," If David leaves the market that's not a good sign right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2438080","2440080"," We can become risk off."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2440080","2443080"," Those stocks being down is fine."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2443080","2448080"," But if people are taking money risk off of those tickers it has to go somewhere else."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2449080","2452080"," There has to be some kind of rotation for that money."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2452080","2453080"," A place for that to go."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2453080","2458080"," I was a little disturbed today with so many tickers not really looking too good for that"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2458080","2459080"," rotation."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2459080","2465080"," I really want to be looking at those tickers that are unloved and people say yeah that's"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2465080","2466080"," ready for a dip by right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2466080","2471080"," I don't want to hear people say when they can say it but I don't like to hear hey Disney"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2471080","2472080"," is not ready yet right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2472080","2477080"," I want to hear like fuck yeah it's ready to go send all that Microsoft money over to"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2477080","2478080"," Disney."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2478080","2479080"," That's what I want to hear."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2479080","2486080"," Not hearing that opens us up to more risk to a correction down here on the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2486080","2491080"," Another note about this is this is we're getting close here right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2491080","2497080"," So you're going to see these knee jerk reactions as we come up into this area up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2497080","2500080"," You're going to see real fear."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2500080","2504080"," You're going to see climbing the wall of worry as we continue higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2504080","2507080"," You're going to see people be like I can't do this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2507080","2510080"," Then they're going to stare at this and see that happen right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2510080","2511080"," They're going to see this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2511080","2515080"," And they're going to panic and I'm going to draw your attention to another example of"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2515080","2519080"," this just inside of 2022 or 21."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2519080","2522080"," You can see it right back here right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2522080","2527080"," Some violent corrections towards the ends of the bull runs right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2527080","2532080"," Here's another big one a down move everyone I remember even myself."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2532080","2535080"," I was like yeah this might be the one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2535080","2539080"," I was making videos back here saying start exiting Apple."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2539080","2543080"," I need these companies that had corporate debt bonds right time to get out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2543080","2547080"," We still had a drawdown and we squeezed higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2547080","2552080"," Big huge correction here right squeeze higher big huge correction here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2552080","2554080"," This is the weekly right here right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2554080","2557080"," And then back up here again and we finally rolled over."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2557080","2564080"," So this time period here heading up to all time highs is going to become violence."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2564080","2570080"," You are going to see or hear see and experience things like Mike Barry."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2570080","2573080"," You're going to see people say get out of this market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2573080","2575080"," They are going to say this to you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2575080","2579080"," What else is fascinating here now this is SPX right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2579080","2585080"," Another fascinating part is that SPX bounced off its 20."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2585080","2586080"," Excuse me."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2586080","2588080"," This is a four hour trend chart right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2588080","2596080"," See what a cursor is for our trends determine trend for weeks and weeks and weeks in advance."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2596080","2603080"," They can last for multiple weeks one, two, three, four weeks and we bounced off our 27 EMA right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2603080","2606080"," You can see it right right to the pin on SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2606080","2611080"," I want to show you SPX on a four hour chart on what we trade."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2611080","2615080"," Okay, this is we're going to do a four hour chart right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2615080","2619080"," And I want to show you something here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2619080","2625080"," We haven't even touched our daily where we like to buy here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2625080","2626080"," Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2626080","2628080"," We haven't even touched it yet in SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2628080","2631080"," You see that for our chart haven't even touched it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2631080","2635080"," This is where we have an edge over a lot of people in the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2635080","2640080"," I also want to show you that it gets bought right in here right around this four hour on corrections."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2640080","2644080"," Here here somewhere lower start that bottoming process."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2644080","2649080"," Give us an idea that we're reversing so we can take the market long again."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2649080","2651080"," Right right in there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2651080","2652080"," Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2652080","2655080"," Now, not until we break below this yellow line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2655080","2659080"," Right and start to show the correction happening."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2659080","2662080"," Are we actually afraid of a correction happening?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2662080","2669080"," Matter of fact, sometimes when we come down here, you'll actually hear the most panic from traders and we're actually just looking to get close to it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2669080","2672080"," We're looking to get close to this yellow line right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2672080","2674080"," So we're not even there yet right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2674080","2679080"," As a matter of fact, if we if you were to begin to see this for our trend down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2679080","2683080"," You might think, oh shit, everything is doom and gloom."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2683080","2685080"," And then whoop, there's the bear."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2685080","2687080"," There's the bear trap right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2687080","2688080"," Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2688080","2690080"," And that's actually where that four hour is for us."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2690080","2691080"," We're looking to grab that and go higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2691080","2698080"," We're actually looking for the clothes underneath this to take this below this red line over here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2698080","2699080"," Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2699080","2707080"," So I want you to realize that as well for where we are now heading back over here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2707080","2709080"," We are setting up for a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2709080","2710080"," You can see it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2710080","2712080"," It's Claire's day that we are setting up for a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2712080","2719080"," There are a few things some signposts that need you all to understand that it's not going to be that fast."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2719080","2722080"," Well, before we even get there, we're setting up for a correction, whether you like it or not."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2723080","2727080"," Now we did go down today and trade the expected move for this week."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2727080","2732080"," If we are heading into a correction or even a risk off type environments,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2732080","2735080"," there are a few things that I want you to understand."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2735080","2737080"," Number one, this is a and we're going to go."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2737080","2739080"," We're going to jump between all these different."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2739080","2742080"," We're going to jump between all these different indexes here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2742080","2743080"," Number one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2743080","2746080"," We're going to go to the DIA."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2746080","2747080"," Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2747080","2749080"," And where my concern lies."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2749080","2751080"," Sorry, hold on a second here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2752080","2756080"," We're going to go to the Dow Jones industrial average."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2756080","2759080"," And this is just DIA representation on it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2759080","2761080"," This is the four hour chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2761080","2765080"," This is a major trend for Dow Jones industrial average."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2765080","2768080"," There was a small green bar right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2768080","2771080"," But we did break below the 27 EMA on it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2771080","2773080"," This is very concerning to me."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2773080","2777080"," This is also hinting towards a correction of some type in the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2778080","2782080"," We need rotation money to enter DIA blood down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2782080","2788080"," If not, if we begin to get red bars below, we can drop down in trade."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2788080","2791080"," 34, 6000 on DIA."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2791080","2792080"," That's concerning."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2792080","2797080"," We haven't seen that happen at all this year on Dow Jones industrial average."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2797080","2798080"," Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2798080","2801080"," We haven't, when we see what happens, we blast down to the 129."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2801080","2805080"," When it happens over here, we blast down to the 129, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2805080","2807080"," Have didn't touch it here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2807080","2808080"," Didn't touch it here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2808080","2809080"," Didn't touch it here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2809080","2810080"," Didn't touch it here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2810080","2811080"," But right now we did."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2811080","2815080"," This is a warning sign for the DIA for the Dow Jones."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2815080","2824080"," Even if we trade sideways, anticipating their earnings, there is some risk here to the downside due to DIA."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2824080","2826080"," Next one is going to be IWM."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2826080","2829080"," We're going to look at that one next in the same thing."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2829080","2833080"," You see the break below an IWM and it needs to recover."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2833080","2840080"," We're going to talk about the recovery in a minute, but you need to see buyers step in for both Dow Jones industrial average and IWM."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2840080","2843080"," This is where hedge funds short, believe it or not, is IWM."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2843080","2850080"," If they want to get the market down, they don't actually short the indexes directly."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2850080","2851080"," They want it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2851080","2853080"," They won't short Tesla in S&P 500 or the queues."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2853080","2857080"," They'll actually short it through small caps, small ETFs."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2857080","2860080"," It's an easier way to get the results that you want."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2860080","2862080"," And you're seeing it right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2862080","2866080"," In small caps, they have a target down below of 190.51."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2866080","2872080"," So you can see the attack already taking place by hedge funds inside of small caps."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2872080","2875080"," NQ or NDX, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2875080","2879080"," I'm going to four hour trend. Sorry, hold on a second. That's the wrong one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2879080","2886080"," On NDX on a four hour bouncing off of trend right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2886080","2887080"," Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2887080","2892080"," So SPX and DX both seem like nothing is wrong."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2892080","2895080"," Small caps telling a different story."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2895080","2898080"," Dow Jones industrial average telling a different story."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2898080","2901080"," If I was a sell side hedge fund, I wanted the market to come down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2901080","2904080"," I'd be over all of these small ETFs."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2904080","2906080"," That would be destroying small caps."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2906080","2913080"," Much easier to short, much easier to win and break and break down S&P 500 and NASDAQ this way."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2913080","2915080"," So right now, not so bad."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2915080","2917080"," NASDAQ doesn't look so bad."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2917080","2919080"," SPX doesn't look so bad."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2919080","2922080"," Dow Jones industrial average not looking so hot."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2922080","2927080"," Netflix, Microsoft, Tesla not looking so hot right now, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2927080","2930080"," Velocity is declining on SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2930080","2936080"," We already know that. We looked at that a few minutes ago."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2936080","2940080"," You're welcome, Perry."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2941080","2944080"," Are you guys getting the understanding of what I'm saying to you here at this point?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2944080","2947080"," Let me check the chat and see what you guys are talking about."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2947080","2953080"," So I want you guys to understand something here that the news is fake."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2953080","2957080"," That you're going to anticipate this over the next coming months."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2957080","2959080"," Now we are in the end of July."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2959080","2963080"," We've got not many months left right till the end of the year."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2963080","2966080"," So you're going to expect a ramp up in this talk."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2966080","2970080"," You're going to expect more volatility as we head into the end of the year."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2970080","2971080"," I want you to understand that too."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2971080","2978080"," You are going to experience volatility, not necessarily negative volatility,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","2978080","2980080"," but more volatile market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2980080","2982080"," You're going to see some decent lows."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2982080","2985080"," You're going to see some great places to buy a dip."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2985080","2992080"," And the market is going to more than likely press its way even higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2993080","2997080"," And then where does that leave you is going to be the next part of our conversation here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","2997080","3009080"," How do you navigate this marketplace if we are going to enter a phase of volatility as we press higher as we climb the wall of worry higher?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3009080","3011080"," Where do you buy?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3011080","3013080"," That becomes a big question."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3013080","3019080"," If you want to sell this market for the down moves, where do you sell?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3019080","3021080"," You're going to be asking those questions."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3021080","3026080"," Hey, I missed this today or I didn't get this this trade that we actually went down today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3026080","3039080"," 1.7% I think 1.69 technically went down 0.66, but truthfully went down 1.67 overall from the top of the key and pre market down to the bottom at the end of the today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3039080","3041080"," So it's a pretty fucking good move for bears."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3041080","3044080"," We haven't seen a move like that all year long, not one time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3044080","3046080"," I tried to measure it earlier today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3046080","3048080"," I didn't see shit like that at all this year."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3048080","3050080"," So it's a big move for sellers today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3050080","3057080"," So if you are along this market, we're going to get start to transition into what to expect here, or do you panic?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3057080","3062080"," Like if you're caught right now in spy, we're going to go to SPX and spy really quick."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3062080","3065080"," We're going to go to a 30 minute chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3068080","3076080"," Okay, now even if we recover on Monday and continue to head higher, I want you out there to understand a couple things here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3076080","3078080"," The market is still bullish."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3078080","3079080"," You can see it here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3079080","3083080"," We have a little bit of decline right now in daily velocity."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3083080","3087080"," We're not even getting started to the downside in SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3087080","3091080"," Look at that SPX on our leave."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3091080","3092080"," Hello has more can go."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3094080","3096080"," This is not a one minute."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3096080","3097080"," A fellow."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3097080","3098080"," This is another."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3098080","3104080"," This is something that I haven't shown you yet, but this is telling us the same thing that we can continue to go down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3105080","3107080"," In SPX and spy."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3107080","3110080"," We're going to look at a spy really quick as well."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3110080","3113080"," Now this is the market overall market health, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3113080","3115080"," And we continue to go down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3115080","3116080"," You can see it right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3116080","3117080"," See it right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3117080","3120080"," There's still more down that we can go see right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3120080","3122080"," Haven't even come down much yet."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3122080","3128080"," We've had great price action to the downside, but there's still more that can happen here on a downside move."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3128080","3131080"," So how do you trade this is the question."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3132080","3142080"," I'm going to tell you right now that as we get up into these higher numbers that you're going to expect larger down moves."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3142080","3143080"," Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3143080","3155080"," Closer to the daily trigger and possibly even the weekly trigger and then more violence moves higher to get a new high."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3155080","3158080"," And then more violent moves down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3159080","3163080"," And then more violent moves high to get those highs in the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3163080","3167080"," So what are you to do if you're a seller or a buyer from this point forward?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3167080","3182080"," If I was a seller or buyer, you're like, if you're a seller, you're likely going to be looking for a series of new highs up into 482470 and SPX 462."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3183080","3185080"," On on on SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3185080","3195080"," So if you're a seller, you are looking for from this point forward in my view, you're going to be looking for a new high with with known resistance heading up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3195080","3199080"," Every time you start to see us make these new highs, you're going to step into short the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3199080","3201080"," See a new high up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3201080","3203080"," You're going to step into short this market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3203080","3210080"," If you're a buyer, you're going to be looking to enter the market with risk on the daily and weekly triggers on SPX or cues."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3210080","3221080"," I don't care what it is and continue to trade this higher until velocity begins to roll over on a higher timeframe on monthly timeframes."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3221080","3224080"," And we can do this into end of year."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3224080","3228080"," Okay, so I want to bring you back here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3228080","3232080"," And just like our day trading, we're going to look at something here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3232080","3249080"," If you're a bull looking for something to buy or a bear looking for something to short, all of the lessons that I give you in the live stream hold on every timeframe hourly 15 minute, four hour, one hour weekly doesn't matter."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3249080","3259080"," So I want you to know right now that bulls do not have a trade to the upside until price gets above the hourly trigger right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3259080","3272080"," See that our green green green hourly right there until you get a get above this green line. I don't care if it's here or down here. You have no trade. You have no safe trade as a bull."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3272080","3282080"," No safe trade. You can do 15 minute trades, half day trades, whatever you want. If you're a seller, you are looking to sell anything off of this green line right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3282080","3301080"," You sell this with a stop above it. If it begins to trade higher, you get rid of your stops and you are actually a seller all the way down until it ends. I don't care if it ends on the daily or the weekly. You are selling that green line all the way down until it stops, or you see the green line flatten out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3302080","3312080"," Until you see that, this is a seller's market. So today, even into tomorrow, unless we hold above the green line, you are a seller of this market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3312080","3326080"," We have downside targets on the spy currently of 445 likely 448 450 depending upon the time it takes to get there. You can see something like this into next week."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3326080","3341080"," Right. There's the seventh right here. You begin to see us kind of break and look for relief rally. If this comes back down on that daily and does not hold a breakdown, we could even begin to see that weekly to the downside over time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3341080","3361080"," So currently, we are at risk of a correction of some sorts of the downside target on spy specifically is 422 89 on ES. We're going to look at ES really quick. We're going to get over the three SPX ES and then we're going to look at."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3362080","3379080"," So you can come back and check this channel. We'll be looking for a downside target of 4300 on ES. And right now, our first target right now on ES is likely going to be 4550 somewhere in there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3380080","3402080"," 45 not 4550 4530 on ES. And then on SPX, you have a downside target. Three of a 4500 flat by the time you get there, I think, and then a downside target of about 4300 two weeks."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3402080","3419080"," One week, it'd be like 40 to 42 80. So right in there on SPX. I do want to tell you something here. I want you to look at SPX here. We are not in a risk off environments unless you see."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3419080","3427080"," This is going to kind of shock you here. Last second here. We are not in a risk off environments."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3427080","3434080"," Unless you see price break down, believe it or not, all the way down below this weekly."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3434080","3441080"," It'll come back up again. Second here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3441080","3449080"," You actually see this yellow line crossed down and not continue higher. If it's just a correction, it should continue higher, even if price drops."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3449080","3456080"," But if you see that yellow line coming down, it's going to give you fair warning. You're going to see this orange line come up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3457080","3467080"," Here, here, and here. And you will see an attempt by the marketplace to blast higher and fail."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3467080","3481080"," Make sense? Just like that. So you will have an opportunity to get out of this market here or even inside of here, which would put you back to July 20th or 15th or so, something like that June 29th."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3482080","3487080"," But anyways, my point here is that you're not seeing any of that right now. You're seeing the daily Martire."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3487080","3496080"," You'll likely see price break below and this continue higher and then it'll drag price back up to it in the future."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3499080","3508080"," No, there is no correlation. I apologize. I have looked at this stuff going back to the 1800s and absolutely not."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3509080","3517080"," The only thing that I see, we saw this before bonds forming up. So the tell was already there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3517080","3526080"," This is more function, I believe, of math and computing and you can assign it to whatever you want."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3526080","3531080"," The confidence I give you with my explanation is kind of scary. Yeah."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3532080","3539080"," So pretend this is a one minute chart right here, right? I'm going to pretend right now this is a one minute chart or five minute chart. We're day trading."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3539080","3548080"," You know when we come down here, right? This is the what is this right here, right? This is the gambling zone. We don't mess with that zone. We wait until you break below."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3548080","3555080"," Right? We begin to reject and then we take the short to the downside, right? Never mess with that right there, do we?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3556080","3564080"," It begins to break to the upside and you see the hourly come back down and swoop down. You know, it's time to close your shorts and we're going to take the market long once again."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3564080","3575080"," Okay, so this applies. This actually applies with a daily chart, applies with an hourly chart, a four chart, that kind of stuff."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3575080","3582080"," Now, there are some things you can glean here. Okay, we're going to talk about gleaning some information about the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3582080","3590080"," We're going to talk about SPX right now. We're going to talk about some ideas of gleaning information. Okay, and we're on the wrong one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3590080","3594080"," How you can."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3594080","3602080"," How you can take some information from the marketplace on a one hour chart. This is SPX. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3602080","3606080"," On a one hour chart. This is SPX right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3606080","3611080"," What is this telling us right now? This chart is telling you that we are bearish."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3611080","3620080"," This chart is telling you that we can be bearish for anywhere from three days to about a one week, maybe three weeks at most."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3620080","3626080"," We broke below the twenty seven EMA on a one hour chart. You can do this on your own at home."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3626080","3631080"," Okay, and any chart that you have, there will be a capitulation phase right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3631080","3637080"," You will see the role begin over here. Right, and you'll see this role right over here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3637080","3641080"," This begins over here in the beginning of August, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3641080","3645080"," You'll actually see a rejection if we're going to continue to get bearish."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3645080","3650080"," We'll head down right here blast through right maybe close that stuff up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3650080","3654080"," Maybe you're getting more panicky and then we'll actually come right back up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3655080","3660080"," And we'll begin to do this kind of stuff trade sideways and we start to head lower over here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3660080","3662080"," If that's going to happen. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3662080","3665080"," So let's say you got caught today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3665080","3670080"," So let's just say for today and spa you got caught. Let's say you were long and you're panicking out there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3670080","3681080"," You more than likely have a chance tomorrow or Monday for a pullback right to where we started on Thursday to exit the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3681080","3687080"," Okay. Right now the market is telling you to expect down for the next at least week."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3687080","3689080"," Do you see it? At least week."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3689080","3694080"," If you're trying to short right here, I don't recommend it. I do recommend shorting right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3694080","3699080"," And I do recommend trying to re short this if we blast down right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3699080","3704080"," If you are long and you're like, well, I'm upside down right now, cap. I'm losing money."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3704080","3710080"," You are looking for some kind of a squeeze higher on SPX or spy or whatever it is you're trading."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3710080","3717080"," You're going to get yourself out of the market if you can't withstand this down move right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3717080","3726080"," And you're going to wait for that green trend to come back up and for you to be able to reenter with confidence in the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3726080","3732080"," If we begin to blast down here, you still have no entry until what happens."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3732080","3737080"," We come back up here, right? We begin to actually make a move higher right here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3737080","3741080"," And begin to trade higher. You can then reenter the market with safety."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3741080","3744080"," Same thing applies down here, right? You'll begin to come back up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3744080","3748080"," You will see that white line turn back around to the upside."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3748080","3754080"," You will confirm it with price and you can then enter the market to the upside right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3754080","3761080"," So just even on a short term basis, the next five days, the next six days on an hourly trend,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3761080","3766080"," we can expect more bearishness until price results to the upside."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3766080","3770080"," So this is SPX, right? Until price resolves to the upside."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3770080","3777080"," One, two, three, if that even happens and confirms you have no trade in the marketplace as a bull."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3777080","3785080"," You understand what I'm saying? If you were long back here and you're upside down and we come back up here, you exit right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3785080","3791080"," You exit the market, you reenter on confirmation to the upside. Does that make sense to you?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3791080","3795080"," If you're like, well, there's a long way down here, Cap. I don't really care about it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3795080","3801080"," Well, then maybe you can handle that hit to the downside in the recovery that follows it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3801080","3804080"," Does that make sense? Oftentimes, when we get a role in this market,"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3804080","3809080"," you will see people capitulate at the absolute wrong fucking time down here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3809080","3815080"," Then you'll see the market recover and they'll be like, fuck, I lost all that progress that I made. Does that make sense?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3816080","3822080"," If you fail to get out of the market right here and we come down here, then you really capitulate, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3822080","3825080"," And you're all upset and you don't trust this move higher, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3825080","3830080"," So if you're caught in this tomorrow or Monday, you likely should hold on."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3830080","3834080"," You should likely just hold your position until it does recover."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3834080","3838080"," Now, I want to tell you something else about where we are in the marketplace right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3838080","3843080"," It is okay if you're a bull to fucking sit on your hands."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3843080","3851080"," If there is a recovery here, it is okay for you to not trade and wait for the confirmation that we're going higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3851080","3858080"," Or if we blast down here, right? And you see the white line come down and then we confirm the move higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3858080","3862080"," You don't have to re-enter the marketplace until that recovery takes place."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3862080","3866080"," Here is very dangerous for a buyer as a seller."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3866080","3876080"," If you're a seller here, right, and you're going to expect continued downside moves, you need to be very tactful in here and be shorting this right here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3876080","3880080"," You're going to blast down here, close that stuff up, and you're going to still see this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3880080","3884080"," You don't think you're going to see this. I saw people on stream today that were like, it's going to go straight down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3884080","3887080"," I'm like, this shit, this is not how this happens."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3887080","3892080"," It never happens like that. You will always see the capitulation here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3892080","3898080"," Now, this could be a shorter timeframe, but you'll always see that blast up, right? The shorts will come off."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3898080","3902080"," You're going to re-enter as a bear. Your stops are going to be up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3902080","3910080"," What's even fascinating about this for a bear is, if you enter this short right here, right, and it goes against you, it blasts up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3910080","3914080"," You're still going to have a chance to get out of your shorts, right? It'll fail right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3914080","3920080"," Even if it's going to go higher, you still have a chance to get out of your short in here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3920080","3927080"," Okay, so if you're a bull or a bear or a buyer or seller, there are the wrong times in the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3927080","3936080"," There's the right times too short and buy, and there are the wrong times if you get caught to panic sell or get squeezed out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3936080","3941080"," You'll hear that, right? I got squeezed out or they got squeezed out. What really happened was this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3941080","3944080"," They fucking entered the wrong fucking time short, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3944080","3950080"," And when we came back down here, they didn't fucking get out of being short. They stayed short."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3950080","3954080"," They're like, oh, look, it's coming back down. It's going to roll over. That's really what happens."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3954080","3959080"," They're expecting that down move, and instead, this is where they get... This is where the squeeze is."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3959080","3965080"," Squeeze is not right there for bears. Squeeze is always up here. Does that make sense to you?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3965080","3971080"," So if you hear like a bear getting squeezed out or a seller getting squeezed out, it's because they didn't fucking wrap it up when they were supposed to."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3972080","3975080"," Does that make sense? Same thing for a buyer, okay?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","3980080","3984080"," Yeah, so if you don't have the tool, you're going to get the tool for me."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3984080","3990080"," Now, the tool is not the EMA's. You can see that, right? I just showed you that the tool is not the EMA's."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3990080","3995080"," And there's other parts of the tool. There's actually a new part to the tool that nobody has."
"NgRbB27cIQI","3996080","4004080"," But I want you, at home, you can do this on your own. This is a 27 EMA. I adjust it between 27 and 30."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4004080","4016080"," And then I have right here a 129 EMA. And I will adjust those between 116 and 130, depending upon where we are in the month and where we are in the year, okay?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4016080","4022080"," Now, you can simply do this yourself. So if you're a bull right now, what are you... Let's say you're trapped."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4022080","4032080"," Let's just say you're trapped right now. If you're a bull, what is your only plan right now? Your only plan is to look for some kind of a death here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4032080","4040080"," You don't care if it's going up. You just care about this right here. Getting out right here. Reentering up here. Does that make sense?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4040080","4050080"," That's true. You're looking for that. If you're not even given that, let's say we continue to blast down and you don't even get those, pretend you don't."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4051080","4060080"," You're going to hold. You're actually going to hold for that bounce to happen up there, which will happen."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4060080","4066080"," Does that make sense? And if you're going to take a lick like I lost 10% or 5%, that's what you do."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4066080","4077080"," If you've got calls or whatever else, or you've got long term calls that are six months out, you take your lick and you wait until your next time that you can actually get long with confidence on that timeframe."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4077080","4084080"," This is a daily chart. It was a one hour chart, right? So let's look at the one hour. We're going to get multi time frames here. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4084080","4096080"," We're going to start with a daily. Is this bearish? No. Right. Is that like bearish to you? Fuck no. Right. We're riding up to six EMA on the SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4096080","4108080"," It just bounced off the six. EMA on a six day. Is that bearish? Is that risk off? No. Not at all. Is it?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4108080","4116080"," This is a daily chart right now, right? Do we have a role going on here in SPX?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4116080","4123080"," You want to see bearish? That's fucking bearish right here. It's a daily chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4123080","4131080"," Right. You see something like this here, boom, boom, boom, come back down, blast down there, right? Evil. Start trading sideways like this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4131080","4138080"," Then we get the move, right? That's bearish. That's bearish for like months. Months."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4138080","4145080"," You see that on a weekly? That's a year. It's a year bearishness."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4146080","4161080"," So I bearish like, are we risk off right now? No. On the four hour. Are we bearish right now? That's multi weeks, right? Three, four, five weeks. Are we bearish right now? No."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4161080","4169080"," We're coming back to check the ZSPX come back to check 20, 70, and a four hour timeframe. Guess what happened last time we did that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4169080","4179080"," We ripped fucking face. Guess what happened? We just happened last time we did that. We ripped fucking face. Guess what happened last time we did that. We ripped fucking face."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4179080","4191080"," We did roll back down here, didn't we? Did you have panic there? Fuck. No, you held long. Right. If you miss this, you got down blasted here. You're just going to hold on until you come back up. Does that make sense?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4192080","4201080"," So there are the wrong times to sell and the right times to sell and right fucking now on spy. It is not the right time to sell for you. I assure you of that. Not the right time for you to sell."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4201080","4214080"," Not a four hour timeframe. Are we bearish for the next four or five weeks? No, not yet. Are we? If we were to get bearish and have an actual correction in the market, that would be like a four or five week thing, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4214080","4219080"," Maybe it could be quicker. But what are you looking for here, right? You're looking for this to come up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4219080","4229080"," You're looking for this to come down, right? Roll over right there. Right. When is that? That's the fit. What is that? The 11th of August, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4229080","4238080"," Until we get into August, you're going to be looking for this blood here and then still a squeeze higher here. Does that make sense?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4238080","4247080"," You still have that chance to get unfucked in the marketplace, even if it rejects and begins to come down in bloodbath here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4247080","4257080"," See that? So I want you to see this even into August. You still have time to get out of the market to reposition if it is that bearish."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4257080","4264080"," Now, this is a four hour trend for multi weeks, right? So I don't want our chart right now. Are we bearish? Yes, we are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4264080","4271080"," So we are bearish for the next one to five days. Let's call it that through. Let's say one to five days. We are bearish."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4271080","4275080"," Does that mean you sell everything and get out? Fuck no, you're waiting for that chance to get out of the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4275080","4284080"," Does that make sense? To reset your lungs in the market. If you're a bear, are you bearish? Yes. How long are you bearish next one to five days?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4284080","4300080"," Where are you trying to sell up here was the first one, right? Your next target to sell is any kind of a pull up, right? You're looking now for anything coming up here to sell, right? You're watching this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4300080","4308080"," You want price to stay below the one hour twenty seven EMA and every time it approaches it, you're going to attempt to short it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4308080","4316080"," And if you fail shorting it on the twenty seven EMA, what do you know? You know that it's going to come back down and test it at least once, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4316080","4324080"," So if it does fail and you get trapped, you're going to wait for that first drop down and you're going to get out until it resets to the downside."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4324080","4329080"," Does that make sense? If you do this for years and decades, you will be a winning trader."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4329080","4341080"," On every time frame. I know I want you to take you to a fifteen minute chart right here. What is that right there, right? You've got a cross forming on the fifteen minute. Does it mean it's going to do it? No."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4341080","4354080"," But what are you looking for here? If you're a bear right in a fifteen minute time frame, what are you looking for? You're looking for that cross. You're looking for that super sexy, right? You're looking for that right here. You're an SPX. What are you looking for?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4354080","4366080"," You're an ES. What are you looking for? You're looking for that little sexy right here? Now we are right on forty five thirty three and tomorrow on the six EMA. We could bloodbath this straight down tomorrow, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4366080","4376080"," So SPX doesn't trade during the day. So at nighttime tonight on ES, what are you looking for in the overnight? You're going to find out tonight in the overnight."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4376080","4390080"," I can't do yes in this one. You're going to find out in the overnight tonight where the sellers step in. In the end of today's broadcast, I said, do you expect the dip to be bought, right? This is ES right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4390080","4403080"," No, you are looking to see if these sellers are able to step in before morning, right? You want to see if they come in and try to sell this back down before they open tomorrow."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4403080","4417080"," So if you're a bull, you're going to be paying attention to that. If you trade futures, you're going to be paying attention to this forty five ninety forty five eighty five to see if they step in to sell this down before the open tomorrow."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4417080","4421080"," Does that make sense to you guys? That's thirty minute chart, by the way."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4421080","4432080"," So right down in here, time, right? As soon as this comes up, whatever time that is, you're going to see these sellers attempt to step back in and sell this stuff down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4432080","4441080"," Again, does that make sense to you guys?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4441080","4454080"," For sixty calls, expiring tomorrow, how done are they now the dealers will like I said, I've got some calls for tomorrow. I picked up some four fifty sevens for tomorrow. They were cheap as fuck, but about them all anyways."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4455080","4459080"," I don't know if they're four. I think they're forty sevens. I don't remember."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4459080","4463080"," But how done are they likely done? They're likely done."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4463080","4470080"," And there will be a moment in the market tomorrow where they will likely price them to zero early eleven thirty one thirty in the afternoon."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4470080","4477080"," If they're already dead, you hold them until the close. I'll be honest with you. If they're already dead."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4478080","4488080"," I love you too, dairy dug for longer dated options. Sixty days, what time for using for decision making daily or some combination of all time frames. It's a very good question, Chris."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4488080","4497080"," So if I'm if I have us, let's say I buy a three month option, right? If I'm buying a three month option, it's a very good question, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4497080","4506080"," If I'm not a day trader, right, which I'm I'm actually day trade, but I'm a lot of my size comes into the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4506080","4520080"," I'm not day trading. And you saw me in stream today trying to buy a spy, right? You saw me trying to buy a spy today. I'm like, yeah, I want to buy Disney. I want to buy spy for like weekly or three month out or something like that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4520080","4529080"," Right? So this is spy right here. Where are you trying to buy the market? Right? If you put a three day, you put a three day option or three month option or one month option on."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4529080","4542080"," I'm only going to get so many chances. Right? Here's one. Here's two. Here is almost three. Right? Almost three is coming to. So I'm waiting for some somewhere near in here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4542080","4555080"," Next few days, I'm looking to put some risk on the market. If the market begins to sell below here and I have a three month option, what am I looking at? If I see the reversal here, I'm going to sell those calls."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4555080","4567080"," Right? On a rejection. I actually wouldn't buy this though with a three month call. I would wait for price to confirm, move higher here and then take that three month call. But let's say you want to put some risk on."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4567080","4576080"," It's probably not until next week. It's probably not until next week. So like three month option, one month option, one and a half to three months."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4577080","4587080"," Daily chart, definitely a daily chart. If you're looking for trend more refined, multi week trend, right? For our chart, definitely."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4587080","4596080"," And actually see the tag here of daily price get above the early stay above the early, right? And you can actually see something else. I want to show you here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4596080","4604080"," You see how trend is going down here on the yellow and trend is going up here in the yellow. Are we bullish when trend is going down? Fuck no."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4604080","4613080"," Are we bullish when trend is going up on the other line? Fuck yeah, right? Yes, we're bullish. Is trend still going up on the other line? Yes."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4613080","4622080"," So we're bullish on trend still until we turn around trend on the daily and weekly, right? Start turning that stuff around."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4622080","4629080"," We are looking for a dip to buy. We are not in risk off. We are actually looks this is pretend this is the yellow and this is the orange."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4629080","4637080"," We are actually looking for a dip down here to buy. So if you're looking for a one and a half to three month option, daily chart for our chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4637080","4648080"," If you're looking for a one month option out, I would say the one hour chart would be perfect. And then, of course, you can go smaller in time frame, depending upon lower time frames."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4648080","4655080"," If you're looking for a one minute chart, you can trade a daily weekly. If you're trading a 15 minute chart, you can likely trade a two week or three week option."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4655080","4663080"," Good question."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4663080","4670080"," 60 plus days. You want to do six month or one month. If you're doing six month or one month or leaps."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4670080","4677080"," If you're looking for a minimum of a touch or you're looking for a minimum of a touch on the daily, if not close to the weekly."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4677080","4687080"," And you are also looking for trend confirmed to the upside for a period of time. Okay. We saw that happen back in October."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4687080","4693080"," We actually saw that take place. We called this. We actually called it way back here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4693080","4702080"," This bottom. We called this bottom down here. You can actually see it actually saw the daily recovering. You saw the weekly turn up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4702080","4709080"," And then we saw the monthly turn up and then we saw price fighting its way back way back in October. And we knew that was it. It was bottoming."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4709080","4715080"," We could actually see this bottoming process down here. We could actually see the turn in the marketplace heading to the upside."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4716080","4723080"," So if you want to buy something now, do I think you should buy like a six month or a year out leap right now in the market?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4723080","4738080"," That depends. We're likely going to get a major pullback towards a price or end of year. A major one. Now, if we get to new all time highs sooner than later, you're going to see a big sell."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4738080","4747080"," If we come up to all time highs and fail, you're going to see a major sell. But I don't think it's over there. I don't think that the market is done going higher."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4747080","4761080"," But that will be a major risk off event for the marketplace. I think in my view, I think that we climb a wall of worry with a lot of volatility getting to that all time high."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4762080","4774080"," We're going to get on top of that mountain. And we are going to sell the fuck out of this market. It's going to be nasty. Right now, if you want to know where that target is, when that happens, I can give it to you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4774080","4783080"," For where it is today, and you actually give you those targets in time. I can actually give you those targets. So whenever this market does roll over."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4783080","4796080"," Your targets are currently 3412. But the time you get there, it's likely going to be 3600. So whenever this if this market rolls over up here, let's say."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4796080","4805080"," Right. You're going to see a huge move down. This will have been somewhere up here, actually. So let's just pretend we just pretend that we're getting close."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4806080","4815080"," It'll likely be 3800 at that point. Something like that. That might not be that high. Go a little bit."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4815080","4827080"," Let's try for 3600. So whatever that big cell is, it's going to be 3600. That's a new low higher than the previous low. See it right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4827080","4836080"," Our low, our new low will likely be higher than 3450. So 3600. And you're actually going to get a larger move to 5000."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4836080","4847080"," Maybe 6000. Try for like 5,000 in 2024. Maybe higher. Depends on what the Fed does and who gets elected president."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4847080","4852080"," We can actually go to 6000. You'll want you to see that right there. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4852080","4859080"," Now, if you think we're getting a fraud, new leg lower, you'll already be able to see that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4859080","4867080"," So let's say you're on the fraud case for the markets of fraud and the market's going to go down. You don't have to worry about that right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4867080","4871080"," Because when we get there, right, when we get there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4871080","4875080"," I want to show you guys something here. I'm going to show you guys here something in a minute. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4875080","4882080"," Let's say we roll over there, right. This is February and March or whatever. We roll down here, right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4882080","4886080"," I want you to know that that is still a place for you to take the money and run."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4886080","4891080"," It's going to bounce. I promise you, it's going to bounce. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4891080","4898080"," Gonna squeeze up like that. Come back down. If it starts to fail and make its way down to the next level, we'll be prepared for that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4898080","4905080"," Does that make sense? You'll then put a new trade on to the next level down. Do you want to know where that level is? I'll tell it to you."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4905080","4911080"," It's going to be 3,200 somewhere in there. And I want to show you this in previous examples. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4911080","4918080"," I want to show you the confidence that we tag those levels. Here's one. There's purple right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4918080","4924080"," When we do have crashes, this one went a little bit lower than expected, but it sucked itself right back up, right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4924080","4930080"," It broke below, sucked itself right back up. Same thing back here. This is 2008."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4930080","4936080"," We actually had that last roll, right. Rolled down, boom, boom, on to the purple and what happened?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4936080","4941080"," Straight down. What else did you notice about this? The blue line came down, right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4941080","4947080"," You see the blue line coming down? Didn't have that happen, though, did we? And guess where it bounced?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4947080","4953080"," This is the fraudulent market, bounced on that gray line, right way back in 2000."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4953080","4959080"," We didn't bounce. We didn't get as low as we're in the SPX right now. I'm on a four hour chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4959080","4966080"," So we can get back here. It's 2008 right here. This is 2000. We bounced off the white line, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","4966080","4973080"," This was bad, right? This was the top of the tech bubble and we still only went down to the white line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4973080","4979080"," Right. So what do you need to actually go to the gray line? Fraud. Actual fraud."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4979080","4986080"," Where do we normally tag? The blue line. This is the monthly. That's a normal rollover for us to continue higher in this market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4986080","4990080"," Going back all the way to 1942. I think we had our first major role."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4990080","4999080"," I was set in 1974. Did the gray line. Sorry. I mean, the first time we ever broke below all of this was World War II or last time was World War II."
"NgRbB27cIQI","4999080","5005080"," And the previous example was the depression in 1939."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5005080","5011080"," This is going back all the way in history. And I want to show you here in 1942."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5011080","5018080"," Only other time that we broke below. This is the World War II down here. Squeezed up, came back down below the gray line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5018080","5022080"," This is 1932 right here. This is the stock market crash."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5022080","5029080"," You can actually see it's break below here. It was 1929 back up here. In 1932, we actually broke below the gray line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5029080","5035080"," So the depression would be worse than 2008, right? That's when burning tires in the streets."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5035080","5043080"," People are out there walking the streets of America looking for work, right? You've got the, you know, you got like a hobos and stuff."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5043080","5052080"," So that would be a 1939 style crash, a break of the gray line. World War would be a break of the gray line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5052080","5055080"," Right. We go to World War III. You're going to get a break of the gray line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5055080","5064080"," This is the entire history going back to SPX is only to the, I believe the 1920s, but DJI can show the same kind of a chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5064080","5071080"," Same kind of thing going on here all the way back in time. So when you hear somebody right now claiming that we're going to go to the gray line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5071080","5079080"," That's 20. That's 2000 right now. It's 2000. That would be depression. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5080080","5087080"," The white line right now is 2849. That would be fraud in the marketplace. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5087080","5092080"," The purple line would be a COVID style crash. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5092080","5104080"," A normal crash would be the blue line. Okay. So even if we were to crash here, you're going to expect us to only go right now to 4000. So when you guys are calling for 4000, you're not calling for a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5104080","5114080"," You're calling for a fucking market crash. Okay. Risk off events. And I want to explain something to you guys here that you don't see often. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5114080","5122080"," The greatest trick that Jerome Powell pulled on you as a seller or a bear or a bull is time. It's time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5123080","5128080"," When we have this rubber band right here effect."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5128080","5134080"," We have greater risk of huge down moves to see the rubber band."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5134080","5139080"," So the risk to the downside becomes a pretty big number right we're way up here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5140080","5152080"," And you have risk all the way down to 2000, 2200. That's pretty big right. But guess what guess what Jerome did Jerome bought time for the marketplace. So guess what happened to this target."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5152080","5159080"," This target moved up right came up came up came up came up and now it's coming up even further."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5159080","5166080"," Same thing over here. Do you guys remember when Mike Wilson was calling for 3200."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5166080","5174080"," Right. You guys remember his call for 2800. Right in here. This is back in March right possible target 22."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5174080","5182080"," Excuse me. 2800. We're back over here. He told you right back here in October and September target to the downside 3200. There it is right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5182080","5189080"," He already knows about this line. He knows where this is. He was telling you where the risk was when he told you he was wrong. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5189080","5197080"," He knows now that the next target below is 345. Why did he come out and tell you that he was wrong. Do you want to tell you why."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5197080","5206080"," I'll tell you why because he fucking knows right that even if we got a market crash that we aren't going below right around this vicinity right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5206080","5216080"," So he's saying to you these wrong because you're not getting 3200. You're not getting 2800. You're not getting 2000 anymore."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5216080","5226080"," Even if we do have a crash. His worst his worst case scenario right now is the same fucking price that he was he was he was threatening you with."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5226080","5239080"," So there's no way that you can argue if we roll right now today into into the next week down to the depths of hell that you shouldn't have bought 3450 because he fucking knows what the worst crash could be at this moment."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5240080","5252080"," So the worst crash for COVID was the blue line. If the most doom and gloom you can produce is the purple line unless we have fraud in the system. Right. His measured point of hey we're going to go down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5252080","5262080"," He knows that the worst case scenario is more than likely a retest of the low back in October. That's why he came out and told you that I want to assure you of that. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5263080","5276080"," You know it's funny about this too right. Let's talk about losing half of your net worth. So wait a minute let's show you guys somewhat losing half of your net worth."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5276080","5282080"," So I want to show you something else here. So let's look at the crash here. Okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5282080","5287080"," I want to show you how the yellow line did not cross right here did it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5288080","5300080"," I want to show you how it did cross right here. This is your warning sign right here. See that cross. Guess where price went. So if you were long this market right I bet you were listening to somebody telling you get out of the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5301080","5313080"," And look what happened. You had this huge squeeze up here and where did we go. Almost previous highs. What did we do. We failed didn't we. When we failed right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5314080","5326080"," Even if we hadn't failed you still should have gotten out until conditions improved. That makes sense. The yellow line would cross above you'd start to get some confirmation that we're going higher but you still had a chance to get out of the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5327080","5338080"," In every crash you have a chance to get out of the marketplace. Every one going back to the beginning. You have a chance to get out. At some point you are given the opportunity to get out."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5338080","5346080"," What often happens is you panic sell or when we go up there you get fucking greedy and say oh it's recovering I'm staying in. Does that make sense."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5348080","5361080"," Right. So right here let's say we blast over right. It comes back up. What do you do here. You take the fucking money and run. If it bounces and continue higher you then reenter long right there. Does that make sense."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5362080","5376080"," But you are getting out on that first role if you're caught in it. So you do have a chance. This is a good point that whoever made that comment made a good point that they lost half their net worth in March. I want to tell you guys something very important."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5377080","5389080"," It is your responsibility if you're going to manage your own money. That you are a sober as fuck emotional and thinking person when things get tough."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5390080","5405080"," If you see if you have a moment in this market where you get rolled over it and you're fucking bleeding major money. I beg you to be patient and wait for the failure to regain a new high to exit the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5405080","5414080"," You should write that down somewhere. Print it up on a piece of paper and mount it on your wall somewhere. Okay you guys hear that sometimes right. Failure to get a new high."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5415080","5427080"," When you see that on the time frame you're invested in and you see that failure or even if it's going to break above it. Right when you go to that failure point. You just exit the market there even if it's going to go higher even if you lost 10% or 5%."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5427080","5438080"," You get the fuck out until conditions improve for yourself. You get out of the market. You're like hey who I was. I was up. I was up a hundred thousand dollars in the market. I was up a million dollars in the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5438080","5450080"," I went down to six hundred thousand. I went back up and to nine hundred thousand in the market. I'm down. I'm down a hundred grand. But guess what I exited the market. I'm up a hundred and I'm waiting for conditions to improve."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5450080","5458080"," But there are some really wrong times to sell and there are some really wrong times to stay in if it recovers. There's actual risk."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5459080","5474080"," When we do recover. There's actual risk there even if we had headed higher. There's actual risk right there in that moment of failure. You might think yeah it's going to recover that moment you fucking get out. You pull out and you wait until until conditions improve."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5474080","5487080"," If they don't you would have gotten out of this market way back over here in April. Late March early April April. And I know for a fact that when we're down here people were panicking."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5488080","5497080"," The news was the worst. It was it was a drum beat. As a matter of fact Dan Niles. A famous trader right. He goes right on CNBC."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5497080","5504080"," And you know what he tells people. We're oversold. There's nobody left to sell into. We're along this market right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5504080","5509080"," We went through that last year right. Remember we watched Dan Niles come on CNBC. We make jokes about it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5509080","5515080"," There's only so much selling you can do. They will buy this market back and they'll sell it back down on you again."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5519080","5528080"," Yeah and you guys can always. You could be inputs right now. I'm inputs right now. I have $20,000 inputs on this market right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5528080","5535080"," I don't think they're going to print. But I've got money on the market right now to the downside. I was trading puts the entire way up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5535080","5539080"," They expire worthless worthless. They go in the money a little bit."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5539080","5548080"," But you know I've had a few sets of puts that were in the money and then burned. My last set of puts for 432 were not in the money."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5548080","5553080"," But I was thinking I was up 30% or something like that. And they fucking started burning again."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5553080","5560080"," Now therefore August 11th. And do I think they're going to print? No I have no faith in those print. None of those are going to fucking print for me."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5561080","5569080"," They might print and I can only give them until next week at some point next week. I have to close them at a loss at some point."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5569080","5579080"," That's a part of insurance policy in case we do have a like a death or a war or terrorism something like that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5579080","5585080"," That's just a hedge I've taken insurance in the market. But I want you to realize that even where we are right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5585080","5591080"," If you're a bear you're looking for. If you got puts right now stay in your puts. That's fine. You can stay in your puts."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5591080","5598080"," You buy your puts on the open today. Stay in them. You're fine. But if you're not that guy on your upside down you can stay in them too."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5598080","5604080"," If you're looking to tactfully short this market right now where we are you're looking for an entry point."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5604080","5610080"," So if you're let's say you're let's go to spy really quick. If you want to short this one you missed it today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5610080","5614080"," Or you took the money and ran at the bell today and you're looking for a place to short the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5614080","5622080"," You're like what's my next century cap. Right. What's my next century cap I want to know."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5622080","5627080"," Like happy I want my next oh let's do spy."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5627080","5632080"," I want to short this market down to the depths of hell cap. That's fine."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5632080","5638080"," If you took the money and ran if you missed it. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5639080","5646080"," You're looking right now to sell right here 456. That's what my calls are for."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5646080","5651080"," I want to close them right there. Because I know sellers are going to step in there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5651080","5655080"," Does it make sense. What's your target."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5655080","5660080"," 446 447. Right up there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5660080","5664080"," Right. In stream today I showed you where the cell was right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5664080","5673080"," Methodically went through and said this is where the cell is. This is where you DC the cell. Right. If it goes against you this is where you exit your cell right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5673080","5682080"," So if you're a seller you're looking for a 456 to short the market. If you miss it and we bleed down to tough luck. You missed it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5682080","5693080"," You're hoping for this to hold right here and that's your next short right there at 446."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5694080","5699080"," Nvidia looks healthy. A lot of these tickers."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5699080","5705080"," Well if we get a correction a lot of them will feel the pain. You'll see Nvidia go to its daily."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5705080","5710080"," You'll see you'll see Apple go to its daily trigger."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5710080","5721080"," You're going to see like Netflix's and Microsoft's they will get fucking they'll get fucking cut down to the they will get cut down to the weekly is big moves down in those tickers if we get the correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5721080","5726080"," They're the most they're the wounded they're the wounded there right they've got the blood running down their leg."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5726080","5732080"," Like you'll take you'll take Apple down to like 188 186 190."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5732080","5738080"," Keep on trucking. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5738080","5745080"," My thoughts on if Taiwan gets blockaded and invaded purple line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5745080","5748080"," No. No."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5748080","5757080"," I don't think purple line. You need you need a you need something unknown or not planned for and I don't think that happens."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5757080","5762080"," Or it doesn't happen until we're ready for it. Do I think it's purple line though."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5762080","5768080"," No. Do I think we crash sure blue line best best case scenario."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5768080","5772080"," Remember blue line crash was covid."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5772080","5775080"," That was covid blue line crash."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5775080","5781080"," So wrap your head around that like that's the blue line crash."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5781080","5783080"," That's that's covid."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5783080","5787080"," You guys want to look back on 9 11 we can look at that if you want."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5787080","5790080"," One second."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5790080","5794080"," It's a fair question. Look at it right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5801080","5804080"," Where are we at here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5804080","5808080"," Way back here. Man I'm an old I'm an old fucking guy here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5809080","5818080"," Where were we when they crash happened. Do you remember this is SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5818080","5820080"," Look at how high we were."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5820080","5823080"," Look at how high the market was right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5823080","5828080"," We got white line right there right but look at how high the market was."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5828080","5833080"," September right. Look at how much of a run that was right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5834080","5839080"," Right. So there's a few things I want you to see here this is 2000 September 11th."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5839080","5841080"," 2001."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5841080","5844080"," I'm trying to remember back now getting old."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5844080","5846080"," I want you to see something here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5846080","5848080"," This run started."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5848080","5851080"," In 1995 1984."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5851080","5856080"," Right. Never looks back on it did we."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5856080","5862080"," There's another one another crash right here right never looks back on this one did we."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5862080","5865080"," Right we did look back on this one though didn't we."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5865080","5869080"," A little bit lower here a little bit lower right there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5869080","5873080"," To the white line that's something on our soil that's like jets."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5873080","5877080"," Crashing into buildings threat of nuclear war."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5877080","5882080"," I don't I shouldn't say that privately behind closed doors threat of nuclear war."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5882080","5886080"," Right all the way down the white line is our Americans dying here in the US."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5886080","5889080"," But what else do we know about this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5889080","5892080"," How high were we here. Look at how high we were."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5892080","5896080"," And how far we came down right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5896080","5899080"," Almost like we almost like we were due for it isn't it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5899080","5902080"," Almost like we were ready for night 11."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5902080","5904080"," It was going to happen."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5904080","5908080"," When we crash down here right how long did it take for us to recover."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5908080","5911080"," Right so this is 2001."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5911080","5915080"," Long did it take for us to recover seven years long time right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5915080","5917080"," Long time on that one."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5917080","5919080"," Good question jazz."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5919080","5923080"," So I said purple line I think right now so I guess maybe white line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5923080","5925080"," That's possible."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5925080","5932080"," Blockade or we fight right so there's a Taiwanese blockade or fight you ready for that target."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5932080","5934080"," 2830."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5934080","5940080"," 2030 and we were we were targeting 2030 in March of 2022."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5940080","5942080"," That was the low target then."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5943080","5948080"," It was 2800 if you guys remember the on March April does somewhere down in there March April May."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5948080","5950080"," We were talking about 2800 then right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5950080","5955080"," So even even with time passing if we got to the white line you're talking 2800."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5955080","5958080"," Not so not so far away right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5962080","5966080"," I keep the Taiwan situation back my head because there are no other fabs like TSMC."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5967080","5972080"," I think about it sometimes I don't though and other times I was stationed in Southeast Asia."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5972080","5974080"," My thoughts on it are twofold."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5974080","5979080"," If there was an invasion of Taiwan I don't think that there would be a war."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5979080","5982080"," I don't think there will be an invasion I'll tell you that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5982080","5985080"," That's that's a word it's complicated thing."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5985080","5988080"," I don't think they'll be an invasion of Taiwan."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5988080","5993080"," I don't think that Americans would be an invasion of Taiwan."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5994080","5999080"," I don't think that Americans understand how powerful our Navy and Air Force is."
"NgRbB27cIQI","5999080","6004080"," I don't think that I don't think most Americans can grasp how powerful we are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6004080","6007080"," We're built to fight a country like like China."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6007080","6010080"," Now let's say they do invade Taiwan."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6010080","6014080"," I see only two two things that could happen."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6014080","6020080"," We would not fight China would be option number one even though we say we would we would not."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6021080","6025080"," If we did fight China then we're looking at World War three."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6025080","6030080"," If we go to World War three you can kiss off the white line and we're going to blast down to the depths of hell."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6030080","6034080"," You would see something below a thousand eight hundred something like that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6034080","6038080"," If we were to fight China which we are ramping up to do right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6038080","6046080"," We switched from a coin leader or coin a division or switch from coin to divisional leadership in the US Army."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6046080","6052080"," All branches of the US Army are military and we're switching that to fight that World War."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6052080","6057080"," So you'd have bigger things to worry about if we had that happen."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6057080","6062080"," If we turn to war with China it would be a major a major war."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6062080","6066080"," We would try to shut the entire country down in China as quickly as possible."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6066080","6068080"," I'll show you not."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6068080","6075080"," It would be like you're talking about like no war a war you've never seen in nuclear war."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6075080","6077080"," There's no in between."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6077080","6084080"," There wouldn't be like skirmishes on the South China see anything like that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6084080","6089080"," You're here for the alien talk."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6089080","6098080"," Yeah, you know when I look at the 9 11 I'm like yeah we were due for a crash anyways where we let's let's look at it right where we do for a crash or not."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6098080","6101080"," There's something else to see here too I've got something else to show you guys."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6101080","6104080"," One last thing if you're thinking that we're going to crash right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6104080","6107080"," I want to show you guys one other thing."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6107080","6112080"," So whenever we crash down in this blue line down here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6112080","6117080"," There's a time period when price gets above."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6117080","6125080"," The yellow line the yellow line crosses the orange line right we have to stabilize market see that right there blue orange yellow."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6125080","6128080"," I want to tell you guys one last part here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6128080","6134080"," There's a timeframe of a bull run and you can actually go back in history."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6134080","6137080"," And time how long they are."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6137080","6140080"," You can see this one right this one lasted about a year right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6140080","6144080"," On 2019 2020 right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6144080","6150080"," Right historically when we have this crossing the stabilization of markets."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6150080","6154080"," We only have one instance where we crash."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6154080","6156080"," Within six months."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6156080","6159080"," Every other instance in the history of the US stock market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6159080","6164080"," It tends to last for roughly about a year to three years."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6164080","6168080"," On the tail other side of that's about five to six years."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6168080","6171080"," There's a couple instances of runs for like nine years."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6171080","6174080"," That doesn't mean we don't pull back."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6174080","6179080"," Doesn't even don't have corrections just means that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6179080","6182080"," Where we are in this separation right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6182080","6186080"," If we were to crash like this week or this is the crash."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6186080","6188080"," We would be at the tail."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6188080","6193080"," We'd be at the tail end of shortest bull market ever."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6193080","6197080"," Like this would be this would probably tie one other bull market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6197080","6201080"," As the shortest one in the history of the US stock market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6201080","6207080"," So you're taking a chance on market crash is very low right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6207080","6210080"," It increases as time passes though."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6210080","6214080"," Even if we trade sideways and up the more time the passes on this bull market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6214080","6216080"," The more risk there is to a bull."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6216080","6219080"," So time matters right on bottoms time matters on tops."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6219080","6224080"," And time matters in price in the in the devastation that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6224080","6228080"," It potential to the stock market like we saw in COVID."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6228080","6231080"," We saw violent move down straight down to the depths of hell."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6231080","6233080"," Very fast very quick."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6233080","6239080"," And even then there was a there was actually a squeeze in that one that told you to get the fuck out of the market to."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6239080","6242080"," You might not know that, but there was there was a big squeeze."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6242080","6244080"," You had a chance to actually exit the market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6244080","6255080"," Yeah, you know, if you want to say it five weeks, it starts to improve your chances."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6255080","6260080"," The closer we get to the top in the two things right now, the closer we get to the top."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6260080","6262080"," In the in the more time we put on."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6262080","6265080"," We're due for a major rollover."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6265080","6268080"," A major role or I agree with that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6268080","6277080"," So time if you're a bear times on your side, you just check off every week check off every month and you know that it's coming sooner than it's then later."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6277080","6282080"," What's another what's another thing that you can look for. So you should see."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6282080","6288080"," You should see week or monthly velocity top out. You should see this one doesn't matter as much."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6288080","6293080"," But monthly velocity should help you. What's another thing that you should be should be looking for."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6293080","6301080"," If you start to see spec growth, right? If they don't recover from a correction, that's a hint, isn't it?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6301080","6305080"," You start to see a real true rollover and spec growth. What does that tell you?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6305080","6310080"," We're starting to become risk off in the marketplace, right? So there are things that you should be looking for."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6310080","6314080"," Now, if we have a correction here, if we only trade down to the daily trigger, that's fine."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6314080","6319080"," But if we begin to trade below and you start to see that yellow line rolling over, you're going to keep your eyes on spec growth."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6319080","6325080"," If that shit doesn't recover, that's a hint, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6325080","6332080"," Did you just delete a message? Matt, what did you delete for a message?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6332080","6339080"," What did Matt say? Hold on. I forgot."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6339080","6343080"," What did Matt say? I forgot what he said."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6343080","6347080"," I didn't see what Matt had said."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6347080","6352080"," Matt, ask the question again, man. I'll answer it wherever it was."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6352080","6355080"," LMT and RTX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6355080","6360080"," Thoughts on rotation into Chinese tech is US about to get a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6360080","6364080"," I would appreciate it. HSI chart analysis. Thanks, man."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6364080","6370080"," Chinese stocks will be the bellwether for the end of our market, I believe."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6370080","6374080"," I think you're good with Chinese stocks into the new year."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6375080","6379080"," I have good faith in Chinese stocks right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6379080","6383080"," But I do think you have a reckoning coming in 2024."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6383080","6395080"," I think you're going to revisit the structural part of the Chinese market and you're going to revisit that in the US as well."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6395080","6399080"," You can see Apple rotate down and trade 190 and have a huge year."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6399080","6401080"," We're at 200 range."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6401080","6406080"," I think 190 is reasonable on Apple."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6406080","6410080"," Also, you guys got here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6410080","6415080"," Oh, TSM and CIA based on fear about Taiwan right now, man."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6415080","6422080"," Your puts over 818. Yeah, I've got puts for 811 right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6422080","6427080"," Everyone's chart around three weeks low, then then rocket ship. Yeah, that would be the correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6427080","6430080"," That would be the correction down to on spy right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6430080","6437080"," Our SPX right now a three week correction would take us to right now and SPX would take us to 42."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6437080","6439080"," I feel like this. Sorry, wrong."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6439080","6444080"," This is the wrong chart."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6444080","6449080"," 30 minute chart right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6449080","6458080"," The SPX would take us in three weeks to 42 41 on SPX."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6458080","6463080"," I don't care about I'll be honest with you guys. I don't trade anymore to news."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6463080","6466080"," It's all planned."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6466080","6471080"," You guys all understand that how many times do you guys hear out there?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6471080","6477080"," Good news is good news. Bad news is good news. Good news is bad news. You guys ever noticed that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6477080","6485080"," The news doesn't really matter. They will assign bad news when they need to and assign good news when they need to."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6485080","6489080"," They'll tell you it's priced in."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6489080","6492080"," That's not how hedge funds and banks trade."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6492080","6499080"," They will adjust that for unknown news, but they know all that news. So I don't assign much to it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6499080","6503080"," I think I was talking about the beginning of the broadcast. I don't bother with it anymore."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6503080","6508080"," I serve me better not to. I've made more money, not trading to the news."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6508080","6511080"," I don't."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6511080","6513080"," Yep, doubt, Harry."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6513080","6517080"," Yeah, I don't I don't trade to it anymore. I make way more money, not trading to it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6517080","6520080"," I'll tell you what the news is. How about that?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6520080","6525080"," So even yesterday, right? So this is two days ago. I told you to expect these guys to come out and say this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6525080","6531080"," You saw them today saying it, right? How do you magically predict that?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6532080","6546080"," I can tell you because they know where we are. They know we're due for a market correction. They trade using the same stuff."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6546080","6548080"," Yeah, yeah."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6548080","6554080"," I stopped trading. I mean, I listened to the news. I follow the news. So I shouldn't say that I don't follow the news."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6554080","6560080"," I follow the news. I separate my opinion as to where the market is going based on that news."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6560080","6566080"," I think I'm speaking to myself right now. I'm speaking my stance on this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6566080","6570080"," I need to know what the news is. I need to know what inflation is. I need to know what's going up and coming down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6570080","6575080"," I need to know where unemployment and jobs are. I need to know what the rates are and all that kind of stuff."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6575080","6580080"," As far as market price action has nothing to do with that news."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6581080","6594080"," Well, well, in the short term, it doesn't. You should already know when to be buying and you should already know when to be selling."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6594080","6597080"," Yeah, it's the mean reversion, man. That's all it is, Johnny."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6597080","6600080"," They're just looking for another place to fucking short, man."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6600080","6608080"," If I was trying to short this market, I'd be looking to short 356, like fucking a if it goes up there, short the fuck out of it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6608080","6614080"," I don't know when that happens. If it happens now overnight, if it doesn't happen in the overnight, we will short it in the daytime."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6614080","6618080"," So we'll look at a yes right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6624080","6628080"," We got it right in a chart, a 30 minute chart. We'll look at it right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6632080","6636080"," So I'll show you where the short is right fucking up here. You can see it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6636080","6640080"," All right, I'm going to show you where the short is on a yes right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6640080","6649080"," There's two places to short. Now, this is a one minute right here. This one minute line. If this woman like come down here and time passes enough."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6649080","6652080"," Gets underneath this red line."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6652080","6657080"," I would short that right there or take that short right there all day long."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6657080","6663080"," Uh, if it starts to squeeze up here and this is like, you know, 132 o'clock in the morning."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6664080","6666080"," I'll be looking for a rejection right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6666080","6670080"," All right, I'll be looking for the one in the five minutes to get underneath it."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6670080","6675080"," These two can climb back up and get underneath it. I would short the fuck out of that right there too."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6675080","6677080"," Down to the depths of hell."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6677080","6683080"," And all this buying action right now is likely just dealers countering the trade down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6683080","6685080"," That's not bullish or anything."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6686080","6696080"," Uh, no, I don't think that they're designed to confuse you. I think that in the 1970s, you had market participants."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6696080","6705080"," I don't know if you know this or not, but in the 1970s, you had market participants retailers started enter the market in droves."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6705080","6712080"," You had this higher dissemination of information to people and you had some very smart people at very smart universities."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6712080","6716080"," Uh, math, uh, geniuses and Wall Street went to those people."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6716080","6720080"," And these people were designing a language neural path."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6720080","6724080"," Um, um, our predictive modeling, not predict."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6724080","6726080"," Uh, yeah, predictive modeling is basically what it was."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6726080","6730080"," And, um, so they were doing predictive modeling in the 1970s."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6730080","6735080"," And a bunch of papers are being released from famous, uh, mathematicians."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6735080","6737080"," And Wall Street paid these guys."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6737080","6747080"," Uh, these were neural pathways. So a 1970s bunch of research was done, uh, for like a blind person to communicate or a deaf person to communicate."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6747080","6759080"," And so, uh, all these math problems were trying to take a concept here and correlate it, uh, or deliver a message that someone else could interpret, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6759080","6764080"," So all of those, uh, mathematical equations were applied to indicators that you have today."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6765080","6769080"," Uh, and now in the 1990s, uh, they were using them in hedge funds."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6769080","6776080"," And then these hedge fund guys would leave and they started to sell them in the 1990s to people like you, a retailer."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6776080","6779080"," And then they became huge in the 1990s."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6779080","6786080"," Uh, and then of course we hit the age of the internet and you have some refinements, uh, in those indicators."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6786080","6792080"," Uh, and so you have the development of a Berg, um, a progressive and regressive, uh, algorithms and things like that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6792080","6796080"," And, uh, and now they've, they've grown in, um, their complexity."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6796080","6803080"," Uh, all that stuff is still being used right now. Um, machine learning, uh, that kind of stuff is all based on shit that was done."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6803080","6809080"," I mean, we've had it before, but 1970s was a distinctive period where the Wall Street started to rely upon those indicators."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6809080","6815080"," So now you're just basically using like a primitive, uh, indicator that was developed in the 1970s."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6815080","6816080"," It's basically what you're using."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6816080","6818080"," And indicators have come a long way since that time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6818080","6821080"," Uh, so no, it's not bad. It's just, uh, an old indicator."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6821080","6823080"," It's been around forever."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6823080","6828080"," That's right, neural networks and neural pathways, neural networks."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6828080","6837080"," Um, it started, uh, so predictive, uh, predictive algorithms started with, um, trying to help people with, uh, disabilities."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6837080","6841080"," Uh, and then it crossed over paths with, uh, Wall Street."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6841080","6844080"," No, you're welcome."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6844080","6845080"," You're welcome."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6845080","6847080"," Um, so I'm expecting squeeze here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6847080","6849080"," Now, as time passes, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6849080","6852080"," Not in a bull's favor, is it?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6852080","6856080"," Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6856080","6858080"," But if price gets above here, right?"
"NgRbB27cIQI","6858080","6860080"," Squeezes up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6860080","6864080"," You get the five minute cross right here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6864080","6865080"," Confirms here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6865080","6868080"," You're going to see the squeeze up to the hourly trigger."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6868080","6871080"," Remember that is 4588 somewhere in there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6871080","6874080"," Uh, and you'll be trying to short that down."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6874080","6884080"," If you lose that short, uh, you will see, uh, if you lose that short, you will see, uh, if you lose that short down here, you will see the squeeze up to."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6884080","6888080"," Right where we were on the cell."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6888080","6893080"," You guys have any other questions? So my, my parting words with you tonight is this."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6893080","6896080"," Um, be on your toes."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6896080","6899080"," Um, we are due for a correction."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6899080","6903080"," We are due for volatility in the marketplace."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6903080","6906080"," Uh, as we attempt to make new highs."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6906080","6912080"," Uh, I want you to know that there are going to be places where you should definitively short."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6912080","6916080"," In places that you should definitively sell if you're along this market."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6916080","6920080"," And there are places that you can look for to safely take along."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6920080","6922080"," Uh, so come back in this video in your own free time."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6922080","6924080"," Uh, see what I'm talking about."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6924080","6927080"," You guys in stream already know that I show you the setups."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6927080","6931080"," On how to take a long or short with confidence."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6931080","6933080"," That applies to every timeframe."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6933080","6939080"," Uh, when you should be entering a short when you should be entering a long, a long call, I should say."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6939080","6942080"," Are shorting the market or a long put."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6942080","6945080"," Um, you guys understand all that."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6945080","6948080"," You guys left out there watching right now."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6948080","6953080"," Um, so you guys know where to take your shorts or take a long put and you guys know where to take a call."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6953080","6956080"," Uh, with confidence, uh, we're in safety."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6962080","6966080"," Uh, they will look different. Uh, depends on your, your app that you're looking at."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6968080","6971080"," Uh, thanks, Deanna. So, uh, be, be careful out there."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6971080","6974080"," If you're a bull and you're trying to get long, this is not the place."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6974080","6980080"," If you're a short, a bull trying to get short, you are coming into some places to short again."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6981080","6984080"," Uh, if we have continued downside and you miss a short, that's okay."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6984080","6988080"," Uh, don't be short or long puts in the wrong fucking place."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6988080","6992080"," You already know what the, what the answer is that you're going to get fucking destroyed."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6992080","6996080"," Like, and you don't need the first, that's the other thing."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6996080","6998080"," I want to tell you one last thing here."
"NgRbB27cIQI","6998080","7003080"," You don't need to be the first fucking short in and you don't need to be the first buyer in either. Okay."

"NgRbB27cIQI","7038080","7041080"," Like you're shorting that right there. Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","7041080","7045080"," You already know that if you don't see that happen, if you see price come up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","7045080","7046080"," Right."

"NgRbB27cIQI","7072080","7078080"," I would be looking for this EMA to come up."
"NgRbB27cIQI","7078080","7080080"," Right."
"NgRbB27cIQI","7080080","7083080"," I'd be looking for this EMA to come up right here."
