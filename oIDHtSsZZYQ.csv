"oIDHtSsZZYQ","0","7000"," Let's see if this works."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","30000","37000"," Okay, let's see."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","37000","42000"," Why is this saying 909?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","42000","50000"," Let's see if this is..."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","50000","56000"," Okay, so this should be..."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","56000","57000"," Is this better?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","57000","59000"," This looks like the feed's not tracked."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","59000","61000"," It's weird how the..."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","61000","63000"," It's like the feed's fine right now,"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","63000","67000"," and then there's this slow latency that takes place over time."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","67000","72000"," It's like right now it's showing the time as within a minute."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","72000","79000"," I don't know if that's YouTube, if that's my internet connection."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","79000","82000"," So you guys have got me in live stream now again."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","82000","85000"," Actually live and not a six minute delay."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","85000","88000"," Hopefully, or maybe a one minute delay."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","88000","93000"," That shouldn't be too bad."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","93000","98000"," So I do want you to see, so there's some things to understand that we still have more buyers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","98000","103000"," Buyers are still being consumed on the spy this morning."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","103000","110000"," I do want you to see that the hero indicator is high on the spy as well."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","110000","114000"," The hero indicator is showing that people are buying calls on the spy."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","114000","117000"," It looks like, you know, it's like dip buyers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","117000","120000"," You're buying the dip and then riding it up for ten minutes."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","120000","124000"," Like, boiler rooms would do."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","124000","133000"," There is a conversation out there that JPM is actually going to buy the market on Friday."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","133000","137000"," Anywhere from ten to fifteen billion dollars."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","137000","141000"," Now, if they buy the market, that should be a positive on the market."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","142000","144000"," There is some problems though."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","144000","153000"," We have flow for expansion on individual tickers into January, February and March and beyond."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","153000","160000"," But we don't have any expansion of flow, positive flow or negative flow either."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","160000","166000"," On the major tickers on Tesla, Apple, spy, IWM."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","166000","168000"," You're not seeing anything."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","169000","176000"," You have to differentiate between hedging activity and call and put flow activity because"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","176000","183000"," they're treated separately and differently by the market makers, by the dealers, the brokers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","183000","188000"," What does my point behind that?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","188000","194000"," The point behind that is that what will end up happening is we will end up trading sideways"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","194000","196000"," into Thursday, Friday."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","196000","204000"," As people don't make money on their conservative in the money positions that they're taking,"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","204000","209000"," they'll start to burn their positions, they'll panic, sell out of their positions and then"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","209000","215000"," of course the market will either swoop up or even just sell down and consolidate down,"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","215000","219000"," down, down as time passes."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","219000","222000"," What does that mean for you as a trader?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","222000","227000"," That means that you should be trading theta burning strategies, condors, butterflies."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","227000","235000"," It means you don't trade and you wait."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","235000","239000"," The hero indicator is great on the spy right now though, so I don't say to you."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","239000","244000"," What I'm going to say to you is this is that I've basically got a straddle on the market myself"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","244000","249000"," right now and, or at least on the spy, I've got a straddle and I'm looking for one side"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","249000","257000"," of the other to print at some point between now and the weekend."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","257000","260000"," Okay, so let's talk about the hero indicator."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","260000","262000"," We'll talk about that once more."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","262000","267000"," So on the hero indicator, okay?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","267000","269000"," This is the green line that's right here."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","269000","271000"," This is the hero indicator."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","271000","275000"," You have the bubbles, see the red bubble here and the green bubble here."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","275000","280000"," Those bubbles are equity buys and sells."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","280000","288000"," These lines that you see here, these are the supply of buyers here, supply of buyers,"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","288000","291000"," and above are the supply of sellers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","291000","294000"," So you've got, right now you've got, when they're deep dark red like this,"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","294000","297000"," it means you've got a lot of sellers above at 1,100."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","297000","300000"," You've got a lot of sellers above at 1,120."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","300000","304000"," You've got a small resistance and this is what you would consider a resistance."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","304000","310000"," So when people are snapping lines out there, you have what people are telling you are"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","310000","316000"," support and resistance and then you have real time support and resistance for when you're"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","316000","317000"," trading, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","317000","320000"," So you know where the supply of buyers and sellers are."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","320000","325000"," Right now you can tell that there's less buyers on the bottom right hand side than there are"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","325000","327000"," sellers of equities, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","327000","332000"," Real buyers, real sellers, that's the CVD buyers and CVD sellers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","333000","340000"," And then you've got these little triangles here and these triangles show you the option"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","340000","348000"," flow, real-time options flow on and their impact on the equity flow."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","348000","353000"," And what that translates to down below here is this green line."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","353000","357000"," And this green line is showing you if there's more calls or more puts."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","357000","363000"," And what makes this important is let's say Tesla's flat right now and you see a big green"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","363000","369000"," giant bar above of just call activity and the stock hasn't moved up yet, it's implying"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","369000","373000"," that the stock is eventually going to rip much higher."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","373000","379000"," If the stock was flat or going up and you saw the hero indicator pinned down below for a"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","379000","384000"," long period of time, could take an hour, could take three, four, five hours, you would then"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","384000","389000"," see the stock, even though the stock was up, you would see it dip or crash or correct"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","389000","392000"," or whatever."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","392000","399000"," I don't personally trust the hero indicator on a smaller time frame, but on a, let's say"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","399000","403000"," if the hero indicator stays up all day long, I have a lot of faith in it that we are going"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","403000","410000"," higher or we're going lower if it's dipping lower all day long."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","411000","417000"," And a prime example of the hero indicator is on MU, it is blasting higher."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","417000","423000"," So like the MU hero indicator today, we'll give you this as an example of what I'm looking"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","423000","424000"," for."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","424000","432000"," So when I'm in MU calls right now, if any of you are wondering, I'm in 100 C's on MU, the"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","432000","435000"," nearest expiry."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","436000","442000"," And I want you to see if you're bullish on a, so right now you can't, or I'm not bullish"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","442000","447000"," on the spy right now, because of the cost structure that's out there, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","447000","452000"," I know that there's more buyers than sellers, but I'm also looking for the option flow to"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","452000","457000"," be overwhelming in the bull's favor."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","457000","462000"," And so we're going to take a look at MU and why I like MU right now."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","462000","483000"," Okay, so MU, the tight, just a second here."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","484000","510000"," I'm getting more lag."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","510000","512000"," More lag."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","512000","523000"," Don't give me lag over the Internet's."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","523000","526000"," Hey, Mark, it's a mayhem."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","526000","533000"," You're awesome, man."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","534000","541000"," Okay, so earlier we had 1.5 times the number of buyers of MU, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","541000","543000"," And now it's slacked off."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","543000","548000"," You see that the buy side supply has slacked off on MU."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","548000","552000"," We have more, less buyers than we have sellers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","552000","557000"," The hero indicator is still quite high, but you're seeing that slack off."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","557000","562000"," So you'll see this represented in a candlestick chart on Webull."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","563000","572000"," And you're seeing it right now live where MU is starting to lag, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","572000","576000"," Or take a break."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","576000","584000"," If you guys put a chart up for MU, you'll see this in live how it's taking place."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","584000","589000"," Earlier, you saw lots of buyers coming in, a rush of buyers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","589000","598000"," You saw a rush of calls on the hero indicator, and now you start to see, and you take a breather at this point."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","598000","604000"," You're starting to see the hero indicator pull back as well on MU, which is not positive."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","604000","611000"," I'm going to have to saw it on my calls, which sucks."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","611000","618000"," I want to saw it on my calls on MU."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","618000","640000"," I'm not looking for you."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","640000","669000"," My straddle is not a spiral quick."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","670000","673000"," There's not much going on spy either."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","673000","677000"," So I'll just sit sideways action, guys."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","677000","678000"," What I'll do is I'll leave."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","678000","680000"," Do you guys want me to leave Tesla up for today?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","680000","696000"," Because I'm going to take a break here, and I don't see much happening in the market."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","696000","698000"," This looks like all sideways movement to me."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","698000","723000"," I can leave Tesla up if you want."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","724000","727000"," You can see your buy side on Tesla right now is 1060."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","727000","739000"," You can see that your sell side is 1100 on Tesla."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","739000","747000"," What I'll do is I'll leave Tesla up running right now for you, and I will come back and switch to spy."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","747000","749000"," The market's boring to me right now."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","749000","753000"," I don't know about all you guys out there right now, but for me, it's kind of boring."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","753000","755000"," It's sideways movement."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","755000","763000"," Unless you see some heavy call flow or big hedging coming in on the buy or even sell side, you're not going to see much movement."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","763000","768000"," I think everybody's waiting for JPM to find a guess."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","768000","770000"," Yeah, I had breakfast already."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","770000","776000"," I made myself breakfast at like 5 AM."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","776000","777000"," What do I think of Tesla?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","778000","780000"," I think it's what I said earlier."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","780000","785000"," I think that it has to do with."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","785000","787000"," I'll repeat it one last time."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","787000","790000"," I know some of you guys have heard me say it three four times."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","790000","793000"," So right now."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","793000","795000"," Today's Wednesday, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","795000","802000"," We rolled into Monday and everyone knows the ceiling is 4800 right now."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","802000","808000"," And then you've got major tickers like Tesla and Apple and everything, everybody trades."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","808000","810000"," And they all kind of know where the ceiling is."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","810000","817000"," So all the calls that I keep seeing coming in, it's all in the money stuff expiring on Friday."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","817000","823000"," You've got consolidation on the equity buying side of these tickers."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","823000","828000"," And then you've got people waiting on news of the hedges that are coming in on Friday."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","828000","836000"," So if you don't have any expansion with farther dated calls and popular tickers, everyone's buying calls in the money for Friday expiration."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","836000","841000"," You're not going to see us go to that 480 and make him print."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","841000","846000"," What you'll end up seeing is we'll trade sideways into Friday and you'll see call buyers panic."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","846000","850000"," All these FOMO buyers will end up panicking as we head into Friday."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","850000","852000"," Eventually get rid of their calls."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","852000","857000"," We'll trade down slowly and lightly into Friday until expiry."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","857000","862000"," And then we'll find out what the hedging is and people will make the place their bets once again."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","862000","867000"," People will start placing bets for after the third based upon what the hedging activity is."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","867000","874000"," So everybody's just waiting too much information for too many people that all seem to know the same stuff, right?"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","874000","880000"," We talked about that I think in an earlier video."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","880000","888000"," Yep, heroin indicators turning positive on Tesla."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","888000","892000"," Well, and subscribe from that one. We'll just leave Tesla up right now."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","892000","896000"," And I'm going to I'm going to I have to take I'm going to take 10 minutes."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","896000","900000"," I'm going to make a phone call and check with my my insurance service provider."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","900000","905000"," I want to find out if I have the best plan that they offer."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","905000","909000"," I have I have cable internet through Comcast and I thought I had the best."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","909000","916000"," But I need to check because I feel like I'm either being throttled right now or maybe it's down in my neighborhood."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","916000","920000"," Maybe they're doing some work on my my internet connection right now."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","920000","925000"," So I need to put them and see what's up."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","925000","929000"," So I'm going to check back with you guys in just a bit here."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","929000","934000"," And I'm going to log on I'm going to leave the live stream up and try to get this."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","934000","938000"," I'll try to get this find out what's going on with this feed why it's locking up like this."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","938000","940000"," This looks like internet to me."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","940000","943000"," So I need to I need to check with my."
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","959000","961000"," You"
"oIDHtSsZZYQ","989000","991000"," You"
