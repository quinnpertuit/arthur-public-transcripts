"11030","22260"," You know,"
"22400","40700"," it keeps getting burned in"
"40700","41080"," there."
"66540","67860"," This, this, this. "
"84050","85010"," Good morning."
"86650","88370"," It's a weird disco around, dude."
"92560","93520"," Alright, let's go. "
"103510","104450"," You know, it's kind of weird."
"104590","105870"," I don't even know if my, uh..."
"107290","108910"," My monitor is gonna be right here."
"111390","112030"," Find out. "
"117980","119440"," I didn't check you out this morning."
"119580","120060"," Hang tight there."
"121620","123060"," Alright, good morning. "
"124140","125480"," I'm running a little bit behind here."
"125600","126200"," Just give me a second."
"132920","134060"," Good morning, everybody. "
"135340","139120"," I'm a little tired this morning, and I've got a, um..."
"140280","142000"," I have some stuff that I have to do this morning."
"144160","144760"," Um..."
"144760","146240"," While we're on stream."
"153920","162840"," I went out last night and then didn't get home until late. "
"163880","170260"," Although, you know, what's cool is that I've got a, I was given a handwritten recipe for..."
"171760","173460"," I believe Chick-fil-A."
"173460","174700"," I forget this right here."
"177360","180120"," A handwritten recipe for Chick-fil-A chicken nuggets. "
"181820","183760"," I didn't get a chance to make them last night."
"187340","191640"," But I do think I can make them tonight."
"193360","193700"," Good morning. "
"193820","194260"," How's everybody doing?"
"196120","200540"," Uh, coming into the open right now, I do have, I have not put the levels up yet at this"
"200540","200800"," point."
"201340","202840"," I was running a little bit late this morning."
"203440","207920"," Uh, I stayed up late, kinda late last night trying to short the market until like midnight or"
"207920","208200"," something. "
"208940","213140"," Uh, so I'm just, I'm just dr- not dragging ass, but just falling behind this where I normally am"
"213140","215780"," up at 4, 5, 6 in the morning somewhere in there."
"216580","218420"," And I slept through all that stuff this morning."
"220920","222100"," Just give me a minute here. "
"229820","231180"," I'm not shorting, selling the market."
"236540","239620"," Okay, so, uh, pivot point for this morning."
"241520","243020"," We'll do this together here. "
"247620","249880"," No audio on YouTube, you guys don't have any audio."
"250740","252220"," Are you sure you don't have any audio out there?"
"253420","254940"," Someone's saying that we don't have any audio."
"256100","258760"," Can you, can anyone confirm on YouTube that we don't have any audio?"
"268120","271160"," Can someone, yeah, so my, so my mic is fine, right?"
"272500","274280"," Yeah, can you hear me on YouTube?"
"280540","281760"," Can anyone check YouTube?"
"281760","285740"," I've got a YouTuber saying, so YouTube does have audio. "
"286260","287500"," Uh, Binky, you sure, man?"
"293010","295610"," Okay, so there is, there is good audio."
"295970","296650"," Audio is fine on YouTube."
"296910","296970"," Okay. "
"299670","302450"," Give me a second here and we'll get the levels up for you."
"302590","310010"," So the pivot point this morning is 4.12. Um, and I'm still, I've got, um, 4.15 C's that"
"310010","314390"," I got at the belly yesterday at bottom for 26 cents yesterday."
"314730","315810"," 26 or 24. "
"316190","317790"," I haven't looked to see somewhere in there."
"318270","321190"," They went up to like 33, 35 or something like that in the bell."
"321730","324630"," They're now at nine cents right now, so they are down. "
"325810","331150"," And I bought them on a, uh, I bought them on, uh, February Opex."
"331450","334090"," We, I'll be a second here."
"334790","341990"," 4.12.22. February Opex, we gapped up overnight. "
"343370","345190"," And I was fascinated by that."
"345230","349810"," I was fascinated by that, uh, that statement and."
"351550","353110"," It's very similar to. "
"353990","355730"," I'm still holding those, by the way."
"355850","357430"," I'm going to explain right now why I'm holding them."
"357570","359210"," Usually, like an overnight hold. "
"360230","362250"," I will take money and run."
"364110","367150"," Uh, I don't hold, like if I'm in a winning position."
"367150","374670"," And normally a losing position to, if I'm down like two pennies or I have it. "
"374770","376110"," Let's say I hold, let's say I buy a position."
"376330","380370"," It's 30 cents or 40 cents overnight, right?"
"382090","387110"," And, uh, they're flat when I, when the market opens, I'll normally close them and renegotiate."
"387190","389390"," Let the market open up renegotiate the trade. "
"389990","393670"," If the, if the trade is down too much where, let's say it's like a 30 cent."
"393670","402910"," So last night, I think it was 26 cents, the 35 cents into the close at 4.15. And they're"
"402910","404770"," down like they're eight cents right now."
"405770","406970"," So I'm going to sell those. "
"407330","407650"," Fuck."
"407710","409590"," No, I'm going to leave them, leave them as they are."
"410290","413870"," Uh, in the past, I would add to that position on an opening bell like this. "
"414310","415770"," I'm not going to do that at this point."
"415770","425180"," And there's a bear plane here in the five minute, just above right here."
"426220","428480"," So I want to see how this plays out right here. "
"429500","434660"," If it's a matter of testing this bear plane or if we're able to break out and close this gap"
"434660","435360"," above here."
"436200","440560"," If I can get up there, I'll sell them and reposition myself then."
"443300","446180"," Now your pivot point right now is 412, 22. "
"447180","450220"," We're going to go back and talk about the February Opex."
"452400","455460"," Uh, because it, it kind of fits my narrative."
"456540","458360"," Well, it kind of fits it. "
"459060","460440"," 414, 22."
"464820","466000"," Yeah, no worries, Bink."
"466080","466540"," I got your brother. "
"468540","472040"," And we're going to talk about that February Opex this morning."
"472040","475940"," It's kind of an important one to look at and what's really cool about it."
"476000","478660"," I think we're going to have on 414, 22. "
"479360","486280"," I think at some point this morning, we're going to either have on or chat with Chase Winter."
"487800","491180"," And what's fat, we had a great conversation after the belly yesterday."
"492160","497900"," And it's centered around the February Opex R2s at 415, 42. "
"497900","504140"," And I think I don't, don't hold me to this, but I think I remember."
"506760","508740"," That February Opex, right?"
"508960","511460"," We'll go over it more in depth, but I remember that."
"513159","516840"," Like in hindsight, people are going to say, oh, February Opex was great. "
"517740","521159"," But February Opex, uh, into March blew out."
"521620","525140"," A lot of traders, 417, 42."
"526300","530040"," Yeah, it didn't matter if you were a bull or a bear. "
"530320","536620"," Now we, in this stream, we made a lot of money during that Opex, but, but we got, we had"
"536620","542160"," to be so tactful in that Opex and into that end of month."
"542320","543120"," It was wild."
"543600","546520"," We were, we were going up, I think, don't quote me on this. "
"546620","547560"," We'll go back and look at it."
"549060","552320"," But we were looking, so here's our R3, R2, R1."
"552320","554420"," There's gaps everywhere, too. "
"554540","555380"," You can see them, right?"
"555560","559940"," We've got all kinds of gaps above being left behind."
"560300","561560"," There's one right there, right?"
"563420","567260"," We got, we're littered with gaps to the upside here."
"569020","569840"," We got them everywhere. "
"570020","574180"," We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
"575960","577740"," Yeah, that's that 418 right there."
"581980","585860"," We're just leaving them behind, like one after another after another after another to the upside"
"585860","586220"," here. "
"589060","593080"," Now, the reason I'm bringing this up is because we're going to go back and look at it this morning."
"594000","595320"," I remember that time."
"595600","601440"," One of the most fascinating parts of that of that Opex was that as a group, we. "
"603200","607500"," As a group, one of those days we'd gone up insane overnight."
"607500","616980"," We held, we actually bought overnight calls into that Tuesday and we blasted it up."
"617680","621460"," And Omar was making a point of this yesterday in the stream. "
"622840","624340"," And we ripped faces off."
"624820","629760"," And we ripped the faces off so much that we took profit right on the bell the next morning"
"629760","630100"," together."
"633200","635340"," And we started selling relentlessly. "
"637460","639060"," Off of that morning bell."
"639940","642220"," And I remember, I think I remember this."
"642720","647920"," Tell me if I'm wrong, but I think I remember a chase like kick the door in. "
"650280","654820"," In the in stream like busted in and was like, you're all getting pulled up in here."
"655940","661040"," And it was hilarious because we were all sitting in stream like, dude, we made tons of money."
"661040","661760"," Everything is great. "
"662420","663620"," None of us got caught in it."
"664600","669560"," And we sold hard and heavy all morning long at the end of the day."
"671960","679380"," But what was even more fascinating was once that selling was done, we wound up going up like 300"
"679380","680120"," points. "
"682000","689800"," And we didn't leave a single single stop behind to the upside."
"691700","693280"," We didn't leave a single stop behind."
"693780","700420"," And in in hindsight, you'll hear traders will be like, oh, it was great. "
"701480","705680"," But I remember that stream because we left those we literally went up for like three straight days."
"705680","706460"," It was like 300 points."
"707360","713080"," And then we then we proceeded to roll like another 300 or 500 points or something. "
"713120","713820"," It was wild."
"715100","720900"," And if you weren't tactful in your training and at that time, I can remember now."
"721180","722980"," I was thinking about it now for the past couple days. "
"723920","725380"," It blew a lot of people out."
"726580","730180"," If you're one of those people that are like, I have to be a bull or I have to be"
"730180","730480"," a bear."
"731640","732620"," That kind of stuff. "
"733200","738920"," You got torched and it didn't matter if it was on the swing down or the swing up."
"739420","741600"," If you were committed to this."
"742640","744760"," Well, you basically got blown out, right?"
"744960","746540"," Either we're going up or we're going down. "
"746900","749720"," You're committed to this one way that we trade."
"751020","751880"," This thesis."
"753520","758360"," I remember at that time, people were like, you know, what's going on or I closed my shorts. "
"758940","760420"," There are people saying like close my shorts."
"760420","761940"," I closed my lungs."
"762900","764200"," Either side of that trade. "
"766460","768720"," That's three, four, seven, eighty three."
"769460","771460"," That's two, four, oh, eight, ninety one."
"772040","772780"," I get that wrong. "
"773700","774700"," Four, nine, oh two."
"775700","779120"," A little bit higher right there."
"779340","779780"," Close enough. "
"787000","788980"," And so we're going to take a look at."
"789320","792400"," We're going to take a look at that time period today briefly."
"799250","800950"," Four, twelve, twenty seven. "
"811620","813180"," I really trigger four, twelve."
"814540","822190"," I say it was four, twelve, twenty seven."
"828720","829940"," That one right there. "
"838690","840450"," Four, nine, seven, eight."
"840570","842290"," It's pretty close to what it was yesterday for the DT."
"843190","843730"," It's going down. "
"854790","856910"," Now, of course, that's not happening today, right?"
"857530","858950"," So this Tuesday of."
"860210","861090"," This Tuesday."
"862470","864190"," We're teeing right off right now. "
"864310","866770"," This confirmation of a downward move just heads up on that."
"867270","872710"," You can see the bear plane right back here in cash market."
"873450","877010"," That's seven a.m. We're teeing off right now right on the hourly trigger. "
"877390","877670"," The downside."
"880310","881630"," I grab some puts here."
"893110","894810"," Oh, maybe I'll wait just a second here. "
"896990","897990"," Get a better price."
"904740","906440"," I'm not going to execute just that."
"906540","908660"," I want to make sure I get the right price and the stuff. "
"919700","921320"," I want to say I don't get positioned here."
"946800","951220"," The early on the early of VIX is like kind of top ish."
"951380","951700"," Not really. "
"954580","956060"," The early VIX is like."
"958980","960180"," Kind of top ish."
"960400","963900"," Like the hourly on the well. "
"963900","967140"," So the daily is starting to get strong finally on the VIX."
"970760","977180"," The hourly is a little bearish on the VIX, but not the daily."
"978060","979140"," So I'm going to hold tight here. "
"979780","981580"," I want this to open up a little bit before I take a trade."
"984340","985980"," At least watch this for a minute."
"987820","990840"," I could have some sideways trading then a drop later. "
"994400","995920"," Look at the spy really quick."
"999620","1001560"," Spy early is bearish."
"1022840","1026560"," Dude, the daily chart is getting bullish dude on spy man. "
"1027400","1028319"," Fucking daily dude."
"1028640","1029319"," So the daily is."
"1029460","1032260"," So the hourly is kind of bearish on spy, but the daily is bullish. "
"1033500","1034680"," Getting some mixed readings here."
"1040190","1041250"," Just a second here."
"1047180","1048720"," Guys all up on Twitch. "
"1055600","1056720"," What are you guys saying here?"
"1057020","1060960"," Dude, you're in JP Uncle J.B.J. Red on."
"1061160","1062540"," Where are you at in JP right now in traffic?"
"1064000","1065360"," Are you in the Jamaica way?"
"1067060","1068160"," You're on center street."
"1069060","1069240"," Hi park. "
"1069240","1070000"," Where are you?"
"1071360","1073880"," You're in Washington street going to watch some punk band in a bar."
"1081800","1082440"," Yeah, man."
"1082740","1087420"," Winky the daily is like I'm not like I was like I'm going to buy some puts them like fuck"
"1087420","1088620"," no buying no puts. "
"1091400","1098440"," And the VIX on the hourly is like bullish on spy and bearish on VIX, but the daily on VIX"
"1098440","1098980"," is bullish."
"1104410","1106370"," Still long those calls right now."
"1110950","1112470"," And have not bought puts. "
"1115310","1117230"," Where are you at right now JBJ?"
"1118250","1119210"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"1119410","1120510"," My dude JBJ."
"1120590","1122150"," I got some we got a gap up here to close. "
"1124130","1126970"," JBJ is so my dad owned a bunch of houses there."
"1127130","1128210"," They used to be worthless."
"1128850","1129950"," Jamaica plain was a dump. "
"1131990","1135070"," Into like the early eighties."
"1136590","1141410"," And then it started then it started and like now it's like unattainable to live there."
"1142950","1144230"," And he sold those houses. "
"1144230","1145150"," He never should have sold them."
"1145170","1145710"," He should have kept them."
"1147230","1149130"," Trying to close that gap above right now. "
"1149890","1152170"," My calls are coming back to life, baby."
"1152890","1153690"," Woo hoo."
"1156430","1158530"," How do you not lose money in the market?"
"1159690","1162950"," Don't realize unrealized losses. "
"1163570","1172560"," A little gap right here."
"1175460","1180140"," Having this one right here is previous high is kind of right there."
"1181320","1185460"," You got another one pre market high right there. "
"1185540","1186840"," It's like a band of it right here."
"1188620","1193940"," I should probably like some of the better like the rational traders like just sell right here."
"1196760","1199160"," Take take take take the L and move on. "
"1202880","1204020"," I'm leaving them on though."
"1204120","1204600"," I didn't touch them."
"1206880","1208320"," We'll consider those a lot. "
"1208480","1209660"," We'll put those in the Lotto pile."
"1213890","1215290"," We're going to do a couple things today."
"1215390","1216250"," So we're going to do a few things. "
"1216490","1218730"," I've got some important things to do with you this morning."
"1219290","1221010"," Number one, we're going to go back and look at February."
"1223010","1223410"," Opax. "
"1224390","1225870"," That's a point of contention."
"1226910","1230610"," And so Chase and I were talking about February yesterday in the phone."
"1231830","1234510"," And the wild swings that took place in the market. "
"1234890","1238730"," We actually traded that on the stream very well up and down both ways."
"1241950","1244090"," But Fintuit got real quiet."
"1245930","1247070"," During that Opax. "
"1248250","1250730"," A lot of Fintuit did not do well."
"1251090","1255970"," And I did have private conversations with some, you know, like Fintwitters that are good trainers."
"1256130","1259070"," And they're like, I didn't do well during that Opax. "
"1261970","1268450"," There was a there was a squeeze in there right that squows out every single short in the market."
"1269850","1271190"," Shorts that didn't take profit."
"1271750","1274870"," I started getting squeezed and it just never ended. "
"1275550","1277550"," And then we rolled hard and heavy."
"1278870","1282890"," Now months later, there are some bears out there that I know that are like, oh, no, I helped"
"1282890","1283530"," through all of it."
"1283530","1285130"," And I'm like, no, I don't remember it like that. "
"1285570","1288090"," I could be wrong, but that's how I remember it."
"1290510","1299330"," And this is kind of the thing where when we talk about Can you put a trade on that can"
"1299330","1304090"," withstand a trip to 430 the past few weeks past two weeks here."
"1305330","1306750"," Talked about ratio spreads. "
"1307050","1310390"," I've posted them, I think, three or four times in the last two or three weeks."
"1311630","1314090"," Ratio spreads, ratio spreads, ratio spreads."
"1314430","1319130"," You've got to put a ratio spread on so you can withstand a trip to 420 or 430. "
"1321810","1324450"," Again, beeps for a bull cross here."
"1326190","1329210"," And it's right here in this yellow and white line and a five minute chart."
"1329410","1331350"," This would be the cross on a one minute chart. "
"1333190","1338150"," We are getting a bull plane currently on the spy."
"1338690","1341170"," So we're going to look back on that."
"1341610","1350290"," We're going to look back on that Opax specifically to say to you, you know, you can say, you can"
"1350290","1351210"," say all you want. "
"1351530","1352990"," Hey, I can withstand anything."
"1353230","1353990"," My thesis is right."
"1354130","1354930"," I stick to it. "
"1355670","1360090"," If you look back on that February into early March, time period."
"1361670","1369330"," You look at that and say, my thesis is bull or my thesis is bear and I'm sticking to it."
"1370250","1374410"," I'd probably say maybe one out of a hundred investors or traders or whatever you want to call"
"1374410","1374770"," yourself. "
"1375510","1377930"," Who would stand any of those moves."
"1378630","1381590"," You basically had to trade them, day trade them up and down."
"1384130","1385730"," And not have a thesis. "
"1387290","1394970"," I'm really not believing that many bulls or bears in that Opax were able to stick with any thesis."
"1398090","1402310"," Still a failure to close the gap above right now."
"1403230","1404450"," The gap is still there. "
"1407170","1409110"," My calls are all over the place right now."
"1412230","1416130"," So we'll take a look over there real quick and let's see if we can line this up here."
"1422140","1424460"," I don't know if I can look back an hour. "
"1424660","1426240"," I think on the four hour I can look back."
"1435780","1437020"," Yeah, this is it right here."
"1468590","1471270"," 17, 21st, 17th. "
"1471370","1479220"," So this right here, this is that Friday of Opax right here."
"1481440","1486800"," This is Thursday, right Wednesday, Tuesday."
"1489300","1496260"," And you might think this isn't much, but this is the this is that Monday we actually ripped faces"
"1496260","1496580"," off. "
"1496580","1498000"," So it came into the Monday of Opax week."
"1498960","1503320"," We gapped and look at how high we gapped up here in the overnight."
"1506540","1513560"," Monster move, we went from 407.83 at 10 a.m. Easton time we get U.S. business inventories month"
"1513560","1523560"," over month forecast of 0% on the prize. "
"1523560","1530600"," We also expect comments from E.C. Beasley guard who gives a law day show for conferral of state"
"1530600","1534440"," prize of North Rhine West failure to Angela Merkel in Cologne."
"1534920","1540420"," And feds bar who testifies before the house financial services committee in its semi annual hearing"
"1540420","1541800"," on supervision and regulation."
"1542640","1545300"," Text has already been made available for this. "
"1548040","1553060"," And so you got this right here and this is the 14th right we come into the 15th."
"1553060","1555960"," And we peek out up here, right?"
"1556100","1559640"," But you I want you to notice that this move up here, this like depths of hell we've got on"
"1559640","1560180"," the 10th."
"1560780","1564300"," Scream all the way higher field to make a new high on the 14th, right?"
"1565060","1569420"," Come back up again into and this this pre market one was the gnarly one. "
"1569780","1576300"," We were all the way up to 416 70 traded down another failure and then we traded down to the"
"1576300","1577400"," depths of hell down here, right?"
"1577400","1584460"," Just relentless one, two, three, four, 20 second into the 24th 27th coming to the third, right?"
"1584760","1586920"," We could we blast up for just three more days."
"1589020","1592400"," And got it back down all the way down here to 380."
"1594100","1599040"," And then we ripped faces off and came all the way back up here went to 417. "
"1599700","1601780"," I believe it was 420 all day long."
"1602680","1605080"," We had this something similar happen in here."
"1605240","1606060"," This is back on. "
"1606360","1607420"," Let me see if I can show you."
"1615260","1617160"," The January opex, right?"
"1617740","1619840"," And the January opex coming into this opex."
"1619980","1625720"," We blast it all the way up into into that Friday and then sold, right?"
"1626480","1628900"," But then ripped faces off to the 18th. "
"1629080","1634720"," This is January opex and the February opex violent moves to the downside, right?"
"1636460","1638660"," And then right back up again."
"1639380","1641640"," So my key point here is that."
"1644520","1651080"," Whether we ripped faces off it so the January opex faces off up into it and the February opex we"
"1651080","1652140"," went blasting down. "
"1652560","1659000"," And we ended up coming right back up in here and did not crash right below trend."
"1659000","1664760"," And this is that window of weakness that's being talked about that should start today or tomorrow."
"1667390","1670130"," And so even heading into this opex here. "
"1670850","1675070"," Chase and I were talking yesterday and he was like, well, we're not going to do that rip faces off"
"1675070","1675830"," into this opex."
"1676450","1677770"," And not into the first."
"1677970","1684650"," We're going to roll over into that opex and then bloodbath and continue down into the second of"
"1684650","1684970"," June. "
"1685610","1695330"," That this is it to expect the unclenching of the market beginning today into beginning today into"
"1695330","1698010"," Monday of next week."
"1699710","1701210"," And which way do we go here?"
"1701330","1704430"," Do we go all the way down below or do we make the trip higher?"
"1705590","1708430"," And so you've got people out there not this isn't Chase."
"1708810","1711090"," This is other people saying that that's it. "
"1711290","1711990"," We're done, right?"
"1712510","1714450"," We're going to roll down to the depths of hell."
"1714450","1718670"," And we're likely going and their claim is three sixty this time."
"1719190","1724170"," Not not three eight or excuse me, not three eighty three seventy eight. "
"1726630","1728550"," This stream is sponsored by now."
"1728630","1732410"," If you look back on January and February went up, but February went down, right?"
"1732770","1733830"," Forex and stock instruments."
"1734370","1736310"," You see three ninety six down here. "
"1736630","1740870"," This would be the normal unclench right as we head in if we go negative."
"1740870","1746750"," The normal unclench would be somewhere down here at three ninety four three ninety six."
"1748450","1751590"," And they're not claiming that they're saying no, no, no, that's not enough. "
"1751870","1753170"," We're going to actually go down to."
"1755990","1758750"," The depths of hell down here, three sixty."
"1761470","1766370"," And we've made a great point yesterday saying three seventy four somewhere down here. "
"1767410","1769630"," Is probably the worst of it."
"1770870","1772350"," Maybe you can correct me if I'm wrong on this."
"1774350","1777890"," That's a fairly large steep drop right there. "
"1778730","1779970"," Pretty major, right?"
"1780190","1782890"," Three six three seventy six three six maybe three sixty."
"1783450","1789170"," Maybe the claim is that three sixty is the end of June, not so much beginning of June."
"1790170","1791530"," But we'll get down in there. "
"1809370","1810670"," Has Jason here right now?"
"1810790","1812990"," Time to get US business inventories."
"1813090","1814890"," He said he would show up today and talk to us about it."
"1814950","1816250"," Zero percent on the prize. "
"1816590","1817570"," Zero spot two percent."
"1819190","1823050"," USNAHB housing market index forecast forty five on the prize."
"1823270","1824990"," Yeah, so Chase is here this morning right now. "
"1825050","1830050"," So Chase, do you want to give us a rundown of the window of weakness coming up this week?"
"1830190","1836390"," You said that it could start on Tuesday or possibly Wednesday could take it could take into Monday."
"1836770","1839310"," North Carolina West Valley to Angela Merkel."
"1839550","1840350"," Where do you want to come on?"
"1840550","1841470"," Do you want to come on the stream?"
"1841550","1842370"," I can put you on the stream. "
"1842370","1843770"," I can send you a link."
"1843890","1845210"," You can do just audio if you want."
"1845290","1847090"," And you're hearing on supervision and regulation. "
"1847890","1851790"," We have posted the text on the live video for Feds Bar on the feed for all those interested."
"1857960","1861040"," Let me know, Chase, I can send you a DM with a link if you want."
"1867530","1868610"," Do you want to come on stream?"
"1872950","1874390"," What is Chase saying here?"
"1874390","1880050"," He says, uh, Jim mentioned the February to March period as a point of weakness way back in"
"1880050","1880350"," December. "
"1880570","1882190"," He also mentioned May to June."
"1882410","1886170"," Oh, this is worth a listen season one."
"1887310","1888690"," Two, two or see. "
"1888950","1889730"," I don't know what that means."
"1890510","1895390"," Twenty twenty two and unusual year for volatility featuring Jim Carson top traders unplugged."
"1896670","1899750"," You read it that this is not the period to be long. "
"1900610","1901950"," Cell and main go away."
"1902330","1904010"," I agree with cell and main go away."
"1904230","1905890"," Top traders unplugged podcast. "
"1912650","1913170"," Nice."
"1919690","1920350"," Excuse me."
"1924110","1925070"," There you go, Chase. "
"1933120","1935720"," Yeah, John Haggard, he's saying note the VIX roll tomorrow."
"1936000","1936800"," That's the other thing too."
"1936800","1939620"," Because we have a VIX operation tomorrow on Wednesday. "
"1940420","1943320"," And so you typically will buy the VIX right on clench of the VIX."
"1949470","1952670"," Yeah, so Chase just dropped the link in there for any of you that want to watch it."
"1961160","1966480"," Uh, Carrillo is saying a listen to that recent episode and think he's just playing coy to be"
"1966480","1966680"," honest. "
"1967360","1970660"," He knows his calls outs are getting front run consistently."
"1971540","1975220"," Chase is saying basically the market will unpin around to data opex."
"1975220","1978720"," Then there is a two week window of weakness maybe longer. "
"1980520","1982800"," He's saying that we aren't driving higher in this."
"1983160","1984920"," There is minimal call expansion."
"1985980","1987920"," These calls expire on opex. "
"1988260","1995440"," What I noticed yesterday was that there wasn't a lot of we were in stream yesterday, Chase, and we"
"1995440","1999720"," were talking about how there was not a lot of flow period."
"2000960","2002800"," The options market itself."
"2003300","2005440"," Overall, there is no fuel. "
"2006680","2007600"," Up or down."
"2007800","2008280"," We couldn't find."
"2008400","2010800"," I couldn't find any fuel to the upside or downside. "
"2011420","2012400"," There were like 400."
"2012720","2014720"," There was 350,000."
"2015540","2016900"," Zero date puts yesterday. "
"2017320","2019420"," And there were no calls to feed into it."
"2019840","2024640"," And then they use that that fuel to ride the market back up again."
"2024660","2026600"," But of course it ran out of fuel again. "
"2026600","2030480"," We could see that I think that the 350,000 puts had."
"2031740","2035720"," They were worth like 10 cents or 11 cents at one point yesterday afternoon."
"2042080","2047940"," He's concerned for Monday was that if we didn't get above the 20 day, then we lose supportive"
"2047940","2048440"," flows. "
"2048460","2053739"," We finished above aggressively yesterday and there are a ton of puts for June 16th."
"2053820","2055620"," I think there's more puts."
"2056060","2059280"," If I'm wrong on this, maybe one of you guys can check for me. "
"2059280","2065760"," I thought I saw more puts for June 24th or 6th, that I did for the 16th or 30th."
"2067179","2071400"," So market makers will switch and you won't have the support and buy every dip situation that has"
"2071400","2072739"," supported market in recent weeks."
"2083280","2087639"," And you're saying meanwhile Spock and several things noting sometime on Vickspiration on Wednesday"
"2087639","2088719"," and Friday OpEx. "
"2089460","2090739"," Hold on, I'm missing some of this, Chase."
"2091239","2092800"," You want to just read this stuff to me on air."
"2094719","2098820"," Sometimes around Vickspiration on Wednesday and Friday OpEx, things get nasty. "
"2099060","2103600"," They're saying the same thing as gem, but not telling you six months in advance."
"2103960","2109920"," Basically, all the puts have decayed and done their duty on the run up into 4150 or max 4,200"
"2109920","2111520"," SPX resistance areas."
"2111780","2115220"," And now there's a bunch of calls that will expire and unleash the pin. "
"2115440","2120940"," A pin that has lasted almost six weeks with nobody buying calls above now and a bunch of quarter."
"2121360","2123100"," I'm assuming quarterly expos."
"2132220","2139320"," And then Crilow is saying I don't disagree on the shift in profile post may OpEx, but we really"
"2139320","2144040"," need to flush out the positioning below spot first with a rip higher, my opinion. "
"2144280","2145260"," Yeah, I'm on the..."
"2145260","2148760"," For his March 2023, four reports on the feed for all those interested."
"2149700","2155980"," I'm on the idea that we go higher here, not lower."
"2156940","2159420"," I'm on the idea of..."
"2159420","2163020"," Let me see if I can visualize this. "
"2169290","2172250"," Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"2178080","2179620"," So Vickspiration here is tomorrow."
"2181260","2182760"," I do see weakness into Wednesday. "
"2184280","2186600"," For Vickspiration, we got tomorrow and then where's the first?"
"2189640","2191000"," Or the second dillies."
"2191200","2192220"," Yeah, right there, 6-1."
"2199450","2206510"," I'm on the mind of this weakness into Vickspiration, but I'm not totally convinced on us not trying"
"2206510","2210450"," to make our way back up here on Thursday, a big move higher on Thursday. "
"2212690","2217490"," And then some weakness again, but I want to see that move up into the first or second."
"2218010","2220250"," Whether that's 4-20, 4-30."
"2220410","2220690"," I don't know. "
"2220770","2222690"," I think it depends on what this Vickspiration does."
"2224210","2226590"," It's probably not the best line I could be drawing there."
"2241590","2243190"," Yeah, you got a 15 minute. "
"2243270","2246850"," We've got a bear across above and in the five minute we got one too."
"2247690","2248510"," Right back here."
"2249070","2254610"," Progressives and congressional Democrats about the Biden McCarthy deal that they fear rewards the"
"2254610","2256630"," Republicans for taking the debt limit hostage. "
"2258290","2261370"," The other trade here too is the fear and the debt ceiling, right?"
"2261570","2264170"," You saw yesterday, we're supposed to have a meeting with McCarthy and Biden."
"2264870","2270130"," They pushed it off to today till 3 p.m. And you already know that that meeting won't take place"
"2270130","2274210"," until 4 p.m. That meeting won't take place."
"2274410","2280470"," I can't guarantee it, but I'm going to give it like a 90% chance that they push that meeting"
"2280470","2282730"," off to after market hours, intentionally. "
"2283770","2290650"," Like that debt ceiling trade, that fear trade is valid regardless, right?"
"2291050","2292190"," Of how it's solved."
"2293150","2295270"," Whether it's solved or not, it doesn't matter."
"2297810","2299390"," That fear trade is real. "
"2329010","2331250"," Yeah, I saw the TLT dump yesterday."
"2331670","2338390"," I was, I was, yes, so Chase, I was very like yesterday, like, I'm bearish on TLT here without a"
"2338390","2338610"," doubt."
"2349860","2356220"," Concerns are rising amongst progressives and congressional Dems about a Biden McCarthy deal that"
"2356220","2359440"," they fear rewards the GOP for taking the debt limit hostage. "
"2361220","2362940"," I don't know what that means."
"2364040","2367900"," Speaking of McCarthy, there have been no progress in debt talks since last night."
"2368240","2369540"," That was at nine o'clock this morning. "
"2373140","2376560"," The Russell 2000 drops one spot one percent."
"2378480","2382960"," Fed's Messer saying I expect inflation to come back down with appropriate monetary policy."
"2383600","2385640"," We'll see material improvement this year. "
"2386240","2388200"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"2388660","2390620"," I think part of my part of my issue."
"2391700","2396600"," We're talking I was talking to chase yesterday and I was like, man, I was like, I like this idea"
"2396600","2397360"," of the weakness. "
"2399500","2401500"," Into end of Maine into early June."
"2401500","2402840"," I like the idea of selling the market."
"2404360","2410880"," But then yesterday, Chase and I were talking about IWM and I was like, man, I was trying to look"
"2410880","2411100"," back. "
"2411280","2411800"," I was going to chase."
"2411940","2413620"," I want to show you that the right now at this moment."
"2415460","2416300"," My one issue. "
"2416520","2418320"," I'm going to show you my one issue with IWM here."
"2426600","2429180"," This is like the so like for that bearish thesis."
"2429520","2430480"," I'm like, I'll entertain this. "
"2430560","2432620"," We'll we'll talk about it tomorrow on stream."
"2441020","2443360"," Now I'm like, oh, let's take a look right now."
"2452570","2454890"," This is the one flying the late that I have. "
"2456350","2458770"," With the market at all, right?"
"2469910","2473410"," And I want to talk to Chase about this yesterday specifically."
"2474730","2490780"," I could"
"2490780","2494080"," roughly say that this is the 2008 crash."
"2494660","2496040"," This is this gray line down here. "
"2506380","2510180"," You can see back here in 2016, we came down, tapped the purple."
"2510180","2513280"," Same thing back here in 2019."
"2514120","2518320"," And this is the 2021 crash came back down here and tagged the white line, right?"
"2521100","2526580"," So you can kind of pause it like the you can kind of pause it here in IWM, the rut"
"2526580","2532960"," small caps and kind of look back and look for some targets down below, right?"
"2534180","2537700"," And the depth of destruction that takes place. "
"2541820","2543560"," And kind of where we're sitting right now."
"2545920","2548100"," And you know, you're looking at right now."
"2550680","2554220"," You know, this is the rut back in 2019 hitting a low. "
"2554660","2559120"," This is the 2020 crash down here in the white line."
"2559120","2561780"," And we're sitting on that purple line right now."
"2563780","2566100"," I'm not anti us going down there. "
"2566340","2568000"," Like this is the positive, right?"
"2568000","2571540"," That we're going to blast through this purple in tag."
"2574360","2576760"," 134 140 somewhere in here."
"2578000","2581360"," The one thing that the one fly in the layman that I have here. "
"2582120","2584700"," Is the depth of the window of weakness."
"2587260","2590580"," So the rut here, this is 1 1400."
"2593040","2599000"," China's offshore you on full zero spot, 5% to 6.9937 versus the dollar. "
"2600780","2606000"," And I'm like, yeah, do we have blood in our T Y where it tags down here at 1640."
"2608320","2608800"," 1680."
"2611920","2618400"," 168 something like that, but do we actually get that 3600 on the spy and we get down here?"
"2618580","2619900"," Is this the bottom of the market?"
"2621340","2624160"," You're talking about, you know, it's not price wise. "
"2624440","2627020"," It's not the bottom or excuse me, price wise."
"2627140","2628420"," It's not the same as the."
"2630880","2635960"," As the covid low, but it is the same covid low on the triggers. "
"2639060","2644920"," So, and that's my point here is that does I W M crash down to that next level at 1400."
"2646580","2648020"," 1407 something like that."
"2648180","2649660"," Is that the actual bottom of the market?"
"2650200","2652160"," Does that take spy down to 3600?"
"2652520","2654300"," Is 3600 trigger 3200?"
"2655820","2658100"," And is now the right time to do it. "
"2658100","2661100"," Is the claim out there that that's where we are?"
"2662560","2666340"," Or does the rut only go to 166 for?"
"2666840","2671660"," I don't want those rut sellers don't want to see this happen."
"2671680","2673320"," I just don't know is it right now."
"2674040","2675960"," Is it right now or is it later?"
"2678400","2680860"," And we're coming out of bearishness down below here. "
"2681500","2686800"," Weekly is bearish and monthly is just coming into extreme bearishness."
"2687860","2694240"," We almost have this this bloodletting on the I believe this is we have monthly this quarterly right"
"2694240","2694700"," down here."
"2699080","2702860"," And the gray would be a yearly believe it or not. "
"2702920","2703520"," I think that's a yearly."
"2708300","2709040"," On the right."
"2709200","2710460"," So is this the crash right?"
"2710580","2712560"," Is this the crash for the stock market?"
"2714800","2716080"," Is it happening now?"
"2718960","2720500"," Or is the blood temporary?"
"2720800","2723140"," Is the blood where we go down like does it get out of one six?"
"2723440","2727380"," It's one six six nine point three on our T Y."
"2732580","2737500"," Is like the depths of that trade for down for rut one six six nine?"
"2737500","2743340"," Or does it blast down to 14.06 14.06 would be a major low. "
"2743560","2745540"," That's that is not enough."
"2745700","2747060"," The banks toward off risks."
"2749140","2752300"," Now that's by now trained down to S one. "
"2754260","2755600"," Wasn't paying attention to spy."
"2757460","2759600"," At four eleven oh seven right now."
"2762560","2765660"," I didn't actually put the lines in for other pivots either. "
"2768300","2770640"," Get the pivot in for get the pivot in for down here."
"2780810","2783090"," You can see the bear flag right up in here."
"2784430","2785950"," Or bear cross up here. "
"2806310","2809090"," That's P X coming down and touching."
"2809730","2813530"," It's twenty seven EMA on the daily."
"2862530","2865510"," VIX trading above its daily for the first time. "
"2868630","2869870"," Since yesterday."
"2870830","2877110"," VIX is such that it's daily trigger one two three four."
"2878410","2881290"," Times going back to Wednesday May 10th right now. "
"2896580","2901560"," VIX now breaking above its daily trigger trading eighteen dollars in one penny."
"2905740","2907900"," Spy sitting on a shelf right now."
"2926660","2929720"," See if I can show that supply down below there. "
"2930540","2932000"," That demand excuse me."
"2957510","2960910"," For site finance like down baby down maybe let's fucking go."
"2961370","2965330"," It says up thirty six point three six percent today. "
"2983630","2985010"," They've been trying for it."
"2985010","2986850"," If you look at the volatility here I'll show you this."
"2996120","2997480"," Here's the VIX right here. "
"3012450","3015090"," Each of our relentless trying right break above."
"3016450","3018730"," Break above again break above again."
"3019650","3024310"," Again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. "
"3024810","3026710"," Trying it once more here."
"3027330","3029390"," Last time they sold off their weekly."
"3031210","3032850"," Even when they broke above. "
"3034190","3039070"," VIX trying to get to at least twenty dollars and eight cents."
"3040090","3042470"," Bears want to see much higher than that."
"3042810","3043290"," Here's monthly. "
"3045610","3048470"," Above here twenty two eighty four."
"3049170","3054450"," Last time we got a VIX spike was on March 13th on a Monday."
"3054730","3059390"," We got all the way up to thirty seventy four and proceeded to sell off. "
"3068660","3071840"," And that weekly provided the support back here."
"3074360","3078020"," And also see here where this max bearishness."
"3078020","3083260"," We got a reading on the daily velocity of thirty three twenty three on the upside. "
"3085320","3088040"," Apparently VIX is at neutral zero right now."
"3089340","3091720"," So we'll keep it on the VIX as this plays out."
"3092380","3097220"," Another note here would be VIX once VIX was able to hold the weekly that's when we got blast off. "
"3097980","3101680"," So if you're able to if we're able to get price above twenty eighty."
"3102920","3108840"," If it's able to hold the weekly the expectation would be we'd get another blast right through this"
"3108840","3109080"," monthly."
"3109080","3111300"," Monthly not nearly as strong as the weekly. "
"3112300","3114520"," Support of and as a support and rejection."
"3155660","3160300"," So what is trays mustache and Joe Rogan just said all of his elite friends said the market is about"
"3160300","3160640"," to crash."
"3161620","3164640"," And not just and not just go into a recession. "
"3165620","3167860"," Did he say that on his show yesterday."
"3168780","3176820"," You also read yesterday the Elan has been subpoenaed in the JP Morgan Epstein case."
"3177020","3182220"," Yeah, like I've kind of resigned myself on Elon Elon at this point. "
"3182800","3189320"," So there was two news pieces yesterday that Elon was subpoenaed for the Epstein case."
"3189320","3194440"," Fear and greed index fifty eight out of one hundred equaling greed and the crypto fear and greed"
"3194440","3197240"," index fifty four out of one hundred equaling neutral."
"3197620","3203280"," I'm not really putting so like yesterday there was the Epstein thing like JP Morgan got subpoenaed"
"3203280","3203760"," as well. "
"3204360","3207200"," You can subpoena anybody right to testify."
"3207900","3215680"," But you've got like the Elon Epstein Island or Epstein Island and then the tweet that he made"
"3215680","3218040"," yesterday was kind of sketchy."
"3218040","3221020"," I'm not going to say why but it was kind of sketchy. "
"3221800","3225840"," And then the quote the other day about Turkey and all that stuff."
"3227240","3231040"," Freedom freedom of speech absolutist all that kind of stuff and I was like you know what."
"3231880","3235540"," I was like Elon can be elon can be quoted. "
"3237640","3243720"," At this point no matter what Elon says it's going to be turned against him right in public forums."
"3243720","3247580"," My preference is that he stops speaking."
"3247940","3253120"," I love the old Elon where Ali talked about was SpaceX Tesla that kind of stuff. "
"3254980","3259580"," And you know it's like I think I'm going to post on Twitter saying someone get his mattress over to"
"3259580","3260160"," Tesla HQ."
"3261040","3265300"," Like the less that he comments on the seems like the better off he is."
"3265780","3272060"," But then yesterday after seeing that stuff yesterday I was like you know it's always going to be"
"3272060","3272240"," there. "
"3272240","3277640"," It's always going to be he said this he said that he believes this he believes that that kind of"
"3277640","3277880"," stuff."
"3279040","3288660"," Having a squeeze right now on this by indicative of trading below the"
"3288660","3289240"," pivot."
"3292760","3293580"," Negative gamma. "
"3308980","3314060"," Yeah they got Jamie Diamond in the Epstein Island thing that shit's disgusting."
"3314680","3316320"," We all know that shit's disgusting."
"3322080","3325320"," But the Elon stuff I'm just like I'm so past it all. "
"3325520","3330020"," I think I went through like the five whatever it's like five six phases of death."
"3330640","3334640"," Like at the end stage where I'm just like I don't want to read about it anymore."
"3335300","3340580"," Like I'm at this point with Twitter to where I'm like I'm just going to start banning anything that"
"3340580","3341220"," mentions Elon. "
"3341820","3344520"," Good or bad I don't really care I don't want to hear it anymore."
"3347100","3350840"," I don't I don't care if it's good I don't care if it's bad I just want to listen to"

"3381660","3383100"," I'm not I'm not disagreeing with that."
"3400520","3404620"," Yeah I think that's what I got to do is just add Elon to muted words I think I'm at"
"3404620","3405480"," that point with it."
"3406560","3410700"," And I don't care if it's positive or negative I really don't I'm just like I don't I don't fucking"

"3751380","3751940"," Yeah."
"3752360","3755280"," It's weird. "
"3755740","3764380"," So during COVID we got to vote from home and then this past election I went to the polls and"
"3764380","3765560"," I didn't see too many people there."
"3767120","3774680"," It was also fascinating thing that bugs me the most is I get the election results from where I"
"3774680","3774980"," live."
"3777020","3781500"," And it's shocking to me how many young people don't vote here. "

"3798420","3803840"," I don't see a lot of middle-aged people younger middle-aged younger people at the polls."
"3804360","3810620"," I've been told that's because they they vote by mail but then when the numbers come out for"
"3810620","3814940"," eligible voters I don't see that younger vote getting out there and voting."

"3837170","3842850"," I watch those mostly because I want to break out the popcorn and just laugh at them. "
"3843030","3845710"," I was thinking about it this week I was thinking about the like the Senate."
"3846290","3851550"," Like you never see anyone asking the Senate about their trading and voting, right?"
"3852690","3857870"," Or why are they trading the stock market while they're making decisions that can impact the stock"
"3857870","3858150"," market?"

"3951720","3954260"," Well, how do what what does that turn into though, I guess?"
"3954600","3958620"," Does that turn into vote or can't can't run anymore?"
"3958840","3962340"," Maybe possibly because you have to be rich to run for president or."
"3962920","3964160"," I was fascinated. "
"3964700","3970760"," I read a story recently about the Democratic Party and the Republican Party and how they nominate"
"3970760","3971480"," their candidates."
"3972000","3975420"," 750 million pounds of zero spot one to."
"3976160","3977500"," That was fascinating. "
"3978500","3984420"," The different approaches that Democrats and Republicans take to nominating their their candidates."
"3986260","3988520"," Neither was neither was picked."
"3989500","3995080"," So when I looked at both, I was like, I was like this both parties, how they know they're not"
"3995080","3995300"," there. "
"3995400","4000620"," Well, it's not just nomination, but how they get candidates and then run those candidates."
"4001080","4002960"," I found fascinating."
"4004040","4005280"," I didn't know it was that. "
"4005280","4010540"," I don't know if I find a better word, but that fucked up."
"4019180","4020060"," Yeah, is that real?"
"4020300","4023280"," Lord, Penta, like the vast majority blood penta have heard that statement."
"4024900","4028320"," The vast majority of younger voters have met believe it's completely rigged. "
"4028320","4029140"," So why bother?"
"4029440","4032580"," Is that a real statement or is that just something that's been parroted out there?"
"4035640","4040220"," I thought if that was true, I always wondered if we did the mail in ballots."
"4040220","4041180"," If that would change."
"4043460","4047940"," Or is it just I'm going to go on the Internet and the social media and bitch all day long,"
"4047960","4048780"," but not do anything?"
"4049660","4050140"," I don't know. "
"4050460","4052120"," I don't know what that means."
"4057330","4058990"," Yeah, because young people know it's all fake."
"4059310","4059630"," I got you. "
"4063330","4066930"," Someone else saying they don't, Suga saying they don't understand and appreciate what it took."
"4067650","4068590"," And they have the right to vote."
"4073570","4077070"," Never by spyplex saying never been a better time for a third party candidate in my opinion. "
"4077850","4079070"," More nugs and how are you?"
"4080990","4082270"," No, so I've still got."
"4082750","4085350"," I had some zero dates from overnight that I held in here."
"4085610","4086610"," I'm still sitting on those. "
"4086950","4088510"," I haven't traded any of this just yet."
"4088590","4090530"," I'm waiting for this to calm down here."
"4094940","4095979"," Just repeat there. "
"4096260","4099460"," Feds barking says demand is cooling, but not yet cold."
"4101200","4104040"," Yeah, I've seen the ranked choice voting model."
"4104040","4105319"," I read about that too. "
"4105680","4106460"," I'm aware of that."
"4114170","4115630"," Government gives the illusion of choice."
"4115970","4117550"," It's the left and right wing of the same bird. "
"4117770","4119010"," Yeah, that's my one problem."
"4119410","4124790"," If I had one problem with our political system here, it's the power and greed, man."
"4124930","4125750"," It's out of control. "
"4126370","4127370"," Like on both sides."
"4130010","4132830"," Especially the stock market thing is my fly man."
"4132830","4136170"," That's like that's my implied in the statement from last meeting. "
"4136609","4138090"," Some people are like they should be able."
"4138170","4141250"," I saw some people on Twitter arguing that they should be able to trade the stock market."
"4142069","4145689"," And I was like, man, I was like, I'm not down with this at all. "
"4145689","4146729"," Like I'm not down with it."
"4147689","4151990"," And you're also not down with either is my father was a lobbyist."
"4154729","4160410"," And the number of politicians that that move into lobbying is disgusting as well. "
"4160410","4163109"," I mean, I agree with some lobbying."
"4164090","4165170"," You need lobbying."
"4166149","4167529"," To get a cause. "
"4169229","4170170"," Heard, right?"
"4170390","4171470"," So I'm for lobbying."
"4171670","4172609"," I'm not anti lobbying."
"4174210","4180189"," But then there's this whole like power and money part of lobbying that's really disgusting. "
"4180370","4183810"," It's in that same vein as trade stocks and options and stuff."
"4184649","4185710"," It's not just them."
"4185850","4187010"," It's their family members, right?"
"4188970","4193229"," It's like a it's like, yeah, I make $300,000 a year as a senator. "
"4193570","4194570"," I think it's 300,000."
"4194650","4195030"," It could be 160."
"4195470","4195830"," I can't remember. "
"4196270","4200670"," I haven't kept up, but then I need to go out there and make millions as a senator as well."
"4200910","4201770"," That's the part that I'm like."
"4202450","4204730"," It's like a it's just like a grift. "
"4213220","4214880"," Yeah, there are no good guys are there?"
"4216480","4216840"," Yeah."
"4218860","4221360"," So do you all do you all vote in our stream?"
"4221500","4222380"," Do any of you not vote?"
"4224560","4226620"," I don't care what your political meetings are."
"4227040","4228180"," Just do you vote?"
"4228400","4229720"," Do you participate in voting or not?"
"4230280","4231760"," No, I'm not that. "
"4231960","4233860"," If you do vote, I don't really care if you don't vote."
"4235000","4236480"," What are your reasons for not voting?"
"4238200","4242660"," You know, to as be honest, like if the real reason that you don't vote is because."
"4243560","4244040"," I don't know. "
"4244320","4247120"," It's not your you don't find a candidate that you're interested in or."
"4248200","4252560"," The primaries you don't find a candidate interested in is it because you're just lazy."
"4253480","4255460"," Is it because you're disenfranchised?"
"4255940","4258580"," Is it because you've been arrested for a felony?"
"4260500","4263740"," Maybe you don't want to say that in stream, but is there like a reason?"
"4265180","4267160"," Is it just because you're like, I forget about it. "
"4267720","4269220"," I wonder if it's part of that."
"4269820","4275260"," If part of it's like, I got a job, I can't do it or no one's got my fancy in"
"4275260","4275700"," the primaries."
"4283380","4285360"," You know, we need business and money taken out of politics. "
"4285360","4288220"," People aren't the priority like they were like, they pretend to be."
"4289260","4290420"," It's rigged by bother."
"4291860","4293060"," You vote because you're a policy. "
"4294160","4298720"," In Australia, it's compulsory to vote."
"4299160","4300100"," If you don't vote, you get fined."
"4301000","4303340"," There's a couple other countries like that too, right?"
"4307000","4308100"," How about this?"
"4308880","4309940"," It's okay to say this. "
"4310200","4313920"," It is not an unknown vulnerability, but it is one I am focused on."
"4313920","4316260"," So we've got two teeing off right here, right?"
"4316560","4317540"," One tee off down below."
"4318760","4321100"," Coming around for number two right now. "
"4321700","4324340"," Cell side on charge right now."
"4324800","4326820"," Not giving anything up right here."
"4329520","4332040"," Hedge funds, trade in the market today. "
"4334280","4337260"," Feds Balkan says, I'm hearing concerns over downtown."
"4340220","4341500"," Sorry, just repeat that."
"4341500","4345720"," Feds Balkan says, I'm hearing concerns over downtown commercial real estate loan exposure. "
"4347420","4349140"," Commercial real estate loan exposure."
"4353280","4354480"," Didn't see that coming."
"4360280","4363760"," Feds Balkan dropped the magic words we've been talking about. "
"4369900","4373880"," So Feds Balkan is saying, demand is cooling, but not yet cold."
"4374440","4379240"," Feds Balkan says, I expect my unemployment rate forecast to come down a bit."
"4381800","4385080"," Feds Balkan saying, I'm still looking to be convinced on inflation. "
"4385840","4388860"," I like the optionality implied in the statement from the last meeting."
"4389480","4394000"," So the job market is still quite hot and not softened as expected."
"4395640","4397740"," So we were talking about this too this morning. "
"4397960","4404280"," So Feds Balkan is saying, so this is a key thing that we were talking about here in the show,"
"4404460","4404520"," right?"
"4407560","4412440"," Quote, I like the optionality of downtown over the coming quarters."
"4413880","4418400"," Feds Balkan saying, I like the optionality implied in the statement from the last meeting."
"4418860","4420020"," Now that's IE. "
"4420680","4422980"," This is not a pause, but maybe it's a pause."
"4425740","4430820"," But Feds Balkan also saying the commercial office sector is where you hear the most concern on CRE."
"4435100","4440400"," Also commercial real estate is not an unknown vulnerability, but it is one I am focused on. "
"4441220","4443680"," So it's not an issue, it's a feature."
"4447580","4452620"," He's also saying, or Fakan's also saying, expect my unemployment rate forecast to come down a bit."
"4453200","4459680"," It was not a good yesterday, I believe, in business insiders saying that we will always, for the"
"4459680","4465600"," next decade or two, unless we start making some babies have a very low unemployment rate, that your"
"4465600","4473300"," rate of pay should go up and demand for, demand for workers should always be there. "
"4473300","4483240"," You should also expect quicker promotions because of boomers retiring out in a very large"
"4483240","4484020"," scale."
"4489170","4493640"," Barkan saying, most of the people I talked to anticipated downturn over the coming quarters."
"4494060","4499460"," Feds Balkan says businesses will not give up pricing powers unless they're forced to do so. "
"4517800","4521300"," Vicks consolidating on the daily trigger here, trying to get above right now."
"4523380","4529960"," And daily is not quite screaming up at this point, excuse me, the hourly trigger, but Vicks trying"
"4529960","4533440"," to break above that daily and start creating a bloodbath type scenario here."
"4534900","4536600"," It's attempting to go higher right now. "
"4537100","4538440"," I might take a position here in just a moment."
"4558180","4560320"," I keep my eye on this vault and this Vicks."
"4573500","4577780"," 410.05, so the daily is moved up now, it's up here. "
"4580280","4581820"," Do we haven't gone anywhere?"
"4583580","4584720"," We haven't gone anywhere."
"4587620","4589860"," I'm going to explain to you where we've gone so far."
"4591820","4595700"," 410.05 is now the daily trigger and it keeps moving up. "
"4598400","4600160"," I'm going to show you the spy here."
"4601240","4603380"," Nothing has changed in the market."
"4604920","4609880"," Feds Balkan says the message in the last FOMC statement was one of optionality. "
"4614380","4615900"," Here's the daily trend."
"4616440","4619840"," It is continuing to go up and not down."
"4620160","4629880"," Despite what you've been told, you can say, daily trend"
"4629880","4630500"," is up. "
"4632300","4635980"," The stream continues to be up right now and not down."
"4636160","4641140"," You can actually hear water flame futures, forex and stock instruments get a free trial."
"4641380","4647200"," Even with the extreme bearishness we have right now, what bears would really like to do is break"
"4647200","4649500"," below this 410.03 right here. "
"4650840","4662170"," And trade down to 403.31. That"
"4662170","4668390"," 403.31 is way down here."
"4675530","4677890"," This is the weekly trigger down here."
"4678270","4680650"," It's a pretty big move down right there, right?"
"4680890","4681570"," Let me show it to you. "
"4683850","4686210"," This is the leg they're trying to get here."
"4687270","4688190"," Tag down here."
"4689350","4698470"," Get underneath and start to slam below S3s at 407.83. Now this is the ultimate target down below"
"4698470","4699750"," 403 and change. "
"4732870","4735570"," Bearish hourly right now on the spy."
"4737290","4741190"," VIX now trading above its daily trigger at 1788."
"4742370","4746070"," A key point for you right now is to keep focused on a number here. "
"4746250","4752250"," Keep focused on $17.87 on the VIX."
"4752950","4754190"," That's a key number."
"4754570","4761990"," If VIX can get above that number, $17.87 at any point today and hold it and begin to make"
"4761990","4764810"," its way higher, you will see a bloodbath. "
"4765090","4768370"," If price stays below that, 1787, that should be bottom."
"4770850","4773650"," And the hourly is starting to roll over, making a nice squeeze here."
"4775410","4815720"," The Fed's"
"4815720","4821020"," bar says the agency is considering stricter rules on accounting for unrealized losses for banks"
"4821020","4823000"," over $100 billion in assets. "
"4825720","4827480"," So that was the first thing we were going to talk about."
"4827620","4828660"," We were going to talk about a couple other things."
"4828860","4832960"," We talked about the unclinching into OPACS. "
"4833880","4835340"," We know that the expiration is tomorrow."
"4836160","4845360"," We know that the market heading into these OPACSs can have a tendency to either rip faces off or"
"4845360","4848560"," begin to big roll over down into the following month."
"4849360","4853760"," The second thing we want to talk about is if there's, I'm not going to say his last name, but"
"4853760","4859200"," if Grant is out there, Grant was asking me via DM. "
"4861140","4867440"," He said he's been trading spy with us and he wants to branch out and learn other things."
"4867980","4872360"," Grant, if you're in the program this morning, I suggest that you go into the Discord."
"4873600","4876180"," And ask around about trading other products. "
"4876560","4881240"," If you haven't traded futures, if you traded spy, I would recommend that you learn how to trade SPX"
"4881240","4882200"," and then ES."
"4883200","4886200"," Then it would branch off into the other two major indexes."
"4886920","4890200"," So that would be the Qs or NQ or NDX. "
"4890780","4892800"," And then you learn how to trade IWM."
"4893780","4897020"," And then when you're done with those three indexes, you move into individual tickers."
"4898440","4900680"," But if you get into the Discord, they'll explain that to you. "
"4900680","4907000"," Some of the natural progressions in trading stocks that I like are typically stocks like AMD."
"4907960","4910720"," I like, believe it or not, like Disney and Apple and they're like Tesla."
"4911960","4916740"," Yeah, Disney Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, Google, it doesn't matter, they'll trade kind of slow. "
"4919400","4923420"," So Grant, if you're in the stream right now and you're listening, I would say, first I would say,"
"4923480","4926760"," get into the Discord and raise your hand and say, I'm a new trader."
"4927260","4928420"," I've been trading the spy."
"4928700","4929380"," I want to branch out. "
"4929380","4931520"," Can anybody take my hand for me?"
"4933920","4938480"," The next thing we're going to discuss this morning are stock picks."
"4938800","4940700"," We're going to look at some of the stock picks that we've had."
"4941760","4944480"," And we're going to add some to the list today. "
"4944960","4945720"," I think we are."
"4957720","4960740"," I had some this morning, so we'll find out if we're going to add some."
"4982990","4986470"," We have Duolingo on the chart, right?"
"4986670","4987410"," They're doing kind of nice. "
"4987610","4991550"," They're down 1.38%, but they've just been ripping faces off."
"4997040","5002320"," We also have Nari on the N-A-R-I on the list."
"5002700","5004000"," They're still ripping faces off. "
"5007060","5008660"," DoorDash is our list as well."
"5009400","5013360"," They're bleeding off today, but they are coming back down to a buy point."
"5015600","5016340"," A lot here. "
"5020030","5021630"," We got a lot of techs this morning."
"5042230","5044190"," What am I looking for here?"
"5070470","5072670"," Okay, so those are the three tickers we've got."
"5072750","5075550"," We've got D-U-O-L, that's Duolingo. "
"5076450","5080250"," We have Nari, N-A-R-I, and then we have Dash."
"5081610","5084890"," Dash is actually starting to come back down into a buy area."
"5109460","5110400"," Hang tight for a second. "
"5127700","5130100"," We also have Toast, T-O-S-T."
"5130300","5131320"," We've had those in, by the way."
"5135000","5135940"," T-O-S-T. "
"5198520","5200380"," O-S-C-R is another one?"
"5200500","5201280"," O-S-C-R?"
"5201960","5202660"," O-S-C-R?"
"5206440","5207240"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"5207380","5209380"," O-S-C-R just keeps cranking too, doesn't it?"
"5220060","5221980"," Did I tell you what, Pinky?"
"5223720","5225480"," These are some gangster."
"5242840","5244200"," I-O-N-Q?"
"5251670","5253310"," Dude, I-O-N-Q, cranking. "
"5254210","5255550"," Cranking, cranking, baby."
"5256070","5259050"," Pinky, those are some, dude, these pics are all gorgeous, man."
"5269590","5270530"," All movers. "
"5272970","5274330"," Okay, so that's on there now."
"5278360","5280320"," Yeah, dude, Pinky, that..."
"5282220","5283020"," Hold on, brother."
"5284640","5286200"," And then F-I-P, right?"
"5286420","5287620"," F-I-P is the last one. "
"5292410","5294410"," You'll get F-I-P just cranking right along."
"5294930","5295250"," Whoo-hoo!"
"5295530","5295730"," Okay."
"5302330","5307610"," JP Morgan, CEO, Diamond says it's unlikely that we will acquire any other struggling bank. "
"5309310","5313150"," So I'll go through what's on the list right now, and then I'm gonna add a bunch to the list"
"5313150","5313530"," today."
"5315310","5323250"," This dream is sponsored, so for the first ticker, it's going to be D-U-O-L, Duolingo, second"
"5323250","5323600"," ticker."
"5325370","5336310"," Inari Medical, I-N-A-R-I, next ticker, DoorDash, next ticker, Toast, T "
"5336310","5346550","-O-S-T, uh, next ticker, Oscar Health, O-S-C-R, next"
"5346550","5356650"," ticker, Ion-Q, it's I-O-N-Q, next ticker, F-I-P, that's"
"5356650","5357930"," F-T-A-I infrastructure. "
"5359590","5366660"," We also have PCOR, and I'm gonna make sure I put all these on the list."
"5380520","5382040"," It's on the YouTube watch list again."
"5383760","5385280"," We got a bunch of tickers on there. "
"5393220","5396980"," Uh, yeah, Wiki's saying careful with Fip, they'll send you a lot of tax forms."

"5525520","5526300"," financial advice."
"5527120","5532500"," These are tickers of interest that we put onto an ETF, uh, over here to make to see how they"
"5532500","5534940"," perform over one to three years. "

"5626920","5628240"," Bam, bam. "
"5629300","5630880"," Love to see that continuation."
"5633260","5639600"," And this gap down here, I'd really like to buy that gap fill on some on a weak market possibly."
"5639860","5643120"," I'm interested in this 16 down here, 1674. "
"5645420","5648440"," Set alert down here at 16, 1657."
"5649120","5653120"," This is the one that you want to set the alert on 1661 and SHSH."

"5741680","5743960"," Yeah, I'm interested in this one down below two."
"5745860","5752740"," Bear in mind that the treasury is keeping the size of CFLT."
"5753840","5755560"," Change that $35 billion. "
"5773900","5790340"," Now SMRT, this one's a little high right now, but I'd be"
"5790340","5792760"," interested on the downside if it comes back down."
"5794040","5803840"," I'm actually interested to sell this right here, but if it comes back down here."
"5804860","5806520"," It's very bullish right now. "
"5806540","5809980"," You can see the cross on the daily on SMRT."
"5811000","5812540"," This big cross in here."
"5821140","5822720"," There's the gap to fill above. "
"5825260","5825900"," SMRT."

"6040460","6042080"," I'm going to take a phone card really quick. "
"6042100","6042700"," Give me two seconds."
"6047900","6049460"," All right, so that's on the list now."
"6050100","6052900"," We got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. "
"6053180","6055940"," Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve."
"6056800","6057960"," Twelve tickers on the list."
"6058140","6058580"," I've got like. "
"6058580","6062140"," Only CEOs both wrote to Biden on default dangers."
"6062700","6066720"," I've got like another six tickers to give you, but I have to chart them out."
"6067040","6067580"," I don't know. "
"6067820","6071380"," I don't think that they're good for the list, but I'm going to look at them off screen in the"
"6071380","6072080"," next few minutes."
"6075020","6077240"," There's some of you out there thinking we're going to get a squeeze here."
"6078360","6080220"," Because of the consolidation in the middle here. "
"6100000","6102060"," We look on the 30 minute on VIX."
"6103040","6103980"," See what it's saying."
"6111730","6113050"," Yeah, we can get a squeeze here. "
"6119840","6122080"," Yeah, it could be a short-lived."
"6122280","6126320"," You've got 253,411 peas out there at 60 cents."
"6153060","6155280"," The hourly on VIX is bearish. "
"6159700","6162380"," I would expect we don't go up too high."
"6162580","6164260"," Four, twelve, maybe twenty-two, somewhere in here."
"6170540","6171880"," Among some calls in here. "
"6190620","6192620"," Give me one second to get me a quick phone call."
"6214660","6220620"," We have a, we have a bull cross on the one minute here forming."
"6220780","6222140"," I'm going to switch it back over to the five minute. "
"6253090","6254310"," FDIC is Gruenberg."
"6254570","6259750"," Says interest rate risk management is probably job one for bank supervisors right now."

"6339030","6343930"," So right now I'm just watching the VIX right now."
"6344050","6346730"," The VIX hourly is rolling over to the downside. "
"6349550","6351630"," So we're going to give the bulls a chance here."
"6351770","6352310"," It's 1110."
"6352490","6356370"," They basically have until 1130 bulls have to 1130s show if they can squeeze higher. "
"6356990","6360370"," There's not a ton of puts right now."
"6360410","6363950"," You've got 254,000 puts at 60 cents."
"6363950","6368990"," So whatever this is here to the upside, I'm not going to give it a ton of like, yeah, hey,"
"6369110","6370790"," let's go to the moon, any of that kind of stuff here. "
"6372330","6376190"," So just in the background right here, if they can't do it by 1130, I'm going to pull those off"
"6376190","6379650"," and we'll get ready to start selling once again."
"6379950","6383630"," And we're going to probably go back and retest that for 1213."
"6428070","6429390"," Right back for a few minutes. "
"6429390","6453180"," So are"
"6453180","6455260"," you saying Rogan is calling for a crush?"
"6456620","6459020"," Does anybody have a link to where Rogan said that?"
"6459440","6462680"," That the crush thing or the market rolling over?"
"6470920","6472120"," I'm making money right now."
"6472200","6474360"," I'm in a 413 C's right now."
"6475360","6476340"," Doing just fine. "
"6509910","6512250"," The VIX trying to hold its hourly right now."
"6543260","6545600"," VIX trading up into a bear flag."
"6548520","6551320"," Or a bear cross above at 1764. "
"6574130","6575790"," So you didn't want to trigger the bad words."
"6575850","6577870"," Do you have a link to the Joe Rogan when he said that?"
"6580610","6581330"," Yeah, we got it."
"6581550","6591710"," So the stocks we're going to do is this is Winky and I and Binky are working on Winky,"
"6592010","6595130"," Binky and I are working on a stock show and I believe Saturdays. "
"6595130","6599970"," Maybe Binky can chime in and say, Binky, do you have an idea of when you want to do that"
"6599970","6600190"," show?"
"6603310","6605190"," Do we get Binky to chime in here?"
"6605270","6606970"," I think he was up trading all night long too."
"6607910","6609270"," He might be sleeping right now."
"6610870","6614170"," So we think we're going to get Binky to do a stock show on Saturdays. "
"6614650","6617790"," Throughout the week, you see Winky and I talking about tickers."
"6618510","6621870"," We're going to call it or not call it."
"6626030","6627610"," We're going to call it or not call it either. "
"6627730","6629990"," Add them to a YouTube stock list."
"6632090","6636250"," You're going to get access to that stock list."
"6638910","6641350"," Some of you have signed up via email, right?"
"6641490","6645130"," You'll get access to that actual stock list on trading view. "
"6646570","6649530"," And we'll maintain that list and that ETF of six."
"6649530","6656290"," So basically what you're getting is, we should have a rotation of somewhere between 100 and 1000"
"6656290","6657210"," stocks."
"6658810","6660910"," We'll add and take away over time. "
"6661910","6664570"," They'll be sorted by sell or buy."
"6665190","6667970"," So you're going to have stocks to buy and stocks to sell, right?"
"6670450","6672090"," And each stock will have an alert."
"6673510","6676890"," So if we come to the top of the key, it starts to sell. "
"6676890","6682810"," If it's something that's being accumulated of interest to buy, we can at least go back and say,"
"6683250","6687130"," hey, stock ticker XYZ looks like it's down at a buy point."
"6688190","6689910"," This is a stock that's being accumulated."
"6690270","6698350"," Hey, stock ticker YXZ has a top of the key he's been selling for the past three months. "
"6699150","6701910"," It's right where its sell point is once again to sell."
"6701910","6711770"," So as Binky does these videos on Saturday and Binky and I give you this list over time."
"6711890","6713270"," And Binky helps create this list. "
"6714070","6719310"," It'll be maintained and updated for you to receive alerts as well."
"6719590","6728730"," So we'll publish this list on trading view and we'll be able to monitor it over the next year to"
"6728730","6729250"," three years."
"6730790","6733150"," Now we've done something like this in the past. "
"6736660","6737940"," I'm excited here."
"6754170","6760590"," We've done something like this in the past where we created an ETF with Quinn and with Joe."
"6761550","6766310"," We ran that for I think it's still running right now, but we ran it for I think two or"
"6766310","6768690"," three years somewhere in there. "
"6768690","6776430"," And I think we have a 90% correct if I'm wrong, Joe, if you're out there listening."
"6777850","6785550"," We have a 90% win rate of multiples to 300% winners."
"6786510","6788870"," These are just buying stock and holding. "
"6791850","6796590"," I think we had one loss of the bunch over the past three years."
"6798690","6807210"," So we're going to try to launch this publicly at this but not publicly but more publicly so it's"
"6807210","6808810"," more tangible for you out there."
"6808990","6816470"," I used to post them on Twitter and I didn't leave many comments because it was mostly amongst the"
"6816470","6817330"," small group of traders. "
"6818910","6821570"," So I'd post them and nobody understood the context of them."
"6822150","6826770"," Some people did and some people didn't, but there was a core group of us that traded them."
"6826770","6836470"," And so we're going to make this list public to you with updates and you'll be able to check in"
"6836470","6836990"," on a Saturday. "
"6838190","6844510"," On this stock show and we'll give updates on all these tickers what we're dropping what we're"
"6844510","6844870"," adding."
"6847850","6851770"," And manage that ETF over from year"
"6854170","6860650"," to year."
"6860650","6862170"," And access to these tickers. "
"6872150","6872910"," Training view."
"6873890","6877990"," So you'll be able to log in, you'll get access to it, you can see where all the bid supports"
"6877990","6878530"," are."
"6879090","6879870"," You can get the alerts. "
"6880130","6882470"," I believe you can get the alerts sent to you via email."
"6883230","6886790"," So if there's like an email and let's say you're bored of the market one day of the week, right?"
"6886930","6888170"," You're like, ah, this market sucks."
"6888390","6888810"," It's boring. "
"6890770","6894130"," If you come into a summertime where we're trading sideways, right?"
"6894490","6895010"," Something like that."
"6896570","6899670"," And you're looking for something to do to short or too long."
"6900870","6906110"," You'll get an alert via email that says, hey, these three tickers right now are down at their buy"
"6906110","6906470"," points. "
"6907450","6910810"," Now there is a white paper on these tickers on the buy cell."
"6911790","6916690"," Normally when you come into these buyer cell points, you want to be checking as to why you're"
"6916690","6917570"," buying or selling."
"6918070","6920870"," You don't want to be like, we're selling this ticker. "
"6920870","6924330"," If this ticker is at 350, then we want to sell it down to $10."
"6926290","6929450"," We were trying to sell the points of selling off."
"6929570","6931370"," You want to make sure that like they didn't get news. "
"6932150","6937890"," Hey, they have an M&A merger and acquisition coming up or some kind of like, yeah, we don't want"
"6937890","6938410"," to sell this."
"6938730","6939710"," We're staying on the buy side."
"6940050","6945630"," We don't want to buy this because it ripped to the depths of hell and whatever, you know. "
"6946710","6949170"," Now where stops are on those buys, all that kind of stuff."
"6950190","6952070"," So there's a big white paper that you get about with it."
"6952570","6956790"," You're going to get access to the tickers and we're going to be able to review these tickers every"
"6956790","6957030"," week. "
"6957530","6962750"," And you can also show up on Saturdays and you're going to be able to ask for your own ticker"
"6962750","6964250"," to be charted."
"6964370","6966570"," If you're like, hey, my favorite ticker is not on this list."
"6967110","6968230"," I love catching knives. "
"6969690","6975330"," I bought a Peton at $5,000 and I'm going to diamond hand it to $2."
"6975550","6976430"," Can you chart it for me?"
"6988400","6989440"," Yeah, maybe Joe can."
"6989680","6991080"," I think Joe was in a conference call. "
"6991220","6992380"," He was just trying to call me a minute ago."
"7002450","7006250"," So Binky's chime in and he's saying we'll try both days and see which works better."
"7007470","7011310"," To have viewers and take questions and probably Binky. "
"7011990","7013310"," Well, it's talking to Binky about it."
"7013330","7016810"," And I was like, I was like, if you're busy on a Saturday and you want to do it on"
"7016810","7017650"," a Sunday, that's fine."
"7017650","7021890"," And I was like, if you need, wink your eye to step in on a Saturday or Sunday for you. "
"7021990","7025010"," If you're vacationing or something like that, we'll do that."
"7025210","7028410"," Or if you want us to show up on one day, like here and there with you, we will do"
"7028410","7028850"," that as well."
"7029090","7030330"," So it'll be a team effort. "
"7034090","7037010"," It's boss's community banks are sound and resilient."
"7040010","7042390"," Yeah, Saturdays can be tough in the summer, but you know what?"
"7042830","7044390"," You can always come back and watch it later."
"7046370","7047570"," So it'll be a short program. "
"7047710","7049230"," This is like an hour or two hour show."
"7049790","7053690"," You can pop right back in and be like, okay, you can pop in and watch it whenever you like."
"7053790","7055330"," Three missponsored by to the tick. "
"7055850","7057050"," Get free daily points."
"7057430","7061610"," I know a bunch of you sleep in on Saturday mornings and Sunday mornings."
"7061890","7065010"," I know you guys are like, yeah, I'm doing all this stuff at 10 a.m. Some of you are,"
"7065010","7068370"," but a whole ton of you are like, I slept in, I drank all night long. "
"7069310","7071070"," Chase women around town and stuff like that."
"7073030","7073710"," Loose women."
"7081510","7083550"," Oh, yeah, discord's getting changes still. "
"7083750","7084330"," It's taking time."
"7084530","7085410"," That's all I can say on that."
"7086850","7092050"," I think I had a meeting with we're going to do a blanket on band coming up shortly. "
"7092510","7094010"," I'm now just waiting on devs."
"7094630","7095950"," So we're done with devs."
"7096890","7100130"," Devs will do a blanket on band and you'll have that. "
"7100250","7100590"," You'll have it."
"7100650","7101690"," The opportunity to gain access."
"7101690","7102410"," Like once again. "
"7104470","7105550"," Devs have a lot of work at him."
"7105610","7105990"," It's not easy."
"7106190","7106810"," It's like a ton of work. "
"7110290","7111410"," Women have ill repute."
"7111510","7113310"," I think it's more men of ill repute."
"7122130","7123230"," Hey, son, you take it easy. "
"7126030","7127570"," Right on Sunday never ends."
"7129290","7129930"," Right on."

"7155370","7156090"," What are you guys asking?"
"7158470","7160050"," Well, I'm missing some of the cut. "

"7177080","7178100"," There will be a link though."
"7178360","7179600"," I'll have a link for you this week."
"7179660","7182160"," It's looking carefully at commercial real estate risks. "
"7182820","7183260"," I'm waiting."
"7183260","7188720"," So, like, Winky is working his ass off in the background to get this stuff all out to you."
"7189100","7190220"," It takes time. "
"7192760","7193900"," Yeah, there will be a link."
"7196200","7197840"," There's another you're going to need."
"7198380","7199500"," I thought that was. "
"7199720","7201480"," Yeah, I'm talking about it right now."
"7201840","7205980"," So you'll you'll start to see a program on Saturdays and Sundays in the next two weeks."
"7206660","7210280"," You're going to see a program launch up on Saturdays or Sundays as Binky was saying. "
"7210880","7214780"," The US sells $36 billion in 52 week bills."
"7215320","7220560"," Private cover of two to 97 and a prior high yield of four spot, five, three percent."
"7222420","7225760"," Then you'll get access to that trading view list of stocks. "
"7231380","7233020"," So Joe donut, you're in the stream."
"7233400","7236180"," How did the how did those let's get you on record?"
"7237420","7241780"," When we were running the when we were running those ETFs on the accumulation phase, how did they?"
"7242020","7247840"," I thought I had said to people in stream that we had 90% winners and one loser or something"
"7247840","7248340"," like that."
"7249120","7251960"," And they were high multiple winners, like two, three hundred percent. "
"7252080","7252820"," Am I wrong on that?"
"7253420","7256860"," I don't want to say something that's a full on lie or something."
"7259520","7260800"," You correct my recollection."
"7267360","7268360"," Tonight, take it easy. "
"7269440","7270160"," Have a great day, brother."
"7279150","7281010"," Yeah, I got Vix turning bearish right here."
"7283850","7285370"," On the hourly, not on the day. "
"7285810","7288630"," Vix is bullish on the day and bearish on the hourly."
"7314910","7316710"," Yeah, I think Joe's popping in and out."
"7316810","7317910"," He was on phone calls earlier. "
"7318850","7319750"," He's getting calm back."
"7336300","7339400"," Squeeze and I are now painting."
"7359060","7360040"," I'm going to take a call right now. "
"7360060","7360880"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"7450040","7453400"," Shortly expecting the results of the 52 week bill auction."
"7453400","7455980"," I'll lead with the 52 week bill bid to cover ratio. "
"7479210","7482750"," Okay, so if we, so we're squeezing right now, right?"
"7482950","7485330"," There's a few places you want to be aware of, right?"
"7485690","7486870"," So pivot point to pivot point."
"7487190","7489330"," We've got four, twelve, ten as a target."
"7490130","7492470"," We know the sellers are above at the hourly trigger. "
"7492630","7493450"," They don't want to give that up."
"7493830","7497010"," We failed to close the gap above here at four, twelve, eighty nine."
"7497110","7500330"," We've got the next gap above at four, thirteen, fifty. "
"7502810","7506510"," So you got one, two, three, four targets above."
"7508430","7636160"," Bid to"
"7636160","7641580"," cover ratio, two to forty nine, two to forty nine, high rate, four spots, six, four, five percent,"
"7641900","7643740"," four spots, six, four, five percent."
"7644340","7650480"," The US sells forty one billion dollars in 52 week bills and awards, thirty nine spots, seven, nine"
"7650480","7651980"," percent of bids at high. "
"7658030","7663850"," And then as that is up, zero spot, two percent, the S&P 500 down, zero spot, three percent, and"
"7663850","7666530"," the down, down, zero spot, six percent."

"7831260","7831800"," Hold on one second here."
"7833760","7841880"," We got the tweezer reversal on the spy, sell side saying, no, you're not, you will, shall not pass"
"7841880","7843060"," above right now. "
"7845020","7846360"," Shall not pass."
"7846600","7852720"," You can see the large tweezer reversal on the high here and another tweezer reversal here to the"
"7852720","7853440"," downside."
"7858740","7865140"," Vix catching its breath one more time with a double bottom on the Vix on the hourly trigger. "
"7875740","7877620"," Relatively no movement overall."
"7880000","7881820"," I'm going to yawn fest at this point."
"7881940","7883720"," Hopefully we can get a new low on the day. "
"7884040","7886840"," Previous low at four, ten, seventy one here."
"7892020","7894980"," Yeah, I was on a, I was on a call really quick."
"7895660","7897440"," Maybe I'll, I'll put a thing up. "
"7900720","7901340"," Hold on."
"7901440","7911380"," I'll change the, uh, I need to lead all this and I'll, put something up on my"
"7911380","7912300"," screen or what I'm going to call."
"8030070","8034950"," I had the first tweezer above and the second tweezer just right there. "
"8036570","8039210"," Sell side hard and heavy on the spy right now."
"8056380","8059960"," Cues with the same reversal as they had experienced earlier in the morning."
"8066020","8071500"," Cues retesting their five minute trigger on the twenty seven E.M. and the five minute chart. "
"8084820","8086280"," Uh, what's trading view?"
"8086460","8089500"," I'm confused why I put ticks on discord."
"8090520","8091900"," Why not put ticks on discord?"
"8092280","8094320"," What's the ticks on discord you're talking about, Panda?"
"8103030","8104610"," Can you guys hear me right now or no?"
"8109950","8111970"," The critique is saying you can't hear me."
"8121570","8124450"," So the, so the idea here is that hang tight here. "
"8124710","8125870"," So the idea here is this."
"8127870","8129690"," So on trading view, right?"
"8130610","8132550"," These tickers will be charted out."
"8133010","8133810"," Does that make sense?"
"8134730","8137110"," There'll be alerts created on trading view. "
"8139330","8144870"," And I was on the phone just now discussing with, uh, with Joe about."
"8145690","8149390"," Now how to get you access to the trading view charts, right?"
"8149950","8153890"," Those trading view charts will have alerts set on them that will send an e-mail out."
"8154770","8155530"," To you, right?"
"8155690","8157590"," Once a week you'll get an e-mail with these alerts. "
"8158110","8160790"," You'll be, you'll know about the alerts, uh, whatever happens in discord."
"8161110","8164690"," However, the webhook's got going discord, um, it's, it's its own thing."
"8177440","8177980"," Yeah, yeah. "
"8178280","8182040"," No, so all these, all these alerts on trading view are, looks like if you're going to look, you"
"8182040","8185280"," guys understand, you guys know that you can do alerts on lines on trading view."
"8218879","8220920"," Yeah, it saves the alerts on trading view."
"8222440","8226379"," I'll get them here inside of a, I'll get them here inside of the live stream. "
"8227360","8230200"," And then they get, you can like, how can I have e-mail?"
"8230420","8232580"," They can have them texted, whatever, whatever I want."
"8236030","8237830"," We can webhook them into the discord."
"8238049","8244670"," We can webhook them to an e-mail, a text message, whatever, a private, a private Twitter handle. "
"8244670","8245309"," It doesn't matter."
"8258740","8259719"," Yeah, I agree, Binky."
"8280290","8283190"," I think, in my view, everything's holding up quite well right now. "
"8283209","8283730"," I'm not seeing."
"8306059","8308540"," So this looks like more of the same to me."
"8308680","8309639"," I don't know about you. "
"8310059","8311100"," Let's look back here."
"8311260","8315940"," This is March 31st, right?"
"8316280","8316360"," Right?"
"8316559","8318500"," My cursor is over at March 31st."
"8318680","8319360"," I don't see. "
"8320520","8324219"," And even in true range, let's look at true range right now."
"8327020","8331360"," Even on the lows back on April 26th."
"8333420","8335360"," And May 4th. "
"8336459","8340799"," Even if we were to sell down right now to, you know, 404."
"8343420","8345120"," Which is what we're looking for, right?"
"8345320","8345379"," 404."
"8346340","8347820"," You still don't have any new lows. "
"8348660","8349600"," Does that make sense?"
"8350080","8351219"," Still no new lows."
"8351760","8354139"," And these are, I think this is 30 sessions."
"8354440","8359520"," I could be wrong in this, but I think going back here, this is 25 or 30 sessions or something. "
"8360700","8363299"," It's been insane to move across here."
"8364080","8368260"," So like the market crash trade, all that stuff still is not showing itself."
"8368520","8374120"," US two-year yield rises, 10 basis points on the day to 4 spot 116%. "
"8374680","8376980"," Though, of course, we know that it's coming."
"8376980","8378500"," We can see it here, right?"
"8380200","8383080"," So what you're trying, let's look at this from this perspective."
"8384260","8386540"," So what you're, so the positive here is. "
"8388620","8391320"," So this is February 23rd, right?"
"8394820","8400420"," What the positive is here in February 23rd is I'm assuming that that we're here, right?"
"8402540","8403620"," That was the high."
"8405160","8407560"," And we're going to bloodbath it down, right?"
"8408760","8412200"," We're going to start like crashing in stuff and go to the depths of hell, right?"
"8415760","8417420"," We're kind of almost there."
"8417860","8419080"," So you see this right here?"
"8420920","8427230"," Kind of this stuff here, but what you're really looking for is this one right here. "
"8427230","8428650"," You're looking for that blood down there."
"8432750","8434050"," That's what you're looking for, right?"
"8434050","8435050"," For this downward."
"8435330","8437730"," We're kind of there, but kind of not there, right?"
"8452400","8453580"," Still not seen here. "
"8453760","8457240"," So all the blood that's being talked about, none of that has happened as of yet."
"8472880","8474800"," So the idea that we have blood today, right?"
"8474980","8476960"," Like blood, blood, bright red blood."
"8477240","8478280"," We really haven't. "
"8479160","8481740"," In the grand scheme of things, none of that has happened yet."
"8481900","8485440"," As a matter of fact, we haven't even gotten back to previous lows from yesterday."
"8486440","8489740"," We haven't seen previous lows from two days ago. "
"8490420","8495560"," We've actually had a series of higher lows at this point in the market."
"8498770","8501750"," What you really want to see is a new low, right?"
"8501910","8502530"," We're not seeing it."
"8502870","8505190"," Higher low, higher low, higher low. "
"8508280","8511080"," Still have not seen that new low."
"8511340","8514360"," So just be careful on the make it see that it's happening."
"8514440","8517580"," I can see that we know that it's happening. "
"8517740","8518380"," It's going to happen."
"8518380","8522420"," You can see cell side, like trying right now."
"8522460","8527440"," There are hedge funds actively right now trying to sell this to the depths of hell, like slam it"
"8527440","8528100"," down, right?"
"8528780","8529860"," And get that new low. "
"8533700","8538260"," They still have been unsuccessful at this point to do it."
"8539500","8542760"," It's not easy to crash the S&P 500."
"8545240","8546760"," It's not an easy thing to do. "
"8548300","8549520"," It's the S&P 500."
"8549780","8550140"," It goes up."
"8550400","8550980"," That's what it does. "
"8555200","8563560"," So the intent here or the idea here is that at a minimum, sell side for today, at least, is"
"8563560","8566000"," looking for this S2, this S3 down here."
"8566100","8566860"," That's what they want, right?"
"8567080","8567480"," That new low."
"8568140","8570620"," Well, I should say at minimum, they want this one right here. "
"8572080","8574380"," At minimum, sell side wants to get underneath."
"8575210","8578300"," And as we said before, hold the daily trigger."
"8581220","8583280"," They have not been able to do that, right?"
"8583700","8584980"," We've watched the daily trigger. "
"8585940","8588760"," Come down, hold, come down, hold."
"8590820","8592140"," And hold again."
"8593940","8596920"," We're stair casing up, not down. "
"8637940","8639820"," Man, I got y'all bearish in here today."
"8640020","8640840"," I'm like..."
"8642360","8647920"," I had to say something about the bear case this morning because it's a valid point."
"8648740","8651180"," Chase makes a valid point saying that, right?"
"8651560","8652360"," Can the market roll over?"
"8653180","8656040"," And spy shows that it should roll over at some point. "
"8657960","8663420"," Spy velocity is saying spy should roll over at some point, that we should go down."
"8663420","8665780"," I don't know that I agree with the depths of how far we go down."
"8665840","8668360"," I'm not down on the 3600 trade. "
"8668420","8669960"," I'll trade it level by level."
"8670860","8676000"," I'm more in line with Winky saying maybe max down is 378, somewhere down there."
"8676660","8677980"," I think that's even a stretch. "
"8680400","8682160"," But we at least have to discuss it."
"8682160","8686760"," I don't want you to come back on the program in two weeks and say, oh, I told you so."
"8687460","8689520"," And I already told you how to trade it two weeks ago. "
"8689520","8699460"," I said, take yourself out a ratio spread to trade that down move to 36 or 380"
"8699460","8701760"," or whatever it is, 3800."
"8704540","8721810"," My positive is still to the upside, 424.30. We"
"8721810","8726210"," have to discuss it because we've been discussing it for two weeks because we were looking at the"
"8726210","8728730"," daily and we're like, yeah, it's getting over over about at this point."
"8728890","8729370"," It's rotating. "
"8730170","8731710"," It should roll at some point."
"8732710","8735090"," But then the discussion becomes how far does the role get to?"
"8736810","8739290"," And there are some people you trust out there, right?"
"8739470","8740930"," You guys are like, I trust this group."
"8741050","8741810"," I trust that group. "
"8742190","8743810"," And they're saying that we're going to get that crash."
"8745570","8746930"," So we'll entertain it."
"8758840","8759920"," Nick Bear music. "
"8767560","8770000"," Yeah, you know, you know, you know, it's like."
"8771060","8774860"," So the VIX is trading 17 to $30, right?"
"8776420","8779120"," A four-site finance is saying nobody is bearish."
"8779840","8787340"," Like a VIX is telling you to expect less volatility. "
"8788910","8790650"," And that's what it's telling you, right?"
"8791030","8793010"," Further out in time, it's telling you expect less volatility."
"8795710","8802710"," And this spy specifically, even when the market is down, it's hard to get the spy to go down like"
"8802710","8805510"," 500 points, 700 points, 800 points."
"8806850","8808410"," That's why I always ask like price. "
"8808770","8810230"," Like, what is your price for crash?"
"8811610","8812470"," Is it 380?"
"8812850","8813210"," Is it 360?"
"8813810","8814150"," Is it 28?"
"8814530","8814710"," Is 32?"
"8816450","8816790"," Is it 396?"
"8816790","8823190"," And the last window of weakness that we had, we didn't get a window weakness, did we?"
"8823650","8826430"," We got a normal bounce on trend going up."
"8829470","8834550"," And I always question about the motivations of people is, are you saying crash so that we can get a"
"8834550","8835590"," normal bounce, right?"
"8835790","8838290"," And then you wrap it up and you go home once we hit trend."
"8839130","8843630"," You take the money and run, but you wanted to create more fair than was needed to get to that"
"8843630","8843930"," point. "
"8847030","8850770"," I go right back to like crashing the spy is not an easy thing."
"8851110","8858410"," I posted on Twitter last week the DGIA where we had one giant red bar on it and how rare"
"8858410","8860430"," it is to get a giant red bar on it's rare."
"8860630","8861610"," It's like years. "
"8865030","8869890"," So when you see that giant red bar, you buy it every time historically you do."
"8872290","8873450"," Squeezing up now to 412."
"8877150","8881310"," Declining resistance on the tweezers reversal second reversal right in third reverse. "
"8881490","8883030"," We got one two and three."
"8883610","8886830"," We'll see if south side will try to step back in one more time here."
"8903720","8906180"," Yeah, I saw that I've been watching that. "
"8906480","8911220"," I've been watching that group of investors with the chat GPT stuff and I didn't make a comment"
"8911220","8912700"," until yesterday area last night."
"8913460","8919240"," I'm like, man, that is so like too much traction, too much visibility."
"8921620","8923560"," Like that whole power to the people thing. "
"8923700","8925040"," I'm like, that always blows up."
"8926840","8928860"," Brings the sharks brings the hedge funds."
"8929200","8933100"," They figure out what you're doing and they come in and just start murdering you and then each"
"8933100","8933460"," other. "
"8934840","8936540"," And someone else made a great comment."
"8936700","8940060"," They were like, this is an LLM, not a not actual general AI."
"8941680","8942980"," To learn language model. "
"8943200","8943980"," It's not going to be able."
"8944140","8944980"," It's not actually AI."
"8945300","8946300"," Not even near actually. "
"8954730","8957910"," Yeah, I don't like the timing of foresight finance."
"8958090","8963430"," My one thing, man, my one big fly in the ointment is how deep does it go on?"
"8964450","8967370"," IWM like if you see small caps go down to."
"8968030","8973750"," I mean, it's not the exact number of of the lows of. "
"8974870","8978390"," It's an important that little gray line and white line I showed you down there."
"8978470","8979810"," I'm like, that's a very important."
"8980170","8982050"," It's basically COVID lows. "
"8983690","8985310"," On trend, it's COVID lows."
"8985790","8990710"," So you get that low this week or next month in the month of June."
"8990930","8992470"," That might be the market bottom forever. "
"8993890","8996510"," And that was my point was if we're getting down there."
"8996610","9001510"," If we're getting down like 360 on spy 3600 and you get the rut down there that deep."
"9003990","9005190"," That might be it, man. "
"9006010","9007330"," That might be the last one."
"9008030","9009510"," But first off, I welcome it."
"9009890","9012830"," If that happens, I just don't like the timing of it. "
"9014350","9017270"," I'd really like to see companies going bankrupt."
"9017590","9018150"," All that happens."
"9019790","9023830"," I want the timing of it all to kind of match up and we're not seeing the timing right now"
"9023830","9024250"," match up. "
"9051930","9054590"," Hey, Winky, did you see the, um, did you see."
"9056690","9058210"," The Mike Barry post."
"9060110","9062530"," When he was down there buying all the regionals with us. "
"9063810","9064770"," Did you see that?"
"9065670","9066990"," Or at least that stuff."
"9067230","9068130"," I think yesterday, a day before."
"9078940","9079760"," One other comment. "
"9079760","9084480"," Also, they're using chat at 3.5 and didn't answer yet the question about how they tie into car and"
"9084480","9084620"," earnings."
"9085760","9086860"," Oh, no kidding, Binky."
"9086860","9089400"," Yeah, I think that. "
"9090220","9094280"," I think if they were so my view is if they were doing it with a small group."
"9095260","9096860"," And then went public with it."
"9096980","9098580"," It would work for a time. "
"9100060","9104140"," But I think by like going public with it immediately, it just attracts."
"9105120","9108880"," A group of money, a group of retail money to just sell into."
"9120600","9121620"," Yeah, I don't. "
"9121620","9123180"," Yeah, so yeah, job cuts are normally."
"9123600","9125680"," So job cuts normally don't affect."
"9126700","9130520"," So job cuts typically increase bottom line, right?"
"9130740","9134720"," The companies tend to outperform when they're cutting jobs. "
"9135560","9138120"," We'd like the flip where everyone's losing their job."
"9138140","9139180"," That really hasn't happened yet."
"9144360","9154280"," Oh, so what"
"9154280","9156400"," dude, Winky, get on your, uh, on your. "
"9157000","9159260"," I posted last night, Winky, I posted two things."
"9160080","9166680"," I posted the Mike Barry and alongside my post that I'd made on May 5th."
"9167100","9169260"," It was that post was about you and I."
"9170980","9171900"," Here, hold on, Winky. "
"9172280","9174860"," You can what you can read it on the, what's the, what's the Twitter?"
"9175940","9177760"," Where you're not on Twitter, but you can read Twitter posts."
"9178620","9179420"," What's that shit called?"
"9179600","9181580"," Knit, Knit, Knit, Twitter, something."
"9183900","9185160"," Hold on, Winky, I got your brother. "
"9197770","9199250"," I got two posts for you, Winky."
"9207110","9208650"," I think it's Knit, Twit."
"9208970","9209270"," I can't be right. "
"9209490","9210010"," I might have that wrong."
"9211450","9212270"," There's one, Winky."
"9220890","9222070"," And here's the other one. "
"9227410","9228870"," This is the one you want to read, Winky."
"9230730","9231530"," This is like that."
"9231690","9232950"," This is the juice right here, brother. "
"9233730","9235390"," Now I know you hate zero hedge."
"9237650","9239190"," But you got to read, you got to at least read."
"9241690","9242470"," This last one I got. "
"9243890","9244830"," Is it Knit, Twit?"
"9244830","9257280"," No, it's not"
"9257280","9257780"," Knit, Twit."
"9257960","9258240"," What is it?"
"9258420","9258900"," What is it called?"
"9259060","9259760"," Like how to read Twitter?"
"9261620","9267120"," Fed's boss, as I expect, to be able to present thinking on the Fed's holistic capital review by"
"9267120","9267640"," this summer."
"9270220","9273280"," The chat right now is crazy. "
"9274260","9276960"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market."
"9277160","9279920"," I think there's like 20 different side conversations going on in the chat."
"9279920","9280600"," Don't count. "
"9283940","9285020"," How to read Twitter."
"9290800","9291700"," Without an account."
"9297700","9300900"," I forget what it's fucking called. "
"9308260","9310020"," It's talking about it on Reddit all the time."
"9312500","9313600"," I think it's Knitter."
"9314220","9315260"," Yeah, that's what it is. "
"9315460","9315640"," Knitter."
"9315900","9316440"," Joe, you got it."
"9316600","9316780"," Knitter. "
"9318340","9318660"," It's Knitter."
"9318660","9319740"," It can't, it can't even be."
"9319900","9321020"," I'm not making some money here. "
"9331630","9332250"," Yeah, dude."
"9332530","9333330"," So, Winky, dude."
"9333770","9337930"," So, I made a post on Twitter and I was basically referencing you and I."
"9338050","9342970"," I'm like, we're over here trying to buy the depths of how unregional banks and the entire"
"9342970","9346110"," conversation is cell-regional banks. "
"9348230","9351190"," When the cell-regional banks was like three months ago."
"9357170","9360190"," you're not looking at the right you're not looking at the right you're not looking at the right"

"9375070","9381970"," looking at the right you're not looking at the right you know what I mean?"
"9382070","9382970"," I just have Bitcoin, right?"
"9384090","9389130"," or when I was speaking yesterday about buying houses when they were maybe it was yesterday or day"
"9389130","9393350"," before and I was like, yeah, I was like I should have bought a bunch of these houses and just"
"9393350","9401890"," held them I was like two or something big mistakes in my life would be, I think the regional banks"
"9401890","9407670"," are very similar to that making a large mistake in your life and you look back and years later and"
"9407670","9414550"," go shit, I should have been buying all that stuff And instead I was cracking jokes on Fintuit or,"
"9414770","9424010"," you know, just pushing the narrative of Schwab's going bankrupt and not realizing that, you know,"
"9424310","9426990"," three, five years down the road that was playing."
"9427910","9429150"," And who was in that play?"
"9430130","9431790"," Buying the dip was Mike Barrie. "
"9434430","9436610"," A bear icon."
"9455330","9458930"," And he didn't release it winky until 10 days later."
"9459790","9462730"," So I'm like, yeah, if we were talking about it 15 days before that. "
"9463550","9470750"," And then I got so angry, I made a post on Twitter, and then 10 days later, he makes it"
"9470750","9470930"," known."
"9479940","9482420"," Cues crushing it right now."
"9484620","9486140"," New high in the queues. "
"9488120","9489740"," 328, 74."
"9493640","9496460"," Meanwhile, spy being stifled."
"9497840","9499440"," Can't wait for this hedge to come off the market. "
"9503170","9506010"," A VIX dropping down to the hourly trigger."

"9514150","9517050"," Fair value on SPX."
"9519090","9522550"," On the spy, I think, 415 fair value."
"9530460","9531960"," Fair value on the spy. "
"9532240","9535090"," 415 not reflected in price right now."
"9536070","9538070"," VIX trading down to the depths of hell."
"9538650","9541070"," Just tagged for 1740. "
"9542770","9545710"," Bear is about to get run the fuck over right here."
"9546710","9547350"," They got to."
"9548170","9548990"," What are you going to do?"
"9549090","9552010"," Have the VIX go to 10 in the spy to be trading 4, 11, 81. "
"9552470","9553270"," That shit ain't happening."
"9564380","9568600"," Yeah, he's down there buying while you guys like when you guys are all dancing on the regional"

"9597710","9599670"," Yeah, Amazon's getting that AI love. "
"9599670","9600570"," I agree with Binky."
"9677090","9683170"," VIX now breaking below the hourly trigger trading 1736."
"9683710","9685650"," Spy still not reflecting. "
"9685650","9716550"," And this is"
"9716550","9719490"," what they talk about right now about the market manipulation."
"9719950","9721650"," They say dealers aren't in the spy market."
"9722250","9723550"," Say it's only hedge funds. "
"9724770","9738510"," I've been"
"9758890","9761410"," sitting in calls since the lows down here."
"9761510","9762950"," Not these ones, but down here."

"9842240","9843700"," I'm looking at XOM XLE."
"9844760","9849460"," See now in the first of the month I want to get involved in some some energy plays."
"9849840","9851280"," We're gonna talk about energy plays today too. "
"9857520","9859960"," VIX trying to find its feet right now."
"9862420","9864060"," Massive hedge on the spy."
"9864440","9864900"," Massive. "

"9896030","9897070"," I'm like, I'll be honest with you."

"9965560","9972660"," If he was looking for an alert starting to get an alert on Tesla on hourly trend to the upside"

"9983050","9984610"," Are you watching it, Lord Pente?"
"9984710","9985750"," It's almost there, brother."
"9988070","9991710"," If it comes back down and checks in its stays, right?"
"9991990","9993510"," Like it's called the kiss play."

"10089350","10093070"," You want to wait for confirmation, Lord Pente, or have a stop below."
"10104810","10107150"," Some call spreads may work too, Lord Pente."
"10107290","10107910"," Let's stop on them. "
"10115570","10116710"," Almost there, though, brother."
"10126030","10130430"," There's some kind of a bull trap forming on VIX right now on Spy."

"10217280","10221480"," I still make more money on Spy than Q's."
"10221480","10226520"," An example would be this, like, how to explain this better to you."
"10226920","10230460"," Spy is the most illiquid ETF out there, right?"
"10231500","10237220"," Might take you all day long in a Spy trade to print 300, 400% or something like that. "
"10237360","10241800"," Spy can usually make it, usually, not today, in 15 minutes."
"10242440","10243920"," Five minutes, something like that."
"10252630","10257090"," Spy trade is a lot faster than individual tickers, typically. "

"10275930","10277190"," The only way is sideways."
"10289060","10290500"," Man, this is killing me, though."
"10290900","10291840"," Today, this is killing me. "
"10293540","10295600"," Mys are bleeding watching this all day long today."

"10301260","10302660"," I'm just sitting here waiting."
"10303820","10305060"," Two weeks spent like that."
"10305580","10306900"," All right, not this week, past two weeks. "
"10307620","10309340"," I'll sit here in a trade and finally print."
"10310140","10311600"," I'll sit here for, like, three, four hours."

"10347070","10348110"," You're going to go rest your back. "
"10348970","10350310"," Just keep your eyes on that hourly, man."
"10352270","10353470"," This is a straight yawn fast."
"10353770","10354150"," Absolutely. "
"10361880","10362900"," Yeah, and I leave them on."
"10363300","10364360"," They ain't a print in every day."
"10370890","10371790"," Well, they have been. "
"10372070","10373370"," If they don't, today, I'll be upset."
"10376830","10378390"," VIX trading back up again."
"10378890","10384550"," Oh, man, dude, watching this VIX right now, it's killing me. "
"10399970","10402610"," Yeah, Binky and I were talking about Amazon on the phone last night."
"10402610","10407170"," We spent about a half an hour talking about AI with Amazon last night."
"10416040","10417820"," Binky, Binky and Chime in about Amazon. "

"10471650","10473890"," if this is my dip buy down here for XOM."
"10478800","10480000"," Look at it in the background."
"10483670","10485130"," It's almost there, dude. "
"10485770","10486890"," Almost there."
"10488510","10498510"," So right where XOM is right now, look back on Friday, March 17th and"
"10498510","10501010"," Friday, March 24th."
"10502950","10505090"," I'm going to actually just enter this position here. "
"10524720","10525760"," Look at XLA."
"10526360","10540630"," I think I'm"

"11772050","11772190"," right?"
"11772430","11773670"," I had some illegal immigrant friends."
"11774330","11775490"," A lot of them pay taxes. "
"11775790","11777850"," They use someone else's social security number."
"11778690","11779850"," They'll loan them out."
"11781250","11784350"," So if you're like the real ID law and all that kind of stuff. "
"11784970","11786290"," So they are paying taxes."
"11786810","11793770"," Now I have also heard that some illegals will try to claim high number of, they'll be like, I've"
"11793770","11797670"," got 10 children or something, so they're claiming like max on their IRS."
"11798070","11799710"," There should be some enforcement of that stuff. "
"11800390","11803490"," But truly, our immigration should be reformed, right?"
"11803690","11809690"," We should have some kind of an easy way for seasonal migrant workers, right?"
"11809910","11814970"," If you're coming up from Mexico, pay taxes, you get services, you're working, put your kids in"
"11814970","11815890"," school, whatever it is you do."
"11816510","11820650"," As long as you're like legitimately paying into the system, paying taxes and all that kind of"
"11820650","11820890"," stuff."
"11821990","11822770"," We should have it. "
"11822910","11824610"," It should be simple, like a simple program."
"11824790","11827210"," You come across the border, you work, go home when you want to go home."
"11828610","11829530"," Add to our tax base. "
"11830650","11831390"," And make it easy."
"11832570","11837310"," It's like I get the point of like, we don't want illegals here, but we do."
"11837650","11838510"," The truth is we do. "
"11838650","11839270"," We need them here."
"11839390","11840610"," We have to have them here one way or another."
"11840910","11842390"," We have to have immigrants in the country. "
"11842630","11843470"," And it's a real hard way."
"11843650","11849450"," It's a really difficult for immigrants to come across legally and easily like, hey, come into the"
"11849450","11849690"," country."
"11849810","11852010"," You want to be able to mow in lawns or pickin' chickens. "
"11853450","11855030"," Whatever it is you want to do, cook in a restaurant."
"11857710","11858910"," You monitor them, right?"
"11858910","11860030"," Make sure they're paying the taxes."
"11866490","11868250"," Yeah, it could lead to permanent citizenship. "
"11868370","11874430"," I've had friends, I haven't known somebody, anyone personally, but I've known people in my, when I"
"11874430","11880390"," was in the army, I knew guys through friends that served in the army and got sent back home."
"11881230","11886830"," That served like military, like served duty in Iraq, sent back to Mexico."
"11888830","11890110"," That wasn't cool either. "
"11890110","11891270"," I was upset with that."
"11891270","11894410"," They're like, oh, they got a traffic infraction."
"11894590","11895370"," They're going back to Mexico. "
"11895670","11896150"," I'm like, what?"
"11898190","11899350"," They served their country."
"11899530","11900070"," They're going back home."
"11900370","11901010"," That's kind of crazy. "
"11903410","11904430"," It's always kind of weird."
"11904570","11908050"," You hear it like, but you know it's there."
"11908270","11909330"," It's always there. "
"11910090","11912170"," Do you guys ever see the movie The Day Without a Mexican?"
"11912790","11916330"," It wasn't really well produced, but the point was good."
"11918390","11922350"," Have you ever had like, have you ever had like every illegal immigrant leave the US?"
"11922770","11924190"," The US would cease to function."
"11925490","11931490"," It would be worse than the debt, a debt ceiling not being passed or the debt limit being raised. "
"11936320","11943220"," Yeah, we have some kind of a system like that for people with skills and money."
"11943520","11945660"," We're one of the most difficult countries to get into."
"11945800","11946300"," You know that, right?"
"11946980","11953120"," So if you travel the world a lot, getting into the US, whether on tourist visa or work visa, it's"
"11953120","11953500"," not easy. "
"11954620","11955500"," That's very challenging."
"11957180","11959560"," If you're a sailor out there, you probably know this."
"11960060","11964600"," When you sail from country to country, this is one of the most locked down countries in the free"
"11964600","11964920"," world. "
"11965660","11966640"," But not the only one."
"11966760","11968500"," Japan's expensive and difficult."
"11968800","11971520"," Australia, a lot of Europe is as well. "
"11978190","11982070"," You know, bless to make a good point that people that weren't able to get jobs would be able to."
"11982070","11986050"," I think you are correct and not correct."
"11986370","11990790"," I think there's a lot of work out there that you'd be surprised Americans don't want to do. "
"11991550","11992850"," You'd be very surprised."
"11994050","11997090"," So it's William says that inflation is critically important."
"11997710","11999150"," Those jobs are always available. "
"12000190","12002770"," You can find those jobs available and you can ask those."
"12002930","12006690"," You can ask the owners of those companies like, we don't get American applicants on those jobs."
"12007690","12008550"," You just don't. "
"12038380","12041660"," We just spy rejecting off the hourly trigger right now."

"12734690","12736750"," Yeah, it wasn't any gas up past couple days."

"12786380","12788140"," Does the hedge come off the market?"
"12790080","12791260"," Making my eyes bleed."
"12797500","12800280"," All I want to do is get past June 2nd, man."
"12800880","12803620"," Put a hedge on the market and get out of here for a couple of weeks. "
"12804560","12805740"," Oh, yeah, we're going to talk about that."
"12805840","12806080"," Shoot."
"12808440","12815000"," Okay, so just so you guys, when I talk, do I talk about this stuff?"

"12829170","12830770"," Winky will be gone."
"12832190","12836750"," June 2nd until June 11th. "
"12839660","12843770"," He says he has an operation on his butthole."
"12846440","12848990"," June 2nd until June 11th."
"12848990","12850270"," He will not be in stream. "
"12852150","12858310"," So we probably need somebody to step up for Winky between June 2nd June 11th."
"12859130","12860970"," He has a butth operation."
"12861910","12864870"," And so he said that he can't sit in his chair. "
"12865090","12867150"," Something will be lying face down."
"12873530","12876050"," Something about sitting on concrete."
"12876050","12881050"," And he's got some, I don't know, fissures or something. "
"12881230","12881490"," I don't know."
"12885970","12887370"," Oh, wait a minute."
"12887990","12889250"," So I got to write that down too. "
"12890290","12891750"," Joe Donut will be gone."
"12892890","12896550"," The second until the 12th."
"12896670","12897650"," And write that down too. "
"12901840","12904460"," June 2nd until June 12th."
"12908050","12910290"," This is Selyn May, go away, right?"
"12910470","12911590"," Selyn May, go away."
"12914650","12916310"," Selyn May, go away, right?"
"12923040","12930120"," So spread the word that Winky has a butth operation from June 2nd until June 12th. "
"12930480","12930960"," Wish him well."
"12932280","12938200"," If you can, just send him flowers, flowers, candies."
"12946700","12947900"," Spread the cheeks. "
"12950480","12952660"," He is getting butt implants."
"12954520","12959260"," His wife wanted calf and butt implants, but he likes his calves."
"12961740","12962920"," He says they're fine. "
"12966400","12967680"," Butt loz and gers."
"12982710","12989630"," I haven't, so I've got some weekend stuff coming up right now, the weekends, but nothing in stone"
"12989630","12992770"," for summer."
"12992910","12996450"," I've went to my wife yesterday and asked her what plans were for this summer. "
"12997650","13000670"," And she's not the greatest communicator, shocker."
"13005850","13008930"," So I think I'm here through, I think I'm here through June."
"13010270","13016810"," But I do have either this Friday or next Friday. "
"13017690","13021550"," I'm going to check my calendar, but I think I have a meeting this Friday that I have to attend."
"13023650","13025650"," And next Friday as well."
"13026950","13033930"," Now I do have my new setup for the stream to continue. "
"13036810","13044370"," So I'm either going to try to get a pinky in here to drop drop in on the stream."
"13044370","13046510"," You'll have a stream whether I'm here or not."
"13046730","13048210"," No matter what, you'll get a stream. "
"13050570","13052670"," And I'm going to try to do a remote."
"13053170","13062210"," I'm also going to try to do a remote login from a remote laptop and see if I can set"
"13062210","13062830"," the stream up."
"13063490","13065090"," I'm testing it right now. "
"13065490","13073290"," I can do like a remote laptop that will turn the stream on if I'm not here."
"13073950","13077190"," So the stream will be on regardless whether I'm here or not."
"13077950","13083490"," But just think this Friday and next Friday, depending on how Friday goes, I have a meeting in the"
"13083490","13085930"," morning that I have to attend on Friday. "
"13086790","13087730"," I think it's at 12 o'clock."
"13087810","13089410"," I'm not sure 11 o'clock or something like that."
"13090010","13092450"," Maybe you'll get me for the first hour and a half on Friday. "
"13092450","13093110"," Chat with you."
"13093530","13095970"," And then the stream will continue without me on air."
"13096110","13097430"," The ultimate agreements are low. "
"13097810","13101470"," If the meeting produces headlines, they are more likely to be negative."
"13102230","13106730"," As the Goldman Sachs is central scenarios, still that the Treasury's cash balance will drop to"
"13106730","13110010"," minimal levels from June 8th to the 13th."
"13110010","13114050"," So again, this is just coming from a Goldman Sachs being cited by a Twitter reporter. "
"13114930","13117010"," Now, maybe I need to put a calendar somewhere."
"13120710","13122330"," We're getting to that point, aren't we, Joe?"

"13343330","13351570"," hammer regulation and then slowly ease or license what people can do."
"13353790","13355170"," But you don't really want that, right?"
"13355270","13356070"," You got too many greedy people. "
"13356470","13358890"," Like you got like JPM would be like you can't have that."
"13359690","13364210"," Yeah, Amazon would be like we can't have that either."
"13364270","13365090"," That's the problem, right?"
"13365230","13370890"," It's out of the bag, so greed and power won't let that happen. "
"13379060","13384360"," Markin says the number one lesson from the 1970s is don't 70s is don't quit too soon."
"13384820","13387840"," Most people I talked to anticipated downturn over the coming quarters."
"13388580","13389420"," I'm glad he went over that earlier. "
"13389680","13390900"," Squeezing right now in the spy."
"13396340","13399620"," Goldman Sachs on the debt ceiling, the odds of an agreement are very low."
"13399900","13403360"," So if the meetings produce headlines, they are more likely to be negative. "
"13404420","13409620"," Our central scenario is still that the treasury's cash balance will drop to minimal levels from"
"13409620","13411640"," June 18th to the 13th."
"13412500","13414080"," It's coming from a CNBC reporter."
"13434680","13440780"," House Speaker McCarthy is saying they need to get a quote or they need to quote get a framework of"
"13440780","13441840"," a deal by this weekend. "
"13442520","13443060"," End quote."
"13443700","13447980"," A bill will move through the House in three to four days and the Senate in a week."
"13448700","13451280"," I believe in Yellen's early June deadline. "
"13452060","13455820"," I'm not going to argue with you on that box reporter tweets."
"13464020","13474520"," Man, I'll tell you what like I'm reading"
"13474520","13491410"," these Fed comments and they just"
"13491410","13493350"," throw shit against the wall and hope it sticks, right?"
"13493670","13496290"," They're not stick, but you can't get called back on it."
"13510540","13515440"," Nasdaq and Morgan Stanley CEO is right to Biden on default danger. "
"13525780","13527860"," Man, talk about stirring the volatility pot."
"13539550","13540690"," Yeah, I agree with that, Winky."
"13543770","13549230"," I don't talk about it on stream, Winky, but like I try not to like this specific stuff I try"
"13549230","13549650"," not to. "
"13550290","13554730"," But like you read a lot of these Fed presidents when they once they're done doing their job, they"
"13554730","13563530"," write memoirs and they talk about they're like we have no fucking idea if these tools work."
"13563710","13564870"," We don't even think that they do work."
"13566570","13570210"," They're like we think it's all just timing of business cycles. "
"13571150","13574650"," So we apply these tools and we think they were at the end of a business cycle."
"13579340","13581140"," Please say shit like that in their memoirs."
"13581200","13582020"," It's kind of wild to read. "
"13587100","13589380"," It gives the impression that they're making a difference."
"13603300","13604360"," Freezer tucks for Winky."
"13611340","13613220"," Oh, there's not a lot of news right now. "
"13613860","13615260"," There's not a lot of news right now."
"13619250","13621010"," Yeah, corporate tax revenue coming in."
"13621170","13622970"," So they have plenty of money for a few more months. "
"13623990","13625430"," This will drag on for a while."
"13625970","13626310"," Always does."
"13626930","13627730"," I think it does too. "
"13627730","13628590"," You have the X3 tracer."
"13632520","13633620"," That didn't worry, Rome."
"13633740","13634000"," How are you?"
"13646730","13648010"," Just drag an ass here. "
"13649170","13650390"," Nothing happened in the market right now."
"13650470","13650930"," We're worried, Rome."
"13656490","13658390"," Yeah, they do and they don't like. "
"13659630","13661430"," So here's a here's an example."
"13662470","13665410"," If you look at they know how to break people."
"13666550","13668050"," I agree with that statement. "
"13668990","13670590"," So they know how to break you."
"13672730","13677970"," As a as an individual, they don't hurt you the most."
"13678890","13680890"," They have a real hard time hurting businesses. "
"13681370","13682670"," Businesses, they take loans."
"13682930","13687470"," They don't care what if you look back on the commercial debt."
"13690330","13693330"," Well, that's taken on since like 1978. "
"13694550","13698290"," None of these companies care how much debt they take on."
"13698290","13700010"," They don't care what the interest rates are."
"13700590","13701830"," They just keep taking the debt on. "
"13702030","13703270"," And then people are like, well, it's tightening."
"13704050","13705690"," There's no tightening for these big companies."
"13706270","13706490"," None. "
"13707830","13709410"," It's been a straight line up."
"13709570","13709990"," Never stopped."
"13711030","13714870"," Through recessions, through depressions, but it doesn't matter. "
"13715090","13717050"," They run these companies until they break."
"13718330","13721430"," Now you, on the other hand, through these cycles, you're the one that takes the hit."
"13723130","13724170"," UKPM's the nice office. "
"13724410","13726210"," That's really what they're breaking, I guess."
"13727210","13728550"," Companies they do, they do fine."
"13729370","13731930"," There's like a natural cycle the company is along the way. "
"13733150","13734970"," This is the point by some of these Fed presidents."
"13738170","13740510"," That they already know that they're at the end of a cycle."
"13740830","13742090"," They already know that some of these companies are going to fail. "
"13743330","13745190"," And what they're really hurting is the consumer."
"13765080","13769760"," Yeah, man, if you, I'll try to, if you guys ever want, I'll try to dig up some of these"
"13769760","13770380"," books for you."
"13770480","13774840"," I haven't read them in a long time, but if you read any of these books from the Fed Chairs,"
"13775060","13782080"," from the 70s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, you can, they could, they could quote it on this stuff. "
"13782260","13784360"," They're like, yeah, we don't think this actually works."
"13787260","13792800"," So if you really, like, if you know that like a business cycle is every 78 or 15 years, not"
"13792800","13793420"," a mega cycle."
"13793420","13797640"," That's like, you know, like, what's his name called, says it's 150 year cycle, but you can kind of"
"13797640","13804160"," like get a gist of a cycle of a business cycle, like, you know, in 2008, right?"
"13804360","13805500"," We had a business cycle. "
"13806100","13811260"," You kind of knew we were coming into one, and if you were a trader before 2020, you kind of"
"13811260","13813680"," knew that we were coming into one at the end of a cycle."
"13816240","13817560"," You can kind of get a feel, right?"
"13818220","13820060"," You're like, yeah, we're kind of topping out here."
"13820620","13823900"," You can see housing prices go up and down, right up and down. "
"13824340","13828340"," So you kind of know that you kind of feel the cycle."
"13828340","13832580"," And as we're coming into one of those tops and cycles, you'll see the Fed start to step in."
"13833860","13837020"," And the question becomes, did they need to step in?"
"13838340","13840080"," Or who are they taking the money from?"
"13841180","13844900"," They kind of clean up companies, but in reality, they're cleaning you up. "
"13845660","13850560"," For all the bad decisions you made, they're coming in to take your money and opportunity away from"
"13850560","13852460"," you, give it to a new generation of young people."
"13863540","13864420"," All right, I'll be right back."
"13864520","13865380"," I got to go potty real quick. "
"13865380","13867620"," And I'll be back in like, I'm still long calls here."
"13868020","13869160"," I'll be back in five minutes."
"13869160","13869800"," I'm going to go potty. "
"13869840","13870580"," I'll be right back."
"13880640","13884140"," 101 counter-potty, take two-sport, two-sport, two-sport, two-sport, three-trillion dollars at the"
"13884140","13885380"," Fed's reverse repo operation."
"13887080","13890840"," Do yourself a solid, grab some weights, do some push-ups, whatever you're going to do, that's what"
"13890840","13891400"," I'm going to do in the background. "
"13891400","14936150"," So, excuse"
"14936150","14940130"," me, like over here in the background, working out and I'm dying."
"14945060","14947440"," Oh my god, dehydrated."
"14952910","14954390"," It's totally dehydrated. "
"14957990","14962530"," All right, there we go."
"14963290","14966810"," So I was doing like, exercising, and I'm like, I'm dehydrated."
"14966810","14968750"," I'm coughing up along because I'm dehydrated. "
"14972450","14974130"," Hey, Winky, I got a question for you."
"14979490","14981150"," I some have a question for you, Winky."
"14982570","14983810"," So TwitchCon, right?"
"14984990","14990010"," Do I need to, do I just like buy my ticket and show up?"
"14990190","14991010"," Or like, what do I do?"
"14991110","14992430"," Do I tell anybody that I'm going there?"
"14993850","14995610"," Not tell anybody that I'm going there?"
"14995990","14997710"," They had something about an event. "
"14998150","14999450"," Or what did I read?"
"15009070","15013770"," Hold on here, it says here."
"15023940","15027680"," It says TwitchCon call for content is open."
"15029340","15031640"," It's like, were you offered to do something there?"
"15032600","15034000"," Do I just like buy a ticket and show up?"
"15035880","15036660"," I don't know what to do. "
"15036800","15037700"," Do I tell them I'm coming?"
"15037860","15039060"," Do I not tell anybody I'm coming?"
"15040180","15042500"," Do I tell other people on the stream that I'm going?"
"15042780","15043400"," I don't know what it is."
"15049450","15050990"," So that's what I do, I just go, right?"
"15051670","15053190"," Is buy a ticket and show up, right?"
"15063990","15066110"," It said something, I got an email from them."
"15066270","15068370"," I don't know, I got a message from them that said something about. "
"15073330","15080990"," It says, come join the ultimate in real life party celebrating the Twitch community and everything"
"15080990","15081450"," we love."
"15082750","15084470"," Now it says that there's networking."
"15087390","15089210"," So does it have to be a partner or something?"
"15089570","15092050"," They said they have networking events. "
"15092450","15098890"," Someone was saying in a discussion they were like, oh yeah, they've got networking if you go early"
"15098890","15099410"," or something."
"15111010","15111850"," Yeah, I'm going."
"15112610","15119630"," I bought an airline ticket and I don't know, do I just buy the ticket or do I say, I"
"15119630","15120150"," don't know what to do. "
"15120870","15121970"," I've never been to TwitchCon."
"15122190","15123010"," I have no idea what it is."
"15132080","15139340"," I don't know what, I don't know, maybe I should maybe should go to the TwitchCon such trade show,"
"15139460","15139600"," right?"
"15139920","15143920"," Do I show up early or is they said something like there's, they were like, if you're a Twitch"
"15143920","15148680"," streamer, they said that you, they have meeting greets or something. "
"15148920","15149200"," I don't know."
"15151160","15155140"," I see some people go there to meet their favorite streamers, other streamers go to connect with"
"15155140","15155520"," each other."
"15160150","15161390"," Never got to meet other people. "
"15161710","15162990"," Okay, yeah, I have no idea what it is."
"15162990","15164870"," So I feel like I'm lost."
"15166850","15171850"," Maybe I'll ask somebody on unread it. "
"15171850","15172850"," I'll just be like, what do I do?"
"15173270","15173810"," I don't know what to do."
"15176210","15180070"," I think is there like a, I mean, maybe I'll have to find like, maybe there's something that says"
"15180070","15180950"," how to attend or whatever."
"15185940","15187060"," Yeah, it's in Las Vegas. "
"15188760","15191980"," There's something, you send me something that says, call for content."
"15193920","15200980"," Artists, Ali, community panels, drag, showcase, interactive workshops, musical performances, submit"
"15200980","15202520"," your application, say that's what it says."
"15203240","15204120"," Please read the guidelines. "
"15205440","15210420"," For each call for content category before applying E to be 18 plus, have a Twitch username and have"
"15210420","15211780"," an idea, it's that simple."
"15213160","15220140"," Someone said you can't gamble and stream gambling or something in Las Vegas."
"15220140","15228600"," So I was like, ah, if I was trading crypto, perps or something, I don't know if they'd allow that,"
"15229240","15231400"," the live stream perps or something. "
"15232240","15234720"," Can I like walk in with a table and be like, I'm going to sit over there?"
"15242370","15246150"," If parties and stuff hosted by vendors, some people go there and network to meet other people, they"
"15246150","15247690"," have parties and stuff hosted by vendors."
"15248190","15258950"," Yeah, they said that they said that they had, you"
"15258950","15259970"," can only use their tables."
"15259970","15262730"," Can I go with like, if I go to my, if I go to one of their tables, can I"
"15262730","15264930"," walk in with a backpack bowl laptops and stuff?"
"15265790","15272430"," And like a, a hot spot and things like that, router and all that kind of stuff. "
"15313610","15316930"," It's Friday, October 20th to Sunday, October 22nd."
"15327650","15330930"," I know that all I was told was that I jump in the ball pit first, right?"
"15332490","15333690"," So I can get hurt or something."
"15334530","15335390"," I guess people were doing that. "
"15336430","15337790"," Blood in the spy right now."
"15360290","15360850"," Head first."
"15361130","15362150"," Yeah, that's I thought, right?"
"15363470","15366090"," What was that ball pit like two feet of balls or something?"
"15369150","15373010"," It was like two feet of balls with like a concrete floor and a convention center and they're like,"
"15373010","15373670"," jump in there. "
"15375630","15379710"," Well, I guess the reason I was asking Winky was because I don't know that I want to have like,"
"15380190","15381510"," I don't know if I want to hang out in there."
"15381510","15384970"," I just want to like go in, shake some hands and be like, hi, nice to meet you and then"
"15384970","15385810"," get out of there."
"15387250","15388310"," Go gamble it or something. "
"15398710","15400850"," Yeah, I think I'm not going there for that reason."
"15400850","15401570"," I'm going there to meet."
"15401870","15408410"," I'm trying to meet a couple of people that I've already offered for me to show up and meet with"
"15408410","15413450"," them and they represent Twitch streamers. "
"15418350","15428310"," So I wanted to meet them in person with a bit of"
"15428310","15428970"," that for World War II."
"15429430","15432550"," Yeah, I think this involves like, um, sponsorship of some kind."
"15440570","15442290"," You won't work there unless you have to work there. "
"15442450","15442750"," I got you."
"15444530","15446150"," Yeah, I'm about to buy a ticket right now, so."
"15450310","15452050"," Or attempt to buy a ticket right now in the background. "
"15467990","15469650"," Yeah, no, I agree with Miller member."
"15469810","15472210"," Like, I don't want to hang out with like a bunch of 18 year old kids and shit."
"15472830","15473590"," They had no interest. "
"15476630","15478310"," I don't want to, that's my thing, Miller members."
"15478390","15482270"," Like, I don't want to show up and be like, in the corner of the room or something."
"15482990","15484330"," Just like, show up, do my thing. "
"15485310","15487770"," I want to do a live stream there, is what I want to do."
"15490110","15492130"," So, yeah, Sunday stock picking show or something."
"15493370","15498150"," I didn't invite all you animals so that you can speak, watch a live stream from TwitchCon. "
"15500050","15503650"," I think that was my, the idea, I guess this was my idea was."
"15503650","15506430"," So, you tell me, who is it?"
"15506570","15507050"," Miller member."
"15507410","15508690"," You tell me, Miller member. "
"15508790","15510850"," You tell me what, if it sounds right."
"15511070","15512830"," So, I want to go there and meet a couple of people."
"15513590","15514890"," I'll be like, hey, you know, Kevin James. "
"15516350","15517170"," Nice to meet you."
"15518550","15520270"," Some ideas that we have and stuff like that."
"15520710","15525630"," And then I wanted to do a live stream, like a stock picking show on a Saturday or Sunday. "
"15526610","15527970"," Have binky on, have winky on."
"15528410","15531450"," They won't be there, but have them on the show right together."
"15531450","15534010"," Uh, from inside. "
"15534690","15537390"," So, I think I have to have like a set up and like be ready to go and all that"
"15537390","15543210"," kind of stuff with some, um, I've got a bunch of portable monitors and some laptops and stuff."
"15546250","15548070"," So, I don't know if I have to ask to do that."
"15548270","15551170"," If I have to say, can I have a table or have I just sit at a table and do"
"15551170","15551310"," that?"
"15551910","15553550"," And then bounce out of there, you know. "
"15559190","15560510"," Miller member, do you know anything about this?"
"15560690","15562530"," Am I on the wrong track here, right track?"
"15563030","15563510"," Maybe you know more."
"15578030","15581510"," Yeah, is there like a sign up sheet for streaming or do I just show up and start streaming?"
"15581990","15586350"," Do I get to do they have like dedicated land or do they do I bring a hot spot and"
"15586350","15587870"," make sure I got a kickass?"
"15589030","15590250"," Wi-Fi and stuff like that."
"15594410","15598210"," Do you have like a young techy kid Halloween mask?"
"15598550","15600410"," I'm pretty good with tech in the background, believe it or not. "
"15600670","15602390"," I'm better than I let myself on to be."
"15604870","15610270"," Well, for for not being a winky, for like being like a normie, I think I'm pretty good."
"15614350","15618350"," Would you guys like that kind of a stream on a Saturday from TwitchCon?"
"15623240","15624280"," Yeah, that's what I was thinking. "
"15625520","15634220"," I do perps and live stream perps like trading perps and then I'll do a stock picking show on a"
"15634220","15634500"," Saturday."
"15634720","15637000"," Have all the weirdos from Twitter on there."
"15637000","15637520"," I've been to it. "
"15648390","15652370"," Yeah, I got to go there to do these meetings."
"15652370","15653090"," I don't have a choice."
"15655450","15659790"," I don't think they're going to let me trade perps because they said something about not gambling"
"15659790","15660710"," while you're live streaming. "
"15661770","15663230"," So I don't while you're there, I think."
"15663550","15667110"," So I'm like, they're like, well, you can't live stream you gambling in a casino."
"15667230","15669010"," So I'm like, ah, that's kind of the same thing. "
"15677250","15680630"," Young Ness is saying, Cap, you really don't like going over the spy chart when it's falling."
"15680770","15681310"," Let's talk about that."
"15682030","15684230"," Young Ness said, spy is falling. "
"15686630","15687990"," Well, it's opening price."
"15694730","15704550"," Opening price on spy is 4.1.92 or 4.1 "
"15704550","15709630",".65. Oh, it's not a line on it."
"15717030","15720090"," Oh, this is the spy opening price right here. "
"15723720","15725420"," Is spy falling right now?"
"15725500","15726780"," I want an answer from the community."
"15727040","15728720"," Is spy falling that yellow line right there?"
"15728720","15730740"," Is the opening price a spy a spy falling?"
"15733280","15736460"," Let me know if it's falling."
"15740600","15746520"," There's a bear cross above here on the one minute chart. "
"15747160","15748320"," We're squeezing higher now."
"15748420","15751600"," We're squeezing higher than the opening price of spy in the cash market."
"15754060","15755180"," Spy is falling. "
"15756520","15757300"," Let's go back."
"15757540","15758440"," Who brought that up?"
"15759080","15760380"," Who was that that said that?"
"15760980","15761760"," Young Ness."
"15765920","15766940"," Spy is falling. "
"15767200","15768860"," Let's go back and let's look at it one more time."
"15769440","15770220"," I think we did this earlier."
"15771080","15771660"," We'll do it again. "
"15771800","15771900"," Ready?"
"15771900","15771980"," Ready?"
"15775000","15776700"," Whoa, hold on here."
"15777980","15779240"," Spy is falling."
"15780760","15782600"," Okay, let's look at the spy again. "
"15784700","15789480"," As we said earlier, you watch my cursor right here."
"15790260","15792020"," This is daily trend on the spy."
"15793180","15797520"," Spy is stair casing up, not down. "
"15798980","15799880"," Watch my cursor."
"15801060","15802560"," Up, up, up, up, up, up, up."
"15803040","15804480"," And once again, up right here. "
"15806680","15807260"," Excuse me."
"15808720","15809160"," Also."
"15810620","15812780"," Oh, shit. "
"15813180","15813580"," We're above."
"15815300","15817240"," We're above the opening price of spy."
"15818200","15819860"," We're getting into the range, I guess. "
"15820160","15822320"," There was an up and down candle here on the one minute."
"15823180","15824860"," Let's look at a five minute chart right now."
"15826020","15832180"," We have a series of higher lows on the spy. "
"15834820","15838180"," Supposedly, I was told that the spy is going down."
"15840440","15851180"," I don't see this going down yet, so the moment, though, that we break the three sisters, when"
"15851180","15859780"," we roll down here, I will surely entertain that discussion."
"15862280","15863600"," The market's going down. "
"15863780","15870960"," Until then, unless you're sitting on a 30 second chart or a one second chart or something like"
"15870960","15873020"," that, I don't see any movement in the spy."
"15874340","15876760"," So to me, this is a slow market."
"15877320","15878020"," I'm not seeing anything. "
"15879440","15882860"," So that's why I'm not discussing the spy going down."
"15887320","15893560"," So in a five minute chart right now, the spy is now going up, and I'm not going to discuss"
"15893560","15893860"," it."
"15894840","15897720"," I didn't discuss spy going up here either. "
"15898220","15906760"," As a matter of fact, let's be honest, you get a series of higher lows on the spy today."
"15911560","15917540"," Now, the spy goes up here and trades back down again."
"15917680","15923320"," I'm still not going to talk about the spy, but the reason why I'm not talking about the spy is"
"15923320","15927740"," because on the background, I'm doing something to try to get this Twitch kind of thing done. "
"15928580","15929860"," I do spend a lot of hours here."
"15930940","15935860"," And when the market trades sideways like this, not doing much, it's not really much to talk about."
"15937560","15947460"," But most days of the year, the other 250 trading days of the year, we normally have a ton"
"15947460","15949000"," to talk about when it goes down and up. "
"15951960","15955780"," Right now, at this moment, there is no hell of a lot going on with the spy is there."
"15964880","15966820"," So I'm going to go back to my conversation really quick."
"15967700","15970760"," Always sit here in the spy doing absolutely nothing. "
"15983880","15985300"," Yeah, it's tough right here."
"15985300","15987860"," So there's no real direction in the spy."
"15988200","15990140"," So I'm not going to be like, it's not wanting to know this. "
"15990320","15992140"," Like, as a trader, you being a trader out there?"
"15994240","15995740"," We don't have a direction, right?"
"15996040","15999360"," So I can't talk about selling it down or selling it up."
"15999600","16000580"," There's no direction here."
"16002560","16005680"," So if we were talking about selling this right here, right?"
"16005820","16008560"," So someone just said, why aren't you talking about this bear flag right here?"
"16008980","16010520"," Or a bear cross, excuse me, a bear plane. "
"16011060","16011840"," Did it pay out?"
"16012640","16013080"," No."
"16015340","16016960"," So do we go down to the depths?"
"16017080","16017660"," Hell, no."
"16018980","16019960"," There's a pin here. "
"16020100","16021160"," There's a hedge on this market."
"16021280","16022560"," So the market wants to explode higher."
"16022840","16023300"," Wait, you know that. "
"16023500","16024940"," The market wants to explode right now."
"16026700","16031520"," And so Will was saying it earlier, like the young Jim Barrows are in here trying to pin this"
"16031520","16031820"," market."
"16031980","16034680"," There's a massive hedge on this market. "
"16034800","16036180"," Southside has a massive hedge right now."
"16036320","16036980"," Try to pin it down."
"16038260","16045280"," You also have sellers, right?"
"16045280","16046020"," Try to sell into. "
"16046320","16048100"," And you have equity flows coming in."
"16048180","16051420"," Middle of the month equity flows coming in the market right now."
"16051700","16052800"," Middle of the month equity flows. "
"16053080","16057180"," Like these are 401k managers, stuff like that."
"16057280","16059620"," They're putting money to work right now in the market."
"16060280","16060800"," Middle of the month. "
"16062480","16064660"," So you're not seeing a lot of movement here."
"16064900","16068180"," So if I talk about the market going down right now, did it go down?"
"16068640","16068700"," No."
"16069660","16071480"," Do I expect it to go up here?"
"16071820","16073520"," No, not unless they take the hedge off. "
"16073520","16075060"," Last 45 minutes possibly."
"16076240","16079080"," But until that happens, I don't know what to say, right?"
"16080800","16083000"," You see this right here from yesterday, right?"
"16083300","16084400"," Kind of called it, right?"
"16085740","16087620"," Look what the expectation is over here."
"16088400","16089600"," Kind of did that, right?"
"16089800","16090400"," Into the closed yesterday. "
"16090740","16092060"," It's like, do I know where the market's going?"
"16092320","16093560"," Every fucking day I do."
"16096540","16098500"," You know, do I chart it out for you?"
"16098700","16098980"," Yes."
"16099280","16100740"," Do I write the little zigzag sometimes?"
"16100860","16101260"," Yes. "
"16102460","16104800"," If we start to make a move lower, though, I'll cover it."
"16105120","16107200"," Right now, today, there's not much going on."
"16117670","16119190"," So yeah, I'll do it. "
"16119550","16121290"," I'll cover it as soon as you start going down."
"16166220","16168020"," Okay, so Twitch card."
"16170960","16180660"," Yeah, and Wiki did call it out in chat, too. "
"16180820","16182480"," So I mean, I don't know what else more you want."
"16184260","16188620"," We're here five days a week from 9.30 to at least four every day."
"16190120","16191240"," No breaks, right?"
"16191980","16193260"," You got to take a piss at some point. "
"16193940","16195140"," So I don't know what to say to you."
"16196340","16203800"," I'm assuming, right, that the other, I don't know, outside of those 40 hours, plus the other 20 it"
"16203800","16205320"," takes to be ready for the stream every day."
"16206260","16209100"," That's 60 hours a week, whatever it is, 55 hours. "
"16212900","16215020"," That, you know, I got, sometimes I got to do things."
"16215180","16219020"," I got meetings and phone calls, like professional life, believe it or not."
"16219680","16224220"," I know you've seen me as this person, but I'm sorry, I apologize. "
"16248230","16251230"," I need to watch Las Vegas."
"16259490","16261390"," And I'm still in calls here, too."
"16261590","16265270"," So I don't know what trade you're in, but I'm still sitting in calls here. "
"16265270","16266730"," So that's my, that's my trade."
"16268270","16269050"," So I don't know."
"16269710","16271570"," If they cut those loose, I'll let you know. "
"16284210","16286370"," If though you want a personal stream, let me know."
"16287090","16287710"," Hit me up."
"16288690","16291130"," A hundred bucks, a hundred bucks for an hour or something. "
"16291310","16292650"," I don't know, a thousand bucks a day, 10 hours."
"16292890","16294490"," I'll stream eight hours for a hundred bucks an hour."
"16295690","16296190"," Hit me up with a DM. "
"16297410","16297670"," I'm yours."
"16316760","16317880"," No news right now."
"16320520","16322200"," It's all fed speakers all day long. "
"16327510","16329230"," How do I get this, these tickets?"
"16350970","16353090"," A hotel, official partner."
"16354870","16395619"," I can't"
"16395619","16395980"," buy tickets."
"16396200","16397180"," I don't know if they already sold out, maybe. "
"16407110","16409090"," Shit, I got a, I got a flight there, too."
"16425650","16426590"," Squeeze and I are now."
"16447099","16448540"," I don't see any tickets, man. "
"16448540","16450040"," But they already sell out of them or something."
"16451680","16453540"," I have TwitchCon tickets gone on sale yet."
"16455520","16470900"," It says"
"16470900","16472340"," they're not available for sale yet, okay. "
"16492430","16493610"," Twitch, what does that say?"
"16493770","16500050"," Twitch partner, SLAM platform, we're not offering 50% off TwitchCon tickets."
"16507220","16508259"," How much does it cost?"
"16509200","16510220"," Can't be that expensive, can it?"
"16520140","16522700"," Is it like the same price as going to Burning Man or something?"
"16530990","16534770"," Yeah, man, this is like actually, you know, TwitchCon ticket prices."
"16536710","16538710"," 124 to 289 per night. "
"16539070","16540669"," That's kind of, what's the difference in price?"
"16543529","16544750"," Well, I got to mute this here."
"16550279","16554680"," 2023, stream platform, Twitch, Brain TwitchCon, and the blog posts of the MLB in Las Vegas."
"16556060","16559220"," The event brings streamers, gamers, Twitch doesn't put tickets in sale yet, but they do have prices"
"16559220","16561740"," from last year's event in San Diego. "
"16564200","16566700"," 129, I went up 229 for three days."
"16566720","16568599"," That's kind of cheap, 220 in bucks."
"16569540","16573340"," Or is that you can book room at 20 different hotels, working with event organizers, price range"
"16573340","16574800"," from 124 to 389 per day. "
"16574840","16575419"," That's their cheap."
"16577540","16581640"," It's pretty quickly coming to fire for banning streaming of certain gambling sites, including slots"
"16581640","16583640"," for Latin dice games and art license in the US."
"16588750","16589470"," That's not too bad. "
"16595070","16596689"," I guess I wonder what they offer for that price."
"16596689","16599090"," 128 to 289 a day or a weekend?"
"16606360","16608000"," Yeah, it says they're not available yet, Winky."
"16616550","16617849"," Yeah, are you going to go to the Paris one?"
"16618590","16619349"," You're going to put it on a beret?"
"16620290","16621970"," I'm going to fucking wear a furry costume. "
"16623750","16626590"," I'm going to have to rent a furry costume and show up as a furry or something."
"16628550","16630070"," Like an old furry rocking around?"
"16630270","16631009"," That'd be creepy as fuck."
"16636070","16639169"," No, it's October 20th to October 22nd. "
"16640490","16642529"," It's a good time of year to be in Vegas, believe it or not, right?"
"16642930","16643349"," It's a good time."
"16644130","16646110"," I don't know how many pools are still open in October."
"16647570","16649470"," I used to go in that time of year. "
"16650650","16652210"," I used to go to Vegas in the spring and fall."
"16653009","16654730"," Maybe Joe Donut knows if the pools are open."
"16656930","16660830"," And a quick reversal here in the spy right back down into balance again. "
"16662029","16665349"," Back to the opening price again on the spy."
"16670759","16672880"," We're going to crash everybody by puts right now."
"16675820","16677099"," By puts right now. "
"16677140","16680140"," By puts tons of them load up whole accounts."
"16680619","16682040"," We're going to the depths of hell."
"16691890","16692930"," Abandon ship. "
"16713279","16714320"," Abandon ship."
"16715279","16718220"," It's like a deadspunze out there like max puts."
"16726880","16729000"," Instructions unclear by calls. "
"16748430","16750189"," Sorry, sorry."
"16750189","16753189"," The former U.K.P.M. truss is on a slow day."
"16753490","16766050"," It's a dangerous political show which will do nothing but harm to the U.K. 3200"
"16766050","16767090"," by hit 32. "
"16767270","16772189"," We're going to hit 3200 by 245 or else the crash is called off for today."
"16773070","16774490"," To the tick dot com."
"16774730","16775610"," I will say this though. "
"16775689","16776750"," It's two o'clock in the afternoon."
"16778150","16780070"," Let's start talking about tomorrow."
"16786570","16789310"," So for the past two or three weeks let's be honest here. "
"16789410","16793570"," The past two or three weeks you've been warned by Captain Jim James."
"16796090","16802490"," Well to put a hedge on the market non-stop every day for two or three weeks."

"17439110","17441850"," Now the dealers don't have it priced in right now. "
