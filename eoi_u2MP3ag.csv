"53560","54760"," Check 1-2, baby."
"55000","59480"," Check 1-2."
"59700","61600"," You just want to take a look at that. "
"62460","63660"," I've got this stuff in the background."
"63840","64340"," I've got to do it."
"65620","66960"," Hope you're all doing well out there. "
"75940","78980"," You signed up for Discord and it kicked me out yesterday."
"79360","80120"," K Money's 75."
"80680","81240"," Just give me a second here. "
"94820","96300"," More and how's everybody doing out there?"
"97260","98900"," K Money's 75."
"100220","101340"," So I'll see you a few things."
"102560","104540"," I'm going to mention a few things to you. "
"106480","110080"," So, dude, what is going on?"
"115310","118350"," I've got some walking that's going out with YouTube this morning."
"119630","121450"," And YouTube, definitely."
"123310","124230"," Good morning, everybody. "
"128020","129600"," It's had railroad livestream real quick."
"132280","137560"," So we are opening this morning on the hourly trigger."
"138320","140300"," What is going on with YouTube this morning?"
"143640","146420"," I want to say I get some walking that's going on here in the background. "
"156160","156700"," Okay."
"157860","159440"," I'll check that out in the background."
"159780","160860"," I feel like YouTube, man. "
"161400","162480"," It's like YouTube."
"167110","167630"," Twitch."
"167730","175330"," Well, Twitch, you know, is more stable than YouTube, believe it or not. "
"182030","185550"," I probably go with Twitch being the most stable."
"188310","191510"," And then let's make sure you guys are all here this morning."
"191570","192110"," Good morning, everybody. "
"196450","198530"," Yeah, it's kind of where YouTube has some good stuff."
"198730","199830"," Twitch is the most stable."
"200250","201750"," Streamlabs is not stable. "
"202070","203030"," There's a better version."
"203330","205550"," There's a streamlabs that you can build from scratch."
"207090","208710"," That's stable, but it's like Linux. "
"209090","213130"," It only works for what you want it to do."
"213770","220370"," Now, off this open this morning, before you even open the bell this morning, this is the hourly"
"220370","221190"," trigger right here."
"229220","230860"," I don't know what you guys talking about here. "
"236690","237770"," So this is the hourly trigger."
"247820","250260"," I want to talk to you about the open here."
"250260","253280"," Let's try to get out early so I could do this with you. "
"266630","270970"," So price this morning is above the HD, right?"
"272950","281390"," And we have a bull plane forming"
"281390","284230"," here."
"289500","292460"," Now, coming into the morning, right?"
"294740","300500"," It's kind of like, I guess if you're a bull, you're like, yeah, price can get up here."
"303320","305480"," You should get a confirmation and make our way higher. "
"306120","310780"," I think this lies this morning on the opening bell."
"310880","316360"," It's five minutes left to the open, but you know, if you didn't have this hourly trigger."
"318320","323280"," Your first thought here would be as long as price gets above 4, 2, 7, 10. "
"325320","327100"," We'll likely go up here, right?"
"327360","328000"," It's forming, right?"
"328280","329880"," This looks bullish on the open."
"331020","339040"," Our lead trigger, though, also on its own tells you if price can come up, it'll likely go up."
"340460","342700"," This is where two things are important. "
"343580","350540"," The first one would be the first one would be a velocity."
"350960","359040"," And the second one would be the rules that you have is not doing up here."
"359460","361340"," It doesn't hold on a retest. "
"364560","366320"," So can price action win?"
"367340","367840"," Yes."
"371880","375980"," But this is where you really want to be watching your rules, even if we go up on this bell."
"376440","377040"," This is my point. "
"377580","379080"," Now, I think we're going down on the bell."
"382710","386090"," I think this is a bearish cluster here."
"388310","394170"," But even if we go up on this bell, the rules are there for a reason. "
"394170","401370"," And I think today might be one of those days where it could be a bull trap here."
"402230","409270"," If there's a bull trap here, hopefully we can see it together as a group so that we can discuss"
"409270","409790"," it, right?"
"410470","414950"," These are the pitfalls for most traders without an edge."
"416050","419710"," It works seven times, works six times, works nine times. "
"424590","426670"," And you really need an edge."
"426850","428290"," You need an edge over the market."
"428650","429590"," Very hard to get. "
"429810","430730"," Not an easy thing to get."
"438530","440790"," It doesn't really matter if we go up here."
"441250","448210"," You need to have an edge at all times, whether we go up, whether we go down, you must have"
"448210","448630"," an edge. "
"448630","449430"," It's required."
"449930","453390"," I'll be honest, like 70% of traders are failures."
"455430","461690"," And then in that small group, a bunch of them still blow up accounts every two, three years, four"
"461690","462390"," years, five years. "
"462810","463230"," I've been there."
"465350","468310"," I've blown up accounts, even when I was a good trader."
"468790","471670"," So you're looking for some kind of an edge in here. "
"472810","479030"," And if there's no edge, sometimes you sit on your hands for price action to show you."
"486960","490600"," I see some of my microphone sounds different this morning."
"490860","491140"," It's possible. "
"492780","496960"," I think I've got some weird shit going on in the background of the broadcast."
"499260","504420"," I've got all kinds of stuff happening."
"509620","514960"," I've got technical issues in the background, which are not my fault. "
"515220","521820"," Things I try to work on sometimes that bleed over into a live broadcast."
"522039","523000"," Live broadcasts are weird."
"523400","524700"," You go with what you got. "
"525120","526260"," Sometimes it doesn't even go."
"536970","540050"," Sometimes you all think that I'm just not wanting to come on."
"540050","548310"," But sometimes it's a tweet this out now. "
"558690","568040"," So just on this open this morning, one of the things telling me that we're going down here."
"570880","573200"," I've got the S&P 500's bearish."
"573200","573980"," I agree. "
"575140","578760"," And just on this opening by, you can see us bleeding down below the hourly trigger."
"578920","584640"," Economy growing 5 spots 6% in 2023 and 4 spots 6% in 2024."
"585060","592500"," World Bank sees euro area economy grow up 0 spot 4% in 2023 and 1 spot 3% in"
"592500","593120"," 2024. "
"593720","600040"," And sees the US economy growing 1 spot 1% in 2023 and 0 spot 8% in 2024."
"604700","610400"," And the World Bank says alternative banking stress causing severe credit crunch and advanced"
"610400","615040"," economies slows 2024 global growth to 1 spot 3%."
"615040","620200"," So if you're just joining us, we just just pop it in the broadcast right now before the opening"
"620200","620440"," bell. "
"621600","625380"," I was discussing a trainer's edge price action edge."
"625380","631740"," The World Bank says the drag on growth from monetary tightening will peak in 2023 and made your"
"631740","634760"," economies, but will persist into 2024."
"636100","637460"," How do you get that edge?"
"638540","643060"," It was looking like a bull plane here, right?"
"643940","644620"," Before the open. "
"647910","653630"," If price in a bed of bull is sitting on this open before the open saying, you know, price can"
"653630","654390"," just get up here."
"656150","657170"," We're going to go up."
"658610","662250"," But that you need an edge over this, right?"
"664370","668090"," You've got a bull cluster forming here, but in reality, it's a bear cluster. "
"670790","672130"," And so you've got the trigger."
"672310","673130"," You get the hourly trigger."
"673270","676570"," So first you've got just the two lines, then you've got the hourly trigger. "
"678470","679950"," So you have that piece of information."
"680270","682030"," The last piece of information would be velocity."
"683330","685510"," And velocity is telling you it's down, not up. "
"686690","688530"," And you need an edge as a trader."
"688870","690310"," You need an edge as a price action trader."
"690610","693390"," If you don't have, if you don't know what the velocity is, if you don't know what the hourly"
"693390","696130"," trigger is, here's a bull trap, right?"
"696130","697830"," Right on this opening bell this morning. "
"700650","703470"," And so that was the point we were making before the broadcast began."
"704790","709450"," We can see we're bleeding down now trading 42611 right off that opening bell."
"712600","715160"," So you have to have this as a trader. "
"716080","718140"," Whatever that edge is, you have to have it."
"719460","722820"," You don't want to be slamming the call by the call button on the opening bell."
"723820","727480"," When something else is telling you, fuck, no, we're going to sell that bell guaranteed. "
"733120","734620"," Terribly compressed, my mic."
"737260","745580"," Let me check my, yeah, I figured my, I was having problems getting on here this morning."
"755160","756840"," Let me try that and see if that's better. "
"757740","758620"," Is that better?"
"760460","764410"," I just reset the mic."
"767350","768770"," Yeah, I just reset the microphone."
"769550","772310"," I'm having technical issues in the background this morning to get on air. "
"773650","774410"," I've got YouTube."
"775830","778490"," By the way, if you're out there watching right now, everybody can comment."
"778770","780310"," So I got issues with YouTube this morning. "
"782570","785650"," If you're not a member, you have a free day of commenting."
"788650","790550"," It's kind of kind of ironic, right?"
"790650","795050"," It's always on these days when the bears come inside the chat."
"798850","802770"," Now someone did text this morning or commented this morning. "
"802770","808210"," They said that they were kicked out of discord yesterday."
"808370","811990"," So if you're joining discord, I have a few things to let you know."
"811990","817050"," And it's almost always these three issues. "
"817530","819090"," I'm going to give you the three issues right now."
"820170","824790"," First issue is going to be."
"827150","830230"," You have to confirm, I believe in email address. "
"831850","834550"," And that's the keep spam and bots out of the discord."
"834650","836270"," So it's like a confirmation process."
"837010","840750"," Second issue is you using a VPN. "
"840750","845530"," Discord is stopping people from using VPNs these days."
"845750","850350"," So VPN not doing an authentication process will be number two."
"850810","855910"," And number three is not signing, reading and signing the rules for the discord. "
"857030","863510"," If you've done all those three things, send me an email with your username."
"865410","867290"," And I will look into it."
"868390","873710"," There are I found out that there are some other blanket bands. "
"874870","877210"," Perma bands inside of discord."
"879610","884490"," I think from my understanding, those permanent bands are because of some nefarious shit."
"886370","889970"," So if you send me your name, I'll look at the reasoning while you were banned. "
"890230","891430"," And if you want, we can discuss it."
"895460","905460"," Once we monetize it, any of those bots or spammers, scammers can pay to be back"
"905460","906100"," inside the discord."
"907860","909460"," I don't think that they'll choose to. "
"909740","913340"," So that's just a programming note or discord specifically."
"913980","917640"," If you have done those three things, you're not in the, and you're not allowed in the discord."
"918400","921360"," Just send me an email and I'll look into it with the admins and mods. "
"926650","930230"," If you're just joining us, you should go back to the beginning of the program."
"930790","931850"," Play the live stream."
"932970","937310"," Like fast forward at two time, 2.5 times speed so you can catch up with us. "
"942320","945300"," And know where we are this morning."
"945860","949760"," Coming down into that 224, 225 that we're looking for."
"951000","953560"," Hopefully you can get this for this 425 today. "
"953620","955280"," We're trying to, trying to tag this."
"956020","960180"," Talked about next, I think we set up a set it on Twitter yesterday to next stop 425."
"961360","967380"," I think yesterday we also said look for a place to grab some liquidity to go lower. "
"971420","972960"," And bears want."
"974060","977040"," For the end of this week, bears want, if they can."
"978940","982940"," To get down here, close this gap down here at 421. "
"982940","988790"," I do want you to be aware of."
"993590","994110"," 423."
"998650","999690"," 423 43. "
"1002630","1003770"," Somewhere down in here."
"1005930","1008070"," To be your next stop after that 425."
"1009130","1009610"," This has one. "
"1010690","1012290"," You want to look for this down here."
"1012830","1014750"," This is the channel that we're trading."
"1014750","1020510"," And then ultimately to get down and tag the daily. "
"1022070","1025750"," Currently sitting at 416 90 or so."
"1029109","1031210"," Come up, it's going to continue to come up."
"1032609","1036369"," This takes into Wednesday to that 418 price target. "
"1036670","1037890"," Somewhere down in here."
"1037890","1062110"," Are you"
"1062110","1062930"," all doing to this morning?"
"1063070","1063350"," Good morning."
"1065470","1066830"," Everybody doing well today?"
"1068050","1069290"," It's a five minute chart. "
"1072370","1072930"," Nice."
"1074910","1076730"," Bear playing here off the open."
"1112540","1115080"," Left a small gap behind right here. "
"1115260","1116300"," So I'm going to see this here."
"1117660","1118520"," Remember this."
"1118520","1129720"," This is also a"
"1129720","1133620"," pre market gap right here being left behind. "
"1140800","1142020"," You all doing well this morning?"
"1143120","1143700"," Doing good."
"1144140","1146620"," Having a chance to read DMS. I went through a bunch. "
"1146820","1148220"," I will try to go through DMS last night."
"1149540","1150400"," I've got 100."
"1150480","1152480"," I've probably got 100 of them, so I've got to go through them. "
"1152860","1154780"," So I apologize if I haven't responded to you."
"1156500","1158680"," I passed out yesterday after the stream."
"1158680","1161360"," I had some like I made some dinner. "
"1161600","1163040"," I was going to suppose as well last night."
"1163160","1167400"," I'm like tired and I had like a sun stroke."
"1167460","1169920"," I think from the weekend just like kick right in on me. "
"1170480","1171760"," Legs were hurting me everything."
"1171760","1174540"," It was like delayed reaction over the weekend."
"1193260","1195180"," See you guys are saying in the chat this morning. "
"1195360","1195760"," Morning Thomas."
"1196020","1196340"," How are you?"
"1196340","1196940"," Thomas."
"1210300","1218980"," Yeah, I've got a price target on IWM of 196 by the 28th of June. "
"1228150","1232030"," Just some guy to find me on Twitch."
"1233250","1236070"," See if I can find you on Twitch."
"1236330","1250760"," Yeah, at"
"1250760","1253700"," least if you're on YouTube today, you get a free chat day. "
"1258500","1258980"," See."
"1260840","1262100"," Mike is not rockstar."
"1262280","1265640"," Yeah, my mic was squeezing higher now. "
"1266220","1269400"," Bears want to sell this right here."
"1273750","1275430"," That white box is there for."
"1277270","1282890"," Top of the morning Frank. "
"1283110","1283350"," How are you?"
"1284510","1285270"," Sugar's good morning."
"1287310","1287550"," Yeah."
"1287690","1288450"," Okay, money 75. "
"1288770","1289390"," See what you can do."
"1290090","1290970"," Check those three things."
"1291150","1295270"," If that doesn't work, shoot me an email at captain James at gmail.com."
"1296770","1297890"," How do you become members?"
"1298330","1299410"," You guys should be able to chat. "
"1299630","1305870"," So this morning specifically, I'm having technical issues in the background with YouTube with"
"1305870","1307730"," microphones, all kinds of nonsense."
"1311880","1314000"," How low on book back should we go?"
"1314580","1316480"," You guys know I've already got targets down below."
"1316680","1320580"," I got first target from yesterday into today was 425. "
"1321040","1323280"," We're pretty close to that."
"1323280","1325100"," So I'd like to see if we can get that 425."
"1325720","1327320"," Then I got some 424 numbers. "
"1328620","1330800"," And then hopefully we can get down to like 480."
"1331900","1332760"," We're into the week."
"1341610","1342990"," Winky's texting me in the background. "
"1344810","1346010"," Are you winning son?"
"1351370","1352590"," Good morning, Winky."
"1352950","1355630"," If you're listening in right now, anywhere out there around the world."
"1356450","1357350"," Good morning, brother. "
"1364920","1365500"," Hey, Nicholas."
"1365740","1366100"," How are you?"
"1366680","1369160"," YouTuber Ahmad blocked me from commenting on my other account."
"1369400","1370020"," Just wanted to say hi. "
"1370260","1370580"," Hey, Nicholas."
"1370800","1371020"," How are you?"
"1371300","1373180"," I'll check and see what's going on with that, Nicholas."
"1377280","1379080"," Nicholas, were you saying anything in the chat?"
"1379260","1380440"," Maybe that caused that?"
"1381600","1382740"," Counter alpha, maybe?"
"1383400","1383720"," I don't know. "
"1386220","1387400"," I'll try to get you unbanned."
"1388000","1390380"," They may have banned you for counter alpha."
"1390760","1391720"," So I'll take a look. "
"1392800","1394000"," You know, he's got another chance."
"1394600","1396480"," Fuck up again, ban you again."
"1404460","1406120"," Let me close this here. "
"1407060","1408180"," Let me take a look at Nicholas."
"1409480","1411220"," Nicholas, was that on Twitch, maybe?"
"1414380","1416660"," I'm worried about 420 puts on the seventh."
"1417560","1418300"," There should be. "
"1418460","1420860"," We've got a, we'll take a look at something cool this morning."
"1422940","1424420"," There's like a market pin."
"1425300","1427540"," Well, it's not, you know, the dirt. "
"1427540","1428020"," All right."
"1428220","1432260"," So there is like a put call ratio that's like a pinning-ish."
"1433100","1434060"," For June. "
"1435120","1437340"," And then it drops off."
"1437640","1439760"," I think later this week it drops down."
"1441280","1442320"," We'll look at it. "
"1442440","1444080"," And then into end of month."
"1445280","1447660"," There's another window of week this."
"1448140","1449040"," It's not that week though. "
"1449460","1450920"," It's like four or five or seven."
"1455090","1459530"," So we'll look at the."
"1459530","1464230"," Oh, dude, I got this warm coffee in my hands. "
"1464450","1465010"," It feels so good."
"1465130","1465770"," My hands are in pain."
"1475360","1477300"," It's the max pain for the market. "
"1477880","1479220"," I was in a switch from over to the desk."
"1479380","1480800"," I was not allowed to reach out to us."
"1480860","1481600"," Where if you ban me. "
"1482500","1485280"," I was in one switch from mobile to desktop version."
"1485500","1486600"," I was not allowed to reach out to us."
"1486740","1489520"," Where if you ban me, let me write some names down. "
"1489700","1489880"," You know what?"
"1490000","1491420"," Send me an email on Andre."
"1491620","1493520"," Send me an email on captain James."
"1501960","1502940"," I'll do that today actually. "
"1502940","1506080"," I'll go through and check every name and give you guys answers as to what's up."
"1506840","1507520"," Fire band."
"1522720","1525980"," See what else you guys say and kept cutting pace there in today's test levels. "
"1527000","1527440"," Oh yeah."
"1527620","1527720"," Okay."
"1527940","1528400"," I'll go on. "
"1528980","1530380"," Let me see if I can get that updated for you."
"1530520","1530980"," I think that one second."
"1573880","1574600"," All right. "
"1574600","1577020"," Test the levels should be back up for you here in a moment."
"1585640","1586700"," That doesn't matter."
"1586840","1587140"," Sweet. "
"1587440","1588960"," I wouldn't take it as a."
"1590700","1592220"," Someone said I didn't bring the ban hammer."
"1593060","1598000"," I think all the mods and the admin and myself included will bring the ban hammer."
"1598340","1600060"," If you commit, I'll be honest with you. "
"1600080","1606580"," If you commit inside this stream and you're fueling counter alpha, you will get the ban hammer."
"1606580","1609120"," It's not a bad thing."
"1610240","1618480"," If you catch a ban hammer, it's not permanent unless it's something really bad, right?"
"1618840","1625440"," Like, I don't know, like something like, you know, you know the words, right?"
"1625980","1627800"," That'll get your permanent ban anywhere you go. "
"1628500","1629740"," Things you can't say."
"1630720","1631980"," Really bad words."
"1633020","1635580"," If you make a mistake, that's fine. "
"1635580","1638640"," But if you're, you know, if you know, if you're that person, right?"
"1639340","1642020"," If you don't know, then your ban stands."
"1643200","1650740"," There's an aspect to counter alpha that if you're banned for that, you'll be unbanned."
"1651580","1652520"," There's another thing too. "
"1652680","1654120"," There's one more and that is."
"1656160","1661000"," You know, you know, somebody's buttons and you just ride them intentionally."
"1661440","1664200"," All these mods and admins, all these people that make this happen. "
"1664780","1665920"," They work their ass off."
"1666680","1672380"," And if you know that you can do that to them, either upset them or you're not listening to their"
"1672380","1679060"," instructions continuously or you're continuously just giving bad alpha while we're trying to."
"1679140","1680620"," This is a serious thing we're doing here, right?"
"1680740","1681520"," We're all trying to make money. "
"1682040","1683500"," We have real money in the line."
"1684640","1689260"," It would kind of be like me at work all day long and you just being at the corner."
"1690480","1692600"," Not trying to stop me from doing my job, right?"
"1693620","1697140"," So if you catch a ban, it could be my mistake. "
"1697820","1703880"," If you catch a ban for a reason that you likely know, or if you don't know, don't take it"
"1703880","1704280"," as a negative."
"1704440","1708240"," Just say, okay, what do I do to, to follow the rules, right?"
"1709460","1712620"," So we try to give undo bans in the future."
"1712800","1715800"," So you'll, you'll, you'll get a reprieve at some point. "
"1716960","1720880"," If you do it two, three, four times and you didn't, you didn't get the idea."
"1720880","1722740"," This might not be the place for you."
"1724540","1726360"," It was a pretty serious thing that we're doing. "
"1726500","1730920"," I mean, I know we took around and shit posts and all that kind of stuff and that's all fun."
"1731120","1735220"," We all like, like, chairing on when you're winning, whether we're going up or down."
"1735880","1738300"," But there are moments in the market where you can lose your ass. "
"1739220","1751600"," There have been moments in this market where we're selling into a close and you'll see a"
"1751600","1756280"," prime example here is, this is funny because this isn't actually protecting bulls."
"1758060","1759840"," This can seem kind of weird."
"1761020","1763680"," We can be selling hard and heavy into a close. "
"1764400","1770260"," And the last, the last big example that we had, we were selling hard and heavy into a close."
"1770960","1774820"," And I had asked people if they were closing their shorts and long puts."
"1775520","1781280"," And I was asking because that was the place to take profit. "
"1782180","1790440"," I was asking you so that I was asking you because in the heat of the moment in the excitement,"
"1791520","1799680"," trying to teach you how to not be emotional, take the money, book profit, and even if we were to"
"1799680","1806160"," continue to go down to re-enter that trade, re-negotiate that trade once again because we're at"
"1806160","1807800"," known levels to take profit."
"1809080","1818880"," And one specific day, as that was happening, the stream chat was being overrun by comments of more"
"1818880","1819740"," down to come."
"1821100","1829600"," Now, those people are usually likely either have small accounts, entered the trade too late,"
"1830180","1832840"," or are not good traders. "
"1834780","1842780"," So that day specifically that this, I think last time we were giving out bans was or major bans or"
"1842780","1851800"," switching to a membership style is due to, and then we get hit and run people too that kind of"
"1851800","1852500"," stoked that fire."
"1852500","1859380"," Not any of you here, but we get people from like, they just find the stream on YouTube and they"
"1859380","1860680"," want to place the ship host, right?"
"1860780","1861140"," I get that."
"1862680","1871120"," But then they provide more counter-alpha and fuel that intensity of, yeah, we must be crashing here"
"1871120","1872960"," or something, or even going down more tomorrow. "
"1873760","1875240"," You know, it's like Bud from Wall Street."
"1875700","1877600"," If you chase the hole, you become the hole."
"1878720","1880580"," So this is real money. "
"1881040","1882900"," It's not funny."
"1883020","1889640"," It's ironic that that was the day where I'm trying to help a bear or a seller to book profit."
"1891220","1896220"," And the following day is the day when the market that opened, we never looked back. "
"1896400","1897720"," We literally went straight up."
"1899600","1902460"," And a lot of sellers got hurt in that trade."
"1904000","1907260"," They were right in the move down and then they drank the Kool-Aid on the close. "
"1907760","1910300"," I haven't talked about this too much, so it's good time to talk about it."
"1912000","1915920"," And I know I get a lot of grief from sellers and bears out on Fintuit."
"1917400","1926000"," But the truth is that I'm trying to help a seller to not be emotional in the moment, to take"
"1926000","1927520"," the money when they're supposed to. "
"1928100","1932940"," If there is continued down, they can execute that trade in futures or in the following day."
"1935520","1941980"," And so if we're in chat and you get a block or a ban or something, you're likely contributing to"
"1941980","1944540"," some form of counter-alpha to the chat."
"1946460","1951460"," Or you're constantly asking questions or airing dirty laundry that's inappropriate. "
"1951900","1953380"," You can always send me an email, that kind of stuff."
"1955640","1958180"," Or nagging on something that you already know the reason for."
"1958680","1961860"," Even if you're not going to admit it, that's what it is. "
"1962280","1965520"," Now, sometimes you can't get in because of technical issues, right?"
"1967760","1970560"," VPNs didn't read the rules, something like that."
"1970760","1971800"," We can work on that always."
"1972140","1976220"," If you catch a ban, we do give reprieves over time. "
"1976640","1978420"," We do want you to realize why we're here."
"1979300","1980840"," And I don't dislike any of you out there."
"1980920","1984640"," If any of you are listening right now and you caught a ban, I have no ill will towards you. "
"1984780","1986940"," I don't like that person and any of that kind of stuff."
"1987560","1988280"," It's just important."
"1988900","1989640"," This is real money. "
"1989940","1991680"," I mean, this isn't a joke, right?"
"1991960","1992880"," This isn't 500 bucks."
"1993600","1997360"," I want you to know out there that most of the people that trade here have been trading with for"
"1997360","1997920"," a long time."
"1999100","2006260"," They all have professional jobs or are wealthy and retired and make their money from what they do. "
"2006780","2008900"," A large percentage of people here."
"2009120","2012640"," For an forecast for 2023 at $80 a barrel."
"2013600","2015700"," So we have to keep it like that. "
"2015720","2016440"," It's very important."
"2017820","2022620"," In this cool places for that stuff, like Wall Street Bets has its own parameters."
"2023540","2024920"," Stock to its has its own parameters. "
"2025980","2030240"," Fin to it has its own parameters and time frames where you can ship boats and be serious."
"2031260","2036580"," You know, it's like every place you go, some discords might not, like my discord might not be meant"
"2036580","2037120"," for you."
"2038020","2045260"," I've been in many discords and they all have their own They all have their own flavor and feeling"
"2045260","2045880"," to them. "
"2046340","2049179"," They could all change to their flavors and feelings and what they are."
"2049860","2053920"," But for me, for what I'm doing and what I'm trying to do, I'm not trying to blow up my"
"2053920","2054179"," account."
"2055300","2055820"," I see. "
"2056060","2057900"," So I don't want you to think I'm mad."
"2058060","2059159"," I'm happy this morning."
"2059199","2060380"," I don't want to think I'm mad at you either. "
"2060900","2065260"," If you want to, if you have an issue with getting in discord or your band or something."
"2065820","2066420"," Just send me an email."
"2066659","2066800"," Why?"
"2067460","2068639"," I assure you something though. "
"2068639","2071100"," It's like mommy and daddy and telephone, right?"
"2071380","2078239"," There's no like, it's not like I unbanned you and then some other mod says why ban them for this"
"2078239","2078460"," reason."
"2078460","2082880"," We go back and talk about each and every one of you and that kind of stuff."
"2083080","2087699"," Okay, so I want to make sure that you don't think that you're going to like, I don't know, talk"
"2087699","2090920"," to one mod and then talk to me and that kind of stuff either. "
"2100260","2102480"," Does that help that answers all of your questions?"
"2107010","2109750"," Yeah, John Hagerty is saying I've never been a band."
"2110210","2113530"," I've never been anyone for expressing going up going down opinions ever."
"2114010","2115270"," Yeah, I don't think that it's. "
"2117310","2120210"," I don't think that it's expressing your opinion either."
"2120570","2123310"," You got, I think you guys know what I think."
"2123690","2125090"," I think it's pretty clear. "
"2125790","2131670"," Uh, I think you got, I think y'all know, I think like, yeah, we all have friends."
"2131670","2136510"," We all have business or school relationships that we've had."
"2138190","2139950"," And you know, everybody is, right?"
"2140130","2142630"," That all kind of rolls over into what we're doing here. "
"2150740","2154900"," And the other point here too is as we grow, right?"
"2155200","2155700"," This is the truth."
"2155820","2159120"," As we grow, we're going to get overrun."
"2160080","2160680"," It happens. "
"2161300","2170500"," They have, they have a informational things for me to read and watch on YouTube, Twitch, on Discord"
"2170500","2171700"," that talk about it, right?"
"2171980","2179240"," So if I own a Discord channel, they're like, hey, you got to watch out for these pitfalls, YouTube,"
"2179240","2182340"," Twitch, all show me in the background of this show."
"2182660","2185760"," They're like, you got too many people in the chat and stuff."
"2186000","2188480"," And you know, you know, some people you don't know everybody. "
"2188860","2191520"," Some you know a little bit, some you've known a long time."
"2191900","2193640"," And then you get overrun with comments."
"2193640","2198480"," This isn't directed at you, anyone here in the stream that's been here for a while, even a month. "
"2199740","2202980"," This is like, we have our, let's say we have our core group."
"2203880","2206680"," And then we get a major emotional move either up or down."
"2207440","2210980"," And I'm just some rando that doesn't know this show at all. "
"2212240","2216240"," And I find it and it's on, you know, YouTube's algorithm is like, we're going to put this out here"
"2216240","2218080"," right now because everyone's searching for it."
"2218740","2223020"," And then people pop into the stream and they're like, keyboard warrior slamming, right?"
"2223900","2224220"," Yeah."
"2225740","2226800"," So it's not, it's not you guys. "
"2227680","2228860"," Yeah, mommy daddy stuff."
"2231340","2231660"," Yeah."
"2233680","2234560"," That's how you make a living. "
"2234860","2235640"," This is how I make my living."
"2235900","2240340"," This is, I don't make my living from, from donation."
"2240900","2241840"," I mean, you got to love the donations. "
"2242000","2242940"," They make me feel great."
"2244060","2245400"," If I'm doing a good or bad job."
"2245580","2247940"," It's a nice fellow other, but I don't make my living that way. "
"2248000","2249320"," I make my living from trading for a living."
"2249320","2258120"," So, you know, it's, I think there's a part of this day where like we're in live market hours."
"2259560","2261760"," We're in live, we're in the live market right now. "
"2262100","2263620"," We're live streaming and the market was closed."
"2264480","2265940"," We should post all day long, right?"
"2266180","2267020"," We could do that all day long."
"2267660","2271920"," This is the time of the day where we take the market very seriously and it's important. "
"2273100","2273600"," Hey, last one zone."
"2273780","2273960"," How are you?"
"2274800","2275200"," Okay."
"2275380","2276200"," So we're off that. "
"2277020","2285740"," Now, what is an example of good and bad alpha?"
"2287780","2294180"," I think, you know, what you should do is, what you should do is go back to, you know, a"
"2294180","2295300"," great one for you would be."
"2295520","2297160"," It's a great, great, great question."
"2301380","2302040"," Right here. "
"2302180","2302820"," I got one for you."
"2305260","2311820"," Go back to, um, go back to the video that live stream that I had on May 16th."
"2313260","2314120"," One minute remaining. "
"2315100","2315820"," On May 16th."
"2320240","2321920"," Go back to my video on May 16th."
"2324120","2329640"," And as we were coming down here, the last, uh, watch the last hour of the show. "
"2330240","2333820"," And this should give you a, should give you a clear as day answer."
"2336500","2340760"," And you'll see the cool, calm, collected traders in this stream."
"2340760","2346220"," And you'll see the stream also being overrun, uh, by counter alpha. "
"2346240","2348920"," You'll see the people that are getting in here, taking profit and running."
"2349540","2356280"," And you'll see a substantial part of the chat."
"2357200","2358300"," That rode this. "
"2360560","2365000"," Hard and heavy due to being overrun by the chat."
"2365980","2366980"," Uh, short."
"2368020","2370220"," This cleaned out this day right here. "
"2372540","2375740"," Cleaned out a significant portion of into it."
"2376180","2381920"," Like thousands of people, not just my followers, but I'm talking about."
"2382480","2382880"," Into it. "
"2383840","2385840"," And we need to be better than fit into it."
"2385940","2387220"," We need to be better than Wall Street bets."
"2387920","2389780"," Be better than stock twits. "
"2390160","2392440"," Be better than everything you read out there."
"2392840","2394460"," All the news you read."
"2395220","2397040"," Better than whatever you see on CNBC. "
"2397220","2399000"," Like that's how good we're trying to be."
"2400980","2402920"," That's the standard I hold myself to."
"2403120","2404840"," I fail, but that's my standard. "
"2406500","2409720"," So this would be a day for you to go back and watch the last hour of the stream."
"2412360","2416900"," And look to see who was a surgeon down here as we got down into the last hour and who"
"2416900","2417300"," was not."
"2417300","2426000"," And so there's there's there's things that we have to do in the background to make sure that we're"
"2426000","2427520"," getting the real voice. "
"2427800","2430700"," So I need the voice that was wrapping up their short."
"2432040","2434940"," And either staying flat or going long."
"2435820","2437300"," Into this close to be heard. "
"2438420","2439860"," And I need weight given to those people."
"2440460","2441320"," I have to."
"2442640","2445580"," Because this here was a very difficult trade. "
"2445620","2447140"," This was not an easy thing."
"2449140","2450520"," That right here."
"2450680","2452700"," This was this is how you identify a good trader. "
"2453360","2454040"," I'll be honest with you."
"2454840","2462620"," I remember this close and I remember the counter alpha and that was out there across the news,"
"2463060","2463720"," social media."
"2465720","2467020"," Print media didn't matter. "
"2469020","2470460"," Good question, by the way."
"2471320","2473360"," And you can see where we went after, right?"
"2475240","2479680"," We destroyed and even down here on this day was another day."
"2480420","2483040"," This one wasn't so bad though in the stream in the chat. "
"2484160","2486340"," You can see where we went after that, right?"
"2488280","2489480"," Pretty gnarly, right?"
"2498110","2500130"," People be like, oh, he doesn't like sellers."
"2500390","2501270"," And I'm like, I love sellers."
"2501270","2502830"," We got no problems with sellers. "
"2506730","2508810"," We have a gap above that needs to be closed."
"2510150","2513350"," What are my thoughts on where we are?"
"2513470","2518150"," Another question was asked in the chat this morning was, what do I think about where we are right"
"2518150","2518350"," now?"
"2518430","2519510"," It's another good question."
"2520930","2523950"," So this hourly trigger is like a magnet right now, right?"
"2539500","2543580"," I was noting in stream yesterday that yesterday that I did not see. "
"2543580","2545560"," We report on the feed for all those interested."
"2547660","2549640"," Watch this gap up here, okay?"
"2566330","2575770"," I noted in, I noted before the open yesterday for that upper and lower range"
"2575770","2577470"," for us to be range bound."
"2578450","2583130"," We should squeeze up there and close that gap, by the way, or at least attempt to 42726. "
"2592900","2595320"," I made a note yesterday that we weren't seeing."
"2595320","2603280"," I was impressed with the loss of these decline without price following."
"2603920","2607340"," And in the overnight, I was also impressed with this here. "
"2608900","2612820"," That's kind of what I'm looking for to buy a dip is getting down here."
"2614900","2616920"," And we just tagged here."
"2619010","2620640"," I just had to bearish alerts. "
"2621160","2624700"," Normally, so we'll get a neutral alert, a bearish alert."
"2625320","2626860"," An extreme bearish alert."
"2629260","2631880"," And this morning I got, you heard it beeping in the background. "
"2633780","2635300"," I caught an alert for bearish."
"2636700","2637740"," Right down here."
"2639880","2646340"," Should signify a relief rally, even if it's a small relief rally to the upside. "
"2646960","2648200"," So we're going to look for here."
"2660510","2663590"," As if sellers are still in charge or not."
"2671530","2673630"," You can see the sellers here, right?"
"2673890","2675030"," You can see the sellers here. "
"2676030","2681370"," We want to see a move higher, confirming on the hourly trigger."
"2682230","2683570"," Close these gaps up here."
"2685530","2688690"," If we don't see this play out, we can't take the trade higher. "
"2691150","2692630"," So no trade right now."
"2693910","2695770"," You know that sellers are right here."
"2696110","2698210"," They want to revenge trade this all the way down. "
"2698210","2708190"," I personally want to see us go down to at least $4.24. But if price action points the"
"2708190","2709650"," way higher, we'll take that trade."
"2712930","2720090"," Normally get a little bit of a reprieve here in between the real first targets like $4.25, $4.24."
"2721270","2721970"," Somewhere in there."
"2723630","2726510"," We should get a relief rally and then we'll make the next roll down if we can. "
"2743560","2745120"," You hear those by fire alarm?"
"2745120","2745840"," No, that's an alarm."
"2746600","2752440"," So I've got an alert that says, so this would be like neutral."
"2755060","2756180"," A bullish. "
"2759800","2760940"," Extreme bullish."
"2765650","2767270"," And I got a bear."
"2772600","2773900"," An extreme bear. "
"2781170","2784070"," Now as price goes up, follow my cursor right here."
"2785030","2786630"," We'll get a crossover that's neutral."
"2787190","2788930"," Price goes down, crossover that's neutral. "
"2790390","2792970"," Normally when we're going up, we'll become bullish."
"2794850","2798170"," Get a down move and then we go up there and hit that extreme bullishness."
"2799250","2799510"," Okay. "
"2800570","2802990"," On the way back down, we'll come back down, right?"
"2803390","2804750"," So up here is when you're taking profit."
"2806130","2807570"," Start to head back down again."
"2808610","2809130"," Two bullish. "
"2810470","2811930"," Then down a neutral, right?"
"2813670","2814950"," Then down to bearish."
"2815290","2815890"," You get a bounce."
"2816410","2817550"," That's where we are right now. "
"2818970","2820070"," It's the bearish bounce."
"2821430","2824990"," Bears want to get back down there and hit that extreme bearishness."
"2826430","2827310"," We're getting close. "
"2829610","2831510"," So right now you should see this bounce."
"2833090","2834850"," You're watching the cross take place."
"2834870","2837470"," We're going to look for confirmation trade to the upside. "
"2842260","2845960"," You guys are going to get those alerts as part of the package."
"2845960","2851280"," You're going to get extreme bullishness, extreme bearishness, take profit."
"2852200","2856540"," Look for another leg down of price action shows you that we're not going back down. "
"2856680","2858180"," We're just going to blast faces off."
"2869720","2873860"," When it's extreme bullishness, it's time to look."
"2874180","2876540"," I'm going to be key here in the phrasing awarding. "
"2877580","2881440"," It's time to look for a place to take profit."
"2882200","2890740"," Time to look for a place, take profit, and look for a place to position to the downside."
"2892120","2896180"," Any extreme on either of those two, and it's time to take the money and run. "
"2897100","2901880"," Time to certainly begin to look for a short position of some kind."
"2902720","2909180"," On the extreme bearishness, it's time to start wrapping it up on the short side or a long put side."
"2910740","2914780"," And then the neutral is more of like neutral and crossover. "
"2915460","2918600"," Like are we crossing over to bearishness, crossing over to bullishness?"
"2920200","2923640"," You'll oftentimes see a pause in the market around that time as well."
"2932290","2934010"," All this stuff's been back tested."
"2936690","2941250"," Starting to clean out all that gapage up there. "
"2947100","2949720"," The call side, this is where you take the money and run."
"2960070","2962230"," You might get a few more ticks off that."
"2965350","2976290"," You're going to be looking for some kind"
"2976290","2977090"," of a recheck. "
"2977330","2985610"," Could be off this 427.2. And then if the recheck is good, we'll make our way higher."
"3010070","3012030"," Yeah, Apple should come down to like 175."
"3013770","3014690"," We should rotate. "
"3016990","3022370"," Spy should hold up your ladies and gents for tomorrow at 10 a.m. Eastern time."
"3022510","3027770"," We do have the bank of candle cleaning up the end of that gap right there at 427.50. We'll"
"3027770","3030730"," be going through a nice little high right there."
"3031730","3036330"," That live stream link is on the financial use news feed to watch completely free. "
"3036730","3038830"," Don't forget to share with your fellow traders and friends."
"3039490","3042210"," That was a great, great price action today."
"3052850","3055470"," We will look at the scene of the crime. "
"3067510","3068490"," Here's part of it."
"3069570","3070450"," 428 flat."
"3072150","3073930"," Here's another part of it, R1. "
"3074930","3076430"," There's another part of it right here."
"3104750","3106290"," Hey, Michael Lopez, how are you?"
"3115120","3116780"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"3116900","3117480"," Y'all doing well?"
"3126140","3129260"," Three trigger blue bull cluster forming."
"3134510","3144350"," Bull's looking for a larger move higher for a relief rally on the bearish signal we got on hourly"
"3144350","3144990"," velocity. "
"3151570","3152950"," You doing well, Michael?"
"3153530","3154170"," Good to see you, man."
"3157410","3162950"," Well, it's like the spy is the hard one to spy can rotate, man."
"3164330","3169090"," In a low-val market, spy is a hard one. "
"3169330","3175290"," You need big volatility to start making huge runs down on the S&P 500."
"3177010","3181510"," You can rotate out of these big tech names and into DIA."
"3181510","3186030"," You can rotate in other sectors in the spy. "
"3186630","3188610"," You can rotate into small caps, mid caps."
"3191190","3193890"," Communication services are booming right now."
"3194990","3196890"," That's a big part of NASDAQ as well. "
"3202270","3204090"," Michael Lopez, you know that, right?"
"3204410","3205590"," If you get a clean bounce here."
"3207750","3213530"," If you catch a clean bounce here, it's going to be a trend day, actually."
"3215610","3217850"," You just need to see if you can catch a clean bounce here. "
"3222140","3224020"," Some of y'all know this stuff they can tell."
"3226140","3227860"," Some of you do and some of you don't."
"3227960","3229540"," You're just looking for that nice clean bounce. "
"3230620","3232580"," We'll show it to you on a five-minute chart, too."
"3234360","3237780"," I always like looking for it in a five-minute chart."
"3238300","3239180"," It's right here. "
"3239940","3241600"," It's a five-minute chart that we're showing now."
"3244340","3248000"," What you're looking for here, if you're a bull, or even a bear, it doesn't matter."
"3257160","3258700"," Looking for that right there. "
"3265280","3267160"," You're looking for this to hold, right?"
"3267320","3272100"," We get the algorithms trying to close gaps, trying to hit every pivot, right?"
"3272320","3274040"," Pivot up, pivot down, pivot up, pivot down."
"3275080","3279100"," That 426 down here was a futures low."
"3280300","3284000"," We just want to see all this, and this would confirm. "
"3284420","3289280"," We trade the 21 or 27 EMA, whatever it is you use."
"3291180","3293780"," To confirm a larger move to the upside."
"3314940","3315840"," Yeah, Michael. "
"3317860","3320060"," Let's look at Apple real quick."
"3323700","3325540"," I'd really like to see Apple hit."
"3325540","3330280"," I think 175 right there if we could. "
"3334880","3344540"," If it breaks 175 and continues to hold below 175, next target will be roughly"
"3344540","3345360"," 165."
"3347060","3349880"," I don't know that I see that, but that's still up trend for Apple anyways."
"3350240","3353780"," Apple could go to 165 and still be in trend mode. "
"3354840","3356360"," It was crazy."
"3366780","3368360"," Yeah, I'm watching Russell in the background."
"3368740","3370300"," I just closed some calls on Russell. "
"3374750","3377030"," My call, I had to, so on Friday."
"3379850","3383470"," I said I've had some, it's a large position in IWM."
"3388030","3390130"," And as a matter of fact, we'll show it right here. "
"3391370","3392450"," I haven't even done anything."
"3394370","3397650"," I think we, I think we talked about this here the other day."
"3398750","3403450"," This is the Russell here. "
"3406690","3407490"," Squeeze an hour."
"3411190","3414230"," My only issue here is time is not on my side."
"3425300","3427380"," Just getting started right now, right?"
"3428120","3429700"," I was just getting started. "
"3429700","3430920"," Time wasn't on my side."
"3430980","3431800"," I'm trying to get to 196."
"3434260","3435420"," There's June 12th. "
"3437440","3439280"," I wanted it by May."
"3439680","3441540"," I was looking for 196 by May."
"3443060","3445440"," I think May 28th or something like that. "
"3447320","3449280"," I'm a little stinky about this."
"3457560","3460060"," And it's on Friday when I was closing my position."
"3460060","3461760"," I had a three month call, I think. "
"3461980","3463820"," I think it was a three month or a month and a half or something."
"3466460","3468940"," And I had to decide between theta burn."
"3469380","3471820"," And I was up close to 100%. "
"3471820","3477800"," 73 out of 100 equaling greed and the crypto fear and greed index 44 out of 100 equaling fear."
"3478580","3480000"," I had to decide on Friday."
"3480360","3483640"," I was like, am I going to, there's a thing going to burn me into the end of this month?"
"3484320","3491840"," Into the end of June or, I think I'm on that fence of, bad positioning and good positioning. "
"3498200","3498780"," I did."
"3498920","3501500"," I was badly put in my view in my own view."
"3502180","3503660"," I was badly positioned. "
"3503920","3504520"," So I took the money."
"3504640","3505160"," I walked away."
"3507040","3508760"," They had one more dip, right?"
"3509100","3509540"," One more dip. "
"3509660","3511020"," And now they're racing off."
"3511140","3515400"," And that's because I was in a position with a high concentration of calls."
"3515720","3517160"," Other people knew we were going there too. "
"3518420","3519720"," So, you know, I'm inside."
"3520080","3522160"," I watched all the premium come into the into the trade."
"3522160","3523120"," Then I watched it. "
"3523280","3525320"," Then I didn't take the money and run."
"3525540","3530120"," Winky took the money and ran when he took the money and ran."
"3530260","3535040"," I think on May 23rd, he exited. "
"3535280","3535840"," It was on streaming."
"3536040","3537000"," He was like, are you exiting?"
"3537120","3537760"," And I'm like, no."
"3540580","3542640"," And I stayed in and I shouldn't have. "
"3543460","3546240"," And then as soon as I got back, I'm like, I'm fucking out of this trade."
"3547660","3549620"," Too much money tied up for too long."
"3551380","3552480"," I'm bullish on that. "
"3552480","3552880"," I'd be on him."
"3552920","3553160"," Absolutely."
"3554600","3556400"," That's been known around here that I'm bullish. "
"3556600","3557320"," I'm bullish in June."
"3561730","3565090"," We're not into June, into end of June, June 28th, somewhere in there."
"3565810","3567230"," My target is about 196. "
"3567990","3568950"," My personal target."
"3570470","3578400"," In the five minute chart, you're watching the initial move higher."
"3580360","3582280"," Confirmation that we're going higher right here. "
"3584440","3589800"," Target's above 42770, 428 flat."
"3590700","3594920"," Senior of the crime above is at 42964, 42942."
"3604150","3606010"," This is the beautiful right here. "
"3606070","3606330"," Are you ready?"
"3607850","3608130"," Right there."
"3609170","3610190"," Three trigger, bull cluster."
"3612250","3613150"," Successful retest. "
"3614650","3615610"," Target's above."
"3619230","3623570"," As long as price stays above the yellow line, we're extremely bullish."
"3624970","3628090"," Even if we check the white line, we remain bullish. "
"3642720","3644240"," Return to the see the crime."
"3649440","3650780"," Is that IBM dead to me?"
"3651020","3651780"," No, absolutely not."
"3651980","3654160"," It's just a matter of the trade that I was in. "
"3655980","3658540"," Do you guys want to switch over and just cover right IBM?"
"3658740","3658960"," We can."
"3659840","3660800"," Is that your preference?"
"3661160","3662900"," Does everybody in the chat want to trade?"
"3663520","3663820"," IWM?"
"3664960","3665680"," We can."
"3665960","3667640"," I can put that up if you want all day long. "
"3669520","3671540"," We can sit here for like the next six weeks."
"3672420","3673020"," That's six."
"3673200","3674260"," Right here the next three weeks. "
"3675020","3676000"," There's one trade."
"3677680","3679120"," It's like watching paint dry."
"3680060","3686120"," I tend to like put those trades on and then I don't cover them until I'm taking money or exiting"
"3686120","3686640"," or whatever. "
"3687160","3688060"," They take forever."
"3689460","3691800"," To me, IBM's like a grandma trade."
"3692480","3695200"," You place the trade and you don't look at it for three weeks. "
"3697480","3698200"," I don't."
"3698720","3701240"," I'm not a fan of checking on IWM."
"3704080","3705400"," I know it's no. "
"3706280","3708600"," It's a it's a trade that's."

"4318120","4322060"," This is the thirtieth Max Payne for the thirtieth down here for. "
"4322940","4324060"," Four sixteen ish."
"4324660","4326400"," I think there's a lower one like four ten."
"4329060","4330900"," And then seven oh seven. "
"4333540","4335860"," No, that's not the one I was looking at last night."
"4338440","4341960"," Look at that Max Payne four twenty five baby."
"4342400","4345680"," This is your July run and there's even a bigger one. "
"4346200","4348840"," Look at that four fifty five."
"4350620","4354960"," That's someone so someone's trading for the July rip already."
"4356040","4359880"," Someone's looking for that July move that early July blast off. "
"4359880","4361800"," That's July fourteenth."
"4371120","4372840"," Let's take a look at this in your own time."
"4373120","4374600"," I'm going to go through with you briefly here. "
"4375820","4378120"," Four twenty seven four thirty baby."
"4380820","4386760"," I did post a link to this site for you inside of the chat."
"4388340","4392600"," Book market run through it shows you the call and put structure. "
"4392600","4395380"," I will make a note that for you that."
"4396840","4401160"," I need to make a note for you on that on that Max Payne theory shit is that it's not"
"4401160","4402660"," something to be used on its own."
"4403360","4408840"," We also know that the zero date market is heavily heavily influencing. "
"4410940","4415440"," And impacting that Max Payne theory that everybody likes to use."
"4417060","4420500"," I also want you to know that real money buying and real money selling."
"4422000","4423960"," We'll blow that shit right up the water. "
"4425520","4430940"," Unknown news events volatility that kind of stuff even known news events will blow that shit right"
"4430940","4431360"," out of the water."
"4434920","4437420"," Why take a put and call at the same time."
"4438860","4443750"," So sometimes I'll sometimes I'll take a strangle or a straddle. "
"4444980","4446860"," If the pricing is right."
"4447680","4452580"," So when we were heading into yesterday's close I was asked about a strangle or a straddle I can't"
"4452580","4452940"," remember."
"4454740","4459940"," And I looked at the options complex for today's expiry. "
"4462760","4467480"," And I was like that I think that moves will be in futures not in cash."
"4468840","4469780"," By the open right."
"4471440","4475300"," And the reason I thought that yesterday was because puts were expensive. "
"4475300","4482920"," Like 30 delta 50 delta puts were expensive and 30 and 50 delta calls were expensive."
"4483960","4484800"," Both were expensive."
"4485820","4492100"," Normally I'm looking for cheap on both sides either straddles or strangles. "
"4494060","4503980"," Or at least one side dirt cheap like five cent seven cent ten cent puts 20 cent calls."
"4505300","4507640"," So the complete package is like 30 cents right."
"4508460","4510160"," So if I see both sides are expensive. "
"4511580","4513780"," You're watching the options chain every day."
"4514580","4516260"," And both sides are expensive."
"4516580","4518600"," I'm like I'm like son of a bitch. "
"4518760","4521480"," Theta gang is in here trying to sell puts and calls to everybody."
"4522700","4524700"," And there's a seller of those options."
"4526000","4533220"," And that seller is like I'm going to sell some fucking calls and puts to these stupid people out"
"4533220","4533500"," there. "
"4535300","4537260"," And I'm going to make all the money off them."
"4537820","4538700"," So they do."
"4542440","4545360"," Normally if the options chain is mispriced. "
"4547360","4548160"," It's a good trade."
"4554100","4556740"," This yellow box right here is just showing you."
"4558140","4561460"," All of this supply is right up in here. "
"4564600","4565840"," You see it right there."
"4571020","4572840"," Clear skies above right."
"4582950","4586850"," These fucking bears man they just keep fucking they keep buying puts right now. "
"4587350","4589470"," There's load in the fuck out of puts right now."
"4595260","4598420"," They don't want to see the crime erased because they know what that means."
"4600360","4626330"," We're going up if that"
"4626330","4626330"," happens. "
"4626330","4628350"," 37 cents right now."
"4636270","4640370"," We also have the contract roll coming up this week right."
"4657170","4659090"," What up Jimmy Barry how are you brother. "
"4662080","4663660"," Hey you guys want a discord link."
"4670680","4672440"," There's a discord link for you."

"4735320","4736340"," Sellers man."
"4736800","4739400"," They're like short lived bounce trade."
"4740700","4750560"," Good to see you Jimmy. "
"4753540","4754780"," You want to hear some crazy."
"4758240","4761760"," So do you remember when we're talking about the next painting we're going to put up."
"4762640","4766160"," Remember how we painted my man back there Mike Barry. "
"4766580","4767240"," Hold on here."
"4771250","4773710"," Gonna put the light on from Mike Barry back there."
"4774570","4777950"," So I don't know if you can see him but Mike Barry is in the back of the office there. "
"4780010","4782190"," You guys listed a bunch of people."
"4784510","4787230"," That you wanted to see the next painting."
"4788890","4791310"," Because we're painting another painting right now. "

"4810080","4812660"," And so I figured out who we're going to put up there. "
"4815700","4816900"," I figured it out."
"4818120","4820240"," I think I just I don't know if I got cursed."
"4820860","4822600"," I think I'm cursed. "
"4823200","4827560"," A lot of second here."

"4966520","4967620"," I don't know why. "

"5203280","5205850"," All those puts are now worth 19 cents."
"5206560","5207700"," They were 34 cents. "
"5209020","5211280"," We're going to try to whittle those bad boys down."
"5211440","5213500"," We're almost done with the fuel to the upside."

"5470920","5473040"," But businesses may change. "
"5473600","5475480"," We knew that was coming though two years ago, right?"
"5476580","5477760"," We knew that was coming."
"5478220","5480100"," It was a big wild west trade."

"5504570","5504850"," too. "
"5506090","5513950"," Above 5.25, 5.5. G.S. not saying we're going to get a pause in June."
"5515790","5518130"," And then we'll get the 25 BPS in July."
"5523480","5526260"," I'm still on the 25 BPS in June. "
"5527960","5533340"," But if I don't care if it happens in June, July."
"5535140","5537200"," And I think we get another pause after that."

"5583880","5590820"," I spend so much time on live stream now that I like to have a phone call on the phone."
"5590820","5595160"," I don't do a lot of, I try not to do, I have to sit here in front of a"
"5595160","5595840"," computer all day."

"5602760","5607840"," Yeah, and we have a, we have like this, like a weird place right now, right?"
"5608120","5617140"," We've got unemployment rate rising, but we also have, we'll talk about this with the housing"
"5617140","5617520"," market."
"5617520","5620780"," We have a, I've made some posts last night about the housing market."
"5622660","5624500"," Maybe we can review those this morning. "
"5624900","5627680"," So unemployment's a really weird thing right now, right?"
"5627840","5629500"," We talked about this briefly yesterday."
"5630080","5634960"," There's like this like, it's almost like the golden pocket on spy, right?"
"5635400","5645300"," So you got like, you have a moment where the unemployment rate is rising slowly, but also"
"5645300","5651240"," there aren't enough workers to fill positions and there's still demand for workers."
"5655420","5656860"," It's this really weird thing, right?"
"5657020","5662520"," We also have people that can go on unemployment and once they're done with unemployment, there's"
"5662520","5663900"," still a job available for them. "
"5664040","5665760"," It might not be the job they want or the pay they want."
"5666980","5669100"," We don't still don't have job destruction."
"5673500","5676440"," So, so let's say I got laid off by Apple. "
"5677520","5680060"," I could probably still find a job."
"5680740","5681480"," I can collect unemployment."
"5682320","5683340"," Well, I'm not everybody. "
"5683540","5687220"," So a lot of people are contract, but I can probably collect unemployment from laid off."
"5688560","5694440"," And there's still jobs available for me that I don't really have to compete for."
"5694520","5695620"," Maybe lesser pay. "
"5699200","5700520"," So there's still that."
"5704250","5705610"," Come back to retest."
"5706270","5708030"," We had a new high here at 42845. "
"5709810","5711710"," We're going to retest this 42780."
"5718640","5724260"," So there's this like weird, like, like, like, it's like a there's a name for it."
"5724320","5732780"," I forget the name of it, but we're not quite in that job destruction and no jobs. "
"5733200","5733620"," You need both."
"5734420","5737500"," Need like layoffs and sorry, buddy."
"5737860","5739860"," You know, it's a good predictor of this. "
"5741340","5746300"," Is when your your restaurant service gets better."
"5748200","5751060"," You'll see people professionals."
"5753460","5759880"," Have to take second jobs or they'll become bartenders and they'll become restaurant servers. "
"5760790","5763760"," When you see restaurant service and bar service sucks."
"5764760","5767240"," It's because a lot of professionals go get real jobs."
"5768260","5770120"," Shows a good economy, believe it or not. "
"5772360","5773940"," When the economy sucks."
"5775200","5782200"," You typically see much better service at a bar or a restaurant service in general."
"5782920","5784260"," Our service that pays well. "
"5786140","5789020"," Like a tip based service."
"5790660","5791980"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"5793540","5794800"," Not quite there yet. "
"5797020","5798200"," It's kind of gross, right?"
"5798400","5798740"," But it's true."
"5802750","5803990"," Hey, pal donation link."
"5804210","5804790"," Oh, yeah. "
"5805090","5805490"," Thank you."
"5805530","5806350"," Daddy gold."
"5807330","5808170"," Hold on, brother. "
"5808590","5809370"," I got you covered."
"5813850","5815430"," You guys want to take another trade?"
"5821520","5823040"," It's one setting up right now."
"5827800","5828960"," Thanks brother for asking. "
"5829520","5833160"," It's a direct link to donate to the stream if you're coming a better trader."
"5837700","5838640"," Come back down."
"5838780","5840880"," So you had a new high here at 42845. "
"5842000","5845760"," And we are looking to test this five minute trigger here."
"5846320","5847260"," This is that."
"5847440","5848980"," We're in the one minute chart right now. "
"5849040","5854780"," 427.82. And we're coming into the 11 o'clock half hour here."
"5854900","5860320"," It's 11 a.m. You can see back here."
"5860840","5861580"," We got a new high. "
"5862860","5863380"," 1051."
"5876940","5879120"," No requirement for a new high right now."
"5890180","5893600"," VIX trading as low as 1429. "
"5901440","5903480"," Gotta get that VIX nice and cheap."
"5904380","5905940"," We're almost in VIX season."
"5906180","5907700"," Gotta get that VIX down to 10 bucks. "
"5908800","5911580"," So all those cheap vol buyers."
"5942200","5945240"," I'm looking for a bounce trade here for the upside for the senior crime."
"5966250","5973110"," Got an alert in the background saying S&P 500 is neutral right now. "
"5974330","5975970"," Or it's making a cross."
"5979550","5983570"," So the US to sell $60 billion of four week bills on June 8th."
"5983610","5985370"," That's from bearish to neutral. "
"5985810","5988170"," We're looking now for neutral to."
"5992090","5992690"," Bullish."
"5993950","5997450"," So the US lifts the four week bill sales by combined. "
"5997790","6002690"," That's combined with the eight week and 17 week bill sales by combined 42 billion."
"6002690","6003830"," Post the debt deal."
"6009250","6010850"," Did you guys hear that alert in the background?"
"6011170","6012450"," I wonder if you guys can hear that shit. "
"6023840","6028860"," You can go back to the beginning of the program and I talked to you about a relief bounce when"
"6028860","6029740"," we hit bearish."
"6030440","6033780"," You should get a relief bounce and then continuation to the downside."
"6035880","6039920"," You can hear it right now. "
"6039920","6043880"," So I drew out for you earlier that you'll see when we're at."
"6044120","6047240"," So when we're across, let's say we're at extreme, but I'll show it to you guys one more time."
"6047840","6049640"," So do it one more time for you. "
"6055980","6057500"," Everything is a clean chart."
"6057680","6058100"," Do this on."
"6074320","6075080"," This is neutral. "
"6079800","6083920"," This is a bearish."
"6091320","6093300"," This is extreme bearish."
"6102640","6104940"," This is a bullish. "
"6110680","6111880"," This is extremely."
"6118570","6120890"," This is also known as a crossover here."
"6129900","6133160"," Anytime we're right here, take the money and run. "
"6133440","6139880"," These are your highest probability trades buying a dip, selling a rip."
"6143060","6147600"," If we come down and slam down here, I'm looking to exit puts."
"6148100","6149380"," We're looking for a dip to buy. "
"6151320","6151880"," Right?"
"6152180","6153680"," We'll normally cross back up here."
"6157500","6158060"," Right?"
"6158320","6159660"," Make our way to neutral."
"6160840","6161260"," Then up here. "
"6164520","6167240"," Same thing happens to the downside, right?"
"6167780","6168020"," Break below."
"6168020","6168260"," Break below."
"6171900","6173600"," Break below, right?"
"6174120","6174660"," Break below. "
"6177240","6180180"," Now with all this being set up and down, right?"
"6181800","6184300"," When we're rolling over here."
"6187020","6188980"," So let's say we're at bearish, right?"
"6189940","6190740"," We're way up here."
"6190740","6192020"," We came all the way down. "
"6194220","6197540"," Your highest probability trade is this BR, this bear."
"6198340","6203180"," You'll only leave 25% on to get down here to this XBR, this extreme bearish."
"6203900","6206800"," Sometimes we only get to this bearish and bullish, bearish bullish. "
"6208520","6213560"," Oftentimes you'll also, if we are going to head lower, catch a relief bounce."
"6214280","6215200"," We just got right now."
"6216100","6219300"," So we hit neutral and we were actually able to get above it. "
"6219300","6223860"," And we just hit bullish just a moment ago."
"6224020","6224780"," We just tagged this."
"6225380","6226360"," I think it was bullish. "
"6226540","6227640"," That was the last letter we just got."
"6228040","6230320"," After falling by $2.8 barrel."
"6230520","6232200"," We haven't hit this one yet. "
"6233100","6237140"," So we just squeezed up higher here on neutral, not bullish yet."
"6242940","6247680"," We'll find out if neutral holds and we actually only got the bearish."
"6248220","6250820"," And maybe we're going to trade up to this bullish, right?"
"6251380","6254940"," So this next what we're next alert we're looking for is a bullish alert. "
"6255380","6257420"," The range bound here, right?"
"6258260","6259980"," Trade up and down, up and down."
"6260880","6262080"," You can leave some on for that."
"6262240","6264000"," You can leave some on for that down below. "
"6265760","6267040"," I'll show it to you right now."
"6273920","6288560"," I think this is inside of the successful retest so far of the 27"
"6288560","6289120"," EMA."
"6290320","6295680"," Bulls have 15 minutes until 1115 to get a new high. "
"6297300","6298820"," You have a new high here."
"6300560","6303180"," Bulls had a successful retest here."
"6303320","6305160"," Excuse me successful retest here. "
"6306000","6308900"," Bulls now have 15 minutes to get a new high."
"6309080","6311540"," If they can't get a new high, we will go down and recheck."
"6313060","6322960"," 427.34. And we just had an"
"6322960","6325600"," alert for neutral, not bullish at this point. "
"6327920","6331540"," So bulls must get a new high in the next 15 minutes."
"6331540","6351230"," If they don't, we are going to roll 427.95 on a"
"6351230","6351950"," 30 minute chart."
"6364180","6368240"," Always like to buy these bearish signals down here. "
"6369440","6371920"," And be looking for a turn to the upside."
"6372640","6374960"," And we just did get an alert for a turn to the upside."
"6399340","6403340"," So if this zone holds, you consider this neutral, right?"
"6404160","6411020"," If velocity can stay here, we will make a run for bullishness. "
"6420110","6424230"," Bulls must get a new high by 1115 to 1107 right now."
"6427250","6429290"," No new high, no continuation."
"6452330","6453470"," Need new high. "
"6454930","6457070"," I'm going to buy some calls here in just a minute."
"6457830","6460330"," If we can get a new high, I'm going to buy some calls for this run right here."
"6495980","6497340"," Congratulations, Brad Baldo. "
"6521150","6522150"," Six minutes left."
"6522330","6524430"," We'll find out here real shortly if we're going to go up or not."
"6569080","6570560"," If you want to show you something cool. "
"6595030","6596030"," See, I'll find it."
"6596310","6598690"," So we grind up on that hourly trigger."
"6599430","6600650"," So that sideways trade. "
"6602170","6603450"," We get range bound."
"6618400","6620880"," Yeah, John, you think we go range bound or no?"
"6621700","6624360"," Like the hourly just drags us up there."
"6627200","6632560"," Like you drag up to the you drag up like a pin strike on the on the collar. "
"6633400","6634720"," It's like a screaming child."
"6635460","6640300"," And then we finally get a roll like a real role."
"6669420","6670540"," I know. "
"6671380","6673480"," It's like two, three weeks."
"6674740","6677620"," Fifteen sessions just riding the early up."
"6678260","6680600"," It's like dragging a screaming child all the way. "
"6683540","6688320"," And then we get like one quick rip to the upside and then it's sideways again."
"6689140","6690960"," Six sessions, nine sessions."
"6691960","6692860"," However long it takes. "
"6693680","6694300"," Rip higher."
"6701740","6705280"," Come back down to the early by the dip."
"6726460","6729060"," Yeah, I got to put my charts up in the background here. "
"6729320","6730540"," A lot of second here."
"6738380","6740920"," Give me like a programming minute here."
"6741820","6742520"," Give me one second. "
"6743180","6771120"," Keep your eyes"
"6771120","6772740"," on NASDAQ."

"6787840","6791600"," Could get a return to the scene of the crime on NASDAQ."

"6889140","6890280"," This is the bar that I'm looking for."
"6891800","6893120"," This bar right here."
"6898560","6900520"," Five minute chart five minute bar. "
"6901100","6901800"," No new high."
"6902420","6903280"," We'll roll it."
"6906080","6909780"," I'm looking at NASDAQ in the background and I'm like I don't know man. "
"6911640","6914140"," Like you need a role in the NASDAQ right now."
"6914140","6917900"," I need a role NASDAQ down below fourteen five fifty one."
"6917900","6920020"," I think five fifty one fifty six something like that. "
"6926530","6928590"," H.Y.G. has a gap to fill above."
"6934060","6935640"," They're trying to close it earlier."

"7053560","7057320"," Yeah I mean I wanted to make a post this morning on Apple. "
"7058900","7061580"," You know if you're like an Apple bull."
"7063520","7067940"," My price target on Apple is one's today."
"7068300","7073260"," Today it's one seventy three fifty nine but roughly I think by the time it gets done like one"
"7073260","7074040"," seventy five. "
"7074040","7079260"," The thing about Apple is you had your event."
"7080240","7082160"," It's not that it didn't impress either."
"7082320","7083180"," I saw that argument. "
"7083480","7084220"," That's bullshit."
"7084560","7086000"," It did not impress."
"7087360","7088960"," It was priced in right. "
"7089100","7090080"," The event was priced in."
"7090200","7091480"," We traded it up into the event."
"7095040","7097660"," It's that the trade was done right. "
"7099160","7101220"," We traded up in all time highs."
"7101640","7102320"," We had the event."
"7102840","7104920"," The event was not unimpressive. "
"7104920","7106400"," Don't read that shit on the internet."
"7107320","7108320"," It was a good event."
"7108800","7109900"," They have a new product. "
"7111000","7120380"," It's not contact lenses with an iPhone watch right and all that kind of huge tech but it is a"
"7120380","7124500"," step in the right direction for where we're headed some day down the road."
"7125840","7128520"," Apple is showing that they see the future."
"7129280","7130260"," Those are huge things. "
"7131020","7132600"," They have to be priced in to Apple."
"7133220","7136260"," You have to be able to pivot to future tech."
"7136440","7138320"," Doesn't matter if it doesn't work itself out. "
"7138440","7142520"," I don't want to hear the arguments from people out there that are like this will never work."
"7144260","7149380"," Because I'll tell you what a company that doesn't do that is going to get hacked to zero."
"7150900","7158300"," The company that doesn't say we're going to do this we're going to do that and we're following"
"7158300","7158620"," trend. "
"7160780","7162720"," I assure you I assure you of that."
"7164000","7169000"," So if you're a growth company you have to grow with what future tech is promising."
"7171580","7176360"," Now if you're an apple bull as you go into that event you look at the all time highs and"
"7176360","7178600"," you say I'm going to take profit here. "
"7182110","7186570"," So if you're like a long apple bull at all time highs you're off sides."
"7187670","7192090"," Now if there's an apple bull out there that wants to jump back in."
"7193790","7201010"," The smart money apple bull is likely at it's likely down there at 175. "
"7203990","7210090"," Even the smarter apple bull is likely lower at 165 to re-enter."
"7213270","7219490"," Now where does all that money go right it rotates into unloved sectors."
"7221830","7224670"," It rotates into mid cap small caps. "
"7225650","7228630"," Any of tech that hasn't been shown any love."
"7230210","7234750"," And they put risk on elsewhere and you know meanwhile you're trying to chase."
"7236490","7241710"," I don't know NVDA after it's gone up for so long right so you've got a rotational trade going on. "
"7243170","7245890"," And you got to take the money and run trade going on."
"7265570","7270270"," So I don't know how much downside you see in NASDAQ or Spy."
"7271730","7274510"," I don't think you see the crash that you're looking for. "
"7275070","7276610"," Come on man give me a trade bro."
"7278010","7279690"," Give me a trade please."
"7281750","7286380"," I just want to buy this right here. "
"7304350","7305390"," Let me just take it here."
"7339810","7341930"," You'd love to smash apple short at 180."
"7343950","7346030"," Yeah I'm bearish on apple here to 175. "
"7347790","7350770"," Like 175 165 I closed it out."
"7356600","7358380"," I like camping world."
"7360340","7363000"," Johnny I like camping world. "
"7363180","7364820"," I like that trade I used to trade camping world."
"7365280","7366860"," It's a really good trade in general."
"7372240","7374820"," I haven't looked at that I haven't looked at that ticker in a long time. "
"7385070","7386710"," That was a really good trade right."
"7392840","7395240"," Yeah camping world is really nice right now John."

"7415070","7417570"," Yeah March 2020 man I remember that trade. "
"7418050","7418790"," That was a good trade."
"7420170","7421030"," Was that two bucks."
"7422270","7423790"," Went all the way to $42. "
"7426250","7427910"," They went to 50 bucks dude."
"7428350","7429950"," It was a gangster trade by the way."
"7436020","7437560"," I might get my dip pie here. "
"7437680","7437900"," Hold on."
"7438420","7439440"," Go back and put it on."
"7448370","7453170"," That was a stupid COVID trade. "
"7457160","7458680"," Come on down to daddy baby."
"7520640","7523960"," NDX traded below $14.50 John."

"8906100","8908580"," It's like a big trader or a big bull. "
"8911700","8913140"," So we can find him."
"8913280","8914220"," He's on my feet sometimes."
"8914940","8915800"," I think we're friends still. "
"8918760","8919960"," We're going to find his name here."
"8932860","8938390"," To find his name somewhere."
"8940030","8940950"," It's a big trader. "
"8941190","8942770"," He's got like million followers or something."
"8943770","8945270"," We're friends on Twitter."
"8945850","8947470"," So we're having a discussion, right?"
"8947990","8953070"," We're talking about when we're in a bull market, when we're not in a bull market. "
"8953870","8956670"," And how much money you make in a bull market."
"8958390","8961750"," And how much money he was making, how much money that I was making in a bull market."
"8962210","8967250"," And it does a bunch of shit. "
"8967550","8975730"," Like in a bull market, there's so much liquidity that if you buy any of those three dips."
"8976130","8978510"," So in 10 minutes, Tom, now we do get the EI."
"8978690","8979830"," It's going to print eventually. "
"8979990","8981650"," Even if you're upside down, it's going to print."
"8983030","8986410"," And you can make a bad trade and just diamond hand."
"8986550","8987910"," It's where all those terms come from, right?"
"8988250","8988470"," Diamond hand. "
"8990450","8991810"," Comes from bull markets."
"8995390","8996770"," And you just buy one."
"8996870","8999670"," Like if you can get like three basic levels, you buy them. "
"9000510","9003810"," Even if you fucked up, eventually more money is going to come in and you're going to print."
"9006050","9013810"," And like the issue there is that the real issue is that when we go into a bull market, you"
"9013810","9023330"," get surrounded by new bulls in the market that are not good traders, not good investors."
"9024030","9026610"," And so, but they think they're great traders, great investors. "
"9027950","9031490"," And so they're like, look, all this money I'm making, I'm a great trader."
"9032150","9034970"," And what they don't realize oftentimes is that's because there's liquidity."
"9035770","9037010"," Their mistakes are covered. "
"9037010","9045090"," And then we go into a bear market or even a bear market or just a high volatility market."
"9045730","9048350"," Most of those traders and investors get washed out."
"9048610","9049990"," They either close and walk away. "
"9050190","9050550"," They're smart."
"9050810","9053090"," If they're dumb, they lose."
"9053490","9054030"," They lose it all. "
"9054150","9056610"," The reason they lose it all, some don't."
"9056770","9058410"," Some are like, I learned a lesson here or whatever."
"9059310","9063430"," But a lot of what happens in bear markets are high volatility. "
"9068030","9070390"," And that's because liquidity leaves the market."
"9073290","9074770"," And it's actually a bull market."
"9074770","9076190"," It's good for bull bears too. "
"9076550","9080550"," It's hard to be even a bear in a little liquidity market because it's just not enough money to go"
"9080550","9080750"," around."
"9080870","9086850"," You have to be precise in any mistake that you make, you'll pay for."
"9087970","9090410"," There's just not money there to cover up your mistakes. "
"9091210","9093410"," So at this point in this market, where we are, we're going to go into a bear market."
"9094470","9100070"," If you're not a new participant, if you made it through, I don't know, 2020."
"9101870","9109210"," Let's say if you made it through March 2020 until now, as an active investor and trader, you've"
"9109210","9110710"," probably washed out. "
"9113870","9115410"," And I don't know, 70%."
"9116550","9121470"," You guys remember, like every time we're in a bull market, there's like it's cacophony, cacophony,"
"9121590","9122090"," cacophony."
"9124010","9128930"," And if we are entering a new bull market, you will see that happen again. "
"9131670","9134530"," You will see like fin to it explode."
"9136190","9138270"," You'll see stock to its explode again."
"9138430","9140650"," You'll see Wall Street pets ramp up one more time. "
"9142130","9144590"," And so just be aware of that as if this happens."
"9144870","9148410"," If we do make that, if we do turn, I mean, I know that we officially went into a bull"
"9148410","9149930"," market a day or two ago or something."
"9151090","9155150"," But if we do enter a true bull market, you are going to see. "
"9156710","9161290"," I want you to remember, maybe it's going to rephrase this."
"9162050","9167690"," Remember, all the traders and investors that didn't get washed out."
"9169290","9172730"," Like your Jedi Markuses, your volatility whizzes. "
"9173090","9174610"," I can list them off for you."
"9174610","9178030"," So let me go through."
"9178170","9179830"," I can see some of these people in my feed right now. "
"9181130","9181790"," Like M."
"9181990","9182350"," Lebahn."
"9183010","9185650"," Who else is out there?"
"9185730","9186710"," There's a bunch of people out there."
"9187990","9189730"," I already said Jedi Markus. "
"9192290","9194850"," So I had to scroll through and just see who is in my feed right now."
"9197090","9198670"," Buy it, trade it, another one."
"9198830","9199790"," He's been around for a while. "
"9200670","9201770"," He's back to around for decades."
"9202730","9205110"," He, many wizards, been around forever."
"9206570","9207750"," Jedi's whole crew, right?"
"9207950","9209490"," All those pit traders that are out there. "
"9209690","9211330"," I don't know all their names off top of my head."
"9212490","9222190"," But keep these people, keep these people near you through, if we get into a bull market, keep these"
"9222190","9227050"," people near you over new people that enter the market."
"9227210","9230730"," If that happens, trying to scroll through and find some of these people right now. "
"9234550","9236370"," Of course, none of them are my feed right now."
"9236470","9237410"," They were my feed this morning."
"9243350","9249110"," But any of your friends that have made it through at least one full cycle, you should keep them"
"9249110","9251970"," near you in case we go into a bull market. "
"9253150","9257110"," Because they won't be like, hey, I'm new to this market."
"9257110","9258490"," Woohoo, I've been trading for a year."
"9258870","9259790"," I'm making all this money. "
"9261170","9263030"," They're all rock stars and that kind of stuff."
"9263210","9266150"," Be conscious of that if we do enter a bull market."
"9271480","9272580"," Wifi is not a bully. "
"9272760","9273880"," It's a manic bear poster."
"9274920","9276080"," I think Wifi is a trader."
"9276700","9277700"," I don't think he's actually a bear. "
"9280540","9283700"," From my understanding, he's from a background of a hedge fund."
"9285140","9286020"," They're just traders."
"9286800","9287800"," They take both sides of the trade. "
"9288420","9289560"," I could be wrong on that."
"9294250","9297810"," I should make a thread for my favorite follows I have and I should."
"9298490","9299650"," You guys should too. "
"9299790","9306130"," You should seriously like if you guys start, if we, there's like rules right now, we're not there"
"9306130","9306450"," yet."
"9307290","9309950"," Even though officially a couple of days ago, we'll get into it."
"9310010","9312170"," But this is like an inside thing between you and I."
"9312830","9316990"," Every bull bear cycle that we go through weeds out more and more people. "
"9316990","9320210"," Some people get make enough money that they don't."
"9321130","9322670"," It's just a weird thing to talk about."
"9322750","9323410"," We should talk about it though. "
"9324070","9325510"," We have time now to talk about what we will."
"9326790","9332050"," So, write this shit down."
"9333050","9334770"," Do me a solid and write this shit down. "
"9336230","9336990"," Get a pen and paper."
"9337230","9338090"," Write this down for yourself."
"9341010","9346670"," So, each cycle, right, each bull cycle, you're going to think you're a rock star. "
"9346670","9351250"," You're going to pull a bunch of money or you're going to make a bunch of money in the market."
"9352530","9357810"," As you see that bull cycle coming to an end, you're going to look for signs of it, right?"
"9358130","9360330"," Like spec growth getting whacked off, right?"
"9362710","9365910"," Major rolls in dog shit companies, right?"
"9366270","9367610"," Anyways, you have your own ways."
"9367770","9368790"," You'll see it, right?"
"9370210","9375870"," That's a time for you to take your money out of the stock market and begin to try to hide"
"9375870","9376050"," it. "
"9377850","9384690"," So, you remove your money from the stock market and you try to find places to hide it."
"9384850","9387990"," You'll find people out there that will tell you where people are hiding it."
"9389030","9392730"," You'll see people saying, oh, I bought a car wash. "
"9394290","9395050"," I bought some houses."
"9395510","9396010"," I bought this."
"9396250","9396730"," It's about that. "
"9397990","9399090"," I invested in this 401k."
"9399990","9402670"," I invested in this treasury bill."
"9402670","9406250"," I invested in this bank account that's given me 6%. "
"9406910","9407650"," You name it."
"9408070","9408810"," You'll find it."
"9409030","9411030"," People with money will remove it from the stock market. "
"9411870","9414050"," And they're not hiding it because of the stock market."
"9414230","9415990"," They're hiding it because of quantitative tightening."
"9417150","9423410"," And they're also hiding it, hiding it, knowing that companies are going to try to gouge you for"
"9423410","9423610"," your money. "
"9423770","9424490"," That's inflation, right?"
"9425270","9426430"," They know they'll be a repricing."
"9426750","9428950"," They know that governments will come after you for your money."
"9429090","9429910"," It's not just the Fed. "
"9431270","9432150"," It's everyone."
"9432610","9434710"," It's like a musical chairs that takes place."
"9436470","9438270"," And everyone's trying to hoard cash. "
"9440170","9445170"," Hoard, hoard, hoard, hoard, hoard, because there's this hands out there that are going to reach"
"9445170","9447010"," into your life and try to remove it from you."
"9448250","9451290"," And you probably experienced this in your regular life."
"9451610","9452410"," You see it right now. "
"9452630","9457090"," You'll be at a self checkout and the self checkout will ask you for a tip, right?"
"9459410","9462050"," Everything costs more services, goods."
"9462790","9466010"," You get a tax bill in and they go, I just got a tax bill, right?"
"9466730","9468070"," I was telling you guys what tax bill I got."
"9468250","9470330"," Everybody got a tax bill for renovating their house. "
"9471250","9473050"," Didn't matter if you did or didn't."
"9473750","9474830"," Everyone got one."
"9475510","9479390"," That stemmed from city council meetings. "
"9479770","9485070"," They were the city councilmen were watching people that were fucking posting their rehabs on"
"9485070","9485750"," Zillow."
"9487090","9490910"," And then trying to sell them and not pulling permits."
"9491430","9495230"," They all caught on and eventually just hit everybody with a new tax, right?"
"9495330","9495850"," They want their money. "
"9496050","9497290"," They know that money is going to tighten."
"9497610","9498990"," They know that you're not going to have any more money."
"9499150","9500250"," And everybody has to get their money. "
"9501230","9504330"," And the people that are more powerful than you are going to try to take it from you."
"9505010","9507130"," Like you're never the HFFC, right?"
"9507270","9511230"," There's always someone above you that can force money out of your hands."
"9513630","9519530"," So during that phase right there, that should be like signs for you to get the fuck out of the"
"9519530","9520230"," stock market. "
"9521210","9522390"," Be more tactful."
"9523090","9527810"," If you're really not that good of a trader and your trading account is progressively going down,"
"9527990","9530690"," get that fucking money out of there and try to hide it."
"9530790","9534550"," And the reason I'm saying that too is because if you can pull it out of the stock market and"
"9534550","9541950"," hide it from everybody else, you will have more wealth to re-enter a bull market to go to the"
"9541950","9542090"," upside. "
"9542090","9546450"," This is what I'm talking about with liquidity coming back into the market, where you can buy any"
"9546450","9549630"," dip and it will go up."
"9551730","9555350"," So when we do re-enter a bull market, if it's confirmed and you're like, I want to get back"
"9555350","9556050"," to the stock market."
"9556330","9560430"," I self-identified that I suck and it doesn't matter. "
"9560570","9563250"," I can just slam the buy button and it's going to go up at some point."
"9564330","9565090"," There you go."
"9565170","9565970"," You're making more money, right?"
"9566130","9567010"," You're creating more wealth. "
"9567710","9569450"," Wealthy, you got the last bull market."
"9569750","9572470"," You protected it."
"9572950","9574350"," It stayed with inflation. "
"9575370","9578050"," They haven't taken every last dollar out of your hands, right?"
"9578250","9579590"," The stock market didn't take it all."
"9580450","9581730"," Your government took some of it."
"9583310","9585190"," Your waiter took some of it. "
"9585330","9587050"," Your landscaper took some of it."
"9588170","9589750"," The gas company took some of it."
"9592190","9593470"," Your kids took it. "
"9593590","9595370"," The college took it because it increases."
"9595430","9596350"," You name it, right?"
"9597630","9604010"," Then you re-enter that new bull cycle so you can generate returns, right?"
"9604130","9606990"," It's part of what's happening right now, right?"
"9607110","9609150"," I'll let money in the sidelines has to come back in the market."
"9609870","9617330"," Now alongside that, if you haven't been able to make it through one, two, three cycles, eventually"
"9617330","9621790"," at some point you're going to have enough wealth that you can just buy the underlying. "
"9622670","9624250"," You can go in and buy Vanguard."
"9624430","9625510"," You can go in and buy Spy."
"9626570","9631570"," You can just sell puts and calls against that shit and just generate fat cash. "
"9632610","9636250"," Now if you're not there at that point yet in your career, some of you are, some of you are"
"9636250","9636490"," not."
"9638430","9645290"," Then you have to keep trading each cycle or you pissed it away or you got a divorce from your"
"9645290","9646910"," wife or I don't fucking know."
"9647110","9648390"," You got arrested for something. "
"9649650","9650270"," I don't know."
"9650430","9651250"," You come up with it."
"9651350","9652010"," Some kind of pitfall. "
"9652410","9656370"," You cut your leg off in the Amazon rainforest party with cocaine and whores."
"9656890","9660810"," Whatever it is that you did in the bull market, cost you all your money or whatever and you're back"
"9660810","9661690"," in trading or whatever."
"9663310","9669850"," The point though here is that if this was your first cycle or if this is your second and third,"
"9670290","9674390"," this is where I'm bringing this up because I was having a conversation with someone who's traded"
"9674390","9682730"," multiple cycles and we were discussing how each cycle comes around and those those same mistakes"
"9682730","9685410"," that an investor and trader makes, they come back to haunt. "
"9686070","9687030"," Like they won't haunt you."
"9687510","9689970"," Like it's like a different mistakes haunt you in different timeframes."
"9690530","9692270"," You'll have like a mistake that haunts you every day. "
"9692490","9694530"," A mistake that haunts you once a week."
"9695290","9696710"," A mistake that haunts you once a year."
"9697110","9701150"," One that haunts you every three years, every five years, every ten years, et cetera, et cetera. "
"9703070","9709950"," One of these things that comes back to haunt traders and investors is the people that you keep."
"9711150","9716870"," I want you to keep on your blinders if we enter a bull market."
"9716950","9726330"," I want you to remember the people that traded through all that craziness, blew up accounts,"
"9726330","9731070"," got hurt, took a bad trade, anything, right?"
"9731210","9737630"," They're still there trading with you because when a new cycle of bulls come into this market right,"
"9738250","9739410"," don't fucking trust them. "
"9741790","9743550"," Don't fucking trust any of them."
"9744050","9745270"," Let them go through a cycle."
"9746170","9748470"," The ones that are left over you can trust those guys. "
"9749530","9750870"," They're still there hanging out."
"9752330","9758090"," You let them into the inner circle, but do not fucking let these bulls come into this market at"
"9758090","9758510"," some point."
"9758630","9764090"," If we go up higher and start cranking, we do 440, we do 460, we do 470, something like that. "
"9764270","9765050"," They're just fucking everywhere."
"9766070","9768390"," I swear to you, this is a warning to you as a bull."
"9770050","9771510"," Do not trust those people. "
"9774250","9776430"," They will not see the role coming."
"9784500","9787790"," It will not see it coming."
"9787790","9787810"," It will not see it coming. "
"9796060","9797600"," Can be a lie, baby."
"9798860","9802480"," Can be a lie at a one, two, three, four trigger cluster."
"9809500","9812200"," Can be a lie getting all hot and sexy, isn't it?"
"9820210","9821850"," But I keep that in the back of your pocket. "
"9822270","9824270"," That doesn't mean I don't like new bulls and stuff."
"9824450","9825050"," I love new traders."
"9825730","9826310"," I love new investors. "
"9826730","9828210"," I don't know what delicious is with them."
"9828870","9834750"," If you're a new investor, new trader, I've got no dislike for you or anything like that."
"9836070","9841130"," This is more geared towards people that have been around for some time. "
"9852370","9855310"," Dixie getting hammered right now."
"9856130","9864110"," HYG trying to go up and smash the gap above."
"9867170","9869390"," They are now doing that as we speak. "
"9869690","9875610"," They're trying to murder the gap between 7453 and 7455."
"9875610","9878930"," If you are a new trader, look at NDX, man."
"9881890","9885230"," Just squeezing the gap to the upside right now. "
"9888250","9891950"," IWM, man, starting that role on IWM right now."
"9892230","9895270"," I do want you to realize, let's look at IWM really quick."
"9897910","9899330"," We'll bring up IWM here. "
"9902590","9902990"," IWM."
"9905170","9907390"," You want you to be able to identify consolidation."
"9909630","9913530"," Do you see the straight up that we have on IWM right now, right?"
"9914050","9917410"," See that white line going straight up and you see how it's starting to roll a little bit?"
"9919410","9921430"," See how it's starting to flatten out a little bit?"
"9921870","9923110"," Just be careful in here, okay?"
"9924150","9929330"," The more that we start to do that role, the more chances it is, the will be that we'd pre "
"9929330","9932670","-check a lower, higher low, excuse me, a lower low right there. "
"9933730","9943550"," So as you see that flatten out a little bit, target down below 183, 26, 183 and change."
"9944370","9947010"," We can still go higher here just as you watch this."
"9948530","9952270"," Just a little bit of, a little bit of long in the tooth here, it's 1206 PM. "
"9954090","9957690"," Maybe by 130, it starts getting a little long in the tooth on IWM."
"9963870","9966850"," Failure to make a new high right now on the spy too."
"9968070","9968870"," Careful in here. "
"9995700","9997960"," Now there goes the roll on IWM right now."
"10001650","10003850"," Vicks trading 1424."
"10011790","10017490"," I bet ball buyers are like, come on man, just hit $10 so I can buy it. "
"10031640","10033840"," Yeah, I don't like seeing this here, we'll see what happens."
"10034700","10036360"," Let's look at the five minute here and take a look."
"10037460","10039320"," This looks kind of dog shit for bulls. "
"10040780","10044620"," These fucking sellers don't care, man, they are revenge trading."
"10045220","10048040"," These fucking sellers, man, they are fucking pissed."
"10048660","10049340"," Sorry, I shouldn't be swearing. "
"10050200","10052760"," They are, they are raging right now."
"10053400","10055340"," Big rotation in the market."
"10059220","10061840"," Very unusual to see this right here. "
"10062520","10063720"," Double top on an intraday."
"10071270","10074830"," Just range bounding us right here."
"10080990","10084010"," This looks like a, this looks like a boiler room. "
"10084390","10086970"," This really truly looks like a boiler room."
"10087550","10092010"," This looks like the Harlem Globetrotters opening up for the start of a fed meeting."
"10103730","10105530"," It's terribly to describe it, isn't it?"
"10114070","10115390"," Thanks, I'm into the shoot. "
"10120060","10122300"," I know, I know, I know what's happening here."
"10122440","10124020"," I see, I see a couple of things."
"10124680","10127800"," What I do see in the background is that I'm like, yeah, we're rotating. "
"10128960","10134460"," I'm like fucking bears want a short apple into the ground."
"10135660","10138060"," Do you see money coming into the market still?"
"10141660","10142820"," You know, it's like spy."
"10143020","10144360"," How far, how deep can you get?"
"10145480","10147660"," I'm like a, I'm like a cheap ass bull. "
"10147860","10149800"," So I'm like, I want 418, 416."
"10149880","10150760"," Can I get it?"
"10151940","10152980"," Don't know if I get it."
"10153860","10156660"," You see the bid coming in right on 425, right?"
"10157240","10159740"," Fucking big just came right in like, bam, we're buying. "
"10162540","10166200"," Yesterday, so yesterday and finned to it during the daytime at the close."
"10168760","10174340"," There was a lot of longtime traders that were like, do we have trend day tomorrow?"
"10174780","10176140"," And they weren't being facetious."
"10176300","10181060"," They were more like, are we fucking in a bull market where every fucking dip gets bought?"
"10181780","10182720"," That's what they were at. "
"10183100","10186300"," They had like an underline, they had a question and then they had an underlying question."
"10188540","10192160"," Can I get a decent pullback or is it just going to be by every fucking thing?"
"10196980","10201360"," And then of course you got sellers that are like slam sell, slam sell."
"10203900","10205680"," Let's see what the volume is today. "
"10214800","10218420"," I can't see it on my book map right now with the volume is."
"10218600","10219540"," We have a high volume day."
"10219980","10220800"," I'm not looking. "
"10221160","10222860"," I'm going to assume it's a big volume day."
"10231740","10233020"," I'll look at boil for you."
"10238030","10239330"," Looking for boil under $2. "
"10239890","10240250"," Fuck no."
"10241110","10242670"," I'm looking for boil to go up here."
"10246480","10248720"," Yeah, it has some down to go. "
"10249080","10249940"," Yeah, you might be right."
"10258800","10261220"," It's hard to say that it's daily is getting more bullish."
"10262380","10266780"," It's hardly as bearish, but not the down kind of bearish. "
"10270640","10272760"," It's like the bearish like by a dip and go up."
"10274120","10274800"," In my view."
"10279080","10282280"," This probably isn't the dip buy in boil, but there is a dip buy. "
"10291800","10293880"," I'm not bearish here overall, I'm boil."
"10298640","10308580"," I alert you who"
"10308580","10309500"," just put a symphinium."
"10310560","10313560"," Whenever at max, we're extreme bearish and extreme bullish. "
"10314040","10315540"," I let the chat know when that is."
"10316460","10318240"," I'll get an alert that states it."
"10318400","10320260"," That's when you get into a good position with no. "
"10321080","10322100"," It's easy street."
"10323060","10324260"," It's like easy trading."
"10327380","10330380"," So you'll hear me say extreme bullish extreme bearish. "
"10331200","10332260"," Write that down."
"10334380","10337180"," Whenever I say that, easy trading."
"10340560","10341480"," You're long. "
"10341720","10342400"," I'm our VL."
"10343020","10344440"," I'm our VL."
"10349120","10350580"," It's nice consolidation. "
"10353960","10355300"," Can it go up here?"
"10355660","10355800"," Yes."
"10356400","10359340"," I'm not particularly a fan of it."
"10364540","10366400"," I am a fan of it. "
"10366940","10369560"," I shouldn't say I'm not a fan of it."
"10369560","10375960"," I lied for US dry natural gas production at 102 spot 74 BC in June."
"10376720","10381140"," Up from a forecast of 101 spot zero nine BC in May. "
"10390050","10391590"," I'm bullish on Marvel."
"10395150","10396710"," What's your price target on Marvel?"
"10396970","10399250"," Is it 75, 70 bucks?"
"10400610","10401790"," 70, I'm going to assume it's 70."
"10402670","10405870"," Up from a forecast of 101 spot two. "
"10406030","10410470"," If you are long already on Marvel, stay long, I guess, to 70."
"10410830","10413650"," Natural gas consumption at 86 spot five."
"10413730","10415990"," I wouldn't sell it unless it goes below 46. "
"10417830","10419070"," I'd love to buy it at."
"10419070","10424510"," Again, we have posted the EIA steer report on the feed for all those interested."
"10424530","10425810"," I'd like to buy it at 50. "
"10427310","10429390"," I don't know if it gets back down there to 50 though."
"10429490","10430170"," It could just keep running."
"10431030","10431850"," I'm bullish on Marvel. "
"10432590","10433950"," Sorry for saying that for Marvel technology."
"10434370","10434610"," I'm bullish."
"10446740","10447780"," I'm bullish on it. "
"10448540","10449820"," I might have a pullback."
"10450460","10453040"," It could still get slow smackdown market conditions."
"10455320","10455900"," Check that. "
"10456040","10459460"," If you have a down day again on Marvel, from this point forward, if you have a down day on"
"10459460","10462440"," Marvel, get back with me on stream and I'll let you know."
"10468060","10471140"," I'll have a drawing a box and writing inside of it extreme bullish from bears."
"10471320","10474000"," I get alerts that tell me if we are or we are not. "
"10474880","10475980"," You know, ding in the background."
"10476500","10479360"," You'll hear it on stream and go ding ding ding ding ding ding and it tells me if we are"
"10479360","10479900"," or we aren't."
"10483900","10484740"," You're in at 62. "
"10485980","10487500"," Yeah, I wouldn't be concerned here."
"10489120","10491300"," You're going to have, you know, you're going to have volatility in it."
"10491400","10493480"," But if you're owning the underlying, I like it here. "
"10494780","10501640"," I'd prefer to buy it at currently today, like $50.28. But your daily is coming up to meet you"
"10501640","10501760"," here."
"10501960","10505180"," So you're likely going to get, likely ain't going down to 50."
"10505420","10508660"," It's likely going to come up and meet you. "
"10508800","10510120"," You have some consolidating to do."
"10510220","10510480"," That's it."
"10524340","10525600"," What's the VEX company?"
"10527880","10529180"," What do you guys want to take a look?"
"10529860","10531200"," You guys want to take a look at the tickers?"
"10537550","10539790"," Was I making fun of X companies or something the other day?"
"10539990","10541310"," Do a lingo ripping faces off?"
"10541910","10542270"," Oh, yes. "
"10542810","10543490"," Is it a Nari?"
"10543870","10545110"," I-N-I-A-R-I?"
"10546410","10547810"," They flip bearish."
"10551210","10552250"," Dash still bullish."
"10553590","10554470"," Toast still bullish. "
"10556910","10557990"," Oscar still bullish."
"10562110","10565370"," I-O-N-Q is in a buy area now."
"10567550","10570530"," FT-A-I-R-FIP is still bullish. "
"10571330","10572110"," Rippin' faces off."
"10573510","10574710"," Peacore still bullish."
"10576450","10578690"," H-C-A-P had with a dip buy bullish. "
"10580590","10582430"," Sholes coming into a dip buy here."
"10583130","10585470"," Sholes is almost ready."

"10590210","10592610"," C-F-L-T ripping faces off."
"10594390","10596310"," Smart ripping faces off."
"10597230","10598970"," It might be that Nari company, man. "
"10599670","10600830"," Is that the one you're talking about, Hutch?"
"10602010","10603070"," Oh, NVEX?"
"10603530","10605030"," Yeah, I have no idea about NVEX."
"10606390","10607530"," I don't trade that shit."
"10608230","10610030"," Well, I traded it years ago. "
"10611890","10613210"," Hey, Alexander, how are you?"
"10620130","10625850"," Let's talk about the tickers that we track here first, then we'll talk about NVEX."
"10627070","10628350"," We already talked about FUBO, didn't we?"
"10629650","10630870"," Pounds here we can talk about."
"10631050","10631830"," Let me see what I have time. "
"10631990","10632270"," We'll do it."
"10634410","10636990"," So, in our portfolio, right?"
"10637250","10637870"," Stock portfolio?"
"10639470","10640830"," It's outstanding right now."
"10641030","10642210"," It's doing very well still. "
"10643450","10644610"," Just fucking moving right along."
"10646270","10648570"," The only one that I don't like."
"10651250","10654190"," Currently, it's got higher lows on it. "
"10654250","10655830"," It's trying to fight back to get it on the trend."
"10656130","10661230"," What I don't fucking like about this, it's called Nari Medical, I-N-A-R-I."
"10661530","10663330"," Medical, I fucking hate medical companies. "
"10664010","10670030"," We are coming into biotech season, but I hate them because they're always fucking news-driven."
"10671030","10672390"," And so you have to manage them."
"10673510","10674890"," It's an active thing. "
"10675090","10678870"," You're constantly following these fucking tickers."
"10679290","10685310"," Instead of it being a regular up and down, it's like, yeah, we ran it up into the news."
"10685930","10687330"," Do we care what the news is?"
"10687590","10688810"," Fuck no, we're selling it. "
"10689590","10693730"," And then the company is like, well, we don't expect shit for the next nine months and you're like,"
"10693990","10694870"," damn it, I'm going to run."
"10696070","10698030"," So I might remove Nari from the mix."
"10698250","10701210"," Even if it goes up here, I'm going to remove Nari. "
"10701210","10706130"," So if you're following along in this ITTF, I'm going to remove it based just on principle."
"10706630","10707090"," So it's gone."
"10708490","10712470"," Just based on principle because of how difficult it is to manage. "
"10713350","10716190"," I want like a dip-eye and walk away and not have to worry."
"10716390","10719190"," I'm not looking for news-driven portfolio."
"10720170","10721590"," So Nari is gone off the list. "
"10728390","10730070"," Yeah, NVAC's been a while, right?"
"10730990","10732370"," You're looking at NVACs for it right now."
"10740090","10740570"," NVACs."
"10743710","10744630"," What did it squeeze?"
"10744850","10745110"," Yeah, it did. "
"10745230","10746930"," It squeezed up like 10 bucks, right?"
"10749090","10751010"," Did NVACs like squeeze 10 bucks?"
"10751210","10752490"," Do you want to know if it's going to squeeze again?"
"10756880","10758500"," Yeah, I can squeeze here."
"10760560","10761980"," Fuckin' hate NVACs, man."
"10764920","10767000"," I don't want to trade NVACs. "
"10767000","10770040"," I see your point of your saying it should squeeze."
"10772680","10773480"," Fubo."
"10773760","10776340"," I think we already mapped out Fubo yesterday. "
"10778120","10779560"," Yeah, Fubo's squeezing."
"10780540","10782440"," We talked about Fubo already."
"10784440","10789980"," Fubo, take the money and run right now. "
"10790640","10795160"," Between here and 198, re-enter Fubo."
"10795160","10801760"," If it holds a re-test, a re-test, that means we break above $2."
"10802560","10806120"," We come back down and re-test $2 and it heads higher. "
"10809840","10818160"," And then we'll talk about taking out $2.40. And then hopefully $3.13. $3."
"10819640","10822360"," You guys are fucking revenge trading Fubo, aren't you?"
"10822360","10825340"," I don't know if I mentioned this the other day when I went over Fubo."
"10826220","10830580"," I would love to see this as an MA target, an MA acquisition. "
"10833320","10834600"," Morning Stacy, how are you?"
"10835820","10837300"," Hi, Alexander, how are you?"
"10843400","10843860"," Mara."
"10844540","10845700"," I'm going to look at Mara for you."
"10846120","10848660"," You guys call out all the bag-holder stocks. "
"10850740","10855440"," You guys call out all the stocks that everybody likes to talk about because they know you'll..."
"10855960","10857320"," You guys know this, right?"
"10858360","10863760"," You guys know that Furu's talk about these stocks because they know you're going to come and want"
"10863760","10864260"," to trade them."
"10865440","10871820"," Mara, with a dip-bound spy on its weekly trigger."
"10872980","10873440"," We'll look at Mara. "
"10875060","10876840"," Hang tight here, we'll look at Mara right now."
"10880730","10882090"," You guys are savages."
"10885590","10886290"," It's like the..."
"10886290","10888130"," It's how you get churn. "
"10888430","10889410"," You guys know what churn is?"
"10891330","10892950"," Churn is when I'm like your therapist."
"10896270","10900990"," Because you got trapped in some stinky, shitty stock."
"10901950","10904310"," I know you'll be like, I've never trapped Cap, I love it. "
"10904550","10905310"," It's my favorite ticker."
"10906450","10908190"," I drank all the Kool-Aid, I'm a believer."
"10908850","10910550"," Okay, so Mara did a great job, right?"
"10910550","10912930"," Bounced off of its weekly trigger down below. "
"10914150","10915730"," Great dip-eye down here."
"10918390","10920310"," It's looking extremely bullish here."
"10921430","10927810"," As long as Mara stays above 9.45, you already know that you're targeting this 9.74, ultimately"

"10936950","10944220"," You guys want to look at what do you call it next, right?"
"10949840","10950700"," PLTR, baby."
"10953040","10954100"," Swimming right now."
"10957780","10966540"," PLTR, last time we took a look at PLTR, we saw the huge..."
"10968180","10972140"," 1-2-3-4-5 trigger, right?"
"10972580","10977620"," Explosive move to the upside, confirmed by the hourly, rolled over, came back down to the hourly,"
"10978700","10982860"," started a trend to the upside, nothing is saying anything otherwise. "
"10985020","10989940"," There is one thing to say here, which is you're getting a little bit of normalization back to the"
"10989940","10991080"," stock, which is good to see."
"10994860","11001740"," Still bullish, as long as price holds 15-14."
"11005540","11008580"," So as long as price holds 15-14, we're good to go. "
"11008820","11010180"," We're going to point out this right here."
"11011660","11015180"," You see that we had a retest of the hourly, continuation higher."
"11016240","11018880"," I also want you to know if you break..."
"11019980","11021640"," I'm going to explain what a break is. "
"11021900","11024500"," You break below and it rejects."
"11025740","11029700"," When you start to see this, you pull stop."
"11029980","11031340"," You have set stops there, okay?"
"11031600","11032860"," Not a test, but a break. "
"11033540","11034560"," Rejection of hourly."
"11035600","11037380"," Your target below will be 14-20."
"11037640","11042220"," My expectation here, we are getting a little long in the tooth. "
"11042900","11046820"," Your next buy-in for Palantir."
"11047420","11047980"," Palantard."
"11048740","11050640"," I love Palantir, by the way, PLTR. "
"11050840","11051040"," I love it."
"11052520","11057400"," Next expectation for a dip buy is likely going to be $13 flat."
"11059080","11062760"," For continuation higher, you want to see this daily come up. "
"11064960","11067040"," You want to see it mingle here with the hourly."
"11067340","11068980"," You want to see the hourly come down, swoop down."
"11068980","11070680"," I guess I said 13, maybe 14. "
"11071720","11076460"," I'd like to see some kind of roll like this, capitulation move, and then a continuation of the"
"11076460","11078640"," upside on PLTR."
"11078900","11084760"," Set an alert somewhere down at $13 and $14 for an entry if you're looking to enter that trade."
"11086780","11087220"," PLTR. "
"11092320","11093640"," Alexander, take it easy, brother."
"11097000","11098320"," AI, is that a fad?"
"11108760","11111600"," Yeah, I'm long Rocket Lab right now, Stacey."
"11113540","11115840"," I am long and strong on Rocket Lab. "
"11116980","11119680"," I've been long for the dumpsters."
"11120980","11124440"," It added like when it was in the absolute fucking dumpsters."
"11125500","11128680"," That was my pear trade with Tesla. "
"11139080","11143000"," Yeah, Johnny, I want to see VIX trade by 10, 12 bucks, man."
"11145300","11147560"," I want to see VIX trade like 10, 12 bucks."
"11150960","11160930"," Just a heads up"
"11160930","11170330"," that they put owners, the zero date put in call buyers, the algorithms have switched from the put"
"11170330","11171850"," side to the call side. "
"11171850","11178450"," There's now 334,000 call buyers on zero dates."
"11179170","11182130"," Some kind of algorithms in there messing around."
"11201140","11204820"," Yeah, I want to see VIX trade 10 to 12 dollars. "
"11206540","11211760"," Yeah, I want to see VIX trade 10 to 12 dollars, and then I want the range to be 10"
"11211760","11214720"," to 20 dollars with an upside extreme of 30."
"11217340","11223280"," If you don't know why that is, I've showed you in the past, if you recall, when I showed you"
"11223280","11231340"," the price of spy trading above, it's daily, weekly and monthly, and then return to some kind of a"
"11231340","11232180"," normalized market."
"11232760","11239540"," Even if we roll over and down, even if we have quarterly lows, there should be a drop in"
"11239540","11243620"," volatility, well, not a drop in volatility, but a normalized vol. "
"11251380","11253120"," I know that sounds crazy to say."
"11254100","11260860"," So it's not that vol can't go up, it's that volatility as an asset."
"11261200","11269060"," So when we're trading vol between 20 and 30, like an average of 20 to 30, it's showing that we're"
"11269060","11270040"," in a volatile market. "
"11270980","11273140"," Currently, we're not in a volatile market."
"11274280","11275520"," I don't know if you know that or not."
"11276420","11286560"," Until we trade below certain numbers, we should be trading the VIX between 12 and 20 with"
"11286560","11296040"," extreme lows at 10, not extreme, but like super lows at 10, and then maybe like a pin strike at"
"11296040","11302980"," eight or nine, believe it or not, and then like the highs being like 30, not 40 and 50. "
"11303520","11307700"," You don't see 40 and 50 unless we start going back to volatility again."
"11308460","11309580"," We're not in that market right now."
"11316130","11317710"," Do I mind looking at Bitcoin?"
"11318710","11319870"," No, we can look at it. "
"11324430","11325130"," I'll do it."
"11328490","11330190"," Which BTC do you want?"
"11330850","11332210"," You want Bitcoin futures?"
"11333630","11335210"," You want Bitcoin dollar?"
"11336250","11338170"," I can't stand Bitcoin, man."
"11339770","11343010"," BTC with a bond or Bitcoin to US dollar, right?"
"11343010","11345690"," Trading 26 to 16. "
"11348610","11353290"," Bullish to at least close the gap above at 26, 6, 4, 5."
"11354690","11357190"," And I'm actually bullish higher than that."
"11357910","11365110"," My price target personally for Bitcoin is a return to 27, 7, 1, 5."
"11367910","11369910"," So I am bullish Bitcoin here."
"11376500","11377840"," I'll give you three targets. "
"11377840","11379480"," So maybe three upside targets for Bitcoin."
"11383140","11385680"," 26, 5, 5, 5."
"11387080","11388540"," 27, 1, 3, 8."
"11390860","11392620"," 27, 7, 4, 5."
"11394380","11396240"," There you go for your Bitcoin, bros."
"11397100","11399220"," These tools work for Bitcoin very well. "
"11399340","11400520"," Crypto, they work really well."
"11401380","11402500"," Bitcoin is a weird thing."
"11402620","11411520"," I fucking can't stand crypto, but so much of it is a scam that trades"
"11411520","11417380"," easily to traditional shit, in my view. "
"11423950","11426450"," Wait till I show you the Bitcoin crypto shit."
"11427310","11428890"," You're going to be all ooh and on."
"11437210","11439690"," Do I still believe that we get the roll and the spy?"
"11439690","11442290"," I think it's the same as usual. "
"11443150","11444250"," I think you get the roll."
"11444410","11447950"," I think you get consolidation, the roll down into end of month."
"11448450","11450110"," And then I think that you get the high in July. "
"11455870","11457130"," Look at Pepsi for you."
"11460770","11462190"," So yesterday I'm finned to it."
"11462210","11465190"," I told you I was looking for 425, right?"
"11465370","11465850"," We got that. "
"11466130","11467390"," Do we not get that today or did we?"
"11468230","11469010"," Did we or not?"
"11470130","11472230"," I guess we got 425, 99, right?"
"11472990","11474570"," We got 425, 99."
"11475130","11476910"," So I was bearish to that number."
"11477670","11480550"," And then I said to you that I want to buy 416, 418. "
"11481750","11485170"," So I'm looking for that number for the next dip buy."
"11494040","11495220"," Pepsi, I'm bearish on."
"11497860","11500100"," I think Pepsi is just getting started to the downside. "
"11500100","11505620"," For me, a price target on Pepsi, Pepsi would be 173."
"11507020","11508660"," Somewhere in there, 172."
"11510580","11512120"," I'm not bullish on Pepsi here. "
"11517340","11518380"," Another good one."
"11520580","11523080"," I'm bearish on Pepsi on PEP."
"11534490","11536090"," Yeah, you're welcome. "
"11536090","11540550"," So GME, we're going to start it."
"11540750","11542350"," I want you guys all to know some."
"11542650","11543910"," So on Sundays, right?"
"11545030","11548370"," We're going to make this show review. "
"11548870","11551350"," This show, the live stream and the Sunday show."
"11551750","11555390"," We're going to spend part of our day reviewing all the indexes."
"11556690","11557990"," Thank man plus tea. "
"11558230","11559130"," I know it's meta now."
"11560150","11563710"," And then we're going to review the ape stocks."
"11565830","11567530"," And I think they're in the ape stocks. "
"11567830","11570350"," And then on Sundays, you'll get individual tickers."
"11570690","11571970"," You'll get the tickers that we pick."
"11572850","11575790"," And you're going to have a tool that shows you when those tickers pop up. "
"11579530","11581190"," And we'll review those as well."
"11581410","11583230"," I should be doing this every day and I don't."
"11583350","11585850"," We're adding this to the program in the coming weeks. "
"11586710","11592110"," Now GME is gorgeous right now."
"11593610","11597730"," GME is coming into its resistance at 2660."
"11598390","11602870"," If you're looking for a buy in, there's two things you need to know on GME. "
"11603670","11607050"," As long as it stays above 2465, the move is higher."
"11608250","11610350"," It is getting a little long in the tooth and the daily."
"11611110","11614090"," I'm not a fan of buying it where it is right now. "
"11615910","11618350"," Personally, I'm not a fan where we are right now."
"11618350","11626370"," I would like to buy it at $22.69 or above $26."
"11627450","11637080"," Maybe higher, $26.50. It is getting bullish"
"11637080","11637760"," overall. "
"11638260","11642480"," I shouldn't say it's not getting bullish, but it's going to take some time."
"11642820","11646360"," It's going to take the 19th of May."
"11648420","11651860"," It could take four weeks to get that extremely bullish. "
"11652920","11655820"," So my long term view on GME is bullish."
"11657240","11662100"," It could take multiple weeks for that move that you're looking for."
"11663620","11667200"," Now that introduces tying your money up. "
"11667300","11669920"," It introduces bad news that can come for GME."
"11670400","11675200"," You know that it's a basket stock for hedge funds."
"11675200","11677800"," They can pull some real scams in there. "
"11677980","11684880"," So if I was trying to trade GME right now, I would hope for a quick fast down move to"
"11684880","11687260"," $22.72 today."
"11693500","11695840"," Yeah, I'm not a I'm not long GME."
"11696700","11699200"," Not long GME for their earnings. "
"11700260","11702620"," They're a they're for me there."
"11702900","11704080"," They have to have a perfect setup."
"11704080","11706700"," I feel like you get trapped easily. "
"11707320","11712320"," And GME could go up on earnings, but for me, I'd buy above."
"11712520","11723000"," So for me, I'd buy above $26.67. Next century for me would be down here $22.73. And"
"11723000","11724140"," I don't try."
"11724700","11731600"," I'll give you targets for earnings, but you know, because below that below your $26. "
"11731600","11737540"," If you break and hold below $22.72. I think break and hold reject there."
"11737760","11739740"," You are going back to retest 18 bucks."
"11739920","11740340"," No problem. "
"11741520","11743460"," You'll you'll retest 2047."
"11744120","11747000"," And then you'll retest 1817 like it's nobody's business."
"11758870","11763490"," Yeah, not a I'm making a make a tick kind of guy with GME. "
"11763490","11766370"," Like it has to be the right time right now or right part of the day."
"11768850","11770690"," Otherwise you get stuck in that shit."
"11770830","11771550"," You never get out of it. "
"11771650","11772390"," Well, you don't get out of it."
"11772410","11773930"," You get bored and then you're like, fuck it."
"11773930","11774850"," I just want to get done with this. "
"11776410","11777910"," That's going up and then you sold."
"11778590","11781050"," And then you're just like all the timings all fucked up for you."
"11781290","11785090"," So for me, for my personal my personal opinion. "
"11787130","11794090"," The trade started this last trade on it started somewhere along the 25th of April."
"11795410","11796430"," First week of May."
"11798010","11799410"," So if you're long from then. "
"11800210","11803390"," If you're buying then it's time to take profit."
"11803830","11804330"," It's close."
"11804890","11806190"," Take profit and then buy it. "
"11806450","11810710"," You can always jump back in again above 2660 somewhere in there."
"11811270","11811610"," Oh, dude."
"11811710","11812830"," Am I going to get a dip by or what?"
"11814950","11818690"," You know, they're fucking dip by in here sitting grab a dip here. "
"11820370","11821630"," Double top on the spy."
"11822870","11825270"," Sellers coming in this unlike earlier."
"11826510","11831650"," You're seeing a bear flag or a bear plane right here. "
"11831650","11833490"," So we'll see if we can get a nice dip by in here."
"11833810","11837310"," Or if they're going to try to roll this down and into Valhalla."
"11838190","11841270"," Which is down at 416, 418 ish. "
"11842590","11844830"," Sellers want to get underneath the hourly trigger."
"11845710","11847530"," We have some targets down below."
"11847690","11848470"," We've got S one. "
"11848770","11849110"," Wait a minute."
"11849190","11849990"," I forgot to put this one in."
"11852710","11855190"," We have yesterday's previous low right here. "
"11855270","11857450"," We'll put this on here so you guys can see where it's at."
"11864320","11866280"," I'm over here looking at tickers and not the spy."
"11870540","11872640"," So just in here be aware of this. "
"11877020","11881200"," You're going to have bears out there saying we have an intraday rejection to the upside."
"11882100","11883380"," And that is important to note."
"11884420","11886400"," And what makes it important is. "
"11887460","11890300"," You've got buyers stepping in right."
"11891220","11892820"," You've got sellers saying no."
"11893480","11895120"," So you had buyers down here right. "
"11896000","11897400"," You've got sellers saying no."
"11898160","11900300"," You've got buyers again moving up."
"11901220","11902140"," They came up. "
"11902760","11905220"," They came up here and said we're buying this."
"11906200","11908420"," And there was a check right here."
"11909540","11910880"," And the buyers disappeared. "
"11911460","11911860"," They were gone."
"11912980","11914300"," The buyers are not here."
"11915720","11917880"," It's pretty big right when you don't see the buyers there. "
"11920020","11921720"," So when you don't see the buyers here."
"11922520","11923680"," Oh I should have got to put that back up."
"11924200","11924860"," So you can see it. "
"11925120","11925500"," Make it better."
"11927860","11930200"," See the initial buyers stepping in down below."
"11930540","11930720"," Let me see. "
"11930860","11931780"," Let me just make this easier."
"11938050","11939290"," Buyer stepping in right."
"11939790","11942090"," Buyer stepping in. "
"11942650","11943970"," Sellers like get out of here."
"11944690","11946170"," Sellers strong here."
"11946570","11948070"," When you see this here right. "
"11949530","11950890"," It's showing you two things."
"11951030","11954670"," You've got buyers and sellers kind of like meeting into this coil right here right."
"11955730","11957330"," You want to find out who is stronger. "
"11959430","11962050"," And the test for that is right here."
"11964270","11966570"," Are the buyers stepping in higher?"
"11966910","11968010"," One, two, and three."
"11968410","11969630"," And right now they're not. "
"11971770","11972710"," Let's see that right."
"11973070","11974050"," We've got middle of the day."
"11974950","11976230"," It's now 1240. "
"11977070","11980970"," We were talking about how you get the middle of the day."
"11981070","11981630"," Drag's right."
"11982110","11983150"," Everybody's taking a lunch. "
"11984310","11986430"," And these sellers are going to try to come in here."
"11986950","11988910"," And not just test this one."
"11988970","11990290"," Not just test this one. "
"11990910","11992150"," Actually we already got the previous lows."
"11993330","11994110"," So scratch all this."
"11994290","11995730"," We're going to look even lower now. "
"11997070","11997590"," Right?"
"11997930","11999410"," So we're going to look lower than this level."
"11999690","12000830"," Look lower than this level."
"12001410","12002570"," And we already did this one. "
"12002690","12003590"," That's why I deleted it."
"12004010","12006070"," So we're going to go lower, lower this time."
"12006530","12010070"," So bears are looking to go even lower. "
"12011210","12012750"," And let's see where those lows are."
"12023830","12026190"," So we already tagged yesterday's lows right."
"12026510","12027050"," Previous low. "
"12027870","12029070"," New low down here."
"12029330","12030470"," So they're going to check now."
"12041730","12042910"," Today is low. "
"12048140","12049820"," What they want to do is erase."
"12051300","12053400"," See where this demand stepped in right here."
"12057800","12062300"," So you have S1 and S2 for that previous known demand. "
"12063200","12064680"," So we will go down here."
"12065420","12068120"," We will attempt to slam on this one."
"12069180","12069800"," Right here. "
"12070100","12070660"," So watch this."
"12072160","12073800"," We already tagged that one from yesterday."
"12074280","12074980"," So get rid of it. "
"12075480","12078360"," And your next target on the downside is going to be today is low."
"12079260","12082480"," Your next targets below that are S1 at 425 again."
"12082820","12089280"," And then 424.43. And then bears want nothing more than to close this gap and get to the daily. "
"12089660","12090440"," Why is that not showing up?"
"12091820","12098460"," I don't know why."
"12098760","12100260"," Sometimes that's not showing up."
"12100520","12101300"," It's right here. "
"12101300","12106060"," I don't know why this bar is not showing up."
"12109080","12114420"," It's like something to do with the fucking through the daily trigger."
"12114660","12115300"," Hold on. "
"12121990","12123950"," 416.89, baby."
"12126610","12130250"," 416.89, right down here."
"12134720","12136260"," Right down there. "
"12136260","12138480"," Race that whole move down there."
"12138900","12139500"," Daily trigger."
"12139620","12140640"," This is where I want to buy, man. "
"12140800","12142100"," This is where I want to extreme bearishness."
"12145340","12146700"," So you see that right there?"
"12147720","12148500"," Previous low."
"12150120","12151060"," Today is low. "
"12151580","12152660"," We already took this one out."
"12153580","12156140"," And we know that this is the last known place down here."
"12157040","12159300"," We got a bunch of shit back here. "
"12159380","12161220"," We got a giant gap down here at 421."
"12162100","12163020"," 422 to close."
"12179060","12180060"," On the one minute. "
"12180700","12190610"," Bear plane right here at 427.70. Range bound trading all day long"
"12190610","12190950"," today."
"12194360","12195360"," Hey, David, how are you?"
"12210580","12212400"," I'm looking at NDX right now, dude."
"12213720","12215020"," Big old bear plane now. "
"12215200","12215380"," Finally."
"12215540","12216580"," First time we didn't see it."
"12216720","12217520"," No bear plane here. "
"12218260","12219520"," This one is a bear plane."
"12219720","12221780"," This one right here is looking for a nice roll of the downside."
"12235540","12237580"," Let's see if we can get some blood going here. "
"12241420","12243240"," I'm going to try to buy some puts up in here."
"12243380","12244420"," If I can get some puts up here."
"12244560","12256020"," 427.56. That"
"12256020","12256720"," target below. "
"12258100","12267970"," 25.98. There's S1 right"

"12343970","12364560"," There it is"
"12368240","12369160"," right there, man."
"12462400","12468920"," 4.20. 4.25. 4.26. 26 or 21 cents. "
"12469220","12470660"," 4.25 is 8 cents."
"12515740","12517400"," Come on baby, make a rain."
"12548550","12549650"," Keep the bear music. "
"12549910","12550330"," Hold on to here."
"12553050","12553530"," Oh."
"12555810","12557770"," All right, so I got the bear music set up. "
"12558090","12559010"," Tell me when to play it."
"12560210","12563610"," I'm in put some in 4.25 P's."

"12571640","12574960"," We'll see if we break here or not."
"12578190","12580530"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"12589630","12591450"," Come on down, baby. "
"12594310","12595130"," It's testing."
"12598110","12600410"," I can't play it unless we break the HT."
"12601630","12603490"," We have to break this right here. "
"12604230","12606030"," We need to have like one red bar."
"12608230","12610190"," We need one red bar right here."
"12610590","12615430"," Like we need like one, just one red bar, and then we need a rejection candle. "
"12616410","12620090"," We need this right here to come on down, and then we'll start playing."
"12620650","12621610"," Like right there."
"12621690","12622070"," That's what we need. "
"12625850","12627390"," Can't do it until that happens."
"12628170","12635450"," And then you get your raining blood."
"12637490","12639270"," Well, it's probably not like that. "
"12639350","12640190"," It's probably like this."
"12641210","12642170"," Then like that."
"12642410","12643410"," Oh, I'll do it better for you. "
"12643710","12644630"," It's probably like."
"12649440","12650600"," Probably like this."
"12653200","12654800"," No, you might not get PT3. "
"12655480","12657480"," So don't be all like crazy here."
"12658800","12660180"," It's probably like this."
"12660980","12661720"," Like that. "
"12663340","12664640"," Then like that."
"12665560","12666440"," Then like that."
"12666840","12667580"," Then like that. "
"12668140","12669180"," Then a quick sideways."
"12670140","12671660"," And then like that down there."
"12672280","12673300"," Something like that. "
"12675000","12677440"," But can't play the music unless we break."
"12677440","12677680"," No break."
"12679340","12679780"," No music. "
"12682900","12684220"," So we'll wait and see here."
"12690960","12693280"," If you want to know my stops are on puts."
"12695740","12697280"," They're right up here somewhere. "
"12713090","12714710"," I got the music queued up."
"12716390","12717950"," I got the music queued up."
"12718150","12721290"," So if we do the break, I'll fucking play it, okay?"
"12728050","12731070"," I got the music lined up. "
"12732510","12734290"," You don't have confirmation yet."
"12734430","12736010"," You should not be in puts right now."
"12736070","12736750"," It's very dangerous. "
"12739070","12742230"," You want to see that break below that hourly trigger."
"12761920","12763520"," You got some London dry gin."
"12766300","12767320"," That's not here tonight. "
"12767440","12768760"," That's all grown in group short meta."
"12770580","12771060"," Yeah."
"12771160","12774840"," Did you see the did you see the that. "
"12776240","12777160"," What do you call it?"
"12777200","12778220"," Communications are like."
"12778840","12781180"," We're rotating into communications right now."
"12782420","12782900"," Johnny. "
"12788740","12789920"," You got slayer ready."
"12819750","12820150"," Yeah."
"12823650","12824270"," There was a rotation. "
"12825630","12827010"," I'll bring it up for you in the background."
"12836940","12839340"," I think Facebook's like met as a part of that, right?"
"12846560","12848060"," Yeah, I'll show it to you right now."
"12855920","12856720"," So today. "
"12857840","12859820"," So I posted you yesterday's rotation."
"12861220","12863160"," We had a rotation yesterday."
"12863200","12865380"," This is today's but yesterday's rotation. "
"12866320","12867960"," Communication services, baby."
"12868300","12869680"," I think met as a part of that."
"12872600","12876180"," I think Friday you got some rotation into that seat down here. "
"12876260","12876640"," It's lower."
"12876940","12877620"," This is one week."
"12880240","12882220"," One month relative cranking. "
"12883840","12885500"," Maybe we're rotating out of it, I guess."
"12885660","12887300"," Maybe I said we're rotating into it this morning."
"12887300","12890820"," It's cyclically sector wise. "
"12891180","12893240"," This is the rotation into it."
"12899640","12901980"," This is communication suppression sector."
"12904140","12905520"," Come on spy. "
"12906620","12909420"," Get down to 416 so I can buy a huge dip."
"12911860","12914620"," Give me like three down days, baby."
"12915620","12917220"," So I can buy a face ripper. "
"12942540","12944200"," IWM is testing."
"12944360","12947460"," It's five minute charts, 27 EMA right now."
"12947520","12949120"," It's sitting right on the edge. "
"12951140","12955780"," Dixie coming up to test the top of it's 27 EMA right now."
"12963920","12972300"," Oh, oh, come on."
"12972440","12973180"," Just rug pull. "
"12973380","12974680"," I'll be in for like five minutes."
"12974680","12979620"," Let's need a quick and fast rug pull on IWM."
"12979840","12980300"," Come on, baby. "
"12981740","12983640"," Ooh, cue the bearer music."
"12985560","12987260"," Oh, I got it in the background."
"12987980","12989060"," It's not there yet. "
"12989200","12992240"," It needs like a candle below and then one more candle rejection."
"12992560","12995500"," It needs like it's close."
"12996780","13001920"," It needs like one red candle here and then one more rejection candle here. "
"13003160","13004140"," Can't cue a close."
"13004480","13005420"," Not quite there yet."
"13007340","13008340"," Five minute chart. "
"13008680","13009920"," Ooh, there goes that bear."
"13010040","13011180"," Look at it right here in the five minute."
"13013620","13014860"," See right there, right?"
"13015140","13016020"," Oh, it's almost there. "
"13016300","13017020"," Fucking bears, man."
"13017140","13018000"," They want it so bad."
"13018200","13027980"," Oh, oh, oh, oh, bears trying to slam it down down and"

"13100350","13100590"," Hold on."
"13101470","13105070"," Let me pull your bull head up and give you a breath of fresh air."
"13105930","13107270"," I'm not going to drown you just yet. "
"13107510","13108230"," Hold on, you can breathe."
"13108470","13108870"," You can breathe."
"13109130","13109870"," Chill for a minute, bulls. "

"13190040","13191460"," Give me a low, bears."
"13192320","13193680"," Give me today's low. "
"13198460","13199760"," Maybe they need more music."
"13204760","13205760"," Come on, bears."
"13236370","13238290"," Got the disco lights on for the bears. "
"13239630","13240570"," Hold on, hold on, bears."
"13240850","13241190"," Hold on, bears."
"13241430","13242170"," Hold on, I got you covered. "
"13258400","13259380"," Fill me, hair bears."
"13297740","13304530"," I don't want to have to put on Tesla waiting room music for you."
"13304630","13305970"," Do I, bulls or bears?"

"13340060","13341480"," Oh, there's a bear wants right here, man. "
"13341640","13342480"," What a bear wants."
"13342780","13343580"," What a bear needs."
"13345800","13347040"," A bear wants. "
"13349580","13351400"," Oh, that's what a bear wants right there."
"13353900","13356940"," Bear wants this and then slam it down."
"13361840","13362980"," Trap some bulls. "
"13377650","13379490"," All right, let me put some of this stuff back up here."
"13380630","13382010"," I got to get serious again."
"13382370","13383110"," A whole lot of zigga there. "
"13383690","13392010"," I got that out, at least down away right there, just in the top right there."
"13393710","13406970"," I got"
"13406970","13407610"," the spinning mute."
"13407710","13409350"," We got the spinning music here. "
"13409490","13410470"," I was gonna turn that on."
"13410610","13411370"," Turn that on."
"13412450","13413490"," Turn this off. "
"13414510","13415550"," Turn that shit off."
"13419390","13421310"," So, where are we right now?"
"13421450","13423190"," Let's take a look at the chart right now."
"13423330","13424550"," Are we bullish or bearish here?"
"13424550","13432030"," If the fed phrase is 20 prices below the five minute 27 EMA price is 2748. "
"13432110","13437230"," Can't get bullish again until price gets above 42748."
"13437770","13442950"," We'll see if the bulls can pull it back together or we'll see if we're going to go back down"
"13442950","13446910"," there and find out if we have support down here or not to the downside."
"13450610","13453870"," Today's low, not retested as of yet. "
"13456550","13458830"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"13459370","13460570"," Get free daily points."
"13460950","13464210"," My inputs are up 20%, 30% right now. "
"13464630","13466340"," So, we'll see how they go."
"13466340","13471120"," So, up 20%, 30%."
"13471120","13473140"," My stops are going to have to come down likely. "
"13473580","13473800"," Hold on."
"13474880","13476060"," It's right about here."
"13486770","13488430"," Get ready for a little bit of blood. "
"13500160","13506120"," JPR, Jamie Diamond says, not particularly significant of the fed raises by 25 BPS."
"13506840","13507880"," I agree with that statement."
"13508320","13509300"," I don't know that it mattered. "
"13509560","13518180"," Well, I think the big matter in it is does selling bonds impact the stock market enough that you"
"13518180","13520540"," don't want to raise rates."
"13521960","13526380"," I think if there is no huge impact on the market, then you can raise 25 BPS."
"13526880","13528640"," I think it's fine to raise 25 BPS. "
"13530460","13531880"," I think they'll do that wait and see."
"13532260","13533620"," I agree with that, Diamond, on that one."
"13537730","13539610"," So, we're going to leave it on the five minute chart here. "
"13539650","13544070"," We're going to see if the bears get their cross or not."
"13544670","13545490"," It's right here."
"13547290","13548670"," Just so you can see it. "
"13551170","13558290"," I don't like this five minute flattening out right now particularly, but see if they'll get the tag"
"13558290","13558810"," right here."
"13558830","13566790"," You're going to be looking for this 42745 and this 42729 right now."
"13568590","13579210"," It makes"
"13579210","13580370"," more sense to just get 25. "
"13580370","13583450"," Yeah, I'm down with 25 BPS right now."
"13584210","13591730"," I think the only thing that they were looking for was does panic get caused in the market from T "
"13591730","13592070","-bills."
"13592490","13596330"," If it does, do you then raise the 25 BPS?"
"13596810","13598590"," I think that's the terminal rate too. "
"13599290","13600410"," I think it's like the last one."
"13600490","13602750"," It's like the last of their gunpowder for some time period."
"13603170","13604650"," So, it's like when do you use it?"
"13605750","13606710"," Do you save it or not?"
"13608950","13610250"," I'm almost going to be flat here. "
"13610750","13613290"," So, we'll see if we'll see if I get stopped out of here or not."
"13613890","13616830"," See if there's a continuation of the downside for the bears."
"13619670","13620630"," Come on bears. "

"15553410","15554310"," Oh, you know what I was thinking of doing?"
"15554630","15559510"," I'll be honest, I was thinking about giving it away to someone, like doing a raffle or something in"
"15559510","15560830"," the discord and giving away to somebody. "
"15561970","15566530"," Somebody wanted it to come drive out here, come pick it up or something, or if they're nearby and"
"15566530","15570570"," they're interested, do like a trading challenge or something and just give it away."
"15572410","15576630"," And I said, now, of course, I do all this work to get it to sell it."
"15576670","15578710"," I'm like, yeah, I'll take that thing out and sale it. "
"15581910","15583330"," I'm like, yeah, I'm not done here."
"15583330","15598380"," And then I'm"
"15598380","15605080"," trying to do like a bunch of like registrations and like a bunch of like legal stuff."
"15605280","15611220"," You know, like a big thing about this is like in the background, this stuff you guys don't see is"
"15611220","15616260"," that I don't want to be a furu and I don't, I got some rules, man. "
"15616420","15620360"," Like there are people in this stream that know me outside of the stream."
"15621320","15623940"," People know me from the discord outside of the discord."
"15623980","15631440"," People know me privately and I have like one of my partners is Joe Donut. "
"15631720","15635800"," He is my he's my he's my he's my my ethics officer."
"15636220","15636740"," There's a better net."
"15636880","15642020"," There's a name for him, but he has a proper name, but I don't want to get in trouble with"
"15642020","15642400"," the SEC. "
"15642900","15644360"," I don't want to get in trouble with FINRA."
"15645500","15653580"," I don't want anyone that does this with me to do nefarious shit and I don't ever want it to"
"15653580","15660660"," turn into that, you know, and so I have attorneys, right, making sure that people won't do that"
"15660660","15663220"," kind of stuff that I won't do that kind of stuff."
"15663480","15668660"," I think it's, you know, when it's not in front of you, it's it's easy to say I'm not that"
"15668660","15673240"," person, but when it gets put in front of you, it's kind of like when they could cocaine in front"
"15673240","15675860"," of somebody and you got people that'll try it. "
"15676220","15677820"," You got people that'll do it only."
"15677820","15681060"," If it's there, you got people that'll never try it."
"15682060","15684160"," You have people that should never have it in front of them. "
"15685400","15689060"," And until it's in front of you, you don't know what your answer is going to be to that question,"
"15689280","15689340"," right?"
"15689720","15691080"," I think that goes along with hating in life."
"15692080","15700260"," And so you never want to like set up something that could be turned into nefarious future problems"
"15700260","15701240"," for you down the road."
"15701340","15709780"," And then furthermore, if we can switch from an educational type thing to a hedge fund someday of"
"15709780","15715060"," some kind of small fund or something like that, I don't want to set it up for that kind of"
"15715060","15715360"," failure. "
"15716320","15718820"," Or you just like a fucking pump and dump room or that kind of shit."
"15719100","15724040"," So and I don't know that it goes there, but when you start from square one, from previous"
"15724040","15732220"," businesses that have been involved in, whether they succeed or fail, you set them up for for doing"
"15732220","15733440"," the right thing from the get go."
"15733440","15744110"," So only"
"15745490","15748990"," two days is great to vote when you buy it and then you want to sell it. "
"15752550","15757310"," Yeah, they never, no matter what size they are, they always cost you money."
"15758010","15759350"," They're never fucking cheap."
"15760010","15765670"," Like a small boat, well, more boat is more expensive, but even a small boat is expensive. "
"15772800","15776640"," H-Y-G bullish, VIX finding its legs right now."
"15777540","15788680"," I-W-M just skating across to the side, U-S-O holding itself up, Dixie holding itself up, NDX,"

"15795980","15798680"," Okay, we're live on this side."
"15803550","15805750"," Jamie Diamond yelling how great America is."
"15807130","15808710"," That's some creepy ass shit, right?"
"15808850","15809530"," What these guys do?"
"15811390","15814910"," Like everybody knows anything, yet everybody does know something. "
"15815270","15820070"," I mean, I know that that's a conspiracy theory that everybody else was involved in it."
"15820250","15821770"," It's kind of like scummy, too."
"15821970","15823750"," It's like Epstein weaved himself. "
"15824430","15833050"," Do you guys know, I mean, outside the conspiracy stuff, uh, it's like Epstein is like, um, you"
"15833050","15838930"," know, I don't want to say Elon is like this, but when you're wealthy, when you're like extremely"
"15838930","15846210"," wealthy, you become more and more segregated from people, right?"
"15846950","15848810"," Who are your real friends, that kind of stuff?"
"15849050","15851030"," And it gets worse as you become more wealthy."
"15852610","15854710"," And worse and worse and worse and worse."
"15855090","15861310"," And then once you've accomplished everything you want to accomplish in life, uh, you want to be"
"15861310","15869270"," loved by people and different, different successful wealthy people express that in different ways. "
"15870850","15878390"," And that they want that acceptance, you'll see, successful wealthy people will, like you see Elon"
"15878390","15879470"," doing it with Twitter, right?"
"15879470","15882930"," You get, do you guys know that's kind of, there's a, there's a portion of that that has to do"
"15882930","15885510"," with wanting to be loved by people, right?"
"15885650","15886770"," He's already accomplished everything else."
"15887390","15891890"," One of his goals is to be loved by the masses, whether, whether you agree or hate that or whatever"
"15891890","15894510"," it doesn't matter, you have to identify that that's there, right?"
"15896930","15905910"," And Epstein is like the scumbag who's wealthy and he knows that he can put, uh, people together,"
"15906190","15906350"," right?"
"15906550","15912830"," Like a professor or an engineer with a very wealthy and influential person that can like on a dime"
"15913300","15914690"," change that person's life."
"15915370","15922090"," So if you're a professor at a university and you have no funding and Epstein would introduce you to"
"15922090","15926450"," let's say a VC of some kind that could change your life. "
"15926690","15934170"," And so he like interweaved himself inside of a different groups of people and poisoned all these"
"15934170","15934590"," people."
"15935270","15940950"," And now of course, whether they were or were not involved in anything really fucking nefarious,"
"15942170","15944350"," you're poisoned by being around him, right?"
"15949090","15950850"," Which is kind of fucking gross, right?"
"15951130","15952590"," You're like, it's really gross."
"15952970","15958710"," And you also know that if you are wealthy in any kind of way to shape or form or have,"
"15958950","15965610"," if you're from that, if you're from that socioeconomic background anyway, you and I both know a"
"15965610","15974090"," hundred percent that, uh, that lifestyle is not the same as other people. "
"15974970","15983770"," You and I both know that our experiences are completely different than the rest of, you know, the U "
"15983770","15987270",".S. Even people that think they have, it's weird."
"15988470","15989590"," It's a really weird thing."
"15990850","15995530"," So, you can see it, right?"
"15995990","15997910"," You can see it sometimes when people talk to you that are wealthy. "
"15998430","16003490"," You can tell if they come from wealth, if they're new money, how they talk and how they act and"
"16003490","16004090"," things like that."
"16009530","16014590"," Yeah, Tomás knows he's a millionaire, billionaire matchmaker with scientists, interesting geniuses"
"16014590","16015730"," who needed funding, absolutely."
"16017930","16023470"," And so, of course, that poison is, you know, once that poison is there, it can be used by powerful"
"16023470","16028430"," people to poison the wealth or any of those people whenever they want, right?"
"16028650","16029130"," Like Jamie Diamond. "
"16030290","16034350"," I don't know, and I don't think Jamie Diamond's done anything wrong in real life."
"16036450","16040050"," There's nothing to say that he did, but of course, he's gonna get dragged through, right?"
"16040190","16041390"," Everybody's gonna get dragged through for that."
"16041610","16045910"," And anyone that was involved or sought, they're gonna try to hold accountable and sue, of course,"
"16046090","16046230"," right?"
"16049170","16053670"," And some of you out there, I know that some of you out there are musicians, right?"
"16053810","16055570"," Some of you are a real-life professional musicians. "
"16056350","16059950"," I know that some of you out there are professional actors and directors."
"16061350","16063610"," I know that you guys know when you're around powerful people."
"16064730","16067590"," You know that the sometimes nefarious shit goes on in the background. "
"16068110","16068710"," It's what it is."
"16069470","16070430"," It's part of it, right?"
"16072810","16074690"," I have seen didn't kill himself."
"16075430","16077250"," I think he probably did kill himself. "
"16078670","16079590"," And I think he did."
"16080330","16085270"," I don't think, I don't think, I think Sue decides an option for a lot of people."
"16086250","16090950"," I think when people know that that that's it, send the road for them for themselves that they get"
"16090950","16091190"," there. "
"16092690","16096810"," Right or wrong, I don't know, but I've seen didn't kill himself."
"16101890","16103770"," It's him, a professional wanker."
"16106410","16109830"," Yeah, I don't know. "
"16110030","16111290"," Like I didn't really notice it."
"16111430","16112930"," I was never wealthy growing up."
"16113110","16123030"," So I want you to know that I grew up, my father had the benefit of military service"
"16123030","16125090"," and connected disabilities. "
"16125870","16131790"," He was in the airborne and he was blown up in Vietnam and then he had a great job and"
"16131790","16132670"," then he had a great retirement."
"16133050","16134370"," He invested all his money."
"16134810","16135950"," We lived a good life growing up. "
"16136090","16138970"," It wasn't, it was real middle class, real upper middle."
"16139170","16143710"," I guess maybe today is upper middle class, but back then like true middle class family."
"16144510","16146670"," I've had different times in my life where I've been poor. "
"16147530","16153910"," As an adult, been all over the place, but I have lived in very wealthy places with very wealthy"
"16153910","16154250"," friends."
"16155030","16157530"," Very small communities are very wealthy people for decades."
"16158490","16160690"," And those are my my true friends in real life. "
"16164350","16165590"," That's that's my experience."
"16166090","16169230"," I have seen is still alive."
"16169770","16174750"," I don't know, you know, it's a different world for a lot of these people. "
"16174890","16175850"," I will agree with that, right?"
"16175930","16177430"," It's a different world, 100%."
"16182010","16185730"," As a matter of fact, I've seen owned a property right in there where I live."
"16187070","16190150"," People talked down about New Mexico, but it's full of wealthy people. "
"16190610","16191130"," Very wealthy."

"16410650","16412470"," at least down here."
"16412750","16422029"," You at least want to be a buyer at like, $4.24.50, you know, or a trade sideways, until"
"16422029","16425869"," you catch that next leg up, right?"
"16425869","16433450"," Or if it happens faster, to make your way down to the daily trigger, which is what a bear wants"
"16433450","16434270"," down here, right?"
"16434410","16437150"," That $4.18. And this every day this moves up, right?"
"16437730","16440990"," The more time we spend, the higher the bottom becomes, right?"
"16442210","16444450"," The higher the bottom becomes as we spend time there. "
"16445070","16446830"," Now, just looking at this stuff here, right?"
"16450800","16456000"," Like a high conviction trade, what am I trying to buy down here, right?"
"16456640","16459140"," Just look at it down here, trying to buy that big bottom down there."
"16459220","16462840"," I'm trying to buy that big bottom, and I'm trying to catch it when it's coming up."
"16463700","16464660"," Can you buy this?"
"16464939","16467400"," Yeah, you can buy that, but it doesn't really show much. "
"16467900","16470560"," See that consolidation happening?"
"16471700","16472900"," Like all this bullshit in here?"
"16473980","16475140"," It's kind of garbage, right?"
"16476680","16479460"," And then down here, here's a clean buy right here."
"16479640","16481240"," Here's a clean buy right here."
"16481919","16493180"," And we're not quite there yet, so we're either looking at, we're"
"16493180","16498960"," either looking at time on the trade long time, sideways trading sideways. "
"16502770","16509490"," We're either looking for a sideways trade here, or we're looking for more blood, right?"
"16509810","16515990"," You have the first bearish tag, then the roll under until we actually get extremely bearish down"
"16515990","16516210"," here."
"16516790","16518810"," And that's like the safe trade for a bull."
"16519029","16522849"," Until you get that, there's no conviction trade here for a bull. "
"16523310","16528529"," And if anything, the bears have sold this top up here, and they're looking for more blood to the"
"16528529","16528830"," downside."
"16529490","16531849"," They're going to look to push down, push down, push down."
"16533849","16539750"," Now, with that, all of that said there, every time we break above this hourly, I'll take that"
"16539750","16540009"," trade. "
"16540849","16541710"," I'm long, right?"
"16542390","16546849"," And right now heading into this bell, you can see the blood in the marketplace."
"16550930","16552110"," 42369 down there."
"16555689","16557689"," And I'm still long puts here. "

"17457160","17462300"," 30 million, 26 million, 30 million, 36 million, so 30 million. "
"17462880","17463140"," 427."
"17465540","17471220"," And the other key part here is the number of puts and calls as high as fuck."
"17476980","17478740"," I shared this link with you this morning. "
"17478820","17480240"," I'll share it with you again right now."

"17611730","17613490"," Do we close exactly 427?"
"17615030","17616090"," I'm going to bet that we do."
"17628120","17630180"," Yeah, Binky's agreeing with me here in the background. "
"17630580","17631100"," I agree, Binky."
"17632260","17633620"," I showed that this morning."
"17634820","17637400"," I got people texting me about John McCaffee. "
"17637960","17640100"," Oh, saying that he said abstaining comes up."
"17640220","17641680"," McCaffee is a crazy motherfucker too."
"17643440","17646720"," I'm going to run this shit back and forth right into the bell, just like this. "
"17648120","17649860"," Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham."
"17650060","17650600"," Thank you for playing."
"17653540","17655520"," John McCaffee was crazy as fuck two. "
"17655660","17656600"," He was a methodic too."
"17657380","17660000"," He's crazy as, I don't believe anything he says either."
"17660260","17662740"," He's fucking crazy as crazy can be. "
"17663620","17664760"," Another crazy person."
"17665940","17667900"," Anything that comes out his mouth is a lie."
"17676810","17678210"," You guys want to know what happens throughout?"
"17678370","17679450"," It's 2.15 in the afternoon. "
"17684350","17685430"," Let's get the one hour."
"17692040","17692900"," You need that right there."
"17696550","17697530"," Nothing has changed. "
"17698490","17699830"," Nothing has changed from Friday."
"17700210","17700890"," Nothing has changed."
"17702370","17703690"," So he got Friday right here. "
"17703690","17704550"," It was Monday, right?"
"17704770","17709250"," Monday, Friday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday."
"17709470","17710230"," Nothing has changed."
"17711510","17721210"," There is no trade for the bulls unless we trade above 430. "
"17722590","17723570"," No trade for the bulls."
"17727790","17729590"," We know the sellers are coming down."
"17729850","17731310"," We know the sellers came down again today. "
"17733110","17738410"," We know the sellers are going to want to come back down on this right here and tomorrow."
"17738570","17740110"," Try to take this down some more."
"17740750","17743750"," Day one down, day one sideways, day one down on Wednesday. "
"17744490","17747710"," Hopefully the bulls can get a dip to buy for Friday to get back up here."
"17758590","17759590"," Nothing has changed."
"17761610","17764050"," Same as it was on Friday, same as it was today. "
"17765310","17767890"," Bears want to be selling this down into Wednesday."
"17768470","17772630"," That's their last chance of the longer that we trade sideways here."
"17773250","17778610"," The better the chances of us making a move higher into Friday, a little more consolidation. "
"17779090","17783090"," We have the more of a chance that we go up, not down, believe it or not."
"17783810","17788690"," We need to see selling usually quickly on these consolidations."
"17788990","17793730"," Long consolidations do not usually resolve to the downside. "
"17794670","17795890"," It typically resolves to the upside."
"17798070","17799890"," So we don't want to see this more down."
"17799950","17802610"," I want to see this more down. "
"17802610","17804870"," Trends just coming up right now."
"17805790","17807430"," Don't like seeing that as a bear."
"17808070","17810290"," You don't want to see this right here. "
"17810470","17814530"," And you've also got that four 16 daily trend down below."
"17821110","17825210"," Last chance for bears will be tomorrow."
"17825870","17827770"," They get one more chance on a down day. "
"17828290","17835230"," If they do not get this down day tomorrow down here, they can't get this right."
"17837830","17839530"," And we keep trading this sideways."
"17840570","17841730"," The move is up. "
"17842670","17847090"," The trade for the bulls is between four 20."
"17847330","17849490"," Well, there's a trade here to the upside for bulls."
"17850430","17852830"," And there's a big trade to four 40. "
"17853850","17855970"," I am still on bull camp overall."
"17856910","17859130"," Though I am looking for that consolidation to the downside."
"17859610","17860790"," And I want to get the cheapest price possible. "
"17861570","17865350"," I fucking hate, let me honest with you, I fucking hate chasing FOMO bulls."
"17865850","17866570"," Can't stand it."
"17868710","17872170"," It drives me insane to catch FOMO bulls. "
"17872530","17879590"," So I want to see the blood in this close, which is doubtful I'm going to get."
"17881090","17887850"," Or at least into Wednesday tomorrow to the downside so that I can buy a dip for the next leg"
"17887850","17888390"," higher."
"17892670","17894030"," Yeah, nothing's changed, man. "
"17894330","17895370"," Like nothing has changed."
"17895730","17900010"," I was on the phone this weekend with a friend and I was like, I could not stream this whole"
"17900010","17900550"," next week."
"17902330","17903830"," All my friends are on vacation. "
"17904190","17906290"," Everybody I know if I wasn't streaming, I'd be gone."
"17906870","17910290"," I would be on vacation right now."
"17912330","17918550"," And I'm still looking for that four 40 tag above if we can consolidate for that four 40. "
"17918910","17919110"," I am."
"17919550","17920870"," I'm looking for higher in July."
"17921150","17922630"," I'm looking for a major high there in July. "
"17922630","17933900"," I'm going to buy four 40"
"17933900","17934180"," calls."
"17934520","17935460"," No, you don't buy them now."
"17935640","17936460"," Like timing is important. "
"17937520","17938720"," You need proof of concept."
"17938860","17939920"," Like you don't buy them here."
"17942520","17945680"," That's not that trades on the table for me right now. "
"17955340","17956380"," You gotta get a Tesla."
"17973530","17974670"," Tesla looks great."
"17975150","17976930"," Tesla is looking for an up move. "
"17978170","17979690"," I like Tesla a ton."
"17984750","17986770"," Tesla nothing's changed here in test."
"17986950","17992490"," You have the hourly trigger the one five minute and the hourly coming up and breaking above the"
"17992490","17993710"," monthly on Tesla. "

"17997930","18002690"," 89 right now as long as Tesla stays above two 16 95."
"18003810","18005430"," The move is to the upside. "
"18005910","18007410"," I gave you previous targets above."
"18007950","18009630"," You know where my targets are."
"18009630","18014850"," I got a 290 300 as the first target and the second target's 350. "
"18017530","18019630"," I'm a big Tesla fan right now."
"18023770","18033570"," If we do break and reject Tesla at two 16 90 or so if we begin to reject"
"18033570","18040130"," there your next dip buy on Tesla is going to be at about 200 about 200 bucks somewhere in there"
"18040130","18040690"," right around 200."
"18042590","18044010"," Still bullish on Tesla. "
"18044510","18044890"," Nothing's changed."
"18049520","18057720"," Yeah, you're welcome."
"18057860","18059060"," No worries, liana got your brother. "
"18060240","18062120"," Nothing has changed my outlook on Tesla."
"18062300","18064620"," If I see anything, I'll let you know."
"18065580","18071900"," You have daily on your side big time right now in Tesla big time and you have daily crossing the"

"18155070","18157850"," I won't chase it, but I will jump on it above here."
"18159390","18166210"," And even then you see how like even even then the trade higher is only to 430."
"18166730","18168610"," You know, it's not it's not that big of a run. "
"18168710","18169810"," There's another leg above it."

"18818670","18819030"," I'm interested."
"18819370","18820550"," Let's look at Sholes real quick."
"18828330","18830330"," I'm interested in Sholes here. "
"18846430","18848770"," So there's this consolidation trade."
"18848970","18850810"," We've been watching this ticker called Sholes."
"18855070","18857470"," And this is where it's at right now, right?"
"18858750","18861330"," We're watching this consolidation here. "
"18862970","18866890"," There I'll delete them."
"18868710","18874770"," And we're now kind of at that entry point, the next next entry point on it."
"18876070","18880770"," And I'm interested with reaction here, like a buy stop here. "
"18881390","18882610"," I don't like this."
"18882870","18883650"," I don't like the hourly."
"18885550","18891190"," So I think that Sholes actually bleeds down slightly and then there's a dip buy. "
"18892150","18893890"," And then we actually get the run higher."
"18894170","18899370"," So 22 bucks, 2250 somewhere in here."
"18899490","18900610"," Keep your eyes on this. "
"18901030","18907110"," I want to see the trend come down just a little bit more for a dip buy, but this is"

"18911250","18912570"," Ultimately, I'm bullish on it. "
"18913330","18914750"," It's a little long in the tooth."
"18916450","18923330"," You can see though that previous history, if we break here, it can get pretty nasty and ugly."
"18923650","18927250"," So I don't want to get caught in that nasty ugliness. "
"18927510","18928570"," Like I don't want to get caught."
"18928690","18935070"," We have a previous high previous low, but I don't want to see Sholes do to start bloodbath on this"
"18935070","18935610"," down here."
"18935610","18936070"," Get it. "
"18936350","18939190"," Catch a new low at $16."
"18940230","18943230"," Just keep your eyes on on Sholes."

"18947170","18948950"," Two, three, four, five."
"18950070","18952430"," I'm a little wary to buy this one here."
"18952810","18955010"," So I want to see what its interplay is. "
"18955030","18961150"," I want to see if it breaks below and it breaks below here and starts to reject the downside."
"18962030","18963410"," Just keep your eyes on Sholes."
"18964510","18967210"," I'm not really a fan of buying this one just yet. "

"18972150","18973710"," We got Duolingo. "
"18975370","18976210"," Can't stop."
"18976430","18976930"," Won't stop."
"18977370","18983070"," Starting to get a little long in the tooth has more room to run higher. "
"18983490","18984490"," No buy in right now."

"19004970","19007030"," It's at $26.10 or so."

"19868300","19870080"," To have an edge as a stock buy. "
"19870260","19873240"," And this is specifically how things have become in the stock market."
"19873880","19875700"," For you to like outperform other people."
"19877300","19880840"," You're looking for it on a down day tickers that are up. "
"19881280","19884320"," So if we're having a bad day like we're down, I don't know, 70 points."
"19885360","19885880"," 30 points."
"19886700","19887100"," 100 points. "
"19888580","19891620"," You want to identify a ticker that is up on those days."
"19892370","19896640"," And then performs when the market is up."
"19897460","19900160"," You also want to identify a ticker. "
"19900940","19903140"," That is sold."
"19904300","19906180"," For a bullshit reason."
"19907800","19909220"," On an update. "
"19910740","19913200"," Not on a down day and an update, right?"
"19915720","19917680"," So that you can capture."
"19919560","19920920"," More than normal."
"19922440","19923300"," Does that make sense?"
"19924080","19925500"," I don't know if it does or it doesn't. "
"19926680","19928840"," So if you get like the outsized return."
"19930240","19932280"," That doesn't trade with the market."
"19933780","19938080"," You're not just I mean, I was looking at snap the other day or a month ago or two. "
"19938500","19942220"," I'm like, yes, snap hasn't given the returns that NVDA has."
"19942860","19945860"," But it has followed the same pattern all the way up."
"19946960","19952920"," So it's like, yeah, does it matter if I'm trading snap or Apple or NVDA?"
"19954700","19960020"," When you really want like that one, like move down where it's not following the rest of the market"
"19960020","19961560"," and then you can jump on it. "
"19961620","19968400"," If it's not real bad news, like fake bad news intentional to take profit and buy another dip."
"19968940","19970820"," You want to like try to find those tickers."
"19970820","19975560"," So when you're calling them out, you're not like when you call them out, you're like, hey, man,"
"19975560","19976340"," this one right here. "
"19977560","19980340"," So we're not like a top or the middle of a trade."
"19980820","19984500"," Like you want to be oftentimes when you guys call tickers to me."
"19984780","19989340"," It's never that is sometimes like 30% of the time, 20% of the time. "
"19990540","19995880"," I'll get like a ticker that's on a top rolling over, which is outstanding or a ticker that's a"
"19995880","19997420"," bottom being bought."
"19997420","20004660"," So if we're on trend day or sideways day and it's already happening, yeah, you can check in on"
"20004660","20005280"," those tickers."
"20005280","20011460"," But you really are trying to identify on a day where it shouldn't be down or it is down on"
"20011460","20015880"," an up day where the market's trading sideways and it's heavily down that day. "
"20018260","20022420"," Like a ticker that's that's trading the opposite of whatever the day is doing."
"20024640","20025780"," Does that make sense to you?"
"20027760","20028600"," Yeah, dude."
"20028840","20036500"," We're trading 4.27.66. They got a massive a massive pin in this market at 4.27 for the"
"20036500","20036680"," bell. "
"20037160","20038420"," It's kind of gross here."
"20041540","20046160"," I'm watching these 4.28s. They're just like 20 cents."
"20047240","20052980"," They were 18 cents, like 15 minutes ago, and I'm like, oh, man, you're giving pennies away. "
"20057010","20059550"," They pay some fucking calls or some puts."
"20063360","20067260"," But try to think about that when you're calling out tickers is my point."
"20067580","20072740"," Like you really want to that's how you get an edge as a stock buyer or even a seller. "
"20073160","20078140"," Like if you're if you're a sell side on stocks, if you're a buy side on stocks, you're an investor."
"20079440","20081000"," You need to be looking for those things."
"20081840","20085380"," If you hear some like when I hear someone say like, how's this ticker doing?"
"20086140","20087640"," Like here's a prime example. "
"20087780","20088260"," We'll do Amazon."
"20089160","20091780"," No offense to the Amazon long or anything like that."
"20096810","20097610"," Look at Amazon. "
"20098190","20100890"," It's like number one Amazon kind of trades with cues, right?"
"20104800","20110140"," But like I want to be asked about Amazon key point here is I want to be asked about Amazon."
"20115440","20116640"," Like right here."
"20120100","20121740"," That's where I want to be asked about Amazon. "
"20122500","20123180"," Like right there."
"20124840","20130980"," Like when Amazon the ticker is bloodbath, I think it's straight down."
"20131140","20131600"," Does that make sense?"
"20133040","20135900"," If you're asking about Amazon when to take profit on Amazon. "
"20138080","20139820"," Or like how is Amazon doing?"
"20146600","20148480"," There's a dip buy in the hourly down here."
"20148480","20151900"," 124.83 right to go higher for continuation."
"20153200","20155140"," So is there a dip buy right now on Amazon?"
"20155680","20155820"," No. "
"20158000","20159900"," Is there a target if you're already long?"
"20160120","20160600"," Yeah, there is."
"20160700","20163460"," There's like 130 to the upside."
"20164760","20165720"," Conservative Republican. "
"20165900","20169440"," For me as a buyer, I want to be buying it right today at this moment."
"20169460","20177180"," I want to buy 125.39. I want to buy 122.65. I want to buy 115.45. I don't"
"20177180","20180080"," want to get caught in a rollover here."
"20180460","20181000"," Does that make sense?"
"20182260","20184760"," I want to put risk on like real money on. "
"20186240","20187220"," Like down here."
"20188020","20189180"," That's where I want to put real money."
"20189280","20193740"," I want to put real risk on with a stop underneath it and get an explosive move to the upside"
"20194200","20196080"," so that I don't care about all this stuff. "
"20197020","20201720"," And I don't care that we're here and I can look for the role and have more time to put"
"20201720","20203180"," a stop on Amazon."
"20203860","20204360"," Does that make sense?"
"20204780","20205400"," I don't know what that does or does."
"20205400","20207360"," I don't want to try to sound like a..."
"20207360","20209580"," I'm not trying to come off as like..."
"20209580","20211240"," I don't like Amazon here. "
"20211380","20211520"," I do."
"20211820","20212500"," I like Amazon here."
"20213000","20214360"," I like it as a day trade, right?"
"20215040","20223020"," So if I'm trading Amazon, I can buy this right now and try to trade this to 127.43. I"
"20223020","20224160"," can buy a dip down here. "
"20225120","20227120"," But how long does that trade?"
"20227340","20228700"," Does it go to 130?"
"20229400","20230060"," I don't know."
"20230200","20230800"," I don't really care."
"20231460","20235300"," I care more about being the first guy in much lower. "
"20235640","20236120"," Does that make sense?"
"20236260","20237320"," I want to be in down here."
"20237840","20239140"," You can actually see it down here, right?"
"20239680","20241140"," See the dip buys down below."
"20241580","20242760"," Are we at a dip buy in Amazon?"
"20243060","20243160"," No. "
"20244240","20244720"," Oh, yeah."
"20244900","20245600"," Take the profit."
"20245820","20247080"," Take the money and run. "
"20247520","20248360"," Like see right here."
"20248860","20251620"," As long calls down here, I would have been losing money, right?"
"20252660","20253420"," Get sold down."
"20253660","20254220"," Get free data. "
"20254260","20255020"," Get sold down."
"20255300","20256000"," And I don't like that."
"20256300","20258540"," I don't like the trade setup. "
"20258540","20260540"," I need 10 great trades."
"20260800","20262400"," I don't need one great trade."
"20262460","20265460"," I need 10 in a row, nine in a row, eight in a row. "
"20274110","20276010"," Or at least a stop underneath it."
"20278210","20279950"," So like Amazon's good there."
"20281010","20282650"," For me, I wouldn't buy there. "
"20283910","20286690"," Trading 22 cents and 428 C's right now."
"20287510","20289170"," Now four pennies on 18."
"20299050","20299770"," No payments. "
"20300150","20301830"," No money inside the options, Shane."
"20315660","20316220"," Yeah, yeah."
"20316480","20317920"," There's like a dip buy there. "
"20318320","20321500"," But I mean, like right now, I'm telling like that this moment, like you're taking a check on this."
"20321760","20322880"," I don't know exactly what the."
"20323580","20324740"," If you're looking for like, should I sell here?"
"20324900","20325220"," Buy here. "
"20326280","20326680"," Take 25."
"20327060","20327800"," Like right where we are."
"20328580","20329480"," You take 25. "
"20329760","20332340"," You take 75% off and you let 25% runners go to 130."
"20332720","20333140"," That's the answer."
"20333500","20334560"," If you did buy yesterday. "
"20336480","20346890"," Yeah, it's"
"20346890","20347750"," not that we don't."
"20347870","20348710"," It's not that we don't."
"20348830","20349370"," It's not that we don't. "
"20349370","20350470"," It's not that we don't blast to 430."
"20350930","20351710"," Well, if we were to."
"20351810","20352390"," So how about this?"
"20352850","20353890"," I'll rephrase it again. "
"20354970","20356650"," Well, we can go over this all day long."
"20356650","20357750"," I like going over this stuff."
"20357970","20358270"," So. "
"20359270","20360110"," Go over it again."
"20362850","20363250"," Ready?"
"20367030","20369250"," If you bought the dip down here, right?"
"20369690","20371210"," Did you take profit up here or not?"
"20371770","20372650"," You should have."
"20374910","20379490"," And you can you can rebuy this on the one and five minute for an upside move. "
"20379710","20381470"," Are you now in lower calls or not?"
"20382290","20385590"," Like you should have taken profit up here on this previous high."
"20386750","20387190"," Right?"
"20387850","20391270"," And then if we regain the one and five minute, you reenter for calls."
"20391910","20392470"," Does that make sense?"
"20393430","20396330"," So if I buy a call for one dollar, I sell it for five. "
"20397490","20398370"," I take the money and run."
"20398370","20402310"," And then if my position, if my thesis is we're going to 430."
"20403250","20405710"," I then buy 430 calls for cheaper, right?"
"20407130","20407970"," Does it make sense?"
"20409090","20412390"," So right now I'm looking for a new buy to go up here, right?"
"20413170","20414090"," New buy to go up here. "
"20414290","20418110"," If we break above here, I'll then reposition for 430s to the upside."
"20420010","20423370"," So yeah, yeah, I guess you can take this trade to 430, but."
"20424030","20426970"," Are you repositioned or you're along these same calls from down here?"
"20440890","20442530"," 27 on 18 right now. "
"20449180","20450140"," No, I don't."
"20454080","20456100"," No, I'm on 18 for 428."
"20465380","20467800"," I don't want them to roll up back down on me here. "
"20470140","20472260"," I got rolled twice today on puts."
"20472560","20476220"," Well, I have one set of puts that were up and down like fucking six cents."
"20476220","20481300"," That I was like up to like 14 cents, like down a six cents up to 14. "
"20482580","20487160"," I'm going to make these make these a winner trading 28 right now and 428."
"20498920","20501700"," 30 right now and 428 31 32."
"20505690","20507470"," I'm flat right now and 31. "
"20527530","20529550"," Super bullish on DIA, man."
"20531470","20534510"," I'm bullish on DIA and IWM right now."
"20570090","20571950"," Your beer balls are getting squeezed. "
"20578210","20594950"," This is"
"20594950","20595550"," fucking brutal."
"20595870","20596630"," Now I'm looking at them again."
"20596850","20600470"," They're now down at 28 cents and we're squeezing right now. "
"20602490","20603710"," Open the escape hatch."
"20606030","20608390"," I didn't get stopped out of my earlier puts."
"20608650","20611030"," I was still in them and then I got fuck at the end of the day. "
"20611030","20612310"," I got murdered like I was up."
"20613810","20616430"," I was up on I was up on puts here."
"20617490","20618590"," Got squeezed here. "
"20618690","20620390"," I was in a phone call went down here."
"20620550","20621590"," I was up again on puts."
"20621990","20626850"," I was at like 14 cents, I think down here and then I got stopped out right in here. "
"20628470","20633350"," Took the long side to the upside and just took the money there."
"20633350","20635610"," So still kind of a shitty day."
"20636090","20637950"," Not this is not what I like trading. "
"20638010","20639290"," There's not my favorite here."
"20646110","20648610"," Yeah, you bears got like one more day, man."
"20649350","20650830"," Few bears don't get this. "
"20651770","20653590"," You got one, two, three days."
"20654070","20657150"," One, two and three days of consolidation."
"20658870","20660030"," I don't know if you get Wednesday. "
"20661250","20661930"," One, two, three."
"20661930","20668030"," I mean, there's your three down days right there, right?"
"20672940","20674300"," What is going on with this?"
"20674900","20676820"," Having some real issues here today."
"20688820","20690260"," See it right there, right?"
"20691200","20692580"," Bring it over. "
"20696720","20699840"," One, two, boom down here."
"20701000","20701660"," Back up again."
"20701660","20707790"," Trying to break out. "
"20711800","20712860"," Get that move."
"20713780","20715180"," Bears not put it together."
"20715600","20716120"," Cell side. "
"20726620","20728540"," Not getting it done, dude."
"20729080","20729680"," Cell side."
"20729880","20730780"," Not getting it done. "
"20731840","20733440"," No joy for sellers."
"20736920","20738560"," You have all suppression, man."
"20740670","20741520"," Today was their day. "
"20741680","20742880"," They get one more chance, I think."
"20743820","20745540"," One more chance down here."
"20755950","20757790"," You don't get this many chances. "
"20757790","20760630"," This down here, man, this higher low, higher low."
"20761230","20762770"," Not looking good for bears."
"20766670","20768810"," This looks like bull market here. "
"20769810","20771770"," This looks like bull market, dude."
"20772750","20781210"," When you see three days like this in a bull market, three down days, woof."
"20781210","20783670"," I don't have any sense on the day already. "
"20787770","20789670"," Sellers not doing it."
"20804720","20806980"," Scene of the crime, man."
"20807340","20808020"," Ooh, baby. "
"20840190","20841330"," Hell no, dude."
"20841530","20844090"," You didn't hear me get smoked on puts earlier?"
"20845790","20848230"," I got smoked on puts earlier today."
"20848230","20851610"," I got smoked, dude. "
"20852170","20853370"," I got smoked."
"20855910","20858370"," I got smoked today in puts."
"20858590","20859850"," I got smoked right down here. "
"20861410","20862450"," Fucking crazy."
"20863390","20864530"," Took an L right here."
"20865830","20866070"," L."
"20867470","20868110"," Big fat L."
"20870250","20872430"," Six cents I think I closed the mat. "
"20881680","20883460"," Scene of the crime, baby."
"20891220","20893500"," I got waxed on puts today."
"20893540","20894380"," I got smoked. "
"20895220","20896600"," Let me see what I sold them for."
"20896740","20896940"," Hold on."
"20907840","20908920"," Four cents. "
"20912500","20914520"," Four 25p smoked."
"20921520","20925080"," I was up twice on that trade in stream."
"20926220","20927120"," Up twice. "

"21273430","21278870"," Where's the smart money buy in 190.29. But most of the guys in this stream are long since."

"21434640","21436260"," July two fifties, man. "
"21436540","21437960"," I would make it like July or August."
"21438300","21439320"," How cheap are they in August?"
"21443180","21445240"," Or even just some call spreads, man."
"21446820","21449480"," Like 250 call spreads for July. "
"21451200","21453480"," So if you get a rollover day, you'll still be up."
"21454280","21455600"," You won't get torched."
"21463080","21466900"," Yeah, IWM is just like, that's why I don't trade Disney anymore. "
"21467240","21468860"," It's why I don't trade, like I don't trade BA."
"21469520","21474200"," I used to trade, like I used to like day trade BA, day trade Disney."
"21475680","21476980"," But I can't stand it. "
"21477260","21478600"," IWM is the same way, right?"
"21478800","21480920"," They'll like gap that chip down and then they run it up."
"21480920","21485520"," And you watch it all day long for wherever it's going to go, right?"
"21485680","21486100"," Or down."
"21487140","21493460"," IWM is a nice like, if you get the tag to go long or short, you can leave it for"
"21493460","21494400"," like day or two. "

"21519900","21538320"," HYG just careening higher now trading 74.63. I think I"

"21548080","21549020"," Yep, I did."
"21555440","21556880"," I just fat finger to trade."
"21571000","21572080"," I closed it. "
"21575460","21577180"," I made two pennies."
"21579140","21584600"," I fat finger to 428 Cs."
"21590620","21594820"," Yeah, I got in, I think at 28 or 29 cents, the trade 31 cents for a minute. "
"21604140","21605580"," Yeah, they love it on IWM."
"21606520","21608400"," I was kind of pissed at that trade for IWM."
"21609340","21611100"," I wanted that 196 so bad. "
"21611100","21617900"," I wanted that like three day bar, like that three day IWM trade, where it just fucking rips faces"
"21617900","21619320"," off like three straight days."
"21620780","21623960"," I got one of the days, but not the, I didn't get today."
"21625000","21627780"," So I got, I got Friday, but I didn't get yesterday and today. "
"21628020","21629780"," So I'm kind of pissy about it."
"21655880","21657900"," Seeing all the crime up here."
"21659720","21677820"," Yeah, I"
"21677820","21677940"," did. "
"21678040","21678440"," I made money."
"21678520","21682560"," I made two pennies, but I didn't stay in the trade."
"21683100","21684220"," I didn't stay in it. "
"21685100","21686420"," I didn't want to make that trade."
"21686700","21689480"," So I don't want to trade one bar here, two bars for a penny or two."
"21699200","21701380"," Yeah, IWM man started rolling over. "
"21701480","21702400"," It hasn't gone back up yet."
"21702520","21702740"," Has it?"
"21703040","21703720"," It's been trading sideways."
"21712600","21715380"," I got IBM stopped going up at 1150, right?"
"21715380","21718480"," And we were talking about it trading, rolling over at that point. "
"21719340","21720260"," 1130 this afternoon."
"21720900","21723400"," So they've just been getting torched all day long if you're a long calls."
"21736420","21738020"," I could be crawling up into the bell. "
"21739340","21740800"," I don't, I'm not risking it."
"21742520","21743760"," I don't want the roll here."
"21743980","21744320"," It's 323. "
"21744620","21746000"," I don't want to see a roll here."
"21748100","21750600"," It's like this weird, like 426, 428."
"21751680","21754620"," It's 426, 428, 427 as a pin. "
"21760190","21761390"," I ain't taking that trade."
"21762710","21763550"," Fuck no."
"21764130","21765690"," I took part of this trade right here. "
"21765870","21767210"," I took this a little bit right here."
"21768530","21770510"," And then I fat fingered this trade right here."
"21771630","21773030"," But I closed it. "

"22636900","22637760"," Whoo."

"22662080","22665020"," There's got to be out of control right now. "
"22673050","22678930"," Yeah, so like 428, 426, 427 is the sweet spot."
"22679890","22685950"," And then we've got a huge concentration of calls at 435."
"22685950","22686790"," Let me look. "
"22689330","22690370"," Let me look real quick."
"22697530","22697930"," Whoa."
"22698150","22698410"," Hold on. "
"22698490","22699530"," Let me look at this, some of this stuff here."
"22699690","22699850"," Hold on."
"22701850","22707590"," Someone's in chat or Twitter right now saying, yeah, there's a 16.9% discount right now. "
"22708290","22710650"," I'm like, yeah, I agree with that."
"22710930","22712770"," But I get what you're saying."
"22714390","22719110"," If Vicks was at zero and had another 16% discount, what are we going?"
"22719110","22720810"," No, a negative Vicks maybe, I guess. "
"22722490","22727070"," Let me look at tomorrow's spread."
"22728270","22730810"," So tomorrow we've got puts at 416."
"22732590","22736910"," A huge, huge concentration of puts. "
"22737530","22739590"," I'm going to warn you into tomorrow right now, okay?"
"22740490","22741810"," You're going to get a warning for me."
"22743090","22747210"," You got a fucking huge concentration of puts at 420."
"22747210","22749390"," I got 420 at 416. "
"22751090","22758690"," You got some decent calls at 435 and 439."
"22759810","22762690"," And Vicks is at the bottom of the barrel."
"22763930","22765930"," Just a warning to you out there, okay?"
"22766870","22768590"," And maybe it's a strangle, man. "
"22769590","22770310"," Like a 435."
"22772670","22773790"," Like a 4."
"22774350","22775250"," Let me see if I have to see this."
"22775690","22778430"," 435, 440 and a 416. "
"22780250","22781810"," That's the spread for tomorrow."
"22782470","22788610"," Now, the pin says that the pin is at 426 for tomorrow."
"22789110","22789910"," Max Payne. "
"22790210","22797670"," But if we have destroyed all these puts for tomorrow, sometimes they make them print."
"22797670","22799730"," It might not be today, but it could be tomorrow."
"22799810","22801490"," I'd be really wary out here, guys. "
"22805280","22809480"," I know Vicks can go lower, but I'm talking about like a strangle here."

"23768120","23768320"," It does."
"23768760","23771120"," So if you type in E.S., the first return is the mini. "
"23772240","23778000"," And then if you hit return without touching it, it brings you to the, I think it's ever source or"
"23778000","23778680"," something like that."
"23779160","23782580"," Just seeing Bitcoin last up, five spot, six, six percent."
