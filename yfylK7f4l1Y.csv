"97610","98890"," Check one for you."
"113500","114700"," Good morning out there."
"129080","130820"," Okay, almost there. "
"134380","135760"," Right into it this morning."
"137000","138380"," All right, good morning."
"139800","141460"," Give me just a second here. "
"141920","142960"," A few things you got to do."
"148500","149520"," We got here."
"151740","154900"," All right, we're going to talk about a few things before the open this morning. "
"155820","160000"," We're going to look at some stuff as well in the background here for you."
"163080","165580"," Bring up the old trading view."
"165700","170620"," We're going to take out spy and Tesla this morning almost right away. "
"171160","175820"," We likely can predict some of the moves this morning, this Monday morning at some point."
"177060","180960"," So we're going to try to get this going really as fast as possible here."
"184000","186100"," I'm going to give you guys. "
"194360","197580"," 408.52 is a huge number this morning."
"200920","204060"," Actually tag the the Saturday."
"204300","207620"," I think a Saturday I gave you guys this this right here to be looking for. "
"210600","219620"," 408.52. Okay, so, um, 5.407 16."
"227770","230510"," I was moving everything over earlier."
"231010","241330"," I want you to know that right in here 408.52. Kind"
"241330","245230"," of a big deal for bulls right now where that little blue box is right there. "
"254300","265560"," And then our one is 409.32. Off"
"265560","266120"," the bell."
"273880","279880"," Just off the or just for this week we don't have real big huge or not expected huge range"
"279880","280400"," expansion."
"282120","284040"," Coming into the early part of this week. "
"285480","293900"," No, we've got our two at 410.59 or at least the options market is not expecting a huge move."
"293900","295920"," They're expecting a larger move later in the week."
"295920","300660"," Our three four twelve seventy five way up here. "
"303660","304960"," And then down below."
"308620","313580"," S one four seven seventeen four five eighty nine."
"316280","317200"," Press one. "
"318220","322360"," You can see some of this stuff is four three seventy three."
"326480","327540"," There's s two."
"328960","331500"," And then s three this morning is that. "
"333340","335680"," Some real walking is going on this morning."
"336140","338660"," My set up still my new set up is still not working."
"339440","340980"," Four of two forty six. "
"343780","349620"," Still just so you guys know you might see some weirdness this morning still still like still trying"
"349620","351360"," to work on the hardware solution here."
"351620","354940"," Just before just before open for you guys this morning."
"355560","360720"," So you know there's a there's a couple things you want to be looking at here this morning. "
"360720","363320"," We've got a nine minutes left."
"363320","370640"," So the first thing would be of course you see all of these gaps down below the market loves to"
"370640","371340"," close these gaps."
"371560","379280"," It'd be really nice to see those gaps get closed right off the bell. "
"379460","381440"," I don't know if that's going to happen."
"381960","387560"," I have a sneaking suspicion that we're going to go back up and retest the HD the H line above"
"387560","387980"," here."
"388480","394560"," Might squeeze up here and tag that then come back down and tag these below these gaps that we have"
"394560","395220"," down below here. "
"395280","396440"," So we do have some gaps down below."
"396480","398780"," We'll write those in right now."
"399600","401840"," Now we might just get off and running this morning. "
"401840","402800"," It's very possible."
"403380","406800"," And I'll show you why here in a few moments why you might opt you off and run them."
"406920","408680"," I don't like leaving them behind either. "
"408840","411540"," When we leave them behind we tend to come back to fill them."
"411700","415940"," We could fill them later in the week with the volatility that we have ahead of us."
"415940","420880"," Now we also have the closing price which is right where this gap is right here. "
"421380","424660"," We have the first previous low from."
"424820","428560"," This is your first one right there from yesterday."
"428560","432320"," So I've got these pivots above and below to close this morning. "
"432960","441360"," We're going to look at the one minute here and 408.52. Let me take a look at this right"
"441360","441560"," here."
"443560","445900"," On the one minute there's no gaps but there they are."
"445980","446860"," I promise you they're there. "
"449720","452140"," We'll just leave that as a nice small little box in here."
"452360","453940"," Bulls want to defend that completely."
"463080","464620"," There's some little gaps down here. "
"464740","467200"," Let me put a box in for those gaps that we see."
"469160","472460"," Just before the oval pop box in for these gaps down below."
"473760","481210"," And we'll make it like a dotted line so you know it and then we'll do a little fade like"
"481210","481470"," that. "
"482070","485230"," You can see where those gaps are on the one minute this morning."
"488660","489940"," And there's a couple gaps above."
"490220","491860"," Do you see one gap here in the one minute?"
"492000","492900"," There's a gap above here. "
"494060","501420"," And there's a pre-market high here at 409.54. If you want to know what I think is going"
"501420","505620"," to happen we'll take a look real quick at the spy here."
"507480","510020"," And we're going to talk about the spy this morning."
"510980","513240"," So already know what I could do is I'll bring it up here. "
"513960","515940"," Make it easy so you guys can see it."
"516200","518220"," We can even trade this today if you want to."
"518280","522600"," We can trade this chart today. "
"522720","524000"," Try this chart out if you want."
"524140","526520"," Let me know in the stream if you want to trade this chart today."
"527540","528820"," This is pretty big for the Bulls. "
"529060","530380"," I got to give it to him right now."
"530440","531640"," We're in the one minute chart right here."
"531660","535060"," We can trade this today and see how this works for you. "
"535060","535680"," It's pretty badass."
"538320","542560"," What we're looking for here is you're looking for, let me close this up here."
"545250","546910"," Get rid of this right here for you. "
"547830","549470"," It's kind of a big deal for the Bulls."
"549750","552890"," The Bulls, this is the green line here is the daily, okay?"
"553450","555490"," So you can see this is the daily right here."
"555970","560770"," And then down below we have, excuse me, this is the hourly, excuse me, this is the money line. "
"561590","563210"," So this is an hourly trigger right here."
"563210","565090"," Down below is the daily, okay?"
"565530","569170"," We bounced off the, you can see we hit in velocity."
"569170","570470"," We hit a bottom down here. "
"570590","574510"," If you look down below at the bottom of the screen, I see the bottom in velocity where my cursor"
"574510","577530"," is like the, Mr. Yang says, right?"
"578170","579250"," Viable bottom down here."
"579870","584970"," And this is like a viable and hold bottom down below in the daily trigger."
"585610","587850"," And we have a three trigger cluster right in here, right?"
"588090","592770"," And what Bulls want to do here, you see volatility take place when we hit these clusters. "
"592770","595610"," So we've got five minutes left."
"595890","598130"," What Bulls do need to do here is hold."
"598810","605950"," If Bulls can hold this hourly trigger here, it can trigger a sustainable rally. "
"607330","610210"," And you see this, you see this top up here."
"611150","613430"," This is back in pre-market, right?"
"614690","617770"," You could wind up seeing a blast up higher, come back down."
"619350","622310"," Till those gaps that we move even higher here in the open. "
"622690","627010"," Now, if we come back down here, close those gaps and we're off and running, we'll know it."
"627170","632450"," We'll see the one minute and the five minute come underneath to trade this higher."
"632690","636590"," If the bears are looking for some kind of rejection here in the early, we'll pay attention to that"
"636590","636810"," too. "
"637170","641950"," If we see a cross of price below the one in five minute, we'll trade it down too."
"642730","645230"," So we'll take a look at that this morning as well, right off the bell."
"645230","651330"," Now, if the Bulls can defend this hourly trigger, right, it's going to trigger a move higher, a"
"651330","655170"," substantial move higher, something that could be sustained, believe it or not. "
"656270","660410"," And we'll try to take a look back here and see what kind of a rally that can sustain."
"661250","662150"," And it's pretty massive."
"662430","669930"," I mean, in previous time periods, talking about a pretty nasty move higher here that can be"
"669930","670450"," sustained. "
"670450","679790"," And we also have weekly and monthly figures down below momentum, just screaming higher, right?"
"680610","684870"," Bears need to get underneath that to start getting that bear case on, right?"
"684990","690290"," Get underneath that daily moving average, get underneath that weekly, get underneath that monthly"
"690290","694250"," and until they do, and that's below right now, it's now higher."
"694890","699830"," It's now at 397 and 396 flat."
"700510","705190"," Bears have a ton of work to do for them to start calling for that bear case. "
"705230","706190"," You want that bear case?"
"706390","708610"," I was going to make a video last night, but I forgot it was Super Bowl."
"709010","710030"," I was off and running it."
"710130","712410"," Did anybody on the internet or the news or anything?"
"713650","718130"," But if we get, if you're a bear and you want to get underneath this stuff, to even begin to"
"718130","721730"," start talking about a bear case until that happens, this has been raging. "
"721890","726070"," This has been raging in the background for quite some time."
"726070","732310"," If you're, if you're looking at on a larger timeframe here, if you're looking at, if you're looking"
"732310","734750"," at the bear case, right?"
"735110","737490"," Talking about something that started way back here, right?"
"737870","740310"," We traded above right here the daily."
"740670","743990"," As soon as we started trading above this daily like this, boom, defend it. "
"744210","745130"," Boom, right?"
"745530","746850"," Boom, boom, swoop back down."
"747090","750810"," The key difference here is it didn't get defend or rejected, right?"
"751490","755470"," And you saw in market breath here, we saw in market breath."
"755470","758550"," That price wasn't following breath down. "
"758910","761270"," We saw that again this week, price did not."
"761450","768510"," We didn't see velocity in price on the way down in breath in the market this past week."
"768670","769230"," We didn't see it. "
"769250","770070"," We looked at it on Saturday."
"770510","771810"," Didn't see it again."
"772550","776750"," And you're seeing a successful defense of that daily trigger. "
"777190","782410"," You're also seeing a turning point in weekly and monthly momentum underneath."
"782410","790030"," This starts to begin to look like we're pushing away from monthly triggers, weekly triggers to a"
"790030","793530"," daily trigger to a more less volatile market."
"793810","794530"," Does that go?"
"794610","798230"," I don't know how that plays out on the volatility we have coming this week?"
"798450","798990"," No idea. "
"799550","805830"," But as of right now, what's taken place this morning heading into this morning is a rejection"
"805830","809330"," against the bear thesis."
"810170","812250"," It was bought this morning, right?"
"812630","818550"," Bears wanted to wake up this morning with futures putting it underneath the daily trigger to then"
"818550","820370"," attack the weekly and monthly."
"820510","822770"," And that did not happen this morning at all. "
"823530","826310"," And so we're looking for that as the bell opens, right?"
"826450","830170"," You're saying, hey, cap, wow, how do I get that bearish thesis going?"
"830610","837390"," The truth is you have to get back underneath the hourly, defend the hourly if you're a bear."
"837390","838470"," You see this above there?"
"838710","841590"," It's where the bears come in and they defend it, right?"
"842030","844690"," We're trying to defend it, defend it, defend it."
"844750","846430"," And the bears need to do that again today. "
"846890","849090"," This is not a good look right here."
"849710","851450"," For bears, this is not a good look."
"851630","855350"," You had your chance to come down here and you were told, no, right?"
"855550","860990"," You've got demand down here on the daily and they stepped right in and said, nope, nope, nope,"
"861350","861850"," we're going higher. "
"862350","868170"," And I'll tell you what, when you see stuff like that and you see declining, you see declining"
"868170","869130"," supply, right?"
"869310","870110"," Supply is coming down."
"870230","873250"," This is the best bet that the bears have."
"873630","875250"," It's not a good look. "
"875430","878330"," Overall, not a good look for the bears."
"879050","881210"," They wanted to see follow through in price."
"881670","883430"," They didn't get follow through in price. "
"884270","885910"," They need to see that."
"886230","888830"," Now, we're on the one minute chart right here, right on the open."
"889450","891770"," And we're going to see exactly what happens here. "
"891770","893330"," And you can see the defense immediately."
"893330","898850"," If you watch price here and price go above the one minute here, right?"
"899050","901990"," And in a sustained move and you end up seeing."
"904430","905210"," Hold on. "
"907390","912190"," You end up seeing this one minute come above and you see this red line right here."
"912330","917370"," And we'll change this on the we both chart so that you guys can follow along on both sides."
"917970","923130"," You see this five minute coming underneath and you see price hold, right?"
"923130","928810"," If price can hold right here, you're going to see a rocket ship for spy. "
"929150","931130"," So we're going to let this play out in the opening bell."
"931330","936850"," We're going to see if they can come back down and tag any of these prior lows, tag any of"
"936850","940310"," these prior highs in pre market, close some of these gaps."
"940910","946570"," And if we can get back up here, these bulls are going to take this, take this money line for"
"946570","949130"," a ride this morning, hands down. "
"951830","952350"," Unreal."
"953250","959510"," What I expected was expected futures to be up and then cash market to sell it down."
"960310","965090"," But no way shape or form that I expect to see the bulls out here this morning. "
"965550","966590"," Just smashing it."
"966750","967830"," Futures didn't do it."
"968010","970290"," Cash market did it for four futures. "
"971270","973290"," And you're watching it take place right now."
"974290","976010"," You're watching it take place right now."
"976130","979430"," You're watching the bulls stepping on the daily and saying, nope, we're going higher. "
"980210","981570"," Much stronger, right?"
"981950","985950"," The daily, the daily, the, the daily triggers is, is nothing to be trifled with."
"986130","987530"," Absolutely nothing to be trifled with."
"987790","992230"," If the, if the hourly and the daily and the monthly and the weekly, weekly, we're coming down on"
"992230","995770"," top of price, I would, I would say have a different view on this. "
"996330","1001570"," I'd be like, hell no, bulls are in some deep due to, but this morning, you're seeing, and you saw"
"1001570","1005490"," yesterday, you saw the daily trigger come right up underneath like a shark."
"1005870","1008530"," You see the weekly and the monthly coming right up like a shark."
"1009390","1011390"," You better have some bigger news then. "
"1012130","1015110"," You have to have some bigger news than I think the bear market started."
"1015950","1018330"," I'm a shot call on the top because you know what?"
"1018430","1020550"," I'll tell you what was on YouTube, right?"
"1020670","1024069"," And I looked around YouTube talking about people that have videos that have a hundred thousand"
"1024069","1031510"," views, a hundred million followers, 200,000 followers and non stops in October 12th, non stops in"
"1031510","1032369"," October 12th."
"1032390","1036410"," It's been doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom. "
"1036410","1041170"," The entire rally doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom, doom."
"1041170","1042290"," All over the place."
"1042569","1042930"," Never ending. "
"1043190","1045490"," Just non stop garbage out of their mouths."
"1046430","1046810"," Unreal."
"1048370","1048670"," Non stop. "
"1049150","1049370"," Never ending."
"1049770","1050090"," Non stop."
"1050330","1050750"," Non stop. "
"1051010","1051410"," Non stop."
"1052590","1054150"," Non non non stop."
"1054550","1055050"," Unreal. "
"1055530","1056950"," I can't even imagine."
"1057750","1060270"," I can't even imagine as a trader or an investor."
"1061430","1063350"," Do you get phone calls?"
"1063950","1069830"," Do you get phone calls out there from your broker saying, yeah, sorry, Mr. Jim James, you've been"
"1069830","1071170"," short since 345. "
"1072190","1073710"," We're going to carry that for you."
"1073830","1074910"," Don't worry if we go to 420."
"1075850","1076850"," Don't worry if we go to 460. "
"1077890","1079290"," We'll carry all that short for you."
"1079890","1080230"," Bullshit."
"1080570","1081110"," That's what I say. "
"1081370","1081830"," Bullshit."
"1082790","1083530"," Not happening."
"1084830","1085770"," Not happening. "
"1085770","1088970"," You want to do the bear case or anything like that out there."
"1089110","1090590"," You want to do a bear case out there."
"1091010","1095310"," Don't talk to me unless we break underneath the weekly and the monthly, the daily. "
"1095830","1096150"," Seriously."
"1096890","1097810"," That's where it is."
"1098310","1100940"," You got to get underneath 396, 397. "
"1101570","1102230"," You got to reject."
"1103010","1106710"," You can't even wait there if you get underneath 396 and 397."
"1107970","1109290"," You get underneath there, right?"
"1109770","1112210"," You can't just reject it and hold that hang out there. "
"1113170","1114730"," You got to get underneath it."
"1114730","1118530"," You got to reject it and start heading down in price velocity."
"1118990","1121650"," If you can't do that, I don't want to hear it. "
"1122010","1123110"," And it hasn't happened."
"1123470","1125730"," It hasn't happened since October 12th."
"1126870","1129630"," So you've got literally, we're in what days today?"
"1129890","1131590"," February 13th. "
"1133730","1135010"," February 13th."
"1135450","1141650"," And you've got people nonstop since October 12th saying this is the top."
"1142150","1143630"," This is the top. "
"1143630","1145210"," This is the top."
"1145510","1149550"," When all they had to do, all they have to do to call a top."
"1150690","1151810"," What do they have to do?"
"1153650","1154310"," It's easy. "
"1154930","1156750"," I can tell you it's easy."
"1158090","1159110"," It's so easy."
"1159330","1160330"," It's super easy. "
"1162910","1163850"," Super easy."
"1164610","1164990"," What is it?"
"1165870","1170150"," A successful defense of the hourly."
"1170150","1172130"," A break of the daily. "
"1172530","1173310"," Just the daily."
"1174650","1175770"," I mean, look at it."
"1177110","1177670"," Right?"
"1177830","1178790"," You don't see that here. "
"1179170","1183370"," You see it's slightly here, but you lost price velocity in here, right?"
"1184730","1188190"," The hourly followed you down and we fought against the hourly."
"1189210","1189310"," Right?"
"1189550","1191210"," Here's the daily trigger right here, right?"
"1191770","1192990"," But you lost velocity."
"1193190","1194590"," You've lost velocity of price. "
"1195090","1197190"," We had velocity of price in 2022."
"1199030","1199470"," Right?"
"1199710","1202930"," You're looking for those things in breadth and we're not seeing them."
"1203510","1204790"," So we haven't seen it. "
"1205790","1209490"," So not only do you need to get underneath the daily in the hourly."
"1210030","1211450"," So even if you get down here."
"1213510","1213950"," Right?"
"1214170","1214970"," And you're like, this is the top. "
"1215130","1215710"," This is the top."
"1216290","1218170"," You can't have this happen in like a week."
"1218690","1220110"," This shit has to happen in like three days. "
"1221010","1222090"," You need like blood baths."
"1222770","1223930"," You think that's a blood bath?"
"1224270","1225310"," I can prove that it isn't."
"1225310","1227130"," I can show you blood baths. "
"1227450","1229890"," I can show you what they look like in 2022."
"1230950","1236010"," You would have seen you would have seen price down here in like one day in an overnight."
"1236410","1240170"," A rejection up here in another down move in an overnight. "
"1240910","1246270"," You would have seen another one in three to five days and literally have been down here."
"1246810","1248210"," Or just not seen it."
"1248510","1250890"," Now if we do start seeing it, you can start calling tops. "
"1251730","1252670"," I can show you back in 2022."
"1252670","1253610"," You can see a top."
"1253890","1253930"," Easy. "
"1253930","1255110"," You could see breath."
"1255550","1261450"," You could see velocity on higher time frames rolling off in the background."
"1262150","1263870"," You see this big white box down here. "
"1263970","1265330"," That's not breath rolling off."
"1265670","1266830"," That's breath climbing."
"1267590","1271790"," See that big white box that's breath underneath the market coming after you. "
"1272210","1274550"," Not not you want to see like a crash."
"1275430","1280410"," You need to see this big white box down here having done something like this in previous history,"
"1280410","1282210"," even though price is higher."
"1283750","1284730"," We're not seeing it. "
"1284970","1285970"," I'm not seeing it anywhere."
"1286210","1286730"," I'm seeing it."
"1286990","1287650"," I'm not seeing it. "
"1288010","1292110"," So that's what it looked like all of 2022."
"1294690","1296530"," So unless you have a black swan moment."
"1297490","1299010"," I don't know what to say if you're a bear. "
"1299230","1300370"," You want to start calling stuff."
"1301530","1304570"," You wait to call some shit until you start to see some price."
"1305410","1306450"," Velocity on the downside. "
"1307810","1312090"," You start to see some momentum slowing underneath the surface of the market."
"1312090","1316170"," And why are you even bothering calling it here?"
"1317070","1319210"," Why are you bothering calling a top here?"
"1319470","1326030"," If this is the top, right, then we must be going down to 3,200 minimum, right?"
"1326250","1328570"," You're calling for 30% down, right?"
"1328870","1331530"," At 345, you're calling for 30% down, right?"
"1332150","1334750"," At 375, you're calling for 30% down."
"1335310","1336290"," Now we're at four. "
"1336550","1337310"," Well, we're just at what?"
"1337310","1337910"," 420."
"1338770","1340150"," And now you're calling for it."
"1340170","1341190"," It was 20%. "
"1341190","1343410"," Now it's 30% down to 3rd, 3,200."
"1343790","1345110"," So we're going down there."
"1345230","1346190"," We're going to 2,800. "
"1346750","1350910"," If we're going to 3,200, then that must mean, right?"
"1351250","1352190"," What do you care?"
"1352770","1357570"," What do you care about calling a top like right at this moment?"
"1358170","1362710"," You know, you shouldn't even be caring about where we are in price right now."
"1362750","1363810"," We're going to go down to 2,800."
"1364290","1367710"," You're telling me that you need 1,000 points. "
"1367970","1372130"," I don't know if it's 1,000 points, but some insane number, you need all of it."
"1372550","1378550"," You just need some of the move and you do need to have price velocity in the downward move."
"1379130","1383970"," You need to have price going faster than breadth on the way down to have that happen. "
"1384450","1386910"," So forget about even price at this point percentage."
"1386910","1391050"," I mean, some of the percentages are just getting ridiculous as to what you need."
"1393050","1394630"," You know, it's like 20% from where?"
"1394810","1397490"," You show me the price where it's 20% or 30%. "
"1398170","1399410"," Is it now 40%?"
"1399530","1400490"," Is it now 60%?"
"1400770","1401670"," Is it now 70%?"
"1402310","1403490"," What actually is it?"
"1403770","1404130"," Is the question?"
"1406230","1407130"," So I don't know."
"1407290","1408470"," I don't know what to say to a bear."
"1408690","1409610"," I agree with a bear. "
"1409770","1413930"," If I give you the bear at this point, if the bear is saying, hey, there's a chance of a"
"1413930","1416750"," risk of a crash or the last leg down."
"1416950","1417750"," I'm not against that."
"1417750","1419950"," But puts are cheap for a hedge. "
"1420890","1426210"," There are known places to buy a bottom and then put a hedge on or take profit on the underlying"
"1426210","1428210"," and then put cheap hedges on."
"1428450","1433750"," There's even a place for bulls right now not to buy anything for a contract and wait for"
"1433750","1435550"," confirmation for the next leg hire."
"1437830","1440650"," Most bulls want to buy another bottom down here. "
"1441710","1447310"," So if you're like the collapse bear, then you need to see price velocity on the downside."
"1449070","1455150"," The crazy part about that too is if you were to see this move in one to three days, there"
"1455150","1459570"," would still likely be a rejection check and you could take that move down."
"1459890","1461250"," But we're not seeing it. "
"1461370","1462570"," We're not seeing the price velocity."
"1463190","1464310"," You don't even need to catch this."
"1464950","1467830"," You don't even need to call this as the top. "
"1468770","1475270"," Because when price velocity moves so fast on the downside, you will almost always see one more"
"1475270","1477930"," swing high and then the bloodbath down below."
"1480460","1481520"," You don't need to be the first."
"1481740","1482640"," This is all about money. "
"1483020","1488720"," Not you calling some shit on Twitter or YouTube or making fucking videos to sell the fucking"
"1488720","1489680"," hundred thousand people."
"1491380","1492440"," Since say no."
"1493680","1498440"," I'm doing great at this morning by the way if you're wondering just a quick Monday morning rant. "
"1501340","1505660"," But you got to be looking for last Tuesday."
"1506940","1511460"," So last Tuesday, we got some good velocity of price I think on Wednesday."
"1511800","1514640"," I think it was Wednesday or Tuesday we did. "
"1514780","1519340"," But whatever day it was the first day, the first down day right here where my cursor is right here"
"1519340","1520940"," to my cursor right here."
"1521360","1522940"," We didn't quite get this one."
"1523040","1524440"," No, it's this one right here. "
"1524440","1526120"," So this one right here right."
"1528020","1529040"," That wasn't good."
"1529400","1531500"," You wanted to see like I think this was Tuesday. "
"1532200","1534440"," You want to see like Tuesday down here right."
"1535060","1536960"," And then Wednesday down here right."
"1537180","1539300"," And then like a Thursday into Friday bloodbath. "
"1539760","1540780"," That's what you wanted to see."
"1540900","1541780"," You wanted to see blood."
"1542440","1547180"," You wanted to see blood blood blood bright red blood for like three consecutive days. "
"1547360","1548440"," Maybe one quick breather."
"1548440","1551100"," You lift the bulls head up, let them get one quick breath."
"1551640","1554660"," And then you drown his ass for another day or two or three days right. "
"1554980","1559560"," You want to wake up Monday morning this morning with blood in the streets for bulls."
"1560400","1561840"," And we're still not seeing it."
"1561900","1562940"," You can say whatever you want. "
"1563040","1564840"," You can say they're waiting for CPI."
"1565620","1569180"," You can say they're waiting for I don't know month over month year over year."
"1569800","1570520"," Any of that stuff. "
"1570980","1571980"," And we ain't seen it."
"1573700","1577080"," You can tell me that they're trying to get on high to sort the market."
"1577080","1580680"," You can any kind of nonsense you can take you can do with yourself here. "
"1581040","1582960"," Anything you can do to cope cope."
"1583600","1585920"," But I'll tell you what if you're a bear you got some work to do."
"1586280","1589380"," You got price velocity work that needs to be done on the downside. "
"1589760","1594840"," You got bulls right now control on the market right off the opening bell right here."
"1595600","1596880"," You're if you're a bull."
"1597440","1599880"," Look at this. "
"1601540","1602220"," You're a bull."
"1602420","1603500"," What are you looking for right here?"
"1603620","1604220"," You're looking for."
"1607220","1608040"," This is wild. "
"1608640","1610380"," So if you're a bull, what are you looking for?"
"1610620","1612840"," For a little bit of retest up here."
"1613860","1614920"," And you want to touch and go."
"1615640","1616420"," That's what you want. "
"1617320","1618200"," This is what you want."
"1618300","1618860"," You want to see this."
"1619060","1621180"," You're like I'm a bull cap and I want to get left behind. "
"1622240","1622340"," Right."
"1622760","1624120"," This is where you don't get left behind this purple."
"1624360","1625800"," We have the full purple this morning. "
"1627060","1627140"," Right."
"1627420","1629660"," Fools want to defend right here is what they want to defend."
"1629900","1631880"," If you start to see price get defended right here. "
"1632880","1635260"," Well, we'll start to see us move higher right now."
"1637460","1639240"," You guys want to look at it on another chart."
"1639480","1642180"," You want to look at it on your regular your regular weebo chart. "
"1642480","1643080"," Is that what you want to do?"
"1643780","1645240"," You want to see some squeezing this."
"1645500","1646440"," You want to see some squeeze action."
"1648720","1650020"," You want to see right here. "
"1650140","1650620"," There it is."
"1651980","1652560"," Bring up."
"1654800","1655620"," Tell you what, man. "
"1655780","1659820"," You got you got bears got some stuff to do like bears got to do."
"1660980","1663420"," Bears have to do bears have some work to do."
"1663620","1664840"," This could be a trend day today. "
"1664980","1665700"," Just want to let you know."
"1666180","1668180"," Very possible that we could have a trend day today."
"1668720","1673480"," You know, like we start streaming higher for like a big old pump right here. "
"1673800","1675380"," And then a big old pump right here."
"1675500","1676780"," And then a big old pump right here."
"1677540","1679120"," Easily easily done today. "
"1679640","1681540"," There's your tee enough point right there."
"1682200","1684400"," See that white line crossing above right now."
"1684980","1687860"," Start tagging out all these highs, right?"
"1688400","1689520"," You see it right here. "
"1689580","1690200"," This is the start."
"1690660","1692040"," We aren't trend day."
"1692160","1693340"," This is trend day right here. "
"1693480","1694300"," This is the start."
"1694660","1695940"," What looks like trend day."
"1695980","1701380"," Next target, 409.55. Here's your trend day right there. "
"1702820","1706560"," 409.55. Unreal."
"1712030","1712530"," Here's your trend."
"1712730","1714270"," There's a one minute chart we're on right now. "
"1714350","1715890"," We're trading right off the one minute trigger."
"1719870","1720310"," Unreal."
"1722830","1724030"," So you've been clean out. "
"1724190","1725650"," That seems to have cleaned out."
"1725650","1736260"," The pre-market high is 409.53. So"
"1736260","1740680"," I mean, I don't dislike bears in any way shape or form, but bears got work to do."
"1741000","1746980"," If you're a bear out there and you're looking for the top, there is no reason, no reason to be"
"1746980","1750760"," calling for the top until you see a few things. "
"1750840","1754120"," You want to see price velocity on a rollover."
"1754120","1756880"," When it rolls over, you need velocity and price."
"1757100","1760080"," You need to see like two, three blood days. "
"1761120","1763460"," And you might be like, well, I missed all that money cap."
"1763920","1770660"," The truth is, when we get that price velocity on the downward side, it always comes back up to"
"1770660","1770960"," reject."
"1771400","1772500"," Always, always. "
"1772800","1777320"," You'll have like one huge update, huge squeeze higher."
"1777560","1784200"," We come right back and bears will defend the daily trigger, the weekly, the monthly, anything"
"1784200","1785700"," that's major above."
"1786380","1787220"," They'll defend it. "
"1787340","1790900"," And that's where the real money is for a bear on calling tops."
"1791220","1795740"," Now, we can have a down day or a down week, but in terms of like calling the top of"
"1795740","1798400"," the market, I mean, it's blowing my mind."
"1798860","1799920"," It's blowing my mind. "
"1800980","1803440"," You got to like see some of these videos out there."
"1803520","1804680"," You got to see some of these people on Twitter."
"1804900","1807480"," You got to see some of these articles that you read in the news. "
"1807940","1808100"," CNBC."
"1808940","1809480"," It's unreal."
"1810940","1811760"," Absolutely unreal. "
"1811760","1817500"," So we got a new high in the first test of the one minute right here."
"1818220","1819580"," New high right here."
"1820840","1825040"," We're going to check again and now try to get another new high in the one minute right here and"
"1825040","1829100"," clear out some of these, some of these previous highs, these pivot points. "
"1834460","1836460"," All right, let's see what you guys are saying this morning."
"1836700","1838280"," 230 of you viewing me right now."
"1838340","1839800"," If you haven't been here, you just showed up. "
"1840580","1842480"," I went on a rant."
"1844000","1846780"," It's 946 like a half an hour rant nonstop."
"1850440","1851160"," Good morning. "
"1851340","1851440"," E."
"1851640","1851900"," Good morning."
"1852080","1852300"," Rouge."
"1852440","1855000"," You can more indeed look at Tesla right now as well. "
"1855560","1857960"," I'm going to ask you guys a question inside the stream."
"1858840","1864160"," How about there was some, some, some, some ruffled feathers last night."
"1864320","1866120"," I know out there that some, oh, we got out. "
"1866240","1866720"," There we go."
"1867020","1870080"," We just broke through the pre market."
"1870420","1870540"," High. "
"1871240","1871720"," 409."
"1872340","1872580"," 56."
"1875800","1876280"," Whoo. "
"1877680","1879040"," Next target above."
"1880140","1880660"," 410."
"1880960","1882700"," 56 as long as we can stay. "
"1884260","1885180"," Stay with us."
"1885240","1887820"," So in this last test down here, we just got a new high."
"1888040","1890600"," So we're very bullish right now in the market. "
"1891340","1893740"," We saw Elon Musk hanging out with Rupert Murdoch."
"1895440","1896480"," Last night."
"1897940","1904120"," And of course, you know, Elon says he's famous for hating all of all journalists, right?"
"1904120","1904720"," Doesn't trust. "
"1904980","1906700"," So surely expecting the Bank of England guilt."
"1906700","1907320"," So results."
"1908260","1909000"," Doesn't trust. "
"1910740","1912860"," Reporters doesn't trust mass media."
"1913280","1915400"," And sure enough, who is he hanging out with?"
"1915680","1918580"," One of the, one of the oligarchy."
"1918880","1919180"," Here we go. "
"1919180","1919960"," Now trading 409."
"1920460","1920820"," 69."
"1922180","1924180"," Do, do, do, do, do, do. "
"1925780","1927100"," Unreal for the bulls."
"1927560","1927780"," Okay."
"1927960","1929560"," Let's take a look for Tesla here. "
"1929800","1929880"," Okay."
"1929880","1931640"," Look at Tesla here this morning."
"1933900","1934580"," And Tesla. "
"1935180","1935300"," Yeah."
"1936180","1939200"," The boy, they're trying to keep Tesla down, aren't they, this morning?"
"1939900","1945320"," You've got Tesla trading 191.42. Let's take a look at Tesla this morning."
"1946680","1950080"," And I want to talk to the bull or the bulls at some point here. "
"1950820","1954560"," Let's look at, let's look at Tesla on a different time frame here."
"1955740","1957320"," I'm assuming Tesla here."
"1957820","1961160"," And now tell you what, these bears are not ready. "
"1961160","1961980"," These sellers."
"1962320","1964080"," Well, I'm going to tell you a few things here about Tesla."
"1964600","1966580"," See, we can take a look at Tesla here. "
"1970620","1972820"," So this is probably a buyable dip on Tesla."
"1973080","1977240"," So if you're a Tesla bull and you're in the broadcast right now, go tell your, go tell your Tesla"
"1977240","1978000"," bull friends."
"1978780","1980500"," We're going to talk, Tesla talk right now. "
"1980600","1980760"," Okay."
"1982000","1985480"," Cause Tesla's probably has a buyable dip currently right where we are."
"1986320","1987620"," Oh, let me see a second here. "
"1987820","1988800"," We're going to stuff up here."
"1989200","1995000"," We're going to have another little test of the one minute on, on the spy here."
"1995640","1998120"," We're going to look at a Tesla really quick here. "
"1999360","2001820"," So do you see, I want you to see this right here."
"2002000","2005020"," I want you to watch my cursor down here right where it is right here."
"2005420","2011800"," I want you to see that when you start to see a bottoming effect down here, right?"
"2011960","2014540"," You'll start to see this begin to ramp up actually. "
"2015100","2016100"," Just like this."
"2018160","2020740"," Just like that, like that, like that, right?"
"2020740","2022860"," And you see this one right in here, right?"
"2024060","2029040"," This is telling you that the, that you've got momentum coming up from the bottom of the market"
"2029040","2030100"," right now in Tesla."
"2030720","2033000"," Now, there's a couple of things to think about here. "
"2033180","2035480"," Last, I believe Monday of last week."
"2036440","2037940"," I had worn Tesla bulls."
"2038160","2042840"," I had said, okay, I had said I can guarantee you that as we get close to two, two, two,"
"2043020","2043220"," two. "
"2043240","2044140"," Thank you, England."
"2044380","2047520"," So 650 million pounds of bonds in the auction receiving 800."
"2047520","2049980"," I'm going to mute that right now. "
"2050360","2054760"," As we come in close to two, 16 to 20, you're going to see two things happen."
"2054940","2056780"," You're going to see bull or bears."
"2056780","2058520"," No, this is a natural cell point. "
"2058520","2060900"," So they'll step in with shorts, right?"
"2061020","2063000"," You'll see some hedge funds step in with short."
"2063300","2067159"," You'll see bulls start to take profit off the table."
"2067219","2072239"," They'll start selling calls above while they tell you to buy calls on fin to it, right?"
"2072239","2078500"," Because they just keep continuing to want you to keep, to keep buying even if they've got way down"
"2078500","2078980"," here, right?"
"2079699","2083540"," All kinds of different mischievous shit goes on up in here. "
"2083840","2085280"," Yeah, I sold at two, 14."
"2085620","2088679"," The second test up here, the first test, second test."
"2088880","2089679"," I took money up table. "
"2090120","2091900"," I don't want to buy in a Tesla unless we're above here."
"2091920","2092520"," Believe it or not."
"2092880","2095920"," Before we go back down and retest 95 or even go to 65 bucks. "
"2096620","2097420"," I don't want to buy Tesla here."
"2097840","2098600"," I'm not a buyer here."
"2099200","2105300"," People do different things to manage buying the market, right?"
"2106100","2116160"," Now, with all that said here, all of that said here, you've got all these shorts going, no,"
"2116340","2116600"," no, no. "
"2116760","2119340"," You're not squeezing up here now, right?"
"2119460","2120800"," You're not going to squeeze this here now."
"2121140","2122080"," I just got short."
"2122780","2124140"," I'm just starting to sell Tesla. "
"2124500","2126560"," I want to get underneath this daily on Tesla, right?"
"2126560","2129720"," I don't want to give up this orange line right here, right?"
"2130160","2130920"," Don't, not at all."
"2131040","2134260"," This is the weekly, by the way, on Tesla."
"2134620","2138220"," And this is the monthly downward momentum. "
"2138580","2146440"," The moment that this is that we win to 20 as a bull and you start to move higher, that"
"2146440","2148200"," means correction over on Tesla."
"2148760","2154740"," So this is going to be a lot of work for bulls in here, a lot of volatility in here."
"2154740","2159700"," And what you're going to see is this daily moving up in the background. "
"2160340","2162240"," And this is the key for bulls."
"2162680","2168500"," This is the only thing bulls have going for them right now that they have not had in some time."
"2169160","2174120"," And oftentimes, when daily velocity comes up here, rolls over. "
"2174860","2177900"," You'll see the hourly, the green roll over underneath it."
"2179160","2180960"," Or bulls do not want to see that, okay?"
"2180960","2189900"," Boles want to see price and the hourly stay above the daily right here and defend it and move"
"2189900","2190200"," higher."
"2190640","2192420"," So what does that mean for you?"
"2193080","2199780"," It means for you, you're going to expect volatility and you're going to expect a date with destiny"
"2199780","2201780"," at some point with the daily trigger. "
"2202340","2204720"," Now, that could mean that the daily trigger comes up here."
"2205260","2206880"," We lose price at some point."
"2207820","2210080"," Keeps coming back down and you're going to have a date. "
"2210260","2217720"," You're going to find out at some point here if price and if the correction is over."
"2218060","2220560"," We'll monitor this over the next week or two."
"2221460","2227580"," And especially in the end of February to see if the bulls can hold on because I do want to"
"2227580","2231800"," reenter Tesla long here if they can defend. "
"2231800","2238340"," If Tesla in big tech can defend and not begin the start of a new leg lower."
"2239640","2243200"," I want to get, I want to get on that trade with 100%."
"2243200","2248120"," And on Saturday, I went over with you big tech and how they could roll over and start a second"
"2248120","2252260"," leg down in the market for 2023. "
"2253060","2258500"," So expect volatility here as this begins to play out."
"2258500","2263340"," I do want you to see this, this, this, this hourly velocity is slowing down in here."
"2263760","2268380"," I'm going to give you some price targets down below if you're a Tesla bull. "
"2268980","2270220"," And you're like, Oh, I don't know cap."
"2270560","2273340"," Super scary here, cap right in here."
"2273600","2277400"," 169 80 173 13. "
"2277580","2282580"," We can bring this up to 175 as a nice natural place to buy a dip."
"2283140","2286320"," And then we want to check out some other levels in here."
"2286320","2290700"," We're going to have another one right here at 195 12. "
"2291180","2293940"," This is what you want to be holding 195 12."
"2294320","2296960"," You want to spend some time in here if you're a bull."
"2297520","2298660"," I want you to see this. "
"2298980","2302000"," You don't want to lose the one minute and the five minute."
"2302440","2304400"," And then you're going to give you a couple more here."
"2304540","2305500"," You want to win this. "
"2306120","2308140"," You will start to squeeze above."
"2312760","2313800"," 199 41."
"2314300","2315540"," You should begin to squeeze. "
"2316300","2318780"," And you saw that squeeze right back here in time."
"2319000","2319820"," I'm just going to bring this over."
"2320380","2321680"," You saw that squeeze right here. "
"2321980","2323480"," You saw more squeezing above."
"2324340","2325540"," And you will see that again."
"2325540","2326560"," If you're able to regain. "
"2329790","2330810"," Right here."
"2332070","2333850"," Make that green right there."
"2334130","2335390"," Let me just green right here. "
"2336230","2338010"," That's like action stuff down here."
"2338010","2339690"," Action Jackson down in here."
"2340490","2342570"," And you want to be taking profit above. "
"2343910","2349450"," Again at 220 51 and let the algorithms and the hedge funds."
"2350370","2351970"," Do the work for you, right?"
"2352150","2354070"," This is kind of where you pick up."
"2354810","2356730"," It's kind of where you pick up that trade. "
"2357870","2358610"," As a."
"2359870","2360670"," Hold on here."
"2361510","2362490"," I'm doing here."
"2363790","2365510"," It's kind of where you pick up that. "
"2365670","2368590"," Not that trade, but that investment pure testable."
"2369250","2373250"," This is where you you rebuy the underlying above here."
"2373350","2375490"," You reenter that trade once again. "
"2375790","2382350"," If you bought 100 135 120 any of that stuff, your next buying opportunity is a successful defense"
"2382350","2384230"," of 220 and change."
"2384610","2388310"," And the crazy part is this number actually comes down over time."
"2389150","2389210"," Right. "
"2389210","2395450"," So that that buy number could come from 220 all the way down to 189 180 somewhere in there, which"
"2395450","2396470"," would be a juicy buy."
"2396890","2403910"," Imagine being able to buy Tesla at 130 bucks, 100 bucks, and then not even by 220 just sell to"
"2403910","2404410"," 14."
"2404850","2406530"," Come right back in and buy to 180. "
"2406990","2409150"," You'll be you'll be beaten most of the market."
"2409150","2414990"," You'll be beaten most of Wall Street in timing of buying the underlying buying dips."
"2415510","2416750"," All that kind of stuff. "
"2418670","2420550"," I'm going to go back to the spy real quick."
"2423410","2425330"," Let me know in the chat what you think about."
"2426190","2427910"," My boy Rupert Murdoch. "
"2428330","2429330"," My boy Elon Musk."
"2429830","2430570"," Look at that."
"2430750","2431310"," Oh, yeah. "
"2431630","2432530"," Look at that, baby."
"2433070","2433770"," Look at that."
"2434570","2437370"," Look at that beast mode on the spy. "
"2437770","2438830"," Just teeing off."
"2439470","2440630"," Look at that teeing off."
"2440810","2441630"," Here's one, right?"
"2442430","2443370"," One beautiful touch. "
"2444550","2445630"," Slam higher, right?"
"2445630","2445710"," Right."
"2446390","2447590"," Come up here."
"2447870","2448970"," Retest the one minute. "
"2449110","2450610"," Slam higher, right?"
"2451210","2451950"," One minute."
"2452190","2452530"," One minute."
"2452750","2456750"," Velocity cranking through the roof for spy right now. "
"2457230","2460010"," Just just moving right along on spy."
"2460590","2461850"," Look at that beast mode."
"2462550","2463930"," Look at that touchdown below. "
"2464230","2464630"," Retest."
"2465110","2472670"," New high already 409 79 looking for 410 56 on the next high for the spy."
"2473410","2473810"," Whoo. "
"2474910","2480830"," And I had, you know, it's funny too, as I had a, um, I had a, uh, trend day in"
"2480830","2481710"," the way up today."
"2482170","2488410"," I had something for the bears today, but I realized this morning that they sent me the wrong thing."
"2488430","2490210"," So I'm going to keep it and roll it out for the bears. "
"2490230","2492990"," But you know, I could probably not going to see it for a couple days."
"2493810","2495230"," Now trading 409 85."
"2497290","2498090"," Oh, man. "
"2500630","2501430"," Oh, man."
"2505070","2506210"," Oh, man."
"2508170","2510690"," Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. "
"2511250","2514070"," Yeah, he said, he had said Dogecoin yesterday, right?"
"2514730","2517570"," It meant now trading 410 09 on the spy."
"2519110","2520150"," Oh, baby."
"2528710","2530930"," Please like and subscribe these videos. "
"2531130","2533070"," Give me a song like these videos if you can."
"2533070","2534630"," Play your friends tune in every day."
"2535170","2538170"," I've had a rough time trying to get on live stream recently. "
"2538510","2540650"," We're working on something for you guys in the background."
"2540770","2542390"," If you're just joining us since last week."
"2543230","2550390"," We've had some, we've had some, some, some, um, some website stuff that couldn't wait. "
"2550870","2556210"," Had to, had to happen between Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"2558290","2566750"," And one of the things I can't announce specifically at this point, but the team is, the team is"
"2566750","2569870"," solidified at this point."
"2570770","2572230"," You got, we've got a guy. "
"2572490","2575330"," I'm not going to say who he is unless he wants to say who he is."
"2576110","2581230"," We've got an artificial intelligence developer from a major tech company."
"2583930","2585210"," Unreal guy. "
"2585510","2590790"," We've got a, we've got a visionary that's helping us out or as a, or a partnership in the"
"2590790","2591250"," background."
"2592110","2600170"," Keep us, keep integrity, keep, keep, keep focused on how we started this, this project years ago."
"2600950","2603130"," And now trading 410 33. "
"2604550","2607530"," Looking for at least the old man."
"2607990","2609170"," Look at that, baby."
"2610230","2611330"," Look at that. "
"2612490","2615570"," Oh, man, burr, baby, burr."
"2616930","2618510"," Give me a burr."
"2618930","2621610"," Turn off that, that news block this morning. "
"2621770","2623070"," We don't need to know about the news."
"2623830","2624830"," We didn't know where we're going."
"2624830","2626990"," We're really expecting comments from ECBs not here. "
"2627130","2630970"," Also just noting some market movements here as we are seeing some upside movement in the S&P 500."
"2631330","2632170"," Thank you."
"2640250","2642030"," I'll give you a headline catalyst. "
"2649950","2655030"," Now trading 410 35 on the spy trying to attack 410 56."
"2658100","2660860"," So you've got the first pump right here this morning, right?"
"2661000","2663000"," We have the defense of the one minute."
"2663700","2664000"," Right?"
"2664740","2671880"," We got the new highs came back down, tested again, trying to break through, not break through, but"
"2671880","2672240"," tag. "
"2672880","2676940"," Oh, yeah, baby, 410 56, baby."
"2677820","2681940"," And now you're going to be waiting for the one minute down below here, right?"
"2682220","2684940"," You guys are all getting back into the swing of trade with Cappy."
"2684940","2687500"," Aren't you have the one minute coming up here?"
"2687900","2691420"," And you want to see, or bulls are like, can I jump on that train, please?"
"2691720","2692600"," I missed the train. "
"2693620","2700600"," You want to see a defense once again of the one minute to jump on that train."
"2700600","2702580"," Now trading 1410 53."
"2703300","2703940"," Whoo. "
"2705880","2709560"," Oh, man, death and destruction of the stock market this morning."
"2710260","2711640"," What's going on?"
"2716010","2717290"," 410 53."
"2730430","2733150"," On real, 410 53. "
"2737940","2740900"," You will normally notice some, hold on a second here."
"2743200","2746800"," Let me come on over here and do this for you here."
"2746800","2751820"," So it's the next one here index rising 1% to session highs here. "
"2753540","2754440"," Oh, yeah."
"2755840","2756540"," Oh, yeah."
"2756740","2757760"," What are you looking for here?"
"2758640","2763560"," You're looking to take some money off the table, even if we put, even if we stick above here,"
"2764200","2767560"," you'll be looking to take some money off the table and you're going to want to see this one minute"
"2767560","2768800"," catch back up. "
"2769580","2775140"," Retest this and at least retest the high or it can have some continuation higher here."
"2778290","2781270"," Look at that move on the S&P 500 baby."
"2781810","2782450"," Good morning. "
"2782910","2783510"," United States."

"2789050","2789810"," I didn't even know."
"2790070","2792270"," I didn't even know last night that there was a."
"2792830","2795670"," I didn't know that there was contention over the Super Bowl. "
"2795950","2799290"," I didn't notice someone commented in one of my posts yesterday."
"2799730","2801430"," And I was like, what are they talking about?"
"2801670","2803870"," And then I realized, of course, they watched the Super Bowl."
"2804570","2807430"," And I realized that there was points of contention politically. "
"2807810","2809010"," We're not going to discuss that here."
"2809630","2811610"," This morning, but I get it now."
"2811750","2812610"," I wasn't paying attention. "
"2812650","2813570"," So I didn't know."
"2814270","2815370"," There was that contention."
"2817850","2820010"," In the in the Super Bowl. "
"2820210","2822050"," The only thing the only comment I would say about it was."
"2825090","2826010"," It's it's."
"2826670","2828370"," I like it's, I don't know. "
"2828530","2829730"," You know what it's like?"
"2829850","2830750"," It's like bad writers."
"2831490","2832410"," Reminds me of the movie."
"2832630","2833430"," Our alien. "
"2834050","2835190"," There's bad writers."
"2836570","2837810"," Bad writers suck."
"2838770","2840150"," It's always bad writers. "
"2844220","2845120"," Good morning, Brad."
"2845320","2845660"," How are you?"
"2846720","2847640"," What do we got here?"
"2849220","2849740"," Yeah."
"2851560","2852840"," What's the other thing I noticed?"
"2852840","2855460"," So we just said NFL has been the WWE for decades. "
"2856080","2859160"," So I'm a Patriots fan, right?"
"2859500","2861760"," So I'm going to like Tom Brady fan."
"2862340","2865160"," So I just told you what to expect up here, right?"
"2865780","2867120"," We tagged our one above."
"2867280","2870500"," We're looking for a test of the one minute as it comes up. "
"2871100","2874380"," You know what's interesting for me is I used to watch Patriots."
"2874560","2875660"," Then I watched Tom Brady."
"2876660","2878980"," I'm originally from Boston. "
"2879620","2883260"," And of course we had a great couple decades."
"2884280","2885160"," There for the Patriots."
"2885660","2888540"," There's a gift being a Boston fan, right?"
"2888960","2894600"," But then I've been watching so much more college football and. "
"2895340","2903640"," International football and US soccer Detroit has a huge local soccer team."
"2903640","2905660"," That the local fans love."
"2905960","2908300"," And so I've been all so wrapped up in that. "
"2908500","2911280"," What Winky just said, I thought about that last night."
"2911800","2913180"," I watched that Super Bowl last night."
"2913260","2919740"," And I was like, I was like, man, I was like, I was like, there's so much production in the"
"2919740","2920560"," NFL today. "
"2921060","2922600"," And college football's got some of it too."
"2923460","2924440"," College football has some of that."
"2925000","2928060"," But you don't see that as much of it in in soccer. "
"2928300","2929440"," You just don't see that much."
"2931420","2932840"," Comp and circumstance."
"2933260","2935180"," It looked like WWE to me. "
"2935380","2937420"," I said that to myself last night."
"2937780","2939540"," It was when they were bringing out the teams."
"2940020","2944820"," And they had the they were they were like walking on the dance floor or whatever like the catwalk. "
"2945100","2946600"," That was some weird stuff for me."
"2946700","2949480"," I was like, I was like, what is I was like, are we playing sports here?"
"2950380","2951100"," Or are we?"
"2951880","2952820"," Is this a show?"
"2953280","2954140"," I was like, this is a show."
"2955260","2957200"," I did notice that last night. "
"2957200","2958700"," I was like, man, I was like."
"2959860","2962500"," And then, of course, the game has changed so much."
"2963360","2967400"," Rightfully, so they don't want to get everybody to hurt, even those tons of damage. "
"2967940","2970600"," They don't want to see that much damage right their bodies."
"2971180","2973920"," But it's it was bizarre to see that last night."
"2974020","2977120"," I was like, man, you don't see that as much. "
"2978380","2984160"," And you I mean, there's still some of the creeping into college sports, but not not football, not"
"2984160","2984460"," soccer."
"2985400","2986880"," My friend was on a hike yesterday."
"2987020","2989380"," I was talking to a to a guy about soccer and. "
"2990860","2992480"," I'll be how large it's become."
"2995140","2997620"," How much more time is spent in the actual sport?"
"2998400","3001800"," See, like you spend more time watching the game right now."
"3004190","3007710"," So if we do get this roll over down to the one minute, we do test this one minute. "
"3008090","3010350"," We come back down here and test this one minute."
"3010810","3012790"," You're going to expect a new high."
"3012790","3015070"," We had four 10 55 up here. "
"3016150","3016930"," We had that."
"3017050","3020550"," We had the tag of the of the of our one above."
"3021030","3026030"," You're going to want to see a new high if we interact with this one minute. "
"3026690","3028910"," And that would be above one four 10 55."
"3029110","3030370"," So there could be a good run above."
"3031010","3038110"," We'll do is get rid of some of this where we might not even come test it. "
"3038170","3039230"," Believe it or not."
"3040430","3041930"," Put this right down in here."
"3043930","3044910"," Just like that. "
"3045350","3048450"," Make a nice little line right there."
"3048970","3052230"," If you're trying to get in on a trade, you know where your place is."
"3052390","3052910"," The end of the trade. "
"3053710","3056550"," You know it's you always like to trade this one minute."
"3056830","3059450"," You see some velocity slide not fair."
"3059510","3062670"," A little bit of velocity kicking off of the market right now. "
"3062710","3064330"," Just just be patient here."
"3065230","3067050"," We'll see if we can get some velocity."
"3067050","3071930"," A nice little test of this one minute down below and see if we can go higher from here. "
"3076790","3077270"," Oh yeah."
"3077950","3078310"," Let's see."
"3078370","3078970"," Hold on a second here. "
"3082010","3084930"," I've got a I've got a guy in the background."
"3085770","3087490"," Very smart man back there."
"3087650","3088470"," Tweet me something. "
"3088670","3093050"," I have to probably take a break at some point and check in with him."
"3094190","3095790"," Now trading for 10 14."
"3096630","3098550"," I might not even get down here and retest. "
"3099150","3105070"," You could also get a retest of the high here and then roll back down to the one minute here"
"3105070","3107050"," so you could also take that trade right there."
"3113470","3114930"," Let's see what you guys are saying down here."
"3120340","3121440"," Let's see here. "
"3123560","3124660"," You're watching CVS."
"3125560","3127780"," A nice little squeeze to retest the high in the background."
"3129220","3130240"," Just a second here. "
"3130300","3130920"," I've got to get over here."
"3161230","3164830"," You know some extent right now to some extent right now."
"3166770","3168570"," To some extent right now. "
"3171410","3172510"," To some extent right now."
"3172510","3173830"," I'll tell you what this is."
"3175470","3176390"," I'm not good. "
"3176570","3181730"," I don't think for a minute that this is the stock market bottom in any way shape before a sustained"
"3181730","3182710"," bull run."
"3185110","3187670"," But I'll tell you what man like."
"3189650","3194150"," Until they until they announce that I think I still agree with the. "
"3194950","3198510"," I think that Jerome knew for sure by saying."
"3200410","3203930"," I posted this on Twitter a week or two ago two weeks ago."
"3204090","3205310"," Maybe a week or two ago. "
"3205790","3206370"," About."
"3208350","3212490"," At the or at the rate to sit last rate decision meeting."
"3214390","3215850"," Him not saying. "
"3216890","3218870"," Him not sticking with."
"3219530","3223270"," We've only got this rate and the next increase and we're done."
"3223930","3225190"," I think that would have triggered. "
"3226370","3229150"," The rollover in the market that the bears are looking for."
"3231590","3233110"," The moment that he said."
"3234170","3236530"," The moment that he was like well we may need to add some more rates. "
"3238090","3240350"," This next rate increases the last one."
"3241750","3244930"," That was a signal that we work on a solid market right now."
"3245930","3249170"," And then I think he was I think he was pressed in the background before. "
"3249950","3255530"," The economic luncheon that he did to repeat that statement multiple times."
"3255830","3257270"," He just kept he just kept."
"3258350","3259230"," Regurgitating it. "
"3259330","3260990"," It's like the thinking about thinking about shit."
"3261710","3266130"," And when he was regurgitating the we're probably not done with rates increases."
"3266730","3269410"," Even though we've done that we have what we have one more left after this one. "
"3269470","3271270"," We just did probably have a couple more."
"3271630","3272530"," A few more."
"3273230","3276550"," I think there's are definitely looking for that moment where. "
"3277510","3278350"," Jerome says."
"3280090","3281170"," Where Jerome says."
"3281610","3283250"," And you guys want some higher targets. "
"3283290","3284430"," We'll give them to you if you want them."
"3285210","3288190"," You guys want some you guys ready for it."
"3288510","3290470"," You want to return to the scene of the crime. "
"3291310","3293230"," You guys want to see the return to the scene of the crime."
"3293310","3294250"," There it is right there."
"3295190","3297210"," You see where that break is right there. "
"3297270","3298070"," We've got another one."
"3298490","3300250"," We'll give you another pinpoint up high."
"3302190","3304390"," There's the other keen off point right there. "
"3307190","3308770"," You guys want some price targets above."
"3309030","3309830"," There's one right there."
"3311290","3312930"," You guys want to see another one up here. "
"3313010","3314810"," This is right where they crossed right here."
"3317520","3320220"," That's where they sold it right there is another target above."
"3321940","3323060"," But I'll tell you what man. "
"3323240","3325580"," Seeing that from Jerome Powell."
"3326260","3330120"," Even if we go down for like traditionally February is a week month."
"3331180","3332080"," We have that moment. "
"3332460","3334180"," I'm open to that."
"3335440","3342860"," I'm open with a March or April low for a summer run."
"3343380","3345240"," That doesn't mean we don't roll over at any point. "
"3346080","3347180"," But I'll tell you what man."
"3347720","3351660"," When you saw that the other day when you saw the or the past couple days."
"3352480","3353700"," When you saw that. "
"3355580","3360260"," It didn't load well for last leg down."
"3360500","3361400"," You really want to see."
"3362100","3365080"," You want to kind of knock everything out at the same time, right?"
"3365500","3366660"," You want high unemployment. "
"3367300","3368360"," You want the yield curve."
"3368600","3368860"," You want."
"3369680","3370560"," Rate cuts. "
"3371200","3372920"," You like all the magic words for a bear."
"3373020","3373720"," I know there's bulls out."
"3373820","3375720"," There's crazy bulls out there that think rate cuts. "
"3376800","3377020"," Signal."
"3377520","3378580"," Well, that crazy bulls."
"3378740","3381060"," I'm assuming these are bulls from the COVID crash. "
"3382040","3384200"," That equates rate cuts with."
"3384660","3387500"," We're going to the moon because we didn't COVID."
"3387500","3391660"," But that was a completely completely different circumstance. "
"3391960","3393120"," We just started pouring money."
"3393400","3394980"," Free check for you."
"3395200","3395980"," Free check for you. "
"3396580","3397560"," Free check for you."
"3398060","3399020"," We're not doing that again."
"3399260","3400220"," None of that's happening. "
"3402650","3404710"," You know, like scrub out of your brain."
"3405230","3406410"," 2020 COVID crash."
"3407230","3410210"," With the normal stock market when rates are cut. "
"3411550","3413290"," That means they're going to front run."
"3413990","3417030"," If there's an end to rate increases, they're going to front run it."
"3417970","3420430"," They'll price that shit out 12 to 18 months. "
"3421170","3423650"," So you'll you guys understand that all that, right?"
"3424410","3424970"," They will price."
"3424990","3426630"," They will price in those rate cuts."
"3427610","3429310"," 12 to 18 months out, right?"
"3429530","3432050"," You will see the market roll over at that point. "
"3432710","3433670"," Highly likely."
"3434930","3436830"," Still a nice fat gap down below closed."
"3436830","3438210"," I haven't closed yet for a Monday. "
"3438710","3441530"," Come back in there interact with the one minute right now."
"3442230","3444570"," This would be a time for bulls to look for."
"3444570","3447110"," So we did retest the high here. "
"3447210","3447670"," You can see it."
"3448390","3449410"," Came back down, right?"
"3449650","3451310"," Here's the retest came back down."
"3451430","3452850"," We're going to be looking at that one minute chart. "
"3453310","3457350"," If the one minute can hold right here and start to build and hold the one minute, we're going to"
"3457350","3459910"," try to take another stab at least one more."
"3460790","3463550"," Target above is four 12 12."
"3466720","3470900"," So if you don't know what I'm talking about here, there has to be some changes to this program. "
"3470900","3472380"," Talk to you guys about something here."
"3474080","3476880"," We discussed something in this in this program."
"3478420","3481160"," I have to be more careful at this point. "
"3482140","3485060"," About what I'm doing and what you're doing."
"3485640","3491220"," So I have to stop telling you guys anything other than what I'm I have to be like, hey, I'm"
"3491220","3491740"," doing this."
"3492240","3496500"," You guys can't ever be like you guys have to ask me. "
"3497160","3500040"," What to do ever anymore."
"3500880","3503780"," I tell you guys that's like, this is a video game."
"3504020","3506920"," This is entertainment education purposes only. "
"3508700","3512630"," But I can't educate you guys."
"3512790","3513110"," That's legal."
"3513410","3513810"," That's fine. "
"3514670","3517170"," But the you got buys here."
"3517790","3522030"," If I was going to buy here, I'd be buying right here."
"3523830","3526470"," Some people like to have their stops up here. "
"3526490","3528630"," Some people like to have their stops down here."
"3529270","3532150"," They'll like to do an addition here, right?"
"3532410","3538860"," Maybe add right here to your thesis until it's until it's confirmed that bad."
"3539680","3539940"," Right?"
"3540220","3541120"," So you have an ad right here. "
"3542280","3543400"," Stop right here."
"3545200","3548040"," And you're looking for your next target above, right?"
"3548560","3549560"," And where is that?"
"3549800","3555540"," You know that you've got your first PT is 41056 or my first PT is 41056."
"3555540","3568880"," Next price target for me above is 41212 right"
"3568880","3569500"," up in there. "
"3570840","3575940"," There is some some velocity is starting to slow a little bit here."
"3577640","3578200"," Right?"
"3578560","3580900"," So some velocity is slowing right here."
"3581040","3584560"," So my confidence in this trade doing higher. "
"3585260","3588860"," I am because we've only we've only done this, right?"
"3589520","3592180"," We've only done this once, twice."
"3592640","3594400"," And usually the third one is the big boy."
"3597080","3600520"," But I know how to put risk on and I know how to manage my risk. "
"3600560","3601620"," I don't stay in the trade."
"3602080","3603280"," Some people won't do an ad."
"3603500","3604700"," They'll just do a stop here. "
"3605540","3605580"," Right?"
"3605680","3607900"," They'll just stop straight down below if there's liquidity break."
"3609300","3611160"," You might get a liquidity break here, right?"
"3611640","3613420"," Comes back up and holds and then goes higher."
"3614260","3616540"," So you kind of diamond-handing with your finger on the sell button. "
"3617440","3621140"," If you if you if you don't like your losses and you're like, hey, you know what?"
"3621820","3625500"," I'm going to take that trade down here and look for the next leg higher."
"3625840","3626820"," That makes sense too."
"3626900","3631720"," If you're like trying to be conservative in your approach to how you're taking your longs, they get"
"3631720","3632040"," all that. "
"3632780","3637840"," If you already made all your money down here, you know, I am who my captain captain paper hands,"
"3637840","3638180"," right?"
"3638660","3639820"," I take a trade right here."
"3640020","3641380"," I take the next trade right here."
"3641660","3642780"," And then I go, that's it. "
"3642900","3643480"," I'm done for the day."
"3643580","3645440"," I've taken all my money and I'm running them out of here."
"3645440","3645760"," I'm done. "
"3646060","3647020"," Got my money for the day."
"3647700","3649140"," And so I'm done for the day."
"3650820","3652440"," So you guys know how to trade this. "
"3652440","3656340"," You guys know how I trade here in the show and you know what it is above."

"3669900","3671020"," It's one minute right now."
"3671080","3672140"," Tesla's building a base. "
"3672660","3682520"," If Tesla can hold above 189.91. 189.91. Right now, Tesla"
"3682520","3688280"," can trade to 192.52 if they can win it to one minute."
"3689420","3693480"," So we'll keep an eye on Tesla right here and see if they can provide the legs that are needed"
"3693480","3695040"," for the next leg higher on the spy."
"3696880","3700180"," Tesla now, sweet, or just starting to win it's trade right here. "
"3700560","3714800"," That 189.98 is going to price target above of 192.49. Another price target above of 195.22. All"

"3763560","3767400"," While the crypto fair and greed index is 48 out of 100, which indicates neutral."
"3768620","3769340"," There we go."

"4422420","4423180"," Yeah, I wasn't."
"4423480","4424600"," I had to take a quick break."
"4425620","4427600"," I have to take the touch. "
"4428280","4432760"," I'm trying to tell my, just so you guys know I got to make some changes here."
"4435420","4438000"," I spend a lot of, I do a lot of streaming."
"4438600","4439140"," So I do this. "
"4439380","4440040"," Oh, yeah."
"4440620","4442980"," A little bit of resistance coming a little bit of resistance here."
"4444620","4445640"," Coming into a checkpoint. "
"4446860","4447260"," Okay."
"4447440","4450380"," So all we need here, all we need right now, right?"
"4450580","4452060"," So you could take some money off right here."
"4452220","4452420"," Okay. "
"4453160","4454040"," Just heads up here."
"4454100","4456480"," You could take a little bit of a, a little bit of a checkpoint here."
"4458280","4460020"," Come into a little bit of a checkpoint. "
"4460480","4461580"," So you can always take some money here."
"4461580","4463780"," We only need the new high, right?"
"4463980","4464740"," Remember what I said to you earlier?"
"4465260","4466280"," We get the new high."
"4466900","4469100"," We can always come back down here. "
"4470360","4472840"," And then you get the next leg higher right here, right?"
"4474200","4475760"," Yeah, I was going to say what I was saying here."
"4476860","4480000"," So you just need to get that interaction with that one minute again."
"4481500","4483340"," So you can see us tagging it right now. "
"4484200","4487220"," You're going to be looking for your next buy above here."
"4488860","4489300"," Right?"
"4489520","4490260"," You're going to see this."
"4490260","4493400"," You want, you want old Captain Jim's going to snap another line here. "
"4497930","4500210"," So we're going to snap a quick little line right here."
"4509740","4511360"," So we're going to do white right there."
"4511580","4515260"," We're going to do, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"4515320","4515960"," That yellow."
"4518180","4520620"," We're going to make that a little white line right there."
"4521080","4521120"," Right?"
"4521280","4522960"," We're going to do that one a little bit like that right there. "
"4524460","4526160"," We're going to look for your next one right here."
"4526340","4527140"," Price target hit."
"4527360","4528240"," We're going to get rid of that one. "
"4529780","4531260"," You can see that on book map."
"4531260","4534500"," And we're going to be looking for our PT one above."
"4536700","4539160"," We're going to raise our ads up, right?"
"4539460","4540660"," Our stops up, right?"
"4541040","4543620"," Maybe you maybe you want to raise your stops up right here. "
"4544320","4547640"," If that's what you want to do, you put the stops there so you don't lose any money."
"4549820","4550120"," Right?"
"4557380","4559540"," You had another buy line down here, maybe."
"4564150","4565530"," Change that out a little bit. "
"4567750","4569290"," Now tag four, eleven, oh two."
"4570930","4573850"," A little bit of a parking job going on there."
"4573850","4575550"," You can kind of see a little wave of sellers. "
"4575930","4577330"," You want to see some consolidation?"
"4577870","4579510"," We'll say it one more time for you this morning."
"4580210","4580450"," Right?"
"4580970","4582070"," Come down here, consolidate."
"4582490","4585810"," You want to hold the one minute and you need to get a new high. "
"4586050","4589730"," So so far we have not failed, not failed to get a new high."
"4590170","4591850"," We have not failed to get a new high."
"4592870","4598190"," If we do see a failure of a new high off the one minute, we're going to then take some"
"4598190","4603660"," money off the table because we know we're losing some velocity. "
"4609120","4609720"," All right."
"4609900","4614940"," We're going to move this over here or something the other way."
"4617100","4619580"," Put that over there for you so you can see the PT above. "
"4622640","4623800"," Trend day, baby."
"4627060","4627760"," Trend day."
"4628180","4632060"," And this is PT one, not two, so we'll write one so you can see it. "
"4640730","4641870"," Right there for you."
"4651900","4653820"," You guys like the blue green?"
"4657190","4658590"," You guys all happy out there?"
"4660610","4661290"," What's the call?"
"4661290","4665210"," You got to make those EMAs back to blue for 10 big OI watching for retrace first."
"4665610","4667510"," Kind of make sure you're treating it through water, water, water. "
"4667750","4670730"," Yeah, I got to do I got to do a couple of things."
"4671030","4675290"," My throat gets all jacked up and then I'm streaming for like seven, eight hours."
"4676310","4680130"," I'm not taking like a 15 minute break and a half an hour break for lunch. "
"4680130","4684170"," And then I need to do more self care in the background."
"4685010","4686930"," That sounds unmanly and stuff, but."
"4689330","4694670"," The work after do in the background that you guys don't see and then the production work after do. "
"4695410","4698430"," There's another like two, three hours on top of all that."
"4698550","4699490"," So it's like a 10 hour day."
"4700470","4704010"," And then the other stuff that we're doing in the background is another two or three hours. "
"4704370","4709510"," And then some of you guys out there, I spent time with you on the phone when I can."
"4710530","4714270"," I get phone calls DMS. I got a check and emails. "
"4714270","4717430"," I got a check and development stuff."
"4717590","4718410"," I got a check in the background."
"4718410","4719370"," They're going to wife and daughters. "
"4720750","4723010"," So it just gets really, really hectic."
"4723290","4725050"," And then, of course, I had a crash at some point."
"4728950","4731750"," I'm trying to get a lot of stuff done, but it really did feel. "
"4732830","4738170"," It really did feel good this past week to see that the stuff you guys have got coming your way."
"4738350","4739110"," I saw some stuff."
"4739990","4745670"," I saw some tools this past week on Thursday, Friday. "
"4747110","4748430"," They're going to blow your face off."
"4748950","4750190"," They're going to blow your face off."
"4750190","4751030"," They're going to blow your face off. "
"4753790","4754230"," Unreal."
"4754650","4755470"," Unreal stuff."
"4756030","4757370"," This stuff goes against. "
"4758690","4760190"," So I can't describe."
"4760630","4761950"," I'm not going to describe what I'm here."
"4762670","4765450"," I want to try to describe one of them to you without giving it away. "
"4767500","4770760"," So one of these are two of these tools."
"4771160","4771940"," I think it's two of them."
"4772580","4781820"," Two of the tools that I was given a preview of had shows"
"4781820","4788880"," what you're fed on the news media and social media. "
"4789240","4796580"," So social media, news media, what you consume, narratives that you're given."
"4796580","4799640"," And what you're told."
"4801400","4803520"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"4803940","4805600"," Oh, yeah."
"4806460","4807320"," Hold on."
"4807400","4808260"," You're going to look at my shit. "
"4808740","4810080"," Come on back over here."
"4811580","4813160"," Because I can't give this away."
"4813160","4822700"," But basically, some very strongly held narratives and viewpoints by both bulls and bears. "
"4824260","4832080"," Some narratives that bulls and bears are fed and narratives that both tend to agree on."
"4834610","4835890"," Well, this is cool."
"4836190","4837590"," I can't give it away right now. "
"4837950","4839890"," I'm under a non-disclosure."
"4841430","4846710"," But the facts are that this is not true."
"4847870","4849730"," And so it's fascinating. "
"4850090","4857390"," So it's in this information is clear and concise and in quote unquote, dumb down."
"4858970","4860730"," So which is my favorite information."
"4861210","4861750"," I always like. "
"4862150","4863970"," I always like dumb down."
"4864190","4867510"," I never like to see or consume or."
"4868130","4868670"," All right. "
"4868870","4869050"," I don't."
"4869250","4871210"," I like the data sets in the background."
"4871650","4871890"," I like. "
"4871890","4873210"," I like to."
"4874550","4876890"," Like, you know, it was done well."
"4877770","4879110"," Jedi Marcus, right. "
"4880650","4882870"," Was able to simply explain."
"4884090","4885250"," How he trades."
"4885710","4890930"," And then I think of course lower fat, and someone else did a white paper on it. "
"4891590","4898050"," And the cool part was it was simply explained even in the white paper with the technical knowledge"
"4898050","4898990"," you needed to understand."
"4899980","4902050"," To execute oftentimes."
"4903330","4906550"," I'll see information posed on the Internet. "
"4907390","4910750"," That that either isn't based in fact, right?"
"4910970","4911470"," So then you get."
"4912990","4914550"," Source trust me, bro."
"4915170","4921130"," Or you get information on the Internet and it's so hard to decipher. "
"4923450","4927970"," That you're left saying, okay, I don't, I don't know what I'm doing here."
"4928550","4929070"," Right."
"4929310","4930790"," This isn't actionable for me. "
"4931150","4934690"," And I just need to simply explain so that I can make it actionable."
"4935250","4936590"," How often do you see that?"
"4936730","4939350"," You see posts by people."
"4939530","4942170"," You see comment sections just littered with. "
"4942170","4943370"," I have no idea what they're talking about."
"4943850","4944530"," You see."
"4945530","4946830"," We see like a disconnect. "
"4948190","4949230"," Between technical."
"4950270","4950490"," Information."
"4951210","4953930"," And then how do I execute that?"
"4957050","4958650"," Often you see it all the time. "
"4958910","4960370"," There's layers to it, right?"
"4960750","4961730"," You can see it in."
"4963930","4964450"," Economists."
"4964790","4965310"," Treat. "
"4965970","4967830"," The economists would like like this."
"4971390","4974590"," Then by the time you get a like newspapers disseminated."
"4975890","4978050"," CNBC disseminates it to you and market watch. "
"4978250","4982010"," And then of course you're regurgitating it on social media."
"4982010","4983730"," It's not you, but someone is."
"4983970","4985290"," And then you're finally consuming it. "
"4985410","4987370"," You're just like drinking the cup of coffee or the tea."
"4987790","4988850"," That's been brewed for you."
"4988930","4990150"," And it's absolutely fucking wrong. "
"4990430","4990450"," Right."
"4991970","4995290"," And so I was able to see some of these tools that had the, had the."
"4996110","4997810"," A lot of this data. "
"5000610","5005050"," And the end result in a clear and concise way to view it."
"5005470","5006370"," And it was mind blowing."
"5006710","5010270"," It was mind blowing because some of this I'm aware of. "
"5010810","5016550"," But to have the data to back up the claims that get pounded into the ground is not being real"
"5016550","5019310"," is an amazing thing to see."
"5021490","5022650"," To see in a tool."
"5022890","5023610"," So it was really cool. "
"5025290","5027990"," So anyway, you guys are going to get that down the road."
"5028150","5028650"," It's kind of cool."
"5034220","5036260"," Talk to me like a gold or a tree where it wants to bag. "
"5038880","5039260"," Exactly."
"5039720","5042280"," It's a you want like you want the data."
"5042520","5043120"," You want the information. "
"5043460","5044020"," You want the facts."
"5044540","5047480"," You don't want to have to decipher them."
"5048160","5048220"," Right. "
"5049120","5050780"," Some people do want to decipher them."
"5050940","5053180"," So they give you all those options."
"5053400","5053420"," Right. "
"5053580","5054160"," Here's the complex."
"5055060","5056080"," Here's the intermediate."
"5056460","5057140"," Here's the simple. "
"5057680","5060000"," And here's the truth versus what you told."
"5060880","5062640"," And how is that actionable."
"5063400","5066220"," So that still becomes I'll put that yellow box back up here for you. "
"5066320","5068560"," So you guys have it was there a moment ago."
"5069100","5069860"," Right there."
"5070600","5073260"," And all you're looking for is same thing. "
"5073260","5073500"," Right."
"5073940","5077580"," Remember we have the interaction of the of the white line the one minute right here."
"5078300","5082480"," You want to see you have a little bit of volatility here and you want to see that interaction on"
"5082480","5082980"," the white line. "
"5083900","5086660"," You've got your buy button for our two down below here."
"5087320","5088360"," So here right here."
"5089400","5090340"," This is your ad button. "
"5091860","5093400"," You buy the one or not you."
"5094660","5096960"," I buy the one minute and."
"5098780","5101300"," Personally I don't normally add on the five minute. "
"5101980","5106280"," So if I get rolled over on a one minute trade usually this is what happens if it happens to"
"5106280","5106400"," me."
"5106780","5109080"," Sometimes some happen to market will get rolled over."
"5109720","5111780"," And I don't know if we lose the one minute. "
"5112640","5114660"," We'll typically get another squeeze higher."
"5114920","5115920"," So I'll add right here."
"5116900","5118480"," And I will on F my position. "
"5120000","5123460"," Sometimes we even continue higher even on a roll over the five minute."
"5123460","5128240"," What the bears really want here is they want to see the roll over of not only the one minute."
"5128800","5129940"," But then the five minute. "
"5130100","5132020"," This is where the big bloodbath is down below."
"5132620","5133800"," So until that happens."
"5134480","5140960"," I'm always looking to either take this long or dollar cost average for one more trip higher. "
"5142060","5148380"," And you'll start to see at some point in the day it's already 1041 right now."
"5149620","5154580"," Look this is almost an interaction of the one minute not quite we like to see the touch of the"
"5154580","5154940"," one minute."
"5155780","5161180"," And we want to see a new high on the hour and we got one right here. "
"5161220","5162260"," So we're still bullish here."
"5162920","5168540"," But if we start to see it taking a little bit longer than expect to start to make new highs"
"5168540","5169080"," at any point."
"5169820","5174120"," Then we'll start to reconsider a sideways or sideways down move after this. "
"5178840","5180500"," So back to the tools man."
"5180740","5181860"," We got some super cool tools."
"5182080","5183920"," I don't know what I can talk about some of it I can talk about. "
"5184920","5186580"," I think it talks about someone on Saturday."
"5186960","5187440"," We've got a."
"5188500","5190060"," We've got some stock picker tools."
"5193000","5195880"," For you for you to look at with white papers we've got. "
"5197580","5199120"," So you can do your own due diligence."
"5199720","5201360"," You can decide if that's for you."
"5202100","5205960"," We've got a super super jacked up. "
"5205960","5214920"," Like trigger system."
"5216080","5225840"," And also the one of the default or faults of the trigger system is that the one of the faults"
"5225840","5233900"," of it is it does not fault I wouldn't say faults but it worked really great on single tickers."
"5233900","5236480"," Not so much on. "
"5238280","5238880"," Indexes."
"5240080","5244780"," So we've added some breath and PPO and PPM stuff to it."
"5245420","5251200"," And some Elliott wave fractals in the background too. "
"5251880","5255400"," So I was running some some some back checks on that stuff over the weekend."
"5255620","5257160"," Those are some back tests in this weekend."
"5258040","5260700"," And for ETFs it's going to be. "
"5261520","5264340"," Crazy just had a huge buy volume step in the market."
"5264940","5267120"," See that big old green volume bar down below."
"5268740","5270940"," Should get a move here in just a few moments. "
"5272880","5279300"," So we're trying to beef up like a beef up beef is this thing up to work for work well"
"5279300","5280360"," with ETFs."
"5281200","5284480"," And it also would work well on inverse ETFs."
"5286680","5291820"," I think I had a conversation this weekend or into the weekend with Matthew Ryan about it. "
"5292980","5295840"," So you could actually see where to sell the market properly."
"5296740","5300880"," Selling the five minute selling a retest of the five minute that kind of stuff."
"5301020","5305700"," So if you're a bear out there, you're going to be very happy with that as well for the indexes. "
"5306700","5307740"," Wouldn't take that trade."
"5308060","5309820"," Matter of fact, last week there was a cool."
"5310440","5312840"," I'll show you guys one of these things in the background here. "
"5323740","5326180"," What's really cool here is here."
"5326240","5326580"," I'll show you guys."
"5326720","5327600"," I'm really cool in the background. "
"5328620","5329060"," So."
"5330800","5333320"," I'll show you guys some really fucking cool here in the background."
"5333920","5334120"," So. "
"5337020","5338220"," Give me a second here."
"5339420","5341000"," If you want to see some cool shit."
"5344300","5345280"," You're going to get. "
"5348400","5351340"," They will be on the tool."
"5352820","5355160"," Like an alert will pop up right here."
"5357480","5360740"," And an alert will pop up right here to sell. "
"5361580","5362580"," Before it happens."
"5363560","5366020"," You get another alert right here to sell before it happens."
"5366800","5369640"," You'll get another alert down below here. "
"5370420","5371300"," Oh, this is Tesla."
"5372240","5373680"," But it wouldn't matter beyond."
"5374040","5375160"," Oh, that squeeze on Tesla. "
"5375160","5376820"," We called this one just a few minutes ago."
"5378600","5381440"," You're going to be so this will stay on Tesla for a minute."
"5381580","5384200"," You want to see this one minute come back up this five minute underneath. "
"5385120","5387800"," Come back down and slam into one ninety five fifty."
"5388480","5390600"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"5390960","5396800"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick. "
"5398740","5400400"," Looking back on the spy right here."
"5400720","5401820"," So you can see this."
"5402480","5403980"," I want to see some crazy here. "
"5405200","5406400"," It would have called."
"5407280","5411460"," The tool would have called this cell part this part of the cell right here."
"5411600","5413000"," And this part of the cell right here. "
"5413700","5416540"," So you're getting like an alert right on the screen that says sell."
"5417620","5418300"," Not sell, but."
"5420900","5422760"," I'm not going to say what it's going to say, but. "
"5424480","5426560"," You would know to sell the market right here."
"5427300","5429280"," And then down here you get an alert."
"5429920","5433240"," Down here you'll get an alert that will tell you that it's bottoming. "
"5434740","5437740"," So you could actually you could actually know when to close."
"5438260","5440760"," Know when to sell and take this entire move right here."
"5441500","5442520"," Which is kind of wild. "
"5444680","5446900"," So we're looking at that over the weekend as well."
"5447040","5447680"," Look at that one minute."
"5447680","5448520"," Just defense. "
"5449180","5449760"," Look at that."
"5449920","5451280"," Just defend all this right here."
"5451380","5451900"," See this right here. "
"5451960","5452560"," You get this alert."
"5452960","5454440"," This morning you would get that alert."
"5456360","5458020"," And you're not even over the. "
"5459960","5461120"," Crazy as you want to see."
"5461300","5461940"," You want to see power."
"5462540","5463840"," We're not even above here. "
"5463980","5465320"," We're not even at the cell stage yet."
"5465420","5465700"," Look at this."
"5465780","5466940"," This is where the cell stage is above. "
"5467720","5469560"," So you get another let's says self right."
"5471080","5472760"," So you see this gray box down here."
"5474380","5475720"," You see this gray box down here. "
"5476760","5479000"," So this gray box hasn't even come up yet."
"5480580","5484040"," To tell you that the upside move is finished."
"5485440","5485960"," Is that crazy?"
"5487500","5488820"," See almost like a meter. "
"5489520","5491040"," You would have like the alert."
"5492400","5494240"," Then you would have like an indicator."
"5496120","5499520"," And the indicator would start at like starting to be bullish. "
"5500700","5502160"," Almost there crank and high speed."
"5502880","5503760"," Start taking some money off."
"5504660","5505980"," Probably going to roll over. "
"5507180","5509320"," With like a with like an arrow."
"5510300","5511660"," Like cranks over."
"5512600","5513200"," Right. "
"5513500","5515420"," Almost like a RPMs or something."
"5517400","5519220"," So it's pretty wild."
"5523910","5525350"," It's pretty it's pretty wild. "
"5529250","5531250"," It's going to it's going to blow your face off."
"5537470","5539910"," P.T. above still four twelve twelve."
"5549340","5549840"," Yes. "
"5551500","5553080"," Yes improved or not."
"5553220","5553860"," It's not an emoy."
"5554860","5556340"," But it's close to an emoy. "
"5556900","5557680"," It's not the same."
"5557800","5560360"," I check to see if it was the same numbers and it's not."
"5561920","5565580"," I think I'm using I think the equations on using are different. "
"5569160","5571420"," Is it subscription based yet has to be."
"5571760","5572620"," I can't."
"5573140","5574720"," So some of the stuff is free. "
"5574720","5578160"," And so as you know me right now all remains free."
"5578400","5580460"," So like you you'll see the live streams will be free."
"5581840","5583940"," But the tool some of the tools are free. "
"5586420","5589520"," Because they don't cost anything or they're very cheaply to do."
"5589800","5592120"," But some of the tools that we're making cost data."
"5592920","5597780"," That stuff costs 15 grand a month to have for you. "
"5598820","5601440"," So for you guys to have that stuff you have to pay for."
"5601560","5602600"," There's no way around it."
"5603600","5605120"," That's just due to the cost to me. "
"5606880","5609780"," Now that this is real time data you're not getting."
"5611640","5615640"," Some of I think the I think some of it's delayed on the free stuff."
"5615880","5617060"," But the real time data stuff. "
"5618080","5619580"," Is super expensive."
"5620040","5620520"," It's ridiculous."
"5621420","5623400"," It's like a minimum of fifteen K a month. "
"5624120","5629460"," Now trading for eleven twenty one price target remains intact above at four twelve twelve."
"5631320","5634400"," Fifteen thousand dollars a month at minimum for the cost."
"5634860","5635560"," That's that minimum. "
"5636680","5643860"," But then we've got moderators and developers in the background that kind of stuff."
"5644100","5646060"," So we've got costs all with that stuff."
"5646280","5650040"," We've got just just expensive. "
"5650520","5653800"," It's probably going to I don't know what it's going to cost at this point."
"5653820","5656880"," But I know that it's going to be probably somewhere around twenty thirty K a month."
"5658320","5659580"," For all of it minimum. "
"5664700","5668040"," You're still extending gains here with the NASDAQ up around one percent now."
"5668240","5669340"," I feel like that Tesla move."
"5670000","5672120"," How do you like that spy move baby?"
"5675480","5676760"," I feel like that spy move. "
"5676940","5678160"," How do you like that Tesla move?"
"5679840","5683040"," How do you like that Tesla squeeze up there?"
"5684240","5686880"," How do you like that spy move right there?"
"5688000","5689960"," You guys making money out there."
"5692760","5696120"," So yeah if you're following me now as it is nothing changes."
"5698620","5699880"," If you want. "
"5700400","5704740"," But you know I have to I have guys that are going to be doing some Elliott wave stuff for"
"5704740","5704880"," you."
"5704940","5706120"," I've got guys that are going to be doing."
"5706620","5708380"," I don't have them right now. "
"5708500","5712340"," I'm actually looking for I'm looking for anyone that wants to contribute Elliott wave."
"5714000","5717520"," Stop in either written form or in videos."
"5718700","5726260"," I'd even be willing to help someone along with that if they're if they have some like hey I can"
"5726260","5726620"," do this. "
"5727220","5728240"," And I'm good at this."
"5730160","5736700"," And then I'm also looking for someone to make videos and daily briefs and weekly Greek apps stuff"
"5736700","5737120"," like that."
"5737280","5739520"," But all that stuff you know it's people's time man. "
"5739880","5742820"," You can't just say to people hey this is you know you're working."
"5744800","5750240"," For for nothing right now you want to do like some contributor stuff and try to gain traction for"
"5750240","5750560"," people."
"5750980","5756480"," For guests writers and guests guests that appeared stuff like that but people have lives man. "
"5757800","5759640"," If the if the content is good."
"5760440","5765800"," You have to make sure that they stay that they stay engaged and all that kind of stuff these people"
"5765800","5767020"," that people put time into the stuff."
"5767540","5772040"," Use a prime example of this aside with someone over the same with someone over the weekend about"
"5772040","5773120"," Derek. "
"5773380","5775820"," I have a lot of respect to that guy."
"5776180","5780280"," That guy pre-covid where I was having a friend I'm like man pre-covid."
"5781400","5787120"," Derek was the guy man and people got upset Derek for I think Derek started 25 bucks or something. "
"5788040","5793240"," But Derek doesn't kind of work you know out there and did not it cost money cost time and money."
"5794000","5800420"," There's a lot of stuff out there that's either overpriced or you don't getting actual actionable"
"5800420","5802760"," data presented to you."
"5803420","5807680"," And there's some that is like Derek man like how do you not support that guy for all the work"
"5807680","5808620"," that our work that he does. "
"5809160","5809980"," You have to."
"5810840","5812640"," Hey legend X X thank you brother."
"5813140","5813560"," Whoo. "
"5814300","5815120"," Good morning right."
"5815620","5816560"," Good morning everybody."
"5817820","5822080"," Good morning legend X 222 X thank you for supporting the channel brother. "
"5822080","5823920"," I appreciate it."
"5825340","5826280"," And that's it right."
"5826880","5831100"," And here's the other thing so Chen just said I can't wait for the tools. "
"5831620","5834640"," Proof will be in the pudding if it works helps cost of entry is negligible."
"5835300","5836400"," And here's the last part of it."
"5836780","5840400"," None of this stuff is hidden behind the paywall to begin. "
"5840920","5841240"," So."
"5842160","5846860"," You guys can say and there's I was talking to a buddy over the weekend about that another I was"
"5846860","5848780"," talking to take jazz about this over the weekend."
"5849700","5851160"," I was like basically here's the deal. "
"5852120","5852780"," Here's the deal."
"5852900","5853680"," Here's the basic deal."
"5855240","5857960"," If you're a poor trader you can get by with the free. "
"5859660","5864260"," That will always be there if you're like the poor trader you get away with you'll get you'll always"
"5864260","5865140"," get by with the free."
"5866520","5872200"," If you are making money and you're serious about this you'll support what we're doing."
"5873500","5874880"," And so it's negligible. "
"5875460","5881620"," If you're a trader that makes a lot of money and you just want you just want the triggers."
"5881740","5883000"," It's going to cost some money."
"5884100","5890060"," So you'll never be you'll never meet me and not have an option for it to work for you. "
"5890260","5893640"," And the last part of that whole entire thing is everybody gets to test it."
"5893860","5899000"," So on the 10 minutes away now to be getting New York Fed inflation expectations as well."
"5899000","5903340"," I wish for today comments from ECB since you know just a note here that there is some natural"
"5903340","5904820"," resistance where we are currently. "
"5905200","5907280"," You can see Tesla the same thing."
"5907800","5913160"," So you should see a quick I'm going to show you guys something in the background that you don't see"
"5913160","5913560"," on spy."
"5917270","5922930"," That you can see on another you could take not good but you've got reason. "
"5923270","5924550"," So I want you to see something here."
"5926130","5932570"," So ECB Centino speaks at the London School of Economics about the surging inflation and war."
"5933970","5937030"," So if you are a Tesla bull right here even a spy bull right. "
"5937570","5942570"," Tesla is likely going to pull back to the one minute and make the next move above to 19850."
"5942910","5944550"," Sometimes it can break above here."
"5944890","5945590"," That's that consolidation phase. "
"5946330","5948750"," You get your next target above 19850."
"5948970","5950410"," Tesla could roll over here."
"5950410","5952570"," Tesla doesn't want to give up the one minute. "
"5954090","5958650"," You guys do you guys get to use this on every single fucking ticker out there."
"5958750","5964030"," I don't care what it is futures currencies commodities."
"5964610","5966530"," You can do it on cash market. "
"5967250","5967810"," It's insane."
"5968370","5972910"," The interface is awesome."
"5973310","5974350"," It's like intuitive. "
"5975450","5978530"," No, no jankiness multiple timeframes."
"5978690","5980370"," Dude, I got something else to tell you."
"5980990","5982030"," If you're a bear. "
"5982470","5985350"," Dude, I've got the I've got the fucking price targets."
"5985550","5989830"," So five minutes away now to give the New York Fed inflation expectations as well."

"6056610","6057670"," That's for 13 20. "
"6058430","6059850"," We could get a failure up here."

"6085210","6085990"," It's somewhere in here."
"6087090","6089370"," It could not be exactly for 12."

"6099070","6100250"," Let's see here."

"6106120","6107960"," You've got this one right here. "
"6108880","6110100"," It could be right here."
"6111620","6113700"," Yeah, this one's good right here."
"6114420","6115380"," This one's good right about here. "
"6116120","6117500"," It could be slightly lower."
"6117760","6119320"," Maybe where they teed off like right here."
"6120040","6121320"," It could be slightly lower. "
"6125240","6126620"," Yeah, that's about where it is."
"6127060","6129100"," It's still kind of 4 12 12."
"6130340","6131200"," It's somewhere in there. "
"6134040","6135920"," Somewhere like it's right right here."
"6142480","6143380"," Close to it."
"6144580","6146560"," Move this volatility right here if you wanted. "
"6147840","6149020"," PT two over here."
"6153420","6154460"," Still bullish."
"6155900","6156360"," Still very bullish. "
"6158060","6162880"," We know where the we know where the one minute is down below here."
"6162980","6164300"," So we'll draw this line back in again."
"6164800","6166380"," We know where this is right here. "
"6167620","6175690"," And put that consolidation line just like as we had before."
"6176710","6178510"," We know where our ad lines are."
"6178630","6179590"," We know where our stops are. "
"6179730","6185230"," You can always raise your stops up here as we get closer and closer to the actual topic."
"6185230","6188810"," You can stop doing adding and stopping or stop adding and stop."
"6189070","6191390"," We just start raising your stops at this point. "
"6196040","6199420"," Yeah, we got some cool stuff coming your way insane stuff."
"6199600","6201280"," So I was I ran yesterday."
"6201600","6203100"," I had some time yesterday in the morning. "
"6203660","6204220"," I ran."
"6205700","6208120"," I ran some stuff that isn't like an email."
"6208280","6209000"," This is not an email. "
"6209240","6210940"," Or it is an email or not an email."
"6211220","6214120"," But it's similar to an email."
"6214940","6216040"," But I was able to. "
"6218700","6222260"," Add in some tools to it that shows you."
"6222840","6227840"," We're like the COVID bottom was we're short expecting the New York bad inflation expectations as"
"6227840","6229120"," well as comments from ECB."
"6231340","6236420"," Accurately predict bottoms on 2000 2008. "
"6239400","6242340"," 2087 18 whole bunch of another time frames."
"6243000","6245300"," And some bottoms for our stock market."
"6245800","6250820"," So when we when we see bottom in our stock market, there's I've got price targets for you like to"
"6250820","6251720"," the exact to the penny. "
"6252500","6259580"," which is kind of cool that historically hold true."
"6260040","6261160"," So it's super fucking cool."
"6263870","6266410"," I've got a crash or on the same tool. "
"6266630","6267990"," I've got a crash alert on it."
"6268410","6273570"," So if we begin the crash, if we start to see breath, leave the market and momentum and price"
"6273570","6274470"," velocity on the downside."
"6275870","6277510"," Actually, it doesn't even start like that. "
"6277590","6283650"," It starts with a loss of momentum and then price velocity that is bad."
"6283710","6288930"," New York said says the January one year ahead expected inflation unchanged with 5% versus December"
"6288930","6295290"," and the January three year ahead expected inflation to spot 7% versus two spot 9% in December and"
"6295290","6299830"," the January expected household spending at 5 spot 7% versus 5 spot 9% in December."
"6300290","6305590"," And the New York Fed says the January expected household income drop was the greatest in survey in"
"6305590","6306270"," his survey history. "
"6306750","6312190"," And the New York Fed January expected household income come drops to 3.3% versus 4.6% in"
"6312190","6317050"," December and the households in January expected higher food and gasoline costs."
"6317810","6324390"," The New York Fed says the January expected home price rises at 1.1% versus 1.3% in"
"6324390","6330610"," December and the New York Fed says the January 5 year ahead expected inflation at 2.5% versus 2 "
"6330610","6331890",".4% in December."
"6333050","6339870"," So right where Tesla is at this moment, if you're a Tesla bull out there, this is where you'll know"
"6339870","6341590"," if Tesla is going to continue higher or not. "
"6342470","6348390"," So Tesla is re-testing, it's one minute trigger and below right where we are right now, let me see"
"6348390","6351390"," if I can move this over for you so you can see it."
"6352890","6354270"," I'm going to show you guys some here."
"6361900","6364540"," So Tesla came up, had a nice beautiful little run right here. "
"6366400","6367600"," Here's its one minute trigger."
"6368160","6375660"," Tesla wants to take off from here, this is $1.39 or $1.94 excuse me, $0.03 and at"
"6375660","6377940"," least check a second time for the double top."
"6379660","6386800"," And Tesla can also pull back right now down to $1.93 or so and it needs to hold this"
"6386800","6389680"," okay for the double top check or a break above. "
"6391820","6399280"," Now if the run is over on spy, you'll see a break of $1.93. So you let's say you"
"6399280","6403880"," see a move down like this, if there's like a quick bloodbath or anything like that, they usually"
"6403880","6405700"," squeeze back up and then continue lower."
"6406580","6411960"," So you want to put some stops down below at $1.93 on Tesla and this is another buying opportunity"
"6411960","6417240"," as well on Tesla to at least go back up and retest this $1.96. Now if Tesla is able"
"6417240","6423960"," to break above $1.96 and hold it, if it trades higher here, you'd take you take take your winnings,"
"6424260","6430820"," look to see if this becomes consolidation, they'll make another move higher to $1.98 right in here."
"6434020","6439100"," So some technical trading you have to do or tactical trading you have to do on Tesla currently. "
"6440300","6444620"," And we'll look for at least one more retest in here before there's a rejection if there is a"
"6444620","6452260"," rejection, I don't know if there is or not, but if it holds above $1.9558 and can consolidate, the"
"6452260","6453040"," run is not over."
"6453700","6459320"," As we come up here though, I want you to know as a spy bull, Tesla bull, this is kind"
"6459320","6462020"," of going to be one of the places start taking some money off right."
"6462700","6466720"," And even if we break above here, it's going to be the last place for you to take some money"
"6466720","6469780"," off your bull in the market and that kind of lines up with the time of the day. "
"6470520","6472240"," So you'll be waiting for this."
"6473500","6479260"," So if you're a spy bull right now, there's kind of two places right you're going to be as we"
"6479260","6483640"," come up here and trade up here, you're going to want to take some money off and then you can"
"6483640","6488480"," leave one runner on or if you have a retest down below here and maybe a failed attempt above up"
"6488480","6488660"," here."
"6489260","6492480"," So I'm going to show you guys conceptually what you should be doing here. "
"6493120","6494960"," We'll see this one minute try trade higher."
"6495940","6501280"," You'll see one more attempt for a new high if it whether it does or it doesn't, it doesn't get"
"6501280","6501620"," a matter."
"6502000","6506100"," You're going to be looking for that for that test of the one minute once more and then possibly a"
"6506100","6508120"," failure above trying to get up here to this 413. "
"6510300","6510900"," Makes sense?"
"6512160","6517360"," So we're starting to get, we're not quite long on the tooth, but we're starting that process right"
"6517360","6517620"," now."
"6529340","6530220"," Hey, sugars, how are you?"
"6531560","6533260"," How are you doing, sugars 12?"
"6533260","6541400"," Well, you're in Tesla Weekly Puts."
"6542800","6552760"," On Tesla Weekly Puts, you want to see, you want to see,"
"6554280","6557320"," let me see here, I'll help you out if you're in Tesla Puts. "
"6562800","6563540"," You'd really like"
"6563540","6573680"," to"
"6575370","6579610"," see like a I'll give you a, I'll tell you one thing, if we squeeze above at any point right"
"6579610","6589330"," now currently, 198, 198, 11 and hold that, we're probably going to trade"
"6589330","6590530"," 220, 72."
"6595640","6605680"," And from if we hold 220 and consolidate there, the correction is can be technically over, can"
"6605680","6607020"," possibly be technically over."
"6611920","6617760"," Or at least in the, at least until we get some some fundamental change in what a fundamental change"
"6617760","6619680"," in what the Fed is doing. "
"6620740","6622360"," Otherwise, you're fighting the Fed right now."
"6622660","6630400"," A bear would be considered fighting the Fed currently in the, currently in this market."
"6631340","6635280"," So you can go back and, you know, I'll try to do for you guys, I think I've done this"
"6635280","6635740"," in the past. "
"6636480","6643820"," You probably, you could probably, or I'll try to do for you guys, I'll try to show you guys again,"
"6643820","6648680"," the Fed funds rate, unemployment, inflation."
"6650100","6653000"," I'll try to show you the, I'll bring up the yield curve with you."
"6653740","6656220"," And then I'll show you the price of SPX historically. "
"6658320","6666560"," Right now until the Fed changes, it's stance from, we could possibly continue to raise rates."
"6668580","6673100"," That will get from, the front running of the next leg down is delayed."
"6675830","6680050"," He kind of, he kind of fucked bears. "
"6680990","6683770"," He fucked him at the last rate meeting, is what he did."
"6684850","6686130"," And I didn't see that coming."
"6686350","6687930"," I'll be honest with you, I didn't see that coming at all. "
"6688630","6689750"," I thought they were going to cut rates."
"6690310","6691450"," I was trying to sell the market."
"6693410","6701210"," I was like, I was, my anticipation was that, that at one of these Fed meetings, we'd get a rate"
"6701210","6702910"," cut or a pause. "
"6703410","6705810"," We'd probably squeeze higher for the day."
"6706210","6712490"," And then I would short the entire market for a massive bloodbath."
"6713570","6718370"," And him not cutting rates, him staying the path. "
"6718970","6723910"," And then the last rate decision, man, when he said, we're not done with rates after this next"
"6724470","6729330"," increase, that was, I was like, fuck, this guy's, he's, he's prolonging right now."
"6729970","6732590"," He's prolonging rate cuts at this point."
"6732830","6734110"," He knows the effect of that. "
"6735350","6740930"," It would be a disaster if they front ran it right now."
"6741750","6744330"," They have to front run it when unemployment's high."
"6745170","6751270"," The crazy part is too, we have examples in the past where the, what will happen here is the"
"6751270","6753130"," inverted yield curve. "
"6753910","6755410"," We'll start bouncing around sideways."
"6756050","6762570"," It'll come up and bounce up and down, up and down until he actually does say this is the last"
"6762570","6764930"," cut or excuse me, the last increase."
"6766570","6773210"," Or, you know, these last two or this last one, I think you'll get that 12th, 18th month pricing in"
"6773210","6774590"," of those cuts. "
"6776980","6777540"," So it's wild."
"6778400","6780620"," We have examples of this in the past too."
"6783880","6785740"," We actually have examples of this in the past. "
"6791950","6793390"," He bought them on the rejection of the early."
"6796480","6797760"," Capital to be no rate cut."
"6798040","6798280"," That's this. "
"6798580","6799700"," Oh, so that's another cool thing."
"6799900","6801680"," So Jimmy Perry's bringing up a great fucking point."
"6803400","6807000"," That comes with, you know what's fascinating about that. "
"6807100","6809420"," I've been, I haven't delved into it at this point."
"6811340","6815880"," But I'm fascinated by it because I don't think no one wants to talk about that publicly."
"6816460","6822140"," You get some talk about that, but not really major discussion for research. "
"6822740","6829600"," I would love, unless you guys have seen something, I would love, love to see someone release some"
"6829600","6834520"," kind of an in-depth rabbit hole."
"6834620","6841340"," Matter of fact, if you guys ever know like a famous YouTuber that does really great research videos"
"6841340","6845540"," that they make, I know there's some guys out there that are women men that don't care who you are,"
"6845640","6848480"," but I know that there are YouTubers out there just some really good research."
"6849360","6853960"," But Jimmy Perry brings up a really good point that I'm sure people are wondering. "
"6854980","6864120"," And that is where the intersect between like the economy, the main street, Wall Street, the"
"6864120","6866720"," economy, and politics gets involved."
"6867120","6869160"," Like when politics matter in the stock market."
"6870160","6877100"," And that is a scary question, Jimmy, because we've had examples of that, right?"
"6878160","6879200"," There was a time. "
"6879740","6881780"," Well, some of you know this and some of you don't."
"6882580","6892540"," But there was a time when the Fed used rates, like small rate increases"
"6892540","6902340"," over time to actually tamper the stock market and not let it grow, but not try to smash it down"
"6902340","6902760"," either."
"6904040","6907920"," And we had jobs for everybody. "
"6909180","6913600"," And we had a stock market that was just sideways and up."
"6913800","6915560"," We'd come down a little bit and we'd sideways it up."
"6916380","6926000"," This was during the 1950s, 1960s, and even into the 70s to an extent. "
"6927840","6935880"," We had a period of what 30 years that we can actually look at where the Fed"
"6935880","6940820"," actually tried to tighten, but not over tighten the market."
"6941000","6943800"," It was this, it was this different viewpoint."
"6944340","6949060"," Instead of like MMT, like water monetary theory, we'll just turn the money printer on and then"
"6949060","6952340"," we're going to raise rates and we're going to turn the money printer on. "
"6952460","6954600"," We get these wild swings in the market."
"6955360","6958860"," But some of that was Paul, Paul political driven."
"6959640","6964580"," And we heard of President Biden recently a few speeches, right?"
"6965480","6969840"," Where he said people are going to have jobs. "
"6970880","6972040"," Everyone's going to be working."
"6972460","6978080"," So this is like a, this is like a mindset from politics and the Fed possibly."
"6978460","6979460"," We can't prove this yet. "
"6979920","6981460"," We can look back in time if it happens."
"6982180","6989340"," But the fascinating part about this too is you've seen other political parties come into power and"
"6989340","6993880"," they've said things like, oh no, we're going to make, we're going to make everybody rich, right?"
"6994480","6996800"," We're going to get this economy back on track again."
"6997620","7001980"," I'm not going to name names or parties, but you'll see this, right?"
"7002540","7009680"," And if you have a different political regime or mindset, so the question becomes how long can you"
"7009680","7010100"," do this?"
"7011280","7012680"," I'm not saying I want to do this. "
"7012820","7020860"," I'm just saying, this is a, this is almost a partnership or is starting to look like it, right?"
"7020980","7027520"," It's starting to look, walk and talk like a partnership between the Fed and the powers that be."
"7028840","7029700"," But how long does that last?"
"7029700","7032180"," That is the big question, right?"
"7032400","7034380"," So talk to you guys about some weakness here."
"7034440","7035460"," I want to show you guys something here. "
"7035460","7037740"," We're starting to get failure of a new high."
"7037860","7039300"," We didn't get a test yet of the one minute."
"7039380","7043960"," This is the first test of the one minute, but we're getting a little bit of long on the tooth"
"7043960","7044240"," here. "
"7045180","7047060"," So we want to see what the reaction is right here."
"7047080","7051880"," This would be a place where you bring your stops up and you just don't want to get caught in"
"7051880","7053580"," this if it goes down, right?"
"7054000","7055020"," It's not quite fine here."
"7055060","7056580"," You just want to see what the interaction is. "
"7056580","7058160"," You could take some money off if you need to."
"7058920","7061660"," I'm going to change some stops here."
"7061800","7062000"," Hold on. "
"7071630","7073470"," You might want to raise the stops here."
"7073830","7076850"," We're going to probably get this, probably get this up here."
"7077530","7079530"," PT1, and possibly we got this above, right?"
"7079710","7080970"," Questions to draw like that. "
"7081130","7081610"," Something like this."
"7082390","7083030"," Tag PT1."
"7083230","7087810"," Come back and recheck the one minute chart over here again. "
"7088770","7089990"," Now, but you want to raise your stops up here."
"7090050","7092030"," We're going to get a little long on the tooth, right?"
"7092210","7093430"," Start taking some money off."
"7093530","7094490"," Start taking some winnings. "
"7094970","7096550"," You can kind of see this curling over."
"7096690","7098250"," See that one minute curling over like this?"
"7099090","7101190"," Starting to see a little, see this curve here."
"7102170","7104250"," See this curve starting to curve over. "
"7104410","7108410"," It's giving you a hint here that we might get a failure of a new high."
"7110010","7113190"," So you just want to keep your eye on that attention to detail."
"7114130","7115190"," You never want to give up money. "
"7115630","7122350"," If we end up coming down here to the five minute, we could entertain buying another rip higher."
"7122990","7128170"," So maybe he buys now down here, stops you raising them up to the one minute, and we're going to"
"7128170","7133970"," attack that for a 12-11, and we want to see if we can maintain momentum higher."
"7136350","7140550"," And we have put out the New York Fed inflation expectations for report on the new tooth for those"
"7140550","7141310"," of you that are interested. "
"7142010","7148450"," So back to Jimmy Berry, what his point is, it's unusual right now."
"7148450","7153230"," If you're a young person, it's unusual to see this."
"7153770","7162130"," You would expect normally, you would expect normally for a market cycle to look like we cleaned out"
"7162130","7163270"," everyone with bad debt. "
"7164850","7170610"," And we're going to usher in this younger generation to take some risk on."
"7170970","7178570"," But currently, at the moment, there is a different approach being taken."
"7179270","7185170"," I don't know if this is fattled white people that want to maintain their wealth that they've"
"7185170","7185470"," created. "
"7185470","7186950"," I don't know where it's coming from."
"7187350","7192250"," If the billionaires don't want to give it up or something in their in their 80s, so they want to"
"7192250","7199570"," maintain that wealth, if they're going to if they're going to throw pennies at the young crowd and"
"7199570","7202250"," say, Oh, no, you're going to work harder for the next 30 years."
"7203990","7207690"," And you're not going to get rich, you're just going to be able to live. "
"7208830","7211030"," But there's that is going on in the background."
"7212070","7215890"," There's there's like, we're not whispers, but there's signs of it."
"7216210","7221290"," You know, the best thing to do it be, I haven't talked to my dad about this, but I should"
"7221290","7227950"," probably go and ask my father about this because I'm getting that with getting that bids for six"
"7227950","7232910"," months bills total six billion dollars and fed bids for three month bills total seven spot five"
"7232910","7233790"," billion dollars. "
"7234390","7236670"," You get that you get that smell."
"7240220","7242360"," You get you definitely get that smell."
"7243280","7244380"," Cut that sniff to it. "
"7244540","7245240"," It's got that sniff."
"7246780","7252340"," So it would be crazy because you know what you would do is you would be you would be stopping."
"7253180","7254300"," Some people agree with this. "
"7254400","7254900"," They like this."
"7255260","7255760"," That's fine."
"7256620","7260620"," But this definitely does stop upward movements for people. "
"7261400","7265380"," There's a there's a tampering of upward movements or upward mobility class mobility."
"7266620","7268820"," But that would leave the question too, right?"
"7269020","7274680"," Would be does it have the effect of bringing wealth back to the middle class?"
"7275540","7277400"," I don't know if that's the case or not."
"7277600","7278920"," I can't answer that for you. "
"7279580","7282220"," Is it an attempt to bring wealth back to the middle class?"
"7282740","7289940"," And then the other aspects of this would be political political motivations, right?"
"7290440","7293980"," And its impact on monetary policy."
"7300080","7300940"," So it's kind of fascinating."
"7305120","7306540"," Good question, Barry. "
"7306800","7307420"," I appreciate that."
"7312760","7313600"," Yeah, he does."
"7313840","7315220"," Larry Williams is a great job about this. "
"7321150","7321390"," Yeah."
"7321710","7321930"," Yeah."
"7322750","7322890"," No. "
"7323090","7331490"," Well, so well, that my thing is so my thing on my thing on when we when we get the"
"7331490","7336930"," big rug pull is you guys have to remember that the banks were saying back in October."
"7337130","7338630"," So you guys can't forget this."
"7338770","7339790"," I don't want you guys to forget this. "
"7340490","7345070"," So like Mike Wilson back in October and said he expects rake cuts."
"7346610","7351390"," You've got major players saying that I can bring it up if you want to look at it."
"7353170","7353930"," You're saying here. "
"7357240","7362720"," So you've got major players out there in October."
"7364200","7365380"," Let me give you a second here."
"7365920","7366940"," We don't want to have short. "
"7367140","7371320"," I know that oftentimes we get bulls and bears."
"7371440","7376760"," I don't think it matters if it's a bull or bear, but I think that we generally you know the"
"7376760","7377620"," stock market is right."
"7377720","7380900"," It's like a we forget. "
"7383470","7386850"," We are we have like we have like the memories of a hamster, don't we?"
"7387450","7391650"," It's like we have memories of a hamster, right?"
"7391950","7392630"," So okay."
"7392690","7393750"," So I want to show you guys something."
"7394530","7395510"," We got our new high here. "
"7395930","7396830"," We're still good."
"7397390","7398470"," I want you to see this."
"7398830","7400050"," We interact with the one minute. "
"7400370","7401290"," We got our new high."
"7401550","7404190"," 411.98. We have not broken the one minute."
"7404430","7407890"," So bearish or bullish trade is still intact. "
"7409830","7411530"," We got it really fast there."
"7412110","7416190"," 411.98. We have memories of like hamsters."
"7417030","7420030"," We're great at regurgitating everything but the news. "
"7421810","7423010"," We're horrible at it."
"7423150","7425670"," We're like, I don't remember your time up."
"7425870","7430310"," Now you remember that I was like, hey, they're going to cut rates and there were some reasons why"
"7430310","7436410"," they're going to cut rates in previous periods of time. "
"7436670","7440750"," And you know what else was crazy was the bond market was predicting cut of rates, right?"
"7440890","7442630"," Bond market was saying they're going to cut rates."
"7443330","7444190"," And I trust the bond."
"7444290","7444850"," I'll be honest with you. "
"7444930","7446090"," I trust the bond market."
"7446190","7447350"," Bond market says they're going to cut rates."
"7448150","7450490"," I'm going with the bond market over anyone else. "
"7450930","7453010"," Now they're not always right, but they're right most of the time."
"7453630","7453890"," They're right."
"7453970","7457290"," They're right enough that they're worth listening to. "
"7458510","7469560"," So here I've got some I've got some articles here on right"
"7469560","7473720"," from October from Mike Wilson saying they've got rates, rate cuts right here in October."
"7474140","7477100"," So this is a long time ago, right?"
"7477840","7479240"," You can just do a Google search."
"7479860","7481660"," You can put the parameters in for the month of October. "
"7482580","7484220"," And I'm reading it right here in the back."
"7484520","7491180"," At 11.30 a.m. Eastern time, the US sells $48 billion in three month bills, private cover of two"
"7491180","7494320"," to 69 and a prior high yield of four spot, five nine percent."
"7494800","7500920"," The US sells $60 billion in six month bills, private cover of two to 63 and a prior high yield"
"7500920","7502900"," of four spot, seven, five, five percent. "
"7504260","7504740"," Yeah."
"7505060","7508560"," So these guys were talking about rate cuts, even back then, the anticipation of rate cuts."
"7508820","7514900"," Now, then President Jerome Powell had said we've got two rate cuts ahead of us. "
"7515100","7520100"," We've got two rate cuts, or he said he planned two rate cuts ahead of us."
"7520820","7525920"," Now, you guys got to remember, right, historically, we just did our last rate increase."
"7526760","7532100"," At that meeting, we had one more left, just one more, and then an anticipated pause. "
"7533160","7535060"," And he and this was his his mantra."
"7535640","7537860"," We've got this one, this one, this one, this one."
"7538180","7543440"," We got to the last one, we had one more left, and then they would look to see, right, and"
"7543440","7546080"," we had anticipated rate cuts in the future. "
"7546600","7547920"," We're a pause and then rate cuts."
"7548420","7554400"," All these fucking banks, right, telling you all these banks in the background, literally are like,"
"7554860","7559620"," okay, so there's no more rate cuts, right, or no more rate increases."
"7560020","7563220"," This is the last, this one and the next one, the last one, that's all they want to know. "
"7563580","7566880"," They're like, this one right here today, this is the last last fed rate decision."
"7566880","7568580"," They want to know two things."
"7568880","7570180"," It's very key things. "
"7571100","7575780"," They want to know is the next rate cut the last one."
"7576360","7579580"," And if he's at that rate decision, and he goes, yes."
"7581500","7585120"," The next one is the last one guaranteed, that's it. "
"7585640","7587200"," And he didn't say that, man."
"7587300","7591520"," He was like, well, we got one more and guess what, we might do more."
"7591760","7593720"," That was a huge demarcation. "
"7597620","7598020"," Huge."
"7598020","7600900"," Oh, Lucy, thanks for supporting the channel."
"7601000","7601540"," I appreciate it. "
"7603000","7604220"," You're making me gush, Lucy."
"7604800","7605220"," Thank you."
"7609860","7611380"," Yeah, I got to talk to him, man. "
"7611560","7612820"," Without a doubt, I got to talk to my dad."
"7613120","7618980"," I have to call him and ask him because he grew up in the, he was born in the early"
"7618980","7619700"," 50s."
"7620120","7627320"," He grew up through the 50s, 60s, 70s, went to war in Vietnam, and I got to ask him about"
"7627320","7630760"," what he thinks about this stuff right now. "
"7632000","7633920"," Because it smells like it to me."
"7640570","7647190"," Yeah, and we can just, you guys, any guys are students of the stock market and our economic"
"7647190","7647630"," history."
"7648390","7650630"," If you, it's funny too, you guys want to hear something cool?"
"7651430","7652290"," Do you want something really cool?"
"7654490","7657470"," This guy right here, Victor Nederhofer. "
"7657930","7660030"," This guy has this book right here that I'm pointing to."
"7660430","7661430"," Victor Nederhofer."
"7662850","7667230"," If you guys see this guy, Victor Nederhofer is a famous stock trader. "
"7668530","7676790"," He was on, he made a post on, he made a post on thin to it that we're likely in"
"7676790","7678690"," a bull market or a bull run right now."
"7678830","7685810"," He said, he made a post where he said, I think we're in a bull run and he commented on"
"7685810","7693750"," the Fed not cutting rates and he corrected himself and he said, I made a mistake."
"7695390","7704910"," He started by saying, if he started by saying, if he started by saying, if he started by saying, if"
"7704910","7710770"," the Fed continues on this path, it'll destroy our markets. "
"7712150","7717130"," And then he made a correction on thin to it and said, uh, correction."
"7717610","7725450"," He goes, the path that the Fed is on, uh, the stock market actually traded sideways and up during"
"7725450","7726310"," that time period."
"7726970","7729490"," And I was like, I was like, Nederhofer got it. "
"7729830","7734830"," I was like, Nederhofer, Nederhofer went back and looked, which most people don't."
"7735110","7738490"," They say they do, what they really do is they just reach shit on foot, fin to it."
"7738850","7743370"," They don't actually go back and look for themselves because they don't want to see the truth. "
"7744350","7745290"," Uh, Nederhofer did."
"7745490","7748430"," He'd see, I'll, I'll try to find the tweets and retweet them on, uh, fin to it."
"7748950","7752970"," And Nederhofer was like, shit, they might be pulling, they might be pulling that shit that they"
"7752970","7756430"," pulled back then where, um, the market actually goes sideways and up. "
"7757250","7758390"," Now they're viable bottoms."
"7759070","7763190"," Uh, you sell the tops, you go back and buy a bottom, you sell the top, it just grind sideways"
"7763190","7763750"," and up."
"7764590","7768030"," Uh, and then the, and then the moment that they do cut rates, we fucking bloodbath. "
"7768790","7769910"," We fucking bloodbath."
"7771110","7774830"," And you can see examples of the, uh, yield-covered version in those time periods."
"7775250","7778890"," You can see the, the examples of inflation being high and then coming down. "
"7779510","7781210"," Uh, you can see the unemployment rate."
"7781530","7785110"," And this is the really neat too, as they- It's 11.30 AM Eastern time."
"7785350","7790690"," The U.S sells 48 billion dollars in three month bills, private cover of two to 69 and a prior"
"7790690","7792770"," high yield of four spot, five nine percent. "
"7793370","7798750"," The U.S sells 60 billion dollars in six month bills, private cover of two to 63 and a prior"
"7798750","7801290"," high yield of four spot, seven, five, five percent."
"7801850","7808690"," And you hear this, the crazy part too is you hear, um, uh, Jerome sometimes say, we're focused on"
"7808690","7811430"," maximum employment, we're focused on maximum employment."
"7812170","7814310"," Uh, and Barry's making the, all these points. "
"7814490","7817770"," I mean, if he, if they're focused on maximum employment, that's real and not fake."
"7818270","7823370"," If they're not lying to you in the background and really trying to destroy employment or max"
"7823370","7829790"," employment, then that's where back in the 50s, 60s and early 70s, that's, that's where we're at."
"7830570","7837590"," Uh, can you imagine if, if they start to use rates to keep unemployment high, uh, we would trade"
"7837590","7837950"," sideways. "
"7838690","7839410"," That's what would happen."
"7839650","7840390"," You'd trade sideways."
"7841110","7847610"," And if inflation started coming down, uh, there's risk to, uh, not to the following of stock"
"7847610","7852010"," prices, but the actual increase in stock prices, right?"
"7852250","7858430"," If inflation comes down, right, you see inflation come down and you see people have money to spend,"
"7858690","7860630"," it would drive the price of stocks up. "
"7861130","7863790"," It would give people, uh, buying power."
"7864090","7867230"," Does that make sense to you if you're out there and you're, you're like out there in your real"
"7867230","7867490"," life?"
"7868170","7871730"," So if you start to see the price of stuff come down, think about this."
"7871930","7877390"," You have the price of stuff, like your stuff you're buying, renting, uh, your house you buy, that"
"7877390","7878330"," kind of stuff, or at least manageable. "
"7879510","7885610"," If wages caught up to, um, to what you're paying and the inflation starts to come down and they"
"7885610","7892090"," start to shift this policy back to like the 1950s and 60s, you could actually see, uh, people will"
"7892090","7893970"," be like, yeah, I want to go out there and buy some Apple stock."
"7895250","7898570"," Uh, and you know, it's bizarre, or it's not bizarre."
"7898870","7908710"," I think, I think most of us haven't 55 and younger. "
"7909670","7910970"," Uh, we've never lived in that."
"7911310","7912750"," We've never lived under that regime."
"7913710","7916350"," Uh, we don't have any experience with that in the United States. "
"7917370","7923490"," But there, there was a time when we had that, uh, regime where you would literally have like a fed"
"7923490","7928670"," trying to actually do maximum employment, which is kind of bizarre, right?"
"7929770","7937610"," Um, if that's the case, uh, and they're fighting inflation, uh, you would actually see the stock"
"7937610","7941690"," market get bought and you'd see modest gains in the stock market."
"7942210","7944770"," Uh, buyable bottoms in the stock market."
"7946210","7953090"," Kind of wow, you'd see natural, uh, crashes that aren't, that aren't destructive, right?"
"7953310","7956790"," You would see like, um, you would see a different behavior out of the stock market. "
"7957070","7958230"," I don't know that, that lasts."
"7959130","7961310"," Uh, I think people are too greedy for it to last."
"7961550","7966730"," I'm not a believer in this system personally, not, uh, not from do I want this or don't want this. "
"7967090","7969970"," I think that, uh, greed has overtaken our society."
"7970330","7972670"," Our society is a different society than it once was."
"7973190","7977130"," Uh, so I don't think this make, I don't think this is going to happen. "
"7977170","7977930"," Maybe it does though."
"7978030","7980330"," Maybe the, maybe billionaires do want this to happen."
"7980630","7981590"," Maybe I'm not seeing that. "
"7982330","7987970"," Um, but from my perspective, uh, our society is so greedy right now."
"7988030","7988970"," It's, it's, it's wild."
"7989710","7991990"," Um, the world has changed. "
"7992490","7998190"," So, um, from what, or not the world, but the United States has changed significantly."
"7999530","8001170"," Um, some for the worst, some for the better."
"8001690","8006470"," Um, you know, we don't want to be fucking, uh, cruel and ruthless. "
"8006470","8011230"," The people of some ways we were horrible back then, the people, uh, but our greed in this country"
"8011230","8012290"," has gone, is, is wild."
"8013490","8015690"," Uh, absolutely fuck wild right now."
"8015690","8021430"," Uh, some things have gotten much better, but some things have gotten real or real worse. "
"8023720","8028520"," Surely expecting the results of the bond bill auctions are lead with the three month bid to cover"
"8028520","8028760"," ratio."
"8029620","8035780"," Yeah, I guess not, I think my point, my point behind this is we're not talking about like wage, uh,"
"8035900","8042460"," upward spiral, uh, and then inflation spiral, sprying higher and talking about, um, I'm trying to"
"8042460","8048120"," say that you would see, you would see inflation continue to come down the, the attempt maybe by the"
"8048120","8052720"," Fed to bring inflation down, uh, and allow them to kind of like balance out a little bit."
"8053020","8057120"," If you have this balance of inflation wages, right, where they, where they kind of balance to the"
"8057120","8059360"," route, you would actually see the stock market get held up. "
"8059360","8063040"," You would see people say, well, I can afford my housing now and I can afford my milk and eggs"
"8063040","8064420"," and I can afford my gas."
"8064820","8066500"," It's not great, but it's not bad."
"8066760","8067580"," And I got a job. "
"8068400","8072660"," Uh, and if the Fed, I'm going to make money and not, and I can lay it off."
"8072660","8075480"," Well, I can probably have sport to start buying apple stock."
"8075480","8077500"," That doesn't make it mean up stock goes to the moon. "
"8077640","8080140"," It just means, uh, you have modest gains over the years."
"8080780","8086980"," There could be some fundamental, uh, reason for some kind of the US dollar hits a six week high"
"8086980","8091780"," versus the end last up 1% at 132 spot 75 yen."
"8092180","8097760"," If this is real, if this is real, I would love to see a very smart person try to investigate"
"8097760","8107560"," why it would, what would, what would that, that, um, can make"
"8107560","8111480"," or maintain their, their wealth through this kind of a system. "
"8111780","8112660"," Maybe that's possible."
"8113520","8120100"," Um, we know we had, uh, oligarchs, uh, from the, uh, industrial revolution that were still alive in"
"8120100","8125400"," the 40s and 50s that wanted something like this, uh, for control of empire empires, right?"
"8125540","8127300"," We had railroad barons, car barons."
"8127680","8132820"," Uh, we had, um, made companies that were broken up in that time period, right?"
"8133560","8136900"," Um, in the 1970s, we had, I think we had mob element was broken up. "
"8137080","8144360"," So, uh, it'd be a fascinating, uh, be a fascinating, uh, rabbit hole to go down and find out, uh,"
"8144440","8145520"," who benefits from this?"
"8145700","8146500"," I guess that's the key, right?"
"8146700","8147860"," Who benefits the most from this?"
"8155020","8166790"," Uh, we live in a society, uh, yeah."
"8167070","8170270"," Maximum employment and price stability, they're two duties, but they weren't doing that."
"8170390","8170870"," Where are they Carlos?"
"8171550","8174710"," Like they weren't doing, they haven't been from the 1970s. "
"8174930","8176510"," We, I've shown this chart, right?"
"8177130","8187130"," From somewhere in the 1970s, you saw the, uh, corporate debt, government debt, the debt, the,"
"8187190","8191590"," the curve on debt, um, just went vertical, right?"
"8192530","8194270"," Up until, and they're still doing it today."
"8194889","8196750"," So in the background, no, that's changed."
"8196870","8200250"," Like 2022, they were taking on more debt loans. "
"8200430","8205469"," Two to 60, two to 60, three month high yield, four spots, six, eight percent, four, eight spots,"
"8205889","8211950"," six, eight percent, six month bid to cover ratio, two to 54, two to 54, six month high yield, four"
"8211950","8217070"," spot, eight, four percent, four spot, eight, four percent, the U.S. sells 68 billion dollars in"
"8217070","8222629"," three month bills and awards 15 spot, eight, five percent of bids that high, the U.S. sells 54"
"8222629","8228690"," billion dollars in six month bills and awards 40 spot, four, four percent of bids that high."
"8229530","8232709"," There would feel more cheap credit and risk way higher run away inflation."
"8232870","8233950"," Yeah, I'm not disagreeing with that. "
"8234490","8235969"," I'm not disagreeing with that at all."
"8239299","8240719"," Uh, not, not, not at all."
"8240940","8244400"," No disagreeing with, um, inflation would be run away at this, at this moment. "
"8247070","8248629"," More cheap credit and risk."
"8249290","8251430"," I have an issue with, uh, the cheap credit."
"8251690","8253629"," I don't think that companies care about cheap credit. "
"8254270","8255290"," Give me one second here."
"8279010","8285290"," I used to believe in the, uh, cheap credit arguments and I don't anymore."
"8287090","8288250"," Uh, not at all. "
"8288549","8292530"," You saw new home buyers come in, uh, this past month, too, right?"
"8292830","8295370"," We had, uh, new home buyers out there that came into the market."
"8295370","8296330"," They don't care about the rates."
"8298610","8299930"," Uh, they're buying still. "
"8300350","8307510"," There's some other reasons for that too, but the, uh, uh, the cheap credit thing that went out the"
"8307510","8308530"," window in the 70s."
"8308730","8312389"," I think that was something that we used to, we used to believe."
"8312629","8313490"," We don't believe any longer. "
"8314410","8319330"," Uh, we've actually seen, uh, you know, even, even the GFC, right?"
"8319690","8321010"," People were just taking crazy credit."
"8321010","8323190"," They didn't care where rates were."
"8323770","8324549"," Companies don't care. "
"8325950","8331250"," I think even from a, I think if you look in a C suite of a major company, I think"
"8331250","8335750"," that they also, um, don't care."
"8335969","8341770"," I think that a company says, I think somewhere in the 1970s, I don't think the facts say that"
"8341770","8347270"," somewhere in the 1970s, companies were like, well, when money's cheap, money's cheap, when money's"
"8347270","8348629"," expensive, we're going to take it."
"8348709","8350170"," We're going to take any money they give us. "
"8350850","8353129"," Um, so I don't think that they care."
"8353570","8357790"," I think they're, I think their idea is, we'll take it when it, when it, when it's cheap and when"
"8357790","8360750"," it's expensive, and if we break some shit, we break some shit."
"8360930","8362629"," If we break the company, we'll start a different one. "
"8363190","8364709"," I think that, like, that's changed."
"8365990","8372360"," Um, cut rates that would, um, do more, do more, uh, risk way higher and run away inflation."
"8372940","8374219"," But I do agree with the work, run away inflation. "
"8374700","8376100"," That, that, all that other stuff I agree with."
"8376940","8381980"," Um, I think the play is to buy a call and a put for tomorrow, close and say about five"
"8381980","8382879"," dollars away from price."
"8383920","8386900"," Um, yeah, we'll talk, let's talk about, um, tomorrow as well. "
"8387880","8391920"," Imagine how much money's being sucked up, equities and put into one year yields are yielding almost"
"8391920","8392700"," five percent."
"8393160","8394760"," Uh, this is the cash argument too, right?"
"8395020","8395940"," Cash, cash is king."
"8396980","8397740"," Uh, gold. "
"8399940","8400940"," Uh, Tesla doesn't roll here."
"8401240","8402320"," I'm, uh, exiting the puts."
"8403240","8403880"," I'm still green. "
"8404840","8405660"," Uh, we'll talk about Tesla."
"8407680","8409490"," Uh, we'll talk about Tesla if you're a bear too."
"8410410","8410810"," Okay. "
"8411010","8411210"," Let me go."
"8412010","8413090"," The aliens are here."
"8413410","8414530"," Set us straight above us. "
"8415010","8415950"," Do you shoot them down?"
"8418020","8419120"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"8419280","8419640"," Uh, yeah."
"8419760","8422400"," Well, so Jimmy, I agree with that part of cheap money. "
"8422980","8423700"," How about this?"
"8424160","8426320"," I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll meet you halfway."
"8428180","8432200"," Cheap money for the pours, but not for corporations."
"8433060","8433900"," Cheap money for the pours. "
"8436030","8436610"," All right."
"8436850","8437070"," Here we go."
"8437470","8438130"," Oh, you want another reload?"
"8439050","8440570"," Uh, so we got to stop loss here, right?"
"8441070","8442110"," Stop limits right here. "
"8443310","8444970"," We're probably not done for the day."
"8445410","8447810"," We've got some, we've got some weakness here in the one minute."
"8448370","8450910"," Uh, but I'm looking for at least one more buy in here. "
"8451070","8452630"," This might even just be a liquidity break."
"8453350","8455210"," Uh, not necessarily bearish here at all."
"8456810","8458830"," Uh, so we'll watch this right now. "
"8459170","8459870"," We'll look at tomorrow."
"8459970","8461650"," We'll look at the economic calendar for the week."
"8464630","8465770"," Uh, yeah, I'll turn the clock down. "
"8466050","8468030"," The squat changes in volume every day."
"8469530","8471730"," Um, oil, baby."
"8473210","8474810"," I turned down the squat, by the way. "
"8478660","8479060"," All right."
"8479140","8479500"," Hold on here."
"8484910","8486330"," Well, let's talk about Tesla. "
"8486330","8487930"," We'll talk about a few things right here."
"8488910","8491670"," So mute this one."
"8493450","8494570"," We're going to talk about Tesla. "
"8496450","8497950"," We're going to make this really simple."
"8498490","8498790"," Okay."
"8499210","8502750"," If you're a Tesla bear, let me make this really fucking simple for you. "
"8504250","8506170"," I'll make this extremely simple for you."
"8506370","8506410"," Okay."
"8507270","8514660"," We're going to go to, uh, all right. "
"8523850","8531240"," Let's see if, um, okay."
"8531240","8533860"," That means really simple for you."
"8538370","8541190"," So you can see like this major selling, right?"
"8541470","8541710"," In Tesla. "
"8543070","8547410"," You see, you see this major selling in Tesla right here, right?"
"8547410","8547490"," Right."
"8549990","8552330"," And you see, then you see this like down here, right?"
"8554630","8558950"," Uh, I want you to see this because, do you see this yellow line right here?"
"8561610","8567110"," And you see how it was able to come up and price fall at higher, right?"
"8567750","8568890"," See this yellow line right here."
"8570010","8576810"," Um, unless you break that yellow line, Tesla at a minimum is likely two things here. "
"8578990","8589410"," Tesla is likely likely has a high probability of, uh, not"
"8589410","8591810"," being bearish until it breaks that yellow line."
"8593490","8601930"," So if you, if you want to like catch the big doom and gloom Tesla moved down, uh, there's like"
"8601930","8603350"," you're not, you're not a bank, right?"
"8603550","8605750"," You're not the guy that's pulling the trigger that we're selling Tesla."
"8606710","8608190"," So there's a couple things here. "
"8609790","8613590"," This yellow line is a major problem for bears right now on Tesla."
"8614910","8623230"," Um, this right here is a great bearish trade on Tesla."
"8625630","8628950"," But it's not until you get underneath it and reject it. "
"8629130","8629610"," That makes sense."
"8630170","8631830"," Until you get underneath it and reject it."
"8631970","8633370"," That's a great fucking Tesla trade. "
"8633710","8635150"," This is a good bearish trade right here."
"8636170","8638390"," Uh, but it's only a level to level, right?"
"8638570","8641010"," It's not really, it's not the big boys, right?"
"8641370","8642050"," Just a little bit."
"8642610","8644350"," We knew, we knew to have rejection here. "
"8645230","8648270"," Uh, we knew we might have some rejection down to the old line at some point."
"8649150","8649910"," Great trade in here."
"8651630","8657650"," Um, but the big trade for Tesla as a bear is underneath this yellow line right here. "
"8659070","8663870"," Uh, whether it's here, whether it's, whether it's price coming above and then getting underneath"
"8663870","8664130"," it."
"8665210","8672250"," Um, now if price can't get underneath it, if bulls are somehow able to pull out of their ass, uh,"
"8672630","8675710"," trade above this orange line and this blue line."
"8677510","8678910"," And hold it, right?"
"8681970","8684510"," Uh, they successfully retest it. "
"8685110","8686290"," The correction is over."
"8686550","8692440"," You're going to see, you're going to see some vicious rally."
"8693580","8697720"," Uh, so you need to see as a, as a bear flick a big, whoop, the big ride down, you"
"8697720","8698260"," need to see it. "
"8698420","8700500"," You need to see like the break of this line right here."
"8703430","8709790"," Doesn't matter if it's now, doesn't matter if it's above these other, this other shit up here."
"8710630","8711230"," Doesn't matter. "
"8711490","8714630"," So until you see that, it's tough to make that call."
"8714810","8719790"," So as a bear, uh, you can trade this level level though."
"8719870","8722150"," There's no, there's no reason why you can't take a bear straight in here. "
"8722870","8724750"," You know, I got respect for that."
"8725410","8730390"," Uh, I get respect for closing underneath this, this, uh, 193 75 for this trade down below."
"8730390","8731470"," I got respect for that too. "
"8731710","8734290"," But just know that you take your money and run, right?"
"8734770","8736570"," The big trade is underneath though, right there."
"8736870","8738170"," And you don't even need to enter here."
"8738350","8740890"," You don't need to, you could enter here, I guess, and put some stops above. "
"8741670","8745410"," Uh, we, but trust me, if we break down below here, you're going to get a retest."
"8745950","8747070"," They ain't just going down."
"8747150","8752450"," It's not going to be like, you're not going to get like, uh, this right here to 65 bucks. "
"8752890","8754510"," Just not, it's not how the market works."
"8755030","8759750"," You're going to get like, um, uh, you'll get, if it happens, you'll get a blood bath down, but"
"8759750","8760850"," it'll come right back up again."
"8762050","8769250"," That's where you actually get the correct and isn't over yet. "
"8770050","8774450"," Uh, the same thing holds true for, um, same thing holds true for like, uh, Facebook."
"8775730","8786610"," Um, I did have, I was trying to come up with the bear case over the weekend, and"
"8786610","8787990"," there is a possibility."
"8789790","8791990"," You know, and that same thing right here, right?"
"8792570","8794250"," You see that, see the screaming up right now. "
"8794910","8796790"," That same yellow line screaming up right now."
"8796890","8797730"," So you break through that."
"8798070","8799190"," Bears ain't got nothing. "
"8799850","8800750"," Maybe not nothing."
"8801550","8807090"," Uh, like they can, they can trade this down, but that the juice is underneath this yellow line"
"8807090","8807410"," right here."
"8807430","8808510"," That's where the juice is the bear. "
"8809670","8815790"," The juice is getting underneath these moving averages and, um, getting underneath these minute"
"8815790","8821190"," triggers, uh, all these big things down here and getting underneath and then taking that trade."
"8821190","8822710"," There is a possibility."
"8823470","8825250"," There is a small possibility. "
"8826750","8834110"," Uh, all the crash here, very tiny, but it is there."
"8835390","8845290"," Uh, the fascinating part would be, uh, if there's a bear case here, uh, there is"
"8845290","8845890"," a possibility."
"8846410","8850170"," I've seen this, I think mentioned, but I don't think it was got any traction. "
"8851690","8859070"," Um, I think that, um, there's, there's, there's a problem with this, with this thesis."
"8860310","8864010"," Um, there's a problem with this thesis."
"8864210","8868070"," The problem with the thesis is, oh, no, let me tell you the thesis. "
"8868950","8877870"," The thesis would be, um, the thesis would be, US and China diplomats way first meeting since the"
"8877870","8878350"," balloon drama."
"8881590","8883850"," This dream is sponsored by To The Tick."
"8884250","8890670"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at ToTheTick.com."
"8891370","8900310"," So the thesis here would be that, um, the market could crack, not the market, but spy, let's say,"
"8900370","8909530"," could crash as we tagged, uh, PT one at this point, 4.12.06. Uh, the thesis here would be"
"8909530","8913690"," that you would crash the, oh my god, look at those green balls, baby. "
"8913910","8914870"," Come on up."
"8916070","8917430"," PT one has been tagged."
"8918610","8927090"," 4.12.11. Uh, we, we nailed 4.12.13. Now we're now trading 4.12.16. Uh, still bullish"
"8927090","8927350"," here. "
"8927810","8929390"," Uh, not bearish in any ways to perform."
"8930490","8933090"," Uh, though we did see a break below the one minute."
"8933250","8935150"," So we know that we are getting long in the tooth. "
"8935410","8936490"," I do want you to be aware of that."
"8937410","8943530"," Uh, we talked about, uh, tagging Pete, uh, price target to above or a failure to, uh, getting a"
"8943530","8947430"," little bit of long down here to taking a little bit longer than expected, tagged it."
"8947850","8953790"," Uh, then you're going to want to see this, uh, tag for PT to above for a failure, uh, tag"
"8953790","8954590"," PT to above. "
"8958090","8959550"," So we'll delete this one now."

"9154540","9157560"," We're going to have a crash by February 16th, right?"
"9158200","9159080"," That's I remember. "
"9160240","9163540"," What's that price crash from the price crash before 2430?"
"9163920","9164640"," Is that the crash?"
"9165800","9166300"," Like, what is it?"
"9166660","9167080"," Come on, man."
"9168060","9169420"," Yeah, you guys know what's up."
"9178370","9180030"," We're heads to the tits right now. "
"9180130","9181130"," Trust me, we ain't going down."
"9182070","9183710"," We're heads to the tits right now."
"9185310","9190630"," If I can it said, if I can it said, if I can it said, if I can it said,"
"9190630","9199530"," I if I can it said, I bought, I lended liquidity to the stock market and I sold puts at"
"9199530","9201630"," four zero or four zero six zero. "
"9203410","9207850"," I would say shit, we could definitely get down there or not four zero three zero six zero."
"9208030","9211850"," I'd say we can get down there, but I would say we're not going any lower than three zero six"
"9211850","9214070"," zero because he lent liquidity to the market."
"9215010","9221910"," So he's he's selling puts to bears, right, or to market participants, where he's doing he's either"
"9221910","9230130"," doing what Orvide said, they had said, ah, Carl Eichen lent liquidity to the market by buying spy"
"9230130","9235050"," and selling calls at four twenty four two zero zero. "
"9235050","9236050"," So a bunch of calls there."
"9236450","9246000"," I would bet that we aren't going bought a"
"9246000","9249900"," bunch of puts at four zero five zero on SPX."
"9249900","9257860"," That means that man owns this market and that man is protecting his ass because puts are cheap dirt"
"9257860","9258720"," cheap right now. "
"9267180","9269900"," I know, I know, but I know, but I heard Ben Twitt."
"9273010","9280310"," I saw Ben Twitt, Ben Twitt said, Jim is fucking boat bearish, Jim's calling for a market crash."
"9281090","9284330"," And that's because Carl Eichen bought puts and I'm like, this is bullshit. "
"9284890","9286670"," Because he said this isn't ahead, right?"
"9286990","9287630"," That's what I was told."

"9294050","9294430"," I was wrong. "
"9294970","9295210"," Allegedly."
"9295650","9298050"," Everything is allegedly that I just said the past half an hour."
"9298470","9298830"," Allegedly. "
"9305050","9305250"," Allegedly."
"9305430","9307950"," I know I got I got ripped on fin to it for saying that a state and that a week"
"9307950","9308570"," or two ago."
"9312530","9312890"," Allegedly. "
"9313250","9317310"," You guys understand that I can and Ackman lend liquidity to the market, right?"
"9317430","9317990"," You guys know that?"
"9318350","9319830"," There are billionaires out there."
"9321070","9330810"," When there's not enough liquidity, the market market makers and the end are the the kind of"
"9330810","9332330"," mind block right now of a word."
"9333430","9334470"," They'll ask for money. "
"9334630","9335570"," They can get some money here."
"9335850","9338970"," And I need to I need to sell these fucking people."
"9339390","9339890"," I need to sell these. "
"9340010","9341010"," I need to cancel the word."
"9341270","9342670"," I need to sell these bulls some calls."
"9344650","9347590"," And so like a guy like Eichmann or Eichmann will step in. "
"9347690","9348850"," They sometimes fight with each other."
"9349470","9352970"," Matter of fact, you saw it in 2021 or something."
"9353890","9360330"," That's why I was pissed off at what the fuck's the name of that company from Japan?"
"9362450","9368370"," I forget who they were, but there's a guy in Japan and he was entering the US market and acting"
"9368370","9371030"," like a like an Ackman or a or an icon. "
"9371430","9373270"," And he was actually moving our market."
"9375070","9378510"," He's messing with the our banks, which you don't want to see, right?"
"9379290","9381570"," Pushing the market around with options."
"9383210","9384630"," Yeah, a soft bank, man. "
"9384910","9385570"," Soft bank, dude."
"9385670","9386850"," You guys remember when that was going on?"
"9387470","9388730"," That was wild, right?"
"9389090","9389590"," You don't want it."
"9389890","9391050"," I got soft bank doing that shit. "
"9391070","9394530"," It's like an icon or a or an Ackman doing that shit."
"9394950","9398710"," And we, you know, we're like, Hey, hey, hey, with star market star playground."
"9399230","9399810"," Don't mess with it. "
"9400670","9403250"," You can come into it, but you can't go pushing it around."
"9403590","9406710"," And sometimes you'll see Ackman and an icon fight with each other too."
"9407110","9409310"," Those two guys would love to knock each other off. "
"9410750","9411790"," Yeah, a soft bank."
"9412130","9412890"," That's who it was."
"9420510","9422070"," That's he broke the PT one. "
"9422210","9422590"," No problem."
"9423350","9425530"," We're going to look for another buy down below in the one minute."
"9426290","9429050"," We are seeing a little bit of this isn't really weakness. "
"9429530","9431890"," It's start to take profit more than weakness."
"9433890","9436410"," We did get a new high on this one minute test."
"9436410","9438890"," We did have a liquid liquidation breakdown below. "
"9439070","9440010"," I'm still bullish here."
"9440870","9444830"," If you're not, you can change your buy."
"9445130","9452330"," You can, if not you, me, if I'm if I'm going to be bullish, but not as bullish, you can"
"9452330","9454830"," change, I can change it by two, four, eleven, oh, nine. "
"9456230","9458230"," I can put some risk on right at the one minute."
"9458310","9458890"," Doesn't matter."
"9462890","9464990"," Now where you decide to put it, but you can see it. "
"9465090","9469930"," You can see this, you can see this one minute, climbing, climbing, climbing, and starts to take"
"9469930","9471690"," this little bit of a dip, right?"
"9472490","9474550"," A little bit of a momentum dropping at this point."
"9475070","9478470"," Still have the PT above at four, thirteen, oh, four."
"9479070","9480370"," You can always add below. "
"9480590","9485990"," You can buy here and add below at the five minute or just wait down here at four, eleven and"
"9485990","9491270"," say come to daddy so that I can tag that four, thirteen above, but I'm not bearish at this point."
"9492070","9492750"," Not full bear."
"9492850","9497270"," I don't get bears here until we break and hold below the five minute. "
"9497430","9498470"," I'm going to show that to you right here."
"9499770","9504070"," I want to see, I want to see a price break."
"9505150","9509290"," I want to see a price break of the five minute. "
"9509330","9514030"," You just turn positive on the deck lining by more than one dollar a barrel here in the stash down"
"9514030","9514230"," here."
"9514370","9515970"," That's where I want to take a put right in there."
"9517190","9518990"," And that this is where I get bearish. "
"9519090","9521590"," Even if you're not taking puts, that's where I get bears right there."
"9523050","9526210"," Otherwise, it could just be a slow slog higher at this point."
"9526850","9531490"," We could look for more more strength down below to push up to that four, thirteen, oh, four PT. "
"9532350","9534010"," That is the price target above."
"9542860","9544180"," Oh, so he deleted his tweet."
"9544340","9545620"," Okay, so we're all bullish now, right?"
"9545740","9547280"," We've forgotten all that shit that we said. "
"9547820","9549360"," So career low is updating us."
"9549440","9550960"," Thank you career low for saying something."
"9551460","9554880"," Since we've rejected off that concerning level, he has deleted the retweet. "
"9556020","9556460"," Nice."
"9560020","9562000"," Yeah, no, I get it."
"9562540","9563020"," I get it. "
"9563220","9564220"," I've been blocked by him."
"9564240","9565520"," I've got black by him two years ago."
"9566060","9569540"," We used to like have, we used to pretty much be in line with stuff. "
"9570600","9576320"," But just like another company I'm not going to talk about, they usually get some of these things"
"9576320","9576640"," wrong."
"9577020","9580960"," And the most critical times, they usually get the turns wrong."
"9582160","9584340"," And I've gotten burned too many times for that. "
"9584620","9586320"," I've been torched because of that shit."
"9593590","9599910"," Yo, you've got a you've probably got not quite an automatic short here, but it's somewhere up in"
"9599910","9600030"," here."
"9600090","9601450"," This is a return to the scene of the crime. "
"9603550","9611480"," I'm not going to stay at the company, but you guys know the company."
"9611600","9612200"," I used to get burned."
"9612420","9619280"," I used to never catch the turns and I'd be like fucking damn it. "
"9621240","9622180"," God damn it."
"9626550","9628210"," I used to get all upset about it."
"9628410","9629530"," I'd be so angry. "
"9629750","9631430"," I'd be like, why don't they catch that turn there?"
"9633030","9641010"," So it doesn't much better without you guys know who it is."
"9642510","9648450"," Another problem we have here too is so we have a tampering of volatility with the hedge buying"
"9648450","9649050"," above here."
"9649670","9652330"," We have the signs of a market that's not going to crash. "
"9657670","9670310"," Yo, you"
"9676430","9682990"," guys need to do is what you guys need to do is you guys need to be seeing like you"
"9682990","9684870"," guys need to be seeing momentum roll at the market."
"9685070","9688850"," There are indicators that the banks are exiting as they point."
"9689170","9694110"," There are indicators that banks are exiting, hedge funds are exiting before the event even happens. "
"9694950","9697230"," Those fucking guys never get caught in a crash."
"9698070","9699310"," You can actually see it."
"9700030","9701630"," You can actually see when they're out of here. "
"9702850","9703990"," It's kind of wild, right?"
"9705350","9706250"," Price stays high."
"9706570","9708650"," They're out and price is staying high."
"9715470","9716970"," You can actually Oh, here we go. "
"9717990","9720130"," Let's take a look at UNG real quick."
"9724210","9725330"," Thanks for the heads up."
"9727050","9728590"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"9728930","9730230"," UNG is in buy mode."
"9731390","9734210"," Let's take a look around the market real quick."
"9735430","9738510"," We might have some other places that we can make some money. "
"9739430","9741070"," Not you guys, me."
"9743290","9750870"," I got half the switch to a half the switch to the mode of look at UNG, baby."
"9752450","9753990"," Look at UNG. "
"9756170","9758530"," UNG trading above its triggers currently."
"9759150","9763970"," UNG just got above its hourly and it's one in five minutes."
"9765090","9768950"," Let's see if we can find a place to crank this to. "
"9769310","9770270"," Oh, yeah."
"9773050","9774330"," Oh, yeah."
"9776150","9778010"," Ten bucks on UNG. "
"9780110","9781830"," And it's come down a little bit."
"9782130","9782670"," Hold on here."
"9782970","9785910"," It's time passes right there. "
"9787390","9789310"," $10.10.40 still on track."
"9789530","9790810"," UNG cranking right now."
"9794810","9801730"," If you get a retest and may possibly get a brie buy back in on 851 on UNG, we'll look"
"9801730","9801910"," at. "
"9802090","9803210"," Let's look around the market real quick."
"9806820","9810300"," Oh, are we getting squeezy on BBY2?"
"9811780","9813440"," Keep your keep your eyes on."
"9814880","9819860"," Keep your eyes on BBY here. "
"9823600","9828640"," If we can get a retest and hold right here and BBY price target above."
"9833070","9835070"," We got some work going on here."
"9835310","9836330"," Now, here's a key point. "
"9836710","9839250"," BBY has to hold 2005."
"9840790","9841470"," Hold it."
"9841470","9848030"," And the one minute on your regular charts here and your price target above would be right here. "
"9848150","9852650"," $2.40. Anything else above?"
"9852910","9854050"," Oh, we got another one above too."
"9854270","9858150"," We've got a right here."
"9858830","9864070"," $3.01. We've got a little bit of, let's look at. "
"9866310","9866930"," Oh, yeah."
"9867130","9867450"," Look at that."
"9867730","9869310"," I wasn't even checking these. "
"9869830","9875270"," We can see a bottling, a buy of a bottom down here on BBY2."
"9875850","9878370"," We could get a squeeze coming up on BBY."
"9878990","9880450"," We'll look at some others. "
"9881290","9881770"," Look at AMC."
"9884470","9886170"," And kind of the same thing happened at AMC."
"9886630","9888410"," Not quite there yet on AMC. "
"9889650","9890290"," Not quite."
"9890910","9896110"," You want to see price probably above $4.73 or so."
"9897330","9899030"," AMC has some work to do. "
"9901730","9908350"," And they would have a first price target on AMC above at $5.08. It's probably $5."
"9908730","9911210"," It's about a flat $5 right there."
"9912410","9914370"," Oh, and then we're going to know what above on AMC too. "
"9915410","9918830"," Now, of course, you'd have to hold $5 and consolidate."
"9919230","9920030"," You can't be doing it."
"9920050","9921310"," You'd have to put stops up here. "
"9922210","9924110"," I shouldn't have to explain that to you guys."
"9924810","9926530"," So we want to see price come up here."
"9927140","9929510"," If that happens, you'd have a price target here, $5. "
"9930130","9935110"," You want to see it hold, not squeeze up here, come back down and break through."
"9936090","9942030"," And then you could possibly take out $5.40 above on AMC."
"9942750","9944750"," We'll look at, do we do GME yet?"
"9946890","9948450"," Oh, GME's already squeezing. "
"9948750","9949930"," You lucky dogs out there."
"9951830","9953070"," You lucky dogs."
"9954410","9956230"," Time to take the money on GME. "
"9958150","9960770"," I'll probably start firing off rapid fire, right?"
"9961110","9968310"," You want to get above $19.83. And then you'd have a price target above of $20.80. Good eyes."
"9969350","9970070"," Look at that."
"9970370","9971150"," And it has to hold. "
"9971230","9972810"," It has to hold currently."
"9973850","9983740"," GME must hold $19.52. Definitely stops below"
"9983740","9985780"," $19.37 right here."
"9990020","9993240"," Jamie's a little kind of missing the boat on this one. "
"9993460","9995460"," Not fully missed the boat, but kind of."
"9996820","9997960"," So there's your GME."
"9997960","10000300"," You can always pause the broadcast and come back and look at it. "
"10002600","10003900"," So there's GME."
"10006120","10008400"," Here is UNG."
"10010300","10019380"," You want to see UNG hold right there. "
"10019980","10021860"," And we'll make the fill yellow."
"10026640","10036510"," You do not want to break below 8.45, 8.47 stops below"
"10042810","10043710"," right there."
"10044150","10045770"," And then targets your me in the same. "
"10047850","10050970"," This is for a different one here for another trade."
"10051250","10055130"," So this one is by above stops below."
"10055990","10057870"," PT appears but hasn't been changed. "
"10058630","10062930"," This first PT is going back to a previous tell point."
"10063130","10063830"," This one came down."
"10064630","10065950"," Can you be a buyer again above here?"
"10068710","10069270"," UNG. "
"10069270","10074940"," Take this a little more right there."
"10081670","10083990"," And then you can see prices come down a little bit."
"10085070","10093570"," You want this retest right here to hold 8.51. And then down here it's 8.46, 8.44"
"10093570","10097270"," right in here. "
"10097930","10098970"," It's right there."
"10100990","10107960"," Yeah, bullish bullish on UNG."
"10111220","10112520"," Foolish on UNG. "
"10113200","10114900"," Still bullish on spy."
"10117400","10120700"," Still have that PT above to knock out for 1304."
"10126520","10127600"," Let me see. "
"10128720","10130120"," Back up for you."
"10132320","10134620"," It's by interaction with one minute."
"10134820","10135060"," It got it. "
"10135080","10135740"," It got it ties."
"10136000","10138520"," Spy got it tie on this retest of the one minute."
"10138760","10144780"," You're going to expect it to continue to try to make a tie up here at 4304. "
"10144780","10149580"," If you can add to a position, we'll just keep following this five minute all the way up."
"10168370","10169390"," I love Jim."
"10169770","10170350"," Don't get me wrong. "
"10170490","10171010"," I love him."
"10171250","10172290"," I don't dislike Jim."
"10173030","10176330"," I have like no personal vendetta against him or anything. "
"10177110","10179950"," I just, you know, he says something and it's like gospel."
"10180410","10181310"," And that's my only thing."
"10183610","10185650"," I don't have any dislikes for the man. "
"10186030","10187970"," I have a lot of respect for him for everything he's done."
"10195490","10196770"," Hey Dan, how you doing brother?"
"10203670","10204970"," I just saw your text Dan."
"10215430","10216310"," Let's talk about tomorrow. "
"10217190","10218530"," Let's talk about the rest of the week real quick."
"10218750","10220210"," So let's talk about economic calendar."
"10221750","10225290"," I'll talk to you guys in the background about the economic calendar, what to expect this week. "
"10227150","10228670"," And what we're looking for."
"10228950","10230310"," Okay, and we're going to give you an outlook."
"10230530","10232530"," It's a 12.05 in the afternoon. "
"10232710","10234310"," We'll give you guys an outlook for the entire week here."
"10235290","10238190"," We'll talk about the expected move."
"10239510","10249810"," I'm going to keep on the, what do you guys watch UNG, BBY, MC,"
"10250250","10250930"," GME. "
"10253910","10256030"," Let me know what I'll keep it on a screen or in the back."
"10258550","10260990"," And I'm going to do a quick brief for you for the week."
"10266830","10268810"," So you're going to watch Tesla for you in the background. "
"10268990","10269470"," I can do that."
"10269990","10271250"," Whatever you guys want me to do."
"10272290","10274670"," I've got, I've got spy on already on a screener. "
"10274930","10279330"," So you guys, if I see anything that's ugly and spot, trust me, if I see anything ugly and spy,"
"10279550","10279970"," I'm going to tell you."
"10281050","10282910"," I see anything it's like concerning."
"10283430","10284770"," I'll be like, get out of there. "
"10287820","10289120"," Anything concerning, I'll let you know."
"10290280","10294260"," Any kind of negativity in the market, anything that's like, oh, shake it out, get out of the"
"10294260","10294720"," market, whatever."
"10295340","10296160"," I'll say something. "
"10296900","10301320"," So I'm going to go over, I'm going to go over what to expect the rest of the week here."
"10313570","10319260"," Okay, I'll leave this up here."
"10319360","10320600"," We still have our price target above. "
"10321080","10322800"," Nothing has changed this, right?"
"10323540","10325540"," Nothing has changed this thesis at this point."
"10326260","10327500"," Right from the open this morning, right?"
"10327620","10329460"," If you were here with me at 930, I told you we're going up."
"10333200","10334500"," Well, there we go, we're going up. "
"10336990","10340430"," So we're going to look at spy for the week."
"10344700","10345060"," Okay."
"10347160","10352080"," You know, if you guys are losing money on a zero date, you can always do spreads, right?"
"10352420","10353300"," You guys know that too. "
"10354400","10358040"," You can do in the money spreads that expire today, tomorrow, Wednesday, whatever you want."
"10359160","10362020"," As long as you hit the price target above, you're going to get paid."
"10363180","10364660"," You guys can do the underlying. "
"10364760","10366120"," You guys can do SPX."
"10367060","10368760"," You guys can do contracts and ES."
"10369040","10369480"," Doesn't matter. "
"10373280","10382860"," So we're going to look at, hold on here, see if I can"
"10382860","10391230"," log in and then get in here."
"10398530","10400010"," Still trading higher right now."
"10401110","10405140"," Let me see here. "
"10410990","10411430"," Okay."
"10414680","10423800"," So Jimmy Beary earlier said, I recommend a strangle later in excuse me."
"10426720","10430200"," Jimmy Beary said, I recommend a strangle later in the week. "
"10431040","10435400"," And you might say yourself, why does he recommend a strangle?"
"10436060","10437620"," And I'm going to tell you why he's recommending it."
"10440380","10448020"," So we're going to look at the implied move coming up on the spy."
"10449640","10454580"," So you can see this first, you can see right here, this is the 213 expiry. "
"10454880","10459780"," The implied move is 413 71 410 64, right?"
"10460380","10461820"," Today is the 13th, right?"
"10462020","10463860"," 413 71, excuse me."
"10464900","10466900"," So we have 413 71."
"10468580","10469740"," And where is that?"
"10470600","10471900"," That's right up in here. "
"10472280","10476020"," Let's look up on just today."
"10478480","10483400"," The implied move, this is where the options, what the options market is pricing in for today."
"10484240","10488480"," We've got 413 71, right?"
"10490020","10490500"," We're right here. "
"10495770","10499610"," That doesn't mean we can't trade higher than right here, but this is what the options market is,"
"10499730","10501850"," is, is gut price standard, okay?"
"10503190","10512250"," On the downside, the market options market has priced in for today, 410 57, right?"
"10512510","10516790"," Which is we're going to here for 1057."
"10527650","10528350"," This is right here."
"10528430","10528750"," You see that?"
"10530530","10531610"," Do I get that right there?"
"10531730","10533170"," Let's make sure you get the right 410 60. "
"10538930","10539570"," Right here."
"10543870","10544230"," See it?"
"10545910","10548670"," Implied move, right that in here for you."
"10548970","10556130"," Implied move, right there. "
"10557950","10558870"," Can I copy this?"
"10560790","10561190"," Nope."
"10562470","10563070"," Probably not."
"10563210","10563790"," I don't know if I can. "
"10565470","10565870"," Nope."
"10566210","10566810"," We'll do it again."
"10570770","10571370"," Implied move. "
"10576020","10578700"," We'll visualize this for you right there."
"10578800","10580740"," Implied move, okay?"
"10582620","10583380"," That's for today."
"10584700","10585960"," We're going to go to a five day chart. "
"10587960","10591320"," You can see that implied move in here for today."
"10593960","10598300"," We'll look at a one month chart and look at a few things here."
"10599540","10601680"," You know we've got some balance down below here, right?"
"10602160","10604460"," We know we've got some balance right here. "
"10605580","10607100"," We're backing this upper balance again."
"10609580","10612660"," We didn't sell down into this balance, right?"
"10612820","10613840"," The buyers are still here."
"10613940","10615460"," We know that the buyers are still here. "
"10615520","10617540"," We pushed it up, right?"
"10618280","10622480"," And we retested to see if the buyers were still there, and we found out that yes, they are still"
"10622480","10622920"," here, right?"
"10623420","10624360"," We know the buyers are there."
"10624420","10627400"," We know the buyers haven't left, right?"
"10629490","10632250"," We know the buyers are still down below here at S1 at this pivot."
"10633570","10635010"," So back to a five day chart. "
"10644990","10651910"," You know this is our implied move above, and we have some range expansion coming."
"10658030","10667950"," And for our next expiry, we've got a range expansion of this"
"10667950","10672470"," is for, let's get this dates right here, where you see you can see it."
"10675650","10683490"," For the 14th, we've got 41839, 40572, for the 15th, we've got"
"10683490","10695150"," 41971, 16th, 41971, 17th, 42024,"
"10695150","10696770"," 40383, right?"
"10707410","10710230"," Well, I'm sorry, my cursor is all over the place. "
"10710670","10713890"," So we know we've got 42015, 40374."
"10719480","10725180"," So right in here, we're going to take a look at an implied move."
"10725940","10729240"," Now we can trade out just if you're out there and you're watching this. "
"10732560","10738780"," I want you to know that we can easily trade outside of our implied move."
"10739760","10741960"," We do it all the time, not all the time, but we do it."
"10744920","10749960"," And then down below, this is the rest of our implied move the rest of the week, right down here. "
"10751080","10755800"," If we get bad news, now we can trade outside of this."
"10757600","10758620"," But I want you to see this."
"10758740","10767540"," Let's look it back at that one month view, and just take a look at what it's implying, right?"
"10769480","10774280"," You can see that our ballots are at true price ranges for 1838. "
"10775260","10779040"," You know that good news will put us up here, right?"
"10779320","10782200"," To wait to see if we're taking a new level out or not, right?"
"10783000","10784500"," This would be a next leg up for us."
"10784600","10785480"," We've spent time here."
"10785640","10790680"," We're in a bull flag right here, trading up here, trying to get up here. "
"10791780","10797380"," And you know we've got some some vicious economic news that they can sell us down on, and that"
"10797380","10799440"," would give us our low flu week, right?"
"10799760","10802540"," We get some bad news on Wednesday, Thursday, something like that."
"10803300","10804480"," What does that mean though?"
"10805080","10809580"," Now that means that the bull case is still valid, right?"
"10810540","10812560"," Trade that 402, bull case still valid."
"10813100","10818320"," You also can see that we know that where the bull case becomes invalid, right?"
"10818560","10819240"," It's right down here. "
"10820760","10828420"," If we start to trade outside of our anticipated range, this is what the bears want, right?"
"10828580","10834320"," They want to trade below this 396 zone over here, right?"
"10834880","10836560"," So Jim Perry was like, you should get yourself a"
"10836560","10846420"," strangle or a puts our"
"10846420","10849980"," teeth, and you want puts to print on velocity, right?"
"10850280","10857500"," A fast move down, and you really want to see that move down underneath here to get a good print."
"10858280","10862060"," So you could possibly take a strangle for Friday."
"10863360","10870840"," Maybe you make it like a 402, pull a little bit of risk on, or even 405, right, for that"
"10870840","10872020"," bloodbath to happen. "
"10873080","10876900"," And then you take some kind of a, I wouldn't put a call side on, if you're going to build"
"10876900","10881000"," something like that, I'd probably say wait for some volatility."
"10881640","10887320"," So up here, my point to you up here is you could take some cheap puts to protect yourself as"
"10887320","10889400"," we trade up here today, right?"
"10890300","10891240"," Take some cheap puts."
"10892320","10897800"," And then at any point, if we get some volatility, or some anticipation of volatility, we trade down"
"10897800","10900920"," here, we're looking to throw some calls on that side of that strangle. "
"10901660","10907960"," So you've got your call side, your put side bot, and your call side bot to capture both ends of"
"10907960","10910540"," this into Friday."
"10911780","10918500"," So my point here is for the next five days or so, probably throw your put side on to a"
"10918500","10923180"," strangle one day, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday."
"10926560","10933220"," And what else is cool about this too, is if you look at, let me see if I can change"
"10933220","10934100"," this here. "
"10943500","10953380"," What else is cool about this is, you start to see the, you start to see the"
"10953380","10956520"," gap widen, see this gap widen here."
"10957460","10960900"," This time passes, see 424 is a month out, right?"
"10961980","10964660"," And we're now at 426 and 398."
"10965540","10969300"," If you're a very, or a bull, you want to be buying these dips down below 400, 398. "
"10970140","10973600"," If you see how this is working itself out, we're putting space."
"10974920","10976360"," C402, why don't you guys see this?"
"10976460","10977800"," 396, I was telling you about."
"10978320","10982460"," Now I was like, here's 400, and here's 398, right?"
"10982840","10990300"," See how we're not breaking below that 396, 397 in the implied move means the options market is, is"
"10990300","10995880"," pricing in less volatility, a move higher, and not breaking below. "
"10997560","11000480"," Why don't you guys look at this one more time, look at this more time before me, okay?"
"11001280","11003920"," Let's look at the help with how the options market is positioned."
"11005060","11007860"," This is what the market is positioned before, right?"
"11008780","11011540"," So for 398 a month from now, being your low."
"11012480","11013520"," So what is that telling you?"
"11014240","11017200"," It doesn't tell you, it doesn't tell you, yes, guaranteed what's going to happen. "
"11018280","11027050"," But what does it tell you is, it's telling you that, telling you that it's telling you to expect,"
"11027470","11029250"," not that it's going to happen, but expect."
"11034030","11035290"," I want you to see this here."
"11039250","11040410"," You see this right here?"
"11043910","11045470"," Maybe there's a better way to look at this. "
"11046470","11049870"," It's telling you to expect to get right here."
"11052670","11058650"," It's telling you to expect price to go higher, right?"
"11058930","11065910"," And this yellow line to back off a little bit, this orange line, this blue line to back off a"
"11065910","11068930"," little bit, and to get some separation in less volatility."
"11069770","11071370"," And that's to start trading like this. "
"11071970","11072510"," Does that make sense?"
"11074450","11076230"," And do you know what this is right here?"
"11076990","11078290"," You guys want to know what this is?"
"11078390","11079490"," I'll tell you what it is going to know."
"11081030","11085810"," If you go back in time, remember this, yellow orange blue, right?"
"11103430","11106210"," Yellow orange blue, right?"
"11108050","11109250"," Yellow orange blue, right?"
"11109370","11111570"," Yellow orange blue, right?"
"11111650","11116670"," Yellow orange blue, right?"
"11116670","11117950"," Start to give space."
"11120630","11123170"," Less volatility, less volatility. "
"11123670","11125030"," We still get out, we still trade down."
"11125690","11132830"," Still blows, but less volatility, less volatility, less volatility."
"11133970","11136110"," So if you're a bear, you want to get underneath this, right?"
"11136690","11138410"," Get underneath this blue line down here, right?"
"11139550","11141810"," And the option is not price for that to happen. "
"11142350","11145010"," The banks are lying to you if you're a bear."
"11146190","11153330"," The banks are trying to set up the yellow orange and the blue."
"11154130","11160130"," Trying to take the yellow, the orange, and the blue, and move them over. "
"11162330","11174330"," Create some space in here."
"11175690","11183350"," And they're trying to make price to start to do this kind of nonsense right here."
"11187080","11188180"," This time goes on. "
"11188640","11189200"," Does that make sense?"
"11190580","11192480"," This is what they're pricing in right now."
"11193640","11195500"," So if you're a bear and you're like, I got that."
"11195680","11197840"," I got the itch that the stock market started. "
"11198660","11200220"," You got to get underneath here, man."
"11201080","11201880"," You got to reject."
"11202180","11206140"," And you got to get price velocity to get a ripper down, right?"
"11206280","11209680"," A fast rejection up, right?"
"11212470","11213790"," You have to have to get. "
"11214210","11217090"," It's not just the trade down because I'll say what that looks like."
"11217490","11219050"," That looks like no volatility."
"11219290","11222250"," It looks like normal C in the market. "
"11222250","11230630"," It starts to look like, starts to look like, um, I don't want to."
"11232050","11235470"," It starts to look like price to go higher."
"11236590","11240350"," You'll have a nice little dip or nice little high to sell. "
"11241110","11242090"," We'll start going higher, right?"
"11242250","11246190"," If you're a bear, you need to see like violent move down."
"11246930","11248550"," And you're like, oh, I missed it though, cap."
"11248830","11249090"," Don't worry. "
"11249250","11250410"," It's going to come straight back up."
"11250530","11252250"," And then you're going to take that violent move down there."
"11252770","11254010"," That's where you enter right there. "
"11256390","11258630"," But the option is not market's not priced in for it."
"11258790","11261430"," The option market is priced in for hedging."
"11263690","11265110"," Hedging down to 396. "
"11267610","11270630"," So if it is, well, not if it is, it is."
"11273310","11275550"," And you want to make some money as a bear."
"11278620","11282120"," And you're like, well, cap, I'm still still clap, fall in. "
"11282400","11282660"," Fuck it."
"11283480","11287720"," Buy yourself some anything that's like 396 or lower like a month out."
"11290180","11292500"," You can even do a month out, 398 or 400. "
"11293620","11297900"," Maybe even farther, I'd do two months out below 400 because right now they're telling you ain't"
"11297900","11298560"," going down there."
"11299520","11301720"," They're telling you that that's as far as we go."
"11302300","11308020"," So if we break below this, you have puts that are dated one to three months out below 396 on"
"11308020","11310320"," any bad news this week, you're going to print like a machine. "
"11311120","11313660"," It's going to be like, burr, you're going to see me dirt deep."
"11314260","11314340"," Goodbye."
"11316360","11318460"," Otherwise, you need to buy it in the money put. "
"11319340","11323740"," So if you're like, I'm going to do a strangle the market cap for expected volatility."
"11324080","11326700"," I'm going to do some expected volatility."
"11328980","11334420"," And I want to do a strangle, probably buy something that's in the money to trade within our"
"11334420","11336300"," expected range down in here. "
"11338980","11341160"," Now the call side is limited, right?"
"11341460","11344820"," We can or it looks like it's limited at this point, not down the road a month or two from"
"11344820","11345060"," now."
"11345840","11349260"," So you're probably done buying calls for this week, right?"
"11349560","11350700"," You're long right here."
"11351420","11354340"," You're going to look though for dips to buy if you're a bull. "
"11354900","11360520"," So if you see these dips down below, I would turn off social media in the news, to be honest"
"11360520","11360960"," with you."
"11361880","11366960"," Because you know, I was talking to Winky or Winky was talking to me about the year over year month"
"11366960","11370720"," over month, year over year, month over month."
"11372500","11373960"," Additions of inflation. "
"11374260","11380040"," It would be really cool to see like an inflation report come in."
"11382040","11385540"," That actually, this would be kind of funny, right?"
"11385700","11388860"," You get a CPI report that comes in."
"11389620","11391500"," And so it says Monday, right?"
"11391620","11393380"," We got CPI report that comes in tomorrow. "
"11394400","11397080"," So let's say you see a CPI report coming in tomorrow."
"11397280","11399260"," It's really bad news."
"11399520","11403160"," It's like inflation's still up year over year, even though inflation's coming down. "
"11403360","11405640"," You're wrong bulls, right?"
"11405940","11412080"," It would be classic for like bloodbath the market down here, right?"
"11412800","11415240"," And they come out on like Wednesday or something."
"11415940","11419780"," And they go, oh, it wasn't as bad as we thought it was, right?"
"11419900","11423000"," This is where the news is made up at natural resistance."
"11423600","11425260"," It wasn't as bad as we thought it was. "
"11426560","11429100"," And then you see this get bought right back up, right?"
"11429500","11434220"," Or it's like, here's your bad your bad CPR report that the news comes out."
"11434300","11435200"," It wasn't so bad."
"11436380","11443280"," But we got to wait for, we have to wait for it to wait for sleep or claims on Thursday. "
"11443660","11445360"," So it's this kind of nonsense, right?"
"11446020","11448240"," And then claims are, oh, baby claims are so bad."
"11448400","11453180"," And the guy that buys that OTM hedge pays, but let's say claims aren't that bad, which we don't"
"11453180","11454100"," expect them to be, right?"
"11454900","11461200"," And we start racing back up again for a new new run a week from today, right?"
"11461380","11462820"," You get that new run a week from today."
"11464640","11466300"," So I wouldn't be shocked by that. "
"11466420","11467660"," This wouldn't shock me to see this."
"11469860","11472680"," The bear or the bulls only need one thing."
"11472920","11474280"," They just need to hold this down here. "
"11476280","11481640"," If you crash below here and come back up immediately, bull's still in charge."
"11482420","11485400"," It needs to be like plunged down below and hold and start selling."
"11487840","11489760"," Options markets not priced for it. "
"11489840","11493160"," I'm assuming they know more than we know at this point."
"11493660","11500020"," I'm assuming that Powell is saying, tame the markets, calm down."
"11500340","11500760"," We have some work. "
"11500920","11501740"," We have more work to do."
"11503140","11503960"," Here we go."
"11504200","11505380"," Still bullish on the market. "
"11505580","11509420"," Here goes PT2 above, just grinding higher now to it."
"11511020","11520140"," This is the time if you were going to be a bull today, you got your new high on your"
"11520140","11522060"," one minute right there for 1241."
"11524900","11527880"," You know, markets starting to get a little long in the tooth. "
"11528180","11530600"," Now we set it down here, a little long in the tooth over here, right?"
"11531340","11535300"," So this is going to be where people start to take profit off their new high right here."
"11536360","11540120"," They're going to leave this fight to the end of the day people."
"11540120","11543940"," Move the buy up again right here. "
"11551880","11553700"," It might even put the buy at this point."
"11553820","11555900"," This time of the day, it's 1228."
"11556140","11562720"," I'll probably put the buy down below and see if somewhere down in here starting to cool off a"
"11562720","11563000"," little bit. "
"11564900","11566920"," I do want my take on what happens this week."
"11567380","11573580"," What I think's going to happen is I don't think I don't really believe in the news anymore."
"11573920","11576520"," Like I believe in it when we're at support and resistance. "
"11578140","11582620"," But I think they use it as an excuse to get a better price on a high or a low"
"11582620","11583360"," to seller buy."
"11586370","11588610"," So what am I looking for?"
"11590250","11596570"," I'm probably looking for a target of that 4304 buying a day today."
"11598450","11602330"," I'd really like to see another dip to buy it on the low. "
"11602870","11607170"," I'd like to see a dip buy at I'll give it to you right now, 40312."
"11608050","11614330"," So I'll give you my next dip buy or the next place for a bull to buy in safety."
"11615230","11616870"," It's going to be 403. "
"11617530","11618830"," I'm going to show it to you right down here."
"11619430","11619870"," Hold on."
"11622770","11626950"," Where I want to be a buyer with Captain Jim wants to buy right here. "
"11627370","11631050"," The next five days I had a place that I could buy that I'd be happy to buy."
"11634270","11635830"," CJJ wants to buy right here."
"11638460","11640440"," The next four days, I'll leave this right down here. "
"11644370","11652310"," Captain wants to buy this or Jim."
"11652990","11653950"," Jim wants to buy this."
"11655290","11661920"," Jim wants to buy this right there. "
"11663040","11663900"," That's what I want to buy."
"11663900","11664920"," I'm bullish."
"11665240","11666220"," I want to buy that right there. "
"11666640","11667560"," Just give it to me."
"11668180","11669660"," Jim wants to buy right there."
"11669960","11670460"," That's what I want to buy. "
"11671140","11672580"," I want to buy calls."
"11676700","11680820"," And I really want to buy, I really want to buy it down here."
"11683400","11685000"," Jim really wants to buy it down here. "
"11685880","11686500"," Really bad."
"11691480","11692100"," Really buy."
"11695450","11696150"," Buy this. "
"11697230","11698610"," Say what Jim doesn't want to do."
"11700170","11701290"," Let's be a chaser."
"11702770","11706390"," He wants to buy dips and he wants to sell reps right. "
"11713380","11718820"," If we're able to trade above this implied move and hold it right here."
"11721430","11725450"," So if we were able to say trade above this and hold this right."
"11726670","11731790"," And if the one minute cop back up to us in the five minute cop back up to us, I'd"
"11731790","11732510"," be a buyer again. "
"11733430","11736170"," Okay, so I can be a buyer above here."
"11737030","11738410"," But I don't want to be a buyer there."
"11738550","11739610"," Oh, shit. "
"11741710","11742890"," Hold on, this is the implied move."
"11743050","11743710"," We'll just move that one up there."
"11744710","11746010"," So where do I want to be a buyer?"
"11746510","11750910"," I don't mind being a buyer here on I'll write this one here. "
"11752130","11752910"," I'll be a buyer."
"11753590","11754210"," Buyer again."
"11756650","11765340"," If, if trend catches up right there. "
"11765940","11767380"," Buyer again, if trend catches up."
"11769040","11770280"," No problem buying there."
"11779720","11780860"," Just PT1, we tag it. "
"11783800","11784500"," PT2 above."
"11797850","11799870"," No, I would love to buy this though to be honest with you."
"11800330","11805010"," So it's such like, it's a, you know, changes to BTD. "
"11806650","11811710"," It is getting a little salty up, that's salty, but a little overbought by the dip."
"11812310","11814110"," And then by the F and dip."
"11817600","11819480"," By the F and dip down below. "
"11824410","11825270"," Right down there."
"11837970","11839830"," Put our three up here for you, dip."
"11841970","11843570"," Put implied move right here so you can see it. "
"11847450","11848210"," Here's our two."
"11848790","11863580"," Oh, you"
"11863580","11865360"," want to look at natural gas right now?"
"11865900","11866220"," You're in Z."
"11866460","11867460"," Do you ever want to get my attention?"
"11868360","11871580"," Somebody just screamed, a fair wing just screamed, what about natural gas?"
"11871780","11877500"," More than welcome to always spend a dollar or something and it'll pop up on my screen and I can"
"11877500","11883840"," see it otherwise where I'm working I don't always, I'm not always looking at the, I'm always"
"11883840","11886660"," looking at the chat."
"11888840","11889320"," UNG. "
"11891920","11892940"," You can see it."
"11910410","11910890"," UNG."
"11920440","11922620"," Nope, he has to come back up and regain. "
"11923120","11924280"," We'll do it again down here."
"11924620","11930920"," This is a nearby is on the one minute right here and your stops is just below it."
"11933360","11934100"," Right here. "
"11939230","11939950"," Right there."
"11941510","11947890"," So you want to wait for a unit for natural gas to get back up again to 839 and we'll"
"11947890","11949870"," look back at UNG and oh, you guys can see this."
"11950030","11950450"," Can you?"
"11954730","11956290"," You guys can't even see this stuff. "
"11956610","11957670"," You guys looking at it."
"11963080","11969180"," You want to wait for UNG to come back to 839 for your next buy opportunity on it."
"11975320","11977600"," Two percent wide strength over Friday is dirt cheap. "
"11979140","11981740"," If two-year-old pops over five percent with velocity, we dumping."
"11983540","11988100"," If two-year-old pops over five percent with velocity, we dumping and buy that for a dollar and if"
"11988100","11989900"," oil popping that means more inflation."
"11990840","11992640"," The market runs up in the close by a put. "
"11996000","11996700"," Who's hebert?"
"11999900","12000700"," Who's hebert?"
"12002280","12002680"," Herbert."
"12003040","12006300"," I still think there's something in the crash from where is the question."
"12007620","12012420"," Yeah, so like Chase just said, still thinking we're sitting up for a crash from where is the"
"12012420","12012720"," question. "
"12013660","12019860"," There's no real, I don't think bulls are concerned about it."
"12020600","12022620"," There's like three places for the bulls right now."
"12025020","12031540"," If you're to bulls right now or like this, hey, I bought the bottom at 3.45 or I bought"
"12031540","12037160"," the bottom at in December, October and December, I bought it. "
"12038140","12040420"," So bulls have all the cards in their favor."
"12041160","12044080"," They can stay long equities and look for a dip to buy."
"12045440","12045500"," Right?"
"12045740","12048260"," Now if they're long equities, like I'm long equities, I hold equities. "
"12049860","12054940"," I have two choices where we are right now or at 4.20, we're just at 4.20, right?"
"12055400","12056240"," I have two choices."
"12057140","12058180"," I've learned about three or four choices."
"12058820","12059500"," So I'm long equities. "
"12059920","12062980"," Think about if you're a bear, think about this from a bull's perspective."
"12064760","12069780"," Let's say pretend, say I bought 3.45. Right?"
"12069900","12070560"," I own the spot."
"12070840","12072420"," I own a million dollars in the spot. "
"12074180","12074620"," Right?"
"12074840","12078000"," And we're now trading 4.20. So what do I do?"
"12079500","12080880"," I just made up a shit ton of money."
"12081740","12082420"," What do I do?"
"12083420","12086480"," I try to relate this to Tesla one day a few weeks ago."
"12086660","12087200"," So what do I do?"
"12090280","12096960"," I was closing on a week on a Friday and I was long Tesla and I was like, well, I"
"12096960","12097560"," don't know what to do here. "
"12098180","12100720"," I was like, we're getting a little long in the tooth on Tesla here."
"12101540","12102800"," And I was like, what am I going to do on a Friday?"
"12102800","12109440"," And I was like, okay, so I looked at some puts and I was like, oh, there's 41 cent puts"
"12109440","12110480"," on the spot."
"12111760","12116580"," I was like, I can buy some cheap puts here because I'm like, I think we're going to 20 or"
"12116580","12117180"," somewhere near it. "
"12117240","12118900"," I think we're at 196 at that point or something."
"12119160","12122240"," And I was like, I think we're going up there."
"12122680","12124540"," No, we're lower. "
"12124740","12126240"," I think we're at 186 or something."
"12126380","12127100"," We're going to 196."
"12128220","12131680"," And I was like, nah, I was like, I still want to stay long to that on Tesla. "
"12131700","12133040"," I'm like, yeah, I'm like, but I need a head."
"12134180","12137420"," So I bought a 41 cent puts over the weekend."
"12138560","12139860"," They cost me 41 cents. "
"12140680","12146000"," If the market were a rollover over the weekend, I would print spy puts."
"12147660","12151360"," If they cost me, so 41 cents it cost me."
"12151580","12158920"," If the market went up over the weekend, I would have made an extra dollar or more on Tesla. "
"12159280","12169480"," So it was a, it was a gain for me of 60 cents, 59 cents minimum on the upside, and"
"12169480","12177320"," probably multiple, multiple, multiple thousands of dollars if it went down and it ended up going"
"12177320","12179240"," down and spy and up in Tesla."
"12179680","12181300"," I didn't believe that would happen, but it happened."
"12182360","12188660"," Tesla actually cranked spy went down and made 71 or 81%, I think, or 80% or 70% on"
"12188660","12190520"," the trade on the spy puts. "
"12190880","12195540"," I stayed long Tesla and it continued to go higher towards 216."
"12195940","12197340"," So it was a great trade all around."
"12198120","12202600"," So think of this from the perspective of a bull, right?"
"12203340","12211240"," Here, they can sell their Tesla or sell their spy and they're in no, no pain right now. "
"12212140","12217220"," They're just looking for a dip by at this point or that we go up and above into a new"
"12217220","12217720"," trading range."
"12218480","12218940"," That's it."
"12219100","12220460"," So you can re-enter the market at one point. "
"12220600","12221820"," We already know where Tesla you can re-enter."
"12221960","12222300"," It's above 220."
"12223240","12225460"," A hold of 220 I can re- we're right now. "
"12225620","12232580"," It's probably going to be like 186 or 190, but once we're above that blue line, if it's defended, I"
"12232580","12236140"," can probably take along there in some relative safety."
"12238240","12244120"," So if not, I'm looking to buy like 196 on spy or 178 or whatever on Tesla."
"12245100","12247540"," So that's the first bull perspective, right?"
"12248080","12250000"," Second bull perspective is, all right, fuck it. "
"12250240","12251380"," I'm going to stay long on Tesla."
"12251680","12256880"," I'm going to stay long on spy only in the underlying and I'm just going to buy a ton of"
"12256880","12257520"," protection up here."
"12258300","12260260"," If it doesn't print, it doesn't matter. "
"12260260","12267080"," So if we have a crash, I buy like 10 or 20 cent or 40 cent puts that are dated"
"12267080","12268580"," out into March."
"12269880","12270840"," What do they cost?"
"12271940","12274180"," So let's say I sold my Tesla."
"12274260","12277580"," I'm not long any equities right now. "
"12278080","12286140"," Now let's say I was long Tesla right now and I'm going to look at March 31st, right?"
"12287200","12293780"," So March 31st, and I think we're going to break 396 and look at that."
"12294860","12296280"," I have to go lower, right?"
"12296520","12298700"," I have to start looking for market crash stuff, right?"
"12299060","12307080"," Like 352, 360s cost $1.32 right now."
"12308400","12315120"," So I'd probably get some 360p's for March 34. "
"12315520","12317240"," I'm going to run a run date here."
"12320120","12320920"," Crazy here."
"12325310","12326250"," Let's look down below. "
"12328630","12330210"," So yeah, no, I wasn't on the wrong date."
"12330430","12333670"," It's like $1.31. They'll probably hold their value for a little while."
"12333830","12335010"," It's probably like on June or something. "
"12335950","12343870"," But if I was to maintain holding Tesla, I'd probably buy $1.31 for the end of March."
"12344610","12347550"," It cost me a buck and a half, a buck and a buck 30 or something."
"12348210","12348670"," So I'm safe. "
"12349490","12358890"," I could probably sell some calls on Tesla at like 240, buy some, buy a $1.32 put on Tesla."
"12359510","12360230"," And I'm going to win."
"12360590","12361430"," I'm not going to lose. "
"12362350","12363190"," I'm going to win if we go up."
"12363370","12364430"," I'm going to win if we go down."
"12365850","12367770"," They probably roll some calls at some point. "
"12367910","12373290"," If we do go up, continue to go up on Tesla and just roll them into the next next month"
"12373290","12373890"," or next quarter."
"12374750","12376690"," So I really can't lose here as a bull."
"12378970","12383050"," So if you're trying to time a top on Tesla or Tesla or spy as a bear right now, you"
"12383050","12384510"," really need to see price velocity down. "
"12385310","12394850"," Number one, break a massive break below 396.397. And then you'd look for the rejection trade to"
"12394850","12395650"," jump in on the trade."
"12398470","12399470"," I don't know what to say to you."
"12399630","12402130"," Is that right now?"
"12404520","12404810"," Yeah. "
"12404930","12405090"," Okay."
"12405330","12407710"," So so so that's my question then."
"12407830","12408010"," Okay. "
"12408070","12411970"," So Mike Wilson is reiterating his 20% down."
"12412370","12416110"," He made that call in October when we're at 345."
"12417350","12422630"," He made the call for a 20% down move in October of 2022. "
"12423570","12425670"," He made the call again in December."
"12426430","12427290"," He was wrong."
"12428030","12431790"," He's making the call again in. "
"12431790","12434570"," We're at a high rate trading for 12 right now."
"12437130","12438550"," So okay."
"12438830","12439510"," Let's look at spy. "
"12440950","12445410"," UNG is coming back into a buy again from watching UNG right now."
"12446110","12450650"," They're trying to reject UNG at eight dollars and thirty seven cents."
"12450990","12457730"," UN you and you need to hold eight thirty seven and eight forty one to take along again. "
"12459590","12461450"," But let's look at spy rope."
"12461630","12463270"," Let's look at SPX or something real quick."
"12463530","12465450"," Like what's 30% right?"
"12465690","12466210"," Let's look at spy. "
"12468230","12477050"," 30% so Mike Wilson called for 20% down move in spy right as the last leg."
"12477050","12479870"," I remember the exact what he said, right?"
"12480750","12482090"," 20% down move."
"12483150","12484250"," He said it in October. "
"12486910","12489130"," Let's look at spy in the background."
"12493540","12494660"," He said it in September."
"12495360","12499500"," Just just to work crystal clear on this crystal clear, right?"
"12502160","12504180"," Just to clear what Mike Wilson said. "
"12509590","12516900"," 20% down move when he first called it back in October."
"12517450","12524660"," This gives us a price of price starting at two eighty."
"12527260","12527660"," Two eighty. "
"12529560","12531680"," 20% price starting from where we are right now."
"12531720","12532520"," You guys know where it is."
"12534590","12537050"," You want me to tell you from today's price right now active price. "
"12547030","12548090"," That's three thirty."
"12549730","12552470"," So that's a 500 point difference."
"12553810","12554810"," Five five hundred points. "
"12557250","12561090"," As a matter of fact that puts us very close to the low from October."
"12563250","12566550"," If you were to look back in three to five years, if this is the end of the bull market"
"12566550","12571770"," or the last leg of the bear market and you look back one year from now then you should have"
"12571770","12576670"," bought October and you should be buying that low that Mike Wilson's calling for in Q1 of point"
"12576670","12577150"," twenty three."
"12578050","12579190"," I don't know what else to say there. "
"12580030","12581330"," You should have been buying October."
"12581750","12582550"," You should buy marks."
"12584370","12585690"," Hopefully you can get left behind. "
"12586430","12587830"," I don't know what to say on this."
"12588450","12600460"," I don't know"
"12600460","12603140"," what else to say about the bull Mike Wilson."
"12608150","12608770"," He did not. "
"12609810","12611570"," He though he said it could rally."
"12614130","12620750"," He said it could rally into December January but he also said that we were starting with that took"
"12620750","12621610"," to expect."
"12621930","12623110"," He said two things. "
"12623810","12627890"," He double spoke in he double spoke in October."
"12628690","12630270"," He said both things."
"12631410","12633750"," He said we're getting the last leg. "
"12634530","12635250"," The bear market."
"12635670","12641850"," It'll likely begin in December for now into December though we can squeeze up in December."
"12643010","12644710"," We're now what's today's day. "
"12645490","12647750"," We're in February 13th."
"12648530","12650150"," February 13th."
"12651410","12656070"," We are four months three almost four months three to four months from when he had said they've made"
"12656070","12656650"," those statements. "
"12657650","12660770"," He gave himself a back door to squeeze up into the end of the year."
"12662370","12666010"," Then he called then he reiterated at the end of the year instead we're going to crash."
"12666330","12666870"," We didn't. "
"12667550","12670750"," We're now in February and we didn't."
"12671350","12675730"," We know that the hedge funds the dumb money leads a bottom."
"12675970","12677210"," They buy the bottom not retail. "
"12677930","12679290"," Dumb money is actually hedge funds."
"12679930","12684490"," They start it and then you see size come into the market afterwards."
"12685510","12691070"," You'll see Mike Wilson's and the company enter the market after if they get squeezed out and above. "
"12692550","12697870"," So if we start trading above 420 and 430 and 440 and 450 and 460 you'll actually see them enter"
"12697870","12699010"," the market at that point long."
"12699830","12703530"," We know that JPM put out a newsletter in December saying they go long."
"12703790","12705130"," That's on that at Captain's Alpha. "
"12705770","12710150"," I posted that there back and remember I said don't get overly bullish but get bullish."
"12711090","12717310"," Talked about XLC, XLY, XLK, all those tickers months ago."
"12718550","12721810"," We know he can't trust anything that they say. "
"12726850","12727790"," He says it all the time."
"12729870","12737910"," I've got a tweet of his from I've got a tweet I've got a note from him on CNBC late"
"12737910","12738490"," last week."
"12739370","12742530"," I've got it I've got it saved to my to a different computer. "
"12743430","12744450"," I've got it savory."
"12744550","12745130"," I'll read it to you."
"12752390","12752930"," Hold on. "
"12753070","12753790"," Maybe I saved it here."
"12753930","12755370"," Let me look and see where if I saved it here."
"12760490","12764590"," Ten problems with my install of Windows not working winky. "
"12765410","12775250"," I have to do that."
"12775530","12783750"," So you know what price they didn't it's funny because they weren't they weren't he wasn't doing"
"12783750","12788150"," interviews and saying that they were buying but he did he did tell his investors that he was buying"
"12788150","12789790"," or JPM did."
"12794880","12804770"," So we're almost that price"
"12804770","12810050"," target to $14.13.04. We're almost at our three here. "
"12810190","12811150"," Sometimes we get a failure."
"12811790","12814050"," We talked about this earlier right this morning."
"12814190","12815590"," I talked to you one. "
"12815890","12816470"," That's over here."
"12817530","12818710"," And then PT two above."
"12819810","12825810"," I talked to you about sometimes we'll get up here and we'll start to fail to make that second that"
"12825810","12826670"," second price target. "
"12826670","12827450"," Sometimes we'll get it."
"12827530","12832190"," The implied moves above at $4.13.70 for the day."
"12832290","12832670"," That's top. "
"12833030","12835190"," You want to know what top is unless"
"12835190","12845310"," we"
"12848730","12852990"," have I'm going to probably take out the buy the dip at this point and you're going to be looking"
"12852990","12855670"," for trading just off of the one minute chart."
"12856570","12862630"," And we're looking for that price target above either a failure or a failure to make a new high on"
"12862630","12864410"," the one minute we've made a new high in the one minute."
"12864450","12867310"," So the the bold move is still alive at this point. "
"12869150","12872750"," We'll keep the buy the fucking dip down below because you get some panic tomorrow."
"12873130","12878630"," I would assume at some point today that we're going to get a violent move higher or lower due to"
"12878630","12886370"," due to the panic over tomorrow's inflation report here over your inflation report."
"12887230","12889090"," But I would like to see this PT two get tagged. "
"12891010","12893630"," 1403 or 14 for 1304."
"12901150","12905430"," Equity market isn't accepting the likelihood the Fed may remain restrictive Morgan Stanley."
"12905980","12906650"," Now they're lying. "
"12908250","12909230"," They're fucking lying."
"12910730","12916190"," The equity market is absolutely pricing in the Fed staying restrictive."
"12917050","12920830"," That's why we're going higher in the moment that they that they tell you that they're not going to"
"12920830","12921190"," be restrictive. "
"12921210","12922530"," We're going to fucking blast down."
"12922810","12924410"," It's going to be a fucking bloodbath."
"12924810","12925610"," It's going to be disgusting. "
"12928320","12930360"," He said it again on Thursday or Friday two week."
"12931100","12932680"," He reiterated again."
"12933120","12935940"," He had said he said it might not play out now. "
"12936560","12941960"," I think on Thursday or Friday he came out and said it might not play out now but by March"
"12941960","12942340"," it will."
"12942960","12947380"," But my point is if even if it does I expect a low on March I think everybody does."
"12947720","12950500"," I think people expect a low on March or April for a summer run. "
"12950760","12952740"," So where's that price at?"
"12953700","12956360"," It looks to me like they're trying to do some separation."
"12957860","12959560"," If you look at the options market."
"12959960","12961020"," If you look at the options market. "
"12961340","12962340"," The options market is showing."
"12962800","12969420"," Let's see the three months out in the options market and see what they're applying for March."
"12969420","12970320"," What they're saying. "
"12971300","12975680"," What Colin put fires are saying for March."
"12976320","12977300"," So for March."
"12979460","12980400"," Let's look at March. "
"12982180","12984480"," Do you guys ready for this?"
"12984940","12990540"," For March the low implied move for March right now is 393."
"12991100","12992780"," 393 28."
"12994000","12995300"," 393 28. "
"12996180","13003160"," The high March 31st implied move is three or four thirty one forty one."
"13003720","13006840"," Fourth or four thirty one forty one for March."
"13006880","13008400"," Dude going into summertime. "
"13009900","13012660"," It's three ninety eight sixty nine in the low."
"13013200","13013940"," This is for April."
"13015680","13022020"," Four thirty five and high and fourth yes so three ninety three ninety nine and for a low on April. "
"13022960","13023820"," That's April fourth."
"13024580","13025320"," Let's look at April."
"13028200","13031460"," We can't really we're not going to know what this really is going to be. "
"13031460","13032600"," This is all this shit."
"13032700","13037200"," All these implied moves are only good for as long as price stays where we are."
"13039840","13041600"," But three eighty four is a low. "
"13043020","13045700"," In in in April May."
"13047940","13054280"," So I mean we can change if we if we start if we have real money selling we're like blasting"
"13054280","13056460"," down the implied move will change again right."
"13057180","13058960"," So the implied moves only as good as it is. "
"13059400","13061000"," It's only as good as price right."
"13062460","13067400"," So the options market we know that the we know that the the bank's controls seventy five percent of"
"13067400","13068400"," the market and real money."
"13068920","13071740"," We know that retail controls point twenty five percent of it. "
"13071980","13073360"," We know most of retail are bullish."
"13074260","13082580"," We know that the banks will sell and buy like a whisper of a fart from a from a mouse"

"15990040","15994240"," see how it starts the angle of attack starts to slow down a little bit this is when you see"
"15994240","16000040"," momentum shifting right so you see momentum shifting here and you're going to kind of expect that"
"16000040","16007980"," same thing down here right you're going to expect momentum to kind of to kind of you know wane a"

"16047180","16052880"," minute they're willing to buy it we know we got the new high right so we're back here we were"
"16052880","16060020"," we had new high right new high new high and we failed on the high right here went back down"
"16060020","16064860"," to check the five minute came back up got a new high and now we're pinging right off the one"
"16064860","16069740"," minute that says we're not done here right um so you now you're looking for price targets above"
"16069740","16075940"," four thirteen oh four and then we've got the implied move of four thirteen seventy above here right"
"16075940","16082820"," so the key here the key here for you is um you know right now there's there's support you know"
"16082820","16089640"," that um if support is going to leave the if the support is going to leave it's going to leave"
"16089640","16095340"," here at the five minute you already know right now this is where the buyers are at least on"
"16095340","16101460"," intraday until they give this up right here we're still bullish and heading higher does it make"
"16101460","16111420"," sense to you um and so just even without talking about um other stuff like i want"
"16111420","16118520"," to start selling here and stuff like that you just got told you just got told right here that um"
"16118520","16125800"," right here that we still we still have demand right we still have demand here um so we're we're"
"16125800","16131360"," still consolidating and not uh distributing at this point we didn't see a quick bloodbath now we"
"16131360","16136140"," didn't see like this quick blacks down and then move up to come coming even lower none of that kind"
"16136140","16141640"," of stuff so um you're still bullish here there's no reason not to be bullish here you know you've"
"16141640","16146080"," got buyers down below if you like well i missed this cap uh you know this bull is the yo's"
"16146080","16151920"," buyers here so if you missed if you missed this you're probably waiting for buyers to step in first"
"16151920","16156640"," so that you can take a trip down here or over here and buy into it so the key here"
"16156640","16162020"," would be um key here is let's say you missed this buy you'd be like okay uh shit i missed"
"16162020","16166960"," this trade right here i missed this this uh bouncing back and forth we're gonna do uh so you're"
"16166960","16174700"," like okay hopefully i can get down here and i'm gonna buy and if i miss the buy or no"
"16174700","16179840"," hopefully it's hopefully it allows me to buy in right hopefully it allows me to buy in and i'll put"
"16179840","16186200"," a stop below because i know that um the buyers are back over here um and if they're not there"
"16186200","16191980"," anymore i've put some stops down below because i don't want to because i don't want to get i don't"
"16191980","16196760"," want these buyers to disappear over here right i think it's the stops down here and i'm hoping and"
"16196760","16201840"," praying that it comes back down for a little bit more support but come on down come you guys will"
"16201840","16205840"," hear me and stream sometimes say this right please don't leave me behind please don't leave me"
"16205840","16209900"," behind please don't leave me behind i'll be like i don't want to chase this i don't want to chase"
"16209900","16218160"," this right because i know now that there's buyers over here and then i'm going to be looking at a"
"16218160","16226880"," book map so if you guys have a book map at home or whatever another another good way to see"
"16226880","16233660"," where supply is and in shocker look at where the supply is way higher you see how high supply is"
"16233660","16241800"," right now um supplies way way up here look at where it is it's way way up there now so"
"16241800","16250340"," we've got we've got buyers we know that we've got known buyers down here we know we don't have too"
"16250340","16256480"," many sellers here we know that the sellers are way way up here or at least book maps telling you"
"16256480","16261760"," that there can be hidden sell orders you don't know about that kind of stuff so we should start"
"16261760","16266720"," squeezing here does that make sense to you we should we should get up there it's that 413 we should"
"16266720","16271400"," get up there and get that even close that implied move possibly unless there's something we don't"
"16271400","16275580"," know that makes sense so right here's not a bad trade right you got to put risk on the market"
"16275580","16282080"," not for you guys but for me i'm not financial advice under paying purposes only uh don't trade with"

"16320400","16324980"," miss the trade and didn't get the price that i wanted there's a reason for that too right um"
"16324980","16330040"," sometimes you'll you'll end you'll chase the trade it'll bounce back and you won't make the money"
"16330040","16334540"," that you won't do you're not positioned right you're not going to keep the money um let's say it's"
"16334540","16340040"," at 10 cents then it goes 20 cents but then it comes back 10 cents for 12 cents so you're"
"16340040","16343900"," constantly chasing and trying to get the right cash if you got it at 10 cents it only comes back"
"16343900","16353040"," 12 so even if you get caught um on a rollover you're still up at least something right because of"
"16353040","16361780"," tafuik thanks for uh thanks for um uh time you had to pronounce it tafuik baby right on brother oh"

"16419230","16426490"," you got a new high right comes back down checks now you got a new high that's bullish right right"
"16426490","16433650"," here you didn't get a new high that's not bullish is it took one two checks to get that new"
"16433650","16438210"," high right did you see that i want you guys to see this so see right here how you got"
"16438210","16443770"," so we check the one for five minute camp here got a new high right to new high you can"
"16443770","16450730"," even write these in here you can write new high on the one minute we took us twice checking the"
"16450730","16458610"," one minute to get a new high here we're losing momentum right you can see it right here we took"
"16458610","16465230"," us two checks or we've paid it below you can see how clean it is down here right how clean"
"16465230","16474150"," and beautiful it is it's like a rocket ship and you start to see us like it takes a little"
"16474150","16481810"," bit longer takes more work less participants right trying to make the price push higher now you can"
"16481810","16488230"," see we went back down here to check right to see if there were still buyers below right and they"
"16488230","16494430"," were so we came back up here right so you're seeing that they're they're checking right you can if"
"16494430","16499050"," you start to see us trading the sideways with new highs you know that we're getting a little losing"
"16499050","16503890"," a little bit of strength you can see that we held below here went back then when we once you"
"16503890","16508550"," found buyers there went right to the one minute we're right off and running again and you're gonna"
"16508550","16515390"," expect that here you're gonna expect or i'm gonna expect um buyers to be stepping in until we get a"
"16515390","16524290"," new high right four twelve seventy six was the first one and then expect us to get new highs again"
"16524290","16530450"," four thirteen oh four now if we don't get a new high on this on this test right here in"
"16530450","16536710"," the one minute right let's see we don't get a new high uh i'm gonna expect us to break through"
"16536710","16543090"," so this should push through the four thirteen oh four if it doesn't and it starts to trade back on"
"16543090","16548910"," that's one minute right you can cut your losses right here and look for rebuy down here at four"
"16548910","16556150"," twelve or es whatever you're trading on spx however you're expressing this trade um so i'm"
"16556150","16561270"," expecting right now right as a if i'm long right here i'm expecting to press to get four thirteen"
"16561270","16567750"," oh four if we fail to get that uh if we fail to get that then i'm going to say"
"16567750","16573450"," ah we're weakening again it's going to take some more momentum to come up and push us up there um"
"16573450","16577250"," now if we fail to get a new high or before we fail to make a new high this is"
"16577250","16582250"," when you hear people say double tops like yeah we had a double top right here i'm embarrassed right"
"16582250","16587869"," and i agree with that if you start to fail right here um you they're going to come back to"
"16587869","16594029"," recheck they're going to come back to recheck these if these fires are real or not or if they're"
"16594029","16599369"," fake so when you see that rejection below they're going to come swing it right back down here and"
"16599369","16606230"," see if these fires still exist down below you don't want to get caught in that do you um so"
"16606230","16610550"," you're going to be raising your stops up so if you have stopped if you're along right now because"
"16610550","16615330"," of where we are in the day you're going to raise these stops up when people say tight stops tight"
"16615330","16620230"," stops they mean it like before you bring your stops up here because you're coming in a known"
"16620230","16626830"," volatility or you're coming into some known resistance on previous time on a previous um high and"
"16626830","16632990"," you know that without a doubt you have to get up so as we trade up here this resistance you"
"16632990","16637710"," can actually go into your trading app and you can just pull these up here pull your stops up pull"
"16637710","16642130"," your stops up so you don't get caught so you're just taking the money and running as you're heading"
"16642130","16649430"," here because you already know you already know that uh this bad boy right here has to face rip up"
"16649430","16655150"," and if it doesn't uh that you're not giving that money back are you right now you might miss this"
"16655150","16659570"," money here there might be a liquidity break that you get stopped out of but you could if you catch"
"16659570","16664830"," that stop you can at least reenter for the for the swing higher does that make sense um so you"
"16664830","16669189"," guys want to be thinking about that as your as your um as you know the day is wearing on"
"16669189","16674790"," as you know most moves been made uh you bring your stops higher and higher and let's say there's a"
"16674790","16679849"," liquidity break here right you go you go boom snapped out of my liquidity break then we slam back"
"16679849","16687330"," down uh we might slam back down once more if this doesn't break right where you get the rejection"
"16687330","16694610"," and then start heading lower if that doesn't break you can just buy that more time right to get up"
"16694610","16701130"," there if you you're checking down below uh to go higher the one thing that I want to caution you"
"16701130","16707630"," of uh if you are a trader okay and I'm not here for you one day you you have to"
"16707630","16716710"," discipline yourself uh to find out where you like to put your stops where you put your buys where"
"16716710","16723150"," you put your ads and where you take off your risk or your your money right you should if you"
"16723150","16729470"," have to type this shit in on your own chart right um uh you have to if you if you"
"16729470","16734790"," let's say let's say we blast through your stops and let's say you blast through your stop boom and"
"16734790","16738890"," you didn't trigger them or your hand doing them when you missed them the moment we trade back up to"
"16738890","16744390"," recheck here get out of your position so that you can reposition does that make sense um you should"
"16744390","16750849"," always be in the right side of the trade uh never ever allow shit like this to happen right here"
"16750849","16760410"," it's gonna come back it's gonna come back uh take the out every single time this is what burns your"
"16760410","16766529"," account right here every single time that's a burn your account uh I promise you that if you're"
"16766529","16771830"," taking uh million little cuts all the time your stops might not be in the right place so you can"
"16771830","16778310"," move your stops up and down uh your ads your buys where you actually buying you can move them down"
"16778310","16783670"," so that you're buying only the best buys in the bottom you can always move your stops lower move"
"16783670","16790910"," your ads lower so that you're not getting stopped on fine tune that uh day trading if you're losing"
"16790910","16796510"," real money out there you should stop day trading with cash and go straight to a paper account down"
"16796510","16802090"," the paper account and paper trade this stuff if you're losing money because it's zero dates in the"
"16802090","16807750"," spot move over to spx spx is going to give you a stable price where you're not going to get"
"16807750","16814390"," smashed out on trades move over to es where you're buying and selling contracts um so that you know"
"16814390","16818610"," uh so that you so that you you can time this stuff appropriately because only time on screen doing"
"16818610","16823610"," this stuff is going to give you um the right time and place to buy you guys hear me talk"
"16823610","16831010"," also about um following the options chains so if you're trading this today and you're following um"
"16831010","16836930"," four or ten c's all day long you know what they started at the beginning of the day you know"
"16836930","16842870"," what they uh priced that up and down all day long if you if you follow one option and it"
"16842870","16846690"," one or two options sometimes in a day i'll do like one two or three unless we get a reversal"
"16846690","16852210"," uh but you can actually use the help of the price as well as the amount of options that you'll"
"16852210","16857090"," start to figure out in the part of the day where they start to kill options where you shouldn't"
"16857090","16862150"," even be buying them right maybe an option started at a dollar over here and uh then they start to"
"16862150","16867950"," grind it back down to like 30 cents like they like it started today right and then we start to"
"16867950","16873870"," move higher again and those 30 cent options that were 30 cents weighed earlier this morning uh now"
"16873870","16879190"," go back from they they pump up to that dollar then come down to that 30 cents maybe they're"
"16879190","16885450"," repriced at 20 cents down they're only going to 40 cents above over here that's what i want you to"
"16885450","16894700"," do out there you know so as you head into the spell"
"16894700","16901160"," um not a bad idea to buy some puts right so start thinking about the clothes today start thinking"
"16901160","16908860"," about what the market is priced in for a move here um start thinking about um being able to that"
"16908860","16913660"," if the one last thing i would tell you is if you're going to buy puts for tomorrow for CPI"
"16913660","16923220"," um make sure that you have the one thing i would say is would be this i would tell you"
"16923220","16931080"," two things i'd say if you want to buy puts for CPI tomorrow wait until a break and hold of"
"16931080","16939420"," the five minute okay that would be we break below it and we we start selling off if you don't"
"16939420","16946820"," see this break below you will have to wait until the close um and possibly even after the close to"
"16946820","16953790"," add your puts in for tomorrow uh break below the five minute that's what you're looking for to be a"
"16953790","16959510"," put fire break below and hold the five minute unless you see that you may just leave something like"
"16959510","16967310"," this on the screen for you i can um here i'll do something like this i'll do something cool you"
"16967310","16989200"," want to see a um let me see i can do this for you break below"
"16989200","16995880"," right there you want to see a break below right there of the five minute this is like projecting uh"
"16995880","17000020"," you know what i'm going to talk about is projecting um you know what i'm going to do is get"
"17001660","17010950"," i'm going to write down hold on a second i don't want to forget this so we have an we"
"17010950","17016750"," have an algorithm for you guys here for the kind of algorithm uh that's going to be offered to you"
"17016750","17026080"," guys and uh"
"17029570","17039530"," and it actually does a really good job so and it does actually project these lines here but"
"17039530","17048350"," i'm going to make sure that uh the tool has a projection uh of this line here so that you"
"17048350","17056150"," can even look for like and i they say don't sell strength um we're now we're now testing our three"
"17056150","17064590"," by the way just so you know price target two is about to be hit um so what i'll do"
"17064590","17072930"," is um i'm going to i'm going to ask if we can build in an extension of the projections for"
"17072930","17078770"," emas on a one-minute chart so that you can actually see this before it happens uh so you'd see"
"17078770","17087090"," something like this and this would move right it would be it would be uh i guess it would it"
"17087090","17095340"," would be something like this right and then um this would"
"17095340","17105340"," be like down along with um if we if we start to break the the one minute we would we"
"17105340","17112180"," would swing down maybe i don't know uh maybe it's not that predictive maybe it's just five minutes"
"17112180","17118740"," or so or maybe just maybe it's like 15 minutes away or something and it's like it's only like this"
"17118740","17127160"," this far in advance um so that you know you can expect that test you don't have to snap a"
"17127160","17131940"," line anymore right there's no more snapping lines instead of having to do this bullshit here you"
"17131940","17142740"," just um you just look for a retest down below here now trading four twelve eighty six baby how's"
"17142740","17152730"," that feeling four twelve eighty nine don't forget to take some money off the"
"17152730","17159650"," table as we approach PT2 at four thirteen oh four uh you're going to expect some kind of rejection"
"17159650","17166110"," above here just as we're coming into it you're going to expect take some take some money off the"
"17166110","17176920"," top here you want to let the algorithms do the work for you to get higher here and"
"17176920","17182020"," that's what you that's what you'd be selling is that five minute right i mean sometimes you'll get"
"17182020","17186700"," it right there'll be traders out there that'll be like i fucking call the top exact and there are"
"17186700","17191680"," times when you can call the top exact there are indicators that will show you uh what the actual"
"17191680","17196700"," top is but the risk of it like risk versus reward you fucking wait and do you get underneath that"
"17196700","17202060"," five minute you wait and do you get underneath that red line if you run that trade like fucking"
"17202060","17208680"," twenty thirty times you're going to fucking lose uh too many it'll blow your should blow your ass"

"17338320","17347370"," I'm going to I'm going to say something so there is a possibility so now we got like the uh"
"17347370","17355070"," silent um the silent market crash in late 2020 and then we got silent market crash all through 2021"

"17400410","17407130"," to happen um and I'm like man it is possible there is a possibility but the way I got a"
"17407130","17415350"," problem with this though I'll explain it after my problem is like it would be fascinating if uh"
"17415350","17423690"," they could do a market crash on just the indexes just the heavy hitters in the indexes and the"
"17423690","17433390"," indexes where you see like uh the big boys get knocked down you see a continuation of and some"
"17433390","17437850"," people have talked about this but it's a very complicated for it to happen I'm going to explain why"
"17437850","17442610"," I don't know I think it's going to happen um but their point is the point of this conversation"
"17442610","17448890"," would be you'd see a resumption of a downward move for Facebook you would see a continuation down"
"17448890","17455390"," for Tesla um for bang man plus t and a bunch of other big big companies that still need knock"
"17455390","17463170"," down even deeper and you'd actually see a move down in the indexes but then you would see other um"
"17463170","17471390"," you would see a trend or you would see other parts of the market do very well during this last"
"17471390","17481620"," leg you could see like heavy waiters in the indexes get wet but"
"17481620","17491360"," see like speculative growth that actually makes it start to rise and you could see the rise of"
"17491360","17501050"," you could see the rise of new companies that may replace bang man plus t in five"
"17501050","17510950"," ten years so you the thought process here would be we replace"
"17510950","17517690"," companies in the s&p 500 and when we do it usually takes three to five years somewhere in there"
"17517690","17523630"," um so you'd see them start to begin to trade down even though the market's going up and you might"
"17523630","17529510"," see the s&p 500 and accused trade sideways during that period of time you we have in the past"
"17531250","17538790"," um so you could see like one final uh that this or whenever this one final leg is if it's"
"17538790","17543930"," now in March or if it's in the end of the year you could see them whack some of these"
"17543930","17552690"," heavy waiters in these indexes see the s&p 500 maybe accused the night of um trade sideways down"
"17552690","17560510"," you would see other aspects though of the market continued to trade up um to become the next uh"
"17560510","17567990"," heavy waiters in five years or ten years in the indexes so we're thinking five ten years down the"

"17641240","17646880"," weak here right so i'm not gonna buy here where we took trades above the one minute again to buy"
"17646880","17652760"," uh and actually i'm going to look for a buy down below now so i wasn't paying attention here um"
"17652760","17661080"," i'm going to wait for to recover on the one minute or go back down below and check um my"
"17661080","17672420"," price target's hit so this PT2 is done 1404 412 96 sounds good to me this was"
"17672420","17679500"," the scene of the crime just so you know you're going to find some resistance here because of um"
"17679500","17685420"," where the crime took place we're gonna go back to this conversation because uh we're i need to stay"

"17706580","17716680"," here's the scene of the crime this is actually where it took place just"
"17716680","17724920"," so you can see it's right here right there is the scene of crime right there is where they teed"
"17724920","17732920"," up see it right there right that's exactly where they teed up right here traded up rejected right"
"17732920","17736260"," here it was on right well you got a little bit of a rejection here but this is the big"
"17736260","17741720"," one this is where there's one friend of tell bears and i'm talking to bears and i'm like i'm like"
"17741720","17749140"," see this blast down right here you're like oh i missed it no you didn't it just needed to come"
"17749140","17756280"," back up to the cross see the cross right there do you see the cluster do you see it do"
"17759320","17765680"," you see the cluster you're like oh i missed it oh man oh man truth is it came right back"
"17765680","17773260"," up to that cluster right there and that was uh the tell boom and then it was boom right off"
"17773260","17780560"," the one minute boom right off the one minute there's the bearish cross right there right see it"
"17780560","17787740"," that's the bearish cross right there see how the the white line came underneath the red lines right"
"17787740","17794000"," here and you get missed the trade by taking it right here right you're looking for that same cross"
"17794000","17803900"," over here that same cross looking for we don't see that cross yet do we so how does how"
"17803900","17811880"," would that cross play itself out over here you would see this come up right you would see the white"
"17811880","17821630"," line come down right here right and you would see"
"17821630","17831510"," price feel like that's right price would start to come down right"
"17831510","17839250"," would blast down right here and then it comes right back up to that bearish trader right there is"
"17839250","17846950"," the blare bearish busted and this is where the real money is right there make sense that's where"
"17846950","17852210"," the money is right there and that trade on this cluster right here it'd be like oh what i caught"
"17852210","17858030"," all that then i closed the perfect that's it matters this is what matters right here this is the"
"17858030","17870860"," money shot um so my point though uh my point behind this is that my"
"17870860","17878920"," point behind this is that um and i would be buying here if you're a fire you wouldn't we hit"
"17878920","17882760"," the price start we hit price start two we're good just price start we got it we got it yay"
"17882760","17891770"," now and you see we're losing this right here right we don't want to lose this doing"
"17891770","17901740"," we don't want to lose this at all doing now so my point to you here is that um"
"17903020","17910740"," come back down and check to see if there's any support i don't think that there is and so you're"
"17910740","17917740"," waiting for that wait for a little bit more here you could buy uh see that white cross right there"
"17917740","17926380"," you see it you see that red but you see it right here there's the red right watch the white"
"17926380","17936320"," cross right here over the red right if"
"17936320","17945920"," you could get price get under here that would be your bloodbath right there okay you see that and"
"17945920","17951300"," it's not supposed to be white supposed to be green right there but uh you get the point right watch"
"17951300","17955860"," this cross of this white coming down you want to see the cross of the white over the red and"
"17955860","17963420"," we know where the implied move is down below it's down here right right there the implied movement"
"17963420","17977040"," downside we buy the fucking dip is right here now the"
"17977040","17983060"," problem with this thing is i can't tell you i can't see we're not going to see if that if"
"17983060","17990940"," that happens yet but if we do see it so let's say between now and march we do see uh"
"17990940","17998940"," just uh fang man plus t big waiters in the indexes um all of them i wm um fucking uh"
"17998940","18007560"," um wm twos s&p 500 if you do start to see that happen if you're a bear and you"
"18007560","18012640"," start to see that happen or even a bullet doesn't matter uh but if you do see it start to"
"18012640","18016480"," see that i'm saying that would be the only thing they can think of for that that bear mark that"
"18016480","18021540"," last leg would just would be might see it uh with a where they slam down just those last stock"
"18021540","18027780"," right you have how we had the uh silent crash in 2020-21 and the end of 2020 all 2021"
"18027780","18036520"," you might have like a silent crash on just big names heavy hitters and you might see the indexes go"
"18036520","18041220"," down but you might see a lot of the market actually continue to head higher now the only argument i"
"18041220","18046680"," can see against this happening uh would be if we've been told that in the past what happens is"
"18046680","18052260"," people get greedy like if they're like oh the market's going up i'm not buying that that new that"
"18052260","18057560"," new tech for whatever i'm gonna still buy apple and tesla so you might see some of that uh you"
"18057560","18063000"," really need to see like bad news come out with those companies for people like people can't quit"
"18063000","18070520"," their drug habit is the i guess the point i'm trying to say uh then you'll see like fucking apple"
"18070520","18075440"," and tesla keep going up because they can't give it up they have to be like a lot of these"
"18075440","18083440"," always like fame fame and plus t company fame and plus t company bulls that they're always bulls in"
"18083440","18089540"," it right they might say i hate meta or i hate um tesla or i hate this or i hate"
"18089540","18094780"," that even my fuckers will buy no matter what you know that meta buyers were out there just waiting"
"18094780","18100240"," Netflix buyers were just out there waiting no matter what they tell you but you'll be like yeah i'm"
"18100240","18106480"," selling my membership to Netflix these motherfuckers just want a cheap price for um for fucking"
"18106480","18112800"," Netflix and for meta um so and until they're like until they're beaten down into the ground like"
"18112800","18119980"," take a six foot uh grave for them uh and bury them in concrete like eight feet of concreteness or"
"18119980","18129820"," a foot grave where they feed a concrete then you bolt it to the ground you're not you're not gonna"
"18129820","18137960"," see you're not gonna see um then give it a click it's like pry it from their dope cold dead"
"18137960","18141980"," hands but i think that would be the only thing i'd be looking for so here's the point i'm making"
"18141980","18148880"," there is um if this let's say the spy does break 396 and we hold underneath it we get price"
"18148880","18158260"," acceleration man we get um we get some kind of um uh"
"18158260","18167700"," silent mark crash on bang man plus t and the indexes and you are both uh i would then uh"
"18167700","18173860"," take the perspective of looking if you're like i don't want to get bearish again kappa this is just"
"18173860","18180680"," breaking my heart here i might say to you um just to at least begin to look around other places"
"18180680","18188340"," in the market uh because there may not be a crash in other places it wouldn't shock me i should"
"18188340","18195740"," say if there was another leg down uh to see some of like this new tech uh continue to rise"
"18195740","18205180"," during that last leg but you might see like so there may be the seedlings of the next bull run"
"18205180","18212740"," in five years or ten years taking root um in the market and there are ways to find those tickers"
"18212740","18220500"," um one of the best ways to find those tickers um well i'm not gonna tell you we're gonna say"
"18220500","18226000"," but we're not we're not there we're we're we're at another right time to show you but i'll show you"
"18226000","18234040"," uh you guys don't remember that right any guys that have faded longer than the covid crash know"
"18234040","18241520"," what i'm talking about um when they when they take large companies out of the indexes and replace"
"18241520","18247940"," them with new ones is what i'm talking about when you take heavy headers out they rotate out heavy"
"18247940","18254960"," headers they rotate in new matter matter fact actually shouldn't say that wrong post covid was uh"
"18254960","18261560"," did tesla get added to the sp500 post covid or pre covid can you remember so tesla was added to"
"18261560","18268100"," let me find out tesla was a prime example of that they would probably be the most recent big one"
"18268100","18276580"," right when did tesla us eagle forward crude output in february due to the rise due to rise to the"
"18276580","18282720"," highest since march 2015 or no the tau jones industrial average maybe they could be wrong which one"
"18282720","18292360"," they entered yeah so tesla entered um the s&p 500 on uh the summer 21st of uh 2020"
"18295620","18302380"," um and i if you guys remember there was like a um i remember like the original announcement and"
"18302380","18307080"," then as we enter and then as they entered there was like two big vol to moments in both the"
"18307080","18313300"," indexes and uh the actual entry i think they ran it up and then ran it down and ran it"
"18313300","18318440"," or then ran it down on entropy day i don't remember exactly but you have to go back and research"
"18318440","18328240"," that shit but um you guys remember in 2017 was it everyone GE was just getting fucking ass"
"18328240","18333580"," block or shouldn't be swearing there when GE was getting destroyed and they were saying like"
"18333580","18343420"," there's no way GE's coming back like they found out that um they like parted it all out and they"
"18343420","18347380"," look at t back in the day this is i don't know how many years ago that was some of"
"18347380","18350740"," that you guys asked me shit like seven ten years ago i'm gonna be like oh i have no idea"
"18350740","18359060"," no if you go back and do some due diligence of some kind like GE i think was one uh"
"18359060","18368340"," that was look at GE on a daily or a weekly i guess right i'd probably go weekly so what's"

"18383020","18389700"," i don't think GE's tesla but i think that's the point right you can look back and check out a"
"18389700","18397140"," chart for your general electric they were trading 196 dollars and this is a big stink and they said"
"18398180","18403780"," and during that time frame it was big news at that time where in fact i think this is when"

"19341140","19341780"," That's Barry."
"19342440","19344020"," That's Barry for the bears, baby."

"19347420","19348060"," Look at me in the background."
"19348320","19348880"," Look at him over there."
"19349380","19351200"," Look at that smug look on his face. "
"19352440","19353140"," All right."
"19353260","19353760"," That's good."
"19353940","19354180"," That's good. "
"19354460","19355320"," He's back in the room."
"19355320","19356640"," So he's in here, checking us out."
"19356640","19357140"," So we got a."
"19357800","19358620"," The bears are in here. "
"19365690","19371480"," Looks like the bears are trying to tee off right now in the one minute down below."
"19372920","19375780"," So we already tagged this right here, so we'll get rid of this one because gone."
"19376460","19378240"," Bears new price target down below. "
"19378960","19380720"," It is right down here."
"19381340","19381960"," Bears got a."
"19383100","19385500"," They got one more right here and they got another one."
"19387540","19389000"," They got another one right over here. "
"19390240","19394020"," None of the two targets for bears to clean up."
"19394920","19395820"," I'll pin the points."
"19396080","19396540"," I'll show you guys. "
"19396940","19397380"," I'll put a."
"19399660","19401660"," I'm going to need this right here."
"19403140","19407720"," So here's so they tagged this one already and they've got one more right here and they got another"
"19407720","19412800"," one down below right here and you've got the implied move in the day down below right here for 10."
"19413480","19417300"," The bears want to see a rejection here. "
"19417300","19419500"," This is, you could call that a rejection, I guess."
"19420020","19421040"," It's close right here."
"19421560","19424100"," Another place for the bears to tee off to go lower. "
"19425220","19430420"," I don't know if it's there yet, but it looks like it's pretty close to get down here."
"19431480","19432320"," They did just."
"19432720","19433080"," Well, they do. "
"19433200","19433820"," I shouldn't."
"19433900","19435520"," I kind of fucked this up here."
"19436640","19438040"," They already hit this one. "
"19438580","19440220"," So they already blasted through that one."
"19440400","19441360"," So we just have this one left."
"19441880","19442940"," Four eleven oh nine. "
"19443040","19444800"," Next price target down below for the bears."
"19445600","19452400"," They do want to see this rejection continue lower and tee off down to a mistake on my."
"19453800","19457960"," They want to see this one last little blast down right here and tag this previous low over here. "
"19458500","19462080"," And then we've got the start of the day down here where this yellow box is."
"19462620","19464200"," You can see it right there."
"19465200","19467620"," And we know that the by the dip of the bulls is down here. "

"20199400","20200840"," I can't look at it on this one."
"20200920","20201340"," Hold on here."
"20201440","20203120"," Let me look at it in a different policy here. "
"20243810","20245290"," Yeah, that's probably it right now."
"20245350","20245990"," I think that's it."
"20246150","20247570"," I think that's as low as we go right now. "
"20249130","20250930"," Uh, probable."
"20251910","20253070"," You see nine 29."
"20253710","20255250"," That's probably bottom right there. "
"20257190","20259270"," That is probably the dip that you want to buy."
"20264110","20264990"," I'm almost sure."
"20265690","20267270"," Almost 100% sure. "
"20268450","20272350"," Look down there."
"20273110","20274730"," Yep, that's probably bottom right there."
"20276390","20278270"," Uh, hold on one second here. "
"20300050","20301910"," I think that's, I think that's bottom right there."
"20301970","20303050"," If you're a bear, get out right now."
"20303130","20303290"," Okay. "
"20306250","20307770"," Um, see this little yellow."
"20309170","20310670"," Well, you guys see this very real quick."
"20310890","20310990"," Okay. "
"20311350","20312450"," This is the spy above."
"20316530","20317870"," That's probably the bottom."
"20318030","20319590"," I'm going to show you how I can tell here. "
"20322890","20323430"," Right here."
"20323770","20326550"," See this, uh, see this yellow box that I have right here."
"20326890","20330250"," And you see how we're bottoming out right down here. "
"20330250","20331090"," You can look right down here."
"20331090","20332470"," You can see us bottoming out right now."
"20332870","20336950"," So in the five minute we are trading higher at this point, uh, be really careful if you're a bear. "
"20337510","20340050"," Uh, the, the down move is probably over."
"20347370","20347910"," Come on."
"20348030","20349910"," Now why can't I get this thing to go where I want to go?"
"20352230","20353310"," Give me a second here guys. "
"20359470","20369540"," All right, that's"
"20369540","20369760"," better."
"20370420","20370740"," Okay."
"20372340","20372780"," That's better. "
"20382450","20384050"," The bear move is probably over."
"20384170","20384770"," I'm going to show you this."
"20386010","20387730"," Uh, not guaranteed. "
"20388550","20390590"," I'm going to show you why it's probably over here."
"20390730","20392970"," Uh, not guaranteed."
"20393350","20396390"," You want, you want to see, you want to see like the selling off the one minute here. "
"20397070","20397630"," All right."
"20397930","20398830"," So here I'm going to say this."
"20401190","20403710"," So we have the bearish cross above right here. "
"20403750","20403990"," Okay."
"20406490","20407890"," We sold it down, right?"
"20410570","20415050"," And you, you can, without, without even looking at, at, uh, at momentum."
"20415990","20417530"," See this white line in this red line?"
"20417730","20419530"," You don't want to, we don't want to spend time here. "
"20419630","20422630"," So if you're a bear, you're like, okay, are we going to go back down again or not?"
"20423490","20425950"," Um, you don't want to see us spend a lot of time here."
"20425950","20429710"," You don't want to see this line go sideways or start to move up."
"20430150","20431150"," Same thing goes with the red line. "
"20431150","20431430"," Okay."
"20431950","20436290"," You want to see the bears tee off on this, on this one minute right here."
"20436310","20436550"," Okay. "
"20437670","20440090"," Uh, the more time we spend here, the worst it is."
"20440350","20443190"," So if you were to buy, uh, another put here, right?"
"20443990","20445370"," You're like, okay, I'm going to buy another put."
"20447910","20449250"," Let's see if I bought a put here. "
"20450630","20451130"," Let's see."
"20451210","20452330"," Let's see about it right here."
"20453410","20453710"," Right. "
"20454450","20459350"," Uh, the more time we spend here, the more chance that momentum is over for the downside."
"20460050","20460130"," Okay."
"20460790","20465950"," They may be like, well, how can you tell without, how can you tell, uh, before this happens that"
"20465950","20467330"," the, that the downtrend is over. "
"20467630","20468790"," It'll be your next question, right?"
"20469290","20472070"," Like, how do you know even before it shows itself, the momentum is over."
"20472750","20477810"," Um, how are you going to look for it is you're going to look right here."
"20480110","20482830"," And you see this, you see those red bars right there. "
"20483250","20485750"," So what I'm looking for down here is."
"20486750","20490930"," I'm looking to see if if these yellow bars increase."
"20493410","20494330"," Wait a minute here. "
"20494990","20504510"," I want to see if these yellow bars are going to increase or decrease"
"20504510","20509210"," even if, even if price is lower."
"20510070","20511750"," It hasn't gone up yet."
"20511950","20516270"," So if I start to see this happen over the next five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. "
"20516810","20523170"," I'm going to know how momentum is going back up again to go back and get some new highs."
"20524430","20529670"," If these bars start to get down, even if price hasn't gone down yet, then I'm going to know we're"
"20529670","20530950"," not done going down yet."
"20531170","20531670"," Does that make sense?"
"20532550","20533150"," Like right over here. "
"20533450","20533930"," See that over there?"
"20534670","20535610"," See that over there?"
"20537250","20538810"," So that's what I'm looking for right now."
"20539410","20540550"," I'm trying to watch right now."
"20540630","20542470"," And right now it looks like momentum is over. "
"20542470","20549490"," You can actually see the you're starting to see momentum shift to the upside, right?"
"20549710","20553370"," So it might have hit a bottom right here and you can see that bottom as it corresponds right there."
"20554210","20556390"," So you could say, yeah, by the depth right there."
"20556510","20556970"," Does that make sense?"
"20561420","20567720"," So I think that I think it's over personally, but so I think that the bear town is over for"
"20567720","20567900"," now. "
"20567900","20574020"," It looks like it's over for now and then you're going to be looking for the next line above here"
"20574020","20576140"," for trade from here to here."
"20577400","20581380"," And then you'll see if we actually reject and head back down here, right?"
"20581580","20587800"," So for every every 15 minute hour interval, we're going to see in a matter of fact, it's a three"
"20587800","20589320"," o'clock right now surprise surprise."
"20590180","20593840"," We're going to either be in power hour right now or we're going to start selling the market into"
"20593840","20594280"," the close. "
"20595020","20597620"," I already gave told you guys what I thought would happen tomorrow."
"20598940","20600560"," I'll go over it one more time with you."
"20600580","20601220"," What are you guys doing?"
"20601220","20601920"," Why are you guys?"
"20602200","20603000"," Why are you guys tipping?"
"20605570","20606930"," What are you guys doing in there?"
"20609910","20610230"," Jesus. "
"20612250","20613830"," Not for real shorts in my opinion."
"20613990","20614890"," Bears never have any fun."
"20615190","20615950"," Bears have tons of fun. "
"20616190","20617430"," You know, I was thinking about that."
"20617730","20622790"," So I was talking to some buddies and I was like, I was like, man, I was like, there's no"
"20622790","20624430"," like live stream for bears out there."
"20624530","20627070"," There's like people that short the market, but there's no like bear stream. "
"20627270","20630030"," I'm like, I want like whenever a selling, I want the bears to have fun."
"20630310","20634490"," So I'll try to make it fun for bears when we can."
"20636690","20640650"," So so so momentum has slowed here, right?"
"20641630","20642950"," So we've slowed momentum here. "
"20647650","20649750"," Momentum is slowed on the downside here, right?"
"20650050","20651850"," So we know it's probably a Bible dip down below."
"20652530","20655070"," We know we're coming into 3 p.m. hour, right?"
"20655190","20656510"," It's 259, 258."
"20658050","20661070"," Let me make sure the financial juice stuff is on so that we can get. "
"20661870","20665650"," So we can get updates for buyers sell here."
"20666430","20670510"," Let's talk about the next five days and just to recap in the three o'clock hour, what we're talking"
"20670510","20674570"," about, we know that the implied move for today was right here."
"20675350","20679650"," We know that this was the implied move for today and we're pretty much staying in it, right?"
"20680910","20684910"," We know that the implied move, though, does change over time, right?"
"20685130","20690110"," We know that the implied move starts to get much higher and lower. "
"20690750","20690930"," Okay."
"20691610","20696310"," And you can see down here, Captain Jim wants to really buy this down here really bad."
"20697070","20697430"," Right?"
"20697750","20699830"," I want to like, I want to put some fat money on this. "
"20700110","20704650"," I want to put a fat stop underneath and if the bears get their way with me, I'm stopped out"
"20704650","20705590"," and so be it."
"20705690","20707310"," But if they're not, I want to buy a dip."
"20707670","20708830"," That's what I want to buy a dip. "
"20709830","20711450"," And I want to buy this down here."
"20711530","20712210"," We can get down here."
"20712290","20714130"," This S3 on some bad news. "
"20714890","20717190"," I truly believe if we get any kind of bad news."
"20717890","20718830"," I'm going to tell you something."
"20718990","20721490"," What I really think me personally, right?"
"20721810","20722670"," What I want to see happen. "
"20722670","20723450"," I'll buy again."
"20723450","20726630"," If we get, if the trend gets up here, I'll buy this again."
"20727090","20727950"," So heading into tomorrow. "
"20728950","20732930"," What I think is going to happen is I think they're going to tell you."
"20733530","20734310"," CPI bad."
"20736130","20737630"," And it's not going to be real. "
"20737630","20738610"," I think that's good."
"20738710","20740450"," That CPI bad is going to take us down here."
"20741190","20742130"," Probably get a bounce. "
"20743430","20744470"," Oh, how about this?"
"20744670","20744950"," I love that."
"20745050","20745490"," I gave you this."
"20746650","20747390"," CPI bad. "
"20748950","20750010"," Vol comes off."
"20750010","20751910"," We squeeze higher and then we bloodbath down here."
"20752070","20753230"," Maybe I'll make it more realistic. "
"20754710","20755110"," Right."
"20755530","20756970"," And then we get some more bad news."
"20757830","20759210"," And we get bear town into Friday. "
"20759410","20761430"," And we buy that bullshit down there sometime."
"20761870","20763030"," That's what I think is going to happen."
"20765310","20767730"," And I think that's, I think that's the plan. "
"20768050","20769030"," Because what other vault do we have?"
"20769210","20772310"," Do we have any of the volatility on deck right now for the month?"
"20773450","20775390"," What do we have for all of that?"
"20776050","20779310"," So do you guys let me know in the chat if we have any of the vault expected."
"20780210","20781050"," I don't think so."
"20781210","20784630"," So I think they're going to mix up some bullshit reasons to get us down here. "
"20784630","20785530"," So there's a dip to buy."
"20786630","20788950"," So we'll get some bullshit reasons into the end of the week."
"20788950","20789810"," We'll buy a dip. "
"20790190","20791130"," Everybody be happy."
"20791410","20792170"," You get careful."
"20792330","20795090"," I want you guys to be careful because if you're a bear, right?"
"20795630","20797350"," Just make sure that if you're a bear. "
"20799050","20801830"," Make sure they don't pull any bullshit on you where they're like."
"20802530","20807070"," CPI bad inflation bad everything bad everything super bad, right?"
"20807510","20812450"," And they come back and go, yeah, but you know, it's getting better."
"20812550","20813290"," We made a mistake. "
"20813290","20814290"," That kind of bullshit."
"20815170","20818870"," If you if you're a bull or a bear and you want to know, is it really bad?"
"20819070","20819930"," Is it like really bad?"
"20820110","20820630"," Like truly bad?"
"20820910","20822030"," You're going to see this."
"20822670","20824970"," You're going to see a bloodbath straight down. "
"20824970","20826770"," Maybe a liquidity grab bloodbath straight down."
"20826770","20828630"," It'll be straight down below 396."
"20829250","20833130"," With lash back up and then we're going to start banging down to much lower levels. "
"20833270","20835910"," You'll see 380 360 and that kind of stuff."
"20836270","20836430"," Okay."
"20837150","20837830"," It'll be ugly. "
"20838570","20839210"," You'll know it."
"20839510","20840110"," Trust me."
"20840810","20848170"," Be like soberish soberish as a bear because your only real move is like blast down here. "
"20848650","20849710"," Blast down here."
"20849850","20850910"," This is what you want to see as a bear."
"20851050","20852090"," You want to see like blasting. "
"20852670","20853450"," We're blasting down."
"20853630","20854850"," You don't want to see any bullshit selling."
"20855410","20857770"," You want to see like real money selling. "
"20857770","20860890"," You want to see banks going, fuck you know we're going down."
"20861690","20864990"," We're hitting blood, baby."
"20866310","20867430"," That's what you want to see. "
"20867730","20867990"," All right."
"20868170","20868850"," You want to see blood."
"20869030","20870710"," You want to see big, big, big blood. "
"20871570","20872570"," Are we getting blood here?"
"20872790","20873910"," No, we still haven't seen blood yet."
"20875170","20876270"," Still haven't seen blood."
"20878330","20879410"," That's not good enough. "
"20880390","20882050"," Retested is not good enough for me."
"20882830","20883830"," I want to see blood."
"20884030","20884770"," I want to see rejection. "
"20884770","20888610"," I want to see rejection."
"20892170","20893430"," A little bit of it."
"20893610","20895750"," I see a little bit of another spinner. "
"20895910","20898490"," I see a little more of that yellow."
"20899650","20901730"," More sellers stepping in right there."
"20902210","20902650"," Give me one more. "
"20902790","20903710"," Do one more thing."
"20903970","20904310"," Just check."
"20907480","20911880"," U.S. to sell 26 million more barrels from the strategic crude reserve. "
"20922990","20928670"," Delivery for new U.S. SPR sales expected between April and June and the new U.S. strategic crude"
"20928670","20930530"," oil sales were mandated by Congress."
"20931750","20933510"," I'm looking here in the background right now."
"20933550","20934090"," I'm still not. "
"20936810","20938710"," I could come down a little bit more."
"20939290","20939910"," You might be right."
"20940110","20940990"," Who killed Nick?"
"20941270","20942370"," You might get more blood, dude. "
"20942970","20944390"," You might get more blood in this close."
"20944710","20944990"," You know what?"
"20945370","20946210"," Nick might be right here."
"20947110","20948050"," Nick might be right. "
"20953710","20955530"," Monday the 13th."
"20955530","20957450"," When was Monday the 13th?"
"20958870","20959890"," You might get it, Nick."
"20960390","20962690"," If you get one more rejection here, you might get it, brother. "
"20963370","20964410"," You might get it."
"20964890","20969110"," We're going to find out in the next minute or so if you get that last blood moved down."
"20969830","20970830"," You might get it. "
"20971810","20972490"," You might."
"20972870","20974150"," I'm watching it right now in the background."
"20977080","20980060"," We're on the zero line right now, so we'll find out right now if you're going to get it. "
"20981300","20983480"," Sellers need to really step in right here."
"20983640","20985060"," They got to hold this."
"20986280","20990640"," If you wanted to take another bearish position, you could do one more right here. "
"20990700","20991500"," You could do one more."
"20992960","20995680"," You do one more put right here, right where we are currently."
"20996160","20998020"," Have a sell or a stop or I could. "
"20998320","20998720"," Not you guys."
"20999480","21006380"," Sell or a stop above 4.1189. But it's, you know, it's looking like it's done."
"21007280","21008840"," We'll find out here in just a minute. "
"21009340","21011120"," Even if we retest, it looks like we're done."
"21012600","21013860"," Still looks like we're done here."
"21018300","21019120"," Yeah, give me. "
"21019780","21020780"," You guys want to be."
"21021080","21021880"," You guys want to be."
"21023220","21023720"," You guys want to be. "
"21023720","21025540"," You guys want to be careful next couple days."
"21025540","21026540"," If you're a bear, you want to be."
"21026880","21028100"," You want to have your targets. "
"21028200","21030360"," You want to be like, we better get underneath this number."
"21030720","21032440"," I want to get underneath the implied move."
"21032880","21034900"," I want to reject off their implied move. "
"21035360","21036700"," And I want to start selling this market."
"21039460","21042900"," I'm my thoughts on gold or I have to look at it again right now."
"21042900","21045200"," I've got some weird thoughts on all of this stuff. "
"21045420","21047580"," Like I know that we need oil to go up."
"21049200","21051480"," For the market to go up and gold to go up."
"21051780","21053080"," For the dollar to go down. "
"21053760","21054680"," For the market to go up."
"21054780","21056320"," I understand that the concept is behind all that."
"21056460","21056800"," I want you guys. "
"21057020","21057840"," If you guys haven't."
"21058200","21059320"," Let me show you guys some cool."
"21059760","21060780"," Let me show you guys some cool. "
"21064890","21065830"," Let me show you guys some."
"21066350","21067050"," Or on your own."
"21067170","21067510"," How about this?"
"21067930","21068650"," On your own time. "
"21068810","21069430"," I want you to do this."
"21069650","21069730"," Okay."
"21070890","21071510"," On your own time. "
"21071630","21072030"," I want you to do this."
"21074210","21075610"," My thoughts on gold is this."
"21076250","21076910"," I want you to. "
"21077430","21078130"," On your own time."
"21078310","21079430"," I want you to go and."
"21080630","21081950"," Open up a trading chart. "
"21082950","21084650"," I want you to put on."
"21085370","21089290"," I want you to put on."
"21089630","21090130"," I want you to put on. "
"21090250","21091250"," Holy shit."
"21091270","21091550"," Look at."
"21091750","21092170"," Look at crude. "
"21092710","21092950"," Oh."
"21095230","21095730"," Crude, baby."
"21096330","21098190"," I want to talk to you guys about some. "
"21098410","21099530"," I want you guys to think about something."
"21099530","21102210"," If you're like a commodity bull or a."
"21102810","21103970"," Oil bull or a."
"21104950","21105650"," Gold bull."
"21105910","21106430"," That kind of stuff. "
"21107130","21108550"," I think normally you're going to expect."
"21110850","21113130"," Those things to come up and then the dollar to fall."
"21113790","21116250"," And then hey, your wife's boyfriend's with us. "
"21116290","21116670"," What's up brother?"
"21116870","21117270"," How are you doing?"
"21119870","21121730"," The expiration can be a source of."
"21121910","21123490"," Of volatility as well."
"21123490","21124190"," I agree with that. "
"21126070","21127690"," I do want you to look at."
"21127690","21130610"," But I want you guys to look on like a larger, a larger time frame."
"21130870","21132970"," I want you to bring up a chart with SPX. "
"21133590","21136450"," I want you to then bring up the yield curve inversion."
"21136970","21138230"," And I want you to bring up."
"21138770","21143130"," A yield curve version and then bring up your favorite ticker like oil. "
"21143730","21143770"," Gold."
"21144670","21147490"," And I want you to look in previous history like years ago."
"21148550","21150730"," Sometimes you'll see oil go up with the market. "
"21151670","21152970"," With the yield curve in rates."
"21153210","21154630"," I put bed funds right in there."
"21154630","21159210"," The bed funds rate is being stabilized and slowly added. "
"21159990","21161890"," In previous history and we've got a yield curve inversion."
"21162770","21163250"," We have some."
"21163390","21166490"," It's like so if the market's going to crash high or go up. "
"21166990","21169750"," Like an example would be oil went up in 2020."
"21170250","21170270"," Right."
"21171950","21174610"," But there are other instances where it has not gone up. "
"21175670","21177170"," While the fed was raising rates."
"21179130","21180470"," And it hasn't."
"21180590","21182490"," It's diverged from the greater market. "
"21183590","21185750"," I'll try to bring that up for you guys tomorrow if I can."
"21185930","21187850"," I'll try to show you some instances of that in the past."
"21196370","21198450"," And I'll do gold tomorrow as well with that. "
"21198690","21199230"," We'll look at gold."
"21200050","21200850"," We'll look at oil."
"21201890","21203250"," We'll look at commodities like copper. "
"21205630","21209350"," It's really fascinating to compare all of those together."
"21213410","21216150"," That's a fair question too right the companies that were involved."
"21216910","21221590"," Was it CSX someone on someone on the Internet was talking about. "
"21222830","21225110"," They were part of that union dispute right those companies."
"21227630","21229470"," I'm going to give you a shot tonight your wife's boyfriend."
"21234570","21240530"," Brave heart I got you covered man if you brave heart show up tomorrow and a day or or first"
"21240530","21241810"," part of the day I'll have that chart. "
"21242290","21244930"," I'll snap some pictures of it for you and show it to you."
"21245650","21246390"," So you can see."
"21259430","21264410"," Yeah look at light sweet you see light sweet just what light sweet just got smashed down. "
"21265830","21270670"," Damn light sweet just got hammered."
"21270850","21273170"," It might be a time to buy like sweet this light sweet though."
"21281610","21283210"," Get some really weird like. "
"21287170","21289330"," It might be time to buy some light sweet."
"21289510","21293590"," So if you guys looking at oil as a by it's coming into known support."
"21294630","21296350"," Let me see here if I can show you guys. "
"21301410","21303050"," Some light sweet over here."
"21305330","21310510"," And that's coming into by by by and that's coming in right now."
"21310510","21313310"," You'll find out that 79 52 apparel. "
"21313310","21315110"," See if it holds right now."
"21317810","21319950"," Unlike sweet as you guys are bullish on light sweet."
"21320130","21321590"," So we'll find out if this holds or not. "
"21322170","21324470"," Wherever it continues to sell in the background."
"21332010","21333510"," I'll watch light sweet in the background."
"21344770","21346350"," You have friends down in East Palestine. "
"21346390","21346830"," Yeah."
"21347790","21348770"," It's a shit show down there."
"21349710","21350430"," It was not. "
"21350430","21351190"," I saw that."
"21351290","21353630"," They were banning people talking about it."
"21353890","21356970"," People are getting a shadow band about it. "
"21357490","21360290"," I saw the smoke plumes in Ohio and East Ohio."
"21362730","21364350"," And then they let it burn right."
"21364550","21366370"," They had big giant nasty clouds above. "
"21366970","21368670"," Did you see did you see that wildness?"
"21368930","21369450"," You see the chemical."
"21369690","21370590"," Yeah you saw the mushroom cloud."
"21373990","21374630"," Oh yeah. "
"21374810","21376010"," Evan knows that a bear plane is."
"21378570","21379330"," Yeah yeah."
"21380390","21381430"," Evan's looking for this one. "
"21381630","21382810"," Or Evan is looking for this."
"21382910","21384250"," So this is a bear plane right here."
"21385310","21386710"," Evan's talking about this right here. "
"21386750","21387590"," This is a bear plane."
"21387830","21388930"," He wants to see one more."
"21389150","21390430"," Evan wants to see this right here. "
"21390530","21390970"," I'll show you guys."
"21391110","21395770"," Evan's looking for Evan is looking for right here."
"21397970","21399690"," Evan is looking for this right here. "
"21401990","21405970"," One more plummet and then he's looking for this right here."
"21408760","21414960"," two, why does this thing not want to work for me, right there, Evan is looking for this cross right"
"21414960","21415180"," here."
"21417080","21421940"," And for price to come up here and get caught back down for a blood bath into the bell, grab"
"21421940","21423960"," that right Evan or wrong, something like that, right?"
"21424960","21425920"," Let me know if I'm wrong on that. "
"21433780","21435640"," Oh, dude, there are people left in that town."
"21436000","21440340"," There are people left in that town that were just in the town as all that talks, all those toxic"
"21440340","21442080"," fumes are just coming down on top of them, right?"
"21443780","21444580"," I didn't do that wrong."
"21445020","21447400"," I think, yeah, I think it's the, the white line comes up. "
"21447600","21450240"," One more, I'll think you guys will see it here in just a minute if it plays out."
"21455630","21459370"," They set light to apparently burn off the chemicals, they beat him and then arrested him."
"21459530","21461410"," Yeah, they beat up, they beat up a reporter, right?"
"21462250","21464670"," I remember reading that yesterday, they arrested a reporter. "
"21469100","21470800"," Do you guys ever see the movie The Crazies?"
"21473830","21475340"," The clothes under four, ten would be tremendous."
"21478260","21479780"," That is true, isn't it?"
"21481520","21482680"," Not happening though."
"21482760","21483860"," Don't be down on yourself, Nick. "
"21486560","21496160"," I think it's, so Detroit hasn't had this issue yet, but in Flint, Michigan, they introduced, you"
"21496160","21497480"," guys know the Flint story at all?"
"21498240","21500880"," I'm not from Michigan originally, but I went down the rabbit hole."
"21502080","21509200"," It's every house, every house that I've bought here in Detroit, I've taken all of the pipes to"
"21509200","21517220"," either the street or to the main connection to get rid of them."
"21517440","21522600"," In Flint, they introduced the new chemical to line the pipes and it had an inverse effect. "
"21522880","21530040"," It wound up corroding all the pipes to the lead, so the lead ended up corroding throughout the"
"21530040","21530780"," entire house, right?"
"21530980","21535360"," So every house in Detroit that I buy, I have to do all new pipes all the way to the"
"21535360","21537700"," street in case that happens here."
"21537860","21543720"," But telling you what, when you get those chemicals like that, even just drinking that shit, if you"
"21543720","21546240"," start drinking lead, man, you get problems, major ones."
"21547820","21555600"," And I'm assuming that if you're, if you've got kids, especially children, like children are super"
"21555600","21563300"," affected by chemicals like that, like big chemical fire burns, dust coming down from the, forget"
"21563300","21568360"," even light and that shit on fire, like anything, anything particles that it attaches to, if they're"
"21568360","21570460"," breathing that in, it's really bad. "
"21574360","21579840"," Yeah, that's what it was that Evan wasn't it, it was a calcium buildup that they removed, and it"
"21579840","21580880"," ended up removing the barrier."
"21585030","21587190"," White noise, I think I watched that one too."
"21592940","21598780"," Yeah, even, even with the, so we do pets and some people, some plumbers are still against plaques,"
"21599400","21600260"," are not plaques but pets. "
"21601460","21606000"," Plumbers will tell you that it's okay to leach copper into your water."
"21606220","21607140"," It's good for you, right?"
"21607300","21608540"," It's a mineral that you need."
"21609260","21612280"," And they're first still afraid of the PhDs or something. "
"21612560","21616460"," I think it's PhDs leaching into your supply."
"21616880","21618140"," So we do the RO filter."
"21619120","21622200"," They've got like the three, the three filters for anything that we consume. "
"21624540","21627640"," Oh, dude, here comes the bear, we get the bear plane or what?"
"21629260","21630840"," Are we getting the bear plane or what?"
"21633720","21635160"," Who mentioned the bear plane above?"
"21635980","21638540"," Well, I know one of you guys in here knows what this stuff is."
"21639200","21640860"," Only, I know one of you guys is in here."
"21641280","21642600"," Where, who is it that said that earlier?"
"21644720","21646140"," Who's a, where's he at?"
"21647120","21648420"," We gotta make him a moderator. "
"21653060","21654320"," It was it, was it you Evan?"
"21654760","21655260"," Oh, yeah."
"21655360","21659580"," Okay, so Evan, hold on, Evan, hold on one second."
"21659600","21661040"," We're gonna make you a moderator too. "
"21662060","21666300"," Because Evan knows what Evan and I talk here sometimes about this stuff and Evan knows what it is."
"21668990","21670150"," It is forming Evan."
"21670150","21670850"," I see it too. "
"21671910","21672810"," I see it Evan."
"21674750","21676010"," I see it on the five minute."
"21676690","21678650"," They're still buying short, going short right here. "
"21682260","21683880"," How much I think is don't bother me."
"21684580","21686120"," I see it on the five minute right now."
"21686660","21688760"," They're gonna roll this over there and try to roll it over right here. "
"21690020","21691700"," There's sellers in the background right now."
"21698630","21699930"," I see it on another screener."
"21704830","21713820"," They're trying right now in the background and watching it here. "
"21715740","21718300"," Man, they're trying so hard right now to sell it."
"21718620","21720760"," Hold on, I'm looking at a list of timeline here."
"21721760","21722980"," They're trying to start there. "
"21723100","21725040"," The bulls are starting to win Evan."
"21726520","21727520"," They're starting to win."
"21732360","21733400"," They're trying, man. "
"21738640","21739940"," See if they can get that blood."
"21744400","21746700"," They're just trying to sell us one last time right now."
"21752010","21756070"," See if we can see anything gaining, gaining enlightenment here on book maps. "
"21756350","21757510"," See if book map will help us out."
"21761310","21764110"," See if they can get that tag down below a 410-56."
"21764970","21766810"," It says 58 here, everything is 56. "
"21769830","21771730"," We're going to murder all the options in the close."
"21772270","21777790"," Here's the implied move here and we have another implied move down below it of 410-56."
"21779150","21780410"," I should write that down here. "
"21791230","21793090"," Yeah, I'd be pretty pissed off too."
"21793150","21801330"," If I lived in East Palestine, I'd be like does anybody know if they're offering people FEMA or"
"21801330","21803690"," anything or hotel vouchers, Red Cross?"
"21803910","21811630"," I know that sometimes they do offer people to flee and stay in hotels and stuff like that."
"21813110","21816410"," When there's a, did Red Cross show up or anything or no?"
"21817010","21818430"," Did the Red Cross show up to that?"
"21823290","21825190"," Yeah, then I thought that we get more downward. "
"21826330","21827090"," Miss who you're saying?"
"21827410","21830170"," The first move was two weeks for 1-5 Cross so I expected more."
"21830750","21831470"," Yeah, I did too."
"21831730","21837950"," I thought that, I thought well this move right here. "
"21839250","21845610"," This move right here, the bears lost the five minute down here."
"21846990","21848590"," The bears lost the five minute."
"21849730","21854310"," They're actually losing the five minute again right now so it's going to start squeezing. "
"21856150","21857070"," Five minutes rolling."
"21857230","21858510"," We could actually squeeze into the bell."
"21862250","21863150"," We'll know in 10 minutes man. "
"21863310","21864150"," 330 is almost here."
"21875700","21876760"," They gave the whole town."
"21876980","21877820"," No, the wait a minute. "
"21878280","21880280"," 25k for the whole town."
"21881000","21882200"," You got to be shitting me."
"21883900","21885000"," Are you serious than that?"
"21885140","21885740"," 25,000?"
"21891020","21896610"," Oh yeah man, it's going to be 25k doesn't do anything. "

"22076140","22077360"," Be careful of that happening. "
"22077360","22077660"," Okay."
"22078900","22085420"," Tomorrow where we squeeze up into like the open tomorrow and then they just they just rain hell on"
"22085420","22085580"," us."
"22087260","22091740"," Like let's say we squeeze the 420 and then we fucking just bloodbath it down from there. "
"22092840","22094380"," Like puts are cheap right now."
"22094400","22095400"," You guys see puts for tomorrow?"
"22096380","22098040"," Everybody's on the long side for tomorrow."
"22098940","22104100"," If you're long in tomorrow, make sure that you have uh you can hedge in uh blowback futures"
"22105900","22106340"," tomorrow. "
"22108600","22109540"," Make sure you have a head."
"22112220","22114840"," There's likely an automatic sell above at 420."
"22117840","22122220"," Make sure you can tee off into tomorrow's um open. "
"22138360","22139420"," Yeah, be super careful."
"22139720","22141100"," So just be careful of this."
"22142060","22144600"," There could be like an automatic sell at 420. "
"22145340","22147740"," You guys remember you guys remember December 13th?"
"22148200","22149740"," We we slammed into 416."
"22150580","22152160"," It was a bloodbath all day long."
"22152160","22152960"," Never never stopped. "
"22153560","22156000"," It was just like relentless selling all day long."
"22157700","22163760"," I don't like that we're call heavy in this close and puts are going to be cheap."
"22164060","22172200"," So you could see like a climb into 415 here um some stupid and crazy and then a gap up"
"22172200","22175020"," for like 70 points and then we start just rain and blood. "
"22177590","22178590"," Just be super careful."
"22178690","22180270"," Just the way the options market is set for tomorrow."
"22182540","22190710"," Uh you could torch all the calls um and then you might need to buy it. "
"22190750","22196830"," So I would say if you could be long into it maybe and then um make sure you're set make"
"22196830","22199210"," sure you have a known unknown and automatic short."
"22199810","22204600"," Uh definitely automatic short of 420, okay?"
"22205960","22206820"," Just a heads up."
"22209240","22210960"," Yeah, I'm gonna be flattened to this close. "
"22211340","22213980"," I don't like this um I don't like this close."
"22214620","22216000"," I don't like how lopsided."
"22216160","22217180"," Thanks for pointing that out Omar. "
"22217600","22219840"," I don't like how this this close is lopsided."
"22220700","22225060"," Like I want to see I want to see I want to see us put loaded on puts right here"
"22226880","22228820"," not loaded on calls into the close."
"22235260","22239630"," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
"22247780","22254960"," Uh no you so ugly so bears want all bears need to know is they need to get under 396"
"22254960","22262700"," like rain down price velocity on the downward side underneath 396 in the next three or four days."
"22262760","22263880"," That's what you have to do."
"22264020","22264500"," You don't have a choice. "
"22270500","22275960"," Yeah, I don't like um I don't fucking like being call heavy into this close at all."
"22277180","22282920"," The fact that the fact the market is call heavy in this close just screams that we hit the price"
"22283480","22285360"," and sell it before cash open."
"22288740","22293760"," I guess though I guess you could take calls into the close and then some puts and I would do"
"22293760","22299340"," a straddle here if anything uh or a strangle one of the other into this close would be the only"
"22299340","22300100"," way you could play this. "
"22300380","22302020"," I don't I'd be really wary of this."
"22306220","22307920"," Nobody's expecting red right now, man."
"22311260","22313260"," Uh everyone's expecting an update tomorrow. "
"22313520","22314180"," Do you guys see that?"
"22315100","22316740"," You guys can see it easily, right?"
"22317020","22318380"," You can just go right in the options stand and look."
"22319780","22322760"," You can just look at the premium built into the call side."
"22323540","22330660"," Well, you got calls for tomorrow or you got right now for tomorrow you on OI you've got uh 50 "
"22330660","22335040",",000 calls at 412 C cost three dollars and 42 cents. "
"22335460","22337540"," That's a zero date for open tomorrow."
"22338100","22340080"," Three dollars and 42 cents."
"22340960","22342540"," Get the F out of here. "
"22344060","22345160"," Do I get that wrong?"
"22346060","22346800"," Yeah, I get that right."
"22347420","22352820"," They're they're charging they're charging three dollars and 41 cents for a 412 C for tomorrow."
"22353380","22354920"," Y'all on this closing bell. "
"22356780","22358980"," You know what that you know what they call that a setup."
"22362860","22363900"," That's a setup."
"22367340","22371940"," To me well it's not a setup well on its worst it's a setup but it's best. "
"22372740","22377800"," It's a spend big money to prove to put your money where your mouth is if you're a bull."
"22378860","22380060"," That's a setup to me."
"22382260","22383020"," That's insane. "
"22384160","22391300"," Three dollars and 44 so so a 30 delta calls two dollars and 46 cents on a zero date on"
"22391300","22392040"," a zero date."
"22402620","22407280"," But as you know those calls right if those calls print you sell them at the bell."
"22409800","22417990"," If those calls print for all you sell right at the bell that's just begging. "
"22419430","22421470"," You're just like begging to get banged up."
"22423030","22427690"," So if you if you tell it dude when the ball comes off on that event."
"22429430","22433090"," You're trying to say that you're gonna you're trying to say that you're gonna have a call that"
"22433090","22438390"," costs you three dollars and 45 cents right now better be worth nine dollars or ten dollars and open"
"22438390","22439390"," tomorrow a zero date. "
"22445890","22446650"," That's insane."
"22447470","22448470"," I ain't playing that."
"22449150","22450350"," Get the fuck out of here. "
"22452770","22455550"," Just some confirmation from the energy department."
"22456370","22460710"," The US is to sell 26 million barrels of oil from no way to petroleum reserve."
"22462840","22464760"," No I'm looking at it on my broker. "
"22465140","22466220"," My broker's option chain."
"22468470","22469570"," I don't know man."
"22469950","22472990"," Early mark is on close imbalance five hundred and twenty eight million. "
"22473210","22474190"," I'll look at it."
"22474190","22475850"," I'll look at the clothes I've tested for you hold on."
"22520490","22526390"," The US implements a plan to refill the SPR including buybacks and exchange returns working with"
"22526390","22529310"," Congress to avoid sales unrelated to supply disruptions. "
"22543210","22549770"," Man that's that's a crazy if we can squeeze up here a big good to buy some puts for tomorrow."
"22550210","22552350"," I'm totally down for some puts if we can squeeze up here."
"22552790","22553590"," I'm totally down. "
"22554310","22558510"," So um there's like a here let me see if I can tell you guys this."
"22558630","22560470"," So let me explain the point to you."
"22561010","22566740"," You'd have like a let me close this down here. "
"22571990","22574330"," And like for at least for cash market."
"22577560","22578640"," At least for coming."
"22578800","22581120"," This looks like it's going to be explosive on the high here. "
"22581860","22583180"," Bulls are winning the hourly."
"22583520","22586380"," Bulls are winning the five."
"22586760","22587440"," They're winning the monthly. "
"22588000","22589240"," All these things they're winning."
"22590140","22591720"," So this looks very bullish into the close."
"22592140","22593260"," I'm not going to lie to this looks bullish. "
"22596100","22597420"," But where is this?"
"22599040","22600580"," December 12th 16th right here."
"22601040","22602320"," So I'm going to say this right here."
"22602780","22604140"," I'm going to mute my stuff here. "
"22605420","22606900"," This is what I'm talking to you guys about."
"22608600","22609980"," Is let me see it again."
"22612100","22620440"," You get some kind of like a you see up here this kind of shit right up here. "
"22627320","22629040"," There's kind of a setup here right."
"22629300","22632060"," It's kind of like this is the spot."
"22632340","22639160"," So if we green bar straight north you better like if we green bar this up tomorrow. "
"22640160","22642840"," You would have like an automatic short here."
"22643800","22646000"," And if you're a bear and you trade globex."
"22648400","22650300"," Fucking right there it is. "
"22650560","22654140"," You have four dollar calls going on this close for tomorrow."
"22654140","22657520"," So if we green bar it up like this kind of nonsense before you open the market."
"22658020","22660940"," They're going to rip this thing straight down on your face. "
"22663100","22664740"," So you have to be able to hedge."
"22665260","22668460"," You have no choice if you're long calls into tomorrow."
"22669040","22670940"," You really kind of put you in a pickle here. "
"22672760","22674540"," I see that I see the trade higher."
"22675280","22678940"," But if that happens this could be a repeat of back here."
"22679580","22683840"," So just keep your if you got any guys that remember December 12th 13th. "
"22685400","22686660"," If you don't remember it."

"22691080","22692320"," This was 915. "
"22693200","22694880"," This was 915 in the morning."
"22696060","22700720"," Like all these bulls are just pumped pumped and we just blasted."

"22712460","22714480"," That would put us. "
"22717640","22720080"," That would put us what."
"22721840","22729540"," That would be a drop from 420 down to 409.97. 409.97 by one o'clock in the afternoon"

"23518310","23526170"," think i think it was the december twelve um cpi report uh came in great we we blasted higher by"
"23526170","23531990"," nine fifteen we were selling so if we do blast the four twenty i would say to you expect an"
"23531990","23539290"," automatic sell in the market if you can trade blowbacks to hedge your position um be able to the"
"23539290","23545150"," other thing is call that we're we're loaded to the tips on calls right now so the next question"
"23545150","23548930"," would be if i buy a three dollar four dollar call in the money zero date for tomorrow do they"
"23548930","23553670"," pay nine dollars do they pay two hundred percent three hundred percent uh that's a pretty big rip"
