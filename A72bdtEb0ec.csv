"269810","277590"," coming on down to tap into s2 We've got s3 down below here at four sixty nine fifty seven ish"
"277590","283910"," somewhere down in this zone right here The key point for you though is the gamma flip is this is"
"283910","288970"," the one that I want you to pay attention to here Okay, the gamma flip is up high here at"
"288970","296810"," four seventy four seventy three forty two somewhere up in here and Keep track of this hourly and"
"296810","298450"," half hour trigger."
"299030","305650"," Okay, so we're gonna switch over really quick To the trigger screen here my dude my camera to so I"
"305650","311870"," think my cat was in my office or something my camera is knocked off the desk It's all stupid."
"312090","317630"," So give me one quick second here Turn that off and that off so you can take a look at"
"317630","317890"," everything. "
"318050","322290"," Okay, so This is a one-minute chart."
"322510","323270"," We're gonna get up first."
"323410","329030"," I want to scroll out a little bit here And just take a quick breather here, right?"
"329650","338330"," Just take a look at the market here and Kind of come back in line with this is what this"
"338330","343170"," is there's a couple of things I want you to be aware of here, okay, so just some market awareness"
"343170","352700"," stuff Now if you're gonna be out there talking to an Elliott waver All right, you see that that"
"352700","361500"," nice little clean little Be wave right there come up come down come up and we're jumping back in"
"361500","362740"," line right now, right?"
"363740","373500"," now This daily trigger right here If we get that bounce down there, right We don't continue to"
"373500","381380"," reject off of the the gamma flip if we do not we regain that gamma flip down there Maybe careful"
"381380","383380"," of a V shape recovery in here. "
"383960","392880"," Excuse me V shape recovery in here now your local bear out there is going to be looking for the"
"392880","399360"," rejection on that gamma flip right here For continued downside over here."
"399520","402120"," Okay, so just be aware of that right there."
"402220","406680"," There's a trap for bulls Right up in here. "
"406920","414020"," Okay now When I was talking to Joe donut about was a reset, right?"
"415160","421780"," So you remember we top take this up here like way up there top ticked it and This train is"
"421780","423160"," now dead in my view."
"423360","431320"," Okay as we come down here, and I'm gonna be looking for a second leg to this trade For more"
"431320","435040"," downside now do we get all the way down here?"
"435400","442220"," It's to be it's to be determined Once we reject the gamma flip here So if you're if you didn't"
"442220","447080"," take any of this leg right here You're waiting you could probably jump in a little bit more if you"
"447080","454380"," wanted to but you're looking for a reset up here For this next leg to the downside now if price"
"454380","458460"," recovers above the gamma flip We'll talk about that for more upside to come."
"458780","466820"," I'm going to show you at some point The seasonality calendar says that this next leg down is not"
"466820","473420"," don't expect as much on this leg That you might be expecting but we don't always trade exactly what"
"473420","479120"," the flip is or the seasonality is so This is still the door is still open for all this to"
"479120","480000"," happen down here. "
"480300","483560"," Where's where's the expectation for that trade?"
"484460","493640"," We're talking about about for 60 down here for 60 The really sketchy part in here too is that gamma"
"493640","502400"," flip is still looming So if we do continue to the downside down here We bounced start to wake our"
"502400","509680"," way higher Are we developing more levels for put gamma bear gamma down here right negative gamma"
"509680","510940"," being developed down here?"
"511240","515039"," If they don't develop any gamma down here, we should be able to come right back up again regain"
"515039","524260"," that Regain that gamma flip and get back to positive again, and I really do believe that We do"
"524260","526440"," I am not on the bear trade."
"526600","532180"," Well, I'm on the bear trade, but not like a lot of you are I'm on the trade of a"
"532180","539620"," recovery at some point where I blast down here come back up and whatever this is Is either going to"
"539620","542280"," reverse up here or it's going to reverse down here."
"542500","550100"," So Personally, that would be tempering Your expectations to the downside and do not forget that you"
"550100","555460"," still have earning season Okay, so you might be wanting this crash and all this kind of stuff not"
"555460","562740"," this but a like a bloodbath crash And that likely will not Happen in my viewpoint now. "
"562820","567640"," I'm going to show you why that is here in just a minute For that reversal to the upside to"
"567640","573960"," take place But truly for myself what I am looking for is something more like this Where you come"
"573960","579160"," back down here touch that daily trigger You're going to get a revert or a rejection on this gamma"
"579160","585660"," flip and then it's going to be like walk the plank of some kind Uh for earning season in here."
"585800","590820"," Okay, it's not going to be as bloody or as brutal as you might think that it is It's just"
"590820","595860"," being patient with it Note also that if you miss this trade like you're going to get another chance"
"595860","600520"," to catch catch that trade one more Time and we're going to take a look at the seasonality calendar"
"600520","606040"," this morning to show it to you Uh the expectations and that kind of stuff and remember don't fuck"
"606040","609900"," that don't fuck with the daily trigger Just that that is there."
"610120","614640"," This is a real support in here I don't you can see we bounced right down here back here. "
"614800","617400"," You don't want to be that bear down here Do you right?"
"617700","617780"," Yeah?"
"618060","618060"," Yeah?"
"618300","618300"," Yeah?"

"620780","622640"," Oh my shits on fire Oh, god. "
"622800","625100"," I'm all fucked up over here You know what I'm saying?"
"625240","631400"," So you got to respect that to some extent Now there are a series of lower highs on the daily"
"631400","634160"," trigger On a on a 30-minute basis."
"634160","641080"," I want to show you that really quick Right, we did bounce right here Right and be you know right"
"641080","641360"," here."
"641520","646920"," You're like we were still positive gamma on that daily velocity So i'm going to give it to the"
"646920","652580"," bulls to some extent Uh that we should bounce off that daily trigger, you know, even if we break"
"652580","660240"," here i want to show you this here You know one two we're still bouncing up still bouncing up Uh"
"660240","669180"," you really want if you're really that bearish If you're really truly that bearish Right, you end up"
"669180","675820"," watching this you know watching this bounce up right you get the confirmation And let's say we"
"675820","680960"," start coming back down underneath the daily trigger You want to remember that you're taking profit"
"680960","688080"," here and then you are Waiting for the rejection to enter the second or third stage of that trade We"
"688080","695960"," got you know stage one right Reset stage two Right and then look for the rejection then you have"
"695960","703320"," stage three so one two and three Not just all willy nilly blind like because if you get reversed"
"703320","705900"," here You get fucked you get reversed here. "
"706140","714000"," You get fucked so take a one stage at a time uh Uh as steady as she goes, I should"
"714000","721600"," say On this downward move how deep it goes and be tactful in your trading when it comes to this"
"721600","727220"," stuff Okay, i'm going to give you a quick um, i'm going to leave this up quickly here for you"
"728040","732420"," You want to take a snap of this i don't know if this helps at all for you at home"

"739880","745400"," take a peek at that snipping for yourself and holding that kind of stuff right there, okay Now in a"
"745400","750660"," smaller uh time frame smaller time frame smaller basis that kind of stuff in a one-minute chart"
"750660","759300"," here We'll head back over here so you can see this Get some context right You got s2 here."
"759320","767080"," Let me let me get this the spin up here for a minute You got your s3 down here, right?"

"779720","780500"," something like that."
"780640","788640"," I'd really like to see or I'd really like to see continued blood here We just keep blasting through"
"788640","793800"," get underneath right a little bit more rejection here boom And then it that this is my favorite one"
"793800","799480"," right here come back up into that gamma flip and just confirm Uh that we're going to continue to"
"799480","806020"," head higher here, okay and start blasting down this way over here Makes sense get your get your uh"
"806620","811360"," Well your s3 And then back up in here over the weekend and then we start to begin to roll"

"920740","926240"," Okay, so there's a gamma flip So right there this whole line right here and then this line down"
"926240","932980"," here So we could even break slightly lower than this this uh spy that's written right here today,"
"932980","935220"," okay Uh, what else we got here?"

"1014190","1016670"," How or how does that translate into over here?"
"1017210","1026430"," We're going to go back to the uh main screen here and that is implying here let me see This"
"1026430","1039260"," is today is Wednesday right at 1600 And"
"1039260","1045339"," these don't always follow exact but this is the end of today So you'd be looking for some kind of"
"1045339","1054620"," more continuation of blood down here Right and then a pump up into friday Right whoop right up in"
"1054620","1054780"," here."
"1054780","1063060"," There's a gamma flip and There's your next leg down Uh some at some point into friday And then into"
"1063060","1069460"," early or mid next week more blood to come just be aware of that These don't always line up exactly"
"1069460","1076660"," there can be over like an over push to the downside But then then some kind of recovery and then"
"1076660","1086400"," down into the middle of next week Once we get into that middle of next week though So Whatever"
"1086400","1093660"," that blood is this is where the tempering comes in of expectations right You're all bared up when"
"1093660","1099720"," you should be looking for another entry to get super bared up We come back down right you're back"
"1099720","1107000"," on that second trade But then the real uh freaky thing is that at some point into next week We're"
"1107000","1114480"," going to expect a run up here Uh for the real true correction That comes into play for march So"
"1114480","1122020"," this is all like you got one more one more bump one more little bump More down right Big big"
"1122020","1127840"," you remember this is where the high is right 4,800 So you're looking at a big push up higher"
"1127840","1134280"," a big squeeze and then the blood to follow Uh into mid march over here."
"1134320","1140980"," Okay, so be ready to be be quick in here And don't come back if we have this big giant"
"1140980","1148920"," squeeze So sometime next week if we start ripping faces off to the upside You know, don't be coming"
"1148920","1154420"," back here and being like, you know, no one told me someone told me cap was both our bearish Or"
"1154420","1162840"," whatever so be quick be aware of this pump and dump Right confirmation of more lows to come and"
"1162840","1170720"," then a dip to buy uh to the upside for uh one last spring Uh push to the upside up"
"1170720","1172080"," here, you know, this is pretty big here. "
"1172360","1177980"," So don't get caught in this stuff Okay, this one specifically a specific year of bear This will"
"1177980","1179240"," wreck your day right here."
"1179340","1187340"," This whole move Uh right here starts on I believe the 15th trading day of the year No, no, sorry"
"1187340","1194720"," get that wrong the 19th trading day of the year right here Uh, this gets pretty nasty to the upside"
"1195260","1201880"," Uh, so just be just be aware of the 19th trading day of trading session of the year of some"
"1201880","1206140"," kind of a uh pump Uh to the upside Be careful."
"1206340","1206920"," Okay, please. "
"1207260","1207400"," Please."
"1207620","1213380"," Please you know, this could be like tech Ears probably some something something like that's coming"
"1213380","1219960"," around and then you you get torn up as we squeeze up here Let's be aware of it."
"1220080","1220280"," Please. "
"1220940","1226910"," Okay Exactly estimates are dropped."
"1227030","1232130"," Everyone gets prep participation trophy and other and you know another who's just said that bull"
"1232130","1232590"," for trading."
"1232590","1240090"," Okay So I want you to also think about this too Let's go back to um cap screen here, right?"
"1240490","1246690"," So think about something else here too, right I You get that last little bump earnings come in"
"1246690","1253570"," looking like shit or we're just monetizing earnings season Expectations get lowered and you're all"
"1253570","1257930"," bared up down here And you're like, yeah, we're getting a market crash, right?"
"1258590","1259830"," And it's corrective in nature. "
"1260110","1263010"," It's pretty nasty, but at the same time, right?"
"1263290","1265030"," Even though this is pretty nasty right here."
"1265430","1269690"," They buy the fucking dip You know, you don't want to get caught in this either for the rest of"
"1269690","1277910"," the year So if you're a bear out there right if you're a bear like a real true bear Remember"
"1277910","1285830"," what I talked to you about Uh with unemployment inflation the velocity or the speed of inflation"
"1285830","1292010"," coming down at two percent And then rates cuts when that takes place and we get that corrective"
"1292010","1302090"," action in the marketplace uh be wary of the uh Be wary of the coolade you're drinking Uh"
"1302090","1311530"," remember that we will likely stay corrective and not crash Uh without those thing those other macro"
"1311530","1312890"," things taking place."
"1312890","1320650"," Okay So whenever that roll down is that that correction that we get For that springtime roll if you"

"2098040","2099460"," that gonna mean for these companies?"
"2099760","2103680"," That's the key question because they've been such beneficiaries in a lower interest rate"
"2103680","2109480"," environment It's clients saw new ways to generate alpha And so they were pursuing asset management"
"2109480","2114020"," and wealth management and the sound advice of professionals and so that had been a boon to their"

"2121300","2123000"," their favor and in a meaningful way. "
"2123180","2128020"," I think is the key question But there's also more competition that's arisen Over the last year that"
"2128020","2129120"," they're contending with as well."
"2129440","2135520"," So there are a whole host of factors that are playing a role here But you know the gross numbers"

"2182920","2183160"," reckoning."
"2183440","2188700"," I'm not looking for a reckoning in markets in 2024 You'd have to see a real exogenous event dev"
"2188700","2193860"," something like that Jamie diamond didn't sound quite as now by the way That was not the most"
"2193860","2198480"," positive of his comments that we just used there from Solomon because he was constructive He was as"
"2198480","2199720"," well in the conference call yesterday. "
"2200160","2201680"," Also wasn't he on the golden earnings call?"
"2201860","2208380"," Yeah, kind of a similar tone this idea that you know, we think things are fine Uh barring some kind"

"2213400","2220080"," going on with monetary policy But broadly speaking, they believe it's going to be a better year,"
"2220080","2226880"," especially as it as it pertains to investment banking And that backlog dying to know, you know,"
"2226960","2232980"," he's still pretty cautious and he he may no longer be hurricane Jamie, but he's still like tropical"

"2238040","2241320"," as hunky dory Perhaps as the markets would reflect."
"2241700","2245320"," He also had some comments I thought Leslie that we're interesting about commercial real estate Yes,"
"2245320","2249760"," that continues to be a key question this year We talked about it often of course The question is"
"2249760","2252260"," how large a portion is it of so many bank balance sheets?"
"2252540","2256780"," What are the write downs really going to look like over what period of time can you take them?"
"2257400","2261240"," Uh, take a listen to what diamond had to say in terms of the risk of commercial real estate to"
"2261240","2267740"," bank balance If we have a soft landing which is possible and race don't go higher, which is"
"2267740","2272960"," possible It'll be a small problem If we have a hard landing and race don't go higher be a bigger"
"2272960","2277020"," problem And if we have a hard land with higher rates, which I still think is possible, it'll be a"
"2277020","2283580"," bigger problem Because that's also goes up Interest rates are like Cosmological constant anything"
"2283580","2288960"," which has cash flows is worth less And obviously there's a recession less need for space and all"
"2288960","2295600"," the things that happen to recession stuff like that It's It's interesting because you know we hear"
"2295600","2300580"," his list of risks that he sees out there and there's geopolitics There's quantitative tightening"
"2300580","2304060"," there's monetary policy and the latest fed move."
"2304180","2309840"," We don't always hear about CRE from Jamie So I think those comments are really prescient Um as we"
"2309840","2315060"," kind of assess You know, what truly is the the potential canary in the coal mine as we look ahead"
"2315060","2320620"," to 2024 if there is one at all We'll see stocks are under some pressure this morning Ironically"
"2320620","2325380"," because of the strong retail sales number major averages on track to snap a two-month win streak"

"2352600","2353100"," I think so. "
"2353380","2359480"," We've been projecting that the fed It would be later and fewer is the mantra We've been saying that"
"2359480","2364900"," essentially the fed would start to cut interest rates in may of this year And then actually cut by"
"2364900","2372260"," 25 basis points in each of the final three quarters of this year So certainly a later start to the"
"2372260","2378260"," fed rate cutting program And fewer cuts than what the street is expecting right now Which in my"
"2378260","2383860"," opinion is a good sign because it means that we are headed for a soft landing If we did indeed"
"2383860","2390620"," get rate cuts to start sooner and to have more aggressive rate cutting cutting schedule I think"
"2390620","2398520"," that would imply that there are real problems with the economy I sort of also adds to Just heads up"

"2425250","2431170"," the fed will be Cutting rates a little later, but that's pretty much what we have been embracing"
"2431170","2439590"," for a while To see tensions ratchet higher in the middle east How concerned are you that that could"
"2439590","2442690"," kind of bring back inflation in a meaningful way?"
"2443310","2449570"," Well, that certainly is a wildcard Leslie when we look at oil price forecasts for all of 2024 Our"
"2449570","2456670"," expectations is we're going to be moving back toward the mid $80 per barrel area So certainly a lot"
"2456670","2462930"," of weakness that we have seen so far with oil prices and Quite frankly, we're scratching our heads"
"2462930","2469150"," wondering if the oil price decline is really a forecast of what global economic trends are likely"
"2469150","2476030"," to be Um, but our feeling again is that while germany has missed a recession that we could end up"

"2767110","2774650"," I'm looking at a six versus a versus Nvidia And the gains are almost well 30 versus 19. "
"2774870","2776450"," What do you think's happening with AMD right now?"
"2776810","2782810"," Yeah, look so people are looking for other ways to play AI besides Nvidia Part of the worry that"
"2782810","2787550"," people have had and the reason the stock actually is cheap Given where the earnings have gone is"
"2787550","2793330"," the numbers have gotten so big so quickly The people just worry about sustainability and like"
"2793330","2798930"," they're they're they're looking for other ways to play it and AMD at least to their credit Has a"
"2798930","2802190"," roadmap that seems reasonably credible with products on it."
"2802190","2807550"," Um, and they did something very smart Um, they put out some targets for their AI revenues."
"2807830","2811250"," They said we'll do more than two billion two billions a very small number They left room"
"2811250","2817290"," potentially To take those expectations up Ideally as we go through the year and so I think people"
"2817290","2821030"," have been getting more bullish As they get more bullish on the overall size of the general"
"2821030","2826310"," opportunity itself and then AMD's like prospects potentially within that Um, and people have been"
"2826310","2828270"," buying the stock on on that especially as we go. "
"2828270","2833050"," Um, as we get into into this year and People are waiting to actually see it now show up in"
"2833050","2834890"," the numbers In the report earnings in a couple of weeks."
"2835050","2842290"," We'll see it now is that to say that others are closing the gap with Nvidia itself I don't actually"
"2842290","2850210"," think so so look To take the AMD point of view of member it's If they give two billion or"
"2850210","2855510"," three billion or five billion or whatever the numbers It's actually a rounding error like relative"
"2855510","2861410"," to the size of the opportunity like like if an idiot does 60 billion This year that will be viewed"
"2861410","2870450"," as enormously disappointing And so There's always room potentially for a second source, right?"
"2870690","2875950"," And I think this is Where the AMD story has gotten some legs is they don't need to get 60"
"2875950","2877030"," billion, right?"
"2877210","2883270"," You figure if the opportunity like this year was was 100 billion and they got 10 percent or 5"
"2883270","2888910"," percent for AMD Maybe that's enough Now we could have a longer conversation on the rest of AMD's"
"2888910","2894050"," business I actually do worry A little bit that the rest of the business that expectations may be"
"2894050","2898590"," too high but that was true all last year as well and again the AI kind of narrative sort of"
"2898590","2905650"," painted over all of that and As people can continue to get excited about that opportunity for them"
"2905650","2910370"," And if they can keep to take take those expectations up on the AI Maybe people will pass like any"
"2910370","2913150"," potential issues in the rest of the business That's clearly what's been happening over the last"
"2913150","2921050"," several four days for them anyway In terms of your price target of $700 for Nvidia, uh, you know,"
"2921110","2927290"," that stock tripled last year Your price target implies about a 24 percent upside 23 percent based"
"2927290","2932690"," on today's levels What supports that really on a fundamental fundamental basis in terms of, you"
"2932690","2940670"," know, your forecast, uh, of their exposure into the AI space Well, remember AI is almost all of"
"2940670","2941510"," their revenues, right?"
"2941710","2948310"," Like data center for Nvidia's Ballpark 80 percent of their revenues now almost nothing else than"
"2948310","2954130"," Nvidia gaming, Naruto It almost doesn't matter Like from for the fundamentals of company."

"2959170","2962790"," you talk about the stock tripling look how much the earnings went up The earnings went up. "
"2962890","2968050"," I know six or seven times or whatever whatever the number is Because of the size of the opportunity"
"2968050","2972070"," their competitive positioning within that opportunity their product roadmap and everything else and"
"2972570","2978050"," As we look into this year, I think not only is is AI and and everything going mainstream But their"

"2994330","2996290"," in the second off My guess is pricing goes up there again."
"2996570","3001970"," I still think numbers have room to go up And as I said earlier The stock itself has got up"
"3001970","3006010"," a lot but much less so than the earnings the multiples come down What if he's actually they if you"
"3006010","3011290"," believe it the cheapest or one of the cheapest ways to play the AI theme In the space AI Is"

"3059050","3065270"," It's called hopper or the main product is called the h100 Um the pricing for that is probably two"

"4432090","4437610"," deflation or flat prices That number is a good number when it comes to wheel sales and you can see"
"4437610","4444170"," it's just above the 10 year pre pandemic average So back to normal their jackclinans the economist"
"4444170","4449790"," for the For the nrf says consumer spending was remarkably resilient through about 2023 Finished"
"4449790","4455930"," here with a solid pace for the holiday season guys as you know This number today is upsetting"
"4455930","4460910"," markets when it comes to the outlook for the fed because it's strong And this is going to cause"
"4460910","4466890"," economists to upgrade their fourth quarter forecast as well as by the way the first quarter So this"
"4466890","4471930"," number has put the fed in flux and the outlook for the economy in flux But in a good way"
"4471930","4478370"," towards the upside Leslie Good news is still bad news and bad news is still good news and um, it"
"4478370","4482990"," is reflective as well Of what we heard from the banking ceos throughout earnings season that the"
"4482990","4489330"," consumer still remains pretty Healthy and is is spending uh, you know, at least back to kind of pre"
"4489330","4493850"," pandemic levels, but uh, you know still still pretty strong All things considered steve."
"4493970","4498630"," Thanks for bringing that to us Uh, and as I mentioned another big day for the bangs with results"
"4498630","4503750"," out of schwaub citizens financial and more this morning The latter name reporting a fourth quarter"
"4503750","4510370"," profit declined with net income dropping 71 percent from a year earlier To 189 million for the"
"4510370","4516090"," quarter of the Lot of that was due to some special items in the quarter Breakdown those numbers in"
"4516090","4520710"," a cnbc exclusive citizens financial group chairman and ceo bruce van san bruce. "
"4520810","4525470"," Thanks for being here Um, so as I mentioned, there's a lot of noises quarter in terms of profit."
"4525470","4530210"," So I want to I want to focus First on nii net interest income."
"4530550","4534310"," That's the profitability metric from loanmaking You gave some guidance there. "
"4534490","4540710"," You're expecting declines up to nine percent for the full year 2024 Do you see a troughing this"
"4540710","4544090"," year if we get six rate cuts as the swaps market is predicting?"
"4544830","4551070"," Yeah, so um, I would say one thing that's very positive in the fourth quarter is that we're"
"4551070","4553510"," starting to see less pressure on our funding costs."
"4553630","4559410"," So uh, as the fed raised rates, very aggressively Uh, funding costs went up the bank failures"
"4559410","4565770"," didn't help that Uh, but our net interest income was down four percent sequentially in q3 is only"
"4565770","4571570"," down two percent Uh in the fourth quarter and then uh, it's kind of next year We have the full"
"4571570","4577610"," year effect of some of the things that have happened in 23 But we see an inflection point actually"
"4578310","4583490"," Halfway through the year that we should start to see uh net interest income tick up We expect"
"4583490","4589230"," economic activity to pick up and therefore loan growth will tick up So I think a couple more"
"4589230","4593290"," quarters of hanging in there and then things should start to brighten in the second half of the"
"4593290","4599350"," year Can you help explain that to our audience a bit because for much of 2023 rising interest rates"
"4599350","4605910"," was a It was a tailwind for net interest income It was supportive because banks were able to lend"
"4605910","4611550"," out at higher rates And they weren't quite needing to pay up for those deposit costs at least in"
"4611550","4617070"," the first half of the year as much uh known as deposit betas When I look ahead to next year"
"4617530","4621990"," Um, at least if you kind of go with what the swaps market is indicating by the middle of the"
"4621990","4627210"," year that would indicate We start to kind of reverse that and see some uh lower interest rates So"
"4627210","4633750"," how does that provide a tailwind to NII in terms of its ability to uh drop at least in the"
"4633750","4633970"," middle of the year?"
"4633970","4639470"," A little complicated so I'll try to keep it simple, but when rates are going up in the beginning Uh"
"4639470","4645290"," banks are what's called acid sensitive because their loans are priced Repricing instantaneously and"
"4645290","4651570"," and banks can lag their deposit Repricing as you get farther into the cycle once the fed stopped in"
"4651570","4656790"," july Your loans aren't repricing anymore, but there's still Increasing pressure on your deposit"
"4656790","4664370"," costs, so that will continue to impact the first half of the year kind of once uh rates go down"
"4664370","4672050"," we have certain swap positions on that Uh are costing us money today will cost us less as rates go"
"4672050","4678850"," down Uh and then volume kicking in having loan growth going up That's the other factor in terms of"
"4678850","4685070"," determinate for your net interest income So a little bit will benefit uh you know from the swap"
"4685070","4691130"," drag going down But then the volume kicks in in the second half of the year Right that makes sense"
"4691130","4696950"," um speaking of you know the asset side of your business credit quality You set aside more in"
"4696950","4701830"," provisions during the quarter You said on the call this morning that CRE general office is being"
"4701830","4707630"," carefully managed Losses are being absorbed in net charge offs with few surprises so far But with"
"4707630","4713410"," record real estate debt set to come do this year I have to wonder given that we're still in a"
"4713410","4719790"," relatively high interest rate environment What are your expectations for for defaults, uh, you know"
"4719790","4721850"," across the sector and specifically for citizens?"
"4722550","4730170"," Yeah, so uh, I would say if you look broadly across all of our lending portfolios Feel really good"
"4730170","4736290"," about the consumer portfolios We tend to lend to the more affluent customers and they're still in"
"4736290","4742390"," really good shape Uh feel really good about commercial lending Most companies navigated the"
"4742390","4742930"," pandemic."
"4742930","4744850"," Well, uh, they had good years. "
"4744970","4750870"," They're positioned Uh, I think they're cautious for next year, but they're positioned Uh to to be"
"4750870","4755730"," successful and we won't have a lot of charge offs there It's really as you say commercial real"
"4755730","4762790"," estate that's been Uh, the main focal point, uh, in terms of potential losses and it's a subset of"
"4762790","4768750"," commercial real estate because broadly Uh, other areas multi family and, uh, industrial"
"4768750","4771730"," distribution space Uh, that's doing fine."
"4771750","4779370"," It's the office and these return to office trends Uh, that have really turned that market, uh, kind"
"4779370","4786050"," of upside down in terms of, uh, not having the best dynamics The good news is we, uh, can see"
"4786050","4790850"," what's happening in those portfolios We can see when maturities are coming due We have a lot of"
"4790850","4795790"," great workout people in the bank who are working with those borrowers to try to figure out Uh, how"
"4795790","4800430"," to come up with solutions where we might take a charge off the the borrower may put in some"
"4800430","4806990"," additional money Uh, they live to see another day, uh, and so that's been a process that we've"
"4806990","4811190"," basically managed through in 23 We're going to continue to manage it through in 24."
"4811450","4817910"," I actually think it'll extend into 25 Rates coming down will help that a little bit, but, uh, my"
"4817910","4820690"," plea to people watching is get back to the office. "
"4820890","4829190"," It would really First for real estate sector Well, uh, that is a good message."
"4829250","4832890"," Uh, we're we're here in the office So we're we're helping the cause a little bit today."

"5731550","5735790"," We were worried about more tightening more tightening more tightening less easing is so much"
"5735790","5740450"," different than more Tightening for me as an asset allocator because I need fixed income."
"5740930","5747270"," I need fixed income to protect me So I don't think the higher rate Inflation recession story is"
"5747270","5751190"," what we should be worried about anymore Which leads us to believe that we should be avoid equity in"
"5751190","5755490"," our highest over weight since before the fed started in March So then given the gap between what"
"5755490","5758610"," the market is pricing in and what your expectation is how are you allocating?"
"5759190","5761470"," Uh, and where do you see value given that prognosis?"
"5761470","5765650"," Yeah, so first of all we believe that the 10-year note should be on the north side of 4 "
"5765650","5771370","% not the south side of 4% So we don't have as much kind of government bond exposure in"
"5771370","5774070"," our portfolio We like credit more Leslie. "
"5774470","5780170"," So credit is just like an equity proxy within fixed income And at the end of the day no recession"
"5780170","5785470"," and with the next move from the fed likely being in ease That's a really nice story for equity."
"5785970","5791910"," However, the consolidation that's taking place now because There was so much easing priced in is"
"5791910","5797870"," normal, but the signal is soft landing next move likely in ease That's really good for risk assets"
"5797870","5804010"," that 20% calculation in terms of a recession probability for this year How does that shift based on"
"5804010","5808130"," whether the fed cuts more whether it cuts less than you're expecting?"
"5808350","5811610"," Yeah, so the canary and the coal mine for us is the labor market the thing that we're looking at"
"5811610","5816690"," the most is Our initial jobless claims staying at or around 200,000 is the unemployment rate"
"5816690","5822390"," staying at or around 4% So Leslie that number will go up based on the labor market."
"5822390","5827310"," That's what we're looking at wholeheartedly Every year there's a 15% chance of recession never"
"5827310","5831790"," assign zero probability to any event So we're slightly a slightly above where we are in a normal"
"5831790","5836890"," environment But we're positioned for a no recession environment and that the fed did their last"
"5836890","5842610"," hike in july of last year Those are the two risks that we are not positioned for recession or the"
"5842610","5845970"," fed having having to hike And that's why we're avoid equity right now. "
"5846170","5847630"," How about the idea of market breadth?"
"5847850","5850390"," Would you rather have the spx or the equal weight?"
"5850630","5856370"," Yeah, good question So it's so hard to say we don't want to have a cap weighted s&p exposure"
"5856370","5862010"," based on what happened last year But this is the widest coral that the multiple Valuation"
"5862010","5867230"," difference has been between cap weighted around 19 times equal weighted at around 16 times So that"
"5867230","5872990"," three multiple difference is the widest in a decade and those companies We're worried about"
"5872990","5878510"," inflation rates and recession So if those companies don't have to worry about inflation rates and"
"5878510","5884390"," recession We should close the gap between the 16 and the 19 times So we are expecting a wider"
"5884390","5889770"," breadth So so this year finally I saw a japan on the list as well Even with the new k"
"5889770","5895170"," at 34 or three decade highs Yeah, and outperforming the s&p last year on the leader who knew right"
"5895170","5899850"," so a couple of things embedded in there They have good inflation Good inflation means very low"

"6368320","6372540"," with the rules say that the capital requirements will be And the banks themselves say hey, this is"
"6372540","6377700"," actually a lot higher more like a 30 percent hike to capital Whereas the regulators have said it's"

"6485240","6491040"," Yeah, I think one of the things that's really hard for Analysts that are less familiar with our"
"6491040","6496940"," company to understand is we run a Incentive plan here that's different than every bank I know"
"6496940","6503280"," Specifically 100 percent of the salary based based associates are included in that incentive plan"
"6503980","6511120"," and And so when we give guidance We include that incentive payout the way that incentive gets paid"
"6511120","6519300"," is based on us hitting revenue targets and EPS targets otherwise the incentive Expenses reduced to"
"6519300","6524620"," bring earnings in line and so Honestly, it seems like every year as we come out of the gates we"
"6524620","6529620"," give the expense guidance People will take and include 100 percent of a targeted incentive payout"
"6529620","6536240"," They may account for less revenue growth and so it it's sometimes confusing people But generally we"
"6536240","6542180"," we prevail over the first quarter or two to get people to understand how that plan works Is it"
"6542180","6545660"," possible to generate positive operating leverage given kind of that dynamic?"
"6546540","6554940"," Yes Again, there's The the plan would be to have positive operating leverage to grow EPS in an"
"6554940","6559400"," industry where I think peers are projected not to grow EPS It's our belief."
"6559620","6560940"," We will grow EPS."
"6561540","6568060"," I think again One of the dynamics there lastly is just to illustrate how it works 2023 is a"
"6568060","6575740"," difficult year for banks We reduced our incentives By 38 percent this year and so that ends up"
"6575740","6581540"," being harvested into the earning stream of the company And so some and we hit our targets next year"
"6582140","6587940"," And you pay it 100 percent you have to get that lift from 62 percent up to 100 But all"
"6587940","6592840"," that said the only way that incentive gets paid is if we've generated positive operating leverage"
"6592840","6598140"," If we've hit our revenue targets and if we've hit our EPS targets Terry, you know, when the analyst"
"6598140","6602860"," community starts parsing financials these days a lot of it is about Concentration of commercial"
"6602860","6607660"," real estate on the book They argue that you do have a little bit higher than than some peers. "
"6607660","6608820"," Is that a fair argument?"
"6610640","6618260"," We we have Really, I think for regional banks we're pretty well in line Obviously regulators use a"
"6618260","6623440"," guideline of 100 percent of risk-based capital to construction credit 300 percent of risk-based"
"6623440","6630540"," capital To total commercial real estate we're well underneath all those guidelines I think the more"
"6630540","6636280"," important thing is Exactly what gets financed where it's financed and how it performs and all I"
"6636280","6642720"," mean by that is I watch commercial real estate reports all over the country The markets that we"
"6642720","6648740"," operate here in the southeast are significantly different than what I see in san francisco or new"
"6648740","6654200"," england or some of these other markets And so I jokingly tell our investors Hey, you need to turn"
"6654200","6658340"," the television off and come to national Tennessee come to Raleigh, North Carolina Come to"
"6658340","6663380"," charleston come to charlotte come to jacksonville come to some of these other markets that we"
"6663380","6670460"," operate in we've enjoyed really strong rent growth Since 2020 which is a very different dynamic and"
"6670460","6675220"," plays out in the health of the commercial real estate portfolio Yeah, it's interesting that you"
"6675220","6680240"," mentioned that because analysts at piper say that your updated guidance and play is basically no"
"6680240","6686200"," worsening of credit conditions So is that a function of just the locations by which you're exposed"
"6686200","6694660"," to or do you think that we have writ large avoided a severe economic scenario Yeah, I think our"
"6694660","6701520"," internal Main scenario would be that we're headed for a soft landing perhaps a modest recession,"
"6701520","6704380"," but we're not looking for a Serious recession."
"6704760","6710060"," So that certainly plays through but it is critical to understand these southeastern markets I think"
"6710060","6715940"," a lot of people are familiar with the Population migration trends if you divide the country into"
"6715940","6722600"," four quadrants three of the four have negative net growth or out migration one quadrant Has"
"6722600","6728000"," positive growth and that's the southeast and so again these large urban markets that we operate in"

"7915920","7926380"," that roll down into uh Into uh the 30th of january Uh 450 450"
"7926380","7933180"," should be the worst of it if that if it even gets if it even gets that worse Excuse me"
"7937540","7939280"," Like 465 club."
"7939480","7946660"," There's a small gap down here at 465 That would be the highest probability that you erase uh, you"
"7946660","7950760"," erase uh to 4 68 or something like that."
"7950920","7951140"," Okay. "
"7951600","7957960"," It's like maybe you trade 475 Uh, then you trade that 468 that should be the worst of it in"
"7957960","7964780"," my view Um Now even so you might you might see if that 460 that that weekly trigger at 450"
"7964780","7972280"," excuse me Uh, four four forty eight four forty nine somewhere in there Uh, but just like blinders"
"7972280","7980020"," on right now Uh on the on the upside Targets that kind of stuff and if you really want to"
"7980020","7987220"," get bullish It's more than likely at the beginning stages of February, uh, that you're going to get"
"7987220","7994860"," that actual that actual major run now saying all of that even so Uh, if this run wants to go"
"7994860","7997680"," to fucking 480 or 4900 right now, sure."
"7998040","8001580"," There's just nothing there There's not there's no market for it."

"8009200","8015980"," the month Uh, they're just the mechanics like beginning of the month flows Uh, the options market"
"8016560","8021620"," You're gonna remember that you got a lot of people trying to close out their positioning for the"
"8021620","8028000"," month And then renegotiating for the following month Uh for the month of February coming up next"
"8028000","8035060"," those mechanics have to Take place and realize that you as a retail trader Whether you've got I"
"8035060","8040500"," don't know a thousand bucks or you got a fucking million dollars Uh, you are a very small component"
"8040500","8041700"," of the machine."

"8054900","8059720"," so when these guys are doing what they're doing it's best your best served usually to step out of"
"8059720","8066420"," the way And then follow their positioning for the following month once we get into uh, February,"
"8066600","8067000"," okay?"
"8070680","8077540"," You guys understand that at least that that concept conceptually that when When real money enters"
"8077540","8092130"," the market Uh, it's best to stay out get out of the way when that happens Is it"
"8092130","8095190"," smart to still be long here on spoos?"
"8095750","8101190"," Uh, yeah, I like the idea of being long here up into the gamma flip up here You got a"
"8101190","8105450"," little bit more room you could take Uh, so something like this right here, right?"
"8105610","8110630"," You got a little bit more room likely to go up here Uh, you might get this little extension up"
"8110630","8117030"," in here Uh, that leads to Uh, something like this right here Right up into this right here and"
"8117030","8123170"," possibly even up into this hourly trigger for an extension right here But I don't expect too much"
"8123170","8124050"," more after that."
"8124150","8129690"," I'm not and I don't really care if we go up I really don't care if we extend all the"
"8129690","8133270"," way if we squeeze up here Come back down."
"8133370","8139130"," Excuse me A little bit of that even that Uh, that's about all I'm expecting there at the most I'm"
"8139130","8144110"," going to expect like this ping pong action and I'm going to remember we got what one more two more"
"8144110","8146550"," days left You know some consolidating. "
"8146670","8152770"," I'm really looking to sell somewhere up in here if it's possible Uh, I really like to sell this in"
"8152770","8158550"," a friday or something for the beginning of next week for one more downside move And then try to"
"8158550","8166530"," seek out that 468 464 54 to the downside You Make sense and you figure we got two more days"
"8166530","8170010"," of this left Uh, what they it stays Wednesday, right?"
"8170470","8170870"," So we go."
"8170990","8178810"," Yeah, today's Wednesday got like two more days here to trade all of this Um Into Wednesday and so"
"8178810","8185770"," I'm going to look for a high somewhere around 474 475 whenever that happens if it's possible to"
"8185770","8192410"," grab that 475 Uh, I'm going to be looking for a reversal to the downside Into the 30th up there"
"8194590","8202469"," Good questions this morning by the way Uh, another thing too here like you could grab a call spread"
"8202469","8209830"," for 475 have an expire on monday Try to monetize it on friday and monday at that 475 that is"
"8209830","8214270"," also a nice trade if you see a reversal here at any point Come down, right?"
"8214370","8220809"," We bounce off this you get your double bottom you grab yourself some call spreads for 475 You date"
"8220809","8224990"," them for monday Uh, if it reverses and we're like, oh god."
"8225150","8226410"," I bought some call spreads here. "
"8226530","8228049"," I got stops underneath here, right?"
"8228270","8234790"," You can always reverse yourself and uh, take some zero date puts to pay for that trade But that's"
"8234790","8241230"," probably that if you wanted to trade between now and monday On a low try to grab if there's any"
"8241230","8245990"," kind of like pullback down here or something like that The trade is likely some kind of a call"
"8245990","8250730"," spread with a expiry of monday Uh, 470 to 475."
"8251610","8252910"," I don't know what that pays."
"8253430","8262650"," Um, also another great trade would be a condor or a um, um A fly that expires on friday or"
"8262650","8265549"," monday or some For you probably wouldn't want that to expire on monday. "
"8265629","8272750"," I want to expire on friday Uh, nice wide fucking wide spread on it And I would look for more"
"8272750","8279190"," of the acceleration move Uh to take place, uh, either either friday at the close or if we tagged"
"8279190","8288980"," 475 before then uh, or monday And then you guys like"
"8288980","8294299"," getting aggressive like if you want to get aggressive You're more than like you're like aggressive"
"8294299","8295000"," moves."
"8295340","8300480"," You're probably looking for that 475 to get aggressive to the downside Uh, you're probably looking"
"8300480","8302600"," for that, uh, big role not big."
"8302799","8303299"," It's not huge. "
"8303879","8308480"," Um, I I know there's not there's a ton of people out there right now That are calling for like"
"8308480","8312080"," major moves to the downside like big time bloodbath."
"8312280","8316959"," I don't see that right now Um, I don't see that fervor to the down."
"8317320","8321480"," I don't see that like vicious downside coming I know people want it. "
"8321580","8322860"," I get the people want it."
"8323100","8330260"," I understand why they want it Uh, I would I would be more prudent as a seller And take it"
"8330260","8331280"," step by step."
"8331459","8336920"," And if at any point there's a reversal, you're not going to get hung out to dry There's probably"
"8336920","8343200"," some bears out there right now that are like I just fucking slapped the fourth out or 4100 or 4200"
"8343780","8346400"," For a bunch of puts expiring in two weeks. "
"8346780","8349240"," It's possible Uh, is it likely?"
"8349840","8350420"," No, it's not."
"8350799","8354600"," Uh, it's not likely But there is one other thing here."
"8354600","8355400"," I wanted to discuss. "
"8355940","8357540"," Uh, it was late last night."
"8357660","8363760"," It was up You know, I was watching a guy that I trust on, uh, youtube Uh, not a market"
"8363760","8369799"," guy Uh, this guy is a uh, this guy deals with uh military kind of stuff And he kind of"
"8369799","8375540"," can he leaks kind of a little bit of this stuff, but uh, the hooty situation that's going on Um,"
"8377299","8386639"," there could be some potential with that You know, the us doctrine right now Is kind of funky Uh, us"
"8386639","8388520"," military doctrine is kind of funky."
"8388520","8391660"," We're in this weird place Uh, no, I don't know. "
"8391880","8397980"," I don't see this being discussed too frequently And it's but it's been grinding in my it's been"
"8397980","8402160"," grinding in the back of my head now for a couple weeks And this guy's kind of confirming it for"
"8402160","8409500"," me now There is some some threat here from the hooty situation Uh, that you might want to consider"
"8409500","8413520"," if there was going to be a downside move a number and a couple other things I don't give a"
"8413520","8416680"," fuck about china Um, I'll be honest with you."
"8416780","8422560"," I can care less about hang saying and I got no We don't I don't follow them Uh, as the"
"8422560","8426280"," leader of our economy to that extent Uh, it's to me."
"8426400","8433440"," It's just used as an excuse, but something does bother me right now, uh, is Um How do I describe"
"8433440","8434040"," this?"
"8434380","8442600"," You know us doctrine Us doctrine moved from, um, coin we used to be a divisional doctrine in our"
"8442600","8448360"," military That's where we uh, we have like a divisional down Leadership in our military. "
"8448820","8455820"," Okay, and this is for like large scale land wars And stuff like that and then uh, and when we"
"8455820","8465480"," were in the sandboxes, we switched to a coin Um, uh, posture and coin posture means the basic"
"8465480","8474620"," idea of coin posture is that Uh, a battalion or a brigade can can act semi autonomously This goes"
"8474620","8477880"," back to I think it was rumsfeld that said as you go with what you have not with to what"
"8477880","8484340"," you want kind of a thing But in truth, it's more Um Smaller units can make their own just do"
"8484340","8490260"," their own decision making Now the us military doctrine has been switching back to a divisional"
"8491200","8497420"," Doctrine and this is to fight a two front war with uh, russia and china."
"8497420","8503240"," I'll be honest with that's what it's for And the us military is ramping Uh, it's training and it's"
"8503240","8511540"," doctrine to meet that need Uh, by I believe 26 or 27 somewhere in there Uh, to be fully rated"
"8511540","8520720"," rock and rolling all 70 Readiness, uh, for that change in, uh, doctrine now What's been witnessed"
"8520720","8528260"," in ukraine Uh, with, uh, the advent it's not advent we've always had drones and stuff but the kind"
"8528260","8536160"," of drone warfare that's being used in ukraine right now Is throwing a large monkey wrench Uh, into"
"8536160","8544800"," us doctrine and one of the glaring it's not public but you what are the glaring Uh, um Insights"
"8544800","8552380"," that you can see is, uh, the red sea and how the us navy has approached, uh, the hooties I"
"8552380","8561060"," ran And, um shipping There's they're very standoffish right now The us military is not usually like"
"8561060","8566940"," that Normally they would have went right in right in and kicked some ass quickly And you can see"
"8566940","8574480"," it's not hesitation It's that, uh, with the advent of just cheap ass drones being able to do severe"
"8574480","8580840"," damage On tanks on shipping on ships on soldiers, right?"
"8581220","8589940"," Soldiers airmen, uh, sailors whatever Um, there's a huge impact there That the us military is"
"8589940","8597620"," highly aware of Uh, so an idea here would be this if you any guys out there that are veterans"
"8597940","8604080"," know that If you're a father or whatever if you're sitting on a forward operating base Uh, there's"
"8604080","8611120"," always a threat of um, there's always a threat of Incoming artillery of some kind, but you can hear"
"8611120","8621120"," it coming in Um, but the level of fear Was never really present like it would be with drones Um,"
"8621200","8627640"," and there's some I was I was reading a story last week This all coincides with itself, but a but"
"8627640","8635780"," a week ago is reading a story about Uh, the ptsd That Ukrainian soldiers and russian soldiers are"
"8635780","8643940"," going through right now Uh, which is abnormal for for current warfare Uh, we saw some of that in"
"8643940","8652660"," vietnam Uh, with, uh, with booby traps and stuff like that are a heightened, um heightened, um, uh"
"8653360","8658860"," Tear in the morale of soldiers and troops and sailors But the last time we've seen something like"
"8658860","8666120"," that was, uh, maybe maybe world war two in the pacific theater And more more glaringly in world war"
"8666120","8675360"," one Uh, where there's a constant there's a constant feeling of danger and dread and its effect on"
"8675360","8684960"," troops so When we're looking at, um How the u.s is engaging right now in the middle east There's"
"8684960","8690660"," likely some kind of a, um, Or what i've seen so far as more like, you know what let's hang"
"8690660","8696380"," back a little bit And we're going to reach out and touch someone more aggressively from a distance"
"8697160","8704600"," Then then boots on the ground or boats on the boats on the on the coast or Uh, uh, or"
"8704600","8711440"," direct intervention in these countries and The hootheys right now and i ran specifically Uh, we you"
"8711440","8717920"," don't want to get dragged in, uh, with the wrong show of force And and encounter any of these"
"8717920","8722820"," problems i've just related to where you were you lose a multi billion or a billion dollar warship"
"8722820","8731640"," Or you lose multi million dollar 20 30 million dollar, um Jets or even just troops being paranoid"
"8731640","8738940"," with boots on the ground So there is a possibility here that there could be some risk from, uh from"
"8738940","8746660"," the More direct intervention in iran and who and the hootheys that is not public right now Uh, but"
"8746660","8752900"," more standoffish, uh, that could be unknown to the market right now Uh, so just be aware of that in"
"8752900","8753300"," the background."
"8753520","8758280"," It's not something you're gonna trade to right now But just be aware of it that it is there Um,"
"8758580","8763760"," you know, you have like the shock and all kind of stuff that took place in iraq Uh, would not"
"8763760","8771320"," be surprised to see some kind of action like that, uh, where you see, um Aerial bombardments, uh,"
"8771400","8790470"," but but no commitment, uh, of troops stuff like that Yeah"
"8792130","8799850"," There's there's a you know, there's a um There's a real like I I'll be I was reading this story"
"8799850","8807350"," the other day about the impact on Ukrainians and Russian troops Man like that kind of that kind of"
"8807350","8816590"," stressor Hasn't been in fighting for modern modern militaries in a long"
"8816590","8823510"," long long long time and Um, you know, not knowing that there's a loitering munition above your"
"8823510","8831310"," head, uh at any time That's got a that it's Talk about not just destruction of morale, but"
"8831310","8841150"," destruction of the future combat readiness of, um, a soldier a sailor and airman It's it's a new"
"8841150","8842290"," paradigm without a doubt. "
"8842530","8847910"," It's a new paradigm, uh, for these soldiers So I'm sure that the military is looking at this very"
"8847910","8862540"," closely um Very closely for the for future fighting for the for the for the us How"
"8862540","8870980"," does that impact cl, um Well, we know right now that Uh, a lot of us shipping is not going"
"8870980","8871780"," to be insurable."
"8871780","8876400"," That's going to be an issue There's that we're coming to a head my point here."
"8876480","8883320"," That's a good question for cl We're coming to a point here Uh, where we would have normally"
"8883320","8891060"," intervened Probably two weeks ago Three weeks ago four weeks ago more aggressively but the advent"
"8891060","8898440"," of uh, these new the this new fighting style Uh, it looks like a trap It would look like a"
"8898440","8905180"," trap to me as well And watching the stand off stand offishness of the us military right now Is kind"
"8905180","8910000"," of like showing a hand from the us military saying we're going to take this slow Uh, the us"
"8910000","8915940"," military really doesn't have too much too many examples Of being able to defeat these types of, um,"
"8916200","8923640"," arms So it's like take it slow and see what happens right now saying all that Um You know, I"
"8923640","8928680"," wouldn't be surprised to wake up on You know sunday or something like that and seeing some some"
"8928680","8935960"," heavy heavy, uh action from afar Uh, uh with the hooties with yevin, uh, but no boots on the ground"
"8935960","8943260"," that kind of stuff like you might normally see Um a more direct, uh actions Now that wouldn't"
"8943260","8949300"," surprise me at this point there's been a lot of time Given a lot more time than than would normally"
"8949300","8954980"," be given to, uh, the hooties and yevin Uh, so I wouldn't shock me to wake up to some shock"
"8954980","8965120"," and awe On a sunday or something like that coming into monday How does that impact cl, uh"
"8965120","8973340"," negative in the short term but positive on the mid term Or not negative Prices would go up negative"
"8973340","8979880"," being the prices of oil would go up of it shipping in general Uh, it can't that we're coming to"
"8979880","8990440"," a head with the, um Risk to shipping Uh with the you know that they're targeting us You"
"8990440","8997560"," guys all know that like targeting us, um Shipping specifically right now and there are other"
"8997560","9003520"," countries that are Other countries that are changing their, uh, ais to signal that they're not with"
"9003520","9010120"," the united states So there's even In shipping itself right now, there's, uh, countries that are"
"9010120","9017700"," trying to say we're not with them specifically Chinese flagged, uh ships, uh, other nations russia"
"9017700","9024940"," china china, um India places like that saying hey, we're not Part of us shipping so it's coming to"
"9024940","9031860"," a point in a head right now Um, and I do expect some kind of act i'm personally from from"
"9031860","9036860"," my own experience in the military Uh, I expect some kind of action over the weekend over this"
"9036860","9050920"," weekend specifically All right, i'll be right back with you guys shortly All"
"9050920","9056520"," right, if As are we I think, uh, I think there's gonna be a lot of opportunity this year We"
"9056520","9061940"," can talk about the playbook in a little bit, but there is a wide range of outcomes that could"
"9061940","9063520"," happen With equities. "
"9063780","9069340"," I mean you can see a scenario where the fed engineers is off landing and we get to the 5200"
"9069340","9075000"," That tom lee's talking about that's nirvana has to be near perfection That's kind of the top end of"
"9075000","9080540"," your range too in the best case scenario for your outlook for this year Right that is and and"
"9080540","9085080"," everything has to go right in that scenario We suspect though that we're going to be challenged"
"9085080","9090100"," throughout the year I think what we say is we're data dependent so we're hanging on really every"
"9090100","9097200"," word Every data point to be able to see opportunities at the lower end of the range So what we"
"9097200","9103460"," would tell our clients is that we want to be mindful buyers If the market gives us that opportunity"
"9103460","9108760"," to do so and we want to be posers because we're long-term investors There's no question about it."
"9108900","9113520"," We're not selling when the market gets to the upper end of the range We're undulating the"
"9113520","9120100"," accelerator and reacting accordingly And I think now's the time to pause and see if it's a pause"
"9120100","9126260"," that refreshes You know the bond market's sending a lot of various signals Right the the the two "
"9126260","9134780","-year the two-year specifically and is it one of worry Truth is we don't we don't know that I"
"9134780","9140220"," like that you bring it up that way we don't know because You know does the does the strong economy"
"9140220","9145760"," Jimmy mean the Fed's going to cut less Well, what if you don't believe the economy is as strong as"
"9145760","9150740"," a retail number would Lead you to believe because some of the other data hasn't been all that"
"9150740","9155520"," strong At all then we start to think about well, what about a policy mistake?"
"9155980","9161700"," Fed says stays too tight for too long It leads you to what Waller said yesterday and remember he's"
"9161700","9168180"," sort of emerged as this person within the Fed that you know He arguably caused this whole rally"
"9168180","9174240"," from the end of October until the end of the year and He now seems to have put a little"
"9174240","9180100"," cold water on the rally over the last couple of days And caused this move higher in interest rates"
"9180100","9185500"," where he says that policy is set properly those are those are quotes Uh that the Fed should lower"
"9185500","9191280"," rates quote methodically and carefully No reason for the Fed to move rapidly as rapidly as in as"
"9191280","9196640"," prior easing cycles it goes to where I started We're not really sure What's exactly happening and"
"9196640","9200740"," how the Fed's gonna gonna react to it But the market has priced a lot of stuff in yeah, and"
"9200740","9205180"," I I think it's safe to say that we're not sure I'm not waking up in the middle of the"
"9205180","9209420"," night worrying about the markets right now I will acknowledge to everyone watching that this is a"
"9209420","9213180"," heavy tape right now I mean there's no question about it This is a heavy tape And I think that"
"9213180","9217560"," this is just simply an adjustment to the idea that we're not getting a rate cut in march And we"
"9217560","9223000"," shouldn't have gotten a rate cut in march But we're very likely to get one in may Um And I"
"9223000","9228200"," think the market just simply got ahead of itself But I do still commit to my overarching belief"
"9228200","9233500"," that this is a year in which earnings matter far more than the Fed We're talking about when the"
"9233500","9238380"," Fed's gonna cut not if they're gonna cut We're talking about the Fed cutting not how high are they"
"9238380","9243200"," going to continue to raise rates And that's a complete tone change In which news like today about"
"9243200","9248860"," retail sales and industrial production coming in better than expected is good news It pushes off"
"9248860","9254400"," further the idea that we're going to have a recession or a hard landing Both of which or excuse me"
"9254400","9258660"," They're both the same way of saying that that would impact earnings Which again is critical because"
"9258660","9264580"," if you want the rally to 5100 Tom's at 5200 but i'm at 5100 You have to get that 12 "
"9264580","9269840","% earnings growth this year So to the extent you got retail sales that says consumption strong"
"9269840","9274900"," employment is strong That's what i'm looking for i'm not worried about the market adjusting to the"
"9274900","9279820"," Fed now moving in in may instead of mark Yeah, but jiddy one of the key issues Certainly one of"
"9279820","9287100"," the key questions is is whether sentiment and valuation are off sides On the sentiment issue where"
"9287100","9291620"," you know as rob Perfectly laid it out how we came into last year and now how we've come into"
"9291620","9296700"," this year All bulled up on everything right relations coming down earnings going to be good economy"
"9296700","9301800"," is going to be strong stock market It's going to be good Jamie diamond was a little Maybe said"
"9301800","9303380"," there was too much optimism in Davos."
"9303480","9310760"," Let's listen I Think it's a mistake to assume that everything's hunky glory And you know and when"
"9310760","9314920"," stock markets are up, it's kind of like this little drug we all feel like it's just great You know,"
"9314940","9319520"," but remember we've had so much fiscal monetary stimulation So i'm a little more than the question"
"9319520","9326100"," side that we are facing a lot of things in 20 and oh 24 or 25 Is there too much"

"9326780","9331220"," Yeah, I think so And I don't think that it means we're in for a big crash or a huge"
"9331220","9335740"," retraction So here's kind of the way my math works out on that when you say, you know, it has"
"9335740","9341740"," that sentiment has that enthusiasm pushed evaluations off sides So the way I look at it is if we"
"9341740","9347040"," can get to consensus earnings, which is $247 a share That's assuming 11 growth over last year. "
"9347340","9351920"," You put it 20 times multiple on that that gets you to 4,900 You get a you put a"
"9351920","9356360"," 18 times multiple on that that gets you to 4,400 So I look at it like a range if"
"9356360","9359240"," we can have Rob's perfect scenario, right?"
"9359500","9360180"," Everything goes great."
"9360500","9361400"," I think we get to 4,900."
"9361820","9367300"," That's up for and change percent from here If we're kind of in you know, valuations not being"
"9367300","9373460"," totally off sides hovering it 18 times Um, that's down 7 percent from here So I think it's off"
"9373460","9378520"," sides But I think the magnitude this year should be more tame than what we've seen in the past two"
"9378520","9381800"," years I mean, we're coming off of some crazy emotional swings, right?"
"9382000","9387040"," Thinking about 2022 with the market being down 18 last year or 13 up 26 I kind of like where"
"9387040","9392680"," we are right now because we can point to anything we can point to Everything anything but I think"
"9392680","9397620"," the reality is is we just need time to digest And I think it's a pretty healthy I would be"
"9397620","9401520"," thrilled if we end this year flat After a plus 26 percent year. "
"9401820","9405780"," So I think it's a healthy place to be in where we're not getting crazy with over overly robust"
"9405780","9413220"," expectations We think about what what diamond said I think there are Always concerns whether it's"
"9413220","9416460"," geopolitical or economic I think in 2024."
"9416720","9422460"," Yes, we have concerns and I think one of those concerns is what you cited before and that is"
"9422960","9427620"," Ultimately what the direction of monetary policy is going to be are they going to make a mistake"
"9427620","9432980"," and stay too long I think that's the risk that they do stay too long I also think when you"
"9432980","9441080"," take the totality of the first 17 calendar days of january What's missing clearly to me is follow"
"9441080","9447320"," through Follow through from where we were on wednesday, december 27th when a 10-year treasury was"
"9447320","9453720"," 378 And we were talking about a 10-year treasury falling to 3.50 You never got that follow through"
"9453720","9459400"," it's got because you didn't get the follow through Once again, you're seeing that capital is frozen"
"9460080","9465640"," You've talked to a lot of people in the asset management industry They will tell you that a lot of"
"9465640","9471380"," the money that was in motion at the end of the year is once again frozen Because you're challenged"
"9471380","9476520"," by a 10-year treasury above 10 percent And people are still sitting in those cashier the equivalent"
"9476520","9483540"," challenged by valuation because you're trying in your own mind To justify the valuation of the"
"9483540","9488800"," market when you look at where we are today versus the 10-year average The Dow for example 17 and"
"9488800","9494900"," a half times today 16 and a half times is the 10-year rob s&p 500 today 19 and"
"9494900","9502580"," a half times 10-year average 17.8 Nasdaq 100 today is 25 The 10-year historical average is 21 "
"9502580","9509160",".7 So we had the dean evaluation from nyu i swap the motor on closing bell with me yesterday and"
"9509160","9515480"," he said yeah, it's extended Listen, what he said I think right now the market is overvalued I mean"
"9515480","9520600"," my estimate is about nine 10 percent And part of the reason I think is the expectations game has"
"9520600","9525100"," turned against the market I mean if you remember the start of last year and recession was almost"
"9525100","9530460"," guaranteed rates were going to go up inflation was out of control And every strategy that you had"
"9530460","9535200"," essentially said was going to be a terribly off the stocks Turned out to be exact the exact"
"9535200","9540520"," opposite everything turned out to work in the opposite direction My fear is that we've moved too"
"9540520","9541640"," much in the other direction."
"9542160","9546680"," Now people assume there is no recession inflation is under control and everything's going to be"
"9546680","9552280"," okay So I think this year good news is going to require a lot more than it did last year"
"9552280","9559160"," And that to me is why I think stocks are in a dangerous place right now I think he's right"
"9559160","9564080"," at least in the short run because even if you look out two years and you go to 25 and"
"9564080","9570220"," you assume that they earnings deliver And you're at 270 you're still at 17 and a half times It's"
"9570220","9576340"," still a very frothy market from a valuation perspective and that that's why earnings is so so"
"9576340","9581880"," important right now And if you look at the magnificent seven, let's say and you've seen a dichotomy"
"9581880","9587680"," this year Those that are growing their earnings quite substantially are performing those that"
"9587680","9595960"," aren't the apples the Teslas are are really struggling from a performance standpoint year to date"
"9595960","9603280"," microsoft google meta Doing great because they they have earnings expectations that are up and"
"9603280","9609780"," they're expected to deliver So it is a story of earnings delivery and we think you want to hug that"
"9609780","9615700"," quality trade now That's a trade that's worked for a year and a half Look we came into this year"
"9615700","9620940"," thinking that there was going to be a shift From the so-called quality like mega cap that's what"
"9620940","9626100"," you're speaking of Obviously and it was going to be this broadening out rally because we were going"
"9626100","9630800"," to pull it off Pull this off landing off fed's going to cut Economy's going to hang in and maybe"
"9630800","9635800"," no landing at all and all is going to be right in the world But Jamie diamond suggests maybe things"
"9635800","9642500"," are a little bit ahead of themselves Demotor and says maybe valuation is ahead of itself That is"
"9642500","9647760"," exactly why there's been a move back to quality if you look at the performance Year to date the"
"9647760","9652780"," Russell's down six People came into the the beginning of the year saying that the Russell's the"
"9652780","9657240"," place to be and we're gonna have a rotation Well, the Russell the Russell's underperformed"
"9657240","9661460"," everything by leaps and bounds to start this year Which is just a risk off as the market adjusts to"
"9661460","9666520"," rates frankly in my opinion, but let me let me let me well Okay, but if we're going to talk"
"9666520","9671880"," about valuation We're not going to cite the small cap sector as an overvalued sector We are going"
"9671880","9677740"," to cite the fangma, you know, which is taken as quality as overpriced and not all of it I'm not"
"9677740","9682040"," going to see in video 26 times that forward earnings is overpriced not with 50 percent earnings"
"9682040","9688000"," growth Might say that Microsoft for the growth rate expected at 32 times is is overpriced But"
"9688000","9690400"," here's the point to the dean evaluations point. "
"9690740","9695880"," Yes, most of fangma is overpriced That's not the whole market when you strip those names out you"
"9695880","9700820"," get to 17 times 17 times is not expensive and so people are going to say well It's a higher"
"9700820","9705120"," interest rate environment than it was two years ago So what the 10 year average five and a half"
"9705120","9710140"," percent in the 90s and you had low 20s multiple for most of the last half of the 90 So"
"9710140","9710680"," they're cheap for a reason."
"9711100","9715500"," They're cheap for a reason Which is cheap for a reason the ones that you cite are the valuation is"
"9715500","9722580"," is cheap small caps and these other areas Of course, they're of course, they're much much much"
"9722580","9727240"," cheaper But can I say something I was JP Morgan cheap at 10 times JP Morgan's had a huge run"
"9727240","9729960"," So that's why you usually Here's the thing."
"9730080","9730360"," They're cheap. "
"9730500","9730740"," Sorry."
"9730980","9732220"," I'm so excited about this topic."
"9732340","9738240"," Obviously They're cheap compared to the S&P They always have been they always will be what matters"
"9738240","9743620"," is that they're cheap compared to their historical levels So you take mid cap 15.2 times small cap"
"9743620","9750940"," 15.4 and then MSCI Those are all about three points lower than their historical averages They"
"9750940","9756940"," always trade cheap to the to the S&P, but where they are now they're not cheap They're always cheap"
"9756940","9760620"," for a reason, but right now they're stupidly cheap I don't think we flipped the conversation. "
"9760620","9765980"," We were talking about expensive what they are is not expensive You cannot say that small caps are"
"9765980","9767000"," expensive, but here's what's happened."
"9767160","9773500"," Here's what's happened though The burst of activity at the end of last year Through everything off"
"9774100","9780840"," Because the stocks ran up so much It was rain-striven though It was rain-striven It was 100 percent"
"9780840","9787220"," rain-striven So you have this dichotomy between cheap for a reason And quality names that are cheap"
"9787220","9793040"," because you can look at international indices small cap indices And you will find value in there"
"9793040","9798500"," where there is earnings to support those names And then you'll look at others That have rallied"
"9798500","9806040"," dramatically all on the back of expectations of very large rate cuts That are not materializing"
"9806040","9810300"," that the market is pushing back again Jim is making Jim is trying to make the argument No, he's"
"9810300","9816340"," trying to make he's trying to make the argument that earnings are going to be supportive Of those"
"9817420","9824660"," 493 other names That whole argument is based on that that is that is the central thesis of my"
"9825200","9831000"," Reason why there's been a reversion back towards mega cap to start this year Is because that seems"
"9831000","9836600"," to be thrown in question now About some of the data has been squirrely The Fed direction is not so"
"9836600","9841700"," clear certainly like people thought it was when the calendar made the turn So you go right back to"
"9841700","9848320"," what you believe in balance sheets cash mega cap Scott, I I wouldn't disagree but let me add to you"
"9848320","9853940"," Add to what you just said as far as reasons why the market is definitely heavy as I said In"
"9853940","9857640"," the first three weeks, there's a lot going on there is questions about earnings There's always"
"9857640","9863420"," questions about earnings projections folks always Okay, but if you look at genie peak growth where"
"9863420","9868440"," it is around 2.2 percent margins improving I've said this for a long time You look at the ppi"
"9868440","9873780"," so far below cpi that equates to margin improvements It is likely to get that earnings growth what"
"9873780","9878840"," we're not talking about all the other stuff And there's a lot of it Okay, the middle east is this"
"9878840","9884500"," close this close to blowing up One stupid thing on the northern border of of israel and that's"
"9884500","9888540"," partly what the markets worried about it It's also worried about politics here in the u.s And"
"9888540","9893840"," elections across the globe My point on this is not to say that there hasn't been a rotation of"
"9893840","9898640"," quality There has been My point is to say that outside of that quality if we're talking about"
"9898640","9904780"," valuation in the markets and being overvalued It's in those bang must slash quality names It is not"
"9904780","9910400"," in the small caps at 15 times this year's earnings Yeah, I think we're kind of all over the play"
"9910400","9915300"," I agree with jimmy when you're talking about valuation small caps are are not overvalued But but"
"9915300","9920860"," your point is is is is well taken and your point is at the end of the year You saw"
"9920860","9926440"," capital going into the neglected areas of the market And it's because of what I identified at the"
"9926440","9932180"," top of the show and what rob just also mentioned And it's because rates looked like they were going"
"9932180","9938000"," to move significantly lower And they have not and there's an effect of rates moving higher On the"
"9938000","9943300"," balance sheets of companies that are not as profitable as the mega caps So really what has not"
"9943300","9951740"," unfolded so far this year as rates have risen Is that people have begun to shed their exposure To"
"9951740","9957960"," these quality names and move into the areas of the market that were neglected last year And are"
"9957960","9964160"," reliant are reliant on what the cost of capital is and that process isn't going to unfold Unless"
"9964160","9969940"," you see yields begin to retreat if yields stay elevated This is the formation we're going to have"
"9969940","9973280"," and I think you're going to have this formation I don't through the first quarter I don't think"
"9973280","9982240"," jimmy's argument that the other all these other stocks are Cheap or undervalued is is the argument"
"9983040","9984660"," There is no argument to that."
"9984840","9984900"," Yes. "
"9985200","9985700"," They are cheaper."
"9986440","9992420"," Okay They're cheaper There's a lack of confidence To buy those names for the last three It has"
"9992420","9998820"," nothing to do with the valuation of those stocks for the last three Everything to do with the"
"9998820","10002500"," confidence on the direction of where we're going and what the fed's going to do period end of story"
"10002500","10005500"," I asked you a question that the other 49ers into this."
"10005600","10010520"," Let me just do let me do this to you What happens if the yield curve uninverts what happens to"
"10010520","10010880"," the market?"
"10011360","10016500"," The yield curve looked like it was going to uninvert now it's re-inverting Yesterday we were"
"10016500","10018600"," sitting on the 25 basis points. "
"10019260","10024380"," So I mean we were talking 125 basis points six months ago Okay, my point being is that's an"
"10024380","10025620"," indication of economic strength."
"10025940","10026340"," Okay."
"10026700","10033460"," Yesterday the yield curve two to ten was negative 15 basis points Okay, we were coming very close"
"10033460","10040100"," to getting back to disinverting today We're seeing a dramatic move in the two year now the"
"10040100","10043260"," disinversion is lost It's inverting it's deepening. "
"10043260","10045640"," It's minus 25 basis points."
"10046420","10053380"," So I think Jimmy I think the right word to use okay is tell me if the seven stocks forget"
"10053380","10056880"," the other 493 Because in the other 493 you could find opportunities."
"10057140","10062060"," I completely agree with you Okay, JP Morgan being one of them We know the list but what you have"
"10062060","10067340"," to you have to acknowledge is those seven stocks are incredibly attractive In the type of"
"10067340","10074480"," environment that we are in right now seven and profitability all seven take out Tesla Profitability"
"10074480","10081320"," profitability is being prioritized what your margins are you're seeing when companies are missing"

"10087600","10094080"," punishing you for that miss and I think that's incredibly important We're back to a place where the"
"10094080","10098360"," fundamental metrics are going to matter And you can't tell me that you're going to find better"
"10098360","10103640"," fundamental metrics Then you could find with Microsoft alphabet Apple and Amazon let's talk some"

"10183720","10188280"," Seem to have paired some of the losses So they have in fact done that as we've worked to to"
"10188280","10190360"," noon here in the east what what's your take here?"
"10190560","10195300"," So they reported earnings and like top line EPS came in six percent ahead But once you took out"
"10195300","10199200"," taxes you realize it was down by three percent and I think that Kind of jarred."
"10199380","10202900"," I don't know the algorithmic trading program is because again No one with a brain would have read"
"10202900","10206520"," these earnings and said boy the stock should be down seven or eight percent So then people actually"
"10206520","10210980"," started listening thinking about what was going on And what they saw was that total client assets"

"10214020","10218600"," There's still the TD acquisition sorting through there They're seeing the end of cash sorting."

"10460990","10464930"," when we bought it Our our thesis was that they would get back to two dollars of earnings at this"
"10464930","10468830"," point We think they can get back to one dollar earnings If it can get back to one dollar earnings"
"10468830","10472830"," of trading at five dollars a share But this is where when you're down this much on an investment"
"10472830","10478130"," Like you really question yourself and go back and kind of start from ground zero Wait, hold on you"
"10478130","10482670"," you just took your own earnings expectation in half We did that like a year ago, but you took it"

"10483110","10485890"," Yes So how can you have the same view of this company and the stock?"
"10485970","10490290"," No, we don't and so when we bought it initially it was like 14 dollars a share That's when we"

"12785470","12792690"," it gets why do you say that recession risks are still elevated at 25 percent down from the 50"
"12792690","12798070"," percent you thought was likely last year didn't happen but why do you think recession risks are"
"12798070","12804990"," still elevated in an economy that is performing well well Tyler I don't think we can feel entirely"
"12804990","12809990"," comfortable about the economic outlook until the Fed starts lowering interest rates I mean they're"
"12809990","12815930"," close they're gearing up for it they're forecasting three rate cuts this year a quarter point each"
"12815930","12822190"," time so we're almost there but until that happens you know it's hard to declare the coast is the"
"12822190","12828090"," coast is clear here with rates this high yield curve is inverted as it is you know puts a lot"
"12828090","12832370"," of pressure on the financial system banking system and so you know things can go off the rails so"
"12832370","12837730"," you know I'm feeling pretty good about the economy all the trend lines look really good the risks"
"12837730","12842530"," of recession are starting to fade I even think there's some upside risks potentially for the"
"12842530","12847010"," economy as well but until the Fed starts cutting rates I don't think I think we can declare victory"
"12847010","12853170"," what would an upside risk be what would it look like what we got in 2023 I mean it looks"
"12853170","12858050"," like GDP growth in 23 is going to come in at two and a half percent which is really very"
"12858050","12862950"," good above most estimates of the economy's potential and that happened because we got a lot of"
"12862950","12867610"," growth in the labor force and labor productivity growth was also very strong and that could"
"12867610","12873690"," continue into 2024 and if it does then we have more room to run we can get more growth without"
"12873690","12880390"," having any pick up in inflation and if they can't that's an upside scenario Steve what do you make"
"12880390","12885590"," of what Mark has said here elevated risk of a recession at about 25 percent I guess normal is"
"12885590","12893390"," something in the 15 percent percentage rate what do you say well I've been reporting through our"
"12893390","12900650"," Fed survey Tyler that the recession risk were as high as 60 percent last year and now in the"
"12900650","12906590"," December survey we did they went down to 41 percent so if Mark tells me 25 percent I'll take that"
"12906590","12912390"," as a victory and a really good sign I understand why there's something of an elevated chance you"
"12912390","12917090"," want to go back to normal which would be our 15 percent but Tyler I want to lay out for"
"12917090","12924150"," you what I've been thinking about here which is I think the Fed can cut three times here yeah I'm"
"12924150","12930410"," going to try to uh which is not what the market's after but it's I'm going to try to capture"
"12930410","12937210"," a little bit of cash here between now and Friday and then I'm going to put side as we head"
"12937210","12942990"," into Friday on a high if we can get 475 on a high at some point if it's brief I"
"12942990","12946850"," don't really care and then close that out and then I'm going to be looking for a roll to the"
"12946850","12954930"," downside Friday Monday and take on a pretty aggressive downside I'll put spread now there's a"
"12954930","12961250"," little caveat here let me go back over here and show you guys this so you got this nice little"
"12961250","12968690"," double bottom right here if this begins to reverse there's a chance we is a possibility that we can"
"12968690","12974730"," get a roll down here and then a bounce higher good little V shape thing in here what I can"
"12974730","12980530"," end up doing is if I really need to we begin to roll below this S2 at any point or"
"12980530","12987790"," sell off into the bell today or something stupid like that to tag that 470 you can cut the other"
"12987790","12994990"," side one side of it loose rather than like the 472 you cut those loose you leave the 475s on"
"12996190","13001410"," for the sold called side so if you see anything wonky going on there's another thing to here it"
"13001410","13006290"," would be to just leave it on and then hold it into expire in Friday it was pretty fucking cheap"
"13006290","13012710"," dude it cost me a dollar 22 pays a dollar 78 so I'm fairly happy with it I'm not looking"

"13386990","13391570"," economy Steve how did you react to that and I I would throw another thing in there there was fiscal"
"13391570","13397470"," stimulus there was monetary stimulus that contributed certainly to the growth of inflation in the"
"13397470","13405310"," 2021-22-23 period but there's another thing there and that is rising wages a lot of states a lot"
"13405310","13411870"," of municipalities raised wages by fiat and said you've got to hit a minimum wage of x dollars an"
"13411870","13419110"," hour companies did that but they didn't stop and eat those costs they passed those costs on I mean"
"13419110","13423870"," go to a Starbucks it costs a lot more than it did three or four years ago to get a"
"13423870","13431010"," Starbucks coffee I should be in such pain I mean these are these are not essential items that are a"
"13431010","13435610"," lot a lot of other essential items but the same thing was going on there higher wages were pushing"
"13435610","13442930"," through the system and those wages were resulting in part in higher prices yeah that's the way it"
"13442930","13448870"," works it is important the way you tell that story Tyler whether you meant to or not but in the"
"13448870","13454870"," story you told it was prices driving wages not wages driving prices so there wasn't necessarily a"
"13454870","13461470"," wage price spiral from an economics point of view which was important but you're right and and and"
"13461470","13467230"," by the way that sequence is also significant for how people feel in that you're always a little bit"
"13467230","13472610"," behind in that context your wages may go up to meet those higher prices but they're always going to"
"13472610","13479490"," be behind we are just now Tyler in a period where wage gains have been positive on an inflation"
"13479490","13486310"," adjusted basis I was just looking you mentioned milk you know the price index remains quite a bit"
"13486310","13494650"," above where it was we are not going back to those prices before the pandemic no and and in part"
"13494650","13500310"," the reason for that is well if you reduce the prices you're also going to end up reducing the wages"
"13500310","13507170"," and that's politically unpalable as well so the story here is that over time people will get used"
"13507170","13513850"," to a new price level and over time their wages and their productivity should rise to compensate for"
"13513850","13519450"," that but for many it hasn't yet overall on average it is but that means that some people are still"
"13519450","13524510"," lagging behind whether or not that has an impact on the election eventually and I like the way you"
"13524510","13529710"," told the story in that it was both administrations that provided the stimulus but you know the old"
"13529710","13534890"," the buck stops here I guess the buck inflates here in the in the case of Biden he was the"
"13534890","13539250"," one in charge he also added to it through fiscal stimulus and he's the one taking the blame yeah"
"13539250","13545030"," very exactly just quickly on the last point I you know there's a long list of reasons why inflation"
"13545030","13552610"," got out of control but you know I don't think I'd put the fiscal policy at the top of the"
"13552610","13557590"," list certain may not even be on the list I mean but really drove the inflation was the pandemic the"
"13557590","13563310"," supply chain disruptions labor market disruption and the Russian war a monetary policy also played"
"13563310","13566830"," a bit of a role I mean I think we can all agree the Fed was slow in raising rates"
"13566830","13572210"," in response to the rising inflation but fiscal policy certainly not at this point in time I just"
"13572210","13577110"," don't see it well that's interesting because I mean I think there's a lot in the stew that disagree"
"13577110","13583550"," yeah I I'm I don't know I mean I don't know where you put a percentage of of effect or"
"13583550","13590410"," influence on on fiscal policy but but I didn't mention the war in in in Ukraine number one and I"
"13590410","13595530"," didn't mention the other thing there which which you did mention I can't remember what it was what"
"13595530","13601330"," do you just say pandemic the pandemic and the supply chain that certainly contributed to rising"
"13601330","13606470"," cost Steve final thought quickly tied up No I just just quickly and Mark and I probably should have"
"13606470","13611690"," this debate offline I'm sure he has some good data on this but my sense is that there was an"
"13611690","13618210"," overstimulation I don't know that it was the wrong policy at the time in that what we were afraid"
"13618210","13623490"," of again during the pandemic we didn't know all the risks that were out there and maybe"
"13623490","13629410"," overstimulating was the right risk management call but if people didn't have so much money in their"
"13629410","13635710"," pockets their supply chain problems would not have been as severe as they were so I had called for"
"13635710","13641530"," at the time a more attenuated stimulus package I think that would have been more helpful and I also"
"13641530","13646830"," think the Fed should have responded to that fiscal package as the size of it was and started"
"13646830","13652250"," cutting and easing back on quantitative easing sooner and we might not have had the inflation"
"13652250","13656190"," outcome that we had interesting discussion gentlemen thank you very much we'll do it again soon"
"13656190","13661790"," Mark Zandy Steve Leesman appreciate it all right let's talk about more on fiscal policy next guest"
"13661790","13667190"," says that should be the top investor concern and not the timing of rate cuts for more let's bring"
"13667190","13671690"," in Jamie Cox managing partner at Harris Financial Group Jamie why don't we pick up where we left"
"13671690","13678890"," off how contributory do you believe fiscal policy was to the inflation that the country experienced"
"13678890","13684390"," over the past two three years I think it was critical I mean if you rewind the clock back to"
"13684390","13691410"," the financial crisis in 2008 you had monetary policy wide open but fiscal policy sort of petered"
"13691410","13696910"," out and we had the defense sequester and you had fiscal policy which was basically absent so you"
"13696910","13701730"," had monetary policy that didn't really contribute much of anything to inflation for a number of"
"13701730","13706390"," years but then you fast forward to the pandemic and you had this double barreled approach where you"
"13706390","13712270"," had both monetary policy wide open and fiscal stimulus wide open I mean you're basically raining"
"13712270","13717810"," money from both sides so the fiscal piece of this was one of the biggest factors and it wasn't just"
"13717810","13723390"," one it wasn't just you know the CARES Act it went all the way through infrastructure and it seems"
"13723390","13728530"," to keep ongoing and then including in that is also the tax cuts that came along with the tax cuts"
"13728530","13734430"," and job acts but came before the pandemic so you had a lot of fiscal stimulus and I think that"
"13734430","13740330"," is probably the largest contributor to the equation because monetary policy is a little bit laggy"
"13740330","13746050"," fiscal policy is very quick and so I think that is to me one of the biggest pieces and I"
"13746050","13752310"," think that is you can even go back and throw into that that fiscal stew the 2017 tax cuts that"
"13752310","13757810"," took effect in 2018 and they ripple through the economy as you know at a lag maybe it's not the"
"13757810","13763230"," lag that monetary policy has but but nonetheless it does take a while and I would argue that that"
"13763230","13769410"," that the fiscal stimulus it was put into the economy in 2020 and to a lesser degree in 2021 was"
"13769410","13778170"," to was insurance to ward off potentially an existential risk to millions of jobs and the economy's"
"13778170","13784110"," ongoing strength as a whole you talk about a fiscal cliff redox and how to avoid it what do you"
"13784110","13790970"," mean by a fiscal cliff redox and and why is it an ominous prospect there are a lot of parts"
"13790970","13797350"," of the tax cut and job act that that sunset in this year it's not as bad as the bush"
"13797350","13802290"," tax cuts where everything just sort of be set but there are critical pieces of this legislation"
"13802290","13807790"," which I've been on the Hill a little bit lately that a lot of lawmakers are very focused on and"
"13807790","13812630"," there have been some bipartisan you know workings here all of a sudden which is actually positive"
"13812630","13817910"," news on some of the less onerous pieces of this like extending the child tax credit or expanding it"
"13817910","13822890"," you know going back to the bonus depreciation these are very stimulative pieces those are direct"
"13822890","13827510"," payments to people and also you know allowing depreciation increases cash flows for investment so"
"13827510","13833130"," that's that's important but there are there's a much larger piece of this which is section 199 a"
"13833130","13837870"," which is the 20 percent pass through deduction that's critical for small businesses like plumbers"
"13837870","13842810"," and electricians and things like that that there is some movement on that but that's going to be a"
"13842810","13848190"," bigger problem because if you take away some of that pass through deduction and increase taxes on"
"13848190","13852390"," small business at the same time they're paying higher interest rates that's going to you know hit"
"13852390","13857030"," the service side of the economy pretty hard so that's something we need to get fixed and get fixed"
"13857030","13861870"," quickly because we if we sunset and put everything back in the ordinary income tax rates for many"
"13861870","13866370"," of these service providers it's going to change the job outlook you've reduced their profitability"
"13866370","13871690"," you reduced the ability for them in the capacity to hire or keep current staff at certain levels so"
"13871690","13877790"," so that's really important I'm hoping that it will work itself out and I do see some movement on"
"13877790","13882310"," the democrats side this was largely the pass through deduction was largely with republicans but the"
"13882310","13887670"," democrats seems very very interested in getting this done so hopefully we may get you know some of"
"13887670","13893610"," the you know bigger pieces we have the salt deduction that is really a problem for the northeast in"
"13893610","13897550"," particular for lawmakers in the northeast trying to get reelected so i'm not sure how that one will"
"13897550","13901750"," work yeah but on the pass through deduction that actually affects the economy I think we have a"
"13901750","13906770"," decent chance of getting that done but if it doesn't and we continue to have these you know even"
"13906770","13911430"," this week we have a CR another another government shutdown potential we're just going to be going"
"13911430","13916610"," rolling through these all year long and that to me is way more important monetary policy because"
"13916610","13920370"," the feds told us what they're going to do they're going to lower rates a couple times this year"
"13920370","13924290"," they're not going to raise them any further it's very unlikely they'll do so that's a pretty good"
"13924290","13928890"," operating environment for investors so that's why I think fiscal policy is way more important now"

"15081360","15088100"," units is that right over the past year of which about five million were exported that leaves 25"
"15088100","15096740"," million or thereabouts to be consumed in China are those vehicles favored in China because they are"
"15096740","15104300"," low price number one because they are you're perceived as buying from the home team number two and"

"15759670","15764530"," deal activity this year is what your baseline forecast is there are different kinds of deals there"
"15764530","15769670"," are the PE deals that became so famous over the past couple of decades and then the more strategic"
"15769670","15775850"," deals which we've begun to see in energy we've begun to see them in pharma and so forth how does"
"15775850","15780650"," that split go is it it's 12 percent overall but is one going to be more dominant in terms of"
"15780650","15784910"," growth than the other they're pretty close so we would expect about a 12 percent increase in"
"15784910","15790470"," corporate and a 13 percent increase in private equity so not too far away so not too far away and"
"15790470","15797150"," where to the extent that you're able to look ahead would you expect the deals of the strategic sort"
"15797150","15803210"," the strategic combinations to be sort of more prevalent what sectors so the sectors that they're"
"15803210","15807230"," more prevalent and are the ones where the multiples have gone down because the cost of capital is"
"15807230","15812790"," still high so you can't have high cost of capital and high multiples and expect M&A activity the"
"15812790","15817830"," three so not tech not the big tech necessarily multiples actually have gone down a little bit yeah"
"15817830","15822290"," over here so we are seeing a pickup i mean tech is behind but there's still the most dominant"
"15822290","15826670"," player from a sector perspective so we would expect a small pickup in tech but we're expecting to"
"15826670","15831490"," pick up and watch sciences as well as in energy which you've seen a lot of big energy deals"
"15831490","15835410"," announced in the last quarter yeah we certainly have i mean and the granddaddies of the mall"
"15835410","15842450"," chevron have been active exon of course doing their deal in the in the permian area let's talk a"
"15842450","15847790"," little bit about cost of capital how critical is it that is the is it that interest rates borrowing"
"15847790","15854070"," costs remain where they are or fall in order for your forecast of 12 13 percent growth to come true"
"15854070","15859530"," so for our base our baseline scenario assumes that the cost of capital will come down a point a"
"15859530","15865430"," point and a half if it doesn't then i think we're looking at less less of a growth in M "
"15865430","15870370","&A so it's very it's critical because again the multiples aren't coming down that significantly so"
"15870370","15875130"," the cost of capital has to come down to see a re-emergence of M&A so the strategic combinations"
"15875130","15881830"," you see are in bio and life sciences maybe in energy how about the PE area would it sort of"
"15881830","15889310"," track the same you expect the PE firms the blackstones the the KKRs the carliles to be active in"
"15889310","15893250"," that same area or in other ones in the same area a lot of tech there's a lot of P"
"15893250","15898830"," activity and tech and in health care as well and and where in tech specifically are you seeing and"
"15898830","15904450"," i mean obviously the big tend to get bigger in these in these circumstances right a lot around AI"

"15909470","15917210"," to look at who will be the active buyers let's talk about tech most specifically will it be the the"
"15917210","15925690"," big whales in the business the metas the the alphabets the amazon's the microsoft's or whom i think"
"15925690","15930110"," it will be the big ones the big ones still have a very robust m&a pipeline whether or not"
"15930110","15935610"," they're acting on it right now it doesn't necessarily indicate that the pipeline isn't there so"
"15935610","15939810"," there is still an active pipeline that they will act upon when the environment is right so the big"
"15939810","15945430"," guys will be the acquirers virtually anybody could be the acquiree in this case and i assume i"
"15945430","15950630"," don't know this to be the case i assume if you're looking at life sciences you're looking not only"
"15950630","15957130"," at large pharma that may be having a pipeline uh dirth a trouble in there but i don't have enough"
"15957130","15962510"," so they're buying drugs but it could be other companies that as well couldn't it well they're"

"15983790","15990010"," life sciences are there other and you said tech uh are there others that that could be out there as"
"15990010","15994210"," well i don't think there's sleepers but we do say if you look at like the secondary level of having"

"16285350","16291490"," see in a lot of different things first and foremost you look at mastercard spending pulse data"

"16296910","16301950"," that's a real deceleration we've seen all the banks report their credit card spending and"
"16301950","16306270"," decelerated from the third quarter and then you'll look at one-off companies whether it's Nike"
"16306270","16311850"," whether it's Burberry whether it's Hugo Boss they're talking about a weaker consumer so despite the"
"16311850","16318830"," december government breeding of stronger retail sales we're seeing some signs of weakness here how"
"16318830","16325590"," is the market going to handle what may well be slower economic growth this year when you look at"
"16325590","16331550"," last year's nominal GDP of about seven percent this year is going to come in around half that"
"16331550","16336750"," probably three and a half percent so I think that there's a real mismatch in terms of earnings"
"16336750","16342690"," expectations for double digit earnings growth versus a slower revenue growth environment so my"
"16342690","16347850"," guess is that earnings estimates for the overall market have to come down and so then the question"
"16347850","16352910"," for investors is what do you do here I think what you're looking for is companies that can bust"
"16352910","16359370"," through that that have real good secular growth prospects what's interesting here jim if you take a"
"16359370","16364350"," look at the overall picture that we're talking about is this idea that with the consumer spending"
"16364350","16369430"," picture the retail sales data coming in strong I think bespoke was out with a note earlier today"
"16369430","16374490"," saying it's a six straight time that we've seen a better than expected report on retail sales and"
"16374490","16380550"," at the same time you've got reports that 56 million Americans have been in credit card debt for at"
"16380550","16385750"," least a year maybe longer how exactly does that story then play out we've been seeing consumer"
"16385750","16391630"," strength driving things for a while shaking off some of the negative headlines that's been one of"

"16408390","16414029"," home for roose and I think we're at that point right now so again you need a very differentiated"
"16414029","16419830"," company that has real secular growth to bust through a slower consumer spending environment because"
"16419830","16425810"," as we all know the consumer is driving GDP ultimately let's talk about some of the stocks you like"
"16425810","16431250"," and some of the sectors you like I see three on your on your nice list not the naughty list"
"16431250","16438029"," active Amazon and CDW why those so you look at active and active is a stock that's really been"
"16438029","16444310"," beaten up in the last year quite frankly everybody's worried about the EV slowdown and certainly"
"16444310","16450290"," that is happening but we've been under producing cars globally for the last couple of years so"
"16450290","16456050"," there's certainly a catch up as cars don't last indefinitely and the buyer of a car does want more"
"16456050","16462110"," of their safety and infotainment systems in a car so I think there's real secular growth there and"
"16462110","16467450"," a little bit of a cyclical trade you look at Amazon the reason Amazon did so well last year is"
"16467450","16473689"," they dramatically beat earnings expectations as they rained in cost growth the announcements that"
"16473689","16479810"," we saw last week in terms of with twitch and with prime video are just another step in terms of"

"16741849","16749150"," districts basically reported moderating prices or moderating inflation uh and Steve concluded there"
"16749150","16756369"," with with a statement that in some cases companies are facing margin pressure because consumers are"
"16756369","16763330"," pushing back against higher prices that sounds like a bit of a win against inflation which would"
"16763330","16770930"," argue i guess for uh rate a rate reduction sooner rather than later i was certainly two"
"16770930","16776310"," implications there the one is what's going to happen with rates the second is what happens with"
"16776310","16783610"," margins and earnings and as as as Steve said yes there are wage increases they're maybe not as high"
"16783610","16789010"," as they were but the ability to get crisis coming down so i think margins are more likely to be"
"16789010","16794790"," under pressure whereas the markets assuming the broader index in the broader economy is and"
"16794790","16800730"," companies are going to get margin gains in 2024 to me that's the big disconnect i'd expect more"
"16800730","16806390"," margin pressure on corporate America all right uh Jim thank you very much appreciate it Jim Tierney"
"16806390","16812510"," thanks again so we've got the beige book on top of uh this morning's retail sales data and let's"
"16812510","16817550"," get to Rick Santelli to digest it all for us and how it's playing out in the bond market in"
"16817550","16824870"," the bond report hi Rick hi tyler indeed we saw strong retail sales but those are another aspect as"
"16824870","16831750"," you heard Steve discuss the beige book once again manufacturing underscored being weak utilization"
"16831750","16838950"," rates today were basically the lowest in over two years and we also had a 20 year bond auction a"
"16838950","16844730"," reopening and it was very weak investors did not show up look at a two day of 20 year and"
"16844730","16850130"," all long maturity's are very similar the reason i draw attention to this chart other than the fact"
"16850130","16856910"," that rates have gone up since the auction ended is the fact that as we sit at 443 in a"
"16856910","16865330"," 20 year yesterday's high in that security was 443 now let's look at a short maturity look at two"
"16865330","16873550"," year for two days yesterday's high was four and a quarter it's currently trading 436 it's 11 basis"
"16873550","16879290"," points above yesterday's high yield that speaks volumes about what's going on today short"
"16879290","16884910"," maturities after retail sales was strong have been leading rates higher it makes sense we're kind"
"16884910","16890930"," of pulling back on when the fed is going to ease it's all about the fed and short maturities today"
"16890930","16898150"," tens 20s and 30s are on pace the next chart shows to close at five week high yields and finally"
"16898150","16903390"," we could talk about inflation like the last guest or what Steve was discussing regarding"
"16903390","16910570"," disinflationary pressures but let's learn a lesson from the uk so many similar comments coming out"
"16910570","16917810"," except for today we see that their cpi and their ppi pop higher it's not linear there's a lesson to"
"16917810","16923730"," be learned look at a two day of 10 year guilds they closed at 398 today almost got to 4 "

"16931050","16937010"," rick a one quick follow up here as we watch the context around these bond auctions is there an"
"16937010","16943090"," indication right now you know given break even rates inflation expectations that we are seeing a"
"16943090","16947450"," bit of a balance that the expectations are ticking slightly higher and if so what's the driving"
"16947450","16952890"," force behind the uptick that we're seeing modest as it is in the beginning right now for some of"
"16952890","16959050"," those so-called break even rates well you know I think that there is some sticky inflation whether"
"16959050","16964270"," it's break even rates or how much it's going to cost the service our debt or the fact that a"
"16964270","16971550"," 10 year intraday yield was at 376 not long ago as we are looking to close around 411 I think"
"16971550","16978730"," all of those converge on a notion that especially long dated treasury yields are multifaceted"
"16978730","16984670"," there's a lot of moving parts here and as much as we can discuss disinflation be an exported from"
"16984670","16990010"," china or disinflation when you look at various companies and what's going on with consumer"
"16990010","16996970"," sentiment ultimately there is a pressure to the upside and yields mostly in mid and long maturities"
"16996970","17002630"," and the break evens they haven't reflected it in a large way yet but I would say that most of"
"17002630","17008330"," the comments especially some of the comments recently from the likes of Goldman Sachs are worried"
"17008330","17014450"," about debt and servicing the debt and it seems to be bubbling through on those long maturities and"

"17280390","17289680"," department official I can neither confirm"

"17295440","17302020"," about those reports today all right one quick follow up on that is there a sense right now that the"

"17311380","17317480"," artificial intelligence and everything else it's a great question I appreciate it so certainly this"
"17317480","17324300"," administration has prioritized restoring competition to markets across the entire u.s. economy"
"17324300","17330800"," including big tech as you know we just finished a trial late last year involving google search and"

"17337140","17342840"," it's monopoly illegally and certain digital advertising technologies so certainly we're active on"
"17342840","17348720"," that beat but we're active across the entire u.s. economy and I think google search is the most"
"17348720","17353440"," important case about the internet since the advent of the internet and I think it's really a case"

"17365220","17371520"," on the record and at hand here and that's the airline industry why exactly was what exactly was the"
"17371520","17377760"," main thrust behind why the justice department really wanted to oppose this I ask because there's a"
"17377760","17384420"," there's a narrative out there among analysts that spirit airlines if it were to stay economically"
"17384420","17389840"," viable could help that story that the DOJ is putting forth but what happens if some of these"
"17389840","17395000"," airlines no longer exist in the future what exactly does that do to the competitive landscape"
"17395000","17401300"," especially for airfares and consumer prices you know this case was really about the fact that"
"17401300","17406200"," competition between jet blue and spirit is meaningful and I think that's reflected in the judges"
"17406200","17413180"," opinion in addition to that competition the court amply found evidence that spirit helps"
"17413180","17418640"," competition across the board and brings airline prices down for the entire industry and so that"
"17418640","17424260"," means that the existence of spirit and its effect on the market helps all consumers in the united"
"17424260","17431300"," states regardless of whether you fly spirit or not I'm aware of reports around the continued"
"17431300","17437740"," financial viability of spirit and ultimately I think that's up to spirit but I will say that the"
"17437740","17443740"," companies made those arguments and federal court and ultimately our judge did not find that"
"17443740","17451600"," persuasive instead he found that spirit is a product that helps families who otherwise wouldn't be"
"17451600","17456560"," able to go on vacation it helps the college student who wouldn't be able to come home but for"
"17456560","17461220"," spirit's prices and ultimately this victory is about all of them this is about the American"
"17461220","17466240"," consumer and the ways that they benefit from vibrant and open markets including in the airline"
"17466240","17475420"," industry and so the judge was not persuaded and the argument was made at in the pleadings that that"
"17475420","17483440"," the cure might result in the death of the patient i.e. spirit airlines also again I think"
"17483440","17490740"," ultimately that's up to spirit but I think rockiness in the airline industry is just a fact of life"
"17490740","17498180"," certainly there are exogenous factors and macro trends that all of the airlines are experiencing"
"17498180","17506580"," collectively and so in any potential merger we're always thinking about the facts that are relevant"
"17506580","17513720"," to that merger and applying the law to those facts and here the fact was that spirit was still"
"17513720","17519840"," exerting competitive pressure on jet blue and other airlines I want to bring in our airline expert"
"17519840","17526540"," Phil Bo for a question or two Phil Doha my question for you is what does this say about the"
"17526540","17532260"," proposed merger between or the acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines by Alaska Airlines are you"
"17532260","17538780"," reviewing that right now and when do you expect the DOJ to say yeah we're gonna fight this or we"
"17538780","17545320"," got no issue here I appreciate the question but again I can't confirm or deny the existence of any"
"17545320","17551780"," investigation and I would say without talking about any particular company for every merger that"
"17551780","17556560"," comes before us we're always thinking about what is the competition at stake in that particular"
"17556560","17563600"," merger and we do a silver assessment of the facts and again apply the law to those facts well let"
"17563600","17567440"," me ask the question that everybody on Wall Street seems to be asking when it comes to airlines"
"17567440","17571540"," we're not talking about other mergers but we're talking about airlines Joe Biden's administration"
"17571540","17578520"," has zero interest in seeing any more consolidation is that an accurate statement you know I think"
"17578520","17584440"," that those sweeping statements are more emotional than fact-based but it is true that the president"
"17584440","17592080"," is a champion of competition and markets and issued an executive order in July 2021 that declared"
"17592080","17598140"," that it was the policy of the Biden administration to vigorously defend competition across all"
"17598140","17603200"," industries and so again we're gonna think about the facts and the law and every single merger that"
"17603200","17608280"," comes before us but thinking about airlines more broadly there's no question that airline"
"17608280","17615820"," consolidation has been a challenge we've seen prices go up and so I would remind everyone that"
"17615820","17622340"," JetBlue itself has complained about consolidation in this industry for a very long time and as we"
"17622340","17628620"," noted when we announced this merger challenge way back in March we agree with JetBlue's diagnosis"
"17628620","17635600"," but ultimately don't agree with its cure the answer for competition is not consolidation its"
"17635600","17641740"," competition and Doha we've talked a little about big technology we've talked a little bit about"
"17641740","17647020"," airlines I'd like to pivot you one more time if we could here to what's happening in healthcare"
"17647020","17652520"," there's been a lot more conversations these days about the merger and acquisitions story within"

"17957680","17962020"," with those credit waivers they've been really in battle they're based in California where demand"
"17962020","17968800"," was pulled forward under the prior net energy metering at 3.2.0 now it's a 3.0 so they've"

"19983680","19990080"," is is because jamey diamond is a risk manager first and foremost that's his job i'm glad that he's"
"19990080","19995800"," uh speaking that way i hope most people are that being said what we're experiencing right now is"
"19995800","20001960"," exactly what you should expect after a rally as blisteringly hot as the one that we just had so i"
"20001960","20005500"," want to walk you through a couple of things that we're looking at and this is what we're talking to"
"20005500","20009740"," clients about right the first is the correlation between the vicks and the ten-year is at its"
"20009740","20015680"," highest level since 2018 back when the scariest thing in our lives was the trade war remember the"
"20015680","20022480"," trade war was fun okay anyway the low point for this correlation was actually uh march of 2020 when"
"20022480","20027900"," it became a became apparent rates were going really low and not moving for a long time now we're"
"20027900","20034660"," back at a high of almost a six-year high in that correlation all that's telling us is that markets"
"20034660","20040020"," are getting a little bit shakier but for the right reason if you're seeing that ten-year note yield"
"20040020","20046400"," climb it tells you that we are further away from the fed looking to take policy down and stocks"
"20046400","20051240"," don't love that and that's perfectly fine if we were selling off for any other reason i would be"
"20051240","20056080"," singing a different tune but that's really all that's changed nothing else has changed we're back"
"20056080","20061580"," in an earnings season so far so good the bank's all had great things to say uh we've got a"
"20061580","20066940"," lot further to go but we are not experiencing a sell-off based on a risk to corporate profit so"
"20066940","20072000"," it could happen it's just not the story right now what about the idea that we may be too bold"
"20072000","20077780"," up on sentiment we may be too bold up that's killing itself it's killing itself yeah of all these"
"20077780","20084580"," interest rate cuts and maybe most of all that we're looking past evaluation that is stretched well"
"20084580","20089320"," beyond the historical average for all three of the majors and that's what us what the motor in"
"20089320","20094900"," yesterday the so-called dean evaluation said the s&p's value overvalued in his mind by nine to ten"
"20094900","20099460"," percent but that has nothing to do with what's going on this year and here's my proof the worst"
"20099460","20105940"," performing sector small caps are the lowest valuation so that is not what's that is not what the"
"20105940","20110820"," issue is small caps are now down six percent on the year they finished the fourth quarter with a"
"20110820","20115600"," fourteen percent rally almost all have been happened in the last six weeks of the year it's a"
"20115600","20119940"," little bit of a give back i want to go back to the s&p though this is important we"
"20119940","20126100"," have an we have an average daily advanced decline of 44 percent in the s&p which means on the"
"20126100","20132080"," up days almost half of all stocks are rising that's pretty good toward the end of last year was 56"
"20132080","20137980"," percent that's pretty hot that's maybe too hot so to your point there was a lot of sentiment for"
"20137980","20142880"," off people were very bold up all the surveys came out at the end of the year people got really"
"20142880","20147560"," excited we give a little bit back it's perfectly normal happens all the time maybe we're doesn't"
"20147560","20153040"," mean the top is in maybe we're giving a little bit back on our expectations as well of of what"
"20153040","20158220"," the feds going to do our cnbc senior economics correspondent steve leeceman joins us on that note"
"20158220","20165880"," because we did see the expectations of a march cut come down after that stronger than expected"
"20165880","20171440"," retail report and now of course we're waiting on williams um to make his remarks we'll have to see"
"20171440","20179000"," what he says yeah i'm not expecting uh williams here to make particularly remarks on monitoring the"
"20179000","20185120"," wire scott not seeing anything at this time uh but i really like the way josh has approached this"
"20185120","20191460"," um it's very calm it's very cool it's very collected um and i think that's where the market is"
"20191460","20197100"," right now uh scott i want to just begin talking about the change in expectations for the march rate"
"20197100","20206480"," cut before powell spoke in uh december we were around 45 46 probability of a rate cut we went all"
"20206480","20211240"," the way up that number there in the middle it was probably higher but just as an example of where"
"20211240","20217100"," we were this morning 78 76 percent and now we're back down to where we were so a lot of"
"20217100","20224080"," the froth and some of that froth obviously scott propelled the market it has come out also now take"
"20224080","20231460"," a look at the january 2025 outlook for the total rate cuts this year again we were very optimistic"
"20231460","20237400"," uh got a little bit more optimistic and now we're back to where we were so yeah about a cut"
"20237400","20243220"," uh 25 based my cut it's come out of the market this morning and i'm thinking scott that that if"
"20243220","20248060"," you think march the market thinks march i'm more in the may camp right now yeah it's interesting"
"20248060","20251960"," let's bring in lauren goodwin here's she's with us as well new york life investments chief"
"20251960","20257440"," economist and uh market strategist is that what you think and stay steve you stay with us too is"
"20257440","20262160"," that what you think has gone on here there's just been a little too much hey it's all hunky dory"
"20262160","20267480"," as diamond says or david solomon to our gang out and davos today too i think it's hard he says"
"20267480","20272060"," hard for me to see the markets view of seven cuts you know this year i do think there's reasonable"
"20272060","20277260"," possibility of some but it's really going to be dependent on what the data says but seven yeah i"
"20277260","20282060"," think that's about right if the fed is right and they're able to engineer soft landing then three's"
"20282060","20286340"," probably about right and if the recession camp which i happen to be in is right then you're"
"20286340","20291220"," probably going to see more than seven as the fed tries to catch up with slowing growth i think what"
"20291220","20296380"," the market's been grappling with though since the december meeting is that the fed spent two years"
"20296380","20301660"," talking about inflation inflation inflation data data now we're looking at data that's if anything"
"20301660","20307820"," firming a little bit and we're talking about cutting right the paradigm has has changed and i think"
"20307820","20311940"," that's appropriate but it means that the the amount of information that the fed is taking in is a"
"20311940","20315220"," little bit less straightforward for investors that's why we're seeing the the changes and"
"20315220","20319200"," expectations that we've seen in the past couple of weeks yeah and you know steve it does raise the"
"20319200","20325800"," issue of of what what could be a growing issue for the fed of you see the strong retail report"
"20325800","20332800"," and you know rates move up and you're like well the economy is still pretty strong but then some of"
"20332800","20338200"," the other data's been a little squirrely so do you really believe the strong data what is the fed"
"20338200","20344100"," really believe do they have a risk of overstaying their welcome with policy where it is now and not"
"20344100","20349280"," cutting now because they think the economy's stronger than it actually is i'm building a conundrum"
"20349280","20355400"," case you've done a good job of building it and i just can't see my way out of it Scott"
"20355400","20359580"," but i'll tell you what i think the fed is going to do let me start by showing you that"
"20359580","20368540"," i don't know i'm sorry if i don't if i don't have that chart available but take a look at"
"20368540","20375820"," the twin peaks inflation was high it fell fed cut rates and then rates and then inflation came back"
"20375820","20380840"," we have one peak right now and the fed does not want that second peak to happen so it moves"
"20380840","20387620"," slowly i think the way out of the conundrum is as follows a cut in may assuming the data is"
"20387620","20393780"," there for that rate cut which is uh you know a continued declines in inflation down towards a low"
"20393780","20399500"," level down towards a two percent target and then i think Powell pulls the old every other meeting"
"20399500","20405380"," trick out of his uh a bag right there and he goes slowly in terms of cutting rates at the"
"20405380","20411160"," advantage of this is you get your second cut in july which is i think far enough before the"
"20411160","20417080"," election where people to you know avoid that possible accusation that maybe the election is is"
"20417080","20422420"," influencing them and then that third cut Scott would come after the election actually the day after"
"20422420","20428020"," the election and the fed could take an option on a fourth cut if indeed the the economy needs it"
"20428020","20433620"," so this would be a measured approach cut let's see how the economy reacts cut let's see how the"
"20433620","20439920"," economy reacts giving it an extra meeting in between um and i think the market would be fine with"
"20439920","20445780"," that we do have to have a discussion about where ultimately the fed is going if if if growth is"
"20445780","20452000"," going to remain strong and inflation a bit above target you could have an elevated funds rate for"
"20452000","20456540"," quite some time but it doesn't have to be this elevated the way it is right now all right that"
"20456540","20461500"," sounds good the leaseman timeline that makes that makes sense to me Steve thank you and uh if"
"20461500","20465060"," Williams does say anything or shattering you know where to find us and we'll look for you there"
"20465060","20472500"," that's uh Steve leaseman our senior economics correspondent um do you care do you care how many"
"20472500","20478680"," times the fed might cut this year i mean the market which which interesting to me is as rates have"
"20478680","20485220"," ticked up and the expectations of March have come down um there has been a flight back to quality"
"20485220","20490880"," Russell's down like six percent to start the year it's way worse than the three other areas mega"
"20490880","20496120"," caps have found some stability when everybody was talking about broadening right yeah i can't think"
"20496120","20503180"," of a single economic sector the leaven sector spiders i can't think of a single one other than uh"
"20503180","20509140"," property owners the real estate sector i can't think of one other area in the economy where anyone"
"20509140","20515520"," is saying what we really need is to start cutting interest rates nobody's asking for it it's not a"
"20515520","20520900"," problem we don't have massive defaults anywhere or even an even an energy they seem to be acting"
"20520900","20527560"," responsibly it this is just not a situation where if we get three rate cuts it's devastating but if"
"20527560","20532260"," we get five everyone's gonna want to buy stocks it's just not where we are we just do not have"
"20532260","20540140"," the same level of sensitivity to short-term rates in the s&p 500 earnings quilt that maybe we had"
"20540140","20544700"," had in the 70s or in the 80s it's just a different market so if it's going to be a"
"20544700","20549520"," little more uncertain though is that why you're seeing a flight back to quality i think it's as"
"20549520","20556020"," simple as you got retail spending just going absolutely bonkers still and again this gets back to"
"20556020","20561700"," what i was saying earlier we thought the consumer would be much more sensitive to higher short-term"
"20561700","20566280"," rates and they actually ended up being they're just not they aren't especially at the high end"
"20566280","20572300"," where their bank accounts are now oozing with uh with yield people are spending like there's no"
"20572300","20577680"," tomorrow we're into like the the 12th month of this so it's really hard for me to envision a"
"20577680","20583020"," scenario where all of a sudden rate cuts are like the thing that's great for stocks what's good for"
"20583020","20587980"," stocks are the following two things this is my premise Lauren might disagree but right now this is"
"20587980","20595480"," my premise the two things that matter most fall in inflation check um rising corporate profits"
"20595480","20601580"," check if either of those two things are in peril and they might be i'll change my mind that's the"
"20601580","20605740"," current state of affairs talk me out of it talk me out of it so do you know how to"

"20609880","20616400"," talk you out of it i agree when it comes to the equity market soft landing hard landing like we're"
"20616400","20621480"," talking about little bits on on the side of zero right everybody expects economic growth to slow"
"20621480","20627160"," inflation to come down it's just a matter of degree so i'm with you there that's a a reasonable"
"20627160","20633740"," story for stocks i like core already in less in less we can't keep up with this almost 12 percent"
"20633740","20637220"," earnings growth expectation earnings growth was flat last year like i don't know how we're going to"
"20637220","20642820"," see economic growth slowing and earnings growth accelerating but more importantly what we're seeing"
"20642820","20650000"," right now in the private markets is revenues are coming are starting to come lower and companies"
"20650000","20655700"," are complaining they're screaming about how high their costs and specifically cost of capital is"
"20655700","20661320"," and so while we're in the expecting a mild recession camp i actually think that's a more optimistic"
"20661320","20667320"," scenario for capital markets than many others could be because i think you get that really you know"
"20667320","20673360"," gnarly profit eater we have not regulated in a way that i i think is important for capital okay i"
"20673360","20678900"," love that you went there we have not seen any action whatsoever in spreads when will we see those"
"20678900","20683420"," conditions that you're describing in the private market manifest themselves in the public markets"
"20683420","20688920"," when do you think that alarm might start going off well the direct answer to your question is that"
"20688920","20695640"," it starts to go off when we see signs of earnings declining or unemployment claims rising no signs"
"20695640","20702140"," inside no signs in sight it's i will say though high yield credit in the public markets is one of"

"20729600","20734220"," in recent crises because we're not going to have a financial crisis but of course as economic"
"20734220","20739040"," growth flows you could see some some widening pressure you think the s&p can withstand recession"
"20739040","20746700"," without crisis we can do that right yeah okay but that doesn't mean that you have neutral impact on"
"20746700","20750340"," valuations right i think of course no that's that's that's that's the most critical point i mean"
"20750340","20756460"," yeah yes can it maybe i don't know if it's you know so definitive is yes or no maybe but"
"20757180","20762320"," do you think this market is priced for a recession no no of course not certainly not and it's"

"20789240","20794880"," and then we start exceeding again the bears hate that um that happens all time uh isn't that a"
"20794880","20801240"," possible scenario here uh and do you think things like AI like does that is that the reason why we"
"20801240","20808120"," could do 10 percent earning school 12 percent even as unlikely as it seems now yeah but isn't that"
"20808120","20813140"," a bit what we saw last year you know it's yes when i when i look at the profits environment"
"20813140","20818740"," for companies the way that fed rate hikes work is that they impact housing and the manufacturing"
"20818740","20824320"," and services and only then do they really start to impact profits right so that we haven't had a"
"20824320","20830420"," real sticky problem yet isn't surprising but these these things tend to compound on themselves so"
"20830420","20835880"," if i saw some of those leading economic indicators start to perk back up so i saw bank lending"
"20835880","20841700"," standards loosen i saw pmi start to move above 50 then i would get off of the horse i've been"

"20864680","20872320"," of october to the end of the year was anything more than just a positioning race till the end of"
"20872320","20879560"," the year to just try and get something out of what was nothing or was it actually built on some"
"20879560","20885040"," substantive thing that had a lot of people viewed viewing the market this year as that was the"

"20889840","20895060"," anything substantive i think it was as simple as we had record bearish positioning i don't care how"
"20895060","20899360"," you want to slice it you want to look at institutional investor surveys you want to look at how"

"21594410","21599190"," four percent but we're in a situation where you've got a number of businesses that have been"

"21629850","21634950"," not going away right and so the concern i have in the debt market is specifically around the fact"
"21634950","21641590"," that you could see a crowding out effect when all this treasury issuance and all of these"
"21641590","21647210"," refinancing start coming into the market pushing yields even higher because we really see that as"
"21647210","21650950"," the thing that's driving the market i mean josh hit on that as well with regards to volatility"
"21650950","21656430"," correlating with regards to the 10 year i think the good thing that we could see is if we do"
"21656430","21663650"," see stabilization within rates you've got a lot of dry powder sitting out on the sidelines yeah you"
"21663650","21670510"," could start seeing some m&a aren't we already seeing the the so-called green shoots of that right i"
"21670510","21674370"," mean rates have stabilized rates are we have stabilized well they were stabilized but now they're"
"21674370","21678330"," starting to shoot up again right because of the concern with regards to everyone expecting this"
"21678330","21683650"," rate cut in march that is now not necessarily looking as rosy and to your point i think if you"
"21683650","21688530"," look at fourth quarter so much of that performance was chasing right chasing and chasing and"
"21688530","21693790"," chasing and now people are like wait do i really want to own this thing at this level and if"
"21693790","21698030"," rates are starting to go higher you're going to get a lot of weekends selling in this market what's"
"21698030","21704610"," the best what's your best invest client calls you up says the market's been going up a lot what are"
"21704610","21709190"," we doing what are you doing what's the best play so i think i think the two areas that we"
"21709190","21714230"," really like if you look at equities we think it's probably going to be a sub-optimal return and"
"21714230","21718830"," there's other alternatives now that rates have gone higher we do still like private credit where"
"21718830","21723750"," you're at the top of the capital stack and you're collecting very aggressive cash double digit"
"21723750","21728990"," returns got it yep right and then the other area that we're starting to see some opportunities are"
"21728990","21734070"," within triple net lease with regards to businesses that are going to have to start selling critical"
"21734070","21740290"," assets that we're getting long-term leases and getting another eight percent the one big issue for"
"21740290","21745910"," investors is the the breakdown between the bond market and the equity market right it used to be"
"21745910","21749910"," when equities were selling off bonds would do well and we're in a situation where they're"
"21749910","21755430"," correlating again very well we've had historic rallies in both in november and and now as bonds are"
"21755430","21760070"," selling off equities are selling off so where do you get that diversification so you really need to"
"21760070","21764470"," start looking at other alternatives in order to get that diversification so you're telling me you"
"21764470","21769230"," don't like anything in the equity market no we do like equities we do have positions in equities i"
"21769230","21773990"," think it's going to be a bifurcated market so to your point i think you've seen this rally in"
"21773990","21779470"," quality very aggressively right and i think companies that are doing well are going to continue to"
"21779470","21784170"," be rewarded your point with regards to you know the Russell 2000 being cheap it's cheap for a"
"21784170","21787790"," reason a lot of these sectors are cheap for a reason because they're not growing their earnings no"
"21787790","21791590"," and the leverage that's the case i was trying to make on a half time report today as well yes"
"21791590","21797450"," of course it it's cheaper but it's cheap for a reason right and these these asset classes are going"
"21797450","21802570"," to have a real problem when they have to start uh re uh refinancing a lot of this debt so"
"21802570","21807250"," from our standpoint you really need to be very specific with where you're investing i think there"
"21807250","21811390"," are some areas in small cap that are going to be particularly interesting particularly with regards"
"21811390","21814930"," to mna but i do think you want to hold on to quality here you make me we're going to"

"22064060","22068160"," was just you think it was too much hype or did you look at it and say no it's totally"
"22068160","22074440"," justified this is a transformative technology the kind of guidance that people like in vidia gave"
"22074440","22080980"," out was just astonishing it was too much hype across the board where people said a is going to lift"

"22097480","22101820"," that's the one i really got my eye on this year because for better or worse i mean you see"
"22101820","22108100"," there's at least been some divergence between the performance right apple seems to be under a"
"22108100","22113340"," little more scrutiny this year whereas kind of everything went up last year and vidia's run again"
"22113340","22117720"," right now has been remarkable in and of itself the stock just keeps going up well this in vidia has"
"22117720","22122660"," great fundamentals right they were blowing through their guidance people are still on the AI train"
"22122660","22126340"," and haven't figured out what's really going to be for them but they feel like they need to get as"
"22126340","22133260"," much as they can through vidia you know apple they're PE doubled last year but sales were down and"
"22133260","22137680"," you know now you're seeing some troubles in china some other things maybe that was a little bit"
"22137680","22142440"," overblown if you look at the fundamentals they already saw more phones anyone else in the world how"
"22142440","22147260"," many more phones could they sell whereas someone like microsoft now integrating things like"
