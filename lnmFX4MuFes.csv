"lnmFX4MuFes","292000","295000"," We went through it yesterday. It was scary, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","295000","297000"," It's not something."
"lnmFX4MuFes","297000","302000"," It's kind of like, you know, do I diamond hand this?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","302000","305000"," Do I take the profit off this top resistance?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","305000","311000"," We saw the roll down coming, but I had full confidence."
"lnmFX4MuFes","311000","316000"," I knew what was coming."
"lnmFX4MuFes","316000","322000"," I was in a meeting two days ago."

"lnmFX4MuFes","373000","377000"," All their shit looks great."
"lnmFX4MuFes","377000","381000"," Everything is well crafted for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","381000","387000"," I got a fucking at the source up at all times."
"lnmFX4MuFes","387000","392000"," Like going through invest to be like, Oh, there's big words, man. I got a guy on staff over here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","392000","395000"," All he does is write down all these complicated shit, these words and shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","395000","398000"," We just pumped them up to motherfuckers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","398000","403000"," And they just like drink it up all day long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","403000","407000"," And they eat it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","407000","411000"," And they love it. They pay every month."
"lnmFX4MuFes","411000","413000"," They tell all their friends."
"lnmFX4MuFes","413000","418000"," You tell them what's going to happen? Fuck. No, we just make a really complicated form."
"lnmFX4MuFes","418000","425000"," I think they're like at the crystal ball and shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","425000","431000"," That's the difference between making fucking money and being smart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","431000","437000"," Be smart all day long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","437000","442000"," Be smart as you want."
"lnmFX4MuFes","442000","446000"," And even if you're doing complicated trades, you still dumb that shit down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","446000","451000"," One of my best fucking friends out here, a guy named Scott."
"lnmFX4MuFes","451000","455000"," You know what he does all day long? Smart as fuck. You know what he does all day long?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","455000","461000"," Scowers, option chains. That's what he does all day long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","461000","473000"," Nothing complicated about that. Pretty simple."
"lnmFX4MuFes","473000","477000"," You'll go that morning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","477000","484000"," Try to pinch myself right now. And there's a second part to this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","484000","490000"," Yeah, I posted on Finchwood just a minute ago. These are directional trades."
"lnmFX4MuFes","490000","494000"," You take the money and run. You renegotiate."
"lnmFX4MuFes","494000","503000"," You get something worth $1.20, $30, $40, $50, $4.41 trading $2.12 right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","503000","507000"," Take the money off that. You reenter something that's $0.24."
"lnmFX4MuFes","507000","513000"," You realize those gains."
"lnmFX4MuFes","513000","517000"," Put that money in your pocket that keeps you alive for the next time."
"lnmFX4MuFes","517000","521000"," You know, I have a conversations with a few close friends here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","521000","524000"," And I know some of you out there, what you're doing, not all of you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","524000","527000"," But I know some of you are like, no, I got a thousand bucks."
"lnmFX4MuFes","527000","531000"," I turned it into 5,000. Now I'm trading 5,000 bucks."
"lnmFX4MuFes","531000","536000"," Right? It's like roll 100% of the next trade until it blows up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","536000","540000"," Roll 100%. You have to do that shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","540000","542000"," You make a winning trade. You take some off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","542000","546000"," You go back to the beginning and you renegotiate."
"lnmFX4MuFes","546000","550000"," It keeps you alive."
"lnmFX4MuFes","550000","553000"," And you should eventually, after you're done building an account,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","553000","557000"," go back down to like 0.01% of your account, your trading."
"lnmFX4MuFes","557000","563000"," In sizing up, man, I'm telling you, I've gotten so fucking torch doing that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","563000","569000"," There's a time when all my trades were 30, 40, 50,000."
"lnmFX4MuFes","569000","574000"," I should, I should, you know, $100,000 trades one after another."
"lnmFX4MuFes","574000","577000"," And they fucking found out who I was. People say that people,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","577000","580000"," I swear to God, people say, people say you're crazy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","580000","584000"," I'm like, fuck you. They fucking knew me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","584000","588000"," And I still to this day believe that they're correlating people with size."
"lnmFX4MuFes","588000","590000"," And they're like, all these are in this pile here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","590000","592000"," And all these are in this pile here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","592000","595000"," And I'd be getting taken for a ride, directionally correct."
"lnmFX4MuFes","595000","599000"," And then I would see the slippage on such a size that I'd be like,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","599000","603000"," the fuck guys, like five grand to place this fucking trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","603000","605000"," 15 grand to place this fucking trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","605000","607000"," Like you're joking me, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","607000","610000"," So I think there, I think there's even that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","610000","614000"," Like there's this bit of shenanigans in the background."
"lnmFX4MuFes","614000","619000"," And once I was able to hide my shed, it was easier."
"lnmFX4MuFes","619000","624000"," Actually, I have a few trades that I think I saw once on one of these order flow sites."
"lnmFX4MuFes","624000","627000"," So I'm like, man, I'll be like."
"lnmFX4MuFes","627000","631000"," Anyways, you don't need to size to."
"lnmFX4MuFes","631000","635000"," Trading, you know, $300,000, $100,000 a fucking trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","635000","637000"," And I'm going to tell you what it's something else."
"lnmFX4MuFes","637000","638000"," If you are."
"lnmFX4MuFes","638000","642000"," Dude, like there's no way you should be losing all that because I've done it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","642000","647000"," I've lost six figures in trades. I was fucking pigheaded."
"lnmFX4MuFes","647000","651000"," So if anything, you need to stop loss."
"lnmFX4MuFes","651000","652000"," All right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","652000","654000"," If you're trading that kind of size."
"lnmFX4MuFes","654000","655000"," Now I break it up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","655000","657000"," I'm like, hey, a little over there, a little over here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","657000","658000"," You can't see me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","658000","659000"," That kind of stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","659000","662000"," But that's my own like, um, gambler's fallacy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","662000","666000"," Um, was it like, um, not intuition."
"lnmFX4MuFes","666000","674000"," It's like, um, uh, whatever you call when you have like a, I believe in ghosts and shit like that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","674000","678000"," But, um, what a great fucking morning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","678000","681000"," Here's your red box."
"lnmFX4MuFes","681000","685000"," Here's your return to the scene of the crime."
"lnmFX4MuFes","685000","687000"," You're going to find sellers here. Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","687000","690000"," I want you to know that the sellers are here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","690000","694000"," Can we trade above it? Yes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","694000","696000"," Uh, we can."
"lnmFX4MuFes","696000","699000"," But I want you to know that they're here. They're right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","699000","702000"," Right where my cursor is."
"lnmFX4MuFes","702000","705000"," I want you to see them up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","706000","710000"," They're going to be right at that 44313. They're going to be right up in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","710000","714000"," Uh, this is a place to take actual profit here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","714000","717000"," Uh, you're going to find a big grind in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","717000","719000"," You're going to find sellers. Step it in."
"lnmFX4MuFes","719000","726000"," And, uh, you want to be, if you wanted to go long again, you'd go long above this 44401."
"lnmFX4MuFes","726000","729000"," You want to see the break above consolidation."
"lnmFX4MuFes","729000","732000"," This is an entirely new thing up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","733000","735000"," We're coming into it right now. You see it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","735000","737000"," You see it right here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","737000","739000"," It's a little bit lower. Looks like they've come down a little bit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","739000","741000"," Just want you to see that they're here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","744000","748000"," Another thing that we need is we need call expansion."
"lnmFX4MuFes","748000","751000"," We talk about that too, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","751000","755000"," And I haven't checked in the past few minutes on the JPM caller with that trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","755000","758000"," It's going to be able to look for it here in a few minutes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","758000","760000"," Um, and I'm going on vacation. I was supposed to actually,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","760000","762000"," I'm like running around in the background."
"lnmFX4MuFes","762000","767000"," My wife's like, my wife's like, you know, like a bomb just went off and I'm like,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","767000","770000"," God damn it. Like just they were leaving. Come on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","770000","774000"," You know, that's why I was a little late this morning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","774000","776000"," I'm like trying to close out my trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","776000","781000"," I'm trying to talk to the wife and the kids and all that kind of stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","781000","783000"," Congratulations to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","783000","785000"," I hope you made money."
"lnmFX4MuFes","785000","788000"," I want to pinch myself over this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","789000","793000"," Do you guys remember when people were saying we're going to crash just a week ago?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","793000","797000"," Do you remember when people are out there saying we're going to crash yesterday?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","797000","800000"," These motherfuckers charging like hundred bucks, six hundred dollars."
"lnmFX4MuFes","800000","804000"," I know some of those guys like 200 300 fucking 500."
"lnmFX4MuFes","804000","808000"," And they, some of those guys, I'm not going to name names used to never make a call."
"lnmFX4MuFes","808000","812000"," They would just like leave it really, really like hazy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","812000","815000"," And they kind of got called out for it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","816000","821000"," So they started making calls and you fucking find out that they can't make a fucking call."
"lnmFX4MuFes","822000","827000"," They're not in that fucking business of trade and they're in that fucking business of selling you shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","830000","832000"," They get paid either way."
"lnmFX4MuFes","832000","843000"," It's be aware of them."
"lnmFX4MuFes","843000","844000"," They're up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","844000","846000"," They're up in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","846000","847000"," They're there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","847000","849000"," There's swimming around up in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","849000","853000"," But we're going to talk about what this means up here to right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","853000","854000"," You want to know?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","854000","855000"," I'll tell you right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","855000","860000"," So we're going to have a little chat here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","861000","864000"," It's an important one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","864000","869000"," I want you to see previous examples."
"lnmFX4MuFes","869000","871000"," See where we are right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","871000","873000"," There's your 441 right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","873000","879000"," I want to see something."
"lnmFX4MuFes","879000","881000"," This is a big thing up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","884000","888000"," What I want to talk to you about was another, there's another target back here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","888000","889000"," Yeah."
"lnmFX4MuFes","889000","890000"," Valhalla baby."
"lnmFX4MuFes","890000","892000"," But I want to talk to you about this specifically."
"lnmFX4MuFes","892000","898000"," This point here, this return to the scene of the crime, 443.89 or so, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","898000","901000"," If you're a bull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","901000","903000"," You are looking for today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","903000","907000"," You ready for it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","907000","910000"," You as a bull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","910000","916000"," Are looking."
"lnmFX4MuFes","917000","920000"," For the trade up right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","920000","924000"," Up and over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","924000","929000"," I know it's going to, you're going to pinch yourself with me telling you that, but."
"lnmFX4MuFes","929000","931000"," You should leave some runners on for it too."
"lnmFX4MuFes","931000","934000"," And I'm going to explain to you why right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","934000","937000"," I've got some runners on for it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","937000","941000"," And the reason I'm saying this too is because."
"lnmFX4MuFes","941000","945000"," Even if we get a pullback."
"lnmFX4MuFes","946000","949000"," Down the road here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","949000","951000"," Bulls want to see that, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","951000","957000"," They want to see new high consolidation, even if we roll over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","957000","960000"," For us to continue higher."
"lnmFX4MuFes","960000","967000"," If you're of the belief that we are going to either fail all time highs."
"lnmFX4MuFes","967000","970000"," Or we're going to 6,000."
"lnmFX4MuFes","970000","972000"," We won't fail this right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","972000","976000"," I assure you that we won't."
"lnmFX4MuFes","976000","980000"," We might have a pullback, but we ain't going to fail."
"lnmFX4MuFes","980000","982000"," This is where your double tops come in."
"lnmFX4MuFes","982000","986000"," The failure to get a new high."
"lnmFX4MuFes","986000","988000"," So if you're bullish out there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","988000","993000"," We are going there right fucking now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","994000","1001000"," Even though these sellers are here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1001000","1003000"," See him right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1003000","1006000"," They're right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1006000","1012000"," And they're right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1012000","1017000"," Right as long as we get up here, even if we pull back."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1017000","1021000"," This is going to negate your double top."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1021000","1023000"," This is going to panic people."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1023000","1027000"," I'm going to show you some previous examples of that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1027000","1031000"," There's one right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1031000","1035000"," Here's one right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1035000","1037000"," See that?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1037000","1039000"," Failure, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1039000","1040000"," Around 1230 in the afternoon."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1040000","1041000"," But what happens?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1041000","1043000"," We pull back."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1043000","1046000"," And we actually go up and get a new high on the close."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1046000","1050000"," See that right there, that close?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1050000","1052000"," Then we go up some more, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1052000","1054000"," When you see that kind of stuff, it's very powerful."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1054000","1057000"," I'm going to see an example of it right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1057000","1060000"," Go down there, boom, tag the new high."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1060000","1063000"," And then it's an explosive move higher afterwards, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1063000","1065000"," See the explosive move afterwards."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1065000","1067000"," So just even right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1067000","1071000"," We have another day, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1071000","1078000"," We have through 4th of July, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1078000","1082000"," So just this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1082000","1087000"," Whether we get this tag first time, pull back."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1087000","1091000"," And then get it afterwards today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1091000","1094000"," That sets us up for what?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1094000","1098000"," Over the long holiday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1098000","1100000"," Big moves."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1100000","1105000"," Now we need to get a bunch of people buying calls higher."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1106000","1110000"," I know this is crazy to say to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1110000","1112000"," And for 70s."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1112000","1117000"," Any people just like buying fucking like six months out for 60s."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1117000","1124000"," You need to see hedges coming out today saying we can go higher."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1124000","1127000"," We might not get there right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1127000","1130000"," We might not get to 4.70s."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1130000","1134000"," We might not get there right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1134000","1139000"," We might not get to 4.60 right now up there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1139000","1145000"," But by July 5th, we might 6th."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1145000","1150000"," You might get there by like, I'm sure you not."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1150000","1152000"," And then you get the bigger rollover."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1152000","1157000"," So this is key here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1157000","1160000"," It's key."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1160000","1161000"," And look at us."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1161000","1175000"," We're going up there right now, trading 4.43.01 right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1175000","1176000"," Can't believe I'm trading fucking."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1176000","1187000"," I'm not even going to be here in like, when I'm going to be here in about a half an hour."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1187000","1189000"," So it's important for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1189000","1193000"," Right now to."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1193000","1200000"," It's important for you right now to."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1200000","1202000"," Look at that fucking baby."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1202000","1204000"," Look at that beautiful."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1204000","1205000"," God damn."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1205000","1209000"," Sorry."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1209000","1215000"," We could get down my ass."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1215000","1216000"," Oh man, right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1216000","1219000"," You could see it happening."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1219000","1220000"," Right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1220000","1223000"," Ooh."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1223000","1225000"," God damn."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1225000","1233000"," So we're looking for that today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1233000","1240000"," We're going to be looking to see if we can break above right now or the close today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1240000","1242000"," If we do."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1242000","1247000"," You know what the likely move is coming into the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1247000","1248000"," 4.48 and 4.50."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1248000","1252000"," I'll show you not or at least like, at least like a dip up here somewhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1252000","1255000"," I get something like a 30 delta or something like that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1255000","1259000"," But you're all your eyes should be on this right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1259000","1262000"," All your eyes right now should be."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1262000","1265000"," If we get up there and we hold this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1265000","1269000"," The high though is the big one 4.43.89."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1269000","1272000"," We tag that shit right now, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1272000","1274000"," It's not bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1274000","1276000"," We can roll hard and heavy, but."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1276000","1280000"," It's not normally what happens on these time frames."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1280000","1284000"," Normally we consolidate and we have another extension afterwards."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1284000","1287000"," So."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1287000","1290000"," I have a fucking 98 cents right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1290000","1291000"," It's a fucking calls."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1291000","1293000"," I mean, what the fuck."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1293000","1295000"," I'm in the money in the money right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1295000","1296000"," I'll get to take some off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1296000","1298000"," Hold on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1298000","1300000"," I'm going to take somebody off the table."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1300000","1304000"," But look at that shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1304000","1307000"," Just beast mode right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1307000","1315000"," Oh shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1315000","1322000"," All right, I'm flat."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1322000","1326000"," I'm flat."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1326000","1330000"," We're good."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1330000","1335000"," Look at that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1335000","1339000"," Trading 443 14 right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1339000","1341000"," I'm going to get rid of this box."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1341000","1345000"," Maybe just so you can have a clear idea of Jesus fucking a."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1345000","1347000"," We're going to get rid of this box for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1347000","1349000"," Bam right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1349000","1351000"," There is the first target."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1351000","1353000"," We are at ST Excel."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1353000","1355000"," If you don't know what that is, I don't post those for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1356000","1359000"," This is a should write this out here for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1361000","1363000"," It's called ST Excel."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1369000","1371000"," We're right up in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1371000","1373000"," Sure are three ST Excel."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1373000","1375000"," Personally, I think it's right here, but."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1379000","1382000"," And also write a PT three up here if you like."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1383000","1390000"," PT three."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1390000","1395000"," PT two."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1395000","1404000"," And this is PT one right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1404000","1406000"," So there you go."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1406000","1409000"," One two and three."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1409000","1412000"," We'll just throw it right up to the top to be top there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1412000","1414000"," Trading 443 16."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1414000","1417000"," Now let's talk about where we are right now in the market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1417000","1420000"," What do we do?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1420000","1424000"," You guys know what we do, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1424000","1427000"," There's a one minute chart right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1427000","1430000"," This is the fascinating thing about what we do."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1430000","1438000"," Oftentimes, I'll hear people on Fintuit say, I don't know how you're long up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1438000","1442000"," I don't know how you do it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1442000","1447000"," And we keep it pretty simple, don't we?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1447000","1452000"," We keep it fairly simple around these parts, don't we?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1452000","1457000"," As long as price is above the twenty seven EMA, we're long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1457000","1462000"," As long as price above the six in the six is vertical, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1462000","1464000"," I want you to see something right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1464000","1466000"," That yellow line, that yellow line is at an angle."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1466000","1468000"," It's not sideways, is it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1468000","1471000"," It's not down, is it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1471000","1477000"," So the more vertical that line is, the more bullish we are."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1477000","1478000"," Came back down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1478000","1479000"," Check the five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1479000","1480000"," Check the five again."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1480000","1481000"," And what does that do?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1481000","1484000"," One, two, boom, to the upside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1484000","1487000"," Is the yellow line turning sideways yet?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1487000","1489000"," No."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1489000","1492000"," So that's still bullish, isn't it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1492000","1495000"," We use the clock every fifteen minutes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1495000","1498000"," We're looking for new highs every fifteen minutes, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1498000","1499000"," Do we get a new high?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1499000","1500000"," Do we not get a new high?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1500000","1504000"," Do we feel good, new high?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1504000","1510000"," We can track every fifteen half an hour if we're bullish or bearish or neutral, can't we?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1510000","1513000"," So we stick with our fucking rules."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1513000","1516000"," It doesn't matter if we're going straight to the moon."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1516000","1520000"," It doesn't matter if we're going to the depths of hell."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1520000","1521000"," We've got our fucking rules."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1521000","1528000"," Our fucking rules work in every situation."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1528000","1534000"," Trading 443.20 right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1534000","1536000"," As long as we retest this, we're still alive."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1536000","1538000"," What else are we alive on right now?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1538000","1541000"," Any successful retest of 442.78?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1541000","1544000"," Guess what we are."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1544000","1549000"," We're bullish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1549000","1554000"," And this works in the reverse as well."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1554000","1556000"," This works when we're going down, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1556000","1559000"," You see the yellow line going straight down, we're bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1559000","1561000"," Yellow line starts going sideways, we're neutral."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1561000","1564000"," Yellow line starts going up, we're bullish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1564000","1567000"," We can look at it on multi-time frames, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1567000","1572000"," An hour, a day, thirty minute, fifteen minute, whatever."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1572000","1576000"," Trading 443.30, too, right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1576000","1583000"," New high."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1583000","1588000"," All these things that we go over inside of this stream are all,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1588000","1593000"," we go over these every day over and over and over and over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1593000","1596000"," Do you know why?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1596000","1600000"," So that you can put them together when you're trading and you say,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1600000","1605000"," I got a fucking chest of tools here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1605000","1608000"," That work in every situation."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1608000","1613000"," I don't get caught in the box, right, and get all cut up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1613000","1616000"," I wait for the confirmation to go down, I jump on it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1616000","1622000"," Wait for the confirmation to go up and I jump on it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1622000","1625000"," You want to know the fucking magic?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1625000","1630000"," That hourly fucking triggers magic, isn't it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1630000","1634000"," Because you and I both know."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1634000","1638000"," You and I both know that like three quarters of Fintuit don't have that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1638000","1642000"," They don't see that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1642000","1644000"," And they're like, why no crash right now?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1644000","1647000"," You got guys that are floor traders and the fucking,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1647000","1651000"," floor traders, I'm not going to name names."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1651000","1657000"," It's going to crash right here and it held, but don't have that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1658000","1663000"," All last week, we were pulling back every day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1663000","1665000"," I came out and I type on the screen."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1665000","1667000"," What did I type for you on the screen?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1667000","1672000"," Said, said sellers are likely right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1672000","1675000"," I remember I was like bull trap right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1675000","1677000"," We were trading under the hourly trigger."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1677000","1683000"," We teed off that fucking hourly trigger every fucking day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1684000","1686000"," So we've got the fucking edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1686000","1688000"," I've got the edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1688000","1690000"," You've got the edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1690000","1698000"," We got the edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1699000","1700000"," I've got the edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1700000","1703000"," You've got the edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1703000","1710000"," We got the edge."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1710000","1712000"," Hold on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1712000","1713000"," My phone's ringing."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1713000","1715000"," Mr. Johnson's in the background ringing me up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1715000","1717000"," Hold on a second here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1717000","1718000"," My phone's in another room."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1718000","1720000"," Look at my phone because my phone is probably blowing up right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1720000","1721000"," Hold on a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1728000","1731000"," Hold on a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1759000","1766000"," Do me a solid out there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1766000","1767000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1767000","1769000"," So the first thing's first ready."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1769000","1772000"," So we're coming back to now retest."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1772000","1776000"," The little white squiggly line here to one minute chart, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1776000","1781000"," This is to retest if we still have buyers here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1781000","1785000"," Sellers are stepping in above."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1786000","1793000"," Supply is here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1793000","1796000"," And what they're going to do on this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1796000","1802000"," What they're going to do on this PT2 is they're here in PT2 saying we're selling, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1802000","1805000"," We need to find out if smart money is still here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1805000","1808000"," Not smart money, but demand basically."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1808000","1811000"," See the sellers coming in down below right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1811000","1813000"," And what do they want to do here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1813000","1815000"," We already know what they want, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1815000","1820000"," They want to have a closing bar underneath the white line, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1820000","1824000"," See this green bar right here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1824000","1826000"," Watch that green bar right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1826000","1831000"," They want a failure of that green bar below the white line."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1831000","1833000"," Let's look at it in a five minute chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1833000","1836000"," See it right here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1836000","1838000"," They want a closure."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1838000","1842000"," They want to close below the six."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1842000","1845000"," And they want to drag it back down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1845000","1850000"," There's a five minute chart now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1850000","1853000"," And there is your R3 right here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1853000","1858000"," So we're going to go back to this one minute chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1858000","1860000"," And what are we finding out?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1860000","1864000"," What can we discern from this?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1864000","1866000"," So far the green, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1866000","1868000"," The buyers are pretty strong here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1868000","1871000"," They're not fully strong, but they're pretty fucking strong here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1871000","1878000"," We're going to watch this here and see what happens."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1878000","1880000"," We know about what this box is right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1880000","1882000"," We draw these out every day with you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1882000","1884000"," It is every day with you because I love you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1884000","1886000"," Every single day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1886000","1890000"," We draw that box in, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1890000","1894000"," We draw that box in, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1894000","1895000"," And look at this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1895000","1897000"," One green bar, another green bar."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1897000","1902000"," I don't think sellers might not be in control yet, huh?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1902000","1906000"," We always talk about not getting caught in here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1906000","1910000"," Because where you get ground to dust in here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1910000","1913000"," Your options get torn up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1913000","1917000"," And one other thing, on this rollover,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1917000","1924000"," you almost always get a chance to unfuck yourself in here if you need to."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1924000","1926000"," At least one chance."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1926000","1927000"," A little bit of breathing room."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1927000","1928000"," I talked to you about it on the stream ago."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1928000","1930000"," It's like when we're done buying, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1930000","1931000"," We're rolling over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1931000","1932000"," It's like you roll it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1932000","1934000"," You let them up for some air."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1934000","1935000"," They go."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1935000","1939000"," And then you drown them again."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1939000","1941000"," It's never just straight down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1941000","1947000"," Sometimes it is like maybe once a year, twice a year."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1947000","1952000"," At least get a chance to reposition or actually take your profit"
"lnmFX4MuFes","1952000","1957000"," and look for another entry."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1957000","1964000"," It's not what a bear wants to see right here, a seller."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1964000","1971000"," We also know that retail is in control today to some extent."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1971000","1978000"," We also know that retailers are generally bulls."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1979000","1986000"," We also know in times like this, they can take over and go wild."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1986000","1988000"," I am going to recommend something to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1988000","1990000"," If you have the chance to long this shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1990000","1996000"," That you're able to close your shit before we get to month or Wednesday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1996000","1999000"," You can like go in futures on Tuesday night or something."
"lnmFX4MuFes","1999000","2000000"," What day is that?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2000000","2003000"," What day is that?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2003000","2006000"," Like on the on the fourth and between the fourth and the fifth,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2006000","2007000"," you just like boom sell."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2007000","2014000"," Before you ever get to cash market on Wednesday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2014000","2020000"," We know that in this chop zone here, if you're looking for this PT three."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2020000","2023000"," That you can usually tell when the sellers are overrun."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2023000","2025000"," We'll bounce back and forth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2025000","2028000"," We break above and hold one bar."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2028000","2034000"," The moment that happens, you watch that yellow line come up here and you're already fucking"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2034000","2036000"," got the calls set up and you go."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2036000","2037000"," Slend the buy button."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2037000","2040000"," We start going bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2040000","2043000"," You took the juice of the trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2043000","2045000"," The meat of the trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2045000","2050000"," You get caught up with this, this shit in here, did you?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2050000","2054000"," You also know that if you're long back here going up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2054000","2057000"," In the initial pullback down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2057000","2061000"," That's not bearish until what happens."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2062000","2067000"," You get a closing red bar underneath."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2067000","2068000"," Right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2068000","2070000"," You need that closing red bar underneath."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2070000","2073000"," You need the failure of the buyers to buy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2073000","2075000"," You need to see all that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2075000","2076000"," Right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2076000","2077000"," Then it'll bleed down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2077000","2083000"," Come back up one more time and then bam, you're to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2083000","2089000"," We also know in the women at chart that we're not even bearish here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2089000","2090000"," You're bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2090000","2097000"," Your big trade is below 441.84."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2097000","2106000"," And even then, even then you have work to do."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2106000","2108000"," You got to literally take it down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2108000","2109000"," I'll show you now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2109000","2117000"," You're going to take it down to 438.67."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2117000","2119000"," You need to take it down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2119000","2129000"," You read this crazy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2129000","2143000"," Let me show you where you get bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2144000","2145000"," Here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2145000","2152000"," Below this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2152000","2155000"," What's even more wild."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2155000","2158000"," Is that we could close this gap down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2158000","2161000"," We could literally roll this over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2161000","2162000"," Bounce."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2162000","2166000"," And we're still bullish in trend."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2166000","2172000"," That's insane, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2173000","2181000"," You literally need to close below 436 and change."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2181000","2187000"," Yeah, like, like you need to break below this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2187000","2189000"," And you can't come back up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2189000","2201000"," You got to break below this and do that shit to even change trend."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2201000","2204000"," You got to break below that is."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2204000","2207000"," Especially these fucking bears like."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2207000","2221000"," Calling up their moms and they're like, okay, mom, I just need a loan for a thousand bucks. This is it."

"lnmFX4MuFes","2466000","2472000"," They feed into an inexperienced mind."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2472000","2476000"," Maybe someone's got a few wins under their belt."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2476000","2483000"," That's just starting to see through the veil of what the stock market is."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2483000","2486000"," Maybe they lost a big trade and they're getting salty."

"lnmFX4MuFes","2742000","2745000"," Captain Jim fucking James."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2746000","2748000"," You know why?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2750000","2753000"," Because we fucking trade, man."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2762000","2764000"," Those guys aren't going to tell you they follow me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2764000","2766000"," That they follow Jedi."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2766000","2769000"," That they follow fucking short seller ST."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2769000","2772000"," They're not going to tell their followers that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2776000","2785000"," It's their secret."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2785000","2787000"," Fun strat."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2787000","2789000"," What's up brother?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2794000","2798000"," They're going to tell their followers they follow guys like us."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2798000","2801000"," They want to make money."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2806000","2811000"," Dude, super bull old man right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2811000","2815000"," The fed and big primes pay streamers to sell vol"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2815000","2819000"," and promote the opposite side of the big guy's trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2819000","2822000"," Help with demand destruction."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2827000","2828000"," I think Maggie's trying to."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2828000","2829000"," I should get Maggie down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2829000","2830000"," Hold on a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2830000","2831000"," I'm going to tell you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2831000","2832000"," I'm taking these girls out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2832000","2833000"," I got to tell you guys some."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2833000","2835000"," So you guys donated this week, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2835000","2836000"," I'm taking these kids out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2836000","2838000"," They're going big."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2838000","2841000"," Like I'm taking them over to, they're going to like some concerts"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2841000","2845000"," and then they're going to pull a bunch of stuff like zip lines"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2845000","2848000"," and I'm just going to get the girls in here for the 4th of July"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2848000","2849000"," and just say hello."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2849000","2851000"," Hold on a second here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2864000","2866000"," Give me just a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2866000","2868000"," Look at him trying to sell this down, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2868000","2870000"," So what do we know about right here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2870000","2877000"," We know that if we roll, you get a chance to unfuck yourself, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2877000","2878000"," I just said this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2878000","2880000"," Rewind the program."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2880000","2884000"," When we roll down to this line, what happens?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2884000","2886000"," You get a chance unfuck yourself, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2886000","2887000"," There's your chance."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2887000","2889000"," Unfuck yourself, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2889000","2892000"," You know that this is the death box for bulls and bears"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2892000","2893000"," in here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2893000","2896000"," Now if we break above and we get a green candle that holds up here,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2896000","2900000"," closing green candle, we know we can set up a long trade, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2900000","2902000"," We just went over that, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2902000","2908000"," I said to you, if we roll below and we have a closing candle below,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2908000","2910000"," what does that mean?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2910000","2913000"," Means we're likely going to go down and see the next box, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2913000","2915000"," So let's look at that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2915000","2917000"," Here's the box that travels."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2917000","2919000"," I wish this was attached, by the way."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2920000","2923000"," And so now that we're down here, we've got one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2923000","2924000"," Push down, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2924000","2925000"," Here's one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2925000","2926000"," Watch."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2926000","2927000"," One."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2927000","2928000"," Two."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2928000","2931000"," And then we're going to go three right down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2941000","2946000"," If you took money off up here with me earlier, congratulations."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2947000","2952000"," If you close that last set of calls, congratulations to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2952000","2954000"," I have a fucking tiger this morning, man."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2954000","2957000"," I'm like, I'm fucking laser beams in this shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2963000","2967000"," No, the big trade here, like, so the really big trade for a bear here"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2967000","2969000"," is below this box."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2969000","2973000"," This one right here is where the money is for a bear."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2973000","2975000"," To me, this is all consolidation."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2975000","2977000"," We're on a one minute chart right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2977000","2980000"," See right here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2980000","2983000"," Like this trade, you want to see how bullish we are?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2983000","2985000"," So right here, see this?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2985000","2987000"," See that line on a five minute chart?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","2987000","2989000"," You got to break that bad boy right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2991000","2993000"," You got to break 442.01."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2993000","2995000"," Then you get the, then you got a real money trade right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2995000","2998000"," Like this shit will blast out of the depths of hell."
"lnmFX4MuFes","2999000","3000000"," What else do you know about right now?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3000000","3002000"," Do you guys know what's going on right now?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3002000","3003000"," Probably not right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3004000","3007000"," So we have hedging flows coming into the market today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3008000","3013000"," So what happens is all these big ass banks are going to put a bunch of really bare shit out there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3014000","3017000"," And what they do to counter that is they don't want to disturb the market"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3017000","3020000"," so they throw some zero day calls on it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3021000","3024000"," Now, I don't know if they already threw the calls on it yesterday"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3024000","3028000"," so that if we come back down, they don't actually add zero dates today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3028000","3029000"," So they don't have to manage this stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3029000","3030000"," That's possible."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3031000","3036000"," You should get some bearish flows, major, like someone that's watching flow."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3036000","3038000"," I have a flow out going and stuff like that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3038000","3042000"," There should be some pretty big chunky bets against the market coming in."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3042000","3044000"," It's not necessarily bearish either."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3044000","3047000"," These are banks that are along the stock market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3047000","3051000"," They're along the underlying and they need to hedge their position."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3051000","3056000"," A cheap way to do that is on the S&P 500 complex."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3057000","3064000"," Now, along with that on a Friday, the other secret is they tend to put zero dates with those trades."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3064000","3070000"," Those zero dates get burned and then they just rip to the moon into the closing bell."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3070000","3072000"," So am I bearish here? No."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3073000","3075000"," Am I looking to take another zero date trade?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3075000","3079000"," Yes, likely right here at a 442.05 right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3079000","3083000"," If you want to take a trade with me this morning, possibly can take a trade together before I'm done."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3084000","3086000"," So let's take a look here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3086000","3088000"," We're on the one minute chart now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3088000","3091000"," Got a little bit of a rug right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3091000","3092000"," You see it down below."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3094000","3096000"," I'm going to try to rug pull this right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3096000","3100000"," I'm going to try to tag this lower this lower target down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3100000","3105000"," 442.06 and truthfully, I'd really like to see it tag the five minute."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3105000","3106000"," So right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3107000","3112000"," Really like to see a retest of 442.05 right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3113000","3115000"," You should so right here you want to see these candles."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3115000","3119000"," You see how how bowls are not able to get above 442.72."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3119000","3121000"," They're going to reverse this shit down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3121000","3125000"," We're going to tag 442.05 here likely in a few moments."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3126000","3128000"," Okay, so give it just a minute."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3129000","3131000"," I'm going to want you to see it right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3132000","3134000"," Okay, so this is where you actually put that fucking."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3134000","3136000"," This is like a five minute trade on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3137000","3139000"," It sucks is it's hard to do this with puts."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3139000","3141000"," Puts really aren't built for this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3142000","3147000"," Short is is built for this, but like spy man's puts are like puts"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3147000","3150000"," like go down there, but not hold their value like a call will."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3150000","3151000"," Right. They're not built."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3151000","3152000"," They weren't ever built for that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3152000","3155000"," So like let's say a let's say a put is like 10 cents."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3156000","3159000"," It'll go down and hit 30 cents, but it immediately turned back"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3159000","3160000"," around and go back to 10 cents."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3160000","3161000"," Right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3161000","3164000"," You need like a big major move down puts are built for like a crash"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3164000","3165000"," in the middle of the afternoon."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3166000","3168000"," Not for like a five minute trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3168000","3169000"," You can."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3169000","3171000"," You got to be quick."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3178000","3182000"," So watch this as it breaks below and starts ahead lower and I'm"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3182000","3185000"," going to be looking for a dip to buy down here at 442.07."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3192000","3194000"," So I'm going to do something in the background real quick."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3194000","3195000"," If you're out there and you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3195000","3199000"," Did me that solve this morning and just said, Hey fall captain"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3199000","3200000"," James, I really appreciate it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3201000","3203000"," Truly appreciate it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3203000","3205000"," I've never paid for followers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3205000","3207000"," I've never bought fake followers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3207000","3209000"," I've never fucking gone on Fiverr."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3209000","3213000"," I've never done any of that bullshit on Twitter, Twitch, YouTube,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3213000","3215000"," whatever it is."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3215000","3217000"," Not that guy, man."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3217000","3218000"," I don't want anything to do that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3218000","3223000"," So I appreciate that it's natural and from you guys."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3224000","3227000"," So we're just going to look at the collar and see if we can find"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3227000","3229000"," anything on it coming out right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3233000","3236000"," If you're on Twitch and you can't comment, I don't know how to"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3236000","3237000"," turn that off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3237000","3240000"," But if you're on Twitch and you can't comment, I think week is on"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3240000","3241000"," vacation right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3244000","3246000"," So if you want to jump on YouTube, the comment you can."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3247000","3248000"," I don't have any issues with that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3249000","3250000"," I don't have any issues with that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3250000","3252000"," If you like, like, I'll get on YouTube and comment or something"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3252000","3254000"," like that or maybe open a YouTube version in the background."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3254000","3256000"," So you can at least talk in the chat."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3258000","3260000"," The chat is open today on YouTube."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3260000","3262000"," You have to subscribe, but it's free."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3262000","3264000"," Members though, it's usually set to members only."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3266000","3267000"," Well, you guys will talk today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3267000","3268000"," It's a good day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3268000","3269000"," We're coming in the 4th of July."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3271000","3276000"," So let me just look on the collar real quick and see if there's"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3276000","3277000"," anything on it yet."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3279000","3280000"," It's kind of weird."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3280000","3283000"," I just read somebody that said you may want to consider"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3283000","3286000"," blocking anyone trying to guess the strikes of the put collar"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3286000","3287000"," spread."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3287000","3288000"," Put spread collar."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3288000","3289000"," This guy is wrong."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3289000","3290000"," You can actually guess it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3291000","3294000"," It's within three and a half to 5% of each strike."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3294000","3295000"," I want you to know that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3296000","3298000"," It's usually within three and a half to 5%."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3299000","3301000"," So you can actually take a pretty decent gander."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3302000","3305000"," I don't know who this guy is out there, but he has no fucking"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3305000","3306000"," idea what he's talking about."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3307000","3308000"," He's wrong."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3308000","3309000"," I guess you just go through this shit and just find out"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3309000","3310000"," who's wrong."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3311000","3312000"," Because it's pretty fucking simple."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3313000","3314000"," Oh, there's your tag down below."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3315000","3316000"," You guys inputs right now for that trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3320000","3323000"," It didn't get anybody that that's tracking the flows."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3325000","3327000"," I think I think what's the name was tracking flows."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3327000","3328000"," A ghost print."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3328000","3329000"," I think Palk was tracking something."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3329000","3331000"," Two days ago, some ghost prints trying to try to look at him."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3331000","3333000"," I think it was at the 356 and the 346."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3334000","3336000"," Someone who go out there and ask him and see what he says."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3338000","3339000"," You should take the money here and run."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3340000","3341000"," And explain to you why in just a moment."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3344000","3346000"," So there's a second trade here, but it's below."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3348000","3349000"," You should take the money and run right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3349000","3350000"," Guarantee it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3351000","3352000"," You now have a new trade here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3353000","3355000"," You should take the money and run right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3356000","3357000"," Guarantee it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3358000","3359000"," You now have a new box right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3360000","3361000"," See this white line?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3362000","3363000"," I'm going to show it to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3364000","3366000"," You now have a new box right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3367000","3368000"," I want you to see it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3369000","3374000"," So this is its own trade and this is the money part of the trade right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3375000","3376000"," You get out of the trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3377000","3379000"," You can actually expand this on like an hour or a day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3380000","3381000"," It doesn't matter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3382000","3384000"," This works on a 15 minute time frame and hour time frame"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3384000","3386000"," and a daily time frame, a weekly time frame."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3387000","3389000"," So right here, right is a new trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3390000","3392000"," So this was the last part of the trade right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3393000","3394000"," Hopefully you took the puts off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3395000","3396000"," There's your pin strike right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3397000","3400000"," And now what you're looking for is does this consolidate"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3401000","3402000"," and reject to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3403000","3405000"," Now if this consolidate and rejects to the downside,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3406000","3407000"," you're going to be looking for that one red candle,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3408000","3410000"," a red candle, a green fake out,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3411000","3413000"," and then one, two here and then we'll take the next leg down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3415000","3416000"," But right now you are not short here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3417000","3418000"," You are not long either."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3420000","3422000"," I want to show this clean this up for you real quick"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3423000","3425000"," and explain it better to you here at the system in just a minute."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3426000","3428000"," You see it right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3429000","3431000"," Now if you want to get bullish again in the market,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3432000","3433000"," what do you need to see happen?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3434000","3435000"," I'm going to draw it out for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3437000","3439000"," You want to see this first."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3444000","3445000"," You want to see price break above here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3459000","3460000"," It's likely going to fail right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3462000","3463000"," Come back down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3464000","3465000"," It'll bounce, bounce, bounce."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3467000","3468000"," And as it begins to squeeze up right here,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3469000","3471000"," you're ready, Johnny, on the spot to take that trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3472000","3474000"," And then you'll get the explosive move to the upside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3475000","3476000"," PT three right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3477000","3478000"," Actually, that's too far like right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3482000","3484000"," So I'll draw that out what you're looking for as a bear,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3485000","3486000"," as a bull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3486000","3487000"," What are bull bears looking for here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3487000","3488000"," I'm going to show you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3489000","3490000"," So you should be flat right now as a bear."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3491000","3494000"," And you're going to be looking for a rejection to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3495000","3496000"," And you want to see this play out first."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3497000","3498000"," Then you take the trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3498000","3499000"," You can set the trade up,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3499000","3504000"," but you don't fucking take it until it starts to proof itself."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3504000","3507000"," This is where traders lose all their money, all of it, all the time."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3508000","3511000"," So right here, you're looking for this to happen."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3512000","3514000"," And you're also looking for a failure."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3515000","3518000"," So you're looking for this to fail right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3519000","3520000"," Right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3520000","3522000"," You'll be looking for this green bar to not explode up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3523000","3528000"," You're looking for a reversal here to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3529000","3530000"," You're still not short."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3532000","3535000"," You're going to then look for this so much time you have to wait."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3536000","3538000"," You're then waiting for this failure right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3540000","3545000"," And then you are entering the trade only after you break below right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3546000","3547000"," Make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3547000","3549000"," And this is where the big money is right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3551000","3554000"," And this is where the probability is of you winning your trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3555000","3556000"," I want to be clear with that with you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3556000","3559000"," Probability that you're going to win."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3561000","3563000"," You have confidence here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3564000","3567000"," And that you can put your shorts where you want to put them."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3568000","3569000"," Or your stops."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3569000","3570000"," Excuse me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3571000","3572000"," Does it make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3572000","3576000"," These last 15 minutes, probably the biggest 15 minutes they could spend with you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3577000","3579000"," and turn you around as a bad trader."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3580000","3581000"," So right now,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3582000","3583000"," did you close your puts?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3584000","3587000"," If you didn't, they're fucking zero again, aren't they?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3589000","3590000"," Right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3590000","3591000"," So you take your trade right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3591000","3592000"," You made some money."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3592000","3593000"," Woohoo."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3593000","3594000"," Stoked."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3594000","3596000"," There will be people out there that'll tell you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3597000","3599000"," I took it from right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3600000","3604000"," I assure you that that guy that took that right there will disappear."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3605000","3609000"," He'll only come back two out of ten times and tell you that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3610000","3613000"," Someone else will come on the next time and tell you they took that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3613000","3616000"," That'll be a rolling list of names."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3616000","3618000"," They're never the same person."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3620000","3622000"," This part of that trade is not for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3623000","3625000"," This is the part of the trade for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3625000","3627000"," This is where you make your money."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3628000","3629000"," Nine times out of ten."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3629000","3630000"," Do you understand?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3631000","3632000"," Should be clear as fucking day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3640000","3647000"," That guy that called this will also tell you he closed here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3648000","3649000"," A different guy will say that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3649000","3652000"," Or that guy will come back in 15 minutes and tell you that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3654000","3655000"," So I want to be clear with that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3655000","3657000"," Set this stuff up every time."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3658000","3660000"," And I assure you, if you do this part right here,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3661000","3663000"," you're going to make fucking bank."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3664000","3665000"," Every time."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3666000","3669000"," And when you put a stop on that same trade, when you get stopped out,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3669000","3671000"," you're going to get cut for like five percent."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3672000","3673000"," Something like that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3674000","3675000"," Ten percent."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3676000","3677000"," And you'll be rocking out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3677000","3678000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3678000","3679000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3679000","3680000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3680000","3681000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3681000","3682000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3682000","3683000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3683000","3684000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3684000","3685000"," Bangers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3691000","3692000"," I assure you, promise you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3692000","3694000"," And you can apply this right here, what you're looking at."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3695000","3696000"," On a 15 minute chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3697000","3698000"," You can apply it to an hour chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3699000","3701000"," You can apply it to a day chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3701000","3703000"," You can apply it to a weekly chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3703000","3704000"," It doesn't fucking matter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3706000","3708000"," You can actually look at this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3709000","3710000"," And overlay this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3711000","3715000"," On a daily chart looking at the SPY in January of 2022."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3715000","3717000"," And it'll look just like this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3718000","3722000"," And you'll actually see the second failure over here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3723000","3725000"," You'll see this failure right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3725000","3729000"," And then you'll see as we drove into May down there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3732000","3737000"," If you can learn just this one thing right here, it's going to change your life."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3748000","3750000"," Set up works and futures."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3750000","3752000"," You guys are getting this tool for me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3752000","3754000"," The neat part about this too is."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3755000","3760000"," That the tool in futures is different than the tool in cash market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3760000","3764000"," Some really fascinating stuff about this is if you trade SP if you trade S&P 500."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3766000","3770000"," Some of the best like to the tick trades are on SPX not spy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3771000","3773000"," And some of the best."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3774000","3776000"," Or and then at nighttime on ES."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3777000","3780000"," It fucking works to the dime, but it's completely different."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3780000","3782000"," It's like the hourly triggers different."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3782000","3784000"," The one in five is different."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3784000","3785000"," It's all different."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3785000","3788000"," So like it's really fascinating because when you're in cash market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3789000","3792000"," The SPX works better for ES."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3793000","3796000"," So if you're trading futures in daytime, if you trade SPX."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3796000","3799000"," While or if you use the SPX tool."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3799000","3805000"," During the day while you're executing contracts on ES, it works awesome."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3805000","3808000"," If you're if you're trading nighttime."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3809000","3811000"," You switch over to the ES tool."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3811000","3813000"," Because it takes over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3813000","3816000"," So it's really fucking cool how they're both different."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3817000","3819000"," I use it on the spy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3820000","3822000"," I should probably use it on the spy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3822000","3829000"," I should probably use it on SPX for the big moves during the day, but I don't."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3829000","3830000"," Well, I do."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3830000","3832000"," If you're like, we're coming down the hourly triggers some shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3832000","3833000"," I'll use SPX."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3834000","3836000"," But inter day trading."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3837000","3840000"," It works phenomenally, phenomenally on spy tool."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3841000","3844000"," The spy tool works fucking awesome on just spy specifically."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3846000","3849000"," But I'm looking for like a big like perfect tag like to it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3849000","3852000"," During the day, it's usually the SPX one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3852000","3859000"," Now the problem with SPX is it doesn't show the volatility quite like spy does."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3860000","3864000"," Spies like fucking gremlin right like running around."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3865000","3871000"," Taking out stops and triggering by orders when you didn't mean to buy all that kind of shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3872000","3874000"," So are we bearish right here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3874000","3876000"," No, and let's check something out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3876000","3877000"," We're in a one minute chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3877000","3879000"," We're going to go to five minutes or a five minute chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3880000","3882000"," What's important about this five minute chart right now?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3883000","3886000"," Every time we test this this five minute EMA."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3886000","3888000"," What are we what are we finding?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3889000","3894000"," Support buyers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3894000","3897000"," What is this five minute candle telling you?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3898000","3900000"," Fucking buyers are here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3901000","3902000"," They haven't gotten nowhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3902000","3903000"," They're right fucking here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3903000","3909000"," Look at that relentless pursuit of new highs boom bought it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3910000","3923000"," As long as price remains above the twenty seven EMA on a twenty seven or on a five minute chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3923000","3924000"," What are we?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3925000","3926000"," Bullish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3929000","3931000"," We're sellers able to get a new low."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3933000","3934000"," No."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3935000","3937000"," It's now eleven AM."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3938000","3942000"," Do they have the red bar at eleven AM so far? No, huh?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3943000","3947000"," So this is a bears last chance here, isn't it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3948000","3953000"," This green bar that's still green needs to turn red right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3954000","3957000"," They have another fifteen minutes to eleven fifteen."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3959000","3961000"," They'll try to they're going to try."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3961000","3965000"," I know between now eleven fifteen they're going to fucking try to loop this back down right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3966000","3967000"," So we're going to pay attention to this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3967000","3969000"," We're outside of the box of death right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3970000","3971000"," You have fifteen minutes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3971000","3973000"," These bears these sellers have fifteen minutes right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3974000","3976000"," We already have this big green bar right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3977000","3980000"," So they're telling sellers get the fuck on out of here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3981000","3982000"," We're right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3983000","3985000"," So right here buyers are here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3986000","3987000"," They have not gone anywhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3988000","3989000"," They're nowhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3989000","3990000"," They're right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3991000","3992000"," Sellers are checking to see."
"lnmFX4MuFes","3996000","3997000"," Are the buyers gone?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3997000","3999000"," If they are we're going to run this down right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","3999000","4002000"," And so you know right now that buyers are here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4003000","4005000"," They stepped in on this big candle right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4005000","4007000"," You can see the candle stepped right in."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4008000","4009000"," Said no we're not going anywhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4009000","4010000"," We're going up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4015000","4017000"," I'm going to set up a trade right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4021000","4022000"," 4.43.91."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4022000","4026000"," 4.44 is our thirty thirty one cents right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4026000","4027000"," Thirty two cents right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4029000","4031000"," Oh look at that bunch of calls in the market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4031000","4036000"," I'm going to put these on and just leave them for the day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4062000","4064000"," Starting a position only twenty five contracts."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4065000","4067000"," Four third or four forty four sees."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4072000","4074000"," So we had our first tag here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4076000","4079000"," We now want to go back up and retest the previous."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4080000","4085000"," So we're going to try to go up right now and test four forty three thirty six."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4085000","4088000"," And see if these sellers are strong or weak."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4089000","4093000"," If we're able to break above four forty four thirty six we're going to moon."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4095000","4096000"," So right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4102000","4107000"," These buyers are going to attempt to go up and break through here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4108000","4110000"," To make another trade higher in the meantime."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4111000","4117000"," Right now the bears have until eleven fifteen about twelve minutes to try to fight off these buyers."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4119000","4121000"," If they fail in the next fifteen minutes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4122000","4123000"," We're going to run right up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4123000","4125000"," We're going to run right the fuck over them so."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4133000","4135000"," Let's see how this goes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4138000","4142000"," Nice candle right here buyers you guys are just relentless in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4143000","4145000"," Relentless."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4146000","4149000"," We're hey good grab sir good morning brother how are you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","4157000","4161000"," Yeah I got some stops underneath like if we start to roll or anything like that."

"lnmFX4MuFes","5140000","5142000"," It's telling a different story, isn't it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5142000","5150000"," Now, I don't get to say thank you to everybody because if you guys sometimes support me directly"

"lnmFX4MuFes","5480000","5483000"," Support vehicles, all that kind of stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5483000","5486000"," The whole thing is like there's something for everybody."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5486000","5488000"," If you're going to do it, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5488000","5490000"," A lot of people that even ride the whole thing."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5490000","5492000"," They get on a bike ride as far as they feel like they can."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5492000","5494000"," They get too drunk in one town."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5494000","5497000"," Someone else in the sag wagon jumps on and keeps riding."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5497000","5502000"," Hey, Joe, I downloaded your photo, man, from yesterday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5502000","5505000"," I kept it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5505000","5509000"," Dude, look at these guys up here trying to sell it down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5509000","5510000"," This is the liquidation break."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5510000","5511000"," I was talking to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5512000","5514000"," Dude, look at these guys up here trying to sell it down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5514000","5517000"," This is the liquidation break I was talking to you about."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5521000","5523000"," I got your photo, man."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5524000","5526000"," You were on fire on Twitter yesterday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5526000","5529000"," Look, it's funny because I do it at like two in the morning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5529000","5530000"," You're like, fuck it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5530000","5531000"," It's one in the afternoon."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5531000","5532000"," Let's do it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5542000","5548000"," Dude, Chris, what's going on, brother?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5548000","5555000"," Is Winky here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5555000","5560000"," He might actually be here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5560000","5561000"," Yeah."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5561000","5562000"," I'm not selling."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5562000","5567000"," I'm trying to buy another dip here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5567000","5570000"," They're going to try to revenge trade this down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5570000","5571000"," This is all big liquidate."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5571000","5572000"," You guys don't liquidation break."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5572000","5577000"," So I just got your stops out trying to get you out of the trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5586000","5588000"," Is Jay role here today?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5588000","5591000"," Is James in the house right now?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5591000","5594000"," Oh, what up, James?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5594000","5598000"," So I forgot to put James's name on this post this morning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5599000","5600000"," And he got into the..."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5600000","5602000"," I made a post this morning saying, follow all these guys."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5602000","5603000"," And I forgot."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5603000","5604000"," I get in for gals."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5604000","5605000"," I forget."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5605000","5608000"," There's like 100 fucking people I could have put on that post."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5608000","5610000"," And I didn't put James on there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5610000","5613000"," So I went back into the post and was like, got this guy too."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5616000","5619000"," Like you got to add like Gavin May on there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5619000","5622000"," There's a whole bunch of people like that list."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5622000","5624000"," That list could be a mile long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5624000","5629000"," There's like 100 fucking traders on Fintuit that are badasses."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5629000","5631000"," Like Gavin May is a fucking badass, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5631000","5634000"," David AMS is a badass."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5634000","5636000"," There's like a shit ton more."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5636000","5639000"," We should probably just start adding names to that list."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5639000","5641000"," I'm going to add a couple right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5641000","5643000"," Oh, I'm going to add a couple names to that list right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5643000","5645000"," I'm going to go to Twitter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5645000","5647000"," Then I'm going to go to that post."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5647000","5648000"," Hold on here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5648000","5650000"," I'm going to go to that post because I got two right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5650000","5651000"," I should add to it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5655000","5663000"," Feel free to add names."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5663000","5671000"," There are way more."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5671000","5676000"," Here's a couple more."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5676000","5683000"," David, where's David AMS?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5684000","5690000"," Hold on a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5690000","5693000"," What's David AMS's Twitter handle?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5693000","5698000"," I don't know why he's not coming up in my Twitter handle here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5698000","5701000"," Anybody know what David AMS's Twitter handle is?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5701000","5703000"," There he is right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5703000","5704000"," Boom."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5704000","5708000"," So there's David AMS."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5709000","5711000"," Who else went ahead in there?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5711000","5714000"," Gavin."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5714000","5715000"," Here's a couple more."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5715000","5722000"," Gavin May."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5728000","5731000"," I typed that twice, didn't I?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5731000","5734000"," I'm going to retweet this one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5734000","5736000"," Feel free to add more names."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5737000","5738000"," There are way more."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5738000","5739000"," Here are a couple more."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5739000","5741000"," So yeah, that's David AMS."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5741000","5746000"," And then Gavin May real."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5746000","5751000"," Maybe we can start a thread with this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5751000","5762000"," So you guys know who to actually be following out there on Fintuit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5762000","5765000"," I just added another 25 and up to 50 contracts here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5766000","5770000"," So now I got 50 contracts on spoons here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5770000","5774000"," For end of day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5774000","5776000"," So I've got 50 contracts here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5776000","5780000"," And what I'm going to show you here is this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5780000","5785000"," What I don't want to see here is closing candles below."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5785000","5788000"," So this is my DCA point right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5788000","5791000"," If I begin to see any of this kind of stuff here,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5791000","5794000"," I'm going to cut my position loose."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5794000","5797000"," So right in here, I'm going to show this to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5797000","5801000"," What I don't want is a pole higher here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5801000","5802000"," So now I'm DCA'd."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5802000","5807000"," And I don't want to see this come down and start to send us to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5807000","5809000"," So we've got a bear."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5809000","5812000"," We've got a bear plane forming."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5812000","5814000"," So I want you to see this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5814000","5816000"," See this white line right here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5816000","5820000"," These sellers want to sell this market down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5820000","5821000"," It's 1131 right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5821000","5823000"," They just got a new low, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5823000","5828000"," On 1131, these sellers are trying to take this way down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5828000","5830000"," It's looking pretty bearish to me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5830000","5832000"," So I DCA'd right about 26."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5832000","5834000"," I think about 32 or 35."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5834000","5836000"," I bought 26."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5836000","5838000"," We're now trading 27."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5838000","5845000"," And I have to have my stops right here and be ready to take puts."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5845000","5847000"," Does that make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5847000","5850000"," So I have long calls here with a DCA."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5851000","5854000"," And I'm going to have my stops down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5854000","5859000"," And I'm going to look to short this market if it rejects."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5859000","5862000"," Now trading 28 cents."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5862000","5886000"," Let me see if I can, um, maybe I should have wrote it like this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5886000","5888000"," Copy."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5916000","5941000"," Oh, they want to sell this so bad, don't they?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5941000","5949000"," I'm going to delete this so I can keep my eyes on it here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5949000","5957000"," Because they're going to make me pull my calls here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5957000","5961000"," And the target below here is pretty deep."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5961000","5963000"," It's, um, where is it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5963000","5967000"," Way down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5967000","5970000"," Way down there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5970000","5973000"," See how low that is right there?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5973000","5976000"," It's a pretty big target right there, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","5976000","5978000"," Bam."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5978000","5979000"," Bam."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5979000","5984000"," Bam and Bam right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5984000","5990000"," And the sellers are like, oh, I want the pullback so bad."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5990000","5995000"," See you right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","5995000","6000000"," I got my hands on the cell trigger on 50 contracts here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6000000","6002000"," And I will switch to puts."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6002000","6006000"," First target down below 441 81."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6006000","6024000"," Next target 440 6."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6024000","6031000"," And here's our HT right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6031000","6034000"," Still long calls."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6034000","6039000"," I want to see that closing bar underneath that white and yellow line right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6054000","6061000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6061000","6064000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6064000","6067000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6067000","6075000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6075000","6079000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6079000","6092000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6092000","6094000"," Let me just second with the middle of trade here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6094000","6096000"," James, I want to say hi to you, man."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6096000","6102000"," Just second, but in a trader, I'm sweating."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6103000","6108000"," So for you guys are what you guys have here is just a Webull chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6108000","6112000"," So I know that a lot of people don't use trading view."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6112000","6122000"," So right here is the Webull chart for people that want to do this on their own charting software at home."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6122000","6125000"," The tool you're going to get on the website."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6125000","6128000"," It's not on trading view or anything like that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6128000","6130000"," So let's go to the website to use it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6130000","6134000"," Or that's the plan as of right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6134000","6142000"," And I do run a version of that tool on trading view, though, for myself right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6142000","6145000"," It has kind of do or die right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6145000","6147000"," Let's get it's looking very bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6147000","6148000"," So not going to lie."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6148000","6153000"," It looks pretty fucking bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6154000","6157000"," I'm trying to buy some fucking puts just as fast."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6157000","6161000"," I can't do both on my platform."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6161000","6163000"," I guess I could, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6163000","6164000"," Hold on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6164000","6166000"," I can set up the put side."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6166000","6168000"," So 441s."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6168000","6171000"," 440s are 17 cents."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6171000","6173000"," So I will set those up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6173000","6174000"," Hold on a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6184000","6188000"," Okay, so I've got now like cell."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6188000","6192000"," So I've got cell 444c and by 440p."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6192000","6195000"," But still haven't have an executed it yet."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6195000","6196000"," If it reverses, we're good."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6196000","6202000"," If we start rolling, I'll go on the 440 C or 440 P's."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6202000","6204000"," It looks like it's going to roll."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6204000","6207000"," It's pretty fucking pretty sure thing right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6213000","6233000"," Yeah, I put them up because I put them up because I put up the whole I got to try to fucking"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6233000","6235000"," do the same time."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6235000","6238000"," Looking at some stuff I got to look at here in the background."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6238000","6242000"," Yeah, sell that fucking Vicks down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6243000","6251000"," I put the Webull try picked Webull for you guys because if you're not paying for data."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6251000","6253000"," It has pretty much."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6253000","6259000"," I don't know what they're paying for their data, but of all the free shit you can be looking at."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6259000","6263000"," Like for number one, like a new trader usually gets with gets with Robin Hood, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6263000","6268000"," Their first foray outside of Robin Hood is typically Webull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6268000","6271000"," They have really good marketing, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6271000","6277000"," So if you're going to take your next step, you're going to go from Robin Hood probably to a Webull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6277000","6280000"," So there's that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6280000","6286000"," The next thing though is if you're not paying for data, which can be very expensive."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6286000","6291000"," It can be three, four, five, six hundred dollars a month for your data."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6291000","6297000"," Probably the best free data out there is likely coming from Webull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6298000","6305000"," I've actually run Webull against paid data and it's it's pretty fucking close and it's really fast too."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6305000","6308000"," They have really good ticks."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6308000","6310000"," Really minute stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6310000","6318000"," And so I was like, yeah, if we're going to show a chart for live streaming, maybe it's just something that everybody would have access to."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6318000","6322000"," Now here's that that bar right there is really fucking ugly."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6322000","6324000"," Really fucking ugly right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6324000","6326000"," This one right here is really ugly."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6326000","6328000"," That's not the bar that I want to see right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6328000","6332000"," So I'm going to switch over right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6332000","6334000"," Dude, you got to be fucking kidding me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6334000","6337000"," Well,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6337000","6346000"," some out of calls in long for four or sorry, hold on a second here on the wrong date."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6346000","6352000"," I'm long puts on 440 P's."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6353000","6354000"," That was the bar right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6354000","6356000"," This one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6356000","6365000"," That fucking bar caused me to stop out right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6365000","6366000"," That was the beauty right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6366000","6368000"," You see it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6368000","6374000"," That candle right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6374000","6381000"," So now long 440 P's for today trading 22 cents."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6381000","6382000"," I'm going to use this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6382000","6388000"," You see this is now going to turn red."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6388000","6397000"," And you're going to watch a cross happen here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6397000","6408000"," And you're going to see a confirmation trade to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6408000","6412000"," They're going to start teeing off on this to here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6412000","6427000"," To catch another bounce up to the yellow line and likely continue lower here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6427000","6428000"," No, it's not ugly."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6428000","6429000"," It's this candle right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6429000","6432000"," So this one, this one candle right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6432000","6434000"," That was the break."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6434000","6436000"," That was your break right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6437000","6438000"," And this candle was it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6438000","6460000"," This is what forced me to buy puts."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6460000","6469000"," That was the first price target of break below here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6469000","6477000"," PT one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6478000","6485000"," PT two."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6485000","6496000"," What I'm really fascinated in with here is if they break and hold below this PT two."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6496000","6500000"," They break below and hold this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6500000","6504000"," You will get some real blood going here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6505000","6508000"," So I'm going to be fascinated with just this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6508000","6517000"," If we break this PT two."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6517000","6525000"," There's PT three."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6525000","6533000"," And ultimately you'll get your early trigger down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6563000","6569000"," Draw these out so you can see them."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6594000","6599000"," Now I'm in puts right now, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6599000","6602000"," Where do my stops for my puts go?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6602000","6604000"," It's the same as this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6604000","6608000"," So when you see this cross happening right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6608000","6611000"," Let me get this going here for you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6624000","6627000"," I'm looking for two things."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6627000","6632000"," I'm looking for these lines here to go flat."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6632000","6635000"," And start to turn up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6635000","6641000"," And I'm also looking for any time we check this yellow line."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6641000","6645000"," I want to see that we're continuing to go down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6645000","6651000"," Anytime we pull back and squeeze up to the white as long as that confirms we're still going down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6652000","6656000"," If at any point we break above this yellow and white line, the trade is over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6656000","6657000"," Does that make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6657000","6659000"," So your stops are up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6659000","6662000"," Does that make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6662000","6663000"," And this can be anywhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6663000","6664000"," It can be up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6664000","6669000"," It can be down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6669000","6674000"," Strike on PT one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6674000","6676000"," It normally doesn't go straight down either."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6676000","6680000"," You should see a squeeze and then squeeze and then all the way down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6681000","6683000"," 440P trading."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6683000","6694000"," 22 cents right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6694000","6696000"," No."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6696000","6699000"," So it's like a ping pong match."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6699000","6701000"," So good question."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6701000","6703000"," So I'm going to show you the ping pong here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6703000","6704000"," You've got pivots, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6704000","6705000"," Come up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6705000","6706000"," Tag this pivot."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6706000","6707000"," Come down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6707000","6708000"," Tag this pivot."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6708000","6709000"," Come up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6709000","6711000"," Fail to tag the high."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6711000","6713000"," That's a new pivot, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6713000","6718000"," The expectation is it bears that you're going to tag this pivot and then come back up here,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6718000","6719000"," right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6719000","6720000"," And then ping pong."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6720000","6722000"," You see the ping pong?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6722000","6726000"," One, two, three, four, five and down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6726000","6731000"," Trade will be over here, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6731000","6732000"," So you'll see a green."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6732000","6733000"," You'll see green bars."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6734000","6735000"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6735000","6739000"," And you're going to expect red bars for the trade to continue."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6739000","6741000"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6741000","6742000"," Make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6742000","6746000"," So you should be able to see this already inside of your head."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6746000","6749000"," You don't usually have to chart this stuff out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6749000","6753000"," The more you can see it, the easier it is for you to be like, yeah, that bar right there,"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6753000","6754000"," man."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6754000","6755000"," Get the fuck out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6755000","6758000"," Or this is where my stops are right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6758000","6760000"," Does it make sense?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6760000","6762000"," I don't know if it does or doesn't."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6762000","6767000"," Let me know if that makes sense."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6767000","6768000"," Yeah, that's the truth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6768000","6769000"," At some point, we're going to go up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6769000","6771000"," In my view, we're going to the moon today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6771000","6783000"," We're going to close on a high."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6783000","6786000"," Yeah, so what Super Bowl man is saying I agree with?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6786000","6791000"," This is all hedging flows coming in and they have to counter that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6792000","6795000"," So I think this does reverse at some point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6795000","6800000"," I don't think we actually get down to the early trigger if we do all the better."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6800000","6804000"," But if we if we don't, it wouldn't shock me to just swiftly reverse to the upside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6804000","6810000"," This should at some point be a violent move to the upside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6821000","6823000"," You"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6851000","6853000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6853000","6855000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6855000","6857000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6857000","6859000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6859000","6863000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6863000","6865000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6865000","6867000"," so right here sellers are looking for confirmation."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6867000","6871000"," You're going to find out here if sellers are still in control."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6871000","6877000"," So if you reverse this chart right way to see something here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6877000","6879000"," See how we're going up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6879000","6883000"," We confirm right here and we're rocket ship up, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6883000","6886000"," So we're going to confirm this on the flip side right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6890000","6893000"," So we're either going to see a reversal to the downside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6893000","6895000"," So you'll see green ticks."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6897000","6899000"," We'll come up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6900000","6906000"," And if we reverse right here, it's going to confirm a larger downside move."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6906000","6910000"," If we resolve to the upside puts come off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","6936000","6938000"," You"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6966000","6968000"," you"
"lnmFX4MuFes","6996000","7000000"," I'm trying to read some stuff here trying to get some data hold on a second here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7026000","7038000"," It's weird like reading some of the stuff that I'm reading right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7038000","7040000"," I'm like"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7052000","7054000"," I'm on puts right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7055000","7057000"," I'm on puts"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7071000","7073000"," second here"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7084000","7086000"," second here"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7106000","7108000"," That was a pretty fair point here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7109000","7111000"," And he's saying something good this morning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7111000","7117000"," He said I contrary to my red day call and following up on JQQ like March the caller popped."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7117000","7119000"," That means that without ham"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7119000","7122000"," the JQPM acting to offset."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7122000","7127000"," There will be a seven to eight billion dollar to the buy MOC imbalance."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7127000","7133000"," He will likely front run that buying today and sell what he buys MOC to offset."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7134000","7138000"," So remember we talked about the March."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7138000","7140000"," We're going to take a look at something really quick here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7140000","7143000"," I'm at the close this shit, but we're going to take a look right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7143000","7145000"," So he's making a very good point right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7145000","7147000"," Remember you guys earlier this week I talked to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7147000","7150000"," I think yesterday we talked about this briefly."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7150000","7153000"," So he's making a very good point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7164000","7168000"," So Andy's saying I've just reposted what Andy said."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7168000","7173000"," And we're going to look at the March caller right now and we were talking about this"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7173000","7175000"," caller yesterday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7175000","7178000"," So we're going to look at the."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7178000","7179000"," We'll do it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7179000","7180000"," We did it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7180000","7182000"," We looked at it yesterday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7182000","7185000"," So let's go to a four hour chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7185000","7191000"," And we yesterday I think yesterday past couple days we're talking about the March caller."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7192000","7195000"," This is actually we're looking at here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7195000","7198000"," So I want you to see this and old man bull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7198000","7202000"," I want you to look at this right here is four hour chart."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7202000","7205000"," We're going to look at this one right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7205000","7207000"," Stay with me if you're out there watching."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7207000","7212000"," So yesterday we were looking at the."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7212000","7214000"," Let me get this over here."

"lnmFX4MuFes","7215000","7218000"," So right in here we were looking at this yesterday day before."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7218000","7222000"," We're talking about the caller getting popped right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7222000","7224000"," And you see the push higher."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7224000","7228000"," This is the 31st right we bloodbath it down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7228000","7234000"," And we tag and run from 40178 and then blast off right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7234000","7236000"," So."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7236000","7241000"," Just where we are right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7241000","7242000"," Right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7242000","7243000"," Pay attention."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7244000","7246000"," You see my early trigger right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7246000","7248000"," You see my PT five right there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7248000","7251000"," Pay attention right now serious enough fucking around."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7251000","7253000"," You see this right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7253000","7257000"," It's kind of the same deal right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7257000","7260000"," You'd see that the bloodbath here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7260000","7268000"," And then you'd see the bloodbath."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7269000","7273000"," And then you'd see the big bounce into tomorrow and the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7273000","7277000"," So if you're looking for a trade for July 5th."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7277000","7280000"," You're looking to get long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7280000","7284000"," Somewhere in this vicinity for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7284000","7286000"," Call spread maybe so it wouldn't matter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7286000","7289000"," So if you come down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7289000","7292000"," To make a sense to you."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7292000","7295000"," It's like right down in here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7296000","7304000"," If you look at the March."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7304000","7306000"," Collar."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7306000","7309000"," We bleed down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7309000","7315000"," And then we get that huge monster by into the bell."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7315000","7319000"," Now you might think a cap."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7319000","7321000"," Maybe we don't go that low today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7321000","7322000"," That's fine too."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7323000","7326000"," If we don't."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7326000","7332000"," So if we at any point begin to resolve to the upside."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7332000","7337000"," And price begins to prove itself."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7337000","7343000"," For that explosive move up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7343000","7348000"," We'll take that trade for the fifth and I'll probably close the stream at that point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7349000","7350000"," I'll put us."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7350000","7356000"," I'll put a trade on with you for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7356000","7372000"," So just right now they're testing to see it right here in the white line."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7372000","7375000"," Trying to reverse."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7376000","7380000"," Follow my cursor."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7380000","7383000"," And these are where stops are for a lot of sellers right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7383000","7387000"," This is actually the same thing as."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7387000","7393000"," It's the same thing as this stuff here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7393000","7404000"," Tries to get you out of your stops."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7405000","7409000"," Let's look at trades for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7429000","7430000"," Sorry to get 11.58."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7430000","7432000"," I'm going to be in so much fucking trouble."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7432000","7441000"," Like the next like I was supposed to leave an hour ago."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7441000","7448000"," I'm going to be in deep shit here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7448000","7468000"," Okay, trade for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7468000","7470000"," Now I'm going to put the trade on for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7470000","7474000"," I might close it on the third in the morning depending on where we are."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7474000","7477000"," What's great about this is theta burn."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7478000","7483000"," We've got Saturday, Sunday, Monday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7483000","7487000"," Oh no, we're open on Monday, but then we're closed on the fourth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7487000","7490000"," So we got four or five days of burn."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7490000","7499000"," And I want to like suck all that burn up between now and then."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7499000","7500000"," They're going to try this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7500000","7502000"," They're going to fucking stop me out of this trade too."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7502000","7506000"," This will be a second trade I've been stopped out of today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7507000","7513000"," I might just leave these fucking things on and put this trade on for Wednesday."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7513000","7515000"," Call it a day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7515000","7521000"," So I'm looking at, I'm looking at debit call spreads right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7522000","7525000"," Four forty five's four forty twos."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7525000","7529000"," Oh yeah, they're fucking pricing this shit in, aren't they?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7529000","7532000"," Four forty threes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7532000","7537000"," Four forty two is a fifty two for forty eight."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7537000","7542000"," How about four forty two for four forty's?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7542000","7546000"," Oh yeah, they're fucking pricing this shit in, aren't they?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7546000","7548000"," Four forty threes."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7549000","7557000"," How about four forty two, four forty's?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7557000","7558000"," Yeah, I don't mind that trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7558000","7559000"," That's a good trade too."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7579000","7585000"," Break evens four forty two fifty six."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7585000","7602000"," I think tighter, I'm trying to, uh, come up with a trade here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7602000","7609000"," I have to do some work here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7609000","7613000"," Forty three maybe."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7613000","7628000"," Four forty two three."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7628000","7646000"," Four forty five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7646000","7655000"," No."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7655000","7662000"," Think tight for a second."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7662000","7673000"," That's a good trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7673000","7676000"," Okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7676000","7683000"," So I'm leaving on a boat trip."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7684000","7686000"," Okay, break even."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7686000","7689000"," Now there's a better trade or is it better trade here?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7689000","7694000"," A call spread for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7694000","7697000"," A hundred twenty six dollars to make a hundred and seventy four."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7697000","7699000"," It's got a forty three percent chance of profit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7699000","7703000"," That means that I'm expecting a big push up here and above."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7703000","7706000"," If I go a little bit lower."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7707000","7712000"," Like four forty four forty three has a fifty six percent chance of winning."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7712000","7715000"," But I have to risk one eighty six for a hundred and fourteen."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7715000","7719000"," And I probably have to hold it to the end of the trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7719000","7724000"," So they kind of want you to say, yeah, fuck yeah, we're going higher."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7724000","7728000"," So one hundred twenty five dollars for a max gain of one seventy five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7728000","7735000"," My break even here is four forty three twenty five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7736000","7739000"," Four forty three twenty five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7739000","7751000"," Which means that I have to be above."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7751000","7758000"," This come on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7758000","7761000"," The fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7762000","7765000"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7765000","7767000"," You know what?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7767000","7770000"," What are four forty eights and four fifties?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7770000","7771000"," That would shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7771000","7778000"," They would make some people shit their pants, wouldn't it?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7778000","7785000"," I think we can easily trade this next week."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7785000","7792000"," I think we can pull out here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7793000","7816000"," I still think we roll this thing down in the early July."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7816000","7819000"," That's the idea, right?"
"lnmFX4MuFes","7820000","7829000"," The idea is that we open up on at least Monday or even Wednesday up here somewhere."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7829000","7832000"," Man, I want to take that whole fucking thing so bad."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7832000","7842000"," Hold on a second here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7842000","7848000"," No, I want to edit this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7848000","7856000"," I'm going to take a trade right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7856000","7859000"," For seven five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7859000","7867000"," I'm taking four forty two to four forty eight."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7867000","7874000"," For a hundred twenty dollars with a max gain of four hundred max gain for twenty max risk one eighty."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7874000","7882000"," My break even on this is four forty three eighty so I have to give up another fifty five cents or something."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7882000","7889000"," But I'll be make profit anywhere above this at any point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7889000","7892000"," We do this in like the third or something."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7892000","7895000"," I'll make a hundred and seventy one dollars."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7895000","7897000"," Hopefully I'm going to catch some of this burn."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7897000","7900000"," I don't know that we get this max gain up here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7900000","7907000"," But that's the trade that I'm going to put on right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7907000","7908000"," So I've got puts right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7908000","7912000"," I still have a twenty five fucking four forty P's or twelve cents."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7912000","7916000"," I'm going to let these run into the clothes today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7916000","7921000"," I'm going to hold them into the bell in case we do get a roll."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7921000","7928000"," They'll help offset me on my puts."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7929000","7933000"," What I'm thinking here is for next week I got to get out of here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7933000","7936000"," So for next week here's my trade for you for next week."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7936000","7938000"," And here's my outlook for next week."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7938000","7942000"," Okay you want my outlook for next week right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7942000","7950000"," Bulls need to trade above STXL at four forty three ninety one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7950000","7953000"," They have to trade above it and hold it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7953000","7954000"," They have a choice."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7954000","7956000"," They have to trade above this right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7956000","7961000"," Get a new high from our previous high in the past right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7961000","7963000"," We have to get above of your bull."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7963000","7966000"," You have to get above four forty three ninety one."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7966000","7975000"," If you do into July 5th price target four forty eight sixty six."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7975000","7979000"," July 5th."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7979000","7983000"," And if at any point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7983000","7989000"," We are unable to hold."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7989000","7994000"," Above four forty three thirty six or scratch that if we can't hold above."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7994000","7998000"," Four forty two four forty we can we can slip down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","7998000","8002000"," I want you to know that we can go down here and dip back up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8002000","8004000"," We have to hold this here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8004000","8007000"," If you can't hold it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8007000","8012000"," I'm going to give you two lower targets."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8012000","8017000"," First one will be four thirty eight fifty eight."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8017000","8023000"," That failure though will likely lead to the daily trigger down here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8023000","8029000"," That target will be four thirty."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8029000","8034000"," Into next week."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8035000","8046000"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8046000","8051000"," Price must stay up here for that for that move in the fifth right."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8051000","8056000"," If price fails here we're going to trade below."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8056000","8061000"," You'll see bills bulls attempt to go up there and grab that for that four forty eight to get up there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8061000","8064000"," If you have a break at any point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8064000","8072000"," Four thirty nine four thirty eight or four thirty nine or excuse me four thirty eight and change four thirty eighty nine or so."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8072000","8080000"," We will trade down here and tag that four thirty."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8080000","8087000"," As these flows come in today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8087000","8091000"," If we go back to the March."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8091000","8093000"," Collar."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8093000","8096000"," We traded down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8096000","8101000"," To about two thirty in the afternoon to right here."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8101000","8106000"," So I want you to know that we can still do all of this today."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8106000","8112000"," And then get up there and hit those targets up on high and then roll it over."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8113000","8115000"," On July 5th."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8115000","8118000"," So write this down get a piece of paper."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8118000","8121000"," Write everything I'd say down here right now okay."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8121000","8126000"," So right now it is easy for us to trade down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8126000","8133000"," To four thirty nine oh seven ish little bit higher four thirty nine eighty two possibly."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8133000","8137000"," And still make a run higher believe it or not."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8138000","8140000"," And to the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8140000","8148000"," If those flows kick in early maybe too many people know and they're just buying calls buying calls buying calls and it's just never going down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8148000","8156000"," We start holding above this four forty three thirty six price target next week four forty eight sixty six."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8156000","8160000"," I'm giving a very low chance that we break this."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8160000","8163000"," And go to the daily trigger next week."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8163000","8167000"," But if you see this happen on Monday or anything trade it like take it down."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8167000","8174000"," If you start to see the break and the hold take it down to the daily trigger."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8174000","8177000"," If while I'm on vacation I see anything wacky."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8177000","8180000"," I'll let you know I will get on fin to it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8180000","8185000"," I do have access to a phone at least and I'll let you know right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8185000","8190000"," Price target by July 5th off Friday four forty eight sixty six."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8191000","8194000"," There's your Valhalla burr baby."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8194000","8203000"," Hello ladies."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8203000","8209000"," So I've got some puts and I'm going to place this trade right now for next week I don't really care."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8209000","8214000"," If this trade rolls if it's going back up here by the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8214000","8217000"," So I've got some puts for this close just in case they're protecting me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8217000","8227000"," I'm going to place this trade right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8227000","8241000"," I have an order in for a hundred and seventy four dollars on that trade."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8241000","8245000"," Trade is a seven five."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8245000","8249000"," Four forty two C four forty four or four forty eight C."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8249000","8259000"," So you're selling the four forty eight call buying the four forty two call."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8259000","8264000"," I'm not seeing anything on J. E. R. J. G. E. Q. Fucking amen."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8264000","8269000"," I always mess this shit up J. H. E. Q. X. At this point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8269000","8273000"," I haven't seen anything on at this point."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8273000","8279000"," So maybe we'll come out next week."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8279000","8283000"," Well you guys know one other thing a lot of you guys shit on Andy Andy constant."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8283000","8289000"," And you shouldn't the JPM caller is."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8289000","8291000"," A fluid."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8291000","8298000"," Trade that you have to adjust your expectations on."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8298000","8301000"," As as the market moves the market like it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8301000","8303000"," It impacts the market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8303000","8309000"," And then sometimes the market can roll over the the the the a caller."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8309000","8313000"," And the price effect on the caller matters as well."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8313000","8316000"," Sometimes I see people shit down in and I'm like."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8316000","8318000"," This is a very fluid thing that he's doing."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8318000","8323000"," I'm very appreciative of what he puts out there."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8365000","8371000"," Like I was able to like some of this I was able to do and some of that I wasn't able to do."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8371000","8375000"," Like it doesn't work well with screeners."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8375000","8379000"," So I'm going to leave it on as long as I possibly can."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8379000","8383000"," If I don't if I'm not around internet I can't turn it off like."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8383000","8386000"," I'm going to try to try to turn off my phone."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8386000","8389000"," I don't know when that happens."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8389000","8391000"," So but I want you to know something."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8422000","8427000"," If they fucking roll those numbers down people are going to get bearishes fuck."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8427000","8430000"," And even if those numbers are up there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8430000","8434000"," You would likely get a push higher."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8434000","8438000"," And then a major pullback to buy for the quarter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8438000","8442000"," So putting money on this market for the quarter you have time."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8508000","8509000"," Let's trade some weeklies."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8509000","8511000"," That kind of stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8511000","8514000"," I hate being on this stream with a lot of people."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8514000","8519000"," We're wrapping our shit up and people are just getting bullish or just getting bearish."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8519000","8521000"," Because I know they're getting torched."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8521000","8523000"," I don't want you to get torched out there."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8523000","8525000"," I want you to like have a good quarter."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8531000","8534000"," Let's hit the fuck out of here and take a vacation."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8534000","8537000"," It's hard work trading a quarter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8537000","8539000"," It takes so much dedication."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8539000","8541000"," You're on it 24 hours a day."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8541000","8544000"," You're fucking eating and drinking and fucking sleeping this market."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8544000","8546000"," It never fucking ends."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8546000","8549000"," I have panic attacks at nighttime when we're in quarter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8549000","8553000"," Like this next quarter after those first two weeks, I have panic attacks at nighttime."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8553000","8555000"," I stay up all night fucking long."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8555000","8559000"," I sit there sometimes when I know we're on a risk of going down or a risk of going up."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8559000","8563000"," And up all night long making sure that I'm on the right side of shit."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8563000","8569000"," So when we come to an end of quarter, I want you to be able to take that break with me."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8570000","8572000"," Because it's hard fucking work."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8576000","8577000"," Unfinned to it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8577000","8580000"," Those fucking guys eat this market up fucking day in day out."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8580000","8585000"," They're at the fucking they're at the fucking table every day 24 hours a day."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8596000","8600000"," When we come in this time of time of year, time to take a break, a sabbatical."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8600000","8602000"," Time to reset the head."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8602000","8603000"," Get the head back on a swivel."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8603000","8604000"," All that kind of stuff."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8604000","8609000"," And I want you guys to be able to be there at the end of next quarter so you have that same experience."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8609000","8614000"," It's important for you as an investor and trader to have that mentality."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8614000","8617000"," That's part of what we do."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8617000","8622000"," So if you're out there and you're watching me and you're one of those people that already does that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8622000","8624000"," Take some time off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8624000","8626000"," Enjoy this week off."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8626000","8630000"," And I'll be back with you guys on the fifth."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8651000","8652000"," I don't know."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8652000","8656000"," I never started this to make this what it is right now."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8656000","8659000"," Never started this so that we'd have this many people following us."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8659000","8663000"," Never started this because I thought I'd be a fucking streamer or anything like that."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8663000","8664000"," Never."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8664000","8669000"," And I never thought it would turn into something where you guys are my family like literally."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8669000","8672000"," I spent last weekend with Winky."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8672000","8674000"," It was like a family member to me."

"lnmFX4MuFes","8697000","8699000"," Close the computer."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8699000","8701000"," Place your trades for the fifth."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8701000","8703000"," And take a fucking breather."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8703000","8707000"," If they burn on Wednesday, the fifth, it doesn't fucking matter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8708000","8709000"," It really doesn't matter."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8709000","8710000"," Don't worry about it."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8712000","8713000"," Take your sabbatical."
"lnmFX4MuFes","8713000","8716000"," Get your head on for the next quarter."
