"Oh2Mp9wfq10","317000","320000"," Right off the open."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","320000","322000"," Four twelve low of four eleven."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","322000","325000"," I wish I could have grabbed it down below here at four eleven."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","325000","327000"," But that's fine."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","327000","332000"," So I've got some Friday calls."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","332000","335000"," Looking for a pen even if we continue down."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","335000","337000"," I like the idea of being down here long."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","337000","340000"," Some calls so into at least."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","340000","342000"," On the next couple days."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","342000","344000"," A fairly cheap price."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","344000","348000"," I guess your question night next question down here to be how how low can we go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","348000","351000"," Probably a little bit more."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","351000","355000"," But the path of OPEC."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","355000","360000"," You're trying to tell me we're going down a four hundred or four ten maybe."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","360000","363000"," Into Wednesday Thursday Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","363000","365000"," I'm going to say."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","365000","368000"," I don't believe you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","368000","371000"," I'm just going to say it okay."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","371000","374000"," I don't believe you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","374000","376000"," I don't."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","377000","380000"," So we'll talk about that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","380000","387000"," You know we came up here since October and you're trying to tell me we're going to fucking murder the market."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","387000","389000"," Like today and tomorrow."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","389000","396000"," Like there's some tricky dickiness to the OPEC's I'm going to tell you any low that we get into OPEC's you buy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","396000","399000"," And that's what I've been looking for right a Bible dip."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","399000","405000"," So even if it's not here if I have to take that trade one more time and a lower price I will."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","406000","409000"," If I can get it even lower."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","409000","411000"," So be it but I don't think it's going to be large."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","411000","415000"," We're like you can see we we pinned sideways yesterday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","415000","422000"," I drew that yellow line yesterday and was telling you guys the stream like if we don't get over this yellow line."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","422000","426000"," We're going to pin into the clothes and that's what we fucking did we pinned into the clothes."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","426000","429000"," So you got futures selling going on."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","430000","435000"," And if they're giving us a chance to buy a dip then thank you futures traders."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","435000","437000"," I don't know what else to say."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","437000","441000"," At that point and look at that we're trending right away so."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","441000","444000"," You do your thing out there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","444000","448000"," Whatever it is you're going to do and."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","448000","450000"," Sweet."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","451000","453000"," Squeezing right off of the open."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","453000","458000"," The spicy honey great wall of coupon up here for like four fifteen."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","458000","462000"," I was up here and then they were at the bottom of the range right now believe it or not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","462000","464000"," So we're squeezing right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","464000","465000"," Maybe."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","465000","467000"," Keep on squeezing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","471000","474000"," Nice little green by right there off the open."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","474000","476000"," A whole bunch of stuff to clean up above here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","477000","482000"," I still haven't done the pivot yet so we're going to do the pivot talk about that this morning."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","482000","485000"," I was too busy this morning."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","485000","493000"," I was doing some some more research this morning on some statements that I've been making."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","493000","501000"," And should we put the spicy honey grape we'll put that back up again this funny grape on wall."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","501000","503000"," We knew that was there yesterday right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","503000","507000"," We're all in agreement finally today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","507000","514000"," That was actually there yesterday we weren't in agreement yesterday we are now in agreement of it today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","514000","522000"," So we still have this down below here we've got this previous low sitting around at four eleven oh eight I was hoping we get four eleven oh eight."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","522000","527000"," And some other lows down here but I don't know if we're getting those I can leave these here for you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","527000","530000"," We'll put these back later."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","530000","533000"," We head back down down below there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","533000","539000"," And we're going to do the points at four fourteen twelve."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","539000","549000"," Four fourteen twelve way up here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","549000","554000"," That's right keep on squeezing baby."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","555000","558000"," S one."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","558000","567000"," Support down below we've got four twelve seventy five S one is down here four twelve seventy five."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","567000","571000"," Almost the perfect pin strike right there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","571000","573000"," S two."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","573000","579000"," Our beer is getting all bearish this morning getting all crazy out there probably I haven't checked."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","580000","603000"," And we'll tell you what Disney to we get a bunch of stuff to talk about but we have the conversation I want to have with you this morning specifically has to do with."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","604000","609000"," Specifically banks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","609000","622000"," And I'll say here four fifteen our one is pretty high our one is four fifteen sixty nine."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","623000","632000"," And four seventeen eighteen."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","632000","636000"," Oh dude that's so juicy up there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","636000","639000"," So juicy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","639000","642000"," So juicy up there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","642000","647000"," I'm just going to ride these fucking calls man I'm not I'm not getting off them."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","648000","650000"," Four fourteen sixty three."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","650000","654000"," I might I might be over exaggerating here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","654000","658000"," I want diamond hand these fucking things right to four twenty."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","658000","662000"," I'll be honest with you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","662000","669000"," I just want to diamond hand these fucking things and just rip some faces off for like three days."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","669000","672000"," Hope enough to monetize that quickly so there we go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","672000","675000"," Right off the opening bell the early trigger."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","675000","684000"," But anyways with the reason I want to say this because we talked about business cycles."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","684000","687000"," Key point here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","687000","690000"," Is we had this major discussion."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","690000","697000"," About business cycles business cycles to say it again business cycles."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","697000","700000"," I do want to see."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","700000","705000"," Four thirteen twenty one."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","705000","708000"," Right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","708000","710000"," Here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","710000","720000"," Re-expecting some vol up in here for thirteen twenty one."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","720000","721000"," Hourly trigger."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","721000","723000"," Up here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","724000","728000"," There's some volume there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","728000","735000"," And."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","735000","739000"," Take a look at something here for you real quick."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","739000","744000"," Wednesday Wednesday yeah we could have more down."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","744000","748000"," There could be more role."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","749000","753000"," But I don't think it matters I think what matters is into."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","753000","757000"," Friday it resolves to a pretty giant fucking squeeze on a Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","757000","760000"," So yeah I guess maybe I might be over."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","760000","765000"," Possible that I could be over I could be oversimplifying that squeeze up in a Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","765000","768000"," Possible."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","768000","773000"," But I think ultimately leads to."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","774000","777000"," Chase for twenty."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","777000","782000"," In a Friday chase for fifteen Friday chase for twenty in a Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","782000","792000"," And I'm not willing to wait until Thursday or Friday at twelve o'clock in the afternoon to chase it so we'll see if this holds up."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","792000","798000"," So what I'm going to do here is just keep my eyes on price."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","798000","802000"," Staying above the white line."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","803000","806000"," Same rules apply and matter."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","806000","811000"," Same rules right if we begin to roll over here at any point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","811000","815000"," I will take the money and run or I will."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","815000","818000"," Close in position to go short again."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","818000","823000"," So I don't know if it starts today I guess I'm trying to say it's going to start today but it might not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","823000","827000"," It's still a potential for a role lower but even even even so."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","827000","832000"," The resolution is to the upside on clothes on Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","832000","836000"," In my view."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","836000","843000"," The resolution is into the close of Friday is to the upside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","843000","848000"," In my view right now unless something like that's something changes."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","849000","856000"," The resolution is to the upside in a Friday in my view."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","856000","867000"," Right here a little rejection of the five in on that red candle that red box right there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","867000","872000"," You can see that an S one right now trade up to S one."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","872000","897000"," I'm going to talk about this."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","898000","902000"," Seasonality of the business cycle."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","902000","907000"," And we did not see regional banks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","907000","910000"," This is a key point because I was talking some friends about this."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","910000","913000"," We saw like the Bank of America did really great."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","913000","916000"," We had some great bank earnings."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","916000","922000"," Now we had other bank earnings that have been so great right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","922000","926000"," So we're going to talk about business cycle one more time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","927000","934000"," I think I think we talk about some things here and then we don't revisit them or."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","934000","936000"," Some people aren't in the stream."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","936000","938000"," Oh, I got to post the stream to Twitter."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","938000","939000"," Hold on."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","939000","942000"," Probably talk about Twitter today at some point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","942000","945000"," Let's see here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","957000","971000"," We'll talk about Tesla earnings today as well, of course."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","971000","976000"," And."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","977000","985000"," Post that right there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","985000","987000"," We're going to talk about business."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","987000","989000"," We're going to go back into."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","989000","993000"," We know we talk about things a few times where it's like we."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","993000","999000"," We start a conversation and then we have to revisit revisit revisit revisit revisit revisit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1000000","1007000"," Until we're throwing it up, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1007000","1010000"," And it's like he just talks about it all the time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1010000","1018000"," And then we move on to the next thing to talk about."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1018000","1023000"," One good thing is when we start these conversations and we regurgitate them 20 times."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1023000","1025000"," They tend to work themselves out more tent."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1025000","1028000"," We tend to be talking with them before anyone else is talking about them."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1028000","1029000"," So."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1029000","1034000"," And I'm fascinated by this because I don't see a lot of people talking about this still."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1034000","1043000"," Some some still kind of scratch in my head here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1043000","1049000"," And I think I was having a conversation with a with a friend and I said."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1050000","1053000"," I was told, Hey, can you buy like a."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1053000","1055000"," Can you buy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1055000","1059000"," Now, financials and."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1059000","1064000"," My take on that is yes."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1064000","1068000"," But be prepared to hold them for."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1068000","1071000"," A long period of time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1071000","1078000"," And, you know, could they print in this earning cycle."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1079000","1083000"," And the answer is yes."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1083000","1086000"," But if they don't."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1086000","1088000"," You're just early."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1088000","1094000"," So we talked about that the past couple of weeks on the show."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1094000","1099000"," About about specifically about."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1099000","1102000"," What the fuck is going on with my."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1103000","1113000"," There we go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1113000","1127000"," I talked about that on the on the show the past few weeks about business cycles sector rotation."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1127000","1129000"," This is stock charts.com."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1129000","1133000"," This is their business cycle."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1133000","1137000"," Map, maybe I can."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1137000","1141000"," Move that over a little bit for you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1141000","1151000"," Right there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1151000","1155000"," And there's some some key points here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1155000","1163000"," The key things to keep focused on."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1163000","1170000"," This is where financials get whacked, right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1170000","1178000"," And you've seen financials take a hit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1178000","1183000"," Here's the end of the bear market."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1183000","1188000"," Real estate getting whacked, right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1188000","1193000"," And we're actually coming into buying tech."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1193000","1198000"," Buying discretionary."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1199000","1203000"," Then we buy communication services and industrials, right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1203000","1205000"," They move into materials and energy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1205000","1208000"," So this is like buying."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1208000","1210000"," And leaving behind."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1210000","1212000"," So you're leaving real estate behind."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1212000","1215000"," You're leaving financials behind."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1215000","1224000"," And so we won't come back into financials for a period of time is my point to where you're buying into them."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1224000","1226000"," You know, you've got like full recession."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1227000","1230000"," Market bottom."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1230000","1237000"," Early recovery bull market looking forward to, right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1237000","1242000"," And I think we were seeing that this week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1242000","1246000"," Or I think we're seeing that heading into the into this OPEC."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1246000","1251000"," With a better expectation for financials and them not performing as much as."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1251000","1254000"," Oh, did you think we're crashing here? Is that what you thought?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1254000","1259000"," Probably."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1259000","1271000"," But I want you to think about that is that you've got the, you've got the."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1271000","1277000"," You've got the Hey, we're all buying tech and we're all buying discretionary."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1277000","1283000"," Then we're all going to start buying communication services and industrials."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1284000","1289000"," And then we're all going to buy materials and energy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1289000","1292000"," So you can front run these trades."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1292000","1295000"," It doesn't mean you don't buy financials."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1295000","1297000"," For real estate."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1297000","1300000"," That's why we sell a real estate."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1300000","1303000"," That's why I'm like, yeah, we probably haven't seen the end."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1303000","1307000"," Of some kind of like that's why you hear me say in the stream all the time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1307000","1308000"," I was like, yeah."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1309000","1315000"," You probably haven't seen the end of real estate crisis."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1315000","1321000"," If you're looking for a ball into May or June or July."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1321000","1325000"," My assumption is to get some vol it's going to be related to that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1325000","1331000"," Now, whether it's real or bullshit, like the regional bank bullshit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1331000","1335000"," It's just looking for a reason, right? We're going to create a reason."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1336000","1339000"," I'm assuming."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1339000","1344000"," Some banks and some other."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1344000","1350000"," People smart, wealthy people know that we're coming into the end of, you know, or the tail."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1350000","1353000"," Tail risk and financials, so they get all drama."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1353000","1355000"," You know, they get like soap, opera."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1355000","1359000"," And I'm assuming you'll get that some of that same thing happen in real estate."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1359000","1362000"," A little bit more probably have a little bit more of that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1362000","1364000"," Maybe we are done, but anyways."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1365000","1370000"," So what does that mean, right? If we're looking at this business cycle."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1370000","1374000"," Probably looking at the tech."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1374000","1380000"," Under performing, just not over performing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1380000","1383000"," Discretionary, probably staying pretty strong."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1383000","1384000"," Ish."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1384000","1387000"," Doing okay. Commercial service is probably driven face off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1387000","1389000"," This stream is sponsored by ticks."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1398000","1402000"," A lot of fervor right now around social media."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1402000","1408000"," A lot of companies this past two weeks have been have been quietly announcing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1408000","1414000"," Well, they're forays into social media."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1414000","1419000"," And expansion of services and social media, not just x company x by."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1419000","1422000"," Elon Musk, but there's some other companies."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1422000","1425000"," They're all like dabbling in it right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1426000","1429000"," And so XLI with a beautiful dip."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1429000","1437000"," Are are in."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1437000","1438000"," Excuse me."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1438000","1439000"," Nice."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1439000","1440000"," I'm an XLI right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1441000","1445000"," Get a beautiful one down here on March 13th and 14th."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1445000","1447000"," I'm interested in XLI here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1447000","1450000"," Believe it or you might look at the XLI here and say, oh, this is all bad."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1450000","1454000"," But XLI specifically has a lot of a lot of demand, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1454000","1456000"," They had demand in December."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1456000","1458000"," Demand in March."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1458000","1460000"," And price has an amount of demand."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1460000","1462000"," And price has an amount of demand."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1462000","1465000"," And price has an amount of demand."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1465000","1467000"," Demand in December."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1467000","1469000"," Demand in March."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1469000","1473000"," And price hasn't really shown itself an XLI."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1473000","1475000"," So I'm like, yeah, look at all this."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1475000","1476000"," Just look at XLI."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1476000","1481000"," It's like just primed and ready to go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1481000","1486000"," Just primed and ready to go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1486000","1488000"," So we'll talk about it again."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1488000","1492000"," XLI."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1492000","1496000"," We talked the last time I had this conversation with you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1503000","1505000"," We discussed XLI."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1505000","1512000"," And if I could drink, if I dig that video up, I guarantee I can find the hour conversation"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1512000","1513000"," what I had."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1513000","1516000"," And I said, let's look at some of these companies in XLI."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1516000","1520000"," And they've done nothing but rip faces off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1521000","1525000"," We talked about Home Depot, Lowe's, McDonald's, all those companies."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1525000","1528000"," They've done nothing but rip faces off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1528000","1531000"," Since that time, we talked about those companies."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1534000","1536000"," And there was a whole discussion that we had."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1536000","1538000"," And I was like, look at all these companies right here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1538000","1545000"," They're all inside of the heavy waders inside of these S&P 500 sectors."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1545000","1547000"," And they're already being front run."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1551000","1558000"," So with all of that said."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1558000","1562000"," It's breather here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1562000","1566000"," All that blabbing out of the way."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1566000","1573000"," I find it hard to believe that if we're rotating."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1573000","1578000"," Into a bottom and into a new business cycle."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1579000","1585000"," Now that I expect a market crash, I'm not going to do it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1585000","1593000"," And furthermore, I'm going to expect the better performance out of the S&P 500 than I am."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1593000","1595000"," Maybe at a tech right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1595000","1598000"," Tech will do well, but not like the S&P 500."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1598000","1601000"," The S&P 500 is cycling into sector after sector."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1601000","1605000"," So if you're looking for some downside this summer,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1606000","1608000"," we talked about this yesterday and the day before."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1608000","1610000"," Where is the risk, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1610000","1611000"," This whole past week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1611000","1614000"," It's like, where's the risk in the summertime?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1614000","1619000"," Commercial real estate, possibly some kind of drama with that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1619000","1624000"," We know the Fed is saying one more rate increase than a pause."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1624000","1628000"," We know that as long as they pause rates."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1628000","1631000"," We know as long as they pause rates."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1631000","1636000"," And we know as long as they increase rates."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1636000","1641000"," Now we haven't broken anything."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1641000","1645000"," So unless they do some pausing of some kind, not pausing,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1645000","1648000"," but rate cutting of some kind."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1648000","1651000"," Markets should trade to the sideways and up, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1651000","1653000"," To trade the right and up."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1653000","1657000"," So the business cycle seems like that seems like it's saying,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1657000","1660000"," hey, we're moving on."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1661000","1665000"," So I don't see vol from the only thing that's evolved in the Fed"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1665000","1666000"," from."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1666000","1669000"," I mean, we'll get some intraday vol like Fed raises rates."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1669000","1670000"," We sell off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1670000","1671000"," Okay."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1671000","1672000"," But is it the market crash?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1672000","1673000"," Probably not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1673000","1678000"," We have rotation into other sectors in the S&P 500."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1678000","1683000"," So should the S&P 500 crash if we're rotating in other sectors on"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1683000","1684000"," a large scale?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1684000","1685000"," Probably not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1685000","1687000"," Debt ceiling."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1687000","1689000"," We've talked about that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1690000","1693000"," We know the last time that that made a difference."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1693000","1696000"," Last time that the debt ceiling actually created real vol."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1696000","1698000"," We crashed, I think."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1698000","1701000"," I want to say it June 1st or right in and around there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1701000","1707000"," I actually think we could get that vol prior to what we got it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1707000","1709000"," When we got it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1709000","1711000"," Last time, I think."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1711000","1714000"," My thought process is here is either."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1714000","1717000"," If everyone's going to load into that trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1718000","1720000"," In June, maybe they do it May."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1720000","1725000"," Or maybe it comes at the end of June."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1725000","1727000"," If everyone's expecting it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1727000","1731000"," In June, everybody's loading tits full of puts for the."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1731000","1735000"," Debt ceiling crisis, but just because they want it really bad."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1735000","1737000"," I don't know what to."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1737000","1740000"," I don't know what to make of that, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1740000","1743000"," Everybody's like short, short, short, short, short, short, short, short."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1744000","1748000"," So I don't know."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1748000","1751000"," I don't know if."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1751000","1755000"," If the debt ceiling can do unless it's real."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1755000","1758000"," It has to be real."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1758000","1760000"," For us."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1760000","1762000"," For it to send us over."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1762000","1765000"," It's probably going to be worth at least getting some zero day put."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1765000","1768000"," Not zero dates, but like OTM puts or something."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1768000","1771000"," Some kind of like lotto taken for the month of June."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1772000","1777000"," Maybe get him in May before everybody else doesn't collect the premium on that trade heading into June."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1777000","1781000"," If it happens before June, so so much the better."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1781000","1785000"," If it doesn't, we just squeeze higher and higher and higher into the end of June."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1785000","1788000"," Maybe take the trade a second time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1788000","1790000"," OTM puts again."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1790000","1792000"," They're cheap."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1792000","1795000"," Pay four, five thousand percent, ten thousand percent."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1795000","1796000"," If it happens."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1796000","1800000"," So what's the cost layout to benefit pretty fucking pretty fucking low, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1801000","1808000"," That's how you deal with that's how you deal with the debt ceiling in June."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1809000","1811000"," There are people out there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1811000","1819000"," I think Chase Winters said the other day he was talking about the market become marking go wherever it wants."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1819000","1826000"," After this OPEC's due to the pin that's into OPEC's."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1827000","1829000"," The options complex stuff like that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1829000","1831000"," And I think bears are looking for that too."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1831000","1840000"," They're like, Hey, all these options are going to close in the OPEC's and the pin into four 24 10 or whatever."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1840000","1842000"," Is released from the market."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1848000","1849000"," And go wherever it wants to go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1850000","1853000"," But we saw last quarter, what happened, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1853000","1855000"," Last quarter."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1855000","1857000"," Last quarter."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1857000","1858000"," Last quarter."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1858000","1859000"," It didn't go dead."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1859000","1861000"," Well, it kind of went sideways."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1861000","1864000"," End up."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1864000","1869000"," It definitely didn't go up and monetize."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1870000","1878000"," It definitely didn't go up and monetize."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1878000","1879000"," Let's say."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1879000","1880000"," It just went like, look at this."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1880000","1882000"," I'm looking at February 2nd."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1882000","1884000"," We just, we just, we just like melted higher."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1884000","1901000"," So January, so or so January 1 of 2023."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1901000","1903000"," We just, we just kept going up, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1903000","1905000"," We just ripped faces."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1905000","1907000"," Into."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1908000","1911000"," We ripped faces into the second."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1911000","1915000"," Into February 2nd."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1915000","1917000"," So we're on 419."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1917000","1920000"," Well, congratulations to all the hippie pot smokers out there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1920000","1921000"," It's almost four 20."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1921000","1926000"," It's a, it's a, it's a world holiday for a lot of people, I guess."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1926000","1932000"," We ended up ripping faces and then not only do we have faces, we squeezed."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1932000","1933000"," We squeezed."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1934000","1936000"," We squeezed unrelenting."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1936000","1938000"," Into February 2nd, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1938000","1940000"," Like face ripping."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1940000","1944000"," We ripped faces off into February 2nd of 2023."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1944000","1946000"," We got a pullback."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1946000","1949000"," Into March 13th."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1949000","1951000"," To three 79."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1951000","1952000"," 380."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1952000","1957000"," We didn't even get into March 13th."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1958000","1961000"," To three 79."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1961000","1962000"," 380."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1962000","1964000"," We didn't even get to 3600."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1964000","1966000"," That magnet didn't do shit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1966000","1969000"," And then we trade it up to where we are."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1969000","1973000"," We trade right up into what into the March 30th."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1973000","1977000"," To those previous highs that we had."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1977000","1981000"," And you have JPM raising the bottom of the collar."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1981000","1986000"," JPM's telling you, uh, volatility is lower."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1987000","1991000"," Uh, we're not getting the ball from Jerome Powell."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1991000","1993000"," So where's, where's the volatility at?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1993000","1995000"," I guess my question."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1995000","1999000"," Like circling back around to where is the volatility?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","1999000","2001000"," Where is the volatility?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2001000","2003000"," Where is the volatility?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2003000","2006000"," The other thing too is I'm noticing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2006000","2009000"," In my own trading the past few weeks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2009000","2013000"," That any, any mistiming any, any wrong trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2014000","2017000"," Seems like if you just hold it Prince eventually."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2017000","2019000"," Get a weekly call or something, monthly call."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2019000","2021000"," Uh, those dips are all being bought."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2021000","2024000"," So there's money coming back into the stock market."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2024000","2027000"," Not a ton, but there's some money coming back into the stock market."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2027000","2031000"," It's a little more forgiving than it's been."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2031000","2034000"," In the past."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2035000","2042000"," I mean, so just based on prior, prior experience into the end of the month."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2042000","2047000"," Uh, I would say the risk is to the upside, not to the downside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2047000","2050000"," It's likely to the upside and then the end of the month."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2050000","2051000"," That's where the risk is."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2051000","2052000"," The risk."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2052000","2054000"," I don't see it to the downside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2054000","2057000"," Um, I'm not seeing it in the VIX either."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2057000","2059000"," I see that grind higher."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2059000","2064000"," I see that, I see the, I see the grind force going, uh, a forceful trade to the upside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2064000","2065000"," So."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2065000","2067000"," We talked last week too about."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2067000","2070000"," Talked last week to about, uh, the jagged trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2070000","2074000"," I showed you guys the VIX where it like just trades jaggedly."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2075000","2078000"," Up down a dollar, a half dollar, a dollar, just grunt."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2078000","2080000"," Like the VIX just ends up grinding."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2082000","2084000"," And that's pretty much what's been happening."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2084000","2088000"," We did have some pretty, pretty big selling of all yesterday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2088000","2090000"," And price wasn't worth it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2090000","2094000"," And we did have some pretty, pretty big selling of all yesterday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2094000","2096000"," And price wasn't worth it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2096000","2100000"," And we did have some, pretty, pretty big selling of all yesterday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2101000","2105000"," And price wasn't reflected in the S&P 500 either."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2105000","2106000"," Was it?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2106000","2110000"," Talked about yesterday about how the price to the upside wasn't reflected in the"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2110000","2112000"," vol selling taking place in VIX."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2131000","2137000"," A little bit of a vid, uh, bid in VIX right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2149000","2151000"," Look for a quick reversal here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2155000","2157000"," If not, all the better."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2161000","2165000"," I'm trying to find the, I'm trying to find the, uh, the volatility."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2165000","2166000"," We're there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2166000","2171000"," One of the guys from Ukraine yesterday who is or two days ago."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2171000","2175000"," He, I don't know if he is the prime, never, not Zelensky, but one of his"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2175000","2178000"," like top generals or somebody doesn't make a ton of predictions."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2178000","2181000"," And he made a public prediction a day or two ago."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2182000","2184000"," Now that victory was near."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2185000","2188000"," Now, supposedly this guy doesn't fluff talk."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2190000","2192000"," So we've discussed on the channel."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2193000","2195000"," A few different scenarios."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2196000","2199000"," Uh, that, uh, do we get a truce this summer?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2199000","2201000"," Is there a bloodbath?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2202000","2203000"," Uh, this summer."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2204000","2208000"," It has become like a mass casualty event that draws intervention from the"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2208000","2209000"," UN or a truce."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2210000","2214000"," Um, or even just something that's a mass casualty event in Ukraine where a"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2214000","2217000"," lot of Ukrainian soldiers get run over."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2217000","2218000"," I don't know if it's Russians."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2218000","2220000"," I don't know if it's Ukrainians."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2220000","2224000"," They get run over or if that's the ball for this, I'm trying to find like the"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2224000","2227000"," ball, the event that could do that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2231000","2233000"," It has a commercial real estate, maybe."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2235000","2238000"," Is it, uh, unknown rate hikes?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2239000","2240000"," Is it?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2242000","2247000"," Is it, um, debt ceiling?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2247000","2249000"," Is it Ukraine war?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2250000","2251000"," Something unseen."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2252000","2254000"," I mean, there are a lot of knowns, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2254000","2258000"," We had a lot of, we had a lot of known reasons for volatility last year."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2259000","2262000"," And believe it or not, the year before and believe it or not in December of"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2262000","2264000"," 2020, we had a lot of reasons, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2265000","2269000"," Heading into the end of the year of 2020, we did get the bear market"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2269000","2270000"," actually started."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2271000","2273000"," In December of 2020."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2274000","2277000"," Whether you know that or not, we were taking, as a matter of fact,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2277000","2280000"," an old, close friend of mine, I don't talk to him as much anymore,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2280000","2281000"," but horse lover fat."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2282000","2283000"," I used to be closer to him."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2284000","2286000"," And we were all selling out of stocks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2287000","2290000"," In December of 2020, there's a lot of bulls on fin to it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2290000","2292000"," They were like, why are you doing this?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2293000","2294000"," We're like, we're out of here, man."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2295000","2296000"," Take the money and fucking run."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2297000","2300000"," And whether you know, some of you know this, a lot of the people that don't"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2300000","2301000"," know this are not in the marketing longer."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2301000","2302000"," They lost everything."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2303000","2304000"," And they got rolled."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2304000","2305000"," They got rolled hard."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2305000","2308000"," There are participants in the stock market in 2020."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2309000","2312000"," They were buying tops on some real, not risky, but just really"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2312000","2315000"," speculative growth shit and all their money just went gone."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2316000","2318000"," And they were sent back to Wendy's."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2325000","2326000"," You don't hear from those people anymore."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2326000","2327000"," They're just gone."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2331000","2334000"," And so the member market's been gone for a long time here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2334000","2335000"," It was my point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2335000","2340000"," And for the downside to the S&P 500, I don't know."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2340000","2343000"," I don't know where that is or how what triggers that right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2345000","2346000"," Now to happen."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2346000","2362000"," Trying to knock and see if we can get through this."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2403000","2406000"," And price starts to break below the white line."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2407000","2409000"," I'll close my lungs for Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2409000","2411000"," Take a short in here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2411000","2414000"," Or a long put position for further downside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2415000","2419000"," So as long as this doesn't happen here, I'm staying long for"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2419000","2422000"," this trade higher here into Friday."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2433000","2436000"," I'll just leave the five minute chart here so you can see it."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2502000","2508000"," weeklies on the opening bell."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2508000","2511000"," I like the idea of buying Tesla down here this morning."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2512000","2517000"," But with a longer trade like spreads for a month."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2519000","2522000"," In the money spreads."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2526000","2530000"," I guarantee that there'll be people in this stream today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2531000","2534000"," Asking if they should buy zero dates on this bell on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2535000","2538000"," I think if you were to put risk on to an upside trade on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","2539000","2543000"," Into into like people are like, I want to trade."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3067640","3072320"," I'd bet that it we got more gray days here like overcast days than"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3073360","3075640"," likely any other place in the United States"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3080840","3082840"," So I'm just like begging for some some"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3107360","3111720"," Then you get like a couple kick-ass bluebird days even if it's cold"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3112120","3116280"," That's the difference, right? I don't really care if it's cold as long as you get a bluebird"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3116760","3118920"," bright sunny day"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3231280","3235240"," You like we trade sideways today, but I'm can we get another day of sideways?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3236680","3238680"," And I'm like no we're at the bottom end"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3240120","3243440"," We're pretty much the bottom end of trading to the upside"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3245200","3250700"," Close enough horseshoes and hand grades four eleven forty seven. I'll take it. I was looking for this yesterday"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3251760","3256760"," And didn't get it like four eleven. I don't know four or three four or four if I was lucky"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3257160","3262520"," Time was running out in my view to get down to four or three four or four like the clock was ticking"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3266560","3270760"," Clock's ticking we got Thursday and Friday"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3274840","3277440"," You know today's Wednesday we got two more days"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3286320","3288680"," four four hundred and four oh three"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3290640","3293760"," So my guess here is we got two more days if you're a bear"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3294800","3301320"," I'm gonna not warn you, but I told you this earlier told you this weeks ago and when we peed it"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3302200","3304880"," Because I tell you guys before never after"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3305640","3307640"," You remember that"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3307640","3309640"," before never after"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3310640","3314200"," So and that's the real fucking brass tacks, so"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3315280","3320480"," My point here is if you're a bear you want to start selling like that selling may go away shit"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3320680","3324440"," You might have to fucking wait until like the second third fourth fifth"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3326960","3329520"," Or at least if you're gonna try to sell may"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3331960","3333960"," I would say"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3334880","3338160"," Can I take a squeeze higher into first week of May"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3338920","3340920"," Make sure you're building it building it around"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3343960","3349160"," If you're really building around selling may just be like hey can I take a squeeze higher from here and"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3351440","3356960"," Into like May 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 15th even possibly I don't think it gets that that crispy"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3359080","3364360"," But like and less price proves otherwise, so you put the trade on"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3364880","3366880"," That sells may I"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3367520","3375160"," Would have a you'd probably have better luck in tech than you would in as some p500 get your no pads out"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3379120","3384440"," Get your fucking crayons out and if you were any Marines out there get your triangle crayons out"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3384440","3386440"," So don't roll off the fucking table"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3386440","3390200"," Get out your coloring books if you want to sell may then"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3390440","3398480"," As before I always let the right around this time. I like the idea of ratio spreads and"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3399560","3405520"," I think you should probably go after tech more than S&P 500. I think that I"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3408720","3415640"," Would temper or tamper your your expectations for downside moves in the S&P 500"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3415640","3419120"," So if you're like him, I want to sell the S&P cap. I'd be like, okay"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3420360","3425680"," And there's there's people out there saying the JPM call or we're gonna roll down to fucking"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3425680","3431240"," I don't know 3,300 or something like that. I'd be like, yeah, how about start with something more in the money and"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3431880","3435240"," Then you trade it level and level down to that 3,300 or whatever"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3436360","3438360"," So if you're still in that collapse mode"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3438720","3441520"," Just take it level to level in the S&P 500, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3442000","3444080"," Talk about that a lot with the S&P 500"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3444080","3448960"," I'm like I'm like you have to go level to level you can't just be like fucking max short right now"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3449040","3451040"," Is there there's nothing saying that you should be"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3452920","3457920"," Isn't there's no ball that I can think of that's saying like max lever"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3460960","3466560"," Short here they could be there. I don't fucking see it. So"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3467480","3472280"," If something's really truly overbought like crazy overbought like Nvidia or something sure"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3474360","3476800"," You can do that you can probably use TLT as well"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3477600","3481640"," To look for when to time that right if TLT can get down a little bit more"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3482200","3486240"," You might be able to time the market roll with that using TLT"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3487200","3492600"," I would temper your expectations in the S&P 500 and probably try to target specific shit"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3492600","3495280"," That's been just ripping faces off since October December"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3507800","3511720"," Army always has to bolster their low self-esteem by making fun of Marines"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3514480","3516480"," Love it"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3521200","3523200"," GI Joe baby"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3537680","3539680"," Yeah"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3539680","3541680"," Yeah Ohio sucks"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3542080","3544680"," Besides affordability. Yeah, I agree with that"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3545480","3549840"," There's some good parts though. I'll but I've I have family with"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3550840","3553680"," Homes there. I couldn't live there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3555520","3559480"," Then it matter of fact I mostly I live in Detroit for"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3560360","3562360"," As a matter of fact"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3562440","3564440"," well due to"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3565440","3569640"," Wanting to be a part of like a 20-year 30-year plan of"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3571320","3575840"," Buying very cheap for an expectation that Detroit's gonna make a comeback someday"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3577720","3585280"," It's for most of my kids wealth and that kind of stuff but at the same time I wanted to have cultural experiences to and not be growing up"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3586640","3589080"," Most of their lives in a in a rich ski town"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3590040","3593080"," Because I do believe we live one life my personally so"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3595440","3603800"," It's a matter of fact on that same note too. I was looking at a place called Highland Park"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3605440","3607440"," It's in Michigan"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3608240","3610240"," It's outside of Detroit"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3611040","3613840"," And it's kind of sandwiched"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3614800","3619360"," It's this very poor community outside of Detroit part of Detroit Detroit ish"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3620040","3624080"," But they've had they just declared bankruptcy and I had some approvals on bankruptcy take place"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3624920","3631400"," They have real water problems. They went bankrupt over water bills. The Detroit like water Mafia is kind of fucked up"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3632000","3635840"," And Highland Park is like one of those places that could be a great town"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3636640","3642600"," And it's like near Royal Oak and Ferndale and all these really hipster places the north end got bought up and"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3643200","3645600"," for really dirt cheap money and"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3646560","3651200"," And it boomed and Highland Park's coming to this end of this like resolution phase"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3654120","3659240"," So even so I'm like I'm like I'm like I'm gonna leave Detroit now. I'm like yesterday"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3661800","3663080"," I"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3663080","3669520"," Exercised and then I went into a rabbit hole of this place called how in Park and I'm sure if you were to look at it"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3669520","3672400"," It's very risky. This is very risky real estate. I"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3673280","3675280"," Have to admit it's very risky"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3676600","3680840"," But if I was to tell you like hey if you look at a place called Highland Park"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3681720","3683720"," Michigan you should buy like"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3684120","3686120"," Everything that comes to auction this year"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3687920","3689920"," You'd be like you're crazy"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3690760","3697160"," Of course, I'm like well if I spend a couple hundred grand probably turn it into multi millions of dollars"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3698760","3703160"," With enough time in my side so like buying a financials right now"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3704160","3710080"," Regional bank financials. I'm trying to buy a kind of by real estate"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3713680","3716400"," I think there's one more community here that could explode"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3722560","3726640"," Yeah, that's my problem with that's my so my biggest issue here is"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3727400","3731440"," It's great because they have inland seas right they got great lakes and stuff"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3731880","3737760"," There was my main issues here are this no mountains. That's a problem"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3738400","3739640"," For me"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3739640","3744760"," Cuz I'm like I'm mountain centric everything I do is focus around being outside the mountains"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3745760","3750800"," And then no ocean to surf in for me. That's a big two big ones so I can get away with sailing"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3751200","3756040"," Water sports are great here. They've got some grit something got some good decent like"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3756840","3763160"," Single track ish stuff so you can get like get a fix on there's some skiing here"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3763440","3766880"," But one of the cool parts about living here is that I can travel anywhere I want"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3766880","3769680"," So if I want to go out west and ski in the winter done"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3770080","3773320"," If I want to send my wife somewhere to go skiing and live like a rock star done"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3773800","3779040"," If I want to send my kids somewhere to go skiing done no problems like fly wherever we want ski wherever we want"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3780760","3783160"," But I'm thinking more about my kids wealth down the road"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3784160","3789200"," Like I want generational wealth. That's what I want. My goal is generational wealth"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3790800","3794160"," For my family and I know that I can't have that generational wealth"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3795280","3797280"," living in most of those places"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3797600","3802600"," So but those are two big issues here now another issue here is integration"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3804280","3806280"," Has been a challenge"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3806720","3809840"," It's not unattainable. It's just been a challenge"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","3810560","3814240"," Like finding out what is fun here is not easy"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5105560","5108560"," there's nothing saying we haven't have we"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5108560","5111560"," because we went up here and went like that right"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5111560","5114560"," and we went up here and went like that right"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5114560","5118560"," there's nothing saying we can't go something like that either"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5118560","5120560"," four seventeen four eighteen"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5120560","5126560"," maybe we do this quickly up into opex tomorrow or even into friday up in there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5126560","5130560"," and just try to get as hard as you possibly can"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5130560","5132560"," possible"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5132560","5137560"," i'll take my chances with us going up into the next couple days"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5142560","5144560"," bought this"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5144560","5147560"," i don't know i'll take my chances"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5148560","5150560"," i'll take my chances"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5150560","5152560"," i need us to break below four eleven"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5152560","5154560"," in the next two days"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5158560","5160560"," that's happened Thursday Friday"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5160560","5162560"," my assumption here is that a bear is saying"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5162560","5166560"," that we're going to close friday below four ten"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5169560","5171560"," i'm going to disagree with you"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5174560","5176560"," i disagree"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5179560","5181560"," i disagree"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5181560","5186560"," i don't think we close below four ten on opex"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5191560","5193560"," i disagree"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5193560","5195560"," where's the ball"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5195560","5197560"," what's the event ball"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5197560","5201560"," why is there money coming back in the market"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5203560","5206560"," we had no reason to go higher"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5206560","5208560"," no reason"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5208560","5210560"," i think we have a reason to go higher now"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5210560","5214560"," i went to bring this up last week and now i didn't get to talk about it"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5214560","5216560"," like the weekend i was thinking about this"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5216560","5219560"," i texted a buddy and i said"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5219560","5221560"," sentiment matters"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5221560","5223560"," and i think i might have tweeted that too"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5223560","5226560"," because it was on the top of my mind about sentiment"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5226560","5228560"," and how important it is"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5232560","5235560"," and we don't always get to discuss sentiment too often"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5235560","5239560"," i had a few conversations and friends this week where i was like"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5239560","5243560"," i was like if i've got money in a bank making five percent"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5243560","5245560"," it's not out running inflation"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5245560","5247560"," if the feds tell me they're not going to fight inflation"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5247560","5249560"," i have to outrun it"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5251560","5253560"," if my money has been on the sidelines"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5253560","5255560"," for like one two three four years"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5255560","5257560"," at some point i gotta be like fuck it i gotta get back into something"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5257560","5259560"," that's gonna make me some money"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5259560","5261560"," and then that's part of sentiment"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5261560","5263560"," there's like a part of sentiment where"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5265560","5267560"," is there anything out there looming"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5267560","5269560"," the fed"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5273560","5275560"," danger"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5275560","5277560"," fed just told you"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5277560","5279560"," fed just told you"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5279560","5281560"," we're going to support"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5281560","5283560"," anything that breaks"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5283560","5285560"," so if you're like"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5285560","5287560"," you're like an old person or something"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5287560","5289560"," you're like oh they're gonna support everything"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5289560","5291560"," they're saying they're gonna say"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5291560","5293560"," i'm not saying this is real"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5293560","5295560"," it's gonna matter"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5295560","5297560"," but my point here is sentiment"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5299560","5301560"," and uh"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5301560","5303560"," you know just a month or two ago"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5303560","5305560"," uh"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5305560","5307560"," in October and December two i guess"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5307560","5309560"," October and December"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5309560","5311560"," uh we're all looking at 420 going"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5311560","5313560"," yeah that's not possible"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5313560","5315560"," we've got so much shit ahead of us"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5315560","5317560"," this is before the banking crisis"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5317560","5319560"," and all that kind of shit"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5319560","5321560"," so like can we go higher"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5321560","5323560"," very simple question"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5323560","5325560"," can we trade 420"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5325560","5327560"," can we trade 430"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5327560","5329560"," can we trade 460"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5329560","5331560"," uh can we trade in all time high"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5335560","5337560"," you know if the question becomes"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5337560","5339560"," is the answer"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5339560","5341560"," fuck no"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5341560","5343560"," or is the answer"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5343560","5345560"," likely no but"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5345560","5347560"," there's a chance"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5347560","5349560"," is the answer"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5349560","5351560"," maybe"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5351560","5353560"," is the answer"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5353560","5355560"," there's an outside chance"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5355560","5357560"," and think about that"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5357560","5359560"," think about sentiment"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5359560","5363560"," from the human side of the stock market"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5363560","5365560"," and it does play a role"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5365560","5367560"," uh there are still humans out there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5367560","5369560"," with money"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5369560","5371560"," like control a lot of money"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5371560","5373560"," even though they trade with algorithms"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5373560","5375560"," uh there are"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5375560","5377560"," there are humans"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5377560","5379560"," that still make a decision saying"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5379560","5381560"," yeah you know i love these"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5381560","5383560"," algorithms but"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5383560","5385560"," i've got a i've got a"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5385560","5387560"," I've got a knack or I've got a itch"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5387560","5389560"," saying we can go higher"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5389560","5391560"," it's possible"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5391560","5393560"," even if it's a low chance"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5393560","5397560"," of actually getting there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5397560","5399560"," there has been a"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5399560","5401560"," a little"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5401560","5403560"," tiny"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5403560","5405560"," like a tick"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5405560","5407560"," of sentiment shift"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5407560","5409560"," from"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5409560","5413560"," depths of hell"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5413560","5415560"," to"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5415560","5417560"," am I gonna miss a run"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5417560","5419560"," is it possible"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5419560","5421560"," that the market moves higher"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5421560","5425560"," we don't actually have to trade there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5425560","5427560"," we just have to"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5427560","5429560"," sentiment shift"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5431560","5433560"," I"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5433560","5435560"," I feel it"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5441560","5445560"," for"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5445560","5447560"," 1334"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5447560","5449560"," the question becomes"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5449560","5453560"," is that too high?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5453560","5457560"," well i'll tell you what right now in the five minute chart"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5457560","5461560"," right now what's forming"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5461560","5477560"," we know the market hates the front run shit"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5477560","5481560"," now i'm not saying this is here yet"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5481560","5485560"," we're not there yet this is the future"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5495560","5499560"," consolidation"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5499560","5501560"," and then confirmation that we're going higher"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5501560","5503560"," before we just start"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5503560","5505560"," fucking blasting up there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5505560","5507560"," and then roll down here"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5507560","5509560"," either of these"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5509560","5513560"," if you're a bear you want to see a break"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5513560","5517560"," anything down here you want to see the price"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5519560","5521560"," if you're a bear you want to see"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5525560","5527560"," a bull trap"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5533560","5535560"," so you want to see the reversal"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5535560","5537560"," and the confirmation that we're going lower but this right here"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5537560","5541560"," is unlikely i want you to know that"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5542560","5544560"," if it happens"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5544560","5547560"," i could see some consolidation in here"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5571560","5573560"," might as well reprice the vix"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5573560","5575560"," if we don't have any big ball events"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5601560","5603560"," there's no ball there"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5605560","5609560"," but we're not at the uh we're not at the debt ceiling yet"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5609560","5611560"," we're not at the summer offensive yet"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5613560","5617560"," watch out here there's a liquidity break going on the market right now"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5617560","5619560"," be very careful here"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5641560","5643560"," that's actually bullish"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5643560","5645560"," that's actually fucking bullish"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5649560","5651560"," gorman is also saying at least two more"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5651560","5653560"," rate hikes from the Fed are possible"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5655560","5657560"," that means you"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5657560","5661560"," that means that you expect the market to be stabilized for a year"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5665560","5667560"," truthfully that's what it means"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5669560","5671560"," make all honesty"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5671560","5673560"," means stabilized markets for a year"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5673560","5675560"," that's Morgan Stanley"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5675560","5677560"," making that statement"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5679560","5681560"," uh so if you're not going to have volatility"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5681560","5683560"," this year or it's not right now"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5683560","5685560"," you have three price of x"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5686560","5690560"," can't be fucking trading 30 fucking dollars on the VIX"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5692560","5694560"," if there's no known vol in the future"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5695560","5697560"," or at least now"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5697560","5700560"," I guess you can get 30 in June or July with the debt ceiling"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5704560","5707560"," but I mean fuck 20 bucks we probably need to go to 11"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5707560","5709560"," 14"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5709560","5711560"," uh how about not 11 I wouldn't say 11"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5711560","5713560"," 11 would be"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5713560","5715560"," bull run"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5715560","5717560"," so if if 11's bull run"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5721560","5723560"," if 11 is bull run"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5723560","5725560"," and we're not bull run"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5725560","5727560"," what 16 51"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5731560","5735560"," probably trade 14 75 14 11"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5737560","5739560"," 14 75 14 11"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5744560","5746560"," like 14 15 bucks"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5747560","5751560"," you know how like you know there's a time when you could buy the VIX at 19 20 bucks"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5753560","5755560"," and you kind of had a pretty safe bet"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5756560","5759560"," like I'm going to buy the VIX at 19 20 bucks"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5760560","5763560"," we're likely going to roll over here and trade the VIX to 30"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5764560","5766560"," worked"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5766560","5768560"," quite well"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5769560","5773560"," but if we got nothing on the table guaranteed"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5776560","5778560"," I don't know that it's a new bull market"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5778560","5781560"," but if we're going to have a stabilized market for a year"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5781560","5783560"," 14 sounds kind of reasonable"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5783560","5786560"," 15 kind of sounds kind of reasonable"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5788560","5790560"," and shit for coming into VIXpiration"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","5791560","5794560"," it's got to be a good time to do it right"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6346560","6352560"," Uh, I said the trade today is to take some Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6352560","6355560"," Spreads."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6355560","6358560"," A week or a month out."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6359560","6362560"," Some time on them in the money."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6362560","6365560"," You hold them for the rest of today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6365560","6368560"," Likely close them into the end of the day."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6368560","6371560"," You could have just bought calls a week or month out."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6371560","6373560"," Um, closed them in before the day today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6373560","6376560"," Uh, some, I would expect some kind of weakness into the last hour."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6376560","6379560"," So sometimes people take the money and run."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6379560","6386560"," Um, or put enough time on them week or two or four weeks out that they'll actually print well for you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6386560","6389560"," I don't like holding through Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6389560","6395560"," Uh, as there's a bunch of day trade, not dangerous, a bunch of really shitty money."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6395560","6398560"," Uh, there's a lot of uneducated."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6398560","6400560"," I don't mean like trade like you're dumb."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6400560","6404560"," I mean, like there's just a lot of dumb money."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6404560","6410560"," Uh, that tries to throw money, like gambling money."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6410560","6412560"," That Tesla on an ER."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6413560","6421560"," Now there's a huge difference between you that make $500 or $1,000 a week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6421560","6428560"," Uh, and you wasting that, all that wasting, but trading all of your wealth."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6428560","6431560"," On a Tesla ER that rips faces off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6431560","6436560"," Uh, and some rich guy that is, you know, worth a million bucks and he trades a thousand bucks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6436560","6440560"," So if I trade a thousand dollars and you trade a thousand dollars."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6440560","6447560"," Uh, that's like 0.00001% of my money versus, you know, probably your whole paycheck of the week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6447560","6452560"," So be careful on, you know, uh, the squeeze on Tesla, like we're gonna get paid."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6452560","6462560"," Uh, Tesla, uh, for me, from my experience, for Tesla to rip some faces off overnight and hold."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6462560","6465560"," Uh, one rule."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6465560","6468560"," They must."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6468560","6474560"," Announce something tangible."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6474560","6477560"," Uh, that is not priced in."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6477560","6482560"," I don't mean like, hey, we're gonna, we're gonna make a helicopter."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6482560","6487560"," I mean, like we delivered helicopters today, today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6487560","6494560"," Or, um, we're splitting the stock, something like that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6494560","6501560"," Um, so if you don't get that, but you get a good earnings."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6501560","6506560"," Let's say you're like, we got a great earnings. Why is it selling off?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6506560","6513560"," I'm going to say to you, you should have made it. So I get my point or I'm leading into is."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6513560","6521560"," If you're going to scream and scream and scream and scream and scream and scream about Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6521560","6527560"," And all these numbers were great and how all this shit is great and fart and fucking rainbows."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6527560","6531560"," Usually your best bet with Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6531560","6535560"," Is to wait a day."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6535560","6537560"," Two or three."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6537560","6540560"," Take a long trade on Tesla after their airport."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6540560","6544560"," I feel like I don't want to wait for that just in case something happens and they split the stock or."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6544560","6550560"," I don't know. My fucking, uh, cyber truck sitting out my driveway right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6550560","6553560"," I just didn't get yours yet. Cap."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6553560","6555560"," Um, okay."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6555560","6560560"," So then I would say to you, uh, make sure you put some time on your trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6560560","6565560"," Like make it a spread or something that that's a month out or two months out or three months."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6565560","6566560"," Believe it or not, three months out."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6566560","6570560"," And then you can ride through earnings and ride that rocket chip up."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6570560","6578560"," Uh, but just like throwing a thousand bucks or 10,000 or a hundred thousand on some zero dates on Tesla is very risky."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6578560","6586560"," And mostly that has to do with, um, dealers, they're going to try to print the up and downside target."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6586560","6588560"," On your ER."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6588560","6590560"," Regardless."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6590560","6593560"," Of what."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6593560","6599560"," Uh, happened to the dealers, right? They're going to try to cover both sides."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6599560","6606560"," Of that trade. The only time a dealer will get on your side is when an event happens."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6606560","6612560"," And they have to, what's called chase. So they're going to chase, uh, with you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6612560","6617560"," Right. If they get overrun on how the market is hedged or unhedged."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6617560","6623560"," And they know they're going to get overrun. They're going to follow along with you chasing higher highs or lower lows."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6623560","6627560"," It's like really bad news on an, in an ER or something like that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6627560","6633560"," So outside of that news, the dealers are going to try to print both sides and they're going to fuck you."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6633560","6641560"," And we're talking price here, not your options."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6641560","6644560"," Not your options. They don't care about your options."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6644560","6648560"," Well, they do. They don't want your options to print."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6648560","6654560"," They're going to try to burn both sides of those options and hit the prices right at the same time, all of it at the same time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6654560","6656560"," So let's look at Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6657560","6679560"," And what's priced in on Tesla right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6679560","6692560"," Let me just say it here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6692560","6703560"," Yeah, this week's earnings. I'm looking for Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6704560","6719560"," We're focused Tesla in here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6719560","6724560"," Let me just say it here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6724560","6729560"," Well, I'm having such a pain in the ass for time. Hold on a second here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6749560","6767560"," So,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6767560","6776560"," Tesla right now has an implied move of 6.3%."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6776560","6785560"," We had, we did see Netflix trade outside of their implied move, but then of course it reversed course, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6785560","6792560"," Everyone's, or everyone's like Netflix should crash here. And of course, we didn't get that, did we?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6798560","6803560"," We didn't get like the straight."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6803560","6808560"," We hit part of the that way we blasted through the downside target."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6808560","6812560"," On Netflix when they reported."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6812560","6816560"," But what did we do by open?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6816560","6823560"," We were, we were actually inside of the, I think the implied move was 7.3% on the downside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6824560","6829560"," And we hit the upside target on Netflix at 8 o'clock at night, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6829560","6832560"," Traded 340 37, I think."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6832560","6835560"," Twice, I think we traded that for the upside target."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6835560","6839560"," So, you didn't quite hit the upside target on."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6839560","6844560"," Well, I guess we did the implied move. We kind of hit it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6844560","6851560"," And then you get the real move afterwards. So, if you look at a Tesla chart of Tesla, our Netflix, you might not have bars."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6851560","6854560"," I do in my end."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6854560","6859560"," But on these earnings, my point here in these earnings is."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6859560","6862560"," This is for the up and down side."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6862560","6871560"," You're, you're going to get something, you're going to like stay in this range is my point, at least, at least, at least as far as the options market is concerned."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6871560","6873560"," So, Netflix."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6873560","6880560"," Price wise has hit both targets and now you'll get the real move out of Netflix."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6883560","6889560"," Tesla only has an implied move by open, let's say of tomorrow, by open of tomorrow."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6889560","6893560"," Has an implied 6.3% move."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6893560","6900560"," Excuse me."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6923560","6942560"," Thanks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6942560","6956560"," And not surprisingly, it's to the top of the key."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6956560","6959560"," Of their of their weekly."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6959560","6963560"," So Tesla top of the key of their weekly is 6.5%."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6964560","6968560"," Oh, sorry, 6.3 almost to the T."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6968560","6978560"," Almost to the T. And that's a 193.50 downside expectation."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6978560","6986560"," It's roughly 172.50 something like that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6986560","6992560"," Turn 72 and change on the downside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6992560","6999560"," I would expect that if we go down on these earnings, you'll see 164 at some point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","6999560","7002560"," Easy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7002560","7009560"," So, you know, there's something to be said for, for Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7009560","7013560"," And we are bullish or rebarish on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7013560","7017560"," And what their earnings expectations are going to be, are they going to have any news."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7018560","7021560"," And then it also brings up the other conversation."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7021560","7029560"," That is we're in OpEx."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7029560","7035560"," You really need like, you really need like some unknown tangible news."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7035560","7041560"," And if you can't get that unknown tangible news on on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7042560","7049560"," Let's say I have a good or let's say I have a decent or a good ER."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7049560","7051560"," Save a decent or a good ER."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7051560","7054560"," You're likely not going to see Tesla trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7054560","7059560"," That 190 and change for long is my point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7059560","7067560"," And you're likely then going to be tied to Tesla not printing that number."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7068560","7073560"," For a few weeks could take you two, three, four, five, six weeks."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7073560","7075560"," Likely it's one to three days."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7075560","7080560"," You'll hear a lot of testables say I don't trade earnings."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7080560","7085560"," Now you might miss one earnings where it rips faces off, but in truth."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7085560","7090560"," A lot of testables will wait one, two, three days for a dip."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7090560","7093560"," To hit the downside target."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7094560","7096560"," 172."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7096560","7101560"," Probably 164 and they'll go in and they'll buy some calls."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7101560","7110560"," So there's likely a trade today on Tesla and there's likely another trade on Tesla in one to three days."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7110560","7121560"," And when it comes to the macro environment, expecting a pullback at some point heading into early May, you might be able to get a good deal on Tesla like 172 at some points."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7122560","7124560"," 164 at some point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7124560","7126560"," So I'd have it on your radar."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7126560","7132560"," Now we did trade this morning, 177."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7132560","7136560"," So, you know, hand grades and horseshoes, 177, 164."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7136560","7138560"," It's not a bad place to buy Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7138560","7143560"," If you have a long enough timeframe in your mind, so you could have done that this morning."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7143560","7146560"," And just diamond hand through earnings."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7146560","7149560"," Make sure it's dated far enough out to get a move."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7150560","7151560"," For Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7151560","7154560"," So you had a chance this morning on the opening bell on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7154560","7160560"," If you didn't buy that opening bell and you're like, I faded the captain about a bunch of puts on my shifts on fire right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7160560","7161560"," That's fine."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7161560","7162560"," Your shit can be on fire."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7162560","7171560"," If you're sitting on your hands, they'll likely be an opportunity to buy 163 177 at some point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7171560","7175560"," If you're like, Hey, cap, I'm going to get left behind here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7175560","7178560"," We're going to have the best earnings we've had in years."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7179560","7184560"," The better trade, believe it or not, on on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7184560","7187560"," Is still above 222."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7187560","7190560"," That's actually the better trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7190560","7195560"," If you think we're going into a new bull market or a new bull run."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7195560","7199560"," I really want to buy Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7199560","7201560"," Like me."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7201560","7203560"," I don't own Tesla right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7204560","7210560"," I want to buy Tesla above 220 or at like 95 or $65."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7210560","7212560"," That's where I want to buy Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7212560","7213560"," Pretty vast, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7213560","7218560"," I want to see Tesla squeeze above 420 or 220 slam down and confirm."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7218560","7221560"," And then, and then we get a start of a new bull run in the market."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7221560","7223560"," I'll buy that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7223560","7229560"," But otherwise I'm not buying it until it comes back down to $65 or $95, believe it or not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7230560","7235560"," I don't need the 185 to 220."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7235560","7240560"," It's too volatile for my blood or my tastes."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7240560","7246560"," I want to I want to see a new bull market to say, Hey, we're going from 220 up to fucking"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7246560","7249560"," rip some faces off 500 or 1000."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7249560","7253560"," I want my chance to get Tesla cheap again."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7253560","7256560"," Like I did last time about Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7256560","7258560"," I like rent free money."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7259560","7263560"," I like buying something cheap and not worrying about it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7263560","7267560"," Or I like like some confirmation that the move is higher."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7267560","7270560"," Either one of those works for me."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7270560","7271560"," Either."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7271560","7277560"," Yeah, I bought it at 90 bucks or 65 and I don't mind owning it for this price for the next"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7277560","7280560"," five or 10 years, even if we continue to go down."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7280560","7286560"," Or I like to know that we're in a bull market like yeah, we have some confirmation."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7287560","7292560"," We were able to actually escape these sellers and we confirmed that we're not going down"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7292560","7297560"," here and the rest of the market is a breaking above and heading to all time highs."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7297560","7300560"," And I can feel good about it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7300560","7303560"," So for me at least right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7303560","7307560"," I'm not interested or I'm interested in the Tesla trade for the rest of today."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7307560","7312560"," Long into the close or an hour or so before the close."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7312560","7317560"," I would like to wrap it up and get out of the market or some more time on a trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7317560","7322560"," Because I would like to see that one 64 170 get tagged at some point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7322560","7330560"," I would like to see the upside target get hit 192 220."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7330560","7333560"," Would like to see those targets get hit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7333560","7339560"," And if I have to chase along with dealers on some crazy good news, I'll do that too."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7340560","7342560"," Whatever Tesla has had big news."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7342560","7348560"," There's usually a moment in the next days open where we will we'll just keep going up."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7348560","7352560"," So if we do have some unknown news with Tesla or apple or any other stock."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7352560","7357560"," Usually the following day that we rip faces off in the following day."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7357560","7360560"," Come down for like 15 minutes. They're right off and running again."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7360560","7362560"," You can chase that shit for days."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7362560","7365560"," It'll just blast off for an entire week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7365560","7368560"," Like it'll just rip faces."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7369560","7372560"," So I can I can enter them."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7372560","7378560"," I can actually enter the following day for some face ripper and chase dealers."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7378560","7384560"," Dealers or dealers will chase that shit for an entire week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7384560","7388560"," Go on my take on Tesla that goes up here or not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7388560","7391560"," I'll give it to you right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7392560","7394560"," Eleven twenty eight."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7394560","7400560"," You want my my thoughts on Tesla and Elon Musk."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7400560","7406560"," Does it go up here?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7406560","7410560"," Give me a second."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7410560","7413560"," And I'll look."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7421560","7424560"," You"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7451560","7477560"," probably not going to want to hear what I have to say."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7478560","7483560"," You're probably not going to want to hear what I have to say."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7489560","7495560"," You want my truth? Like truth? True answer? You guys know I'm not a Tesla bear."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7495560","7499560"," I'm an Elon Musk bear, but I'm not a Tesla bear."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7500560","7506560"," What it looks like."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7506560","7526560"," It looks to me like any good news out of Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7526560","7550560"," It looks to me like any good news out of Tesla is quickly sold off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7551560","7576560"," I don't think this is the move up on Tesla that you're expecting or that I want to see happen."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7577560","7583560"," Because it's such a high beta stock, I think it actually takes a hit with the market with"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7583560","7588560"," the market rolling over in May. I think that actually takes quite a bit of hit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7588560","7592560"," I think you'll see. I think it's possible to see like one ninety two one ninety three and"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7592560","7603560"," then you'll go back down and revisit some previous lows one sixties one seventies into mid to late May."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7603560","7609560"," I think that answers the question of I'm assuming that there's some bulls out there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7609560","7614560"," They're like, well, we'll have a great earnings and it'll be a new dawn for Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7614560","7620560"," I think that's false right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7620560","7625560"," Unless there's something unknown, it would have to be something unknown in their earnings."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7625560","7630560"," Something that we don't know."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7630560","7635560"," And it would have to be tangible."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7635560","7638560"," So that's what I see on Tesla."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7638560","7642560"," See if you guys have any questions on Tesla. Oh, one second here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7642560","7649560"," Getting in some weirdness here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7649560","7655560"," Spy coming back down to retest."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7656560","7660560"," The bullish cross right now on spy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7660560","7666560"," On the five minute chart, we're trying to retest the one in five minute here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7666560","7672560"," We are in the hourly trigger. We're on a bullish cluster."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7672560","7680560"," We want to see the retest be successful and not catch a roll."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7680560","7686560"," I'm getting my screen is freezing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7686560","7689560"," Some screen freeze here. Hold on a second here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7689560","7694560"," Anyways, we want to see a successful retest in this move higher on the pivot."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7694560","7698560"," We don't want to see a breakdown below here and have this be a bull trap."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7698560","7701560"," I got somewhere just going on my end."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7711560","7716560"," Scroll back over here and reset all of this."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7716560","7721560"," The only real thing I'm paying attention to right here is this right here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7721560","7724560"," This is a five minute chart on the spy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7724560","7727560"," All I want to see is the successful retest here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7727560","7730560"," If we can't get a successful retest here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7730560","7736560"," If there's a reversal here, which I'm not seeing so far."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7736560","7740560"," This is flattening out here. I don't like seeing this flatten."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7740560","7743560"," I don't like seeing the white line flatten right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7743560","7750560"," What I want to see here is a successful retest for higher highs."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7750560","7757560"," But I don't like seeing the red line flatten here and I don't like seeing the white line flatten right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7757560","7761560"," I want to see this white line continue higher here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7761560","7763560"," And we're not seeing that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7763560","7768560"," So we've seen a little bit of sideways action in the spy in the five minute chart here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7768560","7772560"," And what you'll see is a reversal here to the downside."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7772560","7774560"," So we'll see what happens."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7774560","7779560"," What the interaction is like down here and see what happens here on the spy."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7786560","7789560"," Let me know what your predictions are."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7789560","7794560"," If we get a reversal here or a successful retest to the upside, let me know in the chat."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7794560","7800560"," If you think this is just the retest for the bullish."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7800560","7804560"," Cross right here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7804560","7809560"," Right there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7809560","7812560"," Or if this is actually a bull trap."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7813560","7816560"," Make your case known."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7831560","7836560"," Retest reversal selling off on book map."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7836560","7838560"," We go sideways from here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7838560","7841560"," I like Dawson boys with Dawson boys saying I agree with him."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7841560","7844560"," It's consolidation still."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7844560","7846560"," Manifesting a dump."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7846560","7849560"," I'm going to say retest because there's still."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7849560","7851560"," I'm having problems with my shit right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7851560","7853560"," The background here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7853560","7861560"," I need to reset my router and thing every day."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7862560","7865560"," Let's say retest because it is still all that liquidity above."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7865560","7869560"," It's a good point to bullish retest retest good place."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7869560","7872560"," Volume droppings is something likely to pop them away."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7872560","7874560"," The other no feelings."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7874560","7877560"," See what YouTube saying here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7877560","7883560"," Bull trap."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7883560","7885560"," That's right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7885560","7887560"," So Jimmy Barry's making a great point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7887560","7890560"," So Jimmy Barry saying if we're sell off, it's going to be the overnight."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7891560","7892560"," Right."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7892560","7894560"," Self futures."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7894560","7896560"," Jimmy is correct."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7896560","7900560"," Jimmy is a hundred percent correct."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7900560","7903560"," Jimmy knows."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7912560","7921560"," Yeah, I'm on the bullish side here all day long."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7921560","7924560"," And just the confirmation that we're going higher."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7924560","7929560"," This is a bullish cross here."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7936560","7938560"," Yeah, they're selling futures right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7938560","7940560"," Jimmy, you can see it, right?"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7941560","7942560"," Can't get it done."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7942560","7947560"," And if you can't get it done in future, if you can't get it in cash market, as we'll do in futures."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","7958560","7961560"," Yeah, I'm long into Friday."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8011560","8014560"," I was like asking these questions of people."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8016560","8017560"," That key moments."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8018560","8022560"," Oh, shit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8022560","8030560"," Trading for 1349 right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8034560","8035560"," Yes, I am."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8035560","8037560"," I am going to be trading crypto."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8037560","8038560"," Absolutely."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8038560","8041560"," I am taking a week off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8041560","8044560"," I have two people."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8044560","8046560"," Maybe three."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8047560","8050560"," They're going to be joining us as streamers."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8050560","8053560"," I have one confirmed."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8065560","8070560"," Well, that has shown interest, so."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8071560","8075560"," The idea here is we can get a group of streamers together."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8075560","8082560"," And I don't have to stream 40, 50 hours every week."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8082560","8086560"," And I can, I can start to delve into some other stuff with you guys."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8086560","8088560"," I can be like, I got somebody making videos."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8088560","8090560"," I got somebody doing a live stream."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8090560","8092560"," Somebody gets a day off."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8092560","8096560"," And then we're going to trade some crypto."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8096560","8098560"," And I'm also going to trade."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8098560","8101560"," I'm also going to, I'm going to TwitchCon."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8109560","8113560"," And I will be there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8113560","8118560"," Probably going to break my face open or break my back in a foam pit or something."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8118560","8120560"," But I will fucking be there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8120560","8125560"," So I will be at TwitchCon."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8129560","8131560"," We'll talk about that later down the road."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8136560","8142560"," But I will be at TwitchCon and we're going to lead up into that trading crypto so that we can trade crypto over that weekend."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8179560","8184560"," I'm probably going to cause trouble."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8184560","8188560"," I'm assuming at this point I'm going to cause some trouble out of TwitchCon."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8188560","8192560"," I'm like, I'm probably going to get the platform there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8192560","8197560"," Because I assure you."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8299560","8302560"," You have to have like two or three people in the group."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8329560","8331560"," Some are working normal job."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8331560","8333560"," Some have wives, some don't."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8333560","8335560"," Some have high income."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8362560","8366560"," So you have to like make sure there's always a bear for that guy or girl."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8366560","8369560"," Like, like they always need for something free."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8369560","8374560"," They want to share as long as it's yours, but they're ambassadors to like get you through things."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8448560","8450560"," Cause you want to be arguing with somebody."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8450560","8455560"," I want to be like, Hey, we're going to do something fucking like, we're going to, we're going to go jump out of an airplane."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8494560","8496560"," I've never actually used it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8497560","8501560"," Whereas a hippie ambassador is like, I'm kicking a can down the street."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8501560","8506560"," But I will fucking do that with you."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8526560","8527560"," People know that you're legit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8527560","8530560"," They're like, yeah, I guess like that guy looks like a cop over there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8530560","8531560"," But he's got a hippie ambassador friend."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8531560","8533560"," He's probably cool."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8533560","8534560"," Dang, you're in."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8537560","8540560"," And then you need at least one."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8703560","8704560"," Especially if you want to have a good time."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8705560","8709560"," There's no time in those situations where you want anyone around you that's going to panic."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8710560","8711560"," You want any panic going on?"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8790560","8792560"," Don't bring them all together in a group."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8800560","8805560"," I don't think."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8805560","8812560"," I don't think I was going to just pay my own way there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8812560","8814560"," I didn't know that they give that shit for free."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8814560","8815560"," I don't know."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8815560","8817560"," I have no idea anything about it right now."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8817560","8822560"," Other than get a flight, book the hotel room, and I'll be there."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8865560","8866560"," So you're saying I have a free room."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8866560","8867560"," I didn't know I had a free room."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8872560","8873560"," I don't know anything about the free room."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8873560","8874560"," I don't know nothing about that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8875560","8876560"," But I'll be there."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8892560","8893560"," We'll make a fun out of it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8893560","8894560"," Should be fun, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8894560","8895560"," You're going to do stuff like that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8895560","8896560"," Make fun."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8896560","8897560"," Not make fun of it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8897560","8898560"," Like make it a fun experience."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8899560","8902560"," They're usually like things you don't do all the time, right?"

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8920560","8922560"," I do look back when I was younger."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8923560","8925560"," And I'm like, man, I was too scared to do that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8926560","8928560"," Or I was like, I never should, like when I was younger,"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8928560","8929560"," like I made a big mistake."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8930560","8932560"," Now that I'm getting older, I'm like, oh, dude, like."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8933560","8934560"," Do everything."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8935560","8936560"," Not all of it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8936560","8938560"," I mean, there's some shit you shouldn't don't be like doing fentanyl."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8939560","8940560"," Fentanyl, whatever that shit is."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8953560","8957560"," Like I'm not going to jump out of an airplane every day for the rest of my life."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8959560","8961560"," Because I figure eventually that's going to get me."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8962560","8963560"," Like a wing suit every day."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8963560","8966560"," If I was wing suited every day, I'm like, yeah, probably not going to make it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8969560","8970560"," At some point."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8976560","8977560"," I don't know if I will."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8977560","8978560"," I may go to Australia."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8978560","8979560"," I'm not sure."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8979560","8980560"," It's expensive to go there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8980560","8981560"," Sailing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8981560","8987560"," I do definitely plan on going into New Zealand and pop out in New Guinea on my travels out there."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8991560","8993560"," I don't know if it's on the itinerary or not."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8994560","8996560"," I might be bypassing like Australia, Japan."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","8997560","8998560"," Places like that."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9000560","9001560"," I'm not sure yet."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9001560","9002560"," Can't guarantee I'm going Australia."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9004560","9008560"," Maybe I could go for a weekend or something or a quick visa, but."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9011560","9017560"," All the, all the milk run people are saying don't or not to skip it, but there's other places to go."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9019560","9021560"," It's not that Australia is not worth visiting either."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9022560","9023560"," I like Australians."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9027560","9028560"," Yeah, free soloing."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9028560","9029560"," There's a good one right there."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9029560","9033560"," If I was like free soloing every day, I probably have a death wish."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9034560","9041560"," Yeah, nothing safe anymore, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9041560","9043560"," You can't take drugs anymore."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9043560","9044560"," I don't know."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9044560","9045560"," Maybe some of you do."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9045560","9048560"," Can't take like anything pills, powders."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9048560","9050560"," You'd have to get it all tested."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9050560","9056560"," And even then only your sample is only your sample is."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9056560","9059560"," It's all that's all you tested, right?"
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9059560","9062560"," You just need someone was telling me this."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9062560","9063560"," They were saying."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9145560","9146560"," And I'm like, I ain't telling them."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9146560","9147560"," I ain't answering that question."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9147560","9148560"," Next question."

"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9185560","9186560"," Yeah, you can't like."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9188560","9190560"," I guess some people do it intentionally."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9190560","9191560"," Some people try to buy it."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9191560","9192560"," I guess cheap."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9192560","9193560"," Not shit."
"Oh2Mp9wfq10","9193560","9196560"," But like my one buddy was telling me is like, oh, he's like, dude, he's like."
