"144140","144760"," All right."
"144760","146140"," So we're green this morning, right?"

"170420","173620"," So we're going to head on over here shortly, make sure everybody's here."

"175340","176080"," The anticipation music. "
"177620","178720"," Good morning, Belgian."
"179300","180760"," You got to actually like that song or no?"
"181200","181840"," Bill Bowles."

"183300","184220"," Hell yeah, brother."
"185080","186160"," We have to talk about that."
"186280","187340"," That's why we're going to have a chat this morning. "
"188080","189260"," Good morning, Scott."
"189660","190120"," Good morning, Stan."

"195900","196280"," I'm not sure. "
"197560","198360"," Morning, Stephen, Emerson."
"200600","201380"," Jordan, for sale."
"207360","208940"," Good morning, Daddy Sue. "
"209340","216600"," You know, yesterday we talked about trading a, we're going to move over here in just a minute."
"217780","224720"," We're going to switch over and see if we can get this right this morning or not of that interlude."
"226000","226580"," All right. "
"226680","227800"," Everybody seems to be here this morning."
"227960","228360"," Good morning, Richard."
"228600","229160"," Good morning, Binky. "
"229160","230700"," Good morning, Papa Smurf."
"231280","233900"," You know, yesterday into the, into the clothes we talked about."
"235640","237020"," Talked about what we talked about. "
"237260","237700"," Good morning."
"240400","242420"," Liking spy calls over 459."
"242640","243260"," Good morning, GP. "
"245100","248100"," Almost getting there, trying to get that production value up."
"248260","250760"," You guys have been sticking around, so I figured out my end."
"250880","251620"," I have a ton of work to do. "
"253780","255079"," That's straddle, baby."
"256500","258140"," That's straddle, right, baby?"
"258140","259459"," That'd be straddle, Omar."
"262460","264300"," Oh, he didn't get the straddle. "
"264920","266080"," Oh, no."
"266900","268140"," Good morning, Bobcat."
"268820","269880"," Good morning, Troy. "
"270220","270820"," How are y'all doing?"
"273560","274280"," Yeah, Emerson."
"274960","277440"," So look at what Emerson's saying."
"280260","285000"," And we'll take a look at the, we'll take a look at the NQ daily 200 here in just a"
"285000","285280"," moment. "
"286320","287340"," Emerson's got a good point."
"287340","291440"," I want Emerson here this morning because we have a lot to talk about."
"292520","294940"," And I'm going to bring this up real quick here. "
"295380","299980"," I want to see your main display."
"300820","301980"," Okay, we're going to switch it over here."
"303120","307540"," And we're going to take a look at, we're going to get started here. "
"307680","308260"," Good morning, everybody."
"310240","311380"," Yeah, there's no reason to lie."
"311500","313180"," If you didn't get it on the trade, don't worry about it. "
"313480","314160"," It's no big deal."
"314160","320460"," But what's crazy about the trade is you couldn't take the long or the short side and where we sold"
"320460","325240"," down to in the overnight, you would have thought we were opening up at minus 1%, right?"
"326320","331120"," And even at some point this early this morning, we could have been dead flat."
"334160","339240"," Now, there are some issues that we have to talk about this morning. "
"339240","348400"," And the reason we're doing this special report this morning is because we have talk about some"
"348400","349580"," things that took place yesterday."
"351880","355580"," Now, we're running today's Wednesday and then we have Thursday."
"357040","361540"," Typically, Thursday of OPEC is a big giant green day. "
"364000","366340"," And sometimes it doesn't happen until Thursday."
"366340","369540"," Sometimes it happens on Wednesday, but it doesn't know how it will happen on Thursday."
"370600","372900"," It will get super monster big balls green. "
"374440","378560"," And in some months, we even go ripping into, let's say, the 1st of February."
"379520","382700"," I think that's what you're supposed to be thinking about today."
"384440","386720"," Is that we're supposed to be big green balls?"
"387020","389540"," We're supposed to go to the moon, all that kind of stuff. "
"389900","395700"," And we remember we talked about something that said you briefly yesterday morning and then briefly"
"395700","396680"," later in the afternoon."
"398100","402360"," Was that I was surprised that the call wall had gone higher to 4800."
"404500","406060"," And I was shocked at that. "
"406200","410780"," Right now I've got the call wall above here at 4788, but it's actually higher."
"411840","413260"," It's 4800, it's way up here."
"414740","419540"," And we talked about this briefly yesterday that a lot of this stuff moved up. "
"419540","430560"," But then what also took place yesterday was we didn't have hedging in a put wall below for"
"430560","431160"," 4600."
"433080","438420"," And lo and behold, we got hedging yesterday that was way down here at 438."
"440320","443360"," It's a major spy hedging committee yesterday. "
"444100","447740"," Snuck right in in the middle of the day, very low on the market."
"447740","449720"," We discussed that as well yesterday."
"453460","456880"," And Joe and I were talking and I said, you know, we're going there. "
"456960","461360"," We're going down there at this point when you start to see an expansion on the put side."
"462760","466680"," And you've got calls that are expiring coming into this Friday, right?"
"467180","468760"," We've got today and we have Friday."
"469600","472680"," But Emerson brought up a point yesterday that was noteworthy. "
"473280","476680"," And we're going to go to the one year chart here on the S&P 500."
"478700","484540"," We're going to scroll this all the way back into March here of 2020."
"487480","488860"," And see that back down here. "
"488960","490960"," You've got a little bit of this capitulation move down here."
"491760","493820"," This one little bit of capitulation."
"498250","501670"," And this event right here happens quite frequently. "
"502510","503190"," We've seen this."
"503350","509250"," We've gone in previous videos, we've gone back in time when we've looked at moments where you have"
"509250","510730"," this last little capitulation move."
"510890","515010"," These are the tail risk moves that take place in the market. "
"515730","518030"," You can see this last little bit tail down here as well."
"519450","524750"," And these are the capitulation move, that high volume move that we're talking about, that big"
"524750","527710"," hammer candle that we're talking about that takes place."
"529390","537230"," Now, we've respected this bottom trend line, right?"
"537230","540270"," This is the oh shit moment of the market. "
"542230","544210"," And we have a problem."
"544330","545510"," We didn't respect it."
"547290","551530"," We actually wound up, we can move this up a little bit and get a bit more precise. "
"552710","556670"," We didn't respect this moment yesterday."
"558450","560530"," And Emerson brought it up towards the end of the day yesterday."
"560750","566430"," He said, well, you know, we've broken through some supports that have been respected since March of"
"566430","566690"," 2020. "
"566690","569630"," And that was the key moment that he said yesterday."
"570690","579770"," It doesn't, it doesn't make itself as a parent as it would seem on the spy chart."
"581230","584850"," This is still a higher low than the two previous. "
"585350","590810"," So there is some technical argument to say, Hey, we're going to go to 480 now."
"592730","595850"," But we have a liquidation in the market in the background."
"596430","597690"," We have a liquidation going on. "
"598150","602030"," We have bulls that are longtime holders of tech stock."
"602790","605430"," We have tech earnings coming up after the financials are done here."
"605630","611130"," We still have terrible financials coming up for the rest of this week. "
"611350","612810"," And then we roll into the tech market."
"613550","617090"," You don't want to, you don't want to mess with these people's money, these rich people's money,"
"617230","617310"," right?"
"617310","622210"," Banks money, wealthy individuals money, that kind of stuff."
"622850","625790"," But we had a technical breakdown in the S&P 500. "
"626470","629330"," We had a technical breakdown in the NQ."
"630070","633810"," We had a technical breakdown as well in the rut yesterday."
"635710","642450"," And those things are not to be trifled with when those technical breakdowns take place. "
"643130","644670"," And you can see that we did this yesterday."
"644670","645750"," This move was yesterday."
"647470","648470"," This is a weekly here. "
"648570","652310"," We're going to go a little bit closer, a little bit closer here."
"655550","657350"," And this breakdown that took place."
"658190","659710"," This was in the overnight last night. "
"660270","662430"," This is a technical breakdown inside the market."
"663630","665450"," You never want to see this take place."
"665610","667090"," And this took place late last night. "
"668550","673010"," An inclination coming into this morning is that we're going to trade up."
"673010","673570"," We're going to be green."
"675430","676450"," Now would be the expectation. "
"677150","682590"," The other thing was that she was noting that the, that the put wall was at 460."
"684370","685930"," And it's not any longer."
"685930","689530"," When those hedges were taken out yesterday, way down at 438. "
"691490","692570"," That put wall."
"692790","695050"," I haven't even read the spot camera report yet this morning."
"696050","697950"," Nor did I read the PM yesterday. "
"698690","700010"," So I don't know what they're saying today."
"700990","706690"," But I know for sure what happened yesterday was we had an expansion of the put side of the market."
"708790","711930"," And we broke through this 460 yesterday. "
"712330","713470"," We were not supposed to do that."
"714250","715730"," And so even though we're green this morning."
"717090","719110"," There's a couple words of caution. "
"721230","725110"," There's the word of caution that we could reject this morning."
"725370","727330"," We could reject slightly above this dotted line."
"728890","731090"," We could look super bull green this morning. "
"731090","732390"," We could get highly bullish."
"733030","734710"," Reject off this zone up here."
"735170","738630"," Even reject as high as 4661. "
"739290","740910"," And still sell the market down."
"742010","746390"," And we might trade above these levels and move on up and hit 4800 once again."
"747470","749070"," But I warn you as a bull. "
"750170","752250"," Then if we take this off the bell this morning."
"753290","754630"," That this is a high danger zone."
"755510","757350"," This is a high danger zone in here. "
"757610","765290"," All of this down here is a no go zone because in the background of the market right now."
"765650","767350"," Nothing supports this move higher."
"768170","770730"," Nothing in our market this morning supports this move higher. "
"771810","777930"," Anything other than a cascading waterfall of calls into the market that are way up high and dated"
"777930","779930"," longer than the next two days or three days."
"779930","783110"," It's going to change my mind on us moving this higher."
"783610","784650"," There'll be no melt up. "
"785150","786470"," This is all fugazi."
"786590","786990"," It's all fake."
"787690","791750"," So I need you to know that this morning as a trader, as an investor, as a bull and even"
"791750","792350"," as a bear. "
"793910","796530"," Now, let's say we trade up here, right?"
"797010","800410"," We have to look for is there actually money coming into the market."
"800870","801930"," Same thing over here."
"802430","805130"," And even if we trade higher here, I promise you. "
"805690","807810"," As a trader, as an investor."
"809290","813710"," Just like these moves down over here, that this is a fake move."
"815210","819190"," And after all these years of trading, I'm going to tell you right now, I love buying the dip. "
"819930","822650"," And I don't think that this is a real dip by."
"823690","826010"," And I don't think it matters where we trade to it."
"826090","827610"," Don't think it matters if we trade here. "
"827850","829990"," I don't think it matters if we trade up here or even a 4800."
"830810","831710"," It's all fugazi."
"832250","834350"," We're going to end up trading this back down. "
"834350","840410"," And the price targets below, because we broke this technical level, are much lower."
"842010","850050"," We're talking about trading back to the lows, believe it or not, of March 2021."
"851070","854170"," At minimum, we're going to trade back to this area. "
"854330","854830"," This is way back."
"855050","857810"," And I want to know, I want to say, so we can get this back on one year."
"862740","863740"," And stick with me. "
"863740","865760"," If you're a bully, I want you to understand this."
"866220","870080"," We're going to trade back here at least to July of 2021."
"870800","874340"," More than likely at some point, we'll end up trading back closer to. "
"876340","879960"," March of 2021, somewhere down here at the 4000 level."
"880460","884980"," And that what that will end up doing is it will end up bringing our stealth correction."
"886440","890240"," We'll match up to the index correction that's going to take place. "
"891500","900240"," You're going to see all these stocks that are knocked down to their March 2020 levels, March 2021"
"900240","900760"," levels."
"901420","905880"," They're going to then match up to the indexes somewhere between now and March."
"908180","916380"," Now, the puts that were purchased to 438 for the first leg of this move were purchased for February"
"916380","918480"," 18th strike date. "
"918480","918820"," Okay."
"920740","928620"," So the first leg should take place sometime between now and February 18th."
"928820","933900"," And it coincides with tech week happening and all this other junk for us to still trade down to"
"933900","939160"," this 40, 43, 50, 48, 44, 14. "
"939280","942020"," I'm expecting like 44, 06 somewhere in there."
"942480","944140"," We're going to trade down to this at some point."
"944480","946780"," And I want you to be aware of that as we go forward. "
"946780","948900"," So we can put our bull hats on today."
"949760","951600"," We can trade this up this morning off the bell."
"953380","958200"," It's no problem trading this, but I wanted you to be aware that now every three months or so you"
"958200","960240"," have that one day where everything lines up. "
"960340","960980"," Everything looks great."
"962720","964820"," And you know better and it sells off."
"964960","969200"," Remember like a week or two ago, we were live streaming and I said, get out of the stock market. "
"969900","971940"," Remember that after that morning, we traded up higher overnight."
"972220","973100"," We were blasting higher."
"973620","977140"," It was like nine, 30, I was like 10, 30 in the morning and I said, I'm calling the lungs"
"977140","978340"," and I'm going short. "
"979140","981340"," Talked about it for like 15, 20 minutes, half an hour."
"981860","984800"," I said, if you're a bull, put on some protection right now at this moment."
"985460","986700"," And we sold right off, right?"
"987620","989860"," I think it was right here actually when it took place. "
"990440","991820"," I think it was this move right here."
"992480","993420"," We didn't get caught in this."
"993780","999560"," And I'm going to warn you that this move is going to take place once again, either today, tomorrow. "
"1000000","1004600"," I don't care if it's today or tomorrow, but it's happening at some point in here."
"1005260","1006780"," This is a false run right here."
"1007480","1007820"," Okay. "
"1008320","1010500"," So what does that leave you?"
"1010860","1013420"," If you're a bear, you're looking for entry, right?"
"1013540","1014700"," You're going to be looking for some sort of rejection."
"1015560","1018160"," You're going to be looking for no big calls coming in."
"1018340","1019580"," Same thing up here in this zone. "
"1020220","1026619"," If we break above this zone right here, 46, 63, you can probably take this to 4800."
"1026619","1030040"," But anything in here is super danger zone."
"1030599","1034099"," This red line that you see down here, this was Bulltown. "
"1035220","1037760"," This down here, excuse me, this is Beartown down here."
"1038300","1040880"," We broke through this in the overnight, 45, 77."
"1041240","1042460"," We entered Beartown. "
"1043260","1045180"," So you can't trust any of this."
"1045380","1046960"," This is all volatility zone down here."
"1047560","1048580"," None of this is good news. "
"1048940","1052600"," And this specifically opened the door to look lower."
"1053280","1054640"," Do you guys all understand that?"
"1055420","1057800"," Good morning, Angie."
"1058040","1060400"," Does everybody out there understand what I'm trying to tell you guys?"
"1060980","1064960"," No matter how bullish this looks this morning, that this is danger zone. "
"1066260","1067460"," Yeah, strap in."
"1067800","1069600"," This is a traders market."
"1070100","1072020"," This is not investors market. "
"1074360","1079740"," Yesterday, another thing that hit me in the head was Chase said, I don't like this having to day"
"1079740","1080000"," trade."
"1080460","1081660"," I want to take swing trades."
"1082380","1085680"," Well, I got to say, there's no such thing as swing trades right now. "
"1086320","1091760"," And there probably won't be anything for swing trades until middle of March, April."
"1092700","1098120"," Sometimes it takes until June, July, but for this year specifically, it just isn't that we don't"
"1098120","1098700"," have those trades."
"1100900","1102700"," No, yeah, you guys all get this. "
"1102980","1106240"," I want you guys to understand that there is no such thing as swing trading right now in this"
"1106240","1106620"," market."
"1107320","1111960"," You can only take a trade until it prints and then you have to get out."
"1113200","1115360"," Joe and I were talking yesterday about oil and gas. "
"1116120","1118360"," Yes, you can take gas long and wait on that."
"1118960","1121120"," Joe is in some BTU calls."
"1121700","1123540"," You can put those on him and sit back on those. "
"1124460","1126420"," But you can't for the general market right now."
"1127320","1129760"," Now, why don't you be aware of that as a trade in this opening this morning?"
"1130300","1130660"," And I'm pumped."
"1130660","1138160"," I got I had yesterday about 46 cents puts and about 15 or 13 cents 14 cent. "
"1138360","1143940"," I think I've looked at 14 cent calls dirt cheap calls for 65s."
"1144460","1145100"," They're going to print."
"1145680","1146700"," They're going to make me some money. "
"1148540","1156620"," But it doesn't matter because while you guys realize that unless you see a cascade of calls, I mean"
"1156620","1158480"," like $30 million on Apple."
"1159460","1160160"," I don't know."
"1160520","1161900"," $30 million on Tesla. "
"1163220","1165480"," $10 million on Microsoft."
"1166700","1168460"," Netflix calls coming out of the kazoo."
"1168580","1171420"," Like that just you need to see a cascading waterfall of calls. "
"1172120","1176080"," And they have to be but dated better than this Wednesday or this Friday."
"1176800","1179020"," And that'd be really high like not just 4800."
"1179380","1181320"," Yeah, I guess 4800 reward would work. "
"1181580","1183500"," But unless you see that, right?"
"1183500","1185240"," This whole move is is fake."
"1186180","1189700"," So if you're a bear, you're looking for turn here rejection."
"1190720","1192520"," Rejection should be at 46 16. "
"1193360","1196500"," Your next rejection point is going to be 46 43."
"1197000","1200400"," You want to mark these down on a scratch piece of paper, then put them on your chart."
"1201780","1205040"," You're looking for a rejection again at 46 62 25. "
"1206700","1208520"," If we swing up high here."
"1210200","1212140"," I'm going to show you an NQ as well."
"1212740","1215760"," If we swing up high, we bounce here, right?"
"1217500","1219280"," So you can you can take this if you want. "
"1219460","1220460"," It's a risky move."
"1220700","1222540"," I might take this today and stay in this trade."
"1223260","1225740"," But I can tell you right now that's easy for the fails. "
"1226220","1230320"," The next thing that you're looking for is you're going to be looking for a rejection point here."
"1230980","1231860"," And we trade down from."
"1233280","1236960"," If that doesn't happen, this is when it gets safe as the bounce here. "
"1236960","1240940"," This is the actual only safe move move move here is something like that."
"1241500","1242580"," This is the safety move."
"1243540","1247780"," Probably don't get to 4800 probably gets like 47 47 50 or so. "
"1248260","1251060"," But this is one move here and this is the second move up here."
"1252120","1253920"," I want to show you NQ as well."
"1254560","1257020"," Because we we violated across the board yesterday. "
"1257820","1260920"," And the biggest imposter right now is probably."
"1262160","1265460"," NQ possibly IWM is even worse."
"1267020","1268860"," I want you to see this right here as well. "
"1269040","1270020"," See this red line right here?"
"1270660","1272600"," This was the don't go pass line."
"1273420","1279060"," We went through it once before back on January 10th and we did it again yesterday."
"1280840","1281860"," Or in the overnight. "
"1282980","1283940"," We did it again."
"1286380","1287820"," Price targets on NQ."
"1288980","1290520"," You can see it right here. "
"1290720","1290760"," Right."
"1291260","1293580"," Fourteen six to six thirty."
"1294740","1295660"," And ultimately. "
"1296840","1297780"," You're going to wind up seeing."
"1300740","1301580"," Right here."
"1301720","1302240"," Let me get rid of this. "
"1306740","1310420"," You're going to ultimately end up seeing a price target down below even that."
"1311780","1312840"," Somewhere down here."
"1313820","1316000"," Fourteen six hundred all the way down to thirteen. "
"1317180","1321540"," Five seventy more than likely enough trading down here once we're in bear town down here."
"1322040","1324180"," You're going to see some kind of a capitulation move down here."
"1324220","1326420"," This would put us into that into that. "
"1326520","1327880"," I'm going to show you where this puts us but."
"1331950","1335270"," This puts us back to just May of twenty twenty one."
"1336430","1336870"," Okay. "
"1337130","1338570"," Just the May area on tech."
"1338770","1340150"," Not a big move down."
"1340510","1342830"," You'll see that this is a February 18th. "
"1342890","1344910"," You'll see this between now and."
"1345750","1349350"," February March and you'll end up seeing this move down below here more than likely."
"1350550","1354010"," Heading into excuse me you'll see this before between now and February. "
"1354610","1357430"," More than likely the beginning of February and then you'll end up seeing this by."
"1357730","1358430"," Hopefully by March."
"1359070","1359910"," You'll see a move down here. "
"1362980","1365600"," And then I want to show you the rut real quick."
"1366600","1368680"," Violation on the rut that we were talking about yesterday."
"1368840","1371260"," Emerson said a good point yesterday. "
"1371540","1372000"," He said hey."
"1372460","1374240"," He said we violated yesterday."
"1375660","1376720"," On our T Y."
"1377500","1378240"," And we did. "
"1378520","1379020"," We violated."
"1379980","1382060"," And even this morning you can see we use news."
"1382220","1384700"," You saw that that I didn't be hedging that came in yesterday. "
"1385400","1387180"," I saw the move down in the overnight over here."
"1388320","1389920"," See us fighting back above here."
"1390080","1392060"," This would be also be the mark for you watching for. "
"1392520","1394920"," I want us to look for a rejection on twenty one twenty eight."
"1395540","1396620"," Twenty one fifty eight."
"1397260","1398320"," These are all important. "
"1398980","1401040"," And where do we trade down on the rut?"
"1401040","1402440"," I measured this out last night."
"1403280","1404500"," I want to show you where that is."
"1405600","1408240"," One eight sixty to one eight nine nine. "
"1408720","1411200"," If you're a chase and you want to take out some put spreads."
"1412200","1414300"," Datum for March right down here."
"1415680","1416980"," We're going to be trading down here. "
"1417060","1417700"," I guarantee you."
"1418900","1420400"," And we've got some other issues too."
"1420520","1420780"," We've got. "
"1422560","1427880"," We've got rates of course, which yesterday we talked about it being like a South American football"
"1427880","1429420"," team, South American soccer team."
"1430260","1432000"," It's a little it's a little more."
"1433660","1434860"," Exaggerated pain, right?"
"1435880","1437260"," Everyone's claiming that it's rates. "
"1437300","1438500"," It's probably not rates."
"1439640","1440200"," Completely."
"1440520","1441980"," We've got Ukraine on the board. "
"1443000","1447200"," Last night I read a military newspaper that said that they were."
"1447560","1451560"," They've got ships now troop transport ships heading over to Ukraine."
"1452160","1457100"," I was in another sub last night and people were talking about how you'll typically see that news"
"1457100","1458260"," break over the weekend. "
"1459840","1460920"," Not during the week."
"1461940","1465700"," There's a high chance that there will be some sort of a war with Ukraine at this point."
"1466420","1467380"," So you've got that issue. "
"1467740","1472440"," You've got just the general idea of this being the last great ER season."
"1473300","1474600"," To get everything lined up here."
"1475440","1477080"," For us to trade down into this zone. "
"1477240","1479860"," This this should take place sooner than later."
"1480060","1480780"," This could take place."
"1480940","1481840"," We now in February. "
"1482380","1485080"," Sometimes we now in mid February."
"1485660","1489900"," And the move could be exasperated into March."
"1489900","1491380"," This might recover before. "
"1492320","1494560"," Before S by and tech does."
"1494840","1496580"," But this could actually go deeper."
"1498940","1500780"," So that's what I want to talk to you about this morning. "
"1501380","1503680"," That's the importance of starting early this morning."
"1505780","1506780"," Let's look at you guys."
"1507060","1509560"," So the reps don't get greedy because there is always a bounce. "
"1510040","1510220"," Yep."
"1510360","1510960"," There's always a bounce."
"1511180","1514420"," But I warn you that this time the bounce is different. "
"1514420","1517680"," While you guys all to know out there that the bounce of this time."
"1519360","1521500"," Is different typically right now."
"1521960","1523260"," This is a great bounce. "
"1523880","1526640"," We could wind up ripping like 3% a day or two."
"1527660","1529340"," But this bounce right here."
"1529740","1532180"," I would not trust for at all. "
"1532420","1533540"," I would have no trust."
"1535540","1539900"," No trust that we actually make either of these moves and it would not shock me to see us trade"
"1539900","1540140"," up."
"1540540","1543320"," Right into the bell and reverse course. "
"1544240","1545680"," So I'd be very scared."
"1545880","1548540"," Not scared, but I would be really cautious of this move."
"1549180","1550440"," And I'll trade this up with you. "
"1550600","1552380"," I don't mind if we keep trading this up."
"1552620","1556720"," I've got some zero dates that will probably print nice and fat today."
"1558120","1560380"," And I wouldn't even mind those burning if we trade up. "
"1560440","1563080"," If any of you guys follow me on that on that straddle yesterday."
"1563820","1568140"," I mean, even if I lose the money on this straddle and we turn around."
"1568440","1570920"," It's still worth holding for the risk involved. "
"1570920","1575080"," But I wouldn't be shocked to see us trade out of this this morning."
"1575780","1576800"," Morning quantum leap."
"1583660","1589260"," Yeah, there's the Ukraine situation is worse than it seems out there. "
"1590600","1594080"," I was in some, I was in some, I read some military stuff yesterday."
"1594760","1596260"," Some military industry stuff."
"1596500","1599240"," And then I was in a military sob yesterday. "
"1599880","1601380"," And it's not looking pretty."
"1602540","1604820"," And they typically do this over the course of a weekend."
"1605500","1609900"," One guy was saying that you would expect it to happen over an American weekend. "
"1611180","1612740"," So that it softens the news."
"1613480","1618980"," You wouldn't get 24 hour puke news cycle on a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"1619440","1623320"," It would happen over a weekend where nobody is at their news desks. "
"1624440","1625860"," And it could be digested."
"1626760","1633980"," It could be digested over two or three days before it gets onto the plates of everyone on a Monday."
"1636040","1641020"," That doesn't mean that's definitely going to happen, but the threat level of it happening is very"
"1641020","1641720"," high right now. "
"1646880","1647940"," Good morning, everybody."
"1653960","1659460"," So the four sixty five sees cost 14 cents and they don't need to print."
"1660060","1662900"," They don't need to get to four sixty five to print 100%. "
"1662900","1664900"," Do you guys understand that concept?"
"1665720","1669480"," So if we go to four sixty five, they'll print like two thousand percent."
"1671060","1672040"," Does that make sense?"
"1674780","1676160"," On four sixty five sees."
"1680880","1683160"," So when you got when you guys say print out there. "
"1683880","1685940"," When someone when someone says, that's a good question, Winky."
"1686340","1690060"," When someone says, Hey, I'm going to get these to print, right?"
"1691920","1694560"," The implication is that they need 100%."
"1695500","1698580"," When you buy like a month out call option. "
"1699340","1700200"," Or put option."
"1700960","1703180"," It typically takes you two weeks to get those to print, right?"
"1703320","1707560"," It takes you like a week or two to get 20% then 40% then 60%."
"1708500","1710420"," When you trade zero dates. "
"1711420","1712940"," They typically only take."
"1713800","1714480"," What's that?"
"1716100","1720320"," Yeah, I would be embarrassing."
"1720360","1720740"," I agree. "
"1721740","1728140"," It typically doesn't take your your calls or puts on zero dates to go in the money for you to"
"1728140","1729020"," get a prince is the point."
"1732280","1733900"," Full poor Raytheon calls."
"1735720","1738820"," Yeah, Raytheon was a Northrop Gruman. "
"1742980","1743660"," They are."
"1746690","1748110"," Oh, so RTX Lucy."
"1748390","1748990"," I'm going to look at RTX. "
"1754480","1755520"," Or is that just cat?"
"1755740","1756980"," Oh, yeah, RTX Raytheon."
"1760740","1761800"," Raytheon's got a nice little."
"1763200","1764660"," Nice little move up for the war. "
"1764720","1768120"," The war move right here started back in December 20th."
"1769260","1770800"," Nice little consolidation phase."
"1773600","1777600"," Body make face that will rush or will or to start on a Sunday. "
"1780180","1783000"," Okay, so just have this and have this on your plate this morning."
"1784820","1788440"," I want you guys to understand the danger that's in the market right now."
"1789560","1790780"," As we head into this morning. "
"1791280","1793760"," I want you to see as a bull because I'm a bull."
"1794000","1795680"," You guys all know that I'm a Super Bowl."
"1795680","1798620"," I want you guys to see that this is not a normal. "
"1799260","1800780"," Well, PEC cycle for us."
"1802340","1804160"," Nothing about this is normal."
"1804980","1806900"," We haven't done this move down here. "
"1807720","1809340"," Ever in two years."
"1810540","1811640"," Never not once."
"1811640","1817580"," Not a single time have we traded this low in two straight years below the support line. "
"1826420","1827720"," No, this is a different head."
"1827860","1830020"," This is a different hedging hedging that came in yesterday."
"1833690","1834670"," I'm not sure. "
"1835230","1838090"," I'm not sure on cyber security stocks."
"1838190","1839030"," They've been getting wrecked."
"1840010","1841490"," Cyber security stocks have been. "
"1841870","1843270"," They were pond off on."
"1845890","1847690"," They're pond off on."
"1850530","1853190"," On retail traders heading into December. "
"1854090","1855310"," Let's talk about BAC."
"1855310","1860450"," Let's talk about the financial trades too because this is another odd one."
"1861170","1864930"," I hear everybody saying GS sold off because they had bad earnings. "
"1865690","1868790"," GS had great earnings and they sold off."
"1870050","1875730"," So I'm not as I'm not I'm not keyed in right now to all of the reasoning."
"1875950","1879430"," I keep hearing like we're selling off because of earnings because we're selling off because of"
"1879430","1883110"," rates selling off because of this that and the other thing. "
"1883110","1885230"," And there's more in the background going on."
"1886270","1892910"," And the advances and declineers that we're not being told or just it's the same old story with the"
"1892910","1893130"," banks."
"1893690","1900370"," They're using bullshit news for why stocks are selling off using bullshit news for why the markets"
"1900370","1902010"," are selling off in reality. "
"1902490","1904910"," They're just divesting themselves in reality."
"1905070","1906670"," They're trying to take profit wherever they can."
"1906990","1908590"," They take it down as far as they can. "
"1908710","1909490"," They'll raise it back up."
"1909810","1913990"," Take profit again and the role will continue into the end of earnings season."
"1915230","1915950"," That's what you're going to see. "
"1916070","1918770"," You're going to see us, you know, hold this, maintain this as much as we can."
"1919130","1921990"," And then we're going to sell the news down and sell this market down."
"1927300","1928360"," Hold on, what are you guys saying?"
"1928780","1930600"," How many trades on price to sales?"
"1930860","1931320"," Forget about it. "
"1931360","1931940"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"1936300","1943460"," So my thesis on my wartime thesis on Tesla, I wouldn't come into play unless it was a full scale"
"1943460","1943980"," war, right?"
"1944100","1945820"," It'll be it'll just be a proxy war right now."
"1945820","1949560"," It's not going to be the US fighting Ukraine, anything like that. "
"1950520","1952600"," It would just be like a steamroller type operation."
"1952860","1957700"," There's one guy that I talked to yesterday too that said that he doubts that they can invade"
"1957700","1963320"," because it's been a warm winter in Ukraine and tanks will get stuck in the mud."
"1964540","1968360"," But they won't be able to roll across Ukraine with a motorized invasion. "
"1970520","1971820"," What's going on?"
"1975540","1978300"," Oh, so there are some arguments against it happening."
"1978300","1984240"," But the money and manpower behind the scenes that's going on is leaking into the press."
"1984240","1986440"," And it looks it looks worse than it is, right?"
"1993350","1994310"," For all of earnings. "
"1994670","1995590"," No, we'll be for all of earnings."
"2000090","2005050"," Reality is that the future is going to be tough with inflation and certainty is causing the sell"
"2005050","2005290"," off."
"2005410","2006110"," I agree with that, Emerson. "
"2007370","2009390"," Everybody knows everybody knows today."
"2009910","2010790"," Everybody's connected."
"2012010","2013570"," Everybody knows what's happening. "
"2014570","2017090"," You've got hedge fund guys out there talking with retail guys."
"2017910","2023970"," You've got the dissemination of information across all social media."
"2024610","2028530"," You've got access to information from retail traders that they've never had before. "
"2029270","2031830"," You've got banks trying to hide their trades."
"2031830","2034910"," Now they're breaking them up more frequently than they ever have in the past."
"2036450","2042190"," And in reality, retail, though they don't control the market, they are starting to trade in the"
"2042190","2044110"," market, becoming a force in the market. "
"2044590","2050080"," Even if they don't know it, you'll see retail traders all jump in Apple, all jump in consumer"
"2050750","2054210"," cyclicals, all know when to go long, all know when to go short."
"2055070","2060510"," But there's something happening in the background of this market that tells me that bulls today"
"2061150","2062469"," think that this is the turn."
"2062469","2066429"," And I'm in calls right now, and I don't think this is the turn. "
"2066570","2068429"," I think this is a false breakout."
"2068770","2073850"," I think that no matter where we trade to, I think that it's more selling and it's deeper selling"
"2073850","2074969"," than expected."
"2074989","2081570"," And I think two days ago, as she said that the bottom was 460 right here at this yellow line,"
"2081969","2083110"," and it's not the bottom. "
"2084330","2087710"," They can't probably just can't keep up with the flow that's coming in."
"2087710","2091350"," But the flow that's coming in is way more negative than 460."
"2092550","2093870"," It's down at 438. "
"2098210","2100210"," These levels are close enough to the spy."
"2101110","2104830"," You're going to be, you're going to, for hand grenades and horseshoes, if you're trading the spy"
"2104830","2109110"," outside of us day trading, these levels, they transfer quite closely."
"2109990","2113250"," Not exact, but pretty, pretty often close. "
"2114270","2119330"," So close enough for you that when, if you look at the, I put out last night at, I think,"
"2119490","2125030"," three in the morning, I put out some support and resistance levels for the spy on Captain's Alpha."
"2125850","2127930"," Those levels work quite well."
"2129030","2132850"," And if you guys want to take and bring up, what can I do?"
"2133330","2134430"," Give me just a second here. "
"2134470","2134850"," You know what I'll do?"
"2136110","2137450"," Give me just a second."
"2137850","2138370"," It's a good question."
"2139390","2141090"," You guys want some gamma levels this morning?"
"2142790","2143410"," Hold on. "
"2144670","2145810"," Give me just a second."
"2146030","2147090"," I'll give you guys some gamma levels."
"2149430","2150830"," You guys want your gamma levels?"
"2151430","2153850"," Let me see if they can swipe some before you real quick. "
"2157840","2159280"," Give me just a second here."
"2159600","2160900"," Okay, you guys, your gamma levels."
"2170250","2172490"," I think tight, one second. "
"2174050","2174990"," It's 914."
"2175570","2177010"," You guys can pencil these in."
"2177150","2184310"," So I do send you traditional pivot points, support, and resistance levels. "
"2184310","2189210"," I like trading off those alongside gamma and volatility levels."
"2190890","2194410"," Okay, you guys, some levels if you want them."
"2197870","2199850"," Let me see what I can do here for you. "
"2206060","2207220"," Just a second here."
"2227420","2228800"," Give me just a second."
"2229180","2235400"," What I'll do is, I'm going to leave these levels up for you. "
"2235500","2237480"," Take a look at, and I'm going to scroll through them."
"2238880","2240640"," You see your spy levels over here."
"2241780","2242900"," Call wall strikes at 470. "
"2244020","2245400"," Put wall supports at 450."
"2249120","2253480"," Some key support and resistance levels, 470, 460, 455, 450."
"2256280","2260520"," And you guys can pause this video and come back. "
"2262140","2264720"," You can see we've moved down to 450, not 460."
"2265920","2266620"," I haven't even looked."
"2266780","2267980"," This is the first time I looked at this this morning. "
"2269160","2271740"," We're going to trade down below 450 guaranteed."
"2272620","2273620"," All right, so I'm going to pause this."
"2274380","2275720"," You guys can pause this on your own. "
"2283320","2284780"," You guys can pause this broadcast."
"2285220","2287740"," Go back, pause the video, take a look."
"2288660","2292160"," And if you want to add your reset, your gamma levels, because they have changed. "
"2297380","2300320"," When we, when we gap up, Daddy's asking when we gap up."
"2302620","2303760"," You're welcome, Brad."
"2307850","2309510"," Yeah, we, yeah, we, we've talked. "
"2309770","2313310"," You guys have, you guys have been paying attention to me for any kind of length of time."
"2313850","2320330"," Know that I've made videos in the past saying the only other alternatives are war."
"2321870","2323090"," War is a great distraction. "
"2324630","2325970"," We just had 60 members on the website."
"2327670","2333030"," Yeah, down in the, down the doobly Duke, down in the discussion or down in the description."
"2334050","2337370"," I have a big long splurge there, right?"
"2338670","2339670"," A big dump. "
"2339850","2342050"," It shows links to the tools that we use here."
"2342430","2347550"," It shows links to the discord and links to the website."
"2349950","2354890"," So if you guys sign up over there, we have a bunch of tools and stuff for launching in both"
"2354890","2358090"," the website and the discord over the next couple of weeks here. "
"2358310","2359430"," Got a bunch of stuff rolling out."
"2359950","2363750"," I know that this morning I have an appointment or this afternoon I have an appointment with Joe so"
"2363750","2365790"," we can start loading some content into the website."
"2373570","2381050"," Yeah, I get the point that Morgan Stanley, you know, you've got my point on GS is that you've got,"
"2381270","2384590"," I agree with your point, winky face or extent, but I'll, I agree. "
"2384690","2386250"," I understand your point, I should say."
"2386750","2388150"," You know, my point is on GS."
"2389130","2394970"," My point on GS is that you've got some fucking guy out there. "
"2396130","2402050"," That doesn't know, and some analysts, some analysts that doesn't know what the fuck he's doing."
"2404150","2406190"," Makes a projection, right?"
"2406370","2408550"," A crystal ball projection on all of these companies."
"2409730","2418130"," And then supposedly quote unquote air quotes. "
"2419450","2425650"," We already know that when you look at the analysts projections to our season, they're wrong like 70 "
"2425650","2426410","% of the time."
"2428010","2428990"," So that's all bullshit."
"2429830","2433010"," To me, it's a matter of, you know, GS was trading up since. "
"2434110","2436530"," But when was it March of 2020?"
"2437970","2443490"," Wasn't GS at like 30 bucks or something like that way back in March 2020?"
"2445330","2446350"," But I get your points."
"2448630","2450470"," Chem cars are, what's his name?"
"2450610","2452950"," I always forget how to pronounce his name, chem."
"2454010","2455330"," Kim Carson, Kim Carson. "
"2458170","2459870"," What was the Kim Carson tweet, Lucy?"
"2463610","2465370"," There are, there is a precedence for war."
"2465690","2467970"," It brings money into a country, believe it or not."
"2469610","2473230"," It eases recessionary forces. "
"2476920","2479260"," I am describing Goldman's business model."
"2481600","2483780"," I get what you're saying, Winkie, all day long."
"2484120","2485800"," I understand your point. "
"2490080","2493020"," When they say the company missed, no, they missed a little."
"2493500","2494480"," How much did they make?"
"2495400","2497420"," Was it $5.9 billion or not?"
"2497580","2498940"," I mean, was it $60 million?"
"2499180","2499620"," I feel what it was."
"2500440","2503040"," I feel like exactly what the numbers were, but they missed by just a little bit. "
"2504340","2507280"," Yeah, we need a, we need a semi moat."
"2508160","2510820"," I had to go through and learn all of his emotes too."
"2512980","2517700"," There's like a, there's like a learn how to win moon, hot, hot, hot, win moon. "
"2518100","2519680"," The bulls are on fire this morning."
"2521140","2523140"," Bulls are on fire this morning."
"2524200","2526040"," So we'll see off the bell here. "
"2526820","2529420"," I'm going to mute this for just a minute."
"2529420","2530120"," It's 9 20."
"2532700","2534060"," 211, 218 spreads. "
"2534340","2535140"," That was the entire week."
"2539830","2540250"," Yeah."
"2540370","2540690"," Oh, really?"
"2540990","2541450"," I didn't notice. "
"2541670","2544510"," I didn't know about that tweet, the 211, 218 call spreads."
"2546230","2546790"," Were they?"
"2554510","2554930"," Yeah."
"2555210","2556950"," They do have a low P."
"2557550","2562450"," That has to do with, to me, that has to do with the reason why the banks have low P."
"2562450","2568070"," Is they used to give them high P's until 2007. "
"2569690","2574490"," That's when the banks lost all faith in the, or that's when the stock market."
"2578110","2583290"," Uh, refused to give higher P's to the banks because they got burned so bad."
"2583350","2583850"," No, seven. "
"2584490","2588650"," That's been a talk over the years is that they'll never ever give higher P."
"2588650","2592310"," E ratios to the banks because they got burned so bad."
"2598660","2600560"," No, I didn't take the BAC calls."
"2601420","2602300"," I never took them. "
"2604000","2605040"," Don't trust the banks."
"2605220","2605620"," Never will."
"2607540","2608040"," Never. "
"2608160","2610520"," Did you know taking those BAC calls, Paul?"
"2618660","2621340"," Yeah, those 4,700 and 4,800 calls."
"2621820","2625040"," I watched, uh, what's his face from Spock?"
"2625040","2633740"," Spock, Emma did a, did a live stream two days ago about the 4,800 calls that were bought."
"2635940","2640020"," And I thought those expiry on those calls were the 21st. "
"2645170","2647650"," Yeah, the 4,800 calls."
"2648730","2653690"," If you look on a, on a chart for the open interest on calls right now, there are 4,800"
"2653690","2655910"," C's out there for."
"2656510","2659090"," I think they, they expire in the 21st. "
"2659190","2659950"," That could be wrong on that."
"2662210","2664690"," Yeah, I took the spy last night as well."
"2666070","2666690"," Holy shit. "
"2666770","2669570"," So Paul took the 48 weeklies for dirt cheap."
"2670030","2672530"," Did you get in after the sell off before the close on Paul?"
"2672950","2675430"," Remember we were talking about it should, it should sell off into the close."
"2677550","2681110"," So you must have got those really dirt cheap because we were talking about it just as it was"
"2681110","2681910"," selling down, right?"
"2684610","2690550"," And Rick's talking about the put spreads on the 211, 432 and 452. "
"2691350","2692130"," Yeah, those should print."
"2698100","2700800"," Oh, they're there with the 48 hundreds were done differently yesterday."
"2701360","2703840"," So before yesterday, there was massive. "
"2705020","2706580"," Calls on 4,800."
"2707660","2709980"," Sometime it, they, they came in sometime."
"2711520","2712560"," Just before. "
"2714820","2716720"," So I'll bring up BAC here as well."
"2717240","2718880"," I know you've got somebody that's in BAC."
"2726080","2727440"," Give me one second. "
"2727560","2730380"," I'm going to bring my, my, my, uh, trading my brokerage."
"2790780","2791740"," Second here."
"2795060","2800880"," I get my stuff loaded up here as well. "
"2840510","2842050"," What an epic bounce we had."
"2846880","2848460"," Nestles trading up this morning."
"2856650","2858050"," Putting the BAC. "
"2864240","2865960"," So if you're in BAC calls."
"2867220","2872220"," You want to probably be taking profit off of the bell."
"2872600","2876220"," The interest, not, not maybe not the first 30 seconds or so. "
"2876620","2880700"," But you want to be careful of call buyers not stepping in."
"2881500","2881840"," They may."
"2882160","2886160"," It's really weird on when you have high moves on earnings releases. "
"2886940","2889980"," Off the bell, you'll see the price go through the roof."
"2891960","2896320"," And then it'll drop and then it'll come back again, typically, even if it goes straight, so"
"2896320","2900780"," straight up typically, you'll see a weird interest drop at some point."
"2909540","2913540"," So I want to know you're going to, are you going to sell your calls at the bell?"
"2914380","2916300"," Or you're going to keep them on BAC. "
"2917600","2918040"," Paul."
"2919900","2920760"," Yeah, like wish."
"2921640","2923800"," I like, well, I like all those trades right now. "
"2925440","2938830"," I like"
"2938830","2939330"," the wish trade."
"2939430","2940390"," I like the Viacom trade."
"2944780","2949740"," As a matter of fact, wish looks like it might have a might might have a nice trade in it"
"2949740","2950060"," today. "
"2959260","2960920"," Three minutes until the bell opens."
"2983250","2998540"," If you"
"2998540","3002040"," guys watch yesterday, the LVS calls that came in."
"3002680","3004440"," And they're ripping as well today. "
"3006040","3007700"," So look at LVS as well."
"3008040","3012960"," Yesterday we saw, I think, 20 million or 30 million dollars come in on LVS calls."
"3013940","3018000"," And they're up to $0.44 and seven cents before the bell. "
"3084340","3085460"," Yeah, I like the wish trade."
"3091150","3092310"," What's selling off right now?"
"3092430","3092610"," Wish."
"3093170","3094610"," Eric, what do you say and just sold off?"
"3100880","3101240"," Yeah. "
"3101320","3102400"," All of you have a great day this morning."
"3103320","3103660"," Netflix."
"3104060","3104900"," You guys are going to look at Netflix. "
"3106620","3107400"," It's nine 30."
"3115840","3117620"," Green bar right off the open this morning."
"3167800","3169460"," Buyers stepping in off the bell. "
"3170540","3171560"," On spy."
"3173780","3175000"," We have a."
"3178280","3182220"," Cash gap to close down below at four 55 31."
"3185310","3187570"," I don't know if we if we see that today. "
"3187670","3189330"," I doubt we see that today if we're bullish."
"3190510","3194130"," There's another cash gap right below at four 55 49."
"3195110","3195990"," Four fifty five. "
"3196950","3199270"," Forty nine four fifty five thirty one."
"3215450","3218190"," And the algos have bought."
"3218890","3221350"," Four sixty C at a dollar 10. "
"3221870","3224150"," There's 18,000 calls in climbing."
"3225150","3226870"," On four sixty C."
"3235450","3238990"," They went from a dollar 10 to a dollar thirty two in a moment's notice."
"3274870","3277350"," BAC kind of looks a little weak off the bell. "
"3280280","3282840"," Q's have a giant green bar on them as well."

"5220730","5223920"," Can't be denied."
"5235460","5239760"," I've traded spy zero dates three times now."
"5243310","5245630"," I think I'm going to re-enter them again at this point. "
"5249720","5252800"," I've printed profit three times on spy zero dates."
"5254840","5257300"," This will be the third bounce right now."
"5265430","5266450"," Which is hilarious. "
"5269170","5272590"," I'm going to look for a spy to bounce off four fifty eight sixteen."
"5273830","5275390"," Maybe I can grab one more bounce."
"5283840","5285380"," Four fifty eight thirteen. "
"5286200","5287220"," We'll take a look at spy real quick."
"5287820","5288680"," Probably going to buy some more."
"5293360","5295280"," Just scalping like a thousand bucks a trade. "
"5299700","5301800"," Look to see if we can catch a bounce on the spy."
"5303520","5305480"," I'll come back to D.W.A.C. in just a moment."
"5310120","5313040"," I've got four marks right now if you guys want to know. "

"5320940","5324100"," Next one is four fifty six ninety three. "
"5324820","5327660"," And then four fifty six fifty eight."
"5330090","5336310"," And I'm going to wait and see if we catch any kind of a reaction at these levels."
"5336310","5345750"," And you just trade them up to four fifty nine forty seven or so. "
"5355000","5359900"," See right here these buyers this reaction down here four fifty seven ninety."
"5362760","5365060"," Still slightly more sellers than buyers."
"5365440","5370160"," This level I want to see this bar get a little bit thicker before I enter the next one. "
"5373320","5374240"," Almost there."
"5379860","5381340"," Get that nice gap close."
"5385480","5387020"," Look up D.W.A.C. next. "
"5401960","5404600"," D.W.A.C. is not looking that healthy this morning."
"5406040","5409980"," Got sellers above a one hundred ninety two thirty seven."
"5410160","5411880"," This is very weak support right now. "
"5412740","5420540"," You've got sellers consuming buyers on D.W.A.C. I'd have some concern here at seventy five."
"5421820","5425740"," And the real buyers are probably down below it's sixty maybe even lower."
"5432760","5434420"," Not quite ready to buy. "
"5435500","5439140"," So your real support is down below here between fifty and forty dollars."
"5440020","5442120"," You can see how weak this support is right now."
"5442800","5448180"," You might have some the thing is you've got overwhelming sellers on D.W.A.C. I'd use caution here. "
"5449620","5453080"," If you are a risky trader it's a good place to take a trade."
"5454680","5456900"," Because you are seeing a reaction of support here."
"5458360","5462100"," But I want you to be aware that you have way more sellers almost double the sellers. "
"5463340","5470240"," Then you have buyers on D.W.A.C. Look up Amazon next."
"5471980","5475840"," All this loads I'm going to go back to the spy I want to see if this is the bounce"
"5475840","5476720"," play again."
"5478420","5479660"," Or if it's a fake bounce. "
"5490380","5494070"," See where the real money is at on the spy."
"5494970","5496970"," I thought it was at four fifty five."
"5498610","5500170"," And down here is the real money. "
"5503300","5505220"," Might catch a nice bounce though here."
"5529950","5531570"," We'll look in to see if there's a rejection."
"5534330","5538170"," The VIX is looking like it could fall off too so we're close. "
"5559380","5565960"," Getting some real wonky shit on my brokerage this morning kind of pissing me off."

"5687840","5689560"," I'm long in the spy once again. "
"5690380","5696260"," It's like you can take Amazon to thirty two hundred and safety get back out of it."
"5696820","5702580"," Get back in it between between thirty two ten take it to thirty two thirty five."
"5704240","5708200"," I'm a little behind on the chat log right now so I don't know if you guys are saying anything"

"5754000","5759340"," Sellers are disappearing are being absorbed above on spy at four fifty eight eighty one. "
"5767240","5770860"," Still looking for that four fifty nine forty two."
"5785020","5789040"," I don't know what the fuck is going on with my my thing this morning."
"5789620","5791120"," Having some real issues here. "
"5796310","5799890"," You'd have to hear me call my brokerage and say what the fuck is going on."
"5802050","5803530"," I'm getting lag in pricing."
"5817410","5819010"," Ask you bashing around. "
"5822230","5825250"," Localize support down below for an intraday trade."
"5826030","5829090"," I like it off to one twenty eight take it to one."

"5833630","5836710"," Some real resistance at one thirty five ninety one."
"5837070","5839970"," This is this looks like you can break through this no problem here."
"5839970","5841850"," It wouldn't be too concerned. "
"5842710","5844850"," You've got great strength in buyers."

"5848530","5849990"," Makes for a nice day trade. "
"5852550","5857690"," Makes for a nice day trade to one thirty six that could print nicely."
"5859050","5860650"," If you want to look above on SQ."
"5864630","5868690"," Big sellers above are at one forty point forty cents. "
"5875440","5876680"," I'll do hood next."
"5882350","5883470"," Okay hood."
"5894800","5897620"," This is why I like having a broker and not Robin Hood. "
"5898760","5900360"," If anything goes wrong."
"5901580","5902260"," I get pissed off."
"5903600","5905720"," I've had my broker hang up on me once though. "

"5937760","5942520"," That the buyers that were down below here at thirteen bucks are now at fourteen dollars."
"5943860","5947360"," At fourteen fourteen this is a good good news. "
"5948260","5952980"," If you've got some sellers above at sixteen to be expected in seventeen I might actually enter hood"
"5952980","5953300"," today."
"5953900","5955200"," I should have entered this already."
"5956240","5958280"," But I think I'll enter it once more. "

"5998320","6000080"," Four fifty seven eleven."
"6000620","6005160"," Look at my charts here and see what I've got for some support here. "
"6006080","6013140"," As I'm looking for four sixty four fifty six ninety three and four fifty six fifty eight."
"6014920","6016900"," Which is this four sixty right here."
"6018580","6025540"," My tags are at four four fifty six fifty eight four fifty six ninety three. "
"6026320","6028500"," I don't see any eyes here at that level."
"6029500","6031000"," Kind of slightly above."
"6032060","6035520"," I'd really like to see us get down to four fifty six sixty eight and close the gap. "
"6036220","6036920"," And then start running."
"6038100","6040280"," This is the gap from yesterday down below here."
"6040860","6041280"," The closing. "

"6091740","6092700"," You're welcome Michelle."
"6094160","6096760"," Yeah Joe go get your spy poke and stick."

"6098580","6100580"," I'm not saying anything other than."
"6103850","6105550"," Yeah the gap feels very low today."
"6106350","6108050"," The gap is small as fuck. "
"6109630","6112150"," Four fifty six fifty eight is the gap fill."
"6114090","6119090"," It's like that's the bottom believe it or not for yesterday's low in cash market at least."
"6123700","6125680"," Yeah I'll do Tesla one more time for you. "
"6126780","6128400"," Someone's saying the gold miners are going to rip."

"6142620","6144720"," Are we at sixty five dollars in RK."
"6147440","6150520"," And there was some concern that if we get. "
"6151700","6153440"," I guess the price target right now."
"6153660","6155860"," Well my price target is sixty five bucks in RK."
"6155860","6159810"," The concern that I heard was. "
"6161190","6163630"," That if we get more than."
"6165210","6168910"," Four rate increases this year you could see thirty five dollars."
"6171580","6173600"," An RK so I'm still waiting. "
"6174360","6176020"," Waiting for sixty five dollars."
"6176200","6178540"," We went down to seventy six dollars so ten more bucks."
"6181000","6183140"," Hi I'll go score trade just came in. "
"6183480","6186560"," Workday we've seen that call flow come in for a few days now."

"6213210","6214590"," Yeah right here. "
"6214730","6216850"," This is where this is the cashback from yesterday."
"6218390","6220270"," This is the cashback area right here."
"6220730","6222870"," You want to you want to see us touch this. "
"6223810","6225890"," I always like when we touch this if we're bullish."
"6226410","6227790"," If we don't we miss it but."
"6229910","6232470"," You really want to see this touchdown here if you can. "
"6234170","6235710"," And then you usually take off running."
"6241280","6243000"," Everybody's saying gold GDX."
"6244700","6246200"," GLD we can look at GLD. "
"6247740","6251560"," Notice some gold bugs out there and silver bugs out there we saw a lot of silver."
"6251560","6254200"," It's not some million dollar silver calls yesterday."
"6255380","6256880"," And they're usually behind the curve right. "
"6257080","6260080"," Usually gold goes up first then silver goes up."
"6262880","6263780"," Look at gold."
"6274160","6282680"," I just saw some gold puts come in heads up on that gold puts it's G.O.L.D. February"
"6282680","6286040"," 18th nineteen P for fifty two thousand out of ton. "
"6288820","6296240"," Twitter puts Twitter put hedge June sixteenth thirty five P put that in your notes."
"6298620","6305320"," Twitter put hedge thirty five P June sixteenth nine it's eight hundred sixty six thousand dollars."
"6309810","6311450"," If you want to know the truth ungold. "
"6313510","6315530"," You just had a ton of sellers step in."
"6316570","6319030"," Nice place to take a short position."
"6320250","6320690"," Ungold. "
"6321950","6329730"," You've got call flow FOMO top buyers sellers that were right here on gold ready to sell out."
"6330650","6332130"," They're all sellers above here."
"6334870","6338550"," We can look above and below and see why you guys see this right here. "
"6339250","6341230"," So if you're in gold right now be wary."
"6343090","6344690"," I don't want to say a T on this."
"6345750","6349570"," If you're bullish on gold I'm going to tell you that this is not the chart you want to be"
"6349570","6349970"," looking at. "
"6355010","6362330"," Some bears showing up not in not in real money at this point just small money."
"6363510","6367610"," Some bears showing up on PTON gold Twitter."
"6368570","6369770"," Twitter was some money. "
"6370570","6374810"," I like there's some QQQ puts but it's very low it's like thirty five thousand dollars."
"6375930","6377990"," It's not really a big position."
"6378730","6385310"," Spy puts one twenty one four fifty eight P for two hundred thousand dollars. "
"6385690","6390590"," Spy calls though hundred thousand dollars one nineteen four sixty C."
"6391130","6397190"," Spy calls forty eight thousand dollars one nineteen four sixty C."
"6397690","6400490"," IWM some puts eighty seven thousand dollars."
"6401210","6403550"," January nineteen two oh six P."
"6404410","6407710"," So we'll see hopefully we can get a nice touchdown below."
"6411680","6415980"," And see if we get this rejection that we've been looking for off of the spy. "
"6416740","6420140"," So we'll go back and talk to Mark and some mayhem and let him know."
"6420200","6424400"," So right here you want to see this hold right here if this does not bounce and hold."
"6426060","6428300"," This is the cashback close on the spy. "
"6428300","6433280"," And if this doesn't hold right here we're we're back to the same conversation."
"6433860","6437540"," The reason that we got live this morning before the opening bell."
"6438420","6442540"," And that is the conversation that we're having that we violated. "
"6443580","6446800"," The support levels established since twenty twenty."
"6447260","6451580"," There's no real argument at this point that the market is bullish."
"6452640","6457680"," And at the context that you have taken this market at this point is that it's always sell the news. "
"6459520","6462460"," So we'll see if we break through this level of support."
"6463060","6468740"," This this would be the you know this morning when we get online everybody's like hey super bullish"
"6468740","6469340"," super bullish."
"6470380","6475080"," And if you look in previous history we should be straight bullish into Thursday. "
"6476520","6480500"," We should be straight bullish into Friday possibly even beyond."
"6481420","6485500"," But the reality is that we broke through a level that hasn't been violated."
"6485500","6486940"," I mean this is the last. "
"6488500","6491160"," Channel bottom of the spy."
"6492160","6493780"," Yes SPX."
"6494340","6495100"," RUT. "
"6496360","6496940"," IWM."
"6498060","6498940"," NQQ's."
"6500060","6505160"," All three indexes were violated in the over there violated yesterday into the close. "
"6505900","6509080"," They're violated again into the overnight."
"6509780","6512600"," And it does posit the question of."
"6513560","6517600"," Are we bullish or are we bearish and I'm telling you that we're bearish 100%. "
"6519240","6522320"," There's even if we even if we bounce off this level this morning."
"6523400","6528600"," This should be a fake out this should not be a run to 480 this we should find a proper"
"6528600","6529960"," rejection at some point."
"6530540","6534100"," And trade down to those levels that we talked about that 438. "
"6535040","6537160"," We should be trading down there at some point."
"6538340","6543120"," Regardless of what the market is telling you or what it should be telling you under normal"
"6543120","6543620"," circumstances."
"6546480","6547800"," So wait and see if this holds. "
"6548480","6549880"," If this does not hold."
"6550700","6553420"," Then we're right back in the context we didn't even get to."
"6553920","6557460"," I think what we're looking at this morning on the spy we're I think we're looking I'm going to take"
"6557460","6558060"," a look right now. "
"6561520","6563940"," We're looking for a rejection off of."
"6564780","6567940"," I think the first place we talked over look at what I charted this morning."
"6567940","6576410"," And on that the under the surface stuff that's going on. "
"6577030","6580430"," Is that we have stupid declineers versus advances."
"6581330","6581810"," Market wide."
"6582470","6586450"," I think we said look for a rejection at four yeah 459. "
"6587210","6592010"," Next rejection point was somewhere around 466 3."
"6594130","6597450"," Next rejection point if we couldn't get over the hump was 468."
"6598030","6601830"," And we haven't even made it that far yet we're bouncing right now retesting below."
"6602010","6603790"," The close from yesterday. "
"6605330","6607570"," We could just start selling off at this point."
"6608250","6611230"," We know that SG said some bullshit about it being for 60."
"6612130","6617770"," 4600 but we know that that's not true because hedges were taken out yesterday at 4380. "
"6618890","6621470"," So the put wall is not at 4600."
"6622650","6628290"," That is guaranteed 100% positively sure that the put wall is not at 4600."
"6628730","6630170"," That's complete utter bullshit. "
"6631010","6636670"," So whether it sells off today tomorrow or if it takes until Monday or Tuesday."
"6638310","6641330"," For it to sell down and we know that that put wall."
"6641850","6647070"," It was put out or the pool I was extended with puts down to on February 18th. "
"6648670","6654250"," Which is very close right you know normally see hedging taken out a month out usually see taken out"
"6654250","6657490"," three months out six months out some time put on it."
"6658250","6661350"," But you know this position that was taken yesterday."
"6662590","6664490"," Definitely lowered our put wall it's like 440. "
"6665290","6667710"," Somewhere in there maybe leaving lower."
"6668650","6677770"," And so I'm expecting us to I'm expecting this bullish turn in the bulls thesis to be a false hope."
"6683480","6684860"," So we'll see if we break below here. "
"6688140","6693060"," You did see buyers blow at 455 we showed this at the opening this morning."
"6693720","6697380"," There there's this line of buyers here at 4505."
"6698360","6701140"," Let's look below see if we can find some targets even lower. "
"6701840","6703300"," We're talking about that 438."
"6707100","6710500"," This is interesting to see why you guys to notice this right here 455."
"6711860","6713000"," Clear skies below. "
"6721770","6723570"," Some support right now at 450."
"6729400","6731880"," There's nothing below the below 450 right."
"6733600","6737780"," Nothing until you get to 445 449 looks like this some support. "
"6745020","6748560"," 442 is actually a nice price target that's probably what it's going to be."
"6749640","6752340"," 442 is what I'm looking for down here into February."
"6754260","6755540"," It's pretty bearish right. "
"6776200","6778780"," That's a nice ice below here at 456."
"6780380","6784920"," 58 that was broken through broke through the 58 mark right here."
"6785860","6789340"," Next support level 45500. "
"6791640","6811990"," You guys"
"6811990","6815570"," keep asking for Tesla to look at Tesla."
"6840360","6842500"," Watching calls coming in on the lift."
"6843340","6846760"," Hi, I'll go score to 18 42.5 C."
"6849600","6851820"," Hi, I'll go score SDOW. "
"6852720","6855620"," February 18 29 C for $80,000."

"6873700","6875760"," Twitter flow is out of control right now."
"6876040","6877340"," I don't know what news came out on Twitter. "
"6878380","6881160"," Seeing more hedging 616."
"6882420","6884620"," That's June 16 30 P."
"6885100","6888360"," We saw some hedging almost $100,000 coming earlier."
"6888360","6895560"," Now we've see a split or two sweeps for $495,000 and $408,000. "
"6895820","6897580"," June 16 30 P."
"6898640","6904680"," Now seeing light AMD puts coming in January 21 130 P."
"6917770","6919370"," Still loading a little bit of this."
"6919630","6920830"," What are we going on with this?"
"6927140","6930500"," Now seeing some lift calls are puts come in."
"6931080","6933840"," Lift January 21 40 P."
"6936260","6938040"," See if this is a real level here. "
"6938180","6944000"," We broke through 10 30 was the way the buyers were to say showing 10 27."
"6944000","6951440"," Looks like there's buyers backtracking or back staggering on the spawn Tesla."
"6952260","6953380"," One second here. "
"6953440","6954340"," See what's going on with my."
"6958420","6959800"," Give us a minute to load up."
"6974180","6980160"," Microsoft puts coming in Microsoft looked like a good trade and there is some put flow coming in"
"6980160","6984780"," now January 21 300 P or $91,000. "
"6986160","6989920"," Get a little bit of a freeze here on the on my book map."
"6998240","7000000"," Give me just a second."
"7000140","7001200"," I'm going to check my. "
"7002180","7005260"," Want to see if I've got something going on the background here."
"7018580","7019580"," And I do."
"7020880","7024640"," I've got an I've got a virus scan happening right now. "
"7024780","7026340"," Access is denied, huh?"
"7028500","7032040"," I've got some malware running in the background."
"7032540","7034820"," Anti malware software running."
"7035280","7035620"," Excellent. "
"7041410","7042190"," Perfect timing."
"7069420","7071280"," So it says that I've got it."
"7071660","7072700"," It says it's funny. "
"7072860","7074000"," It says that I've got it off."
"7074320","7077560"," But of course in the background, you can't really turn this stuff off."
"7082700","7084040"," It's saying that it's off, but. "
"7084980","7087620"," It says threats are found to have always have always had that happening."
"7089680","7090520"," Windows sucks."
"7091900","7099770"," I think I turned it off by trying to close the file. "
"7101950","7107030"," After where I have to probably get a lighter weight antivirus than the Microsoft."
"7108990","7111510"," And then just and then just have that one run in the background."
"7111770","7113470"," I'm having some problems with Windows Defender. "
"7114210","7115570"," Just doing its thing."
"7116150","7120010"," Yeah, so big support down below at 1000 on Tesla."
"7120750","7122090"," Same spot as before. "
"7123010","7123950"," 1030 was broken."
"7124010","7125490"," You can see it was broken above here."
"7125990","7127250"," Actually up here is where it was broken. "
"7128970","7130770"," So the support's just being killed here."
"7132010","7135170"," 1000 same spot as the beginning of this morning."
"7136910","7138050"," Nothing's changed on Tesla. "
"7188630","7193450"," So last night I took a look at my Windows Defender and it was running it yesterday."
"7193810","7195690"," It ran during the broadcast."
"7196770","7201210"," I thought I turned it off yesterday, but then someone told me that it'll run without me knowing. "
"7202050","7208110"," So I think I'm having Windows Defender running a scan every morning at 1030."
"7208550","7209170"," I don't know why."
"7209550","7212290"," And my schedule is for 2am. "
"7213170","7215090"," It's doing it right during the middle of the broadcast."
"7216230","7218410"," I guess it does in the background lies to you."
"7227510","7229250"," So pay attention to the spies. "
"7229610","7236120"," See if any reaction off this 4.55. Check the comments section here."
"7238300","7241320"," Yeah, so we talked about this at the start of the broadcast."
"7241580","7245220"," You guys need to get in here early in the morning so you can see where the support. "
"7245440","7247820"," So we show Tesla right at the start this morning."
"7248640","7249980"," We show it at the start every morning."
"7252280","7253980"," Thanks for working on the Russian bots. "
"7256140","7257180"," F just dumped."
"7261310","7264490"," Yeah, do you guys know of a good AV for me?"
"7264730","7265310"," Do you know what the?"
"7266890","7268670"," Do you know what the lowest."
"7270430","7272630"," What do you know what the lowest. "
"7273970","7279590"," Uh, software like which antivirus uses the least amount of."
"7280890","7285500"," I think that I've got a Amazon delivery."
"7299370","7395800"," Have some Nvidia puts coming in January 21 to 57.94. Okay,"
"7395980","7399540"," watching Nvidia puts come in January 21 to 50 P."
"7400360","7408320"," QQQ's puts coming in January 19th, 370 P for $160,000 January 19th. "
"7408940","7412660"," QQQ puts coming in $146,000."
"7413800","7419720"," Then I've got spy calls, $116,000, $129, 459 C."
"7420980","7425420"," Then also watching IWM puts coming in two sets."
"7427260","7430120"," 119, 204, 52,000. "
"7431000","7436200"," And then IWM 119, 204 P, $38,000."
"7439500","7444980"," The VIX looks like it's at a localized top, but I assume that it's going to trade up to."
"7447080","7447960"," 23, 39. "
"7448800","7450200"," That's where it should trade up to."
"7450640","7451480"," Maybe slightly higher."
"7451640","7451840"," Let me look. "
"7451980","7452220"," Let me look."
"7462260","7467000"," Looking for the VIX to top out at 23, 43 in the two minute chart here."
"7468680","7473620"," It is curling over at the moment, looking like it wants to roll over at this point, but. "
"7474400","7480380"," Even though it is looking like that, the structure of this VIX chart is a."
"7480380","7482440"," An expanding bullish megaphone."
"7483580","7484820"," Actually, no, it's a bearish."
"7484980","7485500"," Yeah, it's a bear. "
"7485640","7486280"," No, let me take a look."
"7487340","7489440"," I hate using megaphones, but."
"7491780","7493020"," Yeah, it's slightly bullish. "
"7494120","7496200"," It's not quite bullish or bearish."
"7501020","7502400"," And it's tough to say."
"7503180","7508020"," But it is close to the top of this megaphone here and that number is 23, 40. "
"7508020","7513460"," If it does break above 23, 40, it is no good for the bulls."
"7513760","7515340"," It looks like it'll trade up here, at least."
"7516040","7519560"," And that would take us down to 4.55 at a minimum. "
"7519960","7533560"," If we get back, if we can get back down here to 4.55. Chase"
"7533560","7535980"," is saying that metals are ripping on inflation play."
"7544220","7546160"," Large put flow on GT."
"7547340","7548860"," That's gamma tango. "
"7550440","7553840"," Six or six, 17, 23 P."
"7554280","7561240"," This is only a, you know, like a $20 stock or something, but someone took out $250,000 on puts."
"7572040","7576820"," It's a small buy program kicking in on spy right now."
"7582240","7587700"," Tesla is down close to its $1,000 support area as well. "
"7587840","7588740"," We'll look at Tesla again."
"7599040","7604800"," Yeah, I thought we spent an entire hour this morning on when does it sell off?"
"7604960","7606300"," How deep does it sell off?"
"7607780","7613600"," So let me know out there if you think we catch a bounce today off 4.55 and run higher"
"7613600","7615420"," into the weekend."
"7616480","7623300"," Or if you agree with the point that underneath the surface, we should sell down to like, well, I"
"7623300","7628800"," don't know, I think it's 4.28. I know some of you guys think that it's not going to happen. "
"7632040","7634720"," But I will play this bounce if we do catch a bounce here."
"7635020","7636300"," I've got some calls out there."
"7637140","7638040"," Some spy calls. "
"7638320","7643300"," I'll probably add to them if we catch a good bounce off 55 and see if we trade higher."
"7644540","7645640"," 2, 4, 60."
"7649140","7651080"," Some gold puts coming in again. "
"7651080","7653720"," February 18th, 19."
"7653880","7657360"," It's G.O.L.D. more puts again."
"7657660","7660440"," That's 19 P on gold. "
"7666210","7668250"," We'll get this down on a more finite."
"7671580","7676460"," We'll look at G.L.D. again and we'll look at Tesla see if there's a good reaction here."
"7680450","7687010"," And the VIX is working its way back up to that 2340 area. "
"7688030","7690630"," Hopefully we can get a bounce down here in 455."
"7691330","7694330"," See if there's rejection or see if the VIX breaks above."
"7710080","7712240"," Supports in that same area on Tesla. "
"7713440","7715440"," Basically 1,143."
"7718560","7720160"," You'll want to see this hold."
"7720440","7722560"," I do want you to know if you are a Tesla bull out there. "
"7723360","7729600"," That you can break through slightly maybe down to, I don't think it's down to 981."
"7729600","7730400"," Possibly."
"7730800","7734200"," If you break through here and bounce around a little bit, it's not so bad. "
"7734660","7740100"," But I do want you to know if you break through 1000 on Tesla and it turns into a resistance"
"7740100","7745140"," point that that is a very negative transition for Tesla at this point."
"7745940","7751600"," This is the typical lead up to earnings by the dip zone for most of the bulls."
"7751880","7754020"," This is where all the bulls are buying the bottom on Tesla. "
"7754800","7763660"," If this does break and hold, if it turns into resistance, this does reinforce the point that we"
"7763660","7767140"," should be selling this market into I think no later than Tuesday."
"7769850","7774810"," Although those puts came out for February 18th, I think the expectation is that it sells off harder"
"7774810","7780310"," and heavier before we ever get to the 18th of February."
"7782190","7790080"," All right, so I'm going to leave you guys with a spy on at this point. "
"7790560","7792960"," You're going to be looking for a rejection here at 455."
"7793720","7801180"," If you see the spy, if you don't see a rejection like a full on bounce, if you see it"
"7801180","7807800"," hit 455 and the buyers get consumed just like when we're trading above."
"7808040","7811740"," If you don't see a hard rejection, it looks like you're going to trade higher. "
"7811740","7823700"," So I want you to be looking for that on the spy at this point at"
"7823700","7824980"," this 455 level."
"7832790","7836770"," I'm also seeing Tesla puts coming in now."
"7837350","7841730"," This could be FOMO bears or bears no more than they're letting on. "
"7842170","7851810"," We've got Tesla January 21, 1000 P, $500,000 and we have Tesla 1000 P"
"7851810","7854250"," for $685,000."
"7854250","7859310"," This is a push by the bears to break below support on the market."
"7862580","7865600"," I don't know why I'm having issues this morning. "
"7983840","7985380"," Should load up here in just a minute."
"8016330","8018310"," Watching more gold puts come in."
"8026400","8028020"," All right, so I'm going to take a break here. "
"8028240","8029640"," I have to make a phone call this morning."
"8029800","8032020"," I got to call Joe donut and talk about a website."
"8033140","8035200"," So let me get back with you in a minute. "
"8035200","8037100"," I'm going to leave this chart up with you this morning."
"8037100","8040900"," If I see any other pivots, I see more put flow coming in."
"8041300","8051120"," I am seeing some call flow and CSX January 21, 33.33 calls, 451, 451,000 dollars. "
"8051560","8052520"," Looks like transportation."
"8054280","8057280"," Transportation's been doing quite well as this week as well."
"8058560","8059420"," Generally speaking. "
"8060420","8062340"," So I'm going to get back to you guys in just a minute here."
"9779620","9782060"," All right, so we touched down at 455."
"9783600","9791700"," I am seeing more resistance above now at 4, 5, 6.50. And below we're not seeing anything but blue"
"9791700","9792080"," skies. "
"9792420","9794600"," There is some turbulence down here to 450."
"9795480","9800520"," You want to look to see if we have any buyers show up down here at 450 or not."
"9800520","9804920"," Otherwise you know that the buyers are right down here at this 455 level. "
"9806080","9807440"," So I'm going to leave it down here."
"9807820","9812100"," You can see more resistance showing up above here again at that 4, 5, 6, 53."
"9813020","9814480"," And we'll check back. "
"9814680","9818700"," I'll check back here just a little bit and see if this firms up."
"9818840","9824620"," If you see another red line up here down below here at 450, it's going to show that the buyers"
"9824620","9826580"," are stepping down from here."
"9826580","9829580"," Okay, we're currently they are here turning around at 455. "
"9831480","9835780"," So we'll check back here in a little bit and just see if this is bottom or if we keep"
"9835780","9836940"," continue to trade down."
"11978190","11981190"," For whoever, yes, yes, that was a buy program."
"11981630","11982490"," I saw someone asked. "
"12049950","12052650"," You can see right here in a larger time frame."
"12052830","12054050"," So I'm going to scoot in here."
"12054230","12055770"," Sorry for the noise, the reverb. "
"12058320","12060700"," You can see the firm rejection down here at 455."
"12062200","12063120"," Sorry, I got some."
"12064280","12065760"," I'm doing a bunch of work here in the background. "
"12066920","12070360"," You can see firm rejection down below here at 450, 503."
"12071300","12072760"," There is resistance."
"12072940","12078400"," You can see this yellow sellers above here for 57 16. "
"12080140","12085100"," Sometimes we'll trade you'll bounce off trade up and reject and continue on a downward path."
"12085460","12088900"," But there was a buy program that stepped in this all looks like basing so far."
"12088900","12091260"," I can't say that it's going to sell off one more time. "
"12091640","12094480"," If there was a place for you to sell again, take another short."
"12095000","12097380"," This would be probably be it for right now."
"12097800","12099040"," You can look higher above. "
"12099180","12104470"," You can see that the sellers move down to the 457 level."
"12104470","12107510"," We'll look above from here to see what's going on."
"12109390","12111730"," Get some more sellers here at 459. "
"12112750","12115370"," Looks like they moved down from 459 41."
"12115370","12121250"," They're starting to feed into this area here down here."
"12121350","12121630"," What was this?"
"12121890","12123110"," 458 93. "
"12127740","12129900"," This does look like some form of basing here."
"12131000","12136240"," I did notice below at the 450 mark, it did firm up a little bit."
"12136740","12139960"," Earlier there was a gray, like a very light light shadow at 450. "
"12141420","12142680"," Let's see if we can see it again."
"12144760","12148900"," There really wasn't any buyers down here."
"12148980","12150940"," It was all volatility here. "
"12151460","12154160"," You see this started firming up back here, right?"
"12154300","12160800"," You can see that at 10 a.m. We started to see some formation down here at 450."
"12162020","12164440"," We knew the rejection would happen at 450 down here."
"12164460","12166400"," We knew that there was a steady supply of buyers. "
"12167660","12174620"," We could reject here right where we are."
"12174620","12182020"," Let's take another stab at being short, see if we can get this to show a little bit clearer."
"12184500","12189760"," If you are still bearish, this would be the new spot to take another short. "
"12190720","12198180"," If we break through this area of resistance at 457, expect us to trade up to at least 459."
"12199780","12201880"," That would be the next target for you if you were bear."
"12207560","12209860"," See this doesn't look like we are consuming sellers. "
"12210160","12211480"," Hero keeps turning more positive."
"12212180","12212600"," Yeah, you are."
"12212720","12213500"," You can see down below. "
"12214080","12219700"," Okay, so this is what you're seeing is as we're selling down, you notice that, or I don't know if"
"12219700","12220000"," you noticed."
"12220240","12220900"," I mentioned it earlier."
"12221360","12224420"," Omar brought it up was that you can see the buyer. "
"12224560","12225860"," This is buyers consuming sellers."
"12226080","12228120"," When you have more buyers than sellers, that's what's happening."
"12228660","12234600"," Regardless of what the Hero indicator is saying, you want to be watching the Hero indicator not for"
"12234600","12235480"," five or ten minutes. "
"12235480","12237760"," You want to be watching it for an entire day."
"12238140","12244860"," It gives you insight into the overall market, but it tends not to, you can sometimes see, sometimes"
"12244860","12249260"," you'll see spy trade in one direction all day long, right?"
"12249840","12255480"," You might see it trading down as well, and we could be flat in price."
"12256140","12258880"," You can see the Hero indicator trading down while we're flat in price. "
"12259260","12261760"," You can see the Hero indicator trading down while we're flat in price."
"12261760","12265380"," You can see the Hero indicator going up as we're flat in price as well."
"12265720","12268520"," Right now currently the Hero indicator is going back up at the moment. "
"12269360","12271160"," This could just be brief though, for where we are."
"12272660","12278340"," You want to take usually the full day of the Hero indicator to think about your next day."
"12279100","12280780"," It's kind of, it works sometimes. "
"12281240","12283740"," It works when it works and it doesn't work when it doesn't."
"12284260","12288700"," It's something that I don't use as a secondary tool."
"12289300","12293540"," What you really want to see though is we knew that 450 down here had major support. "
"12293920","12295440"," It should be out of your shorts down here."
"12296060","12302180"," You also can see above here that there's some localized resistance right where we are here at 457."
"12304420","12305980"," You can see that back here. "
"12306120","12309460"," We're starting to break above that resistance here, this ice that you see."
"12310020","12312660"," So you might come above drop down here."
"12313160","12316020"," You can see it's a little thicker on sellers right here than we have buyers. "
"12316020","12321780"," It makes somewhat equal, but it does look like the sellers are waiting for a 4.59 at this point."
"12322940","12326480"," So if you're going to take a short, if you want to take a risky short, this is the place."
"12326960","12335010"," If you want to wait to take a short, your next stop that you're looking for is 4.59. I"
"12335010","12338230"," don't know if that helps you guys or not at this point. "
"12338810","12345210"," You saw where the, I mean it was playing as day to see where major support was on spy earlier"
"12345210","12345710"," down here."
"12345710","12347510"," 450 is no reason to see it breaking."
"12348450","12350730"," You want to see it, it did bounce off. "
"12351210","12356790"," You want to see it bounce here and then kind of stay down here at 455 for a long period"
"12356790","12357150"," of time."
"12357770","12359250"," And then you'd make your next leg down."
"12360230","12365130"," If we get this bouncer then looking for rejection above and you could see back here, if you look"
"12365130","12368050"," back in time, there was a nice yellow bar right here of rejection. "
"12368670","12370570"," So we'll see if these sellers get absorbed."
"12371350","12373430"," And right now you can see that we've got more buyers and sellers."
"12373430","12378730"," You know that the next tag above is 4.59. I don't know if that helps or not. "
"12381450","12385070"," What are signs to look for and book map how to tell them between the normal activity."
"12385130","12385830"," I have no idea."
"12386050","12386350"," Oh well. "
"12386530","12387110"," Okay, that's okay."
"12387590","12388150"," We'll get through this."
"12388870","12389330"," We'll take a minute. "
"12389690","12391210"," I was doing some work here, but."
"12392950","12393890"," So this morning."
"12395830","12397630"," We're looking for, so this morning, right?"
"12397730","12399090"," So we use traditional charting methods. "
"12399710","12401610"," We chart out our day every single day."
"12401610","12406450"," We're looking for normal support resistance levels, pivot points."
"12407390","12409850"," And then we're also looking for the opening bell. "
"12410030","12412530"," Where are we getting buyers or sellers?"
"12413190","12414590"," The amount of volume that we're getting."
"12415230","12419210"," You're also looking for any of the previous day swing highs, swing lows."
"12420590","12421810"," You chart those out on your chart. "
"12422830","12425250"," We know that we knew that we had swing swing."
"12425610","12429050"," We knew that we had some cashbacks to close at."
"12429530","12435010"," Four fifty seven, fifty five, four, fifty six, ninety six and four, fifty six, fifty eight. "
"12436190","12436670"," Right."
"12437070","12442730"," We also had one more target below from yesterday at four, fifty five, twenty eight."
"12444090","12447230"," And we had major support down below at four, fifty five. "
"12447370","12451290"," We had a big yellow or big red bar down below this morning at four, fifty five."
"12451790","12454270"," And so we closed that gap from yesterday."
"12454270","12456690"," That was the one thing I look back. "
"12456810","12460530"," That was the actual swing low from yesterday, the previous day."
"12461070","12465490"," And you would check back a previous swing low if it was lower from the day before."
"12466270","12471490"," So if today is, excuse me, if today is Wednesday, right?"
"12472050","12478050"," If we had been open on Monday or Friday, if that low of the day was lower than Tuesday, you'd"
"12478050","12482730"," then be checking back two days, three days, whatever it was to close that up. "
"12482730","12488470"," We don't always close it, but it's a good place to look if we trade down and mark that on"
"12488470","12489710"," your traditional charts, right?"
"12490350","12494410"," So we did see us hit this mark this morning at four, fifty five."
"12494830","12498650"," Once we hit four, fifty five, you're looking for specific reactions."
"12499130","12500670"," It's the same on the flip side of your bull. "
"12501010","12508350"," If you see us come down here and just kind of hang out on this level down here, and you're"
"12508350","12514050"," seeing more sellers than buyers, you're going to look for us to trade below four fifty five."
"12514670","12521370"," But if you see the buy program start, you see us flip from sellers to buyers, and you see us"
"12521370","12523190"," reject off this bottom red line."
"12523190","12525610"," This was a big thick red line earlier, right?"
"12525790","12528450"," Then you're going to look for a bounce here to look above. "
"12528950","12535350"," And then you're going to be looking above this bounce and look for where the next concentration of"
"12535350","12536110"," sellers are."
"12536110","12540590"," The first light resistance was right where we are at four fifty seven."
"12540870","12542950"," This next white, see this white line above. "
"12543210","12546870"," This is your next light resistance above at four fifty nine."
"12547310","12549230"," And so we'll take a look above four fifty nine."
"12549530","12551710"," We'll say, okay, we've got some light so you can see it here. "
"12552270","12553410"," Some light resistance here."
"12553690","12558890"," This yellow line was stronger resistance, but these guys swooped down to sell down over here."
"12559470","12561290"," So now you've got some resistance at four fifty nine. "
"12561290","12566170"," If we break through four fifty seven four fifty nine, you're going to look even higher at that"
"12566170","12568630"," point because there's nobody above."
"12568770","12569990"," There's no sellers above, right?"
"12570450","12573530"," They've all moved down at this point onto the spy."
"12573870","12578510"," So we'll take a look higher and see where our next place is to look for our next above targets. "
"12579250","12585750"," After four sixty nine is going to be four seventy five and then four eighty or four seventy nine"
"12585750","12586130"," thirty."
"12586750","12588930"," Now this stuff changes over time as we trade through the day."
"12588930","12592670"," You're going to look for different hedging activity, put activity, call activity. "
"12593330","12596970"," It will all impact how this moves and changes throughout the day."
"12597270","12598370"," But these are all real numbers."
"12598550","12600370"," This is the most accurate information you can get. "
"12600770","12602550"," It's more accurate, more accurate than anything you're paying."
"12602750","12605230"," You're like any other brokerage that you've got to think or swim."
"12605890","12609710"," Unless you've got like ninja trading, it's faster than ninja for me. "
"12610030","12611510"," It's faster than trading view."
"12612250","12613710"," Any of the other services that I've paid for."
"12613890","12615870"," So you want the most accurate of data information. "
"12616410","12616770"," This is it."
"12618130","12624270"," This is the place and you want to combine all this information along with gamma with volatility"
"12624270","12624750"," levels."
"12625530","12627670"," And then come up with with with what you're thinking. "
"12627690","12628050"," Okay."
"12628390","12633230"," But the one quick thing to be looking at is you know where hard support support levels are."
"12633630","12635350"," I don't know if Tesla bounced it. "
"12635430","12636690"," I haven't been paying attention to the market."
"12637570","12638990"," Let me look at Tesla real quick."
"12640110","12646510"," Now, did Tesla bounce off that 11 or that 11 or 1000 level this morning?"
"12646790","12650790"," It should have because we talked about that at the opening bell. "
"12650910","12652950"," We talked about it as it was selling off."
"12653070","12656190"," There was some weak resistance off of 1050."
"12656570","12659730"," And then we had the somewhat support at 1030. "
"12660710","12664230"," And the real real support, the real buyers were waiting at 1000."
"12664230","12666210"," So it tagged down below it."
"12666350","12668590"," Tesla tagged down below at 99550. "
"12668970","12672650"," But this has been a usual spot where bulls will take along."
"12673350","12677810"," The usual spot where algos were kick will kick in to want to take a long trade."
"12678150","12680370"," And that did happen this morning on Tesla as well. "
"12681010","12684210"," So the next question is, are you bullish here or you bearish?"
"12685610","12692810"," You could have been bullish from 455 or 450 to this 457 moments on spy, right?"
"12692810","12694390"," So you take this trade to here."
"12694850","12698190"," And then now if you're a bull, what you're going to do is you're going to wait until we trade"
"12698190","12698570"," above."
"12699810","12701810"," Let's look at the area here. "
"12702210","12703710"," You're going to jump back into a trade."
"12706490","12709250"," Looks like the bulls are winning currently just as a heads up."
"12709690","12712290"," Looks like the sellers are being consumed here at 457. "
"12712770","12715350"," So you could take this trade up to 459."
"12716370","12721310"," You get out of your trade, get back into the trade above 45910 unless something changes."
"12721310","12725870"," Let's just see this white ice area turn into maybe a yellow or a red, right?"
"12726430","12727250"," So you're going to look for some. "
"12727370","12730790"," Now you're looking for resistance at 45893."
"12731190","12737070"," You take along here and you keep trading this up until there's some firm rejection."
"12737890","12741870"," You're looking for firm rejection just like you're looking for firm support. "
"12742110","12748090"," Big red lines below, big red lines above, anything that's light and white like this or yellow,"
"12748250","12752930"," light yellow, thin, that's like a minor support or resistance area."
"12753730","12756530"," You key all this information in with your traditional charting."
"12757010","12760490"," And then you're also going to be looking at options flow in the background, right?"
"12760610","12764990"," So you want to see if the flow is turning on you as you get to these levels of support"
"12764990","12767670"," or excuse me, resistance or support down below. "
"12772040","12773420"," Yeah, and Chase was saying Chase was out."
"12773580","12779480"," You know, Chase, I got to tell you, there really isn't this is not an investor or swing traders"
"12779480","12780380"," market right now."
"12780840","12786640"," I don't know if anyone's telling you that it is out there or not, but in all honesty, this is"
"12786640","12788840"," a day traders market for the foreseeable future. "
"12789080","12792220"," More than likely at least until February at latest."
"12793160","12799180"," You won't find anything that you can take unless you're buying spreads possibly."
"12799540","12803580"," And even with buying spreads, the moment that you're in the money, you probably need to sell out of"
"12803580","12803760"," them. "
"12804080","12806500"," And that's for both sides, bullish and bearish."
"12807460","12809360"," Otherwise, everything is about timing right now."
"12809600","12811280"," This is a traders market for the next. "
"12812220","12817700"," I want to say at least the next two to three months is not an investors market."
"12817940","12822780"," This is not even a bear market yet in terms of I can set it and forget it."
"12824720","12830400"," So I guess if you wanted to be a bear, you'll see look for the opportunities and day trade it"
"12830400","12830680"," down. "
"12831740","12834520"," And then if you really wanted to be like, hey, I want to be a bear, but I don't want"
"12834520","12836400"," to pay attention to it at all times."
"12837280","12840580"," Then you're looking for highs."
"12840640","12846200"," You're looking for like 475, 480, those kind of marks for a trade down. "
"12846360","12849720"," You're going to be looking at the example for Chase."
"12850080","12851500"," He's been wondering this for two days now."
"12852060","12857940"," So do you want to know where your next short is on spy as a bear and not paying attention"
"12857940","12858480"," to it?"
"12860180","12866300"," It's at currently it's at 469, 97. "
"12867740","12872340"," So if you want to step away and say, hey, look, I'm not going to trade this right now."
"12872340","12874000"," And I really want to get the best price."
"12874720","12877560"," And today it's 469, 70, right?"
"12877740","12879040"," You're waiting to take that short. "
"12879840","12881580"," Like I want to take and forget about it."
"12882360","12883240"," That's what you're doing."
"12884000","12886440"," But otherwise this market is flipped completely. "
"12887000","12888920"," There's no more investor class in this market."
"12889040","12890140"," It's day trading."
"12891100","12894580"," I wouldn't even say that you could trade overnight right now in this market. "
"12894580","12899240"," You can, but there's a lot of it's complex, more complicated than set it and forget it for three"
"12899240","12899440"," days."
"12900160","12902420"," I don't even think you're safe taking weeklies here."
"12902780","12908000"," I think it's only safety right now is if you take a weekly, you're going to cash out of it"
"12908000","12908520"," same day. "
"12908740","12910140"," You're looking for a price to hit."
"12911020","12912260"," Same, same effing day."
"12912380","12914840"," It's sad to say that, but that's what it is currently at this moment. "
"12917010","12919270"," And you see us trading up right now to spy."
"12919750","12920330"," Let me take a look at it."
"12923770","12925230"," A smaller time frame. "
"12925690","12929290"," And you can see we've gained straight back everything that we've lost in the spy at this point."
"12929390","12929830"," Almost right."
"12929970","12932630"," We're back to the scene of the crime from this morning. "
"12933330","12937570"," You could have taken this trade rep to 458 or it looks like right now."
"12937570","12941070"," It'll easily trade up to 458, 94."
"12941290","12941910"," It looks like it will. "
"12943130","12944850"," It's backing off a little bit here."
"12945910","12951830"," You know, the safety in this trade was off 450 and higher to 457, but I wouldn't look to be"
"12951830","12954910"," a seller here until at least 458, 93."
"12955550","12957730"," And the call flow is coming in right now across the board. "
"12957950","12958430"," There's call flow."
"12958950","12960850"," There's million dollar calls coming in an IWM."
"12961170","12963250"," There's a bunch of spy calls coming in right now. "
"12963710","12967710"," So you match all this stuff up and it points towards higher at this point."
"12969070","12973870"," Yeah, I know it sucks to say you really can't swing trade unless I mean you can."
"12974390","12979350"," If you see a rejection at that 469, that would be the safe play that you could hold for probably"
"12979350","12979990"," a week or two. "
"12980770","12984190"," But otherwise, you know, let me bring this up in a better way."
"12984950","12986830"," Let me explain this in a better way for you guys."
"12989010","12990390"," I'm going to show you guys something here. "
"12992530","12993990"," So I want to show you guys something."
"12996130","12998450"," Let's see if I can explain this better here."
"13000510","13003090"," I don't know if I can do this with a snipping tool. "
"13010100","13014300"," So I'm going to explain this to you guys here in just a second."
"13015720","13019680"," Okay, so you guys paying attention right now."
"13020500","13021820"," This is what I'm going to show you. "
"13030120","13032680"," So now we're in the time right now."
"13032760","13037240"," This has become amplified even last year and there before it was amplified."
"13037740","13042800"," But this month in the next three months specifically, it's become even more amplified. "
"13042800","13051360"," So before you had high frequency traders, you could follow a trend line up, let's say."
"13052200","13052420"," Right?"
"13054800","13060860"," And let's say in this trend line, you could buy this trend line as it headed up."
"13062080","13062700"," Right?"
"13065910","13066990"," Just like this. "
"13069230","13078450"," And you could have bought here or here or here and you'd have a steep enough incline on it that"
"13078450","13082990"," your one month out or two month out call would still print nice."
"13083050","13086010"," Even if even if it only printed 30% 50% or whatever."
"13087990","13092490"," Now what has taken place is now I'm going to show you it's gotten even worse. "
"13092490","13096670"," But your swings weren't so bad, right?"
"13096870","13097750"," They were kind of more like this."
"13097890","13099190"," I should make it better like this."
"13099990","13100230"," Okay. "
"13101090","13109450"," Now what's happened in this trend line due to high frequency trading firms, due to day traders and"
"13109450","13112590"," retail traders and software programs."
"13112950","13116470"," Everybody's on high frequency trading right now in one form or another."
"13116970","13119030"," What you've now seen is this line is gone. "
"13120070","13120550"," Right?"
"13120810","13122950"," Oh, I'm going to delete this right here."
"13126010","13126830"," Back to this."
"13127470","13127710"," Right?"
"13127970","13132610"," Or I should say that line is gone, but instead of that trend line being respected, you're seeing"
"13132610","13133690"," movements like this. "
"13134310","13134510"," Okay?"
"13136290","13139050"," Just like this as we go up."
"13139830","13150310"," And what you're doing when you're doing this is by the time you get to the end of that value,"
"13150310","13154830"," the intrinsic value of your option, your call option has been destroyed."
"13155570","13157610"," Whereas there was still intrinsic value up here. "
"13158070","13159230"," It's been wrecked in here."
"13159390","13166150"," And who's wrecked this is high frequency trading firms, day traders, the pack, right?"
"13166410","13167810"," The pack just day trading every day."
"13167950","13168410"," That's what's happened. "
"13168950","13172190"," Now what's really crazy is that applies as well on the downward side."
"13173190","13173770"," The same thing."
"13173910","13176150"," You just have a nice beautiful flow as we head down. "
"13176150","13179390"," And now we've got these jagged moves heading down as well."
"13179670","13183690"," As a matter of fact, what you really see more frequently in the downside now is you see a lot"
"13183690","13184210"," more waiting."
"13184670","13189530"," We used to talk about the elevator down when we go negative on the market. "
"13189830","13194610"," And if you pay attention closely on the put side of things, there's two issues in the put side of"
"13194610","13194850"," things."
"13195330","13199370"," And that is puts right now only pay 100%."
"13199370","13201910"," They're one to one or they're priced one to one. "
"13201910","13207290"," So the big problem for a put holder is that big problem for a put holder right now is that"
"13207290","13210450"," if it doesn't go your way, it's one for one, right?"
"13210550","13212250"," You're paying a dollar to make a dollar."
"13212450","13214190"," That's not the case on calls."
"13215150","13221670"," Now we used to see on puts would be you'd see like a peak an all-time high hit, and"
"13221670","13222550"," we'd trade down, right?"
"13223570","13224450"," We'd start to trade down. "
"13224570","13225110"," It was pretty simple."
"13225490","13227090"," It was usually pretty steep, right?"
"13227270","13228310"," You'd steeply trade off."
"13228870","13232130"," These days you'll see us hit a peak trade sideways for five days. "
"13232850","13236170"," You have to time it properly, staircase down."
"13236550","13240090"," You're good for the move only because then we start to trade sideways again."
"13240670","13242870"," And then you get this staircase down, right?"
"13243110","13244670"," And then we're trading sideways for a little bit. "
"13244850","13245850"," And then it's a staircase down."
"13246150","13247970"," So you kind of getting fucked in the put side too."
"13248630","13258570"," So the point I'm trying to draw for you around all this is that after all that movement,"
"13258570","13261070"," let's say you had that movement that was shaky, right?"
"13261690","13264250"," Now that you've added this into it, right?"
"13265550","13270310"," Instead of this going, continuing to go up, now you've added in this to it, right?"
"13270730","13273850"," And you're adding this violent behavior as we head down. "
"13274470","13276350"," I'm sure you guys have noticed it out there."
"13276470","13277710"," Then this happens, right?"
"13278370","13280370"," And it's violent behavior at the same time."
"13280790","13282110"," And then this happens, right?"
"13282630","13282970"," The lower. "
"13283430","13284770"," And we still have violent behavior."
"13284770","13287090"," Or we even have, we don't even have this right here."
"13287230","13290910"," We've got, we actually have stuff like this, which is this more nonsense. "
"13291090","13295870"," You're going to have in this violent move down, trading sideways, burning your puts, right?"
"13296010","13300890"," And when your time in this area here is exposing you to risk, then we have a violent drop down"
"13300890","13302550"," in an overnight and then we're trading sideways."
"13303130","13309170"," And what is all this lead up to is that you either have to, you either have to be taking"
"13309170","13312770"," put spreads above that once they print, you get out of them."
"13313410","13316550"," Or it means that you have to wait until we're up here. "
"13316710","13318990"," You can't, you can't just buy a put spread here."
"13319670","13322670"," Or not a put spread, but just naked calls, I guess, right?"
"13322870","13327750"," Short naked calls so that they eventually print down here because all of the intrinsic value has"
"13327750","13328510"," been ripped out of them."
"13329170","13332990"," So the point that I would make with you is you either are waiting for the top up tops up"
"13332990","13337730"," here to take a put spread or you're going to have to get your hands dirty and your elbows burned"
"13337730","13342590"," up and you have to find a way to time these moves down, time these moves up. "
"13342590","13345050"," And get in them only for the length of the move."
"13345570","13351770"," So you don't want to be like taking puts down here anymore to 450s, like for today, right?"
"13351990","13352810"," Because you have to move higher."
"13353670","13358170"," You have to actually sell them down below and wait for the next moment that you can take a move"
"13358170","13358490"," down. "
"13358810","13365510"," Either at 457 or at 4, 459 or again at 469 up here."
"13366490","13368770"," And you kind of have to, you know, I know you guys know this."
"13368770","13373410"," You can see that more frequently than in the past, you have to enter. "
"13374030","13380130"," Let's say you enter here at 60 cents, then you have to enter here at 30 cents, then you have"
"13380130","13385130"," to enter here at 10 cents so that you can get a nice 30 cent put that you can trade"
"13385130","13386970"," down when the move to actually happens."
"13387950","13392250"," So I don't know what to say to you if you're a swing trader or if you're a, and that's"
"13392250","13398690"," on bull and bear sides of it's not really working out well for that kind of a trader or even"
"13398690","13399770"," an investor right now."
"13401290","13402110"," Does that make sense?"
"13406090","13409050"," You guys all understanding this better than before, hopefully?"
"13411990","13413410"," Yeah, it used to be bad. "
"13413650","13418730"," I mean, so when I started trading, you could take a trade in any direction, right?"
"13418810","13423770"," If you knew we were going down, you could take a trade and you put a month on it, three"
"13423770","13425430"," months on it or whatever in any direction."
"13425430","13430110"," If you knew you were to top and you put a three months or a month on a downward swing"
"13430110","13434910"," in the spy, you could check back on that fucking thing in two, three weeks and you'd be like, Oh,"
"13435250","13435950"," look, it printed."
"13436830","13439330"," There's there's an old saying about spy, right?"
"13439570","13441850"," Just by calls and they'll print eventually. "
"13442330","13443870"," That's not a new saying."
"13443870","13450370"," That's an old school saying prior to 2020 where you could just buy the index at a bottom, a"
"13450370","13452430"," localized bottom and you knew that you were going up."
"13452890","13458450"," Now that worked in 2020 amplified, but in 2021, it changed. "
"13458450","13465230"," Things changed in the spring, I want to say, late winter, spring of 2021, where everything has"
"13465230","13465930"," become amplified."
"13466350","13470910"," And now we have amplification upon amplification in this market."
"13471130","13476410"," I've even noticed it more recently when I'm taking calls or puts yesterday. "
"13476710","13480630"," I took some puts on some downward moves and I did them three times."
"13480990","13486430"," The first time I was up like 20, 30% or something."
"13486430","13490830"," The first downward move, I was up 20, 30% and went back to even in seconds. "
"13491190","13492090"," It was like a half a minute."
"13492850","13493690"," I was like, got out of those."
"13493890","13494530"," I think I broke. "
"13494710","13498350"," I broke positive by like one or two percent second set."
"13498690","13500830"," I had the moment I hit like 20%."
"13500830","13501790"," I sold them. "
"13501950","13503610"," And sure enough, we came back up."
"13504270","13507190"," Then I had to do it again the third time and it was the same result, right?"
"13507310","13510110"," I had to be in, take my money and run."
"13511270","13514550"," And I think that you're going to find this over at least into Friday. "
"13514550","13518070"," You're going to find this to be specifically taking place in the market."
"13518810","13525170"," And I think it could extend into Tuesday of next week and further on a grander scale into at least"
"13525170","13525810"," February and March."
"13526650","13530770"," So I don't want to say if you want to be a swing trader right now, it's a challenge to"
"13530770","13531230"," say the least. "
"13531390","13534790"," As a matter of fact, I'm in a whole slew of calls here."
"13536010","13538290"," And I'm up on some of them."
"13538470","13540730"," I'm still slightly down on some of them. "
"13541170","13545330"," So, you know, it's not like I'm sitting in calls right now and I shouldn't be."
"13545810","13549790"," And I'm still sitting in them and they're not, they're not nearly printing as much as they should."
"13549950","13551410"," I bought that dip in 450. "
"13552490","13553150"," I'm okay."
"13553670","13554410"," I'm up a little bit."
"13555070","13556430"," But I'm not up a shit though. "
"13556530","13560650"," I'm up a 45% on some of them."
"13561750","13563010"," But, you know, it's hard."
"13563390","13565630"," I should be up more with that violent of a reaction. "
"13566310","13569670"," You should see more people coming into the market raising."
"13569670","13575130"," Raising the value of the premium of these of these calls that I bought."
"13575350","13576430"," And it's just not there. "
"13577010","13578910"," It's just a day trader's market right now."
"13584940","13587160"," Yeah, this is a what's my poison?"
"13587680","13588960"," My poison is bourbon."
"13591020","13592020"," You come got murdered. "
"13594400","13595760"," Yeah, it's real high right now."
"13595860","13600720"," You got this is going to make the one of the one of the background reasons why I made this"
"13600720","13603280"," channel was because we've talked about this."
"13603280","13612360"," Is because there was a rise of meme type YouTube channels a rise of"
"13612360","13614160"," just by the dip. "
"13614160","13616220"," Just just all you have to do is buy, right?"
"13616380","13617940"," You can you can say whatever the fuck you want eventually."
"13617940","13621760"," It's going to go green, especially if you're if you're a meme, especially if you're a YouTube"
"13621760","13623680"," pumper and you're talking about just buying stock."
"13624120","13628020"," If you're like, Hey, we're just going to buy this shit stock or it's not really a shit stock. "
"13628020","13635180"," But it has more to do with free money with or it has more to do with rates interest rates."
"13635500","13637240"," But we'll get into that conversation the other time."
"13638180","13642680"," But basically anything any kind of any kind of speculative growth company had free money, right?"
"13643000","13643620"," You did. "
"13643840","13646500"," Of course, you're going to have a high PEs."
"13646700","13649420"," Of course, you're going to these companies are going to get money."
"13649960","13651000"," That's the that's what we do. "
"13651840","13657140"," When you have free money in our system, it's intended to be given to growth companies."
"13657680","13661620"," To in turn turn that money into money to pay the banks that loaned them."
"13662280","13664140"," This is a long complicated thing, but whatever. "
"13666160","13669040"," But you know, there was a there was a rise of these YouTube channels."
"13671100","13672320"," And they were good."
"13672440","13673260"," They made people a lot of money. "
"13673760","13675340"," But then we saw 2021 pass."
"13676480","13679640"," And you saw a lot of these speculative growth stocks get destroyed."
"13680740","13684120"," And you watch these channels kind of fumble throughout the year, right?"
"13685100","13689260"," And all of a sudden, I remember two years ago, people stopped trading the spy. "
"13689600","13694860"," I remember when I remember exactly when it used to be on Wall Street bets and everything was about"
"13694860","13695160"," the spy."
"13695540","13698420"," And then all of a sudden the spy just went away as a topic of conversation."
"13699300","13702980"," And then recently at the end of 2021, I noticed some Wall Street bets. "
"13703760","13705320"," Spy came back into the conversation again."
"13706380","13711120"," And the reality is that you're going to have to if you're going to be an investor in this market,"
"13711120","13717260"," a trader in this market, up or down, you have to make the shift back to pre 2020."
"13718580","13723640"," And in reality, it's going to be the spy for you as a trader where you're going to find your"
"13723640","13724260"," most success. "
"13725040","13729460"," And if you honestly, if you're retail trader out there, if you want to survive, either a bull or"
"13729460","13730360"," bear does not matter."
"13731240","13732620"," It's going to get harder to trade."
"13732840","13733740"," It's going to get harder to invest. "
"13734280","13736280"," You're going to have to be an actor active investor."
"13736280","13740960"," You're going to have to be an active bear and active bull in this market."
"13741340","13744780"," And for you to survive, it's only going to get harder these upcoming years. "
"13745140","13745940"," And that's the truth."
"13746580","13751720"," If the moment that you accept that truth, things are going to get easier for you as we move"
"13751720","13752100"," forward."
"13753220","13755260"," Because the days of free money are over. "
"13755540","13756600"," Or for right now, they're over."
"13756780","13760100"," Unless something else happens, the days of free money are over for right now."
"13760580","13762200"," At least for the foreseeable future. "
"13762340","13764560"," I'd expect it to be anywhere from three to five years."
"13765060","13767280"," And so you have to become a better trader."
"13767540","13772760"," And so that's why I ultimately made the channel was that for you guys to survive in this"
"13772760","13775080"," environment, you have to be quick. "
"13775300","13776360"," You have to be able to adjust."
"13776820","13781160"," There'll be times in this market where it's a buyer's market where you can just set it and forget"
"13781160","13781380"," it."
"13781840","13785860"," But for right now, this market's going to get hard into the rest of this year. "
"13789480","13790260"," Yeah, Cucum."
"13791840","13793020"," This is all true."
"13793480","13795420"," This is what I'm telling you, this is not an opinion. "
"13795420","13798580"," This is 100 fucking percent true."
"13799060","13803940"," If anyone tells you otherwise out there, they are full-blown lying to you."
"13804380","13805820"," Full-blown liars. "
"13806040","13808800"," I'll call them out all day long, anywhere in the stock market."
"13809440","13810200"," I've seen it."
"13810420","13811740"," I stopped in and watched. "
"13811860","13812720"," I'm not going to name names."
"13813340","13815880"," But I've stopped in to watch some videos from some of these guys."
"13816280","13817220"," And they did a great job, right?"
"13817660","13819120"," These guys did a great job in 2020. "
"13819320","13821200"," They did a great job in somewhat in 2021."
"13821200","13828320"," But you can see now how do they transition from flashy trading to, this is how you actually make"
"13828320","13829460"," money in the stock market."
"13829780","13834960"," Watch one guy's video last week telling his followers, like 50 million followers, right?"
"13835360","13839800"," He's telling them to take a leap of faith on some shit stocks. "
"13840600","13842220"," And I'm shaking my head going."
"13842460","13843600"," You got to be fucking kidding me."
"13843940","13848980"," You really can't take a leap of faith right now on most speculative growth stocks. "
"13849480","13851060"," There's a bottom coming for them."
"13851600","13854180"," But if we go from four to seven rates, right?"
"13854320","13857420"," If we go from four to seven rates, there's some shit you haven't seen."
"13857860","13861620"," Like you're going to see some of these companies just roll up the sidewalk, right?"
"13862340","13862680"," Gone. "
"13863240","13864660"," You'll see some of them get absorbed."
"13865340","13867780"," You'll see some of them be just like Nikola."
"13868160","13870300"," You'll see them where the badge is worth buying. "
"13870740","13874360"," They get sucked into a larger company and then that badge disappears forever."
"13875040","13876080"," And you will see that."
"13876160","13877680"," You will see mergers and acquisitions. "
"13878500","13880180"," We saw it back in 2007."
"13880960","13884500"," You will see it again in this next two to three years."
"13884900","13886180"," You're going to see companies just begun. "
"13886700","13888640"," You're going to see companies trade down to two dollars."
"13889120","13892860"," You're going to see them go on the probation on the S&P 500 and get delisted."
"13893300","13895120"," That is going to happen. "
"13895900","13897600"," That is not an opinion."
"13898180","13899020"," It's going to happen."
"13899420","13900280"," There's no doubt about it. "
"13906290","13906590"," Yeah."
"13906950","13908230"," So it's not that we can't make money."
"13908370","13909510"," We'll make money on meme stocks. "
"13909870","13911090"," We'll make money on Viacom's."
"13911790","13915590"," There's some of those stocks we'll get absorbed and you'll get a pay day off of them."
"13916050","13918890"," Some of these, you'll see some of these companies like PayPal recover. "
"13919490","13924450"," Square, even if it doesn't recover, would be bought by a company, the stock price to go to the"
"13924450","13924650"," moon."
"13925770","13928270"," Just like the Activision Microsoft deal."
"13930270","13931550"," Activision Microsoft deal. "
"13932030","13933770"," You'll see these acquisitions take place."
"13933970","13934470"," You'll get paid."
"13935050","13937810"," There are the right companies to still follow and track them from the bottom. "
"13937810","13942930"," But to think that trading is going to get any easier at this point is just a misnomer."
"13943350","13944110"," It just is."
"13945070","13946270"," So stick around. "
"13946630","13948650"," Paper trade it if it's too dangerous for you right now."
"13949390","13952350"," You don't have to be actively trading every single day of the week."
"13952690","13953890"," You just paper trade this stuff. "
"13954550","13955910"," You can wait for moments."
"13956190","13960630"," If you want to be a bear, you do have to wait for a higher price."
"13960830","13963130"," You might not even catch the next leg down. "
"13963330","13967130"," But the truth is, if you want to hold a trade for one to three weeks, I'm sorry."
"13967130","13968390"," You got to wait for 469."
"13970010","13975170"," Roughly that because we could hit that easily from now until Tuesday. "
"13975490","13976530"," We could easily go up to 470."
"13977090","13978150"," Definitely on the table."
"13978910","13985990"," There's probably a 35 to 40% chance we hit 469 someday this week. "
"13986330","13990430"," Even if we're trading down to 428, which is fucking wild, right?"
"13990810","13994510"," Completely fucking wild that we can trade that high and trade down to 428."
"13995850","14003010"," The fact that the expansion of volatility and the expansion of trading zones here, it's wild."
"14008350","14010470"," Yeah, this is the truth. "
"14010470","14011950"," This is the true cap right here."
"14012390","14016290"," This is not the screaming and yelling cap, but this is the hard truth cap."
"14016550","14017930"," This is the hard truth. "
"14019010","14024430"," If you want to be a bull and just wait for a bottom to buy, then just check back in"
"14024430","14027470"," February, March and April, because that's when you're going to find your bottom."
"14027950","14029770"," That's when you can actually take along in this market."
"14031330","14036630"," Unless we hit 400, if we hit 400 this week, sure. "
"14036850","14038670"," Okay, you can buy a bottom more than likely."
"14039510","14042750"," But we're looking for like 420s, 400s."
"14043030","14044530"," That's what the whole market's looking for. "
"14045170","14046670"," Whole market's looking for a reset."
"14047330","14051270"," They want the indexes to match up to the stocks that have been sold off."
"14051950","14059110"," Bulls don't feel confident to take along buying a bottom or buying a stock until that happens. "
"14060250","14062570"," Not with confidence where you can set it and forget it."
"14063270","14064750"," We just don't have that right now."
"14065550","14066950"," I do think we trade much higher. "
"14067330","14071470"," I think we trade up on the end of the year in the green, I think, by ends green this"
"14071470","14071690"," year."
"14072690","14078630"," But most of these past years, past 20 years, even on a sideways trading, even if we have a sideways"
"14078630","14082030"," or a slightly red year, there's still a bottom that you can buy."
"14082390","14083710"," But it just isn't at this moment. "
"14085890","14086210"," All right."
"14086630","14089550"," When I let you guys go here for a little bit, I'm going to get back to some work."
"14092190","14094390"," It's telling me, you know, it's tough. "
"14094710","14097270"," Time is a hard thing to put on."
"14097950","14098890"," When do we get there?"
"14099030","14099870"," How long does it take?"
"14100070","14100830"," It could happen faster."
"14101730","14102450"," It could take longer. "
"14103410","14107270"," Sometimes it takes until July and June, which sucks, right?"
"14107490","14109350"," Sometimes it's June that you're waiting."
"14111690","14112950"," But there will be a point."
"14113310","14114830"," There's going to be a point where you're going to see. "
"14116470","14118050"," We're going to look around and say, what are we buying?"
"14119730","14121210"," We're waiting for that moment right now."
"14121370","14127770"," It's definitely not here at 4.57. It's not at 4.69. We're not doing 5.50 right now."
"14129510","14130970"," It's just not even the time of season. "
"14131450","14132730"," Seasonally, it's not even that time right."
"14133170","14133970"," Just yet to be doing that."
"14135390","14136950"," Unless you're buying calls for June. "
"14137390","14139290"," You want to buy some calls for June or some leaps?"
"14139890","14141410"," Sure, you could probably buy here and be fine."
"14142950","14145210"," And we post those all the time on this channel."
"14145450","14148870"," But, you know, who are, excuse me, who is buying that stuff?"
"14150210","14152170"," You saw some call hedges come in this morning. "
"14153490","14154970"," You could take those longs into June."
"14155230","14156530"," That seems confident."
"14157150","14158050"," You'd be confident in those. "
"14158390","14159270"," Banks are believing in those."
"14159710","14163110"," Right now, next price target above right now at this current."
"14163710","14169170"," At this moment, it looks like it was 4.59. Looks like some of those sellers are disappearing at"
"14169170","14169530"," this point. "
"14170350","14171590"," So I'm going to expect a trade higher."
"14172450","14180290"," Possibly to talk about that 4.59. 4.60. We might even trade higher into tomorrow."
"14180810","14184530"," If we don't trade higher in tomorrow today, we could trade sideways the rest of today. "
"14185070","14187510"," I would expect us to, yeah, here's the sellers right here."
"14188430","14190190"," 4.58. 65."
"14191190","14195150"," Even if we trade sideways the rest of today, if we trade, let's say we sell here, pick it back"
"14195150","14201490"," up at 4.53. Then those buyers are moving up from 4.50. You can see them moving up now"
"14201490","14208110"," from 4.50 to 4.53. Even if we just trade inside this zone here, I'd be careful about being"
"14208110","14208990"," bearish on Thursday. "
"14210050","14214630"," It seems like we should, we sell down into Thursday, open on OpEx on quad or whichings."
"14214630","14217790"," Then we rip into clothes on that Thursday."
"14217950","14218550"," I have OpEx. "
"14219710","14221950"," All right, I'll check back with you guys in a little bit."
"14223030","14231910"," Notice that the support has raised itself from 4.50 to 4.53. Notice that there's a buy program on."
"14234150","14238170"," And we'll look at the hero indicator and see if it's come down again. "
"14241560","14247060"," A little bit of weakness back here at 12.30. And down to those middle of the afternoon doldrums."
"14253730","14254630"," Good luck, guys."
"14256790","14258270"," Yeah, tread lightly out there. "
"14260370","14261830"," Tread lightly out there."
"14263350","14265070"," Why not short into OpEx?"
"14265250","14265590"," I don't know."
"14265950","14267830"," Go back to all the OpExs and see what happens. "
"14269150","14271270"," There's like a famous saying about OpEx."
"14272490","14273610"," That's not true."
"14274350","14279230"," There's a famous saying that the Thursday before OpEx, we usually rip to new highs. "
"14280030","14283550"," I want you to go back and look at Thursdays before OpEx."
"14285410","14288470"," And then you can answer that your own question on that."
"14288790","14290450"," I don't think that happens this year. "
"14290970","14292950"," Excuse me, I don't think that happens in this OpEx."
"14293610","14297090"," But that threat is on the table without a doubt."
"14297790","14298290"," It's on the table. "
"14299410","14301430"," I agree with you that we're probably going to sell off."
"14301950","14304890"," But to say that we don't trade up on OpEx, that's a misnomer."
"14305210","14306670"," That's not even close to true. "
"14306670","14309630"," We actually trade up the Thursday before OpEx."
"14310230","14311290"," Almost every OpEx."
"14322340","14324660"," It's hilarious to have got hood calls printing. "
"14325560","14345990"," I cannot believe"
"14345990","14347670"," that I made money on hood calls."
"14348050","14349410"," That's my first time buying hood."
"14350710","14352190"," I bought the hood dip. "
"14353030","14355270"," Laughing my fucking ass off on that shit."
"14357570","14359810"," I can't believe I bought hood calls."
"14360650","14362910"," Too fucking funny. "
"14389440","14392660"," I bought the 14.5 C's."
"14393900","14398600"," Spiring on January 21st."
"14398600","14399360"," On hood. "
"14400560","14401200"," Hilarious."
"14402260","14403980"," Making money off Robin Hood."
"14404820","14406120"," Thank you fucking Robin Hood. "
"14406360","14409560"," I used Robin Hood when it first came out to try it out."
"14409700","14413360"," And I got hella fucked by Robin Hood many times."
"14413360","14417380"," Like bent over and fucked by Robin Hood. "
"14417920","14419980"," That's nice to see making money off Robin Hood."
"14438870","14440290"," Too fucking funny."
"14474670","14477370"," That was me that just sold Robin Hood if you want to know. "
"14526930","14528190"," Holy shit, Joe."
"14529110","14530690"," Viacom's still going up, brother."
"14531970","14533810"," I should have taken the Viacom trade. "
"14536030","14539270"," I might have to re-enter that Viacom trade, my man."
"14540950","14546510"," Viacom didn't have that violent quick dump that Robin Hood just had."
"18306810","18311610"," If we can get a break below here, 55367 would be the target. "
"18312590","18316590"," You want to see a break below 45619?"
"18331430","18332890"," You guys can hear me now, right?"
"18333650","18338190"," So if you're going to take this so that we did reject off 458 or 459 up there."
"18338190","18341350"," We did bounce into some level of support over here."
"18342130","18344850"," You're waiting to pick up another short here. "
"18345530","18348250"," Looks like there's some more buyers stepping in again here."
"18349070","18354050"," If you want to take it down again to the next level, look for a break below 45620."
"18355190","18357270"," Okay, so you get your out of your short now. "
"18357370","18361510"," You're waiting for this level here to be broken."
"18362050","18363950"," Take it down to 453."
"18364990","18366150"," That's only if it breaks. "
"18368800","18371920"," You take it down to, let's look at it again."
"18375880","18376780"," Let's firm it up here."
"18377700","18378260"," Where's that?"
"18379660","18380540"," Right here. "
"18380660","18381660"," You can see it right there."
"18382360","18387120"," A little bit more support at 45323."
"18388640","18393480"," Really the next, if we break here, you want to take it down to 45350. "
"18394540","18396940"," Now, that doesn't mean we break here either."
"18397560","18401220"," You can see that we are encountering buyers stepping in."
"18401320","18404660"," You can see here this point here and this point here. "
"18405100","18406580"," You do have buyers stepping in."
"18407740","18409780"," So you should be out of your puts at this point."
"18410340","18414460"," You look to pick them back up only if we break below 45620. "
"18420120","18422420"," Otherwise, it's the bull's ball right now."
"18423060","18428340"," And if you want to take this long, you're going to look for picking it up over 4692."
"18443440","18446240"," And there's not much flow coming in on either side. "
"18447380","18449840"," I did see some TQQQ."
"18450180","18451540"," Can I say that four times?"
"18453700","18458660"," TQQQ calls come in February 25th."
"18459760","18464780"," 64C saw those come in at 1.32 PM. "
"18466520","18471120"," And then I saw some spy calls come in at 1.31 or so."
"18471120","18472040"," A bunch of spy calls."
"18473880","18477220"," So that was 15 minutes ago or so. "
"18477880","18480700"," I just saw some new spy calls come in just now."
"18481020","18485860"," Spy 119, 458, $91,000."
"18486900","18489120"," So let's see if this holds and breaks higher. "
"18508890","18511630"," This is what Mr. Yen would call diddling in the middle."
"18512210","18513210"," Not a good thing to be doing."
"18522300","18523960"," Yeah, I just saw Winky's comment. "
"18523960","18524680"," He's correct."
"18525300","18526640"," No diddling in the middle."
"18527440","18530580"," Oh, we'll look at Tesla for Tesla, Jess. "
"18531140","18531620"," Tesla."
"18533100","18539460"," We'll check out Tesla because I know he likes to see Tesla and see what's going on with Tesla."
"18542320","18543780"," We'll let that load up in the background. "
"18595700","18597760"," Yeah, I think Hutch is a diddler too."
"18598680","18633080"," Yeah, so"
"18633080","18635380"," Tesla's just kind of floating around out there too, right?"
"18635520","18636840"," Tesla's just kind of in the middle here."
"18637200","18639840"," It's kind of a danger zone for bull ant bulls and bears. "
"18640440","18642880"," If you took the trade at 1,000, you're good to go."
"18643400","18645140"," I guess right to a point you're good to go."
"18645460","18647460"," You could take this a little bit of stalling here. "
"18648360","18650000"," The price target above is 1024."
"18650520","18651560"," Wait a minute, I get that wrong."
"18652100","18654840"," A little bit of resistance at 1024. "
"18657040","18659460"," Kind of like no man's land here for Tesla right now."
"18660200","18663140"," If you want to stay long on Tesla."
"18665720","18668840"," There's a lot of puts on Tesla right now just as a heads up. "
"18676920","18679320"," I'm more resistance above a 1048."
"18690490","18692890"," Some pretty decent resistance at 1048."
"18694850","18696250"," 1070, lots of sellers. "
"18696790","18699130"," Assuming these are panic sellers, we're heading to no pecs."
"18700350","18703310"," People in the money calls want to get out."
"18703310","18705130"," You do have more sell more buyers than sellers. "
"18705130","18706490"," It's a positive accumulation."
"18707270","18709430"," If I had to guess on this trade for."
"18710890","18720370"," I had to guess for this trade on Tesla that the assumption is that bulls feel like they can buy"
"18720370","18728290"," this bottom down here for a rip on Thursday or Friday or even Monday Tuesday into February 1st. "
"18728290","18732230"," We've done it so many times in the past where we've ripped into the next month."
"18733110","18739090"," That bull still haven't given up hope that we're going to trade up into ER as we're going to trade"
"18739090","18740510"," up into OPEX."
"18741390","18745050"," How about I do want to keep you in mind that we do have the Fed, right?"
"18745850","18748350"," We get the Fed coming up next week, I think. "
"18749210","18752290"," At some point, so that does lend some volatility into the mix."
"18753010","18755290"," Quad-witching, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
"18756310","18757570"," Calls rolling off. "
"18822770","18829510"," Nice firm bounce at that 4.56.20. They're like, fuck, no, you're not taking that right now."
"18830590","18831970"," Like, almost to the pin, right?"
"18832170","18833050"," How to be close to the pin?"
"18834450","18842210"," Was this 4.66. 4.56.12. It looks like someone grabbed at 4.56.12 or so."
"18844410","18846370"," Just swooped right in, get bought. "
"18847990","18848570"," Okay."
"20926720","20935140"," All right, just a note to keep this mark that we talked about earlier, 4.53.37. You also see"
"20935140","20943100"," some new buyers stepping in at 4.50.20. This support here is not as strong as it seems."
"20943260","20950100"," It might still, it might work at 4.53.22. But noticing that we have new found buyers stepping in"
"20950100","20951080"," at 4.50 again. "
"20952120","20956740"," So I'll leave this up here so you can pay attention to both of these marks."
"22171780","22174640"," All right, I'll be coming on live here soon at the 3 o'clock hour."
"22175400","22181520"," Looks like we got a nice bounce down at 4.54.25. We'll be taking a look as to what"
"22181520","22183940"," the plan is heading into tomorrow. "
"22710620","22712620"," All right, just about to get back on here."
"22715420","22716300"," Well, that sucked."
"22716560","22718460"," I just got done looking at a disclaimer. "
"22720380","22721480"," That's put on the website."
"22724660","22726340"," Attorneys do not fuck around."
"22733460","22737040"," We got another second little bounce here today on the spy. "
"22738100","22739460"," If you guys have anything."
"22740120","22745440"," If you guys have anything that you want me to look up any tickers, I'm going to check out."
"22746360","22748040"," Don't spam them to give me just one. "
"22749060","22750320"," And I'll take a look at whatever you got."
"22752240","22755360"," Let's squish this down a little bit and see just take a quick view on the day."
"22757320","22762500"," So in previous, what do we do?"
"22762620","22765580"," We trade down overnight and then we rip higher for a day. "
"22765580","22767680"," Trade back down, rip higher for a day."
"22768180","22770620"," And then once all the calls and putts are out of the way."
"22772520","22775140"," There's a decision as to which direction we're headed, right?"
"22775960","22781600"," So all the interest expires between now and Friday. "
"22782480","22785560"," It also expires on Monday as well, right?"
"22785740","22790000"," So we've got a lot of interest expiring today, Friday, Monday."
"22790720","22794700"," And the implication is where do we go from there?"
"22795580","22796580"," That's the big question."
"22799320","22803520"," Previous OPEX is we have headed higher. "
"22804560","22814260"," And once all of the put flow and all of the hedging rolls off, we tend to roll higher."
"22815020","22819700"," And the question this time around, right?"
"22819900","22820800"," This time it's different."
"22821140","22822220"," That's what everybody likes to say. "
"22824700","22827300"," Is do we head higher this time?"
"22828160","22830180"," Or do we get the wall of hedging inputs?"
"22830620","22840210"," We've seen the hedging, the put flow hedging coming in, heading into these OPEXes."
"22840470","22845370"," We know that the last two years, early since April or May, we've had some down times."
"22845390","22847450"," We had a summer that we were down at leaving 2020. "
"22849170","22851270"," It was kind of, I think it was an early summer."
"22851450","22852630"," I don't know if it was 2020 or 2021."
"22853670","22861710"," But since 2020, basically, you can look forward to green skies, birds, chirping, free money flow. "
"22862330","22863890"," We have some events coming up, right?"
"22864110","22868910"," We have the Fed meeting on the 26th."
"22868910","22877650"," You've got Jamie Diamond out there pissing around, saying we're, we took expect seven rate hikes"
"22877650","22879070"," this year."
"22879250","22883930"," Everybody else is saying three, four rate hikes this year. "
"22884670","22890470"," The rates are, or the market is pricing in right now, three to four rate hikes."
"22892230","22901970"," And then someone commented to me that JPM is, they're outlook is"
"22901970","22904530"," not pricing in seven rate hikes, either, right?"
"22905150","22906270"," What's going to take place this year?"
"22907990","22909850"," So the question is, have we priced it in?"
"22910110","22910830"," Do we trade higher?"
"22911090","22917150"," Do we trade like we have in the past where green skies and bluebirds above?"
"22921860","22923860"," And that's what you kind of have to plan for."
"22924080","22925060"," Okay, so you guys are already posting. "
"22925380","22926260"," Let me go back up a little bit."
"22928880","22931640"," That's, that's what you have to plan for heading into Friday."
"22934620","22935960"," Boy, what's Jill recommending?"
"22939700","22941240"," What did, what did Jill say?"
"22942700","22943400"," I missed what she said. "
"22943500","22943980"," I wasn't watching."
"22947270","22948950"," Markets eating premiums."
"22952570","22953950"," I haven't paying any attention. "
"22954170","22956470"," I've been, I've been looking at, been reviewing some documents."
"22964040","22964820"," Missed some of this."
"22965380","22966620"," Let me know what Jill said. "
"22966680","22967680"," I want to hear what she had to say."
"22967800","22969860"," She said, not a recommendation of financial advice."
"22970460","22970740"," LOL. "
"22979560","22982840"," Yeah, I can't give no advice on what to do with Tesla."
"22984940","22988080"," I can tell you in previous what's happened, right?"
"22988300","22989020"," We'll sell down, right?"
"22989360","22992180"," I can only tell you what's happened in previous months."
"22992540","22995420"," We've traded down into tomorrow. "
"22995420","22996600"," And then we rip higher."
"22996860","23001180"," And I want to, I think, spy ripped like 1.5% or 3% snowpecks."
"23001820","23003500"," I know that there's two things going on. "
"23003660","23004540"," Now you got on Tesla."
"23004880","23010480"," I don't know if you've got, you've got some traders that are looking back and saying, well, we"
"23010480","23011960"," should rip into February."
"23012440","23015080"," Like we always do, coming on a OPEC's. "
"23016240","23019360"," And you just price your calls far enough out and it should rip from 1000."
"23020720","23024040"," You've got other traders that think this is the end, right?"
"23024040","23030880"," So you've had trap seller sell at 12 something and we might not get it."
"23031120","23035720"," Now, the one thing you would consider it with that game plan is that when we did trade down the"
"23035720","23039540"," last time for the rip higher, we traded down to like 890 or something. "
"23039800","23040220"," It was brutal."
"23041260","23042240"," So keep that in mind as well."
"23044160","23044940"," We'll look at Tesla. "
"23046320","23048840"," What do you guys, what are you guys selling me here?"
"23048840","23050800"," Q, Q, Q, Qs, okay."
"23051240","23052200"," Start with the Qs."
"23056820","23062740"," And I'm not seeing much float here today. "
"23063080","23066800"," So all this flow that I'm seeing is like $20,000, $50,000."
"23068780","23075720"," The highest flow right now is, you know, like $145,000, $173,000 on Amazon."
"23076000","23077060"," That's to be expected calls. "
"23078120","23081600"," But it's still not moving calls, for puts."
"23081920","23082660"," It's all small money."
"23086530","23089150"," That's what we'll do, QQQ's, it's loading right now. "
"23091770","23096450"," We'll come back to spy, it seems like I'm having a couple of shitty connections to the internet."
"23097410","23101290"," I wonder if I'm getting throttled again for my provider, I keep having to call them and asking"
"23101290","23101550"," them."
"23103190","23108270"," It's kind of like you ask a kid, did you turn the heat up, did you turn the heat down?"
"23109110","23112310"," The kid says no, and that's basically what my dad used to ask me that. "
"23112870","23113550"," Of course not, dad."
"23114710","23115990"," This will look at QQ's."
"23121070","23123250"," My thought is that we're going down. "
"23123450","23124450"," Everybody knows we're going down."
"23124670","23127170"," I don't think you can play the contrary and play into this OPEX."
"23128690","23131530"," I think it's, we should trade down. "
"23131950","23133030"," That's my thesis."
"23133250","23134170"," I think that's everybody's thesis."
"23135830","23143870"," But I think I'll still take a straddle into this trade, so I'm going to be long and short into"
"23143870","23149130"," Monday, Wednesday on both sides for a bigger move. "
"23149270","23150330"," I think there's a large move."
"23150810","23151770"," I don't know which way it is."
"23151910","23152770"," I don't know if it's up or down. "
"23152890","23157030"," Nobody can tell you that it's going to be up or down, but I don't think it's going to be"
"23157030","23159310"," sideways after Monday."
"23160370","23163830"," I think by Wednesday you'll see a nasty move in either direction."
"23165910","23173130"," If you have some big support down here at 360 on QQQ's, you're sitting on big support right now, 3 "
"23173130","23182690",".69. My only reason for wanting to do a straddle too is because it"
"23182690","23185610"," could trigger some really nasty stuff, right?"
"23186430","23191210"," You guys, you start trading down from here and it's very dangerous to the market. "
"23192390","23193750"," They're pretty low right now."
"23193830","23197110"," So whenever that happens, I don't think that we're going to, I don't think we're going to trade"
"23197110","23198610"," down like 10 points or 5 points."
"23198610","23200450"," I think we're going to move down big. "
"23200950","23207590"," You'll start to trigger selling from large banks and mid-sized hedgehounds stuff like that."
"23209110","23210990"," So I'm going to take both sides of the trade again."
"23211590","23214730"," It's funny how recently that's what we've been doing, taking both sides of the trade. "
"23217110","23218190"," So here goes the QQQ's."
"23218270","23219210"," I can't tell you much on this."
"23219790","23222070"," You're sailing or your call wall is above a 380. "
"23222750","23224590"," You got green sky or blue skies above."
"23224590","23229250"," This infers that nobody is buying calls here, like literally nobody."
"23229870","23231710"," Everybody wants in on puts. "
"23232070","23233130"," Everybody wants in on shorts."
"23233890","23236790"," Everybody knows that tech is going down in a ball of flames."
"23237030","23237770"," That's all this says. "
"23238370","23239510"," I don't know what else to tell you on this."
"23240410","23242770"," There's lots of accumulation here in this area."
"23246280","23250380"," There does come a point in the market where you want that good flush. "
"23250840","23255560"," People want the flush as a bold you feel confident that we're going up here maybe, but I don't"
"23255560","23258440"," think that most of the market believes are going up from here."
"23259300","23260380"," So you keep that in context."
"23262440","23264200"," Only the Q's are really telling you too much. "
"23270490","23271890"," You heard my take on Tesla."
"23274310","23282170"," So if you look at previous history on Tesla, even if it goes up, there is weakness."
"23283050","23287950"," So I guess if you saw strength, maybe we'll show real weakness, not fake weakness. "
"23288930","23290250"," I guess you can apply that."
"23291370","23297770"," But just know that whenever we come in OpEx, even when we trade higher, there is a weakness heading"
"23297770","23298490"," into OpEx."
"23300730","23301830"," Even when we're bullish. "
"23302950","23304750"," Have that same level down here of 1000."
"23305710","23306310"," Same support."
"23307270","23307730"," 1000. "
"23307730","23314170"," As this loads up, we will take a look lower and see how low we could potentially trade."
"23314850","23317910"," We know above, we've got marks at 1100 and 1200."
"23322290","23328590"," And sometimes, unless the news is a stock split for Tesla, unless the news is company X, where"
"23328590","23336850"," you're rolling in Starlink or you're giving the option for stockholders maybe to buy Starlink stock"
"23336850","23338530"," before anybody else, something like that. "
"23339890","23347970"," It doesn't really matter what the, how good the ER is going to be to be honest."
"23349830","23352790"," Because they're going to get forward guidance and they're going to talk about rates going up."
"23354750","23356950"," That's more than likely what you'll hear from people, right?"
"23357950","23362550"," The profits will tighten and they're expected to tighten. "
"23362750","23368510"," No one's going to say out there, I expect my profits to go up for the current situation that we're"
"23368510","23368690"," in."
"23369230","23373290"," I don't even think an attorney would allow anyone to make that expectation right now."
"23374130","23375050"," So you get a thousand bucks. "
"23375430","23376270"," We'll look a little bit lower here."
"23376570","23377630"," See if this will load up."
"23379930","23381670"," So you really need some news. "
"23383410","23386410"," 990.50. I'm saying that news can't come."
"23386590","23393010"," I'm saying that you have to understand what kind of news you actually need for the price to hold."
"23393790","23395090"," So 986 is on the board. "
"23398600","23399480"," See it up here."
"23400120","23401520"," 980, I guess, is even better."
"23402900","23404600"," We have 960 down below. "
"23406740","23409540"," In case we trade down here, mark these on your charts."
"23411000","23411900"," It's even firmed up."
"23412220","23416900"," It's not really, you have to get 969.50. Let's look lower. "
"23424460","23430420"," 949.30. Light support at 925.21. Light support at 920."
"23432240","23434780"," Probably just going to trade down to 900 if we get that low."
"23438200","23441340"," So 900's big support on Tesla. "
"23441660","23441940"," That's a thousand."
"23442080","23442800"," It's a hundred point drop."
"23443000","23443220"," That's big. "
"23444240","23444880"," That's a big drop."
"23445060","23445740"," That's 10% right."
"23446380","23447140"," It's pretty big. "
"23448140","23448440"," Okay."
"23448540","23449360"," We'll check the next one."
"23451440","23452700"," And we're going to look at. "
"23453020","23454520"," Didn't we already look at MSFT FT?"
"23455020","23456880"," You guys asked me to check back on stocks now."
"23457360","23458080"," How's it killing me?"
"23459660","23460140"," Emma."
"23460320","23467240"," If it looks the same as before, I'm going to bypass any of you that texted or chatted repeat"
"23467240","23467960"," tickers. "
"23468540","23469620"," We'll wait and look."
"23472680","23478080"," Watching some calls come in on TQQQ 12867C."
"23478940","23480940"," It's been pretty consistent on the queues. "
"23487100","23489750"," $260,000."
"23489750","23493770"," We have January 21st, 33 and 31C."
"23503400","23507380"," We have big tech, backed and like meme stock bag holders here. "
"23509560","23510980"," You can kind of see it, right?"
"23512180","23513100"," It's the same thing."
"23513280","23515120"," Same thing that happened with speculative growth stocks."
"23516880","23518540"," You'll have big tech bag holders. "
"23520160","23522020"," Just asking for levels."
"23523240","23524080"," Same thing though."
"23524080","23526200"," You can see the same thing on MSFT, right?"
"23527040","23529520"," There's no wall above because there's no calls above. "
"23530260","23532340"," You've got support here supposedly at 300."
"23533420","23535580"," More buyers down below at 290, 295."
"23536980","23537840"," You look lower. "
"23539700","23541160"," And market just doesn't think we're going up."
"23542480","23545280"," Sometimes it's a good country and trade in that trade."
"23545460","23546000"," I just don't know. "
"23546200","23550880"," I've seen most of the country and trades I've lost are in these situations."
"23553100","23556200"," So 300, it might hold a 300, 290, 280."
"23556400","23557180"," I don't see anything below it. "
"23557560","23560440"," It looks like misfits in a better situation than some of big tech."
"23564810","23568490"," 250 is the oh shit moment, I guess."
"23569210","23570950"," 280 is pretty firm support as well. "
"23572850","23576670"," And I would say that Microsoft is better off than other big tech stocks."
"23577050","23584030"," But at the same time, times that I've lost these trades, contrarian trades is always right now in"
"23584030","23593570"," these moments because what happens is the market can't deny the"
"23593570","23594710"," market sentiment."
"23594930","23602470"," The market makers, the banks, at some point the market sentiment just becomes we're selling this. "
"23602590","23603690"," We're selling this thing down."
"23603870","23604830"," I was going to say a swear word."
"23607070","23607970"," Look at PFE. "
"23611590","23614490"," It comes a moment where it's cathartic to a point."
"23615610","23617890"," And that moment should happen here at some point."
"23618390","23619550"," If not today, tomorrow. "
"23620410","23626510"," It should happen anytime now between now and February, March and we're at that moment where this is"
"23626510","23627430"," where it should happen, right?"
"23627970","23628810"," We're down here already."
"23629370","23631110"," Might as well get it taken care of now."
"23631610","23632990"," It's like eating the medicine you don't want to eat. "
"23634250","23644140"," The price I got above on PFE is $59.60. You're just sitting"
"23644140","23646440"," down here with just some cool air breeze."
"23647800","23649700"," Get some buyers down below 50 bucks."
"23650800","23652340"," Kind of just battling it out in here. "
"23652940","23655500"," More buyers and sellers, slightly positive here indicator."
"23656400","23659500"," Overall, it looks pretty healthy relative to some other stocks."
"23666940","23670960"," Looks like some short coverings happening on the spy right now. "
"23671980","23672900"," It's a PFE."
"23673280","23674080"," So far, I'll do."
"23684560","23687900"," Yeah, selling the rips right now is the most profitable thing. "
"23688380","23697450"," Matter of fact, it's been profitable selling the rips for since, basically, or December 28th for 20"
"23697450","23698230"," straight days."
"23699390","23700890"," It's been very profitable selling the rips."
"23701730","23702970"," There's one brief moment. "
"23703230","23705290"," That nice three days there, it went straight up."
"23706210","23707050"," Found software 70."
"23711680","23713320"," It's been basically a month of down. "
"23713320","23715400"," But I don't know if you guys haven't seen it."
"23715500","23718580"," We've had three month periods, five month periods."
"23718720","23719200"," We had one year. "
"23719360","23722580"," We went straight down just down for an entire year."
"23723500","23725920"," So you start asking yourself, you know, we're going to keep going down."
"23726700","23727000"," Where's bottom?"
"23727940","23728380"," So sofy. "
"23729140","23732900"," Your by the dip is looks like a little closer."
"23736510","23740810"," You get some sellers above it's 16, but in reality, this is the ceiling for sofy, 15 bucks."
"23741750","23744230"," 15.05 is the top for sofy. "
"23745790","23747470"," You want to be buying the tip of 12 bucks."
"23756110","23756950"," See what we got."
"23757630","23759310"," Oh, didn't I just say just do one?"
"23759590","23761410"," I will do plug in a firm. "
"23761930","23762230"," Do those."
"23764690","23766770"," So I said one who's asking for two?"
"23767430","23768550"," It's Frotown Alpine."
"23772730","23773170"," Okay. "
"23773430","23774070"," Yeah, firm, right?"
"23775710","23777470"," Then we'll look at a plug."
"23779850","23785110"," We have some calls coming in on spy and the queues."
"23786710","23787550"," TQQ earlier. "
"23787870","23790770"," Now we've got spy and QQQ calls coming in."
"23792230","23795630"," Got a firm bounced enough support."
"23801030","23802530"," Not bad for a firm right here. "
"23802630","23803050"," This is not bad."
"23803050","23804590"," Got a nice support down here."
"23804790","23805930"," 63 bucks, 60 bucks. "
"23806870","23808010"," Price targets 70."
"23808730","23813970"," Heat buyers more are not buyers, but you need calls stepping in outside the money calls above like"
"23813970","23816370"," 80 bucks to go any higher."
"23816370","23818010"," Otherwise you can be trading sideways, I think. "
"23818610","23820450"," Have more sellers than you do have buyers."
"23821810","23823150"," You can buy, you can play this."
"23823250","23824010"," You can play these dips. "
"23825350","23826270"," We'll look a little bit lower."
"23827930","23829870"," I'm going to buy the dipper at 60 bucks."
"23829870","23833450"," Just make sure you get more buyers and sellers right now. "
"23833510","23834110"," You've got more sellers."
"23837050","23838470"," You're sitting on some good support."
"23840330","23841010"," Good to see. "
"23842110","23848310"," The only question I would say would be if you start selling below 59 bucks, 5950, you have to pull"
"23848310","23848750"," the rip cord."
"23851430","23854730"," As you're going to head down to 50 bucks, you've got more sellers right now than buyers."
"23859980","23862080"," Almost looks like rug pull for everybody, doesn't it?"
"23862080","23865860"," Start looking at these tickers and you're like, this all looks like rug pull material. "
"23867280","23872680"," If we were positive right now, there's a reason to be positive right now."
"23873420","23874620"," And all these stocks look like this."
"23875620","23876920"," I would say, man, this is a great setup. "
"23877220","23877860"," I crossed the board."
"23879420","23880580"," This is the setup to go long."
"23883780","23885020"," Same thing unplug, right?"
"23886220","23888180"," Sitting just above 21 bucks, 20 bucks. "
"23889860","23891320"," This all looks like it's going to go up."
"23892140","23894640"," At the same time, it all looks like a setup to pull the rug pull."
"23895880","23902720"," I don't mean to be so bearish on any stocks right now, but the problem is if you saw a"
"23902720","23905120"," red bar up here, that's what you want to see. "
"23905220","23906900"," You want to see like a giant red bar up here."
"23907720","23909780"," You want to see a sitting on support right here."
"23910500","23912580"," You want to see the ability to trade higher. "
"23913380","23914620"," We're just not seeing that."
"23914840","23917440"," We're not seeing the money flow into the market as of yet."
"23917700","23918700"," So be conscious of this. "
"23919500","23923160"," I don't know where bottom is 1791 if we trade lower."
"23927160","23929140"," Could get ugly, be honest."
"23938100","23939940"," I said one ticker. "
"23940320","23941820"," Keep seeing two tickers."
"23941920","23942500"," Everybody's getting greedy."
"23947740","23948660"," We'll get forward. "
"23951060","23952760"," Then we'll look at what's the next one."
"23955100","23956760"," Snow, I missed snow, sorry."
"23961780","23966820"," Yeah, I had energy up on my chart earlier and then I stopped trading. "
"23967040","23968680"," I just turned away and started doing some work."
"23971280","23972400"," This one doesn't look so bad."
"23972660","23973780"," Ford does look now. "
"23973880","23975980"," This is the healthiest of all we've been looking at so far."
"23975980","23979860"," We just defined a wall, basically a 25 bucks."
"23980440","23985540"," We have some decent support down here at 22.75. It's not a bad, not a bad trade right here. "
"23985760","23986740"," I like this trade the most."
"23987720","23988920"," We have more buyers than sellers."
"23989320","23990800"," The hero indicator is slightly positive. "
"23991420","23993660"," This is kind of what you want to be seeing as something like this."
"23995000","23996120"," This right here looks good."
"23996700","23997180"," I like this. "
"23998380","24000240"," You want to look above and see if there's anything higher?"
"24002200","24005940"," Looks like you got some sneaky sellers above, though, 26 bucks."
"24006780","24010780"," But this chart so far of all the charts I've looked at is the best-looking one on paper."
"24012060","24012560"," It's Ford. "
"24020410","24026350"," That's the difference in Ford versus some of those other tickers, right?"
"24026470","24031030"," You're not seeing a wall close by above that you can trade to."
"24031030","24032550"," You're just seeing like nothing."
"24032710","24033510"," There's no calls there. "
"24034270","24036510"," No one thinks those stocks are going up."
"24039980","24041080"," Look at Snownext."
"24041320","24042540"," Snow's a good indicator for the market. "
"24043900","24044700"," Same thing."
"24046120","24047380"," I'm going to say here."
"24050260","24051840"," Get a nice support here at 280. "
"24052860","24054100"," Get a wall above at 300."
"24058640","24060900"," In case that sell down, we'll take a look."
"24061300","24066260"," This is one of the stocks that tells us if the market is weak or not. "
"24070860","24071920"," 250, 240."
"24073420","24076080"," It's your oh shit moment if the market sells off."
"24080800","24082160"," Price target on Snow 300. "
"24089720","24090900"," What am I looking at here?"

"24260960","24264660"," I didn't know that I could take up to 15k gifts per year."

"24282630","24286170"," Yeah, we have different we're going to have different roles and for people."
"24286770","24288650"," So that we know we have like trusted traders."

"24308580","24311840"," So what's my let's talk about the clothes right here at 323 in the afternoon. "
"24312400","24315100"," So my idea is you guys already know my idea, right?"
"24315460","24315900"," My idea."
"24316240","24316700"," Yeah, we want a good."
"24316820","24317560"," We want a nice community. "
"24317660","24318720"," We don't want to get crazy."
"24318720","24324440"," We want to build this community so that when people come into it that they feel as though they're"
"24324440","24324740"," welcomed."
"24325860","24331120"," No matter what kind of experience that they have that we respect people with experience as well and"
"24331120","24332320"," look to them as for leadership. "
"24332820","24334280"," And then we also want to make sure that."
"24335920","24336980"," This is a free salary."
"24336980","24341380"," We want to make sure that people can get access to a sob and not get raked over the coals"
"24341380","24346780"," for a thousand bucks, two thousand bucks a month for no actionable trading, right?"
"24348360","24349940"," Let's look back at the spy real quick. "
"24350600","24352560"," I didn't get to getting it to all of your trades."
"24352560","24353140"," I apologize."
"24353960","24354920"," So what do I think?"
"24355000","24355740"," I think the same thing. "
"24355740","24357120"," I think I think the same thing is before."
"24357360","24357480"," Okay."
"24358440","24360480"," We're just looking for an excuse to sell this market. "
"24362140","24366620"," We've got call delta rolling off positive call delta rolling rolling off into the 21st."
"24368980","24375180"," Even when we've gone up in previous opexes on positive forward looking times we still sell off and"
"24375180","24375800"," we have rips."
"24375800","24378060"," We have volatility heading into opex. "
"24379800","24384420"," I guess the look would be if you want to be long this market, it's probably not until Monday."
"24384980","24389160"," Not until all of the delta's roll off and we find out where everybody is."
"24389620","24391740"," But in reality, my price target's 428. "
"24393180","24394980"," That's where my price target is right now."
"24395720","24396400"," It's on the boards."
"24397700","24401060"," I think 440 is easy for us to attain between now and Monday. "
"24401820","24403320"," I think it's very easy."
"24404060","24409980"," I think if that gets digested and you see the cascade of puts coming down, we can trade down to"
"24409980","24411340"," 428 easily as well."
"24412040","24415360"," Before mid month in February, I think it's the inverse of most opexes. "
"24415880","24417720"," That doesn't mean we don't trade up in this time period."
"24418300","24421780"," So if you want to be a safe bear, then just wait."
"24421960","24423780"," There's probably probably going to trade up at some point. "
"24424560","24427000"," I wouldn't be shocking to see us trade to 470 again."
"24427900","24428840"," I wouldn't blow my mind."
"24429280","24433880"," I wouldn't be shocking to trade down to 440 and you miss it, but then trade back up to 450"
"24433880","24434820"," to grab it again. "
"24435240","24436800"," But either way, you're selling rips here."
"24437460","24439040"," You know, keep that in your mind at this point."
"24439320","24444400"," We broke through, you know, this morning I started the livestream early this morning at 8.30, I"
"24444400","24444660"," think. "
"24446060","24449620"," And that was to just give you guys where I'm at, right?"
"24449880","24459880"," So you guys, before we went to open for the first 45 minutes or so, until"
"24459880","24468940"," something changes and then further keyed in on this, not only did we break that channel, but we"
"24468940","24471260"," broke below into bear country."
"24472420","24474160"," We broke below key support."
"24475020","24476760"," The 460 number was no joking around. "
"24477480","24484340"," Us being below 460, watching hedge expansion to the downside to 428 lends that same idea."
"24484340","24488940"," And right down here at 450, you can see us heading in the close and you get buyers down."
"24489040","24489520"," And these are banks. "
"24489720","24490760"," These aren't retail traders."
"24492100","24494080"," These are banks expecting us to go down."
"24495920","24502940"," When you look above on the spy, there are some calls at 480 and 470. "
"24503420","24505780"," You can see it here at 470 or we show this."
"24508520","24512040"," There are calls above at 470 and again at 480."
"24513060","24515100"," You know, and this is a true call wall. "
"24517100","24519680"," There are people buying calls to 480 right now."
"24520740","24522820"," You've got solid sellers at 476."
"24524320","24527800"," And people have asked the question, why are people long to 480 here?"
"24528580","24530060"," No one knows the answer to that. "
"24532400","24534280"," No one knows why there's still calls out there."
"24534580","24537920"," If you look at a chart right now of options, I can show you guys."
"24538200","24538820"," I don't know if I can. "
"24538940","24539920"," You guys want me to show you the chart?"
"24539920","24542440"," I can show it to you."
"24542700","24543480"," Just believe me, it's there."
"24544380","24546900"," But I don't think that it leads to us trading to 480. "
"24547340","24548280"," I don't see that happening."
"24551220","24553060"," None of the other call flow coming in."
"24553160","24555040"," The current call flow coming in. "
"24555200","24558300"," None of the put flow coming in is saying that we're trading to 480."
"24566260","24569100"," At this point, I don't need you to tell me to sell the rips."
"24569780","24570580"," Hutch is all about it. "
"24573500","24574300"," Unpaid internships."
"24574800","24577260"," Yeah, thanks for joining."
"24578100","24580740"," $9.99. Yeah, exactly a little big bear. "
"24581080","24583240"," $1,000 a month for hindsight calls."
"24583900","24584800"," It's all over the place."
"24584840","24586480"," It runs rampant all over the Internet. "
"24586740","24587800"," It blows my mind."
"24593790","24595450"," It literally blows my mind."
"24598930","24601570"," Biden just announced a press conference at the close. "
"24601890","24602410"," Thanks, Modell."
"24602750","24604190"," I did do want to know that."
"24604670","24606550"," It is funny that he's holding a press conference. "
"24607270","24608030"," What does he have?"
"24608210","24608830"," I don't know."
"24608910","24609650"," I don't know what this guy."
"24611610","24612330"," I'm a Democrat. "
"24612630","24616430"," I'm like, I have no fucking idea what's going on with this guy, especially when it relates to the"
"24616430","24616730"," markets."
"24617830","24619690"," I have zero idea what this guy is doing."
"24619910","24621150"," There's nothing he can say. "
"24623250","24626470"," Yeah, there will be discord roles to distinguish between traders."
"24629770","24630390"," In the room."
"24630590","24633070"," And don't be like, if you're a new trader, I'd want to say, how many traders?"
"24633550","24634410"," There's one thing. "
"24635430","24636730"," There's one thing to know, right?"
"24636950","24637850"," There's a couple things to know."
"24638670","24642690"," First off, a lot of trading rooms have a lot of assholes that are of experienced traders."
"24644510","24645710"," We don't want that. "
"24646110","24648210"," I don't need asshole traders in there."
"24648870","24650470"," Whether they know what they're doing or don't."
"24650870","24654430"," We need people that are there to make money, retail that's not fighting with each other. "
"24655230","24659230"," And if you're a new trader, and you say I'm a new trader, and someone's willing to help you, and"
"24659230","24660490"," that's fucking awesome, right?"
"24661090","24662490"," Someone's willing to take time to help you, whatever."
"24663150","24666370"," All those, there's like a basket full of asshole trader rooms."
"24666890","24669150"," And I don't need any of those traders trading with us. "
"24669690","24672230"," Those guys can stay there and be assholes and douchebags."
"24673450","24674610"," I've traded in those rooms."
"24674890","24676050"," I've been an asshole when I was younger. "
"24676290","24678670"," I was an asshole, and I'm just past that at this point."
"24678850","24680050"," So I just don't need that in my life."
"24680850","24683210"," And I don't think all those, a lot of those guys trade either. "
"24683530","24686170"," I have like a sneaking suspicion that they don't trade."
"24687590","24688750"," Or they got that hindsight trading."
"24689170","24690670"," They only tell you about the ones that win. "
"24690670","24692110"," They don't tell you when they lose."
"24692890","24694190"," I just don't need that in my life."
"24694270","24697370"," I've lost too much money following guys like that. "
"24697990","24698990"," So I'll never do that again."
"24699790","24701450"," That's like a golden fucking rule in my book."
"24702930","24706330"," And I did beat traders eventually that only it's funny. "
"24706490","24709110"," The traders that helped me are the ones that made me a better trader."
"24709810","24712810"," The ones that took the time to spend the time with me, made me a better trader."
"24713610","24715850"," They like stopped me and helped me along the way. "
"24716270","24719310"," So this point from that point forward, I'll never ever again."
"24720570","24721690"," Follow traders like that."
"24723870","24726010"," Okay, so 450 looks like it's a magnet here. "
"24727350","24728850"," Wouldn't be shocking to sell down to 450."
"24730290","24731530"," Yeah, we're selling down right now."
"24731610","24733390"," It wasn't even looking at the charts and we are right. "
"24733650","24737190"," So we're dropping down to 4.25. It's like a fucking magnet."
"24739590","24740510"," It's going to be a magnet."
"24741370","24743410"," And there's nothing else you can say about this, right?"
"24743810","24746430"," So if you're a bull, I'd say step out of the fucking way. "
"24746850","24749490"," I'd say step out of the way if you're a bull, even if we trade higher."
"24750310","24754130"," I'd say right now the volatility in the market, unless you're a badass day trader, a day-to-day"
"24754130","24756850"," trader, the badass, I would say, watch the fuck out."
"24757110","24761630"," Because this is where we're going to wind up grinding a shit ton of people out of this market. "
"24762950","24763630"," That's the intent."
"24765050","24765410"," Right?"
"24765810","24766390"," That's the intent."
"24770910","24772010"," So yeah, we trade down. "
"24774550","24776590"," You have spies saying it's a rig ready to drill."
"24778210","24783230"," Yeah, so I need people to just mod too."
"24783570","24788710"," You don't have to be a great trader or 10 years' experience or five years' experience. "
"24789370","24793830"," Hey, guys, just try to help quell issues in the sub, too."
"24793950","24795070"," People just say, hey, how are you doing?"
"24795190","24795810"," Or how can I help you?"
"24795990","24797570"," Or can I direct you somewhere?"
"24798190","24801510"," Or don't be using these fucking words, certain words."
"24802330","24803530"," You don't need to square if you guys swear. "
"24804530","24806650"," This derogatory shit that will set people off."
"24808770","24810110"," Sometimes it's just an easy conversation."
"24810810","24811230"," Are you okay?"
"24811590","24812990"," Everything all right, going all right with you today?"
"24813590","24815670"," Like nobody that's making money is going to be pissed off. "
"24816290","24818430"," So if somebody's pissed off, they're typically losing money."
"24820410","24826230"," They're trading down now $4.54. I would say that the price target's $4.50, if not now, into"
"24826230","24826890"," tomorrow."
"24829760","24832960"," If we get this, if we get this melt off, melt off, sell down. "
"24833860","24834460"," Oh shit, moment."
"24835960","24837640"," You're going to get panicked too, is the market."
"24837640","24841080"," Just so you guys know, you're going to get panicked from now into Friday. "
"24841620","24845780"," All the shit that's out there, everything says, says we're selling off."
"24846260","24847400"," Just full on Boar Panic."
"24848160","24851520"," But some guys, some bulls going to tell you we're going up because they're bag holders. "
"24852260","24857120"," Some guys going to tell you we're going to 480 or whatever fucking stock they're in."
"24857240","24858740"," I'm telling you, they're just bag holders."
"24859380","24860200"," They're already upside down. "
"24860440","24860980"," They're going to get fucked."
"24862300","24862740"," IWM."
"24862740","24869980"," This is the same thing as, this is the exact same thing as speculative growth stocks. "
"24870580","24872140"," January of 2021."
"24874280","24875440"," Same exact thing."
"24875920","24879440"," For nine months, you've heard of fucking people telling you our case coming back. "
"24880240","24881280"," And it hasn't."
"24881520","24884020"," For nine months, I've been saying our case going to $65."
"24884800","24890620"," We're fucking closer to $65 in our K than we are to $200 in our K, right?"
"24893340","24895140"," We talked about that with ArcG. "
"24895380","24896540"," We talked about it with ArcF."
"24897020","24898420"," Like just not happening right now."
"24899260","24899780"," IWM. "
"24901700","24903140"," More hedging coming in."
"24903500","24907640"," IWM, 204P January 31st for $900,000."
"24909180","24912860"," IWM, January 19th, 206P, $50,000. "
"24913260","24914480"," Somebody's following that trade."
"24915620","24917060"," This is the same in the inverse."
"24917200","24920560"," If you're a bull, we haven't seen those calls all week long. "
"24920660","24922220"," We haven't seen million dollar calls on Tesla."
"24922220","24925360"," We haven't seen a couple on Tesla, a couple of believers."
"24925800","24929780"," But generally speaking, the market, all we've seen is major put flow. "
"24930100","24931160"," And at some point, right?"
"24932300","24935940"," Even if it says we're not going to trade down there because so many people have bought those puts."
"24936520","24941120"," At some point, you reach a cascade effect where you will trade down there."
"24941620","24946680"," Where the dealers, the brokers, banks, they can't do a fucking thing. "
"24947320","24950640"," You are going to trade down there because nobody wants to buy the market."
"24954640","24957560"," I sound like a full on fucking dirty ass bear."
"24957880","24958500"," Listen to me. "
"24960780","24962220"," At least I know when to be a bear."
"24966340","24967960"," Some of you fucking bears out there."
"24968040","24971580"," You're just fucking losing break in your account for two fucking straight years. "
"24971920","24973320"," Shit, longer, 2007."
"24974700","24975800"," That's seven, maybe eight."
"24978720","24981360"," So if there's a time to be a bear, this is one of those fucking times. "
"24981720","24982460"," That's my point, right?"
"24983020","24987200"," One of those times right now that you should be more than cautious."
"24987880","24989660"," Sometimes I say use caution."
"24990500","24991860"," Right now is not the time to be using caution. "
"24992080","24995160"," Right now is the time to be using, I'm just selling every rip."
"24998990","25003130"," If you get blown out once on a rip, let's say we get blown out."
"25004410","25007230"," Let's say we get blown out on a rip, we go up 100 points. "
"25008250","25013810"," Last 20 fucking days, no matter what, if you sold those rips, you'd still be up 19 out of those"
"25013810","25014490"," 20 times."
"25016510","25017930"," So keep selling the rips."
"25018850","25022270"," Keep looking for places to sell and just sell, sell, sell. "
"25022750","25023990"," I don't know what else to say about it."
"25025990","25027230"," It sounded like a bear now."
"25031310","25031890"," Excuse me. "
"25032190","25036730"," We did have some resistance earlier at 4.53. We'll take a look there and see if any of the"
"25036730","25037950"," buyers are stepping up again."
"25039190","25043090"," And they're coming out a little bit here at 4.53. Remember these guys from earlier?"
"25043090","25046800"," A little bit of buying here."
"25047040","25048280"," Maybe some mail goes triggering. "
"25053600","25054540"," But I see panic."
"25055320","25056200"," I see bull panic."
"25056700","25057980"," I see behind closed doors. "
"25058480","25060360"," Bull's full on fucking panic."
"25061620","25063340"," Whether they're telling you that or not."
"25064140","25068160"," I think that you're going to get Tesla bulls out there on Twitter saying that they're buying every"
"25068160","25068760"," fucking dip. "
"25069240","25072700"," In reality, they're fucking selling calls by the bushelode."
"25074680","25076340"," Selling calls by the bushelode."
"25076520","25077860"," Looking to get out of their fucking stock. "
"25078400","25081680"," Hoping in praying and then get out at 1200 or 1100 before."
"25083380","25085460"," He are hoping and praying."
"25086460","25087280"," Hoping and winging a prayer. "
"25087740","25088640"," That's my thought."
"25090460","25095180"," I'm a Tesla bull, but I mean, I had Tesla bulls showing me that they were long at 12 at"
"25095180","25095500"," the peak."
"25096820","25099140"," Long 50,000, long 100,000. "
"25101440","25103120"," Showing me their actual fucking trade."
"25103460","25105560"," Their actual trading platform pictures."
"25107060","25108260"," I'm like, you guys are crazy. "
"25108860","25111380"," Crazy first for showing me your platform pictures."
"25111900","25114840"," But secondly, crazy for fucking buying that top."
"25115160","25117260"," And they're probably still stuck in Tesla right now. "
"25117760","25120040"," These are the people they're going to want to sell up between now."
"25121560","25123880"," And OPEC's in DR and the Fed."
"25124840","25126720"," Just the volatility that the Fed brings. "
"25127260","25128660"," And they're in a blackout right now."
"25128860","25133420"," Even if the Fed came out on the Fed day and said, oh, yeah, we're not going to raise rates"
"25133420","25133780"," at all."
"25134320","25134700"," Oopsie. "
"25135980","25140140"," That's the only thing that's going to make this market go up right now, at least this time of the"
"25140140","25140340"," year."
"25141500","25142360"," Up above 480."
"25143340","25145040"," We know that the ceiling is 480, right?"
"25145600","25146840"," We know even if we traded up to 480. "
"25147340","25151520"," Do any of you right now really believe we're trading up to 500 if we traded a 480?"
"25151800","25155340"," The only reason that would happen is we found a decent bottom that's value."
"25155980","25158180"," I finally read the spot gamma report."
"25158660","25161220"," They said that value today was at 460. "
"25162140","25166640"," Before I even read that report, I came on here and told you that's fucking bullshit."
"25167060","25172760"," I told you yesterday before they said 460 today, I told you yesterday, it's not fucking 460."
"25173560","25174140"," It's lower. "
"25174780","25177540"," And we traded lower to the end of today."
"25177740","25180840"," So we're a day ahead of even spot gamma and knowing this information."
"25183300","25184240"," We knew yesterday. "
"25184240","25187840"," We saw the hedge flow coming into 428 P."
"25189140","25192260"," We know that that expands the move lower and not higher."
"25194080","25195900"," We're not talking about regular put flow either."
"25196060","25197420"," We're talking about hedge flow in the market. "
"25202310","25203570"," So I don't say on that shit."
"25203810","25206810"," I know I know is that this is where we're at in the market."
"25207050","25211990"," This is the natural way of the market to cleanse itself and to expect this. "
"25218400","25220700"," Price target on the spot at this moment into close."
"25220700","25222180"," We might not hit it, but we might."
"25222600","25223180"," It would be 450. "
"25224800","25228460"," If you guys want to see a price target lower, heading into the rest of the week, you have 450"
"25228460","25229200"," right here."
"25230000","25232620"," And we already know it's down here at 440, right?"
"25233240","25234120"," Next real stop."
"25234780","25238560"," A little bit of buyers at 445. "
"25239780","25241540"," Looks like 442 is the number."
"25242240","25244900"," A little bit of 440."
"25245320","25247120"," I bet this would firm up to like the 440 area. "
"25253570","25257750"," Let's look at this in the inverse from a bull's perspective."
"25259150","25265670"," Normally, from a bull's perspective, let's say when the bears are only right one side of every 10"
"25265670","25265970"," times."
"25267030","25270130"," Well, the bears have been right nine out of the last 10 times. "
"25270390","25274650"," Matter of fact, if I could count on my betchits, I betchits 19 out of the last 20 times."
"25276550","25280970"," So if they're starting to turn out to be right, more often the bulls are right right now."
"25282090","25286650"," If you haven't switched to selling rips at this point, I don't know what to say to you. "
"25287250","25290730"," You're probably going to blow up your fucking account between now and March at some point."
"25292290","25294310"," And you'll probably capitulate at some point."
"25298070","25299070"," And that's what they're looking for. "
"25299770","25302230"," And they're going to keep doing this until you capitulate."
"25305820","25306560"," What do you say?"
"25306720","25307260"," I feel what it's called."
"25307460","25307740"," What do you say?"
"25307960","25311080"," You say stop resisting. "
"25311500","25312400"," That's what I used to say on Twitter."
"25313080","25314280"," Bears stop resisting."
"25314800","25315880"," And that's the same thing with the bulls. "
"25316620","25317940"," Bulls stop resisting."
"25318960","25324420"," Because the moment that the bulls stop resisting, that's the moment we go back up again."
"25330270","25334230"," The moment that the bulls capitulate, the moment that you see the Tesla bulls stop buying calls,"
"25335010","25339770"," the moment that you start seeing people trying to tell me that ERs are going to be good, that"
"25339770","25341310"," Apple's going to rip on a positive ER. "
"25341510","25342770"," They're going to launch the Apple car."
"25342770","25344250"," I want to say, fuck this."
"25344430","25344650"," I'm out. "
"25345170","25346510"," Take a money and go home."
"25347310","25351010"," That's the moment when I'll buy calls again, going super high long, right?"
"25351230","25352990"," Buying stock and all that other kind of shit."
"25357510","25358770"," Otherwise, I'll play a..."
"25358770","25363630"," I'm going to play a straddle here into next week, into Wednesday. "
"25364690","25366570"," So we'll cover calls are so cheap."
"25367110","25368490"," There's no reason that's one other thing."
"25368630","25371450"," As a bear, there's no reason not to buy 10 cent calls. "
"25371990","25374130"," And just in case we do go up, that is your protection."
"25374130","25379990"," I tell this to bulls all the time when you're going long in this market by dirt cheap puts to"
"25379990","25380550"," protect yourself."
"25380930","25386430"," And as we go down, it's always wise to buy some, you know, 5 cent, 1 cent, 10 cent calls"
"25386430","25388070"," at key junctures. "
"25393520","25394740"," I always remember that as well."
"25395320","25398140"," I didn't say that in that whole entire rant until just now."
"25400020","25400760"," Apple car. "
"25403540","25405220"," Yeah, here indicator is positive."
"25406640","25411770"," I like what spot camera says."
"25411850","25413590"," Oftentimes spot camera stuff works. "
"25414450","25422270"," But a lot of their information is so, it's so, it matters so much to the moment that they, I"
"25422270","25425210"," don't think that they can get their information out quick enough when things change."
"25427450","25430130"," I don't think that they, they're big probably."
"25430730","25434650"," But I don't think that they can shift or move as quickly as we can. "
"25435250","25437510"," I think we use it as like a benchmark as a guide."
"25437510","25438130"," It's like a tool."
"25438850","25444030"," And then you look at the real time stuff that's going on, and then you apply it in real time. "
"25444830","25450670"," And you, I mean, not always, but sometimes I'd say at least 40% of the time you're about a"
"25450670","25453350"," day, day and a half ahead of spot camera on most of their information."
"25453610","25455750"," Not most, but a good percentage of it."
"25458490","25459170"," About 30. "
"25459350","25459570"," Yeah."
"25460090","25461270"," I'd say like 30 per session."
"25461530","25461810"," Say that much. "
"25461950","25464250"," We're like 30% of the time you're about a day ahead of spot camera."
"25465130","25470310"," But they, they give great, their, their story is great."
"25470910","25475130"," It usually works out in the long run, like over a five day, 10 day period. "
"25475750","25480430"," Their story typically pans out, but there's, you know, there's these little things in between all"
"25480430","25482590"," that that can make a break."
"25484190","25487770"," Seeing that, remember that old support down here for three, seeing a little bit of a bounce here?"
"25488830","25489670"," Four fifties of the target."
"25492930","25495050"," Let me know what you guys think is going to happen in the overnight. "
"25496230","25498810"," You guys think that the other is going to be buying in the close?"
"25503720","25504740"," Yeah, that's what it is."
"25504840","25507380"," The beatings will continue until morale improves."
"25513580","25517720"," Algo is being triggered to buy right now or those, these are dealers possibly buying. "
"25518560","25519200"," To hedge long."
"25526320","25529900"," Spy puts came in $200,000, 119."
"25531620","25534460"," Spiring today for 56 P, $200,000. "
"25535240","25539760"," That's like some old school call FDs, right?"
"25540480","25543300"," And buying a bunch of calls right before the close and a zero date."
"25545520","25546860"," Trying to push it down into the bell."
"25554270","25554910"," I don't know. "
"25555070","25556870"," I sold that first rip on hood."
"25557030","25558290"," I ended up selling a look at hood though."
"25559510","25560550"," I'll take a look for you. "
"25561550","25564810"," I took some profit off hood earlier about that first dip."
"25571270","25576330"," I bought some spy calls expiring into next week as a hedge."
"25583760","25587280"," All like 10 cent calls, 20 cent calls, just in case. "
"25591320","25595620"," Just like where I'm a bull, like I'm hedging with puts hedging with calls right now."
"25598020","25598880"," We'll look at eight."
"25599060","25599740"," We'll look at hood next. "
"25603180","25604500"," Yeah, that support moved up."
"25604700","25606060"," That's a pretty good bounce right there too."
"25607020","25610140"," Let's see into the closing bell if support has gone lower. "
"25610520","25615020"," Yes, we're back down to $13.50 now on support for hood."
"25615380","25617420"," It moved up earlier today to $14."
"25617620","25619200"," These guys swooped right up and bought the dip. "
"25619920","25623740"," And now they've moved back down again to $13.50. Not a bad game."
"25624800","25625580"," I wouldn't buy right here."
"25625700","25630060"," I'd be buying again down at $13.60. Wait to see what these guys are doing down here. "
"25630800","25632360"," Seeing some more buyers separate at $13."
"25633040","25635720"," And we actually saw $12 the other day."
"25635720","25638720"," It looks like they moved. "
"25638720","25639640"," They all moved up here."
"25640180","25642320"," You can see that most of those buyers have moved above."
"25643780","25650940"," They're right around that $13.60, $13.50, $13.90. Positioning is critical in trading hood. "
"25652780","25657100"," Until we get some volume in hood that kind of moves like a dog."
"25657660","25659340"," I think it printed like 30% or something."
"25668760","25670380"," Head back to the spine of the clothes. "
"25671500","25672720"," Hey, welcome to the Warriors, guys."
"25673940","25674500"," End of day."
"25674680","25675400"," Hero is positive. "
"25677360","25679120"," We'll look at the hero real quick."
"25683990","25685930"," Let's look at the hero for the entire day."
"25686250","25687570"," This is something I haven't showed you guys. "
"25689750","25690930"," Oh, you know what I forgot?"
"25691250","25691790"," I might have forgotten."
"25692170","25692770"," No, I didn't."
"25692910","25693270"," Here we go. "
"25693350","25694270"," I want to show you guys this."
"25695210","25695830"," Important to show."
"25697830","25699130"," We can show the entire day. "
"25700290","25700870"," We can get it to load."
"25702850","25704110"," It's kind of important to be looking at."
"25705170","25709050"," Let's even get the entire day's hero indicator on here for the bell. "
"25715740","25717160"," It's going to take a minute for it to load."
"25719540","25721540"," I don't know why I'm not getting the entire day."
"25721580","25722600"," Am I doing something wrong here?"
"25727800","25728280"," Too much information. "
"25740190","25741470"," This is nice to see right here."
"25741550","25742730"," You see the volume picking up."
"25744010","25747770"," Volume of sellers, volume of buyers stepping into the clothes today. "
"25749270","25751490"," Hero indicator, a little bit of a weakness down here."
"25751610","25757150"," This is that nice trade down to $4.53. Hero indicator is going off the charts into the clothes"
"25757150","25757390"," here."
"25762770","25764670"," More sellers than buyers at the moment. "
"25766330","25770550"," Some reason I can't get us to look at this trade into the bell here."
"25778110","25781410"," If you're making money on puts right now, just buy some 10 cent calls."
"25782390","25784590"," I'll tell you, it's the exact inverse of being a bull. "
"25788020","25790080"," Making money selling rips by cheap calls."
"25790700","25791520"," Head yourself out."
"25793200","25794080"," It's pretty easy. "
"25795080","25804800"," If you spend $100 and you make $100, make 100% on puts, you take $10 and you buy yourself"
"25804800","25805200"," some calls."
"25807740","25810360"," You take the other of the $100 that you made, you lost 10."
"25811220","25814640"," You keep 50, you take another 40 and you enter into more puts on a rip. "
"25815880","25816800"," Same strategy."
"25817180","25819400"," Well, that's not exactly that, but that's basically what it is."
"25820760","25821660"," You get the gist. "
"25821900","25823460"," You have to figure out the percentages for yourselves."
"25845860","25846900"," One second here."
"25847260","25848560"," I'm going to place another trade. "
"25850460","25860920"," Looking at net calls coming in, $1.15. February 4th, $1.15. C, $2.27. It's not $1.15. Yeah,"
"25861040","25864160"," it's $1.15. C for $227,000."
"25864360","25865140"," Snow calls."
"25865620","25866560"," Someone was asking for snow. "
"25867060","25867480"," Snow."
"25867980","25871860"," February 4th, $3.20. For $156,000."
"25890900","25899420"," Another nice day of capitulation right into the closing bell. "
"25902920","25904300"," One note."
"25905500","25908480"," We are closing in the cash market."
"25909060","25909960"," One key note. "
"25910660","25913000"," We are closing in the cash markets."
"25913000","25917840"," It's below any kind of trend line going back to March 2020."
"25918700","25919880"," You'll be aware of that. "
"25922380","25929360"," As we wrap up here, we are closing with basically a mega fucking bearish engulfing candle."
"26020590","26027470"," Yeah, there's there's a why you all to know this that this closed today at this bell."
"26029650","26038070"," This close after this bell is the most bearish we've been in a very, very long time. "
"26047880","26057000"," It would not shock me today at this point after the after the bell rings that you see some margin"
"26057000","26063640"," calls go out and it'll trigger some selling in Bitcoin to cover those margin calls."
"26065560","26067420"," This will trigger some panic."
"26067420","26072720"," You might even see some hedging coming in the market between four and four fifteen today. "
"26073140","26075840"," So I'll stick around with you until four fifteen."
"26077200","26082040"," And if I see anything coming through between four and four fifteen, all you guys know."
"26089540","26090760"," This should be a trigger. "
"26091920","26103100"," The blue"
"26103100","26103880"," skies below."
"26107360","26108820"," Blue skies below."
"26112320","26119220"," Right on the razor on the knife side right four fifty two seventy seven four fifty clear skies"
"26119220","26119660"," below. "
"26141340","26143500"," We are selling futures right now."
"26143500","26149680"," You can see the cell program in 176,000 sellers here accumulators off the charts at the same time."
"26199610","26205990"," Someone just bought spy puts one nineteen four fifty two P."
"26207130","26212550"," Someone also bought some some IWM puts two oh five P expiring today. "
"26214230","26219390"," This reminds me of when when the bulls are looking for that peak baby."
"26233960","26238860"," Yeah that the worst part of this moment right here for bulls is that this is not."
"26239820","26241640"," This isn't like any other bottom. "
"26243080","26252880"," This is the kind of"
"26252880","26253540"," bottom where."
"26264400","26268080"," This is the kind of bottom where when you're coming into this close right you don't want to be"
"26268080","26269160"," bottoming where we are"
"26311590","26322530"," bottoming."
"26322530","26327010"," This is going to be a January nineteen five hundred five hundred and thirty nine thousand dollars"
"26327010","26327330"," and puts. "
"26328330","26332110"," On docks do CS if you're bearish on that ticker."
"26332810","26334710"," Watching some puts come in on gold."
"26336110","26341710"," February eighteen that's G.O.L.D. not G.L.D. February eighteen twenty one P."
"26342330","26343910"," Five hundred thousand dollars. "
"26385090","26389230"," Slowing down into that forty one four fifty one excuse me eighty three number again."
"26389730","26391710"," To begin look at the four fifty number."
"26392370","26394530"," See if the buyers are even here into the bell. "
"26395670","26396770"," And I don't see them."
"26400300","26402800"," Oh they're down there they're sneaking down they're not even there anymore."
"26404060","26408020"," We got two minutes left into the bell you can see the buyers have disappeared the last two minutes. "
"26408600","26413220"," You're not seeing this big giant green hammer candle into the bell or at least this moment you're"
"26413220","26413420"," not."
"26418280","26419980"," Straight capitulation in the bell."
"26445530","26447490"," To be expected into the bell here. "
"26466170","26478110"," See you get a little bit closer tagging into"
"26478110","26482090"," the four o'clock hour four fifty one point forty six."
"26486270","26487970"," Down from basically."
"26490130","26497530"," One hundred and seventy in change handles that handles points we're in sport talking spy right now. "
"26498010","26500290"," One hundred and seventy within five days."
"26502980","26504140"," That might have that right."
"26504400","26505960"," Yeah somewhere in there I think I got that right. "
"26506300","26506580"," I'd be wrong."
"26506800","26507800"," Yeah one hundred and seventy or so."
"26508560","26510640"," And seventy points penalty council you guys count. "
