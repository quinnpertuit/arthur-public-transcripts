"1905580","1911620"," money either if you start to see in the money call buying Uh, it's it's usually uh, that's that's"
"1911620","1918300"," usually dumb money Now you want to see outside the money call buying up and above where we"
"1918300","1922640"," currently are if you don't see expansion of call buying Across the market. "

"1975460","1982100"," And uh As long as you don't reverse and sell under this then the ie It would look something like"
"1982100","1991640"," this Uh, you would see this 21 ema come up You would see um some selling down let's say Uh,"
"1993460","2000350"," you would see this blue line actually start to curl over You would actually see this painted eraser"
"2000350","2016040"," maybe You would actually see You"
"2016040","2023740"," would actually see this blue line start to curl over and you would see A break of the hourly"
"2023740","2030200"," trigger and you'd see like one two then a rejection we start to sell down Uh, and then you would"
"2030200","2034040"," see the rollover of the hourly you start to see something like that You don't have to call it."
"2034180","2036860"," You only have to just get in on it The trade is not in here. "

"2114040","2127490"," but nice sell with above Spy"
"2127490","2139970"," kicking off right on right on that nice blue line right here 460 already at 400.09 Every"
"2139970","2153390"," book map up so you can have a look at it We're"
"2153390","2163330"," inside with a jpm color as well Write that down"
"2163330","2175740"," as well That's px Oh, look"
"2175740","2197460"," at spx spx, baby That's px Oh"
"2197460","2210910"," Man if you guys remember this I think I think I posted this in a Hold on here We've"
"2210910","2223880"," come far You guys remember this Okay,"
"2223960","2232980"," so mission complete We're now coming into where the jpm collar is We know that they've got a short"
"2232980","2239300"," 4065 c Long 36 30 p and short 36 30 60 p."
"2239560","2246480"," I think I've posted this in a couple discords Um, and I think I did it on a captain's off"
"2246480","2256480"," and I've showed it to some people over time So this is the jpm collar strikes over here Uh, we've"
"2256480","2259960"," got, uh, old man, uh, I should call him old man."
"2260080","2265820"," We got Jamie out in Davos right now Uh, it'd be interesting to see you guys should do your own"
"2265820","2273000"," alerts and look for, uh, Jamie Diamond sometimes Jamie Diamond would like to come out and say"
"2274840","2281340"," oftentimes they'll come out and say We're not short this market or we are short this market as we"
"2281340","2291280"," approach these numbers We're getting kind of close We're at 4 0 0 9 1 1, uh, target"
"2291280","2297080"," above again 4 0 6 5 c We're on that path so far."
"2297780","2305780"," Um, nothing has changed here We we definitely Even if jpm doesn't sell You're going to be looking"
"2305780","2311480"," for for Jamie to come out and say something If you don't see Jamie some say something and we"
"2311480","2316700"," continue higher Uh, I would still expect there to be a bump in the road as we come up here"
"2316700","2323920"," You're going to see bears come in with puts Well, you heard chase this morning say, uh, that"
"2323920","2331100"," there's been a, uh, heightened put buying You've also heard spot gamma saying that this morning"
"2331100","2338500"," that, um, there is some put buying Uh, and that we would need to see, uh, higher higher higher time"
"2338500","2345060"," frame and higher or outside the money calls We bought to counter, uh, those puts Another, uh,"
"2345160","2352640"," impact of put buying is dealers offsetting that position So if you if you don't see Outside the"
"2352640","2360140"," money call buying right now, right if you just keep put buying Uh, you will see, uh, dealers That"
"2360140","2366640"," will take the opposite side of that trade and move the market up before it rolls Um, so this one"
"2366640","2372640"," up costing, uh, put buyers Uh, because of course you have the dealers are offsetting those trades"
"2373280","2378800"," Yeah, so this could lead to us, uh, trading higher and just 406, uh, or higher So, uh, take your"
"2378800","2384860"," time before you're going to enter, um, this short position to this possible rollover I also keep in"
"2384860","2391640"," mind that I'll get the screen box down here Uh, but we could trade down to like this, uh, 320"
"2391640","2397740"," area here Uh, you want to respect you're going to expect some some put holders to try to close out"
"2397740","2400620"," at like 320 or So this is a huge move, right?"
"2401140","2403560"," Talking about what is that a 800 point move down?"
"2403940","2410840"," It's a monster move if we went down there monster, uh, and so for us to go higher here I"
"2410840","2416960"," want you to look at this from the position of a bank, um And I posted this last night where"
"2416960","2418480"," I said on, I'm thin to it. "
"2418580","2425440"," I said, uh, I'm looking for the Inverse head and shoulders And, uh, the inverse head and shoulders"
"2425440","2431040"," if you well you get the cup in the handle over here Typically moves into like the straight shot"
"2431040","2436460"," north right here Uh, that's just the cup and handle Here's the cup."
"2436560","2446740"," There's the handle Um Here's the cup Here's the handle typically goes like this And, uh But"
"2446740","2451460"," I'm looking more for the inverse head and shoulders which you end up getting the cup and handle and"
"2451460","2458960"," then you measure You measure this right here and then you add Uh, the same amount on top of it"
"2461100","2465280"," Which is which I think puts us it doesn't put us that high it puts us like 460 or something"
"2466580","2475960"," Um So Personally I really want to see us Trade sideways to"
"2475960","2484000"," let off some of our Some rotation and then get a strength move up to 420 Uh to then do"
"2484000","2489880"," the 460 possibly But if I don't if we don't see that this week if we if we just blast"
"2489880","2497340"," off here, uh, it's almost an auto short Now, so it's important for you to be watching this as as"
"2497340","2514670"," the next week unfolds Uh, what to expect over here Uh, if"
"2514670","2520170"," you've already done your hedging, um, it Just it's the same as it said before if you want to start"
"2520170","2525250"," your hedging Just keep your keep your head in the bunker And you wait until March 17th for your"
"2525250","2536110"," hedging and you trade the market up as it as it goes up Um, so"
"2536110","2542050"," you guys know about the cup and handle you guys know about the inverse head and shoulders Uh, and"
"2542050","2544950"," the point that I'm trying to make about that inverse shoulders is you have to look at this for"
"2544950","2551490"," bank's perspective If we're only going to go up I don't know hundred fucking point 60 points from"
"2551490","2558970"," here Uh, is so banks want to see one of two things are we going to go up 600 points"
"2558970","2559330"," here?"
"2559730","2561790"," Or are we going to go down 600 points here?"
"2561890","2562710"," And what's the better bet?"
"2563350","2564790"," What's going to pay me more?"
"2566270","2571630"," So that's why I brought up on pin to it the inverse and shoulders if we're going to go up"
"2572230","2579590"," We want to fucking go up a lot like 600 points If we're if you're a bank think of this"
"2579590","2585710"," from an institution's point of view if not I'm going to be looking on a high over here Now to"
"2585710","2590530"," take a short for our trip down 600 points Even if we don't go down 600 points."
"2590670","2592950"," I want the room to go down 600 points, right?"
"2593390","2597970"," There's a lot of juice and money there So I want you to think of that as a trader when"
"2597970","2601210"," we're taking positions Where's the juice?"
"2601570","2602630"," Where's the money?"
"2627090","2628130"," Let's make a ton of money. "
"2628450","2628930"," Yeah, cool."
"2629130","2633950"," Oh, there's There's that there's this whole thing and I did this other thing that I've been looking"
"2633950","2639450"," at where I'm like I'm like and I think I showed it partially toward to you this morning."
"2640110","2650130"," So if you were looking at a um if you're looking at a It'd"
"2650130","2656150"," be really nice to see some kind of uh So this move right here you see this move right here"
"2657750","2667350"," Where we hold on a second here It's better to show you in an hourly chart So there's another uh,"
"2667630","2676330"," there's another interest interesting thing here where Uh, maybe maybe it's better to show in spy on"
"2676330","2686320"," uh There's there's option four or"
"2686320","2696260"," three that I've been looking at and that's where uh, just just like the uh Okay That worker now I"
"2696260","2701860"," don't know if this is gonna work or not. "
"2702560","2711680"," Okay, so There's this other other idea here where No, I don't know if this plays itself out, but"
"2712480","2718640"," There's other idea where you get the initial reaction from jpm up here Right they sell you get"
"2718640","2724720"," pears loading up on puts Uh, we start to sell down and this whole thing down here where I say"
"2724720","2730240"," we They um We get some breadth down nice and low and price doesn't follow So it actually would be"
"2730240","2738340"," a larger bear trap and then we get to that 420 Uh, so price doesn't follow here on these bears"
"2738340","2744980"," that are in this that's not sex that's sell But if we don't get price following if we get more"
"2744980","2751200"," of a move like this here Uh, where we kind of get we tag up here we sell And you"
"2751200","2757440"," get this more of this goofiness here this could actually be the true Move to 420 and that moved to"
"2757440","2766140"," 416 The bears have some work to do here bears have a couple levels to break through um Our bear"
"2766140","2777900"," bears have some work to do bears need to break through a bunch of stuff The"
"2777900","2786560"," bears want to get bloody They want to break below 3d 985 right now They really do they need to"
"2786560","2792420"," get underneath uh, this this number right here Uh, so bears have some work to do bears have to"
"2792420","2797980"," trade back down here break to 294 Uh break through all these moving averages that are coming up and"
"2797980","2807090"," and uh break then break through 3d 967 So they have some work to do Uh, they have their work"
"2807090","2807850"," cut out for them."
"2807950","2829760"," I should say So just be conscious of that as we as we continue to trade here I"
"2829760","2834940"," guess if any guys are day trading i'll leave uh, I'll leave this up so you can see if we"
"2834940","2847740"," continue higher or not Leave this in the one minute And you can trade off the blue line There's"

"6211780","6216220"," take a quick peek here in this one hour here You're gonna see a reaction here, right?"
"6216460","6220080"," You can see that we had demand here in the intraday Right, they bought it up."
"6220180","6220660"," They bought it up."
"6220760","6221220"," They bought it up. "
"6221320","6231520"," They bought it up So you want to be looking at that Right,"
"6231520","6238740"," this is where demand was On the hourly, uh, you can see that's where they bought it up."
"6238920","6244920"," So can we get underneath the hourly And mute this book map for a minute here Uh, but I just"
"6244920","6251720"," really can't get underneath the hourly Uh, it does signify usually a pretty decent trend reversal"
"6253100","6260260"," When we do so just looking back in time if you're looking for Uh, you can see here in the"
"6260260","6261400"," early right got underneath it."
"6261400","6267920"," We had real true trend reversal Uh, some nice beautiful move Into into the trading zone. "

"6276000","6280340"," seen where you know, it's been bought back up right You can get trapped in here."
"6280340","6286500"," So if this blue line Uh keeps going up here, right and we just trade underneath it This is kind"
"6286500","6292720"," of the trade that i'm looking for here is uh, some kind of a Trade higher rate down below here"
"6295640","6299500"," Um, so we'll see what the interaction is like here, but there's something more important I want to"
"6299500","6308220"," say here city ceo jane phrases is the fed could slow rate hikes in late spring early summer So you"

"6323420","6328920"," right this hourly You know that there's been demand here."
"6328940","6338880"," So a bear wants to see demand disappear here uh So we can go lower And traditionally what you"
"6338880","6340660"," do is just look at a five-day chart, right?"
"6342380","6349080"," And uh, hold on here If that demand disappears here Uh, where do we know demand is that below?"

"6366180","6373900"," remember I said 395 26 or 395 20 so I want to show you why I drew that box right"

"8552900","8562790"," Uh, now I do want to show You can see here in in"
"8562790","8572250"," 2006 2007 2008 Fed funds rate came up plateaued And"
"8572250","8577290"," you saw some some Bottoming out of the yield curve inversion here, right?"
"8577830","8585530"," But meanwhile in spx you saw this slow grind higher During this time period You see how he came"
"8585530","8591450"," down here in oh six and then we we actually rolled higher before he rolled down And there's a part"
"8591450","8597910"," of this where uh, there's some front running that sometimes takes place I see this right here."
"8598030","8609880"," You get the flattening and then we get we got a grind up here And then we roll over Hey,"
"8609880","8616480"," what's up buddy Uh, here we didn't have that happen back in 1995 But this has more to do with"
"8616480","8617960"," the same thing back here, right?"
"8618520","8624020"," Fed funds rate comes down Market just trades sideways and up we have one more dip down in here as"
"8624020","8633920"," the fed funds rate comes down Uh, and so just looking at sp But Uh, so"
"8633920","8638680"," the one thing that now this isn't by itself unemployment rate should be in here inflation should be"
"8638680","8645080"," in here Uh, but the one thing i'm trying to point out to you is you could see Uh, you"
"8645080","8650600"," could see this inversion if it starts to trade sideways here if you start to see the fed funds rate"
"8650600","8658720"," flatten out here You could see during this time period the market actually grind higher here Uh,"
"8658720","8663520"," and then if you see the fed funds rate come down and another child trying to show you when they're"
"8663520","8670320"," front run this Uh, they'll still sometimes try to front front run pause and range Uh to start"
"8670320","8677720"," dumping the market before the actual rollover comes in the fed like cutting of the rates And uh,"
"8678020","8684780"," you would actually see this start to rise Just keep the just keep the yield curve on your radar,"
"8685140","8691960"," but It's possible to see us trade higher into the rest of 2023 And then seeing that roll and tend"
"8691960","8701840"," of year it depends on how long the fed Presses the issue Um Presses the issue coming into"
"8704440","8709220"," 2023 2024 and then the unemployment rate we we haven't really discussed at this point either."
"8709360","8714780"," So if you're a bear Um, you know, sometimes people are out there screaming about the yield yield"
"8714780","8724120"," inversion and i'm like, eh And i'm like historically It hasn't been the end all sale for when we"
"8724120","8730060"," crash I really do like the inflation the fed fund rate the inflation rate and the unemployment rate"
"8730060","8739980"," Uh, and we what we do typically see that cutting of the fed fund rate Uh a front"
"8739980","8746940"," running of the fed fund rate Uh when it when it pauses or gets cut before that happens you'll see"
"8747580","8752480"," Uh banks try to front run rolling the market over in a smaller time frame I'll try to bring that"
"8752480","8756380"," up here in a minute so you can actually see when that happens So when you when you hear like"
"8756380","8763840"," a bear say Uh, you never see the market go up when when the fed's raising that's bullshit Uh, the"
"8763840","8768960"," the market can definitely melt up during that time period especially If the market believes that"
"8768960","8775480"," the fed is fighting inflation Huge air quotes And I think that's some of the positive of what bulls"
"8775480","8783660"," are saying Bulls are saying they're trying to say to you look the fed Is telling you that they're"
"8783660","8789220"," going to stay the course Which I don't believe But if they are going to stay the course through"
"8789220","8797620"," 2023 in a 2024 Then uh, you're going to get You're going to get so i'm trying to they got"
"8797620","8802320"," a door they just got like the dog came in Was where you need to go to the brink on"
"8802320","8811240"," debt ceiling Uh the point from the bulls would be this is not bottom We should get one more"
"8811240","8821060"," rollover Um, but if if we're to believe that guy over there Uh, we should probably trade sideways"
"8821060","8827880"," and up until he pauses or cut rate cuts rates Uh, it's plausible historically. "
"8828280","8835880"," It's plausible as well Uh Now the next question becomes are the banks wrapped or the the banks and"
"8835880","8837200"," the fed are partners, right?"
"8838700","8848320"," And there's like two things you should know One will they'll trade it until it breaks And they"
"8848320","8854660"," though they want to see the market cheap They don't want to break the bet their own bank Uh, if"
"8854660","8860100"," they can help it so In their mind they might be like, yeah, you know, we'll do is we'll just"
"8860100","8866720"," trade sideways and up until until the fed cut rates And then we'll crash it And it won't be as"
"8866720","8873400"," damaging as as we anticipated instead of going down to like 1600 For 2100 or 2400."
"8873580","8878740"," We're just gonna go down to like 3000 everybody's happy We crashed very hundred points or thousand"
"8878740","8884620"," points even though that low is Right where we were in may of 2022, right?"
"8884840","8890280"," So 400 points lower not that much lower everybody's happy And they haven't broken something now"
"8890280","8894960"," whether you You don't have to agree with that pause or you don't have to agree that that's what's"
"8894960","8898300"," going to happen Uh, but will they attempt to do something like that?"
"8898560","8903780"," Yeah, they will That's what they do Until they break shit, right?"
"8903920","8905620"," That's how we have had the great financial crisis."
"8905880","8911760"," That's how we had meetings At the federal reserve Telling which banks are going to survive and"
"8911760","8916440"," which banks aren't that's when you had Uh, I think it was bush standing with a bunch of senators"
"8916440","8921640"," and they were saying We can't get shipped on over a weekend and the banks who were springing their"
"8921640","8926620"," ears If you don't we're not going to pay walmart and mcdonald's workers by friday So you got to"
"8926620","8932420"," pass this shit now You have to have a bank bailout like right now urgency, uh, hearing for that,"
"8932420","8932660"," right?"
"8933600","8939920"," so Uh, we know already from previous history that they will run a scam as much as they possibly can"
"8939920","8946880"," Uh, so the bulls have some kind of a point here the bulls have some kind of it's weird too"
"8946880","8948720"," Because the hair bears say weird shit. "
"8949140","8956280"," I'm like, I don't think all bears understand Uh, that what they're saying is not bearish I hear a"
"8956280","8957100"," hair bears out there."
"8957180","8961220"," They're like You know if the fed keeps the fed keeps doing their thing."
"8961320","8966220"," We're gonna we're gonna crash right now and i'm like, oh, that's not Historically what happens?"
"8966920","8973300"," Historically we trade sideways when when the fed like stays the course You actually if you're a"
"8973300","8980520"," bear you want the fed To pause and cut rates you guys know does everybody understand that concept"
"8981240","8986960"," Does everybody out there like crystal clear on that if you're a bear If you want that market"
"8986960","8996920"," bloodbath that generally speaking you want uh you want to pause on rates or uh or a um Reduction of"
"8996920","9013710"," rates rate cut anything like that Yeah,"
"9013710","9018330"," so if you if you check the inversion if you got on your own what you want you to do"
"9019630","9029290"," Is check the inversion historically It doesn't always um It doesn't always so when people bring up"
"9029290","9034210"," the yield inversion i always pisses me off because i'm like If you if you show the yield inversion"
"9034210","9040950"," historically It doesn't actually show the market rolling over every time it snaps back Sometimes"
"9040950","9048410"," the mark continues higher uh matter of fact i'm gonna give a shout out to um Larry Williams because"
"9048410","9053510"," he's the one that pointed out where he said The only one that consistently shows it is the"
"9053510","9056810"," unemployment rate He's like he's like fuck all that other stuff. "
"9056910","9064050"," He's like the unemployment rate is the only one That shows a true market bottom That's that's the"
"9064050","9069010"," only one now if the yield inversions is at that same time period then that's what you're looking"
"9069010","9075330"," for And he's correct if he goes back if you go back historically, you'll see the feds cut rates Uh,"
"9075370","9077150"," sometimes we have a yield curve in versions."
"9077330","9088900"," Sometimes we don't Yeah,"
"9089000","9093400"," so when you like look at the yield of version against spx And e you can even tell the fed"
"9093400","9097400"," fund rate in there It doesn't always it doesn't always signify that we're ever going to hit a bot"
"9097400","9103180"," or having another rollover You really with that with stating that yield inversion that's looming in"
"9103180","9109140"," the distance You want to see the fed fund rate cut but the other piece of that puzzle Is uh"
"9109140","9115720"," the unemployment rate rise Uh, you you want to see that the unemployment rate rise if you're a bear"
"9116500","9121760"," You're a bear you want to see unemployment rate rise fed fund rate pause and cut You want to see"
"9121760","9129360"," a yield curve inversion Spouts and head higher not consolidate sideways You want to see it go up?"
"9152140","9159240"," He's gonna I don't Winky or any you guys know when um Um Know which video it was where he"
"9159240","9161240"," went over that Because he's right."

"9169140","9173200"," I'm like i'm gonna look at unemployment rate the fed funds rate I'm gonna look at the front running"
"9173200","9173700"," of that."
"9173700","9180060"," So when you hear when you hear like smart bears and know what they're talking about They want to"
"9180060","9181280"," see the fed pause."
"9181640","9187960"," They want to see the fed cut rates You'll more than likely see a rip higher for liquidity and then"
"9187960","9197880"," we're we're fucking blasting down Yeah,"
"9197960","9199020"," he knows what he's talking about. "
"9199240","9205940"," He's he's hella fucking smart when it comes to uh macro conditions He can point it out."
"9206080","9213100"," He can show you He can show you that we're likely going sideways and up this year likely And and"
"9213100","9220500"," all probability unless of course you hear at some point the fed pull like we're pausing Something"
"9220500","9227520"," like that And he's any whisper and he's any part of that and it's funny because j-pow Is public"

"9257840","9263300"," course The equity market's gonna go sideways and up and you know that And that pisses him off of"
"9263300","9281380"," course Because the equity market's getting smarter You Eurocross"

"9576470","9588750"," like Is that's not 2400 that's not 1400 so So So"
"9588750","9596600"," we would truly have to have something break No, it can show it to you."

"9708690","9713710"," Yeah, I was saying that uh q2 we were down to 18.65, but I had a different different chart"
"9713710","9761600"," to show it much lower Hold on a second here Yeah,"
"9761700","9771330"," so this isn't the right one, but here's one from back in may And And you can see here"
"9771330","9781210"," this 2020 we hit 16.6 In March of 2022 and I know we were down here like"
"9781210","9788770"," 14 at some point Yes, it makes sure it's the forward forward 12 month PE ratio of 16 6 on"
"9788770","9795370"," may 12 Uh, that's the that's the real low that we had right there so we're at 16.6 at"
"9795370","9804860"," one point So you figure the the low so at 12 here is the is the march 2020 low"
"9806020","9810900"," Is 12 And where did that puts us at?"
"9811580","9815040"," Is that that maybe this might be down at 2200 right?"
"9815400","9828990"," I remember correctly Look and see Yes,"
"9829070","9838890"," that's 218 So 218 which are 2019 21 2200 would put us at"
"9838890","9848760"," 12 Some I'm mistaken So maybe 14 puts let me we'll put back on that chart"
"9848760","9861300"," and see where 14 is I thought 14 was at 3000 A second"
"9861300","9871530"," here Yeah,"

"9988530","9991870"," 135 is what they want to sell if you guys were here this morning I went I gave you guys"
"9991870","9993250"," an idea of what to expect. "
"9993450","10005830"," I think last friday I gave it to At 135 the next five trading sessions to expect that Yeah"
"10005830","10017520"," Yeah, so This morning I did a whole tesla Um Did"
"10017520","10028020"," a whole tesla thing this morning Uh, you're looking for So"
"10028020","10034340"," nothing's changed since last week Uh, I think it gave you one two three four five next five trading"

"10045480","10054380"," Somewhere in here if you can break above this Hold this level Uh and consolidate you should get a"
"10054380","10057280"," squeeze ready You guys ready?"
"10059760","10069080"," 196 all right up here 196 you need to you need to break above"
"10069080","10078700"," And that would be your target above from there Very simple If"
"10078700","10086400"," at any point you give up the hourly you're going to uh You're going to reverse force here Um, and"
"10086400","10095200"," here's the hourly it's coming underneath just want to break above The hourly and move higher So"
"10095200","10103970"," something like that Your target is I think one eight one thirty five eighty nine it changes every"
"10103970","10121860"," day, but it's right in here And you"
"10121860","10126540"," just all you're trying to do is get to one the the polls have two things to worry about They"
"10126540","10132280"," don't want to change our early trend and they sure as shit don't want to change daily trend You can"
"10132280","10133220"," see it right here, right?"
"10133820","10143680"," There it is See it Do that is right there Bulls need to get above"
"10143680","10151740"," that big blue line right there You need to get here get above it and hold it If bulls can"
"10151740","10158560"," get above this big blue line The next target is 196 So if you want to go out there and"
"10158560","10166980"," tell tell your bull friends and stuff Price target above I think it was 135 78 or something 135"
"10166980","10173120"," something like that 135 78 You want to hit that target you want to get above it You want to"
"10173120","10180060"," consolidate and your next move higher believe it or not is 196 way up there Way if you get that"
"10180060","10186440"," kind of if you get that kind of momentum and the market doesn't roll over It's going to blast off"
"10187920","10189820"," You can also use this for target."
"10190120","10194540"," Let's say for friday you get up there And if you're a bear say we're going to start reversing"
"10194540","10204160"," course here and it's just another just another Bear rally and we hit we start to head lower at that"
"10204160","10217500"," point Kind of all matches up doesn't it Kind of all matches up Kind"
"10217500","10242500"," of kind of all fits the the drill So"
"10248610","10254010"," When will it get there it should get there by friday it should get to one so when I did"
"10254010","10264170"," this originally right so On thursday of last week I charted this out and said The"
"10264170","10271450"," next five sessions you should get to 135 So you would you would take a call spread from the low"
"10271450","10281360"," from last thursday Right Right here"
"10285430","10296230"," One two three four five Right I expect the next five sessions for us to trade to"
"10296230","10302270"," 135 Price target as long as no failure of already trying to think of me that on thursday that video"
"10306340","10314500"," That's what I made this video right down here Okay, so what's the next question, but if we get the"
"10314500","10323200"," 135 break above how long until 196 now that is a good question Because I'm going to assume That"
"10323200","10333000"," this somewhat corresponds to that 406 number And that's also going to um Be a point"
"10333000","10338360"," where the market's either going to get sold by jpm or we break above and out of the negative"
"10338360","10345320"," channel What do we say about what do we say about these zones up here You say don't ever mess"
"10345320","10352160"," around in here right You wait for to break lower or to break higher to take the position right So"

"10411800","10418560"," distribution and if we distribute Uh, we'll know it This is actually an easier thing to track right"
"10418560","10418780"," here."
"10419380","10426240"," You can actually look When we get up here, you can look at the calls and puts And find out"

"12654870","12659970"," 32 to 39 cents or 40 cents right here."
"12661490","12663250"," Looking for $3.99 above."

"12665890","12666930"," Looking for a squeeze."
"12666930","12676910"," So what's going on here is so you guys can see is one of squeezing here."

"12706230","12708990"," We are now trading above the five minute EMA. "
"12710130","12711810"," And we're going to take this higher."
"12716780","12717520"," Bullish here."
"12718380","12730270"," You can"
"12730270","12731310"," raise this up a little bit. "

"12801920","12803120"," Bears aren't going to want to give this up."
"12803960","12806240"," They're going to attempt to throw this back under."
"12812130","12813470"," No shame in taking profit. "
"12816150","12817510"," You can see on book map."
"12827140","12829500"," Bears don't want to give this zone up here."
"12829700","12830960"," Once they do, we start squeezing. "
"12845430","12846570"," Yeah, Omar knows."
"12848390","12852630"," What we need to do is need to need to break above here at a minimum consolidate."
"12853290","12855010"," And then you get to squeeze something like that. "
"12855790","12859850"," Definitely don't want to see bears come in here and throw this back down because we will roll and"
"12859850","12860310"," go lower."
"12861050","12862830"," We'll retest the lows from earlier."
"12870050","12871550"," We'll see if the bulls have it. "
"12872710","12875070"," We had some buyers step in right back here."

"12978100","12980180"," Even if we squeeze here, I'm happy enough."
"12980580","12982020"," There's not much money going around. "
"12982200","12984340"," There's not a ton of fucking money in the options market right now."
"12988220","12988620"," Yeah."
"12988940","12992300"," If bears can't push this down, there's likely a squeeze in here. "
"12998220","13002080"," If I can make 20, 30, 20, 30% in the day and day like today, I'm happy."
"13002080","13005100"," The fucking trade though today was right on the fucking open."

"13070460","13072640"," So I get my rocket ship memes out."
"13073860","13076320"," I might need to get my rocket ship memes out. "

"13080320","13081500"," Let me break them out for fin to it."
"13089250","13090050"," Hold on."
"13097600","13100960"," Let me let me let me line them up in case we get a squeeze here. "
"13154890","13156230"," This is kind of it right here."
"13156690","13159590"," If we reject right here, you know, we're going down."
"13170180","13172080"," It's kind of this kind of the place right here. "
"13175220","13181570"," Yeah, right here."
"13181770","13184890"," So you're going to see capitulation by bears or bulls somewhere in here."
"13185770","13186350"," Here, let me. "
"13190850","13192830"," So let's just look at this right here, right."
"13194550","13196670"," Do a simple five minute chart."
"13199930","13204070"," And you can see this, you can see these, you know, if we, if we win on the five minute,"
"13204070","13204350"," right. "
"13204910","13206390"," We're going to get a nice move higher."
"13207250","13212670"," You can see right now that we lost the five minute early."
"13212850","13216050"," We traded up hit resistance, sold it down through the five minute, right?"
"13217050","13219150"," We found some buyers down below here, right?"
"13219370","13220670"," Some, some demand, right?"
"13220810","13221390"," They pushed it up. "
"13222450","13224610"," Bears came back in, pushed down, said, hell no."
"13225690","13227850"," Then we got demand at a higher price, right?"
"13227970","13229530"," So we had a higher low, right?"
"13229770","13230390"," So you can see that."
"13230650","13233530"," Get a low higher low. "
"13235230","13237290"," And you want to see this hold here, right?"
"13237430","13240130"," You want to see demand come up."
"13241770","13243610"," Demand come up and demand come up."
"13244250","13249070"," Now, at the same time, these bears, these sellers know that they'll get squeezed here, right?"
"13251450","13253610"," You can see that they came down and sold it. "
"13253730","13254770"," They came down and sold it."
"13254890","13257390"," And so we have a fight going on in the market right now, right?"
"13258410","13261330"," And so you have this confluence with these moving averages."
"13262190","13264530"," And this is a big, a big fight right now. "
"13265450","13266910"," So who's going to win, right?"
"13267090","13269830"," So do the sellers win here or do the buyers win?"
"13270770","13275230"," We know in a weekly that as a bull, we want to buy down here."
"13275370","13276830"," We want to buy down here like three."
"13276830","13279750"," Today, it's 395 26, I think. "
"13280170","13281970"," We want to buy this for a weekly call."
"13283290","13287810"," You know, but as far as the day goes, you have to find out who owns right now, right?"
"13288290","13290470"," The bear zone us or to the bull zone us."
"13291470","13293870"," So we're going to find out right here in the five minute. "
"13293870","13299230"," The oil process will remain volatile because supported by constraints supply in 2023."
"13301270","13305570"," You know, because you know that if we, if the bulls win this here, right, it's going to squeeze."
"13306530","13310490"," Without a doubt, declining, declining resistance. "
"13311730","13312830"," So we'll see what happens here."
"13331050","13333350"," There's like hell no, you're not squeezing me out."

"13952560","13953880"," I'll do it right now for you, bro. "
"13960250","13961290"," Holy shit, Mike."
"13961530","13962190"," Oh, my God."
"13962270","13962890"," Morgan Stanley. "
"13964190","13965410"," What are you doing, Morgan Stanley?"
"13971440","13973600"," Morgan Stanley is cranking right now."
"13984460","13985560"," Dude, Morgan Stanley."
"13990310","13992610"," Mike Wilson ain't selling shit right now, is he?"
"14003320","14008100"," Seeing that the US and the European Union sign a tariff rate quote to agreements. "
"14014100","14014820"," Oh, dude."
"14015080","14017700"," So, uh, they're way outside of their, um."
"14019960","14024180"," Just seeing more commentary out of Moody's, you say that alternatively, economic resilience in the"
"14024180","14026900"," US and Europe stronger than expected post. "
"14027060","14028140"," They're way above their expected."
"14028580","14030980"," Well, high oil prices."
"14033560","14034700"," Tank tight here. "
"14039460","14040260"," It's a winky."
"14040380","14041720"," They're way outside of their expected move."
"14042460","14042880"," Um. "
"14047020","14050560"," Next target above the next target above 101 18."
"14052480","14054720"," Uh, 109 73."
"14056100","14058300"," And then 136 91. "
"14059700","14069740"," Uh, levels below 98.45. That's their one month high there, 13"
"14069740","14070300"," week high."
"14070300","14077200"," Uh, 96 71 is when they broke above their third visit, their, uh, third pivot."
"14078160","14079520"," I don't know if that helps. "
"14080620","14087740"," And you know what else is crazy is they just did there at 95 34 MS just beat their 61 "
"14087740","14089380",".8% retracement."
"14089800","14092840"," So they're likely to go to their 100% at some point."
"14094980","14099340"," So if 95 34 61.8%, there's a light, high chance of them. "
"14100040","14104900"," Uh, coming down and then heading up to, uh, whatever the 100% is."
"14106520","14107240"," Fucking crazy."
"14115350","14119430"," Let me, uh, let me do some of the background for you, for you there. "
"14125560","14126020"," Damn."
"14126020","14131440"," And that's just crazy right now."
"14141530","14142230"," Think tight. "
"14142350","14143470"," No, I'll try to give you some."
"14143630","14145630"," I'll try to snap some levels here for you right now."
"14145750","14149550"," 96 71. "
"14174150","14174590"," Yeah."
"14174810","14178470"," So they're trying to create a support level there at 96 71 winky."
"14182750","14187050"," Um, they've done it so far, right?"
"14187050","14191170"," And the other key points here. "
"14191350","14197070"," Winky is that they've, uh, they've broken their 61.8% fit level."
"14197070","14201530"," So, um, think tight here."
"14211180","14213480"," They left a giant gap behind too. "
"14215920","14221920"," They left the gap from 91 76 to 95 dollars."
"14222580","14227840"," Um, but they're more than likely going to retrace the entire move to 106 74."
"14228120","14229780"," There's a high, there's a high probability of it. "
"14232020","14239440"," Even if they retrace to 96.74, there's a, let's see what, where's the 61% at?"
"14243640","14244680"," 95 34."
"14246300","14248840"," You don't want to sell unless you get underneath that number."
"14255230","14256030"," Holy shit. "
"14269290","14269690"," Careful."
"14269870","14270010"," Yeah."
"14270270","14270850"," Uh, winky. "
"14271170","14277690"," So when they, so when it, when it's stuck, typically breaks above at 61.8%, it'll easily go to it"
"14277690","14278630"," 70 or 100."
"14279830","14285470"," Even if it comes back to retest, if you look on, uh, if you look on MS right now on"
"14285470","14291190"," like, uh, not, I would do the five minute chart, maybe you do like a five minute chart at MS."
"14291190","14299350"," If you stop a line at 96.74 and then maybe one at 95 and some change 95, um, 34."
"14301470","14305370"," Um, 95 34. "
"14306870","14309790"," I'd be looking for a continuation there."
"14311490","14312710"," Like somewhere in there."
"14312930","14315750"," I'd be looking for like at a minimum. "
"14315750","14333590"," Uh, yeah."
"14356630","14358590"," So they just hit their 78%."
"14361110","14371080"," Um, 95"
"14371080","14372340"," is right here. "
"14373860","14378710"," I'll change the colors of this stuff."
"14378710","14388710"," Um, these"
"14435210","14437030"," guys are beasts right now."
"14438950","14480520"," And they"
"14480520","14482080"," already had the retest down here. "
"14482280","14485320"," So you can see the retest already happened."
"14485780","14486660"," Retest of the yellow."
"14488420","14488760"," Powerful. "
"14496800","14505910"," Look at these volume bars right"
"14505910","14512530"," here."
"14512530","14513590"," Just pumping."
"14531980","14533240"," Just straight pumping. "
"14540520","14541200"," Pumping baby."
"14545400","14550120"," Yeah, I don't, um, no, I don't think you, I don't think you need to just yet."
"14551140","14556000"," You could sell like 95 or 96 somewhere in there, but. "
"14557960","14560620"," Oh, you bought them for, uh, you bought them at what?"
"14567040","14568400"," Right on gum grubster."
"14568700","14569880"," Yeah, there's likely."
"14570700","14571580"," There's like the higher. "
"14571700","14575600"," Once you start breaking that hot, when you start breaking like the six to one point eight, you're"
"14575600","14576820"," likely going to 100."
"14577120","14583340"," So, uh, the 70 is wordy at the 70, which you'd expect."
"14584160","14585600"," And, uh, any retest. "
"14586780","14590780"," I'm going to bet you that it goes back to to the 100 at some point."
"14591040","14592100"," They're retraced the entire move."
"14592100","14595040"," Not always, but there's a high probability of it. "
"14598550","14599150"," Yeah."
"14603150","14604550"," That probably lines up."
"14606510","14607250"," Damn it. "
"14615840","14618320"," I got the office heat on too high again."
"14620540","14623200"," I got my office heat on too high."
"14624040","14625120"," It's overheating my camera. "
"14625520","14626500"," Camera's all hot and sweaty."
"14629780","14630620"," Come on."
"14634560","14636980"," I had like, I had the heat out of my office just. "
"14637320","14647180"," Yeah, as long as they hold"
"14647180","14651460"," like, as long as they hold that 96 one to 95 three."
"14654540","14656940"," Um, somewhere in there, it's going to be good."
"14657680","14664920"," Uh, dude, my fucking calls are just, they're just sitting there. "
"14671620","14673800"," So your position is 45 right on."
"14676860","14679740"," Now they, they, uh, they hit the 70."
"14680060","14680880"," You guys want to see that?"
"14681100","14681660"," That they hit the 70?"
"14683620","14688360"," Um, they already hit the 70. "
"14689700","14690140"," So."
"14694050","14694930"," Look at that."
"14695610","14696050"," Jesus. "
"14698650","14699610"," They get that wrong."
"14699730","14700490"," Maybe I got that wrong."
"14700630","14700930"," I don't know. "
"14709110","14711050"," Yeah, it's 78.6 right there."
"14715530","14717890"," There's 106 right here at a percent retracement."
"14721210","14723110"," So it blasted right through like nothing. "
"14723890","14731950"," Uh, so once you get through the 61.8 right here, like, uh, your probabilities of going up and"
"14731950","14733230"," closing this are quite high."
"14735130","14741850"," Uh, it's not showing those boxes down below here, but even if it pulled back, you can see on the,"
"14741850","14747890"," on the, um, 61% 61.8 fucking hate having repeat these numbers."
"14748410","14754110"," So like at 61, uh, you saw that they built a base here. "
"14754330","14755150"," They tested it."
"14755150","14756450"," Oh, I see what you're saying."
"14756450","14757230"," I see what you're saying. "
"14757390","14759910"," Now, um, whoever made that post."
"14765490","14775250"," I wonder if James, I wonder if James, uh, James,"
"14775250","14776490"," James texted me earlier."
"14778510","14780630"," Maybe he's maybe that's why he has a text to back. "
"14780650","14781950"," He's probably trading it right now."
"14785290","14786910"," This is killing me right here."
"14787690","14788930"," This is bullshit. "
"14799290","14801190"," Yeah, it's been, it's been an hour."
"14801450","14803130"," So now we got it."
"14803250","14804610"," This is kind of like a do or die situation. "
"14804890","14809930"," So we started this about an hour ago and we need to see this happen right now."
"14814170","14815990"," James just said forgot to call back."
"14818010","14818870"," All right. "
"14818950","14821830"," James, if you're listening, are you, are you trading AMC right now?"

"14864410","14865850"," This is killing me."
"14865850","14870030"," I fucking hate dealers. "
"14874540","14875640"," Give me the money."

"16068240","16073260"," And I can't can't be a part of that."
"16074420","16077080"," But I get it."
"16077400","16078120"," I mean, I understand. "

"16942530","16946490"," percent of Americans believe it or not that haven't left their home state or region. "
"16947670","16951350"," There's a large percentage of Americans have never left the US."
"16953150","16961770"," And then there's a very small percentage of US citizens have traveled outside of tourist zones in"
"16961770","16962290"," other countries."
"16962850","16968190"," EIA says the US Navy and food out in February, but in February, due to rise the highest on record. "
"16979490","16982030"," Yeah, it's if you've done that."
"16982810","16986590"," You know, then you see the reality of the rest of the world versus the US."
"16986950","16990890"," No, no, it's not all the world, but a large percentage of it. "
"17000000","17002760"," Yeah, who rules the way as rules, that's absolutely true."

"17290570","17293610"," Do you guys all understand why Microsoft wants it?"
"17293610","17298690"," And Google wants it or Google wants some form of AI. "
"17301150","17303530"," Do you guys know what's going on with Dungeons and Dragons?"
"17304410","17306390"," Any guys play D&D out there?"
"17314030","17316410"," To farm Hotmail accounts and build models."
"17317690","17320950"," They're going to use chat GPT to sell certifications."
"17327710","17329070"," You're an old school D&D player. "
"17332270","17334190"," Did they backtrack it?"
"17334390","17339170"," I heard that they backtracked it and then I heard late last night that they went full tilt."
"17339890","17341130"," Full bore yesterday."
"17342750","17343830"," Paizo went against. "
"17345050","17347750"," And then I guess last late last night some shit came out again."
"17352730","17356490"," I ended up playing a couple of winters ago with a group."
"17358150","17360430"," And I wasn't happy in the group, so I stopped. "
"17361770","17363830"," And then I played it with my kids on and off."
"17364350","17368310"," I feel like when they like fake snow days, stuff like that."
"17375250","17375870"," Jay Money. "
"17376550","17377250"," Wait a minute."
"17377350","17380390"," They tell us about the threat of Mother Russia and look at how well it's gone."
"17380390","17382370"," Yeah, it's such a scam, isn't it?"
"17382630","17383050"," Jay Money. "
"17391000","17392740"," Yeah, it's owned by Hasbro."
"17394240","17403600"," They want to, they basically want to have AI based game masters, GMs. And they want to keep it all"
"17403600","17409000"," on a virtual tabletop role play. "
"17409900","17411040"," This is Hasbro, right?"
"17411580","17415540"," Now, of course, they don't want to, they've got an ER coming up."
"17415640","17417880"," I think on February 16 to 21."
"17419080","17420960"," So they don't want it to look bad. "
"17421100","17423340"," It came out was on CNBC finally the other day."
"17424460","17429200"," And the idea would be that they're going to, I think last night they came out and said they would"
"17429200","17431300"," charge $30 a month per person."
"17431980","17433060"," Everything would be virtual. "
"17433460","17437540"," It'd be like if you wanted to get like a special sword or something, you'd have to pay for it"
"17437540","17438180"," like an add on."
"17438180","17442620"," It's the micro transaction concept."
"17445080","17451200"," And then the whole other thing Winky is talking about where you would own your content over a"
"17451200","17452020"," certain amount of money. "
"17452600","17456140"," And it would also dissuade small content creators from create."
"17456480","17457820"," There's this other part of it."
"17458140","17464740"," Winky that's kind of fucked up is that it only affects right now would only affect large content"
"17464740","17465380"," producers. "
"17467900","17476220"," There's like an open gaming license where there's an unspoken rule of an open gaming license where"
"17476220","17478740"," you can create content and get paid for it."
"17479520","17482560"," For all your hard work and the content that you produce, right?"
"17483080","17490640"," And then, well, they're trying to change that, that license for people that make over $750,000 a"
"17490640","17490740"," year."
"17490860","17492860"," I think that's what the initial thing was. "
"17493680","17494800"," And that you don't own it."
"17494900","17495720"," They can take it away from you whenever."
"17496120","17497640"," They have exclusive rights to it. "
"17497740","17498360"," Blah, blah, blah."
"17499820","17507040"," But they were also saying that it would stifle new content creators for Dungeons and Dragons from"
"17507040","17515560"," trying to become like a, who are the, I feel like the guys are called to do the live show"
"17515560","17516060"," on YouTube."
"17516720","17517420"," Critical role. "
"17517440","17519080"," So like you wouldn't want to become them."
"17519240","17523380"," So it's stifle new developments in the Dungeons and Dragons community."
"17534190","17539330"," Yeah, it's kind of crazy because the whole, well, not, there are lonely people out there that'll"
"17539330","17540370"," play D and D online. "
"17540610","17543310"," I'm sure there's like a, there's a, there's a place for that."
"17544370","17551710"," For people to play online D and D, but the whole concept of it is that you play that game."
"17551950","17552990"," So you guys want to know we're going to do here. "
"17552990","17559640"," I'm assuming it's still the same garbage."
"17559640","17560100"," Right."
"17561400","17565220"," So we're looking for a weekly low of 395 ish. "
"17566780","17567680"," To buy."
"17569380","17576760"," If we can get down here at any point to be a nice place to buy some weekly calls to"
"17576760","17579500"," cash out sometime before Thursday, like Wednesday close."
"17584540","17589500"," I'm going to expect futures to get bought if we have all these puts coming into the market. "
"17590240","17594880"," Some of the matters where we, it matters, not matters if we were ever trade down here into the"
"17594880","17601240"," close here and be buying calls for, for Thursday or Friday calls than cash amount on Wednesday."
"17601820","17605280"," We'll see where we get here into the bell if we can get down here and be happy."
"17611300","17613810"," Well, they, yeah, so that's what someone else was saying there. "
"17614260","17617640"," So they're saying that Hasbro is doing this now because they're pissed off."
"17618820","17619540"," So they were."
"17619660","17622040"," So how this all began, I guess was. "
"17623160","17625120"," About a decade ago they had."
"17627180","17631980"," Dungeons and Dragons fourth edition and they were trying to go that route back then."
"17631980","17636460"," And they got a bunch of blowback from the community. "
"17636760","17638060"," So then they ran with five E."
"17638780","17644020"," And five E focused more on players being able to do whatever they wanted to do."
"17644240","17646560"," And then when, when, when, when COVID happened."
"17647620","17649520"," They were like shit, we should have. "
"17650260","17651920"," But heavy focus on this."
"17652640","17653100"," On this."
"17654400","17658680"," They had, they haven't, they had an online Dungeons and Dragons before. "
"17659320","17662500"," But it was, I think it was called role 20, but it could be wrong."
"17663160","17666880"," It might not be role 20, but I think that might have been just a, I don't know if role"
"17666880","17667400"," 20 was."
"17668120","17670180"," A support group or something, but anyway, it doesn't matter. "
"17670320","17672700"," What matters is that they weren't able to capitalize."
"17673200","17677000"," They left money on the table as they said during COVID."
"17677660","17681300"," And so now they want to capitalize on that, but you're, like, you're losing the part of the, the"
"17681300","17682480"," gaming experience. "
"17682480","17688160"," What it's about, you know, like players don't buy a bunch of material, but the Dungeon Masters,"
"17688240","17689240"," Game Masters do."
"17690340","17695820"," And, and they don't make money off of producing adventures and stuff."
"17696600","17702140"," So that's left to, you know, just people on the street to do. "
"17702620","17705520"," And so are not not the Hasbro toy company."
"17705720","17706580"," It's not where they make their money."
"17707720","17715540"," Now, but then they see individuals like Critical Role and Matt Mercer making money off of"
"17715540","17715820"," adventures. "
"17716240","17719420"," And they're like, we don't want that guy making a million dollars off of his adventures or"
"17719420","17719640"," whatever."
"17719980","17721080"," We want all that in-house."
"17721220","17721680"," We want it all. "
"17724060","17728700"," The crazy part is this whole gaming system is based upon you getting together with some friends."
"17729360","17736380"," Drinking a beer and, and playing games together, not doing it online."
"17737200","17742140"," And if you wanted to play video games, you can play them already, right?"
"17742360","17748900"," There's already a system of video games, video game systems already out there for you to play. "
"17749700","17755600"," And there's already, believe it or not, Dungeons and Dragons AI games out there."
"17755600","17761880"," So if you wanted to play Dungeons and Dragons with you some friends or with, if you've never played"
"17761880","17767780"," Dungeons and Dragons, you can actually go on and get an AI that'll GM or DM an entire game for"
"17767780","17771400"," you with you and your friends."
"17771840","17780320"," Even by yourself alone, you can run a game or have an AI run a game for you as a"
"17780320","17780520"," player. "
"17788740","17791080"," Yeah, I've heard that, I heard that argument this week too."
"17792980","17798480"," Yeah, so if you're bored right now, you just go on to, if you're bored right now, go on to"
"17798480","17801520"," YouTube and just look up like D&D OGL."
"17802620","17810100"," Also look up Paizo because Paizo and Pathfinder, there's a bunch of drama with that with attorneys"
"17810100","17817980"," that we're working on on an O.G. Agreements years ago, this whole, this whole stuff thing's been"
"17817980","17821600"," going on for like a decade, but it's like big drama right now in the gaming community. "
"17827260","17828860"," Yeah, that's true right about Nintendo."
"17832460","17837400"," And you know, you know, it's funny as I was going down the rabbit hole the other day, talking about"
"17837400","17842060"," talking about magic the gathering cards."
"17842740","17852560"," So a bunch of years ago, some guy on some guy on Reddit went to a magic the gathering, get"
"17852560","17859380"," together or whatever, like a big game with like a hundred dudes in there, a hundred in cells in"
"17859380","17859560"," there. "
"17860280","17863640"," And he took pictures of everybody with their butt crack showing."
"17864260","17869360"," He took like an album full of them and he posted them on Reddit and he got banned."
"17870600","17874920"," But of course the pictures have been saved to internet history and somebody post reposted them the"
"17874920","17881120"," other day showing all of the butt crack pictures from magic the gathering saying take a shower, you"
"17881120","17883180"," know, and pull your pants up when you go to one of these things. "
"17885760","17891620"," Yeah, the ass crack pictures where the guy is like, the guy's got his like this that is chin."
"17892460","17896780"," And then he's like doing the poses behind every player at the at the magic the gathering."
"17896780","17897340"," It was hilarious. "
"17897760","17898400"," I just saw it yesterday."
"17899500","17903660"," And it was one of the funniest fucking three things I haven't seen it in years."
"17908080","17911880"," Oh, I shouldn't say in cell. "
"17912180","17912960"," They were not in cells."
"17913280","17913480"," They were."
"17914860","17915520"," What do they cut?"
"17915760","17920080"," Who's the big guy that does Malady and all that stuff with the with the fedora with the guy that"
"17920080","17921520"," wears the fedora and says Malady. "
"17921520","17923460"," One house in a company to come."
"17923600","17926480"," She had a very productive."
"17926820","17927460"," I'm sorry. "
"17928740","17930500"," Probably inappropriate to say that."
"17932840","17936040"," Who who wears the who has the who does the Malady shit?"
"17939710","17940870"," Is that a beta male?"
"17941290","17941350"," Okay."
"17947720","17949000"," Is that in cells?"
"17949460","17949480"," Okay. "
"17949800","17951000"," I don't know who I don't know."
"17953560","17955360"," They stole the fedora from atheists."
"17957060","17965920"," Mm, lady. "
"17966280","17966760"," That was funny."
"17968280","17968840"," Neckbeards."
"17969040","17969660"," That's who they are. "
"17970400","17971360"," That's who they are."
"17971700","17973420"," Not in cells, not beta males."
"17973760","17974500"," They're neckbeards. "
"17975200","17976040"," That's who they were."
"17980580","17981460"," It's neckbeards."
"17981640","17982260"," That's who they are. "
"17982860","17983280"," Neckbeards."
"17983860","17985460"," Just some guy remembers who they were."
"17986080","17990620"," Campbell says Biden raised issue of export controls on China with Japan's Kushida. "
"17998910","17999550"," It's like that."
"17999770","18002930"," It's like someone putting their hand on your neck and holding your neck and you're like, wait,"
"18003170","18004070"," whoa, hold up, man."
"18004890","18006070"," Your hand off my neck. "
"18008050","18008850"," It's neckbeards."
"18012730","18014810"," Neckbeards are cool within cells and beta males."
"18025540","18027120"," Yeah, can you can you shit on?"
"18028500","18030580"," Yeah, I think that guy made the point too. "
"18030620","18033920"," He was like, we don't I think that when that whole when those pictures drop the guy was like,"

"18592990","18593470"," Brutal. "
"18593470","18598170"," We started homeschooling when she graduated."
"18598970","18601110"," So she's homeschooled well she homeschooled before."
"18601850","18603990"," And then she went to private school and then she homeschooled. "
"18604190","18605070"," She's been homeschooling since."
"18606350","18613510"," And part of the reason whether we homeschool is because we don't like what happens with kids and"
"18613510","18614690"," with each other in school."
"18615590","18621450"," Like a small secondary reason is because they don't like the brutality of kids to each other. "
"18634120","18638120"," Yeah I met some I was in a bar and I met a kid that was laying con or working"
"18638120","18639940"," on a concrete crew for the state recently."

"18676570","18679030"," But if you're trying to get that private."
"18681150","18687310"," Trying to get that private quality of homeschooling secular is the way to go."
"18689170","18692570"," And if your child does not have learning disabilities. "
"18695910","18699990"," Or you're not a religious you can or even if you are religious but keep it separate."
"18700910","18702750"," Because my religion this is my schooling."
"18704170","18706290"," And you keep it with a secular group. "
"18708270","18709330"," And you're in your in your."
"18710170","18713850"," There are homeschoolers that if you have a."

"18729410","18730910"," Find a group that's like you."
"18731490","18737110"," Number one and then number two try to keep it secular and number three make sure that at a minimum. "
"18738070","18742550"," You have online in front of a teacher and then it wasn't built for covid."
"18745610","18750270"," We have computers you have live classrooms they know other kids."
"18750990","18753270"," In their classrooms and then that there are meetups. "
"18753910","18758790"," So that you can get involved in groups where you meet up at this one science thing and this art"
"18758790","18761230"," thing and this music thing they have dances they've got."
"18761770","18767670"," Some states have really good programs that the state puts together."
"18768190","18773570"," According to FTX trading they identified about five spot five billion dollars of liquid assets to"
"18773570","18777570"," date confirmed material shortfalls at both international and US exchanges. "
"18778510","18782830"," Yeah you have so we have to like we have to take our kids out to socialize."
"18783670","18788690"," We have to make sure that they understand their concepts like so every night."
"18789970","18792370"," We're spent my wife spends hours every night. "
"18793010","18797610"," Once or twice a week I'm with my kids ever every week asking them questions do this."
"18797810","18801570"," I just spent a week talking my daughter about PSAT's."
"18802750","18806070"," You have to take them out places you got to take them out for sports you got to take them"
"18806070","18807210"," out for all this stuff. "
"18808190","18810870"," They have to be with other kids."
"18817720","18822860"," Yeah that's the only other thing that we've had are probably our largest struggle in high school"
"18822860","18827320"," with our oldest is that you have to do experiments with them in person."
"18828160","18833260"," That kind of stuff anything they don't get from especially labs labs are a big thing. "
"18835420","18839880"," But she just took her PSAT she's blowing out public school kids."
"18840520","18846720"," So you have to if you're if you're going to homeschool I guess the point would be if if your"
"18846720","18848500"," child would do fine in a public school."
"18850100","18856280"," You should leave them there I would say if you're going to send your child to a public school and"
"18856280","18856900"," you think that. "
"18859560","18861760"," I guess this would be the last thing would be."
"18863440","18869460"," And you'll know this if you've been to school you know that some students the one thing about"
"18869460","18871560"," public school is a problem for me at least."
"18872540","18876720"," It's not public it's not teachers fault but you have to understand that. "
"18878540","18887740"," If your child can naturally learn high concepts without much"
"18887740","18889960"," oversight."
"18891000","18892760"," The bull's regaining here."
"18896720","18899540"," Shorts might have closed targets still above. "
"18900560","18904680"," One thing you want to understand is that let's say your child's in a classroom and you get a"
"18904680","18906420"," teacher and the teacher teaches the concept."
"18908360","18917380"," If your child can't absorb that content with the teacher briefly going over it."
"18917380","18923760"," And the child doing the work on their own they could get left behind where otherwise if they had"
"18923760","18928000"," that one on one that one on one time with a teacher they would succeed. "
"18928880","18933380"," Sometimes homeschool is a better idea for you and your child because as a parent you're then"
"18933380","18938440"," required to do that for your child where a teacher is not going to spend an hour or two or"
"18938440","18945400"," three or four helping your child ensuring that they understand concepts as they move forward."
"18946060","18950640"," Sometimes they get left behind you see that you see that like middle school high school."
"18951340","18955220"," When you have your friends from grade school you move into high school and you say we're splitting"
"18955220","18955880"," up in the groups. "
"18957560","18961860"," Oftentimes it's not really that that student couldn't do a good job it's that they didn't have"
"18961860","18963200"," someone always there with them."
"18965340","18969560"," It's a ton of work like no matter when anyone tells you if your homeschool it's brutal."
"18970880","18975700"," Even if you pay for tutors you like tutors you can't pay for enough tutors so you just as a"
"18975700","18981240"," parent you have to always be there in one way or another ensuring that your child along the way"
"18981240","18983240"," understands what's going on. "
"18983800","18988940"," As a parent like you know I was just talking a binky on the phone this morning I was like"
"18988940","18990920"," I have to brush up on pre-calc."
"18991600","18999660"," That's the truth my kid is going to be in pre-calc next year or junior year and I have"
"18999660","19001160"," to make sure that I know pre-calc."

"19016500","19016860"," Yeah."
"19017560","19027510"," I was homeschooled like guys if you go in his homeschool you make sure you're"
"19027510","19031910"," paying attention to them because you are all they have throughout the day and still socialize them. "
"19037310","19045790"," So when it comes to the socializing you have to there's a couple of things you have to do you"
"19045790","19047750"," have to make sure you're socializing your children."
"19047850","19053710"," You have to take them to enroll them in sports, enroll them in music, you have to get them out"
"19053710","19059030"," of the house into play groups and you have to make sure you have that support group of"
"19059030","19061910"," homeschoolers around you that have events."
"19063910","19065990"," You're involved in your child's life. "
"19066350","19067510"," There's no getting around it."
"19071270","19071750"," 100%."

"19086030","19087790"," Yeah got our PhD in a day."
"19088090","19093990"," I'll tell you what it's a you're a there are some benefits."

"19781120","19782600"," As we came in here."
"19783960","19786940"," So what first thing that happened was this we sold market breath. "
"19787700","19787920"," Right."
"19791270","19792130"," Right here."
"19792990","19796350"," But price price didn't go down deep did it. "
"19798380","19800630"," And meanwhile as we were trading sideways."

"19818810","19822210"," Such as real estate most likely to be affected by climate change or energy."

"19832910","19834670"," We started selling breath over here."
"19834810","19837790"," So just just as we trade sideways here."
"19838470","19843650"," You want to see if breath sells or if it rotates into another into another sector. "
"19844370","19847890"," It's important for you to see that as we trade here."

"19865210","19866610"," So keep your eye on the breath."
"19868390","19870010"," As the week trades on. "

"19979590","19980730"," I'm going to buy right into Friday. "
"19981190","19983610"," I don't care if it's today tomorrow."
"19984370","19988430"," I don't care if it's like some we come down here and some bad news."
"19989050","19991170"," I'll buy this for Friday Friday open. "
"19991770","19992730"," If you're a bear."
"19993670","19994850"," You know where it's at."

"20005570","20006670"," Range bound all day long."
"20007490","20008090"," Just like this. "
"20008750","20010650"," So if we're range bound all week long."
"20011290","20014280"," You're looking for those moments where we trade out of range, right?"
"20015580","20020240"," We hit that 403404 trade below range, right?"
"20021020","20024060"," Trade down a 394 so you could actually buy a dip to go up."
"20024500","20025420"," Even if it gets pinned. "
"20026960","20028900"," And that's what this week looks like right now."
"20029680","20030760"," If you're a bear."
"20033360","20036340"," And you're like, well, when do I take a short cap?"
"20041820","20043340"," We'll look right on a daily here. "
"20046130","20047610"," Let me bring up a SPX."
"20054430","20055450"," This will make it easier."
"20056770","20059430"," We got 395 right here, right?"
"20061270","20063270"," We've got 405 right here. "
"20063350","20063970"," We're going to bring this up."
"20064270","20066130"," 403, let's say."
"20067810","20068690"," Or 4065. "
"20068890","20069350"," Let's do 465."
"20071250","20074290"," This is actually where the game is going to things like right here."
"20074730","20075870"," Look at this right in the middle. "
"20083290","20083350"," Right?"
"20086110","20087430"," You see this blue line?"

"20096330","20097290"," See it's trade up. "
"20098410","20099470"," We break below."
"20100610","20101050"," Right?"
"20101450","20101950"," See the test?"
"20102890","20103950"," Come straight back down."
"20106170","20107690"," This is the meat of the trade. "
"20108350","20108910"," Does that make sense?"
"20110050","20113890"," If we're going to roll this market over and bloodbath it down to 380 or lower."
"20115750","20117850"," You're looking for this blue line right here."
"20122440","20123220"," To come up. "
"20125360","20126360"," You're looking for this."
"20126920","20130540"," Believe it or not, you're looking for someone else to sell this right here."
"20131300","20131600"," Right?"
"20132420","20135020"," You're looking for that get underneath and this move lower. "
"20136420","20137020"," Is that?"
"20137160","20138200"," Or maybe not that low, but."
"20139020","20141620"," You get the picture that I'm saying here, right?"
"20141820","20144540"," You're looking for this to roll or hold on."
"20151630","20154270"," You're looking for this for this daily to roll over. "
"20158670","20160210"," You should be checking this every day."
"20160230","20162270"," If this happens in the overnight, we get underneath here."
"20162330","20163170"," You get that rejection. "
"20163970","20166130"," And this is where the meat of the trade is right here."
"20166390","20166910"," Right there."
"20167130","20167650"," Not here. "
"20168710","20168930"," Right?"
"20169070","20170370"," You can take this trade right here."
"20170950","20172610"," You can take this trade right here."
"20173690","20174130"," Right?"
"20174330","20175530"," And you can let off it right here. "
"20175750","20179950"," Or you can just put a put spread on a few months out if you're if you're bearish."
"20181870","20182310"," Right?"
"20182310","20184330"," But the real meat of this trade is underneath."
"20186010","20187210"," This is where the juice is. "
"20187590","20188830"," This is where the money is right here."
"20191750","20193190"," That's where the money is right there."
"20195230","20196410"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"20197210","20199330"," And this hasn't presented itself yet. "
"20204530","20206010"," That hasn't happened yet."
"20206690","20209770"," And you might be like, oh, Kappa, I missed all this money right here."
"20210570","20213870"," But the reality is, they're more than likely to come back up and check that one more time. "
"20213870","20214490"," And then get this."
"20216250","20218230"," So just be conscious of this."
"20220290","20222070"," As time passes. "
"20222530","20223470"," You have time."
"20224490","20226070"," That's all I'm trying to say to you."
"20228570","20230170"," You don't need the entire movie. "
"20230210","20232870"," You just need that sexy, super sexy section of it."
"20236800","20238200"," Hey, I'm Matthew Ryan."
"20238480","20239000"," What's up, brother?"
"20244920","20247440"," Hey, you guys want to be watching breath this week. "
"20247440","20248760"," It's the only way to."
"20249360","20250380"," It's the only way to."
"20250500","20253100"," So, matter of fact, I was talking to Matt Ryan about this last night. "
"20254940","20256320"," So it's easy."
"20257500","20259840"," If you're looking at an individual ticker, right?"
"20260580","20262160"," You can easily see."
"20262940","20265580"," If calls are being bought and puts are being sold. "
"20265840","20270060"," You can easily see if calls are being sold and more calls are being sold."
"20270520","20273300"," You can easily see if puts are being sold and calls are being bought."
"20273300","20278780"," Within the S&P 500 or the DIA or queues. "
"20279820","20281380"," You can't always see it."
"20281760","20288200"," You have to you have to look inside of those indexes at the components of it to see if they're"
"20288200","20289620"," rotating or if they're selling."
"20290040","20294480"," If they're rotating and you're a bear that you're going to have a bad time always every time. "
"20298820","20300400"," So that's your job this week."
"20301980","20303780"," Right is to see if they're rotating."
"20307550","20309030"," Or if they're selling, right?"
"20310050","20310910"," Retail sells. "
"20313130","20313650"," Thanks."
"20313850","20314490"," Take it back up."
"20314490","20316030"," We knew and we went higher. "
"20316470","20317490"," We want to see."
"20318750","20319730"," Does this happen this week."
"20321030","20323010"," And to find out which way we go. "
"20323090","20327530"," We know also know that ball expands as we head into February 1st."
"20329090","20329610"," Right."
"20330210","20331210"," Theta gang knows that. "
"20331730","20332530"," February 1st."
"20332670","20333090"," We start to get."
"20333210","20334970"," It actually looks more like this. "
"20336990","20337870"," Into well."
"20338230","20338830"," Right there."
"20338950","20340110"," And then you start to see the vol expansion. "
"20341130","20342730"," As we head into February right there."
"20345660","20346440"," Yeah, it's something."
"20346920","20348120"," It's more like this. "
"20350920","20351780"," More like this."
"20352080","20353840"," They're expecting this move into the first."
"20354340","20356740"," And then explosive move up higher or lower. "
"20356980","20360780"," This is the time for you as a trader though to be watching this next next week and a half,"
"20360860","20361140"," two weeks."
"20362240","20363140"," See what's happening."
"20367400","20368180"," Yeah, you guys. "
"20368180","20374580"," As big in Japan, I expected to trades out literally trade sideways up and down ping pong until the"
"20374580","20374800"," first."
"20379500","20383740"," Matter of fact, I'll put a post on Twitter for you at the end of today."
"20383840","20390020"," I'll post something on Twitter about it, but I'm not expecting the want the end to. "
"20391940","20394160"," To make a powerful move in the next week or two."
"20394600","20397180"," I expect it to consolidate next next week to weeks."
"20398460","20408780"," And I'm"
"20408780","20412480"," building a better market breath indicator for you right now. "
"20412660","20416040"," So you're going to have, you're going to have a nice market breath indicator, a better one."
"20429610","20431690"," Oh, that apple almost hit that PT."
"20433070","20436550"," And just so you know, an apple, you wanted to see us break above there. "
"20437510","20439110"," You wanted to see a break above."
"20439690","20441210"," That's how you get your next target higher."
"20442330","20443590"," Didn't quite get it today. "
"20453360","20455160"," Tesla not quite there either."
"20455760","20457740"," Did a big blue line coming down right here."
"20458480","20475540"," Tesla needs to get right above that 135.90. I would love"
"20475540","20476840"," to see us sell off into the bell. "
"20481080","20485440"," Be a nice trade for Friday calls and cash them out."
"20498460","20503840"," And if you watch the, if you go back to this morning, if you guys are not tracking a hundred"
"20503840","20509100"," percent, you can go back to this morning's broadcast at right at nine 30."
"20509580","20518240"," And I spent the first half an hour on stocks with, I spent the whole morning on a weekly"
"20518240","20518700"," prediction. "
"20519540","20520720"," It goes in depth."
"20521360","20523660"," It all is still valid at this moment."
"20524060","20525320"," All of it still valid. "
"20525340","20526220"," Nothing's changed."
"20527460","20533840"," I went over E.R. reports for this entire week and the end of, or in the entire of next"
"20533840","20536080"," week with large expected moves."
"20536920","20538740"," I'm going to take this with large expected moves. "
"20539380","20540280"," So you definitely want to."
"20542640","20544200"," But what's going on with this?"
"20546240","20549560"," I'm getting some, I'm getting some artifacts there."
"20554360","20555720"," Those artifacts aren't working. "
"20557260","20558360"," Getting some weirdness."
"20562060","20563460"," I want to buy down here."
"20566260","20569320"," But you can check out the broadcast this morning, went through it in depth. "
"20572640","20575640"," Now what to expect the rest of the week, what to expect into the first."
"20580740","20589460"," There's a, the yen looks like."
"20590880","20595920"," And you guys, the currency guys are going to say the yen decides where the U.S. market goes, but"
"20595920","20597440"," I don't believe that. "
"20612690","20614190"," What do I think about natural gas?"
"20617170","20618290"," Let's look at natural gas."
"20621490","20622190"," What do you want me to do?"
"20622270","20622670"," You want to do boil?"
"20633450","20633930"," Boof."
"20635870","20637170"," Bo got crushed. "
"20646300","20646780"," Crushed."
"20651100","20653020"," Haven't even looked at natural gas in a while."
"20654600","20656460"," I will post, let me write down boil. "
"20661890","20662890"," Hold on a second here."
"20665690","20667390"," I'm going to make a post on."
"20670950","20672650"," I'm going to make a post on the yen. "
"20673830","20674770"," And boil."
"20677430","20679070"," I'll put both of those on Twitter."
"20682730","20683270"," Man. "
"20686920","20687730"," Absolutely crushed."
"20692340","20693920"," I'll do a post on boil."
"20697370","20699810"," And you saw Jeremy, Germany said today, right?"
"20711620","20713740"," Yeah, I would see in that chart. "
"20713920","20717460"," I'm like, oh, I was like, I'm down for that trade."
"20738180","20740760"," Yeah, I'm pretty, I'm pretty bearish on oil."
"20745470","20746930"," I'm super bearish. "
"20747250","20749410"," Like CL and light sweet crude."
"20749590","20751430"," I'm very, very, very bearish on it."
"20755500","20758140"," Oh, man, dude, I got messed up in degas. "
"20758500","20761040"," Like, dude, that was, that was like crack back in the day."
"20761860","20765320"," People don't realize our young traders have no idea about trade and gas."
"20766320","20768580"," Gas is some wild ass shit right there. "
"20769080","20772020"," That's as wild as that field school meme stock."
"20775900","20776620"," What's better?"
"20776840","20777200"," I don't know."
"20777980","20778580"," Boil is dangerous. "
"20781000","20781420"," Super dangerous."
"20795410","20799750"," I'll, I'll post something on boil tonight, see if it's actually basing or not."
"20804510","20812790"," If you, if you like oil or you're bullish on oil, better is always, it's always better to do. "
"20815150","20815730"," Brent."
"20817300","20819310"," Brent would be the most stable trade."
"20829900","20835020"," Yeah, boil is wild. "
"20840440","20842160"," That's trade and sideways disgusting."
"20844280","20846600"," Not a fucking thing happening right here."
"20859620","20861440"," Theta gang just all over this. "
"20867540","20870540"," Yeah, I've got a way to find out if it's coming into a bottom or not."
"20870980","20872460"," So I'll see if it's bottoming or not."
"20876730","20877650"," Yeah, WTI. "
"20879470","20880590"," Takes into account."
"20886730","20887690"," I love Brent."
"20888490","20889430"," Fucking love Brent. "
"20900090","20900570"," Yeah."
"20904860","20906760"," Yeah, I saw the Doji two Floyd's garage."
"20912240","20912940"," Yeah, Matt. "
"20913180","20917020"," We were playing a, we traded, we took a couple trades earlier today and they just weren't, they"
"20917020","20917940"," weren't even fucking paying."
"20920040","20924440"," They're paying, I think I made 20, maybe almost 30% total in the day that was it."
"20924440","20927840"," And then I, or in the early part of the day, and then later in the day, I made another"
"20927840","20929640"," 10% or something 20%. "
"20930260","20936700"," I'll have to look at my day here soon and see what I made, but 47% max, probably 50 "
"20936700","20937340","% max."
"20942760","20943860"," It was a brutal day."
"20947440","20950540"," Yeah, I looked at some garbage farmer tickers this morning. "
"20951760","20955440"," So if you go back into this morning's broadcast, I'm like 930 to 1030."
"20955440","20960300"," If you haven't shown up today, go back and look because I went over a farmer tickers all morning."
"20967800","20968680"," Yeah, I did nothing. "
"20969020","20974640"," I took a one, I think I took a, I took a, like a, not quite a 30 dollar, one"
"20974640","20975880"," or two strikes out of the money."
"20976440","20979780"," One strike, 3.99 at one point, took 3.99 down here."
"20981600","20983220"," So a buck 40 out of the money. "
"20983860","20984620"," That shit wasn't printing."
"20985960","20988100"," We cut them loose right here too, we cut loose."
"20988540","20990120"," I cut loose once right here. "
"20991180","20994580"," I took this trade rate here, cut it loose."
"20998200","21003840"," And I think I took it, or I took this one maybe, and then I cut it loose again."
"21005120","21005900"," I can't remember. "
"21007020","21011130"," I don't know."
"21011330","21011970"," Maybe it was this one."
"21012390","21013710"," I can't, no, no, no, hold on. "
"21014310","21015030"," Jesus Christ."
"21018050","21019050"," I don't know."
"21019250","21021970"," I took some trades back here, and then I took some trades back here. "
"21022090","21023010"," Fucking day, suck man."
"21023490","21026030"," This was the, this was the one, this is the one that I sold right here."
"21026330","21027770"," We sold this like right here. "
"21030110","21031770"," So we took this trade rate here."
"21033250","21035570"," And I think we took this trade right here."
"21037170","21039790"," And then a bunch of guys took the, the sell. "
"21040330","21041930"," Matter of fact, I got stopped out of this one."
"21043770","21046970"," I missed this part of the trade because I was going over the week."
"21046990","21048050"," I missed this trade. "
"21048910","21054210"," And then this one, I got, I got fucking stopped out of this like twice and said, I ain't doing"
"21054210","21054570"," shit."
"21057800","21058780"," Whole day suck."
"21060160","21063940"," And I told them at the open, I'm like, just buy yourself some fucking butterflies. "
"21068780","21070580"," Buy a butterfly for Wednesday."
"21070580","21071160"," Yeah."
"21090700","21093400"," We said earlier at the end of the broadcast, just buy some flies. "
"21093760","21094220"," Go take a nap."
"21102990","21103710"," All right."
"21106350","21107250"," So this is what I'm going to do. "
"21107370","21108430"," I'm going to cut this stream short."

"21122770","21123770"," What I'll do is this. "
"21124410","21129830"," If we can get down here at this three 95, I'll take a, I'll take a trade with you guys."
"21129910","21131930"," I'm going to leave the stream up into the clothes and the bell."

"23574490","23575550"," They bought this big time."
"23575850","23578210"," So normally if you buy it, they'd buy it out here. "
