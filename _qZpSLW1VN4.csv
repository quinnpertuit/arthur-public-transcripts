"_qZpSLW1VN4","4000","5000"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5000","7000"," Check one two."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7000","15000"," Who are we gonna do here?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","15000","20000"," Who are we gonna do here?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","20000","25000"," I definitely don't feel well."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","25000","26000"," Still."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","38000","39000"," Check one two."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","46000","49000"," Whoa."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","49000","54000"," What's going on out there?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","54000","56000"," Jared, how are you? Good to see you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","56000","60000"," Yeah, I'm trying to make my way out of this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","60000","64000"," Hold on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","65000","79000"," Definitely, definitely trying to make my way out of the COVID shit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","79000","82000"," Still still."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","82000","86000"," I'm still."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","86000","90000"," Well, I'm still definitely."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","91000","93000"," Come on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","93000","98000"," Get some stuff to do."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","98000","101000"," Look at that supply up there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","101000","105000"," There's a little more higher."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","105000","108000"," Some stuff up there too that's now showing itself."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","108000","114000"," This is now showing itself up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","115000","117000"," Nice little wall right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","117000","118000"," Sellers."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","118000","120000"," We'll talk about this right here today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","120000","124000"," This is actually."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","124000","131000"," Let me move some of this over here so."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","131000","137000"," Important for you to see."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","137000","143000"," It's important to be paying attention to this stuff up in here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","144000","148000"," And why is it important that kind of stuff failures."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","148000","151000"," And what it matters."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","151000","156000"," Matter of fact, where we are right now is a good place to start."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","156000","159000"," I think tight here for just a second."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","159000","163000"," We got a couple of things I got to do here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","163000","164000"," Got a few."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","164000","168000"," I got some technical stuff I got to do."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","168000","172000"," Should be just a moment and but we're going to look at right where we are right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","172000","176000"," I can't see it at just yet, but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","176000","182000"," This does matter and especially if you're a young trader."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","182000","188000"," If you're a young trader, then this is for you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","188000","191000"," This isn't every time, but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","191000","193000"," You need to know about this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","193000","197000"," Well, I can add a conversation with someone."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","197000","203000"," I think it was Sam. I don't know if it was Sam. It could have been somebody else, but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","203000","208000"," We had a conversation about."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","208000","212000"," We had to stop everything here. So."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","212000","215000"," We're talking about."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","215000","222000"," Being a young trader and being oblivious."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","223000","228000"," To basic shit, like just simple things and."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","228000","231000"," I'll show you this one right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","231000","234000"," This is a fairly."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","234000","245000"," At one PM Eastern time, we get us Baker Hughes oil recount prior 504 turn that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","245000","249000"," Use total recount prior 625."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","250000","253000"," We're going to simplify this though."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","253000","262000"," So we're going to start with this right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","262000","269000"," It's fairly simple here previous I."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","269000","272000"," Me just turn that shit off."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","273000","275000"," So."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","275000","277000"," There's a fairly simple concept."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","277000","283000"," It's classic traditional charting, but it's still worthy to look at."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","283000","287000"," I'm going to previous I right here. It's today, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","287000","290000"," You're always looking for."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","290000","294000"," You'll hear this called cup and handle and stuff, but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","294000","298000"," Truly know what you're really looking for here is this previous I."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","299000","302000"," Time frame doesn't matter."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","302000","304000"," So this is a one minute chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","304000","306000"," It was previous I right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","306000","310000"," You're looking to see if that fails there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","310000","315000"," Previous high failure to get a new high, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","315000","318000"," This would be a failure to get a new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","318000","321000"," And this shows weakness."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","321000","324000"," For bulls, you can do the same thing in the reverse too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","324000","327000"," This works for bears as well."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","327000","330000"," Now, if you get."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","330000","335000"," The new high, so if you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","335000","340000"," If you don't have any of this yet here, okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","340000","345000"," And none of this is here yet."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","345000","348000"," Okay, just pretend none of this is here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","348000","351000"," Scratch all that out there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","351000","355000"," What's important here is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","355000","357000"," One minute chart, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","357000","361000"," So, but without seeing any of this shit over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","361000","363000"," This is basic stuff, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","363000","365000"," Get the previous I right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","365000","369000"," You're looking to see if there's a failure to get this high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","369000","374000"," This is showing the will of buyers waning, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","374000","376000"," Not good, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","376000","377000"," You want to see a new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","377000","380000"," If you're a bull, you want to see a new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","380000","383000"," So if you get the new high right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","384000","386000"," You don't want to short that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","386000","388000"," That's strength, okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","388000","390000"," No, it can go against you still."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","390000","393000"," We can still roll down into down this way."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","393000","397000"," But when you see the previous high get knocked out in a one minute chart,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","397000","399000"," this is a woman chart, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","399000","401000"," Showing strength."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","401000","405000"," Now I can still back pull back, but you're going to expect."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","405000","408000"," An actual new high over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","408000","410000"," Does it make sense?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","410000","412000"," The previous high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","412000","414000"," You catch the new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","414000","418000"," Even if you get a pullback, the expectation is you're going to go higher."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","418000","425000"," And so the thumbnail this morning is about how to spot weakness."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","425000","427000"," Or just a pullback or strength, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","427000","429000"," How do you spot it?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","429000","433000"," And we can simplify this even more."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","434000","439000"," So I'm going to go to, let's see if I can go over here to this Webull chart here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","439000","443000"," I'm going to bring up SPX or something."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","443000","445000"," Hold on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","445000","446000"," Oh."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","446000","452000"," These are fairly simple concepts, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","452000","456000"," So here's SPX here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","456000","459000"," Now this is a 30 minute chart, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","459000","462000"," Not a one minute chart, but you can see here you got the new high, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","463000","471000"," And even on a 30 minute chart, you see the failure to go back up and get the previous high right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","471000","474000"," Pretty simple stuff, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","474000","477000"," Failure to get the new high right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","477000","478000"," What does that mean?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","478000","483000"," It means if you get the failure to get the new high that we keep rolling down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","483000","490000"," Now a lot of you out there will try to say things like, um,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","491000","497000"," a lot of you out there will try to say things like, well, you should have known we're going all the way down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","497000","502000"," You'll see Elliot waivers will say things like,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","502000","506000"," oh, you know, if this, then that, then if this, then that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","506000","509000"," And it's not really good enough, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","509000","511000"," You'll go against you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","511000","515000"," So you'll see things like an Elliot waiver tell you, well, we're going all the way down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","515000","519000"," And then, you know, what ends up happening is we get the new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","519000","521000"," Then we just continue on to the right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","521000","524000"," And you say, well, fuck, I hate that Elliot waiver, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","524000","526000"," I don't like that Elliot waiver."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","526000","527000"," You got it wrong."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","527000","531000"," Uh, the truth is that, uh, like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","531000","534000"," Ellie waivers need to break out their erasers and stuff like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","534000","538000"," You need to know more than that as a trader."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","538000","541000"," Uh, as an investor and as a trader."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","541000","544000"," So if you do see that failure, you're going to expect more downside to come."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","544000","546000"," You see the failure again."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","546000","548000"," More downside to come, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","549000","554000"," Now, if we had gotten this previous high or, or if this had become a previous,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","554000","559000"," we actually gone up here, got the new high, you'd actually expect the reversal to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","559000","561000"," So it's important for you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","561000","567000"," Um, the key point here is, is that, um, no matter who's out there telling you where we're going,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","567000","573000"," you need to be able to identify if a reversal is shaping up or not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","573000","574000"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","574000","575000"," That's the key point here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","575000","577000"," Uh, you don't really care where we're going."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","577000","583000"," You don't really care, uh, if we're ever going to reverse, if we're going to go up or down,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","583000","584000"," right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","584000","590000"," So price action is king and, uh, not only is price action king, but, uh, if we're going"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","590000","592000"," to continue down, yeah, we continue down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","592000","598000"," If we end up going up and it goes against your thesis, you follow that all the way up, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","598000","604000"," So it's important for you as an investor in a trader, uh, not to be, not to pay attention to,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","604000","609000"," uh, if we're going to, uh, do you want to be able to, uh, do you want to be able to, uh, do you want to be able to"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","609000","612000"," do you want to be able to do it?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","612000","613000"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","613000","615000"," This is 4600."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","615000","618000"," And we're only pulling back here or only even pulling back here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","618000","620000"," We could go lower, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","620000","625000"," Um, and it doesn't matter if you only called this or if you only called this or only called this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","625000","628000"," If we keep going down, you have to be able to chase that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","628000","630000"," Uh, or be aware of that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","630000","632000"," We're going to continue to go down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","632000","637000"," We're going to, uh, identify, uh, when that reversal is happening."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","637000","639000"," So you're not on the wrong side of the trade, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","639000","642000"," So it doesn't matter what you're calling from here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","642000","645000"," Like let's say you're like, Hey, I'm calling, uh, I don't know."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","645000","647000"," 3600."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","647000","650000"," Calling for 3600."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","650000","657000"," Uh, but if it reverses here, you can at least say, Hey, I'm calling for 3600."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","657000","660000"," And we start the reversal process over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","660000","664000"," Uh, you're not sitting here going yet. Still 3600. Does that make sense?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","664000","669000"," If there's a reversal, same thing for, for down continuation of the downside and that kind of stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","669000","672000"," So we know kind of what to look for, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","672000","678000"," And we're coming into, uh, this previous high right here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","678000","681000"," So right now we're coming into that previous high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","684000","687000"," Right now, right? You can see it right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","688000","691000"," You can see there's a previous high right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","693000","698000"," Now there's some rules here. So we were just looking at a previous high on a one minute chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","698000","702000"," Now we're on a 30 minute chart, right? So just inside of here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","704000","707000"," If you're a seller or a bear."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","708000","712000"," Uh, what do you want to see, right? You want to see a failure."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","714000","715000"," Up here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","715000","719000"," You don't, matter of fact, this red could be brought down to right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","720000","723000"," So there's a couple, there's a couple of mechanics here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","726000","733000"," Uh, if you're a bull, let's start with the bulls. If you're a bull, you don't really, all you want to see is the touch."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","734000","735000"," Of a new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","737000","741000"," You just want to see the touch. You don't need to go any higher. You just need to see the poke the head out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","742000","744000"," And you're good to go as a bull."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","745000","747000"," Uh, you can actually have a pullback here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","748000","750000"," But as long as you stay on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","752000","753000"," You're good to go too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","754000","758000"," As long as you get that new high over here. Okay, as long as you stay on trend up here. Does that make sense?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","759000","765000"," Now you're going to hear sellers out there on social media. You'll hear them in the news and all that kind of stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","766000","771000"," And they're going to say things to you like, well, all I really want is the pullback down here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","772000","777000"," You know, just close all this stuff up and we'll get back to what you want to do up here. That's not real."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","778000","781000"," That's a seller that wants to see the failure."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","783000","791000"," To cut to get this new high because he knows that whatever this pullback is likely going even lower. Does that make sense?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","792000","794000"," Now, if you're a buyer."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","795000","797000"," And you get."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","798000","800000"," You're a buyer and you get that new high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","801000","804000"," You're actually triggered to start to look for a dip to buy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","805000","806000"," To go higher."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","807000","812000"," Now, if you failed here and started closing this gap, you're good still on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","812000","816000"," But if you start to break down here without catching that previous eye."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","817000","822000"," You're actually not trying to buy that dip there. You're actually going to be very scared and careful."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","823000","827000"," And you'll likely see this stuff down here. Get closed. Believe it or not at minimum."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","828000","829000"," And more than likely."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","830000","838000"," More bearishness. So try to parse what you're hearing people say publicly when you're on social media."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","839000","844000"," You hear people say, why can't we just go back and close this stuff down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","845000","849000"," They're not saying that. They're not saying that because."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","850000","853000"," They're not saying that to you because they want to close this stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","854000","858000"," They're saying that because they want to see the failure here so that we can get back down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","859000","861000"," And they're not getting torched right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","862000","866000"," Does that make sense to you? This is a half hour time frame, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","867000","870000"," And we're going to switch back over here to this trigger screen."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","871000","874000"," It's a one minute time frame. Similar kind of stuff, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","875000","878000"," You want to see previous high get taken out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","880000","882000"," Right. So we can smash up higher here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","883000","886000"," Makes sense. Now, even if we fail."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","887000","893000"," You're going to still going to expect that new high or that next previous high that we have to take out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","895000","897000"," So let's go back to this other chart over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","899000","901000"," And why is this important, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","901000","906000"," For the long term, why is this important? So if we get up here on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","907000","909000"," Any pullback should be bought."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","910000","913000"," Right. Any pullback should actually bought with strength."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","914000","915000"," To the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","916000","923000"," So this kind of a key place, right? You want to see this hold or at least this hold in a Monday or something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","924000","927000"," So you can stay on trend and break this previous high. Why is that important?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","928000","932000"," It's because once you knock out this this previous eye right here,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","932000","937000"," you have your pullback close out some of your some of your crap down in here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","938000","943000"," You're then going to be targeting your next previous high up here and so on and so forth."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","944000","946000"," Going back and taking out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","947000","949000"," These previous eyes now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","950000","953000"," Let's say we do all this and we get the new high over here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","953000","956000"," Yeah, we come back down close some of this crap out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","956000","960000"," We start heading back up here and we actually fail this one."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","961000","964000"," Just fail to get that previous that previous high right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","965000","969000"," That's not good either. Can lead to some consolidation and stuff like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","970000","974000"," So as long as the bulls are making new highs on these previous highs,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","975000","981000"," their run is intact and should be considered intact unless trend gets broken."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","982000","984000"," We're going to break down over here or something. That's fine."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","984000","990000"," But until that happens, if you're able to get back there and make those new previous highs,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","991000","993000"," the bull run is intact."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","995000","998000"," Okay, so into this weekend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","999000","1003000"," All right, the end of today and into the beginning of next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1004000","1009000"," If you're a bull, you don't want to see trend get broken before."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1010000","1012000"," This previous high gets taken out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1013000","1014000"," That price target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1018000","1022000"," It is basically 4400 roughly 4400 in here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1023000","1030000"," So it's a key number up in here for bulls and they need to get this for that continuation upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1030000","1032000"," Even if there's a pullback, that's what they need."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1033000","1034000"," They have to have this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1035000","1036000"," The bulls don't get that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1037000","1039000"," Right? They start to fail to get this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1040000","1042000"," They start to do this breakdown bullshit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1043000","1045000"," It's right back to business over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1046000","1047000"," Okay, to downside moves."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1048000","1051000"," I'm going to show you this in another way right now with triggers."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1052000","1056000"," So if we go back to this trigger screen right here, we go to a 30 minute chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1057000","1061000"," Go back to a 30 minute chart right here on spoons, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1063000","1065000"," Remember, we talked about staying on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1066000","1068000"," This is that previous high back here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1069000","1071000"," You can see it right there, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1071000","1074000"," My cursor is right there while that gray line all the way back."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1079000","1080000"," You want to see that, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1081000","1082000"," You want to see that, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1083000","1088000"," And you want to see something else here that we stay on trend until it happens, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1089000","1094000"," You don't want to see any pullbacks, even if it's violent, get sold."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1095000","1096000"," It makes sense."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1096000","1106000"," So this weekly trigger this daily trigger any of these pullbacks you want to see stay up there to take this bad boy out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1107000","1110000"," So it's going to be important for you as a bull."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1110000","1111000"," Some important things here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1112000","1113000"," One, get rid of this here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1114000","1115000"," So it's not in the way."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1116000","1118000"," One, you want to take out this previous high back here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1118000","1119000"," You know that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1119000","1121000"," And number two, you want to stay on trend over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1123000","1125000"," Currently, that's at 426."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1127000","1128000"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1128000","1133000"," And if we take this out right now, you're going to expect all this to go and,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1133000","1136000"," and, and, uh, try, continue to trade to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1136000","1138000"," So crucial here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1138000","1139000"," Crucial here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1139000","1141000"," There's something else I want to show you here too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1143000","1145000"," Let's talk about this one right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1148000","1151000"," Uh, I want you to think about this right here too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1151000","1152000"," We want you to watch this here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1152000","1154000"," This is that 460, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1155000","1157000"," You got known sellers here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1159000","1161000"," You got known sellers here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1162000","1164000"," You got known sellers here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1165000","1168000"," You got real weakness down here by bulls, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1169000","1171000"," And slam, pitulation trade."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1172000","1176000"," And now we're coming back up to where known sellers are again."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1177000","1179000"," So it's important here that you get that right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1180000","1185000"," And that you're able to hold this and consolidate and get some momentum underneath."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1186000","1189000"," So that we can push higher here and take out this declining."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1190000","1194000"," Uh, velocity here, uh, this piece previous highs."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1194000","1196000"," So kind of a critical moment here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1196000","1198000"," A lot of mechanics going on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1198000","1201000"," Try to push up and beat these sellers here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1202000","1205000"," Bears are, uh, still in control here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1205000","1210000"," Whether you know that or not, uh, they're still in control of this market."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1210000","1211000"," And you can see it right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1211000","1213000"," It's fairly simple to see, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1213000","1217000"," They could sold here, sold here, sold here, sold on weakness."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1217000","1221000"," And right now, all they have to do is step back in."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1223000","1225000"," Right. And then they need to break underneath."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1226000","1231000"," Need to break underneath that daily and weekly trigger and they're back in business again."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1231000","1232000"," Does that make sense?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1232000","1233000"," We talked about that last week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1234000","1237000"," And so, uh, they still are in charge here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1237000","1240000"," This is still their game and they can step in right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1240000","1242000"," And I assure you they're going to step back in."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1243000","1246000"," I assure that when we come up here, right, they're going to step right in and try to step right in."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1246000","1250000"," And try to slam this down at a minimum, do a hit and run, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1250000","1252000"," At a minimum, they're going to get that hit and run in here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1252000","1253000"," Take this out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1253000","1260000"," So between now, today, Monday, right, you're going to be looking for some kind of weakness to sell into."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1260000","1263000"," We're not quite weakness, but a back check on the daily."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1263000","1266000"," The weekly, uh, trigger the hourly trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1266000","1267000"," Be aware of this. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1268000","1269000"," This is likely to happen."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1269000","1273000"," There is likely to see some, some pressure selling coming in."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1273000","1277000"," And we're going to find out if the bulls are real in here or not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1278000","1284000"," Okay. So pay close attention to this into, uh, Friday, Monday, that kind of stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1284000","1287000"," Now, intraday for today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1289000","1291000"," Intraday for today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1292000","1295000"," Go to a 30 minute chart here or one minute chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1297000","1300000"," We're looking pretty bullish in here for the rest of today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1301000","1306000"," And here's that red, this is that red bar up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1306000","1307000"," We'll bring this over."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1310000","1311000"," Fairly close here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1312000","1316000"," We can go back to that 30 minute and see if we can make sure that's it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1316000","1317000"," Yeah, it's right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1322000","1324000"," And we'll just snap a line there too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1324000","1326000"," So you have it right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1326000","1327000"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1327000","1332000"," Okay. And, um, we'll snap a line there for you. So just for today, okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1332000","1333000"," Get this previous."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1333000","1335000"," This is just, this is for me to trade. Hold on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1336000","1338000"," Just using that trade here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1339000","1344000"," So that this white line right here, right is kind of Valhalla for bulls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1344000","1348000"," They need that technically."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1349000","1353000"," From a technical perspective, they need to tag above this. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1354000","1359000"," 4862. Let me post that on Twitter really quick."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1360000","1361000"," Hold on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1361000","1381000"," 4862."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1381000","1382000"," Oh, it's something happened."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1382000","1386000"," Let me see if that actually works."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1386000","1391000"," Turn that off. So it's kind of what you're looking for here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1391000","1395000"," It doesn't have to happen. No, uh, does it have an evidence spy?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1395000","1403000"," No, SPX would be nice."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1403000","1408000"," ES SPX either of those that be very happy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1408000","1414000"," Uh, so if we tag above this line in SPX, uh, if you're a bull at least, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1414000","1419000"," That's what you're looking for. If you're a seller, you don't want to see that, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1419000","1423000"," Sellers, sellers do not want to see above this white line right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1423000","1425000"," They, they want to hold this white line."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1425000","1430000"," Uh, they want to roll this down before you ever get there and start the, the roll down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1430000","1438000"," If you're a bear out there, um, you know, trying to time tops and stuff like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1438000","1442000"," Can you talk, can you time this right now? No."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1442000","1445000"," Uh, there's nothing here saying begin to short."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1445000","1450000"," Uh, so if you're looking for that failure to short, you know what you're looking for, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1450000","1453000"," You're looking for the break of the five minute trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1453000","1456000"," Um, and we haven't broken it yet."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1456000","1459000"," So you can see it right here. We haven't broken this five minute trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1459000","1465000"," And so that's 435.03. You want to see the break of that 435.03."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1465000","1469000"," Now there's one other hitch here for sellers."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1470000","1472000"," And that's going to be."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1472000","1477000"," Uh, what I spoke to you about earlier, which is on Twitter, I spoke to you about this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1477000","1481000"," It's roughly, uh, 40, 300."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1481000","1483000"," Let's call it 4,300."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1483000","1487000"," Uh, if we stay above that 4,300."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1487000","1491000"," Uh, right down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1491000","1496000"," So this is one other catch or caveat here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1497000","1502000"," Uh, we can fail this right now, but as long as we stay above that 430."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1502000","1507000"," The bulls are still alive to tag that to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1507000","1514000"," So if you're a seller, right, you want to see that you want to see, you don't want to see this get tagged here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1514000","1518000"," And, uh, you really want to see a break below this 430. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1518000","1520000"," For like full bear town."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1520000","1524000"," Otherwise, if you see a pullback, yeah, you can do a hit and run."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1524000","1527000"," But expect bulls to try to take that out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1527000","1533000"," Uh, but don't get your like crazy town bear on unless we break below that 430. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1533000","1537000"," So if you want to get like crazy town, uh, bulls are done for all that kind of shit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1537000","1539000"," It's below this 430 currently."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1539000","1542000"," Important to understand here. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1542000","1548000"," Uh, if you're a buyer or a seller or you're looking to find out what to expect."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1548000","1551000"," Next week or anything like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1552000","1557000"," Um, so we're going to, we'll talk about what to expect next week or what my expectations are."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1557000","1560000"," That kind of stuff here in just a moment."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1560000","1562000"," Uh, no."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1562000","1564000"," I think tight here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1568000","1574000"," Uh, let's go back to a, um, let's go back to a weevil chart here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1574000","1576000"," Let's do a spy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1577000","1587000"," So let's just look in here right now. Okay. This is that a PT two. Remember the PT two? We showed you that from yesterday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1587000","1592000"," Right here. You want to take out this stuff over here, right? That's your PT two up there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1592000","1595000"," Uh, and what don't bulls want to give up?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1595000","1599000"," Uh, so what would a bull be looking for into next week?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1599000","1604000"," It's a 30 minute chart right here. Let's see if we can go back to a five minute chart here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1605000","1614000"," And what does, uh, miss him and go to a 15 minute, maybe that can show it better."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1614000","1623000"," I want you to see this, uh, you can see those, those, uh, inverse head and shoulders and that kind of stuff right here. You got the low."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1623000","1630000"," You get the squeeze up and you're looking for some kind of a, some kind of a hold down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1630000","1632000"," Four, twenty three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1632000","1635000"," Four, twenty four into next week. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1635000","1638000"," So any kind of pullback to be met with."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1638000","1644000"," Buyer stepping in right down in here. Okay. So for next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1644000","1647000"," That's that's three down here. It's four, twenty three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1647000","1651000"," Excuse me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1651000","1654000"," And, uh, the daily trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1655000","1660000"," Is the daily trigger is down at four, twenty six, thirty."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1660000","1667000"," Uh, so we're going to look at that real quick for next week. So, uh, into a five minute chart here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1667000","1669000"," Here's your S three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1669000","1676000"," You can see all these gaps down here. They need to be, need to be, um, picked up right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1676000","1679000"," Here's the daily trigger for next week, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1680000","1687000"," And we got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1687000","1693000"," For next week. Well, let's, uh, make that yellow and we'll make it large."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1693000","1696000"," Make it nice and fat for next Friday, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1696000","1700000"," So this is what you expect into next week. Here's your daily trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1700000","1702000"," Right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1702000","1704000"," If you're a bull."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1704000","1709000"," Uh, you're going to be looking to buy this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1709000","1714000"," Into Tuesday. Okay. You know, turn around Tuesday. We always talk about that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1714000","1718000"," You might get that capitulation move down, right? You get that quick dip down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1718000","1721000"," Then it comes back up and then we're off and running, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1721000","1726000"," And we're, we're heading higher here. So in today's Friday, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1726000","1731000"," Tastes Friday and you're going to look for some kind of a role."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1731000","1735000"," Or squeeze up and roll into next week down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1735000","1742000"," Uh, and the, the, the most, most you should expect as a bull is, uh, let's call it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1742000","1745000"," 4 23 43."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1745000","1749000"," You have about a 15%."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1749000","1752000"," Well, it's called 30%."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1753000","1757000"," 30% chance to go and, uh,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1758000","1761000"," Retracing all this back down to like 4 23."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1761000","1767000"," You got about a, uh, 50% chance."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1767000","1769000"," I've come back down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1769000","1772000"," To the daily trigger at 4 30."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1772000","1775000"," And then another 15% chance. So we just roll."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1775000","1779000"," We blast up here, roll down and we're just, we're just continuing to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1779000","1781000"," And that's about a 15% chance right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1781000","1794000"," And I don't know, we'll leave another 5% for, uh, I don't know, fucking moonshot to 460 or market crash down to, I don't know, fucking below 4,000 or something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1794000","1798000"," Um, but into next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1798000","1804000"," Right. Start to think about, uh, some kind of a put spread, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1804000","1819000"," Put spread, doesn't it be like a Mac short or a max this or a max that if you had a put spread for, let's say, Wednesday or Friday, something in the money, right? I TM."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1819000","1825000"," And it squeezes up on you and you're panicking and it still comes back down and takes out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1825000","1827000"," You get your money and you're happy to go."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1827000","1832000"," Uh, we'll, we'll look at what this costs right now and see."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1832000","1840000"," Uh, we'll look at what this costs and see what it'll pay, uh, right now, uh, 435, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1840000","1843000"," So, uh, we see here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1843000","1849000"," Let's see what that costs and see what it pays."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1849000","1858000"," And we're current prices. So we're at 435 and all I'd be looking for here would be 430."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1859000","1863000"," 430 to 435."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1863000","1867000"," So remember, you just take a pay to be patient. If you're a bear."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1867000","1875000"," Um, if you're a seller, right? And then we got, uh, what do we got here? What do we got here? Wednesday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1875000","1881000"," Uh, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the eighth."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1881000","1886000"," You can even do Friday if you wanted to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1886000","1890000"," And, uh, debit put spread will make it simple."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1890000","1898000"," We'll edit it. Uh, five, 35, five, four, 30 and four, 35."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1898000","1906000"," Uh, you don't make a ton for 366 dollars. You make a hundred and thirty four dollars."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1906000","1910000"," Uh, but you know, it's not bad, right? It's not a bad little."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1910000","1916000"," This basically means right here that, so if you had a Wednesday expiry, 435, 430,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1916000","1921000"," uh, that would account for anything like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1921000","1927000"," And the only expectation for you would be that by Wednesday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1927000","1930000"," Uh, you nail this at least right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1930000","1934000"," It's all you have to nail there. You nail this right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1934000","1937000"," Uh, you're good. If you nail this right here, you're good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1937000","1942000"," If you come up here and, uh, Tuesday, we blast down into Wednesday, you're good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1942000","1951000"," Uh, not a bad trade. Not, it's not, it's not like, hey, I scored a 300% rocket ship or anything like that, but it's, it's kind of reasonable."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1951000","1955000"," It's got a 61% probability of, of happening."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1955000","1965000"," Um, you know, you're not expecting blood and all that, but if you get down here and, and I don't know, like we get down here and you're not expecting blood and all that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1965000","1968000"," And I don't know, like we get down here and you print that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1968000","1972000"," Then we start to reject underneath. You then get more aggressive with it, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1972000","1976000"," Start taking shorts out, start just buying fucking puts."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1976000","1985000"," If you're expecting for expecting for that big reversal that you were looking for, you have some exposure here and, um,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1985000","1988000"," you have some exposure to that downside move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1988000","1990000"," It's not crazy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1990000","1995000"," Uh, you're not going to get blown out or anything like that. Seems pretty reasonable to me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1995000","1998000"," Uh, take that trade."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","1998000","2005000"," So if you are, uh, bearish, uh, there's your trade."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2005000","2011000"," If you're bullish and you're like, well, cap our way up here. We're so close up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2011000","2014000"," You just sit back and sit in your hands for next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2014000","2018000"," Until you catch that dip by. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2018000","2022000"," Uh, for putting any major money in the market, whether it's down here, down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2022000","2025000"," You just wait down there to grab it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2025000","2031000"," Uh, so you can get a nice fat, uh, dip by for next week. Does that make sense to you guys out there?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2031000","2034000"," No, it's pretty fairly simple."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2034000","2038000"," Uh, fairly, fairly simple math here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2038000","2041000"," You can see it right here too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2042000","2048000"," Fairly, fairly easy trade and you don't really have to sweat too much."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2048000","2051000"," Another part of that trade too is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2051000","2056000"," Another part of that, another good part about that trade is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2056000","2068000"," Another good part about that trade is that, uh, if we continue to drive higher, you can trade zero dates and still be in those put spreads."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2068000","2073000"," You can be in those put spreads and you can trade the market up, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2073000","2078000"," You can buy yourself some zero day calls and if it continues to go higher, it's going to pay you even more."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2078000","2081000"," Um, so if we begin to squeeze up that for 40."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2081000","2085000"," You've got exposure to the downside for the pullback in the next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2085000","2088000"," You're making the zero day calls into the close."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2088000","2091000"," It's a no brainer here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2091000","2095000"," Um, definitely a no brainer for, for, uh, for, uh, for, uh,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2095000","2100000"," for a bear or even a buyer, uh, to just put that protection on into early next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2100000","2105000"," I guess you could do Friday if you wanted to, uh, if you wanted some extra time on it or something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2105000","2110000"," But Wednesday seems, seems seems long enough for that pullback to happen."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2110000","2113000"," Maybe it's in the Wednesday close or something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2113000","2118000"," If we grind up and, uh, let's say, let's say grind up into Wednesday instead to four 40."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2118000","2123000"," And, uh, you're, you're put spread burns, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2123000","2124000"," Like, ah, fuck."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2124000","2125000"," I'm losing this or something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2125000","2135000"," You can always cut the, uh, one side of that trade by zero dates to trade up into, uh, into, um, Wednesday as well to cover the trade."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2135000","2143000"," So that you have, like, tactful ways to, um, manage that trade, even if it starts to go against you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2144000","2146000"," Let me see what check you guys out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2146000","2148000"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2148000","2149000"," I'm feeling better today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2149000","2152000"," Like right now that, well, I was, uh, feeling like shit this morning."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2152000","2154000"," Right now at this moment, I feel good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2154000","2157000"," So I feel real good at this exact moment."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2157000","2159000"," So my brain feels good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2159000","2161000"," The fog is lifting."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2161000","2165000"," Uh, I don't think I have any permanent damage that I can tell right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2165000","2169000"," Like I'm getting, I'm improving, not, not getting it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2169000","2174000"," Right now, like I'm getting, I'm improving, not, not getting worse."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2174000","2177000"," So, you know, that's a good sign, I think."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2177000","2189000"," Uh, what does, uh, what does suck is that, um, what does, what does suck is that, um, I'm still testing positive so I can't go out in public."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2189000","2192000"," I'm like fucking rat in the cage right now and the weekend is coming."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2192000","2194000"," How's everybody doing?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2194000","2195000"," How you doing out there?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2195000","2196000"," Hey, train a podcast."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2196000","2197000"," I got to contact your brother."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2198000","2200000"," I'm going to try to contact you today or tomorrow, man."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2200000","2201000"," I'm going to get into contact with you today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2201000","2203000"," I got some, a bunch of stuff I got to throw at you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2203000","2204000"," I still haven't done that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2204000","2206000"," I've been way, way behind."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2206000","2208000"," I've been very, very ill, man."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2208000","2210000"," Like violently ill."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2210000","2213000"," Hiding underneath covers and shit and corners."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2214000","2217000"," Like mutiny in the bounty shit with kids."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2219000","2221000"," Kids are like, kids are like, what are we going to do?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2221000","2222000"," We're going to starve."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2222000","2226000"," Like no, I'm like a little order out every night for you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2227000","2231000"," So we're going to do order out every night and get delivery."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2232000","2234000"," Yeah, it has a positive buying calls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2235000","2237000"," I didn't take Pavlovics yet."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2237000","2239000"," I haven't even told my doctor yet."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2241000","2242000"," I'm in a bunch."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2242000","2244000"," I have a bunch of medical stuff going on already."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2244000","2246000"," So they'll know soon enough."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2247000","2252000"," I'm getting a bunch of like testing shit done and it's like fall right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2253000","2255000"," Like start of a new year."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2255000","2259000"," Wife wants me to do all this like, like check my butthole."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2259000","2261000"," Check my mental health."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2261000","2262000"," All this other."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2262000","2263000"," I don't like women."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2263000","2265000"," They like, they want to take care of you and shit like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2265000","2266000"," Make sure you're not going to die."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2266000","2269000"," I guess some of them want to kill you, but this one doesn't want to kill me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2269000","2270000"," I don't think."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2270000","2272000"," Or she doesn't want to be blamed if I die."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2275000","2278000"," So she forces me to draw this stupid shit from my own health."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2279000","2280000"," It's true."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2283000","2284000"," It's very true."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2285000","2288000"," We also know that at 1 30 in the afternoon, we get."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2289000","2291000"," At 1 30 after we get a lot of."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2292000","2293000"," Walking is going on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2293000","2295000"," We just got a little bit of weakness here right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2297000","2299000"," I'm coming on just in time, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2299000","2300000"," A little bit of weakness right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2300000","2301000"," This right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2305000","2307000"," See if we can confirm a roll down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2307000","2309000"," Not quite there yet, but almost."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2309000","2311000"," We want to see the rejection."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2311000","2312000"," So let's look at this right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2312000","2315000"," You want to see a failure by bulls first."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2315000","2319000"," We want to see a green arrow right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2319000","2321000"," Reverse to the downside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2321000","2323000"," You want to see the rejection right in here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2323000","2324000"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2324000","2327000"," You're looking for that rejection to get short."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2331000","2334000"," Not quite there yet the moment."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2337000","2338000"," Hold on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2341000","2345000"," So for next week, we got a bunch of stuff to go over."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2345000","2349000"," We got to go over some S or some gamma stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2350000","2352000"," We have to go over some collar stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2353000","2359000"," And I want you to realize that they're going to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2359000","2362000"," I want you guys to be able to comprehend or understand that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2362000","2364000"," Dips should be bought."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2364000","2367000"," Market should be supportive."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2367000","2372000"," And it's every time you see buyers step in, you should see the."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2372000","2374000"," The dealer's chase."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2374000","2376000"," That buying."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2376000","2381000"," So expect more of a grind up than squeezing at this point."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2382000","2383000"," Key point here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2383000","2384000"," No more squeezing."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2384000","2389000"," More more expect dips to be bought and then moves to be made higher."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2389000","2391000"," So if you're a bull, you need to be."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2391000","2394000"," Conscience of where those dip buys are."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2394000","2400000"," So if you see demand step in, you should see dealers follow along."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2400000","2405000"," With that dip buying as long as we stay above that 4300."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2405000","2408000"," That should that should persist."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2409000","2412000"," Okay, so here are all those things."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2412000","2416000"," Or hear that specific statements I just made to you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2416000","2422000"," You should see stability and you should see dips known dips known"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2422000","2427000"," demand get bought and you should see dealers follow right along with"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2427000","2429000"," that with that action."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2429000","2431000"," So we're going to go over a few things."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2431000","2433000"," There's going to be a couple seconds here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2434000","2439000"," You got to prep downside price target here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2439000","2442000"," If you can get a rejection."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2442000","2444000"," Only if you can get a rejection."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2444000","2446000"," Don't say I said this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2446000","2448000"," Stupid shit or anything like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2448000","2450000"," If you get that, if you get that rejection right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2450000","2456000"," You're downside target would be 431 85."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2456000","2458000"," Right in there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2458000","2460000"," You're looking for the rejection."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2461000","2463000"," See this one right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2463000","2465000"," I want to see that rejection right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2465000","2467000"," You have a downside target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2467000","2469000"," You got to see the rejection. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2469000","2471000"," Hold on a second here."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","2519000","2525320"," is going to be breaking trend. That's a big one, right? We break trend and that begins"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2525320","2531160"," to stop the question of are we going to make a new high or fail to make a new high. Number"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","2537800","2543320"," Trend for you. If you're a bull is going to be the hourly trigger, then possibly the daily"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2543320","2550040"," trigger, but mostly the hourly trigger. If trend is not broken and the previous eye is made in"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2550040","2555240"," your bull, you're going to be looking for supportive action and buying the dip at known demand levels."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","2881800","2893320"," they still control the downside moves in the market. Now, how do you know if they no longer control the market?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2895160","2900200"," It's when you beat this right here. If you can beat this right here"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2901960","2909080"," and then successfully back test it and you're a bull, I'll switch my, I'll switch my thesis back"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2909160","2916040"," to bulls. Bulls will then be in control of the market. It's not, it's definitely not what a bear"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","2916040","2922120"," wants to see. Right. If you see that, if you're a bear, if you're a seller out there, if you see"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","2942520","2955400"," I'll say here is sellers can easily easily reverse this and things can get fucking ugly. I'm going"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","3022280","3027960"," this can continue, I can assure you that this can continue. And the scary part is"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3029720","3035320"," that daily and weekly trigger cross over here. If that gets confirmed in here,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3035880","3043320"," this usually leads to a crash. I'm going to warn you of that. So, and we've had crashes, right? So,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3045560","3051400"," just be aware of it. Just be aware that this is still in play. That cross is still in play."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3052040","3057960"," We have no cross in the daily trigger above the weekly trigger yet. We can next week,"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","3137880","3141880"," move. Get the fucking confirmation on the daily trip crossing down the weekly trigger"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3142520","3149880"," and then we'll discuss the 1987 crash because if we did reject this if we reject up here"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3150600","3157480"," and we'd be get if we do reject this and we begin to get underneath right and we confirm that"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3157480","3163320"," cross right there, then they have an actual argument. You're a bear. You actually have an"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","3221880","3227560"," previous low would be a full bear suit. It'd be all over for the market at that point. You'd see"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","3537800","3548200"," because of how we're treating, how we're treating inflation in wages and companies and probably"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3548200","3554440"," very smart people saying, Nope, no, we're going up in price or wages. And nope, nope, nope, we don't"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3554440","3559240"," want to drop the price of eggs. We like the price of eggs high here. And you know what, fuck the"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3559240","3565480"," system. You know, that's like read on a whole nother level. If you're, if you're like Bob on Main Street"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3565560","3572200"," or you're retired or even if you're young, I want you to know that there are extremely greedy people"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3572200","3577160"," out there that don't care if they've raised the prices of eggs. They don't want to hear it. And"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3577160","3580680"," they'll just fight you on your wages as long as possible until they have to raise them so they"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3580680","3585800"," can max profits knowing that all this stuff is going up. You know, so yeah, you're going to see"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3586600","3594280"," a rent set, you know, one bedroom apartment, right? Two, three, four thousand dollars in 20 years,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3595000","3601000"," $5,000, $4,000. And you don't believe that, but you're going to see it. And you can see it right"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3601000","3606840"," now. You can kind of see the cracks in the Fed. You can kind of see the cracks in wages. You can"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3606840","3614840"," see the cracks in pricing not coming down. You can see it in the inflation that is sticky right"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3614920","3619480"," now. Do you notice that you're not getting anything extra for that stuff? And you might even be getting"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3619480","3628200"," less. So you're getting higher prices, right? And then you're getting nothing extra for it,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3628200","3633320"," right? You're not getting anything extra with those higher prices. And that's like this evil,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3633320","3639800"," insidious, not evil and cis, but greed, right? I don't know if greed's good or bad, but it's"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3639880","3646200"," greed in the background that's working against you. And it's also one ton. I don't give a fuck"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3646200","3651320"," about you on Main Street. If I'm going to raise prices on you and give you less service or less"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3651320","3657400"," quality and that kind of stuff. And I'm and I'm aware and being that greedy person or that greedy"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3657400","3662120"," entity that I'll have to raise your wages at some point and I'll fight you all along the way,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3662120","3667400"," although wherever I have to pay am I will. So if you're seeing that, at least, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3667400","3671400"," Be aware of it. Like even last week, I was talking to you guys about getting hit with a"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3672440","3677880"," service charge, right? 20% service charge regardless. And those people, you could see those service"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3677880","3686040"," people are like, we don't give a fuck. I'm getting my 20%. And I understand that I get it. I get it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3686040","3691240"," And these restaurants don't care either, right? Even the people producing the food don't care"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3691240","3697960"," at that point. Everybody's getting paid. Nobody cares. So here we go. Nice reversal right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3698680","3701960"," This is this is actually good to see for bears. You want to see this right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3703480","3709560"," This is weakness by the bulls failure to get a new high right there. Right. No squeeze up. That's"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3709560","3713640"," good to see. This is actually kind of bearish here. So maybe taking some puts here in just a minute."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3714600","3721080"," So anyways, we got a lot to talk about. We have a lot to discuss about that stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3723080","3731960"," In the coming days next week because it impacts next year. And how big is that role when it comes"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3731960","3739080"," the anticipation of cutting rates? Are they actually going to cut rates? Maybe Jerome's plan is to"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3739880","3745160"," hold rates up higher for years and years and years. I don't see that happen. And I'm not a believer"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3745160","3750280"," in that that's going to happen. But how much that front running is? What's the previous low"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3750280","3756680"," we're going to go test all that kind of stuff and how ugly is it going to get? Because it's"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3756680","3761320"," going to get ugly at some point. We're going to get that that recheck that back check and check"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3761320","3767400"," that 350 or check the previous high if we go higher from the high of 2022."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3769000","3774440"," So we have a lot to look at into next year. The baseline here, the only thing I could say baseline"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3774440","3779880"," would be if you're trying to get long in this market permanently, you're probably waiting for"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3779880","3789560"," February or April at some point to jump in on that trade. See what happens here. I'm going to"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3789640","3793960"," clear some of this out so you can see that it's so sloppy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3799720","3804520"," One quick second here. That's a lot of some of the trade."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3819560","3821960"," And one quick second here guys."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3849560","3876360"," I'm going to click second here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3879800","3895480"," Move that up for you right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3895480","3909960"," I'm going to click say I got a few things I got to do here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3913000","3919640"," I got to load some data."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3925480","3932280"," Fed swap showing more than 100 BPS of easing price for 2024."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3937480","3941720"," White House economic advisor Bernstein job gains at this pace feel right to me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3942520","3947320"," Oh dude, they're really sucking off that election, aren't they? Really sucking off that election."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3947320","3966680"," I'm going to really sucking off that election here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3969960","3973480"," Come on now. I'm going to turn this stuff off."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3977800","3997160"," I'm going to click second here guys."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","3999640","4002200"," Come on now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4007320","4020840"," I got a large note of calls. We got 422,000 calls on 435 C."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4024520","4028040"," Why is my fucking internet so slow?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4028040","4037880"," So I downloaded movies last night or something maybe."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4047960","4050840"," I wonder if they're going to try to park this and then run it up."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4050840","4054600"," Keep it crawling up into the close here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4058680","4068600"," See if they murder these four thirty-fives and then run it up."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4068600","4072440"," Dude right here. Come on dude."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4072920","4081320"," I'm having some streaming problems right now guys."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4081320","4083880"," Apologize."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4086360","4089160"," Turn that off."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4091320","4095240"," Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4102440","4104440"," You"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4132440","4143440"," Let's first take a look at, let's see if he can show this over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4143440","4155440"," Does that work right there? Can I show that? Okay. So, we will chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4156440","4162440"," No, we will chart. We're going to switch over to seasonality chart right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4162440","4171440"," And I want to show you guys a couple things here in seasonality."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4171440","4182440"," Right there, there's the 217th trading day."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4182440","4186440"," It's the 221st trading day."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4186440","4193440"," And we're coming into the 213th trading day right now. Okay, so watch that down there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4193440","4196440"," 213th trading day right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4196440","4200440"," 217th was what we're coming into the 213th trading day of the year."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4200440","4204440"," Up until the 221st."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4204440","4207440"," Trading day of the year. That's."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4207440","4210440"," Seven more sessions. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4211440","4215440"," Basically seven more sessions. You're going to look for another peak."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4215440","4218440"," And then something like this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4218440","4224440"," So this would be looking for that top and then another dip by for the rest of."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4224440","4227440"," The next seven trading days here. Okay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4227440","4234440"," So now you're going to look for bullishness into beginning of this week and then more bullishness into next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4235440","4239440"," Then some kind of trading sideways action."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4239440","4245440"," Into late November, mid to late November."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4245440","4254440"," A dip in a dip in December and then close the month or close the end of the year strong into end of December."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4254440","4258440"," That is a SPX seasonality."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4258440","4262440"," We'll look at NDX seasonality."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4262440","4268440"," Let's see if I can get a."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4268440","4273440"," This is a NASDAQ seasonality."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4273440","4275440"," And you got."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4275440","4280440"," Yeah, you got to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4281440","4288440"," Now is that should start to top off here sooner than SPX start rounding itself off."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4288440","4292440"," And then a slow grind up into end of year."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4292440","4297440"," Well, we'll take a look at a seasonality of VIX."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4297440","4302440"," Next."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4302440","4310440"," Seasonality of VIX telling you to look for that slow grind up and then a slow push up into end of the year."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4310440","4316440"," So might likely coming into a place where if you want to buy the VIX for end of the year, look into that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4316440","4322440"," You might get one nice VIX spike and end of year. So if you're interested in that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4322440","4325440"," Bring that back over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4325440","4328440"," Getting a squeeze up right now on spy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4329440","4335440"," Reversal for the bulls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4335440","4341440"," Come back up to retest that prior high at 435 90."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4341440","4351440"," See if they can take this out right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4351440","4354440"," Right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4354440","4370440"," I just want to see the head poke out right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4370440","4371440"," Make that a."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4371440","4374440"," I guess I can't make that any."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4374440","4384440"," Slide that back there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4384440","4391440"," Next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to place in some."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4391440","4399440"," We're going to go and look at."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4399440","4403440"," On the Mac or any JPM caller."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4403440","4420440"," The NBA. Where is gamma? We're going to go to gamma."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4420440","4430440"," Paste in the data for gamma."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4430440","4446440"," Take a look at gamma really quick."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4446440","4450440"," We'll see us knocking on the door right here right this gamma node right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4450440","4452440"," This is a gamma node."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4452440","4458440"," Your next target is 4400."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4458440","4461440"," Looks like an obvious place to short 4400."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4461440","4467440"," And then your next larger nodes."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4467440","4473440"," Next larger node above is 4450."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4473440","4476440"," And then 4500."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4476440","4486440"," You need to see more call buying up there to firm up this upside target up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4486440","4490440"," Gamma flip to the downside is a."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4490440","4494440"," 4290 for negative gamma."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4494440","4497440"," So anything below this negative."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4497440","4504440"," Right this is where your negative gamma is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4504440","4509440"," Bull's trying to knock above."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4509440","4515440"," You can see right here just trying to slam above this node slam up into this 145 million node."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4515440","4522440"," You can see that it happened earlier over here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4522440","4533440"," Back here in October 17th."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4533440","4542440"," Take a look at this here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4542440","4548440"," You can just see it grinding right here just trying to break break smash into that gamma level right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4548440","4553440"," Like slamming up slamming up slamming up and then looking for that 4400."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4553440","4558440"," Right now it's parked sitting right on that gamma and that node."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4558440","4564440"," You see that right there just like parked."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4564440","4573440"," Supported supported looking for the upside move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4573440","4576440"," Look at."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4576440","4580440"," You guys want me to show you this really quick here hold them."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4580440","4591440"," Give you guys a 30 minute chart you can snap this at home so you can see your gamma profile."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4591440","4595440"," There's your gamma flip."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4595440","4599440"," You can see it here being the ping pong up here hit that right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4599440","4604440"," Pull back down any of that stuff gets."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4604440","4609440"," Picked up at minimum and then you are now going to attack if you can get call buying."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4609440","4612440"," Get a bunch of call buying over here they pull it back."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4612440","4617440"," And they come up here and actually tag it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4617440","4622440"," That's 4450 up there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4622440","4627440"," 4550 up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4627440","4634440"," Let's take a look at."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4634440","4645440"," Yes second here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4645440","4655440"," 4500."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4655440","4663440"," That's the entire market right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4663440","4688440"," We're going to leave and go to that JPM caller."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4688440","4693440"," So that 4550 is up there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4693440","4697440"," That 4550 is definitely up there to be tagged."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4697440","4702440"," Into end of quarter this is available here this is possible."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4702440","4706440"," Not only is that possible but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4706440","4712440"," Not only is that possible but you also have."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4712440","4718440"," Let's see if I can show this to you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4718440","4722440"," Even the gamma even the gamma profile."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4722440","4729440"," Is showing that there's potential here for this move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4729440","4733440"," But this is this is possible."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4733440","4738440"," Another reason why I'm saying that that's possible up there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4738440","4740440"," 4550."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4740440","4743440"," On any pullback."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4743440","4751440"," 4550 is possible into end of end of end of a month."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4751440","4756440"," Going on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4756440","4771440"," If the market can hold 4550 for December 31st."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4771440","4774440"," That's if the market can hold."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4774440","4777440"," It's trend to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4777440","4780440"," What the fuck is going on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4780440","4783440"," Hold on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4783440","4786440"," I want some real issues here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4786440","4793440"," All right we'll let that work in the background here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4793440","4803440"," So I wanted to show you guys the gamma landscape here and show you why that upside is possible."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4803440","4810440"," But it looks like it's not going to happen."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4810440","4813440"," Looks like it might not happen here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4813440","4830440"," Bring that over."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4830440","4831440"," Bring this up for you guys."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4831440","4856440"," I want to show you where all the calls and puts are in the market."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4856440","4860440"," Let's take a look at something else."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4860440","4877440"," Ten-year yield."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4877440","4884440"," We got the Goldman Sachs down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4884440","4893440"," Just look at that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4893440","4897440"," Yields seem to be holding here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4897440","4904440"," Need that nice firm rejection for that more downside move right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4904440","4909440"," Yields a little strong right now but looking for that rejection to the downside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4909440","4911440"," Keep an eye on yields."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4911440","4915440"," Set an alert at home at $4."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4915440","4919440"," I said $4."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4919440","4923440"," 4.73%."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4923440","4928440"," Look for if this is a ten-year yield chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4928440","4933440"," There's some like that for more downside to come."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4933440","4938440"," And yields to go down to 4.2% right down there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4938440","4944440"," Keep your eye on yields right here for another downside move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4944440","4950440"," Set an alert at home at $4.73%."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4951440","4959440"," Let's get kind of a confirmation there but you could set it lower."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4959440","4964440"," You could set it at 4.6 if you really wanted to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4964440","4970440"," I'd set an alert at 4.6% and 4.73%."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4970440","4973440"," See if it just came because it is rejecting off this half an hour."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4973440","4976440"," You see it right there?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4976440","4986440"," Set an alert at 4.6%."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","4986440","4991440"," Target at 4.2% on US 10-year."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5036440","5051440"," Hold on a second."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5051440","5054440"," Check SPX really quick."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5054440","5059440"," And look at that shit huh?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5059440","5064440"," We literally need to stay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5064440","5068440"," We literally just need to stay parked right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5068440","5074440"," See to stay above this right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5074440","5076440"," All we need to do is stay above that right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5076440","5081440"," We're good to go."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5081440","5084440"," That's it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5084440","5097440"," She got a nice fat dip by by Monday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5097440","5100440"," Sorry I'm checking this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5100440","5103440"," Checking to make sure all this needs to do is stay down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5103440","5105440"," Just can't have any of that down there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5105440","5121440"," Can't have any rejection down there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5121440","5123440"," Damn just grinding right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5123440","5124440"," No new high here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5124440","5127440"," Now you're to get a new high right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5127440","5130440"," Not bullish, just neutral here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5130440","5145440"," Not bearish or anything, just neutral."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5145440","5149440"," Gamma flip, all you need to know is that you're positive above and negative below."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5149440","5151440"," The simplest way."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5151440","5157440"," So dealers will tend to, if we're in positive gamma, you'd expect dips to be bought."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5157440","5159440"," You'd expect low volatility."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5159440","5163440"," That means we'd grind up slowly to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5163440","5166440"," Below the gamma flip, we're into negative gamma."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5166440","5179440"," What you really need to know is expect volatility, expect large downside moves, expect any rip to be sold, expect any dip not to be held."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5179440","5182440"," And we're in a negative regime here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5182440","5183440"," We're targeting."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5183440","5188440"," We've got magnets below that of lower puts to tag."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5188440","5194440"," When we're in positive gamma and you've got a large concentration of calls to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5194440","5203440"," You're looking to tag those calls, but it would should grind slowly up and tag those calls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5203440","5206440"," That's like the big thing for you to take away."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5206440","5209440"," Or the simple, the simplified thing period to take away."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5209440","5218440"," If you got a bunch of puts on the downside below the gamma flip to the downside, we're going to, they're going to seek out to get close."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5218440","5223440"," Maybe not tag that get close to those large gamma nodes."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5223440","5230440"," And you inverse, you inverse everything from a bull perspective."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5230440","5233440"," Damn, I'm fucking feeling sick again right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5233440","5235440"," My stomach's hurting me again."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5235440","5236440"," Give me a five seconds."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5236440","5237440"," I'm going to take a quick five second break."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5237440","5241440"," I'm going to stand up and just go outside and get some air."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5241440","5256440"," I got the new squacker on for you here, and I'm going to turn on some, I'll turn on some CNBC."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5256440","5261440"," One quick second here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5261440","5263440"," We'll be five minute break here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5263440","5266440"," It's like consult or not consolidation with grinding."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5266440","5279440"," Looks like they're going to try to kill these four 35s into the bell and going through a potential merger, which will take some time and laying out the synergies and merging the businesses during a recession."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5279440","5285440"," You know, maybe an opportune time to take that opportunity and that's the way we see it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5285440","5294440"," But, you know, again, they had the six flights has not spoken to us specifically, or any of us about."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5294440","5305440"," Dude, why am I getting such fucking horrible ass."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5306440","5307440"," The deal."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5307440","5310440"," So, you know, we're making our own assumptions on that Morgan."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5310440","5312440"," It's talking about six likes right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5312440","5315440"," It seems to me like every time I look up six."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5315440","5316440"," Yeah, five minute break."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5316440","5317440"," Well, it's like it's air."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5317440","5319440"," Make sure it's not coming in."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5319440","5323440"," There has no ability there over the past decade or so."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5323440","5328440"," Who's going to control this operation? Is it Cedar Fair?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5328440","5331440"," It's a, it's a great question."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5332440","5337440"," And, you know, you're better off not being a covering analyst with that much change."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5337440","5339440"," It just makes all the much harder."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5339440","5351440"," The answer to your question, Tyler is that the management team is going to run the business and control 51% of the merge entity as it's proposed right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5351440","5355440"," The current CEO at six flags would be executive chairman."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5355440","5357440"," So not a day to day execution role."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5358440","5363440"," And, you know, that is, in our view, a compelling, you know, positive here as well."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5363440","5366440"," Do you have a favorite choice in this universe that you follow?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5366440","5372440"," Well, so again, you know, we only cover six flags and not Cedar Fair."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5372440","5377440"," As you're probably aware, we also cover, you know, quite a bit in regional gaming."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5377440","5378440"," We cover sports betting."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5378440","5386440"," We cover hotels and it feels to me right now is almost all of them have reported earnings since Monday morning."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5387440","5402440"," And look what I would say and what we have said many times over is that the sports betting category, which is a nascent business in the United States and still growing globally does not require a view on the macro economy, which is one of the incredible"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5403440","5410440"," confusions about my coverage today, our coverage today and, and frankly, all the consumer groups across Jefferies."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5410440","5414440"," But for sports betting to work, you don't need a view on the economy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5414440","5416440"," And that's, that's why we have favored it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5416440","5417440"," All right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5417440","5418440"," Very interesting answer. Thank you, David."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5418440","5419440"," Appreciate it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5419440","5420440"," David Katz."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5420440","5425440"," And coming up, we're going to continue our coverage of funflation with the CEO of live nation."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5425440","5428440"," That company got a boost from Taylor Swift and others this summer."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5428440","5432440"," And so how can they keep it up, especially if the economy goes a little soft."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5432440","5435440"," But first, huge debate in San Francisco about driverless cars."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5435440","5438440"," So Deidre Boza decided to see for herself."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5438440","5440440"," She took a ride in a robo taxi."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5440440","5443440"," It was all going well until it wasn't."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5443440","5445440"," That's next on power line."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5449440","5450440"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5450440","5451440"," Give me two minutes."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5451440","5452440"," Go outside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5452440","5454440"," Get some kind of catch the mirror real quick."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5459440","5464440"," I'm not sure what's in this fucking sick, dude."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5464440","5471440"," It's like waves piss me off and to no fucking end."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5488440","5495440"," Thank you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5518440","5525440"," Thank you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5548440","5555440"," Thank you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5578440","5605440"," Thank you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5605440","5612440"," Welcome back, everybody."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5612440","5619440"," Today's tech check are Deidre Boza looks at the battle over autonomous vehicles in the city by the bay."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5619440","5620440"," Deidre."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5620440","5621440"," Yes."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5621440","5625440"," So Tyler, the promise and the chaos of self-driving cars has been on display in San Francisco streets."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5625440","5629440"," For a few months now, the two major players are James Cruz and Alphabet's Waymo."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5629440","5634440"," I went for a ride along to see for myself when I talked to execs from across the industry,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5634440","5640440"," but it was definitely in the backseat of a cruise ride that I had the most dramatic experience."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5646440","5649440"," We just went around a car with its emergency lights on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5649440","5655440"," I did it pretty smoothly, but now we're behind a car that's trying to park."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5656440","5657440"," He got out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5657440","5658440"," Oh, my gosh."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5658440","5661440"," And he kicked it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5661440","5664440"," I'm going to put him in the window."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5664440","5669440"," So this guy just kicked the car, and now we're calling support."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5669440","5673440"," This is stressful."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5673440","5676440"," Oh, my gosh."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5676440","5680440"," Oh, he just got on the car."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5680440","5687440"," Those were the most stressful few moments I've had in a car in a recent memory."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5687440","5692440"," There's a number of driverless cars on the road increased, so too did the problem."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5692440","5698440"," There have been 75-plus incidents, and so to me it's like playing Russian roulette."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5698440","5701440"," We are the last line of defense for most people."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5701440","5709440"," Seconds matter if it takes us a minute to go around the block because there's a vehicle in the way that puts the people in that building more at risk."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5709440","5712440"," And it puts my firefighters more at risk."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5712440","5714440"," We have a hotline for first responders."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5714440","5716440"," It's one of the things we've built in response to feedback."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5716440","5718440"," So both police and fire department can call a number."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5718440","5721440"," We can very quickly do things like relocate a vehicle that's in the way."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5721440","5725440"," Data about every collision is reported both at the state and federal level."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5725440","5728440"," We've shown video footage with first responders and things like that when it's appropriate,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5728440","5732440"," but that's got to be very carefully controlled in order to maintain the privacy of our customers."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5732440","5734440"," We tried out Waymo as well."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5734440","5739440"," While crews had more robo taxis on city streets, Waymo has been testing longer."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5739440","5743440"," Both companies say they've logged more than one million driverless miles."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5743440","5744440"," That's interesting."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5744440","5749440"," It took the opportunity to squeeze through a pretty narrow space and did so fine."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5749440","5753440"," Actually doing better than the drivers around us."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5753440","5757440"," And I got to say, one word to describe this ride, unremarkable."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5757440","5758440"," We didn't get honked at once."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5758440","5761440"," There was one incident where I thought maybe we cut someone off."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5761440","5765440"," It was uncertain, but it's been really smooth."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5765440","5770440"," So what happened to us in the crews' robo taxi?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5770440","5775440"," It was nothing compared to the incident that led to the suspension of all of its operations."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5775440","5781440"," A few weeks ago, after our ride, a crews rolled over a pedestrian that was struck by another car in a hit and run"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5781440","5783440"," and then dragged her 20 feet."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5783440","5786440"," And that has raised a lot of questions about the future of this industry."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5786440","5792440"," But on the flip side, guys, if they can get it right, and Waymo, as you saw, feels a lot further ahead here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5792440","5795440"," There's the promise of safer and less congested roads."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5795440","5799440"," Be sure to check out the whole piece on CNBC's YouTube channel, NCNBC.com."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5799440","5807440"," Big thanks to producers Andrew Evers and Laura Bachelor, who really put this together and even acted as stunt drivers for part of the shoot."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5807440","5811440"," It was really fascinating to watch your test drive of this steer drive."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5811440","5812440"," And I was curious."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5812440","5815440"," You mentioned crews and what's happened there with their licenses."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5815440","5820440"," But I was curious about what the demand picture is looking like in a city like San Francisco."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5820440","5827440"," I mean, I was speaking with one person whose daughter, apparently, you know, is part of a wait list to be able to have access to some of these autonomous rides,"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5827440","5835440"," especially at night because of the safety factor associated with that and not having to interact with a human driver from that standpoint."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5835440","5840440"," How are citizens and residents actually responding to this?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5840440","5845440"," Right. So it's been in service since August, but many, many people have to be on a wait list."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5845440","5849440"," So a lot of people I know are actually off the wait list and using them often."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5849440","5854440"," So I was on the wait list until this shoot and it seems that there's high demand."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5854440","5866440"," But again, regulators are trying to find the right balance between having a certain number of rides on the road and balancing the safety of it and a more, you know, more wise roll out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5866440","5868440"," You know, more of a balanced roll out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5868440","5871440"," Crews, though, now are not able to operate without the driver."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5871440","5873440"," So that's going to slow down their race."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5873440","5874440"," But you bring up a good point."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5874440","5880440"," Morgan, you think about, you know, if you're going to put young kids in an Uber or Lyft, you don't necessarily know who the driver is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5880440","5881440"," This kind of solves that problem."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5881440","5886440"," But you have to balance that with a danger that they might pose on the roads to pedestrians."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5886440","5892440"," You know, dear, I'm sure the moment where that guy got out of the car and confronted you was unsettling for you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5892440","5895440"," But I loved how unsettling it was for him when he came back."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5895440","5897440"," And he was getting ready to yell at the driver."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5897440","5899440"," And there was no driver."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5899440","5900440"," There was no driver."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5900440","5902440"," That is what I remember most."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5902440","5907440"," His face when he got out and approached the vehicle and saw that there was no driver."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5907440","5909440"," And then his eyes immediately went to me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5909440","5911440"," And I was completely helpless."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5911440","5913440"," I think I put up my arms and said, I don't know what to do."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5913440","5914440"," I can't move this car."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5914440","5915440"," I can't do anything."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5915440","5918440"," And you saw the wheel move, but the car didn't move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5918440","5921440"," And your car made contact with his?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5921440","5923440"," It didn't make contact with his."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5923440","5926440"," He wanted to back up and we just wouldn't move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5926440","5931440"," But I have to say, when I was in that cruise ride, we were honked at at least five times."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5931440","5933440"," So there's a lot of close calls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5933440","5940440"," And this was, I should say, through the tenderloin district, which is one of the most, if not the most difficult area to navigate in the city."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5940440","5941440"," Well, it did."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5941440","5942440"," The car did come in contact."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5942440","5945440"," It seems with his foot at the very least."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5945440","5947440"," Deirdre, thank you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5947440","5949440"," Thank you for your courage."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5949440","5952440"," Thank you for what you do for CNBC and our viewers."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5952440","5953440"," Glad to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5953440","5955440"," It was an important lesson to learn, though."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","5955440","5963440"," And I will say, though, just as a end note, the cruise was wild, but the Waymo was really an indication that some of these are ready for prime time."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","6244440","6245440"," Apple."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6245440","6246440"," Let's talk about apple earnings."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6246440","6248440"," Apple earnings were fine."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6248440","6251440"," They were good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6251440","6253440"," Nothing bad about apple earnings."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6253440","6257440"," I can say I saw some people say about apple that it was bad earnings."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6257440","6259440"," Good question, by the way."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6259440","6262440"," I heard bad things about apple earnings."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6262440","6265440"," And let's take a look at it really quick."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6265440","6268440"," So I'm real apple real quick."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6268440","6272440"," I think we charted out the upside and downside expected moves, didn't we?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6272440","6275440"," Not that we did."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6275440","6276440"," You know, Apple looks fine to me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6276440","6278440"," Nothing looks wrong here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6278440","6282440"," I think we said 182 was the."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6282440","6287440"," I think we said 182 was the upside target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6287440","6291440"," Here's apple right here in a one minute chart."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6291440","6297440"," They hit their upside target for the implied move for the today, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6297440","6299440"," So dealers are happy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6299440","6301440"," They couldn't be any happier, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6301440","6304440"," Pigs and shit right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6304440","6309440"," And I'm going to, I don't know if this is the downside expected move for the week, but it looks like it is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6309440","6312440"," So you've got the upside target already hit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6312440","6314440"," You get downside target already hit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6315440","6318440"," And we have to close out the 30th."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6318440","6323440"," Now we do have some range expansion after $80.51 a barrel."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6323440","6325440"," That's down $1.95."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6325440","6327440"," We do have some expected."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6327440","6332440"," Range expansion to the upside and downside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6332440","6334440"," Into next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6334440","6338440"," So if you're looking for a dip to buy, you know where that is, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6338440","6343440"," 168 and you are going to be looking for some higher highs up here now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6344440","6349440"," Overall, apples earnings were fine."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6349440","6350440"," They were not bad."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6350440","6352440"," Everyone's like, they had to be this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6352440","6353440"," They had to be that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6353440","6355440"," Let's be clear about Apple."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6356440","6357440"," Super clear."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6358440","6360440"," They didn't have any like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6360440","6361440"," They didn't have any major misses."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6361440","6366440"," If you have a major miss, even if you have a good ER, expect major downside to come."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6367440","6371440"," So if you've got like a major miss, expect major downside to come right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6371440","6373440"," This looks like function."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6373440","6382440"," This looks like a function of dealers and it's at the market position of Apple and it's how much of a market it makes up."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6382440","6384440"," It doesn't look like anything crazy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6384440","6386440"," Now, did you see anything that was crazy?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6386440","6388440"," Awesome sauce for Apple?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6388440","6389440"," No."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6389440","6395440"," Did you see anything that was major negative for Apple in relevance to right now?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6395440","6397440"," No, I'm sorry you did not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6398440","6401040"," Now saying that, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6401040","6406440"," I'm going to go back to spy here saying that saying that is it good for?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6406440","6409940"," Or is it like majorly good for Apple five or 10 years from now?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6409940","6410440"," Nope."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6410440","6411440"," I wouldn't say that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6412440","6415440"," And I wouldn't say that there was anything to help Apple over time."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6416440","6418840"," It's like anything."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6418840","6419340"," Wow."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6419340","6420440"," And I don't see anything."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6420440","6423840"," The only thing that I see major negative is what I said to you the other day about Apple."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6423840","6437840"," Is that until you see them say something like we are we have now ingrained ourselves into a product that people need to use a new product that people need to use everywhere in their life."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6437840","6438840"," There aren't many of those, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6438840","6448840"," Phones, watches, socks, shoes, fucking bra underwear, car, car is another one, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6448840","6459840"," So wherever they want to pick, however they want to grain themselves, that's what they need over the next five, 10 years to be still considered a growth company."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6459840","6462840"," We didn't get any of that in their report."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6462840","6469840"," So I'm not bearish on Apple in any way, shape or form a more neutral and hold the standard on Apple right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6469840","6471840"," Matter of fact, let's look at some."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6471840","6473840"," Let's look at some next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6473840","6474840"," It is Friday."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","6533840","6537840"," On Monday, I might not have all of them in front of me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6537840","6542840"," Some people may not have announced the reports yet or might change their report."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6543840","6547840"," Now, but for Monday, we've got a vertex pharmaceuticals."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6547840","6550840"," Realty income or a corporation."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","6687840","6697840"," I don't see a lot of OI."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6697840","6701840"," Spreads are kind of shitty on this ticker."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6701840","6706840"," Looks like you're going to be being filled by dealers and not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6706840","6714840"," So the options market in this ticker is kind of dog shit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6714840","6717840"," Maybe I'll just short this fucking thing."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","6758840","6761840"," They're pretty fucking bearish right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6761840","6762840"," They've been bearish."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6762840","6765840"," They're actually looking bullish to me."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6765840","6766840"," That might be one to look at."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6766840","6770840"," Ring central bullish on it."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","6799840","6804840"," Has a lot of consolidation in it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","6804840","6809840"," It wants to break above $12.24."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7507840","7508840"," Let's take a look at them."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7508840","7510840"," See what they're saying."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7510840","7519760"," Data dog is bullish, but saying that's just another reason to grab some liquidity to sell"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7519760","7521760"," it down to fucking zero."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7521760","7524760"," So I'm bullish here on data dog."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7524760","7526760"," About to $86."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7526760","7529760"," You might tag out at 90 or 93."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7529760","7533760"," But it's just for liquidity to head down to the opposite side."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7533760","7536760"," So if you're if you're a data dog hater."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7536760","7541760"," Set some alerts above at 90 bucks, $93 and 86."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7541760","7545760"," I expect them to trade 30 bucks at some point, believe it or not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7545760","7548760"," So overall bearish on data dog."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7548760","7551760"," I want to see that shit come back to 30 bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7551760","7554760"," And."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7557760","7562760"," They're they're er, they have a 9.5% expected move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7562760","7564760"," They're trading $82."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7564760","7565760"," So."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7565760","7571760"," Another another eight bucks trade that 90 up here sounds about right right up in here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7571760","7577760"," So expectation on data dog would be bullish, but just another excuse to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7577760","7579760"," Oh, I guess I can't."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7579760","7582760"," Another another excuse to sell to the downside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7582760","7584760"," Just looking for some liquidity grab."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7584760","7587760"," This might take place after their er as well."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7587760","7589760"," You got to go report."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7589760","7590760"," They pin it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7590760","7592760"," And then it rips to the upside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7592760","7597760"," The next following er and then that's where you grab some liquidity for another downside"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7597760","7598760"," moving data dog."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7598760","7602760"," So ultimately bearish on data dog, but bullish into their er."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7608760","7611760"," Holy shit, dude, 41 cents right now."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7706760","7708760"," I don't agree with that down."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7730760","7734760"," Higher into their next expiry."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7830760","7833760"," RBLX."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7833760","7837760"," Someone asked me if I thought that was bullish on Roblox."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7837760","7840760"," I charted this one out for you."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7852760","7853760"," You guys remember we did this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7853760","7856760"," I think this was with Stacey or with Jill Natolo."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7857760","7859760"," The expectation here is we trade up."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7859760","7862760"," Trade that thirty seven dollars come right back down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7862760","7864760"," Now they report I believe on Wednesday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7864760","7868760"," They have a twelve percent move expectation on Wednesday."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7872760","7875760"," This is the morning of Wednesday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7875760","7878760"," And they're expecting that twelve percent upside move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7878760","7883760"," So I guess some of you up there are thinking that we don't get the pullback."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7883760","7888760"," You just go up there and just trade that fifty by that forty two or forty one dollars on there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7888760","7891760"," On there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7891760","7893760"," Er I'm not so sure on that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7893760","7897760"," I think that you get the push up into their ER and then it pulls back."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7897760","7899760"," You get the move later."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7899760","7901760"," So I think you're going to get the move later on their ER."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7901760","7906760"," So pay attention to Roblox into their ER if it sells down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7906760","7911760"," You might actually catch that nice dip by for a great trade after their ER."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7912760","7917760"," So far right now though still heading higher still looking for that that sell signal above here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7917760","7919760"," You're going to get one up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7919760","7923760"," I guarantee it you're going to get they're going to try to sell you down here."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7927760","7928760"," I see it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7928760","7930760"," I see the trade up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7930760","7933760"," But I don't know if you actually get the move until later."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7933760","7936760"," You get this other high target above here fifty bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7936760","7939760"," That's the ultimate thing for you as a."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7939760","7941760"," As a Roblox trader."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","7957760","7959760"," They have a twelve point three percent implied move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7959760","7961760"," I think you trade up into their ER."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7961760","7964760"," I think you get the downside move and then it goes up."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7964760","7966760"," On Roblox."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7967760","7969760"," Oh and I wanted to bring up Apple again."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7969760","7975760"," Remember we talked about Apple before the report and I said whatever direction the market is heading in."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7975760","7979760"," Apple should trade that after their ER right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7979760","7982760"," I went back and showed you six or seven Apple ER's."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7982760","7988760"," And I said hey unless they come out with something really nasty or something really crazy that you haven't heard."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7988760","7995760"," Right crazy news expect Apple to trade with the market and it should trade with the market."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7995760","7997760"," So just a heads up with that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","7997760","8000760"," So Apple should follow the market in the coming weeks."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","8193760","8196760"," Oh look at this bad boy here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8196760","8199760"," This one's saucy right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8199760","8203760"," This one is dangerous as fuck this kind of thing we just throw a bunch of fucking."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8203760","8206760"," Throw through a fucking thousand bucks at it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8206760","8213760"," Some whatever calls are available."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8214760","8215760"," I'm looking at their options."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8215760","8222760"," It's looking pretty fucked up right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8222760","8227760"," We work as like."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8227760","8233760"," Yeah I'm looking at them right now and it's looking like."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8233760","8236760"," It says zero down here is their year."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8236760","8241760"," Your tag is right fucking zero."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8242760","8247760"," Oh boy we work we work."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8247760","8251760"," There seems to always be a magic number of like 36."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8251760","8256760"," And I always remember like 36 cents and 60 cents being important."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8256760","8262760"," Keep we work on your said alert like 60 cents and 35 cents."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8262760","8266760"," Maybe 40 cents on we work."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8267760","8272760"," And you might actually get I know that I know they're going to go bankrupt but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8272760","8277760"," They have a chance of at least printing some cash."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8277760","8279760"," We work."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8279760","8284760"," That fucking thing is probably what is that shorted to it's got to be like shorted to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8284760","8287760"," It's got to be shorted to."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8287760","8292760"," Here's spoons just grinding up trying to hit that price target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8292760","8295760"," Big old grind into the clothes right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8295760","8296760"," I'm flat right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8296760","8297760"," I sold out of those calls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8297760","8300760"," I got triggered out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8300760","8301760"," Had some stops on them."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8301760","8302760"," They were gone."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8302760","8305760"," Took my stops and now it's back to running again."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8305760","8310760"," But I made a bunch of money so I can't complain."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8310760","8312760"," What else do we have here?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8312760","8317760"," Oh, and Matt is reporting Wednesday's got shit tons of reports Wednesday's got like."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8317760","8318760"," What do I do?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8318760","8322760"," Do you guys want to do AMC for Wednesday?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8323760","8327760"," I guess AMC would be the most interesting one, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8327760","8328760"," Twilio unity."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8328760","8333760"," I guess I'll do unity and I'll do AMC next."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8333760","8338760"," So let's do AMC."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8338760","8340760"," They already had a big move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8340760","8343760"," GME already had a big move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8343760","8350760"," Looks like they're getting it out of their system already, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8350760","8354760"," Well, man, you want to trade that up there, don't you?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8354760","8356760"," You got nothing there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8356760","8359760"," You got this one now that's looking like it's doing it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8359760","8360760"," I think it wants to go there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8360760","8367760"," But you just fucking all these AMC monsters are saying we're going to trade that 13 bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8367760","8369760"," As long as you stay on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8369760","8371760"," Yes, you can for AMC."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8371760","8373760"," Same thing is back here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8373760","8375760"," You can't be breaking."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8375760","8377760"," I want to show you guys something here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8378760","8381760"," I'm going to show you guys something important."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8381760","8387760"," So oftentimes traders or investors are meme traders."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8387760","8393760"," You know, it's shit like this, where they don't, like you see that we're on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8393760","8395760"," We're on trend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8395760","8400760"," Come back down to that buy zone and it gets sold, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8400760","8402760"," And there's no stops there, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8402760","8405760"," So it's like, oh, fuck, I'm caught in here now, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8405760","8406760"," Come back up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8407760","8408760"," Oh, please let me out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8408760","8410760"," And nope, they're not going to let you out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8410760","8413760"," They're going to squeeze you down some more, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8413760","8419760"," But this is the key one right here is are you holding this or not?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8419760","8420760"," Right."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8420760","8424760"," And the hourly trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8424760","8427760"," And so right here, same thing, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8427760","8430760"," Yeah, you want to buy the dip on AMC?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8430760","8433760"," Sure, you can buy it on the hour and the half hour."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8434760","8436760"," Ten bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8436760","8441760"," Do you put stops under here every fucking time?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8441760","8443760"," Do you guys put stops out there?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8443760","8445760"," Probably not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8445760","8447760"," I'm going to go with probably not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8447760","8449760"," You probably don't put stops under here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8449760","8451760"," You're like, I'm going to buy the dip down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8451760","8453760"," And then you're like, Hey, did you did you sell it?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8453760","8454760"," Did you sell?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8454760","8456760"," Did you sell down when we did this?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8456760","8457760"," Did you sell?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8457760","8458760"," No."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8458760","8459760"," Did you sell that?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8459760","8460760"," Nope."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8460760","8465760"," You can't help anyone that gets caught in this kind of stuff."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8465760","8476760"," So as long as this holds down here, I'll still give it to you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8476760","8480760"," You can get up there and trade that 13 bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8480760","8483760"," Do I think you trade higher than that?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8483760","8488760"," Do I think you trade this right here?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8488760","8490760"," Twenty bucks, 1939."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8490760","8497760"," And some kind of crazy report or even Valhalla at 25 bucks on AMC."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8497760","8501760"," I doubt it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8501760","8502760"," I doubt it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8502760","8505760"," I think you're going to get panic sellers here and even up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8505760","8512760"," You've got an implied move on AMC of."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8512760","8514760"," What do you have as an implied move for AMC?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8515760","8517760"," I don't want to look for AMC up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8517760","8519760"," I don't know where the fuck it is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8519760","8520760"," Hold on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8520760","8522760"," We'll go back to unity here in just a minute."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8522760","8523760"," I know it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8523760","8525760"," AMC is on Wednesday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8525760","8536760"," AMC 12.4% implied move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8536760","8539760"," Boy, they ain't giving you much are they, huh?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8539760","8540760"," They're telling you fuck you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8540760","8543760"," That's the most you're going to get."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8543760","8546760"," Well, they're real shitheads, aren't they?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8546760","8549760"," That's all they're telling you're going to get right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8549760","8554760"," They're like, that's the best you can expect right now on AMC."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8554760","8557760"," That's what they're telling you right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8557760","8562760"," Um, personally."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8562760","8570760"," If personally, um, I don't know."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8571760","8575760"," Uh, what's my thoughts here in AMC?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8575760","8578760"," Keep riding the wave up and sell that hourly trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8578760","8580760"," I don't see any."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8580760","8583760"," Like I see the, I see the hourly cross here over the daily trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8583760","8585760"," I see the turn up on the daily trigger."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8585760","8592760"," That's all positive, but your velocity on the daily is too high."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8592760","8598760"," I see that big bad boy down there and then you're just getting new highs right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8598760","8601760"," Um, let's check on some prior."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8601760","8608760"," I mean, you seem to sell this stuff up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8608760","8609760"," 137."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8609760","8612760"," Yeah."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8612760","8617760"," Yeah, I mean."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8617760","8623760"," I'm not seeing like the, the reason to go up."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8623760","8627760"," Like I see the reason they go up down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8628760","8637760"," Uh, I also see like a topping action over here. So."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8637760","8645760"," Um, yeah, I guess I'll give you this."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","8674760","8678760"," 12 bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8678760","8688760"," That's what you get for your earnings. Uh, do I, do I think you're going to get like a scam, uh, bullshit news and bloodbath on AMC earnings? I don't."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8688760","8697760"," I think you're going to see a claim that, uh, that, uh, things are looking up for movies."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8697760","8705760"," And for cinema and, uh, return to cinema over time and it'll be a tailwind for AMC."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8705760","8710760"," So there you go. Tailwind for AMC, but I don't see you getting above that 12 bucks."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","8940760","8950760"," I'm going to do a on semi conductor."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8950760","8960760"," I like that. I like them too, believe it or not."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8960760","8970760"," Uh oh. Can't be getting drooping in this close here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8970760","8978760"," What do you mean to do? You guys are going to do on like O and ticker symbol O and like on semi conductor."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","8978760","8985760"," Say something."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9019760","9025760"," It's got a rejection point here at sixty nine thirty three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9025760","9039760"," Here's this is on by the way."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9039760","9044760"," Here you go."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9044760","9052760"," On must stay above sixty seven dollars."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9052760","9060760"," They should get 70. Here's the good 70 right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9060760","9069760"," Up side price target on it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9069760","9074760"," 80 bucks. This is on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9074760","9079760"," Uh, I do want to say something to you though. Don't forget this. Okay."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9097760","9106760"," Uh, where you may not actually see that squeeze up there. This is what I want to show you here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9106760","9111760"," This is what your thought is right there. We're going to squeeze up into on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9111760","9119760"," Uh, but I see more downside to come for them. Some bearish on on overall."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9119760","9127760"," Uh, whatever squeeze you this gap you want to close up here. I still think that it's going down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9127760","9134760"," So, uh, key points here on on is if there's any rejection."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9134760","9140760"," On this monthly."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9140760","9144760"," Uh, not bullish."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9144760","9147760"," So if you start to see."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9147760","9151760"," See any kind of nonsense like this and it starts to drag ass down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9151760","9154760"," Uh, ultimately we're going down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9155760","9159760"," Uh, $45."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9159760","9162760"," Got me. And even if you go up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9162760","9166760"," I still think you come back down to reality. So upside target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9166760","9170760"," 80 bucks. Uh, just another opportunity to sell this shit down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9170760","9173760"," Uh, to 46."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9173760","9179760"," So overall bearish on on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9179760","9185760"," Now, and you're going to expect that to happen by springtime."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9185760","9192760"," I'm getting trapped here. I gotta, I gotta watch my calls here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9192760","9195760"," Hold on here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9195760","9198760"," I got some shitty, cheap calls for the clothes here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9198760","9208760"," I'm trying to sell me down. Reject me on this one minute down here. Oh, shit."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9209760","9211760"," I want to see this five minute hold."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9211760","9218760"," Stops are going to be below this red line right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9218760","9222760"," Not good. Don't like seeing that. Don't like seeing this right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9222760","9225760"," That's bad news. They're going to try to blast me down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9225760","9230760"," Grab my stops."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9230760","9237760"," Pay close attention to this here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9237760","9241760"," Uh, I'm bullish on on to close that gap."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9241760","9245760"," Uh, but I do think it's going to get distributed. So to the downside."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9245760","9250760"," So overall, into spring and into springtime and late winter and fall."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9250760","9252760"," Expect to see that $50."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9252760","9261760"," Um, that gap closure to the down or that gap closure. The upside should get sold off."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9261760","9264760"," Bleeding again right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9264760","9279760"," Yeah, I don't doubt that the dealer is going to grind those calls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9279760","9281760"," They're going to try."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9281760","9286760"," You're going to try to pin this at 435 into the bell. I'm hoping for the creepy crawly up into the wall."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9286760","9293760"," That's my, that's my plan at least."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9293760","9298760"," I'm hoping for that. I'm hoping for that squeeze up into the close for the weekend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9298760","9301760"," We're bleeding right now. We're bleeding pretty bad."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9301760","9304760"," There are 11 cents right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9304760","9320760"," I'm just adding another fucking, I just added another 25 packs."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9325760","9330760"," This looks pretty fucking bearish here, but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9330760","9333760"," I want to see, I want to see that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9334760","9344760"," The bulls don't get this. I'm not the bulls can't get this close up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9344760","9351760"," They need to get it done by Monday. So they have to have to money to get it done, but."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9351760","9353760"," I want to see that. I want to see this here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9353760","9359760"," Gamma's all saying we should go up there at some point. So we'll see."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9359760","9363760"," These fucking dealers don't want to pay it though. I can already stick out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9363760","9366760"," Now 500,000 calls."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9366760","9372760"," 435. They were at like 60 cents earlier. That's 74 right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9372760","9376760"," I'm assuming they're going to print those."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9376760","9380760"," As cheaply as possible for spreads."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9380760","9385760"," Then try to squirrel this up into the bell here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9385760","9388760"," Try not to pay fucking anything else."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9389760","9392760"," What else we got? Okay, so next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9392760","9396760"," I'm not I'm going. I just went through next week's earnings."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9396760","9402760"," There's like 20 to 30 tickers that need to be."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9402760","9408760"," That need to be reviewed. Let's get unity because I know you guys like this company too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9408760","9411760"," 30."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9411760","9416760"," Unity coming into their daily trigger right now giant."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9416760","9419760"," Giant bull flag."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9423760","9429760"," They have a report coming out next week too and bullish to $33 on them."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9429760","9432760"," They actually look quite bullish too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9432760","9436760"," At least inter intermediary."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9436760","9440760"," Bullish on unity."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9440760","9444760"," Into their ER."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9445760","9454760"," We got some we got some tickers to go over this week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9454760","9464760"," So close, but yet so far away."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9465760","9469760"," So close."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9469760","9471760"," Maybe you're going to need."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9471760","9474760"," We're going to we're going to need."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9474760","9480760"," We need futures to put us up there because cash market can't get it done."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9480760","9484760"," Cash market can't get this done."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9484760","9488760"," They need futures to put it up there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9489760","9493760"," I don't want to see this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9493760","9497760"," I don't want to see this loop get lost here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9497760","9508760"," No, you're not. You have until Monday to do it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9508760","9514760"," You have until Monday to like they can put it up there between four and six PM today."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9514760","9517760"," They can do it over the weekend."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9518760","9522760"," If like if cash market doesn't think they can get it done, they'll do it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9522760","9525760"," When you went the same thing on the downside, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9525760","9528760"," I'll just fucking they'll just change price on you."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9528760","9535760"," Like, yeah, somebody sold 40 trillion dollars between four AM and six six AM this morning"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9535760","9541760"," and you're like, no, they didn't."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9541760","9545760"," So between you have until now until Monday to know if it's going to crash or some."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9545760","9548760"," I gave you guys a put spread for Wednesday."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9548760","9552760"," You can go back in the broadcast and look at that put spread."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9552760","9556760"," We talked about earlier in the broadcast into Wednesday, but they still have time."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9556760","9563760"," It pulls out until Monday open or so."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9563760","9572760"," No, I sold all I sold for the second, the second MBI trade that I've had this quarter sold out of those at this point."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9572760","9574760"," I'm just looking for a dip by next week."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9574760","9579760"," If I can get a dip by on Wednesday or something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9579760","9585760"," I'm going to grab another rack for the 31st again and run them back up again."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9595760","9597760"," Put that trade on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9603760","9604760"," Hey, it's Friday, baby."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9604760","9605760"," No drinking."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9605760","9610760"," I was going to say I would do a drink toast to you guys today, but that shit is not happening."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9613760","9615760"," There's no way that shit's happening."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9617760","9619760"," Like Mr. Vominus."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9623760","9624760"," Row it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9624760","9625760"," I missed you, Row it."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9625760","9626760"," What did you say here, brother?"

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9647760","9648760"," Sorry."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9648760","9651760"," I'm trying to watch a trade that I'm in here too."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9651760","9652760"," GFS."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9652760","9654760"," Global Foundries."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9654760","9656760"," Oh boy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9666760","9669760"," Global Foundries looks good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9669760","9671760"," Let me go."

"_qZpSLW1VN4","9678760","9681760"," You've got a nice bull flag here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9681760","9682760"," Bull flag."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9682760","9683760"," But let's see."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9683760","9684760"," Look at this."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9684760","9686760"," You got a bull flag right here, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9686760","9688760"," And it fakes you out, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9688760","9690760"," Right back down again, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9690760","9693760"," Same thing's kind of setting up here, isn't it?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9693760","9695760"," More down, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9695760","9696760"," Yeah."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9696760","9698760"," One, two, and three down there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9698760","9702760"," So on this one, GFS."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9703760","9705760"," Not a buyer."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9705760","9707760"," At $54."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9707760","9709760"," This is take the money and run."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9709760","9711760"," You get out of here at $54, right?"
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9711760","9713760"," You get out right now, actually, on GFS."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9713760","9717760"," And you wait for it to get above $54 to go to $56."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9717760","9720760"," This looks like more sell the news."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9720760","9721760"," As of right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9721760","9724760"," So the take on this one is going to be."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9725760","9727760"," More downside to come."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9741760","9743760"," Looking for 40 bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9743760","9744760"," On GFS."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9755760","9757760"," Up to three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9757760","9759760"," One, two, three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9759760","9760760"," Well, one, two, three."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9760760","9763760"," I guess you're thinking that's three and it's done."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9763760","9765760"," But no."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9765760","9767760"," No, you're in a downtrend right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9767760","9770760"," GFS, bull bearish."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9770760","9775760"," Until you get above $60."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9775760","9777760"," Take it up 60 bucks."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9777760","9779760"," Looking for another sell signal."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9780760","9782760"," And $30 is that price target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9782760","9783760"," You got 40."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9783760","9785760"," And then you got a bloodbath to 30."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9785760","9787760"," I'm bearish on this ticker."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9787760","9789760"," Next one."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9789760","9792760"," C N P G."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9793760","9795760"," Next one."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9795760","9803760"," C N P G."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9803760","9807760"," I spoke that wrong."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9807760","9812760"," Who paying."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9813760","9822760"," I would have to check there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9822760","9826760"," I would have to check this tickers fundamentals."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9826760","9830760"," First, but without seeing fundamentals in this company."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9830760","9835760"," I do like a new low new low new low like all that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9835760","9836760"," Check this is good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9836760","9837760"," Check this is good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9837760","9838760"," Check this is good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9838760","9839760"," Check this is good."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9839760","9842760"," One, two, and three for an upside move."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9842760","9844760"," I like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9844760","9848760"," You're taking out these previous people here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9848760","9851760"," You try to take these guys out up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9851760","9853760"," There's more sellers up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9853760","9858760"," You're already took out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9858760","9862760"," You already took these guys out up here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9862760","9866760"," So I like this ticker."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9866760","9870760"," I like this ticker a lot."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9870760","9874760"," Now you've got a daily cross to the downside here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9874760","9877760"," This is bearish."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9877760","9878760"," It looks bearish at least."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9878760","9881760"," This cross looks bearish, but I don't think that it is."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9881760","9883760"," I think this is a good dip by down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9883760","9895760"," And I'll look at it on a smaller time frame and see what it's saying here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9895760","9896760"," You've got that cross right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9896760","9906760"," That's pretty fucking bearish, but you have the dip buyers step in high or low."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9906760","9921760"," I like it over time."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9921760","9935760"," You're going to get some trouble in here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9935760","9940760"," It's going to come back down."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9940760","9951760"," Right there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9951760","9953760"," Here are something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9953760","9959760"," Squeeze and fail."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9959760","9972760"," This one should actually get you above."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9972760","9973760"," Bullish on this ticker."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9973760","9976760"," CPNG bullish."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9976760","9977760"," I'm getting smoked right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9977760","9979760"," I've got five cent calls here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9979760","9980760"," I'm getting destroyed here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9980760","9981760"," Hold on a second."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9981760","9992760"," I've got to go back to spy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9992760","9998760"," Getting a nice roll here and spoons."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","9998760","10000760"," Big, big cross right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10000760","10003760"," Bearish cross right here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10004760","10007760"," I've got a bunch of calls out."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10007760","10011760"," Not a bunch of like some."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10011760","10014760"," I got 45 fucking 45."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10014760","10018760"," 436 is here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10018760","10019760"," They're so cheap right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10019760","10021760"," They're so fucking smoked right now."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10021760","10025760"," I'm going to just leave them on."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10025760","10029760"," I'm trying to sell this down into Friday clothes."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10030760","10032760"," Half hour triggers down below."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10032760","10043760"," Again, Bostik says 43.02 with our outlook."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10043760","10048760"," Hoping for minimal pain in the economy."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10048760","10052760"," There's your downside target into the clothes down here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10052760","10055760"," Downside target."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10055760","10058760"," Right down here for that close."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10058760","10062760"," Although I think they park 435 into this close."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10062760","10066760"," Looks like that's what they want to park for 435 into the bell."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10066760","10072760"," There's 500,000 calls in that 435 and dealers are not going to want to print them."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10072760","10073760"," I'm still long calls here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10073760","10077760"," I want to see bulls get up here before Friday clothes."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10077760","10081760"," If not Monday, Tuesday, Monday, Sunday clothes, something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10081760","10085760"," Monday opens something like that."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10085760","10088760"," That's Bostik's all in the focus here."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10088760","10093760"," Show the economy is moderating there."
"_qZpSLW1VN4","10100760","10102760"," Yes, Q is good."
