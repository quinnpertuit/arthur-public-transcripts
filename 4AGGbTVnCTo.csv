"180","360"," Find out."
"8130","9210"," Yee-haw, doggy."
"10050","11070"," You're up and running again. "
"11750","15129"," Oh, I gotta change all these, uh, a lot of the chairs."
"16770","20830"," I have to see what we're doing here."
"21330","22030"," We got a lot to do. "
"22310","23190"," We got lots of cover, too."
"24790","25570"," What's going on?"
"25750","26470"," Fair town chair."
"26470","27510"," I see you out there. "
"27670","28110"," What up?"
"28510","29690"," Hope the juice box."
"31930","33130"," You guys hear me out there?"
"34990","36730"," I don't know if you guys can actually hear me."
"36830","37430"," I don't know if you guys can actually hear me. "
"37430","38530"," I don't know if you guys can actually hear me."
"38530","53120"," I don't know if"
"53120","53120"," you guys can hear me."
"53120","53880"," Oh, you can't hear me. "
"55200","57560"," I didn't think you guys could hear me over the, uh, intro."
"62060","63360"," Hold on a second there."
"63360","72560"," There we go, bit it. "
"75480","76920"," What's going on out there?"
"77200","78780"," I've got some weirdness going on today."
"78880","80340"," I don't know what that is."
"80360","81540"," That's a white movement there. "
"82760","87920"," I have, like, like, so then my cat came in and sort of, like, ripped everything out of the office."
"88200","89000"," Like, white into naming."
"89340","90920"," Just, like, starting to destroy it. "
"91120","92620"," Something gets stuck in the floor over there, too."
"93740","94580"," Hold on a second."
"95440","96480"," Good morning, everybody. "
"96840","97640"," Are y'all doing out there?"
"97640","98740"," All right."
"100020","102360"," So we got a bunch of stuff to go over this morning."
"102900","104480"," Uh, cool stuff. "
"104640","105460"," Come on here."
"105880","110300"," Uh, some Tesla stuff we have to go over this morning."
"111240","111980"," You know what?"
"112280","119100"," Hate, not hate, but, uh, I hate going over Tesla stuff sometimes because..."
"119100","119480"," Good morning. "
"120200","122480"," Good to see all you guys out there."
"123100","125760"," Hate going over Tesla stuff because..."
"125760","127120"," I'm supposed to track Bitcoin."
"127520","129160"," Uh, uh, why?"
"129440","130820"," You want the true answer?"
"131040","132980"," I'll give you the true answer if you want the real answer. "
"133100","133340"," Why the difference?"
"133980","135280"," Uh, and the answer is..."
"135280","136340"," Turn some of this off here."
"136540","136700"," Hold on."
"136880","139800"," Just stop this blah, blah, blah from CNBC. "
"140800","143140"," Um, especially today you should turn..."
"143140","144900"," CNBC should be turned off today."
"145760","149460"," Uh, they should be turned off, like, when they say shit, like, expect rate cuts and stuff like"
"149460","149820"," that, too."
"149920","153940"," Like, days like today, uh, bullish or bearish from their perspective. "
"154380","155300"," Just turn them off."
"155420","156120"," You don't listen to them."
"156700","157680"," Uh, hold on a second. "
"157780","158940"," I gotta do one quick thing."
"160820","161580"," Come on in."
"161740","162020"," Join us. "
"162400","168200"," These levels are not up to date, um, on your date trade."
"168400","170460"," Try to gotta change these for you here in just a second."
"170680","172660"," But we'll, we'll talk, we'll, we'll change these together here. "
"173160","174980"," Uh, we've talked Tesla today."
"179720","180600"," And, um..."
"180600","181740"," I'm gonna do Tesla on days like today."
"182060","186720"," It's because, um, you know, I fall, I'm a Tesla bull. "
"186900","188400"," I'm gonna do traffic, dude, is, uh, Lachok."
"188820","190860"," He says, uh, China is listening to them on."
"191020","191160"," Yes. "
"191160","192080"," May already have peaked."
"192440","195020"," That's PX, and we'll do some Qs."
"196560","197000"," QQQ. "
"198220","203080"," And what happens is you'll get someone like me come out here and talk to you about giving you a"
"203080","204480"," real true Tesla update."
"205340","205920"," Like, legit."
"208540","211360"," It's so fucking hard to find a legit test update. "
"211820","212400"," I'll be honest."
"214640","215500"," Let me see here."
"217600","219820"," The reason being, I'm gonna give you the truth. "
"220080","220920"," You want the real fucking truth?"
"221100","221380"," I'll be honest."
"221600","223540"," I should have said enough for it, but I'll give you the real truth."
"223720","228640"," The reason being is that a lot of YouTubers, I'll call y'all out. "
"228980","230300"," A lot of YouTubers out there."
"230840","235360"," You predicate your whole shtick."
"236700","243560"," You know, it's either being Tesla Q, where it's just always doom and fucking gloom, or it's always"
"243560","244040"," bullish. "
"244660","254560"," It's always weird because not recently, but I think about six months ago or something, I"
"254560","260140"," was tuning into a Tesla YouTube channel that I actually liked, or like or liked."
"260140","265400"," And they were trash in someone on their show, some other YouTuber."
"265980","270480"," And they were like, you know, that guy right there, it wasn't me, but that guy right there doesn't"
"270480","272560"," know what they're talking about. "
"272800","280060"," And this channel predicates themselves on knowing every last little tiny detail, arguing good"
"280060","282380"," things for Tesla bulls, stuff like that."
"282780","285140"," Now, the channel they were making fun of it went and checked them out."
"285280","286080"," Yeah, they kind of sucked. "
"286400","293060"," But the truth is that the truth here is that the kernel of truth and all of this is that"
"293060","298580"," you don't always get the real fucking story from either fucking side."
"298580","300020"," I'll be honest, I'm gonna fucking say it."
"300060","300220"," Okay. "
"301160","305640"," And, you know, so you have to be aware of who you're listening to on YouTube on Fintuit."
"305860","306660"," It doesn't matter the news."
"307300","309020"," It doesn't matter where, especially with Tesla specifically. "
"309680","311480"," There's a lot of garbage out there."
"311720","314880"," Now, there's a lot of good stuff out there, too, but that doesn't have anything to do with the"
"314880","315940"," fucking price of Tesla."
"317380","318740"," And I'm gonna say it again. "
"319100","323640"," I was a matter of fact, last night, middle of fucking night at like 4 a.m. or 3 a "
"323640","328340",".m. I went into the couple of the Tesla investor subreddits."
"329840","333120"," And, you know, it's the same old fucking shit, you know, then."
"335540","339760"," One of these subreddits I was in last night was like, just buy it no matter what. "
"340080","342100"," And, you know, it's the same old fucking thing."
"342440","346580"," You don't know that person's positioning."
"346840","348480"," You don't know when they started buying Tesla. "
"349000","351700"," You don't know if they were fucking buying Tesla goddamn four or five years ago."
"352280","353580"," You don't know what their DC is."
"353700","357080"," You don't know if they're selling fucking selling goddamn calls against their positions. "
"357900","365920"," You don't know if they don't care where you're buying because they're in at fucking $9 or $100 or"
"365920","367180"," whatever, right?"
"367360","369120"," So, wherever we are, they don't give a fuck."
"369260","370200"," They just want you to buy it."
"370200","371780"," It only helps them, you know. "
"372180","376080"," But the truth is, for a lot of you out there, the real truth is, I'm gonna tell you this"
"376080","376500"," is the truth."
"377060","383560"," Because I get DMs from people and I have for years where they buy the wrong place, where they"
"383560","388300"," second mortgage their home, where they're fucking disappeared, gone."
"389540","392220"," So, the truth is, I'm a testable. "
"392680","396640"," The truth is, you fucking do want to buy the major lows."
"397000","399060"," That's where you want to fucking buy."
"399440","400760"," I don't know how to say it louder. "
"401940","409400"," I don't know how I don't know how to fucking shake you out there at home in your office wherever"
"409400","420300"," you are and promise you that you always want to be the fucking dip buyer, the low buyer, and"
"420300","421620"," there's nothing like it."
"423000","425780"," It is the best feeling in the fucking world."
"426120","427140"," I'm gonna say it enough, bomb again. "
"427720","428760"," Probably get demonetized."
"429040","429420"," I don't care."
"430200","434380"," You don't want to be buying wherever, whatever you have a paycheck available. "
"434940","438840"," Put that fucking money away somewhere you get five or ten percent and wait."
"440520","443940"," I'm telling you, I don't know why this is hard to believe some of you."
"445220","453860"," I have most of my friends are long time testable and they will in private tell you, well they might"
"453860","458500"," not tell you in public, but they tell me in private the same fucking thing I'm telling you. "
"461000","463600"," So, you know, you want to be you want to be a Tesla bull."
"463700","465620"," You want to be a Tesla Kool-Aid drinker bull."
"466140","467620"," That's great and fine and dandy. "
"467800","468380"," I love that."
"469500","471560"," Separate that from when you buy Tesla."
"472380","475380"," Separate that from being like a happy Tesla bull. "
"475860","479020"," You want to be that Tesla bull out there that's telling you to buy at any fucking price?"
"479820","481120"," You do what I tell you to do."
"481880","482560"," You get me?"
"483180","484660"," Because you will then turn into that person."
"485220","490400"," It's telling everybody in public all that shit and arguing and fighting and, you know, you say"
"490400","491700"," anything negative about Tesla. "
"492040","494180"," It's like, oh, you don't know every little last detail."
"494560","497580"," Because they used to be that guy like I know everything and all this and all this."
"497780","498780"," But I'm not that guy anymore. "
"499280","502280"," I'm a cold fucking, I'm a cold asshole when it comes to Tesla."
"503060","503820"," Because I'm happier."
"504540","507520"," I'll be honest with you in real life, I'm fucking stoked, you know. "
"508000","511640"," And I got to tell you man, it's the best way to be a Tesla bull."
"511640","514520"," You can go out there and you have to have that different hat, right?"
"514580","516960"," Put that hat on where you listen to everything."
"516960","520539"," You get all your trust, all your dust, all your teeth, all your eyes. "
"520760","527500"," But the truth is, the real hard brass tacks truth is, what I tell you about being a Tesla bull"
"527500","532340"," that rubs people the wrong way, is the right way to be a fucking Tesla bull."
"532840","534100"," That is the right way."
"534960","538380"," You don't want to be buying every top, waiting 20, 30 years. "
"538380","542140"," You want to be the guy that buys the bottoms every fucking time."
"542640","543920"," And know where they are."
"544320","545980"," And I'm telling you, your life will be different. "
"546900","547980"," You'll be a happier person."
"549600","554860"," So anyways, I almost, that post I made this morning at, I think I made it at three or four"
"554860","555300"," this morning."
"555580","558840"," I wanted to expound upon that post, but I was like, I ain't doing it. "
"559400","560700"," I'm like, I ain't going to say it."
"560840","562560"," So we're going to talk about it today."
"562560","568160"," And the reason I didn't want to say more this morning truthfully was because it's complex. "
"569980","571800"," And you could be misconstrued."
"573360","579380"," And what's going to happen, what to look for these kind of things, how that matters to Tesla."
"580260","581540"," Now, Tesla can go up here. "
"582580","585620"," But there are some mechanics that we have to watch."
"586160","587920"," Whether you're a seller or buyer, I don't care."
"588500","593560"," There's some mechanics that are involved with Tesla right now that can lead to some significant"
"593560","594040"," downside. "
"595680","597300"," But can recover as well."
"597500","599180"," And if it does recover, you can be a buyer there."
"599560","602980"," If it doesn't recover, you're going to be looking for a kick-ass load of buy. "
"604240","609400"," And you need to be aware of those mechanics as a Tesla bull or even as a seller or a"
"609400","610020"," bear or whatever."
"610020","611500"," You need to be understanding those mechanics."
"611880","613480"," And I'm going to tell you guys something out there. "
"613580","614460"," You don't want to fucking believe."
"615020","617860"," This is fucking Tesla Q and Tesla God damn gang."
"618400","619780"," I don't give a fuck. "
"620920","622180"," I don't give a fuck."
"622360","628520"," When it comes to the price, I don't give a fine fuck about what you're saying on social media as"
"628520","631560"," to why the stock is going up, stock is going down."
"631860","632640"," I'll be honest with you. "
"633040","633860"," I don't give a fuck."
"635180","635900"," You're wrong."
"635900","642280"," 90% of the time, bulls and bears, for all the shit that you quote out there on fucking social"
"642280","647820"," media, all the fucking news articles that are out there that are good, all wrong. "
"648440","651420"," Like literally 100% all goddamn wrong."
"652240","653360"," There's a time to buy Tesla."
"653900","655880"," It's a time to sit on your hands if you're a Tesla bull. "
"656600","660920"," When you start to learn that right, you start to push all that bullshit out of the out to the"
"660920","661240"," side."
"661960","664480"," And you start looking for those lows to fucking buy."
"665280","670180"," And when those opportunities present themselves, you're fucking Johnny on the spot ready to go. "
"670840","671920"," You got to say my point here."
"672500","677340"," And then you can go out and you can like spin your shit all you want."
"678460","682620"," But just know deep down inside your heart and your pocket and your bank and everything else that"
"682620","683960"," you bought the right fucking place. "
"684500","687000"," I'm going to tell you, it's going to give you a fucking smile from air to air."
"687740","689340"," And you got to separate the two."
"689340","690420"," You have to. "
"690680","692280"," I promise you."
"692840","696140"," There have been so many times, so many times."
"697620","701360"," I've had like, I still think about these things this day. "
"701560","703140"," Like we'll be in a major high in Tesla."
"703820","705040"," I'll get DMs from people."
"705500","705960"," Literally. "
"706480","707740"," I just mortgaged my house."
"709740","710580"," Second mortgage."
"711300","712220"," I just bought Tesla here. "
"712520","713060"," Fuck you, Captain."
"713640","714860"," You're not a real Tesla bull."
"715860","716420"," Right?"
"717280","718440"," Two, three weeks later. "
"719360","720560"," That was a major top."
"721720","722360"," You know what happens?"
"723100","724880"," They delete their fucking Twitter accounts."
"725100","726620"," They delete their fucking Reddit accounts. "
"727200","728400"," You don't see them ever again."
"729640","735480"," And they're sitting there at home in their office, either losing their house, their kids, their"
"735480","735700"," wife."
"736720","740180"," Even if it's going to come back, even if they didn't sell and just kept holding. "
"740620","744520"," They're at home grinding all day long for months and months and months."
"744520","747580"," And then when they finally get back there, guess what they do?"
"748520","750880"," They fucking sell with no profit."
"750880","752960"," Even if they even they come back to zero or even. "
"755220","759120"," Like they patting down the ashes off their burnt coat or whatever."
"759580","760780"," I'm like, I don't want to do that again."
"760960","762980"," I don't want to sit there for the next six months or a year. "
"763200","765720"," If you try telling me that's not real, get fucked."
"766860","768220"," Because that's happened to me."
"769660","770240"," You understand?"
"771300","774080"," That's why when you when you see a major correction, right?"
"774080","778640"," When you see a major correction in anything, see like a major peak, right?"
"779180","780620"," Major correction to the downside. "
"781040","782380"," Something insane like that, right?"
"782740","783040"," Bloodbath."
"783820","786260"," See that consolidation for six months or a year."
"786360","787540"," It comes back up again, right?"
"788080","790220"," And at the moment you get back up here, this is now what?"
"790400","792020"," Two, three years or something, year and a half. "
"792300","793760"," Whatever the fuck it is, time-wise."
"794620","796580"," And you see this major first sell right here."
"796680","796940"," You know what?"
"797120","797640"," What that is?"
"798820","801000"," That's that fucking guy that mortgages his house. "
"802420","807100"," That guy is on social media telling you it's going to the moon."
"807500","809800"," He's way upside down for a long, long, long time."
"810220","812120"," Then he sells and doesn't tell you. "
"814670","818410"," That's a major lesson for a bull right there."
"818610","820150"," That shit I'm showing you right there."
"820430","822970"," That shit happens to you two, three times with big money. "
"823650","826170"," You fucking learn or you get the fuck out of the market."
"826370","826890"," That is true."
"827770","829050"," It's true all over the place. "
"829250","832070"," Happens all the time on symbols in this market."
"832070","835330"," But happening for decades and decades and decades and decades."
"835890","838770"," So you're going to either learn the easy way or you're going to win the fucking hard way. "
"839490","842190"," And there are real world implications to that shit."
"842690","845650"," Your wife does come home and says, what did you do?"
"846330","849850"," I bought fucking five hundred thousand dollars in tassel today at fifteen hundred bucks."
"850470","851070"," Here you go. "
"851490","852790"," And she's like, you should go up."
"853010","854010"," Fuck yeah baby it is."
"854430","856890"," Come back a month later and you're like, what the fuck happened?"
"859250","860230"," Get laid off. "
"860770","864130"," Nine months later, you can't make those payments on that refi you did."
"865050","868250"," I'm telling you guys, there are real world implications to this."
"868690","871270"," And then after all that shit I just talked to you about, right?"
"871630","874950"," You got other people in your air telling you to buy tassel all day long, right?"
"875690","878710"," Those people are fucking buying tassel with a thousand fucking dollars. "
"879930","885050"," And you're like, I want to invest thirty percent of my hundred thousand dollar a year job for the"
"885050","885690"," next ten years."
"885690","888870"," And you're listening to some fucking guy gambling a thousand bucks a week."
"888890","889970"," Fuck that guy too. "
"891010","891930"," You know what I'm saying?"
"892650","896550"," So, I don't know what this, I don't know what they're coming to in this conversation right now."
"896830","899530"," But this conversation is a fucking serious one."
"900490","902010"," But you got real money out there. "
"902490","906070"," You want to be a happy fucking tassel bull, right?"
"906270","910530"," You can go and listen to your show out there on YouTube or your guy out there on fucking fin"
"910530","910910"," to it."
"911230","914530"," Or your fucking, whatever news is popular for tassela."
"915230","916930"," You can consume all that shit. "
"917130","918810"," You can rah, rah, rah and all that shit."
"918990","924790"," But that is not as nothing to fucking do with you being a what?"
"924950","927090"," A responsible investor, right?"
"927350","928430"," A responsible buyer."
"929210","930630"," Be a happy fucking buyer. "
"932650","936870"," When we're on those lows, when we're on those lows, right?"
"937670","939430"," There ain't nobody down there fucking buying."
"939650","941690"," Matter of fact, the last one we just had, right?"
"942430","945950"," The last one we just had, we're down at fucking 100 bucks or something, 110 bucks?"
"947170","947790"," How many?"
"949790","953490"," How many fucking famous tassel bulls said they weren't buying that shit?"
"954250","956890"," I'm not going to name names here in the show, but I know who they are."
"957850","959110"," They didn't buy that shit. "
"959710","962090"," They fucking went public and told you they weren't buying that shit."
"962790","966130"," The feeling at that time was, don't fucking buy this."
"967730","968530"," We bought it. "
"968530","971950"," It was awesome."
"973050","974070"," I fucking loved it."
"975130","976710"," I sucked myself off. "
"976950","981550"," I fucking bent myself over and fucked myself in the ass because I felt so fucking good buying that"
"981550","981830"," bottom."
"983170","985450"," But most of you were not."
"986290","991630"," And most of you were listening to people with huge follower accounts not buying that bottom. "
"992190","993410"," And I'm telling you what was awesome."
"993950","994670"," I fucking loved it."
"994990","995870"," My friends loved it. "
"996510","997090"," I loved it."
"997570","998310"," We all loved it."
"998850","1000630"," We had a fucking orgy over it. "
"1001890","1006030"," So when you see those lows, that's when you're there joining the spot ready to go."
"1006390","1007570"," That's when you put your blinders on."
"1007690","1008830"," That's when you're not listening to CNBC. "
"1009050","1012950"," It's when you're not listening to the bullshit about, I don't know, fucking too many accidents."
"1013790","1015590"," Look at this, that drug use."
"1016350","1019470"," You want cacophony of negativity. "
"1021730","1023930"," And you want to have that second mortgage."
"1025410","1026910"," Ready to rock then."
"1027609","1031750"," Not at fucking 500,000, 1500, what the fuck the high is. "
"1032130","1035510"," It's when it's in the shitter at 90 fucking dollars."
"1036410","1039109"," Or 89 when they close the gap down there."
"1039450","1041530"," Or they close the other gap down at 60 bucks. "
"1042290","1043349"," You're Johnny on the spot."
"1047310","1050710"," You're the guy down there that I want next to me."
"1051910","1057770"," I don't fucking want some asshole next to me on a high telling me they're fucking doing this and"
"1057770","1058270"," doing that. "
"1058590","1059510"," Fuck that guy."
"1059650","1060310"," That guy is up."
"1060530","1060810"," That guy. "
"1060950","1062210"," I want anything to do with that guy."
"1064380","1065280"," You get what I'm saying?"
"1065820","1071540"," I want to be around people that when shit's flying, shit's on fire."
"1071840","1074400"," That guy's next to me going, I'm sure I shit you not. "
"1074560","1075160"," That guy that's like."
"1077440","1081760"," You see all that shit right now out there and the news and social media man."
"1082060","1084520"," I think you and I are the only two fucking guys down here ready to buy. "
"1085300","1086740"," I've actually made those posts."
"1087920","1089940"," I think you and I are the only one right now."
"1090600","1091660"," For the moment of clarity. "
"1092320","1093520"," And that's on highs too."
"1094840","1098700"," Usually on highs, I'm getting fucking shit on by these major bulls."
"1099280","1100060"," And then the lows. "
"1100920","1103280"," I got fucking bears shit on me, right?"
"1103280","1105200"," It's like two crowds."
"1105880","1107880"," You got like one crowd screaming at you."
"1108100","1108480"," Fuck you. "
"1108600","1109220"," You're not a real bull."
"1109440","1110200"," Always at tops."
"1111720","1112820"," Then you're at the bottom. "
"1113760","1114760"," And what do you see me do?"
"1115080","1115720"," Begging bears."
"1116040","1116220"," Please."
"1117600","1118820"," Close your fucking shorts here. "
"1119440","1120600"," You're going to get run over."
"1121000","1122220"," They're like fuck you cap."
"1123140","1123560"," You know. "
"1123880","1125780"," So you got like first you got this crowd."
"1126080","1126980"," Then you got that crowd."
"1127900","1131100"," It's normally a good indicator that you're in the right place doing the right thing. "
"1131100","1133060"," You're either selling or you're fucking buying, right?"
"1133420","1134140"," Put it up on the crowd."
"1134420","1134500"," So."
"1136280","1138120"," You know, you can go anywhere you want. "
"1138260","1142260"," I'm fine with you going everywhere and posting whatever you want or doing whatever you want on"
"1142260","1142500"," public."
"1142500","1145980"," But you want to know when to buy a dip on Tesla."
"1146460","1147740"," You fucking come here. "
"1148680","1150220"," This is where you fucking come."
"1150340","1151420"," You don't go anywhere fucking else."
"1152600","1154760"," There ain't no other fucking place you go. "
"1154880","1155880"," It's right fucking here."
"1158660","1159700"," That's fucking truth."
"1160220","1161480"," I'll fucking call it as it is. "
"1162340","1162740"," Truth."
"1162980","1163060"," Truth."
"1165060","1165660"," All right. "
"1166380","1167260"," So let's talk Tesla."
"1167700","1169020"," We'll start with Tesla this morning."
"1170580","1172060"," I know you're all wondering. "
"1172480","1173420"," Then we're going to get into some other stuff."
"1173560","1175720"," We're going to get into some stuff because I saw some."
"1176100","1179020"," I had some people ask me some questions this morning on social media and they had said. "
"1179480","1181800"," It said some things like are you because I do ship posts."
"1182100","1182320"," I do."
"1182860","1183920"," I do ship posts. "
"1184420","1190480"," And then I also address a lot of things that have implications on multiple timeframes."
"1191320","1193900"," And sometimes I can become confusing for some people."
"1194720","1197420"," So we're going to discuss that this morning as well. "
"1198120","1200400"," And what those implications are stuff like that."
"1200900","1205660"," It was cool because CPI did come in hot today, which I wanted it to."
"1206080","1207500"," But you don't want to spend too hot, right?"
"1208180","1208460"," And you don't. "
"1208660","1209140"," It's crazy."
"1209360","1212260"," If you're a bull, you want the hot CPI right now."
"1212480","1213100"," Remember last quarter?"
"1213660","1216080"," We had really cool unemployment numbers, right?"
"1216280","1218820"," And they came back and revised them, right?"
"1218820","1226980"," There's a part of the market where right now you kind of want this. "
"1227120","1229100"," Let me make it simplify it for you."
"1229780","1231420"," You kind of want like this."
"1231600","1233360"," If this was inflation here, right?"
"1233460","1234580"," We're coming down to inflation, right?"
"1235520","1237060"," You don't want the velocity inflation. "
"1237400","1241740"," You don't want inflation like slam down into two percent and then slam back up like that."
"1241980","1242120"," Okay."
"1242860","1244820"," So the Fed's like right here, right?"
"1245620","1250080"," And the longer that they fucking make this thing go like this, the better off they are. "
"1250740","1252080"," And the better off you are as a bull."
"1253760","1254420"," Does it make sense?"
"1255800","1260060"," So you want like hot week, I mean, hot, cold, hot, cold, hot, cold, but best I can do it."
"1260180","1261380"," Even if it's a slow sweep down here. "
"1262380","1262800"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1263000","1264140"," You don't want this velocity."
"1264280","1265800"," You want this velocity to the upside either."
"1266980","1272440"," And we're going to talk about the manipulation and all that shit in economic data that's likely to"
"1272440","1273940"," take place for a period of time. "
"1273940","1276740"," And it could last even years, believe it or not."
"1276980","1280240"," There's a real manipulation that's happening right now in economic data."
"1282140","1287760"," And you could actually see it in Q4 of 2023, it began. "
"1288820","1294020"," And it's likely to continue until they want to show you those numbers."
"1294440","1298380"," And as a matter of fact, I made a post this morning from stockcharts.com."
"1299080","1301540"," You should watch that fucking video from start to finish."
"1301540","1304460"," You got three professionals, not dumb money. "
"1305440","1311020"," Three professionals with three separate outlooks on 2020 for right."
"1311500","1316480"," And there's some real cool stuff in that that that discussion because they all had their three"
"1316480","1318840"," thesis is, but they're all able to listen to each other."
"1319260","1324220"," And they all you could kind of tell as the conversation goes on and on that they're that they are. "
"1327380","1333180"," Coming around of the notion that there's real true manipulation going on right now."
"1333680","1337220"," So do yourself a solid if it's not in market hours, watch that video."
"1338520","1342660"," Does that video, you've got one of those people as a professional and she said what?"
"1343120","1345960"," I think it was her, I don't know if it's a female or the male, but one of them said"
"1345960","1352120"," at some point, Hey, look, I know the person that was tasked with fudging the numbers on economic"
"1352120","1356800"," news, whenever it was called for, you know, they didn't have to fudge the news and COVID. "
"1357400","1359260"," They've put point blank told you what they were doing."
"1359880","1365280"," Right now, though, we're getting into this time period where they are going to manipulate more and"
"1365280","1369680"," more and more and more as we get closer to that actual rate cut."
"1369860","1371500"," And you're going to see that inflation. "
"1371800","1375540"," We got a presidential election ahead of us and it has to do with that as well."
"1376420","1378440"," So we'll get into that later this morning at some point."
"1378500","1379700"," We're going to talk Tesla right now. "
"1379960","1381480"," Well, first, let's do the levels here."
"1381480","1383640"," And we'll do today's levels."
"1384780","1388220"," Let me post this live stream on Twitter and blab it over here. "
"1388800","1389560"," And I shouldn't be."
"1391140","1392140"," You want a quick second?"
"1392340","1393140"," I'm going to post this on."
"1394760","1395600"," Fin to it. "
"1397400","1403940"," And the reason I'm talking about this, this later conversation too is because oftentimes on social"
"1403940","1410420"," media, like Twitter specifically, people will see me post stuff."
"1410420","1412680"," And they don't have the full context of my posts."
"1413280","1414920"," They're not watching the live stream. "
"1415260","1416120"," They're not in a discord."
"1416460","1417460"," They're not getting a newsletter."
"1417880","1418380"," They're not getting it. "
"1418660","1421100"," Like, you need the whole entire goddamn thing and then you get it all."
"1421260","1422060"," You're like, I get all that."
"1422140","1422680"," I know what he's saying. "
"1424160","1428360"," So sometimes my posts on Fin to it can seem like they're one thing or I'm talking out of the"
"1428360","1432700"," side of my mouth or I'm shit posting when I'm not at all in any way, shape"
"1436060","1443520"," or form."
"1443520","1447900"," And what's fascinating about it is there's a large, there's a large, there's a large group of"
"1447900","1448820"," investors and trainers."
"1449260","1449740"," Bull's bears. "
"1449980","1450560"," I don't care a lot."
"1450700","1456180"," There's a large percentage out there that specifically it's about a CPI, right?"
"1456820","1462060"," If CPI starts to, or if inflation starts to spike down really fast and aggressively spikes up"
"1462060","1466660"," really fast and aggressively, let's say you see in the stock market in the inter day, like some,"
"1466860","1468500"," we're moving up higher and higher and higher."
"1468500","1470400"," Then you start seeing the market squeeze, iron, iron, iron. "
"1470800","1472900"," Everyone's like, fuck yeah, whoo, bullish."
"1473620","1474860"," The truth is not bullish."
"1475920","1476900"," It's very bearish. "
"1477940","1481100"," And so I wouldn't even be trying to trade that I'd be sitting there looking to grab something to"
"1481100","1482640"," fucking sell the fuck out of this market."
"1482840","1484160"," You know, the same in the inverse here too."
"1484360","1490120"," So this hot CPR report is bearish in the short term, but very bullish in the long term. "
"1491100","1494340"," And matter of fact, I think it's past week I was talking to you got people asking me in the"
"1494340","1494600"," stream."
"1495200","1497900"," What about those seven cuts expected this year?"
"1497900","1499060"," And what did I tell you guys?"
"1499640","1502400"," I said, that's pure fucking gambling."
"1502940","1503620"," It's not real. "
"1503840","1504160"," It's fake."
"1505100","1511600"," You know, you have mortgage companies that'll drop rates right on these expected cuts when they're"
"1511600","1513060"," right mortgages and stuff."
"1513280","1513680"," That's real. "
"1514220","1519780"," Somebody out there's getting a lower rate in their mortgage, but the betting on the real cuts is"
"1519780","1520900"," fucking pure gambling."
"1521420","1522320"," It's pure speculation."
"1522320","1526600"," And then you hear, I heard, well, I heard the bond market's always right, right?"
"1526860","1529260"," The bond market is smarter than the cash market. "
"1529760","1532140"," But the fucking bond market right now is begging."
"1532860","1533580"," They're own."
"1533840","1536920"," They're begging right now for those rate cuts. "
"1537200","1538520"," They need those rate cuts."
"1538680","1543080"," You're going to hear the bond guys tell you and bet on rate cuts this year."
"1543440","1544640"," They fucking need it. "
"1545380","1550120"," Of course, they're going to price in and bet that we're going to get rate cuts that they fucking"
"1550120","1550640"," need it."
"1551160","1552120"," They're going to get paid."
"1556220","1556660"," Okay. "
"1558060","1559180"," So hold on a second here."
"1560100","1561980"," Let's do some, let's do some levels here."
"1562080","1562880"," We post this stuff here. "
"1564980","1569500"," And we just get the stream out there on the inter what, inter tubes."
"1569640","1572740"," Bitcoin erases gains off to climbing to a two year high."
"1573360","1573640"," All right. "
"1573720","1574380"," So we're going to post that."
"1575060","1576940"," We're going to do levels right now."
"1578140","1579980"," And then we're going to talk Tesla first. "
"1587900","1588920"," And hold on."
"1589100","1589320"," Sorry."
"1589420","1592980"," I have some had some issues getting up this morning too. "
"1593080","1594240"," As they get set up here."
"1594680","1595820"," As they get set up here."
"1596520","1599640"," So I lost my internet yesterday. "
"1600980","1602720"," And we'll address that really quick."
"1603140","1604300"," So, uh, hold on a second here."
"1612380","1613080"," That's the pivot. "
"1620210","1621790"," So I never was in power, right?"
"1622090","1624730"," Or my internet plus power back at the jetty back on."
"1624890","1625270"," That was fine."
"1625410","1628490"," But what happened was my, um, ATT fiber, right?"
"1628810","1631990"," My only offer you a nine six. "
"1634410","1636150"," They only offer you."
"1637430","1639210"," Uh, modem router."
"1640050","1642210"," Can't get just the modem from ATT. "
"1644630","1646450"," So somehow my."
"1647630","1648330"," Modem router."
"1649030","1650250"," Let me just check this there. "
"1650390","1650590"," Whoop."
"1651010","1652390"," There it is right there, baby."
"1657930","1659270"," Yeah, we can go down some more. "
"1660830","1661570"," Um, so."
"1664710","1666890"," When I, so I turn all the ship back on, right?"
"1667310","1674210"," My fucking router modem thing from my ATT is like, um, so my, my real router is set up like"
"1674210","1676650"," a DHCCHP or something like that."
"1677290","1681730"," And, uh, for a pass through of the modem router. "
"1682810","1686230"," Uh, so basically it's not double net, right?"
"1686570","1689330"," So I'm not, and then I'm not broadcasting fucking wireless twice."
"1689510","1691230"," It was broadcasting wireless twice."
"1691590","1693490"," So I had to go back in the late night. "
"1693670","1695610"," So I turned on the internet last yesterday or something."
"1695950","1696590"," Like everything is great."
"1697170","1699490"," Wi-Fi was fine, but all the hardwired was not. "
"1699950","1701270"," So like go back last night."
"1701350","1702630"," I'm all panicking and freaking out."
"1703050","1704310"," Oh my gosh. "
"1704310","1704750"," Shit."
"1704950","1708730"," So I had to go back in last night and do a pass through, uh, change all the stuff on"
"1708730","1713870"," the, on that pass through and see, then go back to my, my asus router and make a bunch of"
"1713870","1714490"," changes there."
"1714610","1716030"," Cause it's a whole new setup. "
"1716890","1718950"," And that's like parental controls."
"1719430","1726030"," And then I've got like, um, every device is a throttled or not throttled or given, given like other"
"1726030","1730250"," speeds, like a higher speeds, like the stream, this setup right here."
"1730250","1738050"," As the highest, um, uh, dedicated bandwidth in, in, uh, in this, uh, on this network, right?"
"1738750","1740010"," It's like all that shit had to do. "
"1741650","1748190"," And I'm a pissed off too because my router was like, I don't know, like 500 bucks a few years"
"1748190","1748490"," ago."
"1749150","1754430"," And now it's like 150 bucks or maybe, maybe, maybe 180 right now, but it's not a gigabit router."
"1754670","1756110"," So I'm getting all poured out last night. "
"1756150","1758650"," I'm like, ah, dude, I gotta get a gigabit router."
"1759290","1763730"," So I can get actual true one gig pass throughs in my, in my network."
"1764030","1765730"," So now I'm looking at routers last night. "
"1765790","1767530"," I'm like five, 600 bucks again."
"1768330","1769590"," You know, I'm like, really?"
"1772130","1780490"," I was, I think I was getting six or 700, uh, download on this, uh, desktop last night, but I"
"1780490","1781070"," wanted a gig."
"1783590","1785710"," So now I'm like thinking about spending more money. "
"1790870","1791730"," I got sick."
"1791890","1792990"," I got the, uh, I got the six."
"1793210","1793870"," I got Wi-Fi six. "
"1794070","1794930"," This, this router is real."
"1795050","1797730"," This was, I think the six first came out."
"1798090","1800410"," Uh, I got like the top of the line when it first came out. "
"1800490","1801490"," It was like when six first came out."
"1801550","1802030"," I got all that shit."
"1802190","1806310"," The only thing I'm missing right now is the gig, the gigabit router. "
"1806610","1807870"," That's the only fucking thing I'm missing."
"1808050","1810070"," I got all the fucking sexy wire and I get everything."
"1813910","1814930"," Oh, no shit, huh?"
"1814930","1817110"," Oh, well, well, so I do that on my own. "
"1817370","1822450"," So, uh, you know that you can manipulate your, uh, bands, right, to capture more."
"1822610","1823510"," Do you guys know about that stuff?"
"1823770","1825590"," Like you can widen your bands."
"1826170","1827970"," In my router, I can widen my bands. "
"1828670","1833910"," Now, of course that fucks with like the, um, rate, the weather radar bands on the lower, uh,"
"1834610","1835470"," frequencies and stuff."
"1835810","1840150"," But yeah, if you don't live in like an apartment building or if your houses aren't too close"
"1840150","1845010"," together, you can fucking kick ass on your, uh, if you got a cool router, you can."
"1847970","1850030"," But you try to widen your bands every night, Bork. "
"1851090","1854970"," I, I sound like a, I sound like a college bro, bro, don't I, fist bumper."
"1860150","1861130"," Pull on a second there."
"1861290","1861730"," All right, all right. "
"1862210","1862750"," We gotta do the levels."
"1862870","1863670"," We gotta do the levels here."
"1863810","1864030"," Hold on. "
"1864610","1874900"," Uh, 47, 444, 74, 47 right"
"1874900","1875660"," there."
"1875660","1876320"," Right around there."
"1876620","1877100"," Close enough. "
"1877300","1878200"," Close enough for me."
"1880300","1882620"," That's the four 72."
"1884300","1885220"," Then some change. "
"1892060","1893440"," There's the rest two right there."
"1893600","1894520"," Nice and tight, right?"
"1897210","1899190"," And then, uh, four 70, 89."
"1905700","1906300"," That's 81. "
"1906640","1907860"," We can bring it up, I guess a little bit."
"1908380","1909080"," There we go."
"1909220","1909320"," Right. "
"1909520","1910260"," One more right there."
"1910480","1910720"," Close enough."
"1911040","1912420"," Close enough for horse shoes and hand grenades. "
"1913560","1915420"," Where do you think your STX or your RT?"
"1915420","1915740"," All right."
"1915860","1916020"," I did it."
"1916260","1917420"," I did it again. "
"1917720","1918860"," I need David AMS here."
"1919080","1922560"," I should probably get, you know, David AMS is on vacation in the Caribbean."
"1923180","1923920"," I got a bucket. "
"1924120","1924960"," I want to send him a call."
"1925040","1927320"," I'm going to call on signal and see if he picks up."
"1927760","1929260"," We'll see if we can do some kind of a."
"1929640","1931340"," We'll get David in here today or tomorrow. "
"1931800","1934100"," If I have the time, we'll get David on because I've been meaning to a."
"1935780","1936520"," Yeah, here we go."
"1936960","1938080"," There's S3 right there."
"1938960","1940620"," A couple of things of note here. "
"1940660","1941720"," If you are a seller."
"1943220","1945100"," So I took the money and ran."
"1945480","1947260"," I had a note right now. "
"1947680","1948160"," Nope."
"1948260","1948880"," Right there."
"1948980","1949600"," That one right there. "
"1949780","1950380"," I sold some."
"1950540","1952720"," I had some puts I owned right here."
"1953500","1954360"," Got out. "
"1954640","1956820"," I should have taken some more right there, but didn't."
"1957160","1959120"," I was trying to get the fucking stream up."
"1960240","1961220"," Couple notes here. "
"1961580","1962580"," Just so you know, okay."
"1965560","1967020"," See that white line right there?"
"1967120","1967980"," How vertical it is?"
"1968600","1969980"," That's pretty fucking bearish."
"1969980","1973700"," When that white line starts flattening out, we start to turn a corner to go to the upside. "
"1973940","1976060"," So right now still still super bearish."
"1977100","1977720"," Five minutes."
"1977800","1978220"," Same thing. "
"1979180","1979580"," Okay."
"1980280","1981820"," So come in here and check the one minute."
"1982320","1983180"," Check the one minute. "
"1983920","1984580"," Come back."
"1984580","1985140"," Check the one minute."
"1985240","1985380"," You guys. "
"1985520","1987200"," Same thing on the flip side and the upside for bulls."
"1988820","1990520"," We should keep selling that one minute."
"1991020","1996600"," Now if we do a double back check to the five minute and holds, we will continue down as well. "
"1996600","1999920"," So if you're a bear, you can like, you know, take a, take an order right there."
"2000640","2002320"," DCA right there stops above."
"2002760","2007800"," You already know that if price breaks above, you get the hourly trigger on your side and the half"
"2007800","2009060"," hour trigger on your side up here. "
"2009780","2014180"," And even if we squeeze up here, it wouldn't be, it wouldn't be taking the short off unless you're"
"2014180","2015520"," like the pullback down here."
"2015580","2016040"," That kind of stuff."
"2016200","2018880"," So on the internet, still kind of bearish right here. "
"2019240","2026400"," Red S2 right now target to the downside for me at least is going to be at least somewhere around"
"2026400","2031120"," this S3 possibly even 469 67 something like that."
"2032100","2039140"," Let's also look at really quick for getting the Tesla 30 minute chart."
"2039320","2039460"," Okay. "
"2039780","2041560"," Let's take a look at spoons really quick."
"2042080","2043700"," Right there."
"2044200","2045760"," I think this is a B wave. "
"2046300","2047199"," That could be wrong in that."
"2047620","2051460"," But don't, don't, don't, don't quote me as an Elliott wave expert and stuff like that."
"2051460","2053540"," But this was a B wave. "
"2053699","2057080"," I think one, two, and three, right?"
"2057400","2059080"," One, two, and three."
"2059360","2061260"," And that's your real move to the upside right there."
"2061400","2062219"," Now saying that. "
"2064020","2066600"," And that's, and that's saying that because you have this nice roll."
"2066780","2068739"," There's probably a bunch of Elliott waivers out there like fuck."
"2068900","2069020"," Yeah. "
"2069159","2070920"," Maybe we'll come right back down and go down here."
"2072260","2074219"," There's some stuff to talk about here."
"2074540","2074900"," Okay. "
"2075260","2077659"," Now there's a warning."
"2077880","2079080"," I got a warning for you here."
"2079080","2079380"," Okay. "
"2080300","2081520"," There is a."
"2083719","2084659"," Where is it at?"
"2086520","2088060"," 4730 they say or something like that."
"2088320","2088760"," 4740."
"2089320","2091320"," So we're right on the game of flip right now. "
"2091820","2096160"," If you were in the game of flip right now, but this thing has been, this box has been."
"2097260","2098800"," Call this box right here."
"2100740","2102860"," Pretend this is CTA is okay. "
"2103380","2104340"," They were down here."
"2104500","2105280"," Then they were down here."
"2105440","2106080"," Then they were down here. "
"2106080","2107540"," Now they're right here."
"2107740","2112440"," They're actually currently right here where they will become net sellers of the market."
"2112440","2112920"," Okay. "
"2113980","2115780"," So we don't want to see that happen."
"2116540","2117980"," We don't want to see price."
"2119000","2120360"," Start this journey. "
"2121540","2122280"," Down here."
"2122280","2122680"," Okay."
"2123240","2125520"," This can lead to a pretty significant downside move. "
"2125520","2127800"," So we're going to be interested in this holding here."
"2128020","2130800"," I don't mind this right here to make that move higher."
"2131300","2132620"," Like I like that still for the bulls. "
"2132620","2135000"," But if we start to confirm this role here."
"2135000","2138220"," I would expect some major downside moves, not."
"2140020","2142140"," Not for 6743. "
"2143060","2145060"," The mechanics here were like this."
"2145840","2151400"," The CTA's were down here earlier in time, like back here in time they were."
"2151920","2156100"," So if we had come up here and rolled down, I was pretty confident we're going to roll up here. "
"2156340","2158880"," Start a nice fucking huge move to the upside."
"2159620","2163240"," Now as time has passed, the CTA's have gotten higher and higher and higher and higher."
"2163240","2168500"," So there's a chance of greater risk here of this not holding. "
"2168880","2175160"," If it doesn't, if we roll down here and reject right here, like a major rejection right here, I"
"2175160","2176660"," don't see this as being bottom."
"2177260","2183400"," I would see be looking for a target of a corrective target down here."
"2184140","2186360"," Okay, which is actually down there. "
"2187520","2187820"," Right there."
"2189120","2189980"," Roughly 450."
"2191160","2191620"," Right there. "
"2193500","2197520"," If this begins to, if this begins, hold on a second here."
"2199940","2202340"," If this begins to break right here."
"2203300","2208860"," And if you see this, so if you see like the break and you see the rejection, I'm not going"
"2208860","2210240"," to expect that bounce there. "
"2210360","2213900"," I'm going to expect this to go all the way down and have a V shape recovery down here at"
"2213900","2215580"," some point at 450."
"2216120","2218660"," So if you are a bear, you are looking for a break."
"2219020","2220560"," I'm going to show you that break right now. "
"2220740","2220840"," Okay."
"2221500","2223720"," And we're going to put this back on a one minute chart here."
"2223800","2224600"," Just be aware of that. "
"2224680","2225340"," Okay, if you're a bear."
"2228100","2230380"," Now we can break this, we can break this here."
"2231200","2233280"," We can break this here. "
"2234120","2236600"," But if we V shape recovery come back up, we're good to go."
"2237220","2238340"," Everything is awesome sauce."
"2238400","2238760"," Okay. "
"2239760","2241260"," You need the, if you're a bear, you need."
"2242720","2244840"," If you're a bear, you don't want to see that."
"2245080","2247020"," If you're a bear, you want to see the break. "
"2247020","2247100"," Right."
"2248400","2250240"," And then you want to see the rejection, right?"
"2250860","2255900"," You want to see that action right there, either right here or up here for that move to the"
"2255900","2256120"," downside."
"2256580","2258260"," So we'll, we'll monitor it, see what happens. "
"2258920","2260240"," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"2260800","2265360"," Now that correction is not the doom and gloom that."
"2266140","2267980"," Now, I'm refact from the Twitter this morning. "
"2268340","2275380"," It's that that glue, doom and gloom is not that corrective behavior is not the inflation bounce."
"2275380","2278420"," The, the cutting rates that they're looking for."
"2278580","2285640"," These, there are sellers and bears out there that want to see inflation slam down on 2% slam up. "
"2285820","2289540"," They want to see a ramp of velocity ramp on unemployment."
"2290300","2291840"," And they want to see rate cut starts."
"2292240","2295960"," And then they want to get, that's to get that 30% down move that they're looking for. "
"2296520","2299740"," So outside of corrective behavior, stuff like that, situation is normal."
"2300480","2302800"," Now be aware of this chart right here."
"2302800","2306080"," I'm going to bring this back up in a smaller window later, but I want to pay attention to this"
"2306080","2306540"," chart right here. "
"2306840","2307780"," Here's the gamma flip."
"2308120","2308400"," Okay."
"2309620","2310840"," It's not good enough. "
"2311540","2316520"," Slanting below it and then coming back up right and holding this shit and then heading high right"
"2316520","2317720"," there's your V shape recovery."
"2318140","2324060"," If you're a bear, you want to see blood underneath the gamma flip and then rejection of the gamma"
"2324060","2324440"," flip."
"2325040","2328380"," Come down and beat this prior low right here. "
"2328580","2330000"," If you see this action right here."
"2331120","2332260"," They're fucking selling."
"2332880","2333340"," Okay. "
"2333420","2335580"," And I mean in a big way institutional selling."
"2335580","2337820"," This is what institutional selling will look like."
"2338160","2343860"," This is not institutional selling at this point, but this would be an indicator of institutional"
"2343860","2345180"," selling down here. "
"2345340","2346460"," This is SPX by the way."
"2347040","2350200"," You can snap that or take a picture or whatever if you want on this stuff."
"2350920","2352260"," We're sitting in the gamma flip right now. "
"2352480","2354300"," This is where a bull would buy the dip."
"2354980","2355440"," Right."
"2356260","2358540"," So if this is where a bull would buy the dip. "
"2359880","2361220"," I'm looking for what?"
"2361220","2362640"," This right here."
"2363400","2364480"," To make an entry."
"2365120","2365600"," Okay. "
"2365800","2367140"," So watch this right here."
"2367500","2368940"," To this price action right here."
"2369620","2371100"," So I'm going to be looking for. "
"2373780","2376200"," As a bull to buy a dip."
"2376200","2378400"," I know about the pit above at 4800."
"2378780","2380520"," I hope I might not get it. "
"2380560","2382040"," I might get a reversal before that happens."
"2382380","2383680"," If that happens to be like this."
"2384420","2386960"," You'd see that come down that come down that flip up. "
"2386960","2389640"," I'll be a buyer right there if it turns right now."
"2390320","2394520"," But otherwise I'm looking for some kind of like blood bath here and a V shape at some point."
"2395340","2399920"," In that early trigger to come down and I'll enter the market long again and target 4800. "
"2400140","2400240"," Okay."
"2401200","2402840"," So right now speak cool relax."
"2403200","2403640"," Chill out. "
"2403900","2405720"," If you're a bull just chill out relax hang out."
"2406360","2409280"," If you're a seller or a bear and you think there's more down to come."
"2409440","2410860"," I'm with you on that right now. "
"2410860","2413040"," So there's more downside to come."
"2413240","2415680"," Now saying all that right going through all that stuff right there."
"2417760","2420960"," That was questions this morning are the questions this morning. "
"2421160","2422020"," At least from my perspective."
"2424580","2426520"," I'm hoping for a hot CPI this morning."
"2426680","2427260"," I'm hoping for it. "
"2427360","2428300"," I want a hot CPI."
"2429200","2431100"," And then I want like a cool CPI."
"2431600","2433920"," I want I want to go like this sideways. "
"2434820","2436280"," Well it's like chill the fuck out."
"2436780","2438120"," I don't want any velocity of the downside."
"2439360","2442870"," I actually don't mind a velocity of the upside inflation as long as they don't get 2%. "
"2443950","2445970"," And I really liked hearing this more."
"2446110","2447450"," I loved watching this morning."
"2447790","2448710"," CNBC is like. "
"2448990","2450190"," CNBC bond guy."
"2450290","2453430"," All kinds of people out there going fuck or we're not getting a fucking rate cut."
"2453750","2455330"," And you got some people out there going. "
"2456090","2458810"," You got some people out there going yeah for the wrong and right reasons."
"2458830","2462550"," And some people going no for the wrong and right reasons."
"2462970","2464490"," So within the crowd that says yeah. "
"2465670","2467030"," You're like looking for."
"2467630","2469950"," I'm looking for who's saying yeah right now."
"2470390","2470550"," Right. "
"2470890","2472190"," Who's saying now right now."
"2472190","2474050"," And I'll tell you something."
"2475650","2477270"," If you if you're a bear right. "
"2478310","2480830"," And you want to find out who the smart bears are."
"2481070","2482930"," Those are the guys that were pissed off."
"2483450","2486250"," That's that that inflation didn't come in cool this morning. "
"2487070","2488850"," I used to be a bear if I was a bear."
"2489030","2490470"," I wanted cool inflation today."
"2490790","2493070"," 100% because I know. "
"2493670","2494470"," Great cuts are coming."
"2494470","2498110"," And I know I can take a giant fucking short position in this market."
"2498650","2500390"," Giant for huge move down. "
"2500390","2502410"," So think about that."
"2503170","2507450"," The reactions that you saw from different people this morning."
"2507750","2510490"," You want to pay attention to those reactions. "
"2511350","2512670"," The bulls that were like yeah."
"2513270","2513510"," Hot CPI."
"2513810","2514170"," I like it. "
"2514650","2515250"," Follow those bulls."
"2515790","2516250"," Guarantee it."
"2516490","2516870"," Follow those bulls. "
"2517090","2517710"," Guys are making money."
"2518210","2519010"," Hand over fucking fist."
"2519930","2521410"," If you're following bears out there. "
"2522010","2524170"," The bears that really want bears that know."
"2524670","2528210"," They want cool inflation and they want a lot of it really fast."
"2528210","2530230"," And they want multiple months of it. "
"2530890","2532430"," They start seeing that cool inflation."
"2532710","2533490"," They already know it's coming."
"2534210","2534610"," Okay. "
"2535210","2535470"," All right."
"2535730","2535750"," So."
"2536490","2537290"," Past all that. "
"2537650","2538130"," Right there."
"2538210","2538630"," There's your target."
"2538830","2539690"," I'll give you a target right here. "
"2539750","2539930"," Okay."
"2540570","2541750"," I'll even draw it out for you."
"2542390","2543830"," What I want to see happen here. "
"2543950","2544130"," Okay."
"2545330","2547010"," I want to see something like that."
"2547290","2550930"," Then I want to see some big old squeeze right there for that 30 minute half hour cross. "
"2551030","2552770"," I want to see some kind of bloodbath right down there."
"2552810","2553030"," Okay."
"2554450","2555490"," And there's your V shape recovery. "
"2555630","2556510"," Something like that."
"2556510","2557950"," The upside right there."
"2558710","2559650"," Something like that. "
"2563630","2564390"," There you go."
"2564550","2565090"," Maybe that helps."
"2565090","2565410"," Okay. "
"2565550","2565610"," Boom."
"2565850","2566590"," Right down there."
"2566730","2567570"," Get the cross coming up. "
"2567990","2568850"," If you are a bull."
"2568970","2569630"," If you are a bear."
"2570810","2571970"," Or a bull doesn't matter. "
"2572230","2572610"," Doesn't matter."
"2572670","2572910"," It doesn't matter."
"2573170","2573690"," Upside it down. "
"2574070","2576190"," But whenever you start to see these crosses like this."
"2576390","2578770"," This half hour crossing this hourly."
"2579410","2582070"," We'll tend to add some fucking velocity to the downside. "
"2582530","2583750"," So we'll see how this happens."
"2584530","2586430"," Play the watch house put minutes helps you guys out."
"2586530","2586650"," I guess. "
"2586810","2587050"," I don't know."
"2587070","2587630"," Maybe it does."
"2588390","2589470"," Maybe it doesn't. "
"2591250","2592110"," That was my."
"2592510","2594970"," I think it was 470 98 or something."
"2595670","2597470"," 72 78 something like that. "
"2598390","2598730"," Whatever."
"2598870","2599350"," It's close enough."
"2605130","2607370"," Also note that this is the gamma flip. "
"2609010","2613370"," So you want to not only break the gamma flip, but you want to stand underneath it."
"2613890","2614370"," Okay."
"2614650","2618110"," If you're a bear, you want to get under the gamma flip and then reject it. "
"2620290","2621010"," Get a flip."
"2621710","2626030"," I'll make that yellow or we'll make it red for the bears."
"2627930","2628730"," Right about there. "
"2630030","2631710"," So if you're a bear, you're looking for what?"
"2632690","2633590"," Looking for that blood."
"2635190","2635590"," Right."
"2635610","2637630"," Then you're looking for the rejection right down there. "
"2637710","2639050"," That's what you're looking for right there."
"2639270","2640090"," Something like that."
"2642690","2644290"," But right now we're at the gamma flip. "
"2644790","2646650"," This is still a dip by the dip scenario."
"2648070","2652310"," We want to, as a seller, you want to flip this to a seller rip scenario."
"2652990","2658130"," So right now we're still, right now we're still technically at a by the dip on the gamma flip"
"2658130","2658550"," scenario. "
"2660430","2661110"," Makes sense?"
"2661670","2667490"," And normally if we flip this, we'll turn to sellers and we'll start selling this market in."
"2668850","2670390"," In with some power."
"2671030","2671290"," Okay. "
"2671810","2672610"," So we're done with all that stuff."
"2674290","2674910"," More than everybody."
"2675010","2675790"," How y'all doing out there?"
"2676450","2678030"," We're going to talk Tesla right now. "
"2678210","2678350"," Okay."
"2678550","2680190"," It's a good time talking about Tesla, right?"
"2680650","2681330"," They're on the bottom."
"2682310","2683230"," We're going to talk Tesla. "
"2683650","2687370"," Now I'm going to make some statements to you that might piss you off."
"2688090","2688970"," You can actually search."
"2689190","2691970"," So I'm not going to, I was going to prep for this, but I'm not going to because I've already"
"2691970","2692450"," done this. "
"2692790","2693930"," I've already shown this before."
"2694570","2695970"," Then all the hard work and all that stuff."
"2696110","2697110"," You can find it on your own. "
"2698410","2699130"," Now Tesla."
"2700570","2702110"," You know, you hear things like."
"2703210","2704250"," Now you hear things. "
"2704610","2707030"," You don't hear things."
"2707310","2708890"," I mean, where's my camera up here?"
"2709030","2710250"," I show my pretty face, right?"
"2711090","2712910"," You know, you hear stuff from."
"2713810","2718010"," You'll hear things like Tesla's no longer the most shorted stock in the world. "
"2720270","2722510"," One of the things about Tesla that really sucks."
"2723450","2725030"," I got a light back there."
"2725450","2729070"," Blue light got kicked off a count or a desk back. "
"2731830","2741690"," What sucks about Tesla is a lot of hedge funds will go into small ETFs with a"
"2741690","2742910"," low volume, right?"
"2743810","2749150"," And they will short these smaller ETFs."
"2749930","2758050"," It's easier to short these smaller ETFs that have Tesla as a major component, a major holding of"
"2758050","2758770"," that ETF."
"2759450","2766230"," It's an easier way for them to get an amplified impact and make the price of Tesla go down in"
"2766230","2767270"," a meaningful way. "
"2768070","2769850"," So I want to be, you'll be aware of that, okay?"
"2770510","2771450"," It's an important thing."
"2772030","2773310"," There are a lot of hedge funds."
"2773970","2776150"," There's a great, I don't have it in front of me. "
"2776190","2781470"," This is what I mean by this is that I used to post a video from from, I think it"
"2781470","2786890"," was a C-SPAN discussion at a university, one of the big universities, Yale or Princeton or"
"2786890","2792230"," something where they were discussing this going on quietly behind the scenes."
"2793050","2796730"," So even though you might see this is not the most shorted stock or maybe sometimes it is or isn't,"
"2796730","2798550"," I want you to know if there's active shorting of Tesla."
"2799190","2803770"," And last year, of course, you know that shorts lost a ton of money last year shorting Tesla, but"
"2803770","2810850"," they are actively shorting it, not directly on Tesla or through or like inside of the big indexes. "
"2811510","2818630"," They're doing it where they can actually manipulate the price of Tesla, where it doesn't track the"
"2818630","2819810"," rest of the market at times."
"2820650","2823790"," The other issue with Tesla is it's a major holding in small caps."
"2825370","2832950"," Now small caps, you saw it getting front run on the anticipation of rate cuts coming, right?"
"2833170","2839290"," You've got the bond market saying we're getting seven rate cuts in the 2024 and you see the ramp"
"2839290","2844930"," going on for outside and outside moving IWM, right?"
"2845810","2848270"," On anticipated rate cuts in 2024. "
"2849270","2858570"," As long as those anticipated rate cuts are still valid, you would still see IWM crank until"
"2858570","2861070"," those rate cuts begin."
"2862110","2867030"," So if they have anticipated seven rate cuts sometime in spring, you're going to expect an"
"2867030","2868690"," outperformance by IWM."
"2868690","2869850"," And guess what I do?"
"2869950","2871110"," It holds a lot of Tesla. "
"2872890","2877310"," So you've got this like double amplification of downside moves in Tesla going on."
"2878030","2880470"," Tesla's not participating with the rest of the market."
"2881510","2883570"," Now it's not your news that you're listening to. "
"2883670","2884970"," It's not the shit that you're consuming."
"2885170","2886850"," It's not the diarrhea that you're eating."
"2887330","2888030"," It's not anything you're hearing. "
"2888410","2890630"," Now you might see some news come out with this though."
"2891030","2891470"," Bad news."
"2893010","2896410"," And bad news is timed by companies like Tesla. "
"2896410","2902430"," Every company out there kind of knows when that downside moves coming and they will choose to"
"2902430","2906630"," divulge bad news in those periods as well, right?"
"2906810","2908330"," This is not rocket science stuff."
"2909650","2914770"," So if you have a down move in any company and you've got some dirty laundry, you're going to empty"
"2914770","2917270"," that dirty laundry when you're in a down fucking move."
"2917970","2920470"," Does that make sense to you, right?"
"2920970","2922270"," I'm a company and I'm publicly traded. "
"2922950","2925710"," I'm going to wait for the right time to disclose certain news."
"2925710","2926550"," Make sense?"
"2927330","2928330"," I'm going to wait for it."
"2928570","2930010"," My stock is screaming higher. "
"2930850","2931790"," What am I going to do?"
"2933030","2937730"," As it's going to the moon, I'm going to come out with some kick ass news, get that last little"
"2937730","2939210"," bit out of that stock, right?"
"2940970","2942310"," Just be aware of that."
"2943450","2945530"," So I was going to post that this morning."
"2945730","2951550"," Like expect some real nasty news or there might be some nasty news coming out from Tesla. "
"2952050","2955290"," If this happens, we're going to talk about what could possibly happen with Tesla."
"2956210","2961570"," And if it does happen with Tesla, you're likely going to see Elon here, some dirty laundry."
"2962350","2962870"," I would. "
"2964090","2965070"," I fucking would."
"2965350","2968970"," If I was Elon, I'd be like, fuck yeah, if we're going to get down there, what do we got"
"2968970","2969630"," for bad news?"
"2971330","2972210"," Does that make sense to you?"
"2975380","2977820"," You show me the price and I'll tell you what the news is."
"2978200","2978680"," Does that make sense?"
"2980500","2981000"," That's right. "
"2982240","2983840"," Okay, so we're going to talk Tesla here."
"2985240","2992320"," And I was making some statements here earlier about matter of fact, I charted this for you on live"
"2992320","2994940"," stream on live stream."
"2995780","2997220"," I charted that for you. "
"2997380","2997840"," Where are we?"
"2999260","3001660"," Even reviewed it again on Tuesday, I think."
"3003500","3004680"," And where are we?"
"3005380","3006820"," Where I said we'd be, right?"
"3007900","3009000"," Told you we'd be right."
"3009380","3010460"," We're there right now, aren't we?"
"3012380","3013160"," So there you go. "
"3013720","3015540"," That's what charted it for you."
"3016700","3017400"," Revisited it."
"3017900","3019000"," And where are we today?"
"3020180","3020620"," Right?"
"3021280","3022080"," It's right there, right?"
"3022880","3024260"," I didn't fucking make this today. "
"3024880","3026220"," Go back and watch live streams."
"3027400","3029740"," Go back and watch every fucking one of those live streams."
"3030080","3030580"," Go back and use. "
"3030800","3033040"," Some of you guys are here every day know about these live streams."
"3033180","3033760"," You're here every day, right?"
"3034440","3035260"," You can vouch for this."
"3035460","3036220"," It's on fucking tape. "
"3038500","3040220"," So Tesla's down today, right?"
"3042180","3042560"," Now."
"3044820","3046960"," There's some stuff I got to go over with you here."
"3047100","3047280"," Okay. "
"3047480","3048520"," This is an important Tesla."
"3048880","3049860"," We're going to do Tesla talk."
"3050040","3050460"," We're going to vote. "
"3050720","3051040"," My time."
"3051240","3051860"," Tesla today."
"3052380","3053180"," Because I know I've been being. "
"3053320","3054860"," I mean, people have been asking me about it."
"3054960","3055700"," Ask me about it."
"3055860","3056600"," Ask me about it. "
"3057040","3060180"," We got people coming in the stream saying people that I trust."
"3060760","3061460"," Coming in the stream."
"3062040","3064080"," Last time we talked Tesla this earlier this past week. "
"3064100","3064620"," I think it was Monday."
"3065340","3066400"," They said, Hey, cap."
"3067680","3070200"," My friends are fucking getting really concerned about it. "
"3072160","3073460"," You got any good news?"
"3073660","3074040"," I'm like, fuck."
"3074180","3074660"," No, I don't."
"3074800","3076000"," I got no good news for you. "
"3076760","3079580"," Now there is a lead at the end of the tunnel on this."
"3080420","3080780"," Okay."
"3081060","3083560"," There's a couple of things here you got to watch here. "
"3083620","3083820"," Okay."
"3084280","3084760"," Number one."
"3087140","3089520"," If there is a cross, you guys get pencils out. "
"3090180","3090500"," Snap."
"3090780","3091220"," Or how about this?"
"3091420","3091860"," We'll start here."
"3095330","3098250"," When they're in snap picture that matter if I'm just getting rid of my camera over here. "
"3098890","3099350"," I'm going to move."
"3099530","3100430"," I ain't getting rid of my camera."
"3102650","3103390"," Hold on here. "
"3104970","3106030"," How do you fucking mines?"
"3108310","3110750"," I'm leaving my pretty at my ugly ass up."
"3112050","3113250"," Put me down there."
"3113410","3113810"," How about that?"
"3115130","3116310"," Oh, my webcam frame. "
"3116430","3117150"," Well, that's even sex."
"3117310","3118010"," It's all fucked up."
"3118110","3118650"," They'll look at it. "
"3119750","3121330"," You guys can't repose this anywhere."
"3121650","3122710"," You'll be like, this guy is swearing."
"3123450","3124330"," I'm telling him. "
"3124370","3124790"," He was pretty."
"3127330","3128230"," Look at it."
"3128310","3128790"," So here we go. "
"3130430","3131530"," We'll snap on this for yourselves."
"3131870","3132970"," Take a little screenshot or whatever."
"3134990","3137590"," And we're going to look at some prior history stuff here. "
"3139310","3141910"," And we're going to talk about the price of Tesla and so on."
"3142050","3142990"," What to expect here?"
"3143930","3147750"," You're getting a cross right now of the daily trigger over the weekly trigger."
"3149990","3151650"," You've got price testing the monthly trigger. "
"3152010","3156150"," The monthly trigger as long as Tesla stays above it, it's bullish."
"3156150","3157110"," Okay."
"3157690","3163570"," Price above the monthly trigger means Tesla any stock is in a bullish context. "
"3164330","3169590"," If the price of any stock goes below and rejects and begins to head lower of the monthly trigger,"
"3169950","3172630"," it is extremely bearish for that ticker."
"3173050","3174110"," That includes Tesla."
"3176910","3180070"," Another problem here is that you have the daily trigger. "
"3180710","3183450"," This yellow line crossing right now."
"3185790","3186290"," Okay."
"3186990","3192170"," And when this cross is made down here, you're likely going to see a squeeze to the upside. "
"3193110","3195430"," Not guaranteed, but a high probability of it."
"3196470","3198190"," I've actually a squeeze up here."
"3198330","3200630"," Regardless of what this low is right here, you'll see a squeeze. "
"3200950","3201050"," Okay."
"3202130","3205830"," And it'll be confirming that downside move."
"3206150","3210010"," There's another problem here too where it consolidates for a little bit. "
"3210010","3215970"," And that daily trigger comes down this monthly and it happens there."
"3216090","3218010"," It can be very, very detrimental."
"3219050","3222610"," You then come up with like a six or an eight trigger cluster that's bearish. "
"3222610","3226630"," If it confirms this downside move, it's going to be a fucking bloodbath."
"3227450","3232630"," And that bloodbath will likely coincide with some kind of news breaking about Tesla or some kind of"
"3232630","3236610"," market news that's unknown right now to us."
"3236610","3237750"," They probably already know it. "
"3237790","3238550"," We just don't know it."
"3238550","3243790"," So if this plays out right here, my point here is if this plays out, right, it's going to be"
"3243790","3244370"," fucking ugly."
"3244830","3246090"," I'm going to warn you of this right now. "
"3246450","3251670"," So if you own the underlying in Tesla, you have to start to consider at some points putting some"
"3251670","3257930"," kind of a cheap put hedge on or something or diamond or just diamond hand and know that it's going"
"3257930","3258410"," to go down."
"3259130","3261370"," I would not sell if you're already upside down."
"3261630","3262950"," I would not be a seller here. "
"3263330","3265010"," I would be in some protection mode."
"3265610","3270990"," And the reason I'm saying that is because after this, if this move happens to the downside, the"
"3270990","3275130"," move after it is going to be explosive to the upside and you'll be fine again."
"3275410","3275530"," Okay. "
"3276190","3276430"," No more."
"3276550","3277450"," You want to worry again."
"3277670","3281710"," Is that the picture you're muffs on and not listen to the general public talk tea and stuff like"
"3281710","3281930"," that. "
"3284130","3287290"," So there is a setup here, a very bear set up here."
"3287970","3294250"," Now, if at any point the deli the deli velocity gets to minus 50, let's say we're down here."
"3294250","3300050"," There's also high probability we come up here, break above the deli trigger, confirm it and just be"
"3300050","3301610"," out of here and we're off and running again. "
"3301770","3301890"," Okay."
"3302750","3305650"," So if that happens like this, I'll update you."
"3306110","3307950"," But for right now where we are. "
"3308870","3312990"," There is a bear extremely bear set up happening."
"3313370","3316750"," So I've tried all that out for you as of right now, right?"
"3317870","3320330"," We're going to take a look at what to expect down here."
"3320450","3320710"," Okay. "
"3322570","3324310"," And we're going to chart that out."
"3324510","3330190"," So for right now for where we are thesis wise, there's going to be a squeeze here at some point"
"3330190","3334470"," on a confirmation for some pretty major lows down here."
"3334570","3334750"," Okay. "
"3335570","3339970"," This one right here, you're going to check and you're also likely going to check this one right"
"3339970","3340170"," here."
"3340510","3341910"," And we'll put these down here for you."
"3345420","3346120"," Right there. "
"3347680","3348800"," Make that one yellow."
"3350600","3352260"," And we're going to talk velocity here."
"3352360","3353720"," I got more to talk to you guys about here. "
"3353860","3354000"," Okay."
"3354500","3355920"," A whole bunch of important stuff."
"3359730","3361010"," Something like that right there. "
"3361490","3363750"," And if that happens, you know what the rest of it is, right?"
"3364490","3367570"," The rest of it's going to be creating straight down to the depths of how it's going to come up"
"3367570","3367730"," here."
"3368010","3369550"," And then it's going to come right back down here."
"3370370","3373210"," And I tagged that one up here, start to consolidate likely a little bit. "
"3373770","3375950"," And then you're going to get some real vicious downside moves."
"3376850","3378290"," They're going to get nasty."
"3380330","3381450"," More than likely. "
"3382030","3383850"," I'm going to explain to you why here in a minute."
"3388070","3390370"," You can't have demand down here, right?"
"3390590","3391490"," And fail right here."
"3391630","3395890"," If you do fail right there, that means that they're going to want to check. "
"3397210","3398070"," Down here."
"3398110","3402070"," And this is going to close one of your first big gaps way back in 2020."
"3402830","3405590"," That's a price target of $77.93 right now. "
"3405590","3410070"," This is a six month Elliott wave for lack of a better word term."
"3410730","3413470"," And you'll likely see that gap get closed down here."
"3413810","3418950"," Now, if you do see that happen, you're likely going to see huge demand come in again. "
"3419610","3423690"," And you'll likely see another move to the upside, a major move to the upside actually."
"3424210","3425970"," Take out something like that up there."
"3426170","3426290"," Okay. "
"3426770","3426790"," So."
"3427630","3428530"," Sorry about that."
"3432950","3436890"," So if you are already upside down or fucked or whatever, you just hang tight. "
"3437310","3437890"," Head yourself."
"3438330","3442110"," If that on that coming back up here, DCA down here."
"3442910","3445510"," DCA down here to your happy bowl. "
"3446810","3448070"," Conversation from earlier."
"3448730","3450810"," I've done a happy bowl."
"3451070","3452690"," You're always like, yeah, it's fucking awesome up here. "
"3452790","3453890"," I love being this guy."
"3454030","3454330"," Woohoo."
"3454410","3454990"," Everything's awesome. "
"3455050","3455570"," A plus plus."
"3455830","3456170"," I got an A."
"3456730","3458490"," I'm a good student, right?"
"3459270","3461550"," So this is setting up right now for Tesla."
"3462710","3469270"," If rate cuts aren't coming, those shorts that I talked about with you in the smaller indexes, not"
"3469270","3471550"," IWM, I mean smaller, like tiny ones. "
"3472890","3478770"," IWM not outperforming on the anticipation of rate cuts, that kind of stuff."
"3478970","3483490"," You could see this, this amplification here for downside move for Tesla down here."
"3484350","3484870"," Price target. "
"3485390","3486030"," It's not $77."
"3487550","3490410"," I think it's $80 or, you know, it's $89."
"3490870","3493830"," I believe by the time we get there, it's like $89 or something like that. "
"3494050","3496090"," But if we slam through the $89, close that gap."
"3496450","3497570"," Even on the gap, I think it's 66."
"3498450","3501450"," Don't quote me in the exact numbers here because I haven't looked at it in detail. "
"3502250","3503790"," I should have prepared, but I didn't."
"3503870","3507210"," But I remember it and recall it from back when there's a gap, I believe, in 89."
"3507570","3508670"," And I think there's a gap at 66. "
"3509730","3511030"," Correct me in the chat if I'm wrong on that."
"3511450","3513410"," 64, 66, something like that."
"3513530","3517730"," I would expect that $89 gap to get closed would go up. "
"3518110","3522030"," And then I would expect another trip down to that $60 at some point."
"3522710","3526370"," Whatever that is, I don't know in time, time wise, but I would expect, I expect that we're going to"
"3526370","3532110"," close that gap and go back and close that $64 gap year down the road or whatever, two years down"
"3532110","3533050"," the road or something like that."
"3534250","3535010"," 2026, 2028. "
"3536570","3538330"," Now this can resolve itself to the upside."
"3538790","3539590"," I showed you that already."
"3539590","3541010"," But I want to talk to you guys specifically. "
"3541250","3542750"," Matter of fact, you can actually see this right here."
"3542990","3544150"," Some similar to this right here."
"3544250","3544830"," See that move down?"
"3545070","3545670"," Bloodbath, right?"
"3545910","3546050"," Whoom. "
"3546850","3547670"," Another bloodbath right there."
"3547890","3548030"," Whoom."
"3548990","3550170"," Remember, nobody bought that. "
"3550350","3550650"," Did they?"
"3551770","3552650"," They didn't buy it."
"3552690","3552950"," Did they?"
"3553510","3554370"," I know they didn't."
"3554470","3554850"," I was there. "
"3555090","3555470"," I remember it."
"3555570","3556050"," I remember it happened."
"3556730","3558010"," I was so pissed off that morning. "
"3558010","3559010"," I wanted to close the gap."
"3559030","3559910"," They left it behind."
"3560430","3565690"," They actually left the fucking gap from back in, I believe, February or March of 2020. "
"3566670","3568430"," They left that fucking gap open down."
"3568570","3569290"," There's a gap over there."
"3569410","3569810"," They left it. "
"3569950","3571410"," They literally missed it by like a dollar."
"3571830","3573410"," And I was pissed off that morning."
"3574150","3575970"," I was like, I ain't fucking buying the open here. "
"3576210","3578670"," I'm like, I want to see that gap get closed and I'm going to buy it."
"3579710","3580490"," It didn't close."
"3580810","3581370"," It started running. "
"3582230","3583170"," I got all stinky."
"3583810","3584370"," And then you know what I did?"
"3584530","3585750"," My ego was like, well, fuck them."
"3585910","3586630"," I'll wait a day or two. "
"3586950","3588930"," Then like a day or two later, I bought that bottom."
"3589990","3595070"," But I was more from my own conceit, my own id, my own."
"3596550","3598370"," You know, I want that fucking tick. "
"3599450","3601250"," It's not good enough that we're down there."
"3601710","3606470"," I want the fucking, I want the penny tick to buy from my own fucking ego trip."
"3607730","3609630"," So I lost that in a few dollars. "
"3611010","3614610"," Not many, but you know, anyways."
"3615570","3619090"," So there's, there is a major downside move here setting up."
"3619710","3621070"," Okay, as the point now. "
"3621870","3624370"," Here's an example of a great run after, right?"
"3625130","3627750"," You down here at 90 bucks or whatever."
"3627870","3629850"," I think it was 110 or something."
"3629970","3631830"," I can't remember what the low was, but it's luck. "
"3632550","3633330"," I don't know what it was."
"3635450","3636250"," Yeah, $102."
"3637290","3638410"," Great run right here, right?"
"3638690","3639010"," A hundred bucks. "
"3639690","3641550"," Got a high of $298."
"3643610","3645310"," Fall that trend all the way down."
"3645650","3645670"," Boom. "
"3646450","3647490"," Matter of fact, that was a set."
"3647630","3648510"," You guys remember this, right?"
"3648630","3649470"," I was a seller right here."
"3651030","3651930"," That's where I was inside. "
"3651930","3653470"," I bought right there and I sold right here."
"3653470","3654670"," Fucking gorgeous run."
"3655410","3655990"," Made bank. "
"3659800","3662400"," So we have an example back here, but we have something else cool."
"3662580","3663100"," Let's show you here."
"3663100","3663400"," Okay. "
"3663920","3669860"," If we get, if we get this bull run for 2024."
"3672680","3674460"," We get one last bull run."
"3675380","3676860"," We don't get rates cut. "
"3678020","3681080"," We get this like, uh, we get this, this moment here, right?"
"3681160","3688060"," You get the soft landing a window and then the next recession, which is historically guaranteed."
"3689620","3691600"," There's some cool, all sets cool here."
"3692200","3696920"," And I want to bring you back to, uh, I want to draw your attention to two things here. "
"3698040","3698960"," At least historically."
"3703240","3705660"," You see this, uh, see this, this daily, right?"
"3705780","3707140"," In fact, that daily is turning around on the upside."
"3707420","3707780"," It's good to see. "
"3708120","3709660"," You can see a nice little squeeze up here."
"3710900","3716820"," Now, if this does play out, do you see the, the, the daily trigger here, the weekly in the, in"
"3716820","3717820"," the, in the monthly, right?"
"3718440","3719640"," There's an example of it."
"3720860","3725540"," And, uh, it's right here. "
"3734990","3735870"," It's right in here."
"3735930","3736850"," This little mess right here."
"3737910","3738970"," This is 2018. "
"3741590","3743230"," And I actually remember when this happened."
"3743710","3745110"," This was a Labor Day, I believe."
"3745550","3746830"," No, it was Labor Day weekend. "
"3747650","3748830"," I think this is Labor Day weekend."
"3749270","3751910"," I think this is when Elon did the lemon squeeze thing."
"3752590","3754770"," I think he actually went into Wall Street pets that morning. "
"3755450","3755930"," Truly."
"3756170","3759090"," I think it was in Wall Street pets that early morning at like 4 a.m. or some shit like"
"3759090","3759290"," that."
"3759930","3761910"," Um, 20 start, baby. "
"3762670","3764710"," And, uh, we blasted down."
"3764850","3767270"," We didn't have a six month, uh, LA wave down there."
"3767330","3769210"," We blasted down to the actual bottom. "
"3769650","3773210"," And the result was an epic fucking run."
"3774630","3775110"," Epic."
"3776550","3776590"," Epic. "
"3777370","3777750"," Run."
"3778690","3778770"," Epic."
"3780470","3783890"," Stuff that makes most of the people that you love on Fintuit. "
"3783890","3787410"," You guys, the people out there, the million followers, they bought that shit."
"3787590","3789270"," Matter of fact, they were so they all bought."
"3789550","3793670"," I don't know those, those guys bought leaps and they were upside down. "
"3795030","3798810"," They came back to what they disappeared from Wall Street pets came back into Wall Street pets."
"3799770","3801330"," And they were like, I thought my shit was dead."
"3801610","3805110"," They never sold their leaps and their leaps were like burning to the fucking depths of hell. "
"3805230","3806930"," And their leaps were like one, two year out leaps."
"3807630","3809250"," Those fucking things printed balls."
"3811410","3812210"," Overnight millionaires. "
"3814810","3822330"," So my thesis here is if we do get that cell, if this does complete and goes down here and"
"3822330","3824670"," you can get some kind of move like that down there."
"3825390","3830550"," The after effect could be this fucking epic Tesla bull run."
"3831750","3835790"," So from my perspective as a bull, bring it on, baby. "
"3837210","3839170"," I hope, I hope we can get down here."
"3839270","3840430"," You want to close that down there?"
"3840770","3841310"," Bring it to me."
"3841310","3848070"," I want that by so bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. "
"3851060","3852080"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3853820","3858920"," So if this does happen here, you get that fail, you get that squeeze up that confirmation of the"
"3858920","3861380"," roll down, be prepared for it."
"3862260","3865560"," If you're a bull watching this program, a Tesla bull right now, right?"
"3866740","3868680"," Get yourself some dry powder."
"3870200","3876380"," Because you're getting another opportunity, possibly getting another opportunity to buy a major"
"3876380","3876660"," low. "
"3878260","3882000"," Now, if we don't get presented with that major low and that opportunity."
"3884060","3887080"," We're going to talk about where you're going to buy the dip."
"3890050","3891150"," Let me get rid of this here. "
"3891490","3892730"," I'm going to move this down somewhere else."
"3893030","3893430"," Is that it?"
"3893630","3894510"," Yeah, it's missing now, right?"
"3895410","3897970"," If we don't get that opportunity, but I want to show you this."
"3898010","3898250"," Okay. "
"3898250","3898730"," Why?"
"3898870","3899710"," I think that's coming."
"3901330","3905130"," I'm going to show you right now why I think that's going to flip to a 30 minute."
"3905290","3905390"," Nope. "
"3905570","3906990"," We're going to flip to a daily chart instead."
"3907530","3916910"," Can I show the, can I show the, can I show the, can"
"3916910","3922070"," I show the not auto mode?"
"3922310","3923990"," I want to show the, the velo."
"3930000","3931380"," I can't do it right here. "
"3931520","3931860"," I don't know why."
"3932540","3933480"," What was it down here?"
"3935760","3936000"," No."
"3936320","3936520"," Okay. "
"3936820","3939320"," So, I'll show you, show it in the daily velocity."
"3940880","3943940"," What I want to show you here is this, this orange bar right here."
"3944000","3945040"," This is weakly velocity. "
"3947380","3953400"," Do you see how right now we're starting a down move on a weakly velocity down here?"
"3953680","3955400"," You see that when we do this over here?"
"3956340","3958140"," We have these major downside moves in Tesla."
"3959640","3961300"," So that's why I'm hoping we do this down here."
"3961820","3964100"," Get that weakly down here nice and sexy. "
"3964400","3966780"," Get that monthly velocity to the downside."
"3967400","3968080"," Doom and gloom, right?"
"3968920","3970700"," Quarterly velocity down here, right?"
"3970960","3973380"," And this actually brings up a major bull run."
"3974180","3980920"," When you see stuff like this on a weekly timeframe, monthly timeframe, quarterly timeframe, to you,"
"3981000","3985680"," it might seem bearish, but to me as a Tesla investor, long time Tesla investor, I'm looking for"
"3985680","3987120"," that major swing higher. "
"3987740","3989340"," Now, saying all that, right?"
"3991200","3995200"," If this does recover and begin to head higher, right?"
"3995360","3995400"," Yahoo."
"3995700","3996220"," We fuck you."
"3996280","3996480"," Tap. "
"3996600","3996980"," You're wrong."
"3997400","3999740"," You're not getting your doom and gloom captain."
"3999740","4001400"," We're just going to start going higher from here. "
"4001520","4001760"," Woohoo."
"4001920","4002360"," Upside down."
"4002420","4003080"," Fuck you. "
"4003640","4004580"," I'm not a buyer."
"4004760","4005240"," A hundred bucks."
"4005360","4005860"," I'm a buyer. "
"4006000","4006560"," A pair captain."
"4006840","4007680"," That's why I'm bullish here."
"4007780","4009080"," That's why it's going to recover captain. "
"4009580","4010960"," That kind of shit, right?"
"4011440","4012280"," If that does happen."
"4013060","4014500"," If that does happen, right?"
"4016260","4017580"," What are we looking for?"
"4019900","4021160"," What are we looking for?"
"4021400","4022200"," You guys know, right?"
"4024040","4024920"," Just get rid of that."
"4025120","4026200"," Like goofiness right there. "
"4029220","4030660"," What are we looking for?"
"4032160","4033520"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"4034300","4037060"," I had someone say all that's all hindsight trading back here cap."
"4037680","4039200"," Like you don't know what you're talking about. "
"4039400","4040340"," Fuck you're talking about."
"4040840","4043620"," It's right here."
"4045200","4046260"," It's right over here. "
"4046760","4047340"," That's where you buy."
"4048660","4050920"," Where are we at right now on Deli Vello?"
"4051760","4052940"," We're not there, are we?"
"4053520","4054600"," Let me show it to you again."
"4054780","4055260"," Let me get rid of this. "
"4057580","4058800"," Are we there right now?"
"4058960","4060240"," Let me make a bigger so you can see it."
"4061300","4062620"," Are we there right now?"
"4063280","4063660"," No."
"4064920","4066860"," We want Deli velocity down here, right?"
"4067580","4068500"," Somewhere down here. "
"4068740","4069600"," Somewhere in here, right?"
"4069840","4070360"," Somewhere in here."
"4070520","4071340"," Are we there right now?"
"4072020","4072420"," No."
"4074740","4075940"," We're at minus eleven. "
"4075940","4078720"," We need to be minus twenty-five or minus fifty."
"4079940","4082120"," Why do we need to be there to buy a dip?"
"4082700","4083700"," A meaningful dip."
"4084000","4084920"," Let's look and find out. "
"4086380","4087340"," You want to see one?"
"4088460","4090460"," There's a fucking meaningful dip right there."
"4091560","4094820"," Do you see old Captain coming out and saying, now we're about to turn to the upside."
"4096040","4098479"," Get all the big bulls out there saying he's fucking wrong. "
"4099040","4099580"," No, I was right."
"4100380","4101340"," This one right here."
"4102880","4103300"," Right?"
"4104460","4105920"," Nice big dip down there. "
"4106080","4106840"," Buy the fucking dip."
"4107040","4107840"," What happened here?"
"4108359","4109600"," Let's take a look and see."
"4111060","4113439"," Nice meaningful fucking dip buys, right?"
"4114899","4119800"," Even if you weren't a seller after this, wouldn't you love to be a DCA or down there?"
"4120220","4120800"," Think about that. "
"4122180","4124700"," You go out and fint when you're like, I bought that fucking dip."
"4124859","4125859"," I bought that fucking dip."
"4126560","4128520"," I'll buy this fucking dip down here. "
"4129920","4131460"," I'm always a buyer, bro."
"4131460","4132500"," Yeah, you are."
"4132640","4135000"," But you're always a buyer at the most opportune fucking times. "
"4135720","4136020"," Right?"
"4137620","4138740"," You are the badass."
"4139920","4141960"," I want to create an army."
"4142960","4148859"," An army, literal army, of Tessa bulls that bought the best fucking time. "
"4150200","4155840"," I give a fine fuck about Tessa bulls on fint with them in bulls for 20 years, 10 years, five"
"4155840","4156060"," years."
"4156939","4163260"," I want an army of Tessa bulls that are like, I bought every fucking capitulation, the major ones."
"4164399","4166080"," I bought every fucking one of them. "
"4166920","4170220"," I just watched my money just grow and grow and grow."
"4170439","4176279"," I want you to come back in 20 years and say, pick up, I followed you for 20 fucking years."
"4177120","4178000"," You made me rich. "
"4179520","4180479"," I'm serious here."
"4182319","4183920"," Let's get another one back here."
"4185100","4186859"," Look at that bad boy right there. "
"4190540","4192359"," Don't know when to buy the dip on Tesla."
"4193340","4194860"," That's April 2023."
"4196200","4197820"," Don't know when to buy the dip on Tesla. "
"4198980","4200900"," That's June 2023."
"4203450","4204970"," Another dip to buy down here."
"4205790","4206270"," Right?"
"4206410","4207850"," Just buying dips, buying dips. "
"4207930","4214690"," Every time we're down there, this might be the best fucking tool you could ever have of when to buy"
"4214690","4215330"," Tesla."
"4217270","4219930"," Now I don't give a fuck about, like, see right here?"
"4221030","4222370"," I don't care about that one."
"4222710","4223530"," I bought this one. "
"4225150","4227330"," I don't care about the interest stuff."
"4227850","4229490"," I care about the major lows."
"4232270","4233010"," You're Tesla bull. "
"4233210","4234150"," That's what you care about."
"4235950","4237250"," So are we there now?"
"4237770","4238570"," We're not, are we?"
"4239030","4240290"," Let me show you something else neat here."
"4241390","4241710"," Okay?"
"4243270","4248630"," See how you have, see how you have this top here in Tesla and the daily velocity, right?"
"4249730","4255750"," Let's look at prior examples of this topping of daily velocity and see how many examples there are"
"4255750","4260370"," of velocity going negative briefly and then coming back up for the run. "
"4261150","4261830"," There's none."
"4262950","4263550"," Zero."
"4265270","4265870"," Zero. "
"4267690","4270650"," Maybe you got a friend out there that's like, cap's wrong."
"4273350","4276370"," This could pull up, we go positive in that daily fellow, bro."
"4277490","4279310"," Let's find out the last time that happened. "
"4280410","4280850"," Right?"
"4281010","4282350"," We got this major high up here, right?"
"4282570","4283330"," Major high right here."
"4284290","4285370"," That one right there, that tick."
"4286450","4286890"," Right?"
"4288130","4289570"," Let's do the last major one right here. "
"4293170","4293830"," Did we recover?"
"4294410","4295370"," Fuck no, we went lower."
"4299730","4300770"," What about this one up here?"
"4302410","4303730"," This one right here."
"4304350","4305850"," This looks like it could have done it right. "
"4306050","4306770"," It didn't, did it."
"4307490","4308350"," It went lower."
"4309910","4312150"," It's minus 25 velocity, right?"
"4312630","4316430"," So minus 25 velocity, minus 50 velocity are key, right?"
"4319130","4322390"," But we didn't come down here a little bit and then go big again, did we?"
"4322890","4324770"," We went lower and then we went lower again. "
"4326170","4327330"," You know what I'm saying here?"
"4327970","4329030"," There's another one right here."
"4330330","4331030"," There's another one."
"4331090","4333570"," Let's watch this one right there. "
"4335810","4337230"," This would be you."
"4337330","4338290"," I'm going to show you what you are."
"4340590","4341030"," Right?"
"4341550","4342170"," Right here. "
"4343990","4345270"," Pretend that's right now."
"4345650","4346090"," We go lower."
"4346930","4349430"," We go up a tiny bit and you're like, hey, captain's wrong again. "
"4350230","4351590"," You're like, yeah, fuck that guy."
"4351710","4353150"," Look at whoo, everything's fucking awesome."
"4353810","4354130"," Boom. "
"4354510","4355070"," Deps of hell."
"4355250","4355630"," You're fucked."
"4357610","4359070"," So what is the rule?"
"4359990","4363030"," You're waiting for minus 25 minus 50 to DCA. "
"4364150","4364750"," Does that make sense?"
"4365390","4366890"," So we hit minus 25 on daily velocity."
"4367610","4368630"," You make your first buy."
"4369750","4370590"," We go down to minus 50. "
"4370810","4371730"," You make your second buy."
"4373410","4375630"," And the probability is that you're going to minus 50."
"4375810","4382390"," Anyways, only once out of every eight or ten times, are you going to get that minus 25 get buy"
"4382390","4383730"," back and off and run it again?"
"4389000","4394820"," So if you're a Tesla bull, here's my word of advice to you. "
"4396640","4397360"," Chill."
"4398980","4400800"," Let price lead the way."
"4401980","4407000"," Wait until velocity is daily velocity is down to minus 25 minus 50. "
"4408460","4411960"," And we will revisit Tesla as a buy."
"4413560","4414740"," I'm not looking."
"4415520","4418860"," I am not fucking looking for this bullshit right here. "
"4418980","4421300"," Well, the moment price gets above it, bro, I'll buy it."
"4421720","4422700"," I'm not looking for it."
"4423500","4426580"," I'm looking for daily velocity to get to minus 25 minus 50. "
"4427160","4428440"," Without fucking fail."
"4429440","4429840"," I win."
"4430840","4433260"," Every single fucking time. "
"4435060","4436240"," You want to be a winner?"
"4437080","4438640"," Do you want to be a winner with Kevin June James?"
"4439400","4440520"," That's a real question."
"4445410","4446670"," Stop listening to the news."
"4447590","4449570"," Stop watching this shit on Fintuit. "
"4450250","4453790"," Stop reading the newspaper, dumping fucking garbage about Tesla."
"4454570","4456930"," Stop reading the newspapers about the good shit about Tesla."
"4457830","4460590"," Wait for that velocity to get down to minus 25 minus 50. "
"4461150","4464550"," We'll look for a turn series of higher lows."
"4465530","4466410"," We're going to make an entry."
"4466990","4469810"," We're going to take Tesla on another nice fat run. "
"4470270","4474290"," And you're going to sit back there and know you bought the bottom and you can exit where the fuck"
"4474290","4475650"," you want or you just hold it forever."
"4476750","4479450"," And the next time it happens, we'll come back again."
"4480270","4481590"," We'll buy that bottom again. "
"4482230","4485910"," And in 20 years, you'll come back and you'll say, you made me rich."
"4491380","4493140"," So right now, there's no dip buy in Tesla."
"4493500","4494880"," Now you could did today trade this. "
"4496080","4499760"," You want to buy yourself a squeeze or something for the cross above and the daily and the weekly."
"4499780","4500360"," You can do that."
"4500660","4502180"," You can dick around doing that stuff. "
"4502520","4503740"," But this is for a Tesla."
"4504020","4507800"," This show right now, this segment is for a Tesla fucking investor."
"4509420","4510360"," That's what it's for. "
"4510680","4512100"," It's for a real true Tesla bull."
"4513100","4514600"," Real true Tesla gang."
"4516340","4519240"," Buy the lows hold for 20 years. "
"4521340","4522480"," That's what this is about."
"4529070","4529690"," Good question."
"4530270","4531990"," Is that thesis good in every other ticker?"
"4532230","4532350"," No. "
"4533410","4536250"," Tickers run differently on velocity."
"4536810","4538470"," They have different velocities that they run on."
"4538950","4540930"," You can find patterns on the good question. "
"4541330","4541390"," No."
"4542110","4545790"," To be truthful, the indexes are one of the hardest ones to trade it on."
"4546210","4548090"," It's very complex using it on indexes. "
"4549510","4554830"," They work on multi levels, multi velocity levels going all the way down to fucking quarterly and"
"4554830","4555050"," shit."
"4555630","4560810"," Individual tickers, much clearer, much clearer using this stuff on individual tickers."
"4561250","4567130"," Specifically to Tesla, this fucker works bad ass on Tesla on daily velocity. "
"4567550","4569390"," It's like never fucking fail."
"4570230","4574490"," Now there might be runs in between, but I'm talking about being a Tesla investor."
"4575990","4582490"," Or I want to buy some fucking 25 cent Tesla calls and literally watch them go to 40 fucking"
"4582490","4582930"," dollars. "
"4584810","4586870"," Literally watch them go to fucking 40 bucks."
"4587450","4594070"," So if you're that guy, that gal, that they, that them, him, her, whenever you want to call"
"4594070","4601470"," yourself, stick around in this show or find some friends and be like, whatever that guy says, we're"
"4601470","4603790"," at minus 25 and 50 fucking find me."
"4609350","4609950"," That's right. "
"4610150","4610510"," That's right."
"4610650","4611030"," Connect mobile."
"4615510","4615830"," That's right. "
"4615970","4616670"," And there are people here."
"4616810","4619330"," You can, you can find Joe Donut has this tool."
"4620130","4621270"," Ask Joe Donut. "
"4621510","4622230"," Find him on Twitter."
"4622350","4622610"," He's a Tesla."
"4623170","4624150"," He's a Tesla gang. "
"4626450","4626850"," Right?"
"4627170","4627490"," Joe Donut."
"4627690","4628370"," He's a Tesla gang."
"4628570","4629230"," Ask, find that guy. "
"4629430","4629810"," He's got it."
"4629810","4632890"," If he already knows this, ask him, he'll tell you."
"4634790","4637550"," And once you see it, you're like, oh shit, I see it. "
"4638370","4640290"," And once you see it, it freaks you out."
"4640990","4642510"," It's game changing for you."
"4643010","4645710"," Literally game changing for you. "
"4649500","4650300"," Game changing."
"4650740","4652760"," So I don't care about all this price action in here."
"4652840","4653560"," You shouldn't either. "
"4654420","4659580"," And if you see some bad news come out or Tesla drops some bad news, some asshole comes out fake"
"4659580","4660120"," bad news."
"4660520","4661300"," I don't fucking care."
"4661740","4662580"," All the better. "
"4664120","4666400"," All the better for me to get a better price on Tesla."
"4676220","4677420"," All the better for me."
"4678480","4680120"," Here you can do it yourself, right?"
"4680680","4682400"," You can go back and look at option history. "
"4683000","4683780"," Go back down here."
"4683980","4688240"," Go back down here in October 31st, 2023."
"4689580","4689960"," Right?"
"4691060","4692100"," And then find yourself. "
"4692540","4698200"," Find out what all the options are going up to $264 on different timeframes."
"4698200","4700360"," Three months, six months, eight months, whatever."
"4700560","4701020"," See what they grew. "
"4704480","4705100"," It's insane."
"4706260","4707040"," Life changing."
"4707740","4708200"," Changes your life. "
"4708540","4708740"," Trust me."
"4709700","4714600"," It literally funded me to long other parts of the market this past year."
"4715040","4719200"," So there you go on Tesla. "
"4719640","4720740"," Now here's another thing too."
"4721000","4722420"," Now saying all that, right?"
"4722620","4724140"," Let's say Tesla goes up here and beats this."
"4724780","4725840"," Comes back higher again. "
"4725900","4726940"," You're like, yeah, I fucking caps wrong."
"4727300","4728540"," I still am not a buyer here."
"4729440","4730900"," I buy when it's down here. "
"4730900","4732120"," That's when I bought."
"4732860","4736280"," I don't want to see something like this and then a heavy hard roll down here."
"4736600","4737940"," They trapped all your asses. "
"4738180","4738680"," You're all fucking."
"4738680","4739860"," I'm down here actually buying."
"4741240","4743260"," So minus 25 minus 50. "
"4743720","4744700"," It's a fucking rule."
"4745460","4746260"," It's a rule."
"4750490","4751150"," All right. "
"4751390","4752270"," That's enough to Tesla."
"4752490","4754150"," Do you guys have any, how about this at this moment?"
"4755270","4759410"," Do you have any questions that I can possibly might not be able to answer any questions for you,"
"4759410","4761590"," but you're a Tesla bull or a Tesla bear."
"4762430","4765830"," Do you have any questions for me on this analysis for you?"
"4769260","4770620"," Let me read the chat really quick. "
"4779920","4780560"," I'm waiting."
"4780900","4782140"," You can ask right now if you want."
"4782260","4788260"," If you can't chat on YouTube, you can always join us on Twitch and you can chat for free if"
"4788260","4789840"," you sign up for Amazon Prime Gaming. "
"4790460","4796060"," The reason we have a member here, the reason we charge $5 is because we get overrun with Russian"
"4796060","4800280"," sex bots and we get overrun with people panicking in the market on downside."
"4800900","4801740"," Then we get on the upside."
"4801820","4804180"," We get weird bulls coming in saying we're going to the moon. "
"4804640","4806180"," So we got to cut out all that counter alpha."
"4807380","4811060"," So you can either pay five bucks on YouTube chat or you can go to Twitch and do a free"
"4811060","4812260"," option for you to not pay."
"4812780","4815620"," But that extra step that keeps these people away from us. "
"4816220","4818480"," So if you're ever like, do you have any questions right now?"
"4818560","4819500"," Now's the time to ask about."
"4819640","4822080"," If I can, I may not be able to answer them, but if I can, I will."
"4825020","4827200"," Are you asking about Tesla splits right now?"
"4827420","4828400"," I know about Tesla splits. "
"4828620","4830400"," You just got one in 2022, right?"
"4830400","4830720"," No."
"4831020","4831720"," Was it 2022?"
"4831740","4832540"," It was the last one."
"4833080","4834900"," I'm assuming you're expecting a Tesla split. "
"4835160","4836660"," I'm not expecting a Tesla split."
"4837600","4839100"," Anything under 300 bucks."
"4839700","4841280"," Are we above 300 right now?"
"4841460","4841720"," No. "
"4842100","4845380"," So I don't see a split coming at 200 or 100."
"4845880","4847080"," I don't see a split right now."
"4847380","4848640"," I know I get what you're saying. "
"4849340","4853680"," If it even if it does come, even if we do get a split this year, right?"
"4854320","4855860"," Let's we get a split next week."
"4856680","4857660"," I don't care."
"4858140","4860060"," I get there to be a run and stuff like that. "
"4860240","4860820"," I really don't care."
"4860900","4861700"," I care about the velocity."
"4862420","4864220"," It's I can prove the velocity. "
"4865360","4867840"," You can't prove when that that that comes."
"4869560","4870440"," I have run."
"4871160","4873500"," Some of you guys have actually seen my history on this. "
"4874140","4877640"," I used to, I posted, I was in for the splits for all the Tesla splits."
"4878240","4878840"," Made a lot of money."
"4879400","4882000"," I actually helped through their earnings when those take place too. "
"4882880","4883800"," And I have the history to prove it."
"4883800","4888540"," I actually posted the pages once and I got I got yelled at on Twitter that it was bad to"
"4888540","4889040"," do that stuff."
"4889220","4890100"," So I don't do it anymore. "
"4894620","4895600"," Yeah, you guys."
"4895920","4897900"," So what we're doing here is we're going to be launching."
"4899380","4901000"," So what we do here is free. "
"4901200","4903220"," It's been free for a long, long time."
"4904000","4905120"," We've been very successful."
"4905980","4908380"," And I don't mean like it's been awesome or anything. "
"4908500","4913940"," I mean like it's been successful in what we've set up to do, which is try to help retail traders"
"4913940","4914920"," get an edge."
"4915720","4921440"," Have some hard tools that they can use in their investing and trading career."
"4922460","4924620"," So that they stop getting fucked all the time. "
"4925080","4925480"," We were sick."
"4925580","4926340"," We succeeded in that."
"4926620","4931100"," We're at a point now where it's grown to a point where we need to make it sustainable. "
"4931500","4931940"," What we do here."
"4932780","4933740"," Have some continuation."
"4934260","4935660"," Keep people involved. "
"4936260","4939040"," And then the cost of this is cost me six figures."
"4939040","4942280"," Six figures, not 100,000 either."
"4942420","4944600"," It's constantly higher than that to run this for three years. "
"4945340","4948480"," And I got people here that have been helping us for free for three years."
"4949160","4949840"," And we want to keep this."
"4950040","4952020"," We're going to make an attempt to make it permanent. "
"4952940","4955720"," And there are people out there that want to support that permanency."
"4956420","4962600"," So I've made a commitment to always having some free version for us."
"4963420","4970100"," My original commitment to keep a free version of what we do here. "
"4970280","4971260"," And so that free version."
"4975920","4977080"," That free version."
"4979260","4983820"," Is going to be there in some form. "
"4983960","4987360"," I think we have to charge 20 bucks or something like that for that free version."
"4987520","4989040"," You'll always get the live streams."
"4989680","4993440"," You'll always be a version of the discord, but I got to charge because I got to keep the bots"
"4993440","4993900"," out. "
"4993900","4995580"," I have to protect the safety of our members."
"4996420","5001760"," So by charging, I get to pick out all of these fucking bots and scammers from the discord."
"5003280","5007040"," And then you're always going to get that stuff in and includes that. "
"5007040","5007340"," That point."
"5007520","5009120"," Also includes the chat."
"5009780","5012080"," So you get the chat forever for free stuff like that. "
"5012160","5014720"," Well, not free, but whether you're paying now gets rolled into that."
"5015340","5017760"," Now, there'll be a version of this tool."
"5018600","5019720"," Available for Tesla. "
"5020260","5021240"," I think at a $25."
"5022360","5023360"," Entry or something."
"5023400","5024920"," I think it's 25 or 35 bucks. "
"5025360","5028720"," We have like some some groupings like 25 35 45."
"5029540","5033820"," So there is an entry level price for you to see this every fucking day."
"5034880","5036700"," On your own without me. "
"5038180","5041620"," Launching here in the 31st, I believe, end of the month of January."
"5042180","5045620"," We've got a developer here that's doing this for us right now."
"5045640","5047540"," This work for fucking free. "
"5048340","5049840"," Guy doing this for free."
"5050460","5051640"," I want to pay this guy."
"5052220","5053240"," I have to pay him. "
"5053440","5054540"," I don't know where that money comes from."
"5055140","5055980"," This developer."
"5056920","5059140"," On a bullshit promise for me. "
"5059580","5060880"," Like some guy, some random."
"5061180","5061800"," I'm a guy going."
"5062580","5067660"," We're going to try to make this thing take care of itself and grow into something big. "
"5068680","5069600"," For retail."
"5070240","5070360"," Right."
"5070800","5071460"," Can you help us?"
"5071740","5073480"," This guy is breaking his ass. "
"5073980","5075580"," Working all night long right now."

"5090120","5090640"," That's our developer."
"5091120","5091480"," He's a badass. "
"5092220","5094380"," This guy is doing some badass shit in the background."
"5096740","5098600"," So stick around, I guess."
"5099560","5104580"," And yeah, if you want to see this on your own, you're going to get access to it. "
"5104580","5105600"," Dirt cheap."

"5146160","5146940"," They're just placeholders."
"5147940","5151780"," You'll see those levels come out in the coming week or two and hype."
"5152180","5155720"," The other thing too is coming up with this is that Joe Donut. "

"5277070","5280050"," Being that free member because you're going to have the group."
"5280710","5282490"," With access to all this stuff."
"5282490","5286070"," And you're going to have a guy like you're going to have some guy named Bob. "
"5286470","5289850"," And all he trades is ticker symbol X X T."
"5291010","5294790"," And I guarantee he's going to come into the discord and into this group in the chat."
"5294790","5296510"," He's going to say hey, hey, hey."
"5297190","5300710"," My ticker finally has a six trigger ball cluster. "
"5301210","5302570"," Game is perfect on it."
"5302950","5303750"," All these other things."

"5328450","5329470"," Let me cool as fuck. "
"5330290","5330970"," Super cool."
"5332950","5335550"," All right, hold on here a second."
"5335550","5340370"," So I posted that post that in Twitch that discord invite. "
"5340370","5341470"," There's another one for you."
"5342450","5343210"," Here's the website."

"5367800","5369860"," There's a free sign up on my website."
"5370280","5371020"," You just sent it for free. "
"5371020","5374420"," And you'll get notified of all this stuff as it happens."
"5374600","5375900"," If you just sign up for the free."
"5376720","5378140"," There's the website right there. "
"5378520","5379540"," I just posted on YouTube."
"5380840","5382480"," Here's the one on Twitch."
"5383120","5386960"," It's already going to rant this morning, but if you're a Tesla bull out there. "
"5387860","5391260"," I got testables that my friends have been hanging out with for years now."
"5392700","5394200"," They are all fucking happy."
"5394660","5396280"," Every single one of them. "
"5397720","5399420"," So stick around."
"5399420","5400620"," You're testable."
"5400780","5401040"," Hang around. "
"5401540","5402740"," Then go back to your groups."
"5403400","5404680"," You can be the happy fucking bull."
"5405000","5406580"," It's a fucking awesome feeling, man. "
"5406960","5407600"," Telling you."
"5408060","5414520"," It's a fucking great feeling knowing that you're buying any major capitulation over 20 years on a"
"5414520","5415340"," ticker that you love."
"5415780","5420280"," And watching it just grow over 20 years exponentially, right?"
"5420500","5420840"," Like an apple. "
"5421780","5422680"," It's fucking awesome."
"5423580","5424340"," There's nothing like it."
"5425060","5425880"," Nothing like it. "
"5431150","5432770"," We're going to go to spy really quick."
"5443110","5444890"," Come back up here to test the five minute trigger."
"5445130","5445970"," Sold down right now. "
"5446290","5448710"," Expect a more downside move right here on that check."
"5456610","5457730"," Gamma flips right here."
"5458110","5458710"," Roughly right here. "
"5463450","5465910"," If you're going to try to day trade this on some calls to the upside."
"5466610","5467830"," Let's talk about our rules, right?"
"5468450","5469530"," Our tools that we talk about."
"5470790","5473050"," If you look for a reversal, what are you looking for here, right?"
"5474330","5476410"," A flattening of the white line, flattening of the red line. "
"5476510","5476990"," We got those."
"5478130","5478650"," Check."
"5481530","5483070"," Are you taking calls here?"
"5483350","5483750"," Fuck no. "
"5484850","5487950"," If you wanted to take some calls here, what are you looking for?"
"5490030","5491230"," You're looking for."
"5492830","5494610"," To be a tactician here, right?"
"5496630","5498670"," You're looking for that turn in the five minute."
"5501170","5503410"," You're looking for the turn in the one minute. "
"5504970","5506530"," You're looking for price."
"5508070","5509130"," Pay attention here."
"5510130","5511810"," You don't want to see this, do you?"
"5512270","5516030"," On buying calls, buying calls, bull trap, depths of hell. "
"5516990","5517310"," Right?"
"5517570","5518370"," You're not looking for that, are you?"
"5519910","5521170"," What are you looking for?"
"5530430","5532710"," Looking for that little bit of squeeze right there, aren't you?"
"5534530","5536610"," Looking to beat that one right there, aren't you?"
"5537450","5538850"," Come back down in here."
"5539270","5539990"," You see that action?"
"5540210","5540530"," What do you do?"
"5541150","5545150"," If that holds, then this begins to break right here."
"5546270","5548370"," You can be a call buyer and zero dates briefly. "
"5548830","5549810"," Take that right there."
"5551150","5553550"," It's a nice trade, nice intraday trade."
"5554370","5555630"," Are you still bullish here though?"
"5555970","5556330"," Fuck no. "
"5556770","5559350"," This thing could reverse right back down on you and send you down here."
"5560590","5563290"," So if you're looking to get long again as a bull, what are you looking for?"
"5564990","5567030"," How do you get long again as a bull in here?"
"5572170","5573570"," It's this action right here, right?"
"5573570","5574310"," Boom, boom, boom."
"5574510","5575010"," Come up here. "
"5575710","5576030"," Right?"
"5576190","5578690"," A little bit of rejection right here, but it holds."
"5579810","5581490"," You see that hold, right?"
"5582510","5585150"," You'll actually see that big squeeze right there."
"5586850","5588470"," That's a juicy one right there. "
"5590650","5593190"," But the best trade here, you want to know what it is?"
"5593650","5594210"," It's right here."
"5594990","5598430"," If this one comes down and holds, that's the money trade."
"5599550","5600850"," That's the big money trade. "
"5601490","5606510"," That would be a confirmation that we're going to go back and retest all this stuff up here."
"5606850","5610970"," And we'll trade that 480 once again and that all time high."
"5612150","5613490"," It's hang tight right now. "
"5615350","5619170"," If you're a seller here or want to be a seller instead of a buyer, what are you looking for?"
"5619310","5619530"," Do you know?"
"5627010","5629310"," You're looking for a little bit of rejection right there."
"5630710","5632070"," Beat that previous low."
"5632270","5632990"," Are you taking that trade?"
"5633330","5633590"," Fuck no. "
"5633590","5641260"," You're waiting to see if the bulls fail to buy there."
"5641460","5647620"," If they do fail to buy, slam the buy button on some puts."
"5648520","5649120"," Right there. "
"5649240","5650420"," Go straight down to the depths of hell."
"5654770","5656230"," Right now you just sit on hands."
"5656590","5657970"," No trade for a bull or a bear here. "
"5662190","5664130"," Although I think we're going down some more."
"5666130","5667030"," Personally, but."
"5671110","5671910"," Thank you, Bork. "
"5672050","5672750"," I appreciate it, man."
"5672750","5674430"," I just saw that Bork."
"5674570","5677510"," We just set up the invitations to the website in the. "
"5678110","5679410"," I love you, Bork, by the way."
"5679630","5680130"," I love you too."
"5680150","5680670"," Trade a podcast. "
"5681390","5682490"," And I also want to say something else."
"5683550","5688490"," Anybody that's in this stream right now that I've been here since day one, I fucking love you."
"5689290","5692550"," Fucking love you for sticking around to the good, the bad, the losses, the wins. "
"5693550","5693990"," I love you."
"5694210","5695670"," You guys are what makes what we are."
"5695830","5696190"," What we do. "
"5696250","5697190"," You are this community."
"5698970","5699910"," I want to say that to you."
"5700310","5703150"," Admins, moderators here in discord. "
"5703970","5707790"," People that moderate and admin the Twitter handles and stuff."
"5708650","5709570"," Thank you to all of you guys."
"5709850","5710870"," We it's not me. "
"5711030","5711310"," It's you."
"5712070","5713750"," So thank you to all of you for being here."
"5714030","5717030"," Anyone that's come along the way jumping on board, helping us out through the way. "
"5717450","5718770"," I appreciate all of you as well."
"5719410","5720510"," You guys are what makes this."
"5720750","5720910"," They mean. "
"5721790","5722890"," I ain't no fucking fur."
"5723010","5723890"," You guys see me lose here."
"5724050","5725730"," You guys see me lose big trades in the show. "
"5726410","5727970"," I want you to know that trade every fucking day."
"5727970","5729970"," Not every day, but pretty much every goddamn day."
"5730050","5731110"," What am I supposed to be trading?"
"5731810","5733530"," You guys have made me a better trader too. "
"5733830","5734970"," You guys made me a better day trader."
"5735310","5736690"," You guys made me a better investor."
"5737230","5737270"," Better. "
"5737530","5737970"," All of it."
"5738390","5739130"," You guys are forced."
"5739450","5742690"," You guys have forced me to trade more than I ever felt comfortable doing. "
"5743470","5746290"," They just take good, just nine good trades a year."
"5746730","5747970"," Fuck around day trading and all that stuff."
"5748090","5750910"," You guys have put me through a, you guys have put me through like a grinder. "
"5751490","5754050"," Like you guys have put me through like what I was in the army."
"5754050","5756930"," Like you put me through the fucking, you know, the meat grinder."
"5757790","5759130"," So I appreciate that too. "
"5759590","5766150"," You guys have held me to a, to like a, I don't know if they have boot camp or whatever,"
"5766710","5768170"," but I appreciate that."
"5768410","5771050"," I've noticed I can see the difference in my trading."
"5771330","5775070"," I can see the difference in my, my, my, your books and all that kind of stuff. "
"5775270","5777390"," So I want you to know that I'm grateful."
"5781400","5783140"," Oh, my discord pings coming through stream."
"5783300","5784000"," Let me turn that off. "
"5784140","5784360"," Thank you."
"5784420","5785260"," I'll turn that back off again."
"5788170","5789470"," Target downside target. "
"5791610","5793490"," That's three four seventy."
"5795910","5797770"," Ninety next target below that."
"5800190","5801090"," Right here, baby. "
"5807580","5808620"," Right down here."
"5808720","5809360"," This one right here."
"5811000","5812380"," And that one right there. "
"5837600","5839380"," That better right there for right now."
"5850700","5851580"," Thanks, proton."
"5852500","5852820"," I'm reading. "
"5853020","5853800"," I wasn't reading the chat."
"5853960","5854680"," I'm starting to read the chat."
"5854680","5855960"," I'm going to try to get through the chat here. "
"5858460","5859980"," I want a little bit of capitulation."
"5860320","5863440"," I'm a buyer, but I want, I want that like that one last little like."
"5864760","5867400"," I always love that like that last little bloodbath. "
"5868060","5871140"," Like that last little fuck you and then, and then we're running off and running."
"5872540","5873560"," We might not get it."
"5873660","5874060"," We don't get it. "
"5874120","5874860"," We start turning higher."
"5874960","5875860"," I'll take some calls, but."
"5881090","5881610"," All right. "
"5881730","5882570"," Now let's talk about you."
"5882690","5882850"," All right."
"5882990","5883350"," How about this?"
"5884430","5886030"," We're going to do a second segment. "
"5887890","5889830"," After that big long rants, I'm going to take a break."
"5890090","5891610"," I'll leave the stream up and take a quick break."
"5891650","5892190"," Get some coffee. "
"5892670","5894590"," But at some point today, we're going to have a chat."
"5894990","5897690"," If not, if we get, if the price action gets busy."
"5898610","5902270"," We'll have a chat at 4 p.m. But at some point today, if nothing happens, we hang out. "
"5902370","5905610"," We start doing this bullshit sideways three hour look back to go higher."
"5906010","5906750"," Something like that."
"5907810","5909110"," We're going to chat about. "
"5912390","5917670"," How to interpret how to follow along and interpret the things that I talk about on stream."
"5918270","5919010"," In discord."
"5920290","5922130"," On at captain's alpha. "
"5923130","5923730"," On."
"5925090","5926890"," Twitter, my main Twitter handle."
"5927230","5927810"," That kind of stuff. "
"5928670","5931570"," We're doing posts on the website right now as well."
"5932470","5933070"," And."
"5933810","5934730"," We'll talk. "
"5934930","5935990"," We need to talk about the."
"5937530","5938770"," Continuity of all of that."
"5939550","5941910"," Right now, it's hard because everything is free. "
"5942670","5944990"," I can only get pulled so many ways, right?"
"5946210","5949550"," So it's hard for me to get continuity across all platforms."
"5950070","5951210"," That is a fault of mine."
"5952010","5954090"," So I'm like running a narrative, carrying them over. "
"5954310","5958270"," Then I got some two narratives, three narratives talking about the same time on social media and"
"5958270","5958490"," stuff."
"5959070","5961670"," And it gets confusing for new traders, new investors."
"5962130","5963130"," They're like, what does he mean by this?"
"5963130","5965310"," And I do a lot of shit posting too. "
"5965750","5971550"," When we roll into this new format, you're going to see the some of you know, some of you guys"
"5971550","5973370"," are followers of at captain's alpha."
"5974250","5976010"," I'm very straight faced there."
"5976010","5976290"," Right. "
"5976630","5977470"," It's always serious."
"5977710","5979430"," It's all what I do make a post there."
"5979510","5980070"," It's always serious. "
"5980250","5981410"," It's always very direct."
"5982050","5983610"," There's more continuity there."
"5983750","5987130"," I want you to know as we switch over to this new fucking thing we're doing. "
"5988390","5991110"," You're going to get more continuity across everything."
"5991650","5997730"," What we're building right now is a place where I can have one straight faced voice on the website."
"5998210","6004590"," And then it gets dispersed to discord to the trade the trigger, trade the trigger Twitter handle. "
"6004990","6010310"," And you're going to see me pull back more than likely on my captain Jim James persona on Twitter."
"6010810","6012330"," And then I'll be like my personal handle."
"6012970","6014210"," It's like my handle. "
"6015070","6017690"," And push this stuff off onto the trade the trigger."
"6018850","6022370"," So if you're like, I don't like that fucking guy getting drunk late night, which I'm not actually"
"6022370","6022590"," drunk."
"6022650","6025490"," I'm drinking marijuana tea. "
"6025850","6030670"," I don't drink anymore, not like, not like I used to."
"6030970","6036230"," But you're going to get more of like this is just captain Jim James and this is the straight faced"
"6036230","6038590"," public persona of captain Jim James."
"6039450","6045010"," And it'll be consistent to cross all plot all places, I guess, would be the best way to say it. "
"6047930","6049170"," V shape recovery today."
"6049430","6050230"," Yeah, this looks like."
"6050450","6053490"," So right now we're either going to get a reversal here. "
"6053490","6056670"," I prefer my own personal."
"6056670","6057930"," I'm a greedy pig."
"6058430","6063410"," So I just prefer like that one quick bloodbath and then this right here and I buy that right there. "
"6064050","6066570"," That's what I'm looking for some something sexy like that."
"6066690","6067550"," I always love that shit."
"6068730","6075350"," Now if that doesn't happen, we start to reverse the upside and we can prove that we're above the"
"6075350","6076090"," hourly trigger. "
"6076090","6076950"," We're back on trend."
"6077290","6079390"," Let me explain this to you in a better fashion."
"6079530","6079710"," Okay. "
"6080590","6082130"," Some of you might be new around here."
"6082210","6084070"," Let me explain this in a better fashion for you."
"6084070","6084290"," Okay. "
"6085870","6087890"," Um, give me a second here."
"6088850","6091550"," You're going to, this is a great example too for right now."
"6091550","6092690"," So this is a good example. "
"6093950","6095810"," Now this works for bulls and bears."
"6096530","6099590"," Whether you're, whether we're selling or buying doesn't matter."
"6100190","6102250"," So that V shape or whatever, right?"
"6102250","6105810"," This could be like a squeeze on the upside too, right?"
"6106050","6108210"," If you flip this chart upside down, it'd be the same concept. "
"6109950","6114510"," And I'm going to show this to you in a better, or I'm going to visualize this to you in"
"6114510","6114950"," a better way."
"6115170","6115270"," Okay."
"6116510","6121370"," Now number one, we have a, we have a top right now. "
"6121950","6122750"," I'm going to show you this."
"6122850","6124330"," We're going to flip around here for a minute."
"6128070","6130550"," So in terms of gamma, okay. "
"6131610","6133070"," Look at gamma real quick."
"6133310","6133430"," Okay."
"6133890","6136070"," You see how thick these blue lines are here?"
"6136750","6138430"," This is a call wall. "
"6138870","6139370"," Okay."
"6141930","6143630"," The top of the market right here."
"6144630","6145170"," Okay. "
"6146250","6147810"," Real top of the market right here."
"6148130","6149290"," We tapped it this morning."
"6151010","6152770"," Now there's a pin there as well. "
"6152970","6153190"," Okay."
"6154030","6155030"," Like we're pinning this."
"6156990","6157530"," Okay. "
"6157530","6160290"," So the expectation is we traded that 480."
"6160690","6161690"," We traded that this morning."
"6162790","6168850"," Now there is there, I should say there are other levels developing to the upside. "
"6170490","6175690"," So what we need to do is get more call developments, more, more, more market expansion to the"
"6175690","6175910"," upside."
"6176210","6180570"," And we need price to break above and start to park its ass above that call wall."
"6181370","6182570"," Create a new call wall on the upside. "
"6184610","6187970"," Now as we head into Friday, there's a problem."
"6189110","6191870"," This magnet right here goes away as we head into Friday."
"6193230","6196130"," And we have more potential actually sell the market to the downside. "
"6197350","6198890"," So unless we can get above this."
"6200070","6204590"," To get that call expansion upside, we have a high probability of rolling down."
"6205950","6207970"," Friday and even next week. "
"6208710","6209930"," Now there's no."
"6210690","6212930"," Put mark, put gamma market."
"6213090","6216430"," There's a put market, but there's no gamma for puts down here. "
"6217510","6224330"," As a matter of fact, the put gamma is, it ends, I believe, yeah, 4600."
"6225910","6228370"," So there's no, there's no, no put gamma down here."
"6228630","6231050"," It's literally ends at 4600 or 4640. "
"6233170","6238810"," So if this pin disappears on Friday and we can't get above that call wall, we can begin to make"
"6238810","6239390"," our way down."
"6239990","6245670"," We'd be looking for some development of put walls lower so we can get down here."
"6246390","6251230"," Now if that development takes place and we can see this as it happens, we'll start looking for that"
"6251230","6252410"," big role to the downside. "
"6252410","6262310"," But otherwise 40 46 40 46 50 right now is the is the floor as"
"6262310","6262930"," of right now."
"6264550","6268330"," So what I'm looking for right now is for more development to the upside."
"6269310","6273070"," We'll look at the seasonality of this as well, see if we can continue to go higher and stuff like"
"6273070","6273270"," that. "
"6273270","6279610"," But for right now, I'm looking for ping ponging until, ping ponging until Friday."
"6280570","6285850"," And then maybe, maybe an unclench it, a small and clenching to make some significant downside."
"6298200","6300440"," You didn't get the cues today from me on this. "
"6300580","6301660"," Be sure you didn't get it this morning."
"6302880","6303920"," You didn't get SR on cues."
"6304520","6305100"," Check on that. "
"6305220","6305380"," Hold on."
"6342840","6343640"," All right."
"6343640","6344300"," Thanks. "
"6344520","6344960"," I'm Doug Fuller."
"6345140","6345940"," I got that out for you, brother."
"6346120","6347740"," It should happen in the next 15 minutes. "
"6358350","6362270"," I will be calling you in the next day."
"6363750","6367610"," We've been trying to get some finalized stuff the next past day or two."
"6367790","6370990"," Give me a shot after the session today, brother. "
"6371450","6372030"," Give me a call, man."
"6372630","6373750"," Blow me up and I will talk."
"6374910","6375750"," I'll make the time. "
"6376570","6379410"," I apologize for not reaching out to you since then."
"6379410","6382130"," We've been back and forth with a bunch of guys."
"6383210","6385970"," We're like having meetings until late night hours. "
"6389550","6389870"," Yeah."
"6390550","6391290"," Give me a shot, man."
"6391410","6392050"," Let's do it today. "
"6392190","6392410"," Fuck it."
"6392530","6392830"," Let's do it."
"6400730","6401710"," I got you, Doug, brother. "
"6411790","6412490"," Give me one quick second."
"6412650","6413150"," Take a quick break."
"6413310","6414930"," I need to get, I need to take potty break. "
"6415150","6417290"," I need to get some coffee here, but it's like cold."
"6418570","6419070"," Look at that."
"6419250","6419850"," Best dad ever. "
"6420290","6420590"," Oh, yeah."
"6421610","6423830"," Give me like five or 15 minutes really quick."
"6425290","6426610"," This does look bullish. "
"6426970","6429870"," It's starting to get a little bit bullish, but I'm still not convinced yet."
"6430650","6433990"," You guys, if you guys in the chat already know how to do this, right?"
"6436290","6438590"," I'm still not still not on a trade here."
"6438710","6439810"," I want to be above it. "
"6442350","6444210"," But you want to be like up here."
"6446150","6448990"," Taking that trade, but you don't want to happen is."
"6450110","6452230"," We still haven't tested that five minutes. "
"6452230","6455870"," So my one concern here is that we reverse immediately right there."
"6456830","6458670"," You don't want to get trapped in there if that happens."
"6461170","6463850"," I'd like to see a little bit more development to the upside. "
"6466730","6468950"," A little bit more development to the upside."
"6470230","6471970"," I'll leave that there for you so you can see it."
"6473210","6474170"," So if you want to trade it. "
"6480640","6484600"," I used to take trades that you don't used to do your new here."
"6484600","6486960"," I used to take like, I'd take that trade."
"6488520","6489840"," Then I'd take that trade. "
"6491360","6494240"," When it came back down, I'd into the trade again right here."
"6495280","6499520"," I'd take that trade right there and let it come back down."
"6499840","6502800"," I literally exit and take that trade right there. "
"6503760","6504740"," I'd take like each step."
"6505060","6505760"," Boom, boom, boom, boom."
"6505980","6507600"," I don't do that anymore here with you guys. "
"6508420","6508840"," Too many people."
"6508840","6510100"," Too many people get fucking."
"6517760","6519400"," Get off the party line. "
"6522060","6524160"," I'm not doing that with you guys anymore."
"6526920","6529020"," Okay, lay back in like five minutes."
"6529100","6531100"," Have a conversation and put some news on the background. "
"6534520","6536700"," Hurts transitioning away from EVs."
"6537600","6538520"," Fuck the hurts news."
"6538780","6539360"," It means nothing. "
"6540920","6542180"," It's not relevant."
"6542520","6543360"," It's just garbage news."
"6543360","6548660"," I could see in four or five years that Tesla makes up the majority of the Caribbean as well. "
"6548820","6550020"," It makes up the majority of that space."
"6550460","6553500"," So it's negative for Tesla today, but it's a very long term bullet."
"6553560","6555420"," That is not why Tesla is selling today. "
"6555840","6557700"," Because U.S. consumers do not want."
"6557700","6561080"," We saw Tesla selling before that news dropped."
"6561580","6567320"," They just need content to spill to you, I promise. "
"6567980","6569380"," Underperforming area of the market."
"6569380","6572060"," She's going to tell us all about it coming up next on halftime."
"6572060","6572880"," Stay with us. "
"6575160","6577300"," We charted that out days ago."
"6577660","6580800"," We knew it was coming days ago before the news dropped."
"6585240","6586640"," All right, I'll be right back with y'all. "
"6588980","6590300"," Yeah, you got nothing right now."
"6590300","6590620"," Come on."
"6591880","6594960"," This is going to back test right here likely to the squeeze right here. "
"6595140","6598220"," You're going to get that right there right about there."
"6598800","6600160"," You're going to get that right there."
"6600280","6602800"," You're going to get that one right there. "
"6606570","6608430"," You're going to get something like that right there."
"6609790","6611150"," That's what it's looking like right now."
"6617890","6618710"," Be right back. "
"6727970","6729790"," One other note to y'all down there."
"6730130","6732150"," Get this chart down below right here."
"6732330","6732890"," Well, hold on. "
"6735400","6736820"," But I had this on."
"6738960","6740220"," That money dot com."
"6740780","6741780"," This is the cues. "
"6752790","6755410"," As you can see the down off of its lows of earlier today."
"6755630","6756170"," Welcome back to halftime."
"6756470","6757770"," We're continuing our series on the committees. "
"6757770","6760010"," Top country and ideas for 2024."
"6760330","6763390"," Brenda, it's your turn and you're saying they don't read."
"6763690","6764970"," Give us give us the reason why. "
"6765170","6765530"," Reads."
"6765730","6771790"," Yes, so reads have been a real underperformer or especially last year until the fourth quarter all"
"6771790","6772050"," say."
"6772690","6776130"," But when we look at the relative yield that they provide, it's pretty uninspiring. "
"6776430","6780810"," You know, around four percent versus five percent in a money market fund."
"6781290","6782970"," But we think that's likely to change."
"6782970","6786610"," There's also been a lot of concern certainly about commercial office space. "
"6786610","6790630"," But that commercial office space is actually pretty small part of the overall investible universe"
"6790630","6791350"," for reads."
"6791770","6797990"," And then SPX with a three, one, two, three, three trigger bow cluster on SPX."
"6797990","6799470"," We have to refinance at much higher rates. "
"6800050","6800750"," But when we look out."
"6800870","6802250"," Three trigger bow cluster right now."
"6802450","6805090"," Still hasn't worked itself out to confirm it, but it is forming. "
"6805390","6812510"," A story here for not only the return and yield that they provide, but also for a better outlook in"
"6812510","6816930"," terms of fundamentals with rates coming down with the economy, so remaining relatively healthy"
"6816930","6817870"," sentiment."
"6818290","6823170"," As I mentioned, it's been really negative over a very small piece of the overall market here."
"6823810","6826210"," So we think there is opportunity in this part of the market. "
"6826470","6828670"," So you're saying it's more than a dividend dividend of four percent."
"6828850","6829590"," You're saying it's beyond that."
"6830070","6831150"," I think it's beyond that. "
"6831390","6835290"," You know, if we look at certainly, if we look at sentiment over the last year, it was not only"
"6835290","6840090"," the high interest rate environment, but also real legitimate concerns over commercial real estate,"
"6840090","6841130"," particularly in office."
"6841130","6845770"," But that office space, if you look at the broad universe, it's only about four percent."
"6846070","6847070"," So it's pretty tiny. "
"6847550","6852030"," It's not the reverse overall, but I think it's all been wrapped up with that concern."
"6852270","6856930"," Alright, Brenda's contrarian pick ticker, the NQ, coming up next year on half time."
"6857090","6861450"," Mike Santoli joins us with his midday word, and later we're going beyond the banks to set up on the"
"6861450","6863710"," two other key names reporting this week. "
"6863930","6865970"," Much more half time coming up right after this."
"7017200","7017640"," Now."
"7020360","7022680"," And we're back here on half time. "
"7022800","7025960"," Senior markets commentator Mike Santoli joins us now with his midday word."
"7026400","7027420"," Mike, take a look at the markets."
"7027420","7029340"," It's 10 minutes time now at the top of the hour. "
"7029480","7032680"," The US is due to sale $21 billion in 30-year bonds."
"7032860","7034060"," We're operating around the same zone."
"7034500","7037500"," S&P 4750 seems like a pretty popular spot. "
"7037740","7037980"," Excuse me."
"7038080","7042620"," The private couple is two spot four three, with the prior high yield of four spot three, four, four"
"7042620","7042900"," percent."
"7042900","7050100"," The reaction to the CPI data this morning from the ongoing process of a market trying to digest a"
"7050100","7051660"," massive two month rally. "
"7052020","7057920"," One pronounced pattern though in the last few days has been the way that the small caps, the banks,"
"7058200","7058700"," the sick."
"7058960","7063200"," So looking at an open JP Morgan, the strategist who you see, the auction is being well digested"
"7063200","7067400"," given the better macro backdrop and a recent backup in yields."
"7067940","7070500"," They are that the curve valuation creates a small head window. "
"7071540","7075000"," It's also known to be later CFTC positioning data ahead of the auction."
"7075520","7082040"," We show speculators net short 141,000 classic bond futures and net short 303,000 ultra bond"
"7082040","7085540"," futures, seen by analysts as a possible source of covering demand."
"7085760","7090440"," So I got your take on one of the big stories of today, the spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are take"
"7090440","7091340"," on the action we're seeing. "
"7092140","7097560"," I mean, to some degree, there was just such a buildup and just sort of a pile up at the"
"7097560","7103620"," starting gate that I'm not surprised you saw burst of enthusiasm and then a recognition that maybe"
"7103620","7105120"," nothing much has changed."
"7105120","7111120"," I don't see the real reason why new vehicles for owning something that wasn't terribly hard to own"
"7111120","7114520"," should be decisive in terms of the price curve longer term."
"7114780","7116180"," You know, you guys are talking about it. "
"7116260","7118720"," I remember when the gold and the oil ETFs came around."
"7118900","7120780"," I remember when the VIX futures ETFs came around."
"7121180","7127420"," So it doesn't necessarily mean it's all of a sudden a dawn of a new age for the asset class. "
"7127420","7130140"," But we'll see down 3000 from the morning high."
"7130740","7132460"," You know, Josh is saying you're hating Mike."
"7132480","7136780"," I just think you're giving your midday word and your keen insights, but Josh is calling you a"
"7136780","7137060"," hater. "
"7137340","7138460"," Mike's in talking with his mid-day word."
"7138660","7139580"," I'm sending it out."
"7139720","7140260"," Put it that way. "
"7141400","7142620"," Mike, thank you very much."
"7142740","7143600"," I don't think you're hating at all."
"7143900","7144160"," All right. "
"7144220","7147980"," Coming up here on halftime, the earnings set up beyond the banks, Delta and United Health, also on"
"7147980","7149740"," deck, how the committee is positioned."
"7149960","7150780"," That is coming up on halftime."
"7151160","7151580"," Stay with us. "
"7304990","7305870"," All right."
"7306010","7306490"," Welcome back to halftime."
"7306770","7308890"," It is not just the big banks reporting earnings tomorrow. "
"7309010","7310990"," We also hear from Delta, United Health."
"7311290","7312290"," So let's get the setup."
"7312550","7313830"," Jim, you own both of these. "
"7314030","7314730"," What do you watch them for?"
"7314910","7320310"," So Delta, back about six months ago in the middle of the summer, they did an investor day in which"
"7320310","7321830"," they predicted $7 a share."
"7322190","7324490"," $10.5 in his time now at the top of the hour."
"7324650","7328770"," U.S. is due to sell $21 billion in a 30-year bond sale. "
"7328770","7336350"," The prime bid to cover is $2.43 with a prior high yield of $4.34. Clearly the demand is"
"7336350","7336610"," there."
"7337430","7341290"," Obviously costs will play in, but jet fuel has been coming down with the price of crude oil."
"7341550","7346050"," So I think this sets up well for the street to kind of come around to the fact that Delta"
"7346050","7347470"," is doing a lot better than it expected. "
"7348090","7350710"," On United Health comes down to medical reimbursement costs."
"7351410","7352530"," Those have been trending higher."
"7353010","7356890"," There's some noise this week from CVS that their medical reimbursements have gone up a little bit. "
"7356890","7362090"," So you want to hear tomorrow what the projection is in 2024 for medical claim reimbursements."
"7362390","7363870"," All right, two things to watch right there."
"7364350","7365170"," Stay with us. "
"7365330","7366750"," Final iteration of the committee coming up."
"7366850","7367710"," Josh has already warned us."
"7367790","7370130"," He's not going to be hating, but he might take up all the time. "
"7370310","7371270"," Stay with us right here on Halftone."
"7375390","7377830"," Are you following the Halftime Report podcast?"
"7378550","7379470"," What are you waiting for?"
"7380090","7382050"," Look for us in your favorite podcasting app."
"7382490","7384250"," Follow the Halftime Podcast now. "
"7535750","7536210"," Confidence."
"7551680","7553700"," As you can see, markets are off their lows."
"7554140","7556060"," Welcome back to Halftime now for final trades. "
"7556280","7557620"," We're going to start things off with Josh."
"7557980","7558400"," You're up first."
"7558860","7560880"," Ladies and gentlemen, if you see it's here in my eye. "
"7561060","7563800"," Shortly expecting results from the 30-year bond sale."
"7564280","7567680"," The Treasury pre-sale winning studio comes out at the top of the hour."
"7568120","7570870"," Record high price above the February 2021. "
"7574840","7578100"," Goldman Sachs this morning came out, raised their target two months ago."
"7579720","7580940"," The street continues."
"7581540","7582420"," I remain long to stop. "
"7582800","7583400"," I still love it."
"7583540","7584160"," Frank back to you."
"7584300","7585320"," Alright, victory lap over. "
"7585440","7586380"," Brad, you're up next."
"7586800","7587240"," Uranium."
"7587460","7589620"," Uranium had a strong year in 2023. "
"7589720","7590760"," I think it would be another strong year."
"7591120","7592740"," It was a renaissance in nuclear energy."
"7593440","7595820"," Uranium owns both the physical as well as the miners. "
"7596320","7596600"," Brenda."
"7597460","7598160"," Abbott Labs."
"7598600","7601960"," The story has really been muddy down by COVID tests and fears of erosabic. "
"7602160","7604860"," But the underlying business is strong and I think that's going to be a focus this year."
"7605200","7605420"," Jim."
"7605420","7608180"," Vertex also sets an all-time high. "
"7608400","7610620"," This is a very good pharmaceutical biotech play."
"7611160","7613320"," Alright, as we mentioned, the markets are off their lows of earlier."
"7613580","7615540"," Right now, the Dow down about 150 points. "
"7616200","7619800"," The NASDAQ, the hardest hit out the group down almost three-quarters of 1%."
"7619800","7620860"," That's going to do it for us here on our top."
"7620860","7626180"," Treasury win issue 30-year yield for us, but 23% before the $21 billion auction. "
"7627760","7630240"," Thank you, Frank, and welcome to the exchange."
"7630760","7631340"," I'm Kelly Evans."
"7631640","7632220"," Here's what's ahead. "
"7632660","7633100"," CPI."
"7633440","7635400"," It did come in hotter than expected this morning."
"7635480","7636860"," Stocks are lower as a result. "
"7637140","7640600"," Could the first rate cut not come play as quickly as the market was hoping for?"
"7640800","7645580"," We'll talk about that, how to position from here and we'll hear from the White House in a bid on"
"7645580","7647140"," their plans to tackle all of it."
"7647440","7651840"," Plus, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong calls for Bitcoin and TF approval a great victory."
"7652460","7657100"," But our analyst calls it a parent one as best and says Coinbase is set for a big reality check. "
"7657460","7662040"," He joins us to make his case with the price of Bitcoin topping $49,000 today."
"7662040","7664240"," And a rapid rundown with rapid ratings."
"7665120","7670200"," The CEO joins us ahead with the name on his radar that could be headed for trouble and one that"
"7670200","7671080"," really impressed him. "
"7671360","7673320"," Before all that though, let's start with today's markets."
"7673660","7676460"," Dom Chiu has the numbers and weren't we briefly at highs?"
"7676720","7677400"," We were."
"7677740","7682720"," And just to give you an idea, it's been a fairly wide range today for the S&P 500, which"
"7682720","7691480"," currently stands at $47.57. At the highs of the session, we were pushing $47.98 and down towards"
"7691480","7694740"," $47.39 at the lows of the session. "
"7694960","7699580"," So again, off of the lows, but well off the highs that we saw after we tried to make a"
"7699580","7700960"," run above the $4800 mark."
"7701060","7702780"," So we're off one half of 1% so far today."
"7703220","7709480"," A similar percentage decline of the Dow industrial is down about 145 points, $37,549 and the NASDAQ"
"7709480","7716180"," composite underperforming a bit down about two thirds of 1%, 93 points of the downside, $14,876. "
"7716180","7721480"," One of the big focal points has been the mega cap technology, that so-called magnificent seven"
"7721480","7721800"," trade."
"7722040","7724640"," Well, we have seen some pretty interesting swings."

"7822360","7824820"," The question is whether the markets are indeed listening."

"7827420","7831940"," Yes, inflation is probably still cooling, but no, it doesn't happen in a straight line. "

"7942120","7942800"," Hold on a second here. "
"7942800","7944280"," That was extremely loud."
"7945940","7946820"," Is that just me?"
"7946900","7949160"," Can you get was that was that really loud?"
"7949980","7953340"," Okay, so you get this squeeze right here."
"7953460","7954460"," This could go all the way up here. "
"7954460","7955700"," It's possibly go all the way up there."
"7957060","7961400"," But regardless, the point of this this point right here."
"7962480","7965540"," If this is just right here or if it's up here, it doesn't matter. "
"7965920","7970240"," Expect a rejection initial rejection off of this thing right here."
"7971680","7972740"," Let's take a look at it."
"7973620","7975140"," I know this could squeeze all the way. "
"7975200","7978740"," It doesn't have to technically reverse, but even if it does or doesn't, it doesn't really matter."
"7978900","7982460"," What really matters is this point right here."
"7984540","7987200"," We'll get bought to break above. "
"7987680","7997680"," Okay, so regardless of regardless if we squeeze here and slap into that, expect that pullback, and"
"7997680","7999960"," then look for that next slam above."
"8000880","8007140"," Now, there's a possibility to that you could slam up a slam above here just directly and get above"
"8007140","8008820"," it and then start consolidating here."
"8008820","8014340"," But if it does do this, you'll still likely see a liquidation break down here. "
"8015120","8016560"," So just be aware of that."
"8016720","8019280"," If it does, it goes straight north and blasted to the upside."
"8020320","8022760"," So this is bullish reversal here. "
"8023100","8024480"," Has not been confirmed though."
"8025440","8027960"," So you've got the bullish reversal here, right?"
"8028940","8030120"," This is nice to see."
"8030220","8031420"," You've got a bull cross right here. "
"8032340","8033220"," That's all good to see."
"8034420","8035600"," But it hasn't been confirmed."
"8035600","8042580"," To get it confirmed, you need to see to get a confirmation of a bullish reversal. "
"8043640","8047200"," You need to see the price action come up down, up down, right?"
"8047780","8053480"," And then break above to right about there and come back and test and hold this."
"8054600","8061520"," Okay, if this holds and breaks above and beats this new high right here, that's the confirmation of"
"8061520","8062340"," a bullish reversal."
"8062340","8064920"," That's where you get your confirmation right there, okay?"
"8065700","8066660"," So trade. "
"8067080","8071560"," If you're a bull, you have to be a tactician in here until that happens."
"8072120","8074600"," And I was speaking about this earlier and didn't say it."
"8075000","8079200"," I meant to say it, but I didn't come back to it, which I was trying to explain on how"
"8079200","8083680"," we trade here, which is you'll always find someone. "
"8085120","8089380"," Either on fin twit or well street bets, stock twits doesn't matter."
"8090040","8095320"," You'll always find someone that's like, hey, I bought this and I won the prices up here now, right?"
"8097260","8098960"," And they're like, look at how awesome I am."
"8099120","8099960"," I timed it perfectly. "
"8100900","8106940"," I want you out there to understand that this whole thing right here."
"8108020","8109240"," Bull or bear, it doesn't matter."
"8109340","8110340"," This whole thing right here. "
"8112680","8114460"," Oftentimes goes against you."
"8114460","8121020"," Like right here, it's about about 60% of the time, 30% of the time, 15% of the"
"8121020","8122620"," time, and then 5% of the time."
"8123340","8128880"," So your win ratio goes up the more that you wait for this to work itself out. "
"8129900","8133260"," Now, when the trade goes against you in here and we start rolling down, right?"
"8133640","8134980"," Those people actually disappear."
"8136140","8137700"," They like leave social media."
"8138540","8141220"," They don't brag, okay?"
"8141220","8144340"," So they might brag when we're up here, but they don't brag in here. "
"8144780","8148220"," But the other thing that they don't tell you is how many times they've lost."
"8148760","8151740"," And I can assure you they've lost buying this."
"8152080","8154880"," They've lost about 60% of their trades. "
"8157080","8158480"," Literally 60%, okay?"
"8158980","8159460"," 60%."
"8159460","8162180"," So my point here, this is what I was talking about earlier."
"8162480","8164140"," The reason I was talking about that is because of this. "
"8164520","8168360"," So the point about this structure right here, this is upside."
"8168760","8170240"," You can put this over the same thing."
"8170800","8171200"," Okay?"
"8171600","8175660"," Is the reason that you wait for this to happen and while you're waiting for the confirmation above"
"8175660","8184000"," or below if this was in the inverse is because of the time that you spend above here normally in"
"8184000","8187440"," profit and making great money in the length of time. "
"8187560","8189160"," So we're going to look at that right now really quick."
"8190020","8191799"," So we're going to go to the trigger screen right here."
"8192920","8196000"," And I'm going to go to a 30 minute chart. "
"8196580","8197059"," Okay?"
"8197379","8199559"," And I'm going to explain this better for you."
"8201080","8204360"," So when we talk about getting into early, okay?"
"8205059","8210840"," And where the real meat of the trade is, you can see the you see that hourly trigger right here."
"8211219","8212180"," It's where the early trigger is. "
"8212180","8212420"," Okay?"
"8213240","8215100"," And you're trying to time this right here, right?"
"8215799","8220320"," The truth is you need to be above this so you can get a really nice trade in there."
"8220320","8225240"," Now we are limited somewhat by the 4800 right now in this market right here today."
"8225240","8228280"," That's kind of where we're limited to normally we're not so normally even higher. "
"8228520","8234000"," But the reason I'm saying that is because you see how like price goes down gets rejected on that"
"8234000","8235100"," hourly trigger right?"
"8235420","8236860"," We haven't gotten to the hourly trigger heavily."
"8237780","8241680"," We get up there and we keep we're now we're now again aggressive on the half hour trigger to the"
"8241680","8241940"," downside."
"8242240","8242900"," We test it again. "
"8243040","8245059"," We go way back down again, right?"
"8245280","8249440"," It's like loser loser loser bull loser bull loser bull loser bull loser bull."
"8249440","8250020"," Get what I'm saying?"
"8251520","8254879"," Now if you get above that hourly trigger right you get above it."
"8254879","8257000"," And you have a successful retest. "
"8257500","8260379"," So even right here, let's look at this one example right here."
"8260400","8261120"," We get above it, right?"
"8262379","8267540"," It's a successful retest would be a bounce and then beating the previous high back here."
"8268240","8269440"," That didn't happen, did it?"
"8270299","8273959"," But that's my point here is you beat the previous high come back down and boom. "
"8274299","8276820"," Once you do that, you're in long right there and you're off and running."
"8277040","8277600"," Okay, to the upside."
"8278780","8279980"," Here's another example right here. "
"8280719","8284240"," So let's say, remember when I said I'm getting all bulged up on fin, twin stuff."
"8284500","8287700"," That was actually right there at eight thirty or nine thirty in the morning, right?"
"8289360","8295000"," So even if you miss this whole entire trade, it still came back down and confirmed."
"8296139","8300160"," The next leg of that trade right here and you didn't miss the big pull. "
"8300420","8303620"," And then you're trading off that hourly trigger, right?"
"8303820","8305799"," So there's the meat of the trade right there."
"8305799","8308200"," And it's already been confirmed down here."
"8308719","8311760"," So just looking at where we are right now as a bull. "
"8312680","8314920"," The same thing applies here for bulls."
"8315200","8316320"," Same thing applies here for bears."
"8317040","8319400"," So even right now where we are, let's take a look at it, right?"
"8319959","8321920"," There's a thirty minute chart right here, right?"
"8322920","8326240"," Then we're just starting to get a reversal right now, right?"
"8326400","8328980"," But it isn't confirmed yet, is it?"
"8328980","8330139"," That's before the pandemic. "
"8330139","8330440"," Right."
"8330459","8330840"," It's not confirmed."
"8331360","8331920"," So what can we do?"
"8332100","8332740"," What can happen here?"
"8333459","8336580"," There's a higher, there's not a high, but it's about thirty percent probability that we actually"
"8336580","8338440"," come up here and reject to the downside. "
"8339780","8340180"," Okay."
"8340180","8344559"," So if you want like that, if you want that like, hey, cap, when can I buy a bottom, that"
"8344559","8345340"," question, right?"
"8346440","8350459"," Don't have that like, don't have that like, oh, this, we, cap, but we squeezed."
"8351580","8356820"," And cap, we went up for the next five days and be like, I missed all that cap down there. "
"8357480","8363799"," Well, you can take small trades in here to participate, but you're like, are we reversing to the"
"8363799","8364959"," upside or to the downside?"
"8366120","8367020"," You wait for the confirmation."
"8368059","8371480"," You wait for the squeeze, you come back down, you confirm it as soon as you come up here."
"8371860","8372559"," You're long here. "
"8372760","8374400"," It makes sense and you're taking that free money."
"8374879","8379480"," If you do that shit ten times, then a hundred times and a thousand times, the way that I'm telling"
"8379480","8382080"," you to do it, you're going to be a successful trader."
"8382940","8388640"," If you're a person out there that's trying to time bottoms and tops, without these tools, I assure"
"8388640","8390680"," you that you're a loser over time. "
"8390840","8392260"," I assure you the fact, speak it."
"8392260","8397540"," That's why we only have three percent of traders, literally three percent of investors and traders"
"8397540","8405100"," that are successful in a career because they are using tools like this and rules like this in there"
"8405100","8406200"," investing in trading."
"8406640","8408160"," This applies on every time frame. "
"8408580","8411140"," It supplies on a daily time frame, a weekly time frame."
"8411580","8414120"," It applies on a one minute time frame, five minute time frame."
"8414460","8419700"," When you hear people out there talking about de-gens trading zero dates, they don't know what the"
"8419700","8420720"," fuck they're talking about. "
"8421540","8424890"," Because these rules apply on every time frame."
"8425900","8427240"," They're out of their fucking minds."
"8427660","8428560"," They don't know what they're talking about. "
"8431020","8435040"," My point here is that these tools apply in every time frame."
"8435540","8438080"," These rules apply in a one minute, five minute time frame."
"8438200","8439260"," They apply in an hourly time frame. "
"8439360","8441340"," They apply in a daily time frame, half hour time frame."
"8442160","8448080"," If you want to participate down here, you're more than welcome to on smaller like zero dates, one"
"8448080","8448320"," dates."
"8448780","8450940"," When you come up here, you can do zero dates, one dates. "
"8451200","8457120"," If you get a confirmation on a trend reversal the upside, you can switch to weekly calls or monthly"
"8457120","8457780"," calls."
"8458440","8460400"," Now we know the gamma walls up here."
"8461200","8463780"," So we know we probably can't get a weekly or monthly or can we?"
"8464680","8470660"," You likely got to stick with one dates, zero dates, maybe a weekly if you only want to make ten"
"8470660","8474460"," percent, but I don't think it matters on this small of a scale with this roof right here. "
"8474460","8479920"," If you want to get really long in the market, what do you need to buy a monthly or something?"
"8480180","8480680"," You need all this."
"8481360","8485480"," You need the confirmation with the new high, but then you need to be above and you need to see"
"8486780","8491820"," the four being built here to take a monthly or a three month to go up from here."
"8491940","8492700"," Does that make sense to you?"
"8493480","8495660"," So more than likely this is all day trading stuff. "
"8496140","8500580"," As we pin this upside move to 4800 and the weekend is over."
"8500940","8501400"," Does that make sense?"
"8501620","8502800"," Hopefully this makes sense to you guys."
"8502800","8507060"," So even right now where we are, we're not bullish yet, are we?"
"8507680","8509140"," Make sure you tell yourself that. "
"8509260","8509500"," We're not."
"8509960","8512640"," I can show you an example after example where people thought they were bullish."
"8513160","8513820"," There's one right here. "
"8514220","8515340"," Yeah, we're bullish right here."
"8515420","8515960"," Fuck you."
"8515980","8516680"," Don't know what you're talking about. "
"8516760","8517820"," Yeah, we'll fuck you."
"8518000","8519560"," You're in a monthly or a three month call."
"8519780","8521560"," There was some kind of nonsense over here. "
"8521720","8523380"," You're like down here."
"8523520","8524000"," I'm doing it."
"8524020","8524500"," I'm doing it. "
"8524760","8525360"," I'm doing it."
"8525360","8525720"," I'm doing it."
"8525840","8527180"," The non-degen way cap. "
"8527980","8529080"," You fucking liar."
"8529420","8532340"," You didn't wait until we got above the hourly trigger to put that trade on."
"8532340","8533900"," That one month of that three month on. "
"8534100","8537200"," You didn't get the back confirmation and the beat of the previous eye over here."
"8537700","8540000"," I assure you, this stuff is all back testable."
"8540020","8547340"," As a matter of fact, Jedi Marcus runs a similar program, but only he runs it on a, I think"
"8547340","8553660"," he runs it on a 21 or a 27 EMA or something like that and on a one in five"
"8553660","8555040"," minute basis or something like that. "
"8555680","8557640"," And some guys came out and back tested him on it."
"8557640","8562980"," And he's proven that you're a winner if you follow tools like that or similar, like the tools that"
"8562980","8564580"," we use here to be a better trader."
"8565660","8568460"," So at least right now, so we're scaling out right now. "
"8568580","8570580"," We're right pulled back to a 30 minute basis."
"8570860","8573240"," We're not going to go back to this one minute basis right here."
"8574260","8576780"," Right now we're underneath the microscope right here, right?"
"8576920","8579340"," 76 counterparties take 620. "
"8579940","8581460"," We're on the microscope right here, right?"
"8581660","8583440"," And so what are you thinking in your brain?"
"8583600","8584820"," I want you to think about this right now."
"8584820","8586760"," Okay, Cap, I took some longs in here."
"8587320","8588340"," I'm fucking making money. "
"8588540","8589280"," Everything's fucking awesome."
"8589800","8591240"," What do you do right here?"
"8592840","8596680"," Statistically, you take the money and fucking run right here."
"8598140","8600700"," Statistically, you don't care about this last little push. "
"8601200","8606980"," You don't care if it rolls down and you're actually just looking for whether it pulls back and goes"
"8606980","8610480"," up later or it goes up here and does this."
"8610920","8612300"," You're waiting for the next trade."
"8612300","8616740"," You're waiting for that one minute to come up, that five minute to come up, that confirmation on"
"8616740","8619660"," the hourly trigger and chase that next leg to the upside. "
"8620780","8622460"," Okay, so just be patient here."
"8623120","8626780"," If you're a bull and you're being tactful taking trades in here, awesome to you."
"8627080","8632500"," But remember, I just showed you a 30 minute basis where oftentimes there will be a downside"
"8632500","8633420"," reversal here. "
"8633820","8640320"," I'm going to tell you for sure that there is a gang of fucking bears sitting here that want to"
"8640320","8641100"," sell this down."
"8641100","8647740"," Now, if you're a seller, if you're a seller, what do you do here?"
"8649440","8649680"," Right?"
"8649960","8651480"," You're Johnny on the spot."
"8651680","8654580"," You're like, come to daddy so I can short this. "
"8655600","8655880"," Right?"
"8656400","8658380"," So, let's say price starts heading up here."
"8658500","8659060"," Boom, right?"
"8659920","8664760"," You're going to come in as a seller and your expectation here is that it's going to come down."
"8666000","8667060"," You're already in the money. "
"8668440","8672040"," Now, let's say the bulls are, there's more buyers than sellers."
"8673200","8675180"," And it's going to still go up and squeeze you out."
"8675680","8676780"," Well, first you're up. "
"8677640","8683840"," The next thing is that your next squeeze is going to go to there and it's going to pull back"
"8683840","8684920"," again, believe it or not."
"8685260","8689660"," So, if you ever get fucked up in here, let's say you're short here and you're like, yeah, I'm"
"8689660","8691100"," making money cap, everything's fucking awesome."
"8691100","8692000"," And you didn't close. "
"8693560","8694000"," Right?"
"8694240","8694620"," You didn't close."
"8695300","8696580"," Like, fuck that cap."
"8696880","8697940"," It's going to blood down on everything. "
"8698260","8699580"," It bounces back on you."
"8700360","8703420"," You don't eat that fucking short or those puts right there."
"8703500","8704800"," You wait until it comes back down. "
"8704980","8708020"," Then you get out of your puts down here and let the bulls do their thing."
"8708140","8708740"," Does that make sense?"
"8709520","8711900"," So, there's also a right time where your stops are."
"8712360","8716860"," So, let's say you're a bear and you're like, okay, I'm going to take my short right here. "
"8719590","8721230"," I'm going to take my short right there, right?"
"8721790","8722450"," All right."
"8723290","8726230"," And all of a sudden, you're in pain up here."
"8727470","8729430"," And you know what most people do?"
"8730130","8731690"," They close that fucking shit up there. "
"8732670","8733450"," What do they do?"
"8733550","8734190"," They get this panicky."
"8734990","8739710"," When in reality, you likely have another chance to come back down here and actually exit that short"
"8739710","8742330"," like a fucking professional."
"8743690","8745630"," You let the bulls do their thing over there. "
"8745890","8750170"," Now, you might have lost a few bucks in here or whatever, but what you're doing is managing your"
"8750170","8750470"," trade."
"8750510","8751250"," You have a plan."
"8751890","8753730"," You know where you think price is going. "
"8753950","8755150"," You know if it goes against you."
"8755750","8759910"," Like even if you think it's going down here, you know that if it goes against you, where you exit,"
"8760490","8764010"," you should be thinking these trades out before they ever happen."
"8765410","8766650"," You understand what I'm saying here?"
"8767090","8771690"," So, if you're a bear, if you're a seller, as we come up here, we're going to start being rejected"
"8771690","8772150"," a little bit. "
"8772350","8776570"," But the other point here, so if you're every trade you're entering, what I just said to the past"
"8776570","8780830"," five minutes, you should be thinking about all this stuff."
"8780830","8781770"," Am I taking a monthly?"
"8781950","8782750"," Am I taking a three month?"
"8782910","8783510"," Where's the ceiling?"
"8784070","8784770"," Is there a wall?"
"8784970","8785610"," Is there no wall?"
"8785730","8786130"," Where's the bottom?"
"8786910","8787590"," Where's the bottom?"
"8787890","8788250"," Right?"
"8789450","8790050"," Where's the bottom?"
"8790510","8791030"," Get on a flip."
"8791290","8792390"," This is where bulls buy right here. "
"8792750","8794410"," Until we flip, we become bears down here."
"8794790","8795810"," Where bulls stay here still."
"8796030","8796230"," Get it?"
"8797070","8797150"," Right?"
"8797730","8800170"," And even if this stuff is happening here, where is the wall?"
"8800350","8801390"," Right now, it's at 4800. "
"8801530","8802310"," It's not that high, is it?"
"8803010","8803710"," It's right fucking here."
"8804010","8804650"," Somewhere up in here."
"8805530","8806890"," So, there's not a lot of room to run. "
"8808130","8810930"," So you're likely trading zero dates, one dates, and a weekly at most."
"8812070","8812310"," Right?"
"8813210","8815910"," For at least where we are with the gamma picture of the upside right now."
"8816490","8816690"," Right?"
"8817670","8821190"," So, if you're a seller in here, you got to think about when it goes against you. "
"8821450","8825070"," Be thinking about your entire plan is my point."
"8826050","8826790"," What am I going to use?"
"8827050","8828010"," Which product am I going to use?"
"8828750","8832890"," If it goes against me, where am I actually going to get squeezed out in too much pain for me?"
"8833070","8834990"," Is it ever going to come back down where I can just be patient?"
"8834990","8837170"," The trade goes against me, where do I exit?"
"8838250","8839950"," Every once in a while, it won't come back."
"8840110","8843030"," Every once in a while, you will get squeezed out. "
"8843350","8843610"," Hold on."
"8845250","8846930"," You will get, I won't do that."
"8847050","8847990"," I'll do like something like this. "
"8848430","8849150"," You do this, right?"
"8849450","8850010"," Come back down."
"8850350","8850710"," Aw shit."
"8851510","8851950"," I'm in the money. "
"8852110","8852650"," Everything's awesome."
"8852950","8853230"," Whoa!"
"8853570","8856610"," I just got fucked over here or whatever."
"8857550","8859170"," And I'm panicking now. "
"8859350","8861750"," But I'm waiting for this comeback down here, but it doesn't come back."
"8861950","8862050"," Right?"
"8862850","8863530"," It doesn't come back."
"8864110","8864470"," Right?"
"8864750","8865970"," But how often does that happen?"
"8867290","8868330"," Five percent of the time. "
"8868370","8870610"," One percent of the time that it doesn't come back."
"8871170","8874670"," Now if it doesn't come back, you go back to this one right here."
"8875210","8875270"," Right?"
"8875450","8876450"," It's like, yeah, you know what?"
"8877210","8878210"," We're not even coming back. "
"8878310","8879310"," We're just going to go straight here."
"8879530","8882630"," Let's say for God to close down here and start going against up here."
"8882830","8885850"," You already know you're going to get fucked so you cut it anywhere in here and you take the L."
"8886870","8890590"," But your L's should be rare and should be managed. "
"8891090","8892410"," There should be no."
"8892890","8893450"," Oh yeah."
"8893590","8894550"," I'm in puts down here. "
"8894590","8895670"," I bought some puts right here."
"8895750","8896110"," Cap."
"8896830","8897230"," Right?"
"8897810","8898670"," I'm in the money with my puts. "
"8898870","8899370"," Now they're up here."
"8899470","8901490"," And now I got another chance and I didn't close them."
"8901890","8902610"," Does that make sense?"
"8903170","8904090"," You should be closing there. "
"8904270","8907330"," There should be no you unfucking fin twit going."
"8908450","8909470"," I'm long puts."
"8909690","8911390"," They're getting destroyed as the market's going higher. "
"8911710","8912730"," I hope it turns around."
"8913470","8914590"," Like don't be doing that shit."
"8916250","8918670"," That's bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. "
"8919350","8922050"," You should be planning your trade out before it happens."
"8922390","8924150"," Know the risks if it doesn't roll down."
"8924370","8925170"," Same thing on the upside. "
"8926050","8926910"," Where's my exposure?"
"8927290","8928730"," Where's the bad touchy?"
"8929150","8929990"," Where do I cut my losses?"
"8930290","8933590"," We'll be getting one chance to get out again where I originally started."
"8933970","8937310"," Even if you bought a put for I don't know 50 cents and it's here."
"8937470","8938410"," It's only worth 30. "
"8939290","8941990"," Yeah, you didn't collect your 50, but you at least got out of 30."
"8942730","8943990"," You live to trade another day."
"8947310","8948450"," You know what I'm saying here?"
"8961800","8963900"," I don't care about the violation of pivots. "
"8964860","8965600"," I'll be honest."
"8966460","8968100"," I rarely use them."
"8968500","8969940"," I shouldn't say I don't care. "
"8970120","8971820"," I shouldn't say I don't care about them."
"8972120","8973000"," Here's what I care about."
"8973560","8974340"," I care about gamma. "
"8975200","8976140"," Well, I care about triggers."
"8976780","8978000"," Let me tell you why I care about triggers."
"8978240","8986780"," I care about triggers because these are Elliott waves, fractals that institutions use all the way"
"8986780","8987940"," back to the 1890s. "
"8987940","8993680"," You can actually track the bottoms of crashes with this stuff."
"8994320","9001360"," You can actually see a divergence in momentum and where the big crashes are going to happen."
"9002340","9007080"," Our price is careening higher and velocity is just dropping on higher timeframes. "
"9008240","9012600"," I already know that's happening with funds."
"9013620","9015760"," Now, I also respect gamma."
"9016040","9017520"," That would be the next respect that I have, gamma. "
"9018540","9022860"," For ceilings, expectations, or bottoms, that kind of stuff, right?"
"9023500","9025940"," So if we're going down and looking for a bottom, I use gamma."
"9026400","9028340"," We're going up and looking for a top, it's gamma."
"9029180","9033060"," Now, then I care about, after that, I care about pivots. "
"9033900","9035160"," That's where you get in the nitty gritty."
"9035680","9036320"," That does matter."
"9036880","9040640"," Like pivot one, pivot one, support one, our two, our three, whatever fuck you're looking at. "
"9040640","9046620"," I care about those because I know in intraday trading, weekly trading, monthly trading, yearly"
"9046620","9050640"," trading, there are algorithms that are going back to hit those pivots."
"9051220","9052380"," So that does matter to me."
"9052860","9055220"," But do I have this overall thesis?"
"9055900","9057920"," We violated S1 or R2. "
"9058200","9058600"," I don't."
"9058760","9060360"," I used to, but I don't anymore."
"9061080","9062360"," But I do care about them. "
"9062720","9065860"," I do care about these pivots, these previous pivots on a daily basis."
"9066480","9068080"," Intraday daily pivots I care about."
"9068860","9070320"," We're talking about those right now. "
"9070480","9072140"," These are the intraday daily pivots."
"9072260","9072680"," You want to see them?"
"9073660","9076100"," So I give you every morning, you get a pivot, right?"
"9076240","9077000"," That's a daily pivot."
"9077540","9078640"," Then you have an intraday pivot. "
"9078940","9079540"," There's one right here."
"9080560","9081540"," There's one right here."
"9082880","9083900"," And they're not levels. "
"9084740","9085480"," One right there."
"9085940","9086920"," There's another one right here."
"9088200","9091600"," Then you have weekly pivots, monthly pivots, all that kind of stuff, right?"
"9092440","9093120"," You got another one right there. "
"9093240","9094140"," You got another one right over here."
"9096880","9098600"," These are all intraday pivots."
"9099080","9101920"," So you have to keep a mental note of those, right?"
"9102280","9105160"," And then I keep a mental note of weekly and monthly pivots. "
"9108300","9110300"," So you have to have a mental note about that stuff."
"9110620","9115980"," They're important because they're areas of interest for algorithms to go to."
"9116680","9117880"," And they do have meaning. "
"9118660","9120780"," If you have a new low, new high, do we fail?"
"9121600","9122720"," Do you know what the meaning is?"
"9122720","9125720"," I'll explain it easily to you right now, simply to you right now."
"9127520","9129000"," What meaning they have."
"9129960","9133220"," The real importance here is the will of buyers or sellers. "
"9133860","9137900"," So the next pivot here, you got this pivot right here, right?"
"9138020","9138340"," There's one."
"9140100","9141560"," And you got one more up here."
"9142740","9148480"," And the idea here is that in this case, are the buyers stronger than the sellers?"
"9148480","9154040"," If the buyers are weaker than the sellers, they will not go higher than that pivot. "
"9154580","9156320"," If they're stronger than the buyers, they will."
"9156620","9157500"," Even just the tip."
"9158140","9158860"," A little tight tip. "
"9159600","9160600"," A little tight tip."
"9160840","9162100"," That shows strength in buyers."
"9163160","9164160"," Same thing for sellers. "
"9165420","9170460"," If sellers can get their tip down below these pivots, it means that selling is strong."
"9171680","9172600"," So let's look at that."
"9172600","9178000"," On an interesting basis, did sellers get down into that gamma flip?"
"9178520","9178820"," Nope. "
"9179400","9180600"," Do they tip their wick down here?"
"9180780","9181360"," No, they did not."
"9181760","9182880"," Do they have a chance at it?"
"9183060","9184020"," Fuck yeah, they do right here."
"9184360","9188340"," You get one more chance right now to get that tip down there. "
"9188580","9192840"," Now, if they fail this right here, what do you assume at that point?"
"9193520","9201940"," If a seller can't reverse this for a new low below the gamma flip right now, if they can't reverse"
"9201940","9203620"," this down, who's stronger?"
"9205060","9206020"," The buyer or the seller?"
"9206680","9207740"," I'll answer it for you."
"9208200","9208920"," The buyers are."
"9209280","9215000"," Now, if the buyers are stronger than the sellers here, what would be the expectation for a target?"
"9215780","9217480"," It's a new fucking high, man, over here. "
"9218580","9219740"," A new fucking high up in here."
"9221380","9223840"," So you're going to pay attention to this very closely."
"9224280","9226380"," So it's a complex question. "
"9226660","9228140"," Someone was asking about pivots and do they matter?"
"9228360","9228660"," They do."
"9229340","9229920"," They do."
"9230020","9231420"," And you have to calculate that in your day. "
"9231600","9236400"," You have to, at some point as a trader or as an investor, it'll come easy to you."
"9236560","9240600"," I'm going to tell you, if you don't, if I'm not making any sense to you right now, I want"
"9240600","9244540"," you to know that time and market cannot be replaced."
"9245320","9248620"," Hanging out with me every day cannot be replaced. "
"9248920","9250060"," That's not an ego statement."
"9250900","9251980"," I'm telling you for the truth."
"9252560","9256800"," You hang out with a guy that trades every day or a girl that trades every day. "
"9256800","9263660"," Over time and market, you will eventually, that your brain will just start thinking about this"
"9263660","9266100"," stuff and calculate it in your own mind."
"9266740","9269020"," Bullish, bearish, bullish, bearish, bullish, bearish."
"9269560","9272480"," More buyers, more sellers, very simple to see. "
"9277770","9279930"," Yeah, I have some price action."
"9280530","9282790"," I might buy us on CPI print."
"9283730","9286490"," What did the CPI print mean this morning?"
"9287110","9287990"," This is my thesis. "
"9289850","9294370"," So coming into the CPI print, I wanted a hot print."
"9295490","9296930"," Now I got yelled at for that too."
"9297850","9299430"," And I'm like, they're like, why do you want a hot print?"
"9299590","9307010"," I'm like, I want a fucking hot print because I want to see inflation, no velocity inflation going"
"9307010","9308250"," down or up. "
"9308630","9311870"," So I want to see like a hot print, a cool print, a hot print, a cool print."
"9312330","9317610"," I want to see prints that are right around that 3.2, 3.3, 3.1. I want to see"
"9317610","9317810"," that."
"9318230","9318750"," Why?"
"9319690","9321430"," Because I know rate cuts aren't coming. "
"9322390","9323990"," I know it's a Goldilocks zone."
"9324870","9326590"," So we got a hot print this morning."
"9327050","9330050"," So my first thought to myself this morning is what?"
"9330990","9335150"," Well, these fucking bears aren't getting the crash that they want. "
"9336050","9338710"," They're not getting their 30% again."
"9339930","9341110"," And they're going to try again."
"9341110","9346810"," They're going to tell you, you're going to see a campaign by the bond vigilantes. "
"9348030","9348470"," Not them."
"9350310","9351170"," They will actually do it."
"9352150","9356610"," But I mean like retail or like some professional or something that doesn't have a lot of money. "
"9358150","9362030"," You don't see a campaign of expect, you know, we're going to get rate cuts at this next rate"
"9362030","9362690"," decision meeting."
"9363030","9367890"," That's your next problem as a bull in the volatility that comes with that."
"9367890","9373350"," But as long as this keeps happening like this, you know, I really want the next CPI print to be"
"9373350","9374710"," slightly cool. "
"9375210","9377270"," To be honest with you, I want to be slightly cool."
"9377490","9377970"," Not super cool."
"9378750","9379490"," Just slightly cool. "
"9380110","9381730"," And that's that Goldilocks zone, right?"
"9382350","9384330"," So my thesis was good."
"9384670","9385610"," It worked out this morning."
"9385890","9386430"," Got a hot print. "
"9386990","9388030"," Just slightly hot, right?"
"9388570","9389230"," Not crazy hot."
"9389670","9390070"," Just slightly."
"9390730","9394610"," It was perfect manipulation by the Treasury Department and the Fed. "
"9395310","9396750"," So right now I'm stoked."
"9397230","9397610"," I'm a bull."
"9398150","9400250"," I know this market has a bottom. "
"9400710","9402730"," I know this market's not going down 30%."
"9403130","9403590"," It could."
"9404110","9405690"," What could take it to 30%. "
"9405690","9406250"," Do you know?"
"9406730","9406950"," I know."
"9408190","9409150"," Unknown news."
"9409910","9412790"," And I don't mean like, oh, we're starting with the Houthis. "
"9412890","9413790"," We know about that."
"9414250","9418590"," I already know that that J.S. has offices in Ukraine."
"9419030","9420490"," I know they have offices in Russia. "
"9420950","9422310"," I know they have offices in China."
"9422670","9423670"," I know they have offices in Taiwan."
"9423670","9425110"," I know they have offices in Japan. "
"9425410","9427030"," I know they have offices fucking anywhere they can."
"9427150","9429770"," They probably have insiders in Iran."
"9430370","9431170"," They're like the CIA. "
"9431730","9433850"," So if they know about this stuff, no big deal."
"9434450","9435830"," It's always unknown news."
"9436490","9439630"," That would be like an unknown terrorist attack, right?"
"9439950","9441250"," Something blows up in the United States. "
"9441730","9442790"," You're fucked if you're a bull."
"9442890","9445970"," If that happens, that happens every three to five years."
"9446310","9451170"," Edge funds by insurance for when those things happen because they don't have the inside"
"9451170","9452870"," information, right?"
"9452870","9454110"," Do you guys know that?"
"9454830","9455190"," Okay. "
"9455510","9456470"," So you've got that on your side."
"9456490","9459090"," If you're a bear from this morning, CPI print alone."
"9459970","9463450"," You need unknown event to get your crash. "
"9464350","9465350"," Number two, you need."
"9466250","9468970"," Fed comes out and starts cutting rates unknown."
"9469770","9470390"," Didn't leak. "
"9470950","9471410"," No, that stuff."
"9471970","9472610"," That would help you."
"9472710","9476050"," You get your 30% down move bloodbath 50% where fuck you want. "
"9476910","9478730"," So I know right now you're not getting it."
"9479310","9481890"," So I know one thing."
"9481890","9483130"," The market is bullish. "
"9484390","9485610"," All pullbacks we bought."
"9486350","9488070"," Markets should act normal."
"9488970","9492650"," That means normal pullbacks, normal corrective phases, no crashes. "
"9493490","9493930"," I know that."
"9494570","9495270"," So I'm like, woo."
"9496370","9496870"," Right?"
"9497490","9500830"," Now the other thing that take away from CPI print today is what?"
"9501490","9506590"," If I'm expecting a hot CPI print, I'm going to expect the market to be weak afterwards. "
"9507210","9507810"," But how weak?"
"9508230","9508990"," Not crash week."
"9509490","9509790"," Sorry."
"9510150","9510690"," You ain't getting that. "
"9511170","9511850"," Makes sense."
"9511850","9516910"," Just normal pullbacks, normal pullbacks in the market."
"9517110","9517450"," Does it make sense?"
"9518210","9520430"," It's a little bit of bearishness of hot print. "
"9521090","9524130"," Now let's say today's print came in super cool."
"9524930","9526150"," That's velocity, right?"
"9526570","9527990"," In inflation going down."
"9528890","9529310"," That's bad. "
"9530910","9533370"," So let's say this morning we got a super cool print."
"9534110","9534670"," I'd be fearful."
"9536750","9538390"," And the market would do what?"
"9538390","9541530"," The market would have squeezed higher to $4,800. "
"9542390","9547310"," And if there was real panic behind the scenes, we'd likely start squeezing."
"9547770","9552330"," And if next month's CPI print came in really, really cool, we start squeezing up even higher and"
"9552330","9552770"," higher and higher."
"9553390","9554890"," You know what I'd be planning on at that point?"
"9555830","9556210"," And publicly. "
"9557070","9559250"," When do we short this fucker down 50%?"
"9560850","9562550"," Like where do we just take it right now?"
"9562830","9563530"," I can, probably can."
"9563890","9568670"," Probably just put a fucking put on and I don't care about the upside."
"9569130","9574270"," And meanwhile you're going to have a bunch of people on Twitter going, we got a cool CPI print cap. "
"9574430","9575490"," Why are you bearish?"
"9576190","9581070"," So if you're a bear and you're like, why is cap saying all this stuff doesn't make any fucking"
"9581070","9581470"," sense?"
"9581950","9583410"," We're just talking out of two sides of his mouth."
"9584350","9586630"," Just imagine if it was a very cool print."
"9587270","9589150"," I would be extremely bearish today. "
"9590230","9591850"," Even though the market is going up."
"9592570","9593170"," Does that make sense?"
"9593530","9594670"," It might not make sense to you."
"9595670","9596070"," Right?"
"9596070","9597550"," It'd be like, oh fuck, we're going to squeeze. "
"9598030","9599330"," Oh fuck, next month's CPI."
"9599610","9603170"," If that comes out fucking looking like fucking, you're like, it's fucking straight."
"9603810","9607250"," Well vertical down, which would mean that we're going to put slam down at 2% year over year"
"9607250","9607750"," inflation. "
"9608650","9613550"," I'm scared because I know that that bounce off that 2% inflation is going to bring up the Fed"
"9613550","9614550"," saying mission accomplished."
"9618350","9619890"," They do that mission accomplished shit."
"9619970","9623150"," They're going to start cutting rates on you because they, because you know what else is going to be"
"9623150","9623430"," happening?"
"9623910","9625930"," Your unemployment rate is going to be fucking near vertical too. "
"9626410","9630050"," And they already are knowing that they're going to have to cut rates, so they're going to chase it."
"9631430","9635270"," You're going to see an employment race up into that four, five, six, eight percent."
"9636550","9639350"," You're going to see inflation start rising vertical again. "
"9640130","9642630"," And you're going to see the fucking Fed start cutting fucking rates."
"9644450","9651750"," So when you see me talking about these things, these economic results or news or whatever, it's"
"9651750","9653090"," like two, it's like two face."
"9653090","9658490"," There's like, yeah, you've got the intraday or the day training aspect to it, but then you've got"
"9658490","9659410"," the macro. "
"9660090","9661450"," What does this ultimately mean?"
"9662870","9666030"," You're like, what timeframe are you bullish or bearish is different?"
"9671350","9673490"," And also about the triggers and the velocity."
"9673870","9676830"," I've got a, I recorded an entire training program."
"9676990","9677350"," It's done. "
"9678250","9679130"," I think he edited."
"9679510","9681990"," You're going to get that training program at the end of the month."
"9682250","9684730"," So you'll have all this stuff to look back on. "
"9684730","9689430"," You can, uh, anytime there's a question, you can go in and all these videos are like 30 seconds,"
"9689430","9692930"," one minute, five minutes, goes and talks about every topic."
"9692930","9698150"," You ever hear me say something like on a three hour look back, we're trading sideways, we're going"
"9698150","9698450"," to go up."
"9699050","9700330"," I've got videos for that. "
"9700550","9702270"," Explains it in detail what you're looking for."
"9702990","9705170"," So I'll be holding your hand along the entire way."
"9716070","9716630"," That's right. "
"9716850","9717050"," That's right."
"9721150","9730670"," So anyways, um, my point here is have a fucking plan and you're trading for"
"9730670","9733510"," your trade going the right way."
"9734230","9740970"," Have that same plan include when the trade goes against you have best and worst case for when that"
"9740970","9742090"," trade goes against you. "
"9743110","9749310"," The next part of that as well is, um, timing your trade is critical."
"9750790","9752910"," You cannot be scared shorting."
"9753010","9754850"," You cannot be scared getting long. "
"9755210","9757230"," You have to be buying dips if you're bullish."
"9757910","9762990"," You have to be selling rips if you're bearish and have that plan in place."
"9763670","9770210"," The death of a trader or an investor is when you see the prior example and you jump on the"
"9770210","9771710"," train up or down. "
"9772230","9773830"," You see the market rolling down."
"9773990","9775290"," You're like, I'm all fucking bearish."
"9775810","9778710"," You're likely already, you're likely you've seen that already happen. "
"9779150","9781250"," You're likely going to get fucked on the upside."
"9781250","9782170"," The same thing."
"9782970","9785710"," Likely you're, you're likely jumping on the end of that run. "
"9786070","9790350"," You're likely going to get rolled even if it continues higher and we in the wrong side of that"
"9790350","9790590"," trade."
"9790910","9793250"," I'm going to show you a simple way that even what I'm talking about here."
"9794070","9794990"," Very basic. "
"9796470","9796990"," Trend."
"9800380","9800800"," Right."
"9801320","9802640"," You're fucking a bull. "
"9803420","9805280"," You see this you buy it right."
"9806140","9806860"," Buy some calls."
"9808700","9809220"," Right. "
"9809220","9810400"," Rolls down on you."
"9811620","9812100"," Right."
"9812280","9813060"," You're upside down now. "
"9813080","9813280"," Right."
"9813620","9815040"," Comes back up two days later."
"9815180","9815600"," Guess what?"
"9815820","9817320"," Your fucking calls are still burned. "
"9818300","9818560"," Right."
"9819180","9822020"," So you need to be buying here when it's dangerous."
"9822400","9823280"," Buying here when you're scared. "
"9823740","9824180"," Buying here."
"9824900","9827060"," Makes sense that you're always riding that up."
"9827620","9831020"," You're choosing when you're going to monetize your calls. "
"9831780","9832300"," Makes sense."
"9832700","9836440"," If you get really crafty you can enter exit, enter exit, enter, exit."
"9836440","9837720"," Any time frame. "
"9838100","9838560"," One minute."
"9838660","9839020"," Five minute."
"9839120","9839440"," Thirty minute. "
"9839640","9839940"," One day."
"9840080","9840380"," One week."
"9840580","9840960"," Doesn't matter. "
"9841300","9841580"," Year."
"9841960","9842400"," Don't care."
"9843460","9844100"," Doesn't matter. "
"9845160","9846040"," Same thing on the downside."
"9847660","9848200"," That works."
"9848360","9848940"," Same thing on the downside. "
"9849300","9849800"," Just like that."
"9849960","9850040"," Right."
"9850700","9851880"," You're buying puts here. "
"9852140","9852920"," You're buying puts here."
"9853060","9853840"," You're buying puts here."
"9854460","9856100"," You're not fucking buying puts up here. "
"9856320","9856640"," Up here."
"9856960","9857200"," Up here."
"9857340","9858320"," You're a seller right now. "
"9858500","9858980"," I'm telling you."
"9859220","9860360"," Right now if you're a seller."
"9860580","9861800"," I don't care if we continue higher. "
"9862120","9863260"," Close to needed level."
"9863260","9866460"," I don't care if we go up here."
"9867220","9871440"," If you're a seller, your time to short is right fucking here. "
"9872020","9873380"," Even if it goes against you."
"9874940","9878880"," Your time is not to short this shit down here."
"9879840","9880480"," Oh, look it. "
"9880820","9881460"," I was waiting for it."
"9881560","9883460"," Well, it's actually here."
"9884500","9885600"," That's where I'd like to short. "
"9885840","9887120"," I should get rid of that."
"9887480","9888520"," Personally, there's retail."
"9888660","9889560"," I'd rather short that shit. "
"9890180","9890920"," It rolls right here."
"9892100","9892940"," Comes back up right here."
"9892940","9895120"," I'd take that fucking short right there and take that one down. "
"9895480","9896080"," That'd be me."
"9896280","9897300"," But my point stands."
"9898160","9899740"," Get on the right side of your trades. "
"9901200","9902000"," Stop seriously."
"9902580","9902980"," Stop fucking."
"9903180","9904080"," Stop fucking. "
"9904360","9908960"," Like, I can see bears like we're down here and they're in the stream going."
"9910040","9911520"," They're like all bare it up."
"9911680","9913620"," Like, oh, bro, we're going to crash way down here. "
"9913820","9915560"," I see fucking bulls do the same shit."
"9916360","9916640"," Right here."
"9916960","9918780"," I bet you there's a bull in this stream right now. "
"9918780","9921800"," Saying, Captain fucking doesn't always talk about going to the moon."
"9922120","9922600"," Guaranteed."
"9923200","9928800"," When you should be exiting here and waiting for this to come back and show the way to the next"
"9928800","9930340"," level over there. "
"9935730","9936650"," It is the difference."
"9937570","9939250"," It is the difference."
"9939250","9943690"," The White House's brain on says the US economy has seen between you being profitable. "
"9946070","9951210"," The new getting torched repetitively year over year over year over year."
"9966590","9968870"," I'm telling you guys, I promise you."
"9971490","9973010"," Promise you, promise you guys. "
"9973690","9976290"," You back test this stuff and telling you."
"9977790","9980590"," These people disappear, man, all the fucking time."
"9981070","9988030"," You need to have the tools in your chest where probability wise and statistically you want to be a"
"9988030","9989370"," winner most of the time. "
"9989850","9992670"," And when it goes against you and you're a loser, you want to manage that loss."

"10531960","10533000"," And that's right here."
"10533120","10534120"," My cursor is right there. "
"10534260","10534860"," Let's see 11th."
"10535040","10535520"," And guess what we do?"
"10535620","10536760"," We start to go down."
"10543130","10543850"," Hold on here. "
"10545130","10545810"," Come on, baby."
"10545970","10546490"," Just give it to me."
"10548370","10549450"," Let's call that the. "
"10552210","10554490"," Call that in and around the 19th day."
"10556290","10558330"," Down move into the 19th day."
"10558510","10559890"," What day of the month is that?"
"10561670","10562490"," Let's take a look. "
"10562490","10570750"," Oh, that's January 26th."
"10572030","10576350"," And there's another day in here or another high in here right on the 13th day."
"10576990","10581570"," So we're going to look for tomorrow to begin a downside move. "
"10585870","10588570"," With a low on the 11th day, expect downside."
"10589150","10589190"," Ready?"
"10589970","10590550"," From Thursday."
"10591790","10596070"," The 11th until the 17th expect a downside move. "
"10596810","10598330"," From the 17th day."

"10601910","10602810"," Until we get to. "
"10606750","10607870"," The 13th day."
"10607990","10608390"," That's Friday."
"10608770","10611070"," So from the 17th of the 19th expect a pump. "
"10612010","10613830"," And then expect a downside move."
"10617480","10622240"," Into say at least the 26th, if not the 29th of January."
"10622660","10623600"," So basically downside. "
"10624500","10626560"," Into the end of January over here."
"10628360","10631960"," So start looking to place your best ticket downside moving in a month."
"10632300","10633600"," And look for one more pull up. "
"10634360","10635480"," And then a downside moving to March."
"10636300","10638060"," Now we might not trade this exactly."
"10638940","10641700"," We might have like an oversized move to the upside. "
"10642220","10643400"," Then a downside crazy move."
"10643560","10644460"," Then an upside crazy move."
"10645340","10647640"," But usually we'll fall inside of some kind of trend like this. "
"10647800","10648960"," So it's not perfect."
"10651440","10653040"," But we are going to be looking for."
"10667460","10669060"," So what are we looking for?"

"10678700","10682000"," I'm going to expect some selling action to begin on Friday in a Monday."
"10682640","10685140"," I'm going to expect selling in the end of the month of January. "
"10685620","10686820"," I'm going to expect another rip."
"10687680","10689700"," Possibly to all time highs."
"10691000","10695560"," Into February and then a big downside move a blood bath on that trip, right?"
"10695700","10696840"," We get our all time highs. "
"10698740","10700060"," After this pullback."
"10700200","10706080"," So from now, generally now into the end of January, I'm expecting a pullback."
"10707000","10710380"," And then I'm going to expect all time highs. "
"10710380","10719600"," And then I'm going to expect a major correction for a springtime dip to buy"

"10810310","10812150"," I think this counter was like five bucks."
"10812570","10813450"," Dirt fucking cheap."
"10815670","10821250"," I actually looked for like the, I was looking for like the dill or the dill's data like the fuck"
"10821250","10823350"," or something like hot bad guys. "
"10824670","10830990"," And then I was looking for, I couldn't find that on Amazon that I was looking for like like a"
"10830990","10831670"," fat firefighters."
"10832170","10833170"," It was all like hot firefighters."
"10834070","10836210"," So I was like, well, I'll just get the trashiest one that's five bucks. "
"10836210","10837430"," I can't get what I really want."
"10851170","10855130"," So I just put, so ready?"
"10855510","10856250"," I'll say it one more time."
"10856990","10860230"," I expect market weakness beginning tomorrow. "
"10861530","10864530"," That market weakness will have, we'll have one more rip next week."
"10865330","10867950"," And then we'll should have some more downside into the end of January."
"10868310","10869870"," 26 29 somewhere in there. "
"10870950","10873070"," Then we're going to expect a run up to all time highs."
"10874230","10878190"," We're going to tag that all time high and then we're going to have a fucking major correction."
"10879370","10887670"," Now, if we don't trade that, you know, price action that this is the last caveat to that price"
"10887670","10889090"," action is king. "
"10889510","10892570"," So if we start doing all time highs right now, I'll follow it up."
"10892810","10893330"," No problem."
"10894050","10895430"," But that's the expectation. "
"10919160","10922040"," Two PM East in time to get the US federal budget."
"10922180","10923040"," Does that answer your question?"
"10923800","10925180"," Who asked that question?"
"10925500","10926220"," 14 billion."
"10926980","10928420"," Let me go back and find them. "
"10929660","10930820"," Hamster on speed."
"10931780","10933300"," Did that answer your question?"
"10938840","10940520"," Did that answer you guys question?"
"10942600","10943180"," Cool."
"10944640","10945600"," Hamster on speed. "
"10945920","10948120"," The last caveat that I'll leave for you is this."
"10949580","10956940"," If price stays above the hourly trigger, I'm going to trade it all the way to the fucking above."
"10957280","10958500"," I'll give you this one last caveat. "
"10959060","10959320"," You ready?"
"10961560","10964160"," We're at 4715 right now, right?"
"10967200","10968260"," See that right there?"
"10970060","10973980"," As long as we stay above that hourly trigger, we trade it higher."
"10974820","10980780"," Until we break that, no matter what expectations I have, we'll trade that to the upside."
"10981800","10984600"," Don't get stuck in like an expectation being a thesis. "
"11002230","11003290"," Right on hamster speed."
"11003950","11004270"," Thanks."
"11004410","11005850"," I appreciate asking the question, man. "
"11006510","11010250"," Or I don't know if you're a guy or a girl or what you want to be addressed as, but"
"11010250","11013830"," whoever you are, appreciate the question."
"11013970","11016750"," I appreciate your putting that question out there."
"11029510","11031830"," Did those arrows work for you guys out there?"
"11031910","11032450"," Let me on the chat. "
"11034110","11035830"," Did that work for you right there?"
"11037770","11039190"," Did that work right there for you?"
"11041850","11043730"," Did that work right there for you or no?"
"11050580","11051680"," Does that work for you?"
"11051780","11054960"," Does this help you guys out here today or no?"
"11062970","11063810"," That's a good question."
"11064110","11065190"," Who just asked that?"
"11065570","11071370"," Major malfunctions said, what confirmation are you looking for in that pin that before you go"
"11071370","11071670"," short?"
"11071950","11073170"," That's a fucking great question."
"11074630","11075070"," Okay. "
"11075270","11077290"," So that's a great fucking question."
"11077290","11078570"," So major malfunctions."
"11078690","11080030"," There's a major malfunctions that's that?"
"11080290","11080570"," Okay. "
"11081130","11082790"," So that's a very good question, major malfunction."
"11083290","11085430"," Let's look at prior history and find out, right?"
"11087010","11088550"," So let's look at that really quick."
"11088810","11091810"," We're going to go to the trigger screen screen screen screen screen right now. "
"11092450","11092650"," Right?"
"11093250","11094850"," I'm going to show you prior examples of that, okay?"
"11097910","11099550"," Let me show, I can't delete all."
"11099750","11100850"," I want to do this somewhere else."
"11102890","11103530"," Right here. "
"11103590","11104170"," We'll do it right here."
"11104390","11105190"," I think we can do it right here."
"11107630","11109410"," There's a great example right here. "
"11109530","11115210"," This is actually a dot example, but let's look for a role somewhere without these fucking lines."
"11115430","11115730"," Oh, this works."
"11116770","11121330"," See how you like, hey, I'm bearish. "
"11121330","11123950"," I'm going to make this so you guys can see it."
"11125150","11125590"," Okay."
"11125990","11127170"," It's a great example right here. "
"11127710","11128590"," Fucking great example."
"11129570","11130010"," So."
"11132230","11133070"," Market's going to roll. "
"11133230","11134930"," I was told by expectation going to roll."
"11135250","11136050"," Didn't right."
"11136930","11137970"," Held the hourly trigger, right?"
"11139210","11140410"," It told me it's going to roll. "
"11140910","11141890"," Held the hourly trigger, right?"
"11142170","11143270"," Did you have gotten short here and here?"
"11143550","11145450"," No, maybe intraday stuff, but no, right?"
"11146410","11146930"," So how do you know?"
"11149990","11151810"," You break the hourly trigger."
"11153510","11153990"," Right."
"11154730","11156270"," And you break your prior low. "
"11156830","11157490"," Right there."
"11157790","11158490"," One minute remaining."
"11158710","11159630"," And that's your fucking trade. "
"11160770","11160870"," Right."
"11161370","11162430"," And you're going to forget these lines."
"11162690","11163850"," This is for lines for today. "
"11163990","11164930"," This isn't backwards lines."
"11165270","11165770"," These are for today."
"11165810","11168530"," These lines is for just right now, but this stuff wouldn't have been here, but. "
"11169690","11170390"," Pulled up."
"11170990","11173530"," Selling again on that hourly trigger, right down."
"11173990","11175630"," You can even miss this move. "
"11176170","11177830"," And just take this one right here."
"11177930","11179650"," You're in the same fucking place, right?"
"11180050","11181850"," Wait for the first drop, but even get in over here."
"11181890","11183090"," And then that's where you take the trade. "
"11184050","11185490"," We don't have that yet, Dewey."
"11186290","11187190"," So right here."
"11191570","11192850"," We don't have that Dewey. "
"11193530","11194670"," We're above right now, right?"
"11195510","11196930"," So what would you be looking for here?"
"11199210","11201250"," So let's say price stopped right here today."
"11202790","11205250"," You'd be waiting for 10 seconds."
"11205250","11206510"," The bloodbath down, right?"
"11207370","11209070"," And then the rejection down. "
"11209350","11210410"," So as soon as you see that rejection."
"11212510","11214150"," Has this rejected yet?"
"11215490","11216390"," No, right?"
"11216710","11217430"," This is not rejected."
"11217530","11220190"," It has nine foot four billion minus one hundred. "
"11220190","11224430"," So if it does roll, if this rejects here, though, it rolls down and does this."
"11224690","11226010"," Five billion."
"11226330","11226530"," Fuck. "
"11226690","11226770"," Yeah."
"11226890","11227950"," Go short right there, right?"
"11229150","11230730"," Then you're on and you're ready to rock."
"11230950","11233030"," So that hourly trigger is key. "
"11235650","11237290"," Are we bullish right here?"
"11237710","11238450"," The answer is no."
"11240370","11244550"," We are not bullish until we back check the hourly trigger and it's successful."
"11245230","11245370"," Okay. "
"11246330","11247650"," Can we beat this shit over here?"
"11248350","11249830"," That's your confirmation of bullishness."
"11262630","11264090"," Let's look at this right here."
"11265330","11267370"," Got that bad boy right in there. "
"11268030","11268430"," Right there."
"11270990","11272670"," You got a little one right here."
"11277390","11278450"," There's your next target. "
"11279350","11281530"," And you got this bad bad boy right here."
"11292870","11294850"," Now what is a bull looking for here?"
"11295010","11296610"," So we drew all that out for you, right?"
"11296850","11298010"," What are we looking for right here?"
"11298170","11298390"," You know?"
"11307090","11308110"," I'm looking for that."
"11319770","11321310"," So this one's complete, right?"
"11322790","11324490"," Now we can get invalidated here. "
"11326310","11331590"," If any of this fails, we come down here, we go down and we start doing this."
"11331590","11333630"," My thesis is wrong, right?"
"11334270","11335250"," I switched to a seller."
"11341010","11342510"," This is what I'm looking for. "
"11342890","11344510"," This is my plan right here."
"11345170","11347650"," Now this one down here might only go to the one minute."
"11348010","11348770"," It might not go. "
"11348930","11350330"," As a matter of fact, we'll leave that right here."
"11351170","11354470"," I'm going to put a liquidation break right here and make this simpler for you."
"11356290","11357310"," Are we maybe more?"
"11367450","11370550"," Now personally, I would take the money here. "
"11370550","11376260"," And I would be looking for another trade right there."
"11377300","11378800"," Another trade right there."
"11379200","11380380"," I'm a buyer here. "
"11380560","11381920"," I might get left behind here."
"11401950","11403110"," This is what I want."
"11404110","11406090"," I want that trade right there. "
"11408470","11409670"," I want to be a buyer here."
"11409830","11411890"," Now watch, if I get left behind here, right?"
"11412490","11412950"," That's okay."
"11413230","11413770"," We got left behind. "
"11415410","11416310"," You got R1."
"11416530","11418090"," We could go right up to this R1 right here."
"11418190","11419950"," We'll come up here and start doing this. "
"11420150","11420950"," Come back down and go up."
"11421030","11422590"," I can try to jump back in right there."
"11441600","11443080"," I love you, Mr. Talking Monkey. "
"11444140","11445960"," And I love that you've been here this long, man."
"11446860","11447580"," I do, brother."
"11447980","11448600"," I want you to know that. "
"11449620","11450360"," I know something."
"11450740","11452160"," You know what I know, Mr. Talking Monkey?"
"11452580","11454420"," You're going to take this shit and teach other people, brother."
"11455540","11456440"," I know that. "
"11457140","11458800"," You're going to have an impact on other people, man."
"11460540","11461060"," Seriously."
"11470150","11471270"," You're going to make a difference. "
"11480810","11481770"," Where we roam?"
"11482030","11482890"," What's going on, brother?"
"11484250","11485290"," Good to see you, my man."
"11485990","11487190"," Chase, how you doing, man?"
"11490430","11491630"," Sunday never ends."
"11492290","11497570"," He said I bought a Boeing 225 for tomorrow because I like it when people open doors for me in"
"11497570","11497770"," life. "
"11498490","11499610"," That's fucking hilarious, bro."
"11508140","11509440"," Oh, look at that up there."
"11509580","11510680"," It's just begging for us. "
"11512340","11512860"," Look at that."
"11512940","11513480"," It's just a big old."
"11513820","11514280"," It's come on. "
"11514360","11514960"," Come on up here."
"11515600","11516060"," Come on."
"11516160","11516980"," Come see me up there. "
"11521950","11523450"," Look at that supply up there."
"11523530","11525270"," It's like big old stink bit up there."
"11525730","11526450"," I'll buy you. "
"11526570","11527030"," Come up here."
"11529910","11533970"," That's where that red bar is on the, uh, that's where that red bar is right here, I think."
"11533970","11534870"," Right up there somewhere. "
"11536350","11537330"," This one right here."
"11537430","11539350"," I think that's that red bar on book map."
"11541790","11542810"," Love you too, Kat. "
"11543010","11543370"," Connor Wilson."
"11547950","11550070"," Hell yeah, Mr. Ralph, our major malfunction."
"11559950","11560590"," Hey, Chase. "
"11561410","11561890"," Hey, Chase."
"11562210","11566410"," I've got, um, I got weakness coming in tomorrow, brother."
"11567130","11570390"," It starts tomorrow, um, lasts into, I believe next week. "
"11570390","11571070"," I sent it earlier."
"11571370","11572630"," Come back and check the stream later."
"11573570","11579210"," Uh, then it, uh, gets more nasty into the 26 29th and then we get all time highs into, uh,"
"11579390","11580070"," February, I believe. "
"11587550","11589410"," John Hagerty, giving us an update right now."
"11590230","11594450"," Saying, uh, to watch T and X yield broke below the ascending channel edge and continues to drop"
"11594450","11596810"," pushing markets up right now."

"11611040","11612100"," You guys got the date."
"11612100","11617140"," So, uh, you know, you guys got more info."
"11618380","11620020"," I love you too, Joey, don't it?"
"11629090","11631510"," This is the place to be flat, even if we go higher here. "
"11632990","11634590"," This is the place for you to be flat."
"11641070","11641690"," Trust me."
"11645120","11649440"," I might not be right this time, but I'm right, like 70, 70% of the time. "
"11654660","11657280"," Stick around long enough and you'll figure it out and be like, Oh, fuck."
"11660620","11664260"," If I tell a bull, like, exit the market, you're fucking, you know it."
"11664480","11666440"," If I tell a bear, like, wrap it up, you're done. "
"11669000","11669360"," Yeah."
"11671300","11672620"," Hang around the barbershop long enough."
"11676140","11677040"," What's going on, Chase?"
"11677700","11685900"," Yeah, we gave some dates here. "
"11687960","11690360"," We got some dates on a, we were taught, we have a calendar."
"11691040","11692220"," We have a hot men calendar."
"11697560","11699200"," Thurston Howell, the third's got his own. "
"11699600","11700240"," Thurston, dude."
"11701100","11704780"," Hey, is there a way we can have Thurston take a picture of his and post it?"
"11705140","11706100"," Thurston, dude, do me a solid."
"11706920","11710880"," Take a picture of a calendar and pat me on Twitter so I can repost it. "
"11712480","11718800"," And matter of fact, any of you out there that have a hot guy calendar, take pictures and at me"

"18020870","18029750"," and uh likely 460 Um, so that's off of 480 so somewhere in there Uh, I think that's the extreme"
"18033490","18036890"," I do I like the charts for, um, d-a-l-u-p-s and peak. "
