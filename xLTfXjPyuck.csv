"1029","2950"," It's just been non-fucking-stop."
"5160","6480"," I'm just going to get right into it."
"6700","7520"," I'm going to skip everything. "
"7980","11060"," We're going to switch right over because there's just no point."
"13980","15020"," So we'll see if this works."
"17380","18500"," We'll make this simple today. "
"19740","23640"," I got here indicator not working today just doesn't feel like we're going to install lazy."
"27460","29180"," I got YouTube that doesn't want to work."
"33500","35840"," I got Google Chrome that's a fucking disaster today. "
"37380","39020"," I don't know exactly what's happening this morning."
"39320","40820"," I kind of know what's happening this morning."
"41000","41580"," I think I do. "
"41760","42400"," It has something to do with Chrome."
"43900","46240"," I'm having issues streaming this morning."
"46360","49160"," I'm having issues with Chrome and logins and all over the place. "
"49660","50800"," Here are indicators down."
"51180","54080"," I've had to contact different services this morning."
"56240","60380"," My frustration level is at peak levels right now. "
"61440","62680"," So bear with me this morning."
"63300","65780"," I don't like being stressed out especially after a nice long weekend."
"65940","66600"," The weekend was awesome. "
"68300","70160"," So I'm a little good morning, everybody."
"70340","76400"," If you're actually, I've tried to put this live stream up three times now in all three, but kind of"
"76400","76760"," a disaster."
"77220","78340"," So I'm going to try this one more time. "
"78720","83980"," Give me just a second here because I got to get on Twitter and delete some posts that said this"
"83980","88040"," is the live stream and it's not going to delete this one."
"89640","91980"," I'm even having trouble with Twitter this morning."
"92200","94380"," Having trouble all across social media. "
"95840","99780"," Google having problems, having problems with brokerages, all kinds of nonsense."
"100140","101260"," I don't know exactly what's going on."
"101580","102840"," I don't know if it was a Chrome thing. "
"104220","112040"," When the Chrome thing came out, I wiped out my history and then started reset passwords and then I"
"112040","112520"," don't know"
"112520","124360"," if"
"124360","124360"," it was lag."
"124360","125800"," Whatever it is."
"126780","128160"," So fucking be it, I guess. "
"128639","131440"," So that's what's happening for this morning."
"131840","134220"," We are blasting above some resistance this morning."
"134280","135180"," We got a bunch to go over. "
"135640","137260"," Dude, I don't even know what that's about."
"137260","141940"," I got like fucking crazy, crazy town going on this morning."
"142040","144280"," I've got like stuff, not. "
"145180","148720"," Oppa forms or it could."
"149420","151100"," I got some more trick going on."
"151700","155260"," Like I got placards, not fucking uploading. "
"156460","156860"," Whatever."
"157200","158820"," So we're just going to do it like this this morning."
"161960","163220"," Oh, we see here. "
"163320","163760"," Give me a second."
"164600","165900"," We're going to do it live."
"170900","172380"," Thanks, I bear with me here. "
"186620","187100"," All right."
"188360","190040"," Pile in this morning, boys and girls."
"190200","191120"," Hope you all had a great weekend. "
"192420","194460"," We have a little chit chat session this morning."
"195160","196420"," We got a lot to go over."
"199860","204720"," Okay, so we are breaking above that this resistance this morning, right?"
"204860","205740"," We held for 10. "
"206000","207080"," We dipped a little bit down."
"207080","209440"," I think it was like 409, 81 or something like that."
"210940","212960"," And we are trading higher at 415 12. "
"213520","215260"," We'll be looking to make a support here."
"215840","217180"," Turn this for 14, 415."
"218240","219800"," I'm left scratching my head this morning. "
"221300","222940"," You know, 410 P's."
"223200","225120"," They've been loading up on these things since the bell."
"225300","227500"," They're now down to 69 cents, 67 cents. "
"227920","230260"," They're like two fucking dollars on the bell this morning."
"231220","233900"," But crack smoking, if you think you're going to buy that shit."
"235160","235880"," Crack smoking. "
"236960","241040"," That's probably a place today to buy some puts, but not two fucking dollars."
"242360","244060"," They're bouncing around right now."
"244060","246000"," But we'll talk about that. "
"246160","249340"," We're going to talk about that this today and the rest of the week we have lining up."
"249880","254100"," I do want you to see here right off the bread off the bat this morning, seen as I'm a"
"254100","254800"," little late here."
"256779","259140"," You got some major resistance above here. "
"259200","260600"," It's not quite showing up here."
"261460","261920"," Right there."
"263540","265700"," So right where we are right now, okay, you've got sellers. "
"268600","275180"," You've got sellers over here between where we are currently in this 417 level, but they're weak"
"275180","275580"," sellers."
"275580","279040"," You can see right here, we're following my curse right inside the weak sellers."
"279240","279800"," Forget about the heroin. "
"279800","282060"," I don't know why it's not working right now."
"283960","286500"," Major sellers are above, though, at 420, okay?"
"287980","289640"," And we could reverse any point in here."
"289760","292100"," We could reverse between here and 417, 420, whatever. "
"292220","292780"," It doesn't matter."
"292940","295720"," This is kind of like a trapping type environment."
"296080","302060"," The one fear here is this, is that if you're a bull in early, you could get trapped. "
"302060","308140"," So when we're down here at these levels, whether you're buying 410 or you're waiting for 405 or"
"308140","313600"," 400, we're going to talk about that too because we probably will go lower to 400, not even 405."
"314340","319460"," We should expect a reaction at 405 just because of the placement of options in the market, but at"
"319460","323500"," the same time, this is more of a trapping type operation."
"323500","327360"," So if you're a bull, you start buying your calls and you're like, fuck, yeah, I'm just buying"
"327360","331360"," fucking, just buying fucking 430s, expired on Friday. "
"331360","334600"," I'm going to fucking diamondhand those bad boys until Friday."
"335060","336080"," It's kind of a tough play."
"337360","344980"," They might print, but I don't like about these, what I don't like about these FMC weeks is you tend"
"344980","349380"," to go early and then they reset options on you. "
"349920","355960"," At multiple points, you might get reset options two, three times this week and they're shaking you"
"355960","356200"," out."
"356720","361900"," What will happen is you'll lose your, you'll lose faith at some point and be like, fuck this, I"
"361900","362760"," ain't buying another dip."
"363200","364280"," And boom, there it goes. "
"364860","367600"," 20 cent calls turn into like $6 or something stupid."
"368300","369380"," So anyways, that's my point."
"369540","370600"," So first of all, think of that. "
"370920","374620"," Second off, you could just sit back and buy some fucking call spreads."
"375120","377800"," You buy them right on the open this morning, 410-409."
"378420","380780"," Yeah, we might swing lower to 400, but it's coming back up. "
"383240","384760"," That's the general viewpoint."
"385200","387800"," We'll go through all that why it should go up."
"388820","390320"," There are multiple reasons. "
"391000","396460"," You're going to have to see some major, major put replacement from here into Wednesday and Friday."
"397120","403580"," Like major, like you're talking like $200 million rolling through options flow."
"403940","409860"," Like not like $200 million of not at the buy at the ask. "
"410220","413380"," Like you'd see it through flow algo this morning."
"413900","414640"," It would pop up."
"415140","416680"," That's how much has to come in. "
"417160","420620"," You're talking major hedging, major put buying from prop desks."
"421040","423760"," It's not just any old regular old."
"424740","426260"," With that said though, right?"
"426780","431240"," You're also going to get these fucking dealers and market makers and they like to do fuckery as"
"431240","431420"," well. "
"431620","436300"," They need to make their money as we rotate up and away from where we are right now."
"437200","444120"," I've spent the past week trying to validate a trip to 4360 or 380 right now."
"444340","446800"," I'm looking at PE ratios and S&P 500. "
"448140","450980"," I'm looking at S&P ratios on NASDAQ."
"451880","453300"," I see us going there."
"454500","458960"," But like right now, I'm scratching my fucking head on that. "
"459200","459800"," I really am."
"459960","464520"," I'm like, I'm just like with the time involved, right?"
"465280","470220"," And it's funny too because you hear bears are like, I don't mind us going even to 240."
"470820","477780"," But even so, at time, like you're talking about doing something that is today. "
"478880","480260"," It's fucking pure nonsense."
"481380","482180"," It really is."
"482500","483840"," The market is being manipulated. "
"484820","488580"," Unlike any other time in history on the way up and now the way down to some extent."
"490940","491800"," What are you saying?"
"492020","496500"," We're going to 360 this week and then we're going to fucking 240 in a month or two."
"497040","498520"," That's just your smoking fucking crack. "
"499480","500500"," It's just impossible."
"502480","505700"," But no, you're not getting a market crash every year or two."
"505700","506540"," You just aren't. "
"507080","508560"," They're not going to allow it."
"509260","511900"," No matter how pocket or spread share power is."
"512620","517980"," If you start seeing market crashes every year or two in the US economy, they're going to fucking do"
"517980","518299"," something. "
"518679","520580"," I promise you, they're going to do something."
"520820","526580"," There's just no, so just the time that we're talking about here is just fucking pure insanity."
"527880","529520"," They're off their fucking rocker. "
"529760","530620"," They really are."
"531020","533480"," And I could even see a bounce here."
"533480","538340"," We head up and then we head down to a really nice buy at some point, you know, summertime or"
"538340","541960"," even fall where we do trade down to 360, 380, somewhere in there. "
"542160","543260"," I don't think that's implausible."
"543820","546480"," But I think you're smoking fucking crack and you're like, oh, yeah, we're going to hit 360 today."
"547000","550180"," We're going to bounce back up and then we're going to fucking head down to like 240 by end of"
"550180","550300"," year. "
"551000","552580"," It ain't going to happen like that."
"552980","554480"," It's going to be like one to three years."
"555280","559420"," The time frames that people have on some of this shit blows my fucking mind. "
"560040","567560"," And then the other thing that kind of pisses me off as a retail trader is when we're down, you"
"567560","568640"," know, just bring this one up here."
"570040","572540"," Well, you fucking, they're not going to say fucking retail."
"572540","574800"," I'm going to say, oh, you fucking retard out there. "
"575600","577400"," You guys are fucking assholes to each other."
"577580","578400"," I don't know why you are."
"579420","583440"," Then you see me get pissed off on YouTube. "
"586190","588170"," And you know, I'm looking at something like this, right?"
"588670","592450"," You know what I'm looking for up here in my cursor is I'm looking for some like fucking bears and"
"592450","594350"," bulls to say, take profit."
"595050","599090"," And then we're down here and looking for some bulls and bears to say, long."
"599630","603230"," And then I'm looking up here for some bulls and bears, you know, back and forth like this. "
"603430","604270"," Instead, you know what I get?"
"605230","610030"," I get fucking bombarded with go long up here and get fucking bombarded with go short down here and"
"610030","610930"," get fucking bombarded."
"610930","612730"," And you know where all that shit comes from?"
"614850","617690"," Dumbfucks out in fucking social media land."
"618070","618630"," Dumbfucks. "
"620170","624630"," Drinking shit bombs from fucking, I kid you not."
"624910","631890"," These are from fucking banks and hedge funds and complete utter fucking shitbag fucks."
"632150","635690"," If you're one of those people out there listening to me right now and you take part in that shit,"
"636010","636910"," go fuck yourself. "
"639100","639760"," Like retail."
"640320","641740"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear."
"643180","646440"," But there's a time to buy a fucking dip and there's a time to sell fucking rip. "
"646600","648340"," And it doesn't matter if the market's going up or down."
"649420","650900"," This shit here doesn't matter."
"651040","653620"," It doesn't matter if it's 2020, 2021 going straight up. "
"653820","657160"," There's a time to take profit done by time to take profit time to buy, right?"
"658080","660320"," And the same thing works and we head down too."
"660560","662140"," So it drives me fucking baddie."
"662160","667640"," And what else drives me fucking baddie is that the cacophony and social media is just as fucking"
"667640","675780"," poison as my did my rage is so high right now because I'm at this point where I want to"
"675780","677240"," buy literally is how bad it is. "
"677620","679340"," I want to buy some fucking call spreads, right?"
"679540","681380"," Shut down everything and come back in a couple weeks."
"681680","682460"," I'm there too."
"683620","685900"," You know, especially how we're trading, because I am a bull. "
"686360","689280"," I don't need to deal with this bullshit every fucking week right now."
"689680","692040"," Like I could deal with it back here and we're going straight up."
"692040","696020"," But right now where we are, it's so suspect. "
"696700","699920"," And all it's meant to do is take the money away from you at this point."
"700440","701040"," It doesn't matter."
"701220","704760"," It doesn't matter if we take down a fucking 400 today and tomorrow in a Wednesday. "
"705020","707280"," You just know that you buy this every time."
"707840","709360"," Every single time you buy this."
"710760","715260"," And you know, I'm reading all these fucking posts on Friday and I'm like, this comes from like"
"715260","721760"," social media to the news to trusted institutions that you people look towards out there in the real"
"721760","722020"," world. "
"722020","723100"," And it's fucking disgusting."
"723560","725020"," Like I am so disgusted right now."
"725760","727700"," This is the kind of shit, right?"
"727940","730500"," That turns my turns me off as a retail trader. "
"731480","739140"," What really turns me off as a fucking retail trader is that there's no like, there's no like, at"
"739140","746760"," least 70% of retail saying, hey, take profit here and hey buy here or sell here."
"747040","749700"," Like some general like clearing house or something."
"750340","751320"," Because I promise you, right?"
"751820","754160"," You can get faded and stuff as a professional trader. "
"755100","756580"," People, they'll fuck with each other."
"757000","760900"," Like hedge funds will fuck each other, banks will, but honestly, honestly, in the background, they"
"760900","762140"," know where it's going to an extent."
"763040","764160"," Sometimes they fight each other. "
"764360","765820"," Sometimes there's unknown headline news."
"765980","767540"," You got to see it all the time with headline news."
"767800","774200"," If there's, they usually know the news in advance and when they don't, even when the stock goes the"
"774200","778420"," direction it should because of unknown news, they'll bring it right fucking back down like the same"
"778420","781780"," day or the next day because so they can get placement. "
"783640","786540"," So this is a big long diet time going back years."
"787020","790280"," But my point to you though, is generally speaking, they know where it's going."
"790860","797060"," Retail has to have that kind of brotherhood or sisterhood or themhood or whatever you fuck,"
"797400","800100"," whatever names you're all using for each other these days. "
"801240","802760"," You can see it in politics too."
"802880","804880"," You can see it like just in politics."
"804880","809560"," Democratic group futures are all friendly and low, still down about two and a half percent, one or"
"809560","809800"," two. "
"810220","814180"," You can see more people in the fringes of the right and poor people in the fringes of the left."
"815180","818740"," And all that, all that right is the same similar thing."
"819340","821900"," In this world right now, right?"
"822960","832080"," Companies and politicians and very intelligent people are forcing you to take extreme positions"
"832080","833480"," away from each other. "
"833700","834740"," And this includes the market."
"836700","838280"," And there's like a division."
"839040","840680"," You think you're rich too. "
"840760","842380"," You could be making a million dollars a year."
"842520","844860"," You're not rich and you're not."
"845400","852300"," And they're still dividing you on what reality is in this world. "
"852680","854480"," So my mind is fucking blown right now."
"854800","862200"," Now could you have like, I don't know, some kind of a fucking market crash today or tomorrow or"
"862200","864000"," Wednesday to plunge to 360?"
"864520","864700"," Sure."
"865720","867240"," But I'd rather buy the dip today. "
"867840","872980"," And if we plunge to 360 today, then it's been buying it up here or up here or anywhere else."
"873200","874740"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"875220","876820"," Like literally any of you."
"877100","881740"," You'd be wanting to buy this dip down here no matter how fucking deep the plunge is. "
"882320","887800"," Same thing goes for any time in 2021, 2020."
"888380","893620"," Like any of these sell-offs you want to fucking buy every fucking time."
"895000","896820"," So I don't, I'm going to rage today. "
"897380","899160"," I really, I'm like, I'm at a point right now, right?"
"899480","902560"," Where I'm at, I'm at like, I need a break face."
"903320","906440"," I need a fucking break because it's this kind of shit."
"906660","908560"," I mean, it's just fucking baffling. "
"909880","911900"," It really is fucking baffling."
"912720","914440"," What's going on here in the market?"
"914940","916900"," It's like in Paul, you see it everywhere today, right?"
"917460","919300"," You see it almost everything."
"921020","927540"," You want to write like I posted some about a Forbes article that came out yesterday, some shit"
"927540","928940"," fucking talking Forbes article. "
"928940","933180"," I mean, they should have posted that article here or over here or over here."
"933380","933980"," Not down here."
"934400","935080"," Post it up here. "
"936040","940440"," Now, because they post really positive articles up here and you end up buying, continuing to buy,"
"940600","942540"," saying we're going higher and of course we sell off."
"943580","945600"," So this market is built to fuck you."
"946660","947360"," It's my point. "
"947540","950240"," That's the point of this is that this market is built to fuck you."
"951060","951860"," That's what it does."
"953900","955280"," And so that's what they're going to do. "
"955480","959300"," Now, furthermore on that topic and that same topic, this is a trap down here."
"959920","962000"," It's the trap bulls in, it's trap bears in."
"962140","965020"," They will bring it up, but in the meantime, they're going to trap you. "
"966220","968640"," And that's because they don't want you to win, even if you see it."
"968900","969080"," Okay."
"969200","972000"," So there's going to be some fuckery down in here next couple of days. "
"972780","976940"," Within this fuckery, there's also some mechanics and plays, some technicals and play."
"977580","983540"," And there's some reasons why we should go up unless you see giant rolling hedges and puts from prop"
"983540","985140"," desks at the same time."
"986040","988720"," So the easy play for you is to just buy some spreads, man. "
"988840","989200"," Come back."
"989780","990680"," Literally, it's easy."
"992020","992620"," It's easy. "
"993280","994460"," It's like dumb down, no brainer."
"995300","998220"," Stuff that should be taking place for you as a trader."
"999260","1000820"," These are the easiest trades. "
"1000820","1010280"," These are the ones where you simplify your trading and you can make money, like steady money,"
"1010900","1012580"," regardless of which way the market's going."
"1013480","1016320"," Now, we're going to look at the spot gamma report this morning for just a moment."
"1018420","1023420"," The macro theme, I stopped for looking at this, but we're going to look at this because people were"
"1023420","1024160"," asking for it. "
"1025319","1029880"," So the sustained rally isn't likely to occur until May 4th, which holds the FMC due to this event."
"1030380","1033680"," These events, I guess, volatility, large puts is unlikely to be meaningfully sold."
"1033839","1034880"," This is the key part, right?"
"1035280","1036300"," The fuck are we talking about?"
"1036400","1037500"," There are mechanics in the background. "
"1037940","1039440"," Why as well, right?"
"1039640","1042900"," What you could say that the dealers are making all this money, right?"
"1043020","1044680"," There are other reasons too, right?"
"1045619","1047460"," These large banks are not going to sell their puts."
"1047600","1049900"," They're going to hold them just in case, right?"
"1050080","1051860"," Just in case there's something they don't know about."
"1053100","1055080"," It prevents an extended rise in equities. "
"1055080","1059280"," A break of 4,200 invokes our lower bound concept bound into F54."
"1059800","1064640"," We see some substantial longer-term support at 4050 due to large open interest at 4,000."
"1065200","1066700"," Due to the trading, blah, blah, blah. "
"1067260","1073360"," We look for a volatile session with an implied move of 1.2%. The VIX is trading near 34, which"
"1073360","1076780"," implies a 2.14%. Daily move for SPX."
"1076980","1077360"," It's weird too."
"1077540","1080520"," They're talking about backwardation in the VIX this morning. "
"1081180","1082400"," Now, there's some other issues in there too."
"1083460","1085140"," Key resistance is at 4,200."
"1085680","1086340"," We know that, right?"
"1086480","1091000"," We're probably not going to get about 4,200 between now and FOMC. "
"1091140","1096560"," Support lies at 4,000, 41, 20, 410 of the spy, and then 4049."
"1097200","1099940"," We're assigning an edge to a recovery rally today as outlined below."
"1101120","1104160"," Friday's expiration brought a reduction of negative gamma across the board. "
"1104320","1104900"," I agree with this."
"1105360","1106020"," It did, right?"
"1106500","1109320"," We had some gamma roll off, some negative gamma, negative puts rolling off."
"1109320","1115480"," And we'll continue to have that today Wednesday and Friday With large strips of puts being closed"
"1115480","1116440"," due to Friday's expiration. "
"1117060","1120600"," These are big banks in here Okay, they don't give a fuck what's gonna happen today."
"1120680","1125480"," They're gonna sell you a story between now Wednesday This doesn't change our forecast much, but"
"1125480","1130480"," it's interesting in that it suggests traders reduce some put exposure This is positive to here,"
"1130700","1130740"," right?"
"1131260","1136680"," You want people closing for profit wait for this ship to blow over over the week and then go long"
"1136680","1140240"," or even go short If he comes out and says some kind of nonsense."
"1140520","1146960"," We'll talk about him later, too That's Jay Powell even though puts were closed SPX IV is sharply"
"1146960","1150540"," backward dated This obviously suggests market fear. "
"1150740","1154420"," This kind of implies that Right around 30 bucks, right?"
"1154840","1161080"," We're we're we're we're we're bottoming at 30 bucks or so, but it's also a function of trapping in"
"1161080","1167240"," Long our bulls on Vix do maybe talk about that on Friday that there's we'll look at Vix today as"
"1167240","1171180"," well because Vix will stay up there people are like I want Vix to stay up there at 40 48"
"1171180","1175280"," for a day or two If you don't get that it becomes a trap."
"1175480","1176600"," It might flip up there."
"1176700","1182900"," You'd open a bunch of Vix bulls You get a quick spike up and then boom before you know it"
"1182900","1188380"," it flips back around and you're trapped inside the Vix But it also signals puts are quite expensive"
"1188380","1193380"," We see these steep put prices of deterrent for traders who are now focused on Wednesdays catalyst"
"1193380","1197640"," This could relieve some short-term pressure markets when we think results and a bit of a market"
"1197640","1202300"," recovery today and tomorrow Right can't be buying fucking puts zero day. "
"1202380","1203960"," They got zero dates out the bell today, right?"
"1204380","1205740"," It for tens off the ball."
"1205900","1206540"," They were like two bucks."
"1206660","1214390"," They're fucking no way you're buying that shit No fucking way Tried to explain this over the"
"1214390","1214550"," weekend. "
"1214550","1219430"," It's not that you can't right You always heard these arguments pass like well puts are expensive"
"1219430","1220250"," because they're valuable."
"1220370","1226130"," I'm like no no no no No, you're not buying expensive puts for a hundred percent print for a one "
"1226130","1229210","-to-one ratio Sometimes you'll see higher, right?"
"1229330","1234610"," You'll make two 300% Market sell-off that does not seem something you might make two three thousand"
"1234610","1237110"," percent something like that That's not how puts work."
"1237170","1238190"," They're protective in nature. "
"1238450","1242050"," They were built they were introduced matter of fact I don't even know if you any guys know this"
"1242050","1248670"," there was a time when you couldn't buy putts There were only calls in the market I bet you guys"
"1248670","1252790"," I've had a bunch you don't even know the history of putts right but anyways And when they did"
"1252790","1257750"," introduce them and introduce them as protection now, of course We used to make money, but they were"
"1257750","1264090"," never built fit They were not literally not built for you to be buying them and expecting stupid"
"1264090","1271830"," fucking profits from them And that's why oftentimes I don't trade put sometimes I'll do put I'll do"
"1271830","1277250"," put spreads But I don't often don't trade puts because they're not built for me to make a ton of"
"1277250","1284250"," money If when I when I if I don't own any stock right now playing some fucking stupid weed stocks"
"1284250","1292090"," and my wife bought Don't ask me But if they own any stocks anymore right now, yeah, I'd buy some"
"1292090","1298630"," puts to protect a hedge on the way down this year But she hasn't done that so whatever We see"
"1298630","1302550"," these steep put prices and turn for traders who are now focused on Wednesdays catalyst This could"
"1302550","1304210"," relieve some short-term pressure and markets."
"1305030","1313470"," We think results in a bit of market recovery today and tomorrow This is SBX firm structure All of"
"1313470","1317910"," our data continues to line up with our core themes of a stretching into a lower bound less than 420"
"1318730","1324930"," Stretching is key and large support at 4,050 The weekend brought little news of market significance"
"1325490","1330630"," We now we're now just two sessions off our key 5 for date currently FMC is the only major event"
"1330630","1338250"," for Wednesday As it appears Russia has avoided a default So they get it appears that they have They"
"1338250","1343650"," have and they haven't First in regards another thing on the Russia topic, right?"
"1344070","1350450"," There is Some risk in Russia right now There is a lot of root the rumor mill is running rampant"
"1350450","1356110"," on Russia right now in Ukraine You could see some something in the next few weeks there."
"1356570","1368130"," There's like talk of Surges coming into rush on to Ukraine There's talk of wholesale Winning"
"1368130","1368630"," by Ukraine. "
"1368890","1369490"," I'm not gonna use the words."
"1369630","1376870"," I want to use and then England as a matter of fact sent some very important missiles to Ukraine"
"1377550","1384670"," England is stepping up its equipment to Ukraine in arms With some laser-guided missiles that are"
"1384670","1385150"," pretty badass."
"1385150","1386650"," They're like stingers to an extent. "
"1386890","1391850"," They can be land sea based and In air base to they've developed over the years."
"1392130","1397250"," I'll try to send a link up to that later But there's some really heavy-duty shit going on in"
"1397250","1402370"," Ukraine right now First in regards to 4050 we height level due to large open into the 4,000 below"
"1402370","1407270"," our models show a distinct kick and gamma curves They're 4050 which applies to port in that area if"
"1407270","1409130"," we were to test 4050 pre FMC, right?"
"1409330","1415110"," This is key We anticipate about it's purely due to options positioning It comes not this comes not"
"1415110","1419850"," only from large propositions But there's a material amount of call positioning to further a visit"
"1419850","1424870"," to this area would likely correspond with another surgeon IV And we believe dealers are long till"
"1424870","1431810"," risk This means that they are getting a Vega payout Elleviating them of some of the short delta"
"1431810","1438290"," obligations in turn they can offer more liquidity which supports market IE dealers will get paid"
"1438290","1440890"," then they will long the market at that point."
"1441070","1441210"," Okay. "
"1441710","1441910"," Hey, buddy."
"1442230","1443050"," How you doing?"
"1446140","1450840"," In turn they can offer more liquidity which supports markets will aim to post this concept today"
"1451480","1455260"," The key point in this is that they're a long ball, right?"
"1455640","1460920"," The moment they can that they can monetize that right they'll add To the new risk which would be"
"1460920","1470190"," going up and that would support markets more likely in in overnight Not but"
"1470190","1475730"," not guarantee depends when we when we slam down that 4050 our opinion remains though take a true"
"1475730","1483590"," event There you go credit default trigger 4,000 before FMC Further for a move lower than 4,000 post"
"1483590","1490690"," FMC We think we'd have to see the fed come off as extra hawkish another key point in here too"
"1490690","1498930"," is If we tag 4,000 right regardless of how how I'll piss that well I don't know."
"1499010","1504090"," I guess if we I guess if we traded down a 4,000 at the fed meeting and chair pow"
"1504890","1510670"," Came out as extra hawkish you'd see it drop quickly now sometimes that news leaks early half hour"
"1510670","1516930"," two three hours Sometimes you'll see a quick spike down for a dip by to go higher if it's not"
"1516930","1525730"," hawkish Just before half hour hour before two three hours before Also with this being said here If"
"1525730","1532430"," he's not extra hawkish and you see us trading down to 4,000 any other time It's a huge support"
"1532430","1532790"," area. "
"1533070","1538030"," So if we hit 4,000 like today tomorrow anything like that You are it's not going to crash through"
"1538030","1544610"," 4,000 that ain't happening It has to be like some insider information that gets cut public Where"
"1544610","1553740"," they where they go that blasting through 4,000 Very low chance of that happening To this point"
"1553740","1558500"," we've been flagging This move vix divergence for the better part of a month and it now seems the"
"1558500","1563260"," vix is playing some catch up It didn't get fmc is a make a break trigger for either bond volatility"
"1563260","1569500"," to reduce Leading to a vix decline or vix gaps higher to catch up for the rising move index We"
"1569500","1575580"," are in the first camp The farther market declines in fmc the more of a miss that is required for"
"1575580","1583600"," the fed to trigger a stock decline IE right if we trade down into 4,000 heading into FOMC right"
"1583600","1589260"," it's going to raise the vix up And there's less of a chance of a further decline below 4,000"
"1589260","1593880"," Right we'll get the vix up high enough where the where they can make money the big boys can make"
"1593880","1600780"," money and then We trade higher now there could now let's say we don't trade out of 4,000 That"
"1600780","1606180"," would open the door for that quick slap down there Heading into f o's let's say they know the news"
"1606180","1612360"," is good at FOMC right they could then we ever notice and we sometimes will have We'll have a quick"
"1612360","1618400"," market crash right and it happens over half an hour 20 minutes That's because they know that"
"1618400","1621480"," they're not getting the news that they expect and that they haven't gotten the price that they"
"1621480","1626440"," wanted So let's say the vix doesn't get up that high at some point you might see 20 minute 30"
"1626440","1632360"," minute dump if you see that to get the vix where it needs to be if that happens hold Do"
"1632360","1641330"," not cut out cut yourself loose from that move higher In summary we were looking for a short term"
"1641330","1646290"," bounce hair markets with large direction move coming out of F 54 FOMC Well, we give an edge to a"
"1646290","1646830"," bounce today."
"1647170","1652830"," We respect the markets on relenting pressure If the spx does tag tag 4500 period today tomorrow"
"1652830","1657750"," Then we'd move from assigning an edge to a bounce to something more material Another key point here"
"1657750","1661730"," is if you're a bear out there and you're super bearish Let's see you want to short this thing in"
"1661730","1667170"," the into FOMC Once we get or let's say we get down to 4,000 or 4,500 at that"
"1667170","1673030"," point A a strata would be beautiful If you're especially if you're bearish you could take that that"
"1673030","1678670"," 380 at 360 doom and gloom Then you could take that long because either way you're going to get a"
"1678670","1683930"," large directional move You're not going to get like us sitting at 4,000 that the chance of us"
"1683930","1691910"," sitting down there at 4,000 Uh into FOMC is very low Very low you could and I would put"
"1691910","1697890"," like two weeks on it two weeks strangle way outside Not way, but outside the money by a couple"

"2111300","2116420"," The risk here is whoa I think the I think the risk is high though over time for us trading"
"2116420","2122760"," down to 360 I think that A year from now or at the end of this year, they'll be more"
"2122760","2127640"," they'll still stare at hey is inflation going down Is it not transferring are we in stagflation?"
"2127640","2134360"," Uh, is this just short term uh debt right that we're dealing with there's a long term debt And then"

"2159280","2163880"," two years That's how's people talking about their three market or four market crashes in"
"2163880","2169600"," millennials lifetime Like I don't think you're gonna see market crashes Every year or every two"
"2169600","2174680"," years or every three years They're gonna do something to try to try to to rein it in so although"
"2174680","2179500"," I I think if they weren't applying modern monetary theory sure we get a crash right here Who would"
"2179500","2184280"," have had a crash in 2002 or 2020 that wouldn't have recovered either So you probably wouldn't have"
"2184280","2189600"," been anywhere near here And then furthermore I don't understand why any of you would want a market"
"2189600","2189840"," crash. "
"2190180","2191940"," Why do why would you do it?"
"2192080","2197940"," I have a spill on that like some of you either just have never been through one Or why you"
"2197940","2205120"," would ever want to Sato massively Maybe a sadomasochist and you like the intent is we're gonna burn"
"2205120","2210240"," it all down and rebuild You don't rebuild from those events if you don't apply modern monetary"
"2210240","2214000"," theory you're stretching out the pain Uh, but I just don't understand."
"2214120","2219420"," I'm like my mind is kind of cracked out by this right now by this logic So we'll leave that"
"2219420","2220060"," alone for another time."
"2220080","2221720"," Anyway, so we're down here, right?"
"2222800","2230550"," Uh, I see this as being some kind of a bottom in the market in my view Now we're gonna"
"2230550","2235370"," tell you about some other stuff here Don't wanna hear kind of a whole bunch of stuff I wrote down"
"2238850","2242830"," Uh, you guys we're gonna go check out the uh, fomc cycles, right?"

"2253770","2260690"," I believe and then also the uh, we also have the End of the month for may two volatile events"
"2260690","2266810"," that should be down the road We'll look at the VIX here in just a moment Talk about the VIX"
"2269010","2272130"," Uh, we'll talk about why but we'll talk about rising yields, right?"
"2272450","2280890"," Uh, They are the biggest issue right now for the stock market Uh, and Of course you've seen it"
"2280890","2283010"," mostly in tech stocks, right?"
"2283210","2293080"," Not not as much as in uh, we've had energy holding up and the the sp 500 we've had consumer"
"2293080","2304860"," discretionary's XLP I value holding up the sp 500 Whereas we've seen wilder swings in tech Uh,"
"2305320","2309980"," so you have to have that then PE compression right PE multiples We'll talk about that this"
"2309980","2315980"," afternoon at some point Earnings estimates We're fucking ugly whether you like it or not amazon"
"2315980","2322980"," apple amazon apple not giving guidance no bueno Uh, we'll talk about that today and why that plays"
"2322980","2330880"," into the market trading down or continuing to trade down But not a market crash And we'll talk"
"2330880","2338340"," about tightening and financial conditions today Uh, at some point now as far as a rebound in the"
"2338340","2345740"," market Let's uh talk about a rebound in the market Where can you see a rebound in the market today?"
"2346200","2351400"," Wednesday you haven't talked much about that either So we're down here, right?"
"2351700","2353300"," We're looking to grab a bottom down here. "
"2353440","2354760"," Where can we expect?"
"2355840","2365820"," A rebound I hear people talking about 420 being"
"2365820","2366560"," a price target."
"2366560","2367540"," I think that's insane."
"2367840","2370700"," Oh I see I think it's insane. "
"2371000","2379340"," Oh I see people talking about 430 Being a price target somewhere in there I think that's insane."
"2379640","2385940"," Oh, and I think the least that you get is 440 You know, I just tagged these in here, right?"
"2386760","2390540"," Wherever we wind up here We make a move up to 420."
"2390580","2398620"," I think oh hold on a second here I think that's the least that you get the least I think"
"2398620","2408180"," 430 is Still a lower bound and I think 440 is easy on this rip I think this is rational"
"2408180","2408860"," and reasonable. "
"2408860","2415180"," It wouldn't be shocked to see 440 believe it or not And I wouldn't surprise be surprised to see it"
"2415180","2421400"," fast so that this move to be fast So you can get back into selling may, right?"
"2422080","2428480"," Come back up here and start to sell the summer off so you can get your Your 380 by end"
"2428480","2435040"," of summer and then your 360 by end of year Uh, so I don't I don't I still don't under"
"2435040","2435300"," it."
"2435300","2438760"," It's weird the compares are weird They're like well, we'll give you this but we're not giving you"
"2438760","2441780"," anything more than like 430 We're going straight down here."
"2441780","2447800"," Just just think of it from a time perspective You're not going to get you're not getting 240 by"
"2447800","2451500"," December You just not It's not going to happen. "
"2451920","2461300"," And if you did If you did it doesn't line up with a recovering economy I don't I don't see"
"2461300","2461960"," the economy."
"2462000","2462860"," You've got shortages."
"2463260","2469180"," You've got inflation I see it in a year to three years a chance of it happening But I don't"
"2469180","2476680"," I don't not see it so Uh, whatever bounce this is, right You're probably easy on 420 430 is not"
"2476680","2481540"," irrational 440 is logical And 450 would be the upper bound. "
"2481620","2486600"," Okay, so keep these train keep these levels As you buy a dip if you want to do a mix"
"2486600","2493220"," of OTM calls spreads You want to throw some shit tickets out there for 450 or something Uh heading"
"2493220","2499820"," into and are not end of may but like second third week of may For 450 just in case any"
"2499820","2504980"," many many calls something like that I don't think it's only it's crazy to be thinking about 450 up"
"2504980","2511220"," here You saw this rejection above here At 450 which is we're heading into FMC."
"2511580","2516980"," I'm going to expect us to try to at least crab that Uh with no negative news on the horizon"
"2516980","2522700"," outside of FMC in the minutes and they'll try to get there to 450 They're going to attempt to this"
"2522700","2530240"," is a little higher bound, but I don't see it being illogical to trade up to 450 Between now and"
"2530240","2538000"," uh lower after F um now an FMC in and thereafter and into the end of the month May Um"
"2540660","2547800"," Goddamn it Opets they have the monthly opets and of course the minutes So we're time to get there"
"2547800","2554380"," Uh, but 450 be my price target Uh, and of course layering in uh calls all the way up Has"
"2554380","2561620"," the next few days present themselves And you can already see this basing taking place down here."
"2561620","2568450"," This is also a trap Uh, I want you to look at Right down here. "
"2568450","2570770"," Okay Remember this is an old one."
"2570870","2578290"," So price target down below here by May 4th We have got uh 440 Uh, the intent would be that"
"2578290","2584810"," we can trade higher into this 420 into the close Maybe sell it off again Right trap some people in"
"2584810","2588750"," and head down into wednesday And then we get our rocket ship up higher."
"2588970","2589110"," Okay. "
"2589490","2593530"," This is kind of it right in here Uh, you're gonna you're gonna hear people saying we're gonna"
"2593530","2594930"," escape velocity into today."
"2595010","2601370"," It's possible Uh, the best thing to do uh would be to uh, take a long here And look for"
"2601370","2607810"," a short of some kind or a put spread of some kind into FMC Uh, and you're gonna hear you"
"2607810","2616810"," know all kinds of negative nonsense ramp up into FMC If we sell off today at any point Uh, I'm"

"3125720","3132720"," going to get trapped them for the payoff I'd rather focus on the buy side of the market Uh, there's"
"3132720","3137460"," more risk Uh in the buy side of the market or more risk in the in the uh sell side"
"3137460","3141920"," of the market here Uh more risk of being trapped and then the payoff isn't good enough."
"3142080","3147380"," I could buy I was trying to point that out this weekend that you could buy You could buy the"
"3147380","3153800"," dip down here on the spy 10 times Over the course of the next three days And just throw your"
"3153800","3159780"," money away it could burn to the ground 10 times And you'd still pay off more on the call side"
"3160340","3163580"," Uh then taking the risk so let's talk about that chase brought that up."
"3163680","3168640"," It's a good point So, uh, let's look at it from let's look at this from a different perspective"
"3169480","3176880"," It's a fair point and It's a fair point and there's good reason to be asking that question and I'm"
"3176880","3183980"," going to explain why no Uh, I I like the idea of buying some condors. "
"3184260","3187200"," This is where you'd be like, hey, yeah, especially off the bell today We talked about that on"
"3187200","3187720"," friday, right?"
"3188260","3192780"," You buy some condors where you're not going to trade and you hold them only into Tuesday or"
"3192780","3197440"," Wednesday, maybe the open a Wednesday You're not going to expect too many movements out of this"
"3197440","3202020"," area in here between you're gonna be forced in a trade in port 10 to 4 20 you might trade"
"3202020","3206460"," above it here briefly you might trade below here briefly, but you're going to be focused on this"
"3206460","3208240"," area I like that idea."
"3208580","3215140"," I don't mind the idea of buying some put spreads up here Anywhere up in here Uh, I don't mind"
"3215140","3220500"," that idea, but I wouldn't hold them either Too much longer than maybe they close a Tuesday Possibly"
"3220500","3221620"," the open of Wednesday."
"3222420","3228840"," Now even when you're doing that, here's the deal So let's say I'm complicating my trading down here"
"3228840","3231460"," and I'm going yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna get some put spreads here, right?"
"3231800","3235940"," I don't mind that idea I don't mind that idea of getting put spreads and buying every dip down"
"3235940","3241660"," below Uh, but let's just say that put spreads here my my my real thought is this that this is"
"3241660","3251620"," the area Uh for bears to get trapped Further This is an area where If I'm only focused on"
"3251620","3257860"," one thing and buying a dip down here I can buy this here And if it fails, it's okay. "
"3257880","3261900"," If I buy this here and it fails, it's okay If I buy this here and it fails, it's okay."
"3262020","3268620"," If I buy this here, I'm just focused On at least making this bet if we do blast off before"
"3268620","3274460"," we get there If I'm focused on making this bet in case we blast off here if I'm focused on"
"3274460","3283720"," making this bet if we blast off here or here The payout from this move here is going to pay"
"3283720","3293120"," greater than any put spread over here It just doesn't paint print I Can buy zero dates down here"
"3293120","3300200"," weekly's monthly's a bunch of call spreads I'm in calls right now too And I'm perfect that buck"
"3300200","3305920"," calls here And I bought them down here and I'm gonna buy them down here and I'm gonna buy them"
"3305920","3314500"," down here And if I spent 10 bucks in total here, right If I spent $10 in total here the"
"3314500","3317620"," payout is still 600 Does that make sense?"
"3319660","3328340"," I'm gonna pay 10 20 30 40 50 the payout is still 600 regardless So the money is here."
"3328520","3330360"," So why would I miss buying this call here?"
"3330940","3337800"," I wouldn't just on the off chance that we break higher Just on the off chance that It leaks the"
"3337800","3343520"," FMC meeting minutes leak Right on the off chance that it leaks over here that it leaks down here at"
"3343520","3350340"," the bell that it takes until Wednesday Probability is we're gonna trade down into FMC But either"
"3350340","3357780"," way My risk versus reward right pays off better by buying these dips heading into FMC That it ever"
"3357780","3361840"," does with me trying to get tricky with the market So down in here, it's like I am gonna buy"
"3361840","3366780"," some put spreads And then I'm gonna look for a dip buy down here on FMC, right?"
"3367180","3373640"," So let's say I make a 30% 50% 100% Down into this area first thing I'm doing"
"3373640","3379420"," is I'm risking a lot of money $2 right to buy put spreads up here two fucking dollars. "
"3379600","3387120"," That's insane Hoping for a print of $4 Some I'm putting a lot of money out."
"3387300","3393940"," I'm risking three days of being being a bear That's a long time And then I'm also risking that at"
"3393940","3399560"," any point if the news breaks that it's not that as hot ultra hot cash as they thought Uh that"
"3399560","3404840"," I could get trapped and I could miss a Face ripper in here."
"3405720","3410120"," I could be in a put spread over here Right and we could be I could be in a put"
"3410120","3410740"," spread over here. "
"3410800","3416740"," We start trading down And I'm like, oh, yeah, thankfully I haven't brought any dips yet Then we"
"3416740","3422980"," start blasting off here and and I'm like, no, it's gonna keep selling off and it doesn't it opens"
"3422980","3426320"," up here Right it doesn't and it keeps going up."
"3426460","3426560"," Meanwhile."
"3426880","3430020"," I'm just fucking around and put spreads And I miss that run higher. "
"3430380","3437680"," So just down here where we are for me I'll spend the money On my and my thesis that we're"
"3437680","3438260"," going up here."
"3438760","3439780"," This is my thesis."
"3440000","3447380"," Not your thesis my thesis And my thesis is that this prints Better and then I don't want to miss"
"3447380","3452300"," that chance now I guess the last question would be can you put some put spreads on and by the"
"3452300","3458860"," dips every time sure you can do that I just don't see the print being worth the time The risk"
"3458860","3460560"," being worth time for 100 percent. "
"3460640","3461980"," I don't care if this prints 200 percent."
"3462460","3468520"," I am not here for 200 percent I'm here right now for I'm here right now."

"3920090","3923850"," fifties four sixties I don't know about four sixties, but like four fifties seems like a pretty"
"3923850","3935700"," reasonable price place And you just hold on to a model to trade each level up a blend I"
"3935700","3939360"," want to know though, what do you guys think so like if they said four twenty if they said 25"
"3939360","3944660"," vps you'd be shitting your pants If they said 25 vp, matter of fact, I heard some guys talking"
"3945180","3947880"," There are some guys talking about how they can't even do qt."

"3973140","3973440"," way. "
"3973820","3980940"," I guess I'm um The implication is that you're you do the rate increases first and then you'll do"
"3980940","3981580"," the qt separately."
"3981580","3995090"," You can't do both same time Phasing"

"4001690","4002330"," Yeah, that's fine too."
"4002510","4008990"," I think it's fine if your cash gang mat I I think everyone has their own risk tolerance levels for"
"4008990","4015330"," where you buy the dip I think the honestly the the most probable likely the most probable likely"
"4015330","4023410"," thing that takes place In these situations the most probable Let's say and this is going to happen"
"4025170","4031410"," The most probable down in here Uh, you'll get some you're gonna get some short covering up whether"
"4031410","4032510"," you know this or not, right?"
"4033030","4039590"," As we head in any or one of these closes unless Every one of these clothes not every close On"

"4056030","4058210"," expiry because there's so many puts rolling up."
"4058310","4064210"," We don't if we don't see rolling rolling rolling nasty puts You should see some squeezes and play"
"4064210","4072070"," in here The most probable likely outcome is that we'll trade sideways in here trapping bears"
"4072710","4084730"," trapping bowls more than likely Until two one of two things happens Either the fmc leaks Early"
"4084730","4092610"," it could be Close here could be here Uh, or we just trade sideways right into usually the past it's"
"4092610","4097950"," been And Usually in the past that doesn't want to say so you supposed to this on twitter I used"
"4097950","4102689"," to be like, oh, yeah, I'm trading the opposite side of where everybody's in If everybody's in the"
"4102689","4107930"," put side of the call side, I'll trade the opposite side on fmc meetings And they've worked uh even"
"4107930","4113170"," in december when we traded down we were everybody was in calls And so we we had by bop puts"
"4113170","4116970"," and we went down for like that day I think then we went up I think it was december, but"
"4116970","4122250"," i'm not sure Uh, but you'll see everybody's loaded if everybody's loaded on wednesday and the put"
"4122250","4129310"," side in here Or the call side it will give us an indication of which where we're going Uh On"
"4129310","4136670"," wednesday It should it has in the past many times Uh, the most probable is that we trade sideways"
"4136670","4143290"," lock people in burn a bunch of early bulls burn a bunch of uh, late bears And then we get"
"4143290","4152890"," a decision and we rocket ship up or down from here Um Um, yeah, we can write a ship down"
"4152890","4160330"," to you i'm not i'm not opposed to trading down but It's it's highly unlikely It's highly and i find"
"4160330","4164330"," it hard just i find it hard to think that the that j-pos gonna be like fuck it. "
"4164410","4168830"," Let's crash the market I don't think that's his intent."
"4170670","4177189"," I think he likes the idea of us being down at four thousand Into half of c so he can"

"6653150","6659210"," fail not that not a dive in the market, but Uh, maybe a ripper at the end of the day"
"6659210","6662850"," I don't know if it's end of day, but it wouldn't shock me to see a ripper at the end"
"6662850","6669250"," of the day Even if it's just on a not to 430 that's called like 420 or something Just burning"
"6669250","6677880"," options then boom we get up there and we actually rocket ship up Um Some interest in this trade"
"6677880","6685340"," right now And you can see the dip buying down below one and two and the even so these sellers"
"6685340","6691660"," were weakened over here There aren't a lot of sellers left Uh, we are currently so between now and"
"6691660","6701550"," close Usually I would usually I would say that buyers here are weak And never like seeing"
"6701550","6708610"," buyers like not be able to consolidate and make a rip higher I never like seeing rejection Yeah, we"
"6708610","6712610"," can we come in this you're going to see a lot of sellers be like Uh double top right here"
"6712610","6718690"," double top right there and they were hidden down Uh that could play out, but The way this one's"
"6718690","6726050"," setting up it's Um The one the one thing in the bull's side in this trade today is that you've"
"6726050","6735430"," got Shitloads of puts rolling off here I'm telling you if if if those puts roll off today Uh, there"
"6735430","6740710"," will be no need to hedge those puts today, which will add fire to a vanna rally Even if it's"
"6740710","6746310"," only for one quick day So keep your eyes on this as this trades here Um, if you if you"
"6746310","6750630"," do start to see the put monetization down in here You what the other thing too is that's here hold"
"6750630","6755790"," and puts down here Well, you end up seeing is uh, they just lose value in the day And they"
"6755790","6760390"," have to close them out at some point Now if we just fade sideways and the bell most puts expire"
"6760910","6768470"," Could just be some more blast off in the overnight too Um Yeah, at some point could be 415 where"
"6768470","6774690"," you buy some zero date calls here So if you don't see that blast off today, um If this just"
"6774690","6781250"," grinds all over the bell Um Zero dates after the bell believe it or not four o'clock Some kind"
"6781250","6787630"," of nonsense like that if it stays down here into the bell Uh Dealers would definitely be buying"
"6787630","6794810"," futures into tomorrow Even if it trades back down just this move up what it's going to take place"
"6794810","6799230"," at some it's going to take place for whatever Um Was closed out today."
"6799230","6806070"," Just keep your eye on it Uh Normally I would say this is very bearish But with these with these"
"6806070","6815290"," puts expiring today, I don't know And we're not also seeing We're not also we're also not seeing"
"6815290","6820830"," like massive sellers up in here right now Um, even with that even with this quick rollover right"
"6820830","6821010"," here. "
"6821050","6821830"," What's this right here?"
"6822010","6823610"," Even if they'll look like rollover right here."
"6823910","6830390"," So the rollover is it's not really um Overly bearish right now I'm looking for like a big giant red"
"6830390","6836430"," bar and you can usually see them like this one you can see right See this one at 4.20"
"6836430","6842090"," above here you can see it right comes right into play Those are large sellers right just ready to"
"6842090","6848090"," sell the right up here And we had them at the open down here Uh, but I'm not seeing them"
"6848090","6849030"," right in here where we are."
"6849190","6858530"," So this interests me for the there's there's some bullish taste to be made here Uh in your and so"
"6858530","6865530"," that is going to leave me to think that uh, these squeezes Are short covering in here the this"
"6865530","6869810"," right or this right here is short covering so when you see this That's a short covering These are"
"6869810","6874790"," minor short coverings, but it wouldn't be surprised it wouldn't surprise me at some point see Uh,"
"6875070","6879290"," you have a large short covering in monetization of puts we wrote we wrote run higher. "
"6879470","6889160"," This is bold more bullish than bears um To some extent Time up their short-lived."
"6889340","6893840"," I don't know what they are I don't know when when or how but I but I want i'm interested"
"6893840","6900340"," to see if these if real sellers step it I'm not seeing real sellers right now Um see more buyers"
"6900340","6907340"," than sellers right now buyers seem to be just buying all these tips down here Uh Some interested to"
"6907340","6911340"," see if we get that squeeze it's a squeeze setup even if it doesn't squeeze there This is a squeeze"
"6911340","6928460"," setup Uh more so than market weakness Some interest and this is the day progresses Unless"
"6928460","6933720"," they're hiding we could we might not see these sellers they could be up here Well, you can see them"
"6933720","6934740"," pouring it on right now."
"6934740","6940400"," They're they're triggering it right now, but All right, this isn't this isn't this is looking like"
"6940400","6948020"," short covering Is what it looks like I know I know if you're if you're out there if you're out"
"6948020","6950340"," there and you're a bull and you're like It's like bearish. "
"6950480","6956300"," This looks like short covering Uh So if you have more short covering at some point you could get"
"6956300","6963220"," some nice fat triggers to run it up higher At some point today or into the bell And if there's"
"6963220","6971720"," if there's no need to Edge of this stuff It could be a like a quick van rally Maybe not"
"6971720","6980890"," van uh, maybe like a van rally On the on the daily At some point they're not going to tell"
"6980890","6990460"," you when they do it, but if they if they pull that trigger Um Seems like everybody's waiting for it"

"8134780","8139700"," what you have a rally like that you get back up in here Well, it's gonna fuck some people up"
"8161680","8165780"," Take this out a little bit this kind of what i was talking about on the vix last friday was"
"8169780","8181220"," Really what bears need is they need They need like 40 Not"
"8181220","8188280"," 40 I should say problem up here is if it's like up and down Um, this is where it does"
"8188280","8192600"," a bear trap up here believe it or not or a bull trap bear in the market bull and uh"
"8193940","8200780"," It's happened so fast sometimes that you want it to stay up there for some time You want to be"
"8200780","8207690"," like one two three days you don't want to be like 30 seconds up there And to be honest as"
"8207690","8213770"," a bull i'd love to see it up there I would love that because this this gives you a great"
"8213770","8222459"," opportunity to long the market The vix isn't really built for that it's the vix is built to short"
"8224240","8230660"," The vix originally was built to give an indicator Of you know a volatility in the market entering"
"8230660","8235420"," the market but then of course people and people are people usually just train it to sell But the"
"8235420","8243480"," interesting part is everyone's long ball here And of course they don't want to pay it so like"
"8243480","8251740"," everybody's long and ball in here They're breaching to 46 48 something like that and they don't"
"8251740","8258930"," want to fucking pay it But we've had vix products go go uh bankrupt on both sides even on the"
"8258930","8264750"," other side of it We've actually had vix uh vix parks built bankrupt over shit like this So that's"
"8264750","8269129"," my only concern in here is do they get up there to print just a little bit of it trap"
"8269129","8278219"," the rest of you Is the real trade here up here at four four or 46 48 Or is the"
"8278219","8287320"," real trade just waiting for this to get tagged So you can take it down Or is there a bigger"
"8287320","8293240"," trade over time is there like So i'm not so i think my point is that the trade here was"
"8293240","8299620"," to buy this down here Buy this down here buy this down here buy this down here But there's late"
"8299620","8304400"," to the party that people are like hey we hit it once we hit it again And this right here"
"8304400","8308480"," is another example of right you're like fuck it We're going all the way up and it didn't and so"
"8308480","8314980"," they're this is where the trap was somewhere in here We're kind of back there again So i'm not"
"8314980","8320959"," saying that we don't go up to 46 but even if we do or 48 It's very it's very sketchy"
"8320959","8328080"," Uh, and i think i said that's weekend like because it's meant to short so If you're a vix trader"
"8328080","8334299"," out there i liked the trade up to here Or maybe you leave a little bit on but then what"
"8334299","8334700"," are you doing?"
"8334879","8340059"," You're sitting in front of a computer all day long hoping that you can monetize That last little"
"8340059","8351049"," bit Rather just sit here and hope that it gets up there at a minimum to 37 55 And"
"8351049","8362760"," hope that it gets to 46 31 but not so not so long it but to actually short it I"
"8362760","8370379"," mean that's a huge fucking move right there You see what would have to happen That's some that's"
"8370379","8379580"," some crazy shit right there it's 2020 back here and we're already up Like $41 already up."
"8380080","8383580"," We know though that people are along the vix that's the only thing the other thing too with this"
"8383580","8393580"," backwardation shit to you get People are along the vlog wall Um So you've got money loading into"
"8393580","8404200"," it right so that's why it's elevated But even though it's elevated it's really"
"8404200","8410520"," is that it's really asking a lot up here Even though it's been bought and even though it's elevated"
"8410520","8424130"," it's really asking a lot Need some pretty gigantic moves in the market Let's"
"8424130","8427790"," see the point Dude this move here, right?"
"8428090","8430830"," I think this move here Was like a 65."
"8431390","8433330"," No, I'm sorry 36% move. "
"8433410","8433890"," Okay."
"8434130","8434610"," Let me do this check."
"8434990","8439590"," I'm only measured in the background I'm saying 65% move. "
"8439630","8445110"," I'm gonna look though I Compete the trough in 2020."
"8445690","8452340"," It was like I think it was 36% This is just off the top of my head."
"8452400","8457820"," I'm trying to get remember this shit without For that I know it was a trade that caused a plaque"
"8458520","8468100"," Crash in european socks on monday placed by city group So city group This is that the trade Create"
"8468100","8498900"," involved erroneous calculation rulings these companies And"
"8498900","8503580"," that leaves support seeing the erroneous trade that caused flash crack and crash in european stocks"
"8504340","8514280"," Earlier today was placed by city group So"
"8514280","8515660"," city group made erroneous calculation. "
"8515660","8520220"," It was a mistake It's like this trade right here."
"8520260","8529930"," So back in um It was a 35.71% move in the spy"
"8529930","8531250"," from peak to trough."
"8531550","8531990"," So I'm close. "
"8532330","8538910"," I said 36% Well, I think if originally I said 65% but I was meaning 36% or"
"8538910","8543070"," whatever I'm going to get my numbers flipped around on me and then of course I correct myself"
"8543070","8554600"," before looking but I did just look Um and we're down Hold on here I"
"8554600","8561820"," From peak to trough So like any of them so like we're only down."
"8562020","8562860"," What are we down right now?"
"8563280","8565640"," 10 or 12% since january or something."
"8569080","8577880"," So a trade high or even the 46 Up in up in here like 46 They would imply another like"
"8577880","8587470"," five or five or six percent move down like the next two days on the spy I"
"8587470","8597470"," guess that correlates to this to the end of the NASDAQ I guess that correlates to uh NASDAQ"
"8620720","8622420"," Getting some weirdness in my charts there. "
"8622580","8630240"," Nothing's really working today Nice little double top right now calls to call this uh little uh"
"8630240","8641490"," bullwedge down here Once looks good double top Bam bam bam So"
"8641490","8641970"," It's bullish."
"8642190","8642850"," This is the bullish move."
"8643190","8645630"," Just so if you don't know this you probably do. "
"8645770","8655730"," This is a bullish move right here Trying to blast up higher This is the VIX You could measure"
"8655730","8656410"," this on your own."
"8656530","8660770"," I'm not going to do it for you here, but you can measure this This is a swing."
"8661350","8662150"," Well, it's not swing a little bit. "
"8662270","8662830"," This swing here."
"8662950","8667950"," You'd expect some kind of a move like that above And that put that your that put that your 46"
"8667950","8672950"," on the VIX I mean the charts kind of look on the on the surface the charts kind of look"
"8672950","8687240"," like uh You go there to get crazy and nasty This"
"8687240","8696190"," is a gun for the that's the bulls are gunning for That ripper maybe if you measured this right here"
"8696190","8706250"," it matched right up here too I moved the 46 on on the VIX Question is Does"
"8706250","8707130"," it relate to the market?"
"8707650","8714940"," Going down with it even though we get the VIX up there with that back rotation Whereas this is like"
"8714940","8716740"," a natural spot right now for the VIX."
"8716760","8720520"," It might not correlate people are asking this morning Why is the VIX going up in the markets up?"
"8721100","8724500"," It might not correlate with the VIX slop in that 46 or 48. "
"8724840","8729680"," I'm interested in this trade on the in the inverse I'm interested in the i'm shorting the VIX up"
"8729680","8736030"," here I'm interested in taking this trade if we can get up here even if the market goes up if"
"8736030","8739730"," people ask up here Shorting the VIX at 46."
"8740210","8749120"," Keep your eye on this trade as we head into FOMC Keep your eyeballs on it Set an alert up"
"8749120","8757160"," here I would set the alert at uh, you know at 40 call it 41 34 set an alert Create"
"8757160","8761860"," alert if it gets up there If it's like a really fast like boom we move up that it's like"
"8761860","8773280"," 30 seconds or a half a day or something It's a great place to to sell the VIX a"
"8773280","8782580"," little weakness Little weakness inside of the spy right now Still by the dippers down below here"
"8784800","8791040"," See if it holds I'm interested in shorting the VIX alike It's like I don't know if it gets up"
"8791040","8800160"," to 44 or 46, but if it does If it trades independently of wherever the spy is I'm interested in"
"8800160","8809340"," shorting that down What else is interested"
"8809340","8816740"," in interesting in that trade is that we go right back to that, uh, January 24th Now that we looked"
"8816740","8826670"," at on uh, the spy and And uh, NASDAQ And"
"8826670","8835700"," I bet you this short down was was a banger this paid well And this can move without the indexes"
"8835700","8839780"," moving so if You see set alert up here at 44."
"8840160","8844500"," I'm not saying it's going up there, but if it does On the off chance was a 44 46 anything"
"8844500","8854180"," like that uh, you you take a, um, OTM call for our city OTM put for 25 bucks That'd be"

"9113120","9113700"," 2022."
"9113740","9114540"," This is a year."

"9154940","9156640"," it's down at 121 or 94."
"9157180","9168420"," I don't think it's that deep maybe You"
"9168420","9169800"," can see where the weakness is, right?"
"9170940","9180040"," The fucking weakness is made the bearishness the market is IWM the most bearish probably IWM Even"
"9180040","9186620"," more bearish than it's tech believe it or not Probably the most bearish index out there. "
