"8070","9530"," Check wall 2."
"26840","39010"," Some weird feedback"
"39010","39850"," going on."
"45490","47430"," Good morning, hey, what are you doing out there?"
"48810","51210"," Let's get some weirdness in the background."
"52930","56850"," Let's get right into it and just a second here I got some stuff here I got to do in"
"56850","57250"," the background. "
"65360","66780"," Take it more and how's everybody doing?"
"69140","70560"," We just a second here."
"71460","72980"," Got a couple of things I got to do here in the background."
"85050","86150"," How are y'all doing?"
"86150","86970"," How was your weekend?"
"88230","90010"," You guys making money?"
"91850","99230"," So we got to talk about just a few things here. "
"99370","101410"," We've got some grinding to do here."
"101870","103870"," You see these yellow marks right here?"
"103950","104770"," These are all pivots."
"104770","110410"," There's one here, there's one here, here, and here. "
"111530","114710"," So there's some revenge trading going on in here."
"116770","125330"," We'll talk about where we are, we'll talk about where we're headed, that kind of stuff."
"125330","134250"," It seems like I have a feeling, let's see here, newest,"
"135210","142210"," how do I word this,"
"144900","152360"," let me see the best"
"152360","155820"," way to word this. "
"155820","165580"," So when we wrapped up last week, who said it, it was, I"
"165580","169540"," think it was Hooligan, he put it the best way."
"172960","182860"," He said, I saw his post after Friday close, and let me put the"
"182860","191720"," live stream up on Twitter I don't know if it was Hooligan or the foot, one of those guys put"
"191720","194720"," it pretty succinctly."
"196020","206040"," From reading Finn to it, I tended to agree where it was, the"
"206040","212020"," thought process on Friday Friday was, we should get a roll, right?"
"212280","219060"," It's end of month into the 19th and 21st, right?"
"219240","221700"," It's pretty standard even in a bull run to get a roll. "
"224100","232380"," It's not like out of the ordinary, where your expectations, what are your expectations on that roll"
"232380","239020"," though, is important, how much downside can you expect in that roll?"
"241360","245180"," So we're in a bull market run, whatever you want to call it, right?"
"245920","255760"," And you're going to expect some sort of consolidation typically into these"
"255760","260560"," dates, right?"
"260560","265240"," Right around the 19th, 21st, I don't know if you know that or not, but typically it's somewhere in"
"265240","274660"," there you'll find a bottom saying that, so I'll take a look at Spy right now."
"279870","285870"," So we have today's Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, right?"
"288170","291350"," So we've got Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"291350","301240"," So just this week here, now we had a high on Friday, 451, 36, you saw the seller"
"301240","308700"," step in on Friday and that meant the question right, do they step back in again?"
"311600","315740"," Do we do an orderly sell down into the 21st?"
"317840","327920"," And as I always say here to you, as I always say here to you, time,"
"328320","334180"," right, it's always time and you need, you only get so much time to go down, right?"
"335080","344800"," So if you're not getting the downsized moves that you're expecting, like you need to go down with"
"344800","354580"," some meaningfulness, if you want, if you're a south side and you want some meaningful"
"354580","361320"," downside moves, you want 30, 70 points, you want three, four to four percent of a pullback"
"361320","365520"," something like that, you can't have the open that we had today, can you?"
"367360","374040"," You can't have this big swoop up, and what's crazier the hair is, this is where the alley trigger"
"374040","383640"," is, so you've got a trend day on the open, whoop, and now you're just waiting for a confirmation"
"383640","385760"," for more moves higher, right?"
"386060","392420"," Go back and take all this stuff out, even if there is a roll down, so even on the open"
"392420","397740"," today, sellers, no joy, right?"
"398380","404140"," This really isn't joy for, I know if you're south side this is not what you want, you don't want"
"404140","409960"," to see this at all, you can say it's a double top, you can say there'll be a failure here,"
"410100","415320"," you can say whatever you want, this is not what you want to see today, in any way shape or"
"415320","421740"," form, and to that point, you saw Apple this morning was cranking, I saw Apple cranking this"
"421740","431400"," morning, this looks like rotation again doesn't it, this doesn't look like a risk off behavior does"
"431400","438940"," it, and then you've got earning season right, and we've got some economic news coming up, we've got"
"438940","448720"," the Fed coming out from that kind of stuff, before they head out to you know what it makes me"
"448720","455080"," feel like, it makes me, if you guys know what the dog days of summer on a bull run, it's"
"455080","463880"," like, there's like, ball crush to the upside, and to the downside, it becomes these lazy days where"
"463880","475090"," you look for a dip to buy and you buy them, hey Joey what's up brother, well that's"
"475090","483310"," right, hey pal I forgot, so pypl, I'll talk about that in a few moments and TAL, I'll talk about"
"483310","487930"," that as well, I'll do that in the next five minutes, okay, I promise you I'd do that, I told"
"487930","497930"," you on Twitter I'd do that right, Antco, hey what's going on Willie, yeah you know it's"
"497930","502310"," weird, I like the sworn I was in the phone with Joe, and you know he's like, I'm off doing"
"502310","507910"," this, I'm off doing that, I think people are just, it's like summer time, he got banged up this"
"507910","513510"," week, I was busy dude, this whole weekend has been run here, run there, run here, oh matter of"
"513510","523030"," fact, you guys that donated last week, got my kids tickets to Barbie, and they got like super"
"523030","528250"," pink clothes for it, so I bought them a bunch of clothes, they'll have pictures for you guys out"
"528250","534210"," there, so it was hilarious, they were looking at pink clothing, and they had like, they weren't"
"534210","540950"," wearing, they weren't or they weren't trying on Barbie pink, and I was like, no no no no no, I"
"540950","546490"," was like, yeah if you're gonna go to Barbie and wear pink, it better be like Barbie pink, like you"
"546490","552150"," own that shit, it should have like a battery pack in the back or something, and so they got a"
"552150","558290"," bunch of great clothes, so we'll have some pictures and stuff for that, you weren't interested, how"
"558290","558490"," are you?"
"562830","565810"," Yeah, we'll take, you know what, we'll look at them right, you're here right now, we'll just get it"
"565810","573490"," out of the way, so we'll look at PayPal, and we'll look at, we'll look at PayPal, and we will"
"573490","583210"," look at a couple more here, so just full disclosure, I am long PayPal, so if you're like, I don't"
"583210","590310"," want you to think that I don't have anything to say about this stuff, some of you out there already"
"590310","598830"," know that when we were down here in PayPal, that it was a no-brainer to buy it down here,"
"598850","605210"," it's like 60 bucks or something like that, this is one of those trades where, you know, it's not a"
"605210","611230"," good one to have an added get was, I have to add to ATT, we'll look at ATT as well"
"611230","620750"," today, so like I've got, I've got Budweiser and I've got Tyson Foods,"
"621590","628810"," these are all, these are all like a core,"
"629430","636270"," they're gonna sell chicken tenders right, we know that, like we know, we know they're gonna sell"
"636270","645190"," Budweiser, you know that when you put the noise away, and sickly you see some of these tickers, you"
"645190","650150"," know they're not going bankrupt, you know PayPal's not going bankrupt, so when you have a chance to"
"650150","660150"," buy tickers like this, you take it right, and these are the kind of things"
"660150","669930"," where, they're speculative but not quite really speculative, it's like a trade where you feel"
"669930","675750"," good owning it, Tesla down at 100 bucks was like that, we had a discussion Winky and I were"
"675750","683450"," chatting once in a stream and Winky's not a fan of Tesla, but we had a conversation about yeah but"
"683450","688070"," what would you own it at, and I think there even a lot of bears in our stream at that,"
"688230","693790"," that day when we talked about it that we're like yeah I'd still buy it there, and these are, this"
"693790","701710"," is one of those tickers, PayPal 60 bucks, if it went down to 30 I'd just DCA, you know what"
"701710","706270"," I mean, it's like one of those things where, if Tesla went from 90 or 100 down to 60 bucks,"
"706590","713770"," no big deal, I'll just add another brick to the pile, and PayPal is like that for me, now saying"
"713770","721710"," all that, we're in a place with PayPal that is extremely bullish, now even though it's extremely"
"721710","731070"," bullish, I want to bring your attention over here to a couple of things, so it's trade 32 ish on"
"731070","736710"," Vellow, it can go higher, Vellow can go higher in this one, though I do want to bring your"
"736710","743750"," attention to right where we are, so follow my cursor over here, and there's likely more move"
"743750","752910"," possible to the upside, and I'm okay even with this drawdown here, if we get more drawdown from"
"752910","758530"," this move, there's likely, I don't know who you are, I forgot your Twitter name for you asking, but"
"758530","768490"," is there where you should have bought, probably no, you"
"768490","773950"," should have been buying down here, right, so I'm going to assume that you're looking for a payoff,"
"774570","782730"," which I would expect you are, I am, I'm looking for a payoff, and then a nice pullback to buy,"
"783030","790030"," so if you're not, you're not already long on PayPal, you can get in, I would just take your money"
"790030","798830"," and run quicker than payout, I want to own this here, but I guess I say that, but there's a"
"798830","808410"," stronger move here ahead, and this is a very key point, whenever this upside move is, if there's a"
"808410","819260"," confirmation here, this move right, this move right here is the more powerful move, this would"
"819260","827800"," confirm sustained upside, you've seen me sometimes talk about kiss trades,"
"828520","835580"," so you guys remember when I said, oh there's some, I was like, there's some tickers out there that"
"835580","840960"," whatever that pullback is on them, if they confirm the upside move, they become very powerful, and"
"840960","848060"," I want to show you a couple here, so you've got to squeeze up right, you get great for take"
"848060","855620"," the money and run, run right, notice how it didn't hold here, squeeze, notice how it didn't hold"
"855620","862700"," here, but when we get moves like this, we break above and we confirm that move, one, two, boom"
"862700","871480"," right, this is great structure here, and these they're very positive, another key point to here is,"
"871760","880200"," do you, I want you to see, look at something very closely here, and this is a weekly right, coming"
"880200","883840"," down, coming down, coming down, and you got this little hook right there, see that little hook up,"
"884180","894120"," this is showing a weekly trend reversal to the upside in PayPal, it's very bullish, and for multi "
"894120","900600","-weeks, now you're still waiting for one more confirmation, you're still waiting for, you know, this"
"900600","906680"," kind of move here, whatever explosive move is, there is there, this comeback down to Jesus moment"
"906680","913620"," or whatever you want to call it, but this is where it becomes sustained in here, so yeah you can"
"913620","919060"," take this for a trip higher, but there's a moment where you're gonna need to pull, you're gonna"
"919060","922900"," need to pull a plug on the trade, if you're trying to enter right here, and you're gonna be looking"
"922900","932040"," for this part of the trade for the continuation, so if you're long right now, I want you to know"
"932040","941640"," that there's a take-profit moment, and there's also some kind of a consolidation moment"
"941640","949900"," for an extended move higher, we're gonna, I'm gonna show you some guys something today too on this"
"949900","957340"," because we're gonna talk a little bit about, we're gonna look at inflation I think today and just"
"957340","966260"," see how long this market can trade higher, but yeah, do I like PayPal here, I love it, you want"
"966260","973900"," to know what I have for targets, I want you to know that this zone right here, there's a lot"
"973900","983620"," of traps, buyers here, right, there's some trap buyers up here as these are recent"
"983620","990780"," trap buyers though, so I'm not women's back in March, but these guys here are gonna want to get"
"990780","996400"," out, they're likely people that are trapped in this trade right here from March that just want to"
"996400","1003420"," get out, okay, guaranteed, so you're gonna have a pullback in here, and it's gonna take some work"
"1003420","1009940"," to get through these these trap buyers, I bet you those people, I bet you those people in this"
"1009940","1019920"," stream that are trapped in here, they're not gonna tell you that publicly, and all they want"
"1019920","1025280"," is out, they don't care, you know, we know how this happens, right, and then once we get above they"
"1025280","1030260"," want to get back in, then it rolls back over, right, get up there finally, and then it rolls back"
"1030260","1034599"," over there caught again, but maybe not right there, but you get my point, so there's some work to"
"1034599","1040920"," be done in here, a lot of volatility in here, a lot of grinding to get through, but I am"
"1040920","1051260"," bullish past here to get one more right there, you got one more right there, upside"
"1051260","1060830"," targets for me, truth, you got a lot of falling here, like vol, right, or trap sellers,"
"1060850","1067670"," trap sellers, a lot of work to be done in here, this looks like that summer trade too, we'll go"
"1067670","1072910"," back to this, well, we'll readdress this summer trade at some point, but the summer trade is a"
"1072910","1078430"," weird, not weird, it just dog days of summer, right, you find a dip, you buy it, you hold, and"
"1078430","1083590"," it eventually prints for you, a lot of work to get through here, you got that work, you got like"
"1083590","1093470"," all this work, ultimately price target $100, I think that's a, that's an easy one, an easy tag, you"
"1093470","1099230"," know the squeeze is above it though, and look right there, there's the squeeze 114, on a monthly"
"1099230","1109090"," basis, you might get 110, probably top out at 110, a lot of hard work needs done in here,"
"1109410","1115910"," you know, this is one of those things where you buy, don't look at it, sell puts below, kind of"
"1115910","1123330"," a trade, that's my, that's my take on PayPal, next we're gonna look at is, what was it, was a"
"1123330","1132910"," TAL, I forget which one he asked for, but I'm bullish on it generally, I don't know if, I hope,"
"1133070","1143010"," I don't know if this one, anybody know what the, you look up, I want to make sure"
"1143010","1154440"," this isn't a low-flow ticker, I mean"
"1158250","1163310"," there's a great trade here, I can tell you that, it's setting up a giant squeeze, you can already"
"1163310","1180210"," see it right, there's the"
"1180210","1192990"," other side of it right there, something like"
"1192990","1200990"," that, it's TAL, I hope this, I hope this, you're not pumping dump on me on this ticker, there is"
"1200990","1210750"," something cool here to see, this is very similar to PayPal, but I want you to see something"
"1210750","1220490"," close here, okay, you've got daily trigger bought across the weekly, price though is"
"1220490","1227890"," below the hourly, and this is a key point, see this hourly coming down, this is a good sign right"
"1227890","1235910"," here, I like seeing the hourly in the bottom, it just, this implies that this negativity is fake,"
"1237150","1250830"," and it's likely gonna be a big squeeze higher, I'd"
"1250830","1259770"," say you can stay long in here, on you can buy like 620,"
"1259770","1269410"," 623, see this squeeze right here, I never really like these, I always like, I always like, I always"
"1269410","1278850"," like the slow grind, and then the eventual lift off, I'm not bullish on it right at this moment, I"
"1278850","1284090"," want to see it hold, and I really want to see it break above the hourly, like I really want"
"1284090","1294650"," to see like, I want to see price get above, so"
"1294650","1302730"," I'm not actually bullish on at the moment, I'm gonna raise this up too, I want to see price above"
"1302730","1312670"," 634, 640, you see it right here, I want to see that happen, and I want to see"
"1312670","1320450"," price confirm, I come back down, and stay above this hourly, for the real move higher,"
"1321070","1330550"," so I'm not bullish at the moment, and I'm betting that this is a very volatile trade, I'm not"
"1330550","1340340"," bullish here, I need to see more constructive, but I see, I see the point that you're"
"1340340","1352560"," looking for, you're looking for a pretty big move to the upside here, 815,"
"1352560","1362380"," failure here likely, 941, take your money on 815, but do not get trapped in here, you"
"1362380","1366960"," don't want to you don't want to like see some bullshit like this, and then there's your real move,"
"1367660","1376700"," so the hourly trigger is gonna matter here, tight stops at $6 "
"1376700","1386680",".20, $5.60"
"1386680","1400030"," I like to, like a stink bid down in here for like 4 a.m. or"
"1400030","1407730"," both, this is a pumping up or not, I haven't looked at the data on it, got a downgrade May"
"1407730","1417250"," 1st by UBS by neutral price target, it hit it, let me see,"
"1417750","1426410"," I don't know what it's earning, I'm looking right now to see what I can find out about it, price"
"1426410","1436110"," to our target price, $7.33, no, it's going higher, it's going higher than that, I can assure you of"
"1436110","1445730"," that, Ray Dalio's"
"1445730","1453350"," China stocks, July 27th, so"
"1453350","1462350"," they get 10 trade down here, ER"
"1462350","1469630"," has a bad ER, you'll see price got in half, lower than that, see that, they want you to see"
"1469630","1478270"," this, like stuff like this down here, I was just trading $2.82, this can easily,"
"1478890","1488210"," easily on a bad ER, trade three bucks again, so be very"
"1488210","1494830"," careful, like a market limit, I don't know if it's a market, well you can't do a market limit sell"
"1494830","1510210"," on this one, there could be a, this might be a trap for buyers, yet"
"1510210","1519130"," TAL, this is a very dangerous ticker to buy, as a matter of fact this is a, this is nothing"
"1519130","1526470"," that I would ever trade, this is nothing I would buy, and this is only something that I would day"
"1526470","1534070"," trade with a screener up all day long, I gotta say that to you, would not fuck with this unless"
"1534070","1544410"," you know like something like this happens, it's news driven, too dangerous, no"
"1544410","1550990"," way would I want to be down 50% on it, this stock hallucinative percentage value like snap a finger"
"1550990","1559010"," is done, now you want me to look at Rivian for you next, hope you guys made money, did you"
"1559010","1566190"," guys take that tussle trade, you know so here's a good one for you, so someone just said Rivian"
"1566190","1572110"," bloodbath right, not really the case here, it's not a bloodbath for Rivian, I don't want you to"
"1572110","1582170"," think that it is, it's not Elon, this is a set, this is the PayPal set up, so"
"1582170","1586810"," when you see this right, I was just saying this about PayPal right, I was just saying this about"
"1586810","1594090"," PayPal, so you get the cross, I'll go back and show you PayPal, PayPal's doing the same thing, the"

"3164190","3169830"," a lot of work to get through right here, see all that supply, does that mean you can't go higher,"
"3170030","3177330"," no, just means I want to I want to put the fucking money in the bank bro, thanks the money"
"3177330","3187110"," in the bank, if you want to go higher, let's talk about where we are right here, so if you're"
"3187110","3192130"," of the mind where you're like yeah leave some runners on, why bother, you just get something"
"3192130","3201970"," cheaper, like I got it, like we have some bizarre shit that happens, we like"
"3201970","3210050"," bizarre shit that happens, I get people that are like, I was having a conversation this weekend and"
"3210050","3219930"," I was like shit I blew up my account or blew up today or I'm down heavy and I'm like"
"3219930","3225450"," how can you be down heavy, like how do you like make three great trades in one bad trade let's"
"3225450","3234430"," say right, let's say you make four trades, you got one two, hold on let me change the color of"
"3234430","3242610"," this, so you got one two three and four trades right,"
"3242990","3249810"," let's say you got this one's great, this one's great, this one's horrible, and this one is great,"
"3250050","3259970"," what's fascinating is I'm betting that like here I turned a"
"3259970","3268710"," thousand into two thousand right, so I'm betting that you take that two thousand and you're like"
"3268710","3277830"," full tits two thousand second trade, now it's six thousand and then you're six grand right here"
"3277830","3285790"," trying to get 12 or something, it blows up and you've got no juice for this trade here, so I'm"
"3285790","3292530"," wondering sometimes, I'm wondering sometimes if it's like are you doing like full roll, are you"
"3292530","3302370"," like rolling everything into the next trade, are you, so if I"
"3302370","3307410"," buy a call or put it doesn't matter, let's say I buy a call for a dollar and it goes"
"3307410","3317030"," to my price target that I want to hit, let's say it goes to two dollars, like I get the"
"3317030","3326950"," idea of leaving runners on, so like let's say I price target boom right, let's"
"3326950","3336770"," say this is a dollar, now let's say it's two dollars, I"
"3336770","3345790"," don't know why you wouldn't monetize that, put the dollar in your pocket right, you just you just"
"3345790","3354370"," took a dollar and you're gonna quote unquote leave some runners on or quote unquote, you're still"
"3354370","3363970"," bullish to grind through all this crap, okay, but why wouldn't you buy a 20 cent call or a, why"
"3363970","3371650"," would you go back in for like, or maybe I'm wording that wrong, but if your thesis is higher, you"
"3371650","3380150"," renegotiate the trade, maybe you buy something cheaper or something like that, that point, like"
"3380150","3389470"," realizing profit is a good thing and renegotiating a price is a good thing, like all in, all in,"
"3389530","3394270"," all in, you're gonna blow up, there's no, there's no two, there's not even a question about it,"
"3394530","3404570"," you're gonna blow up, so I think about that oftentimes on holding overnight, I used to, like"
"3404570","3412150"," a directional trade, I would, I would hold sometimes and I would notice like, maybe I like a dollar"
"3412150","3417890"," trade or something, go to two dollars on the opening next day, and then the, the, the option chain"
"3417890","3427250"," would be reprised and I would lose my entire trade, even if directionally went that direction, so I"
"3427250","3430050"," don't know, I don't know, I don't know what the answer is, I was thinking about that over the"
"3430050","3435210"," weekend, I saw people that were getting torched, like that Tesla trade, made a bunch of money on a"
"3435210","3442510"," Tesla trade on Friday, then I bought more for 20 cents, and I went, had a 60 cent trade, I"
"3442510","3449230"," think go to a dollar 26 or something, and then I bought some 20 cent calls, and someone in the"
"3449230","3455990"," stream said, I just got torched, and I was like, what, like how, like, how are you taking 60 cents,"
"3455990","3464190"," and then you should still be at 40 cents, so I don't, I don't know how you're getting blown up,"
"3465250","3469690"," the only way that I can, maybe to see that happening would be you're just like rolling 100%,"
"3469690","3470830"," rolling 100%. "
"3478130","3481430"," Oh am I talking to you, I don't know, I don't know if I'm talking to you or not, I'm"
"3481430","3490470"," talking about, I guess the greater conversation is, looking at your trade a log, right?"
"3490850","3496190"," You're like, give me a trader log where you're like, I look at mine, I'm like, where am I losing"
"3496190","3497390"," most of my money, right?"
"3499430","3501150"," And then am I taking profit?"
"3502030","3507370"," I like runners, I'm not anti, I'm not anti leaving runners on, I'm just talking about"
"3507370","3515370"," renegotiating, so like, if I'm in for a dollar, and I just made two or three, take that two, three"
"3515370","3515930"," off, right?"
"3517090","3524210"," And pocket that shit, and then look for like a 20 cent or a 50 cent, 30 cent trade, if"
"3524210","3526130"," it blows up, you still have more ammunition."
"3530470","3535710"," Yeah, that's what I wonder, I wonder if that's what's going on, I have a, I have a feeling that"
"3535710","3544010"," there's a feeling that there's like, if I can list like five or six things that I think happens, I"
"3544010","3552430"," think it's like sizing up when you shouldn't be in a small account, size of trades versus your"
"3552430","3552690"," account."
"3553690","3559070"," So if you've got $100,000 and you're making $10,000 trades, that's big trade. "
"3559650","3564890"," Well, I don't know if you know that, like if you're trading 10% of your account in one trade,"
"3564890","3574170"," that's pretty big, like, it should be like 1%, 5% max if you're"
"3574170","3582790"," like super conviction trading and 0.05% of your account, that kind of stuff."
"3583290","3591950"," If you can't do that, if you're trying to build an account, then you need to make like 10 perfect"
"3591950","3592790"," trades, right?"
"3593390","3594790"," To actually build an account."
"3596370","3600330"," So you're likely have no business day trading doing that, right?"
"3600690","3606790"," You should be making like 10 perfect trades that not easy to do. "
"3607130","3608970"," You can do it, it's just not easy."
"3622350","3629690"," So for me personally, I have an investment account, I have an account that I trade with size, with"
"3629690","3632690"," spreads, and then I have a day trading account."
"3632850","3633490"," I have three accounts. "
"3635570","3637730"," And I take money out of my day trading account."
"3638110","3639670"," I don't leave my day trading account."
"3641010","3643610"," I'm like, I just don't, I don't keep trading up in size. "
"3644090","3647690"," I have in the past, it's always led to me blowing them up."
"3649150","3653330"," So I have an account that I own stock, the underlying market."
"3653930","3657950"," I haven't done any put selling on any of that stuff yet. "
"3658850","3664270"," I should probably do that, but I don't have the time streaming, like manage it better."
"3666250","3669830"," I hold some puts as hedging against that stuff."
"3672470","3679170"," But outside of that, my main money maker is not day trading for me. "
"3680790","3682230"," Oh, what's that right there?"
"3682910","3689950"," Oh, what's that right?"
"3690070","3691910"," The young Jimbros in here, huh?"
"3692270","3693230"," Getting salty in here?"
"3696910","3698230"," Salty bears up in here."
"3699750","3708650"," So Algos are pissed."
"3719880","3720840"," Yeah, it's tough. "
"3721120","3729420"," Like some, so some weeks of this year, I've had at least three bad weeks day trading, at least"
"3729420","3731000"," three this year."
"3733100","3740920"," Yeah, I was just talking to a friend of the show recently and I was like, stop, I was like,"
"3741000","3741660"," stop fucking trading."
"3742020","3743240"," I was like, you got to stop trading. "
"3744960","3746460"," He was still trading size."
"3746980","3753020"," And I'm like, what's so wrong with trading a thousand bucks or $3,000 or $5,000?"
"3753440","3755060"," Not, there's no shame in that."
"3756160","3761900"," If you're, if you're a day trade, there's, I used to trade size, I used to trade $30,000 day"
"3761900","3763720"," trades, $50,000 day trades. "
"3764300","3768880"," And there was a whole entire problem doing that."
"3769820","3771060"," So I have no problem."
"3771480","3775220"," I don't flinch at all trade in small, much smaller size. "
"3776140","3782740"," Like I had build positions now, like 25, I had another 25, throw 50 more on into sometimes they get"
"3782740","3785440"," trapped, not trapped, but my thesis is right."
"3786600","3792740"," And whenever, whenever you hear me say I've got like two, 300 contracts, likely I had to build into"
"3792740","3793300"," that position."
"3793960","3800700"," Likely there was a moment where I was upside down or flat or or something like that. "
"3801000","3808820"," I'm not entering like, hey, buy 300, 300 calls or puts or whatever."
"3812650","3813690"," I'm out right now."
"3814590","3815790"," I'm out right now. "
"3816530","3819970"," I sold just a few moments ago, maybe like five, 10 minutes ago."
"3821570","3825350"," And that was my point here was, now let's talk about where we are right now right here."
"3825490","3825610"," Okay. "
"3826030","3828010"," So it's 11.56 in the afternoon."
"3828170","3830290"," We've got four minutes left to get a new high."
"3830630","3831030"," We got it. "
"3831310","3832990"," We guys, technically, we got it right here."
"3835470","3837390"," Upside price target on spoons."
"3837570","3838690"," There's some issues here. "
"3839530","3840430"," Let's see it right here."
"3842110","3842830"," Sellers here."
"3843410","3844190"," Sellers here. "
"3846950","3852350"," The squeeze is above for 51.40. If you're bullish here, you can be."
"3853130","3855910"," Just, you know, making a shot in the dark."
"3856070","3856570"," I'm looking on. "
"3856770","3858250"," I'm looking at today's zero dates."
"3859250","3861890"," So you've got 451 and change up here."
"3863630","3867170"," They've got 11 cents for a 452 call. "
"3867930","3871870"," Rightly so the dealers are telling you know these sellers are here."
"3871930","3873730"," They're going to roll you down no matter what."
"3874110","3876550"," You're no way you're printing this 452 up here. "
"3877210","3878190"," We can print it."
"3879390","3880430"," But why not?"
"3880710","3881210"," Why not?"
"3881730","3883470"," Realize profit and then take."
"3885190","3886570"," Take some 11 cent calls. "
"3886810","3887290"," They're dirt cheap."
"3887790","3888570"," It's a lot of."
"3889190","3891110"," If they burn, you didn't blow up your account. "
"3892870","3897530"," They get some weird shit going on in my fucking chat right now."
"3897570","3898670"," It's not auto updating."
"3898970","3900590"," It's like, I have to scroll down every five minutes. "
"3901210","3902250"," Catch up for what you guys are saying."
"3903530","3904710"," Yeah, it's greed, right?"
"3910470","3911890"," Hey, congratulations, Willie."
"3912270","3913130"," I appreciate it. "
"3913310","3917310"," So Willie just said, I won't give details because I probably shouldn't encourage others."
"3917510","3920090"," But I definitely went to having the weekend and failing to run for the year."
"3920450","3921390"," So I'm feeling pretty good. "
"3921710","3922310"," Congratulations, Willie."
"3922530","3922930"," That's good, man."
"3925010","3926190"," You can put risk on. "
"3927330","3927890"," It's okay."
"3928290","3932830"," There's nothing like, you know, risk is a part of this market."
"3933730","3935970"," You have to understand that you're not going to win everything. "
"3936930","3941770"," And if you're trying to turn your account around, you're going to do risky things."
"3942350","3943190"," I get it."
"3943690","3945150"," I've done those risky things. "
"3946570","3949710"," No, it's okay to put risk on to build an account too."
"3949890","3950310"," I'm not anti."
"3951210","3957950"," I want you to know that's like, there are different methods for building an account or, or turning"
"3957950","3961450"," your account around that are very risky to do. "
"3961770","3964070"," And probably nail biting for you, Willie, right?"
"3964410","3967550"," Probably to it on your nails all weekend going."
"3967550","3968410"," Is this going up?"
"3968530","3969530"," Is it going down or whatever?"
"3970710","3975190"," There are, there are slow ways to build an account that are less risky."
"3975790","3977390"," They're usually time-based. "
"3978370","3985270"," Like you're waiting for perfect entries can usually take six months to a year to rebuild an"
"3985270","3985570"," account."
"3986570","3989170"," And then there, there are high risk strategies as well."
"3989730","3991430"," I know there are people out there. "
"3991610","3991970"," I do."
"3992070","3997410"," There was a time when, um, there wasn't, I remember, there wasn't, I'm trying to think back right"
"3997410","3997650"," now."
"3997870","4003550"," I remember there was a time, uh, those 452s are now 12 cents. "
"4005250","4013330"," There was a time when I was blowing up accounts when I first started trading options and I would"
"4013330","4013770"," get risky."
"4014110","4020650"," Like I would, I would slam the fucking buy button with like my whole account, 10k, like just slam"
"4020650","4020930"," it."
"4021670","4026250"," And, uh, then it would blow up and then come back in like three or four months or a month. "
"4026810","4028610"," And I would slam it again."
"4028990","4032610"," And then eventually I made like, you know, 30k or something than 50k."
"4033270","4035410"," And I could be less risky, you know. "
"4035690","4042050"," So I get, I get, I get the idea behind, uh, I'm not saying you shouldn't do it or should"
"4042050","4042390"," do it."
"4042490","4047850"," I'm not giving you financial advice, but I understand why people do that."
"4054870","4056190"," Yeah, and you know, makes a good point. "
"4056490","4057470"," Now, uh, good job."
"4057630","4058590"," Now, don't give it back."
"4060150","4062170"," You were up second futures at 430. "
"4062170","4062770"," I bet you were."
"4063030","4064070"," Dude, I was up this morning."
"4064430","4066350"," Dude, so I was long into the weekend. "
"4066910","4069910"," And you know, the smart, I made a comment."
"4070230","4077330"," I'm like, am I the only fucking guy over the weekend?"
"4078110","4082330"," Because like nobody was on Twitter and in all the bears were quiet as fuck."
"4082950","4088550"," Like, like Twitter, Fintuit was a ghost town at four third at three 30 three o'clock. "
"4088610","4093610"," And I'm like, I'm fucking, I'm just like, am I going to bank this or what?"
"4094550","4096810"," And like, nobody was on Fintuit."
"4097010","4098010"," And I'm like, how are you not awake?"
"4098910","4100010"," How are you not awake?"
"4100310","4103569"," If you're long like Tesla right now, how are you sleeping right now?"
"4105590","4109689"," Am I the only one that was awake?"
"4113490","4114910"," Oh, you're with me, Willie?"
"4115189","4115770"," Fuck yeah, brother."
"4118069","4119630"," Career a little, I miss what you were saying. "
"4119970","4120550"," Were you awake too?"
"4121370","4122609"," Career a little, I miss what you're saying."
"4122870","4123770"," Were you long too?"
"4125470","4126750"," Oh, you were team no sleep?"
"4127390","4127810"," Fuck yeah."
"4128640","4136470"," Did you guys see me talk about shit on Friday?"
"4137109","4139250"," I was like, you're going to get an announcement of some kind. "
"4139290","4142710"," I was like, I don't care if it's the truck with fully FSD."
"4142950","4147729"," You're going to get fucking, you're going to get something like stock split."
"4148010","4154930"," You're like the odds of that happening between this ER and the next ER are extremely high. "
"4161810","4162569"," Extremely high."
"4163850","4169470"," I saw someone comment in this weekend, they were like, they're like, Tesla's not going to announce"
"4169470","4170990"," a split until they hit 600."
"4171609","4172870"," And I was like, you're smoking crack. "
"4173649","4181050"," He's going to announce that shit at like 300 so that he can pump the stock to 600 or 1000"
"4181050","4182790"," bucks to do the actual split."
"4183430","4188490"," You don't get like, we don't trade it up to 1500 and then he announces the split."
"4189090","4192229"," It's when he announces it that it trades up to those high numbers. "
"4199790","4201030"," Right on, right on."
"4201210","4205310"," Yeah, I was, I was, I was like, maybe it's Twitter."
"4205550","4210710"," Maybe I know the other thing that I was thinking too was Twitter's been acting fucking weird for"
"4210710","4210910"," me. "
"4211090","4215130"," I don't know about you, but Twitter is bizarre right now."
"4215130","4217370"," Like my feed is all fucking crazy."
"4218370","4220110"," Who I'm allowed to see is crazy. "
"4220870","4222810"," Like I'm paying for that Twitter blue check mark."
"4223270","4225930"," I'm getting like, I'm getting fed ads all day long."
"4226810","4229610"," And I'm also getting fed promoted tweets. "
"4230770","4235350"," And I'm also getting fed like blue check mark tweets that I don't follow."
"4235410","4236890"," Like I don't follow these people."
"4237350","4239390"," And they're just like pushed into my feed. "
"4239890","4242690"," And then my regular people that I follow fucking nothing."
"4242690","4243850"," I can't see shit."
"4244570","4246750"," What's else is crazy too is my friends. "
"4247310","4249310"," Like my actual friends on fint to it."
"4249390","4259110"," Like Krista Marco, Matt Ryan, like short seller ST life, like Hooligan feet, J roll, Joe"
"4259110","4260130"," donut, Chaz."
"4261050","4268070"," If I know who else fucking Scott Murray, I don't know who else just name him. "
"4268230","4274450"," Like Jedi Marcus, like all these people that I trust, they don't show me any of those tweets until"
"4274450","4275530"," hours later."
"4277430","4280570"," And my Twitter for me right now is like bizarre."
"4285370","4287750"," It is straight jacked up. "
"4288110","4292250"," Dude, like I'll see a friend's tweet four hours later."
"4292970","4294410"," And then I'm being pushed tweets."
"4295350","4301770"," Like I'm getting tweets pushed on me that have nothing to fucking do with the with the price of"
"4301770","4307550"," like the price of corn or something like it's so bizarre. "
"4309010","4311590"," Twitter is bizarre for me right now."
"4320220","4321100"," Yeah, what is it?"
"4321260","4322220"," What am I supposed to be like?"
"4322460","4322940"," It's really weird."
"4323140","4323420"," Like I click. "
"4323700","4328560"," So yesterday I clicked into following, switched from the four you to following."
"4331760","4334860"," And like for you and following they're both a disaster."
"4340260","4345860"," It's a real it's a real shame to like whatever they're doing in the background, it's not"
"4345860","4346700"," productive. "
"4353550","4356150"," Hey, DTM, congratulations, brother."
"4358910","4365490"," Yeah, I really want like I want the most up to date tweets from the people that I'm following."
"4368910","4370610"," We're like up to the minute tweets. "
"4376430","4380690"," And there's like a there's like that's changed, man."
"4380850","4382930"," There's something's going on with the algorithm in the background."
"4383510","4390170"," I had my feeling is not feeling my thought here is my thought process is it has to do with"
"4390170","4392110"," the cloud. "
"4392430","4401830"," My thought is that the whatever the processing power is or whatever the cost is to auto"
"4401830","4405250"," update instantaneous all the important people."
"4406630","4414410"," For me who I consider important, I think that it's I think that they're not doing that right now"
"4414410","4415130"," because of the cost."
"4415430","4416730"," I think they're like they're feeding you. "
"4417010","4423490"," Let's say let's say I used to be able to see instantaneous right?"
"4424110","4428930"," 100 people that that are in my circle that I follow enough that their tweets pop up."
"4428930","4434010"," I think let's say they tweet 20 times a day 10 times a day."
"4434250","4438950"," I think it's like oh instead of giving him 100 of those in a day, I'm only going to give"
"4438950","4439310"," him 10. "
"4440750","4442910"," And I think it has to do with cost that could be wrong."
"4443110","4449330"," It's either cost or data scraping, anti data, but I think it's all stems back to the agreement that"
"4449330","4450270"," they had with Google."
"4459900","4461040"," Oh, so sailing. "
"4461840","4466260"," So I'm taking classes because thanks for asking."
"4466740","4476740"," So I joined a yacht club and I'm taking I've got I think eight or ten sessions"
"4476740","4479440"," like I learned how to raise series."
"4480740","4482280"," So I'm excited. "
"4482740","4490620"," I'm super so the actual we had a meeting on Sunday and then I've got lessons on every Wednesday at"
"4490620","4496140"," six thirty I think six or six thirty every Wednesday into the fall."
"4497260","4507080"," So I'm super excited for that to begin and we'll learn how to race man and I'm stoked like I"
"4507080","4512380"," want to do around the world milk run and preparing for it."
"4513200","4519740"," And it's a big it's the one thing that I've got left that I really want to do that's pretty"
"4519740","4522640"," dangerous but like a once in a lifetime kind of thing to do. "
"4524000","4532320"," So at some point I've got I've got a daughter who's going to be in college in two years so"
"4532320","4535800"," I don't see it happening for at least two years."
"4538140","4544260"," Even then this crazy right so so I don't see it happening for two years."
"4544960","4547480"," So I want to like send my oldest off the college. "
"4548780","4556160"," So that's I think two years two or three years somewhere in there and then my plan would be to"
"4556160","4560860"," leave Michigan and sail from Michigan."
"4561920","4568280"," I can't decide yet if I want to go up the St. Lawrence through way or pathway or at this"
"4568280","4575240"," call the St. Lawrence River way or something or if I want to go down through New York D Mass"
"4575240","4586140"," go go down through New York and then head south to Florida and then make the trip over those"
"4586140","4589300"," gin blue tonic waters but that that trip alone."
"4589980","4595260"," So if I go up to St. Lawrence just that part of the trip is going to take three four"
"4595260","4600320"," months maybe another maybe six months to a year just to get to Florida. "
"4602080","4606820"," So that's like I think that's the plan I think is like two or three years from now make my"
"4606820","4608740"," way down into Florida."
"4610220","4613640"," What's fascinating is I'd really like to trade while I do that too."
"4614740","4618960"," So I'd like to still be live streaming then and I'd like to actually live stream all the way down"
"4618960","4624440"," into Florida and then spend some time in Florida. "
"4624440","4630320"," So maybe that would take another two years that puts us four years from now and still and still"
"4630320","4639040"," trade too into Bahamas and stuff and then from there only make weekly trading videos or something"
"4639040","4639460"," like that."
"4639640","4647100"," So four years from now and then update you guys as I cross the world that would be the plan."
"4647720","4651960"," There's weekly check-ins with you and hopefully we can get to it. "
"4652180","4655880"," Matter of fact we have another we have some you guys want to hear some cool."
"4657740","4665120"," We have a potential we have potential for finding our nighttime recap video person."
"4665120","4670740"," I'm not going to say his name but we might even have like someone to do nighttime videos now. "
"4675060","4676380"," Yeah just get a motor sailor."
"4677260","4683000"," I'm thinking that the I think that the round the world trip leg of it is going to take six"
"4683000","4683940"," or seven years."
"4685540","4687320"," That's how long I think it'll take. "
"4689580","4696940"," So like you figure like a year going around another year or two down in Schooks looks like the"
"4696940","4699980"," whole trip maybe take eight years six to eight years somewhere in there."
"4705490","4706270"," Frenchy's right on."
"4711820","4714300"," You got an invite with local right along that I need to take up. "
"4714400","4718320"," Yeah man you know you do is you can get in on a bear can."
"4718480","4719840"," They have these things called bear can racing."
"4719840","4725500"," It's an easy way free way to learn how to sail and or squeezing right now. "
"4727720","4731480"," If you if you don't know about bear can sailing I think I've talked about it before here in the"
"4731480","4731660"," show."
"4731680","4736420"," If you ever want to learn how to sail wherever you live find a local boat club."
"4737680","4741680"," You don't necessarily need to pay thousands of dollars to join a yacht club or something. "
"4742400","4747360"," Find a boat club a boating club a sailing club like Google search selling clubs in my area."
"4748200","4752060"," You have a small lake if you're in a if you're on an ocean I don't care where you live"
"4752060","4757300"," look up sailing club and then find out when they have their you can just call them up and say"
"4757300","4758320"," do you have a bear can races."

"4765980","4773560"," a case of bear nice bear and the parking lot all ice down and you find someone that's racing and"
"4773560","4781700"," say and just be honest bring boat shoes bring a hat bring some sunscreen bring a change of clothes"
"4781700","4787620"," in case you get really wet or get going the water and just show up it's always good to bring"
"4787620","4793240"," a life you pee pee at PFD with you and then show up and be like I know nothing just"
"4793240","4799960"," say that I don't know anything and I'm here to here to put some hard work in and likely you"
"4799960","4807460"," can get on a boat for free and if you do what you're told we're about to squeeze here if"
"4807460","4812040"," you do what you're told you'll make great friends and you'll have free you get to use somebody"
"4812040","4820420"," else's boat to sail for free you don't have to own a boat it's super simple it's a it's a"

"4867460","4868520"," Yes, I've read that."
"4868880","4869980"," I absolutely have read that book. "
"4882510","4884730"," Some of the best sailing happened during the pandemic."
"4885650","4889310"," Some of the best sailing that it could be had was done during the pandemic."
"4897090","4906690"," I was just thinking about I was just talking to my wife I was just thinking here I"
"4906690","4916510"," was just"
"4916510","4924650"," talking to my wife about you want to hear a funny story so this is real right so my wife"
"4926130","4933290"," is was so I met my wife in the Army and she's a first born I met her"
"4933290","4942990"," in the and she's a leader she's a natural born leader"
"4942990","4952570"," and so you've got like two people that met each other that are very similar and so there's like two"
"4952570","4961290"," captains in the boat here and I try to be savvy and you know you want"
"4961290","4971230"," to stay you only ask only when it's important"
"4971230","4979810"," and oftentimes you know your wife or not maybe not your wife but my wife runs our home and our"
"4979810","4986070"," to make sure that she's the decision maker in our family I only really put my foot down when it"
"4986070","4994370"," really means something to me but we're having active conversations right now about sailing around"
"4994370","5002930"," the world and very these are very serious conversations like very like sober"
"5002930","5012030"," conversations because you can't have two captains there's only one captain it's mostly for safety"
"5012030","5021790"," reasons for life and limb there can only be one voice people can die if there is two voices"
"5021790","5030450"," or counter counterproductive or you're in a dangerous situation yeah you have to be able to not"
"5030450","5039810"," question a captain and it's a it's a usually imperative and you also"
"5039810","5049010"," can't be maliciously compliant and you also don't have to necessarily do exactly everything that"
"5049010","5056810"," they say so it's a very it's a weird balance you need people to think for themselves and you need"
"5056810","5064130"," people to be able to make their own decision so they can power your crew and stuff depending upon"
"5064130","5069290"," their experience level but it's a really weird balance and so we were talking about this like we're"
"5069290","5078150"," exploring this conversation we're exploring all this stuff and it was funny because part of our"
"5078150","5086090"," conversation came to a point where my wife said I think we need to have someone else captain for us"
"5086090","5093550"," sail with another another couple or sail and hire a captain because she doesn't know if she can"
"5093550","5103450"," actually do that it was a very honest sober conversation you know I was thinking of Joe donut"
"5103450","5105770"," of like maybe we have to have Joe get on the boat"
"5105770","5113710"," yeah"
"5113710","5125270"," yeah yeah"
"5125270","5130690"," all that works like all that stuff works on land like all that stuff works in the family but if"
"5130690","5138710"," you're ever in like if you're a really dangerous situation you need like compliance and you need"
"5138710","5145450"," you need you need you need things done a certain way it's very it's a very weird thing you know"
"5145450","5150870"," the military is the same way this is oftentimes why you won't see if you're if you're married in"
"5150870","5156250"," the military though you'll they'll separate you you know cuz they don't want they don't want there"
"5156250","5165110"," to be a whole bunch there brings up a whole bunch of shit but yeah it has something weird to"
"5165110","5177910"," do with like what was"
"5177910","5184250"," like loyalty is then there's you know that you're not it's a like like when we're at home we"
"5184250","5190670"," negotiate right where our relationship we discuss things but like the sailing is not like that"
"5190670","5199710"," sailing is like a it's like what Joe calls it a benevolent of benevolent dictatorship"
"5199710","5208010"," you don't want it to be a benevolent like in normal life it's not like that in relationships but"
"5208010","5215210"," when you're sailing it is it's very dangerous you can you can that better fact my wife's I got a"
"5215210","5225170"," story for you so my my wife's aunt sailed around the world and she had her leg caught"
"5225170","5235030"," up in the rope in the rope so there's a an anchor chain right usually like a hundred feet and"
"5235030","5242370"," then you attach rope to it we'll call a rope because I'm sure most of you guys aren't sailors out"
"5242370","5248750"," there you attach another hundred feet of rope on that on that chain right and it caught around her"
"5248750","5256470"," leg and dragged her down she lived but she was dragged down like 30 feet and it was cold dark"
"5256470","5265250"," it was nighttime and she almost died but like those situations present themselves"
"5265250","5273470"," or the risk of something like that happening is always there you can get killed by a boom it's very"
"5273470","5283090"," easy to die when you're sailing chasing bubbles"
"5283090","5290690"," that's a great documentary watch it I've seen chasing bubbles it's a very sad story to write how"
"5290690","5298070"," that ended he ended up dying didn't he think he died yeah we're getting maggies coming with us"
"5298070","5303470"," that's my thing about maggies they think that she's actually coming with us I had that conversation"
"5303470","5310210"," to with my daughter my older oldest daughter recently she wanted to take a lead our gap year or"
"5310210","5316050"," something and travel in Europe and I wanted to know if she wanted to sail with us but I was"
"5316050","5322710"," afraid that if she went sailing with us that she would not go to college and that's a tough thing"
"5322710","5330690"," to say to a child yeah I know it's lying I know it's lying I'm trying to be trying to"

"5597010","5603550"," honest with you what I'm really afraid of is coastal sailing coastal sailing is very dangerous"
"5603550","5613510"," places like Charleston can be really dangerous there are some water waves that are very dangerous"
"5613510","5621710"," to sail I'm really I don't like a coastal sailing open ocean sailing not as afraid it can be it"
"5621710","5630490"," can be scary and ominous big C's can be can be overwhelming maybe the feeling that maybe that's the"
"5630490","5640130"," better way to describe it but like true danger coastal sailing doesn't have to be this northern or"

"5913540","5920220"," from the coast when you're when you're traveling in part invested waters it's just like general"
"5920220","5927500"," situational awareness they call it that you need to have to mitigate risk when it comes to that"
"5927500","5935680"," stuff yeah floor guns and mandatory spare guns you can't bring those everywhere so some countries"

"8287309","8296469"," a lot and I agree this used to be my thesis on this so here now he's very tactful in"
"8296469","8301650"," how he says it as well so you have to like parse what he's saying let me read to you"
"8301650","8309129"," what his tweet was if a fruit if a fruit is telling you they have a strategy that makes 30"
"8309129","8315830"," to 100% returns per year being the S&P 500 then why are they selling the strategy through a"
"8315830","8321330"," subscription basis to retail traders as Charlie Munger stated these people are nothing more than"
"8321330","8329370"," fortune tellers who are dragging money out of their clients accounts the business is not trading or"
"8329370","8338530"," investing investing it's selling the subscription so there's some truth to this and not truth truth"
"8338530","8348150"," truth to this now pug really pug said this and he laced his he laced his comments he or he"
"8348150","8354410"," the way he wrote the post he we've through saying making the statement some people make the"
"8354410","8359830"," statement without saying what pug said which is if they're not if you know like if they're claiming"
"8359830","8364250"," that they're making a hundred percent returns every year claiming that they're making more than 30%"
"8364250","8373150"," or beating the S&P 500 they're lying to you now let's talk about a few things here Charlie Munger"
"8373150","8380270"," can suck my balls that guy does this it does that actually Charlie Munger actually does that he"
"8380270","8389890"," does charge his clients for for for his advice right so"
"8389890","8397010"," Charlie Munger wants that number one get that out of the way secondly Charlie Munger does not want"
"8397010","8403870"," you as a retail trader to ever manage your own money so there's a counter thing here too Charlie"
"8403870","8408910"," Munger does not want any retailer he did Charlie Munger doesn't want me managing my own money"
"8408910","8417790"," matter fact my bank gets my wife and corners are and tells her you know can you can you bring"
"8417790","8423050"," Jim down and talk to us they try to corner me at least once a year they don't want me"
"8423050","8429630"," managing my own money they want to manage my money for me so there's all there's already like a"
"8429630","8440130"," part about Charlie that I'm just like I get fucked old man you know come on second here but I"
"8440130","8447930"," used to believe this now I don't sell I don't sell a subscription just so you know but I disagree"
"8447930","8456330"," with this comment to some extent though so I do pay people even now I pay people subscription fees"
"8456330","8465650"," and I pay people for a subscription and I have paid a lot of money for subscriptions I paid guys"
"8465650","8473330"," five hundred two a thousand dollars a month I shit you not and I did it because these guys are"
"8473330","8480950"," really good traders they have time and market they taught me how to trade and for their time that"
"8480950","8487210"," they spent with me I'm sorry man it was worth every dollar maybe a better trader that's the truth"
"8487210","8497190"," there are subscriptions that I've paid for in the past for data and that data cost money so I"
"8497190","8502510"," don't mind paying for that either I used to pay for a service called flowago loved it loved"
"8502510","8509050"," everything about it that shit cost money I can't get that data anywhere and I can't get that data"
"8509050","8513330"," with an assignment so matter fact I think they're that they're one of the companies that are being"
"8513330","8517350"," sued right now I think allegedly I can't back it up that they're one of them but I think they"
"8517350","8526510"," are but they're able to assign numbers to the flow that company is able to track flow as it comes"
"8526510","8532310"," in out of the market and assign a number to it like this was a sell this was a buy"
"8532310","8541570"," that costs money to produce I don't mind paying for that so if they're providing you with real-time"
"8541570","8547790"," data that's expensive that should cost 10 20 grand a month for that guy to put out that guy had"
"8547790","8553330"," to develop that website that guy has to that guy has to maintain it I've got no problem paying for"
"8553330","8562270"," that shit so I think talk is like weaving like weaving like it's a it's a great statement but he's"
"8562270","8569390"," weaving through what you or what like you have to read his statement now here's another one I used"
"8569390","8575650"," to pay Derek coat noise I have a lot of respect for that guy for for what he does Derek"
"8575650","8582650"," coat noise spends a ton of time putting effort into his research I have no problem paying a guy"
"8582650","8590290"," like Derek coat noise for the time that he puts into the market I got no problem paying that so"
"8590290","8600190"," you know that that statement is valid how POC said it though is like weaving a a tight"
"8600190","8607090"," a tight weave like so it's hard because it's hard to say that because POC is a great trader I'm"
"8607090","8613550"," probably a better trader than most so yeah do I need to pay somebody do I need to probably not"
"8613550","8621790"," do I pay people to this day I do the matter of fact I subscribe to vol Wiz to Scott's"
"8621790","8630250"," newsletter I know Scott personally fucking guys a gangster guy worked my hedge funds the guy is"
"8630250","8635650"," like knows what he's doing very smart trader yeah I'll pay him for his time I got no problem paying"
"8635650","8643970"," that guy first time so I think maybe we're maybe maybe POC is referencing because there are these"
"8643970","8650610"," traders out there there are traders on fin to it that claim that they are always winners I see like"
"8650610","8657570"," posts they'll post them afterwards they never tell you they're long or short what they're doing I"
"8657570","8662290"," think is they pay well I was told that they were doing someone told me they were like these guys"
"8662290","8670570"," will what they'll do is they'll pay for trade both sides they'll take the long and the short or"
"8670570","8676450"," long puts and long calls and then whichever side actually prints they'll screenshot it and then"
"8676450","8685010"," afterwards they'll post it on like fin to it or somewhere else showing their winnings but they"
"8685010","8694830"," never post before so the only thing that someone out there"
"8694830","8704630"," I think that's fun if you're looking to subscribe to a furu make sure they're telling you their"
"8704630","8714090"," trades before and never just after that would be a key key thing so there are"
"8714090","8719470"," subscriptions out there that don't tell you the markets going up or going down right they're just"
"8719470","8726910"," providing you with data but if you are subscribing to a furu out there I think I'm with POC on"
"8726910","8732790"," this part of his statement if you've got someone like flashing you something afterwards like oh"
"8732790","8736990"," look I made 10 grand or I made a hundred grand and they didn't tell you they were long publicly"
"8736990","8745870"," before or publicly or behind a closed door or and I'd ask for a free subscription for a month or"
"8745870","8752530"," a trial like I get a week so if they're like flashing you the after but not the before like"
"8752530","8759690"," before is the key here maybe ask for like I don't like a trial or something and maybe they're doing"
"8759690","8764470"," it privately behind a in a discord or something or I don't know private YouTube channel something"
"8764470","8773870"," like that yeah I don't know if that's what they're doing or not but I know that it costs money"
"8773870","8782230"," to like do like developers cost money hosting cost money development cost money hosting cost money"
"8782230","8789190"," management cost money administration cost money all that stuff cost money you know and did I pay"
"8789190","8798190"," for services so and I don't mind paying for services I don't have no problem I'm long right now"

"8822750","8831610"," though is a vis line setting up again yes it's it's squeezing the man price was above the hourly"
"8831610","8840350"," the one in the five it is squeezing to trade 4850 again it's extremely bullish brother now you want"
"8840350","8846410"," a price target you're going to get a failure on 4711 and then look for a confirmation trade to"
"8846410","8862940"," break above 4850 your next target is 5609 on unity now"
"8862940","8872290"," thanks man man better your argument for Twitter paywall subscription is the same reason that keeps"
"8872290","8879080"," YouTube clean from Bob's you I agree with that too can I take a look at Tesla again sure"
"8879080","8885840"," you know what else is funny about that too is I used to have that same thought process but dude"
"8885840","8893220"," like I was just in a meeting on Friday with I was in the meeting I was a meeting with"
"8893220","8902900"," the administrators of the discord on Friday so Tesla you want to buy a 286 it's bullish to it it's"
"8902900","8910660"," not a grind right now it's grinding 2316 on Tesla see you can buy that tip again it's still bullish"
"8910660","8918760"," it's topping a little bit you know what I disagree Tesla might get a roll"
"8918760","8928560"," I'll say this have stops below 283"
"8928560","8938420"," 10 on Tesla I'm gonna have to get on my trade here Tesla have stops below 283"
"8938420","8944160"," 10 it remains bullish above it's a little long in the tooth on the hourly train making a pretty"
"8944160","8949040"," decent pullback in the market here so if you guys know what what middle you know that middle of the"
"8949040","8955360"," trade so it's 121 right now we're likely going to get a roll on the market down here into that"
"8955360","8961400"," 230 hour to be aware of that right there it's likely going to happen I might have to pull out"
"8961400","8967200"," here in a minute that was a matter of fact my calls were up quite quite a bit up here"
"8967200","8973340"," and I didn't I didn't sell them so we get one more green bar at any point here I'm gonna"
"8973340","8980080"," likely just we had a failure here too just heads up out there wasn't paying attention I was"
"8980080","8988620"," blabbing here's the high here's a failure of a new high the next eight minutes"
"8988620","8997240"," bears gonna want to take this underneath so be careful flat right now I haven't lost any money so"
"8997240","9003440"," I'm gonna look if I can get it out over here and try to get out of my trade if"
"9003440","9015710"," I make him win a penny give me one penny I'm flat"
"9015710","9025270"," right now I just sold so this closed for a penny I'm fine with that tassel hourly is"
"9025270","9031510"," it's not pretty can we go up here yes so I'm flat right now I got out of my trade"
"9031510","9041460"," we can continue higher but I'm afraid we could get an afternoon roll I don't like this failure"
"9041460","9049260"," right here see that one right there I don't like that I don't like seeing that see that bounce"
"9049260","9056560"," right there one two that should have went up but it didn't didn't get the new high third bounce it"
"9056560","9062480"," can go up there but I don't like these fucking I don't like this shit so I wanted to see"
"9062480","9069540"," conviction to the upside just be personally my just my trade one"
"9069540","9079420"," two I guess the guess you could call that the confirmation trade to the upside looking"
"9079420","9094790"," at tassel right now and I'm like yeah looks like dog shit yeah"
"9094790","9101650"," you know like so yeah Chas like then there's like the whole other thing about this like like I"
"9101650","9107150"," never started what I do I never started what I do because I was trying to make a subscription"
"9107150","9116870"," service but it's grown to a point where it's cost me fucking a ton of money and time and"
"9116870","9122390"," it has to if it's gonna continue it has to take care of itself do so I understand that too"
"9122390","9126590"," or we shut it down I was having a meeting with some with the guys from the discord and I"
"9126590","9135030"," was like I was like this thing has to become self sustainable if it can't we'll shut it down we"
"9135030","9144950"," don't have a choice I can't like time and money has been brutal I could just be trading on"
"9144950","9151990"," my own right trading my own we did it is awesome and it was good well it lasted so it's"
"9151990","9161690"," that part of it too oh dude I got out just in time didn't I my thoughts on Tesla"
"9161690","9171590"," into earnings you ready I heard some talk that Tesla is going"
"9171590","9181290"," to miss because they dropped the price of their car cars or vehicles I would be very wary"
"9181290","9189670"," of clinging to that hope I'm gonna warn you of something else"
"9189670","9199490"," you're likely going to hear it but even if they were to miss there is risk of some"
"9199490","9209730"," kind of guidance that could be very bullish there's"
"9209730","9219410"," like this there's like this thing where maybe you buy I mean I I want to buy like cheap zero"
"9219410","9229030"," dates like a week out or two weeks out even if they burned a zero I can probably make that"
"9229030","9237290"," trade back probably make that turn that into like a thousand percent trade 500 percent trade this"
"9237290","9245930"," year or the next one I think like as we as we could as we go through these ER's right"
"9245930","9255170"," one of these ER's this one of the next one you're gonna get something like you know we have really"
"9255170","9264490"," like the new Cybertruck has more ability than any other Tesla vehicle it's gonna have a version of"
"9264490","9273230"," FSD that is claimed to be like level four level five does that make it that it is no but"
"9273230","9281570"," it doesn't matter not when it comes to the price of the stock you're gonna see a split announcement"
"9281570","9288090"," at some point likely in one of these ER's now if that one of those things doesn't happen the stock"
"9288090","9297370"," will plummet but either either this ER or the next one my expectations are high maybe even the"
"9297370","9305410"," Q1 of 2024 you want to be out of the way for a trade like that right you don't want"
"9305410","9310450"," to be if you're short so matter as a matter of fact I would not fucking short any of these"
"9310450","9316530"," ER's coming up it's just not worth it it's not worth them even if it even if it burns you"
"9316530","9323530"," don't have Tesla burns on their ER I fucking would do I've I've been in these ER's where they have"
"9323530","9330370"," done those announcements and it's like a fucking moon mission you will blow your account like short"
"9330370","9337890"," if you want to buy puts that's fine don't be fucking short on Tesla these next next few ER reports"
"9337890","9347490"," just don't do it you'll be fucked like one of these things will blow you up you're gonna get one"
"9347490","9351970"," of those announcements I sure you have it now you heard the announcement of the first Cybertruck"
"9351970","9356930"," running rolling over off the line you guys have seen me on Twitter talk about this late night"
"9356930","9366070"," months ago right like post that shit and I deleted you saw the announcement this weekend you get"
"9366070","9370950"," some kind of good guidance like that you already know in this you already know you already fucking"
"9370950","9379370"," know right that in this ER they're going to talk about these trucks rolling off the line what"
"9379370","9386570"," they're gonna talk about how they're gonna get these trucks to people and there's gonna be a pump"
"9386570","9395130"," in that right that even if it's all the news on their yeah it's gonna be big so what are"
"9395130","9404150"," my thoughts on trading ER dirt cheap OTM calls with a couple weeks on them if you want to trade"
"9404150","9413850"," it otherwise we all know what happens right they typically if typically unless there's news of a"
"9413850","9420570"," squeeze or some excuse me news of a split or some major announcement of something actionable not"
"9420570","9430130"," promises like here's your fucking Cybertruck or here's a split right now or something like that I"
"9430130","9440050"," like that green bar that's a good green bar I like that right here maybe"
"9440050","9449910"," we are gonna squeeze Tesla Vans weird thing like what's a normal ER you"
"9449910","9453990"," what they're gonna do is print both sides and then you'll get the actual move a week or two later"
"9453990","9459370"," so you could sit on your hands as well if you wanted some exposure to one of those announcements"
