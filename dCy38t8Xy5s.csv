"97750","98530"," Check 1-2."
"99650","100230"," Mike Tech."
"101270","102230"," Peter Piper picked a pepper. "
"108340","111200"," Alright, at least I got the charts out this morning."
"116820","117620"," Alright, alright."
"118560","120020"," It's a little chat here this morning. "
"120520","121220"," We'll get right into it."
"121360","127780"," We'll have a little lake this morning, so we'll switch right over and get started."
"133540","137060"," So what we'll do is we'll be brief here with the charts with you this morning. "
"138160","138820"," We'll go back."
"139040","143400"," I'm going to have a really cool report and a couple other things we have to look at today for"
"143400","145820"," the rest of the upcoming weekend stuff like that."
"149680","151580"," This morning I posted some charts for you. "
"152000","153460"," This is roughly those same charts."
"154360","158880"," When different computers have to have to recharge this stuff, it doesn't carry over well."
"159380","159900"," I don't know why. "
"161500","166100"," So this might look slightly different than what you saw that I posted on Twitter this morning."
"167160","169420"," Now some things you're looking for this morning."
"170400","171920"," The put wall is at 430. "
"174870","182290"," Theoretically, this is supposed to be a place you can't get to unless more puts are bought on the"
"182290","182610"," market."
"183690","186390"," So we shouldn't tag these levels down below here."
"187790","194390"," Now if you do see at any point, any massive put flow on top of all hedges already on the"
"194390","200490"," market that came in yesterday, you'll see this put wall lower and we can trade there. "
"200650","200970"," But as a result, we're going to have to look at the market."
"200990","203690"," Because of right now, we cannot trade there theoretically."
"205310","211990"," Now if there's real money selling, then the options can, you know, you can just throw that whole"
"211990","213150"," theory out the window. "
"214630","219390"," Whenever you have real money selling, options market is then not in control."
"219690","221850"," Options market is typically in control but not always."
"222590","227530"," If you ever see real money selling, you know we see it in streams sometimes you'll see the heroin"
"227530","232930"," indicator going up and also the market's selling off. "
"235850","240710"," With that said, I'm not sure, I don't know that I don't know that we'll see real money selling."
"241510","246090"," You might see some real money selling the first half hour of the day but typically not always on"
"246090","246410"," Fridays."
"247290","248310"," You won't see that. "
"248710","255329"," You will though see options expiration where off towards the end of the day and we can sometimes go"
"255329","257050"," up or down due to that."
"258810","263510"," With that said, yesterday was a bad day."
"263690","266650"," If you're a bull, you should say yesterday was a bad day if you were a bull. "
"268370","275280"," Now I've been using this chart with you for at least a few fucking weeks, right?"
"277800","282620"," And it's funny because my other charts on my other computer, it said Friday price started with 4 "
"282620","288900",".35. And that was the original thesis until we broke out of this channel, right?"
"289080","291360"," If we're going to break out this channel, we have a bull flag here."
"291520","292900"," We traded up and we did that."
"293440","294200"," Made great money. "
"294700","297700"," Yesterday we're looking for a dip to buy and there was no dip to buy."
"297960","299900"," All semblance of support broke down."
"300720","304380"," And then we broke through the vault trigger which was higher. "
"304380","306140"," I think it was at 4.45 yesterday."
"309930","314390"," And we always talk about, you know, if we're making an attack for, you can buy the dips making an"
"314390","315270"," attack for the vault trigger."
"315270","316850"," Or getting through the vault trigger. "
"317930","321590"," But once we make this rollover move, this is the inverse here, right?"
"322430","325110"," And it'd be one thing if we were heading up, right?"
"325290","329010"," If we were heading up towards the vault trigger, we could buy those going up, right?"
"329190","333990"," But as we're heading down below the vault trigger, it saw the, saw the, saw the rip regime."
"334490","335210"," That's what it is."
"335990","337310"," And the regime is, saw the rip. "
"340200","341600"," Now we saw that yesterday."
"342000","343560"," We saw continued selling yesterday."
"344300","346120"," It was a bloodbath yesterday, right?"
"348690","354990"," And so, you know, when we're down here, the thought process has to, thought process has to be that"
"354990","357090"," you sell rips down below here for heading lower. "
"360030","361490"," And how does that affect you?"
"361630","363090"," Now, if you're a bear out there, right?"
"365810","369930"," You know that we talked about this 4.35, 33, you want to break below it."
"370510","371950"," You want to get the weekly low in."
"372050","372750"," We didn't get it yesterday. "
"373690","374850"," We talked about it yesterday."
"375450","377870"," Now, if you're a bear, you're like, well, I want to, I want to short this."
"377990","379130"," We're going to the depths of hell today. "
"380130","381870"," I'm not buying puts here, of course."
"382070","384210"," I want to buy puts higher."
"384490","387430"," I want to get them up here for later on. "
"387770","390810"," Now, if we do have aggressive selling today, we just start selling down."
"390910","391650"," I'll miss that trade."
"392650","395330"," But for me, this looks more like a bear trap for the moment. "
"395830","396730"," Some profit taking."
"396930","400410"," And then we actually had lower either later today or next week."
"401750","405750"," I don't want to buy this here because if I buy some puts here and we trade back up higher,"
"406010","407310"," I'm going to get fucked on those puts. "
"408390","414790"," So I'm not going to enter a trade at this moment for today unless we can get up to these"
"414790","415530"," levels up here."
"416110","421490"," This vault trigger and actually are one because I'm not seeing massive put flow."
"421650","426630"," I'm seeing some put flow, but nothing of consequence at this moment this morning. "
"427510","430470"," So I don't trust this trading down much farther."
"430770","435890"," At max, it shouldn't trade further down than $4.33.50 down here."
"435990","436890"," This should be the bottom. "
"437850","442470"," Unless we see real money selling, waves of puts coming into the market."
"442610","444090"," You shouldn't see that at this point."
"445530","449870"," So I'm not going to lend too much credence to taking this trade down here. "
"450390","454810"," I'm actually going to look for shorts to take profit."
"454810","463230"," Or puts to expire into Friday when some kind of a relief up higher to then take a short position."
"465110","469610"," The story was with the bulls yesterday and the story was with the bulls the day before. "
"470030","471410"," The story is though going back."
"471610","473330"," I want to show you guys, we're going to this report."
"473650","478990"," I want to show you guys some previous examples of this year and when we failed to break out of"
"478990","482070"," support and what's taken place and it hasn't been pretty. "
"483610","490740"," If we fail to break out of, let me say I make this a little bit larger here."
"494280","505590"," Just for some back story, if we fail to break"
"505590","508590"," out, the consequences are usually quite nasty."
"508970","510190"," You break out here. "
"510750","520850"," If it fails, right?"
"520850","522549"," Same kind of a move here, right?"
"523250","525870"," Break out, nastiness ensues."
"527310","528650"," Same thing over here, right?"
"528890","530650"," Fail to break out, nastiness ensues."
"531070","533470"," And I can show you examples going back to the beginning of the year. "
"533850","534870"," I'm not going to do that with you."
"535790","540470"," But you know, one, two, three, four, failure to break out."
"540470","543230"," It's pretty high rate of what comes next. "
"545270","551150"," And this also, you can, you can apply that anywhere in this past, this, this regime going, you"
"551150","552670"," could probably even look at it towards September."
"554230","559490"," But mostly January, a failed breakout typically leads to death and destruction."
"559850","560970"," Now, that's not every time, right?"
"561130","561690"," That's going to happen. "
"562410","567270"," But if you do this breakout, you try to try to break out even, this is one back here, right?"
"568190","570950"," We trade down failure in a breakout."
"571930","575150"," And then it's a pretty, pretty swift move down from there."
"576330","578950"," That doesn't mean we don't break out and succeed, right?"
"579410","580950"," And this is actually a breakout, right?"
"581410","581830"," It's a failure. "
"582070","583170"," We knew we weren't going higher."
"584770","588950"," But I do want you to be aware of that as we trade forward because we're in this regime right"
"588950","590310"," here when you see such a violent."
"590310","591110"," It's a trading session. "
"591430","593250"," We're seeing stock markets move lower here."
"593390","595130"," The Dow is down 280 points."
"595190","596430"," The S&P down 29. "
"596870","598810"," He has that composite down 46."
"599210","601430"," The Russell 2000 down about a half a percent."
"601910","603490"," When you see this move, right?"
"603490","605430"," You're holding around 2.92 percent. "
"605570","606310"," That's two 10 years, right?"
"606530","609250"," Holding around 15 basis points would be higher."
"609250","610350"," I'm going to beat this guy right now."
"610350","611530"," You don't want to hear his voice right now. "
"612070","613010"," It's not important."
"615310","618390"," What is important is that when you have a failure like this, right?"
"618650","619450"," It's so violent."
"620790","624310"," The move is saying, fuck you, we're going down, okay?"
"624850","631870"," And so this rate should accelerate and we should have some kind of market capitulation at this"
"631870","632150"," time. "
"632670","638070"," When you have a move like this to the psychology of an investor or a trader is, you know, I'm"
"638070","638670"," scared again."
"638670","640970"," You've made investors scared once more."
"641410","643570"," We've made traders scared once more. "
"645270","647970"," This could we could break out of this, I guess, at some point."
"647990","651970"," But even if we did, you would not see participation from retail."
"652390","657870"," We would not see participation from most small to meet mid sized funds. "
"658250","659750"," Family ops probably would not see participation."
"660270","663810"," This would be like a move from a GS or a JPM or something like that."
"663870","665950"," We had moves like this in the past as well. "
"665950","667350"," A lot of this move right here."
"668410","670750"," Everyone got involved in a little bit in here."
"674010","674590"," Excuse me. "
"675010","678630"," But the fact state that retail did not take part in this part of this move."
"679490","681550"," And something like that would take place here, right?"
"682410","683670"," Retail would not participate here."
"684810","685370"," Excuse me. "
"685650","686910"," They did not participate here."
"687030","688450"," They might participate in this move."
"689890","694810"," So my point to you is even if this goes up, it's not going to be led by anyone other"
"694810","695550"," than a large bank. "
"696270","699210"," And it looks like large banks are the ones that said, fuck, you know, right?"
"699370","700770"," They threw a short operation on."
"701130","703770"," We haven't had liquidation of the breadth of the market yet."
"704090","705490"," So there's still money in the market. "
"706490","711230"," And if you start to see that liquidation break in the market, we start to see real money selling"
"711230","712290"," right that we talk about."
"712590","715330"," You'll see a swift move down to lower lows."
"716730","721050"," Now, there are some key levels down below to be looking for if that does take place. "
"721590","725610"," First off, we should not get down to 400 or 4000."
"726090","726570"," We shouldn't."
"726830","728790"," The probability of it is low. "
"729630","733070"," But to have a test down here below, remember that first test we had at 435."
"734130","736490"," And the second test is down below at 420 ish."
"737190","737190"," 424. "
"737570","740070"," This blue line is most important for the bulls."
"740070","743070"," They want to defend these move these moves down here."
"743130","744950"," They want to defend this right here. "
"744950","746930"," These are lower highs, right?"
"747190","748130"," So excuse me, higher lows."
"748830","750710"," This is the last of the bull pieces."
"751350","758130"," If you break this this point, whatever this point comes into as time passes, if you wind up"
"758130","763230"," breaking this 424 or wherever the fuck it is. "
"763950","766990"," And you let's say you break below and touch this lower low down here."
"766990","770210"," It implies that we're going to see something lower down the road."
"770210","775250"," We'll eventually get down to 4000, whether that's now June, July or whatever, wherever. "
"775930","777410"," I wouldn't be panicking here either."
"777750","779930"," You guys already know my take on this market."
"780470","783410"," This is the same take since first of the year. "
"783930","787570"," You buy these lows and you sell for profit, right?"
"788070","789850"," And then you wait for it to come back to you."
"790010","796150"," We know that this regime will probably take place from now into at least May, if not into, let's"
"796150","796690"," say September."
"797630","800530"," So all this fucking around with gambling and shit is fine. "
"801170","804290"," But you guys should always be positive about where we are anyways."
"804890","806530"," You guys should always be looking for you."
"806610","810570"," If you have two mindsets where you're like, hey, I'm a bull, right?"
"811510","812770"," And I know two things, right?"
"812870","815490"," I can go around and fucking gamble and do whatever I want over here. "
"815910","818590"," But you already know as a bull, this is our thesis, right?"
"819130","824210"," That we're going to see these lows multiple times this year."
"824210","826950"," And this is how you actually manage your portfolio, right?"
"827070","828910"," You grab these lows, right?"
"829470","834310"," And then you cut them loose and you come back for more as the year moves on, right?"
"834690","840050"," This is actually an easier regime to some extent, more pronounced for what dips to buy, right?"
"840330","844910"," And with your majority party of your account, it doesn't matter where these levels are."
"844990","847290"," It doesn't matter for at 42400, 360. "
"848050","852570"," You're just going to be waiting for these for your heavy buying when the market is oversold."
"852570","859850"," So regardless if we trade higher here, test 470 or not, regardless if we don't get down to 400,"
"860930","869770"," regardless if we touch 420 and bounce up to 470 during FMC, you're still looking for these lows for"
"869770","871570"," the majority of your buying, right?"
"872890","879890"," There's no way in our live stream ever that we sit here and say, I'm going 100% here or"
"879890","881350"," I'm going 100% there."
"881350","884290"," We already know that our big buys are down below. "
"884690","888770"," We already know that no matter where we go up here, that we're coming back down here into"
"888770","889170"," September."
"889530","890410"," So it's already a given."
"890850","891970"," I know you guys got some licks yesterday. "
"892410","893470"," I took some licks yesterday."
"893590","894050"," Not too bad."
"894770","898990"," I'm still up like 150% from this trade here, but I'll tell you fucking what. "
"899490","901770"," This was a painful one, right?"
"901970","904450"," This one fucking sucked to lose yesterday."
"904830","905510"," It was fucking brutal."
"906290","913410"," But even though it's brutal, the key here is where we still talk about the market liquidation"
"913410","913650"," moments. "
"913890","920590"," We have an actual sub called Captain's Trades that still says we're going to have a moment to buy"
"920590","921090"," down here."
"921230","922170"," We don't care where it is."
"922230","923210"," We know that it's coming up. "
"923630","925430"," So look forward to that at some point."
"926270","927250"," Okay, that is the key."
"927730","932130"," That is the thing to always remember is that even when you take licks on moves like this, you"
"932130","933370"," already know that it's coming. "
"933370","937290"," You already know that down the road, you're going to have these opportunities all year, but all"
"937290","937630"," year long."
"937770","942450"," But more than likely most of the year, you're going to have some great, great buys at some"
"942450","944850"," significant discounts, okay?"
"945190","947210"," So you can make some serious money off of it."
"947270","948590"," So keep that in the front of your mind. "
"948750","950310"," Keep your chin up in this market."
"950310","954470"," If you're getting fucking wrecked in this market, know that there are some kick-ass opportunities"
"954470","957610"," that are going to come along as this year continues on."
"957610","961750"," With that said, we'll get rid of this right here. "
"963750","964810"," We'll get down here."
"965630","969470"," 4.33.84. Oh, that sucks."
"969690","970770"," We broke right through, right?"
"970950","971850"," We talked about this yesterday. "
"972250","975650"," We talked about do we break through the weekly low?"
"975830","979390"," That was 4.35.34. They tagged it this morning, right?"
"979870","985890"," This should be the bottom here, 4.33.50. We shouldn't get down below to this put wall here."
"986850","991190"," And I'm going to be looking for another, or a rip to sell at some point today."
"991750","996050"," Now, I'm not trading at this moment, but I'm picking up puts or calls or anything, any kind of"
"996050","997050"," nonsense right now. "
"997370","999390"," We're going to look at the spot gamma report at this point."
"999810","1003710"," And I'm kind of pissed off at spot gamma for the way they wrote this report this morning."
"1004170","1009310"," I read this this morning, I was pretty fucking angry at spot gamma because they never fucking take"
"1009310","1009870"," responsibility. "
"1010570","1014830"," And they have the same fucking poison that a lot of the internet has."
"1014830","1021190"," A lot of these paid services have the same fucking, they write their reports where they're not"
"1021190","1022190"," committed to a position."
"1022630","1027450"," They write their reports so there's always an out to say, oh, we said this or we said this the"
"1027450","1029210"," other day or whatever fucking nonsense they're going to say. "
"1029670","1031030"," And so they're doing this this morning."
"1031150","1032369"," I almost didn't want to show you this report."
"1032849","1038069"," But I'm going to show it to you because you just can't say, these guys, they rely upon all this"
"1038069","1042650"," fucking money and they don't, they think in their minds they think if I get something wrong, I'm"
"1042650","1044069"," going to get, I'm going to get fucked, right?"
"1044069","1047590"," I want to lose subs or something or you're not going to pay me every month for my service. "
"1048050","1051330"," And so this is grandiose, hey, I fucked up or I was wrong or whatever."
"1052310","1056470"," And so they always leave themselves a small out, but I'm going to read it to you because it kind"
"1056470","1058370"," of pissed me off reading their report this morning."
"1059050","1061610"," And it's better if they, whatever, I'll leave it at that. "
"1061790","1068870"," So the overnight session was rather tame, 436, 439, 439 high with the S near 437 of all S rearrange"
"1068870","1070850"," in line with that of yesterday's last few days."
"1070850","1072690"," 1.13 open to close."
"1072930","1077650"," There's a large build in both spy and cues negative gamma, right, which supports elevated"
"1077650","1078310"," volatility. "
"1078590","1083810"," Resistance is at 4400 and 4420, 440 on the spy."
"1084330","1091310"," Then 440, 440 50 support shows at 4335, which is right in here, right?"
"1091550","1094370"," 443 five right here should be support."
"1095610","1099290"," They don't talk about the football here, but I put this one on for you today. "
"1099350","1100450"," I normally don't show you guys this."
"1100850","1107430"," This is where the extent of the distance that we should go at, where that max should be about 433,"
"1107850","1112070"," unless we see real money selling or more aggressive put buying down here."
"1112850","1118150"," Now, we see another large exploration for the S&P 500, which can add to volatility. "
"1118570","1121570"," There are many narratives being passed around in regards to yesterday's decline."
"1121570","1128130"," The following paragraphs are intended to provide some retrospections in hopes that it helps guide"
"1128130","1129270"," markets going forward."
"1129830","1134890"," In our morning report on 420, we laid out how we thought VIX OPEX drove a large shortcut squeeze,"
"1135690","1137430"," which was the catalyst for the rise. "
"1137590","1139690"," This was afterwards, not before."
"1140790","1146370"," Additionally, we noted an unusually large amount of gamma on SPX spy, a greater 20% expiring on"
"1146370","1146750"," Wednesday night."
"1146750","1152910"," To quote what we wrote on Wednesday AM, further as the upper SP5 show in top, the markets still"
"1152910","1156150"," exist in a void of sorts, particularly large OPEX. "
"1156310","1157470"," The OPEX removes that money positions."
"1157890","1162770"," We see at 4,500 call wall significant overhead resistance and also filled in a drop back into that"
"1162770","1166130"," void to 4,400 can happen quickly."
"1166430","1169470"," Note, this was on Wednesday and we dropped on Wednesday. "
"1169770","1173510"," We actually made some bank on this trade on Wednesday into the close."
"1174590","1175450"," This was Wednesday."
"1176430","1180690"," Had we written that paragraph above yesterday, we don't find that none of our members would be"
"1180690","1181910"," searching for further narrative. "
"1181990","1186830"," Truth be told Wednesday is closing, so they didn't write this yesterday and they didn't think this"
"1186830","1187810"," shit was happening yesterday."
"1189570","1190310"," Nobody did."
"1191110","1193230"," I guess some people did, but they timed it wrong. "
"1193670","1195470"," There was a chance of that happening."
"1196310","1199310"," The day after expiration, it's pretty common to see us sell off."
"1199310","1201610"," Truth be told Wednesday is closing price action. "
"1202990","1206810"," At spy, queues, divergence at Thursday and left us scratching our head."
"1206930","1208490"," We certainly just made volatility on Thursday."
"1209770","1215610"," Our implied move was 1.2%, but admittedly began to shift from filling the downside void to two-way"
"1215610","1216550"," volatility as possible. "
"1216970","1218130"," There was no two-way fucking volatility."
"1218950","1224850"," We bounced off fucking resistance that we knew was at 4.50. We came down to fucking support and we"
"1224850","1227590"," fucking broke right through is exactly what fucking happened yesterday."
"1227590","1231510"," Historically, we flagged large options, expirations for two reasons. "
"1231930","1232910"," First, call heavy markets."
"1233450","1235350"," We usually get an expansion of all after expiration."
"1235530","1237930"," They put heavy markets. "
"1238250","1240510"," I think he's meeting in put heavy markets."
"1240750","1243510"," Many of you know that major lows come in the day following expiration."
"1243910","1244550"," Yes, we know that. "
"1245230","1249190"," It's not just January 24th, 22nd, March 20th, December 18th."
"1249190","1255310"," They went back on Wednesday and looked back two years and it was often but even with those"
"1255310","1261410"," expiration dates where we had heavy losses, the day following, they still followed the general"
"1261410","1264150"," trend of the stock market."
"1264590","1267730"," They were in line with the direction of the stock market. "
"1268250","1271010"," The direction was turning yesterday in the stock market."
"1271170","1272110"," We were above all yesterday."
"1273090","1274690"," This is a tough argument from them. "
"1274810","1275790"," This is a real hard argument."
"1276530","1282370"," Maybe I'll go through this if we get slower something on an actual chart to show you how you can"
"1282370","1288050"," recover if you're in an upward trend, even if you sell off in that day following expiration."
"1288990","1294810"," And then you also have days or times where expiration the day after doesn't even matter because of"
"1294810","1295730"," the direction that you're going. "
"1297430","1302670"," Wednesday expiration was certainly not a monster, but as noted, it's usually large for midweek, non "
"1302670","1303350","-event day."
"1303710","1306030"," The expiration served clear at a sizable chunk of short-day positions."
"1306550","1311030"," Essentially, we think OPEC's pinning an upside due to Carl's hedge unwind describes all the price"
"1311030","1316490"," action Wednesday p.m. to Thursday a.m. All of the above is verbose, a verbose way of saying we"
"1316490","1320490"," believe short-day adoption of positioning in a liquid market was the cause of this 100-point"
"1320490","1321170"," roundup of markets. "
"1321730","1326130"," We think we think that seen through this positioning lens, the market is easier to understand."
"1326830","1327670"," They've added this today."
"1327690","1328670"," This was on tear this morning. "
"1329630","1333970"," There were some fed comments that certainly didn't support the markets but seemed to just reiterate"
"1333970","1335870"," that what the market already knew."
"1335870","1338550"," 50 BPS raised, absolutely."
"1339250","1344070"," Arguably, the market was expecting this already as per Fed Fund funds tool below, which shows that"
"1344070","1346750"," heading into yesterday, the market already anticipated the increase. "
"1348010","1351610"," Ultimately, this leaves us back to back to this map from Wednesday."
"1352310","1357330"," 440, 440, 4400 is the last neutral strike on the board."
"1357810","1360870"," Meaning is the last strike with material called gamma below 4400. "
"1360870","1366530"," It's primarily put gamma, which leaves the market exposed to the dealer's short edging."
"1367810","1370490"," This is that chart we looked back on on Wednesday, right?"
"1371230","1375150"," Where the dealers will short futures and we will continue to head down."
"1375670","1379830"," As noted at the top, today is another large expiration for the S&P 500. "
"1380090","1381650"," We see roughly 25% of gamma expiring."
"1381810","1388810"," Much of that is coincidentally centered around 4400 or 440, the gray area."
"1388810","1394870"," Therefore, we think that the S&P more or less holds 4400 area today, but with some wide swings. "
"1396730","1401190"," Looking forward into next week, there's no reason we cannot see another air gap rally like we did"
"1401190","1401650"," this week."
"1401970","1405030"," 4500 would remain significant resistance to the downside."
"1405110","1410650"," We're flagging the 4300 put wall as major low into the key 54 timeframe. "
"1411470","1414050"," So I did this stuff wasn't on the report about an hour ago."
"1415350","1417450"," They're going to put it in now, though."
"1418070","1421330"," And that's why I did put the 4300 in there for you guys to see this morning. "
"1421970","1426330"," This low is because our lower bound concept, which may apply to on a test of 4300 shown here is"
"1426330","1430390"," our delta tilt indicator indicator, which measures call versus put delta."
"1430770","1435450"," When the indicator shows near the blue dash line, it suggests the market is at maximum put size,"
"1435450","1437290"," and that leads to a pause in market decline."
"1437930","1443670"," We're currently off of that blue line, but a move to 4300 likely places us back at that lower"
"1443670","1443910"," bound. "
"1444930","1447770"," You can see this delta tilt down here."
"1448030","1451070"," So you should get a reaction if we hit if we hit 430."
"1452910","1454230"," All right, we'll leave the rest of this here. "
"1454310","1454930"," I'll scroll through this."
"1454950","1457070"," You guys can you guys can pause this if you want."
"1457130","1460210"," Come back to back to these gamma levels. "
"1463070","1464250"," Scroll through this real quick."
"1465130","1467350"," I'm going to turn that turn this off at this point."
"1469430","1470770"," They come straight back to here. "
"1470770","1473690"," So they're telling you that they're telling you a couple things."
"1473690","1476710"," They're telling you that 4350 is likely bottom right here."
"1476910","1478230"," Okay, this is likely bottom. "
"1478610","1484190"," They're also saying that if we were to penis touch down here, that you're going to get a reaction"
"1484190","1493070"," north to 450 on a short covering on short covering, but even then what will likely head lower will"
"1493070","1497450"," head down and see that 42424 area down below."
"1497450","1499290"," You take that for what it's worth."
"1500410","1507410"," Take that for its worth because even with this notion that we can't trade any lower than here, if"
"1507410","1512490"," at any point you see real money selling, which you typically do when the market starts to liquidate"
"1512490","1517210"," or have a liquidation moment, then all bets are off on this trade higher and lower. "
"1518330","1524530"," So what does that leave you with as a bull or even a bear for me so that I don't"
"1524530","1527050"," lose my fucking shirt day in and day out?"
"1527410","1533450"," I'm looking for some kind of this move higher to trade this lower and that we don't trade higher"
"1533450","1534290"," than the ball trigger."
"1534810","1541170"," I don't like buying puts up here because we could go higher like we did in this previous few days."
"1541930","1544810"," So that leaves us with what do you do, right?"
"1545130","1548630"," If you're a bull, you are at this point waiting for that liquidation moment. "
"1548970","1551570"," If you're a bear at this point, I don't know what to say to you."
"1551570","1555930"," If you want to get all bearish and take on a shit ton of shorts here, you want to take"
"1555930","1559010"," on a shit ton of puts here with some data on them, that's fine."
"1559550","1563450"," For me, I'm going to be waiting for this move higher for another move lower. "
"1565470","1568570"," The regime is on the bear's side though overall."
"1569010","1573590"," You have to respect the fact that the bears took us back down into this negative channel."
"1573970","1581070"," You have to respect the fact that over time, whenever we fail in one of these downward channels, we"
"1581070","1581670"," had lower. "
"1581990","1582770"," That's where we go."
"1583730","1587710"," It's aggressive and it ends up picking up speed at some point."
"1588490","1593510"," You might have three to five days, seven days, where things get very aggressive. "
"1594450","1598590"," So if you're a bull, stand by, just hang out today, relax, do nothing."
"1598950","1601610"," There's nothing that you can do in this regime."
"1602290","1607230"," Any dip that you try to buy in this regime is going to be short lived or you could get"
"1607230","1607870"," caught in it. "
"1608170","1611310"," They're saying we could possibly trade up here, right?"
"1611870","1615530"," We trade up here to this 450 and get swung back down."
"1615690","1617630"," The reason they're telling you that is they're leaving themselves."
"1617970","1619030"," Sparky, I'm insane to you. "
"1619590","1623650"," Well, I'm going to leave room in case we trade all the way up to 450."
"1624270","1630510"," But the reality is any kind of a rip can be shorted at any point from here and higher."
"1630730","1634590"," It can actually be here, here, here, and they're going to come back and tell you in a week or"
"1634590","1634770"," two. "
"1634770","1637870"," Well, we told you 450 was the top in case we got there."
"1638310","1644950"," Or we told you at the same time that we're in a negative volatility to expect something like this,"
"1645130","1645250"," right?"
"1645610","1649370"," So they're covering their asses and if we trade higher, okay?"
"1649670","1654470"," But for you as a bull, you need to know that as long as we're in this channel down here,"
"1654570","1657230"," we could flip around at any fucking point."
"1657670","1661310"," At any fucking point, we can head lower from where we are. "
"1661310","1665570"," And now that we're back in this channel, we are under under control of bears."
"1665990","1667350"," Bears are in charge right now."
"1667410","1669790"," They can lean in to a short at any point. "
"1670170","1675850"," And the more that we do something like this, the closer we get, you're going to see a rapid, at"
"1675850","1678630"," some point, a rapid acceleration to real money selling."
"1679070","1682310"," You will see the market liquidate sooner than later."
"1685990","1688390"," Now with that, with all that said, right?"
"1689230","1690310"," With all that said. "
"1690890","1695430"," So they're saying, if we touch 430 down here, right, you'll see a reaction."
"1696130","1697730"," So you'll look for a by north."
"1698030","1702750"," If we don't see a reaction, if we don't see 430 today, if you don't see this 430 today or"
"1702750","1703790"," into the close today, right?"
"1704410","1705690"," You can see a smaller regime. "
"1705910","1709150"," We trade higher and we just slowly go lower, right?"
"1709150","1711230"," We just kind of creep the crawl all the way down."
"1712810","1714310"," All right, they got all that out of the way."
"1716500","1719180"," Little pissy at that SG this morning. "
"1720820","1722440"," They were trying to claim yesterday."
"1722740","1726300"," They're like, well, we close the four, whether like we close that 440 on SPX."
"1726840","1728200"," I'm like, get fucked with that noise. "
"1729520","1731560"," Spy was down here at fucking 437."
"1732800","1733240"," Began."
"1734760","1737600"," Began to slap 435, 33 yesterday. "
"1738160","1740680"," Just Began into the bell."
"1740860","1742460"," So I don't want to hear that fucking noise from Spock."
"1742780","1746940"," It's fucking retarded. "
"1747560","1748320"," Sorry for saying this."
"1748360","1750940"," I shouldn't say retarded, but absolutely fucking retarded."
"1751760","1752740"," They work out well for me. "
"1752820","1753760"," The one thing I'll say from Spock."
"1753960","1757200"," I make a lot of money using them as one of our tools."
"1757680","1763000"," They are the they complete the tools that we use for me at least to be successful. "
"1763000","1768980"," So even when I'm bitching moan about Spock, Emma, generally speaking, they they they lend another"
"1768980","1771860"," tool to the basket that we use to trade this market."
"1771860","1776100"," And generally speaking, they for me at least, I've had great success with them."
"1776900","1778240"," I think Taiwan's second here. "
"1780580","1783540"," I'm going to bring up a bring up book map here."
"1786740","1790740"," I'm just all I'm doing is I'm bitching and moaning about Spock and right now."
"1790740","1794160"," But for me, you know, you people get things wrong. "
"1794160","1795940"," You can't be out there expecting."
"1796540","1800180"," I got to say that you can't be out here expecting Spock and always be correct."
"1801120","1806040"," I got to have to say that because we all get things wrong in the market. "
"1806620","1807680"," And I know one thing."
"1807840","1810760"," Spock and it gets it right more than most of the people on Twitter."
"1811220","1816440"," And as most of the trainers on Twitter and most of the most of the most most of the paid. "
"1816440","1820140"," I've paid for, you know, with paid 600 bucks a month to have."
"1820520","1822180"," A bruise out there."
"1822320","1823360"," Tell me what they think's going to happen. "
"1823420","1825380"," And I've lost my shirt following them."
"1825640","1830420"," So even with me bitching about Spock, Emma, this morning, they typically get things right in my"
"1830420","1830920"," experience."
"1831300","1835860"," I'm letting off some fucking steam on how these people still cover their asses. "
"1836620","1838500"," When they write a report, they get something wrong."
"1838640","1840660"," They should just say we were fucking wrong."
"1841700","1842920"," We were fucking wrong. "
"1843120","1843400"," It's easy."
"1844260","1845140"," We were wrong."
"1845140","1845660"," It's not. "
"1846120","1847280"," It's okay to be wrong."
"1847980","1848380"," I know."
"1848640","1849720"," I already know. "
"1849900","1852880"," I know a bunch of people get shit wrong like 70% of the time."
"1853240","1855300"," You can get something wrong one out of 10 times."
"1855600","1857600"," You can get something wrong three out of 10 times. "
"1857800","1860320"," But it's better for you to just say I got it wrong."
"1861160","1864460"," And so seeing, I noticed yesterday someone was commenting on Twitter."
"1865300","1866100"," They were saying that. "
"1866100","1868720"," It has that composite in the positive territory help."
"1870640","1873740"," Some of the stocks have been most beaten down this week."
"1874880","1877680"," Netflix shares up about two and a third percent. "
"1878060","1879380"," I believe they're that list."
"1881700","1886880"," I mean, you have key technical technology earnings out ahead of us next week as well."
"1889880","1891460"," So he's telling you about the dip here. "
"1893320","1897000"," The point though is that I read a text or tweet tweet."
"1897000","1901520"," Big tech earnings include Apple Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft."
"1902060","1903980"," We are seeing a bounce here in the NASDAQ. "
"1904180","1907680"," Despite the significant declines with the S&P and the Dow."
"1908480","1910220"," So this is trade the news."
"1910400","1911820"," He's telling you to buy the fucking dip here. "
"1912300","1915980"," So the point though is yesterday I was reading a tweet from somebody."
"1916180","1918840"," He said, wow, all these big four was disappeared yesterday."
"1919660","1920800"," And we live streamed yesterday. "
"1920800","1922660"," So we didn't do any disappearing act yesterday."
"1922660","1924260"," But that's the key, right?"
"1924380","1925560"," As you saw people disappearing."
"1925560","1927340"," I didn't realize this was happening yesterday. "
"1927880","1929720"," That furrows were disappearing all over Twitter."
"1930340","1932840"," And then all of a sudden fucking I guess furrows disappeared yesterday."
"1933700","1935760"," And, you know, this isn't as bad. "
"1935840","1939520"," Spot cameras report this one as bad as some of these furrows that are out there."
"1939880","1943000"," But it is bad because you just want to tell your people that follow you."
"1943120","1947460"," Hey, we fucked up or hey, we didn't account for this or we didn't see this happening yesterday. "
"1948120","1949360"," Even in any kind of way, right?"
"1949520","1951860"," We saw it on Wednesday and we saw it too."
"1952120","1954760"," We traded what they said on Wednesday and made a lot of fucking money."
"1954760","1956800"," And actually, I think that was Thursday. "
"1957260","1958740"," Maybe I'm misplacing the date."
"1959020","1959960"," So I think it's on Tuesday."
"1960800","1964760"," We had that report that said that we could fall off. "
"1965040","1966360"," And maybe it was Wednesday or Thursday."
"1966500","1966820"," I can't remember."
"1967420","1969480"," But we traded that and made a bunch of money. "
"1970040","1972820"," And I typically use them, make a lot of money off them."
"1973360","1975680"," So I'm just pitching this morning about that."
"1976860","1978400"," Because I guess people disappeared. "
"1978680","1979960"," I didn't know people disappeared yesterday."
"1980620","1984040"," I didn't realize that furrows were just fucking a gun yesterday."
"1984040","1985020"," I had no idea. "
"1985680","1988780"," So if you see that on Twitter, if you see that on social media, people disappearing."
"1989820","1991140"," You shouldn't ever, right?"
"1991300","1993240"," You should just say, you know, we bought the dip."
"1993260","1993840"," We fucked up. "
"1993940","1995200"," It didn't work for us."
"1995600","2001040"," Take your licks when you take them and recover for your next trade."
"2001300","2002860"," Watching some calls coming across the board. "
"2003800","2007280"," Watching QQQ's 63335C for 1.2 million."
"2007780","2011240"," Watching dip buyers step in on the spy apple."
"2011240","2018140"," And then you just heard the commentary from Trade the News saying, we've got huge tech earnings"
"2018140","2019840"," next week by the fucking dip. "
"2023350","2027210"," We'll take a look down here and see if there's any other places that we can trade to."
"2027570","2029810"," We've got 433 right below us here."
"2031900","2035560"," Looks like some major liquidity stepping in right where we are currently. "
"2036260","2039400"," So if you are short, this might not be the place for you to stay short."
"2040000","2042320"," Just take note of that as the day moves forward."
"2047699","2049219"," Well, I guess I could say that, right?"
"2049219","2051100"," You got Trade the News telling you to buy the dip here. "
"2051659","2055940"," But then also, we knew to buy the dip yesterday and that didn't quite fucking work out."
"2056080","2056260"," Did it?"
"2057219","2059199"," I haven't placed any trades at this point."
"2059280","2060600"," I've added nothing into the market. "
"2061540","2067239"," I've got no wants to be trading this kind of volatility on a Friday."
"2069120","2070980"," Friday is usually where you lose all your money."
"2071260","2072580"," I don't know if you know that or not. "
"2074179","2078360"," And for me, for today and Friday, I have no fucking no wants to be buying this dip."
"2080219","2085580"," Let me see what you guys are saying inside the, inside the chat."
"2086360","2089380"," So economic calendar for today, right?"
"2089520","2090000"," We don't have much to add. "
"2090060","2096460"," I think we had just, we've got something at 9.45. We've got the PMI flash report at 9.45"
"2096460","2098600"," already happened next week."
"2099620","2102840"," We've got durable goods, case shiller."
"2103300","2105820"," So Tuesdays, we got nothing scheduled for Monday. "
"2106180","2113740"," This could be a nice day for some kind of a trade higher with nothing scheduled for Monday."
"2114420","2116340"," Tuesday, we've got some volatility at durable goods."
"2117000","2121360"," We've got case shiller, consumer confidence index, new home sales at 10. "
"2122680","2123700"," Wednesday, we've got pending home sales."
"2126520","2129620"," Thursday, initial claims, continuing claims, big volatility day."
"2130760","2132580"," And then Friday, the 29th, we've got CPI. "
"2132800","2133780"," These are the ugly ones, right?"
"2134200","2136060"," This is when we talk about a type."
"2136280","2140680"," This is all actually geared towards your paying $20 for a gallon of milk kind of shit."
"2141520","2143720"," My mortgage has gone through the fucking roof because of rates. "
"2144480","2151480"," And there really wasn't yesterday any kind of change in what, what, what Jay Powell had said."
"2152300","2153420"," But what was key?"
"2153640","2154960"," And you saw this in the news yesterday."
"2155840","2165560"," What was key about yesterday was the, what was key about yesterday was was the reaff, reaffirmation"
"2166020","2169700"," that we're putting 50 bit BPS on the board, right?"
"2170000","2175520"," That he is, of course, the fed put is what everybody thinks is going to happen into this FOMC,"
"2175700","2175760"," right?"
"2175940","2181860"," They're going to come out this FOMC and talk about, talk about, get some sellers up here at 4, 35,"
"2183260","2183400"," 80. "
"2184120","2186620"," We'll look higher and see 4, 37."
"2188840","2190540"," Look for some resistance above."
"2190920","2192180"," See it right here, 4, 37. "
"2192980","2195000"," Not much, not much selling above here."
"2197860","2199620"," Some hidden sellers here at 4, 38."
"2200000","2203560"," Pretty decent sell, 4, 38, flat. "
"2206250","2207610"," And then 440 right here."
"2217740","2218900"," Let's look up at 450 again."
"2222280","2224240"," Yeah, wall of sellers above at 450. "
"2229680","2232180"," So make sure we read through the chat to you guys are saying this morning."
"2232480","2233220"," Good morning, by the way."
"2233320","2234080"," How's everybody doing today?"
"2234780","2235520"," Y'all doing well?"

"2244900","2245400"," Good to see you, brother."
"2245580","2245820"," Brad. "
"2245980","2246260"," Good morning."
"2246360","2246720"," How are you, brother?"

"2253320","2258140"," Continue to remind our comments from the Russian chiefs and negotiators saying there were long"
"2258140","2262400"," conversations today between the heads of the Russian and Ukrainian peace negotiations."
"2278120","2279040"," Let's dump this market."
"2279220","2280380"," I thought with this market that fast. "
"2280500","2281080"," Sorry, buddy."
"2281700","2282460"," It's not happening."
"2282900","2284560"," Major support, though. "
"2284760","2285600"," So shorting can be dangerous."
"2285600","2286780"," Yeah, this is not a place to short."
"2288900","2289500"," Good morning. "
"2289660","2289880"," Fisted."
"2290000","2290320"," How are you?"

"2292600","2292900"," Tomos."
"2293040","2293760"," I missed you so far."
"2293820","2295120"," If you missed your name, this morning, I apologize. "

"2299820","2300040"," Fuck. "
"2300200","2301340"," Yeah, we're doing poor local Fridays."
"2302260","2304520"," I'd like to see if there's any bigger cells above."
"2306860","2308720"," Look like there's some hidden sellers at that. "
"2308860","2315660"," Between that 4.37, 4.37 and 4.38. Looks like there was a hidden wall above there."
"2320280","2327100"," There's one right here that's really sneaky at 4.38. And see it hiding in there right there."
"2329910","2340670"," And some sellers right here at 4.37. More sellers stepping it above at 4.38. They're"
"2340670","2343010"," not quite showing up here, but they're there. "
"2347490","2350910"," I don't usually get rattled, but this is pissing me off doing this for 20 years."
"2352230","2353190"," What's pissing you off, Winky?"
"2353350","2353710"," What do they miss?"
"2354930","2356190"," I missed something that you said."
"2356590","2356930"," Hold on. "
"2357030","2357730"," Wait, wait, wait, wait."
"2358070","2360450"," Let me scroll through the chat and see what you're pissed off about."
"2361210","2361910"," Let's print 430s. "
"2363350","2364810"," Got a good premium kicking on my puts."
"2365650","2366550"," Poor local Fridays."
"2368850","2370690"," Oh, yeah, you're talking about Spock Emma. "
"2374410","2377230"," Yeah, when they get it wrong, it's usually pretty fucking bad, too."
"2377310","2380550"," That's the one other thing that I'd say would be how fucking bad."
"2381170","2383710"," When they get it wrong, it's usually pretty fucking bad. "
"2387380","2388520"," It'd be with five minutes."
"2388520","2389080"," Story hit."
"2389260","2389880"," What story Twitter?"
"2391360","2392500"," Trying to move now. "
"2393180","2396700"," You guys are going to, I'll bring up Twitter and Netflix and test it for you."
"2398040","2398880"," I'll load them up."
"2401890","2402710"," Load up Twitter. "
"2407030","2407530"," NFL X."
"2413090","2414330"," I always like hearing that."
"2414890","2416030"," Netflix has hit a technical bottom."
"2416810","2421990"," That means that someone's looking at a MacDego and, nope, we're buying this. "
"2424090","2426790"," Where I get Twitter and Tesla."
"2429500","2430480"," Let these load up."
"2430980","2437050"," A lot of us went breath small. "
"2437630","2438910"," TLT, Jank, oversold."
"2439810","2441410"," I don't get why anyone paid for Spock Emma."
"2441510","2441850"," That's winky. "
"2442010","2442710"," I fucking love you, winky."
"2446110","2452920"," Yeah, there are tons of open source for GitHub."
"2453200","2456220"," There's tons of open source programs for gamma levels. "
"2456380","2456740"," You don't need that."
"2456800","2457600"," You don't need Spock Emma."
"2458440","2459660"," There's no requirement for it. "
"2469980","2470960"," Let me see here."
"2476050","2476970"," Hey, what if we track?"
"2478090","2478970"," They're right wrong."
"2478990","2480370"," They correlate that with other signals. "
"2480710","2481970"," That's a fair question, winky."
"2482910","2486430"," We should track how right they're out, how wrong they're right, not right, right and wrong."
"2487950","2489290"," You know, that would be funny, right?"
"2489490","2492850"," If we, if we fucking started to track it and post it on Twitter. "
"2493790","2495090"," How often they're right and wrong."
"2495810","2497630"," And just do a fucking check mark each day."
"2497630","2500830"," And update a, update a spreadsheet that we post. "
"2501610","2502590"," That would piss them off."
"2502770","2506110"," But I wonder if they'd try to fucking come after us legally."
"2507690","2509150"," It would be hilarious though. "
"2510370","2511390"," Yeah, this signal."
"2512510","2515290"," Can I check out here?"
"2515470","2516150"," Yeah, I'll put here up."
"2520680","2521860"," I'll load here in the background. "
"2522120","2522960"," Let's get Twitter real quick."
"2525200","2526640"," Give me a second here, guys."
"2526780","2529060"," You gotta keep scrolling through your comments this morning. "
"2532440","2534460"," We'll take a look at Twitter."
"2536260","2536660"," 49."
"2536860","2539100"," You can buy just by any fucking dip on Twitter, can't you?"
"2541360","2543220"," Buy any dip on Twitter and it prints. "
"2546710","2547970"," Same resistance, right?"
"2548150","2553190"," You sell 49.50. Go to back down by 45 on Twitter."
"2554330","2557570"," Now, if you think you're going to squeeze higher than 50 bucks, they've already given you a price"
"2557570","2557910"," target."
"2558670","2559070"," It's double. "
"2559490","2561130"," If there's a deal done, it'll be double."
"2561130","2562690"," It'll be 80 bucks."
"2562750","2563470"," I think I said $82. "
"2564130","2565650"," I think that's the price target I gave."
"2566390","2567450"," So I'm going to stick with that."
"2567850","2568970"," So keep buying dips on Twitter. "
"2569170","2571070"," If a deal comes through, it's going to double."
"2574000","2579920"," Now, that probably is a solid rip type place for Netflix."
"2580160","2580560"," Same thing. "
"2580640","2581920"," You've got some resistance above here."
"2582520","2583500"," We'll take a look at."
"2583800","2587360"," I'm not going to trust heroin indicator on Netflix currently, to be honest with you. "
"2587900","2589680"," I don't give a fuck whose buying calls on Twitter."
"2591780","2594160"," We talked about Twitter yesterday, right?"
"2594380","2595660"," Talk to you about buying dips on Twitter."
"2596240","2597520"," Why you buy dips on Twitter?"
"2597700","2598720"," How you average it on Twitter?"
"2599300","2600560"," We talked about how to buy Twitter. "
"2600860","2602860"," You start with 10% then 30 then 60."
"2603880","2609360"," You should get an average price at some point or, you know, from 200 down to like 150 I think"
"2609360","2612240"," I gave for buying Twitter."
"2613640","2616300"," You still see people trying to sell at 230. "
"2617360","2623460"," If it does squeeze higher, 250 would be a price target on Netflix."
"2625020","2626340"," Dip buying on Netflix."
"2626900","2627980"," If you're going to dip buy in Netflix. "
"2632180","2633680"," Yeah, there it is right there, right?"
"2634680","2639560"," There's that 150 target we talked about eventually will eventually probably get down to 150."
"2640040","2643260"," Not guaranteed, but you can buy the dip."
"2643400","2648640"," We talked about this yesterday by the dip on Netflix right where we are by at 200 by it. "
"2648740","2650540"," I think it was at 180 or something."
"2651200","2653320"," Well, I'll show it on a candlestick chart we talked about yesterday."
"2653320","2660080"," And then your final buy would be down around 150 on Netflix, accumulate and hold Tesla. "
"2661840","2662840"," Nice bounce this morning."
"2663200","2664480"," Let's move and scroll this over here."
"2666360","2669220"," We'll add some here indicator here. "
"2681020","2681900"," Scroll this back."
"2684480","2686260"," See what the regime is on Tesla."
"2690480","2693580"," Intraday traders are going to buy it at 980 and sell it at 1050. "
"2700280","2705940"," Some dip buyers stepping in at 10.20, but your intraday best buy is 980."
"2706580","2716480"," Sorry, 9.90. If you're trying to trade the Tesla by 9.90 and possibly 1,000, but your"
"2716480","2725340"," bottom is 9.90. You've got some intraday buyers down here at 10.20. And you now confined to selling"
"2725340","2727060"," at 10.40 and 1050."
"2737540","2738040"," Oof. "
"2742110","2743370"," It's a tough one here."
"2743610","2745090"," You got more buyers here on here."
"2752140","2754660"," Here I'm going to give you to 19 bucks, I guess, right?"
"2754800","2757420"," I'll give you, you got more buyers than sellers right now in here. "
"2758300","2761780"," But there is a trigger sell on $19 on here."
"2769660","2771520"," Major resistance at 2,180."
"2773020","2773960"," 19, 2,180. "
"2781680","2783360"," There's a lot of sellers above."
"2793220","2799040"," Based on some news, possibly $26, but even then you're talking about some pretty fierce selling"
"2799040","2799600"," above here."
"2800320","2804480"," There's 22, starting at 21, 19, somewhere in there. "
"2804780","2806140"," 19 to 21."
"2806740","2809960"," And then once you get up around this $26, it should be able to not sell."
"2809960","2815820"," And the futures testing you lose along with US stock markets now as a bond prices continue to firm"
"2815820","2817820"," up now across the curve. "
"2817820","2819020"," Two years recoup."
"2819140","2824220"," Most of the day's losses and the 10-year yield is now down to 2.87% down four on"
"2824220","2824520"," the day."
"2824940","2826140"," So those sellers above it?"
"2826140","2826880"," Risk off clearly. "
"2827240","2831720"," The tone here as we head towards into the end of trading this week."
"2832420","2835280"," European equity markets are down on the order of 2%."
"2835280","2836860"," Bond prices are moving higher. "
"2836940","2838180"," I'd be aware of this right here."
"2838300","2838320"," I'm going to talk earlier."
"2838520","2841100"," Session blows. "
"2841560","2843500"," Be aware of this band of sellers right here."
"2843600","2848240"," They moved down from 4.37 and they moved straight down to 4.30. And the 10-year yield is"
"2848240","2849920"," now down at basis point on the day."
"2855240","2857500"," You heard me say I'm not buying that dip, right?"
"2858020","2859540"," That's a warning to all you bulls. "
"2859940","2861320"," Do not buy that fucking dip."
"2870300","2872360"," For retesting the lows right now."
"2873340","2874680"," Down below here. "
"2875440","2876000"," That's S2."
"2876180","2876940"," This is your support."
"2877320","2878740"," This is your support zone. "
"2880040","2882080"," Should not trade lower than here."
"2882660","2884360"," The absolute low is 430."
"2884740","2885600"," Expect a reaction. "
"2886220","2888300"," Some kind of V shape recovery down here."
"2888300","2893520"," Even with that said, I've told you that if you see real money selling in indexes and in stocks,"
"2894170","2896780"," it's not going to matter that we're at a put wall here."
"2897340","2904040"," It's not something that you can account for in the options market. "
"2904360","2910600"," Furthermore, if you see panic inside the market, they want to get out now before we hit something"
"2910600","2911120"," lower."
"2911800","2914420"," You could see that real money selling kick in at some point."
"2915180","2916820"," Not a bull's trade here. "
"2916820","2918200"," This is sell the rip."
"2919020","2920360"," Sell the rip here."
"2927150","2928450"," What do you guys are saying here?"
"2928870","2930570"," It's hard to say I'll go track and get out. "
"2930730","2932790"," This is your territory perhaps."
"2933030","2933430"," Check here."
"2933970","2935010"," Touch by head gas. "
"2935210","2937390"," I would say that someone is selling those because there's no chance."
"2937970","2939250"," Has that already reversed?"
"2940190","2941750"," No, it didn't."
"2941910","2944790"," Was there a corresponding order flow?"
"2945110","2947450"," Did they maybe sell the 20s to buy the 15s?"
"2948050","2949770"," Wednesday, the great food for reclensing. "
"2951130","2953290"," Let me see if I get a buddy to look at the one on the services."
"2955050","2955990"," Let me see here."
"2956410","2959170"," Those are either implying there's no chance to hear. "
"2959390","2959750"," It's 20."
"2960790","2962490"," Put it in the here in the 20 or below."
"2963570","2965490"," Yeah, there's sellers hiding above on here. "
"2966290","2970250"," There's a lot of buyers currently on here, but they're testing the upper bounds of here."
"2973430","2974550"," Handshakes over buy button."
"2974550","2977330"," Not sure to sell either, but target a lower low. "
"2977950","2979070"," I think you'll get below that wall."
"2979750","2980730"," Yeah, good morning, Avery."
"2980870","2981150"," How are you?"
"2981410","2983670"," Do I think it gets below this wall here?"
"2984050","2987230"," I do, but I don't think it happens today unless you see real money selling. "
"2987370","2992070"," I'm not seeing a put flow that would correspond to that currently unless I missed something this"
"2992070","2992350"," morning."
"2993030","2998030"," A couple hundred thousand dollars and put flow is not enough to send it careening."
"2998490","3001290"," The only thing that would send it careening down here where we are. "
"3002030","3010430"," I think it'll send it careening down because if you see some kind of an it wouldn't correspond to"
"3010430","3012790"," any kind of options flow or hedging flow."
"3013350","3015650"," This would just be market panic at some point."
"3016230","3019230"," That would create a trade lower than 430 at this point. "
"3019790","3025230"," Now, if you did see weakness down to 430, SD is telling you to expect a whiplash trade higher."
"3025970","3029790"," So if we do get down to 430 today, I might consider buying some calls down here."
"3029870","3030450"," I'll be honest with you. "
"3030490","3031070"," If we get down here."
"3031890","3034930"," If we get down here, I might throw some money in there and see what we can do."
"3036150","3037290"," But I don't think we do. "
"3037490","3038510"," I don't think we get down here."
"3039110","3042090"," I think that the trade is a bear trade higher."
"3043190","3047510"," Now, SD is trying to leave some room for themselves saying it can get as high as 450. "
"3048010","3048790"," I doubt it."
"3048870","3051370"," I think you get up to I think at best."
"3053210","3055630"," I think if let's look at it like this. "
"3058080","3062220"," I think at best because we've reversed."
"3063180","3065500"," I think at best at 440 you can take."
"3065740","3069920"," I think the best trade is a 440 trade lower down to those 420s. "
"3070980","3074020"," I don't think you actually get up here and test this again."
"3074740","3076020"," Test this channel."
"3076740","3080560"," I don't think you get up here again and attempt to do a breakout. "
"3080880","3082900"," If we do though, I'd buy calls down here."
"3083020","3085580"," If we get up here, I'll buy some calls to go up higher."
"3086740","3088500"," But that's not what I'm interested in at all. "
"3088500","3094740"," At this point for myself, I'm more interested in a bottom buy down here."
"3095080","3095780"," Oh, sorry, hold on."
"3096260","3099740"," I'm more interested in a market liquidation event to buy. "
"3100280","3103360"," I'm more interested in repositioning a trade lower."
"3103800","3107760"," I'm most certainly not looking to buy fucking puts right here."
"3108680","3111680"," This trade's done even if we were to trade down here. "
"3112420","3117360"," I'd rather miss this trade than risk any kind of a snapback snap."
"3117360","3122100"," I know how this car, not often, but most of the time you can lose your ass in here trying"
"3122100","3122940"," to buy puts or shorts."
"3123700","3127260"," So you're not going to fucking sweet talk me to buy your bags down here. "
"3127340","3128120"," I'm not buying your bags."
"3128840","3130700"," I'd rather buy them up there and take them down lower."
"3132080","3134860"," I don't give a fuck if we trade down and touch this little PP down here. "
"3134960","3137400"," You have no business buying puts down here."
"3138140","3138580"," No business."
"3150410","3151590"," So leave this up here. "
"3152630","3153310"," We'll bring back."
"3158810","3159870"," We'll bring back."
"3160110","3160990"," We got here. "
"3162530","3164550"," This is for next week."
"3164770","3165750"," We're looking at here."
"3165910","3167470"," We've got, we'll take a little closer. "
"3167930","3169110"," Just some of the bigger names."
"3169130","3170550"," We've got Coca Cola Activision."
"3171390","3174490"," We still have some smaller banks coming out with some reports. "
"3174590","3178050"," We have some big heavy hitters on Tuesday, which is interesting."
"3178110","3180190"," We've got no news on Monday, right?"
"3181270","3182290"," And then we've got Microsoft."
"3182630","3183410"," We've got Alphabet. "
"3183410","3187410"," We've got Visa, GM, 3M, Raytheon."
"3188530","3190070"," And then we've got some more heavy hitters."
"3190350","3193470"," We've got, they say heavy hitter with a light tone. "
"3193890","3197670"," We've got Meta, Boeing, PayPal, Ford, Qualcomm, Spotify."
"3198190","3201050"," These are all retail faves, right?"
"3201330","3202430"," Some, not all, but some of them."
"3203790","3210010"," We've also got Apple, Roku, Amazon, Twitter, Intel, Caterpillar, Robinhood, Nokia. "
"3210010","3212190"," So, Southwest, some airlines, right?"
"3213790","3218890"," Then we've got Exxon, Chevron, Phillips, a bunch of gas oil producers heading into Friday."
"3219150","3223010"," So some pretty fucking heavy hitters heading into next week."
"3224570","3231010"," Earlier in the week, we talked about, earlier in the week, we talked about, if we get this week out"
"3231010","3235150"," of the way, when we're talking about, hey, once you get all these big heavy, all these companies"
"3235150","3238450"," that are holding up the indexes, right?"
"3238450","3241910"," If you don't get good reports from these guys, right?"
"3242090","3245610"," You still have some, like AMD doesn't hold the indexes up, right?"
"3246610","3247990"," Uber doesn't hold up the indexes. "
"3249870","3252390"," Etsy doesn't hold up the indexes, believe it or not."
"3254530","3257390"," So, we talked about this earlier in the week."
"3257510","3258650"," These don't have good reports. "
"3259550","3264810"," If the banks are looking for any excuse to sell these companies down, you saw Tesla sell down,"
"3264990","3265070"," right?"
"3265590","3267210"," Tesla had a pretty decent..."
"3267210","3268870"," I would say it was neutral."
"3269310","3270210"," I would say it was good."
"3270670","3272530"," It wasn't fucking mind-blowing. "
"3272810","3274710"," Some of the guidance was fucking pretty good."
"3274730","3276350"," I mean, really good guidance."
"3276930","3279970"," But even they sold off and they took..."
"3279970","3282550"," Banks took the money and ran yesterday. "
"3283390","3286270"," So that would more than likely be the regime for these companies."
"3287050","3290850"," If Alphabet, Microsoft, if they don't fucking..."
"3290850","3294310"," I don't know, pull fucking blow fucking rainbows out of their asses."
"3295510","3297990"," Met it doesn't blow rainbow out of its ass. "
"3297990","3300790"," If Amazon doesn't blow rainbow, as a matter of fact, it was hilarious."
"3301070","3303750"," You saw Amazon trying to fucking put some lipstick on the pig."
"3304530","3305790"," Yesterday, before, right?"
"3306110","3307690"," New services and all kinds of nonsense. "
"3308570","3310670"," Trying to take a cue from Netflix."
"3311570","3312310"," And we've got Apple."
"3312430","3314610"," If these guys don't blow some fucking..."
"3314610","3318650"," If Apple doesn't come out with a fucking Apple car, right?"
"3318990","3322170"," Even if they go up, the expectation is they're going to sell off. "
"3322170","3323270"," So you've got Netflix."
"3324590","3326150"," I don't know who the fuck they hired."
"3326370","3327590"," They must have hired like..."
"3328170","3334170"," They must have hired douchebag fucking PR firm to run their ER this year. "
"3334670","3335630"," And you know what happened to them."
"3336250","3338210"," Tesla had a pretty fucking good report."
"3338970","3340330"," And you know what happened to them. "
"3341650","3343410"," And so if you're not..."
"3343410","3349270"," No, it'd be tough to see Alphabet go down or even Microsoft, they are darlings of the banks."
"3350030","3351710"," But I do warn you that..."
"3352590","3355110"," You know, if Apple doesn't have a fucking car or something, right?"
"3355690","3359150"," And it's going to end up trading just like a small cap."
"3359970","3362410"," You see these small low-flow stocks that banks buy. "
"3362930","3363930"," They fucking..."
"3363930","3368790"," If there's a good report, they run them up in after hours, and they sell them off by fucking open"
"3368790","3369470"," next day."
"3369890","3371490"," So if you even had options, you were fucked."
"3372430","3372510"," Right?"
"3372990","3376110"," So you can only buy the underlying and then take profit off the underlying. "
"3376110","3382770"," Buy the underlying physical stock, run it into ER, and then you take your money at 4 a.m. by"
"3382770","3383290"," the next morning."
"3384210","3387330"," So if that takes place, we can see acceleration into next week, right?"
"3387770","3388630"," That would be the key, right?"
"3389490","3390650"," You get a little rip here."
"3391330","3394050"," You put a little rip between now and let's say Monday. "
"3395030","3398570"," And then we trade sideways for these companies while they report."
"3400470","3405150"," And maybe you get some real money selling heading into Thursday, Friday, once everybody's got"
"3405150","3405630"," their..."
"3405630","3407450"," As they're dirty laundry, they're good laundry, right?"
"3407530","3411570"," You start to see this ramp down into FOMC."
"3412070","3415050"," And then once we get to FOMC, we get this, that huge blast off. "
"3415850","3417030"," We'll make it..."
"3417030","3419470"," Make it front-run here into like the third or the fourth."
"3419650","3420690"," We start blasting off iron."
"3421410","3423270"," But just keep this, keep this, use this. "
"3423270","3430110"," Unfortunately, the German government expects their 2023 economic growth at 2.5% and they're cutting"
"3430110","3435150"," their 2022 growth forecast at 2.2% from 3.6% prior."
"3436450","3441390"," Press source report here on German government and their expected forecast."
"3442750","3447530"," Specifically, the government is going to cite concerns over energy supplies, which could further"
"3447530","3449070"," subdue German growth expectations. "
"3452730","3455870"," So laying into what's S.G. saying they say we should hit a lower bound today."
"3456330","3459810"," If it gets really low, we've got big tech earnings next week, right?"
"3459970","3464130"," We should see some kind of a ramp into them, at least to pin the market up high enough to"
"3464130","3464910"," let these guys report."
"3465710","3471570"," If anything's ugly, bad or not, we're making a new apple car expect, you know, this roll down into"
"3471570","3477070"," the third or fourth and then a snap higher once we get into the FOMC meeting. "
"3480180","3482620"," All in line, I guess, with ER reports, right?"
"3483520","3485260"," Now testing lower bounds on the spy."
"3487560","3496740"," 433, some support down here at 432.66. If this breaks this 432 down below, we still have this"
"3496740","3497800"," 430 here."
"3497940","3502060"," This is the S.G. report for him saying if we break down, this should be your lower bound. "
"3502180","3503540"," You should see a snapback trade."
"3503940","3506420"," Looks like more buyers are stepping in though at 429."
"3507040","3508580"," Just give that as a price target. "
"3509300","3511120"," 429 for today would be lower bound."
"3512040","3515240"," And you also have even more dip buyers stepping down lower at 427."
"3518610","3518970"," 425. "
"3520210","3520570"," 422."
"3522150","3523010"," And then 420."
"3524830","3525930"," I don't think we get that low. "
"3526030","3527510"," I don't honestly don't believe we get that low."
"3536210","3537670"," Scroll up here and see what you guys are saying."
"3544450","3548090"," Brian Watts, YouTube channel is wiped out of videos again. "
"3548830","3551050"," He deletes all of his videos just as a heads up."
"3551170","3555490"," If you don't know that, if any of you guys don't know that there, he just never leaves videos up."
"3555490","3559930"," He goes in and he deletes them every week, three weeks, something like that. "
"3560250","3561970"," That was always my experience with his videos."
"3563110","3567670"," He had a, I don't know if I remember this."
"3568430","3572410"," I'm not going to comment on this too much. "
"3573470","3577310"," But he had a falling out with someone out there in social media."
"3577570","3585470"," I think he was partnered up with another trader or he was, I don't know if he was, I don't"
"3585470","3588590"," know if that was a YouTuber, this was many years ago."
"3589130","3592430"," Not many, but I want to say two years ago, maybe three or four years ago. "
"3593030","3598170"," And they had a falling out or something and I don't know how that all went."
"3598350","3601270"," But I know that he's been deleting his shit for some time now."
"3601550","3603590"," He always, he always, or he's been doing it for some time now. "
"3603930","3610170"," I don't know if it's related to that situation, but I've been calling out."
"3610170","3612330"," I'll just eat those 420 of them."
"3612690","3614510"," Yeah, I still, I'm still sitting on 420. "
"3614970","3617810"," Oh, I'm sitting on 420s, but they're for today, today expiry."
"3619990","3625010"," I got four, I got, I still holding fucking 420 Ps for today expiry."
"3629530","3631650"," Spy for 20. "
"3632490","3633890"," I only work in a very few sizamos."
"3634250","3635330"," Too much there is a good price."
"3635510","3636010"," I'm holding forever. "
"3636990","3637470"," Try W wipes."
"3637690","3641710"," This video is off and I guess short term plays."
"3643410","3644610"," Market is shooting first. "
"3644610","3645810"," Ask some questions later."
"3646530","3647650"," Last year or two."
"3648430","3650530"," Oh, I've been watching facts since eight. "
"3650910","3653030"," No way Facebook doesn't post the loss of users."
"3653750","3654610"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"3655690","3656730"," I'm not a fan of Facebook. "
"3661170","3661610"," Thanks."
"3661790","3662690"," Wanted to slaughter Tesla."
"3663010","3663570"," I'm going to step back. "
"3664530","3665470"," Wait a minute."
"3665890","3667550"," The chat's kind of getting wonky."
"3667770","3669850"," It's like, it's like snapping back and forth. "
"3671350","3673090"," T-com reports next."
"3673570","3674790"," It beats the shit right now."
"3674950","3677070"," There is expanding megaphone information forming on. "
"3677510","3678550"," And he asks, tick cart."
"3679410","3681810"," Do you think T can go back 25 soon?"
"3681990","3683370"," I need to load up and then I'm 20 bucks."
"3683530","3683830"," Looks decent. "
"3685190","3686110"," I love T right now."
"3687210","3688050"," Fucking love T."
"3693860","3694540"," All right."
"3696780","3697540"," There we go. "
"3709400","3712360"," This is like the time where I want to get this is going to grind."
"3714560","3716340"," They watching this grind right now."
"3716340","3718160"," I'm like, I just want to do something else right now. "
"3718700","3720620"," So we'll talk about something else yesterday."
"3720820","3721460"," Oh, we'll see."
"3721600","3723580"," We're seeing some put buying right now in the spy. "
"3724160","3725800"," For 22 for 32."
"3726460","3728100"," $100,000."
"3728420","3732540"," $108,000 for 33 P and 432 P light light flow. "
"3733020","3737820"," IWM my 20th 187 P for $1.6 million."
"3738820","3740180"," May 20th 187."
"3741300","3743480"," Some spy puts down here. "
"3744600","3748660"," IWM 520 187 P for $7 million."
"3749480","3752700"," And then spy puts major spy puts real money."
"3752700","3760440"," So our real real put buying June 17th for 14 P 6.9 million dollars. "
"3760880","3765900"," And then 520 for 14 P 4.8 million dollars."
"3768710","3776890"," So some large hedging coming into the market on spy and IWM for June and May."
"3777150","3781890"," It looks like May and June May 20th and June 17th. "
"3783070","3785030"," And then May 20th."
"3785110","3785810"," Once again."
"3919260","3920600"," Let me just second here. "
"3976940","3984830"," Watching us quick turnaround on on the spy."
"3988130","3993110"," Twitter fucking banging banging off for $49 and 4973."
"3993610","3997610"," We know that there's a cell up here where there's or there's a cell above here. "
"3997910","4001190"," And the buy zone has been down here at $45."
"4001190","4007880"," Anywhere below $45 buy anything below down here."
"4008000","4010140"," We've been talking about this since the announcement right. "
"4010560","4015160"," One buy kick ass, another buy kick ass, another buy just printed as well."
"4015940","4018060"," So we have another another print here."
"4018520","4020060"," Be cautious if you're trading Twitter. "
"4021060","4026980"," It seems like we're selling above here at $50 unless there's an announcement that's made."
"4027080","4029380"," If there is an announcement that's made, I haven't seen it yet."
"4030620","4040170"," We'll bring Twitter back up again and look to see if that cell wall is still there on Twitter. "
"4047400","4055600"," Spy trying to fight through a $4.3350. Some light selling above again at $4.34.28 and $4.34 "
"4055600","4063400",".97. If there's going to be a squeeze in the spy, you're going to see it above $4.35.18."
"4070430","4072250"," Clear skies to $4.40 from there."
"4082120","4084720"," And there's that $50 mark right here with sellers."
"4085640","4088980"," We'll take a look and see if they're strong sellers or not. "
"4089920","4092100"," It doesn't look like it looks like Twitter could trade."
"4092820","4097540"," Looks like Twitter could possibly trade to $52 today to be a new high."
"4097880","4100120"," I think a new high on Twitter. "
"4100479","4105439"," We had one we had one moment we traded to $53.60 previously."
"4105439","4111939"," It was in, I think it was in a pre-market trading on the 14th."
"4113140","4117840"," And then back again on the original announcement on the 5th of April. "
"4118800","4124859"," So we have some previous resistance above at $53.54 in this zone here."
"4126060","4129240"," And again at $55.00. Looks like those sellers have moved down."
"4129240","4132800"," So the $56.94 sellers that were here before. "
"4133100","4138180"," Looks like they've moved down to $54.00. That would be an extreme for Twitter today."
"4138660","4140420"," $54.00, look at $54.00 and extreme."
"4141560","4149529"," And then this is the take the money and run zone here at $50.00. Trading like a firm was"
"4149529","4149750"," trading. "
"4150370","4152189"," Twitter's been a kick-ass trade by the way."
"4152630","4154090"," Remember when a firm was trading like this?"
"4154770","4159069"," You could pretty consistently buy the bottom and run it up."
"4161460","4162720"," And we'll look once more. "
"4164359","4166720"," You'll see that 53.54 zone."
"4167240","4170540"," This is that 52 volatility zone above here."
"4171220","4173300"," These have been some great trades down here. "
"4173540","4179180"," Any kind of dip buying down below has led to some great money on Twitter."
"4179979","4183380"," One, two, three, four times now."
"4183660","4184380"," Great trading on Twitter. "
"4200380","4202900"," We'll keep checking back on Twitter and see if this sells."
"4203100","4204420"," If this is a nice place, take a short."
"4209600","4210700"," Spy could squeeze here. "
"4211180","4211800"," I'm not going to lie."
"4212300","4213080"," There might be a squeeze."
"4215400","4218060"," There might be a squeeze presenting itself on the spy. "
"4218800","4219480"," It's possible."
"4220540","4226880"," To start seeing these sellers here in this tight range here that we have, probably going to end up"
"4226880","4234770"," really going to get a pretty decent sell-off in the spy or we're going to get a pretty decent"
"4234770","4242280"," squeeze on the spy."
"4242440","4244180"," These sellers are worn out at any point. "
"4245000","4246280"," We're going to blast off here."
"4248400","4249620"," We'll monitor this."
"4249700","4251280"," I might grab some calls down here. "
"4251460","4256660"," If we can get a dip down below a quick dip and then a rip, this could be a good"
"4256660","4257860"," day for a squeeze."
"4262040","4262440"," We're right here."
"4262440","4263600"," I tried to squeeze here. "
"4264800","4265240"," Failed."
"4265780","4267540"," Bouncing back down to find more buyers."
"4268640","4272840"," If we can grab this and run this up today, we'll see how this works itself out. "
"4295560","4299220"," I'm going to be looking for a dip buy down here probably today if I can get one."
"4299900","4303420"," I'm going to look for 430 right down here."
"4303560","4306300"," If I can grab a dip buy down in here, we can get down here today. "
"4307340","4309800"," We can get down here and I can grab a buy into the bell."
"4310740","4315820"," Or if we come down here and start going like this, I might buy some calls for Monday in here."
"4323990","4327150"," Give me 15 minutes, 10.42 AM. "
"4328550","4330650"," It's 10.42. It's backed by 11 AM."
"4330810","4331430"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"4331790","4334610"," I'm going to grab myself some coffee for the rest of the morning. "
"4335670","4336850"," We'll talk about my staircase."
"4337390","4340790"," I can't afford to be at my staircase renovated."
"4341530","4347330"," I just bought a century home and I've got two flights of stairs that are fucking beautiful. "
"4348230","4351550"," And the quote that I got for this staircase was 20 grand."
"4352210","4353450"," And I was like, fuck no."
"4354250","4357250"," So now I'm taking on this restoration of the staircase myself. "
"4357750","4360250"," And it is a shit ton of work."
"4360870","4362010"," A shit ton."
"4363270","4367430"," So I'm going to ask you guys what you guys know about renovating century homes. "
"4367870","4368390"," Thank you."
"4368390","4369270"," It's Bailey Singh inflation."
"4369270","4371950"," We'll go higher in the UK duty. "
"4372750","4375310"," Speaking on a panel at the IMF thing."
"4377710","4383070"," Bailey's saying how much higher UK inflation goes depends critically on the path of energy prices."
"4387130","4388210"," We'll have to look at the. "
"4389510","4394650"," We'll take a look at a chart comparison chart of oil and the S&P 500 or the New York."
"4396790","4397710"," Composite index."
"4398970","4403590"," Because there are some oil oil and gas bulls out there that want to see oil rip higher. "
"4404270","4407310"," Whenever that's happened, it's kicked into recessions."
"4408330","4410330"," And we're at that crossing point right now."
"4410350","4416290"," If you look at where the S&P 500 is and where the oil trade is, there's a we're at"
"4416290","4416590"," a."
"4416590","4420130"," Cross over point where foiled trades higher. "
"4420410","4425330"," You'll see the S&P fall for some period of time anywhere from like one to three years."
"4425830","4426910"," We'll take a look at that later on."
"4427770","4429530"," What Bailey is discussing this morning. "
"4430270","4434950"," And Billy saying well inflation will go higher in the UK due to energy."
"4436190","4437150"," He's from the UK."
"4438170","4440130"," We'll take a look at the US chart on that as well. "
"4440630","4443290"," I'll be back in 15 minutes at 11 AM."
"4444110","4444710"," Gonna grab some coffee."
"4445350","4450150"," Get yourself some, get yourself some whiskey or some whatever you think you do today drink if you"
"4450150","4454370"," drink tea or if you drink water and we'll have a toast later on this afternoon as well. "
"4454730","4455250"," So we'll be back in 15."
"4460340","4462360"," I'll keep this up for you so you can see it right here. "
